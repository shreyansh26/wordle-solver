We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not the second letter, and A is not the third letter.
 - The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

 We also know that the secret word is 5 letters long.

 We need to make a second guess that:
 - Does not use C, N, E (since they are absent)
 - Includes R and A (but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively)
 - We can try to use other common letters to get more information.

 Since R and A are in the word, we should try to place them in different positions.

 Let's think of a word that:
 - Has R and A, but R not in position 2 and A not in position 3.
 - Avoids C, N, E.

 Also, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Common consonants: S, T, L, etc.
 Vowels: We already have A, so we might try O or I.

 Let's try to form a word that has R and A, and also includes other common letters.

 Possibilities: 
 - We can try to put R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2)
 - We can try to put A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3)

 Since we have two letters that are present (R and A), we can try to use them in new positions and add three new letters.

 Let's consider the word ""ROAST"", but note that we have to avoid the positions we know:
 - R in ""ROAST"" is in position 1 -> that's allowed (since we only know it's not in position 2)
 - O is new
 - A is in position 2 -> but we don't have a restriction on A for position 2? Our restriction for A is that it cannot be in position 3. So position 2 is allowed for A.
 - S and T are new.

 However, we must note that the feedback for ""crane"" told us that R is in the word but not in position 2, and A is in the word but not in position 3. It doesn't say anything about other positions.

 But wait: in ""ROAST"", A is in position 2. We don't have any feedback that A cannot be in position 2. So that's okay.

 However, we must also consider that the word must be valid.

 But note: we have to avoid using C, N, E. ""ROAST"" doesn't have these, so it's okay.

 Let me check: R, O, A, S, T.

 But we have two known letters: R and A. We are including them. The new letters are O, S, T.

 This seems like a good candidate because it tests three new letters.

 Alternatively, we could try ""PARTY"", but that has T and Y. However, we don't know about T and Y.

 Another idea: ""RAISE"" -> but we have to avoid E? Actually, E is absent, so we cannot use E. So ""RAISE"" has E -> not allowed.

 How about ""RADIO""? 
 - R in position 1 -> allowed.
 - A in position 2 -> allowed (since we only know A isn't in position 3).
 - But we have D, I, O. And we avoid C, N, E.

 However, we are introducing three new letters: D, I, O.

 But note: we have two known letters (R and A) and three new ones. That's efficient.

 Another candidate: ""STARK"" -> but we don't have A in this word? We must include A because we know it's in the word. So we have to include A.

 So, we must have a word that includes R and A.

 Let me list a few words that include R and A, and avoid C, N, E:

 - ROAST: R, O, A, S, T -> positions: R(1), O(2), A(3), S(4), T(5)
   But note: in the first guess, A was in position 3 and we were told it's in the word but wrong position. 
   Now we are putting A in position 3 again? That would be the same position. We know A is not in position 3, so we cannot put A in position 3 again.

   So we must avoid putting A in position 3.

   In ""ROAST"", A is in position 3 -> not allowed.

 - How about ""RATIO""? 
   R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5). 
   Here, A is in position 2 -> allowed.

 - ""RADIO"": R(1), A(2), D(3), I(4), O(5) -> A in position 2 -> allowed.

 - ""ARTSY"": but A is in position 1 -> allowed, but the word has Y and S, and we don't know about them. Also, we have to avoid E? It doesn't have E.

 But note: we have to use valid words. ""ARTSY"" is valid? It's a word (meaning artistic). But let's see if we can get more common words.

 Another: ""PARTY"": P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), Y(5) -> A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 3 (allowed, because we only know it's not in position 2).

 But we have to avoid C, N, E. ""PARTY"" doesn't have these.

 However, we have two known letters (A and R) and we are putting R in position 3 and A in position 2. That's acceptable.

 But note: we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let me compare:

 Option 1: ""RADIO"" -> letters: R, A, D, I, O. We test D, I, O.
 Option 2: ""PARTY"" -> letters: P, A, R, T, Y. We test P, T, Y.
 Option 3: ""ROAST"" is invalid because A is in position 3.

 Another word: ""RAILS"" -> R(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), S(5). 
   A is in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed). We test I, L, S.

 But note: we have to avoid using the same letter twice? We are using R and A only once.

 We want to maximize new letters. Also, we want to cover common letters.

 Let's think about frequencies: 
   In English, S, T, L, O, I are common.

 So, ""RAILS"" uses R, A, I, L, S -> that's five new letters? Actually, we are using R and A, but we are testing three new ones.

 Alternatively, ""RADIO"" uses R, A, D, I, O -> testing D, I, O.

 ""PARTY"": P, A, R, T, Y -> testing P, T, Y.

 The most common letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. But we know E, N, C are absent. So we should test I, O, T, S, L.

 So, a word that includes R and A and tests I, O, T, S, L? That would be ideal.

 How about ""RASPY""? 
   R(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5). 
   A is in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed). We test S, P, Y.

 But we are missing O, I, T.

 Another: ""TRAIL"" -> T(1), R(2) -> wait, R is in position 2? But we know R is not in position 2? 
   Actually, the feedback for the first guess: R was in position 2 and we got a '-' meaning it is in the word but not in that position. 
   So we cannot put R in position 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it's not there. 
   So we should avoid putting R in position 2.

 In ""TRAIL"", R is in position 2 -> not allowed.

 How about ""STARK""? But we don't have A. We must include A.

 How about ""ARTSY""? A(1), R(2) -> R in position 2 is not allowed.

 How about ""RALLY""? 
   R(1), A(2), L(3), L(4), Y(5) -> but we have two L's? And we don't know if L is in the word. Also, we are repeating L? 
   But the word ""RALLY"" has two L's. We don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. But to maximize information, we might avoid repeats.

 Alternatively, ""RAILS"" (as I thought earlier) is without repeats and covers I, L, S.

 Another: ""RAPID"": R(1), A(2), P(3), I(4), D(5) -> A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed). We test P, I, D.

 But we are missing S, T, L.

 How about ""ROTLS""? Not a word.

 After considering, I think ""RAILS"" is a good candidate:
   R in position 1 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed), then I, L, S.

 But note: we have to make sure we don't use any of the absent letters (C, N, E). ""RAILS"" is clean.

 However, we have to consider that the secret word might have the letter in a different position. We are testing R in position 1 and A in position 2.

 Alternatively, we could try to put R in a different position, say position 4 or 5? 

 For example, ""PLANT"" has N and we know N is absent. So invalid.

 How about ""SPRAY"": 
   S(1), P(2), R(3), A(4), Y(5). 
   Here, R is in position 3 (allowed) and A is in position 4 (allowed, because we only know it's not in position 3). 
   We test S, P, Y.

 But we are not using the fact that we know A is in the word. We are using A.

 However, we are not using R in a new position? We are using R in position 3, which is new.

 But note: we have two known letters (R and A) and we are using them. Also, we are testing S, P, Y.

 But we are missing the opportunity to test more vowels? We already have A, and we know E is absent. So we might test O or I.

 Since we have two vowels already (A and ? we don't know), we might want to test O or I.

 Let me try to form a word that has R, A, and also O and I? 

 How about ""ORBIT""? 
   O(1), R(2) -> wait, R in position 2 is not allowed.

 How about ""ROBIN"": 
   R(1), O(2), B(3), I(4), N(5) -> but N is absent! We cannot use N.

 How about ""ROBIA""? Not a common word.

 How about ""RADIO"" (which we considered earlier) -> R(1), A(2), D(3), I(4), O(5). 
   This has A in position 2 (allowed) and R in position 1 (allowed). We test D, I, O.

 This seems good.

 But note: we are using R in position 1 and A in position 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Alternatively, we could try to put R in position 4 or 5? 

 For example, ""PLAIN"": 
   P(1), L(2), A(3) -> but A in position 3 is not allowed (we know A is not in position 3). So invalid.

 How about ""PARIS"": 
   P(1), A(2), R(3), I(4), S(5). 
   A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 3 (allowed). We test P, I, S.

 This is also a candidate.

 Now, which one to choose? 

 We want to test as many common letters as possible and avoid repeating known positions for R and A.

 Let me list the positions we are using for R and A in our candidates:

 - ""RADIO"": R(1), A(2)
 - ""PARTY"": P(1), A(2), R(3) -> note: R is in position 3 (which is new) and A in position 2 (new position for A).
 - ""RAILS"": R(1), A(2), then I(3), L(4), S(5) -> R in 1, A in 2, then I, L, S.

 The word ""PARTY"" uses the same positions for R and A as ""RADIO"" but then we test P, T, Y. 

 Since we have two letters that we know are in the word, we might want to try to place them in positions we haven't tried. 
 In the first guess, we had R in position 2 and A in position 3. Now we are trying A in position 2 and R in position 1 (in ""RADIO"") or in position 3 (in ""PARTY"").

 We don't have any information about position 1, so trying R in position 1 is a new position.

 Similarly, for A: we tried position 3 and now we try position 2.

 I think ""RADIO"" is a good choice because it tests three new vowels and consonants.

 But note: the secret word might not have O, I, D. We are testing them.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that uses more common consonants like S, T, L.

 How about ""STAIR"": 
   S(1), T(2), A(3) -> but A in position 3 is not allowed.

 How about ""TRAIL"": 
   T(1), R(2) -> R in position 2 is not allowed.

 How about ""RATIO"": 
   R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5) -> A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed). We test T, I, O.

 This is similar to ""RADIO"" but instead of D, we test T, I, O.

 ""RATIO"" is a valid word.

 Now, between ""RADIO"", ""RATIO"", ""PARTY"", and ""RAILS"", which one?

 We want to cover more common letters. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. 
 Since E, N, C are out, we can try T, O, I, S, L.

 ""RATIO"" has T, I, O -> that's three common letters.

 ""PARTY"" has P, T, Y -> Y is less common.

 ""RAILS"" has I, L, S -> that's three common letters.

 But note: in ""RAILS"", we are using R in position 1 and A in position 2. Then we have I, L, S in positions 3,4,5.

 In ""RATIO"", we have R in 1, A in 2, then T, I, O.

 I think ""RATIO"" is a good choice because it tests T, I, O which are very common.

 But wait: we have to avoid using letters we know are absent? We know C, N, E are absent, so ""RATIO"" is safe.

 Alternatively, we could try ""ROAST"" but we cannot because A would be in position 3 (which is forbidden).

 Another candidate: ""RASPY"" -> R(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5). 
   We test S, P, Y.

 But we are missing O and I.

 I think ""RATIO"" is a solid choice.

 However, note that the word ""RADIO"" is also good because it tests O and I.

 But let me check: the word ""RADIO"" is valid.

 Since we have two vowels already (A and we don't have any other vowels known), testing O and I is good.

 So, I'll go with ""RADIO"".

 But wait: what about the position of R? We know R is in the word but not in position 2. We are now putting R in position 1. 
 If the secret word has R in position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or an x? 

 Similarly, A in position 2: if it's correct, we get a check; if not, we get a minus or x? But we know A is in the word, so it won't be x.

 So, let's choose ""RADIO"".

 But note: we are using R and A again. That's okay because we are trying to find their correct positions.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't reuse R and A? But we have to include them because we know they are in the word. 

 Actually, we must include them because we are trying to get more information about their positions.

 So, I'll go with ""RADIO"".

 However, let me think of a word that uses R and A and also includes T, O, I? But we can't have all three? 

 How about ""TRAIL""? We can't because R must be included and we can't put R in position 2.

 Another: ""ARTIS"" -> not a word.

 I think ""RADIO"" is a good choice.

 But wait: what about ""RAINS""? 
   R(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), S(5) -> but N is absent! We cannot use N.

 So, we must avoid N.

 Therefore, ""RADIO"" is valid.

 Let me confirm: 
   R in position 1: we don't know if that's allowed? It is, because we only know R is not in position 2.
   A in position 2: we don't have a restriction for A in position 2? Only that it is not in position 3.

 So, I'll go with ""RADIO"".

 But note: we are using D. We don't know about D. It might be common or not.

 Alternatively, we could use ""ROAST"" if we were allowed to put A in a new position? But we cannot put A in position 3.

 How about ""RALLY""? 
   R(1), A(2), L(3), L(4), Y(5) -> but we have two L's. And we don't know if the word has two L's. Also, we are not testing as many new letters.

 I think ""RADIO"" is better.

 Let me search for a word that has R, A, T, O, I? 

 How about ""RATIO"" (which is the same as ""RADIO"" but rearranged). 
   R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5)

 This is a valid word and tests T, I, O.

 I think ""RATIO"" is slightly better because it has T and I (which are very common) and O.

 So, I'll go with ""RATIO"".

 But wait: in ""RATIO"", we are putting A in position 2 and R in position 1. 

 We know that R is in the word but not in position 2. We are now testing R in position 1. 
 If it's correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus.

 Similarly, A in position 2: we don't have a restriction for A in position 2, so we can test it.

 Therefore, I choose ""RATIO"".

 But note: we are using R and A again. That's okay.

 So, second guess: ""RATIO""

<guess>ratio</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, N, E** are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **R** is present but not in position 2 (marked ""-"").
- **A** is present but not in position 3 (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **R** and **A** (since they are confirmed present).
- Avoid **C, N, E** (absent letters).
- Test new common letters (e.g., **T, I, O**) to gather more information.
- **R** cannot be in position 2, and **A** cannot be in position 3.

The word **""RATIO""** fits these criteria:
- **R** is in position 1 (new position, not 2).
- **A** is in position 2 (new position, not 3).
- Introduces **T, I, O** (common letters not yet tested).
- Valid 5-letter word, avoiding forbidden letters.

This guess efficiently tests new positions for known letters and explores additional common letters.

<guess>ratio</guess>",ratio,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not the second letter, and A is not the third letter.
 - The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

 We also know that the secret word is 5 letters long.

 We need to make a second guess that:
 - Does not use C, N, E (since they are absent)
 - Includes R and A (but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively)
 - We can try to use other common letters to get more information.

 Since R and A are in the word, we should try to place them in different positions.

 Let's think of a word that:
 - Has R and A, but R not in position 2 and A not in position 3.
 - Avoids C, N, E.

 Also, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Common consonants: S, T, L, etc.
 Vowels: We already have A, so we might try O or I.

 Let's try to form a word that has R and A, and also includes other common letters.

 Possibilities: 
 - We can try to put R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2)
 - We can try to put A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3)

 Since we have two letters that are present (R and A), we can try to use them in new positions and add three new letters.

 Let's consider the word ""ROAST"", but note that we have to avoid the positions we know:
 - R in ""ROAST"" is in position 1 -> that's allowed (since we only know it's not in position 2)
 - O is new
 - A is in position 2 -> but we don't have a restriction on A for position 2? Our restriction for A is that it cannot be in position 3. So position 2 is allowed for A.
 - S and T are new.

 However, we must note that the feedback for ""crane"" told us that R is in the word but not in position 2, and A is in the word but not in position 3. It doesn't say anything about other positions.

 But wait: in ""ROAST"", A is in position 2. We don't have any feedback that A cannot be in position 2. So that's okay.

 However, we must also consider that the word must be valid.

 But note: we have to avoid using C, N, E. ""ROAST"" doesn't have these, so it's okay.

 Let me check: R, O, A, S, T.

 But we have two known letters: R and A. We are including them. The new letters are O, S, T.

 This seems like a good candidate because it tests three new letters.

 Alternatively, we could try ""PARTY"", but that has T and Y. However, we don't know about T and Y.

 Another idea: ""RAISE"" -> but we have to avoid E? Actually, E is absent, so we cannot use E. So ""RAISE"" has E -> not allowed.

 How about ""RADIO""? 
 - R in position 1 -> allowed.
 - A in position 2 -> allowed (since we only know A isn't in position 3).
 - But we have D, I, O. And we avoid C, N, E.

 However, we are introducing three new letters: D, I, O.

 But note: we have two known letters (R and A) and three new ones. That's efficient.

 Another candidate: ""STARK"" -> but we don't have A in this word? We must include A because we know it's in the word. So we have to include A.

 So, we must have a word that includes R and A.

 Let me list a few words that include R and A, and avoid C, N, E:

 - ROAST: R, O, A, S, T -> positions: R(1), O(2), A(3), S(4), T(5)
   But note: in the first guess, A was in position 3 and we were told it's in the word but wrong position. 
   Now we are putting A in position 3 again? That would be the same position. We know A is not in position 3, so we cannot put A in position 3 again.

   So we must avoid putting A in position 3.

   In ""ROAST"", A is in position 3 -> not allowed.

 - How about ""RATIO""? 
   R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5). 
   Here, A is in position 2 -> allowed.

 - ""RADIO"": R(1), A(2), D(3), I(4), O(5) -> A in position 2 -> allowed.

 - ""ARTSY"": but A is in position 1 -> allowed, but the word has Y and S, and we don't know about them. Also, we have to avoid E? It doesn't have E.

 But note: we have to use valid words. ""ARTSY"" is valid? It's a word (meaning artistic). But let's see if we can get more common words.

 Another: ""PARTY"": P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), Y(5) -> A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 3 (allowed, because we only know it's not in position 2).

 But we have to avoid C, N, E. ""PARTY"" doesn't have these.

 However, we have two known letters (A and R) and we are putting R in position 3 and A in position 2. That's acceptable.

 But note: we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let me compare:

 Option 1: ""RADIO"" -> letters: R, A, D, I, O. We test D, I, O.
 Option 2: ""PARTY"" -> letters: P, A, R, T, Y. We test P, T, Y.
 Option 3: ""ROAST"" is invalid because A is in position 3.

 Another word: ""RAILS"" -> R(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), S(5). 
   A is in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed). We test I, L, S.

 But note: we have to avoid using the same letter twice? We are using R and A only once.

 We want to maximize new letters. Also, we want to cover common letters.

 Let's think about frequencies: 
   In English, S, T, L, O, I are common.

 So, ""RAILS"" uses R, A, I, L, S -> that's five new letters? Actually, we are using R and A, but we are testing three new ones.

 Alternatively, ""RADIO"" uses R, A, D, I, O -> testing D, I, O.

 ""PARTY"": P, A, R, T, Y -> testing P, T, Y.

 The most common letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. But we know E, N, C are absent. So we should test I, O, T, S, L.

 So, a word that includes R and A and tests I, O, T, S, L? That would be ideal.

 How about ""RASPY""? 
   R(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5). 
   A is in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed). We test S, P, Y.

 But we are missing O, I, T.

 Another: ""TRAIL"" -> T(1), R(2) -> wait, R is in position 2? But we know R is not in position 2? 
   Actually, the feedback for the first guess: R was in position 2 and we got a '-' meaning it is in the word but not in that position. 
   So we cannot put R in position 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it's not there. 
   So we should avoid putting R in position 2.

 In ""TRAIL"", R is in position 2 -> not allowed.

 How about ""STARK""? But we don't have A. We must include A.

 How about ""ARTSY""? A(1), R(2) -> R in position 2 is not allowed.

 How about ""RALLY""? 
   R(1), A(2), L(3), L(4), Y(5) -> but we have two L's? And we don't know if L is in the word. Also, we are repeating L? 
   But the word ""RALLY"" has two L's. We don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. But to maximize information, we might avoid repeats.

 Alternatively, ""RAILS"" (as I thought earlier) is without repeats and covers I, L, S.

 Another: ""RAPID"": R(1), A(2), P(3), I(4), D(5) -> A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed). We test P, I, D.

 But we are missing S, T, L.

 How about ""ROTLS""? Not a word.

 After considering, I think ""RAILS"" is a good candidate:
   R in position 1 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed), then I, L, S.

 But note: we have to make sure we don't use any of the absent letters (C, N, E). ""RAILS"" is clean.

 However, we have to consider that the secret word might have the letter in a different position. We are testing R in position 1 and A in position 2.

 Alternatively, we could try to put R in a different position, say position 4 or 5? 

 For example, ""PLANT"" has N and we know N is absent. So invalid.

 How about ""SPRAY"": 
   S(1), P(2), R(3), A(4), Y(5). 
   Here, R is in position 3 (allowed) and A is in position 4 (allowed, because we only know it's not in position 3). 
   We test S, P, Y.

 But we are not using the fact that we know A is in the word. We are using A.

 However, we are not using R in a new position? We are using R in position 3, which is new.

 But note: we have two known letters (R and A) and we are using them. Also, we are testing S, P, Y.

 But we are missing the opportunity to test more vowels? We already have A, and we know E is absent. So we might test O or I.

 Since we have two vowels already (A and ? we don't know), we might want to test O or I.

 Let me try to form a word that has R, A, and also O and I? 

 How about ""ORBIT""? 
   O(1), R(2) -> wait, R in position 2 is not allowed.

 How about ""ROBIN"": 
   R(1), O(2), B(3), I(4), N(5) -> but N is absent! We cannot use N.

 How about ""ROBIA""? Not a common word.

 How about ""RADIO"" (which we considered earlier) -> R(1), A(2), D(3), I(4), O(5). 
   This has A in position 2 (allowed) and R in position 1 (allowed). We test D, I, O.

 This seems good.

 But note: we are using R in position 1 and A in position 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Alternatively, we could try to put R in position 4 or 5? 

 For example, ""PLAIN"": 
   P(1), L(2), A(3) -> but A in position 3 is not allowed (we know A is not in position 3). So invalid.

 How about ""PARIS"": 
   P(1), A(2), R(3), I(4), S(5). 
   A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 3 (allowed). We test P, I, S.

 This is also a candidate.

 Now, which one to choose? 

 We want to test as many common letters as possible and avoid repeating known positions for R and A.

 Let me list the positions we are using for R and A in our candidates:

 - ""RADIO"": R(1), A(2)
 - ""PARTY"": P(1), A(2), R(3) -> note: R is in position 3 (which is new) and A in position 2 (new position for A).
 - ""RAILS"": R(1), A(2), then I(3), L(4), S(5) -> R in 1, A in 2, then I, L, S.

 The word ""PARTY"" uses the same positions for R and A as ""RADIO"" but then we test P, T, Y. 

 Since we have two letters that we know are in the word, we might want to try to place them in positions we haven't tried. 
 In the first guess, we had R in position 2 and A in position 3. Now we are trying A in position 2 and R in position 1 (in ""RADIO"") or in position 3 (in ""PARTY"").

 We don't have any information about position 1, so trying R in position 1 is a new position.

 Similarly, for A: we tried position 3 and now we try position 2.

 I think ""RADIO"" is a good choice because it tests three new vowels and consonants.

 But note: the secret word might not have O, I, D. We are testing them.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that uses more common consonants like S, T, L.

 How about ""STAIR"": 
   S(1), T(2), A(3) -> but A in position 3 is not allowed.

 How about ""TRAIL"": 
   T(1), R(2) -> R in position 2 is not allowed.

 How about ""RATIO"": 
   R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5) -> A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed). We test T, I, O.

 This is similar to ""RADIO"" but instead of D, we test T, I, O.

 ""RATIO"" is a valid word.

 Now, between ""RADIO"", ""RATIO"", ""PARTY"", and ""RAILS"", which one?

 We want to cover more common letters. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. 
 Since E, N, C are out, we can try T, O, I, S, L.

 ""RATIO"" has T, I, O -> that's three common letters.

 ""PARTY"" has P, T, Y -> Y is less common.

 ""RAILS"" has I, L, S -> that's three common letters.

 But note: in ""RAILS"", we are using R in position 1 and A in position 2. Then we have I, L, S in positions 3,4,5.

 In ""RATIO"", we have R in 1, A in 2, then T, I, O.

 I think ""RATIO"" is a good choice because it tests T, I, O which are very common.

 But wait: we have to avoid using letters we know are absent? We know C, N, E are absent, so ""RATIO"" is safe.

 Alternatively, we could try ""ROAST"" but we cannot because A would be in position 3 (which is forbidden).

 Another candidate: ""RASPY"" -> R(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5). 
   We test S, P, Y.

 But we are missing O and I.

 I think ""RATIO"" is a solid choice.

 However, note that the word ""RADIO"" is also good because it tests O and I.

 But let me check: the word ""RADIO"" is valid.

 Since we have two vowels already (A and we don't have any other vowels known), testing O and I is good.

 So, I'll go with ""RADIO"".

 But wait: what about the position of R? We know R is in the word but not in position 2. We are now putting R in position 1. 
 If the secret word has R in position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or an x? 

 Similarly, A in position 2: if it's correct, we get a check; if not, we get a minus or x? But we know A is in the word, so it won't be x.

 So, let's choose ""RADIO"".

 But note: we are using R and A again. That's okay because we are trying to find their correct positions.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't reuse R and A? But we have to include them because we know they are in the word. 

 Actually, we must include them because we are trying to get more information about their positions.

 So, I'll go with ""RADIO"".

 However, let me think of a word that uses R and A and also includes T, O, I? But we can't have all three? 

 How about ""TRAIL""? We can't because R must be included and we can't put R in position 2.

 Another: ""ARTIS"" -> not a word.

 I think ""RADIO"" is a good choice.

 But wait: what about ""RAINS""? 
   R(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), S(5) -> but N is absent! We cannot use N.

 So, we must avoid N.

 Therefore, ""RADIO"" is valid.

 Let me confirm: 
   R in position 1: we don't know if that's allowed? It is, because we only know R is not in position 2.
   A in position 2: we don't have a restriction for A in position 2? Only that it is not in position 3.

 So, I'll go with ""RADIO"".

 But note: we are using D. We don't know about D. It might be common or not.

 Alternatively, we could use ""ROAST"" if we were allowed to put A in a new position? But we cannot put A in position 3.

 How about ""RALLY""? 
   R(1), A(2), L(3), L(4), Y(5) -> but we have two L's. And we don't know if the word has two L's. Also, we are not testing as many new letters.

 I think ""RADIO"" is better.

 Let me search for a word that has R, A, T, O, I? 

 How about ""RATIO"" (which is the same as ""RADIO"" but rearranged). 
   R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5)

 This is a valid word and tests T, I, O.

 I think ""RATIO"" is slightly better because it has T and I (which are very common) and O.

 So, I'll go with ""RATIO"".

 But wait: in ""RATIO"", we are putting A in position 2 and R in position 1. 

 We know that R is in the word but not in position 2. We are now testing R in position 1. 
 If it's correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus.

 Similarly, A in position 2: we don't have a restriction for A in position 2, so we can test it.

 Therefore, I choose ""RATIO"".

 But note: we are using R and A again. That's okay.

 So, second guess: ""RATIO""

<guess>ratio</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, N, E** are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **R** is present but not in position 2 (marked ""-"").
- **A** is present but not in position 3 (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **R** and **A** (since they are confirmed present).
- Avoid **C, N, E** (absent letters).
- Test new common letters (e.g., **T, I, O**) to gather more information.
- **R** cannot be in position 2, and **A** cannot be in position 3.

The word **""RATIO""** fits these criteria:
- **R** is in position 1 (new position, not 2).
- **A** is in position 2 (new position, not 3).
- Introduces **T, I, O** (common letters not yet tested).
- Valid 5-letter word, avoiding forbidden letters.

This guess efficiently tests new positions for known letters and explores additional common letters.",Guess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(x),FAIL

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 04 Sep 2025

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not the second letter, and A is not the third letter.
 - The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

 We also know that the secret word is 5 letters long.

 We need to make a second guess that:
 - Does not use C, N, E (since they are absent)
 - Includes R and A (but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively)
 - We can try to use other common letters to get more information.

 Since R and A are in the word, we should try to place them in different positions.

 Let's think of a word that:
 - Has R and A, but R not in position 2 and A not in position 3.
 - Avoids C, N, E.

 Also, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Common consonants: S, T, L, etc.
 Vowels: We already have A, so we might try O or I.

 Let's try to form a word that has R and A, and also includes other common letters.

 Possibilities: 
 - We can try to put R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2)
 - We can try to put A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3)

 Since we have two letters that are present (R and A), we can try to use them in new positions and add three new letters.

 Let's consider the word ""ROAST"", but note that we have to avoid the positions we know:
 - R in ""ROAST"" is in position 1 -> that's allowed (since we only know it's not in position 2)
 - O is new
 - A is in position 2 -> but we don't have a restriction on A for position 2? Our restriction for A is that it cannot be in position 3. So position 2 is allowed for A.
 - S and T are new.

 However, we must note that the feedback for ""crane"" told us that R is in the word but not in position 2, and A is in the word but not in position 3. It doesn't say anything about other positions.

 But wait: in ""ROAST"", A is in position 2. We don't have any feedback that A cannot be in position 2. So that's okay.

 However, we must also consider that the word must be valid.

 But note: we have to avoid using C, N, E. ""ROAST"" doesn't have these, so it's okay.

 Let me check: R, O, A, S, T.

 But we have two known letters: R and A. We are including them. The new letters are O, S, T.

 This seems like a good candidate because it tests three new letters.

 Alternatively, we could try ""PARTY"", but that has T and Y. However, we don't know about T and Y.

 Another idea: ""RAISE"" -> but we have to avoid E? Actually, E is absent, so we cannot use E. So ""RAISE"" has E -> not allowed.

 How about ""RADIO""? 
 - R in position 1 -> allowed.
 - A in position 2 -> allowed (since we only know A isn't in position 3).
 - But we have D, I, O. And we avoid C, N, E.

 However, we are introducing three new letters: D, I, O.

 But note: we have two known letters (R and A) and three new ones. That's efficient.

 Another candidate: ""STARK"" -> but we don't have A in this word? We must include A because we know it's in the word. So we have to include A.

 So, we must have a word that includes R and A.

 Let me list a few words that include R and A, and avoid C, N, E:

 - ROAST: R, O, A, S, T -> positions: R(1), O(2), A(3), S(4), T(5)
   But note: in the first guess, A was in position 3 and we were told it's in the word but wrong position. 
   Now we are putting A in position 3 again? That would be the same position. We know A is not in position 3, so we cannot put A in position 3 again.

   So we must avoid putting A in position 3.

   In ""ROAST"", A is in position 3 -> not allowed.

 - How about ""RATIO""? 
   R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5). 
   Here, A is in position 2 -> allowed.

 - ""RADIO"": R(1), A(2), D(3), I(4), O(5) -> A in position 2 -> allowed.

 - ""ARTSY"": but A is in position 1 -> allowed, but the word has Y and S, and we don't know about them. Also, we have to avoid E? It doesn't have E.

 But note: we have to use valid words. ""ARTSY"" is valid? It's a word (meaning artistic). But let's see if we can get more common words.

 Another: ""PARTY"": P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), Y(5) -> A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 3 (allowed, because we only know it's not in position 2).

 But we have to avoid C, N, E. ""PARTY"" doesn't have these.

 However, we have two known letters (A and R) and we are putting R in position 3 and A in position 2. That's acceptable.

 But note: we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let me compare:

 Option 1: ""RADIO"" -> letters: R, A, D, I, O. We test D, I, O.
 Option 2: ""PARTY"" -> letters: P, A, R, T, Y. We test P, T, Y.
 Option 3: ""ROAST"" is invalid because A is in position 3.

 Another word: ""RAILS"" -> R(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), S(5). 
   A is in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed). We test I, L, S.

 But note: we have to avoid using the same letter twice? We are using R and A only once.

 We want to maximize new letters. Also, we want to cover common letters.

 Let's think about frequencies: 
   In English, S, T, L, O, I are common.

 So, ""RAILS"" uses R, A, I, L, S -> that's five new letters? Actually, we are using R and A, but we are testing three new ones.

 Alternatively, ""RADIO"" uses R, A, D, I, O -> testing D, I, O.

 ""PARTY"": P, A, R, T, Y -> testing P, T, Y.

 The most common letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. But we know E, N, C are absent. So we should test I, O, T, S, L.

 So, a word that includes R and A and tests I, O, T, S, L? That would be ideal.

 How about ""RASPY""? 
   R(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5). 
   A is in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed). We test S, P, Y.

 But we are missing O, I, T.

 Another: ""TRAIL"" -> T(1), R(2) -> wait, R is in position 2? But we know R is not in position 2? 
   Actually, the feedback for the first guess: R was in position 2 and we got a '-' meaning it is in the word but not in that position. 
   So we cannot put R in position 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it's not there. 
   So we should avoid putting R in position 2.

 In ""TRAIL"", R is in position 2 -> not allowed.

 How about ""STARK""? But we don't have A. We must include A.

 How about ""ARTSY""? A(1), R(2) -> R in position 2 is not allowed.

 How about ""RALLY""? 
   R(1), A(2), L(3), L(4), Y(5) -> but we have two L's? And we don't know if L is in the word. Also, we are repeating L? 
   But the word ""RALLY"" has two L's. We don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. But to maximize information, we might avoid repeats.

 Alternatively, ""RAILS"" (as I thought earlier) is without repeats and covers I, L, S.

 Another: ""RAPID"": R(1), A(2), P(3), I(4), D(5) -> A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed). We test P, I, D.

 But we are missing S, T, L.

 How about ""ROTLS""? Not a word.

 After considering, I think ""RAILS"" is a good candidate:
   R in position 1 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed), then I, L, S.

 But note: we have to make sure we don't use any of the absent letters (C, N, E). ""RAILS"" is clean.

 How about ""SPRAY"": 
   S(1), P(2), R(3), A(4), Y(5). 
   Here, R is in position 3 (allowed) and A is in position 4 (allowed, because we only know it's not in position 3). 
   We test S, P, Y.

 But we are not using the fact that we know A is in the word. We are using A.

 However, we are not using R in a new position? We are using R in position 3, which is new.

   O(1), R(2) -> wait, R in position 2 is not allowed.

 How about ""ROBIN"": 
   R(1), O(2), B(3), I(4), N(5) -> but N is absent! We cannot use N.

 How about ""ROBIA""? Not a common word.

 How about ""RADIO"" (which we considered earlier) -> R(1), A(2), D(3), I(4), O(5). 
   This has A in position 2 (allowed) and R in position 1 (allowed). We test D, I, O.

 This seems good.

 But note: we are using R in position 1 and A in position 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Alternatively, we could try to put R in position 4 or 5? 

 For example, ""PLAIN"": 
   P(1), L(2), A(3) -> but A in position 3 is not allowed (we know A is not in position 3). So invalid.

 How about ""PARIS"": 
   P(1), A(2), R(3), I(4), S(5). 
   A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 3 (allowed). We test P, I, S.

 This is also a candidate.

 Now, which one to choose? 

 We want to test as many common letters as possible and avoid repeating known positions for R and A.

 Let me list the positions we are using for R and A in our candidates:

 - ""RADIO"": R(1), A(2)
 - ""PARTY"": P(1), A(2), R(3) -> note: R is in position 3 (which is new) and A in position 2 (new position for A).
 - ""RAILS"": R(1), A(2), then I(3), L(4), S(5) -> R in 1, A in 2, then I, L, S.

 The word ""PARTY"" uses the same positions for R and A as ""RADIO"" but then we test P, T, Y. 

 Since we have two letters that we know are in the word, we might want to try to place them in positions we haven't tried. 
 In the first guess, we had R in position 2 and A in position 3. Now we are trying A in position 2 and R in position 1 (in ""RADIO"") or in position 3 (in ""PARTY"").

 We don't have any information about position 1, so trying R in position 1 is a new position.

 Similarly, for A: we tried position 3 and now we try position 2.

 I think ""RADIO"" is a good choice because it tests three new vowels and consonants.

 But note: the secret word might not have O, I, D. We are testing them.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that uses more common consonants like S, T, L.

 How about ""STAIR"": 
   S(1), T(2), A(3) -> but A in position 3 is not allowed.

 How about ""TRAIL"": 
   T(1), R(2) -> R in position 2 is not allowed.

 How about ""RATIO"": 
   R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5) -> A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed). We test T, I, O.

 This is similar to ""RADIO"" but instead of D, we test T, I, O.

 ""RATIO"" is a valid word.

 Now, between ""RADIO"", ""RATIO"", ""PARTY"", and ""RAILS"", which one?

 We want to cover more common letters. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. 
 Since E, N, C are out, we can try T, O, I, S, L.

 ""RATIO"" has T, I, O -> that's three common letters.

 ""PARTY"" has P, T, Y -> Y is less common.

 ""RAILS"" has I, L, S -> that's three common letters.

 But note: in ""RAILS"", we are using R in position 1 and A in position 2. Then we have I, L, S in positions 3,4,5.

 In ""RATIO"", we have R in 1, A in 2, then T, I, O.

 I think ""RATIO"" is a good choice because it tests T, I, O which are very common.

 But wait: we have to avoid using letters we know are absent? We know C, N, E are absent, so ""RATIO"" is safe.

 Alternatively, we could try ""ROAST"" but we cannot because A would be in position 3 (which is forbidden).

 Another candidate: ""RASPY"" -> R(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5). 
   We test S, P, Y.

 But we are missing O and I.

 I think ""RATIO"" is a solid choice.

 However, note that the word ""RADIO"" is also good because it tests O and I.

 But let me check: the word ""RADIO"" is valid.

 Since we have two vowels already (A and we don't have any other vowels known), testing O and I is good.

 So, I'll go with ""RADIO"".

 But wait: what about the position of R? We know R is in the word but not in position 2. We are now putting R in position 1. 
 If the secret word has R in position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or an x? 

 Similarly, A in position 2: if it's correct, we get a check; if not, we get a minus or x? But we know A is in the word, so it won't be x.

 So, let's choose ""RADIO"".

 But note: we are using R and A again. That's okay because we are trying to find their correct positions.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't reuse R and A? But we have to include them because we know they are in the word. 

 Actually, we must include them because we are trying to get more information about their positions.

 So, I'll go with ""RADIO"".

 However, let me think of a word that uses R and A and also includes T, O, I? But we can't have all three? 

 How about ""TRAIL""? We can't because R must be included and we can't put R in position 2.

 Another: ""ARTIS"" -> not a word.

 I think ""RADIO"" is a good choice.

 But wait: what about ""RAINS""? 
   R(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), S(5) -> but N is absent! We cannot use N.

 So, we must avoid N.

 Therefore, ""RADIO"" is valid.

 Let me confirm: 
   R in position 1: we don't know if that's allowed? It is, because we only know R is not in position 2.
   A in position 2: we don't have a restriction for A in position 2? Only that it is not in position 3.

 So, I'll go with ""RADIO"".

 But note: we are using D. We don't know about D. It might be common or not.

 Alternatively, we could use ""ROAST"" if we were allowed to put A in a new position? But we cannot put A in position 3.

 How about ""RALLY""? 
   R(1), A(2), L(3), L(4), Y(5) -> but we have two L's. And we don't know if the word has two L's. Also, we are not testing as many new letters.

 I think ""RADIO"" is better.

 Let me search for a word that has R, A, T, O, I? 

 How about ""RATIO"" (which is the same as ""RADIO"" but rearranged). 
   R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5)

 This is a valid word and tests T, I, O.

 I think ""RATIO"" is slightly better because it has T and I (which are very common) and O.

 So, I'll go with ""RATIO"".

 But wait: in ""RATIO"", we are putting A in position 2 and R in position 1. 

 We know that R is in the word but not in position 2. We are now testing R in position 1. 
 If it's correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus.

 Similarly, A in position 2: we don't have a restriction for A in position 2, so we can test it.

 Therefore, I choose ""RATIO"".

 But note: we are using R and A again. That's okay.

 So, second guess: ""RATIO""

<guess>ratio</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, N, E** are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **R** is present but not in position 2 (marked ""-"").
- **A** is present but not in position 3 (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **R** and **A** (since they are confirmed present).
- Avoid **C, N, E** (absent letters).
- Test new common letters (e.g., **T, I, O**) to gather more information.
- **R** cannot be in position 2, and **A** cannot be in position 3.

The word **""RATIO""** fits these criteria:
- **R** is in position 1 (new position, not 2).
- **A** is in position 2 (new position, not 3).
- Introduces **T, I, O** (common letters not yet tested).
- Valid 5-letter word, avoiding forbidden letters.

This guess efficiently tests new positions for known letters and explores additional common letters.

So we have to include A.\n\n So, we must have a word that includes R and A.\n\n Let me list a few words that include R and A, and avoid C, N, E:\n\n - ROAST: R, O, A, S, T -> positions: R(1), O(2), A(3), S(4), T(5)\n   But note: in the first guess, A was in position 3 and we were told it\'s in the word but wrong position. \n   Now we are putting A in position 3 again?

But let\'s see if we can get more common words.\n\n Another: ""PARTY"": P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), Y(5) -> A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 3 (allowed, because we only know it\'s not in position 2).\n\n But we have to avoid C, N, E. ""PARTY"" doesn\'t have these.\n\n However, we have two known letters (A and R) and we are putting R in position 3 and A in position 2. That\'s acceptable.\n\n But note: we also want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n Let me compare:\n\n Option 1: ""RADIO"" -> letters: R, A, D, I, O. We test D, I, O.\n Option 2: ""PARTY"" -> letters: P, A, R, T, Y. We test P, T, Y.\n Option 3: ""ROAST"" is invalid because A is in position 3.\n\n Another word: ""RAILS"" -> R(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), S(5). \n   A is in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed). We test I, L, S.\n\n But note: we have to avoid using the same letter twice? We are using R and A only once.\n\n We want to maximize new letters. Also, we want to cover common letters.\n\n Let\'s think about frequencies: \n   In English, S, T, L, O, I are common.\n\n So, ""RAILS"" uses R, A, I, L, S -> that\'s five new letters? Actually, we are using R and A, but we are testing three new ones.\n\n Alternatively, ""RADIO"" uses R, A, D, I, O -> testing D, I, O.\n\n ""PARTY"": P, A, R, T, Y -> testing P, T, Y.\n\n The most common letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. But we know E, N, C are absent. So we should test I, O, T, S, L.\n\n So, a word that includes R and A and tests I, O, T, S, L? That would be ideal.\n\n How about ""RASPY""? \n   R(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5). \n   A is in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed). We test S, P, Y.\n\n But we are missing O, I, T.\n\n Another: ""TRAIL"" -> T(1), R(2) -> wait, R is in position 2? But we know R is not in position 2? \n   Actually, the feedback for the first guess: R was in position 2 and we got a \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not in that position. \n   So we cannot put R in position 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it\'s not there. \n   So we should avoid putting R in position 2.\n\n In ""TRAIL"", R is in position 2 -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""STARK""? But we don\'t have A. We must include A.\n\n How about ""ARTSY""? A(1), R(2) -> R in position 2 is not allowed.\n\n How about ""RALLY""? \n   R(1), A(2), L(3), L(4), Y(5) -> but we have two L\'s? And we don\'t know if L is in the word. Also, we are repeating L? \n   But the word ""RALLY"" has two L\'s. We don\'t know if the secret word has repeated letters. But to maximize information, we might avoid repeats.\n\n Alternatively, ""RAILS"" (as I thought earlier) is without repeats and covers I, L, S.\n\n Another: ""RAPID"": R(1), A(2), P(3), I(4), D(5) -> A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed). We test P, I, D.\n\n But we are missing S, T, L.\n\n How about ""ROTLS""? Not a word.\n\n After considering, I think ""RAILS"" is a good candidate:\n   R in position 1 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed), then I, L, S.\n\n But note: we have to make sure we don\'t use any of the absent letters (C, N, E). ""RAILS"" is clean.\n\n However, we have to consider that the secret word might have the letter in a different position. We are testing R in position 1 and A in position 2.\n\n Alternatively, we could try to put R in a different position, say position 4 or 5? \n\n For example, ""PLANT"" has N and we know N is absent. So invalid.\n\n How about ""SPRAY"": \n   S(1), P(2), R(3), A(4), Y(5). \n   Here, R is in position 3 (allowed) and A is in position 4 (allowed, because we only know it\'s not in position 3). \n   We test S, P, Y.\n\n But we are not using the fact that we know A is in the word. We are using A.\n\n However, we are not using R in a new position? We are using R in position 3, which is new.\n\n But note: we have two known letters (R and A) and we are using them. Also, we are testing S, P, Y.\n\n But we are missing the opportunity to test more vowels? We already have A, and we know E is absent. So we might test O or I.\n\n Since we have two vowels already (A and ? we don\'t know), we might want to test O or I.\n\n Let me try to form a word that has R, A, and also O and I? \n\n How about ""ORBIT""? \n   O(1), R(2) -> wait, R in position 2 is not allowed.\n\n How about ""ROBIN"": \n   R(1), O(2), B(3), I(4), N(5) -> but N is absent! We cannot use N.\n\n How about ""ROBIA""? Not a common word.\n\n How about ""RADIO"" (which we considered earlier) -> R(1), A(2), D(3), I(4), O(5). \n   This has A in position 2 (allowed) and R in position 1 (allowed). We test D, I, O.\n\n This seems good.\n\n But note: we are using R in position 1 and A in position 2. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\n Alternatively, we could try to put R in position 4 or 5? \n\n For example, ""PLAIN"": \n   P(1), L(2), A(3) -> but A in position 3 is not allowed (we know A is not in position 3). So invalid.\n\n How about ""PARIS"": \n   P(1), A(2), R(3), I(4), S(5). \n   A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 3 (allowed). We test P, I, S.\n\n This is also a candidate.\n\n Now, which one to choose? \n\n We want to test as many common letters as possible and avoid repeating known positions for R and A.\n\n Let me list the positions we are using for R and A in our candidates:\n\n - ""RADIO"": R(1), A(2)\n - ""PARTY"": P(1), A(2), R(3) -> note: R is in position 3 (which is new) and A in position 2 (new position for A).\n - ""RAILS"": R(1), A(2), then I(3), L(4), S(5) -> R in 1, A in 2, then I, L, S.\n\n The word ""PARTY"" uses the same positions for R and A as ""RADIO"" but then we test P, T, Y. \n\n Since we have two letters that we know are in the word, we might want to try to place them in positions we haven\'t tried. \n In the first guess, we had R in position 2 and A in position 3.

If not, we get a minus.\n\n Similarly, A in position 2: we don\'t have a restriction for A in position 2, so we can test it.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""RATIO"".\n\n But note: we are using R and A again. That\'s okay.\n\n So, second guess: ""RATIO""\n\n<guess>ratio</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C, N, E** are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- **R** is present but not in position 2 (marked ""-"").\n- **A** is present but not in position 3 (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **R** and **A** (since they are confirmed present).\n- Avoid **C, N, E** (absent letters).\n- Test new common letters (e.g., **T, I, O**) to gather more information.\n- **R** cannot be in position 2, and **A** cannot be in position 3.\n\nThe word **""RATIO""** fits these criteria:\n- **R** is in position 1 (new position, not 2).\n- **A** is in position 2 (new position, not 3).\n- Introduces **T, I, O** (common letters not yet tested).\n- Valid 5-letter word, avoiding forbidden letters.\n\nThis guess efficiently tests new positions for known letters and explores additional common letters.\n\n<guess>ratio</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (absent)
- R: - (present, but not in position 2)
- A: - (present, but not in position 3)
- N: x (absent)
- E: x (absent)

Guess 2: ""ratio""
- R: - (present, but not in position 1)  [since we got '-' for R in position 1]
- A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)      [we got '✓' for A in position 2]
- T: x (absent)
- I: x (absent)
- O: x (absent)

So, from this, we know:

1. The secret word has the letter 'A' in position 2. (because we got a check for A in position 2 in ""ratio"")
2. The letter 'R' is present, but not in position 1 (from ""ratio"") and not in position 2 (from ""crane""). So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
3. The following letters are absent: C, N, E, T, I, O.

Also, from ""crane"", we know that A is not in position 3 (but now we know it's in position 2, so that's consistent).

Now, the secret word has the form: _ A _ _ _

And the letters we know are present: R (in position 3,4, or 5) and (we don't know about duplicates, but so far no duplicates).

We also know the absent letters: C, N, E, T, I, O.

We need to make a third guess that:
- Has 'A' in position 2 (fixed)
- Includes 'R' in one of the positions 3,4,5 (but not 1 or 2)
- Avoids the absent letters: C, N, E, T, I, O
- We can use other common letters to test.

Since we know A is in position 2, we can fix that.

Let's think of words that have the form: _ A _ _ _ and contain the letter R in position 3,4, or 5.

We also want to test other common letters that we haven't tried yet. The remaining common letters include: S, L, U, D, M, P, B, G, etc.

Let's try to form a word:

Option 1: R in position 3: _ A R _ _
We need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth positions with letters that are not in the absent list and form a valid word.

Possible letters: We can use B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Example: ""BARMY"" -> B(1), A(2), R(3), M(4), Y(5). But we don't know about B, M, Y.

But we need to test more letters. However, we must include R in position 3.

Another: ""PARKS"": P(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5). This tests P, K, S.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""PARKS"" uses P, A, R, K, S. None of these are in the absent list (C,N,E,T,I,O). So it's valid.

Option 2: R in position 4: _ A _ R _
Example: ""FAIRY"" -> but we have I and Y? I is absent, so invalid. 
""HAIRY"" -> same issue, I is absent.
""LAIRD"": L(1), A(2), I(3) -> I is absent, invalid.
""MARRY"": M(1), A(2), R(3) -> wait, R is in position 3, not 4. 
We need R in position 4: so _ A _ R _

Another: ""BASER"" -> but E is absent, invalid.
""PAPER"" -> E absent, invalid.
""SAVOR"" -> S(1), A(2), V(3), O(4), R(5) -> but O is absent and R is in position 5, not 4. 
We need R in position 4: so the word must have R in the fourth position.

How about ""LAPSE"": but E and S? E is absent, so invalid.
""MAPLE"": E absent, invalid.

It's hard to find a word with R in position 4 without using absent letters. 

Option 3: R in position 5: _ A _ _ R
Example: ""BAKER"": E absent, invalid.
""MAKER"": E absent, invalid.
""FILER"": I and E absent, invalid.
""HALMR"": not a word.

This is difficult. So maybe R in position 3 or 4 is easier.

Let me try R in position 3: _ A R _ _

We need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth positions.

Possible words:
- ""BARMY"": B(1), A(2), R(3), M(4), Y(5) -> tests B, M, Y
- ""CARDS"": but C is absent, invalid.
- ""PARKS"": P(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5) -> tests P, K, S
- ""MARKS"": M(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5) -> tests M, K, S
- ""BARKS"": B(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5) -> tests B, K, S

All these are valid and use only allowed letters.

We also have the option to test more vowels? But we know the word has A, and we don't have any other vowels known (since E,I,O are absent, and we have A). So we might test U? But we don't know if U is in the word.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we need to be efficient.

We can also consider words that don't have R in position 3? But we know R must be in 3,4, or 5. Since position 4 and 5 are harder, let's stick with position 3.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test common letters and maximize information.

We haven't tested: S, L, D, U, P, M, B, G, etc.

""PARKS"" tests P, K, S.
""BARKS"" tests B, K, S.
""MARKS"" tests M, K, S.

The letter S is common, so testing S is good. K is less common, but we have to use it because we are trying to place R.

But note: we are not sure if the word has S or not. We are testing it.

Alternatively, we could try a word that uses a different set of letters to cover more ground.

But we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

Another idea: we know the word has R and A. We have A fixed at position 2. So the word is ?A??

We can try to use a word that has R in position 4 or 5, but we had trouble finding valid words without absent letters.

Let me try R in position 4 again: 
- _ A _ R _
We need a word: 
  First letter: not C,N,E,T,I,O -> so we can use B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.
  Fourth letter: R
  Fifth letter: not absent.

Example: ""BALMY"": B(1), A(2), L(3), M(4), Y(5) -> but this doesn't have R? We need R in position 4. 
""BALMY"" has M in position 4, not R.

How about ""SALAD"": but two A's? And D. But we have A in position 2 and then again? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are avoiding E? ""SALAD"" has two A's and D. But we don't know about duplicates. Also, we have to avoid E? It doesn't have E, but it has A twice and D. 

But we are not sure if the word has two A's. We know at least one A is in position 2. It might have another A? But we don't know.

We can try, but let's avoid duplicates for now to get more information.

Another word: ""PALER"": but E is absent, invalid.
""MANOR"": M(1), A(2), N(3) -> N is absent! Invalid.
""FAVOR"": F(1), A(2), V(3), O(4), R(5) -> but O is absent and R is in position 5, not 4. 
We need R in position 4: so the fourth letter must be R.

How about ""LAPSE"": but E is absent.

This is difficult. So maybe R in position 5 is easier?

But we already have a candidate for R in position 5: ""BAKER"" is invalid because of E. 

""MAKER"": same.

""FILER"": invalid.

""HALMR"": not a word.

So perhaps R is more likely in position 3? 

Let me think of common words: 
- ""PARIS"": but we have I? I is absent, and also we have I in position 4? But I is absent, so invalid.
- ""BARON"": O is absent, invalid.

Another: ""CARDS"": C absent, invalid.

So, let's stick with R in position 3.

Now, among the candidates: ""BARKS"", ""PARKS"", ""MARKS"", ""BARMY"", etc.

We want to test letters that are more common. S is very common, so we can test a word that includes S.

We also have L, which is common.

How about ""BARKS"": B(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5). 
This tests B, K, S.

But we have to consider that the word might have B, K, S.

Alternatively, we can try ""LARGE"": but E is absent and also G? But E is absent.

How about ""MARSH"": M(1), A(2), R(3), S(4), H(5). 
This tests M, S, H.

But we don't know about H.

Another: ""PARKS"" is similar but with P instead of M.

We can also consider ""R"" in position 4? But we couldn't find a word. 

What about ""GAUZE"": but E and Z? E is absent, invalid.

I think we have to choose from the words we have.

But note: we have another piece of information. In the first guess, we had R in position 2 (which was wrong) and in the second guess we had R in position 1 (which was wrong). Now we are trying R in position 3.

We also know that A is in position 2.

So, let's list the possibilities for the secret word:

Position 1: cannot be C,N,E,T,I,O,C,N,E,T,I,O -> so we can use B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.
Position 2: A (fixed)
Position 3: could be R? or another letter? But we know R is in the word and not in 1 or 2, so 3,4,5.
Position 4 and 5: similarly.

We need to test the position of R and also test new letters.

We have 3 positions to fill: 1, 3,4,5? Actually, position 2 is fixed as A, so we have positions 1,3,4,5 to fill with letters that include R (in 3,4,5) and two more letters? Because we have 5 letters: position1,2,3,4,5 -> we know 2 is A, so we need to test the other positions.

We know the word has R and A. So the other three positions must be filled with letters that are not in the absent list.

We are going to test multiple new letters.

I think ""PARKS"" is a good choice: it tests P, K, S. K is less common, but S is very common.

Alternatively, ""BARKS"" tests B, K, S.

Or ""MARSH"" tests M, S, H.

How about ""LARGE""? But E is absent.

Another word: ""DARKY"": D(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), Y(5). 
This tests D, K, Y.

But Y is less common.

I think ""PARKS"" is a solid choice.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have S. We haven't tested S yet.

So, let's go with ""PARKS"".

But wait: we are putting R in position 3. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't have R in position 3? But we don't have many options.

Another candidate: ""FARCE"": but C and E absent, invalid.

How about ""HARPY"": H(1), A(2), R(3), P(4), Y(5). 
This tests H, P, Y.

But we are missing S.

I think ""PARKS"" is better than ""HARPY"" because S is more common.

But let me see: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""PARKS"" uses P, A, R, K, S. All are allowed.

So, I'll go with ""PARKS"".

But note: we are using K. If the word has K, we'll know. Similarly, P and S.

We might also consider ""BARMY"", but Y is less common.

Another word: ""GARDE"": but E is absent.

I think ""PARKS"" is a valid choice.

But wait: what about the possibility that R is in position 4? We didn't find a word, but maybe there is one.

How about ""WASPY"": W(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5) -> but this doesn't have R? We must include R because we know it's in the word. So we have to include R.

So, we must have R in position 3,4, or 5.

Another word with R in position 4: 
- ""BAJRA""? Not common.
- ""MAJAR"": not common.

How about ""SABER"": but E is absent.

I think we have to go with R in position 3.

So, I choose ""PARKS"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not repeating a position that we know is wrong for R? We are putting R in position 3. We don't have any feedback that position 3 is wrong for R? We only know that position 1 and 2 are wrong for R.

So, let's go with ""PARKS"".

But wait: what about the letter K? We don't know about K. It might be common or not.

Alternatively, we could try a word that uses L, which is very common. 

How about ""LARGE"": but E is absent.

How about ""LARKS"": L(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5). 
This tests L, K, S.

Or ""WARKS"": not common.

I think ""PARKS"" is acceptable.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""PARKS"" is P-A-R-K-S. 
P: not absent? We haven't tested P. 
K: not tested.
S: not tested.

So, let's use ""PARKS"".

But wait: what about the possibility that the word has duplicate letters? We don't have any indication, so we can ignore for now.

Another candidate: ""BARGE"": but E is absent.

I think we have to go with it.

But note: we have to consider that the word might be ""PARIS"", but I is absent and also we have I in position 4? No, ""PARIS"" has I and O? O is absent.

So, let's finalizes: ""PARKS""

But wait, what about ""R"" in position 3? We are using R in position 3. If the secret word has R in position 3, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and then we know R must be in position 4 or 5.

So, let's do it.

Guess: ""PARKS""

But note: we are putting R in position 3. We don't have any feedback that position 3 is wrong for R? Actually, we only know that position 1 and 2 are wrong for R. Position 3 might be correct.

So, we are testing position 3 for R.

If we get a check for R, then we know R is in position 3. If we get a minus, then R is in position 4 or 5.

Similarly, we test P, K, S.

So, it's a good test.

Therefore, I choose ""PARKS"".

But let me check if there's a word that tests more common letters. 

Another idea: ""SARIS"": S(1), A(2), R(3), I(4) -> I is absent, invalid.

""SAVOR"": O absent.

I think ""PARKS"" is fine.

So, the guess is ""PARKS"".

But note: we are using K. If we don't want to use K, we could try ""BARKS"" (B instead of P). But P is more common than B? In wordle, P is common.

Actually, in wordle, S is the most common, then L, then ... then K, then P, etc.

But we are testing S at the end, which is common.

So, I'll go with ""PARKS"".

But wait: what about ""R"" in position 3? We are testing it.

So, let's output ""PARKS"".

But note: we have to make sure we don't use absent letters. ""PARKS"" has P, A, R, K, S. None of these are in the absent list (C,N,E,T,I,O).

So, it's valid.

Therefore, the third guess is ""PARKS"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R and A are present but not in positions 2 or 3, respectively. C, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""ratio"")**: A is correct in position 2 (✓). R is present but not in position 1 (-). T, I, O are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. **A is fixed in position 2** (from ""ratio"" feedback: ✓).
2. **R is present** but cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from both guesses). It must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
3. **Absent letters**: C, N, E, T, I, O (cannot be used).
4. **Unknown positions**: 1, 3, 4, 5 need to be solved, with R one of them (in 3,4, or 5).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Must include R** in position 3, 4, or 5 (since positions 1 and 2 are invalid for R).
- **A must be in position 2** (fixed).
- **Avoid absent letters** (C, N, E, T, I, O).
- Test new common letters (e.g., S, L, P, M) to gather more information.
- Prioritize words with R in position 3 (as position 4/5 is harder to form valid words without absent letters).

The word **""PARKS""** fits perfectly:
- **P** (new letter, tests position 1)
- **A** (fixed in position 2)
- **R** (placed in position 3 to test if it's correct)
- **K** (new letter, tests position 4)
- **S** (new letter, tests position 5)

This guess:
- Tests R in position 3 (if correct, we get ✓; if not, we learn R is in 4/5).
- Tests three new common letters (P, K, S).
- Avoids all absent letters.

<guess>parks</guess>",parks,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (absent)
- R: - (present, but not in position 2)
- A: - (present, but not in position 3)
- N: x (absent)
- E: x (absent)

Guess 2: ""ratio""
- R: - (present, but not in position 1)  [since we got '-' for R in position 1]
- A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)      [we got '✓' for A in position 2]
- T: x (absent)
- I: x (absent)
- O: x (absent)

So, from this, we know:

1. The secret word has the letter 'A' in position 2. (because we got a check for A in position 2 in ""ratio"")
2. The letter 'R' is present, but not in position 1 (from ""ratio"") and not in position 2 (from ""crane""). So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
3. The following letters are absent: C, N, E, T, I, O.

Also, from ""crane"", we know that A is not in position 3 (but now we know it's in position 2, so that's consistent).

Now, the secret word has the form: _ A _ _ _

And the letters we know are present: R (in position 3,4, or 5) and (we don't know about duplicates, but so far no duplicates).

We also know the absent letters: C, N, E, T, I, O.

We need to make a third guess that:
- Has 'A' in position 2 (fixed)
- Includes 'R' in one of the positions 3,4,5 (but not 1 or 2)
- Avoids the absent letters: C, N, E, T, I, O
- We can use other common letters to test.

Since we know A is in position 2, we can fix that.

Let's think of words that have the form: _ A _ _ _ and contain the letter R in position 3,4, or 5.

We also want to test other common letters that we haven't tried yet. The remaining common letters include: S, L, U, D, M, P, B, G, etc.

Let's try to form a word:

Option 1: R in position 3: _ A R _ _
We need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth positions with letters that are not in the absent list and form a valid word.

Possible letters: We can use B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Example: ""BARMY"" -> B(1), A(2), R(3), M(4), Y(5). But we don't know about B, M, Y.

But we need to test more letters. However, we must include R in position 3.

Another: ""PARKS"": P(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5). This tests P, K, S.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""PARKS"" uses P, A, R, K, S. None of these are in the absent list (C,N,E,T,I,O). So it's valid.

Option 2: R in position 4: _ A _ R _
Example: ""FAIRY"" -> but we have I and Y? I is absent, so invalid. 
""HAIRY"" -> same issue, I is absent.
""LAIRD"": L(1), A(2), I(3) -> I is absent, invalid.
""MARRY"": M(1), A(2), R(3) -> wait, R is in position 3, not 4. 
We need R in position 4: so _ A _ R _

Another: ""BASER"" -> but E is absent, invalid.
""PAPER"" -> E absent, invalid.
""SAVOR"" -> S(1), A(2), V(3), O(4), R(5) -> but O is absent and R is in position 5, not 4. 
We need R in position 4: so the word must have R in the fourth position.

How about ""LAPSE"": but E and S? E is absent, so invalid.
""MAPLE"": E absent, invalid.

It's hard to find a word with R in position 4 without using absent letters. 

Option 3: R in position 5: _ A _ _ R
Example: ""BAKER"": E absent, invalid.
""MAKER"": E absent, invalid.
""FILER"": I and E absent, invalid.
""HALMR"": not a word.

This is difficult. So maybe R in position 3 or 4 is easier.

Let me try R in position 3: _ A R _ _

We need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth positions.

Possible words:
- ""BARMY"": B(1), A(2), R(3), M(4), Y(5) -> tests B, M, Y
- ""CARDS"": but C is absent, invalid.
- ""PARKS"": P(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5) -> tests P, K, S
- ""MARKS"": M(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5) -> tests M, K, S
- ""BARKS"": B(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5) -> tests B, K, S

All these are valid and use only allowed letters.

We also have the option to test more vowels? But we know the word has A, and we don't have any other vowels known (since E,I,O are absent, and we have A). So we might test U? But we don't know if U is in the word.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we need to be efficient.

We can also consider words that don't have R in position 3? But we know R must be in 3,4, or 5. Since position 4 and 5 are harder, let's stick with position 3.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test common letters and maximize information.

We haven't tested: S, L, D, U, P, M, B, G, etc.

""PARKS"" tests P, K, S.
""BARKS"" tests B, K, S.
""MARKS"" tests M, K, S.

The letter S is common, so testing S is good. K is less common, but we have to use it because we are trying to place R.

But note: we are not sure if the word has S or not. We are testing it.

Alternatively, we could try a word that uses a different set of letters to cover more ground.

But we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

Another idea: we know the word has R and A. We have A fixed at position 2. So the word is ?A??

We can try to use a word that has R in position 4 or 5, but we had trouble finding valid words without absent letters.

Let me try R in position 4 again: 
- _ A _ R _
We need a word: 
  First letter: not C,N,E,T,I,O -> so we can use B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.
  Fourth letter: R
  Fifth letter: not absent.

Example: ""BALMY"": B(1), A(2), L(3), M(4), Y(5) -> but this doesn't have R? We need R in position 4. 
""BALMY"" has M in position 4, not R.

How about ""SALAD"": but two A's? And D. But we have A in position 2 and then again? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are avoiding E? ""SALAD"" has two A's and D. But we don't know about duplicates. Also, we have to avoid E? It doesn't have E, but it has A twice and D. 

But we are not sure if the word has two A's. We know at least one A is in position 2. It might have another A? But we don't know.

We can try, but let's avoid duplicates for now to get more information.

Another word: ""PALER"": but E is absent, invalid.
""MANOR"": M(1), A(2), N(3) -> N is absent! Invalid.
""FAVOR"": F(1), A(2), V(3), O(4), R(5) -> but O is absent and R is in position 5, not 4. 
We need R in position 4: so the fourth letter must be R.

How about ""LAPSE"": but E is absent.

This is difficult. So maybe R in position 5 is easier?

But we already have a candidate for R in position 5: ""BAKER"" is invalid because of E. 

""MAKER"": same.

""FILER"": invalid.

""HALMR"": not a word.

So perhaps R is more likely in position 3? 

Let me think of common words: 
- ""PARIS"": but we have I? I is absent, and also we have I in position 4? But I is absent, so invalid.
- ""BARON"": O is absent, invalid.

Another: ""CARDS"": C absent, invalid.

So, let's stick with R in position 3.

Now, among the candidates: ""BARKS"", ""PARKS"", ""MARKS"", ""BARMY"", etc.

We want to test letters that are more common. S is very common, so we can test a word that includes S.

We also have L, which is common.

How about ""BARKS"": B(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5). 
This tests B, K, S.

But we have to consider that the word might have B, K, S.

Alternatively, we can try ""LARGE"": but E is absent and also G? But E is absent.

How about ""MARSH"": M(1), A(2), R(3), S(4), H(5). 
This tests M, S, H.

But we don't know about H.

Another: ""PARKS"" is similar but with P instead of M.

We can also consider ""R"" in position 4? But we couldn't find a word. 

What about ""GAUZE"": but E and Z? E is absent, invalid.

I think we have to choose from the words we have.

But note: we have another piece of information. In the first guess, we had R in position 2 (which was wrong) and in the second guess we had R in position 1 (which was wrong). Now we are trying R in position 3.

We also know that A is in position 2.

So, let's list the possibilities for the secret word:

Position 1: cannot be C,N,E,T,I,O,C,N,E,T,I,O -> so we can use B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.
Position 2: A (fixed)
Position 3: could be R? or another letter? But we know R is in the word and not in 1 or 2, so 3,4,5.
Position 4 and 5: similarly.

We need to test the position of R and also test new letters.

We have 3 positions to fill: 1, 3,4,5? Actually, position 2 is fixed as A, so we have positions 1,3,4,5 to fill with letters that include R (in 3,4,5) and two more letters? Because we have 5 letters: position1,2,3,4,5 -> we know 2 is A, so we need to test the other positions.

We know the word has R and A. So the other three positions must be filled with letters that are not in the absent list.

We are going to test multiple new letters.

I think ""PARKS"" is a good choice: it tests P, K, S. K is less common, but S is very common.

Alternatively, ""BARKS"" tests B, K, S.

Or ""MARSH"" tests M, S, H.

How about ""LARGE""? But E is absent.

Another word: ""DARKY"": D(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), Y(5). 
This tests D, K, Y.

But Y is less common.

I think ""PARKS"" is a solid choice.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have S. We haven't tested S yet.

So, let's go with ""PARKS"".

But wait: we are putting R in position 3. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't have R in position 3? But we don't have many options.

Another candidate: ""FARCE"": but C and E absent, invalid.

How about ""HARPY"": H(1), A(2), R(3), P(4), Y(5). 
This tests H, P, Y.

But we are missing S.

I think ""PARKS"" is better than ""HARPY"" because S is more common.

But let me see: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""PARKS"" uses P, A, R, K, S. All are allowed.

So, I'll go with ""PARKS"".

But note: we are using K. If the word has K, we'll know. Similarly, P and S.

We might also consider ""BARMY"", but Y is less common.

Another word: ""GARDE"": but E is absent.

I think ""PARKS"" is a valid choice.

But wait: what about the possibility that R is in position 4? We didn't find a word, but maybe there is one.

How about ""WASPY"": W(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5) -> but this doesn't have R? We must include R because we know it's in the word. So we have to include R.

So, we must have R in position 3,4, or 5.

Another word with R in position 4: 
- ""BAJRA""? Not common.
- ""MAJAR"": not common.

How about ""SABER"": but E is absent.

I think we have to go with R in position 3.

So, I choose ""PARKS"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not repeating a position that we know is wrong for R? We are putting R in position 3. We don't have any feedback that position 3 is wrong for R? We only know that position 1 and 2 are wrong for R.

So, let's go with ""PARKS"".

But wait: what about the letter K? We don't know about K. It might be common or not.

Alternatively, we could try a word that uses L, which is very common. 

How about ""LARGE"": but E is absent.

How about ""LARKS"": L(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5). 
This tests L, K, S.

Or ""WARKS"": not common.

I think ""PARKS"" is acceptable.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""PARKS"" is P-A-R-K-S. 
P: not absent? We haven't tested P. 
K: not tested.
S: not tested.

So, let's use ""PARKS"".

But wait: what about the possibility that the word has duplicate letters? We don't have any indication, so we can ignore for now.

Another candidate: ""BARGE"": but E is absent.

I think we have to go with it.

But note: we have to consider that the word might be ""PARIS"", but I is absent and also we have I in position 4? No, ""PARIS"" has I and O? O is absent.

So, let's finalizes: ""PARKS""

But wait, what about ""R"" in position 3? We are using R in position 3. If the secret word has R in position 3, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and then we know R must be in position 4 or 5.

So, let's do it.

Guess: ""PARKS""

But note: we are putting R in position 3. We don't have any feedback that position 3 is wrong for R? Actually, we only know that position 1 and 2 are wrong for R. Position 3 might be correct.

So, we are testing position 3 for R.

If we get a check for R, then we know R is in position 3. If we get a minus, then R is in position 4 or 5.

Similarly, we test P, K, S.

So, it's a good test.

Therefore, I choose ""PARKS"".

But let me check if there's a word that tests more common letters. 

Another idea: ""SARIS"": S(1), A(2), R(3), I(4) -> I is absent, invalid.

""SAVOR"": O absent.

I think ""PARKS"" is fine.

So, the guess is ""PARKS"".

But note: we are using K. If we don't want to use K, we could try ""BARKS"" (B instead of P). But P is more common than B? In wordle, P is common.

Actually, in wordle, S is the most common, then L, then ... then K, then P, etc.

But we are testing S at the end, which is common.

So, I'll go with ""PARKS"".

But wait: what about ""R"" in position 3? We are testing it.

So, let's output ""PARKS"".

But note: we have to make sure we don't use absent letters. ""PARKS"" has P, A, R, K, S. None of these are in the absent list (C,N,E,T,I,O).

So, it's valid.

Therefore, the third guess is ""PARKS"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R and A are present but not in positions 2 or 3, respectively. C, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""ratio"")**: A is correct in position 2 (✓). R is present but not in position 1 (-). T, I, O are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. **A is fixed in position 2** (from ""ratio"" feedback: ✓).
2. **R is present** but cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from both guesses). It must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
3. **Absent letters**: C, N, E, T, I, O (cannot be used).
4. **Unknown positions**: 1, 3, 4, 5 need to be solved, with R one of them (in 3,4, or 5).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Must include R** in position 3, 4, or 5 (since positions 1 and 2 are invalid for R).
- **A must be in position 2** (fixed).
- **Avoid absent letters** (C, N, E, T, I, O).
- Test new common letters (e.g., S, L, P, M) to gather more information.
- Prioritize words with R in position 3 (as position 4/5 is harder to form valid words without absent letters).

The word **""PARKS""** fits perfectly:
- **P** (new letter, tests position 1)
- **A** (fixed in position 2)
- **R** (placed in position 3 to test if it's correct)
- **K** (new letter, tests position 4)
- **S** (new letter, tests position 5)

This guess:
- Tests R in position 3 (if correct, we get ✓; if not, we learn R is in 4/5).
- Tests three new common letters (P, K, S).
- Avoids all absent letters.",Guess 3: parks -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) K(x) S(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not the second letter, and A is not the third letter.
 - The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

 We also know that the secret word is 5 letters long.

 We need to make a second guess that:
 - Does not use C, N, E (since they are absent)
 - Includes R and A (but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively)
 - We can try to use other common letters to get more information.

 Since R and A are in the word, we should try to place them in different positions.

 Let's think of a word that:
 - Has R and A, but R not in position 2 and A not in position 3.
 - Avoids C, N, E.

 Also, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Common consonants: S, T, L, etc.
 Vowels: We already have A, so we might try O or I.

 Let's try to form a word that has R and A, and also includes other common letters.

 Possibilities: 
 - We can try to put R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2)
 - We can try to put A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3)

 Since we have two letters that are present (R and A), we can try to use them in new positions and add three new letters.

 Let's consider the word ""ROAST"", but note that we have to avoid the positions we know:
 - R in ""ROAST"" is in position 1 -> that's allowed (since we only know it's not in position 2)
 - O is new
 - A is in position 2 -> but we don't have a restriction on A for position 2? Our restriction for A is that it cannot be in position 3. So position 2 is allowed for A.
 - S and T are new.

 However, we must note that the feedback for ""crane"" told us that R is in the word but not in position 2, and A is in the word but not in position 3. It doesn't say anything about other positions.

 But wait: in ""ROAST"", A is in position 2. We don't have any feedback that A cannot be in position 2. So that's okay.

 However, we must also consider that the word must be valid.

 But note: we have to avoid using C, N, E. ""ROAST"" doesn't have these, so it's okay.

 Let me check: R, O, A, S, T.

 But we have two known letters: R and A. We are including them. The new letters are O, S, T.

 This seems like a good candidate because it tests three new letters.

 Alternatively, we could try ""PARTY"", but that has T and Y. However, we don't know about T and Y.

 Another idea: ""RAISE"" -> but we have to avoid E? Actually, E is absent, so we cannot use E. So ""RAISE"" has E -> not allowed.

 How about ""RADIO""? 
 - R in position 1 -> allowed.
 - A in position 2 -> allowed (since we only know A isn't in position 3).
 - But we have D, I, O. And we avoid C, N, E.

 However, we are introducing three new letters: D, I, O.

 But note: we have two known letters (R and A) and three new ones. That's efficient.

 Another candidate: ""STARK"" -> but we don't have A in this word? We must include A because we know it's in the word. So we have to include A.

 So, we must have a word that includes R and A.

 Let me list a few words that include R and A, and avoid C, N, E:

 - ROAST: R, O, A, S, T -> positions: R(1), O(2), A(3), S(4), T(5)
   But note: in the first guess, A was in position 3 and we were told it's in the word but wrong position. 
   Now we are putting A in position 3 again? That would be the same position. We know A is not in position 3, so we cannot put A in position 3 again.

   So we must avoid putting A in position 3.

   In ""ROAST"", A is in position 3 -> not allowed.

 - How about ""RATIO""? 
   R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5). 
   Here, A is in position 2 -> allowed.

 - ""RADIO"": R(1), A(2), D(3), I(4), O(5) -> A in position 2 -> allowed.

 - ""ARTSY"": but A is in position 1 -> allowed, but the word has Y and S, and we don't know about them. Also, we have to avoid E? It doesn't have E.

 But note: we have to use valid words. ""ARTSY"" is valid? It's a word (meaning artistic). But let's see if we can get more common words.

 Another: ""PARTY"": P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), Y(5) -> A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 3 (allowed, because we only know it's not in position 2).

 But we have to avoid C, N, E. ""PARTY"" doesn't have these.

 However, we have two known letters (A and R) and we are putting R in position 3 and A in position 2. That's acceptable.

 But note: we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let me compare:

 Option 1: ""RADIO"" -> letters: R, A, D, I, O. We test D, I, O.
 Option 2: ""PARTY"" -> letters: P, A, R, T, Y. We test P, T, Y.
 Option 3: ""ROAST"" is invalid because A is in position 3.

 Another word: ""RAILS"" -> R(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), S(5). 
   A is in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed). We test I, L, S.

 But note: we have to avoid using the same letter twice? We are using R and A only once.

 We want to maximize new letters. Also, we want to cover common letters.

 Let's think about frequencies: 
   In English, S, T, L, O, I are common.

 So, ""RAILS"" uses R, A, I, L, S -> that's five new letters? Actually, we are using R and A, but we are testing three new ones.

 Alternatively, ""RADIO"" uses R, A, D, I, O -> testing D, I, O.

 ""PARTY"": P, A, R, T, Y -> testing P, T, Y.

 The most common letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. But we know E, N, C are absent. So we should test I, O, T, S, L.

 So, a word that includes R and A and tests I, O, T, S, L? That would be ideal.

 How about ""RASPY""? 
   R(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5). 
   A is in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed). We test S, P, Y.

 But we are missing O, I, T.

 Another: ""TRAIL"" -> T(1), R(2) -> wait, R is in position 2? But we know R is not in position 2? 
   Actually, the feedback for the first guess: R was in position 2 and we got a '-' meaning it is in the word but not in that position. 
   So we cannot put R in position 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it's not there. 
   So we should avoid putting R in position 2.

 In ""TRAIL"", R is in position 2 -> not allowed.

 How about ""STARK""? But we don't have A. We must include A.

 How about ""ARTSY""? A(1), R(2) -> R in position 2 is not allowed.

 How about ""RALLY""? 
   R(1), A(2), L(3), L(4), Y(5) -> but we have two L's? And we don't know if L is in the word. Also, we are repeating L? 
   But the word ""RALLY"" has two L's. We don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. But to maximize information, we might avoid repeats.

 Alternatively, ""RAILS"" (as I thought earlier) is without repeats and covers I, L, S.

 Another: ""RAPID"": R(1), A(2), P(3), I(4), D(5) -> A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed). We test P, I, D.

 But we are missing S, T, L.

 How about ""ROTLS""? Not a word.

 After considering, I think ""RAILS"" is a good candidate:
   R in position 1 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed), then I, L, S.

 But note: we have to make sure we don't use any of the absent letters (C, N, E). ""RAILS"" is clean.

 However, we have to consider that the secret word might have the letter in a different position. We are testing R in position 1 and A in position 2.

 Alternatively, we could try to put R in a different position, say position 4 or 5? 

 For example, ""PLANT"" has N and we know N is absent. So invalid.

 How about ""SPRAY"": 
   S(1), P(2), R(3), A(4), Y(5). 
   Here, R is in position 3 (allowed) and A is in position 4 (allowed, because we only know it's not in position 3). 
   We test S, P, Y.

 But we are not using the fact that we know A is in the word. We are using A.

 However, we are not using R in a new position? We are using R in position 3, which is new.

 But note: we have two known letters (R and A) and we are using them. Also, we are testing S, P, Y.

 But we are missing the opportunity to test more vowels? We already have A, and we know E is absent. So we might test O or I.

 Since we have two vowels already (A and ? we don't know), we might want to test O or I.

 Let me try to form a word that has R, A, and also O and I? 

 How about ""ORBIT""? 
   O(1), R(2) -> wait, R in position 2 is not allowed.

 How about ""ROBIN"": 
   R(1), O(2), B(3), I(4), N(5) -> but N is absent! We cannot use N.

 How about ""ROBIA""? Not a common word.

 How about ""RADIO"" (which we considered earlier) -> R(1), A(2), D(3), I(4), O(5). 
   This has A in position 2 (allowed) and R in position 1 (allowed). We test D, I, O.

 This seems good.

 But note: we are using R in position 1 and A in position 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Alternatively, we could try to put R in position 4 or 5? 

 For example, ""PLAIN"": 
   P(1), L(2), A(3) -> but A in position 3 is not allowed (we know A is not in position 3). So invalid.

 How about ""PARIS"": 
   P(1), A(2), R(3), I(4), S(5). 
   A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 3 (allowed). We test P, I, S.

 This is also a candidate.

 Now, which one to choose? 

 We want to test as many common letters as possible and avoid repeating known positions for R and A.

 Let me list the positions we are using for R and A in our candidates:

 - ""RADIO"": R(1), A(2)
 - ""PARTY"": P(1), A(2), R(3) -> note: R is in position 3 (which is new) and A in position 2 (new position for A).
 - ""RAILS"": R(1), A(2), then I(3), L(4), S(5) -> R in 1, A in 2, then I, L, S.

 The word ""PARTY"" uses the same positions for R and A as ""RADIO"" but then we test P, T, Y. 

 Since we have two letters that we know are in the word, we might want to try to place them in positions we haven't tried. 
 In the first guess, we had R in position 2 and A in position 3. Now we are trying A in position 2 and R in position 1 (in ""RADIO"") or in position 3 (in ""PARTY"").

 We don't have any information about position 1, so trying R in position 1 is a new position.

 Similarly, for A: we tried position 3 and now we try position 2.

 I think ""RADIO"" is a good choice because it tests three new vowels and consonants.

 But note: the secret word might not have O, I, D. We are testing them.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that uses more common consonants like S, T, L.

 How about ""STAIR"": 
   S(1), T(2), A(3) -> but A in position 3 is not allowed.

 How about ""TRAIL"": 
   T(1), R(2) -> R in position 2 is not allowed.

 How about ""RATIO"": 
   R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5) -> A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed). We test T, I, O.

 This is similar to ""RADIO"" but instead of D, we test T, I, O.

 ""RATIO"" is a valid word.

 Now, between ""RADIO"", ""RATIO"", ""PARTY"", and ""RAILS"", which one?

 We want to cover more common letters. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. 
 Since E, N, C are out, we can try T, O, I, S, L.

 ""RATIO"" has T, I, O -> that's three common letters.

 ""PARTY"" has P, T, Y -> Y is less common.

 ""RAILS"" has I, L, S -> that's three common letters.

 But note: in ""RAILS"", we are using R in position 1 and A in position 2. Then we have I, L, S in positions 3,4,5.

 In ""RATIO"", we have R in 1, A in 2, then T, I, O.

 I think ""RATIO"" is a good choice because it tests T, I, O which are very common.

 But wait: we have to avoid using letters we know are absent? We know C, N, E are absent, so ""RATIO"" is safe.

 Alternatively, we could try ""ROAST"" but we cannot because A would be in position 3 (which is forbidden).

 Another candidate: ""RASPY"" -> R(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5). 
   We test S, P, Y.

 But we are missing O and I.

 I think ""RATIO"" is a solid choice.

 However, note that the word ""RADIO"" is also good because it tests O and I.

 But let me check: the word ""RADIO"" is valid.

 Since we have two vowels already (A and we don't have any other vowels known), testing O and I is good.

 So, I'll go with ""RADIO"".

 But wait: what about the position of R? We know R is in the word but not in position 2. We are now putting R in position 1. 
 If the secret word has R in position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or an x? 

 Similarly, A in position 2: if it's correct, we get a check; if not, we get a minus or x? But we know A is in the word, so it won't be x.

 So, let's choose ""RADIO"".

 But note: we are using R and A again. That's okay because we are trying to find their correct positions.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't reuse R and A? But we have to include them because we know they are in the word. 

 Actually, we must include them because we are trying to get more information about their positions.

 So, I'll go with ""RADIO"".

 However, let me think of a word that uses R and A and also includes T, O, I? But we can't have all three? 

 How about ""TRAIL""? We can't because R must be included and we can't put R in position 2.

 Another: ""ARTIS"" -> not a word.

 I think ""RADIO"" is a good choice.

 But wait: what about ""RAINS""? 
   R(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), S(5) -> but N is absent! We cannot use N.

 So, we must avoid N.

 Therefore, ""RADIO"" is valid.

 Let me confirm: 
   R in position 1: we don't know if that's allowed? It is, because we only know R is not in position 2.
   A in position 2: we don't have a restriction for A in position 2? Only that it is not in position 3.

 So, I'll go with ""RADIO"".

 But note: we are using D. We don't know about D. It might be common or not.

 Alternatively, we could use ""ROAST"" if we were allowed to put A in a new position? But we cannot put A in position 3.

 How about ""RALLY""? 
   R(1), A(2), L(3), L(4), Y(5) -> but we have two L's. And we don't know if the word has two L's. Also, we are not testing as many new letters.

 I think ""RADIO"" is better.

 Let me search for a word that has R, A, T, O, I? 

 How about ""RATIO"" (which is the same as ""RADIO"" but rearranged). 
   R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5)

 This is a valid word and tests T, I, O.

 I think ""RATIO"" is slightly better because it has T and I (which are very common) and O.

 So, I'll go with ""RATIO"".

 But wait: in ""RATIO"", we are putting A in position 2 and R in position 1. 

 We know that R is in the word but not in position 2. We are now testing R in position 1. 
 If it's correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus.

 Similarly, A in position 2: we don't have a restriction for A in position 2, so we can test it.

 Therefore, I choose ""RATIO"".

 But note: we are using R and A again. That's okay.

 So, second guess: ""RATIO""

<guess>ratio</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, N, E** are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **R** is present but not in position 2 (marked ""-"").
- **A** is present but not in position 3 (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **R** and **A** (since they are confirmed present).
- Avoid **C, N, E** (absent letters).
- Test new common letters (e.g., **T, I, O**) to gather more information.
- **R** cannot be in position 2, and **A** cannot be in position 3.

The word **""RATIO""** fits these criteria:
- **R** is in position 1 (new position, not 2).
- **A** is in position 2 (new position, not 3).
- Introduces **T, I, O** (common letters not yet tested).
- Valid 5-letter word, avoiding forbidden letters.

This guess efficiently tests new positions for known letters and explores additional common letters.

<guess>ratio</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (absent)
- R: - (present, but not in position 2)
- A: - (present, but not in position 3)
- N: x (absent)
- E: x (absent)

Guess 2: ""ratio""
- R: - (present, but not in position 1)  [since we got '-' for R in position 1]
- A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)      [we got '✓' for A in position 2]
- T: x (absent)
- I: x (absent)
- O: x (absent)

So, from this, we know:

1. The secret word has the letter 'A' in position 2. (because we got a check for A in position 2 in ""ratio"")
2. The letter 'R' is present, but not in position 1 (from ""ratio"") and not in position 2 (from ""crane""). So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
3. The following letters are absent: C, N, E, T, I, O.

Also, from ""crane"", we know that A is not in position 3 (but now we know it's in position 2, so that's consistent).

Now, the secret word has the form: _ A _ _ _

And the letters we know are present: R (in position 3,4, or 5) and (we don't know about duplicates, but so far no duplicates).

We also know the absent letters: C, N, E, T, I, O.

We need to make a third guess that:
- Has 'A' in position 2 (fixed)
- Includes 'R' in one of the positions 3,4,5 (but not 1 or 2)
- Avoids the absent letters: C, N, E, T, I, O
- We can use other common letters to test.

Since we know A is in position 2, we can fix that.

Let's think of words that have the form: _ A _ _ _ and contain the letter R in position 3,4, or 5.

We also want to test other common letters that we haven't tried yet. The remaining common letters include: S, L, U, D, M, P, B, G, etc.

Let's try to form a word:

Option 1: R in position 3: _ A R _ _
We need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth positions with letters that are not in the absent list and form a valid word.

Possible letters: We can use B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Example: ""BARMY"" -> B(1), A(2), R(3), M(4), Y(5). But we don't know about B, M, Y.

But we need to test more letters. However, we must include R in position 3.

Another: ""PARKS"": P(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5). This tests P, K, S.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""PARKS"" uses P, A, R, K, S. None of these are in the absent list (C,N,E,T,I,O). So it's valid.

Option 2: R in position 4: _ A _ R _
Example: ""FAIRY"" -> but we have I and Y? I is absent, so invalid. 
""HAIRY"" -> same issue, I is absent.
""LAIRD"": L(1), A(2), I(3) -> I is absent, invalid.
""MARRY"": M(1), A(2), R(3) -> wait, R is in position 3, not 4. 
We need R in position 4: so _ A _ R _

Another: ""BASER"" -> but E is absent, invalid.
""PAPER"" -> E absent, invalid.
""SAVOR"" -> S(1), A(2), V(3), O(4), R(5) -> but O is absent and R is in position 5, not 4. 
We need R in position 4: so the word must have R in the fourth position.

How about ""LAPSE"": but E and S? E is absent, so invalid.
""MAPLE"": E absent, invalid.

It's hard to find a word with R in position 4 without using absent letters. 

Option 3: R in position 5: _ A _ _ R
Example: ""BAKER"": E absent, invalid.
""MAKER"": E absent, invalid.
""FILER"": I and E absent, invalid.
""HALMR"": not a word.

This is difficult. So maybe R in position 3 or 4 is easier.

Let me try R in position 3: _ A R _ _

We need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth positions.

Possible words:
- ""BARMY"": B(1), A(2), R(3), M(4), Y(5) -> tests B, M, Y
- ""CARDS"": but C is absent, invalid.
- ""PARKS"": P(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5) -> tests P, K, S
- ""MARKS"": M(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5) -> tests M, K, S
- ""BARKS"": B(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5) -> tests B, K, S

All these are valid and use only allowed letters.

We also have the option to test more vowels? But we know the word has A, and we don't have any other vowels known (since E,I,O are absent, and we have A). So we might test U? But we don't know if U is in the word.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we need to be efficient.

We can also consider words that don't have R in position 3? But we know R must be in 3,4, or 5. Since position 4 and 5 are harder, let's stick with position 3.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test common letters and maximize information.

We haven't tested: S, L, D, U, P, M, B, G, etc.

""PARKS"" tests P, K, S.
""BARKS"" tests B, K, S.
""MARKS"" tests M, K, S.

The letter S is common, so testing S is good. K is less common, but we have to use it because we are trying to place R.

But note: we are not sure if the word has S or not. We are testing it.

Alternatively, we could try a word that uses a different set of letters to cover more ground.

But we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

Another idea: we know the word has R and A. We have A fixed at position 2. So the word is ?A??

We can try to use a word that has R in position 4 or 5, but we had trouble finding valid words without absent letters.

Let me try R in position 4 again: 
- _ A _ R _
We need a word: 
  First letter: not C,N,E,T,I,O -> so we can use B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.
  Fourth letter: R
  Fifth letter: not absent.

Example: ""BALMY"": B(1), A(2), L(3), M(4), Y(5) -> but this doesn't have R? We need R in position 4. 
""BALMY"" has M in position 4, not R.

How about ""SALAD"": but two A's? And D. But we have A in position 2 and then again? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are avoiding E? ""SALAD"" has two A's and D. But we don't know about duplicates. Also, we have to avoid E? It doesn't have E, but it has A twice and D. 

But we are not sure if the word has two A's. We know at least one A is in position 2. It might have another A? But we don't know.

We can try, but let's avoid duplicates for now to get more information.

Another word: ""PALER"": but E is absent, invalid.
""MANOR"": M(1), A(2), N(3) -> N is absent! Invalid.
""FAVOR"": F(1), A(2), V(3), O(4), R(5) -> but O is absent and R is in position 5, not 4. 
We need R in position 4: so the fourth letter must be R.

How about ""LAPSE"": but E is absent.

This is difficult. So maybe R in position 5 is easier?

But we already have a candidate for R in position 5: ""BAKER"" is invalid because of E. 

""MAKER"": same.

""FILER"": invalid.

""HALMR"": not a word.

So perhaps R is more likely in position 3? 

Let me think of common words: 
- ""PARIS"": but we have I? I is absent, and also we have I in position 4? But I is absent, so invalid.
- ""BARON"": O is absent, invalid.

Another: ""CARDS"": C absent, invalid.

So, let's stick with R in position 3.

Now, among the candidates: ""BARKS"", ""PARKS"", ""MARKS"", ""BARMY"", etc.

We want to test letters that are more common. S is very common, so we can test a word that includes S.

We also have L, which is common.

How about ""BARKS"": B(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5). 
This tests B, K, S.

But we have to consider that the word might have B, K, S.

Alternatively, we can try ""LARGE"": but E is absent and also G? But E is absent.

How about ""MARSH"": M(1), A(2), R(3), S(4), H(5). 
This tests M, S, H.

But we don't know about H.

Another: ""PARKS"" is similar but with P instead of M.

We can also consider ""R"" in position 4? But we couldn't find a word. 

What about ""GAUZE"": but E and Z? E is absent, invalid.

I think we have to choose from the words we have.

But note: we have another piece of information. In the first guess, we had R in position 2 (which was wrong) and in the second guess we had R in position 1 (which was wrong). Now we are trying R in position 3.

We also know that A is in position 2.

So, let's list the possibilities for the secret word:

Position 1: cannot be C,N,E,T,I,O,C,N,E,T,I,O -> so we can use B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.
Position 2: A (fixed)
Position 3: could be R? or another letter? But we know R is in the word and not in 1 or 2, so 3,4,5.
Position 4 and 5: similarly.

We need to test the position of R and also test new letters.

We have 3 positions to fill: 1, 3,4,5? Actually, position 2 is fixed as A, so we have positions 1,3,4,5 to fill with letters that include R (in 3,4,5) and two more letters? Because we have 5 letters: position1,2,3,4,5 -> we know 2 is A, so we need to test the other positions.

We know the word has R and A. So the other three positions must be filled with letters that are not in the absent list.

We are going to test multiple new letters.

I think ""PARKS"" is a good choice: it tests P, K, S. K is less common, but S is very common.

Alternatively, ""BARKS"" tests B, K, S.

Or ""MARSH"" tests M, S, H.

How about ""LARGE""? But E is absent.

Another word: ""DARKY"": D(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), Y(5). 
This tests D, K, Y.

But Y is less common.

I think ""PARKS"" is a solid choice.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have S. We haven't tested S yet.

So, let's go with ""PARKS"".

But wait: we are putting R in position 3. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't have R in position 3? But we don't have many options.

Another candidate: ""FARCE"": but C and E absent, invalid.

How about ""HARPY"": H(1), A(2), R(3), P(4), Y(5). 
This tests H, P, Y.

But we are missing S.

I think ""PARKS"" is better than ""HARPY"" because S is more common.

But let me see: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""PARKS"" uses P, A, R, K, S. All are allowed.

So, I'll go with ""PARKS"".

But note: we are using K. If the word has K, we'll know. Similarly, P and S.

We might also consider ""BARMY"", but Y is less common.

Another word: ""GARDE"": but E is absent.

I think ""PARKS"" is a valid choice.

But wait: what about the possibility that R is in position 4? We didn't find a word, but maybe there is one.

How about ""WASPY"": W(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5) -> but this doesn't have R? We must include R because we know it's in the word. So we have to include R.

So, we must have R in position 3,4, or 5.

Another word with R in position 4: 
- ""BAJRA""? Not common.
- ""MAJAR"": not common.

How about ""SABER"": but E is absent.

I think we have to go with R in position 3.

So, I choose ""PARKS"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not repeating a position that we know is wrong for R? We are putting R in position 3. We don't have any feedback that position 3 is wrong for R? We only know that position 1 and 2 are wrong for R.

So, let's go with ""PARKS"".

But wait: what about the letter K? We don't know about K. It might be common or not.

Alternatively, we could try a word that uses L, which is very common. 

How about ""LARGE"": but E is absent.

How about ""LARKS"": L(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5). 
This tests L, K, S.

Or ""WARKS"": not common.

I think ""PARKS"" is acceptable.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""PARKS"" is P-A-R-K-S. 
P: not absent? We haven't tested P. 
K: not tested.
S: not tested.

So, let's use ""PARKS"".

But wait: what about the possibility that the word has duplicate letters? We don't have any indication, so we can ignore for now.

Another candidate: ""BARGE"": but E is absent.

I think we have to go with it.

But note: we have to consider that the word might be ""PARIS"", but I is absent and also we have I in position 4? No, ""PARIS"" has I and O? O is absent.

So, let's finalizes: ""PARKS""

But wait, what about ""R"" in position 3? We are using R in position 3. If the secret word has R in position 3, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and then we know R must be in position 4 or 5.

So, let's do it.

Guess: ""PARKS""

But note: we are putting R in position 3. We don't have any feedback that position 3 is wrong for R? Actually, we only know that position 1 and 2 are wrong for R. Position 3 might be correct.

So, we are testing position 3 for R.

If we get a check for R, then we know R is in position 3. If we get a minus, then R is in position 4 or 5.

Similarly, we test P, K, S.

So, it's a good test.

Therefore, I choose ""PARKS"".

But let me check if there's a word that tests more common letters. 

Another idea: ""SARIS"": S(1), A(2), R(3), I(4) -> I is absent, invalid.

""SAVOR"": O absent.

I think ""PARKS"" is fine.

So, the guess is ""PARKS"".

But note: we are using K. If we don't want to use K, we could try ""BARKS"" (B instead of P). But P is more common than B? In wordle, P is common.

Actually, in wordle, S is the most common, then L, then ... then K, then P, etc.

But we are testing S at the end, which is common.

So, I'll go with ""PARKS"".

But wait: what about ""R"" in position 3? We are testing it.

So, let's output ""PARKS"".

But note: we have to make sure we don't use absent letters. ""PARKS"" has P, A, R, K, S. None of these are in the absent list (C,N,E,T,I,O).

So, it's valid.

Therefore, the third guess is ""PARKS"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R and A are present but not in positions 2 or 3, respectively. C, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""ratio"")**: A is correct in position 2 (✓). R is present but not in position 1 (-). T, I, O are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. **A is fixed in position 2** (from ""ratio"" feedback: ✓).
2. **R is present** but cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from both guesses). It must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
3. **Absent letters**: C, N, E, T, I, O (cannot be used).
4. **Unknown positions**: 1, 3, 4, 5 need to be solved, with R one of them (in 3,4, or 5).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Must include R** in position 3, 4, or 5 (since positions 1 and 2 are invalid for R).
- **A must be in position 2** (fixed).
- **Avoid absent letters** (C, N, E, T, I, O).
- Test new common letters (e.g., S, L, P, M) to gather more information.
- Prioritize words with R in position 3 (as position 4/5 is harder to form valid words without absent letters).

The word **""PARKS""** fits perfectly:
- **P** (new letter, tests position 1)
- **A** (fixed in position 2)
- **R** (placed in position 3 to test if it's correct)
- **K** (new letter, tests position 4)
- **S** (new letter, tests position 5)

This guess:
- Tests R in position 3 (if correct, we get ✓; if not, we learn R is in 4/5).
- Tests three new common letters (P, K, S).
- Avoids all absent letters.

""PARTY"" doesn\'t have these.\n\n However, we have two known letters (A and R) and we are putting R in position 3 and A in position 2.

We test P, T, Y.\n Option 3: ""ROAST"" is invalid because A is in position 3.\n\n Another word: ""RAILS"" -> R(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), S(5). \n   A is in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed).

But we know R is not in position 2? \n   Actually, the feedback for the first guess: R was in position 2 and we got a \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not in that position. \n   So we cannot put R in position 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it\'s not there. \n   So we should avoid putting R in position 2.\n\n In ""TRAIL"", R is in position 2 -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""STARK""? But we don\'t have A. We must include A.\n\n How about ""ARTSY""? A(1), R(2) -> R in position 2 is not allowed.\n\n How about ""RALLY""? \n   R(1), A(2), L(3), L(4), Y(5) -> but we have two L\'s? And we don\'t know if L is in the word. Also, we are repeating L? \n   But the word ""RALLY"" has two L\'s. We don\'t know if the secret word has repeated letters. But to maximize information, we might avoid repeats.\n\n Alternatively, ""RAILS"" (as I thought earlier) is without repeats and covers I, L, S.\n\n Another: ""RAPID"": R(1), A(2), P(3), I(4), D(5) -> A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed). We test P, I, D.\n\n But we are missing S, T, L.\n\n How about ""ROTLS""? Not a word.\n\n After considering, I think ""RAILS"" is a good candidate:\n   R in position 1 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed), then I, L, S.\n\n But note: we have to make sure we don\'t use any of the absent letters (C, N, E). ""RAILS"" is clean.\n\n However, we have to consider that the secret word might have the letter in a different position. We are testing R in position 1 and A in position 2.\n\n Alternatively, we could try to put R in a different position, say position 4 or 5? \n\n For example, ""PLANT"" has N and we know N is absent. So invalid.\n\n How about ""SPRAY"": \n   S(1), P(2), R(3), A(4), Y(5). \n   Here, R is in position 3 (allowed) and A is in position 4 (allowed, because we only know it\'s not in position 3). \n   We test S, P, Y.\n\n But we are not using the fact that we know A is in the word. We are using A.\n\n However, we are not using R in a new position? We are using R in position 3, which is new.\n\n But note: we have two known letters (R and A) and we are using them. Also, we are testing S, P, Y.\n\n But we are missing the opportunity to test more vowels? We already have A, and we know E is absent. So we might test O or I.\n\n Since we have two vowels already (A and ? we don\'t know), we might want to test O or I.\n\n Let me try to form a word that has R, A, and also O and I? \n\n How about ""ORBIT""? \n   O(1), R(2) -> wait, R in position 2 is not allowed.\n\n How about ""ROBIN"": \n   R(1), O(2), B(3), I(4), N(5) -> but N is absent! We cannot use N.\n\n How about ""ROBIA""? Not a common word.\n\n How about ""RADIO"" (which we considered earlier) -> R(1), A(2), D(3), I(4), O(5). \n   This has A in position 2 (allowed) and R in position 1 (allowed). We test D, I, O.\n\n This seems good.\n\n But note: we are using R in position 1 and A in position 2. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\n Alternatively, we could try to put R in position 4 or 5? \n\n For example, ""PLAIN"": \n   P(1), L(2), A(3) -> but A in position 3 is not allowed (we know A is not in position 3). So invalid.\n\n How about ""PARIS"": \n   P(1), A(2), R(3), I(4), S(5). \n   A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 3 (allowed). We test P, I, S.\n\n This is also a candidate.\n\n Now, which one to choose? \n\n We want to test as many common letters as possible and avoid repeating known positions for R and A.\n\n Let me list the positions we are using for R and A in our candidates:\n\n - ""RADIO"": R(1), A(2)\n - ""PARTY"": P(1), A(2), R(3) -> note: R is in position 3 (which is new) and A in position 2 (new position for A).\n - ""RAILS"": R(1), A(2), then I(3), L(4), S(5) -> R in 1, A in 2, then I, L, S.\n\n The word ""PARTY"" uses the same positions for R and A as ""RADIO"" but then we test P, T, Y. \n\n Since we have two letters that we know are in the word, we might want to try to place them in positions we haven\'t tried. \n In the first guess, we had R in position 2 and A in position 3. Now we are trying A in position 2 and R in position 1 (in ""RADIO"") or in position 3 (in ""PARTY"").\n\n We don\'t have any information about position 1, so trying R in position 1 is a new position.\n\n Similarly, for A: we tried position 3 and now we try position 2.\n\n I think ""RADIO"" is a good choice because it tests three new vowels and consonants.\n\n But note: the secret word might not have O, I, D. We are testing them.\n\n Alternatively, we could try a word that uses more common consonants like S, T, L.\n\n How about ""STAIR"": \n   S(1), T(2), A(3) -> but A in position 3 is not allowed.\n\n How about ""TRAIL"": \n   T(1), R(2) -> R in position 2 is not allowed.\n\n How about ""RATIO"": \n   R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5) -> A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed). We test T, I, O.\n\n This is similar to ""RADIO"" but instead of D, we test T, I, O.\n\n ""RATIO"" is a valid word.\n\n Now, between ""RADIO"", ""RATIO"", ""PARTY"", and ""RAILS"", which one?\n\n We want to cover more common letters. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. \n Since E, N, C are out, we can try T, O, I, S, L.\n\n ""RATIO"" has T, I, O -> that\'s three common letters.\n\n ""PARTY"" has P, T, Y -> Y is less common.\n\n ""RAILS"" has I, L, S -> that\'s three common letters.\n\n But note: in ""RAILS"", we are using R in position 1 and A in position 2. Then we have I, L, S in positions 3,4,5.\n\n In ""RATIO"", we have R in 1, A in 2, then T, I, O.\n\n I think ""RATIO"" is a good choice because it tests T, I, O which are very common.\n\n But wait: we have to avoid using letters we know are absent? We know C, N, E are absent, so ""RATIO"" is safe.\n\n Alternatively, we could try ""ROAST"" but we cannot because A would be in position 3 (which is forbidden).\n\n Another candidate: ""RASPY"" -> R(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5). \n   We test S, P, Y.\n\n But we are missing O and I.\n\n I think ""RATIO"" is a solid choice.\n\n However, note that the word ""RADIO"" is also good because it tests O and I.\n\n But let me check: the word ""RADIO"" is valid.\n\n Since we have two vowels already (A and we don\'t have any other vowels known), testing O and I is good.\n\n So, I\'ll go with ""RADIO"".\n\n But wait: what about the position of R? We know R is in the word but not in position 2. We are now putting R in position 1. \n If the secret word has R in position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or an x? \n\n Similarly, A in position 2: if it\'s correct, we get a check; if not, we get a minus or x? But we know A is in the word, so it won\'t be x.\n\n So, let\'s choose ""RADIO"".\n\n But note: we are using R and A again. That\'s okay because we are trying to find their correct positions.\n\n Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn\'t reuse R and A? But we have to include them because we know they are in the word. \n\n Actually, we must include them because we are trying to get more information about their positions.\n\n So, I\'ll go with ""RADIO"".\n\n However, let me think of a word that uses R and A and also includes T, O, I? But we can\'t have all three? \n\n How about ""TRAIL""? We can\'t because R must be included and we can\'t put R in position 2.\n\n Another: ""ARTIS"" -> not a word.\n\n I think ""RADIO"" is a good choice.\n\n But wait: what about ""RAINS""? \n   R(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), S(5) -> but N is absent! We cannot use N.\n\n So, we must avoid N.\n\n Therefore, ""RADIO"" is valid.\n\n Let me confirm: \n   R in position 1: we don\'t know if that\'s allowed? It is, because we only know R is not in position 2.\n   A in position 2: we don\'t have a restriction for A in position 2? Only that it is not in position 3.\n\n So, I\'ll go with ""RADIO"".\n\n But note: we are using D. We don\'t know about D. It might be common or not.\n\n Alternatively, we could use ""ROAST"" if we were allowed to put A in a new position? But we cannot put A in position 3.\n\n How about ""RALLY""? \n   R(1), A(2), L(3), L(4), Y(5) -> but we have two L\'s. And we don\'t know if the word has two L\'s. Also, we are not testing as many new letters.\n\n I think ""RADIO"" is better.\n\n Let me search for a word that has R, A, T, O, I? \n\n How about ""RATIO"" (which is the same as ""RADIO"" but rearranged). \n   R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5)\n\n This is a valid word and tests T, I, O.\n\n I think ""RATIO"" is slightly better because it has T and I (which are very common) and O.\n\n So, I\'ll go with ""RATIO"".\n\n But wait: in ""RATIO"", we are putting A in position 2 and R in position 1. \n\n We know that R is in the word but not in position 2. We are now testing R in position 1. \n If it\'s correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus.\n\n Similarly, A in position 2: we don\'t have a restriction for A in position 2, so we can test it.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""RATIO"".\n\n But note: we are using R and A again. That\'s okay.\n\n So, second guess: ""RATIO""\n\n<guess>ratio</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C, N, E** are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- **R** is present but not in position 2 (marked ""-"").\n- **A** is present but not in position 3 (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **R** and **A** (since they are confirmed present).\n- Avoid **C, N, E** (absent letters).\n- Test new common letters (e.g., **T, I, O**) to gather more information.\n- **R** cannot be in position 2, and **A** cannot be in position 3.\n\nThe word **""RATIO""** fits these criteria:\n- **R** is in position 1 (new position, not 2).\n- **A** is in position 2 (new position, not 3).\n- Introduces **T, I, O** (common letters not yet tested).\n- Valid 5-letter word, avoiding forbidden letters.\n\nThis guess efficiently tests new positions for known letters and explores additional common letters.\n\n<guess>ratio</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (absent)\n- R: - (present, but not in position 2)\n- A: - (present, but not in position 3)\n- N: x (absent)\n- E: x (absent)\n\nGuess 2: ""ratio""\n- R: - (present, but not in position 1)  [since we got \'-\' for R in position 1]\n- A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)      [we got \'✓\' for A in position 2]\n- T: x (absent)\n- I: x (absent)\n- O: x (absent)\n\nSo, from this, we know:\n\n1. The secret word has the letter \'A\' in position 2. (because we got a check for A in position 2 in ""ratio"")\n2. The letter \'R\' is present, but not in position 1 (from ""ratio"") and not in position 2 (from ""crane""). So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.\n3. The following letters are absent: C, N, E, T, I, O.\n\nAlso, from ""crane"", we know that A is not in position 3 (but now we know it\'s in position 2, so that\'s consistent).\n\nNow, the secret word has the form: _ A _ _ _\n\nAnd the letters we know are present: R (in position 3,4, or 5) and (we don\'t know about duplicates, but so far no duplicates).\n\nWe also know the absent letters: C, N, E, T, I, O.\n\nWe need to make a third guess that:\n- Has \'A\' in position 2 (fixed)\n- Includes \'R\' in one of the positions 3,4,5 (but not 1 or 2)\n- Avoids the absent letters: C, N, E, T, I, O\n- We can use other common letters to test.\n\nSince we know A is in position 2, we can fix that.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have the form: _ A _ _ _ and contain the letter R in position 3,4, or 5.\n\nWe also want to test other common letters that we haven\'t tried yet. The remaining common letters include: S, L, U, D, M, P, B, G, etc.\n\nLet\'s try to form a word:\n\nOption 1: R in position 3: _ A R _ _\nWe need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth positions with letters that are not in the absent list and form a valid word.\n\nPossible letters: We can use B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nExample: ""BARMY"" -> B(1), A(2), R(3), M(4), Y(5). But we don\'t know about B, M, Y.\n\nBut we need to test more letters. However, we must include R in position 3.\n\nAnother: ""PARKS"": P(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5). This tests P, K, S.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""PARKS"" uses P, A, R, K, S. None of these are in the absent list (C,N,E,T,I,O). So it\'s valid.\n\nOption 2: R in position 4: _ A _ R _\nExample: ""FAIRY"" -> but we have I and Y? I is absent, so invalid. \n""HAIRY"" -> same issue, I is absent.\n""LAIRD"": L(1), A(2), I(3) -> I is absent, invalid.\n""MARRY"": M(1), A(2), R(3) -> wait, R is in position 3, not 4. \nWe need R in position 4: so _ A _ R _\n\nAnother: ""BASER"" -> but E is absent, invalid.\n""PAPER"" -> E absent, invalid.\n""SAVOR"" -> S(1), A(2), V(3), O(4), R(5) -> but O is absent and R is in position 5, not 4. \nWe need R in position 4: so the word must have R in the fourth position.\n\nHow about ""LAPSE"": but E and S? E is absent, so invalid.\n""MAPLE"": E absent, invalid.\n\nIt\'s hard to find a word with R in position 4 without using absent letters. \n\nOption 3: R in position 5: _ A _ _ R\nExample: ""BAKER"": E absent, invalid.\n""MAKER"": E absent, invalid.\n""FILER"": I and E absent, invalid.\n""HALMR"": not a word.\n\nThis is difficult. So maybe R in position 3 or 4 is easier.\n\nLet me try R in position 3: _ A R _ _\n\nWe need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth positions.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""BARMY"": B(1), A(2), R(3), M(4), Y(5) -> tests B, M, Y\n- ""CARDS"": but C is absent, invalid.\n- ""PARKS"": P(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5) -> tests P, K, S\n- ""MARKS"": M(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5) -> tests M, K, S\n- ""BARKS"": B(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5) -> tests B, K, S\n\nAll these are valid and use only allowed letters.\n\nWe also have the option to test more vowels? But we know the word has A, and we don\'t have any other vowels known (since E,I,O are absent, and we have A). So we might test U? But we don\'t know if U is in the word.\n\nBut note: we have only 6 tries, so we need to be efficient.\n\nWe can also consider words that don\'t have R in position 3? But we know R must be in 3,4, or 5. Since position 4 and 5 are harder, let\'s stick with position 3.\n\nNow, which one to choose? We want to test common letters and maximize information.\n\nWe haven\'t tested: S, L, D, U, P, M, B, G, etc.\n\n""PARKS"" tests P, K, S.\n""BARKS"" tests B, K, S.\n""MARKS"" tests M, K, S.\n\nThe letter S is common, so testing S is good. K is less common, but we have to use it because we are trying to place R.\n\nBut note: we are not sure if the word has S or not. We are testing it.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that uses a different set of letters to cover more ground.\n\nBut we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t have any indication of duplicates so far.\n\nAnother idea: we know the word has R and A. We have A fixed at position 2. So the word is ?A??\n\nWe can try to use a word that has R in position 4 or 5, but we had trouble finding valid words without absent letters.\n\nLet me try R in position 4 again: \n- _ A _ R _\nWe need a word: \n  First letter: not C,N,E,T,I,O -> so we can use B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n  Fourth letter: R\n  Fifth letter: not absent.\n\nExample: ""BALMY"": B(1), A(2), L(3), M(4), Y(5) -> but this doesn\'t have R? We need R in position 4. \n""BALMY"" has M in position 4, not R.\n\nHow about ""SALAD"": but two A\'s? And D. But we have A in position 2 and then again? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are avoiding E? ""SALAD"" has two A\'s and D. But we don\'t know about duplicates. Also, we have to avoid E? It doesn\'t have E, but it has A twice and D. \n\nBut we are not sure if the word has two A\'s. We know at least one A is in position 2. It might have another A? But we don\'t know.\n\nWe can try, but let\'s avoid duplicates for now to get more information.\n\nAnother word: ""PALER"": but E is absent, invalid.\n""MANOR"": M(1), A(2), N(3) -> N is absent! Invalid.\n""FAVOR"": F(1), A(2), V(3), O(4), R(5) -> but O is absent and R is in position 5, not 4. \nWe need R in position 4: so the fourth letter must be R.\n\nHow about ""LAPSE"": but E is absent.\n\nThis is difficult. So maybe R in position 5 is easier?\n\nBut we already have a candidate for R in position 5: ""BAKER"" is invalid because of E. \n\n""MAKER"": same.\n\n""FILER"": invalid.\n\n""HALMR"": not a word.\n\nSo perhaps R is more likely in position 3? \n\nLet me think of common words: \n- ""PARIS"": but we have I? I is absent, and also we have I in position 4? But I is absent, so invalid.\n- ""BARON"": O is absent, invalid.\n\nAnother: ""CARDS"": C absent, invalid.\n\nSo, let\'s stick with R in position 3.\n\nNow, among the candidates: ""BARKS"", ""PARKS"", ""MARKS"", ""BARMY"", etc.\n\nWe want to test letters that are more common. S is very common, so we can test a word that includes S.\n\nWe also have L, which is common.\n\nHow about ""BARKS"": B(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5). \nThis tests B, K, S.\n\nBut we have to consider that the word might have B, K, S.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""LARGE"": but E is absent and also G? But E is absent.\n\nHow about ""MARSH"": M(1), A(2), R(3), S(4), H(5). \nThis tests M, S, H.\n\nBut we don\'t know about H.\n\nAnother: ""PARKS"" is similar but with P instead of M.\n\nWe can also consider ""R"" in position 4? But we couldn\'t find a word. \n\nWhat about ""GAUZE"": but E and Z? E is absent, invalid.\n\nI think we have to choose from the words we have.\n\nBut note: we have another piece of information. In the first guess, we had R in position 2 (which was wrong) and in the second guess we had R in position 1 (which was wrong). Now we are trying R in position 3.\n\nWe also know that A is in position 2.\n\nSo, let\'s list the possibilities for the secret word:\n\nPosition 1: cannot be C,N,E,T,I,O,C,N,E,T,I,O -> so we can use B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.\nPosition 2: A (fixed)\nPosition 3: could be R? or another letter? But we know R is in the word and not in 1 or 2, so 3,4,5.\nPosition 4 and 5: similarly.\n\nWe need to test the position of R and also test new letters.\n\nWe have 3 positions to fill: 1, 3,4,5? Actually, position 2 is fixed as A, so we have positions 1,3,4,5 to fill with letters that include R (in 3,4,5) and two more letters? Because we have 5 letters: position1,2,3,4,5 -> we know 2 is A, so we need to test the other positions.\n\nWe know the word has R and A. So the other three positions must be filled with letters that are not in the absent list.\n\nWe are going to test multiple new letters.\n\nI think ""PARKS"" is a good choice: it tests P, K, S. K is less common, but S is very common.\n\nAlternatively, ""BARKS"" tests B, K, S.\n\nOr ""MARSH"" tests M, S, H.\n\nHow about ""LARGE""? But E is absent.\n\nAnother word: ""DARKY"": D(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), Y(5). \nThis tests D, K, Y.\n\nBut Y is less common.\n\nI think ""PARKS"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the word might have S. We haven\'t tested S yet.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""PARKS"".\n\nBut wait: we are putting R in position 3. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that doesn\'t have R in position 3? But we don\'t have many options.\n\nAnother candidate: ""FARCE"": but C and E absent, invalid.\n\nHow about ""HARPY"": H(1), A(2), R(3), P(4), Y(5). \nThis tests H, P, Y.\n\nBut we are missing S.\n\nI think ""PARKS"" is better than ""HARPY"" because S is more common.\n\nBut let me see: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""PARKS"" uses P, A, R, K, S. All are allowed.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""PARKS"".\n\nBut note: we are using K. If the word has K, we\'ll know. Similarly, P and S.\n\nWe might also consider ""BARMY"", but Y is less common.\n\nAnother word: ""GARDE"": but E is absent.\n\nI think ""PARKS"" is a valid choice.\n\nBut wait: what about the possibility that R is in position 4? We didn\'t find a word, but maybe there is one.\n\nHow about ""WASPY"": W(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5) -> but this doesn\'t have R? We must include R because we know it\'s in the word. So we have to include R.\n\nSo, we must have R in position 3,4, or 5.\n\nAnother word with R in position 4: \n- ""BAJRA""? Not common.\n- ""MAJAR"": not common.\n\nHow about ""SABER"": but E is absent.\n\nI think we have to go with R in position 3.\n\nSo, I choose ""PARKS"".\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that we are not repeating a position that we know is wrong for R? We are putting R in position 3. We don\'t have any feedback that position 3 is wrong for R? We only know that position 1 and 2 are wrong for R.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""PARKS"".\n\nBut wait: what about the letter K? We don\'t know about K. It might be common or not.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that uses L, which is very common. \n\nHow about ""LARGE"": but E is absent.\n\nHow about ""LARKS"": L(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5). \nThis tests L, K, S.\n\nOr ""WARKS"": not common.\n\nI think ""PARKS"" is acceptable.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""PARKS"" is P-A-R-K-S. \nP: not absent? We haven\'t tested P. \nK: not tested.\nS: not tested.\n\nSo, let\'s use ""PARKS"".\n\nBut wait: what about the possibility that the word has duplicate letters? We don\'t have any indication, so we can ignore for now.\n\nAnother candidate: ""BARGE"": but E is absent.\n\nI think we have to go with it.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the word might be ""PARIS"", but I is absent and also we have I in position 4? No, ""PARIS"" has I and O? O is absent.\n\nSo, let\'s finalizes: ""PARKS""\n\nBut wait, what about ""R"" in position 3? We are using R in position 3. If the secret word has R in position 3, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and then we know R must be in position 4 or 5.\n\nSo, let\'s do it.\n\nGuess: ""PARKS""\n\nBut note: we are putting R in position 3. We don\'t have any feedback that position 3 is wrong for R? Actually, we only know that position 1 and 2 are wrong for R. Position 3 might be correct.\n\nSo, we are testing position 3 for R.\n\nIf we get a check for R, then we know R is in position 3. If we get a minus, then R is in position 4 or 5.\n\nSimilarly, we test P, K, S.\n\nSo, it\'s a good test.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""PARKS"".\n\nBut let me check if there\'s a word that tests more common letters. \n\nAnother idea: ""SARIS"": S(1), A(2), R(3), I(4) -> I is absent, invalid.\n\n""SAVOR"": O absent.\n\nI think ""PARKS"" is fine.\n\nSo, the guess is ""PARKS"".\n\nBut note: we are using K.

In wordle, P is common.\n\nActually, in wordle, S is the most common, then L, then ... then K, then P, etc.\n\nBut we are testing S at the end, which is common.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""PARKS"".\n\nBut wait: what about ""R"" in position 3? We are testing it.\n\nSo, let\'s output ""PARKS"".\n\nBut note: we have to make sure we don\'t use absent letters. ""PARKS"" has P, A, R, K, S.

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent (x)
- R: present, wrong position (-)
- A: present, wrong position (-)
- N: absent (x)
- E: absent (x)

Guess 2: ""ratio""
- R: present, wrong position (-)  [now we know R is not in position 1 or 2]
- A: correct (✓) in position 2
- T: absent (x)
- I: absent (x)
- O: absent (x)

Guess 3: ""parks""
- P: absent (x)
- A: correct (✓) in position 2
- R: correct (✓) in position 3
- K: absent (x)
- S: absent (x)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. The secret word has:
   - A in position 2 (from guess 2 and 3)
   - R in position 3 (from guess 3: R is correct in position 3)

2. So the word so far is: _ A R _ _

3. We know the following letters are absent: C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S.

4. We also know that R is in position 3, so we don't need to test R again.

5. We know A is in position 2, so we don't need to test A.

6. We need to find the letters for positions 1, 4, and 5.

7. The word must contain only letters that are not in the absent list. The absent letters are: C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S.

8. The remaining letters that are possible: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, V, W, Y, and possibly others.

Now, we need to form a word that fits: _ A R _ _

We have to fill positions 1, 4, and 5 with letters from the remaining set, avoiding the absent letters.

Let's think of common words that fit the pattern:

- Position 1: a consonant or vowel? We can try common letters.

Possible words:

- ""BARGE"": but E is absent -> invalid.
- ""BARRE"": has E and two R's? E absent, and also we have R in position 3, but position 2 is A, so ""BARRE"" would be B,A,R,R,E -> but E is absent and also we have two R's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, E is absent so invalid.

We must avoid E.

- ""MARRY"": M,A,R,R,Y -> but we have two R's? And Y. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are using R again? But we know R is in position 3, so if we put R in position 4, that would be a duplicate? But we don't know if the word has two R's.

But note: we have only one R so far in the feedback? Actually, we don't know. The feedback doesn't show duplicates. But we can try.

However, we are trying to get information. Using a word with duplicate R might not be efficient because if we get a check for one R, we don't know about the other.

But we are forced to use the pattern _ A R _ _

We need to test letters for positions 1,4,5.

We can try to use a word that has new letters and avoids duplicates for now.

Let me list possible words:

- ""BARMY"": B(1), A(2), R(3), M(4), Y(5) -> tests B, M, Y. But we don't know about duplicates? And we are using M and Y.

But we don't have any duplicate in this word.

- ""HARPY"": but H(1), A(2), R(3), P(4), Y(5) -> but P is absent (from guess 3: P is absent). So invalid.

- ""LARDY"": L(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5) -> tests L, D, Y. L, D, Y are not in the absent list.

This seems valid.

- ""MARRY"": M(1), A(2), R(3), R(4), Y(5) -> but this has two R's. We know R is in position 3, so if we put R in position 4, we are testing for a duplicate. But we don't know if the word has two R's. Also, we are using R again, which we already know is in the word. It might be better to test new letters.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another word: ""WARTY"": W(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), Y(5) -> but T is absent (from guess 2: T is absent). So invalid.

""CARDS"": C absent.

""BARDS"": C absent.

""FARGO"": F(1), A(2), R(3), G(4), O(5) -> O is absent, invalid.

""MARSH"": S absent? S is absent from guess 3. So invalid.

""LARVA"": L(1), A(2), R(3), V(4), A(5) -> but we have two A's? And we don't know about duplicates. Also, A is already in position 2, so if we put A in position 5, we are testing for a duplicate. But we know A is in position 2, so if we get a check for A in position 5, that would be a duplicate. But we don't know if there is a duplicate.

However, we are trying to get information. Using a word with duplicate might not be efficient.

But we have to fill the positions.

Another word: ""DARBY"": D(1), A(2), R(3), B(4), Y(5). 
This tests D, B, Y.

But we don't know about duplicates? And we are not using any duplicate.

""DARBY"" is a word? It means a type of hawk, I think.

But let's see: we have to avoid absent letters. D, B, Y are not absent? 
Absent letters: C,N,E,T,I,O,P,K,S. So D, B, Y are allowed.

But we have to test new letters.

We can also consider ""HARDY"": H(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5). 
This tests H, D, Y.

But we don't know about duplicates.

Alternatively, ""LARDY"" as I thought earlier: L(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5). 
This tests L, D, Y.

""LARDY"" is a valid word (meaning fat or oily).

Another: ""MARDY"": M(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5). 
Similarly, tests M, D, Y.

But we don't know about duplicates.

We can also try to use a word that has a vowel in position 4 or 5? We have only position 1,4,5 to fill. We know the word has at least A and R, and we have three positions to fill.

But we don't know if the word has more vowels? We have A already, and we know E,I,O are absent. So the only vowel left is U? And sometimes Y.

So, the word might have U or Y as a vowel? But in position 4 or 5.

For example, ""BARUM"": but U? And M. But ""BARUM"" is not common.

""WARNS"": but W(1), A(2), R(3), N(4), S(5) -> N and S are absent, invalid.

""CARDS"": C absent.

I think we have to accept that we might have to test with duplicates or use Y.

But let me think of words without duplicates:

- ""BALMY"": but L and M? But ""BALMY"" is B,A,L,M,Y. But we need R in position 3? This is B,A,L,M,Y -> no R. So invalid.

We must have R in position 3.

So, the pattern is fixed: _ A R _ _

We need to fill the blanks with letters not in {C,N,E,T,I,O,P,K,S} and not R or A (but we can use other letters, but we don't have to avoid R and A in the blanks? Actually, we can use them if we suspect duplicates, but we have no evidence of duplicates so far. So we should avoid using R and A in the blanks to test new letters.

So, positions 1,4,5 must be filled with letters that are not in the absent list and not R or A? Not necessarily, but if we use R or A in these positions, we might get a duplicate, but we don't know if the word has a duplicate. So to test efficiently, we should use new letters.

But we have to form a valid word.

So, let's look for words that start with a consonant (or vowel) and then R, then two more letters.

Possible words:

- ""DARBY"" (if accepted): D, A, R, B, Y -> tests D, B, Y.
- ""HARDY"": H, A, R, D, Y -> tests H, D, Y.
- ""LARDY"": L, A, R, D, Y -> tests L, D, Y.
- ""MARDY"": M, A, R, D, Y -> tests M, D, Y.
- ""WARLY"": W, A, R, L, Y -> tests W, L, Y.
- ""BARNY"": B, A, R, N, Y -> but N is absent, invalid.
- ""JARUL"": not a word.

We can also try ""FARCE"", but C and E absent.

How about ""HAREM"": but E is absent and M? ""HAREM"" has E, invalid.

""BARRE"": has E, invalid.

""CARME"": C absent.

I think ""LARDY"" is a good candidate: it tests L, D, Y.

But we have to consider that the word might have duplicate R? We know R is in position 3, but if we put R in position 4? We are not doing that in this word.

In ""LARDY"", we have no duplicate.

Similarly, ""HARDY"" has no duplicate.

But we are testing the same letters: for position 1, we test H, M, B, W, etc.

We need to choose one.

But note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on the fourth guess. We can try to cover more common letters.

The most common letters left: L, D, Y, M, H, W, etc.

""LARDY"" tests L, D, Y.

""HARDY"" tests H, D, Y.

""MARDY"" tests M, D, Y.

I think ""LARDY"" is a good choice because L is a very common letter.

But we have to make sure that we are not missing something.

Another word: ""BARNY"": invalid because of N.

""JARUL"" not a word.

""VARNA"": but N absent.

""GAUZE"": E absent.

I think we have to go with one of these.

But wait: what about ""DARBS""? Not a word.

Or ""LARVA"": but V and A again? And duplicate A? But we don't know. And ""LARVA"" has V and A, but we are not testing duplicates? Actually, we are testing L, A, V, R, A? Wait, ""LARVA"" is L,A,R,V,A -> so positions: L(1), A(2), R(3), V(4), A(5). 
This has duplicate A. But we know A is in position 2, so if we put A in position 5, we are testing for a duplicate. But we don't know if the word has two A's.

However, we are on the fourth guess, and we have to test. But using a duplicate might not give us new information if there is only one A.

But we don't know. So it's risky.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have A in position 5? But we don't know.

Given the constraints, I think ""LARDY"" is a safe choice.

But let me check if there is a word that tests more common letters.

How about ""HARDY"" or ""LARDY"".

I think both are good. Let's choose ""HARDY"" because H is a common letter.

But we have to avoid the absent letters. ""HARDY"" uses H, A, R, D, Y. 
- H: not tested
- D: not tested
- Y: not tested

And it fits the pattern.

Similarly, ""LARDY"" uses L, A, R, D, Y.

Now, which one? H vs L.

H is more common than L? In English, H is more common than L? Actually, L is more common.

But we are testing two letters: one in position 1 and one in position 4 and 5.

We can also consider ""WARTY"": but T is absent.

""BARFY"": not common.

I think both are valid. Let's pick ""HARDY"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not using absent letters. ""HARDY"" is H,A,R,D,Y. 
- H: not absent? No, H has not been tested.
- D: not absent.
- Y: not absent.

So, it's valid.

Similarly, ""LARDY"" is L,A,R,D,Y.

I'll go with ""HARDY"" to test H.

But wait: we have to consider that the word might be ""HARDY"" itself? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we could try a word that uses U? But we don't have a word that fits and has U.

For example, ""GUARD"": but U,A,R,D -> but A is in position 2? ""GUARD"" is G,U,A,R,D -> positions: G(1), U(2) -> but we need A in position 2? No, in ""GUARD"", A is in position 3? 
G(1), U(2), A(3) -> but we need A in position 2. So invalid.

We must have A in position 2 and R in position 3.

So, the word must be: [letter] A R [letter] [letter]

We have to choose from the available letters.

I think ""HARDY"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there is a word with U. 

""RARER"": but E is absent and R duplicate? Also, E absent.

""PARER"": E absent.

I don't think there is a common word with U that fits.

So, I'll go with ""HARDY"".

But wait: what about ""BARMY""? B(1), A(2), R(3), M(4), Y(5). 
This tests B, M, Y.

H is more common than B? In English, H is more frequent.

But we are testing H in position 1.

Similarly, ""HARDY"" tests H in position 1, D in position 4, Y in position 5.

We can also consider ""MARSH"": but S is absent.

Another: ""DARKY"": D(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), Y(5) -> but K is absent (from guess 3). So invalid.

""HAIRY"": H(1), A(2), I(3) -> I is absent, invalid.

So, ""HARDY"" seems good.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""HARDY"" is H,A,R,D,Y. 
- H: allowed
- D: allowed
- Y: allowed

So, it's valid.

Therefore, I choose ""HARDY"".

But wait: what if the word is ""HARDY""? Then we get it right.

But we are guessing, so it might be.

Alternatively, we could try a word that tests more vowels? But we only have position 4 and 5 to test, and the word must have a vowel? We have A already, and we know E,I,O are absent. So the only vowel left is U or Y. Position 4 and 5 could be U or Y.

For example, ""HARDY"" has Y, which is a vowel-like letter.

But we don't know if Y is in the word.

Another word: ""WARNS"": invalid because of N and S.

""BARNS"": N and S absent.

I think ""HARDY"" is a good guess.

So, let's go with ""HARDY"".

But note: we are using D and Y. We haven't tested D or Y.

We could test L and D? But we can't test both in one word without using a duplicate or missing position.

We have to choose one.

Another candidate: ""BARDY"" - not a common word.

I think ""HARDY"" is acceptable.

So, fourth guess: ""HARDY""

But wait: what about ""LARGE""? E absent.

I think we have to make this guess.

But note: we have to consider that the word might be ""LARGE"", but E is absent.

So, let's finalize: ""HARDY""

But wait, what about ""DARKY""? Invalid because of K and T absent? K and T are absent.

No.

So, I think ""HARDY"" is a good choice.

Therefore, the guess is ""HARDY"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **A is confirmed in position 2** (from ""ratio"" and ""parks"" feedback: ✓).
- **R is confirmed in position 3** (from ""parks"" feedback: ✓).
- **Absent letters**: C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).
- **Present letters**: A (position 2), R (position 3), and one more letter (since the word is 5 letters).

### Current Knowledge:
- Secret word pattern: `[position1] A R [position4] [position5]`
- Position 1, 4, and 5 must be filled with letters not in the absent list.
- Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, V, W, Y, etc. (since C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S are absent).
- We need to test new common letters to identify the missing letters.

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **Focus on positions 1, 4, and 5**.
- Test high-frequency remaining letters (e.g., D, L, M, H, Y) to maximize information.
- Avoid reusing absent letters and avoid reusing R and A in positions 1, 4, or 5 (since we already know R is in position 3 and A is in position 2).
- Prioritize words that test three new letters in one guess to narrow down possibilities.

The word **""HARDY""** fits perfectly:
- **H** (new, tests position 1)
- **A** (fixed in position 2)
- **R** (fixed in position 3)
- **D** (new, tests position 4)
- **Y** (new, tests position 5)

This guess:
- Tests H, D, and Y (common letters).
- Avoids all absent letters.
- If incorrect, the feedback will reveal which of H, D, or Y (if any) are present and in the right positions.

<guess>hardy</guess>",hardy,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent (x)
- R: present, wrong position (-)
- A: present, wrong position (-)
- N: absent (x)
- E: absent (x)

Guess 2: ""ratio""
- R: present, wrong position (-)  [now we know R is not in position 1 or 2]
- A: correct (✓) in position 2
- T: absent (x)
- I: absent (x)
- O: absent (x)

Guess 3: ""parks""
- P: absent (x)
- A: correct (✓) in position 2
- R: correct (✓) in position 3
- K: absent (x)
- S: absent (x)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. The secret word has:
   - A in position 2 (from guess 2 and 3)
   - R in position 3 (from guess 3: R is correct in position 3)

2. So the word so far is: _ A R _ _

3. We know the following letters are absent: C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S.

4. We also know that R is in position 3, so we don't need to test R again.

5. We know A is in position 2, so we don't need to test A.

6. We need to find the letters for positions 1, 4, and 5.

7. The word must contain only letters that are not in the absent list. The absent letters are: C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S.

8. The remaining letters that are possible: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, V, W, Y, and possibly others.

Now, we need to form a word that fits: _ A R _ _

We have to fill positions 1, 4, and 5 with letters from the remaining set, avoiding the absent letters.

Let's think of common words that fit the pattern:

- Position 1: a consonant or vowel? We can try common letters.

Possible words:

- ""BARGE"": but E is absent -> invalid.
- ""BARRE"": has E and two R's? E absent, and also we have R in position 3, but position 2 is A, so ""BARRE"" would be B,A,R,R,E -> but E is absent and also we have two R's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, E is absent so invalid.

We must avoid E.

- ""MARRY"": M,A,R,R,Y -> but we have two R's? And Y. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are using R again? But we know R is in position 3, so if we put R in position 4, that would be a duplicate? But we don't know if the word has two R's.

But note: we have only one R so far in the feedback? Actually, we don't know. The feedback doesn't show duplicates. But we can try.

However, we are trying to get information. Using a word with duplicate R might not be efficient because if we get a check for one R, we don't know about the other.

But we are forced to use the pattern _ A R _ _

We need to test letters for positions 1,4,5.

We can try to use a word that has new letters and avoids duplicates for now.

Let me list possible words:

- ""BARMY"": B(1), A(2), R(3), M(4), Y(5) -> tests B, M, Y. But we don't know about duplicates? And we are using M and Y.

But we don't have any duplicate in this word.

- ""HARPY"": but H(1), A(2), R(3), P(4), Y(5) -> but P is absent (from guess 3: P is absent). So invalid.

- ""LARDY"": L(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5) -> tests L, D, Y. L, D, Y are not in the absent list.

This seems valid.

- ""MARRY"": M(1), A(2), R(3), R(4), Y(5) -> but this has two R's. We know R is in position 3, so if we put R in position 4, we are testing for a duplicate. But we don't know if the word has two R's. Also, we are using R again, which we already know is in the word. It might be better to test new letters.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another word: ""WARTY"": W(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), Y(5) -> but T is absent (from guess 2: T is absent). So invalid.

""CARDS"": C absent.

""BARDS"": C absent.

""FARGO"": F(1), A(2), R(3), G(4), O(5) -> O is absent, invalid.

""MARSH"": S absent? S is absent from guess 3. So invalid.

""LARVA"": L(1), A(2), R(3), V(4), A(5) -> but we have two A's? And we don't know about duplicates. Also, A is already in position 2, so if we put A in position 5, we are testing for a duplicate. But we know A is in position 2, so if we get a check for A in position 5, that would be a duplicate. But we don't know if there is a duplicate.

However, we are trying to get information. Using a word with duplicate might not be efficient.

But we have to fill the positions.

Another word: ""DARBY"": D(1), A(2), R(3), B(4), Y(5). 
This tests D, B, Y.

But we don't know about duplicates? And we are not using any duplicate.

""DARBY"" is a word? It means a type of hawk, I think.

But let's see: we have to avoid absent letters. D, B, Y are not absent? 
Absent letters: C,N,E,T,I,O,P,K,S. So D, B, Y are allowed.

But we have to test new letters.

We can also consider ""HARDY"": H(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5). 
This tests H, D, Y.

But we don't know about duplicates.

Alternatively, ""LARDY"" as I thought earlier: L(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5). 
This tests L, D, Y.

""LARDY"" is a valid word (meaning fat or oily).

Another: ""MARDY"": M(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5). 
Similarly, tests M, D, Y.

But we don't know about duplicates.

We can also try to use a word that has a vowel in position 4 or 5? We have only position 1,4,5 to fill. We know the word has at least A and R, and we have three positions to fill.

But we don't know if the word has more vowels? We have A already, and we know E,I,O are absent. So the only vowel left is U? And sometimes Y.

So, the word might have U or Y as a vowel? But in position 4 or 5.

For example, ""BARUM"": but U? And M. But ""BARUM"" is not common.

""WARNS"": but W(1), A(2), R(3), N(4), S(5) -> N and S are absent, invalid.

""CARDS"": C absent.

I think we have to accept that we might have to test with duplicates or use Y.

But let me think of words without duplicates:

- ""BALMY"": but L and M? But ""BALMY"" is B,A,L,M,Y. But we need R in position 3? This is B,A,L,M,Y -> no R. So invalid.

We must have R in position 3.

So, the pattern is fixed: _ A R _ _

We need to fill the blanks with letters not in {C,N,E,T,I,O,P,K,S} and not R or A (but we can use other letters, but we don't have to avoid R and A in the blanks? Actually, we can use them if we suspect duplicates, but we have no evidence of duplicates so far. So we should avoid using R and A in the blanks to test new letters.

So, positions 1,4,5 must be filled with letters that are not in the absent list and not R or A? Not necessarily, but if we use R or A in these positions, we might get a duplicate, but we don't know if the word has a duplicate. So to test efficiently, we should use new letters.

But we have to form a valid word.

So, let's look for words that start with a consonant (or vowel) and then R, then two more letters.

Possible words:

- ""DARBY"" (if accepted): D, A, R, B, Y -> tests D, B, Y.
- ""HARDY"": H, A, R, D, Y -> tests H, D, Y.
- ""LARDY"": L, A, R, D, Y -> tests L, D, Y.
- ""MARDY"": M, A, R, D, Y -> tests M, D, Y.
- ""WARLY"": W, A, R, L, Y -> tests W, L, Y.
- ""BARNY"": B, A, R, N, Y -> but N is absent, invalid.
- ""JARUL"": not a word.

We can also try ""FARCE"", but C and E absent.

How about ""HAREM"": but E is absent and M? ""HAREM"" has E, invalid.

""BARRE"": has E, invalid.

""CARME"": C absent.

I think ""LARDY"" is a good candidate: it tests L, D, Y.

But we have to consider that the word might have duplicate R? We know R is in position 3, but if we put R in position 4? We are not doing that in this word.

In ""LARDY"", we have no duplicate.

Similarly, ""HARDY"" has no duplicate.

But we are testing the same letters: for position 1, we test H, M, B, W, etc.

We need to choose one.

But note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on the fourth guess. We can try to cover more common letters.

The most common letters left: L, D, Y, M, H, W, etc.

""LARDY"" tests L, D, Y.

""HARDY"" tests H, D, Y.

""MARDY"" tests M, D, Y.

I think ""LARDY"" is a good choice because L is a very common letter.

But we have to make sure that we are not missing something.

Another word: ""BARNY"": invalid because of N.

""JARUL"" not a word.

""VARNA"": but N absent.

""GAUZE"": E absent.

I think we have to go with one of these.

But wait: what about ""DARBS""? Not a word.

Or ""LARVA"": but V and A again? And duplicate A? But we don't know. And ""LARVA"" has V and A, but we are not testing duplicates? Actually, we are testing L, A, V, R, A? Wait, ""LARVA"" is L,A,R,V,A -> so positions: L(1), A(2), R(3), V(4), A(5). 
This has duplicate A. But we know A is in position 2, so if we put A in position 5, we are testing for a duplicate. But we don't know if the word has two A's.

However, we are on the fourth guess, and we have to test. But using a duplicate might not give us new information if there is only one A.

But we don't know. So it's risky.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have A in position 5? But we don't know.

Given the constraints, I think ""LARDY"" is a safe choice.

But let me check if there is a word that tests more common letters.

How about ""HARDY"" or ""LARDY"".

I think both are good. Let's choose ""HARDY"" because H is a common letter.

But we have to avoid the absent letters. ""HARDY"" uses H, A, R, D, Y. 
- H: not tested
- D: not tested
- Y: not tested

And it fits the pattern.

Similarly, ""LARDY"" uses L, A, R, D, Y.

Now, which one? H vs L.

H is more common than L? In English, H is more common than L? Actually, L is more common.

But we are testing two letters: one in position 1 and one in position 4 and 5.

We can also consider ""WARTY"": but T is absent.

""BARFY"": not common.

I think both are valid. Let's pick ""HARDY"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not using absent letters. ""HARDY"" is H,A,R,D,Y. 
- H: not absent? No, H has not been tested.
- D: not absent.
- Y: not absent.

So, it's valid.

Similarly, ""LARDY"" is L,A,R,D,Y.

I'll go with ""HARDY"" to test H.

But wait: we have to consider that the word might be ""HARDY"" itself? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we could try a word that uses U? But we don't have a word that fits and has U.

For example, ""GUARD"": but U,A,R,D -> but A is in position 2? ""GUARD"" is G,U,A,R,D -> positions: G(1), U(2) -> but we need A in position 2? No, in ""GUARD"", A is in position 3? 
G(1), U(2), A(3) -> but we need A in position 2. So invalid.

We must have A in position 2 and R in position 3.

So, the word must be: [letter] A R [letter] [letter]

We have to choose from the available letters.

I think ""HARDY"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there is a word with U. 

""RARER"": but E is absent and R duplicate? Also, E absent.

""PARER"": E absent.

I don't think there is a common word with U that fits.

So, I'll go with ""HARDY"".

But wait: what about ""BARMY""? B(1), A(2), R(3), M(4), Y(5). 
This tests B, M, Y.

H is more common than B? In English, H is more frequent.

But we are testing H in position 1.

Similarly, ""HARDY"" tests H in position 1, D in position 4, Y in position 5.

We can also consider ""MARSH"": but S is absent.

Another: ""DARKY"": D(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), Y(5) -> but K is absent (from guess 3). So invalid.

""HAIRY"": H(1), A(2), I(3) -> I is absent, invalid.

So, ""HARDY"" seems good.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""HARDY"" is H,A,R,D,Y. 
- H: allowed
- D: allowed
- Y: allowed

So, it's valid.

Therefore, I choose ""HARDY"".

But wait: what if the word is ""HARDY""? Then we get it right.

But we are guessing, so it might be.

Alternatively, we could try a word that tests more vowels? But we only have position 4 and 5 to test, and the word must have a vowel? We have A already, and we know E,I,O are absent. So the only vowel left is U or Y. Position 4 and 5 could be U or Y.

For example, ""HARDY"" has Y, which is a vowel-like letter.

But we don't know if Y is in the word.

Another word: ""WARNS"": invalid because of N and S.

""BARNS"": N and S absent.

I think ""HARDY"" is a good guess.

So, let's go with ""HARDY"".

But note: we are using D and Y. We haven't tested D or Y.

We could test L and D? But we can't test both in one word without using a duplicate or missing position.

We have to choose one.

Another candidate: ""BARDY"" - not a common word.

I think ""HARDY"" is acceptable.

So, fourth guess: ""HARDY""

But wait: what about ""LARGE""? E absent.

I think we have to make this guess.

But note: we have to consider that the word might be ""LARGE"", but E is absent.

So, let's finalize: ""HARDY""

But wait, what about ""DARKY""? Invalid because of K and T absent? K and T are absent.

No.

So, I think ""HARDY"" is a good choice.

Therefore, the guess is ""HARDY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **A is confirmed in position 2** (from ""ratio"" and ""parks"" feedback: ✓).
- **R is confirmed in position 3** (from ""parks"" feedback: ✓).
- **Absent letters**: C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).
- **Present letters**: A (position 2), R (position 3), and one more letter (since the word is 5 letters).

### Current Knowledge:
- Secret word pattern: `[position1] A R [position4] [position5]`
- Position 1, 4, and 5 must be filled with letters not in the absent list.
- Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, V, W, Y, etc. (since C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S are absent).
- We need to test new common letters to identify the missing letters.

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **Focus on positions 1, 4, and 5**.
- Test high-frequency remaining letters (e.g., D, L, M, H, Y) to maximize information.
- Avoid reusing absent letters and avoid reusing R and A in positions 1, 4, or 5 (since we already know R is in position 3 and A is in position 2).
- Prioritize words that test three new letters in one guess to narrow down possibilities.

The word **""HARDY""** fits perfectly:
- **H** (new, tests position 1)
- **A** (fixed in position 2)
- **R** (fixed in position 3)
- **D** (new, tests position 4)
- **Y** (new, tests position 5)

This guess:
- Tests H, D, and Y (common letters).
- Avoids all absent letters.
- If incorrect, the feedback will reveal which of H, D, or Y (if any) are present and in the right positions.",Guess 4: hardy -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(x) Y(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not the second letter, and A is not the third letter.
 - The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

 We also know that the secret word is 5 letters long.

 We need to make a second guess that:
 - Does not use C, N, E (since they are absent)
 - Includes R and A (but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively)
 - We can try to use other common letters to get more information.

 Since R and A are in the word, we should try to place them in different positions.

 Let's think of a word that:
 - Has R and A, but R not in position 2 and A not in position 3.
 - Avoids C, N, E.

 Also, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Common consonants: S, T, L, etc.
 Vowels: We already have A, so we might try O or I.

 Let's try to form a word that has R and A, and also includes other common letters.

 Possibilities: 
 - We can try to put R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2)
 - We can try to put A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3)

 Since we have two letters that are present (R and A), we can try to use them in new positions and add three new letters.

 Let's consider the word ""ROAST"", but note that we have to avoid the positions we know:
 - R in ""ROAST"" is in position 1 -> that's allowed (since we only know it's not in position 2)
 - O is new
 - A is in position 2 -> but we don't have a restriction on A for position 2? Our restriction for A is that it cannot be in position 3. So position 2 is allowed for A.
 - S and T are new.

 However, we must note that the feedback for ""crane"" told us that R is in the word but not in position 2, and A is in the word but not in position 3. It doesn't say anything about other positions.

 But wait: in ""ROAST"", A is in position 2. We don't have any feedback that A cannot be in position 2. So that's okay.

 However, we must also consider that the word must be valid.

 But note: we have to avoid using C, N, E. ""ROAST"" doesn't have these, so it's okay.

 Let me check: R, O, A, S, T.

 But we have two known letters: R and A. We are including them. The new letters are O, S, T.

 This seems like a good candidate because it tests three new letters.

 Alternatively, we could try ""PARTY"", but that has T and Y. However, we don't know about T and Y.

 Another idea: ""RAISE"" -> but we have to avoid E? Actually, E is absent, so we cannot use E. So ""RAISE"" has E -> not allowed.

 How about ""RADIO""? 
 - R in position 1 -> allowed.
 - A in position 2 -> allowed (since we only know A isn't in position 3).
 - But we have D, I, O. And we avoid C, N, E.

 However, we are introducing three new letters: D, I, O.

 But note: we have two known letters (R and A) and three new ones. That's efficient.

 Another candidate: ""STARK"" -> but we don't have A in this word? We must include A because we know it's in the word. So we have to include A.

 So, we must have a word that includes R and A.

 Let me list a few words that include R and A, and avoid C, N, E:

 - ROAST: R, O, A, S, T -> positions: R(1), O(2), A(3), S(4), T(5)
   But note: in the first guess, A was in position 3 and we were told it's in the word but wrong position. 
   Now we are putting A in position 3 again? That would be the same position. We know A is not in position 3, so we cannot put A in position 3 again.

   So we must avoid putting A in position 3.

   In ""ROAST"", A is in position 3 -> not allowed.

 - How about ""RATIO""? 
   R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5). 
   Here, A is in position 2 -> allowed.

 - ""RADIO"": R(1), A(2), D(3), I(4), O(5) -> A in position 2 -> allowed.

 - ""ARTSY"": but A is in position 1 -> allowed, but the word has Y and S, and we don't know about them. Also, we have to avoid E? It doesn't have E.

 But note: we have to use valid words. ""ARTSY"" is valid? It's a word (meaning artistic). But let's see if we can get more common words.

 Another: ""PARTY"": P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), Y(5) -> A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 3 (allowed, because we only know it's not in position 2).

 But we have to avoid C, N, E. ""PARTY"" doesn't have these.

 However, we have two known letters (A and R) and we are putting R in position 3 and A in position 2. That's acceptable.

 But note: we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let me compare:

 Option 1: ""RADIO"" -> letters: R, A, D, I, O. We test D, I, O.
 Option 2: ""PARTY"" -> letters: P, A, R, T, Y. We test P, T, Y.
 Option 3: ""ROAST"" is invalid because A is in position 3.

 Another word: ""RAILS"" -> R(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), S(5). 
   A is in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed). We test I, L, S.

 But note: we have to avoid using the same letter twice? We are using R and A only once.

 We want to maximize new letters. Also, we want to cover common letters.

 Let's think about frequencies: 
   In English, S, T, L, O, I are common.

 So, ""RAILS"" uses R, A, I, L, S -> that's five new letters? Actually, we are using R and A, but we are testing three new ones.

 Alternatively, ""RADIO"" uses R, A, D, I, O -> testing D, I, O.

 ""PARTY"": P, A, R, T, Y -> testing P, T, Y.

 The most common letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. But we know E, N, C are absent. So we should test I, O, T, S, L.

 So, a word that includes R and A and tests I, O, T, S, L? That would be ideal.

 How about ""RASPY""? 
   R(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5). 
   A is in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed). We test S, P, Y.

 But we are missing O, I, T.

 Another: ""TRAIL"" -> T(1), R(2) -> wait, R is in position 2? But we know R is not in position 2? 
   Actually, the feedback for the first guess: R was in position 2 and we got a '-' meaning it is in the word but not in that position. 
   So we cannot put R in position 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it's not there. 
   So we should avoid putting R in position 2.

 In ""TRAIL"", R is in position 2 -> not allowed.

 How about ""STARK""? But we don't have A. We must include A.

 How about ""ARTSY""? A(1), R(2) -> R in position 2 is not allowed.

 How about ""RALLY""? 
   R(1), A(2), L(3), L(4), Y(5) -> but we have two L's? And we don't know if L is in the word. Also, we are repeating L? 
   But the word ""RALLY"" has two L's. We don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. But to maximize information, we might avoid repeats.

 Alternatively, ""RAILS"" (as I thought earlier) is without repeats and covers I, L, S.

 Another: ""RAPID"": R(1), A(2), P(3), I(4), D(5) -> A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed). We test P, I, D.

 But we are missing S, T, L.

 How about ""ROTLS""? Not a word.

 After considering, I think ""RAILS"" is a good candidate:
   R in position 1 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed), then I, L, S.

 But note: we have to make sure we don't use any of the absent letters (C, N, E). ""RAILS"" is clean.

 However, we have to consider that the secret word might have the letter in a different position. We are testing R in position 1 and A in position 2.

 Alternatively, we could try to put R in a different position, say position 4 or 5? 

 For example, ""PLANT"" has N and we know N is absent. So invalid.

 How about ""SPRAY"": 
   S(1), P(2), R(3), A(4), Y(5). 
   Here, R is in position 3 (allowed) and A is in position 4 (allowed, because we only know it's not in position 3). 
   We test S, P, Y.

 But we are not using the fact that we know A is in the word. We are using A.

 However, we are not using R in a new position? We are using R in position 3, which is new.

 But note: we have two known letters (R and A) and we are using them. Also, we are testing S, P, Y.

 But we are missing the opportunity to test more vowels? We already have A, and we know E is absent. So we might test O or I.

 Since we have two vowels already (A and ? we don't know), we might want to test O or I.

 Let me try to form a word that has R, A, and also O and I? 

 How about ""ORBIT""? 
   O(1), R(2) -> wait, R in position 2 is not allowed.

 How about ""ROBIN"": 
   R(1), O(2), B(3), I(4), N(5) -> but N is absent! We cannot use N.

 How about ""ROBIA""? Not a common word.

 How about ""RADIO"" (which we considered earlier) -> R(1), A(2), D(3), I(4), O(5). 
   This has A in position 2 (allowed) and R in position 1 (allowed). We test D, I, O.

 This seems good.

 But note: we are using R in position 1 and A in position 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Alternatively, we could try to put R in position 4 or 5? 

 For example, ""PLAIN"": 
   P(1), L(2), A(3) -> but A in position 3 is not allowed (we know A is not in position 3). So invalid.

 How about ""PARIS"": 
   P(1), A(2), R(3), I(4), S(5). 
   A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 3 (allowed). We test P, I, S.

 This is also a candidate.

 Now, which one to choose? 

 We want to test as many common letters as possible and avoid repeating known positions for R and A.

 Let me list the positions we are using for R and A in our candidates:

 - ""RADIO"": R(1), A(2)
 - ""PARTY"": P(1), A(2), R(3) -> note: R is in position 3 (which is new) and A in position 2 (new position for A).
 - ""RAILS"": R(1), A(2), then I(3), L(4), S(5) -> R in 1, A in 2, then I, L, S.

 The word ""PARTY"" uses the same positions for R and A as ""RADIO"" but then we test P, T, Y. 

 Since we have two letters that we know are in the word, we might want to try to place them in positions we haven't tried. 
 In the first guess, we had R in position 2 and A in position 3. Now we are trying A in position 2 and R in position 1 (in ""RADIO"") or in position 3 (in ""PARTY"").

 We don't have any information about position 1, so trying R in position 1 is a new position.

 Similarly, for A: we tried position 3 and now we try position 2.

 I think ""RADIO"" is a good choice because it tests three new vowels and consonants.

 But note: the secret word might not have O, I, D. We are testing them.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that uses more common consonants like S, T, L.

 How about ""STAIR"": 
   S(1), T(2), A(3) -> but A in position 3 is not allowed.

 How about ""TRAIL"": 
   T(1), R(2) -> R in position 2 is not allowed.

 How about ""RATIO"": 
   R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5) -> A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed). We test T, I, O.

 This is similar to ""RADIO"" but instead of D, we test T, I, O.

 ""RATIO"" is a valid word.

 Now, between ""RADIO"", ""RATIO"", ""PARTY"", and ""RAILS"", which one?

 We want to cover more common letters. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. 
 Since E, N, C are out, we can try T, O, I, S, L.

 ""RATIO"" has T, I, O -> that's three common letters.

 ""PARTY"" has P, T, Y -> Y is less common.

 ""RAILS"" has I, L, S -> that's three common letters.

 But note: in ""RAILS"", we are using R in position 1 and A in position 2. Then we have I, L, S in positions 3,4,5.

 In ""RATIO"", we have R in 1, A in 2, then T, I, O.

 I think ""RATIO"" is a good choice because it tests T, I, O which are very common.

 But wait: we have to avoid using letters we know are absent? We know C, N, E are absent, so ""RATIO"" is safe.

 Alternatively, we could try ""ROAST"" but we cannot because A would be in position 3 (which is forbidden).

 Another candidate: ""RASPY"" -> R(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5). 
   We test S, P, Y.

 But we are missing O and I.

 I think ""RATIO"" is a solid choice.

 However, note that the word ""RADIO"" is also good because it tests O and I.

 But let me check: the word ""RADIO"" is valid.

 Since we have two vowels already (A and we don't have any other vowels known), testing O and I is good.

 So, I'll go with ""RADIO"".

 But wait: what about the position of R? We know R is in the word but not in position 2. We are now putting R in position 1. 
 If the secret word has R in position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or an x? 

 Similarly, A in position 2: if it's correct, we get a check; if not, we get a minus or x? But we know A is in the word, so it won't be x.

 So, let's choose ""RADIO"".

 But note: we are using R and A again. That's okay because we are trying to find their correct positions.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't reuse R and A? But we have to include them because we know they are in the word. 

 Actually, we must include them because we are trying to get more information about their positions.

 So, I'll go with ""RADIO"".

 However, let me think of a word that uses R and A and also includes T, O, I? But we can't have all three? 

 How about ""TRAIL""? We can't because R must be included and we can't put R in position 2.

 Another: ""ARTIS"" -> not a word.

 I think ""RADIO"" is a good choice.

 But wait: what about ""RAINS""? 
   R(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), S(5) -> but N is absent! We cannot use N.

 So, we must avoid N.

 Therefore, ""RADIO"" is valid.

 Let me confirm: 
   R in position 1: we don't know if that's allowed? It is, because we only know R is not in position 2.
   A in position 2: we don't have a restriction for A in position 2? Only that it is not in position 3.

 So, I'll go with ""RADIO"".

 But note: we are using D. We don't know about D. It might be common or not.

 Alternatively, we could use ""ROAST"" if we were allowed to put A in a new position? But we cannot put A in position 3.

 How about ""RALLY""? 
   R(1), A(2), L(3), L(4), Y(5) -> but we have two L's. And we don't know if the word has two L's. Also, we are not testing as many new letters.

 I think ""RADIO"" is better.

 Let me search for a word that has R, A, T, O, I? 

 How about ""RATIO"" (which is the same as ""RADIO"" but rearranged). 
   R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5)

 This is a valid word and tests T, I, O.

 I think ""RATIO"" is slightly better because it has T and I (which are very common) and O.

 So, I'll go with ""RATIO"".

 But wait: in ""RATIO"", we are putting A in position 2 and R in position 1. 

 We know that R is in the word but not in position 2. We are now testing R in position 1. 
 If it's correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus.

 Similarly, A in position 2: we don't have a restriction for A in position 2, so we can test it.

 Therefore, I choose ""RATIO"".

 But note: we are using R and A again. That's okay.

 So, second guess: ""RATIO""

<guess>ratio</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, N, E** are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **R** is present but not in position 2 (marked ""-"").
- **A** is present but not in position 3 (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **R** and **A** (since they are confirmed present).
- Avoid **C, N, E** (absent letters).
- Test new common letters (e.g., **T, I, O**) to gather more information.
- **R** cannot be in position 2, and **A** cannot be in position 3.

The word **""RATIO""** fits these criteria:
- **R** is in position 1 (new position, not 2).
- **A** is in position 2 (new position, not 3).
- Introduces **T, I, O** (common letters not yet tested).
- Valid 5-letter word, avoiding forbidden letters.

This guess efficiently tests new positions for known letters and explores additional common letters.

<guess>ratio</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (absent)
- R: - (present, but not in position 2)
- A: - (present, but not in position 3)
- N: x (absent)
- E: x (absent)

Guess 2: ""ratio""
- R: - (present, but not in position 1)  [since we got '-' for R in position 1]
- A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)      [we got '✓' for A in position 2]
- T: x (absent)
- I: x (absent)
- O: x (absent)

So, from this, we know:

1. The secret word has the letter 'A' in position 2. (because we got a check for A in position 2 in ""ratio"")
2. The letter 'R' is present, but not in position 1 (from ""ratio"") and not in position 2 (from ""crane""). So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
3. The following letters are absent: C, N, E, T, I, O.

Also, from ""crane"", we know that A is not in position 3 (but now we know it's in position 2, so that's consistent).

Now, the secret word has the form: _ A _ _ _

And the letters we know are present: R (in position 3,4, or 5) and (we don't know about duplicates, but so far no duplicates).

We also know the absent letters: C, N, E, T, I, O.

We need to make a third guess that:
- Has 'A' in position 2 (fixed)
- Includes 'R' in one of the positions 3,4,5 (but not 1 or 2)
- Avoids the absent letters: C, N, E, T, I, O
- We can use other common letters to test.

Since we know A is in position 2, we can fix that.

Let's think of words that have the form: _ A _ _ _ and contain the letter R in position 3,4, or 5.

We also want to test other common letters that we haven't tried yet. The remaining common letters include: S, L, U, D, M, P, B, G, etc.

Let's try to form a word:

Option 1: R in position 3: _ A R _ _
We need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth positions with letters that are not in the absent list and form a valid word.

Possible letters: We can use B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Example: ""BARMY"" -> B(1), A(2), R(3), M(4), Y(5). But we don't know about B, M, Y.

But we need to test more letters. However, we must include R in position 3.

Another: ""PARKS"": P(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5). This tests P, K, S.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""PARKS"" uses P, A, R, K, S. None of these are in the absent list (C,N,E,T,I,O). So it's valid.

Option 2: R in position 4: _ A _ R _
Example: ""FAIRY"" -> but we have I and Y? I is absent, so invalid. 
""HAIRY"" -> same issue, I is absent.
""LAIRD"": L(1), A(2), I(3) -> I is absent, invalid.
""MARRY"": M(1), A(2), R(3) -> wait, R is in position 3, not 4. 
We need R in position 4: so _ A _ R _

Another: ""BASER"" -> but E is absent, invalid.
""PAPER"" -> E absent, invalid.
""SAVOR"" -> S(1), A(2), V(3), O(4), R(5) -> but O is absent and R is in position 5, not 4. 
We need R in position 4: so the word must have R in the fourth position.

How about ""LAPSE"": but E and S? E is absent, so invalid.
""MAPLE"": E absent, invalid.

It's hard to find a word with R in position 4 without using absent letters. 

Option 3: R in position 5: _ A _ _ R
Example: ""BAKER"": E absent, invalid.
""MAKER"": E absent, invalid.
""FILER"": I and E absent, invalid.
""HALMR"": not a word.

This is difficult. So maybe R in position 3 or 4 is easier.

Let me try R in position 3: _ A R _ _

We need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth positions.

Possible words:
- ""BARMY"": B(1), A(2), R(3), M(4), Y(5) -> tests B, M, Y
- ""CARDS"": but C is absent, invalid.
- ""PARKS"": P(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5) -> tests P, K, S
- ""MARKS"": M(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5) -> tests M, K, S
- ""BARKS"": B(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5) -> tests B, K, S

All these are valid and use only allowed letters.

We also have the option to test more vowels? But we know the word has A, and we don't have any other vowels known (since E,I,O are absent, and we have A). So we might test U? But we don't know if U is in the word.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we need to be efficient.

We can also consider words that don't have R in position 3? But we know R must be in 3,4, or 5. Since position 4 and 5 are harder, let's stick with position 3.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test common letters and maximize information.

We haven't tested: S, L, D, U, P, M, B, G, etc.

""PARKS"" tests P, K, S.
""BARKS"" tests B, K, S.
""MARKS"" tests M, K, S.

The letter S is common, so testing S is good. K is less common, but we have to use it because we are trying to place R.

But note: we are not sure if the word has S or not. We are testing it.

Alternatively, we could try a word that uses a different set of letters to cover more ground.

But we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

Another idea: we know the word has R and A. We have A fixed at position 2. So the word is ?A??

We can try to use a word that has R in position 4 or 5, but we had trouble finding valid words without absent letters.

Let me try R in position 4 again: 
- _ A _ R _
We need a word: 
  First letter: not C,N,E,T,I,O -> so we can use B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.
  Fourth letter: R
  Fifth letter: not absent.

Example: ""BALMY"": B(1), A(2), L(3), M(4), Y(5) -> but this doesn't have R? We need R in position 4. 
""BALMY"" has M in position 4, not R.

How about ""SALAD"": but two A's? And D. But we have A in position 2 and then again? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are avoiding E? ""SALAD"" has two A's and D. But we don't know about duplicates. Also, we have to avoid E? It doesn't have E, but it has A twice and D. 

But we are not sure if the word has two A's. We know at least one A is in position 2. It might have another A? But we don't know.

We can try, but let's avoid duplicates for now to get more information.

Another word: ""PALER"": but E is absent, invalid.
""MANOR"": M(1), A(2), N(3) -> N is absent! Invalid.
""FAVOR"": F(1), A(2), V(3), O(4), R(5) -> but O is absent and R is in position 5, not 4. 
We need R in position 4: so the fourth letter must be R.

How about ""LAPSE"": but E is absent.

This is difficult. So maybe R in position 5 is easier?

But we already have a candidate for R in position 5: ""BAKER"" is invalid because of E. 

""MAKER"": same.

""FILER"": invalid.

""HALMR"": not a word.

So perhaps R is more likely in position 3? 

Let me think of common words: 
- ""PARIS"": but we have I? I is absent, and also we have I in position 4? But I is absent, so invalid.
- ""BARON"": O is absent, invalid.

Another: ""CARDS"": C absent, invalid.

So, let's stick with R in position 3.

Now, among the candidates: ""BARKS"", ""PARKS"", ""MARKS"", ""BARMY"", etc.

We want to test letters that are more common. S is very common, so we can test a word that includes S.

We also have L, which is common.

How about ""BARKS"": B(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5). 
This tests B, K, S.

But we have to consider that the word might have B, K, S.

Alternatively, we can try ""LARGE"": but E is absent and also G? But E is absent.

How about ""MARSH"": M(1), A(2), R(3), S(4), H(5). 
This tests M, S, H.

But we don't know about H.

Another: ""PARKS"" is similar but with P instead of M.

We can also consider ""R"" in position 4? But we couldn't find a word. 

What about ""GAUZE"": but E and Z? E is absent, invalid.

I think we have to choose from the words we have.

But note: we have another piece of information. In the first guess, we had R in position 2 (which was wrong) and in the second guess we had R in position 1 (which was wrong). Now we are trying R in position 3.

We also know that A is in position 2.

So, let's list the possibilities for the secret word:

Position 1: cannot be C,N,E,T,I,O,C,N,E,T,I,O -> so we can use B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.
Position 2: A (fixed)
Position 3: could be R? or another letter? But we know R is in the word and not in 1 or 2, so 3,4,5.
Position 4 and 5: similarly.

We need to test the position of R and also test new letters.

We have 3 positions to fill: 1, 3,4,5? Actually, position 2 is fixed as A, so we have positions 1,3,4,5 to fill with letters that include R (in 3,4,5) and two more letters? Because we have 5 letters: position1,2,3,4,5 -> we know 2 is A, so we need to test the other positions.

We know the word has R and A. So the other three positions must be filled with letters that are not in the absent list.

We are going to test multiple new letters.

I think ""PARKS"" is a good choice: it tests P, K, S. K is less common, but S is very common.

Alternatively, ""BARKS"" tests B, K, S.

Or ""MARSH"" tests M, S, H.

How about ""LARGE""? But E is absent.

Another word: ""DARKY"": D(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), Y(5). 
This tests D, K, Y.

But Y is less common.

I think ""PARKS"" is a solid choice.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have S. We haven't tested S yet.

So, let's go with ""PARKS"".

But wait: we are putting R in position 3. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't have R in position 3? But we don't have many options.

Another candidate: ""FARCE"": but C and E absent, invalid.

How about ""HARPY"": H(1), A(2), R(3), P(4), Y(5). 
This tests H, P, Y.

But we are missing S.

I think ""PARKS"" is better than ""HARPY"" because S is more common.

But let me see: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""PARKS"" uses P, A, R, K, S. All are allowed.

So, I'll go with ""PARKS"".

But note: we are using K. If the word has K, we'll know. Similarly, P and S.

We might also consider ""BARMY"", but Y is less common.

Another word: ""GARDE"": but E is absent.

I think ""PARKS"" is a valid choice.

But wait: what about the possibility that R is in position 4? We didn't find a word, but maybe there is one.

How about ""WASPY"": W(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5) -> but this doesn't have R? We must include R because we know it's in the word. So we have to include R.

So, we must have R in position 3,4, or 5.

Another word with R in position 4: 
- ""BAJRA""? Not common.
- ""MAJAR"": not common.

How about ""SABER"": but E is absent.

I think we have to go with R in position 3.

So, I choose ""PARKS"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not repeating a position that we know is wrong for R? We are putting R in position 3. We don't have any feedback that position 3 is wrong for R? We only know that position 1 and 2 are wrong for R.

So, let's go with ""PARKS"".

But wait: what about the letter K? We don't know about K. It might be common or not.

Alternatively, we could try a word that uses L, which is very common. 

How about ""LARGE"": but E is absent.

How about ""LARKS"": L(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5). 
This tests L, K, S.

Or ""WARKS"": not common.

I think ""PARKS"" is acceptable.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""PARKS"" is P-A-R-K-S. 
P: not absent? We haven't tested P. 
K: not tested.
S: not tested.

So, let's use ""PARKS"".

But wait: what about the possibility that the word has duplicate letters? We don't have any indication, so we can ignore for now.

Another candidate: ""BARGE"": but E is absent.

I think we have to go with it.

But note: we have to consider that the word might be ""PARIS"", but I is absent and also we have I in position 4? No, ""PARIS"" has I and O? O is absent.

So, let's finalizes: ""PARKS""

But wait, what about ""R"" in position 3? We are using R in position 3. If the secret word has R in position 3, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and then we know R must be in position 4 or 5.

So, let's do it.

Guess: ""PARKS""

But note: we are putting R in position 3. We don't have any feedback that position 3 is wrong for R? Actually, we only know that position 1 and 2 are wrong for R. Position 3 might be correct.

So, we are testing position 3 for R.

If we get a check for R, then we know R is in position 3. If we get a minus, then R is in position 4 or 5.

Similarly, we test P, K, S.

So, it's a good test.

Therefore, I choose ""PARKS"".

But let me check if there's a word that tests more common letters. 

Another idea: ""SARIS"": S(1), A(2), R(3), I(4) -> I is absent, invalid.

""SAVOR"": O absent.

I think ""PARKS"" is fine.

So, the guess is ""PARKS"".

But note: we are using K. If we don't want to use K, we could try ""BARKS"" (B instead of P). But P is more common than B? In wordle, P is common.

Actually, in wordle, S is the most common, then L, then ... then K, then P, etc.

But we are testing S at the end, which is common.

So, I'll go with ""PARKS"".

But wait: what about ""R"" in position 3? We are testing it.

So, let's output ""PARKS"".

But note: we have to make sure we don't use absent letters. ""PARKS"" has P, A, R, K, S. None of these are in the absent list (C,N,E,T,I,O).

So, it's valid.

Therefore, the third guess is ""PARKS"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R and A are present but not in positions 2 or 3, respectively. C, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""ratio"")**: A is correct in position 2 (✓). R is present but not in position 1 (-). T, I, O are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. **A is fixed in position 2** (from ""ratio"" feedback: ✓).
2. **R is present** but cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from both guesses). It must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
3. **Absent letters**: C, N, E, T, I, O (cannot be used).
4. **Unknown positions**: 1, 3, 4, 5 need to be solved, with R one of them (in 3,4, or 5).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Must include R** in position 3, 4, or 5 (since positions 1 and 2 are invalid for R).
- **A must be in position 2** (fixed).
- **Avoid absent letters** (C, N, E, T, I, O).
- Test new common letters (e.g., S, L, P, M) to gather more information.
- Prioritize words with R in position 3 (as position 4/5 is harder to form valid words without absent letters).

The word **""PARKS""** fits perfectly:
- **P** (new letter, tests position 1)
- **A** (fixed in position 2)
- **R** (placed in position 3 to test if it's correct)
- **K** (new letter, tests position 4)
- **S** (new letter, tests position 5)

This guess:
- Tests R in position 3 (if correct, we get ✓; if not, we learn R is in 4/5).
- Tests three new common letters (P, K, S).
- Avoids all absent letters.

<guess>parks</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(x)
Guess 3: parks -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) K(x) S(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent (x)
- R: present, wrong position (-)
- A: present, wrong position (-)
- N: absent (x)
- E: absent (x)

Guess 2: ""ratio""
- R: present, wrong position (-)  [now we know R is not in position 1 or 2]
- A: correct (✓) in position 2
- T: absent (x)
- I: absent (x)
- O: absent (x)

Guess 3: ""parks""
- P: absent (x)
- A: correct (✓) in position 2
- R: correct (✓) in position 3
- K: absent (x)
- S: absent (x)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. The secret word has:
   - A in position 2 (from guess 2 and 3)
   - R in position 3 (from guess 3: R is correct in position 3)

2. So the word so far is: _ A R _ _

3. We know the following letters are absent: C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S.

4. We also know that R is in position 3, so we don't need to test R again.

5. We know A is in position 2, so we don't need to test A.

6. We need to find the letters for positions 1, 4, and 5.

7. The word must contain only letters that are not in the absent list. The absent letters are: C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S.

8. The remaining letters that are possible: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, V, W, Y, and possibly others.

Now, we need to form a word that fits: _ A R _ _

We have to fill positions 1, 4, and 5 with letters from the remaining set, avoiding the absent letters.

Let's think of common words that fit the pattern:

- Position 1: a consonant or vowel? We can try common letters.

Possible words:

- ""BARGE"": but E is absent -> invalid.
- ""BARRE"": has E and two R's? E absent, and also we have R in position 3, but position 2 is A, so ""BARRE"" would be B,A,R,R,E -> but E is absent and also we have two R's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, E is absent so invalid.

We must avoid E.

- ""MARRY"": M,A,R,R,Y -> but we have two R's? And Y. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are using R again? But we know R is in position 3, so if we put R in position 4, that would be a duplicate? But we don't know if the word has two R's.

But note: we have only one R so far in the feedback? Actually, we don't know. The feedback doesn't show duplicates. But we can try.

However, we are trying to get information. Using a word with duplicate R might not be efficient because if we get a check for one R, we don't know about the other.

But we are forced to use the pattern _ A R _ _

We need to test letters for positions 1,4,5.

We can try to use a word that has new letters and avoids duplicates for now.

Let me list possible words:

- ""BARMY"": B(1), A(2), R(3), M(4), Y(5) -> tests B, M, Y. But we don't know about duplicates? And we are using M and Y.

But we don't have any duplicate in this word.

- ""HARPY"": but H(1), A(2), R(3), P(4), Y(5) -> but P is absent (from guess 3: P is absent). So invalid.

- ""LARDY"": L(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5) -> tests L, D, Y. L, D, Y are not in the absent list.

This seems valid.

- ""MARRY"": M(1), A(2), R(3), R(4), Y(5) -> but this has two R's. We know R is in position 3, so if we put R in position 4, we are testing for a duplicate. But we don't know if the word has two R's. Also, we are using R again, which we already know is in the word. It might be better to test new letters.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another word: ""WARTY"": W(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), Y(5) -> but T is absent (from guess 2: T is absent). So invalid.

""CARDS"": C absent.

""BARDS"": C absent.

""FARGO"": F(1), A(2), R(3), G(4), O(5) -> O is absent, invalid.

""MARSH"": S absent? S is absent from guess 3. So invalid.

""LARVA"": L(1), A(2), R(3), V(4), A(5) -> but we have two A's? And we don't know about duplicates. Also, A is already in position 2, so if we put A in position 5, we are testing for a duplicate. But we know A is in position 2, so if we get a check for A in position 5, that would be a duplicate. But we don't know if there is a duplicate.

However, we are trying to get information. Using a word with duplicate might not be efficient.

But we have to fill the positions.

Another word: ""DARBY"": D(1), A(2), R(3), B(4), Y(5). 
This tests D, B, Y.

But we don't know about duplicates? And we are not using any duplicate.

""DARBY"" is a word? It means a type of hawk, I think.

But let's see: we have to avoid absent letters. D, B, Y are not absent? 
Absent letters: C,N,E,T,I,O,P,K,S. So D, B, Y are allowed.

But we have to test new letters.

We can also consider ""HARDY"": H(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5). 
This tests H, D, Y.

But we don't know about duplicates.

Alternatively, ""LARDY"" as I thought earlier: L(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5). 
This tests L, D, Y.

""LARDY"" is a valid word (meaning fat or oily).

Another: ""MARDY"": M(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5). 
Similarly, tests M, D, Y.

But we don't know about duplicates.

We can also try to use a word that has a vowel in position 4 or 5? We have only position 1,4,5 to fill. We know the word has at least A and R, and we have three positions to fill.

But we don't know if the word has more vowels? We have A already, and we know E,I,O are absent. So the only vowel left is U? And sometimes Y.

So, the word might have U or Y as a vowel? But in position 4 or 5.

For example, ""BARUM"": but U? And M. But ""BARUM"" is not common.

""WARNS"": but W(1), A(2), R(3), N(4), S(5) -> N and S are absent, invalid.

""CARDS"": C absent.

I think we have to accept that we might have to test with duplicates or use Y.

But let me think of words without duplicates:

- ""BALMY"": but L and M? But ""BALMY"" is B,A,L,M,Y. But we need R in position 3? This is B,A,L,M,Y -> no R. So invalid.

We must have R in position 3.

So, the pattern is fixed: _ A R _ _

We need to fill the blanks with letters not in {C,N,E,T,I,O,P,K,S} and not R or A (but we can use other letters, but we don't have to avoid R and A in the blanks? Actually, we can use them if we suspect duplicates, but we have no evidence of duplicates so far. So we should avoid using R and A in the blanks to test new letters.

So, positions 1,4,5 must be filled with letters that are not in the absent list and not R or A? Not necessarily, but if we use R or A in these positions, we might get a duplicate, but we don't know if the word has a duplicate. So to test efficiently, we should use new letters.

But we have to form a valid word.

So, let's look for words that start with a consonant (or vowel) and then R, then two more letters.

Possible words:

- ""DARBY"" (if accepted): D, A, R, B, Y -> tests D, B, Y.
- ""HARDY"": H, A, R, D, Y -> tests H, D, Y.
- ""LARDY"": L, A, R, D, Y -> tests L, D, Y.
- ""MARDY"": M, A, R, D, Y -> tests M, D, Y.
- ""WARLY"": W, A, R, L, Y -> tests W, L, Y.
- ""BARNY"": B, A, R, N, Y -> but N is absent, invalid.
- ""JARUL"": not a word.

We can also try ""FARCE"", but C and E absent.

How about ""HAREM"": but E is absent and M? ""HAREM"" has E, invalid.

""BARRE"": has E, invalid.

""CARME"": C absent.

I think ""LARDY"" is a good candidate: it tests L, D, Y.

But we have to consider that the word might have duplicate R? We know R is in position 3, but if we put R in position 4? We are not doing that in this word.

In ""LARDY"", we have no duplicate.

Similarly, ""HARDY"" has no duplicate.

But we are testing the same letters: for position 1, we test H, M, B, W, etc.

We need to choose one.

But note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on the fourth guess. We can try to cover more common letters.

The most common letters left: L, D, Y, M, H, W, etc.

""LARDY"" tests L, D, Y.

""HARDY"" tests H, D, Y.

""MARDY"" tests M, D, Y.

I think ""LARDY"" is a good choice because L is a very common letter.

But we have to make sure that we are not missing something.

Another word: ""BARNY"": invalid because of N.

""JARUL"" not a word.

""VARNA"": but N absent.

""GAUZE"": E absent.

I think we have to go with one of these.

But wait: what about ""DARBS""? Not a word.

Or ""LARVA"": but V and A again? And duplicate A? But we don't know. And ""LARVA"" has V and A, but we are not testing duplicates? Actually, we are testing L, A, V, R, A? Wait, ""LARVA"" is L,A,R,V,A -> so positions: L(1), A(2), R(3), V(4), A(5). 
This has duplicate A. But we know A is in position 2, so if we put A in position 5, we are testing for a duplicate. But we don't know if the word has two A's.

However, we are on the fourth guess, and we have to test. But using a duplicate might not give us new information if there is only one A.

But we don't know. So it's risky.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have A in position 5? But we don't know.

Given the constraints, I think ""LARDY"" is a safe choice.

But let me check if there is a word that tests more common letters.

How about ""HARDY"" or ""LARDY"".

I think both are good. Let's choose ""HARDY"" because H is a common letter.

But we have to avoid the absent letters. ""HARDY"" uses H, A, R, D, Y. 
- H: not tested
- D: not tested
- Y: not tested

And it fits the pattern.

Similarly, ""LARDY"" uses L, A, R, D, Y.

Now, which one? H vs L.

H is more common than L? In English, H is more common than L? Actually, L is more common.

But we are testing two letters: one in position 1 and one in position 4 and 5.

We can also consider ""WARTY"": but T is absent.

""BARFY"": not common.

I think both are valid. Let's pick ""HARDY"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not using absent letters. ""HARDY"" is H,A,R,D,Y. 
- H: not absent? No, H has not been tested.
- D: not absent.
- Y: not absent.

So, it's valid.

Similarly, ""LARDY"" is L,A,R,D,Y.

I'll go with ""HARDY"" to test H.

But wait: we have to consider that the word might be ""HARDY"" itself? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we could try a word that uses U? But we don't have a word that fits and has U.

For example, ""GUARD"": but U,A,R,D -> but A is in position 2? ""GUARD"" is G,U,A,R,D -> positions: G(1), U(2) -> but we need A in position 2? No, in ""GUARD"", A is in position 3? 
G(1), U(2), A(3) -> but we need A in position 2. So invalid.

We must have A in position 2 and R in position 3.

So, the word must be: [letter] A R [letter] [letter]

We have to choose from the available letters.

I think ""HARDY"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there is a word with U. 

""RARER"": but E is absent and R duplicate? Also, E absent.

""PARER"": E absent.

I don't think there is a common word with U that fits.

So, I'll go with ""HARDY"".

But wait: what about ""BARMY""? B(1), A(2), R(3), M(4), Y(5). 
This tests B, M, Y.

H is more common than B? In English, H is more frequent.

But we are testing H in position 1.

Similarly, ""HARDY"" tests H in position 1, D in position 4, Y in position 5.

We can also consider ""MARSH"": but S is absent.

Another: ""DARKY"": D(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), Y(5) -> but K is absent (from guess 3). So invalid.

""HAIRY"": H(1), A(2), I(3) -> I is absent, invalid.

So, ""HARDY"" seems good.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""HARDY"" is H,A,R,D,Y. 
- H: allowed
- D: allowed
- Y: allowed

So, it's valid.

Therefore, I choose ""HARDY"".

But wait: what if the word is ""HARDY""? Then we get it right.

But we are guessing, so it might be.

Alternatively, we could try a word that tests more vowels? But we only have position 4 and 5 to test, and the word must have a vowel? We have A already, and we know E,I,O are absent. So the only vowel left is U or Y. Position 4 and 5 could be U or Y.

For example, ""HARDY"" has Y, which is a vowel-like letter.

But we don't know if Y is in the word.

Another word: ""WARNS"": invalid because of N and S.

""BARNS"": N and S absent.

I think ""HARDY"" is a good guess.

So, let's go with ""HARDY"".

But note: we are using D and Y. We haven't tested D or Y.

We could test L and D? But we can't test both in one word without using a duplicate or missing position.

We have to choose one.

Another candidate: ""BARDY"" - not a common word.

I think ""HARDY"" is acceptable.

So, fourth guess: ""HARDY""

But wait: what about ""LARGE""? E absent.

I think we have to make this guess.

But note: we have to consider that the word might be ""LARGE"", but E is absent.

So, let's finalize: ""HARDY""

But wait, what about ""DARKY""? Invalid because of K and T absent? K and T are absent.

No.

So, I think ""HARDY"" is a good choice.

Therefore, the guess is ""HARDY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **A is confirmed in position 2** (from ""ratio"" and ""parks"" feedback: ✓).
- **R is confirmed in position 3** (from ""parks"" feedback: ✓).
- **Absent letters**: C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).
- **Present letters**: A (position 2), R (position 3), and one more letter (since the word is 5 letters).

### Current Knowledge:
- Secret word pattern: `[position1] A R [position4] [position5]`
- Position 1, 4, and 5 must be filled with letters not in the absent list.
- Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, V, W, Y, etc. (since C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S are absent).
- We need to test new common letters to identify the missing letters.

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **Focus on positions 1, 4, and 5**.
- Test high-frequency remaining letters (e.g., D, L, M, H, Y) to maximize information.
- Avoid reusing absent letters and avoid reusing R and A in positions 1, 4, or 5 (since we already know R is in position 3 and A is in position 2).
- Prioritize words that test three new letters in one guess to narrow down possibilities.

The word **""HARDY""** fits perfectly:
- **H** (new, tests position 1)
- **A** (fixed in position 2)
- **R** (fixed in position 3)
- **D** (new, tests position 4)
- **Y** (new, tests position 5)

This guess:
- Tests H, D, and Y (common letters).
- Avoids all absent letters.
- If incorrect, the feedback will reveal which of H, D, or Y (if any) are present and in the right positions.

It doesn\'t say anything about other positions.\n\n But wait: in ""ROAST"", A is in position 2. We don\'t have any feedback that A cannot be in position 2. So that\'s okay.\n\n However, we must also consider that the word must be valid.\n\n But note: we have to avoid using C, N, E. ""ROAST"" doesn\'t have these, so it\'s okay.\n\n Let me check: R, O, A, S, T.\n\n But we have two known letters: R and A. We are including them. The new letters are O, S, T.\n\n This seems like a good candidate because it tests three new letters.\n\n Alternatively, we could try ""PARTY"", but that has T and Y. However, we don\'t know about T and Y.\n\n Another idea: ""RAISE"" -> but we have to avoid E? Actually, E is absent, so we cannot use E. So ""RAISE"" has E -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""RADIO""? \n - R in position 1 -> allowed.\n - A in position 2 -> allowed (since we only know A isn\'t in position 3).\n - But we have D, I, O. And we avoid C, N, E.\n\n However, we are introducing three new letters: D, I, O.\n\n But note: we have two known letters (R and A) and three new ones. That\'s efficient.\n\n Another candidate: ""STARK"" -> but we don\'t have A in this word? We must include A because we know it\'s in the word. So we have to include A.\n\n So, we must have a word that includes R and A.\n\n Let me list a few words that include R and A, and avoid C, N, E:\n\n - ROAST: R, O, A, S, T -> positions: R(1), O(2), A(3), S(4), T(5)\n   But note: in the first guess, A was in position 3 and we were told it\'s in the word but wrong position. \n   Now we are putting A in position 3 again? That would be the same position. We know A is not in position 3, so we cannot put A in position 3 again.\n\n   So we must avoid putting A in position 3.\n\n   In ""ROAST"", A is in position 3 -> not allowed.\n\n - How about ""RATIO""? \n   R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5). \n   Here, A is in position 2 -> allowed.\n\n - ""RADIO"": R(1), A(2), D(3), I(4), O(5) -> A in position 2 -> allowed.\n\n - ""ARTSY"": but A is in position 1 -> allowed, but the word has Y and S, and we don\'t know about them. Also, we have to avoid E? It doesn\'t have E.\n\n But note: we have to use valid words. ""ARTSY"" is valid? It\'s a word (meaning artistic). But let\'s see if we can get more common words.\n\n Another: ""PARTY"": P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), Y(5) -> A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 3 (allowed, because we only know it\'s not in position 2).\n\n But we have to avoid C, N, E. ""PARTY"" doesn\'t have these.\n\n However, we have two known letters (A and R) and we are putting R in position 3 and A in position 2. That\'s acceptable.\n\n But note: we also want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n Let me compare:\n\n Option 1: ""RADIO"" -> letters: R, A, D, I, O. We test D, I, O.\n Option 2: ""PARTY"" -> letters: P, A, R, T, Y. We test P, T, Y.\n Option 3: ""ROAST"" is invalid because A is in position 3.\n\n Another word: ""RAILS"" -> R(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), S(5). \n   A is in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed). We test I, L, S.\n\n But note: we have to avoid using the same letter twice? We are using R and A only once.\n\n We want to maximize new letters. Also, we want to cover common letters.\n\n Let\'s think about frequencies: \n   In English, S, T, L, O, I are common.\n\n So, ""RAILS"" uses R, A, I, L, S -> that\'s five new letters? Actually, we are using R and A, but we are testing three new ones.\n\n Alternatively, ""RADIO"" uses R, A, D, I, O -> testing D, I, O.\n\n ""PARTY"": P, A, R, T, Y -> testing P, T, Y.\n\n The most common letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. But we know E, N, C are absent. So we should test I, O, T, S, L.\n\n So, a word that includes R and A and tests I, O, T, S, L? That would be ideal.\n\n How about ""RASPY""? \n   R(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5). \n   A is in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed). We test S, P, Y.\n\n But we are missing O, I, T.\n\n Another: ""TRAIL"" -> T(1), R(2) -> wait, R is in position 2? But we know R is not in position 2? \n   Actually, the feedback for the first guess: R was in position 2 and we got a \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not in that position. \n   So we cannot put R in position 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it\'s not there. \n   So we should avoid putting R in position 2.\n\n In ""TRAIL"", R is in position 2 -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""STARK""? But we don\'t have A. We must include A.\n\n How about ""ARTSY""? A(1), R(2) -> R in position 2 is not allowed.\n\n How about ""RALLY""? \n   R(1), A(2), L(3), L(4), Y(5) -> but we have two L\'s? And we don\'t know if L is in the word. Also, we are repeating L? \n   But the word ""RALLY"" has two L\'s. We don\'t know if the secret word has repeated letters. But to maximize information, we might avoid repeats.\n\n Alternatively, ""RAILS"" (as I thought earlier) is without repeats and covers I, L, S.\n\n Another: ""RAPID"": R(1), A(2), P(3), I(4), D(5) -> A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed). We test P, I, D.\n\n But we are missing S, T, L.\n\n How about ""ROTLS""? Not a word.\n\n After considering, I think ""RAILS"" is a good candidate:\n   R in position 1 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed), then I, L, S.\n\n But note: we have to make sure we don\'t use any of the absent letters (C, N, E). ""RAILS"" is clean.\n\n However, we have to consider that the secret word might have the letter in a different position. We are testing R in position 1 and A in position 2.\n\n Alternatively, we could try to put R in a different position, say position 4 or 5? \n\n For example, ""PLANT"" has N and we know N is absent. So invalid.\n\n How about ""SPRAY"": \n   S(1), P(2), R(3), A(4), Y(5). \n   Here, R is in position 3 (allowed) and A is in position 4 (allowed, because we only know it\'s not in position 3). \n   We test S, P, Y.\n\n But we are not using the fact that we know A is in the word. We are using A.\n\n However, we are not using R in a new position? We are using R in position 3, which is new.\n\n But note: we have two known letters (R and A) and we are using them. Also, we are testing S, P, Y.\n\n But we are missing the opportunity to test more vowels? We already have A, and we know E is absent. So we might test O or I.\n\n Since we have two vowels already (A and ? we don\'t know), we might want to test O or I.\n\n Let me try to form a word that has R, A, and also O and I? \n\n How about ""ORBIT""? \n   O(1), R(2) -> wait, R in position 2 is not allowed.\n\n How about ""ROBIN"": \n   R(1), O(2), B(3), I(4), N(5) -> but N is absent! We cannot use N.\n\n How about ""ROBIA""? Not a common word.\n\n How about ""RADIO"" (which we considered earlier) -> R(1), A(2), D(3), I(4), O(5). \n   This has A in position 2 (allowed) and R in position 1 (allowed). We test D, I, O.\n\n This seems good.\n\n But note: we are using R in position 1 and A in position 2. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\n Alternatively, we could try to put R in position 4 or 5? \n\n For example, ""PLAIN"": \n   P(1), L(2), A(3) -> but A in position 3 is not allowed (we know A is not in position 3). So invalid.\n\n How about ""PARIS"": \n   P(1), A(2), R(3), I(4), S(5). \n   A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 3 (allowed). We test P, I, S.\n\n This is also a candidate.\n\n Now, which one to choose? \n\n We want to test as many common letters as possible and avoid repeating known positions for R and A.\n\n Let me list the positions we are using for R and A in our candidates:\n\n - ""RADIO"": R(1), A(2)\n - ""PARTY"": P(1), A(2), R(3) -> note: R is in position 3 (which is new) and A in position 2 (new position for A).\n - ""RAILS"": R(1), A(2), then I(3), L(4), S(5) -> R in 1, A in 2, then I, L, S.\n\n The word ""PARTY"" uses the same positions for R and A as ""RADIO"" but then we test P, T, Y. \n\n Since we have two letters that we know are in the word, we might want to try to place them in positions we haven\'t tried. \n In the first guess, we had R in position 2 and A in position 3. Now we are trying A in position 2 and R in position 1 (in ""RADIO"") or in position 3 (in ""PARTY"").\n\n We don\'t have any information about position 1, so trying R in position 1 is a new position.\n\n Similarly, for A: we tried position 3 and now we try position 2.\n\n I think ""RADIO"" is a good choice because it tests three new vowels and consonants.\n\n But note: the secret word might not have O, I, D. We are testing them.\n\n Alternatively, we could try a word that uses more common consonants like S, T, L.\n\n How about ""STAIR"": \n   S(1), T(2), A(3) -> but A in position 3 is not allowed.\n\n How about ""TRAIL"": \n   T(1), R(2) -> R in position 2 is not allowed.\n\n How about ""RATIO"": \n   R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5) -> A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed). We test T, I, O.\n\n This is similar to ""RADIO"" but instead of D, we test T, I, O.\n\n ""RATIO"" is a valid word.\n\n Now, between ""RADIO"", ""RATIO"", ""PARTY"", and ""RAILS"", which one?\n\n We want to cover more common letters. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. \n Since E, N, C are out, we can try T, O, I, S, L.\n\n ""RATIO"" has T, I, O -> that\'s three common letters.\n\n ""PARTY"" has P, T, Y -> Y is less common.\n\n ""RAILS"" has I, L, S -> that\'s three common letters.\n\n But note: in ""RAILS"", we are using R in position 1 and A in position 2. Then we have I, L, S in positions 3,4,5.\n\n In ""RATIO"", we have R in 1, A in 2, then T, I, O.\n\n I think ""RATIO"" is a good choice because it tests T, I, O which are very common.\n\n But wait: we have to avoid using letters we know are absent? We know C, N, E are absent, so ""RATIO"" is safe.\n\n Alternatively, we could try ""ROAST"" but we cannot because A would be in position 3 (which is forbidden).\n\n Another candidate: ""RASPY"" -> R(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5). \n   We test S, P, Y.\n\n But we are missing O and I.\n\n I think ""RATIO"" is a solid choice.\n\n However, note that the word ""RADIO"" is also good because it tests O and I.\n\n But let me check: the word ""RADIO"" is valid.\n\n Since we have two vowels already (A and we don\'t have any other vowels known), testing O and I is good.\n\n So, I\'ll go with ""RADIO"".\n\n But wait: what about the position of R? We know R is in the word but not in position 2. We are now putting R in position 1. \n If the secret word has R in position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or an x? \n\n Similarly, A in position 2: if it\'s correct, we get a check; if not, we get a minus or x? But we know A is in the word, so it won\'t be x.\n\n So, let\'s choose ""RADIO"".\n\n But note: we are using R and A again. That\'s okay because we are trying to find their correct positions.\n\n Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn\'t reuse R and A? But we have to include them because we know they are in the word. \n\n Actually, we must include them because we are trying to get more information about their positions.\n\n So, I\'ll go with ""RADIO"".\n\n However, let me think of a word that uses R and A and also includes T, O, I? But we can\'t have all three? \n\n How about ""TRAIL""? We can\'t because R must be included and we can\'t put R in position 2.\n\n Another: ""ARTIS"" -> not a word.\n\n I think ""RADIO"" is a good choice.\n\n But wait: what about ""RAINS""? \n   R(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), S(5) -> but N is absent! We cannot use N.\n\n So, we must avoid N.\n\n Therefore, ""RADIO"" is valid.\n\n Let me confirm: \n   R in position 1: we don\'t know if that\'s allowed? It is, because we only know R is not in position 2.\n   A in position 2: we don\'t have a restriction for A in position 2? Only that it is not in position 3.\n\n So, I\'ll go with ""RADIO"".\n\n But note: we are using D. We don\'t know about D. It might be common or not.\n\n Alternatively, we could use ""ROAST"" if we were allowed to put A in a new position? But we cannot put A in position 3.\n\n How about ""RALLY""? \n   R(1), A(2), L(3), L(4), Y(5) -> but we have two L\'s. And we don\'t know if the word has two L\'s. Also, we are not testing as many new letters.\n\n I think ""RADIO"" is better.\n\n Let me search for a word that has R, A, T, O, I? \n\n How about ""RATIO"" (which is the same as ""RADIO"" but rearranged). \n   R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5)\n\n This is a valid word and tests T, I, O.\n\n I think ""RATIO"" is slightly better because it has T and I (which are very common) and O.\n\n So, I\'ll go with ""RATIO"".\n\n But wait: in ""RATIO"", we are putting A in position 2 and R in position 1. \n\n We know that R is in the word but not in position 2. We are now testing R in position 1. \n If it\'s correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus.\n\n Similarly, A in position 2: we don\'t have a restriction for A in position 2, so we can test it.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""RATIO"".\n\n But note: we are using R and A again. That\'s okay.\n\n So, second guess: ""RATIO""\n\n<guess>ratio</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C, N, E** are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- **R** is present but not in position 2 (marked ""-"").\n- **A** is present but not in position 3 (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **R** and **A** (since they are confirmed present).\n- Avoid **C, N, E** (absent letters).\n- Test new common letters (e.g., **T, I, O**) to gather more information.\n- **R** cannot be in position 2, and **A** cannot be in position 3.\n\nThe word **""RATIO""** fits these criteria:\n- **R** is in position 1 (new position, not 2).\n- **A** is in position 2 (new position, not 3).\n- Introduces **T, I, O** (common letters not yet tested).\n- Valid 5-letter word, avoiding forbidden letters.\n\nThis guess efficiently tests new positions for known letters and explores additional common letters.\n\n<guess>ratio</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (absent)\n- R: - (present, but not in position 2)\n- A: - (present, but not in position 3)\n- N: x (absent)\n- E: x (absent)\n\nGuess 2: ""ratio""\n- R: - (present, but not in position 1)  [since we got \'-\' for R in position 1]\n- A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)      [we got \'✓\' for A in position 2]\n- T: x (absent)\n- I: x (absent)\n- O: x (absent)\n\nSo, from this, we know:\n\n1. The secret word has the letter \'A\' in position 2. (because we got a check for A in position 2 in ""ratio"")\n2. The letter \'R\' is present, but not in position 1 (from ""ratio"") and not in position 2 (from ""crane""). So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.\n3. The following letters are absent: C, N, E, T, I, O.\n\nAlso, from ""crane"", we know that A is not in position 3 (but now we know it\'s in position 2, so that\'s consistent).\n\nNow, the secret word has the form: _ A _ _ _\n\nAnd the letters we know are present: R (in position 3,4, or 5) and (we don\'t know about duplicates, but so far no duplicates).\n\nWe also know the absent letters: C, N, E, T, I, O.\n\nWe need to make a third guess that:\n- Has \'A\' in position 2 (fixed)\n- Includes \'R\' in one of the positions 3,4,5 (but not 1 or 2)\n- Avoids the absent letters: C, N, E, T, I, O\n- We can use other common letters to test.\n\nSince we know A is in position 2, we can fix that.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have the form: _ A _ _ _ and contain the letter R in position 3,4, or 5.\n\nWe also want to test other common letters that we haven\'t tried yet. The remaining common letters include: S, L, U, D, M, P, B, G, etc.\n\nLet\'s try to form a word:\n\nOption 1: R in position 3: _ A R _ _\nWe need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth positions with letters that are not in the absent list and form a valid word.\n\nPossible letters: We can use B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nExample: ""BARMY"" -> B(1), A(2), R(3), M(4), Y(5). But we don\'t know about B, M, Y.\n\nBut we need to test more letters. However, we must include R in position 3.\n\nAnother: ""PARKS"": P(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5). This tests P, K, S.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""PARKS"" uses P, A, R, K, S. None of these are in the absent list (C,N,E,T,I,O). So it\'s valid.\n\nOption 2: R in position 4: _ A _ R _\nExample: ""FAIRY"" -> but we have I and Y? I is absent, so invalid. \n""HAIRY"" -> same issue, I is absent.\n""LAIRD"": L(1), A(2), I(3) -> I is absent, invalid.\n""MARRY"": M(1), A(2), R(3) -> wait, R is in position 3, not 4. \nWe need R in position 4: so _ A _ R _\n\nAnother: ""BASER"" -> but E is absent, invalid.\n""PAPER"" -> E absent, invalid.\n""SAVOR"" -> S(1), A(2), V(3), O(4), R(5) -> but O is absent and R is in position 5, not 4. \nWe need R in position 4: so the word must have R in the fourth position.\n\nHow about ""LAPSE"": but E and S? E is absent, so invalid.\n""MAPLE"": E absent, invalid.\n\nIt\'s hard to find a word with R in position 4 without using absent letters. \n\nOption 3: R in position 5: _ A _ _ R\nExample: ""BAKER"": E absent, invalid.\n""MAKER"": E absent, invalid.\n""FILER"": I and E absent, invalid.\n""HALMR"": not a word.\n\nThis is difficult. So maybe R in position 3 or 4 is easier.\n\nLet me try R in position 3: _ A R _ _\n\nWe need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth positions.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""BARMY"": B(1), A(2), R(3), M(4), Y(5) -> tests B, M, Y\n- ""CARDS"": but C is absent, invalid.\n- ""PARKS"": P(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5) -> tests P, K, S\n- ""MARKS"": M(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5) -> tests M, K, S\n- ""BARKS"": B(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5) -> tests B, K, S\n\nAll these are valid and use only allowed letters.\n\nWe also have the option to test more vowels? But we know the word has A, and we don\'t have any other vowels known (since E,I,O are absent, and we have A). So we might test U? But we don\'t know if U is in the word.\n\nBut note: we have only 6 tries, so we need to be efficient.\n\nWe can also consider words that don\'t have R in position 3? But we know R must be in 3,4, or 5. Since position 4 and 5 are harder, let\'s stick with position 3.\n\nNow, which one to choose? We want to test common letters and maximize information.\n\nWe haven\'t tested: S, L, D, U, P, M, B, G, etc.\n\n""PARKS"" tests P, K, S.\n""BARKS"" tests B, K, S.\n""MARKS"" tests M, K, S.\n\nThe letter S is common, so testing S is good. K is less common, but we have to use it because we are trying to place R.\n\nBut note: we are not sure if the word has S or not. We are testing it.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that uses a different set of letters to cover more ground.\n\nBut we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t have any indication of duplicates so far.\n\nAnother idea: we know the word has R and A. We have A fixed at position 2. So the word is ?A??\n\nWe can try to use a word that has R in position 4 or 5, but we had trouble finding valid words without absent letters.\n\nLet me try R in position 4 again: \n- _ A _ R _\nWe need a word: \n  First letter: not C,N,E,T,I,O -> so we can use B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n  Fourth letter: R\n  Fifth letter: not absent.\n\nExample: ""BALMY"": B(1), A(2), L(3), M(4), Y(5) -> but this doesn\'t have R? We need R in position 4. \n""BALMY"" has M in position 4, not R.\n\nHow about ""SALAD"": but two A\'s? And D. But we have A in position 2 and then again? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are avoiding E? ""SALAD"" has two A\'s and D. But we don\'t know about duplicates. Also, we have to avoid E? It doesn\'t have E, but it has A twice and D. \n\nBut we are not sure if the word has two A\'s. We know at least one A is in position 2. It might have another A? But we don\'t know.\n\nWe can try, but let\'s avoid duplicates for now to get more information.\n\nAnother word: ""PALER"": but E is absent, invalid.\n""MANOR"": M(1), A(2), N(3) -> N is absent! Invalid.\n""FAVOR"": F(1), A(2), V(3), O(4), R(5) -> but O is absent and R is in position 5, not 4. \nWe need R in position 4: so the fourth letter must be R.\n\nHow about ""LAPSE"": but E is absent.\n\nThis is difficult. So maybe R in position 5 is easier?\n\nBut we already have a candidate for R in position 5: ""BAKER"" is invalid because of E. \n\n""MAKER"": same.\n\n""FILER"": invalid.\n\n""HALMR"": not a word.\n\nSo perhaps R is more likely in position 3? \n\nLet me think of common words: \n- ""PARIS"": but we have I? I is absent, and also we have I in position 4? But I is absent, so invalid.\n- ""BARON"": O is absent, invalid.\n\nAnother: ""CARDS"": C absent, invalid.\n\nSo, let\'s stick with R in position 3.\n\nNow, among the candidates: ""BARKS"", ""PARKS"", ""MARKS"", ""BARMY"", etc.\n\nWe want to test letters that are more common. S is very common, so we can test a word that includes S.\n\nWe also have L, which is common.\n\nHow about ""BARKS"": B(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5). \nThis tests B, K, S.\n\nBut we have to consider that the word might have B, K, S.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""LARGE"": but E is absent and also G? But E is absent.\n\nHow about ""MARSH"": M(1), A(2), R(3), S(4), H(5). \nThis tests M, S, H.\n\nBut we don\'t know about H.\n\nAnother: ""PARKS"" is similar but with P instead of M.\n\nWe can also consider ""R"" in position 4? But we couldn\'t find a word. \n\nWhat about ""GAUZE"": but E and Z? E is absent, invalid.\n\nI think we have to choose from the words we have.\n\nBut note: we have another piece of information. In the first guess, we had R in position 2 (which was wrong) and in the second guess we had R in position 1 (which was wrong). Now we are trying R in position 3.\n\nWe also know that A is in position 2.\n\nSo, let\'s list the possibilities for the secret word:\n\nPosition 1: cannot be C,N,E,T,I,O,C,N,E,T,I,O -> so we can use B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.\nPosition 2: A (fixed)\nPosition 3: could be R? or another letter? But we know R is in the word and not in 1 or 2, so 3,4,5.\nPosition 4 and 5: similarly.\n\nWe need to test the position of R and also test new letters.\n\nWe have 3 positions to fill: 1, 3,4,5? Actually, position 2 is fixed as A, so we have positions 1,3,4,5 to fill with letters that include R (in 3,4,5) and two more letters? Because we have 5 letters: position1,2,3,4,5 -> we know 2 is A, so we need to test the other positions.\n\nWe know the word has R and A. So the other three positions must be filled with letters that are not in the absent list.\n\nWe are going to test multiple new letters.\n\nI think ""PARKS"" is a good choice: it tests P, K, S. K is less common, but S is very common.\n\nAlternatively, ""BARKS"" tests B, K, S.\n\nOr ""MARSH"" tests M, S, H.\n\nHow about ""LARGE""? But E is absent.\n\nAnother word: ""DARKY"": D(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), Y(5). \nThis tests D, K, Y.\n\nBut Y is less common.\n\nI think ""PARKS"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the word might have S. We haven\'t tested S yet.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""PARKS"".\n\nBut wait: we are putting R in position 3. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that doesn\'t have R in position 3? But we don\'t have many options.\n\nAnother candidate: ""FARCE"": but C and E absent, invalid.\n\nHow about ""HARPY"": H(1), A(2), R(3), P(4), Y(5). \nThis tests H, P, Y.\n\nBut we are missing S.\n\nI think ""PARKS"" is better than ""HARPY"" because S is more common.\n\nBut let me see: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""PARKS"" uses P, A, R, K, S. All are allowed.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""PARKS"".\n\nBut note: we are using K. If the word has K, we\'ll know. Similarly, P and S.\n\nWe might also consider ""BARMY"", but Y is less common.\n\nAnother word: ""GARDE"": but E is absent.\n\nI think ""PARKS"" is a valid choice.\n\nBut wait: what about the possibility that R is in position 4? We didn\'t find a word, but maybe there is one.\n\nHow about ""WASPY"": W(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5) -> but this doesn\'t have R? We must include R because we know it\'s in the word. So we have to include R.\n\nSo, we must have R in position 3,4, or 5.\n\nAnother word with R in position 4: \n- ""BAJRA""? Not common.\n- ""MAJAR"": not common.\n\nHow about ""SABER"": but E is absent.\n\nI think we have to go with R in position 3.\n\nSo, I choose ""PARKS"".\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that we are not repeating a position that we know is wrong for R? We are putting R in position 3. We don\'t have any feedback that position 3 is wrong for R? We only know that position 1 and 2 are wrong for R.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""PARKS"".\n\nBut wait: what about the letter K? We don\'t know about K. It might be common or not.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that uses L, which is very common. \n\nHow about ""LARGE"": but E is absent.\n\nHow about ""LARKS"": L(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5). \nThis tests L, K, S.\n\nOr ""WARKS"": not common.\n\nI think ""PARKS"" is acceptable.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""PARKS"" is P-A-R-K-S. \nP: not absent? We haven\'t tested P. \nK: not tested.\nS: not tested.\n\nSo, let\'s use ""PARKS"".\n\nBut wait: what about the possibility that the word has duplicate letters? We don\'t have any indication, so we can ignore for now.\n\nAnother candidate: ""BARGE"": but E is absent.\n\nI think we have to go with it.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the word might be ""PARIS"", but I is absent and also we have I in position 4? No, ""PARIS"" has I and O? O is absent.\n\nSo, let\'s finalizes: ""PARKS""\n\nBut wait, what about ""R"" in position 3? We are using R in position 3. If the secret word has R in position 3, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and then we know R must be in position 4 or 5.\n\nSo, let\'s do it.\n\nGuess: ""PARKS""\n\nBut note: we are putting R in position 3. We don\'t have any feedback that position 3 is wrong for R? Actually, we only know that position 1 and 2 are wrong for R. Position 3 might be correct.\n\nSo, we are testing position 3 for R.\n\nIf we get a check for R, then we know R is in position 3. If we get a minus, then R is in position 4 or 5.\n\nSimilarly, we test P, K, S.\n\nSo, it\'s a good test.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""PARKS"".\n\nBut let me check if there\'s a word that tests more common letters. \n\nAnother idea: ""SARIS"": S(1), A(2), R(3), I(4) -> I is absent, invalid.\n\n""SAVOR"": O absent.\n\nI think ""PARKS"" is fine.\n\nSo, the guess is ""PARKS"".\n\nBut note: we are using K. If we don\'t want to use K, we could try ""BARKS"" (B instead of P). But P is more common than B? In wordle, P is common.\n\nActually, in wordle, S is the most common, then L, then ... then K, then P, etc.\n\nBut we are testing S at the end, which is common.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""PARKS"".\n\nBut wait: what about ""R"" in position 3? We are testing it.\n\nSo, let\'s output ""PARKS"".\n\nBut note: we have to make sure we don\'t use absent letters. ""PARKS"" has P, A, R, K, S. None of these are in the absent list (C,N,E,T,I,O).\n\nSo, it\'s valid.\n\nTherefore, the third guess is ""PARKS"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R and A are present but not in positions 2 or 3, respectively. C, N, E are absent.\n- **Guess 2 (""ratio"")**: A is correct in position 2 (✓). R is present but not in position 1 (-). T, I, O are absent.\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **A is fixed in position 2** (from ""ratio"" feedback: ✓).\n2. **R is present** but cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from both guesses). It must be in position 3, 4, or 5.\n3. **Absent letters**: C, N, E, T, I, O (cannot be used).\n4. **Unknown positions**: 1, 3, 4, 5 need to be solved, with R one of them (in 3,4, or 5).\n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- **Must include R** in position 3, 4, or 5 (since positions 1 and 2 are invalid for R).\n- **A must be in position 2** (fixed).\n- **Avoid absent letters** (C, N, E, T, I, O).\n- Test new common letters (e.g., S, L, P, M) to gather more information.\n- Prioritize words with R in position 3 (as position 4/5 is harder to form valid words without absent letters).\n\nThe word **""PARKS""** fits perfectly:\n- **P** (new letter, tests position 1)\n- **A** (fixed in position 2)\n- **R** (placed in position 3 to test if it\'s correct)\n- **K** (new letter, tests position 4)\n- **S** (new letter, tests position 5)\n\nThis guess:\n- Tests R in position 3 (if correct, we get ✓; if not, we learn R is in 4/5).\n- Tests three new common letters (P, K, S).\n- Avoids all absent letters.\n\n<guess>parks</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(x)\nGuess 3: parks -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) K(x) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: absent (x)\n- R: present, wrong position (-)\n- A: present, wrong position (-)\n- N: absent (x)\n- E: absent (x)\n\nGuess 2: ""ratio""\n- R: present, wrong position (-)  [now we know R is not in position 1 or 2]\n- A: correct (✓) in position 2\n- T: absent (x)\n- I: absent (x)\n- O: absent (x)\n\nGuess 3: ""parks""\n- P: absent (x)\n- A: correct (✓) in position 2\n- R: correct (✓) in position 3\n- K: absent (x)\n- S: absent (x)\n\nNow, let\'s consolidate what we know:\n\n1. The secret word has:\n   - A in position 2 (from guess 2 and 3)\n   - R in position 3 (from guess 3: R is correct in position 3)\n\n2. So the word so far is: _ A R _ _\n\n3. We know the following letters are absent: C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S.\n\n4. We also know that R is in position 3, so we don\'t need to test R again.\n\n5. We know A is in position 2, so we don\'t need to test A.\n\n6. We need to find the letters for positions 1, 4, and 5.\n\n7. The word must contain only letters that are not in the absent list. The absent letters are: C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S.\n\n8. The remaining letters that are possible: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, V, W, Y, and possibly others.\n\nNow, we need to form a word that fits: _ A R _ _\n\nWe have to fill positions 1, 4, and 5 with letters from the remaining set, avoiding the absent letters.\n\nLet\'s think of common words that fit the pattern:\n\n- Position 1: a consonant or vowel? We can try common letters.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""BARGE"": but E is absent -> invalid.\n- ""BARRE"": has E and two R\'s? E absent, and also we have R in position 3, but position 2 is A, so ""BARRE"" would be B,A,R,R,E -> but E is absent and also we have two R\'s? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. However, E is absent so invalid.\n\nWe must avoid E.\n\n- ""MARRY"": M,A,R,R,Y -> but we have two R\'s? And Y. But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are using R again? But we know R is in position 3, so if we put R in position 4, that would be a duplicate? But we don\'t know if the word has two R\'s.\n\nBut note: we have only one R so far in the feedback? Actually, we don\'t know. The feedback doesn\'t show duplicates. But we can try.\n\nHowever, we are trying to get information. Using a word with duplicate R might not be efficient because if we get a check for one R, we don\'t know about the other.\n\nBut we are forced to use the pattern _ A R _ _\n\nWe need to test letters for positions 1,4,5.\n\nWe can try to use a word that has new letters and avoids duplicates for now.\n\nLet me list possible words:\n\n- ""BARMY"": B(1), A(2), R(3), M(4), Y(5) -> tests B, M, Y. But we don\'t know about duplicates? And we are using M and Y.\n\nBut we don\'t have any duplicate in this word.\n\n- ""HARPY"": but H(1), A(2), R(3), P(4), Y(5) -> but P is absent (from guess 3: P is absent). So invalid.\n\n- ""LARDY"": L(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5) -> tests L, D, Y. L, D, Y are not in the absent list.\n\nThis seems valid.\n\n- ""MARRY"": M(1), A(2), R(3), R(4), Y(5) -> but this has two R\'s. We know R is in position 3, so if we put R in position 4, we are testing for a duplicate. But we don\'t know if the word has two R\'s. Also, we are using R again, which we already know is in the word. It might be better to test new letters.\n\nWe want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nAnother word: ""WARTY"": W(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), Y(5) -> but T is absent (from guess 2: T is absent). So invalid.\n\n""CARDS"": C absent.\n\n""BARDS"": C absent.\n\n""FARGO"": F(1), A(2), R(3), G(4), O(5) -> O is absent, invalid.\n\n""MARSH"": S absent? S is absent from guess 3. So invalid.\n\n""LARVA"": L(1), A(2), R(3), V(4), A(5) -> but we have two A\'s? And we don\'t know about duplicates. Also, A is already in position 2, so if we put A in position 5, we are testing for a duplicate. But we know A is in position 2, so if we get a check for A in position 5, that would be a duplicate. But we don\'t know if there is a duplicate.\n\nHowever, we are trying to get information. Using a word with duplicate might not be efficient.\n\nBut we have to fill the positions.\n\nAnother word: ""DARBY"": D(1), A(2), R(3), B(4), Y(5). \nThis tests D, B, Y.\n\nBut we don\'t know about duplicates? And we are not using any duplicate.\n\n""DARBY"" is a word? It means a type of hawk, I think.\n\nBut let\'s see: we have to avoid absent letters. D, B, Y are not absent? \nAbsent letters: C,N,E,T,I,O,P,K,S. So D, B, Y are allowed.\n\nBut we have to test new letters.\n\nWe can also consider ""HARDY"": H(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5). \nThis tests H, D, Y.\n\nBut we don\'t know about duplicates.\n\nAlternatively, ""LARDY"" as I thought earlier: L(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5). \nThis tests L, D, Y.\n\n""LARDY"" is a valid word (meaning fat or oily).\n\nAnother: ""MARDY"": M(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5). \nSimilarly, tests M, D, Y.\n\nBut we don\'t know about duplicates.\n\nWe can also try to use a word that has a vowel in position 4 or 5? We have only position 1,4,5 to fill. We know the word has at least A and R, and we have three positions to fill.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has more vowels? We have A already, and we know E,I,O are absent. So the only vowel left is U? And sometimes Y.\n\nSo, the word might have U or Y as a vowel? But in position 4 or 5.\n\nFor example, ""BARUM"": but U? And M. But ""BARUM"" is not common.\n\n""WARNS"": but W(1), A(2), R(3), N(4), S(5) -> N and S are absent, invalid.\n\n""CARDS"": C absent.\n\nI think we have to accept that we might have to test with duplicates or use Y.\n\nBut let me think of words without duplicates:\n\n- ""BALMY"": but L and M? But ""BALMY"" is B,A,L,M,Y. But we need R in position 3? This is B,A,L,M,Y -> no R. So invalid.\n\nWe must have R in position 3.\n\nSo, the pattern is fixed: _ A R _ _\n\nWe need to fill the blanks with letters not in {C,N,E,T,I,O,P,K,S} and not R or A (but we can use other letters, but we don\'t have to avoid R and A in the blanks? Actually, we can use them if we suspect duplicates, but we have no evidence of duplicates so far. So we should avoid using R and A in the blanks to test new letters.\n\nSo, positions 1,4,5 must be filled with letters that are not in the absent list and not R or A? Not necessarily, but if we use R or A in these positions, we might get a duplicate, but we don\'t know if the word has a duplicate. So to test efficiently, we should use new letters.\n\nBut we have to form a valid word.\n\nSo, let\'s look for words that start with a consonant (or vowel) and then R, then two more letters.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""DARBY"" (if accepted): D, A, R, B, Y -> tests D, B, Y.\n- ""HARDY"": H, A, R, D, Y -> tests H, D, Y.\n- ""LARDY"": L, A, R, D, Y -> tests L, D, Y.\n- ""MARDY"": M, A, R, D, Y -> tests M, D, Y.\n- ""WARLY"": W, A, R, L, Y -> tests W, L, Y.\n- ""BARNY"": B, A, R, N, Y -> but N is absent, invalid.\n- ""JARUL"": not a word.\n\nWe can also try ""FARCE"", but C and E absent.\n\nHow about ""HAREM"": but E is absent and M? ""HAREM"" has E, invalid.\n\n""BARRE"": has E, invalid.\n\n""CARME"": C absent.\n\nI think ""LARDY"" is a good candidate: it tests L, D, Y.\n\nBut we have to consider that the word might have duplicate R? We know R is in position 3, but if we put R in position 4? We are not doing that in this word.\n\nIn ""LARDY"", we have no duplicate.\n\nSimilarly, ""HARDY"" has no duplicate.\n\nBut we are testing the same letters: for position 1, we test H, M, B, W, etc.\n\nWe need to choose one.\n\nBut note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on the fourth guess. We can try to cover more common letters.\n\nThe most common letters left: L, D, Y, M, H, W, etc.\n\n""LARDY"" tests L, D, Y.\n\n""HARDY"" tests H, D, Y.\n\n""MARDY"" tests M, D, Y.\n\nI think ""LARDY"" is a good choice because L is a very common letter.\n\nBut we have to make sure that we are not missing something.\n\nAnother word: ""BARNY"": invalid because of N.\n\n""JARUL"" not a word.\n\n""VARNA"": but N absent.\n\n""GAUZE"": E absent.\n\nI think we have to go with one of these.\n\nBut wait: what about ""DARBS""? Not a word.\n\nOr ""LARVA"": but V and A again? And duplicate A? But we don\'t know. And ""LARVA"" has V and A, but we are not testing duplicates? Actually, we are testing L, A, V, R, A? Wait, ""LARVA"" is L,A,R,V,A -> so positions: L(1), A(2), R(3), V(4), A(5). \nThis has duplicate A. But we know A is in position 2, so if we put A in position 5, we are testing for a duplicate. But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s.\n\nHowever, we are on the fourth guess, and we have to test. But using a duplicate might not give us new information if there is only one A.\n\nBut we don\'t know. So it\'s risky.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t have A in position 5? But we don\'t know.\n\nGiven the constraints, I think ""LARDY"" is a safe choice.\n\nBut let me check if there is a word that tests more common letters.\n\nHow about ""HARDY"" or ""LARDY"".\n\nI think both are good. Let\'s choose ""HARDY"" because H is a common letter.\n\nBut we have to avoid the absent letters. ""HARDY"" uses H, A, R, D, Y. \n- H: not tested\n- D: not tested\n- Y: not tested\n\nAnd it fits the pattern.\n\nSimilarly, ""LARDY"" uses L, A, R, D, Y.\n\nNow, which one? H vs L.\n\nH is more common than L? In English, H is more common than L? Actually, L is more common.\n\nBut we are testing two letters: one in position 1 and one in position 4 and 5.\n\nWe can also consider ""WARTY"": but T is absent.\n\n""BARFY"": not common.\n\nI think both are valid. Let\'s pick ""HARDY"".\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that we are not using absent letters. ""HARDY"" is H,A,R,D,Y. \n- H: not absent? No, H has not been tested.\n- D: not absent.\n- Y: not absent.\n\nSo, it\'s valid.\n\nSimilarly, ""LARDY"" is L,A,R,D,Y.\n\nI\'ll go with ""HARDY"" to test H.\n\nBut wait: we have to consider that the word might be ""HARDY"" itself? But we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that uses U? But we don\'t have a word that fits and has U.\n\nFor example, ""GUARD"": but U,A,R,D -> but A is in position 2? ""GUARD"" is G,U,A,R,D -> positions: G(1), U(2) -> but we need A in position 2? No, in ""GUARD"", A is in position 3? \nG(1), U(2), A(3) -> but we need A in position 2. So invalid.\n\nWe must have A in position 2 and R in position 3.\n\nSo, the word must be: [letter] A R [letter] [letter]\n\nWe have to choose from the available letters.\n\nI think ""HARDY"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me see if there is a word with U. \n\n""RARER"": but E is absent and R duplicate? Also, E absent.\n\n""PARER"": E absent.\n\nI don\'t think there is a common word with U that fits.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""HARDY"".\n\nBut wait: what about ""BARMY""? B(1), A(2), R(3), M(4), Y(5). \nThis tests B, M, Y.\n\nH is more common than B? In English, H is more frequent.\n\nBut we are testing H in position 1.\n\nSimilarly, ""HARDY"" tests H in position 1, D in position 4, Y in position 5.\n\nWe can also consider ""MARSH"": but S is absent.\n\nAnother: ""DARKY"": D(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), Y(5) -> but K is absent (from guess 3). So invalid.\n\n""HAIRY"": H(1), A(2), I(3) -> I is absent, invalid.\n\nSo, ""HARDY"" seems good.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""HARDY"" is H,A,R,D,Y. \n- H: allowed\n- D: allowed\n- Y: allowed\n\nSo, it\'s valid.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""HARDY"".\n\nBut wait: what if the word is ""HARDY""? Then we get it right.\n\nBut we are guessing, so it might be.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that tests more vowels? But we only have position 4 and 5 to test, and the word must have a vowel? We have A already, and we know E,I,O are absent. So the only vowel left is U or Y. Position 4 and 5 could be U or Y.\n\nFor example, ""HARDY"" has Y, which is a vowel-like letter.\n\nBut we don\'t know if Y is in the word.\n\nAnother word: ""WARNS"": invalid because of N and S.\n\n""BARNS"": N and S absent.\n\nI think ""HARDY"" is a good guess.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""HARDY"".\n\nBut note: we are using D and Y. We haven\'t tested D or Y.\n\nWe could test L and D? But we can\'t test both in one word without using a duplicate or missing position.\n\nWe have to choose one.\n\nAnother candidate: ""BARDY"" - not a common word.\n\nI think ""HARDY"" is acceptable.\n\nSo, fourth guess: ""HARDY""\n\nBut wait: what about ""LARGE""? E absent.\n\nI think we have to make this guess.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the word might be ""LARGE"", but E is absent.\n\nSo, let\'s finalize: ""HARDY""\n\nBut wait, what about ""DARKY""? Invalid because of K and T absent? K and T are absent.\n\nNo.\n\nSo, I think ""HARDY"" is a good choice.\n\nTherefore, the guess is ""HARDY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **A is confirmed in position 2** (from ""ratio"" and ""parks"" feedback: ✓).\n- **R is confirmed in position 3** (from ""parks"" feedback: ✓).\n- **Absent letters**: C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).\n- **Present letters**: A (position 2), R (position 3), and one more letter (since the word is 5 letters).\n\n### Current Knowledge:\n- Secret word pattern: `[position1] A R [position4] [position5]`\n- Position 1, 4, and 5 must be filled with letters not in the absent list.\n- Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, V, W, Y, etc. (since C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S are absent).\n- We need to test new common letters to identify the missing letters.\n\n### Strategy for Guess 4:\n- **Focus on positions 1, 4, and 5**.\n- Test high-frequency remaining letters (e.g., D, L, M, H, Y) to maximize information.\n- Avoid reusing absent letters and avoid reusing R and A in positions 1, 4, or 5 (since we already know R is in position 3 and A is in position 2).\n- Prioritize words that test three new letters in one guess to narrow down possibilities.\n\nThe word **""HARDY""** fits perfectly:\n- **H** (new, tests position 1)\n- **A** (fixed in position 2)\n- **R** (fixed in position 3)\n- **D** (new, tests position 4)\n- **Y** (new, tests position 5)\n\nThis guess:\n- Tests H, D, and Y (common letters).\n- Avoids all absent letters.\n- If incorrect, the feedback will reveal which of H, D, or Y (if any) are present and in the right positions.\n\n<guess>hardy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(x)\nGuess 3: parks -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) K(x) S(x)\nGuess 4: hardy -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(x) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent
- R: present, wrong position (not 2)
- A: present, wrong position (not 3)
- N: absent
- E: absent

Guess 2: ""ratio""
- R: present, wrong position (not 1)
- A: correct in position 2
- T: absent
- I: absent
- O: absent

Guess 3: ""parks""
- P: absent
- A: correct in position 2
- R: correct in position 3
- K: absent
- S: absent

Guess 4: ""hardy""
- H: absent
- A: correct in position 2
- R: correct in position 3
- D: absent
- Y: correct in position 5? Wait, the feedback for ""hardy"" is: H(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(x) Y(✓)

But the feedback says:
- H: absent (x)
- A: correct (✓) in position 2
- R: correct (✓) in position 3
- D: absent (x)
- Y: correct (✓) in position 5

So, from this:
- Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).
- A is in position 2 (already known).
- R is in position 3 (already known).
- H and D are absent.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: R
- Position 5: Y
- And we know from previous that R is also in position 3 (now confirmed), and A in position 2 (confirmed), and Y in position 5 (confirmed).

So the word is: _ A R _ Y

We are missing positions 1 and 4.

Also, we know the absent letters: C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S, H, D.

So the absent letters are: C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S, H, D.

We need to find a word that fits: [letter1] A R [letter4] Y

Letter1 and letter4 must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the absent letters.

Remaining possible letters: B, F, G, L, M, U, V, W, X, Z, and possibly others, but we'll focus on common ones.

We know the word must have Y at the end, and we have A and R in the middle.

Now, what words fit this pattern?

Common words: 
- ""BARMY"": but M? And we have to check if M is allowed. M is not in the absent list. But ""BARMY"" is B,A,R,M,Y. 
  - Position 1: B
  - Position 2: A
  - Position 3: R
  - Position 4: M
  - Position 5: Y

But we haven't tested B and M.

- ""LARDY"": but D is absent, so invalid. We know D is absent from guess 4.

- ""MARVY"": M,A,R,V,Y -> tests M and V. ""MARVY"" is a word (meaning very good or excellent).

- ""WARZY"": not a word.

- ""CARVY"": not a word and C absent.

- ""FARCY"": not a word and C absent.

- ""JARLY"": not a word.

- ""BARNY"": but N absent.

- ""LARZY"": not a word.

- ""BARFY"": not common.

- ""LARZY"": not a word.

- ""MARRY"": but we have Y at the end? ""MARRY"" is M,A,R,R,Y -> but this has two R's? And in position 4, we have R. But we know R is in position 3, so if we put R in position 4, that would be a duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

However, in the feedback for ""hardy"", we have Y as correct in position 5, so the word ends with Y. And we have A and R in positions 2 and 3.

So, ""MARRY"" would be M,A,R,R,Y -> but then position 4 is R, which is duplicate. But we don't know if the word has two R's.

But we have to consider the possibility.

But let's see the feedback: in ""hardy"", we had D absent, so D is not in the word. And H absent.

But we know the word has Y at the end, so it must be ""MARRY"" if we consider duplicate R.

But we have to test.

Another word: ""BARMY"" as above.

Also, ""MARVY"": M,A,R,V,Y.

And ""RALLY"": but L and L? And we have Y at the end? ""RALLY"" is R,A,L,L,Y -> but R is in position 1? We need R in position 3. So not.

The pattern is fixed: position 3 is R, position 5 is Y.

So, we need words of the form: ? A R ? Y

Now, what about ""BARFY""? Not common.

""CARVY"": not a word.

""JARUL"": not a word.

""VARAY"": not a word.

""KARZY"": not a word and K absent.

So, common words: 
- ""BARMY"": B,A,R,M,Y
- ""MARVY"": M,A,R,V,Y
- ""WARZY"": not a word.

Also, ""LARZY"": not a word.

What about ""FARCY""? Not a word.

I think ""BARMY"" and ""MARVY"" are candidates.

But we also have ""JAZZY"": but that has Z and Z, and A in position 2? J,A,Z,Z,Y -> position 3 is Z, not R. So invalid.

We need position 3 to be R.

So, only a few options.

Another: ""PARZY"": not a word.

""RABBY"": not a word.

So, we have ""BARMY"" and ""MARVY"".

But we need to choose one.

We can also consider ""HARPY"": but H is absent, so invalid.

""LARVA"": but V? And A in position 2, but position 3 is R? ""LARVA"" is L,A,R,V,A -> but this has A in position 5? And we have A in position 2, so if we put A in position 5, that would be a duplicate? But we don't know.

But in the pattern, we have position 5 as Y, so it cannot be A. So ""LARVA"" would have A in position 5, which conflicts because we know position 5 is Y.

So, we cannot have A in position 5. Therefore, ""LARVA"" is invalid because it would require A in position 5, but we know position 5 is Y.

Similarly, any word with A in position 5 is invalid because we know A is in position 2 and we have no evidence of a duplicate A? But we don't know for sure.

But from the feedback, in guess 1, A was present but not in position 3, and in guess 2, A was correct in position 2, so if there were a duplicate A, we might have seen it? Not necessarily, because we only tested A in position 3 in guess 1 and in position 2 in guess 2. We haven't tested A in other positions.

But in guess 4, we tested A only in position 2 (which is correct) and not elsewhere.

So, it's possible that there is a duplicate A? But we don't have evidence.

However, in the pattern, we have position 5 as Y, so if we put A in position 4, that would be a duplicate? But we don't know.

But let's look at the candidates:

- ""BARMY"": B,A,R,M,Y -> no duplicate A.
- ""MARVY"": M,A,R,V,Y -> no duplicate A.
- ""LARVA"": L,A,R,V,A -> has duplicate A. But position 5 is Y, so if we put A in position 5, it conflicts. Also, in ""LARVA"", position 5 is A, but we know it must be Y. So invalid.

Therefore, we cannot have a word with A in position 5. So any word with A in position 4 would be even better? But we don't have many options.

Another word: ""BARFY"" is not common.

""CARVY"": not a word.

""JARUL"": not a word.

So, we are left with ""BARMY"" and ""MARVY"".

We also have ""WARZY"", but not common.

""RABBY"": not a word.

I think ""BARMY"" and ""MARVY"" are the main candidates.

Now, we need to choose one.

We can also consider ""FARCY"", but C absent.

Another: ""HARZY"": H absent.

So, let's list:

- ""BARMY"": B, A, R, M, Y
- ""MARVY"": M, A, R, V, Y

We haven't tested B, M, V.

We can choose one.

But note: we are on the fifth guess, and we have two possibilities. We can pick one.

Alternatively, we could try a word that tests more letters? But we only have two positions to fill: position 1 and position 4.

We have to guess a word that fits the pattern.

We can try ""BARMY"" to test B and M.

If it's not, then we try ""MARVY"" next.

But we have only two guesses left (since we are on guess 5, and we get 6 tries, so two more after this? No, we are making the fifth guess now, and we have one more after if needed).

But we can solve it.

Another word: ""LARZY"" not a word.

""VARZY"": not a word.

""ZARFY"": not a word.

I think ""BARMY"" and ""MARVY"" are the only common words.

But let me check: is ""MARVY"" a word? Yes, meaning excellent.

""BARMY"" is also a word, meaning crazy.

But we can also consider ""JAZZY"": but position 3 is Z, not R.

No.

So, I'll go with ""BARMY"" to test B and M.

But we have to make a guess.

Alternatively, we can think: is there a word that uses more common letters? B and M are both common.

But we have to choose.

Another idea: we know the word has Y at the end, and we have A and R in the middle. We can try ""BARMY"".

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""BARMY"" uses B, A, R, M, Y. 
- B: not tested
- M: not tested

And it fits the pattern.

Similarly, ""MARVY"" uses M, A, R, V, Y.

V is less common than M? In letters, M is more common than V.

But we are testing M in both.

We can also consider ""WARZY"", but not common.

I think ""BARMY"" is a good choice.

But let me see: if we guess ""BARMY"" and it's wrong, we get feedback on B and M.

Similarly for ""MARVY"".

But we have two possibilities, so we can pick one.

Since we are on the fifth guess, and we have two options, we can try ""BARMY"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not missing the word ""MARVY"".

We don't know.

But let's look at the frequency: M is more common than B? In English, M is more common than B.

But we are testing both.

We can also consider ""FARMY"": F,A,R,M,Y -> F is not tested. ""FARMY"" is a word? It might be, but less common.

I think ""BARMY"" is more common.

But let me check the dictionary: ""barmy"" is valid, ""marvy"" is valid.

Both are acceptable.

But we have to choose one.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't use M or B? But we have to fill the pattern.

We can try ""LARVA"", but that has A in position 4? ""LARVA"" is L,A,R,V,A -> positions: L(1), A(2), R(3), V(4), A(5). 
But position 5 must be Y, not A. So invalid.

We cannot have A in position 5.

So, back to ""BARMY"" and ""MARVY"".

I think I'll go with ""BARMY"" to test B.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""BARMY"" uses B, A, R, M, Y. 
- B: not absent
- M: not absent
- Y: we know is present and in position 5.

So, it's valid.

But wait: what if the word is ""MARVY""? Then we miss.

But we have to guess.

We can also consider ""WARTY"", but T is absent.

No.

So, I think ""BARMY"" is a good guess.

But let me see if there is a word that uses L or F or others.

""BARFY"": not common.

""CARVY"": not a word.

I think we have to choose between ""BARMY"" and ""MARVY"".

Let me pick ""MARVY"" because M is more common than B.

But in terms of frequency, M is more common than V? Actually, in English, V is less common than M? 

According to letter frequency, M is more common than V.

But we are testing both.

We can also consider ""FARMY"": F,A,R,M,Y -> F is not tested. ""FARMY"" is a word? It might be, but less common.

""FARMY"" is not standard.

""WARMY"": not a word.

So, I think ""MARVY"" is a better choice because M is more common.

But let me check: ""MARVY"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""BARMY"" is also valid.

But we have to make a decision.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that tests F? But we don't have a word with F in position 1 or 4.

For example, ""FARCY"" invalid.

""PARVY"": not a word.

So, I think we have to choose between ""BARMY"" and ""MARVY"".

I'll go with ""MARVY"" because it tests M (more common) and V (less common, so if it's not, we know V is absent and then it must be ""BARMY"").

But we have two guesses left, so we can afford to be wrong once.

But we are on the fifth guess, and we have one more after if needed.

So, let's choose ""MARVY"".

But note: we have to write the guess.

Alternatively, we can think: is there a word that uses L? For example, ""LARVA"" but that doesn't end with Y.

We need to end with Y.

""LARVA"" doesn't end with Y.

""CARVY"": not a word.

I think ""MARVY"" is the better choice.

But let me see: ""MARVY"" means excellent, and it's a valid word.

So, I'll go with ""MARVY"".

But wait: what about ""BARMY""? It means crazy, also valid.

But ""MARVY"" is more sophisticated.

We can also consider ""FARMY"", but it's not standard.

I think we have to go with ""MARVY"".

So, fifth guess: ""MARVY""

But note: we are putting M in position 1 and V in position 4.

If the word is ""MARVY"", we get it right.

If not, then we know it must be ""BARMY"" or another word.

But there is also ""WARTY"", but T is absent.

Another word: ""BARZY"": not a word.

So, I think ""MARVY"" is a good guess.

Therefore, the guess is ""MARVY"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **A is confirmed in position 2** (from ""ratio"" and ""parks"" feedback: ✓).
- **R is confirmed in position 3** (from ""parks"" and ""hardy"" feedback: ✓).
- **Y is confirmed in position 5** (from ""hardy"" feedback: ✓).
- **Absent letters**: C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S, H, D (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).
- **Present letters**: A (position 2), R (position 3), Y (position 5), and one more letter (position 1 and 4) that is not in the absent list.

### Current Knowledge:
- Secret word pattern: `[position1] A R [position4] Y`
- Position 1 and 4 must be filled with letters not in the absent list (available: B, F, G, L, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.).
- We know the word must be a valid English word ending with ""ARY"" (specifically, ""A R _ Y""), but with the fourth letter being the key.

### Strategy for Guess 5:
- **Focus on positions 1 and 4**.
- Test high-frequency available letters (e.g., M, L, F, B) to identify the missing letters.
- Only two candidates remain: **""MARVY""** (M in position 1, V in position 4) and **""BARMY""** (B in position 1, M in position 4). 
- ""MARVY"" is chosen because M is more common than B in English, and V is a less common letter that, if absent, will confirm ""BARMY"" as the solution.

If ""MARVY"" is incorrect, we will know that position 1 must be B and position 4 must be M (resulting in ""BARMY""), as ""BARMY"" is the only other valid option.

But the feedback says:
- H: absent (x)
- A: correct (✓) in position 2
- R: correct (✓) in position 3
- D: absent (x)
- Y: correct (✓) in position 5

So, from this:
- Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).
- A is in position 2 (already known).
- R is in position 3 (already known).
- H and D are absent.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: R
- Position 5: Y
- And we know from previous that R is also in position 3 (now confirmed), and A in position 2 (confirmed), and Y in position 5 (confirmed).

So the word is: _ A R _ Y

We are missing positions 1 and 4.

Also, we know the absent letters: C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S, H, D.

So the absent letters are: C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S, H, D.

We need to find a word that fits: [letter1] A R [letter4] Y

Letter1 and letter4 must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the absent letters.

Remaining possible letters: B, F, G, L, M, U, V, W, X, Z, and possibly others, but we'll focus on common ones.

Common words:

  - Position 4: M
  - Position 5: Y

But we haven't tested B and M.

- ""LARDY"": but D is absent, so invalid. We know D is absent from guess 4.

- ""MARVY"": M,A,R,V,Y -> tests M and V. ""MARVY"" is a word (meaning very good or excellent).

- ""WARZY"": not a word.

- ""CARVY"": not a word and C absent.

- ""FARCY"": not a word and C absent.

- ""JARLY"": not a word.

- ""BARNY"": but N absent.

- ""LARZY"": not a word.

- ""BARFY"": not common.

- ""LARZY"": not a word.

- ""MARRY"": but we have Y at the end? ""MARRY"" is M,A,R,R,Y -> but this has two R's? And in position 4, we have R. But we know R is in position 3, so if we put R in position 4, that would be a duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

However, in the feedback for ""hardy"", we have Y as correct in position 5, so the word ends with Y. And we have A and R in positions 2 and 3.

So, ""MARRY"" would be M,A,R,R,Y -> but then position 4 is R, which is duplicate. But we don't know if the word has two R's.

But we have to consider the possibility.

But let's see the feedback: in ""hardy"", we had D absent, so D is not in the word. And H absent.

But we know the word has Y at the end, so it must be ""MARRY"" if we consider duplicate R.

But we have to test.

Another word: ""BARMY"" as above.

Also, ""MARVY"": M,A,R,V,Y.

And ""RALLY"": but L and L? And we have Y at the end? ""RALLY"" is R,A,L,L,Y -> but R is in position 1? We need R in position 3. So not.

The pattern is fixed: position 3 is R, position 5 is Y.

So, we need words of the form: ? A R ? Y

Now, what about ""BARFY""? Not common.

""CARVY"": not a word.

""JARUL"": not a word.

""VARAY"": not a word.

""KARZY"": not a word and K absent.

So, common words: 
- ""BARMY"": B,A,R,M,Y
- ""MARVY"": M,A,R,V,Y
- ""WARZY"": not a word.

Also, ""LARZY"": not a word.

What about ""FARCY""? Not a word.

I think ""BARMY"" and ""MARVY"" are candidates.

But we also have ""JAZZY"": but that has Z and Z, and A in position 2? J,A,Z,Z,Y -> position 3 is Z, not R. So invalid.

We need position 3 to be R.

So, only a few options.

Another: ""PARZY"": not a word.

""RABBY"": not a word.

So, we have ""BARMY"" and ""MARVY"".

But we need to choose one.

We can also consider ""HARPY"": but H is absent, so invalid.

""LARVA"": but V? And A in position 2, but position 3 is R? ""LARVA"" is L,A,R,V,A -> but this has A in position 5? And we have A in position 2, so if we put A in position 5, that would be a duplicate? But we don't know.

But in the pattern, we have position 5 as Y, so it cannot be A. So ""LARVA"" would have A in position 5, which conflicts because we know position 5 is Y.

So, we cannot have A in position 5. Therefore, ""LARVA"" is invalid because it would require A in position 5, but we know position 5 is Y.

Similarly, any word with A in position 5 is invalid because we know A is in position 2 and we have no evidence of a duplicate A? But we don't know for sure.

But from the feedback, in guess 1, A was present but not in position 3, and in guess 2, A was correct in position 2, so if there were a duplicate A, we might have seen it? Not necessarily, because we only tested A in position 3 in guess 1 and in position 2 in guess 2. We haven't tested A in other positions.

But in guess 4, we tested A only in position 2 (which is correct) and not elsewhere.

So, it's possible that there is a duplicate A? But we don't have evidence.

However, in the pattern, we have position 5 as Y, so if we put A in position 4, that would be a duplicate? But we don't know.

But let's look at the candidates:

- ""BARMY"": B,A,R,M,Y -> no duplicate A.
- ""MARVY"": M,A,R,V,Y -> no duplicate A.
- ""LARVA"": L,A,R,V,A -> has duplicate A. But position 5 is Y, so if we put A in position 5, it conflicts. Also, in ""LARVA"", position 5 is A, but we know it must be Y. So invalid.

Therefore, we cannot have a word with A in position 5. So any word with A in position 4 would be even better? But we don't have many options.

Another word: ""BARFY"" is not common.

""CARVY"": not a word.

""JARUL"": not a word.

So, we are left with ""BARMY"" and ""MARVY"".

We also have ""WARZY"", but not common.

""RABBY"": not a word.

I think ""BARMY"" and ""MARVY"" are the main candidates.

Now, we need to choose one.

We can also consider ""FARCY"", but C absent.

Another: ""HARZY"": H absent.

So, let's list:

- ""BARMY"": B, A, R, M, Y
- ""MARVY"": M, A, R, V, Y

We haven't tested B, M, V.

We can choose one.

But note: we are on the fifth guess, and we have two possibilities. We can pick one.

Alternatively, we could try a word that tests more letters? But we only have two positions to fill: position 1 and position 4.

We have to guess a word that fits the pattern.

We can try ""BARMY"" to test B and M.

If it's not, then we try ""MARVY"" next.

But we have only two guesses left (since we are on guess 5, and we get 6 tries, so two more after this? No, we are making the fifth guess now, and we have one more after if needed).

But we can solve it.

Another word: ""LARZY"" not a word.

""VARZY"": not a word.

""ZARFY"": not a word.

I think ""BARMY"" and ""MARVY"" are the only common words.

But let me check: is ""MARVY"" a word? Yes, meaning excellent.

""BARMY"" is also a word, meaning crazy.

But we can also consider ""JAZZY"": but position 3 is Z, not R.

No.

So, I'll go with ""BARMY"" to test B and M.

But we have to make a guess.

Alternatively, we can think: is there a word that uses more common letters? B and M are both common.

But we have to choose.

Another idea: we know the word has Y at the end, and we have A and R in the middle. We can try ""BARMY"".

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""BARMY"" uses B, A, R, M, Y. 
- B: not tested
- M: not tested

And it fits the pattern.

Similarly, ""MARVY"" uses M, A, R, V, Y.

V is less common than M? In letters, M is more common than V.

But we are testing M in both.

We can also consider ""WARZY"", but not common.

I think ""BARMY"" is a good choice.

But let me see: if we guess ""BARMY"" and it's wrong, we get feedback on B and M.

Similarly for ""MARVY"".

But we have two possibilities, so we can pick one.

Since we are on the fifth guess, and we have two options, we can try ""BARMY"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not missing the word ""MARVY"".

We don't know.

But let's look at the frequency: M is more common than B? In English, M is more common than B.

But we are testing both.

We can also consider ""FARMY"": F,A,R,M,Y -> F is not tested. ""FARMY"" is a word? It might be, but less common.

I think ""BARMY"" is more common.

But let me check the dictionary: ""barmy"" is valid, ""marvy"" is valid.

Both are acceptable.

But we have to choose one.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't use M or B? But we have to fill the pattern.

We can try ""LARVA"", but that has A in position 4? ""LARVA"" is L,A,R,V,A -> positions: L(1), A(2), R(3), V(4), A(5). 
But position 5 must be Y, not A. So invalid.

We cannot have A in position 5.

So, back to ""BARMY"" and ""MARVY"".

I think I'll go with ""BARMY"" to test B.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""BARMY"" uses B, A, R, M, Y. 
- B: not absent
- M: not absent
- Y: we know is present and in position 5.

So, it's valid.

But wait: what if the word is ""MARVY""? Then we miss.

But we have to guess.

We can also consider ""WARTY"", but T is absent.

No.

So, I think ""BARMY"" is a good guess.

But let me see if there is a word that uses L or F or others.

""BARFY"": not common.

""CARVY"": not a word.

I think we have to choose between ""BARMY"" and ""MARVY"".

Let me pick ""MARVY"" because M is more common than B.

But in terms of frequency, M is more common than V? Actually, in English, V is less common than M? 

According to letter frequency, M is more common than V.

But we are testing both.

We can also consider ""FARMY"": F,A,R,M,Y -> F is not tested. ""FARMY"" is a word? It might be, but less common.

""FARMY"" is not standard.

""WARMY"": not a word.

So, I think ""MARVY"" is a better choice because M is more common.

But let me check: ""MARVY"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""BARMY"" is also valid.

But we have to make a decision.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that tests F? But we don't have a word with F in position 1 or 4.

For example, ""FARCY"" invalid.

""PARVY"": not a word.

So, I think we have to choose between ""BARMY"" and ""MARVY"".

I'll go with ""MARVY"" because it tests M (more common) and V (less common, so if it's not, we know V is absent and then it must be ""BARMY"").

But we have two guesses left, so we can afford to be wrong once.

But we are on the fifth guess, and we have one more after if needed.

So, let's choose ""MARVY"".

But note: we have to write the guess.

Alternatively, we can think: is there a word that uses L? For example, ""LARVA"" but that doesn't end with Y.

We need to end with Y.

""LARVA"" doesn't end with Y.

""CARVY"": not a word.

I think ""MARVY"" is the better choice.

But let me see: ""MARVY"" means excellent, and it's a valid word.

So, I'll go with ""MARVY"".

But wait: what about ""BARMY""? It means crazy, also valid.

But ""MARVY"" is more sophisticated.

We can also consider ""FARMY"", but it's not standard.

I think we have to go with ""MARVY"".

So, fifth guess: ""MARVY""

But note: we are putting M in position 1 and V in position 4.

If the word is ""MARVY"", we get it right.

If not, then we know it must be ""BARMY"" or another word.

But there is also ""WARTY"", but T is absent.

Another word: ""BARZY"": not a word.

So, I think ""MARVY"" is a good guess.

Therefore, the guess is ""MARVY"".Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **A is confirmed in position 2** (from ""ratio"" and ""parks"" feedback: ✓).
- **R is confirmed in position 3** (from ""parks"" and ""hardy"" feedback: ✓).
- **Y is confirmed in position 5** (from ""hardy"" feedback: ✓).
- **Absent letters**: C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S, H, D (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).
- **Present letters**: A (position 2), R (position 3), Y (position 5), and one more letter (position 1 and 4) that is not in the absent list.

### Current Knowledge:
- Secret word pattern: `[position1] A R [position4] Y`
- Position 1 and 4 must be filled with letters not in the absent list (available: B, F, G, L, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.).
- We know the word must be a valid English word ending with ""ARY"" (specifically, ""A R _ Y""), but with the fourth letter being the key.

### Strategy for Guess 5:
- **Focus on positions 1 and 4**.
- Test high-frequency available letters (e.g., M, L, F, B) to identify the missing letters.
- Only two candidates remain: **""MARVY""** (M in position 1, V in position 4) and **""BARMY""** (B in position 1, M in position 4). 
- ""MARVY"" is chosen because M is more common than B in English, and V is a less common letter that, if absent, will confirm ""BARMY"" as the solution.

If ""MARVY"" is incorrect, we will know that position 1 must be B and position 4 must be M (resulting in ""BARMY""), as ""BARMY"" is the only other valid option.",Guess 5: marvy -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(✓) R(✓) V(x) Y(✓),FAIL

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not the second letter, and A is not the third letter.
 - The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

 We also know that the secret word is 5 letters long.

 We need to make a second guess that:
 - Does not use C, N, E (since they are absent)
 - Includes R and A (but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively)
 - We can try to use other common letters to get more information.

 Since R and A are in the word, we should try to place them in different positions.

 Let's think of a word that:
 - Has R and A, but R not in position 2 and A not in position 3.
 - Avoids C, N, E.

 Also, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Common consonants: S, T, L, etc.
 Vowels: We already have A, so we might try O or I.

 Let's try to form a word that has R and A, and also includes other common letters.

 Possibilities: 
 - We can try to put R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2)
 - We can try to put A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3)

 Since we have two letters that are present (R and A), we can try to use them in new positions and add three new letters.

 Let's consider the word ""ROAST"", but note that we have to avoid the positions we know:
 - R in ""ROAST"" is in position 1 -> that's allowed (since we only know it's not in position 2)
 - O is new
 - A is in position 2 -> but we don't have a restriction on A for position 2? Our restriction for A is that it cannot be in position 3. So position 2 is allowed for A.
 - S and T are new.

 However, we must note that the feedback for ""crane"" told us that R is in the word but not in position 2, and A is in the word but not in position 3. It doesn't say anything about other positions.

 But wait: in ""ROAST"", A is in position 2. We don't have any feedback that A cannot be in position 2. So that's okay.

 However, we must also consider that the word must be valid.

 But note: we have to avoid using C, N, E. ""ROAST"" doesn't have these, so it's okay.

 Let me check: R, O, A, S, T.

 But we have two known letters: R and A. We are including them. The new letters are O, S, T.

 This seems like a good candidate because it tests three new letters.

 Alternatively, we could try ""PARTY"", but that has T and Y. However, we don't know about T and Y.

 Another idea: ""RAISE"" -> but we have to avoid E? Actually, E is absent, so we cannot use E. So ""RAISE"" has E -> not allowed.

 How about ""RADIO""? 
 - R in position 1 -> allowed.
 - A in position 2 -> allowed (since we only know A isn't in position 3).
 - But we have D, I, O. And we avoid C, N, E.

 However, we are introducing three new letters: D, I, O.

 But note: we have two known letters (R and A) and three new ones. That's efficient.

 Another candidate: ""STARK"" -> but we don't have A in this word? We must include A because we know it's in the word. So we have to include A.

 So, we must have a word that includes R and A.

 Let me list a few words that include R and A, and avoid C, N, E:

 - ROAST: R, O, A, S, T -> positions: R(1), O(2), A(3), S(4), T(5)
   But note: in the first guess, A was in position 3 and we were told it's in the word but wrong position. 
   Now we are putting A in position 3 again? That would be the same position. We know A is not in position 3, so we cannot put A in position 3 again.

   So we must avoid putting A in position 3.

   In ""ROAST"", A is in position 3 -> not allowed.

 - How about ""RATIO""? 
   R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5). 
   Here, A is in position 2 -> allowed.

 - ""RADIO"": R(1), A(2), D(3), I(4), O(5) -> A in position 2 -> allowed.

 - ""ARTSY"": but A is in position 1 -> allowed, but the word has Y and S, and we don't know about them. Also, we have to avoid E? It doesn't have E.

 But note: we have to use valid words. ""ARTSY"" is valid? It's a word (meaning artistic). But let's see if we can get more common words.

 Another: ""PARTY"": P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), Y(5) -> A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 3 (allowed, because we only know it's not in position 2).

 But we have to avoid C, N, E. ""PARTY"" doesn't have these.

 However, we have two known letters (A and R) and we are putting R in position 3 and A in position 2. That's acceptable.

 But note: we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let me compare:

 Option 1: ""RADIO"" -> letters: R, A, D, I, O. We test D, I, O.
 Option 2: ""PARTY"" -> letters: P, A, R, T, Y. We test P, T, Y.
 Option 3: ""ROAST"" is invalid because A is in position 3.

 Another word: ""RAILS"" -> R(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), S(5). 
   A is in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed). We test I, L, S.

 But note: we have to avoid using the same letter twice? We are using R and A only once.

 We want to maximize new letters. Also, we want to cover common letters.

 Let's think about frequencies: 
   In English, S, T, L, O, I are common.

 So, ""RAILS"" uses R, A, I, L, S -> that's five new letters? Actually, we are using R and A, but we are testing three new ones.

 Alternatively, ""RADIO"" uses R, A, D, I, O -> testing D, I, O.

 ""PARTY"": P, A, R, T, Y -> testing P, T, Y.

 The most common letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. But we know E, N, C are absent. So we should test I, O, T, S, L.

 So, a word that includes R and A and tests I, O, T, S, L? That would be ideal.

 How about ""RASPY""? 
   R(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5). 
   A is in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed). We test S, P, Y.

 But we are missing O, I, T.

 Another: ""TRAIL"" -> T(1), R(2) -> wait, R is in position 2? But we know R is not in position 2? 
   Actually, the feedback for the first guess: R was in position 2 and we got a '-' meaning it is in the word but not in that position. 
   So we cannot put R in position 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it's not there. 
   So we should avoid putting R in position 2.

 In ""TRAIL"", R is in position 2 -> not allowed.

 How about ""STARK""? But we don't have A. We must include A.

 How about ""ARTSY""? A(1), R(2) -> R in position 2 is not allowed.

 How about ""RALLY""? 
   R(1), A(2), L(3), L(4), Y(5) -> but we have two L's? And we don't know if L is in the word. Also, we are repeating L? 
   But the word ""RALLY"" has two L's. We don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. But to maximize information, we might avoid repeats.

 Alternatively, ""RAILS"" (as I thought earlier) is without repeats and covers I, L, S.

 Another: ""RAPID"": R(1), A(2), P(3), I(4), D(5) -> A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed). We test P, I, D.

 But we are missing S, T, L.

 How about ""ROTLS""? Not a word.

 After considering, I think ""RAILS"" is a good candidate:
   R in position 1 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed), then I, L, S.

 But note: we have to make sure we don't use any of the absent letters (C, N, E). ""RAILS"" is clean.

 However, we have to consider that the secret word might have the letter in a different position. We are testing R in position 1 and A in position 2.

 Alternatively, we could try to put R in a different position, say position 4 or 5? 

 For example, ""PLANT"" has N and we know N is absent. So invalid.

 How about ""SPRAY"": 
   S(1), P(2), R(3), A(4), Y(5). 
   Here, R is in position 3 (allowed) and A is in position 4 (allowed, because we only know it's not in position 3). 
   We test S, P, Y.

 But we are not using the fact that we know A is in the word. We are using A.

 However, we are not using R in a new position? We are using R in position 3, which is new.

 But note: we have two known letters (R and A) and we are using them. Also, we are testing S, P, Y.

 But we are missing the opportunity to test more vowels? We already have A, and we know E is absent. So we might test O or I.

 Since we have two vowels already (A and ? we don't know), we might want to test O or I.

 Let me try to form a word that has R, A, and also O and I? 

 How about ""ORBIT""? 
   O(1), R(2) -> wait, R in position 2 is not allowed.

 How about ""ROBIN"": 
   R(1), O(2), B(3), I(4), N(5) -> but N is absent! We cannot use N.

 How about ""ROBIA""? Not a common word.

 How about ""RADIO"" (which we considered earlier) -> R(1), A(2), D(3), I(4), O(5). 
   This has A in position 2 (allowed) and R in position 1 (allowed). We test D, I, O.

 This seems good.

 But note: we are using R in position 1 and A in position 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Alternatively, we could try to put R in position 4 or 5? 

 For example, ""PLAIN"": 
   P(1), L(2), A(3) -> but A in position 3 is not allowed (we know A is not in position 3). So invalid.

 How about ""PARIS"": 
   P(1), A(2), R(3), I(4), S(5). 
   A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 3 (allowed). We test P, I, S.

 This is also a candidate.

 Now, which one to choose? 

 We want to test as many common letters as possible and avoid repeating known positions for R and A.

 Let me list the positions we are using for R and A in our candidates:

 - ""RADIO"": R(1), A(2)
 - ""PARTY"": P(1), A(2), R(3) -> note: R is in position 3 (which is new) and A in position 2 (new position for A).
 - ""RAILS"": R(1), A(2), then I(3), L(4), S(5) -> R in 1, A in 2, then I, L, S.

 The word ""PARTY"" uses the same positions for R and A as ""RADIO"" but then we test P, T, Y. 

 Since we have two letters that we know are in the word, we might want to try to place them in positions we haven't tried. 
 In the first guess, we had R in position 2 and A in position 3. Now we are trying A in position 2 and R in position 1 (in ""RADIO"") or in position 3 (in ""PARTY"").

 We don't have any information about position 1, so trying R in position 1 is a new position.

 Similarly, for A: we tried position 3 and now we try position 2.

 I think ""RADIO"" is a good choice because it tests three new vowels and consonants.

 But note: the secret word might not have O, I, D. We are testing them.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that uses more common consonants like S, T, L.

 How about ""STAIR"": 
   S(1), T(2), A(3) -> but A in position 3 is not allowed.

 How about ""TRAIL"": 
   T(1), R(2) -> R in position 2 is not allowed.

 How about ""RATIO"": 
   R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5) -> A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed). We test T, I, O.

 This is similar to ""RADIO"" but instead of D, we test T, I, O.

 ""RATIO"" is a valid word.

 Now, between ""RADIO"", ""RATIO"", ""PARTY"", and ""RAILS"", which one?

 We want to cover more common letters. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. 
 Since E, N, C are out, we can try T, O, I, S, L.

 ""RATIO"" has T, I, O -> that's three common letters.

 ""PARTY"" has P, T, Y -> Y is less common.

 ""RAILS"" has I, L, S -> that's three common letters.

 But note: in ""RAILS"", we are using R in position 1 and A in position 2. Then we have I, L, S in positions 3,4,5.

 In ""RATIO"", we have R in 1, A in 2, then T, I, O.

 I think ""RATIO"" is a good choice because it tests T, I, O which are very common.

 But wait: we have to avoid using letters we know are absent? We know C, N, E are absent, so ""RATIO"" is safe.

 Alternatively, we could try ""ROAST"" but we cannot because A would be in position 3 (which is forbidden).

 Another candidate: ""RASPY"" -> R(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5). 
   We test S, P, Y.

 But we are missing O and I.

 I think ""RATIO"" is a solid choice.

 However, note that the word ""RADIO"" is also good because it tests O and I.

 But let me check: the word ""RADIO"" is valid.

 Since we have two vowels already (A and we don't have any other vowels known), testing O and I is good.

 So, I'll go with ""RADIO"".

 But wait: what about the position of R? We know R is in the word but not in position 2. We are now putting R in position 1. 
 If the secret word has R in position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or an x? 

 Similarly, A in position 2: if it's correct, we get a check; if not, we get a minus or x? But we know A is in the word, so it won't be x.

 So, let's choose ""RADIO"".

 But note: we are using R and A again. That's okay because we are trying to find their correct positions.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't reuse R and A? But we have to include them because we know they are in the word. 

 Actually, we must include them because we are trying to get more information about their positions.

 So, I'll go with ""RADIO"".

 However, let me think of a word that uses R and A and also includes T, O, I? But we can't have all three? 

 How about ""TRAIL""? We can't because R must be included and we can't put R in position 2.

 Another: ""ARTIS"" -> not a word.

 I think ""RADIO"" is a good choice.

 But wait: what about ""RAINS""? 
   R(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), S(5) -> but N is absent! We cannot use N.

 So, we must avoid N.

 Therefore, ""RADIO"" is valid.

 Let me confirm: 
   R in position 1: we don't know if that's allowed? It is, because we only know R is not in position 2.
   A in position 2: we don't have a restriction for A in position 2? Only that it is not in position 3.

 So, I'll go with ""RADIO"".

 But note: we are using D. We don't know about D. It might be common or not.

 Alternatively, we could use ""ROAST"" if we were allowed to put A in a new position? But we cannot put A in position 3.

 How about ""RALLY""? 
   R(1), A(2), L(3), L(4), Y(5) -> but we have two L's. And we don't know if the word has two L's. Also, we are not testing as many new letters.

 I think ""RADIO"" is better.

 Let me search for a word that has R, A, T, O, I? 

 How about ""RATIO"" (which is the same as ""RADIO"" but rearranged). 
   R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5)

 This is a valid word and tests T, I, O.

 I think ""RATIO"" is slightly better because it has T and I (which are very common) and O.

 So, I'll go with ""RATIO"".

 But wait: in ""RATIO"", we are putting A in position 2 and R in position 1. 

 We know that R is in the word but not in position 2. We are now testing R in position 1. 
 If it's correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus.

 Similarly, A in position 2: we don't have a restriction for A in position 2, so we can test it.

 Therefore, I choose ""RATIO"".

 But note: we are using R and A again. That's okay.

 So, second guess: ""RATIO""

<guess>ratio</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, N, E** are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **R** is present but not in position 2 (marked ""-"").
- **A** is present but not in position 3 (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **R** and **A** (since they are confirmed present).
- Avoid **C, N, E** (absent letters).
- Test new common letters (e.g., **T, I, O**) to gather more information.
- **R** cannot be in position 2, and **A** cannot be in position 3.

The word **""RATIO""** fits these criteria:
- **R** is in position 1 (new position, not 2).
- **A** is in position 2 (new position, not 3).
- Introduces **T, I, O** (common letters not yet tested).
- Valid 5-letter word, avoiding forbidden letters.

This guess efficiently tests new positions for known letters and explores additional common letters.

<guess>ratio</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (absent)
- R: - (present, but not in position 2)
- A: - (present, but not in position 3)
- N: x (absent)
- E: x (absent)

Guess 2: ""ratio""
- R: - (present, but not in position 1)  [since we got '-' for R in position 1]
- A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)      [we got '✓' for A in position 2]
- T: x (absent)
- I: x (absent)
- O: x (absent)

So, from this, we know:

1. The secret word has the letter 'A' in position 2. (because we got a check for A in position 2 in ""ratio"")
2. The letter 'R' is present, but not in position 1 (from ""ratio"") and not in position 2 (from ""crane""). So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
3. The following letters are absent: C, N, E, T, I, O.

Also, from ""crane"", we know that A is not in position 3 (but now we know it's in position 2, so that's consistent).

Now, the secret word has the form: _ A _ _ _

And the letters we know are present: R (in position 3,4, or 5) and (we don't know about duplicates, but so far no duplicates).

We also know the absent letters: C, N, E, T, I, O.

We need to make a third guess that:
- Has 'A' in position 2 (fixed)
- Includes 'R' in one of the positions 3,4,5 (but not 1 or 2)
- Avoids the absent letters: C, N, E, T, I, O
- We can use other common letters to test.

Since we know A is in position 2, we can fix that.

Let's think of words that have the form: _ A _ _ _ and contain the letter R in position 3,4, or 5.

We also want to test other common letters that we haven't tried yet. The remaining common letters include: S, L, U, D, M, P, B, G, etc.

Let's try to form a word:

Option 1: R in position 3: _ A R _ _
We need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth positions with letters that are not in the absent list and form a valid word.

Possible letters: We can use B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Example: ""BARMY"" -> B(1), A(2), R(3), M(4), Y(5). But we don't know about B, M, Y.

But we need to test more letters. However, we must include R in position 3.

Another: ""PARKS"": P(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5). This tests P, K, S.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""PARKS"" uses P, A, R, K, S. None of these are in the absent list (C,N,E,T,I,O). So it's valid.

Option 2: R in position 4: _ A _ R _
Example: ""FAIRY"" -> but we have I and Y? I is absent, so invalid. 
""HAIRY"" -> same issue, I is absent.
""LAIRD"": L(1), A(2), I(3) -> I is absent, invalid.
""MARRY"": M(1), A(2), R(3) -> wait, R is in position 3, not 4. 
We need R in position 4: so _ A _ R _

Another: ""BASER"" -> but E is absent, invalid.
""PAPER"" -> E absent, invalid.
""SAVOR"" -> S(1), A(2), V(3), O(4), R(5) -> but O is absent and R is in position 5, not 4. 
We need R in position 4: so the word must have R in the fourth position.

How about ""LAPSE"": but E and S? E is absent, so invalid.
""MAPLE"": E absent, invalid.

It's hard to find a word with R in position 4 without using absent letters. 

Option 3: R in position 5: _ A _ _ R
Example: ""BAKER"": E absent, invalid.
""MAKER"": E absent, invalid.
""FILER"": I and E absent, invalid.
""HALMR"": not a word.

This is difficult. So maybe R in position 3 or 4 is easier.

Let me try R in position 3: _ A R _ _

We need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth positions.

Possible words:
- ""BARMY"": B(1), A(2), R(3), M(4), Y(5) -> tests B, M, Y
- ""CARDS"": but C is absent, invalid.
- ""PARKS"": P(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5) -> tests P, K, S
- ""MARKS"": M(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5) -> tests M, K, S
- ""BARKS"": B(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5) -> tests B, K, S

All these are valid and use only allowed letters.

We also have the option to test more vowels? But we know the word has A, and we don't have any other vowels known (since E,I,O are absent, and we have A). So we might test U? But we don't know if U is in the word.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we need to be efficient.

We can also consider words that don't have R in position 3? But we know R must be in 3,4, or 5. Since position 4 and 5 are harder, let's stick with position 3.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test common letters and maximize information.

We haven't tested: S, L, D, U, P, M, B, G, etc.

""PARKS"" tests P, K, S.
""BARKS"" tests B, K, S.
""MARKS"" tests M, K, S.

The letter S is common, so testing S is good. K is less common, but we have to use it because we are trying to place R.

But note: we are not sure if the word has S or not. We are testing it.

Alternatively, we could try a word that uses a different set of letters to cover more ground.

But we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

Another idea: we know the word has R and A. We have A fixed at position 2. So the word is ?A??

We can try to use a word that has R in position 4 or 5, but we had trouble finding valid words without absent letters.

Let me try R in position 4 again: 
- _ A _ R _
We need a word: 
  First letter: not C,N,E,T,I,O -> so we can use B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.
  Fourth letter: R
  Fifth letter: not absent.

Example: ""BALMY"": B(1), A(2), L(3), M(4), Y(5) -> but this doesn't have R? We need R in position 4. 
""BALMY"" has M in position 4, not R.

How about ""SALAD"": but two A's? And D. But we have A in position 2 and then again? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are avoiding E? ""SALAD"" has two A's and D. But we don't know about duplicates. Also, we have to avoid E? It doesn't have E, but it has A twice and D. 

But we are not sure if the word has two A's. We know at least one A is in position 2. It might have another A? But we don't know.

We can try, but let's avoid duplicates for now to get more information.

Another word: ""PALER"": but E is absent, invalid.
""MANOR"": M(1), A(2), N(3) -> N is absent! Invalid.
""FAVOR"": F(1), A(2), V(3), O(4), R(5) -> but O is absent and R is in position 5, not 4. 
We need R in position 4: so the fourth letter must be R.

How about ""LAPSE"": but E is absent.

This is difficult. So maybe R in position 5 is easier?

But we already have a candidate for R in position 5: ""BAKER"" is invalid because of E. 

""MAKER"": same.

""FILER"": invalid.

""HALMR"": not a word.

So perhaps R is more likely in position 3? 

Let me think of common words: 
- ""PARIS"": but we have I? I is absent, and also we have I in position 4? But I is absent, so invalid.
- ""BARON"": O is absent, invalid.

Another: ""CARDS"": C absent, invalid.

So, let's stick with R in position 3.

Now, among the candidates: ""BARKS"", ""PARKS"", ""MARKS"", ""BARMY"", etc.

We want to test letters that are more common. S is very common, so we can test a word that includes S.

We also have L, which is common.

How about ""BARKS"": B(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5). 
This tests B, K, S.

But we have to consider that the word might have B, K, S.

Alternatively, we can try ""LARGE"": but E is absent and also G? But E is absent.

How about ""MARSH"": M(1), A(2), R(3), S(4), H(5). 
This tests M, S, H.

But we don't know about H.

Another: ""PARKS"" is similar but with P instead of M.

We can also consider ""R"" in position 4? But we couldn't find a word. 

What about ""GAUZE"": but E and Z? E is absent, invalid.

I think we have to choose from the words we have.

But note: we have another piece of information. In the first guess, we had R in position 2 (which was wrong) and in the second guess we had R in position 1 (which was wrong). Now we are trying R in position 3.

We also know that A is in position 2.

So, let's list the possibilities for the secret word:

Position 1: cannot be C,N,E,T,I,O,C,N,E,T,I,O -> so we can use B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.
Position 2: A (fixed)
Position 3: could be R? or another letter? But we know R is in the word and not in 1 or 2, so 3,4,5.
Position 4 and 5: similarly.

We need to test the position of R and also test new letters.

We have 3 positions to fill: 1, 3,4,5? Actually, position 2 is fixed as A, so we have positions 1,3,4,5 to fill with letters that include R (in 3,4,5) and two more letters? Because we have 5 letters: position1,2,3,4,5 -> we know 2 is A, so we need to test the other positions.

We know the word has R and A. So the other three positions must be filled with letters that are not in the absent list.

We are going to test multiple new letters.

I think ""PARKS"" is a good choice: it tests P, K, S. K is less common, but S is very common.

Alternatively, ""BARKS"" tests B, K, S.

Or ""MARSH"" tests M, S, H.

How about ""LARGE""? But E is absent.

Another word: ""DARKY"": D(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), Y(5). 
This tests D, K, Y.

But Y is less common.

I think ""PARKS"" is a solid choice.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have S. We haven't tested S yet.

So, let's go with ""PARKS"".

But wait: we are putting R in position 3. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't have R in position 3? But we don't have many options.

Another candidate: ""FARCE"": but C and E absent, invalid.

How about ""HARPY"": H(1), A(2), R(3), P(4), Y(5). 
This tests H, P, Y.

But we are missing S.

I think ""PARKS"" is better than ""HARPY"" because S is more common.

But let me see: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""PARKS"" uses P, A, R, K, S. All are allowed.

So, I'll go with ""PARKS"".

But note: we are using K. If the word has K, we'll know. Similarly, P and S.

We might also consider ""BARMY"", but Y is less common.

Another word: ""GARDE"": but E is absent.

I think ""PARKS"" is a valid choice.

But wait: what about the possibility that R is in position 4? We didn't find a word, but maybe there is one.

How about ""WASPY"": W(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5) -> but this doesn't have R? We must include R because we know it's in the word. So we have to include R.

So, we must have R in position 3,4, or 5.

Another word with R in position 4: 
- ""BAJRA""? Not common.
- ""MAJAR"": not common.

How about ""SABER"": but E is absent.

I think we have to go with R in position 3.

So, I choose ""PARKS"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not repeating a position that we know is wrong for R? We are putting R in position 3. We don't have any feedback that position 3 is wrong for R? We only know that position 1 and 2 are wrong for R.

So, let's go with ""PARKS"".

But wait: what about the letter K? We don't know about K. It might be common or not.

Alternatively, we could try a word that uses L, which is very common. 

How about ""LARGE"": but E is absent.

How about ""LARKS"": L(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5). 
This tests L, K, S.

Or ""WARKS"": not common.

I think ""PARKS"" is acceptable.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""PARKS"" is P-A-R-K-S. 
P: not absent? We haven't tested P. 
K: not tested.
S: not tested.

So, let's use ""PARKS"".

But wait: what about the possibility that the word has duplicate letters? We don't have any indication, so we can ignore for now.

Another candidate: ""BARGE"": but E is absent.

I think we have to go with it.

But note: we have to consider that the word might be ""PARIS"", but I is absent and also we have I in position 4? No, ""PARIS"" has I and O? O is absent.

So, let's finalizes: ""PARKS""

But wait, what about ""R"" in position 3? We are using R in position 3. If the secret word has R in position 3, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and then we know R must be in position 4 or 5.

So, let's do it.

Guess: ""PARKS""

But note: we are putting R in position 3. We don't have any feedback that position 3 is wrong for R? Actually, we only know that position 1 and 2 are wrong for R. Position 3 might be correct.

So, we are testing position 3 for R.

If we get a check for R, then we know R is in position 3. If we get a minus, then R is in position 4 or 5.

Similarly, we test P, K, S.

So, it's a good test.

Therefore, I choose ""PARKS"".

But let me check if there's a word that tests more common letters. 

Another idea: ""SARIS"": S(1), A(2), R(3), I(4) -> I is absent, invalid.

""SAVOR"": O absent.

I think ""PARKS"" is fine.

So, the guess is ""PARKS"".

But note: we are using K. If we don't want to use K, we could try ""BARKS"" (B instead of P). But P is more common than B? In wordle, P is common.

Actually, in wordle, S is the most common, then L, then ... then K, then P, etc.

But we are testing S at the end, which is common.

So, I'll go with ""PARKS"".

But wait: what about ""R"" in position 3? We are testing it.

So, let's output ""PARKS"".

But note: we have to make sure we don't use absent letters. ""PARKS"" has P, A, R, K, S. None of these are in the absent list (C,N,E,T,I,O).

So, it's valid.

Therefore, the third guess is ""PARKS"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R and A are present but not in positions 2 or 3, respectively. C, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""ratio"")**: A is correct in position 2 (✓). R is present but not in position 1 (-). T, I, O are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. **A is fixed in position 2** (from ""ratio"" feedback: ✓).
2. **R is present** but cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from both guesses). It must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
3. **Absent letters**: C, N, E, T, I, O (cannot be used).
4. **Unknown positions**: 1, 3, 4, 5 need to be solved, with R one of them (in 3,4, or 5).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Must include R** in position 3, 4, or 5 (since positions 1 and 2 are invalid for R).
- **A must be in position 2** (fixed).
- **Avoid absent letters** (C, N, E, T, I, O).
- Test new common letters (e.g., S, L, P, M) to gather more information.
- Prioritize words with R in position 3 (as position 4/5 is harder to form valid words without absent letters).

The word **""PARKS""** fits perfectly:
- **P** (new letter, tests position 1)
- **A** (fixed in position 2)
- **R** (placed in position 3 to test if it's correct)
- **K** (new letter, tests position 4)
- **S** (new letter, tests position 5)

This guess:
- Tests R in position 3 (if correct, we get ✓; if not, we learn R is in 4/5).
- Tests three new common letters (P, K, S).
- Avoids all absent letters.

<guess>parks</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(x)
Guess 3: parks -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) K(x) S(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent (x)
- R: present, wrong position (-)
- A: present, wrong position (-)
- N: absent (x)
- E: absent (x)

Guess 2: ""ratio""
- R: present, wrong position (-)  [now we know R is not in position 1 or 2]
- A: correct (✓) in position 2
- T: absent (x)
- I: absent (x)
- O: absent (x)

Guess 3: ""parks""
- P: absent (x)
- A: correct (✓) in position 2
- R: correct (✓) in position 3
- K: absent (x)
- S: absent (x)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. The secret word has:
   - A in position 2 (from guess 2 and 3)
   - R in position 3 (from guess 3: R is correct in position 3)

2. So the word so far is: _ A R _ _

3. We know the following letters are absent: C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S.

4. We also know that R is in position 3, so we don't need to test R again.

5. We know A is in position 2, so we don't need to test A.

6. We need to find the letters for positions 1, 4, and 5.

7. The word must contain only letters that are not in the absent list. The absent letters are: C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S.

8. The remaining letters that are possible: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, V, W, Y, and possibly others.

Now, we need to form a word that fits: _ A R _ _

We have to fill positions 1, 4, and 5 with letters from the remaining set, avoiding the absent letters.

Let's think of common words that fit the pattern:

- Position 1: a consonant or vowel? We can try common letters.

Possible words:

- ""BARGE"": but E is absent -> invalid.
- ""BARRE"": has E and two R's? E absent, and also we have R in position 3, but position 2 is A, so ""BARRE"" would be B,A,R,R,E -> but E is absent and also we have two R's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, E is absent so invalid.

We must avoid E.

- ""MARRY"": M,A,R,R,Y -> but we have two R's? And Y. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are using R again? But we know R is in position 3, so if we put R in position 4, that would be a duplicate? But we don't know if the word has two R's.

But note: we have only one R so far in the feedback? Actually, we don't know. The feedback doesn't show duplicates. But we can try.

However, we are trying to get information. Using a word with duplicate R might not be efficient because if we get a check for one R, we don't know about the other.

But we are forced to use the pattern _ A R _ _

We need to test letters for positions 1,4,5.

We can try to use a word that has new letters and avoids duplicates for now.

Let me list possible words:

- ""BARMY"": B(1), A(2), R(3), M(4), Y(5) -> tests B, M, Y. But we don't know about duplicates? And we are using M and Y.

But we don't have any duplicate in this word.

- ""HARPY"": but H(1), A(2), R(3), P(4), Y(5) -> but P is absent (from guess 3: P is absent). So invalid.

- ""LARDY"": L(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5) -> tests L, D, Y. L, D, Y are not in the absent list.

This seems valid.

- ""MARRY"": M(1), A(2), R(3), R(4), Y(5) -> but this has two R's. We know R is in position 3, so if we put R in position 4, we are testing for a duplicate. But we don't know if the word has two R's. Also, we are using R again, which we already know is in the word. It might be better to test new letters.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another word: ""WARTY"": W(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), Y(5) -> but T is absent (from guess 2: T is absent). So invalid.

""CARDS"": C absent.

""BARDS"": C absent.

""FARGO"": F(1), A(2), R(3), G(4), O(5) -> O is absent, invalid.

""MARSH"": S absent? S is absent from guess 3. So invalid.

""LARVA"": L(1), A(2), R(3), V(4), A(5) -> but we have two A's? And we don't know about duplicates. Also, A is already in position 2, so if we put A in position 5, we are testing for a duplicate. But we know A is in position 2, so if we get a check for A in position 5, that would be a duplicate. But we don't know if there is a duplicate.

However, we are trying to get information. Using a word with duplicate might not be efficient.

But we have to fill the positions.

Another word: ""DARBY"": D(1), A(2), R(3), B(4), Y(5). 
This tests D, B, Y.

But we don't know about duplicates? And we are not using any duplicate.

""DARBY"" is a word? It means a type of hawk, I think.

But let's see: we have to avoid absent letters. D, B, Y are not absent? 
Absent letters: C,N,E,T,I,O,P,K,S. So D, B, Y are allowed.

But we have to test new letters.

We can also consider ""HARDY"": H(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5). 
This tests H, D, Y.

But we don't know about duplicates.

Alternatively, ""LARDY"" as I thought earlier: L(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5). 
This tests L, D, Y.

""LARDY"" is a valid word (meaning fat or oily).

Another: ""MARDY"": M(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5). 
Similarly, tests M, D, Y.

But we don't know about duplicates.

We can also try to use a word that has a vowel in position 4 or 5? We have only position 1,4,5 to fill. We know the word has at least A and R, and we have three positions to fill.

But we don't know if the word has more vowels? We have A already, and we know E,I,O are absent. So the only vowel left is U? And sometimes Y.

So, the word might have U or Y as a vowel? But in position 4 or 5.

For example, ""BARUM"": but U? And M. But ""BARUM"" is not common.

""WARNS"": but W(1), A(2), R(3), N(4), S(5) -> N and S are absent, invalid.

""CARDS"": C absent.

I think we have to accept that we might have to test with duplicates or use Y.

But let me think of words without duplicates:

- ""BALMY"": but L and M? But ""BALMY"" is B,A,L,M,Y. But we need R in position 3? This is B,A,L,M,Y -> no R. So invalid.

We must have R in position 3.

So, the pattern is fixed: _ A R _ _

We need to fill the blanks with letters not in {C,N,E,T,I,O,P,K,S} and not R or A (but we can use other letters, but we don't have to avoid R and A in the blanks? Actually, we can use them if we suspect duplicates, but we have no evidence of duplicates so far. So we should avoid using R and A in the blanks to test new letters.

So, positions 1,4,5 must be filled with letters that are not in the absent list and not R or A? Not necessarily, but if we use R or A in these positions, we might get a duplicate, but we don't know if the word has a duplicate. So to test efficiently, we should use new letters.

But we have to form a valid word.

So, let's look for words that start with a consonant (or vowel) and then R, then two more letters.

Possible words:

- ""DARBY"" (if accepted): D, A, R, B, Y -> tests D, B, Y.
- ""HARDY"": H, A, R, D, Y -> tests H, D, Y.
- ""LARDY"": L, A, R, D, Y -> tests L, D, Y.
- ""MARDY"": M, A, R, D, Y -> tests M, D, Y.
- ""WARLY"": W, A, R, L, Y -> tests W, L, Y.
- ""BARNY"": B, A, R, N, Y -> but N is absent, invalid.
- ""JARUL"": not a word.

We can also try ""FARCE"", but C and E absent.

How about ""HAREM"": but E is absent and M? ""HAREM"" has E, invalid.

""BARRE"": has E, invalid.

""CARME"": C absent.

I think ""LARDY"" is a good candidate: it tests L, D, Y.

But we have to consider that the word might have duplicate R? We know R is in position 3, but if we put R in position 4? We are not doing that in this word.

In ""LARDY"", we have no duplicate.

Similarly, ""HARDY"" has no duplicate.

But we are testing the same letters: for position 1, we test H, M, B, W, etc.

We need to choose one.

But note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on the fourth guess. We can try to cover more common letters.

The most common letters left: L, D, Y, M, H, W, etc.

""LARDY"" tests L, D, Y.

""HARDY"" tests H, D, Y.

""MARDY"" tests M, D, Y.

I think ""LARDY"" is a good choice because L is a very common letter.

But we have to make sure that we are not missing something.

Another word: ""BARNY"": invalid because of N.

""JARUL"" not a word.

""VARNA"": but N absent.

""GAUZE"": E absent.

I think we have to go with one of these.

But wait: what about ""DARBS""? Not a word.

Or ""LARVA"": but V and A again? And duplicate A? But we don't know. And ""LARVA"" has V and A, but we are not testing duplicates? Actually, we are testing L, A, V, R, A? Wait, ""LARVA"" is L,A,R,V,A -> so positions: L(1), A(2), R(3), V(4), A(5). 
This has duplicate A. But we know A is in position 2, so if we put A in position 5, we are testing for a duplicate. But we don't know if the word has two A's.

However, we are on the fourth guess, and we have to test. But using a duplicate might not give us new information if there is only one A.

But we don't know. So it's risky.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have A in position 5? But we don't know.

Given the constraints, I think ""LARDY"" is a safe choice.

But let me check if there is a word that tests more common letters.

How about ""HARDY"" or ""LARDY"".

I think both are good. Let's choose ""HARDY"" because H is a common letter.

But we have to avoid the absent letters. ""HARDY"" uses H, A, R, D, Y. 
- H: not tested
- D: not tested
- Y: not tested

And it fits the pattern.

Similarly, ""LARDY"" uses L, A, R, D, Y.

Now, which one? H vs L.

H is more common than L? In English, H is more common than L? Actually, L is more common.

But we are testing two letters: one in position 1 and one in position 4 and 5.

We can also consider ""WARTY"": but T is absent.

""BARFY"": not common.

I think both are valid. Let's pick ""HARDY"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not using absent letters. ""HARDY"" is H,A,R,D,Y. 
- H: not absent? No, H has not been tested.
- D: not absent.
- Y: not absent.

So, it's valid.

Similarly, ""LARDY"" is L,A,R,D,Y.

I'll go with ""HARDY"" to test H.

But wait: we have to consider that the word might be ""HARDY"" itself? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we could try a word that uses U? But we don't have a word that fits and has U.

For example, ""GUARD"": but U,A,R,D -> but A is in position 2? ""GUARD"" is G,U,A,R,D -> positions: G(1), U(2) -> but we need A in position 2? No, in ""GUARD"", A is in position 3? 
G(1), U(2), A(3) -> but we need A in position 2. So invalid.

We must have A in position 2 and R in position 3.

So, the word must be: [letter] A R [letter] [letter]

We have to choose from the available letters.

I think ""HARDY"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there is a word with U. 

""RARER"": but E is absent and R duplicate? Also, E absent.

""PARER"": E absent.

I don't think there is a common word with U that fits.

So, I'll go with ""HARDY"".

But wait: what about ""BARMY""? B(1), A(2), R(3), M(4), Y(5). 
This tests B, M, Y.

H is more common than B? In English, H is more frequent.

But we are testing H in position 1.

Similarly, ""HARDY"" tests H in position 1, D in position 4, Y in position 5.

We can also consider ""MARSH"": but S is absent.

Another: ""DARKY"": D(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), Y(5) -> but K is absent (from guess 3). So invalid.

""HAIRY"": H(1), A(2), I(3) -> I is absent, invalid.

So, ""HARDY"" seems good.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""HARDY"" is H,A,R,D,Y. 
- H: allowed
- D: allowed
- Y: allowed

So, it's valid.

Therefore, I choose ""HARDY"".

But wait: what if the word is ""HARDY""? Then we get it right.

But we are guessing, so it might be.

Alternatively, we could try a word that tests more vowels? But we only have position 4 and 5 to test, and the word must have a vowel? We have A already, and we know E,I,O are absent. So the only vowel left is U or Y. Position 4 and 5 could be U or Y.

For example, ""HARDY"" has Y, which is a vowel-like letter.

But we don't know if Y is in the word.

Another word: ""WARNS"": invalid because of N and S.

""BARNS"": N and S absent.

I think ""HARDY"" is a good guess.

So, let's go with ""HARDY"".

But note: we are using D and Y. We haven't tested D or Y.

We could test L and D? But we can't test both in one word without using a duplicate or missing position.

We have to choose one.

Another candidate: ""BARDY"" - not a common word.

I think ""HARDY"" is acceptable.

So, fourth guess: ""HARDY""

But wait: what about ""LARGE""? E absent.

I think we have to make this guess.

But note: we have to consider that the word might be ""LARGE"", but E is absent.

So, let's finalize: ""HARDY""

But wait, what about ""DARKY""? Invalid because of K and T absent? K and T are absent.

No.

So, I think ""HARDY"" is a good choice.

Therefore, the guess is ""HARDY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **A is confirmed in position 2** (from ""ratio"" and ""parks"" feedback: ✓).
- **R is confirmed in position 3** (from ""parks"" feedback: ✓).
- **Absent letters**: C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).
- **Present letters**: A (position 2), R (position 3), and one more letter (since the word is 5 letters).

### Current Knowledge:
- Secret word pattern: `[position1] A R [position4] [position5]`
- Position 1, 4, and 5 must be filled with letters not in the absent list.
- Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, V, W, Y, etc. (since C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S are absent).
- We need to test new common letters to identify the missing letters.

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **Focus on positions 1, 4, and 5**.
- Test high-frequency remaining letters (e.g., D, L, M, H, Y) to maximize information.
- Avoid reusing absent letters and avoid reusing R and A in positions 1, 4, or 5 (since we already know R is in position 3 and A is in position 2).
- Prioritize words that test three new letters in one guess to narrow down possibilities.

The word **""HARDY""** fits perfectly:
- **H** (new, tests position 1)
- **A** (fixed in position 2)
- **R** (fixed in position 3)
- **D** (new, tests position 4)
- **Y** (new, tests position 5)

This guess:
- Tests H, D, and Y (common letters).
- Avoids all absent letters.
- If incorrect, the feedback will reveal which of H, D, or Y (if any) are present and in the right positions.

<guess>hardy</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(x)
Guess 3: parks -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) K(x) S(x)
Guess 4: hardy -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(x) Y(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent
- R: present, wrong position (not 2)
- A: present, wrong position (not 3)
- N: absent
- E: absent

Guess 2: ""ratio""
- R: present, wrong position (not 1)
- A: correct in position 2
- T: absent
- I: absent
- O: absent

Guess 3: ""parks""
- P: absent
- A: correct in position 2
- R: correct in position 3
- K: absent
- S: absent

Guess 4: ""hardy""
- H: absent
- A: correct in position 2
- R: correct in position 3
- D: absent
- Y: correct in position 5? Wait, the feedback for ""hardy"" is: H(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(x) Y(✓)

But the feedback says:
- H: absent (x)
- A: correct (✓) in position 2
- R: correct (✓) in position 3
- D: absent (x)
- Y: correct (✓) in position 5

So, from this:
- Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).
- A is in position 2 (already known).
- R is in position 3 (already known).
- H and D are absent.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: R
- Position 5: Y
- And we know from previous that R is also in position 3 (now confirmed), and A in position 2 (confirmed), and Y in position 5 (confirmed).

So the word is: _ A R _ Y

We are missing positions 1 and 4.

Also, we know the absent letters: C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S, H, D.

So the absent letters are: C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S, H, D.

We need to find a word that fits: [letter1] A R [letter4] Y

Letter1 and letter4 must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the absent letters.

Remaining possible letters: B, F, G, L, M, U, V, W, X, Z, and possibly others, but we'll focus on common ones.

We know the word must have Y at the end, and we have A and R in the middle.

Now, what words fit this pattern?

Common words: 
- ""BARMY"": but M? And we have to check if M is allowed. M is not in the absent list. But ""BARMY"" is B,A,R,M,Y. 
  - Position 1: B
  - Position 2: A
  - Position 3: R
  - Position 4: M
  - Position 5: Y

But we haven't tested B and M.

- ""LARDY"": but D is absent, so invalid. We know D is absent from guess 4.

- ""MARVY"": M,A,R,V,Y -> tests M and V. ""MARVY"" is a word (meaning very good or excellent).

- ""WARZY"": not a word.

- ""CARVY"": not a word and C absent.

- ""FARCY"": not a word and C absent.

- ""JARLY"": not a word.

- ""BARNY"": but N absent.

- ""LARZY"": not a word.

- ""BARFY"": not common.

- ""LARZY"": not a word.

- ""MARRY"": but we have Y at the end? ""MARRY"" is M,A,R,R,Y -> but this has two R's? And in position 4, we have R. But we know R is in position 3, so if we put R in position 4, that would be a duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

However, in the feedback for ""hardy"", we have Y as correct in position 5, so the word ends with Y. And we have A and R in positions 2 and 3.

So, ""MARRY"" would be M,A,R,R,Y -> but then position 4 is R, which is duplicate. But we don't know if the word has two R's.

But we have to consider the possibility.

But let's see the feedback: in ""hardy"", we had D absent, so D is not in the word. And H absent.

But we know the word has Y at the end, so it must be ""MARRY"" if we consider duplicate R.

But we have to test.

Another word: ""BARMY"" as above.

Also, ""MARVY"": M,A,R,V,Y.

And ""RALLY"": but L and L? And we have Y at the end? ""RALLY"" is R,A,L,L,Y -> but R is in position 1? We need R in position 3. So not.

The pattern is fixed: position 3 is R, position 5 is Y.

So, we need words of the form: ? A R ? Y

Now, what about ""BARFY""? Not common.

""CARVY"": not a word.

""JARUL"": not a word.

""VARAY"": not a word.

""KARZY"": not a word and K absent.

So, common words: 
- ""BARMY"": B,A,R,M,Y
- ""MARVY"": M,A,R,V,Y
- ""WARZY"": not a word.

Also, ""LARZY"": not a word.

What about ""FARCY""? Not a word.

I think ""BARMY"" and ""MARVY"" are candidates.

But we also have ""JAZZY"": but that has Z and Z, and A in position 2? J,A,Z,Z,Y -> position 3 is Z, not R. So invalid.

We need position 3 to be R.

So, only a few options.

Another: ""PARZY"": not a word.

""RABBY"": not a word.

So, we have ""BARMY"" and ""MARVY"".

But we need to choose one.

We can also consider ""HARPY"": but H is absent, so invalid.

""LARVA"": but V? And A in position 2, but position 3 is R? ""LARVA"" is L,A,R,V,A -> but this has A in position 5? And we have A in position 2, so if we put A in position 5, that would be a duplicate? But we don't know.

But in the pattern, we have position 5 as Y, so it cannot be A. So ""LARVA"" would have A in position 5, which conflicts because we know position 5 is Y.

So, we cannot have A in position 5. Therefore, ""LARVA"" is invalid because it would require A in position 5, but we know position 5 is Y.

Similarly, any word with A in position 5 is invalid because we know A is in position 2 and we have no evidence of a duplicate A? But we don't know for sure.

But from the feedback, in guess 1, A was present but not in position 3, and in guess 2, A was correct in position 2, so if there were a duplicate A, we might have seen it? Not necessarily, because we only tested A in position 3 in guess 1 and in position 2 in guess 2. We haven't tested A in other positions.

But in guess 4, we tested A only in position 2 (which is correct) and not elsewhere.

So, it's possible that there is a duplicate A? But we don't have evidence.

However, in the pattern, we have position 5 as Y, so if we put A in position 4, that would be a duplicate? But we don't know.

But let's look at the candidates:

- ""BARMY"": B,A,R,M,Y -> no duplicate A.
- ""MARVY"": M,A,R,V,Y -> no duplicate A.
- ""LARVA"": L,A,R,V,A -> has duplicate A. But position 5 is Y, so if we put A in position 5, it conflicts. Also, in ""LARVA"", position 5 is A, but we know it must be Y. So invalid.

Therefore, we cannot have a word with A in position 5. So any word with A in position 4 would be even better? But we don't have many options.

Another word: ""BARFY"" is not common.

""CARVY"": not a word.

""JARUL"": not a word.

So, we are left with ""BARMY"" and ""MARVY"".

We also have ""WARZY"", but not common.

""RABBY"": not a word.

I think ""BARMY"" and ""MARVY"" are the main candidates.

Now, we need to choose one.

We can also consider ""FARCY"", but C absent.

Another: ""HARZY"": H absent.

So, let's list:

- ""BARMY"": B, A, R, M, Y
- ""MARVY"": M, A, R, V, Y

We haven't tested B, M, V.

We can choose one.

But note: we are on the fifth guess, and we have two possibilities. We can pick one.

Alternatively, we could try a word that tests more letters? But we only have two positions to fill: position 1 and position 4.

We have to guess a word that fits the pattern.

We can try ""BARMY"" to test B and M.

If it's not, then we try ""MARVY"" next.

But we have only two guesses left (since we are on guess 5, and we get 6 tries, so two more after this? No, we are making the fifth guess now, and we have one more after if needed).

But we can solve it.

Another word: ""LARZY"" not a word.

""VARZY"": not a word.

""ZARFY"": not a word.

I think ""BARMY"" and ""MARVY"" are the only common words.

But let me check: is ""MARVY"" a word? Yes, meaning excellent.

""BARMY"" is also a word, meaning crazy.

But we can also consider ""JAZZY"": but position 3 is Z, not R.

No.

So, I'll go with ""BARMY"" to test B and M.

But we have to make a guess.

Alternatively, we can think: is there a word that uses more common letters? B and M are both common.

But we have to choose.

Another idea: we know the word has Y at the end, and we have A and R in the middle. We can try ""BARMY"".

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""BARMY"" uses B, A, R, M, Y. 
- B: not tested
- M: not tested

And it fits the pattern.

Similarly, ""MARVY"" uses M, A, R, V, Y.

V is less common than M? In letters, M is more common than V.

But we are testing M in both.

We can also consider ""WARZY"", but not common.

I think ""BARMY"" is a good choice.

But let me see: if we guess ""BARMY"" and it's wrong, we get feedback on B and M.

Similarly for ""MARVY"".

But we have two possibilities, so we can pick one.

Since we are on the fifth guess, and we have two options, we can try ""BARMY"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not missing the word ""MARVY"".

We don't know.

But let's look at the frequency: M is more common than B? In English, M is more common than B.

But we are testing both.

We can also consider ""FARMY"": F,A,R,M,Y -> F is not tested. ""FARMY"" is a word? It might be, but less common.

I think ""BARMY"" is more common.

But let me check the dictionary: ""barmy"" is valid, ""marvy"" is valid.

Both are acceptable.

But we have to choose one.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't use M or B? But we have to fill the pattern.

We can try ""LARVA"", but that has A in position 4? ""LARVA"" is L,A,R,V,A -> positions: L(1), A(2), R(3), V(4), A(5). 
But position 5 must be Y, not A. So invalid.

We cannot have A in position 5.

So, back to ""BARMY"" and ""MARVY"".

I think I'll go with ""BARMY"" to test B.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""BARMY"" uses B, A, R, M, Y. 
- B: not absent
- M: not absent
- Y: we know is present and in position 5.

So, it's valid.

But wait: what if the word is ""MARVY""? Then we miss.

But we have to guess.

We can also consider ""WARTY"", but T is absent.

No.

So, I think ""BARMY"" is a good guess.

But let me see if there is a word that uses L or F or others.

""BARFY"": not common.

""CARVY"": not a word.

I think we have to choose between ""BARMY"" and ""MARVY"".

Let me pick ""MARVY"" because M is more common than B.

But in terms of frequency, M is more common than V? Actually, in English, V is less common than M? 

According to letter frequency, M is more common than V.

But we are testing both.

We can also consider ""FARMY"": F,A,R,M,Y -> F is not tested. ""FARMY"" is a word? It might be, but less common.

""FARMY"" is not standard.

""WARMY"": not a word.

So, I think ""MARVY"" is a better choice because M is more common.

But let me check: ""MARVY"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""BARMY"" is also valid.

But we have to make a decision.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that tests F? But we don't have a word with F in position 1 or 4.

For example, ""FARCY"" invalid.

""PARVY"": not a word.

So, I think we have to choose between ""BARMY"" and ""MARVY"".

I'll go with ""MARVY"" because it tests M (more common) and V (less common, so if it's not, we know V is absent and then it must be ""BARMY"").

But we have two guesses left, so we can afford to be wrong once.

But we are on the fifth guess, and we have one more after if needed.

So, let's choose ""MARVY"".

But note: we have to write the guess.

Alternatively, we can think: is there a word that uses L? For example, ""LARVA"" but that doesn't end with Y.

We need to end with Y.

""LARVA"" doesn't end with Y.

""CARVY"": not a word.

I think ""MARVY"" is the better choice.

But let me see: ""MARVY"" means excellent, and it's a valid word.

So, I'll go with ""MARVY"".

But wait: what about ""BARMY""? It means crazy, also valid.

But ""MARVY"" is more sophisticated.

We can also consider ""FARMY"", but it's not standard.

I think we have to go with ""MARVY"".

So, fifth guess: ""MARVY""

But note: we are putting M in position 1 and V in position 4.

If the word is ""MARVY"", we get it right.

If not, then we know it must be ""BARMY"" or another word.

But there is also ""WARTY"", but T is absent.

Another word: ""BARZY"": not a word.

So, I think ""MARVY"" is a good guess.

Therefore, the guess is ""MARVY"".Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **A is confirmed in position 2** (from ""ratio"" and ""parks"" feedback: ✓).
- **R is confirmed in position 3** (from ""parks"" and ""hardy"" feedback: ✓).
- **Y is confirmed in position 5** (from ""hardy"" feedback: ✓).
- **Absent letters**: C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S, H, D (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).
- **Present letters**: A (position 2), R (position 3), Y (position 5), and one more letter (position 1 and 4) that is not in the absent list.

### Current Knowledge:
- Secret word pattern: `[position1] A R [position4] Y`
- Position 1 and 4 must be filled with letters not in the absent list (available: B, F, G, L, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.).
- We know the word must be a valid English word ending with ""ARY"" (specifically, ""A R _ Y""), but with the fourth letter being the key.

### Strategy for Guess 5:
- **Focus on positions 1 and 4**.
- Test high-frequency available letters (e.g., M, L, F, B) to identify the missing letters.
- Only two candidates remain: **""MARVY""** (M in position 1, V in position 4) and **""BARMY""** (B in position 1, M in position 4). 
- ""MARVY"" is chosen because M is more common than B in English, and V is a less common letter that, if absent, will confirm ""BARMY"" as the solution.

If ""MARVY"" is incorrect, we will know that position 1 must be B and position 4 must be M (resulting in ""BARMY""), as ""BARMY"" is the only other valid option.

Our restriction for A is that it cannot be in position 3. So position 2 is allowed for A.\n - S and T are new.\n\n However, we must note that the feedback for ""crane"" told us that R is in the word but not in position 2, and A is in the word but not in position 3. It doesn\'t say anything about other positions.\n\n But wait: in ""ROAST"", A is in position 2. We don\'t have any feedback that A cannot be in position 2. So that\'s okay.\n\n However, we must also consider that the word must be valid.\n\n But note: we have to avoid using C, N, E. ""ROAST"" doesn\'t have these, so it\'s okay.\n\n Let me check: R, O, A, S, T.\n\n But we have two known letters: R and A. We are including them. The new letters are O, S, T.\n\n This seems like a good candidate because it tests three new letters.\n\n Alternatively, we could try ""PARTY"", but that has T and Y. However, we don\'t know about T and Y.\n\n Another idea: ""RAISE"" -> but we have to avoid E? Actually, E is absent, so we cannot use E. So ""RAISE"" has E -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""RADIO""? \n - R in position 1 -> allowed.\n - A in position 2 -> allowed (since we only know A isn\'t in position 3).\n - But we have D, I, O. And we avoid C, N, E.\n\n However, we are introducing three new letters: D, I, O.\n\n But note: we have two known letters (R and A) and three new ones. That\'s efficient.\n\n Another candidate: ""STARK"" -> but we don\'t have A in this word? We must include A because we know it\'s in the word. So we have to include A.\n\n So, we must have a word that includes R and A.\n\n Let me list a few words that include R and A, and avoid C, N, E:\n\n - ROAST: R, O, A, S, T -> positions: R(1), O(2), A(3), S(4), T(5)\n   But note: in the first guess, A was in position 3 and we were told it\'s in the word but wrong position. \n   Now we are putting A in position 3 again? That would be the same position. We know A is not in position 3, so we cannot put A in position 3 again.\n\n   So we must avoid putting A in position 3.\n\n   In ""ROAST"", A is in position 3 -> not allowed.\n\n - How about ""RATIO""? \n   R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5). \n   Here, A is in position 2 -> allowed.\n\n - ""RADIO"": R(1), A(2), D(3), I(4), O(5) -> A in position 2 -> allowed.\n\n - ""ARTSY"": but A is in position 1 -> allowed, but the word has Y and S, and we don\'t know about them. Also, we have to avoid E? It doesn\'t have E.\n\n But note: we have to use valid words. ""ARTSY"" is valid? It\'s a word (meaning artistic). But let\'s see if we can get more common words.\n\n Another: ""PARTY"": P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), Y(5) -> A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 3 (allowed, because we only know it\'s not in position 2).\n\n But we have to avoid C, N, E. ""PARTY"" doesn\'t have these.\n\n However, we have two known letters (A and R) and we are putting R in position 3 and A in position 2. That\'s acceptable.\n\n But note: we also want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n Let me compare:\n\n Option 1: ""RADIO"" -> letters: R, A, D, I, O. We test D, I, O.\n Option 2: ""PARTY"" -> letters: P, A, R, T, Y. We test P, T, Y.\n Option 3: ""ROAST"" is invalid because A is in position 3.\n\n Another word: ""RAILS"" -> R(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), S(5). \n   A is in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed). We test I, L, S.\n\n But note: we have to avoid using the same letter twice? We are using R and A only once.\n\n We want to maximize new letters. Also, we want to cover common letters.\n\n Let\'s think about frequencies: \n   In English, S, T, L, O, I are common.\n\n So, ""RAILS"" uses R, A, I, L, S -> that\'s five new letters? Actually, we are using R and A, but we are testing three new ones.\n\n Alternatively, ""RADIO"" uses R, A, D, I, O -> testing D, I, O.\n\n ""PARTY"": P, A, R, T, Y -> testing P, T, Y.\n\n The most common letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. But we know E, N, C are absent. So we should test I, O, T, S, L.\n\n So, a word that includes R and A and tests I, O, T, S, L? That would be ideal.\n\n How about ""RASPY""? \n   R(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5). \n   A is in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed). We test S, P, Y.\n\n But we are missing O, I, T.\n\n Another: ""TRAIL"" -> T(1), R(2) -> wait, R is in position 2? But we know R is not in position 2? \n   Actually, the feedback for the first guess: R was in position 2 and we got a \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not in that position. \n   So we cannot put R in position 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it\'s not there. \n   So we should avoid putting R in position 2.\n\n In ""TRAIL"", R is in position 2 -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""STARK""? But we don\'t have A. We must include A.\n\n How about ""ARTSY""? A(1), R(2) -> R in position 2 is not allowed.\n\n How about ""RALLY""? \n   R(1), A(2), L(3), L(4), Y(5) -> but we have two L\'s? And we don\'t know if L is in the word. Also, we are repeating L? \n   But the word ""RALLY"" has two L\'s. We don\'t know if the secret word has repeated letters. But to maximize information, we might avoid repeats.\n\n Alternatively, ""RAILS"" (as I thought earlier) is without repeats and covers I, L, S.\n\n Another: ""RAPID"": R(1), A(2), P(3), I(4), D(5) -> A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed). We test P, I, D.\n\n But we are missing S, T, L.\n\n How about ""ROTLS""? Not a word.\n\n After considering, I think ""RAILS"" is a good candidate:\n   R in position 1 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed), then I, L, S.\n\n But note: we have to make sure we don\'t use any of the absent letters (C, N, E). ""RAILS"" is clean.\n\n However, we have to consider that the secret word might have the letter in a different position. We are testing R in position 1 and A in position 2.\n\n Alternatively, we could try to put R in a different position, say position 4 or 5? \n\n For example, ""PLANT"" has N and we know N is absent. So invalid.\n\n How about ""SPRAY"": \n   S(1), P(2), R(3), A(4), Y(5). \n   Here, R is in position 3 (allowed) and A is in position 4 (allowed, because we only know it\'s not in position 3). \n   We test S, P, Y.\n\n But we are not using the fact that we know A is in the word. We are using A.\n\n However, we are not using R in a new position? We are using R in position 3, which is new.\n\n But note: we have two known letters (R and A) and we are using them. Also, we are testing S, P, Y.\n\n But we are missing the opportunity to test more vowels? We already have A, and we know E is absent. So we might test O or I.\n\n Since we have two vowels already (A and ? we don\'t know), we might want to test O or I.\n\n Let me try to form a word that has R, A, and also O and I? \n\n How about ""ORBIT""? \n   O(1), R(2) -> wait, R in position 2 is not allowed.\n\n How about ""ROBIN"": \n   R(1), O(2), B(3), I(4), N(5) -> but N is absent! We cannot use N.\n\n How about ""ROBIA""? Not a common word.\n\n How about ""RADIO"" (which we considered earlier) -> R(1), A(2), D(3), I(4), O(5). \n   This has A in position 2 (allowed) and R in position 1 (allowed). We test D, I, O.\n\n This seems good.\n\n But note: we are using R in position 1 and A in position 2. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\n Alternatively, we could try to put R in position 4 or 5? \n\n For example, ""PLAIN"": \n   P(1), L(2), A(3) -> but A in position 3 is not allowed (we know A is not in position 3). So invalid.\n\n How about ""PARIS"": \n   P(1), A(2), R(3), I(4), S(5). \n   A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 3 (allowed). We test P, I, S.\n\n This is also a candidate.\n\n Now, which one to choose? \n\n We want to test as many common letters as possible and avoid repeating known positions for R and A.\n\n Let me list the positions we are using for R and A in our candidates:\n\n - ""RADIO"": R(1), A(2)\n - ""PARTY"": P(1), A(2), R(3) -> note: R is in position 3 (which is new) and A in position 2 (new position for A).\n - ""RAILS"": R(1), A(2), then I(3), L(4), S(5) -> R in 1, A in 2, then I, L, S.\n\n The word ""PARTY"" uses the same positions for R and A as ""RADIO"" but then we test P, T, Y. \n\n Since we have two letters that we know are in the word, we might want to try to place them in positions we haven\'t tried. \n In the first guess, we had R in position 2 and A in position 3. Now we are trying A in position 2 and R in position 1 (in ""RADIO"") or in position 3 (in ""PARTY"").\n\n We don\'t have any information about position 1, so trying R in position 1 is a new position.\n\n Similarly, for A: we tried position 3 and now we try position 2.\n\n I think ""RADIO"" is a good choice because it tests three new vowels and consonants.\n\n But note: the secret word might not have O, I, D. We are testing them.\n\n Alternatively, we could try a word that uses more common consonants like S, T, L.\n\n How about ""STAIR"": \n   S(1), T(2), A(3) -> but A in position 3 is not allowed.\n\n How about ""TRAIL"": \n   T(1), R(2) -> R in position 2 is not allowed.\n\n How about ""RATIO"": \n   R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5) -> A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed). We test T, I, O.\n\n This is similar to ""RADIO"" but instead of D, we test T, I, O.\n\n ""RATIO"" is a valid word.\n\n Now, between ""RADIO"", ""RATIO"", ""PARTY"", and ""RAILS"", which one?\n\n We want to cover more common letters. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. \n Since E, N, C are out, we can try T, O, I, S, L.\n\n ""RATIO"" has T, I, O -> that\'s three common letters.\n\n ""PARTY"" has P, T, Y -> Y is less common.\n\n ""RAILS"" has I, L, S -> that\'s three common letters.\n\n But note: in ""RAILS"", we are using R in position 1 and A in position 2. Then we have I, L, S in positions 3,4,5.\n\n In ""RATIO"", we have R in 1, A in 2, then T, I, O.\n\n I think ""RATIO"" is a good choice because it tests T, I, O which are very common.\n\n But wait: we have to avoid using letters we know are absent? We know C, N, E are absent, so ""RATIO"" is safe.\n\n Alternatively, we could try ""ROAST"" but we cannot because A would be in position 3 (which is forbidden).\n\n Another candidate: ""RASPY"" -> R(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5). \n   We test S, P, Y.\n\n But we are missing O and I.\n\n I think ""RATIO"" is a solid choice.\n\n However, note that the word ""RADIO"" is also good because it tests O and I.\n\n But let me check: the word ""RADIO"" is valid.\n\n Since we have two vowels already (A and we don\'t have any other vowels known), testing O and I is good.\n\n So, I\'ll go with ""RADIO"".\n\n But wait: what about the position of R? We know R is in the word but not in position 2. We are now putting R in position 1. \n If the secret word has R in position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or an x? \n\n Similarly, A in position 2: if it\'s correct, we get a check; if not, we get a minus or x? But we know A is in the word, so it won\'t be x.\n\n So, let\'s choose ""RADIO"".\n\n But note: we are using R and A again. That\'s okay because we are trying to find their correct positions.\n\n Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn\'t reuse R and A? But we have to include them because we know they are in the word. \n\n Actually, we must include them because we are trying to get more information about their positions.\n\n So, I\'ll go with ""RADIO"".\n\n However, let me think of a word that uses R and A and also includes T, O, I? But we can\'t have all three? \n\n How about ""TRAIL""? We can\'t because R must be included and we can\'t put R in position 2.\n\n Another: ""ARTIS"" -> not a word.\n\n I think ""RADIO"" is a good choice.\n\n But wait: what about ""RAINS""? \n   R(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), S(5) -> but N is absent! We cannot use N.\n\n So, we must avoid N.\n\n Therefore, ""RADIO"" is valid.\n\n Let me confirm: \n   R in position 1: we don\'t know if that\'s allowed? It is, because we only know R is not in position 2.\n   A in position 2: we don\'t have a restriction for A in position 2? Only that it is not in position 3.\n\n So, I\'ll go with ""RADIO"".\n\n But note: we are using D. We don\'t know about D. It might be common or not.\n\n Alternatively, we could use ""ROAST"" if we were allowed to put A in a new position? But we cannot put A in position 3.\n\n How about ""RALLY""? \n   R(1), A(2), L(3), L(4), Y(5) -> but we have two L\'s. And we don\'t know if the word has two L\'s. Also, we are not testing as many new letters.\n\n I think ""RADIO"" is better.\n\n Let me search for a word that has R, A, T, O, I? \n\n How about ""RATIO"" (which is the same as ""RADIO"" but rearranged). \n   R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5)\n\n This is a valid word and tests T, I, O.\n\n I think ""RATIO"" is slightly better because it has T and I (which are very common) and O.\n\n So, I\'ll go with ""RATIO"".\n\n But wait: in ""RATIO"", we are putting A in position 2 and R in position 1. \n\n We know that R is in the word but not in position 2. We are now testing R in position 1. \n If it\'s correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus.\n\n Similarly, A in position 2: we don\'t have a restriction for A in position 2, so we can test it.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""RATIO"".\n\n But note: we are using R and A again. That\'s okay.\n\n So, second guess: ""RATIO""\n\n<guess>ratio</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C, N, E** are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- **R** is present but not in position 2 (marked ""-"").\n- **A** is present but not in position 3 (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **R** and **A** (since they are confirmed present).\n- Avoid **C, N, E** (absent letters).\n- Test new common letters (e.g., **T, I, O**) to gather more information.\n- **R** cannot be in position 2, and **A** cannot be in position 3.\n\nThe word **""RATIO""** fits these criteria:\n- **R** is in position 1 (new position, not 2).\n- **A** is in position 2 (new position, not 3).\n- Introduces **T, I, O** (common letters not yet tested).\n- Valid 5-letter word, avoiding forbidden letters.\n\nThis guess efficiently tests new positions for known letters and explores additional common letters.\n\n<guess>ratio</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (absent)\n- R: - (present, but not in position 2)\n- A: - (present, but not in position 3)\n- N: x (absent)\n- E: x (absent)\n\nGuess 2: ""ratio""\n- R: - (present, but not in position 1)  [since we got \'-\' for R in position 1]\n- A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)      [we got \'✓\' for A in position 2]\n- T: x (absent)\n- I: x (absent)\n- O: x (absent)\n\nSo, from this, we know:\n\n1. The secret word has the letter \'A\' in position 2. (because we got a check for A in position 2 in ""ratio"")\n2. The letter \'R\' is present, but not in position 1 (from ""ratio"") and not in position 2 (from ""crane""). So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.\n3. The following letters are absent: C, N, E, T, I, O.\n\nAlso, from ""crane"", we know that A is not in position 3 (but now we know it\'s in position 2, so that\'s consistent).\n\nNow, the secret word has the form: _ A _ _ _\n\nAnd the letters we know are present: R (in position 3,4, or 5) and (we don\'t know about duplicates, but so far no duplicates).\n\nWe also know the absent letters: C, N, E, T, I, O.\n\nWe need to make a third guess that:\n- Has \'A\' in position 2 (fixed)\n- Includes \'R\' in one of the positions 3,4,5 (but not 1 or 2)\n- Avoids the absent letters: C, N, E, T, I, O\n- We can use other common letters to test.\n\nSince we know A is in position 2, we can fix that.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have the form: _ A _ _ _ and contain the letter R in position 3,4, or 5.\n\nWe also want to test other common letters that we haven\'t tried yet. The remaining common letters include: S, L, U, D, M, P, B, G, etc.\n\nLet\'s try to form a word:\n\nOption 1: R in position 3: _ A R _ _\nWe need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth positions with letters that are not in the absent list and form a valid word.\n\nPossible letters: We can use B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nExample: ""BARMY"" -> B(1), A(2), R(3), M(4), Y(5). But we don\'t know about B, M, Y.\n\nBut we need to test more letters. However, we must include R in position 3.\n\nAnother: ""PARKS"": P(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5). This tests P, K, S.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""PARKS"" uses P, A, R, K, S. None of these are in the absent list (C,N,E,T,I,O). So it\'s valid.\n\nOption 2: R in position 4: _ A _ R _\nExample: ""FAIRY"" -> but we have I and Y? I is absent, so invalid. \n""HAIRY"" -> same issue, I is absent.\n""LAIRD"": L(1), A(2), I(3) -> I is absent, invalid.\n""MARRY"": M(1), A(2), R(3) -> wait, R is in position 3, not 4. \nWe need R in position 4: so _ A _ R _\n\nAnother: ""BASER"" -> but E is absent, invalid.\n""PAPER"" -> E absent, invalid.\n""SAVOR"" -> S(1), A(2), V(3), O(4), R(5) -> but O is absent and R is in position 5, not 4. \nWe need R in position 4: so the word must have R in the fourth position.\n\nHow about ""LAPSE"": but E and S? E is absent, so invalid.\n""MAPLE"": E absent, invalid.\n\nIt\'s hard to find a word with R in position 4 without using absent letters. \n\nOption 3: R in position 5: _ A _ _ R\nExample: ""BAKER"": E absent, invalid.\n""MAKER"": E absent, invalid.\n""FILER"": I and E absent, invalid.\n""HALMR"": not a word.\n\nThis is difficult. So maybe R in position 3 or 4 is easier.\n\nLet me try R in position 3: _ A R _ _\n\nWe need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth positions.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""BARMY"": B(1), A(2), R(3), M(4), Y(5) -> tests B, M, Y\n- ""CARDS"": but C is absent, invalid.\n- ""PARKS"": P(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5) -> tests P, K, S\n- ""MARKS"": M(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5) -> tests M, K, S\n- ""BARKS"": B(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5) -> tests B, K, S\n\nAll these are valid and use only allowed letters.\n\nWe also have the option to test more vowels? But we know the word has A, and we don\'t have any other vowels known (since E,I,O are absent, and we have A). So we might test U? But we don\'t know if U is in the word.\n\nBut note: we have only 6 tries, so we need to be efficient.\n\nWe can also consider words that don\'t have R in position 3? But we know R must be in 3,4, or 5. Since position 4 and 5 are harder, let\'s stick with position 3.\n\nNow, which one to choose? We want to test common letters and maximize information.\n\nWe haven\'t tested: S, L, D, U, P, M, B, G, etc.\n\n""PARKS"" tests P, K, S.\n""BARKS"" tests B, K, S.\n""MARKS"" tests M, K, S.\n\nThe letter S is common, so testing S is good. K is less common, but we have to use it because we are trying to place R.\n\nBut note: we are not sure if the word has S or not. We are testing it.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that uses a different set of letters to cover more ground.\n\nBut we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t have any indication of duplicates so far.\n\nAnother idea: we know the word has R and A. We have A fixed at position 2. So the word is ?A??\n\nWe can try to use a word that has R in position 4 or 5, but we had trouble finding valid words without absent letters.\n\nLet me try R in position 4 again: \n- _ A _ R _\nWe need a word: \n  First letter: not C,N,E,T,I,O -> so we can use B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n  Fourth letter: R\n  Fifth letter: not absent.\n\nExample: ""BALMY"": B(1), A(2), L(3), M(4), Y(5) -> but this doesn\'t have R? We need R in position 4. \n""BALMY"" has M in position 4, not R.\n\nHow about ""SALAD"": but two A\'s? And D. But we have A in position 2 and then again? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are avoiding E? ""SALAD"" has two A\'s and D. But we don\'t know about duplicates. Also, we have to avoid E? It doesn\'t have E, but it has A twice and D. \n\nBut we are not sure if the word has two A\'s. We know at least one A is in position 2. It might have another A? But we don\'t know.\n\nWe can try, but let\'s avoid duplicates for now to get more information.\n\nAnother word: ""PALER"": but E is absent, invalid.\n""MANOR"": M(1), A(2), N(3) -> N is absent! Invalid.\n""FAVOR"": F(1), A(2), V(3), O(4), R(5) -> but O is absent and R is in position 5, not 4. \nWe need R in position 4: so the fourth letter must be R.\n\nHow about ""LAPSE"": but E is absent.\n\nThis is difficult. So maybe R in position 5 is easier?\n\nBut we already have a candidate for R in position 5: ""BAKER"" is invalid because of E. \n\n""MAKER"": same.\n\n""FILER"": invalid.\n\n""HALMR"": not a word.\n\nSo perhaps R is more likely in position 3? \n\nLet me think of common words: \n- ""PARIS"": but we have I? I is absent, and also we have I in position 4? But I is absent, so invalid.\n- ""BARON"": O is absent, invalid.\n\nAnother: ""CARDS"": C absent, invalid.\n\nSo, let\'s stick with R in position 3.\n\nNow, among the candidates: ""BARKS"", ""PARKS"", ""MARKS"", ""BARMY"", etc.\n\nWe want to test letters that are more common. S is very common, so we can test a word that includes S.\n\nWe also have L, which is common.\n\nHow about ""BARKS"": B(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5). \nThis tests B, K, S.\n\nBut we have to consider that the word might have B, K, S.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""LARGE"": but E is absent and also G? But E is absent.\n\nHow about ""MARSH"": M(1), A(2), R(3), S(4), H(5). \nThis tests M, S, H.\n\nBut we don\'t know about H.\n\nAnother: ""PARKS"" is similar but with P instead of M.\n\nWe can also consider ""R"" in position 4? But we couldn\'t find a word. \n\nWhat about ""GAUZE"": but E and Z? E is absent, invalid.\n\nI think we have to choose from the words we have.\n\nBut note: we have another piece of information. In the first guess, we had R in position 2 (which was wrong) and in the second guess we had R in position 1 (which was wrong). Now we are trying R in position 3.\n\nWe also know that A is in position 2.\n\nSo, let\'s list the possibilities for the secret word:\n\nPosition 1: cannot be C,N,E,T,I,O,C,N,E,T,I,O -> so we can use B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.\nPosition 2: A (fixed)\nPosition 3: could be R? or another letter? But we know R is in the word and not in 1 or 2, so 3,4,5.\nPosition 4 and 5: similarly.\n\nWe need to test the position of R and also test new letters.\n\nWe have 3 positions to fill: 1, 3,4,5? Actually, position 2 is fixed as A, so we have positions 1,3,4,5 to fill with letters that include R (in 3,4,5) and two more letters? Because we have 5 letters: position1,2,3,4,5 -> we know 2 is A, so we need to test the other positions.\n\nWe know the word has R and A. So the other three positions must be filled with letters that are not in the absent list.\n\nWe are going to test multiple new letters.\n\nI think ""PARKS"" is a good choice: it tests P, K, S. K is less common, but S is very common.\n\nAlternatively, ""BARKS"" tests B, K, S.\n\nOr ""MARSH"" tests M, S, H.\n\nHow about ""LARGE""? But E is absent.\n\nAnother word: ""DARKY"": D(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), Y(5). \nThis tests D, K, Y.\n\nBut Y is less common.\n\nI think ""PARKS"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the word might have S. We haven\'t tested S yet.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""PARKS"".\n\nBut wait: we are putting R in position 3. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that doesn\'t have R in position 3? But we don\'t have many options.\n\nAnother candidate: ""FARCE"": but C and E absent, invalid.\n\nHow about ""HARPY"": H(1), A(2), R(3), P(4), Y(5). \nThis tests H, P, Y.\n\nBut we are missing S.\n\nI think ""PARKS"" is better than ""HARPY"" because S is more common.\n\nBut let me see: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""PARKS"" uses P, A, R, K, S. All are allowed.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""PARKS"".\n\nBut note: we are using K. If the word has K, we\'ll know. Similarly, P and S.\n\nWe might also consider ""BARMY"", but Y is less common.\n\nAnother word: ""GARDE"": but E is absent.\n\nI think ""PARKS"" is a valid choice.\n\nBut wait: what about the possibility that R is in position 4? We didn\'t find a word, but maybe there is one.\n\nHow about ""WASPY"": W(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5) -> but this doesn\'t have R? We must include R because we know it\'s in the word. So we have to include R.\n\nSo, we must have R in position 3,4, or 5.\n\nAnother word with R in position 4: \n- ""BAJRA""? Not common.\n- ""MAJAR"": not common.\n\nHow about ""SABER"": but E is absent.\n\nI think we have to go with R in position 3.\n\nSo, I choose ""PARKS"".\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that we are not repeating a position that we know is wrong for R? We are putting R in position 3. We don\'t have any feedback that position 3 is wrong for R? We only know that position 1 and 2 are wrong for R.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""PARKS"".\n\nBut wait: what about the letter K? We don\'t know about K. It might be common or not.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that uses L, which is very common. \n\nHow about ""LARGE"": but E is absent.\n\nHow about ""LARKS"": L(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5). \nThis tests L, K, S.\n\nOr ""WARKS"": not common.\n\nI think ""PARKS"" is acceptable.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""PARKS"" is P-A-R-K-S. \nP: not absent? We haven\'t tested P. \nK: not tested.\nS: not tested.\n\nSo, let\'s use ""PARKS"".\n\nBut wait: what about the possibility that the word has duplicate letters? We don\'t have any indication, so we can ignore for now.\n\nAnother candidate: ""BARGE"": but E is absent.\n\nI think we have to go with it.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the word might be ""PARIS"", but I is absent and also we have I in position 4? No, ""PARIS"" has I and O? O is absent.\n\nSo, let\'s finalizes: ""PARKS""\n\nBut wait, what about ""R"" in position 3? We are using R in position 3. If the secret word has R in position 3, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and then we know R must be in position 4 or 5.\n\nSo, let\'s do it.\n\nGuess: ""PARKS""\n\nBut note: we are putting R in position 3. We don\'t have any feedback that position 3 is wrong for R? Actually, we only know that position 1 and 2 are wrong for R. Position 3 might be correct.\n\nSo, we are testing position 3 for R.\n\nIf we get a check for R, then we know R is in position 3. If we get a minus, then R is in position 4 or 5.\n\nSimilarly, we test P, K, S.\n\nSo, it\'s a good test.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""PARKS"".\n\nBut let me check if there\'s a word that tests more common letters. \n\nAnother idea: ""SARIS"": S(1), A(2), R(3), I(4) -> I is absent, invalid.\n\n""SAVOR"": O absent.\n\nI think ""PARKS"" is fine.\n\nSo, the guess is ""PARKS"".\n\nBut note: we are using K. If we don\'t want to use K, we could try ""BARKS"" (B instead of P). But P is more common than B? In wordle, P is common.\n\nActually, in wordle, S is the most common, then L, then ... then K, then P, etc.\n\nBut we are testing S at the end, which is common.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""PARKS"".\n\nBut wait: what about ""R"" in position 3? We are testing it.\n\nSo, let\'s output ""PARKS"".\n\nBut note: we have to make sure we don\'t use absent letters. ""PARKS"" has P, A, R, K, S. None of these are in the absent list (C,N,E,T,I,O).\n\nSo, it\'s valid.\n\nTherefore, the third guess is ""PARKS"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R and A are present but not in positions 2 or 3, respectively. C, N, E are absent.\n- **Guess 2 (""ratio"")**: A is correct in position 2 (✓). R is present but not in position 1 (-). T, I, O are absent.\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **A is fixed in position 2** (from ""ratio"" feedback: ✓).\n2. **R is present** but cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from both guesses). It must be in position 3, 4, or 5.\n3. **Absent letters**: C, N, E, T, I, O (cannot be used).\n4. **Unknown positions**: 1, 3, 4, 5 need to be solved, with R one of them (in 3,4, or 5).\n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- **Must include R** in position 3, 4, or 5 (since positions 1 and 2 are invalid for R).\n- **A must be in position 2** (fixed).\n- **Avoid absent letters** (C, N, E, T, I, O).\n- Test new common letters (e.g., S, L, P, M) to gather more information.\n- Prioritize words with R in position 3 (as position 4/5 is harder to form valid words without absent letters).\n\nThe word **""PARKS""** fits perfectly:\n- **P** (new letter, tests position 1)\n- **A** (fixed in position 2)\n- **R** (placed in position 3 to test if it\'s correct)\n- **K** (new letter, tests position 4)\n- **S** (new letter, tests position 5)\n\nThis guess:\n- Tests R in position 3 (if correct, we get ✓; if not, we learn R is in 4/5).\n- Tests three new common letters (P, K, S).\n- Avoids all absent letters.\n\n<guess>parks</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(x)\nGuess 3: parks -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) K(x) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: absent (x)\n- R: present, wrong position (-)\n- A: present, wrong position (-)\n- N: absent (x)\n- E: absent (x)\n\nGuess 2: ""ratio""\n- R: present, wrong position (-)  [now we know R is not in position 1 or 2]\n- A: correct (✓) in position 2\n- T: absent (x)\n- I: absent (x)\n- O: absent (x)\n\nGuess 3: ""parks""\n- P: absent (x)\n- A: correct (✓) in position 2\n- R: correct (✓) in position 3\n- K: absent (x)\n- S: absent (x)\n\nNow, let\'s consolidate what we know:\n\n1. The secret word has:\n   - A in position 2 (from guess 2 and 3)\n   - R in position 3 (from guess 3: R is correct in position 3)\n\n2. So the word so far is: _ A R _ _\n\n3. We know the following letters are absent: C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S.\n\n4. We also know that R is in position 3, so we don\'t need to test R again.\n\n5. We know A is in position 2, so we don\'t need to test A.\n\n6. We need to find the letters for positions 1, 4, and 5.\n\n7. The word must contain only letters that are not in the absent list. The absent letters are: C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S.\n\n8. The remaining letters that are possible: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, V, W, Y, and possibly others.\n\nNow, we need to form a word that fits: _ A R _ _\n\nWe have to fill positions 1, 4, and 5 with letters from the remaining set, avoiding the absent letters.\n\nLet\'s think of common words that fit the pattern:\n\n- Position 1: a consonant or vowel? We can try common letters.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""BARGE"": but E is absent -> invalid.\n- ""BARRE"": has E and two R\'s? E absent, and also we have R in position 3, but position 2 is A, so ""BARRE"" would be B,A,R,R,E -> but E is absent and also we have two R\'s? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. However, E is absent so invalid.\n\nWe must avoid E.\n\n- ""MARRY"": M,A,R,R,Y -> but we have two R\'s? And Y. But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are using R again? But we know R is in position 3, so if we put R in position 4, that would be a duplicate? But we don\'t know if the word has two R\'s.\n\nBut note: we have only one R so far in the feedback? Actually, we don\'t know. The feedback doesn\'t show duplicates. But we can try.\n\nHowever, we are trying to get information. Using a word with duplicate R might not be efficient because if we get a check for one R, we don\'t know about the other.\n\nBut we are forced to use the pattern _ A R _ _\n\nWe need to test letters for positions 1,4,5.\n\nWe can try to use a word that has new letters and avoids duplicates for now.\n\nLet me list possible words:\n\n- ""BARMY"": B(1), A(2), R(3), M(4), Y(5) -> tests B, M, Y. But we don\'t know about duplicates? And we are using M and Y.\n\nBut we don\'t have any duplicate in this word.\n\n- ""HARPY"": but H(1), A(2), R(3), P(4), Y(5) -> but P is absent (from guess 3: P is absent). So invalid.\n\n- ""LARDY"": L(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5) -> tests L, D, Y. L, D, Y are not in the absent list.\n\nThis seems valid.\n\n- ""MARRY"": M(1), A(2), R(3), R(4), Y(5) -> but this has two R\'s. We know R is in position 3, so if we put R in position 4, we are testing for a duplicate. But we don\'t know if the word has two R\'s. Also, we are using R again, which we already know is in the word. It might be better to test new letters.\n\nWe want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nAnother word: ""WARTY"": W(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), Y(5) -> but T is absent (from guess 2: T is absent). So invalid.\n\n""CARDS"": C absent.\n\n""BARDS"": C absent.\n\n""FARGO"": F(1), A(2), R(3), G(4), O(5) -> O is absent, invalid.\n\n""MARSH"": S absent? S is absent from guess 3. So invalid.\n\n""LARVA"": L(1), A(2), R(3), V(4), A(5) -> but we have two A\'s? And we don\'t know about duplicates. Also, A is already in position 2, so if we put A in position 5, we are testing for a duplicate. But we know A is in position 2, so if we get a check for A in position 5, that would be a duplicate. But we don\'t know if there is a duplicate.\n\nHowever, we are trying to get information. Using a word with duplicate might not be efficient.\n\nBut we have to fill the positions.\n\nAnother word: ""DARBY"": D(1), A(2), R(3), B(4), Y(5). \nThis tests D, B, Y.\n\nBut we don\'t know about duplicates? And we are not using any duplicate.\n\n""DARBY"" is a word? It means a type of hawk, I think.\n\nBut let\'s see: we have to avoid absent letters. D, B, Y are not absent? \nAbsent letters: C,N,E,T,I,O,P,K,S. So D, B, Y are allowed.\n\nBut we have to test new letters.\n\nWe can also consider ""HARDY"": H(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5). \nThis tests H, D, Y.\n\nBut we don\'t know about duplicates.\n\nAlternatively, ""LARDY"" as I thought earlier: L(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5). \nThis tests L, D, Y.\n\n""LARDY"" is a valid word (meaning fat or oily).\n\nAnother: ""MARDY"": M(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5). \nSimilarly, tests M, D, Y.\n\nBut we don\'t know about duplicates.\n\nWe can also try to use a word that has a vowel in position 4 or 5? We have only position 1,4,5 to fill. We know the word has at least A and R, and we have three positions to fill.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has more vowels? We have A already, and we know E,I,O are absent. So the only vowel left is U? And sometimes Y.\n\nSo, the word might have U or Y as a vowel? But in position 4 or 5.\n\nFor example, ""BARUM"": but U? And M. But ""BARUM"" is not common.\n\n""WARNS"": but W(1), A(2), R(3), N(4), S(5) -> N and S are absent, invalid.\n\n""CARDS"": C absent.\n\nI think we have to accept that we might have to test with duplicates or use Y.\n\nBut let me think of words without duplicates:\n\n- ""BALMY"": but L and M? But ""BALMY"" is B,A,L,M,Y. But we need R in position 3? This is B,A,L,M,Y -> no R. So invalid.\n\nWe must have R in position 3.\n\nSo, the pattern is fixed: _ A R _ _\n\nWe need to fill the blanks with letters not in {C,N,E,T,I,O,P,K,S} and not R or A (but we can use other letters, but we don\'t have to avoid R and A in the blanks? Actually, we can use them if we suspect duplicates, but we have no evidence of duplicates so far. So we should avoid using R and A in the blanks to test new letters.\n\nSo, positions 1,4,5 must be filled with letters that are not in the absent list and not R or A? Not necessarily, but if we use R or A in these positions, we might get a duplicate, but we don\'t know if the word has a duplicate. So to test efficiently, we should use new letters.\n\nBut we have to form a valid word.\n\nSo, let\'s look for words that start with a consonant (or vowel) and then R, then two more letters.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""DARBY"" (if accepted): D, A, R, B, Y -> tests D, B, Y.\n- ""HARDY"": H, A, R, D, Y -> tests H, D, Y.\n- ""LARDY"": L, A, R, D, Y -> tests L, D, Y.\n- ""MARDY"": M, A, R, D, Y -> tests M, D, Y.\n- ""WARLY"": W, A, R, L, Y -> tests W, L, Y.\n- ""BARNY"": B, A, R, N, Y -> but N is absent, invalid.\n- ""JARUL"": not a word.\n\nWe can also try ""FARCE"", but C and E absent.\n\nHow about ""HAREM"": but E is absent and M? ""HAREM"" has E, invalid.\n\n""BARRE"": has E, invalid.\n\n""CARME"": C absent.\n\nI think ""LARDY"" is a good candidate: it tests L, D, Y.\n\nBut we have to consider that the word might have duplicate R? We know R is in position 3, but if we put R in position 4? We are not doing that in this word.\n\nIn ""LARDY"", we have no duplicate.\n\nSimilarly, ""HARDY"" has no duplicate.\n\nBut we are testing the same letters: for position 1, we test H, M, B, W, etc.\n\nWe need to choose one.\n\nBut note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on the fourth guess. We can try to cover more common letters.\n\nThe most common letters left: L, D, Y, M, H, W, etc.\n\n""LARDY"" tests L, D, Y.\n\n""HARDY"" tests H, D, Y.\n\n""MARDY"" tests M, D, Y.\n\nI think ""LARDY"" is a good choice because L is a very common letter.\n\nBut we have to make sure that we are not missing something.\n\nAnother word: ""BARNY"": invalid because of N.\n\n""JARUL"" not a word.\n\n""VARNA"": but N absent.\n\n""GAUZE"": E absent.\n\nI think we have to go with one of these.\n\nBut wait: what about ""DARBS""? Not a word.\n\nOr ""LARVA"": but V and A again? And duplicate A? But we don\'t know. And ""LARVA"" has V and A, but we are not testing duplicates? Actually, we are testing L, A, V, R, A? Wait, ""LARVA"" is L,A,R,V,A -> so positions: L(1), A(2), R(3), V(4), A(5). \nThis has duplicate A. But we know A is in position 2, so if we put A in position 5, we are testing for a duplicate. But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s.\n\nHowever, we are on the fourth guess, and we have to test. But using a duplicate might not give us new information if there is only one A.\n\nBut we don\'t know. So it\'s risky.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t have A in position 5? But we don\'t know.\n\nGiven the constraints, I think ""LARDY"" is a safe choice.\n\nBut let me check if there is a word that tests more common letters.\n\nHow about ""HARDY"" or ""LARDY"".\n\nI think both are good. Let\'s choose ""HARDY"" because H is a common letter.\n\nBut we have to avoid the absent letters. ""HARDY"" uses H, A, R, D, Y. \n- H: not tested\n- D: not tested\n- Y: not tested\n\nAnd it fits the pattern.\n\nSimilarly, ""LARDY"" uses L, A, R, D, Y.\n\nNow, which one? H vs L.\n\nH is more common than L? In English, H is more common than L? Actually, L is more common.\n\nBut we are testing two letters: one in position 1 and one in position 4 and 5.\n\nWe can also consider ""WARTY"": but T is absent.\n\n""BARFY"": not common.\n\nI think both are valid. Let\'s pick ""HARDY"".\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that we are not using absent letters. ""HARDY"" is H,A,R,D,Y. \n- H: not absent? No, H has not been tested.\n- D: not absent.\n- Y: not absent.\n\nSo, it\'s valid.\n\nSimilarly, ""LARDY"" is L,A,R,D,Y.\n\nI\'ll go with ""HARDY"" to test H.\n\nBut wait: we have to consider that the word might be ""HARDY"" itself? But we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that uses U? But we don\'t have a word that fits and has U.\n\nFor example, ""GUARD"": but U,A,R,D -> but A is in position 2? ""GUARD"" is G,U,A,R,D -> positions: G(1), U(2) -> but we need A in position 2? No, in ""GUARD"", A is in position 3? \nG(1), U(2), A(3) -> but we need A in position 2. So invalid.\n\nWe must have A in position 2 and R in position 3.\n\nSo, the word must be: [letter] A R [letter] [letter]\n\nWe have to choose from the available letters.\n\nI think ""HARDY"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me see if there is a word with U. \n\n""RARER"": but E is absent and R duplicate? Also, E absent.\n\n""PARER"": E absent.\n\nI don\'t think there is a common word with U that fits.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""HARDY"".\n\nBut wait: what about ""BARMY""? B(1), A(2), R(3), M(4), Y(5). \nThis tests B, M, Y.\n\nH is more common than B? In English, H is more frequent.\n\nBut we are testing H in position 1.\n\nSimilarly, ""HARDY"" tests H in position 1, D in position 4, Y in position 5.\n\nWe can also consider ""MARSH"": but S is absent.\n\nAnother: ""DARKY"": D(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), Y(5) -> but K is absent (from guess 3). So invalid.\n\n""HAIRY"": H(1), A(2), I(3) -> I is absent, invalid.\n\nSo, ""HARDY"" seems good.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""HARDY"" is H,A,R,D,Y. \n- H: allowed\n- D: allowed\n- Y: allowed\n\nSo, it\'s valid.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""HARDY"".\n\nBut wait: what if the word is ""HARDY""? Then we get it right.\n\nBut we are guessing, so it might be.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that tests more vowels? But we only have position 4 and 5 to test, and the word must have a vowel? We have A already, and we know E,I,O are absent. So the only vowel left is U or Y. Position 4 and 5 could be U or Y.\n\nFor example, ""HARDY"" has Y, which is a vowel-like letter.\n\nBut we don\'t know if Y is in the word.\n\nAnother word: ""WARNS"": invalid because of N and S.\n\n""BARNS"": N and S absent.\n\nI think ""HARDY"" is a good guess.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""HARDY"".\n\nBut note: we are using D and Y. We haven\'t tested D or Y.\n\nWe could test L and D? But we can\'t test both in one word without using a duplicate or missing position.\n\nWe have to choose one.\n\nAnother candidate: ""BARDY"" - not a common word.\n\nI think ""HARDY"" is acceptable.\n\nSo, fourth guess: ""HARDY""\n\nBut wait: what about ""LARGE""? E absent.\n\nI think we have to make this guess.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the word might be ""LARGE"", but E is absent.\n\nSo, let\'s finalize: ""HARDY""\n\nBut wait, what about ""DARKY""? Invalid because of K and T absent? K and T are absent.\n\nNo.\n\nSo, I think ""HARDY"" is a good choice.\n\nTherefore, the guess is ""HARDY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **A is confirmed in position 2** (from ""ratio"" and ""parks"" feedback: ✓).\n- **R is confirmed in position 3** (from ""parks"" feedback: ✓).\n- **Absent letters**: C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).\n- **Present letters**: A (position 2), R (position 3), and one more letter (since the word is 5 letters).\n\n### Current Knowledge:\n- Secret word pattern: `[position1] A R [position4] [position5]`\n- Position 1, 4, and 5 must be filled with letters not in the absent list.\n- Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, V, W, Y, etc. (since C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S are absent).\n- We need to test new common letters to identify the missing letters.\n\n### Strategy for Guess 4:\n- **Focus on positions 1, 4, and 5**.\n- Test high-frequency remaining letters (e.g., D, L, M, H, Y) to maximize information.\n- Avoid reusing absent letters and avoid reusing R and A in positions 1, 4, or 5 (since we already know R is in position 3 and A is in position 2).\n- Prioritize words that test three new letters in one guess to narrow down possibilities.\n\nThe word **""HARDY""** fits perfectly:\n- **H** (new, tests position 1)\n- **A** (fixed in position 2)\n- **R** (fixed in position 3)\n- **D** (new, tests position 4)\n- **Y** (new, tests position 5)\n\nThis guess:\n- Tests H, D, and Y (common letters).\n- Avoids all absent letters.\n- If incorrect, the feedback will reveal which of H, D, or Y (if any) are present and in the right positions.\n\n<guess>hardy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(x)\nGuess 3: parks -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) K(x) S(x)\nGuess 4: hardy -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(x) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from four guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: absent\n- R: present, wrong position (not 2)\n- A: present, wrong position (not 3)\n- N: absent\n- E: absent\n\nGuess 2: ""ratio""\n- R: present, wrong position (not 1)\n- A: correct in position 2\n- T: absent\n- I: absent\n- O: absent\n\nGuess 3: ""parks""\n- P: absent\n- A: correct in position 2\n- R: correct in position 3\n- K: absent\n- S: absent\n\nGuess 4: ""hardy""\n- H: absent\n- A: correct in position 2\n- R: correct in position 3\n- D: absent\n- Y: correct in position 5? Wait, the feedback for ""hardy"" is: H(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(x) Y(✓)\n\nBut the feedback says:\n- H: absent (x)\n- A: correct (✓) in position 2\n- R: correct (✓) in position 3\n- D: absent (x)\n- Y: correct (✓) in position 5\n\nSo, from this:\n- Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).\n- A is in position 2 (already known).\n- R is in position 3 (already known).\n- H and D are absent.\n\nTherefore, the secret word has:\n- Position 2: A\n- Position 3: R\n- Position 5: Y\n- And we know from previous that R is also in position 3 (now confirmed), and A in position 2 (confirmed), and Y in position 5 (confirmed).\n\nSo the word is: _ A R _ Y\n\nWe are missing positions 1 and 4.\n\nAlso, we know the absent letters: C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S, H, D.\n\nSo the absent letters are: C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S, H, D.\n\nWe need to find a word that fits: [letter1] A R [letter4] Y\n\nLetter1 and letter4 must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the absent letters.\n\nRemaining possible letters: B, F, G, L, M, U, V, W, X, Z, and possibly others, but we\'ll focus on common ones.\n\nWe know the word must have Y at the end, and we have A and R in the middle.\n\nNow, what words fit this pattern?\n\nCommon words: \n- ""BARMY"": but M? And we have to check if M is allowed. M is not in the absent list. But ""BARMY"" is B,A,R,M,Y. \n  - Position 1: B\n  - Position 2: A\n  - Position 3: R\n  - Position 4: M\n  - Position 5: Y\n\nBut we haven\'t tested B and M.\n\n- ""LARDY"": but D is absent, so invalid. We know D is absent from guess 4.\n\n- ""MARVY"": M,A,R,V,Y -> tests M and V. ""MARVY"" is a word (meaning very good or excellent).\n\n- ""WARZY"": not a word.\n\n- ""CARVY"": not a word and C absent.\n\n- ""FARCY"": not a word and C absent.\n\n- ""JARLY"": not a word.\n\n- ""BARNY"": but N absent.\n\n- ""LARZY"": not a word.\n\n- ""BARFY"": not common.\n\n- ""LARZY"": not a word.\n\n- ""MARRY"": but we have Y at the end? ""MARRY"" is M,A,R,R,Y -> but this has two R\'s? And in position 4, we have R. But we know R is in position 3, so if we put R in position 4, that would be a duplicate? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed.\n\nHowever, in the feedback for ""hardy"", we have Y as correct in position 5, so the word ends with Y. And we have A and R in positions 2 and 3.\n\nSo, ""MARRY"" would be M,A,R,R,Y -> but then position 4 is R, which is duplicate. But we don\'t know if the word has two R\'s.\n\nBut we have to consider the possibility.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback: in ""hardy"", we had D absent, so D is not in the word. And H absent.\n\nBut we know the word has Y at the end, so it must be ""MARRY"" if we consider duplicate R.\n\nBut we have to test.\n\nAnother word: ""BARMY"" as above.\n\nAlso, ""MARVY"": M,A,R,V,Y.\n\nAnd ""RALLY"": but L and L? And we have Y at the end? ""RALLY"" is R,A,L,L,Y -> but R is in position 1? We need R in position 3. So not.\n\nThe pattern is fixed: position 3 is R, position 5 is Y.\n\nSo, we need words of the form: ? A R ? Y\n\nNow, what about ""BARFY""? Not common.\n\n""CARVY"": not a word.\n\n""JARUL"": not a word.\n\n""VARAY"": not a word.\n\n""KARZY"": not a word and K absent.\n\nSo, common words: \n- ""BARMY"": B,A,R,M,Y\n- ""MARVY"": M,A,R,V,Y\n- ""WARZY"": not a word.\n\nAlso, ""LARZY"": not a word.\n\nWhat about ""FARCY""? Not a word.\n\nI think ""BARMY"" and ""MARVY"" are candidates.\n\nBut we also have ""JAZZY"": but that has Z and Z, and A in position 2? J,A,Z,Z,Y -> position 3 is Z, not R. So invalid.\n\nWe need position 3 to be R.\n\nSo, only a few options.\n\nAnother: ""PARZY"": not a word.\n\n""RABBY"": not a word.\n\nSo, we have ""BARMY"" and ""MARVY"".\n\nBut we need to choose one.\n\nWe can also consider ""HARPY"": but H is absent, so invalid.\n\n""LARVA"": but V? And A in position 2, but position 3 is R? ""LARVA"" is L,A,R,V,A -> but this has A in position 5? And we have A in position 2, so if we put A in position 5, that would be a duplicate? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut in the pattern, we have position 5 as Y, so it cannot be A. So ""LARVA"" would have A in position 5, which conflicts because we know position 5 is Y.\n\nSo, we cannot have A in position 5. Therefore, ""LARVA"" is invalid because it would require A in position 5, but we know position 5 is Y.\n\nSimilarly, any word with A in position 5 is invalid because we know A is in position 2 and we have no evidence of a duplicate A? But we don\'t know for sure.\n\nBut from the feedback, in guess 1, A was present but not in position 3, and in guess 2, A was correct in position 2, so if there were a duplicate A, we might have seen it? Not necessarily, because we only tested A in position 3 in guess 1 and in position 2 in guess 2. We haven\'t tested A in other positions.\n\nBut in guess 4, we tested A only in position 2 (which is correct) and not elsewhere.\n\nSo, it\'s possible that there is a duplicate A? But we don\'t have evidence.\n\nHowever, in the pattern, we have position 5 as Y, so if we put A in position 4, that would be a duplicate? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut let\'s look at the candidates:\n\n- ""BARMY"": B,A,R,M,Y -> no duplicate A.\n- ""MARVY"": M,A,R,V,Y -> no duplicate A.\n- ""LARVA"": L,A,R,V,A -> has duplicate A. But position 5 is Y, so if we put A in position 5, it conflicts. Also, in ""LARVA"", position 5 is A, but we know it must be Y. So invalid.\n\nTherefore, we cannot have a word with A in position 5. So any word with A in position 4 would be even better? But we don\'t have many options.\n\nAnother word: ""BARFY"" is not common.\n\n""CARVY"": not a word.\n\n""JARUL"": not a word.\n\nSo, we are left with ""BARMY"" and ""MARVY"".\n\nWe also have ""WARZY"", but not common.\n\n""RABBY"": not a word.\n\nI think ""BARMY"" and ""MARVY"" are the main candidates.\n\nNow, we need to choose one.\n\nWe can also consider ""FARCY"", but C absent.\n\nAnother: ""HARZY"": H absent.\n\nSo, let\'s list:\n\n- ""BARMY"": B, A, R, M, Y\n- ""MARVY"": M, A, R, V, Y\n\nWe haven\'t tested B, M, V.\n\nWe can choose one.\n\nBut note: we are on the fifth guess, and we have two possibilities. We can pick one.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that tests more letters? But we only have two positions to fill: position 1 and position 4.\n\nWe have to guess a word that fits the pattern.\n\nWe can try ""BARMY"" to test B and M.\n\nIf it\'s not, then we try ""MARVY"" next.\n\nBut we have only two guesses left (since we are on guess 5, and we get 6 tries, so two more after this? No, we are making the fifth guess now, and we have one more after if needed).\n\nBut we can solve it.\n\nAnother word: ""LARZY"" not a word.\n\n""VARZY"": not a word.\n\n""ZARFY"": not a word.\n\nI think ""BARMY"" and ""MARVY"" are the only common words.\n\nBut let me check: is ""MARVY"" a word? Yes, meaning excellent.\n\n""BARMY"" is also a word, meaning crazy.\n\nBut we can also consider ""JAZZY"": but position 3 is Z, not R.\n\nNo.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""BARMY"" to test B and M.\n\nBut we have to make a guess.\n\nAlternatively, we can think: is there a word that uses more common letters? B and M are both common.\n\nBut we have to choose.\n\nAnother idea: we know the word has Y at the end, and we have A and R in the middle. We can try ""BARMY"".\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""BARMY"" uses B, A, R, M, Y. \n- B: not tested\n- M: not tested\n\nAnd it fits the pattern.\n\nSimilarly, ""MARVY"" uses M, A, R, V, Y.\n\nV is less common than M? In letters, M is more common than V.\n\nBut we are testing M in both.\n\nWe can also consider ""WARZY"", but not common.\n\nI think ""BARMY"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me see: if we guess ""BARMY"" and it\'s wrong, we get feedback on B and M.\n\nSimilarly for ""MARVY"".\n\nBut we have two possibilities, so we can pick one.\n\nSince we are on the fifth guess, and we have two options, we can try ""BARMY"".\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that we are not missing the word ""MARVY"".\n\nWe don\'t know.\n\nBut let\'s look at the frequency: M is more common than B? In English, M is more common than B.\n\nBut we are testing both.\n\nWe can also consider ""FARMY"": F,A,R,M,Y -> F is not tested. ""FARMY"" is a word? It might be, but less common.\n\nI think ""BARMY"" is more common.\n\nBut let me check the dictionary: ""barmy"" is valid, ""marvy"" is valid.\n\nBoth are acceptable.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t use M or B? But we have to fill the pattern.\n\nWe can try ""LARVA"", but that has A in position 4? ""LARVA"" is L,A,R,V,A -> positions: L(1), A(2), R(3), V(4), A(5). \nBut position 5 must be Y, not A. So invalid.\n\nWe cannot have A in position 5.\n\nSo, back to ""BARMY"" and ""MARVY"".\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""BARMY"" to test B.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""BARMY"" uses B, A, R, M, Y. \n- B: not absent\n- M: not absent\n- Y: we know is present and in position 5.\n\nSo, it\'s valid.\n\nBut wait: what if the word is ""MARVY""? Then we miss.\n\nBut we have to guess.\n\nWe can also consider ""WARTY"", but T is absent.\n\nNo.\n\nSo, I think ""BARMY"" is a good guess.\n\nBut let me see if there is a word that uses L or F or others.\n\n""BARFY"": not common.\n\n""CARVY"": not a word.\n\nI think we have to choose between ""BARMY"" and ""MARVY"".\n\nLet me pick ""MARVY"" because M is more common than B.\n\nBut in terms of frequency, M is more common than V? Actually, in English, V is less common than M? \n\nAccording to letter frequency, M is more common than V.\n\nBut we are testing both.\n\nWe can also consider ""FARMY"": F,A,R,M,Y -> F is not tested. ""FARMY"" is a word? It might be, but less common.\n\n""FARMY"" is not standard.\n\n""WARMY"": not a word.\n\nSo, I think ""MARVY"" is a better choice because M is more common.\n\nBut let me check: ""MARVY"" is a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, ""BARMY"" is also valid.\n\nBut we have to make a decision.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to use a word that tests F? But we don\'t have a word with F in position 1 or 4.\n\nFor example, ""FARCY"" invalid.\n\n""PARVY"": not a word.\n\nSo, I think we have to choose between ""BARMY"" and ""MARVY"".\n\nI\'ll go with ""MARVY"" because it tests M (more common) and V (less common, so if it\'s not, we know V is absent and then it must be ""BARMY"").\n\nBut we have two guesses left, so we can afford to be wrong once.\n\nBut we are on the fifth guess, and we have one more after if needed.\n\nSo, let\'s choose ""MARVY"".\n\nBut note: we have to write the guess.\n\nAlternatively, we can think: is there a word that uses L? For example, ""LARVA"" but that doesn\'t end with Y.\n\nWe need to end with Y.\n\n""LARVA"" doesn\'t end with Y.\n\n""CARVY"": not a word.\n\nI think ""MARVY"" is the better choice.\n\nBut let me see: ""MARVY"" means excellent, and it\'s a valid word.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""MARVY"".\n\nBut wait: what about ""BARMY""? It means crazy, also valid.\n\nBut ""MARVY"" is more sophisticated.\n\nWe can also consider ""FARMY"", but it\'s not standard.\n\nI think we have to go with ""MARVY"".\n\nSo, fifth guess: ""MARVY""\n\nBut note: we are putting M in position 1 and V in position 4.\n\nIf the word is ""MARVY"", we get it right.\n\nIf not, then we know it must be ""BARMY"" or another word.\n\nBut there is also ""WARTY"", but T is absent.\n\nAnother word: ""BARZY"": not a word.\n\nSo, I think ""MARVY"" is a good guess.\n\nTherefore, the guess is ""MARVY"".Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:\n\n- **A is confirmed in position 2** (from ""ratio"" and ""parks"" feedback: ✓).\n- **R is confirmed in position 3** (from ""parks"" and ""hardy"" feedback: ✓).\n- **Y is confirmed in position 5** (from ""hardy"" feedback: ✓).\n- **Absent letters**: C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S, H, D (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).\n- **Present letters**: A (position 2), R (position 3), Y (position 5), and one more letter (position 1 and 4) that is not in the absent list.\n\n### Current Knowledge:\n- Secret word pattern: `[position1] A R [position4] Y`\n- Position 1 and 4 must be filled with letters not in the absent list (available: B, F, G, L, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.).\n- We know the word must be a valid English word ending with ""ARY"" (specifically, ""A R _ Y""), but with the fourth letter being the key.\n\n### Strategy for Guess 5:\n- **Focus on positions 1 and 4**.\n- Test high-frequency available letters (e.g., M, L, F, B) to identify the missing letters.\n- Only two candidates remain: **""MARVY""** (M in position 1, V in position 4) and **""BARMY""** (B in position 1, M in position 4). \n- ""MARVY"" is chosen because M is more common than B in English, and V is a less common letter that, if absent, will confirm ""BARMY"" as the solution.\n\nIf ""MARVY"" is incorrect, we will know that position 1 must be B and position 4 must be M (resulting in ""BARMY""), as ""BARMY"" is the only other valid option.\n\n<guess>marvy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(x)\nGuess 3: parks -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) K(x) S(x)\nGuess 4: hardy -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(x) Y(✓)\nGuess 5: marvy -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(✓) R(✓) V(x) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from five guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent
- R: present, wrong position (not position 2)
- A: present, wrong position (not position 3)
- N: absent
- E: absent

Guess 2: ""ratio""
- R: present, wrong position (not position 1)
- A: correct in position 2
- T: absent
- I: absent
- O: absent

Guess 3: ""parks""
- P: absent
- A: correct in position 2
- R: correct in position 3
- K: absent
- S: absent

Guess 4: ""hardy""
- H: absent
- A: correct in position 2
- R: correct in position 3
- D: absent
- Y: correct in position 5

Guess 5: ""marvy""
- M: absent
- A: correct in position 2
- R: correct in position 3
- V: absent
- Y: correct in position 5

Now, consolidate the known information:

1. The secret word has:
   - Position 2: A
   - Position 3: R
   - Position 5: Y
   So the pattern is: _ A R _ Y

2. We know the following letters are absent: C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S, H, D, M (from the x's in the feedback).

3. We also know that R is in position 3 and A in position 2, and Y in position 5.

4. The only unknown positions are 1 and 4.

5. We need to find a 5-letter word of the form: [letter1] A R [letter4] Y

6. Letter1 and letter4 must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the absent letters.

Absent letters: C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S, H, D, M.

So available letters: B, F, G, L, U, W, X, Z, and possibly others, but we'll focus on common ones.

Now, what words fit this pattern?

We have to fill position 1 and 4 with letters not in the absent list.

Possible words:

- ""BARMY"": B in position 1, M in position 4. But M was tested in ""marvy"" and was absent? In guess 5, V was absent, but M was marked x, so M is absent. Therefore, ""BARMY"" would have M, which is now absent, so invalid.

- ""MARVY"": already guessed and V is absent, so invalid.

Other possibilities:

- ""LARVA"": but this is L,A,R,V,A -> but position 5 must be Y, not A. So invalid.

- ""BARFY"": not a common word, and F? But let's see.

Actually, the word must end with Y, so position 4 must be a letter that, when followed by Y, makes sense.

Common words:

- ""BARNY"": but N is absent, invalid.
- ""JARLY"": not a word.
- ""WARLY"": not a word.

But we have ""BARMY"" and ""MARVY"", but both are invalid now because M and V are absent.

What about ""FARMY""? Not a standard word.

Or ""LARZY""? Not a word.

Perhaps ""BARZY"" not a word.

I think we have to consider duplicates? But position 5 is Y, and we have A in position 2, so if we put A in position 4, it would be a duplicate. But we don't know if duplicate A is possible.

For example, ""BARAY"": not a word.

""CARVY"": not a word and C absent.

""JARUL"": not a word.

How about ""RALLY""? But that ends with Y? ""RALLY"" is R,A,L,L,Y -> but position 1 is R, but we know R is in position 3? Conflict. Also, position 3 is L, not R.

We need position 3 to be R.

So, the word must have R in position 3.

Another idea: ""PARZY"" not a word.

Perhaps ""LARVA"" is the only one that comes to mind, but it doesn't end with Y.

We need to end with Y.

What about ""BAYLY"": but position 3 is L, not R.

No.

""EARLY"": E absent and position 2 is A? ""EARLY"" is E,A,R,L,Y -> but E is absent, and position 2 is A, position 3 is R, position 5 is Y. But E is absent, so invalid.

""CARVY"": not a word.

I think we have to consider ""BARMY"" and ""MARVY"" are out. So what other words?

Let me think: ""FARGO"" doesn't fit.

Another: ""BARDO"": but O absent and position 4 is O? Not Y.

We need position 5 to be Y.

So, the pattern is fixed: ? A R ? Y

We need to find ? and ? with the constraints.

Possible words:

- ""BARMY"": B and M -> but M is absent now (from guess 5), so invalid.
- ""MARVY"": M and V -> both absent, so invalid.

But there is ""LARVA"", but it ends with A, not Y.

What about ""WARTY""? T absent.

""HAIRY"": H and I absent.

""FAIRY"": F and I absent, I is absent.

""BARFY"": not a word.

""CARVY"": not a word.

Perhaps ""LARZY"" is not a word.

I think we have a problem. Maybe we missed a word.

Another: ""BARNY"" is invalid.

But what about ""JAZZY""? J,A,Z,Z,Y -> position 3 is Z, not R.

No.

""RABBY"": not a word.

""RACZY"": not a word and C absent.

Perhaps ""FARMY"" is not standard, but let's see the dictionary.

In standard Wordle, words must be valid.

Another: ""VARDO"": but O absent and position 5 is O? Not Y.

""VIRGA"": but I and G? Position 2 is I? No, position 2 must be A.

So, I think we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters, but we don't have evidence.

Perhaps ""BARAY"" is not a word.

How about ""LARAY"": not a word.

I think we have to accept that ""BARMY"" and ""MARVY"" are the only common words, but they are invalid now.

But note: in guess 4, we had ""hardy"" which had Y correct in position 5, so the word ends with Y.

And we know A and R in positions 2 and 3.

So, the only possibilities are words like ""BARMY"", ""MARVY"", ""FARMY"" (if valid), etc.

But ""FARMY"" is not a standard word.

What about ""WARZY""? Not a word.

""BARZY"" not a word.

""CARZY"" not a word.

""JARZY"" not a word.

I think we have to consider that the word might be ""BARMY"" or ""MARVY"", but both are absent because M and V are absent.

But we haven't tested B, F, G, L, W, etc.

Perhaps we can try a word that uses one of these.

But we have to form a valid word.

Another idea: ""LARVA"" is not ending with Y, but if we try to adapt, we cannot because position 5 must be Y.

We must have position 5 as Y.

So, let's list all possible words that fit ? A R ? Y and use only available letters.

Available letters for position 1: B, F, G, L, W, etc.
Position 4: must be a letter that can form a word, and not in the absent list.

Possible words:

- ""BARMY"": B and M -> but M is absent, so invalid.
- ""MARVY"": M and V -> both absent, invalid.
- ""FARMY"": F and M -> M absent, invalid.
- ""LARVA"": L and V -> V absent? In guess 5, V was absent, so V is absent. So ""LARVA"" has V, which is absent, so invalid.
- ""BARFY"": B and F -> is ""BARFY"" a word? Not really, but ""BARFY"" is not standard. 
- ""WARFY"": not a word.
- ""CARVY"": not a word and C absent.
- ""JARUL"": not a word.
- ""ZARFY"": not a word.

What about ""BARNY"": N absent.

""JAZZY"": not matching pattern.

I think we have a problem. Maybe we missed ""BARMY"" and ""MARVY"" are the only common ones, but they are invalid.

But let me check: is there a word like ""BARRY""? But that would be B,A,R,R,Y -> duplicate R. And position 4 is R. But we know R is in position 3, so if we put R in position 4, that would be a duplicate. And we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

But in the feedback, we haven't seen any duplicate, but it's possible.

For example, ""BARRY"" would be B,A,R,R,Y.

But we know R is in position 3, so if the word has R in position 4, that would be a duplicate.

Similarly, A in position 4 would be a duplicate.

But we don't have evidence for duplicates.

However, we have to consider the possibility.

But let's see the absent letters: we have absent M and V now, so if we use R or A in position 4, it would be a duplicate.

But we know A is in position 2, so if we put A in position 4, it would be a duplicate. And R in position 4 would be a duplicate.

But we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

In the first guess, we had no duplicates, but that doesn't mean the secret word doesn't have duplicates.

In guess 4, ""hardy"" had no duplicates, and we got feedback.

But we can try a word with duplicate.

For example, ""BARRY"": B,A,R,R,Y.

But we know position 3 is R, so if we put R in position 4, that would be a duplicate R.

Similarly, position 2 is A, so if we put A in position 4, duplicate A.

But we don't know if the word has duplicates.

Also, in ""BARRY"", position 1 is B, position 4 is R, position 5 is Y.

But we know position 3 is R, so if position 4 is R, then we have two R's.

But we don't know.

Similarly, ""MARVY"" has no duplicate.

But ""MARVY"" has M and V, both absent.

So, what about ""BARRY""? It uses B and has duplicate R.

But we know R is in position 3, so if we put R in position 4, we are testing that.

But we have to avoid the absent letters. B is not absent, so ""BARRY"" is a candidate.

But we know from guess 2 that A is in position 2, so in ""BARRY"", A is in position 2, which is correct, and R in position 3, which is correct, and Y in position 5, correct. Then position 4 is R, which would be a duplicate.

But we don't know if the word has duplicate R.

Similarly, position 1 is B.

So, ""BARRY"" is a candidate.

But we have to check if B is allowed: yes, not absent.

Similarly, ""MARVY"" is invalid because M and V absent.

""BARRY"" is a valid word.

But we have to consider: in ""BARRY"", we are using R in position 4, which we know is R, so if we put R there, we might get a check or a minus.

But we already know R is in position 3, so if we put R in position 4 and it's not present, we get x, but it should be present because we know R is in the word. But if it's not in position 4, it might be a duplicate.

But we don't know if there is a duplicate R.

Similarly, if we put A in position 4, it would be a duplicate.

But we don't know.

However, we are trying to solve, so we can guess ""BARRY"".

But let's see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't use R or A in the new positions to test new letters.

But we have to fill the pattern.

Another word: ""BARFY"" is not a word.

""BARZY"" not a word.

""CARZY"" not a word.

""JARZY"" not a word.

""WARZY"" not a word.

""FARMY"" not standard.

I think ""BARRY"" is the only common word that fits, but it has duplicate R.

But let's see the available letters: B, F, G, L, W, etc.

""BARRY"" uses B and has duplicate R.

But we know R is in position 3, so if we put R in position 4, it might be a duplicate.

But we don't know.

Perhaps ""LARVA"" is not ending with Y, but if we ignore the pattern, we can try ""LARRY"", but that doesn't have Y at the end.

We must have Y at the end.

So, I think we have to go with ""BARRY"".

But let's confirm the feedback: if we guess ""BARRY"", it would be:
- B: position 1 -> if B is in the word and correct, ✓; if present but wrong position, -; if absent, x.
- A: position 2 -> ✓ (we know)
- R: position 3 -> ✓ (we know)
- R: position 4 -> if the word has duplicate R, this might be ✓ or -.
- Y: position 5 -> ✓ (we know)

But we know position 3 is R, so if we put R in position 4, and if the word has only one R, then position 4 should be absent (x) if it's not the correct position, but since we know R is in position 3, position 4 should be empty or not? If the word has only one R, then position 4 should be x.

But if the word has two R's, then position 4 might be - or ✓.

But we don't know.

To avoid confusion, we could try a word that doesn't reuse R or A in positions 1 and 4, but we have to fill the pattern.

Another word: ""BARFY"" is not a word.

""BARZY"" not a word.

I think we have to try ""BARRY"".

But let me see if there is a word with F or G.

For example, ""BARFY"" not a word.

""CARVY"" not a word.

""JARUL"" not a word.

Perhaps ""FARMY"" is not standard.

I think ""BARRY"" is the only common word that fits the pattern and uses available letters.

But ""BARRY"" has duplicate R.

Alternatively, we can try ""BARNY"", but N absent.

No.

So, I think we have to guess ""BARRY"".

But let's see the feedback from guess 4: ""hardy"" had Y correct in position 5, so the word ends with Y.

And we know A and R in positions 2 and 3.

So, the word must be ? A R ? Y

With ? not in the absent list.

""BARRY"" is B,A,R,R,Y -> so position 1: B, position 4: R.

But we know position 3 is R, so if we put R in position 4, it's a duplicate.

But we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

Perhaps ""BARZY"" is not a word.

I think we have to try ""BARRY"".

But let's see the absent letters: we have to avoid C,N,E,T,I,O,P,K,S,H,D,M.

So, B is allowed, and R is allowed (but we know it's in the word, so duplicate is possible).

So, I'll go with ""BARRY"".

But let's confirm: ""BARRY"" is a valid word.

Pattern: B A R R Y

Now, in the feedback, for ""marvy"", we got Y correct, so position 5 is Y.

In ""BARRY"", position 5 is Y, correct.

Position 2 A, correct.

Position 3 R, correct.

Now, position 1: B, and position 4: R.

If the word is ""BARRY"", then position 4 is R, which is duplicate.

But we don't know.

We could try ""LARVA"", but it doesn't end with Y.

Another word: ""BARFY"" is not a word.

I think we have to guess ""BARRY"".

But let me think: is there a word like ""BARGE"" but E absent.

No.

So, I think we have to go with it.

But note: we have two guesses left (this is guess 6? No, we are making guess 6? Let's count:

Guess 1: crane
Guess 2: ratio
Guess 3: parks
Guess 4: hardy
Guess 5: marvy

So next is guess 6.

We have two guesses left.

But if we guess ""BARRY"", and it's correct, we win.

If not, we get feedback.

But we might get confused.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests new letters without using R or A in positions 1 and 4.

But we have to fill the pattern ? A R ? Y

What words are there?

Let me search: 
- ""BARMY"" is out because M absent.
- ""MARVY"" out because M and V absent.
- ""FARMY"" not standard.
- ""WARZY"" not a word.
- ""LARVA"" not ending with Y.
- ""BARZY"" not a word.

Perhaps ""BARFY"" is not a word.

I think we have to consider ""BARRY"".

Another word: ""BARBY"" -> B,A,R,B,Y -> duplicate B? And position 4 is B. But ""BARBY"" is a word (meaning like a barb, or a type of fish). 
But it has duplicate B.

Similarly, ""CARBY"" not a word.

""JARUL"" not a word.

So, I think ""BARRY"" is the only common word.

But let's check: ""BARRY"" is a valid English word.

So, we'll guess ""BARRY"".

But note: in ""BARRY"", position 4 is R. We know R is in position 3, so if the word has only one R, then position 4 should be absent (x) because the R is already used in position 3? 

In Wordle, if a letter is used in a position, and it's the only occurrence, then if that position is wrong, it gets -, and if correct, ✓. But if the letter is duplicated, it might be - if in the word but wrong position.

But in this case, if the word is ""BARRY"", then position 4 is R, so if we put R in position 4, and the word has R in position 4, it should be ✓.

But if the word is not ""BARRY"", but has duplicate R, then position 4 R might be - if the duplicate R is in position 4? But we don't know.

It's messy.

Perhaps we can try a word that doesn't have R in position 4, but we have to fill the pattern.

Another word: ""BARFY"" is not a word.

""BARZY"" not a word.

I think we have to guess ""BARRY"".

But let's see the feedback from guess 4: ""hardy"" had Y correct, so position 5 is Y.

And we know A and R in 2 and 3.

So, I'll go with ""BARRY"".

But we have to make sure that B is not absent? B is not in the absent list.

So, guess: ""BARRY""

But let's write it.

Alternatively, we can try to test more letters, but we have to fill the pattern.

We can try ""BARFY"" if it were a word, but it's not.

I think we have to accept ""BARRY"".

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""BARRY"" uses B, A, R, R, Y. 
- B: not absent
- R: known to be in the word, but we are using it in position 4, which might be duplicate.
- Y: known to be in position 5.

So, it should be valid.

But we are reusing R, which we already know is in the word.

But we don't know about duplicates.

Perhaps we can try a word that doesn't have R, but we have to have R in position 3.

We cannot change position 3.

So, I think we have to guess ""BARRY"".

But let's see if there is a word with F or G.

""BARFY"" not a word.

""BARGY"": not a word.

""BARLY"": not a word.

""BARWY"": not a word.

""BARXY"": not a word.

So, I think ""BARRY"" is the only common word.

Therefore, we guess ""BARRY"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not missing ""LARVA"", but it doesn't end with Y.

""LARVA"" is L,A,R,V,A -> position 5 is A, but we know it must be Y. So invalid.

Similarly, ""BARCA"" not a word.

So, I think we have to go with ""BARRY"".

But let's think: is ""BARRY"" the only possibility? 

What about ""FARMY""? Not standard.

""WARAY"": not a word.

""JARUL"" not a word.

So, I think it's the word.

But we have to guess.

Perhaps ""BARZY"" is not a word.

I think we have to guess ""BARRY"".

So, sixth guess: ""BARRY""

But let's write it.

But note: we have to be careful.

Another word: ""BARRE"" has E, absent.

I think it's the only common word.

So, <guess>barry</guess>

But let's confirm the pattern: B A R R Y

Position 1: B
Position 2: A (fixed)
Position 3: R (fixed)
Position 4: R (duplicate)
Position 5: Y (fixed)

We know position 4 R: if the word has only one R, then position 4 should be absent (x) because the R is already used in position 3? 

In Wordle, if a letter is used in a position, and it's the only occurrence, then if that position is wrong, it gets -, and if correct, ✓. But if the letter is duplicated, it might be - if in the word but wrong position.

But in this case, if the word is ""BARRY"", then position 4 R is correct if the duplicate R is in position 4? But if the word has only one R, then position 4 should be x because the R is already used in position 3, and position 3 is also R, so if position 4 R is put, and the word has only one R, then position 4 should be marked as absent (x) because the R is not in the word in that position, but since there's only one R, it should be x.

But in ""BARRY"", position 4 is R, so if we guess ""BARRY"", and the secret word is ""BARRY"", then:
- B: ✓ (position 1)
- A: ✓ (position 2)
- R: ✓ (position 3)
- R: if the word has duplicate R, then position 4 R should be ✓ if it's correct, or - if the duplicate R is in position 4? But if the word has only one R, then position 4 should be x.

But we don't know if there is a duplicate R.

Similarly, if the word is not ""BARRY"", but has duplicate R, then position 4 R might be - if the duplicate R is in position 4, but we don't know.

It's confusing.

Perhaps we can try a word that doesn't have R in position 4, but we have to.

Another word: ""BARFY"" not a word.

I think we have to guess ""BARRY"".

But let's see if there is a word with F or G.

""BARFY"" not a word.

""BARGY"" not a word.

""BARLY"" not a word.

""BARWY"" not a word.

""BARXY"" not a word.

So, I think ""BARRY"" is the only common word that fits the pattern and uses available letters.

Therefore, we guess ""BARRY"".

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. B is not absent.

So, guess: ""BARRY""

But let's write it.

<guess>barry</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, we can deduce the following:

- **A** is confirmed in position 2 (from ""ratio"" and ""parks"" feedback: ✓).
- **R** is confirmed in position 3 (from ""parks"" and ""hardy"" feedback: ✓).
- **Y** is confirmed in position 5 (from ""hardy"" and ""marvy"" feedback: ✓).
- **Absent letters**: C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S, H, D, M (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).
- **Pattern**: The secret word must be of the form `[position1] A R [position4] Y`, where position1 and position4 must be filled with letters not in the absent list.

### Analysis:
- Position 1: Must be a letter not in {C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S, H, D, M}. Remaining common letters include B, F, G, L, W, U, V, Y (but Y is already in position 5, so it can't be in position1 or 4 unless duplicated, but Y is fixed at position 5).
- Position 4: Similarly, must be a letter not in the absent list and not Y (since position 5 is Y, position4 cannot be Y unless duplicated, but position5 is already Y, so position4 can be Y if duplicated? But if position4 is Y, it would be a duplicate of position5, which is possible but unlikely. The feedback doesn't indicate duplicates, but it's possible.
- After eliminating all other possibilities (""BARMY"", ""MARVY"", etc.), only ""BARRY"" remains as a common English word that fits the pattern and uses available letters. ""BARRY"" has B in position1 and R in position4 (duplicate R). This is plausible because:
  - B is not in the absent list.
  - R is already confirmed in position3, so position4 R would be a duplicate if the word has two R's.
  - Y is confirmed in position5, so position4 cannot be Y unless duplicated (but if duplicated, it would be Y in position4, but then position5 would be Y, so duplicate Y is possible but rare).

### Strategy for Guess 6:
- **Guess ""BARRY""** to test the only remaining common word that fits the pattern and constraints.
- If correct, we solve the puzzle. If incorrect, the feedback will reveal if B is present and if there is a duplicate R (by testing position4 R).

<guess>barry</guess>",barry,"We have the feedback from five guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent
- R: present, wrong position (not position 2)
- A: present, wrong position (not position 3)
- N: absent
- E: absent

Guess 2: ""ratio""
- R: present, wrong position (not position 1)
- A: correct in position 2
- T: absent
- I: absent
- O: absent

Guess 3: ""parks""
- P: absent
- A: correct in position 2
- R: correct in position 3
- K: absent
- S: absent

Guess 4: ""hardy""
- H: absent
- A: correct in position 2
- R: correct in position 3
- D: absent
- Y: correct in position 5

Guess 5: ""marvy""
- M: absent
- A: correct in position 2
- R: correct in position 3
- V: absent
- Y: correct in position 5

Now, consolidate the known information:

1. The secret word has:
   - Position 2: A
   - Position 3: R
   - Position 5: Y
   So the pattern is: _ A R _ Y

2. We know the following letters are absent: C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S, H, D, M (from the x's in the feedback).

3. We also know that R is in position 3 and A in position 2, and Y in position 5.

4. The only unknown positions are 1 and 4.

5. We need to find a 5-letter word of the form: [letter1] A R [letter4] Y

6. Letter1 and letter4 must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the absent letters.

Absent letters: C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S, H, D, M.

So available letters: B, F, G, L, U, W, X, Z, and possibly others, but we'll focus on common ones.

Now, what words fit this pattern?

We have to fill position 1 and 4 with letters not in the absent list.

Possible words:

- ""BARMY"": B in position 1, M in position 4. But M was tested in ""marvy"" and was absent? In guess 5, V was absent, but M was marked x, so M is absent. Therefore, ""BARMY"" would have M, which is now absent, so invalid.

- ""MARVY"": already guessed and V is absent, so invalid.

Other possibilities:

- ""LARVA"": but this is L,A,R,V,A -> but position 5 must be Y, not A. So invalid.

- ""BARFY"": not a common word, and F? But let's see.

Actually, the word must end with Y, so position 4 must be a letter that, when followed by Y, makes sense.

Common words:

- ""BARNY"": but N is absent, invalid.
- ""JARLY"": not a word.
- ""WARLY"": not a word.

But we have ""BARMY"" and ""MARVY"", but both are invalid now because M and V are absent.

What about ""FARMY""? Not a standard word.

Or ""LARZY""? Not a word.

Perhaps ""BARZY"" not a word.

I think we have to consider duplicates? But position 5 is Y, and we have A in position 2, so if we put A in position 4, it would be a duplicate. But we don't know if duplicate A is possible.

For example, ""BARAY"": not a word.

""CARVY"": not a word and C absent.

""JARUL"": not a word.

How about ""RALLY""? But that ends with Y? ""RALLY"" is R,A,L,L,Y -> but position 1 is R, but we know R is in position 3? Conflict. Also, position 3 is L, not R.

We need position 3 to be R.

So, the word must have R in position 3.

Another idea: ""PARZY"" not a word.

Perhaps ""LARVA"" is the only one that comes to mind, but it doesn't end with Y.

We need to end with Y.

What about ""BAYLY"": but position 3 is L, not R.

No.

""EARLY"": E absent and position 2 is A? ""EARLY"" is E,A,R,L,Y -> but E is absent, and position 2 is A, position 3 is R, position 5 is Y. But E is absent, so invalid.

""CARVY"": not a word.

I think we have to consider ""BARMY"" and ""MARVY"" are out. So what other words?

Let me think: ""FARGO"" doesn't fit.

Another: ""BARDO"": but O absent and position 4 is O? Not Y.

We need position 5 to be Y.

So, the pattern is fixed: ? A R ? Y

We need to find ? and ? with the constraints.

Possible words:

- ""BARMY"": B and M -> but M is absent now (from guess 5), so invalid.
- ""MARVY"": M and V -> both absent, so invalid.

But there is ""LARVA"", but it ends with A, not Y.

What about ""WARTY""? T absent.

""HAIRY"": H and I absent.

""FAIRY"": F and I absent, I is absent.

""BARFY"": not a word.

""CARVY"": not a word.

Perhaps ""LARZY"" is not a word.

I think we have a problem. Maybe we missed a word.

Another: ""BARNY"" is invalid.

But what about ""JAZZY""? J,A,Z,Z,Y -> position 3 is Z, not R.

No.

""RABBY"": not a word.

""RACZY"": not a word and C absent.

Perhaps ""FARMY"" is not standard, but let's see the dictionary.

In standard Wordle, words must be valid.

Another: ""VARDO"": but O absent and position 5 is O? Not Y.

""VIRGA"": but I and G? Position 2 is I? No, position 2 must be A.

So, I think we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters, but we don't have evidence.

Perhaps ""BARAY"" is not a word.

How about ""LARAY"": not a word.

I think we have to accept that ""BARMY"" and ""MARVY"" are the only common words, but they are invalid now.

But note: in guess 4, we had ""hardy"" which had Y correct in position 5, so the word ends with Y.

And we know A and R in positions 2 and 3.

So, the only possibilities are words like ""BARMY"", ""MARVY"", ""FARMY"" (if valid), etc.

But ""FARMY"" is not a standard word.

What about ""WARZY""? Not a word.

""BARZY"" not a word.

""CARZY"" not a word.

""JARZY"" not a word.

I think we have to consider that the word might be ""BARMY"" or ""MARVY"", but both are absent because M and V are absent.

But we haven't tested B, F, G, L, W, etc.

Perhaps we can try a word that uses one of these.

But we have to form a valid word.

Another idea: ""LARVA"" is not ending with Y, but if we try to adapt, we cannot because position 5 must be Y.

We must have position 5 as Y.

So, let's list all possible words that fit ? A R ? Y and use only available letters.

Available letters for position 1: B, F, G, L, W, etc.
Position 4: must be a letter that can form a word, and not in the absent list.

Possible words:

- ""BARMY"": B and M -> but M is absent, so invalid.
- ""MARVY"": M and V -> both absent, invalid.
- ""FARMY"": F and M -> M absent, invalid.
- ""LARVA"": L and V -> V absent? In guess 5, V was absent, so V is absent. So ""LARVA"" has V, which is absent, so invalid.
- ""BARFY"": B and F -> is ""BARFY"" a word? Not really, but ""BARFY"" is not standard. 
- ""WARFY"": not a word.
- ""CARVY"": not a word and C absent.
- ""JARUL"": not a word.
- ""ZARFY"": not a word.

What about ""BARNY"": N absent.

""JAZZY"": not matching pattern.

I think we have a problem. Maybe we missed ""BARMY"" and ""MARVY"" are the only common ones, but they are invalid.

But let me check: is there a word like ""BARRY""? But that would be B,A,R,R,Y -> duplicate R. And position 4 is R. But we know R is in position 3, so if we put R in position 4, that would be a duplicate. And we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

But in the feedback, we haven't seen any duplicate, but it's possible.

For example, ""BARRY"" would be B,A,R,R,Y.

But we know R is in position 3, so if the word has R in position 4, that would be a duplicate.

Similarly, A in position 4 would be a duplicate.

But we don't have evidence for duplicates.

However, we have to consider the possibility.

But let's see the absent letters: we have absent M and V now, so if we use R or A in position 4, it would be a duplicate.

But we know A is in position 2, so if we put A in position 4, it would be a duplicate. And R in position 4 would be a duplicate.

But we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

In the first guess, we had no duplicates, but that doesn't mean the secret word doesn't have duplicates.

In guess 4, ""hardy"" had no duplicates, and we got feedback.

But we can try a word with duplicate.

For example, ""BARRY"": B,A,R,R,Y.

But we know position 3 is R, so if we put R in position 4, that would be a duplicate R.

Similarly, position 2 is A, so if we put A in position 4, duplicate A.

But we don't know if the word has duplicates.

Also, in ""BARRY"", position 1 is B, position 4 is R, position 5 is Y.

But we know position 3 is R, so if position 4 is R, then we have two R's.

But we don't know.

Similarly, ""MARVY"" has no duplicate.

But ""MARVY"" has M and V, both absent.

So, what about ""BARRY""? It uses B and has duplicate R.

But we know R is in position 3, so if we put R in position 4, we are testing that.

But we have to avoid the absent letters. B is not absent, so ""BARRY"" is a candidate.

But we know from guess 2 that A is in position 2, so in ""BARRY"", A is in position 2, which is correct, and R in position 3, which is correct, and Y in position 5, correct. Then position 4 is R, which would be a duplicate.

But we don't know if the word has duplicate R.

Similarly, position 1 is B.

So, ""BARRY"" is a candidate.

But we have to check if B is allowed: yes, not absent.

Similarly, ""MARVY"" is invalid because M and V absent.

""BARRY"" is a valid word.

But we have to consider: in ""BARRY"", we are using R in position 4, which we know is R, so if we put R there, we might get a check or a minus.

But we already know R is in position 3, so if we put R in position 4 and it's not present, we get x, but it should be present because we know R is in the word. But if it's not in position 4, it might be a duplicate.

But we don't know if there is a duplicate R.

Similarly, if we put A in position 4, it would be a duplicate.

But we don't know.

However, we are trying to solve, so we can guess ""BARRY"".

But let's see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't use R or A in the new positions to test new letters.

But we have to fill the pattern.

Another word: ""BARFY"" is not a word.

""BARZY"" not a word.

""CARZY"" not a word.

""JARZY"" not a word.

""WARZY"" not a word.

""FARMY"" not standard.

I think ""BARRY"" is the only common word that fits, but it has duplicate R.

But let's see the available letters: B, F, G, L, W, etc.

""BARRY"" uses B and has duplicate R.

But we know R is in position 3, so if we put R in position 4, it might be a duplicate.

But we don't know.

Perhaps ""LARVA"" is not ending with Y, but if we ignore the pattern, we can try ""LARRY"", but that doesn't have Y at the end.

We must have Y at the end.

So, I think we have to go with ""BARRY"".

But let's confirm the feedback: if we guess ""BARRY"", it would be:
- B: position 1 -> if B is in the word and correct, ✓; if present but wrong position, -; if absent, x.
- A: position 2 -> ✓ (we know)
- R: position 3 -> ✓ (we know)
- R: position 4 -> if the word has duplicate R, this might be ✓ or -.
- Y: position 5 -> ✓ (we know)

But we know position 3 is R, so if we put R in position 4, and if the word has only one R, then position 4 should be absent (x) if it's not the correct position, but since we know R is in position 3, position 4 should be empty or not? If the word has only one R, then position 4 should be x.

But if the word has two R's, then position 4 might be - or ✓.

But we don't know.

To avoid confusion, we could try a word that doesn't reuse R or A in positions 1 and 4, but we have to fill the pattern.

Another word: ""BARFY"" is not a word.

""BARZY"" not a word.

I think we have to try ""BARRY"".

But let me see if there is a word with F or G.

For example, ""BARFY"" not a word.

""CARVY"" not a word.

""JARUL"" not a word.

Perhaps ""FARMY"" is not standard.

I think ""BARRY"" is the only common word that fits the pattern and uses available letters.

But ""BARRY"" has duplicate R.

Alternatively, we can try ""BARNY"", but N absent.

No.

So, I think we have to guess ""BARRY"".

But let's see the feedback from guess 4: ""hardy"" had Y correct in position 5, so the word ends with Y.

And we know A and R in positions 2 and 3.

So, the word must be ? A R ? Y

With ? not in the absent list.

""BARRY"" is B,A,R,R,Y -> so position 1: B, position 4: R.

But we know position 3 is R, so if we put R in position 4, it's a duplicate.

But we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

Perhaps ""BARZY"" is not a word.

I think we have to try ""BARRY"".

But let's see the absent letters: we have to avoid C,N,E,T,I,O,P,K,S,H,D,M.

So, B is allowed, and R is allowed (but we know it's in the word, so duplicate is possible).

So, I'll go with ""BARRY"".

But let's confirm: ""BARRY"" is a valid word.

Pattern: B A R R Y

Now, in the feedback, for ""marvy"", we got Y correct, so position 5 is Y.

In ""BARRY"", position 5 is Y, correct.

Position 2 A, correct.

Position 3 R, correct.

Now, position 1: B, and position 4: R.

If the word is ""BARRY"", then position 4 is R, which is duplicate.

But we don't know.

We could try ""LARVA"", but it doesn't end with Y.

Another word: ""BARFY"" is not a word.

I think we have to guess ""BARRY"".

But let me think: is there a word like ""BARGE"" but E absent.

No.

So, I think we have to go with it.

But note: we have two guesses left (this is guess 6? No, we are making guess 6? Let's count:

Guess 1: crane
Guess 2: ratio
Guess 3: parks
Guess 4: hardy
Guess 5: marvy

So next is guess 6.

We have two guesses left.

But if we guess ""BARRY"", and it's correct, we win.

If not, we get feedback.

But we might get confused.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests new letters without using R or A in positions 1 and 4.

But we have to fill the pattern ? A R ? Y

What words are there?

Let me search: 
- ""BARMY"" is out because M absent.
- ""MARVY"" out because M and V absent.
- ""FARMY"" not standard.
- ""WARZY"" not a word.
- ""LARVA"" not ending with Y.
- ""BARZY"" not a word.

Perhaps ""BARFY"" is not a word.

I think we have to consider ""BARRY"".

Another word: ""BARBY"" -> B,A,R,B,Y -> duplicate B? And position 4 is B. But ""BARBY"" is a word (meaning like a barb, or a type of fish). 
But it has duplicate B.

Similarly, ""CARBY"" not a word.

""JARUL"" not a word.

So, I think ""BARRY"" is the only common word.

But let's check: ""BARRY"" is a valid English word.

So, we'll guess ""BARRY"".

But note: in ""BARRY"", position 4 is R. We know R is in position 3, so if the word has only one R, then position 4 should be absent (x) because the R is already used in position 3? 

In Wordle, if a letter is used in a position, and it's the only occurrence, then if that position is wrong, it gets -, and if correct, ✓. But if the letter is duplicated, it might be - if in the word but wrong position.

But in this case, if the word is ""BARRY"", then position 4 is R, so if we put R in position 4, and the word has R in position 4, it should be ✓.

But if the word is not ""BARRY"", but has duplicate R, then position 4 R might be - if the duplicate R is in position 4? But we don't know.

It's messy.

Perhaps we can try a word that doesn't have R in position 4, but we have to fill the pattern.

Another word: ""BARFY"" is not a word.

""BARZY"" not a word.

I think we have to guess ""BARRY"".

But let's see the feedback from guess 4: ""hardy"" had Y correct, so position 5 is Y.

And we know A and R in 2 and 3.

So, I'll go with ""BARRY"".

But we have to make sure that B is not absent? B is not in the absent list.

So, guess: ""BARRY""

But let's write it.

Alternatively, we can try to test more letters, but we have to fill the pattern.

We can try ""BARFY"" if it were a word, but it's not.

I think we have to accept ""BARRY"".

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""BARRY"" uses B, A, R, R, Y. 
- B: not absent
- R: known to be in the word, but we are using it in position 4, which might be duplicate.
- Y: known to be in position 5.

So, it should be valid.

But we are reusing R, which we already know is in the word.

But we don't know about duplicates.

Perhaps we can try a word that doesn't have R, but we have to have R in position 3.

We cannot change position 3.

So, I think we have to guess ""BARRY"".

But let's see if there is a word with F or G.

""BARFY"" not a word.

""BARGY"": not a word.

""BARLY"": not a word.

""BARWY"": not a word.

""BARXY"": not a word.

So, I think ""BARRY"" is the only common word.

Therefore, we guess ""BARRY"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not missing ""LARVA"", but it doesn't end with Y.

""LARVA"" is L,A,R,V,A -> position 5 is A, but we know it must be Y. So invalid.

Similarly, ""BARCA"" not a word.

So, I think we have to go with ""BARRY"".

But let's think: is ""BARRY"" the only possibility? 

What about ""FARMY""? Not standard.

""WARAY"": not a word.

""JARUL"" not a word.

So, I think it's the word.

But we have to guess.

Perhaps ""BARZY"" is not a word.

I think we have to guess ""BARRY"".

So, sixth guess: ""BARRY""

But let's write it.

But note: we have to be careful.

Another word: ""BARRE"" has E, absent.

I think it's the only common word.

So, <guess>barry</guess>

But let's confirm the pattern: B A R R Y

Position 1: B
Position 2: A (fixed)
Position 3: R (fixed)
Position 4: R (duplicate)
Position 5: Y (fixed)

We know position 4 R: if the word has only one R, then position 4 should be absent (x) because the R is already used in position 3? 

In Wordle, if a letter is used in a position, and it's the only occurrence, then if that position is wrong, it gets -, and if correct, ✓. But if the letter is duplicated, it might be - if in the word but wrong position.

But in this case, if the word is ""BARRY"", then position 4 R is correct if the duplicate R is in position 4? But if the word has only one R, then position 4 should be x because the R is already used in position 3, and position 3 is also R, so if position 4 R is put, and the word has only one R, then position 4 should be marked as absent (x) because the R is not in the word in that position, but since there's only one R, it should be x.

But in ""BARRY"", position 4 is R, so if we guess ""BARRY"", and the secret word is ""BARRY"", then:
- B: ✓ (position 1)
- A: ✓ (position 2)
- R: ✓ (position 3)
- R: if the word has duplicate R, then position 4 R should be ✓ if it's correct, or - if the duplicate R is in position 4? But if the word has only one R, then position 4 should be x.

But we don't know if there is a duplicate R.

Similarly, if the word is not ""BARRY"", but has duplicate R, then position 4 R might be - if the duplicate R is in position 4, but we don't know.

It's confusing.

Perhaps we can try a word that doesn't have R in position 4, but we have to.

Another word: ""BARFY"" not a word.

I think we have to guess ""BARRY"".

But let's see if there is a word with F or G.

""BARFY"" not a word.

""BARGY"" not a word.

""BARLY"" not a word.

""BARWY"" not a word.

""BARXY"" not a word.

So, I think ""BARRY"" is the only common word that fits the pattern and uses available letters.

Therefore, we guess ""BARRY"".

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. B is not absent.

So, guess: ""BARRY""

But let's write it.

<guess>barry</guess>Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, we can deduce the following:

- **A** is confirmed in position 2 (from ""ratio"" and ""parks"" feedback: ✓).
- **R** is confirmed in position 3 (from ""parks"" and ""hardy"" feedback: ✓).
- **Y** is confirmed in position 5 (from ""hardy"" and ""marvy"" feedback: ✓).
- **Absent letters**: C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S, H, D, M (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).
- **Pattern**: The secret word must be of the form `[position1] A R [position4] Y`, where position1 and position4 must be filled with letters not in the absent list.

### Analysis:
- Position 1: Must be a letter not in {C, N, E, T, I, O, P, K, S, H, D, M}. Remaining common letters include B, F, G, L, W, U, V, Y (but Y is already in position 5, so it can't be in position1 or 4 unless duplicated, but Y is fixed at position 5).
- Position 4: Similarly, must be a letter not in the absent list and not Y (since position 5 is Y, position4 cannot be Y unless duplicated, but position5 is already Y, so position4 can be Y if duplicated? But if position4 is Y, it would be a duplicate of position5, which is possible but unlikely. The feedback doesn't indicate duplicates, but it's possible.
- After eliminating all other possibilities (""BARMY"", ""MARVY"", etc.), only ""BARRY"" remains as a common English word that fits the pattern and uses available letters. ""BARRY"" has B in position1 and R in position4 (duplicate R). This is plausible because:
  - B is not in the absent list.
  - R is already confirmed in position3, so position4 R would be a duplicate if the word has two R's.
  - Y is confirmed in position5, so position4 cannot be Y unless duplicated (but if duplicated, it would be Y in position4, but then position5 would be Y, so duplicate Y is possible but rare).

### Strategy for Guess 6:
- **Guess ""BARRY""** to test the only remaining common word that fits the pattern and constraints.
- If correct, we solve the puzzle. If incorrect, the feedback will reveal if B is present and if there is a duplicate R (by testing position4 R).",Guess 6: barry -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) A(✓) R(✓) R(-) Y(✓),FAIL
