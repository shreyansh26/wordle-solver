We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: ✓ (correct position, so N is the 4th letter)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The 4th letter is N.
- The letter A is in the word, but not in the 2nd position (since we guessed it in the 2nd position and it was marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, R, and E are not in the word.

We also know that the word has 5 letters and is a valid English word.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Has N in the 4th position (since it was correct in the first guess and we know it's fixed there).
- Includes the letter A, but not in the 2nd position (so we can try it in a different position to find the correct one).
- Avoids the letters C, R, E (since they are not in the word).

Additionally, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

Let's think of words that have N in the 4th position and include the letter A.

Possible positions for A: since it's not in the 2nd position, we can try it in the 1st, 3rd, or 5th position.

We also want to use other common consonants that we haven't tried yet. We haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: we should avoid the letters that we know are not in the word: C, R, E.

Let me try to think of words that have the pattern: _ _ _ N _

And include the letter A.

Some possibilities:
- A _ _ N _ : but we know A is not in the 2nd position, so we can try A in the 1st? But we don't know if it's in the 1st or not. We can try.
- Alternatively, we can try A in the 3rd or 5th.

We also want to test other letters to get more information.

Let me list some words that fit:
- ""PLANT"": P L A N T -> but we have A in the 3rd position and N in the 4th. However, we know A is in the word, but we don't know if it's in the 3rd. Also, we haven't used P, L, T.

But note: we have to avoid R, C, E. This word doesn't have those.

Alternatively, we can try ""MANGO"": M A N G O -> but we have A in the 2nd position? But we know A is not in the 2nd position? Wait, no: in the first guess, we had A in the 2nd position and it was marked as wrong position, meaning A is in the word but not in the 2nd. So we cannot put A in the 2nd again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there. We should try A in a different position.

In ""MANGO"", A is in the 2nd position, which we know is wrong. So that would be a waste because we already know A is not in the 2nd.

We need a word that has A in either the 1st, 3rd, or 5th.

Let me think of words with A in the 1st: 
- ""ADORN"": but we have R? We know R is not in the word (from first feedback: R was x). So we cannot use R.

We must avoid R, C, E.

So, words without C, R, E.

With A in the 1st: 
- ""ALIGN"": A L I G N -> but we have N in the 5th? We need N in the 4th. So the pattern is _ _ _ N _ -> so the 4th is N, then the 5th is something.

Actually, in ""ALIGN"", the N is the 5th letter, not the 4th. So that doesn't fit.

We need the 4th to be N.

So, let's think of words with the 4th letter N and the 1st letter A? 
- ""A _ _ N _""

Examples: 
- ""ALIGN"" has N at the end, not the 4th.
- ""ABHOR"" has R and H, but R is not allowed.

We need to avoid R, C, E.

Try A in the 1st: 
- ""ADMIN"": A D M I N -> but the 4th letter is I? No, the 4th is N? Let's see: A (1st), D (2nd), M (3rd), I (4th), N (5th). So the 4th is I, not N. So that doesn't work.

We need the 4th to be N. So the word must be: _ _ _ N _

With A in the 1st: 
- ""A _ _ N _"" -> examples: ""AFTER"" has E and R -> not allowed. 
- ""ALONG"": A L O N G -> this has A in 1st, L in 2nd, O in 3rd, N in 4th, G in 5th. And no R, C, E. So that's a candidate.

But note: we know A is in the word, and we are putting it in the 1st position. If the correct position is not 1st, then we'll get a '-' for A and know it's in the 3rd or 5th.

Alternatively, we can try A in the 3rd position: _ _ A N _

Examples: 
- ""PLANT"": P L A N T -> A is in 3rd, and N in 4th. No R, C, E. So that's a candidate.

Or ""GRANT"": but G R A N T -> has R, which is not allowed.

Another: ""BLAND"": B L A N D -> A in 3rd, N in 4th. No R, C, E. So that's a candidate.

Or ""STAND"": S T A N D -> A in 3rd, N in 4th. But we have S, T, D. However, we don't know if S, T, D are in the word.

But note: we also want to test new letters.

We have two candidates so far: ""ALONG"" and ""PLANT"" and ""BLAND"".

But we also have the option to try A in the 5th position: _ _ _ N A

Examples: 
- ""PIZZA"": but has Z and Z, and we don't know about Z. Also, we have two Z's? But we don't know if Z is in the word. Also, we want to test more common letters.

- ""MANIA"": M A N I A -> but the 4th letter is I? No, the 4th is N? Let's see: M (1st), A (2nd), N (3rd), I (4th), A (5th). So the 4th is I, not N. So that doesn't work.

We need the 4th to be N. So the word must be: _ _ _ N A

Examples: 
- ""URBAN"": U R B A N -> but R is not allowed.
- ""DOGMA"": D O G M A -> 4th is M, not N.

It's hard to find words with the pattern _ _ _ N A without using forbidden letters.

Another: ""PIANO"": P I A N O -> but the 4th is N? Let's see: P (1st), I (2nd), A (3rd), N (4th), O (5th). Yes! So A is in the 3rd and N in the 4th. And we avoid R, C, E.

But note: in ""PIANO"", we have A in the 3rd position. We know A is in the word, but we don't know if it's in the 3rd. We can try.

But wait, we already have two candidates: ""ALONG"" (A in 1st) and ""PIANO"" (A in 3rd). Which one is better?

We also have ""PLANT"" (A in 3rd).

But note: we want to maximize information. We should try to include letters that we haven't tested yet.

In the first guess, we used: C, R, A, N, E. We know C, R, E are absent. So we have tested A and N (with N being correct in the 4th).

Now, we want to test new letters. So ""PIANO"" uses P, I, A, N, O. We already know A and N are in the word (N is fixed). So we are testing P, I, O.

Similarly, ""ALONG"" uses A, L, O, N, G. We know A and N, so testing L, O, G.

But note: in ""ALONG"", we are putting A in the 1st position. If the correct position is not 1st, then we get a '-' for A and know it's in the 3rd or 5th.

In ""PIANO"", we are putting A in the 3rd position. If the correct position is not 3rd, then we get a '-' for A and know it's in the 1st or 5th.

We have two possibilities for A: 1st or 5th? Actually, it could be in the 3rd? But we don't know.

We can also consider words that have A in the 5th: _ _ _ N A

Examples: 
- ""PIZZA"": not good because of Z and we don't know.
- ""JUMNA"": not a word.
- ""TUNNA"": not common.

It's difficult. So let's stick with words that have A in the 1st or 3rd.

Another candidate: ""SALON"": S A L O N -> but the 4th is O? No, the 4th is N? Let's see: S (1st), A (2nd), L (3rd), O (4th), N (5th). So the 4th is O, not N. So no.

We need the 4th to be N. So the word must be: _ _ _ N _

So for A in the 1st: A _ _ N _
For A in the 3rd: _ _ A N _

Let me list more words:

With A in 1st: 
- ""ADMIN"" -> A D M I N -> 4th is I, not N -> invalid pattern.
- ""ADORN"" -> has R and O, but R is not allowed.
- ""AGLOW"": A G L O W -> 4th is O, not N.

Actually, we need the 4th to be N. So the word must have the 4th letter as N.

So for A in 1st: 
- ""A _ _ N _"" -> the 4th is N, then the 5th is something.

Examples: 
- ""ALIGN"" -> A L I G N -> 4th is G, not N -> no.
- ""ATTAIN"" -> too long.

5-letter words: 
- ""AUNTY"": A U N T Y -> but the 3rd is N? Let's see: A (1st), U (2nd), N (3rd), T (4th), Y (5th). So the 4th is T, not N. So no.

We need the 4th to be N. So the word must be: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] N [letter5]

So for A in 1st: 
- ""A _ _ N _""

Examples: 
- ""ADMIN"" -> A D M I N -> but the 4th is I, not N -> invalid.
- ""AFTER"" -> has E and R -> not allowed.

Actually, I can't think of a common word with A in 1st and N in 4th. 

Let me try A in the 3rd: _ _ A N _

Examples: 
- ""BLAND"": B L A N D -> B (1st), L (2nd), A (3rd), N (4th), D (5th). This fits: _ _ A N _ -> with A in 3rd and N in 4th.

Similarly, ""PLANT"": P L A N T -> same pattern.

Or ""GRANT"": but has R -> not allowed.

Or ""STAND"": S T A N D -> S (1st), T (2nd), A (3rd), N (4th), D (5th). No R, C, E.

So ""STAND"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""BLAND"": B L A N D -> same.

Now, for A in the 5th: _ _ _ N A

Examples: 
- ""PIZZA"": P I Z Z A -> 4th is Z, not N -> no.
- ""TUNNA"": not common and 4th is N? T U N N A -> 4th is N, 5th is A. But ""TUNNA"" is not a common word. We need valid words.

""MANIA"": M A N I A -> 4th is I, not N.

""MANNA"": M A N N A -> 4th is N? M (1st), A (2nd), N (3rd), N (4th), A (5th). So the 4th is N? Yes: positions: 1:M, 2:A, 3:N, 4:N, 5:A. So we have N in the 3rd and 4th? But we know N is in the 4th, but we don't know about the 3rd. However, we have two N's? But we don't know if the word has two N's.

But ""MANNA"" is a word (a type of fruit). But let's see: we are testing M, A, N, N, A. We know A and N are in the word. So we are testing M and the second N (which might be redundant if the word has only one N? But we don't know).

Alternatively, ""PIANO"" is a good candidate: P I A N O -> 1:P, 2:I, 3:A, 4:N, 5:O.

This has A in the 3rd and N in the 4th. We know A is in the word but not in the 2nd, so we are trying it in the 3rd. We also test P, I, O.

Similarly, ""PIANO"" is a valid word.

Another candidate: ""PLAIN"": P L A I N -> but the 4th is I, not N -> no.

""TRAIN"": has R -> not allowed.

""PLAIN"": P L A I N -> 4th is I, not N.

So ""PIANO"" is a good candidate.

But note: we have to avoid using letters we know are absent. We know C, R, E are absent. P, I, O are new.

We can also consider ""SALON"", but that doesn't fit because the 4th is O.

Another word: ""BANJO"": B A N J O -> but the 3rd is N, 4th is O -> no.

I think ""PIANO"" is a good choice because:
- It has A in the 3rd position (so we can check if A is in the 3rd or not).
- It has N in the 4th (which we know is correct, so we can confirm and also test other letters).

But note: we already know N is in the 4th, so we will get a check for N again? Yes, because it's in the same position. But that's okay because it confirms the position and we get to test other letters.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't repeat N? But we don't have to, because we know N is fixed in the 4th.

But to test more letters, we might want to avoid repeating N? Or we can use it to get more information about the other positions.

Since we have limited guesses, we want to maximize information. So it's better to use a word that has new letters and doesn't repeat the ones we know are absent, and also doesn't repeat N in a way that we can get new information? Actually, repeating N in the 4th is okay because we know it's correct, but we are using the same position again. The new information will be in the other positions.

But we are required to have N in the 4th.

So let's choose between ""ALONG"", ""PLANT"", ""STAND"", and ""PIANO"".

We can also consider ""DAUNT"": D A U N T -> but the 4th is N? D (1st), A (2nd), U (3rd), N (4th), T (5th). But we know A is not in the 2nd (from first feedback). So we cannot put A in the 2nd again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting A in the 2nd.

In ""DAUNT"", A is in the 2nd, which we know is wrong. So that would be a waste.

Similarly, in ""PIANO"", A is in the 3rd, which is new.

In ""ALONG"", A is in the 1st, which is new.

In ""PLANT"", A is in the 3rd, same as PIANO.

But ""PIANO"" has the advantage of having three new vowels (I and O) and a consonant (P).

Alternatively, we can use a word that has A in the 5th? But we couldn't find a common one without forbidden letters.

Another word: ""LAMIN"": not common.

""MANIA"": not because 4th is I.

I think ""PIANO"" is a good choice.

But let me check if there's a word that has A in the 5th: 
- ""DELTA"": but has E and R -> not allowed.
- ""BETTA"": has E -> not allowed.
- ""LYTTA"": not common.

So maybe ""PIANO"" is a good option.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know.

I think we should go with ""PIANO"".

So my second guess: PIANO

But let me confirm: 
- P: new
- I: new
- A: we know it's in the word, but we are trying it in the 3rd
- N: we know is in the 4th, so we expect a check for N.
- O: new

We avoid C, R, E.

So, let's go with ""PIANO"".

But wait, what if the word has A in the 1st? Then in ""PIANO"", A is in the 3rd and we get a '-' for A. Then we know A is in the 1st or 5th. And we get information about P, I, O.

If the word has A in the 3rd, then we get a check for A? But we don't know if A is in the 3rd or not.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in the 1st to test that possibility.

For example, ""ALONG"": A L O N G -> A in 1st, L in 2nd, O in 3rd, N in 4th, G in 5th.

This tests A in the 1st, and we test L, O, G.

We know A is in the word, so if we put it in the 1st, we might get:
- If A is in the 1st, then we get a check for A.
- If not, then we get a '-' for A (meaning it's in the 3rd or 5th) and we know.

Also, we test L, O, G.

Similarly, ""PLANT"": P L A N T -> A in 3rd.

I think both are good. But ""ALONG"" tests A in the 1st, which we haven't tested, while ""PIANO"" tests A in the 3rd.

Since we know A is not in the 2nd, we have two possibilities: 1st or 5th. So testing A in the 1st will help us narrow it down.

Therefore, I choose ""ALONG"".

But wait, in ""ALONG"", we have A in the 1st and we know A is in the word. So if the correct position is 1st, we get a check. If not, we get a '-' and know it's in the 5th.

Also, we test L, O, G.

Alternatively, we can use ""STAND"": S T A N D -> A in 3rd.

But I think testing A in the 1st is a good idea.

So I'll go with ""ALONG"".

But let me see if there's a word that has A in the 5th and doesn't use forbidden letters. After some thought, I found ""PENNA"": P E N N A -> but E is not allowed (we know E is absent). So invalid.

""JUNNA"": not common.

So ""ALONG"" seems good.

But note: we have to make sure the word is valid. ""ALONG"" is a valid word.

So second guess: ALONG

But let me compare with ""PIANO"". Both are valid.

I think ""ALONG"" is better because it tests A in the 1st, which is a new position, and we get to test S and T which are very common.

In ""PIANO"", we test P, I, O.

S and T are more common than P, I, O? Actually, S and T are very common.

So ""ALONG"" might be better.

But we also have to consider that we know N is in the 4th, so we are using that.

So I'll go with ""ALONG"".

But wait, in ""ALONG"", we have O and G. We don't know about them.

Alternatively, we can use ""SAINT"": S A I N T -> but the 4th is N? S (1st), A (2nd), I (3rd), N (4th), T (5th). But we know A is not in the 2nd! So we cannot put A in the 2nd. So ""SAINT"" is invalid because it has A in the 2nd.

So we must avoid putting A in the 2nd.

Therefore, ""ALONG"" is good: A in 1st, which is not the 2nd.

Similarly, ""PLANT"" is good: A in 3rd (not 2nd).

But I think ""ALONG"" is a good choice.

So I'll go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and E are not in the word (marked with ""x"").
- A is in the word but not in the 2nd position (marked with ""-"").
- N is in the word and in the correct 4th position (marked with ""✓"").

For the second guess:
- The word must have N in the 4th position.
- A must be included but not in the 2nd position (so positions 1st, 3rd, or 5th are candidates).
- Avoid using C, R, or E.
- Test new common letters to gather more information.

The word ""along"" fits well:
- A is in the 1st position (testing if A is in the 1st position).
- N is in the 4th position (confirmed correct).
- New letters: L, O, G (common consonants and a vowel).
- Avoids C, R, E.

This guess will help narrow down the position of A and test three new letters.

<guess>along</guess>",along,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: ✓ (correct position, so N is the 4th letter)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The 4th letter is N.
- The letter A is in the word, but not in the 2nd position (since we guessed it in the 2nd position and it was marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, R, and E are not in the word.

We also know that the word has 5 letters and is a valid English word.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Has N in the 4th position (since it was correct in the first guess and we know it's fixed there).
- Includes the letter A, but not in the 2nd position (so we can try it in a different position to find the correct one).
- Avoids the letters C, R, E (since they are not in the word).

Additionally, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

Let's think of words that have N in the 4th position and include the letter A.

Possible positions for A: since it's not in the 2nd position, we can try it in the 1st, 3rd, or 5th position.

We also want to use other common consonants that we haven't tried yet. We haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: we should avoid the letters that we know are not in the word: C, R, E.

Let me try to think of words that have the pattern: _ _ _ N _

And include the letter A.

Some possibilities:
- A _ _ N _ : but we know A is not in the 2nd position, so we can try A in the 1st? But we don't know if it's in the 1st or not. We can try.
- Alternatively, we can try A in the 3rd or 5th.

We also want to test other letters to get more information.

Let me list some words that fit:
- ""PLANT"": P L A N T -> but we have A in the 3rd position and N in the 4th. However, we know A is in the word, but we don't know if it's in the 3rd. Also, we haven't used P, L, T.

But note: we have to avoid R, C, E. This word doesn't have those.

Alternatively, we can try ""MANGO"": M A N G O -> but we have A in the 2nd position? But we know A is not in the 2nd position? Wait, no: in the first guess, we had A in the 2nd position and it was marked as wrong position, meaning A is in the word but not in the 2nd. So we cannot put A in the 2nd again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there. We should try A in a different position.

In ""MANGO"", A is in the 2nd position, which we know is wrong. So that would be a waste because we already know A is not in the 2nd.

We need a word that has A in either the 1st, 3rd, or 5th.

Let me think of words with A in the 1st: 
- ""ADORN"": but we have R? We know R is not in the word (from first feedback: R was x). So we cannot use R.

We must avoid R, C, E.

So, words without C, R, E.

With A in the 1st: 
- ""ALIGN"": A L I G N -> but we have N in the 5th? We need N in the 4th. So the pattern is _ _ _ N _ -> so the 4th is N, then the 5th is something.

Actually, in ""ALIGN"", the N is the 5th letter, not the 4th. So that doesn't fit.

We need the 4th to be N.

So, let's think of words with the 4th letter N and the 1st letter A? 
- ""A _ _ N _""

Examples: 
- ""ALIGN"" has N at the end, not the 4th.
- ""ABHOR"" has R and H, but R is not allowed.

We need to avoid R, C, E.

Try A in the 1st: 
- ""ADMIN"": A D M I N -> but the 4th letter is I? No, the 4th is N? Let's see: A (1st), D (2nd), M (3rd), I (4th), N (5th). So the 4th is I, not N. So that doesn't work.

We need the 4th to be N. So the word must be: _ _ _ N _

With A in the 1st: 
- ""A _ _ N _"" -> examples: ""AFTER"" has E and R -> not allowed. 
- ""ALONG"": A L O N G -> this has A in 1st, L in 2nd, O in 3rd, N in 4th, G in 5th. And no R, C, E. So that's a candidate.

But note: we know A is in the word, and we are putting it in the 1st position. If the correct position is not 1st, then we'll get a '-' for A and know it's in the 3rd or 5th.

Alternatively, we can try A in the 3rd position: _ _ A N _

Examples: 
- ""PLANT"": P L A N T -> A is in 3rd, and N in 4th. No R, C, E. So that's a candidate.

Or ""GRANT"": but G R A N T -> has R, which is not allowed.

Another: ""BLAND"": B L A N D -> A in 3rd, N in 4th. No R, C, E. So that's a candidate.

Or ""STAND"": S T A N D -> A in 3rd, N in 4th. But we have S, T, D. However, we don't know if S, T, D are in the word.

But note: we also want to test new letters.

We have two candidates so far: ""ALONG"" and ""PLANT"" and ""BLAND"".

But we also have the option to try A in the 5th position: _ _ _ N A

Examples: 
- ""PIZZA"": but has Z and Z, and we don't know about Z. Also, we have two Z's? But we don't know if Z is in the word. Also, we want to test more common letters.

- ""MANIA"": M A N I A -> but the 4th letter is I? No, the 4th is N? Let's see: M (1st), A (2nd), N (3rd), I (4th), A (5th). So the 4th is I, not N. So that doesn't work.

We need the 4th to be N. So the word must be: _ _ _ N A

Examples: 
- ""URBAN"": U R B A N -> but R is not allowed.
- ""DOGMA"": D O G M A -> 4th is M, not N.

It's hard to find words with the pattern _ _ _ N A without using forbidden letters.

Another: ""PIANO"": P I A N O -> but the 4th is N? Let's see: P (1st), I (2nd), A (3rd), N (4th), O (5th). Yes! So A is in the 3rd and N in the 4th. And we avoid R, C, E.

But note: in ""PIANO"", we have A in the 3rd position. We know A is in the word, but we don't know if it's in the 3rd. We can try.

But wait, we already have two candidates: ""ALONG"" (A in 1st) and ""PIANO"" (A in 3rd). Which one is better?

We also have ""PLANT"" (A in 3rd).

But note: we want to maximize information. We should try to include letters that we haven't tested yet.

In the first guess, we used: C, R, A, N, E. We know C, R, E are absent. So we have tested A and N (with N being correct in the 4th).

Now, we want to test new letters. So ""PIANO"" uses P, I, A, N, O. We already know A and N are in the word (N is fixed). So we are testing P, I, O.

Similarly, ""ALONG"" uses A, L, O, N, G. We know A and N, so testing L, O, G.

But note: in ""ALONG"", we are putting A in the 1st position. If the correct position is not 1st, then we get a '-' for A and know it's in the 3rd or 5th.

In ""PIANO"", we are putting A in the 3rd position. If the correct position is not 3rd, then we get a '-' for A and know it's in the 1st or 5th.

We have two possibilities for A: 1st or 5th? Actually, it could be in the 3rd? But we don't know.

We can also consider words that have A in the 5th: _ _ _ N A

Examples: 
- ""PIZZA"": not good because of Z and we don't know.
- ""JUMNA"": not a word.
- ""TUNNA"": not common.

It's difficult. So let's stick with words that have A in the 1st or 3rd.

Another candidate: ""SALON"": S A L O N -> but the 4th is O? No, the 4th is N? Let's see: S (1st), A (2nd), L (3rd), O (4th), N (5th). So the 4th is O, not N. So no.

We need the 4th to be N. So the word must be: _ _ _ N _

So for A in the 1st: A _ _ N _
For A in the 3rd: _ _ A N _

Let me list more words:

With A in 1st: 
- ""ADMIN"" -> A D M I N -> 4th is I, not N -> invalid pattern.
- ""ADORN"" -> has R and O, but R is not allowed.
- ""AGLOW"": A G L O W -> 4th is O, not N.

Actually, we need the 4th to be N. So the word must have the 4th letter as N.

So for A in 1st: 
- ""A _ _ N _"" -> the 4th is N, then the 5th is something.

Examples: 
- ""ALIGN"" -> A L I G N -> 4th is G, not N -> no.
- ""ATTAIN"" -> too long.

5-letter words: 
- ""AUNTY"": A U N T Y -> but the 3rd is N? Let's see: A (1st), U (2nd), N (3rd), T (4th), Y (5th). So the 4th is T, not N. So no.

We need the 4th to be N. So the word must be: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] N [letter5]

So for A in 1st: 
- ""A _ _ N _""

Examples: 
- ""ADMIN"" -> A D M I N -> but the 4th is I, not N -> invalid.
- ""AFTER"" -> has E and R -> not allowed.

Actually, I can't think of a common word with A in 1st and N in 4th. 

Let me try A in the 3rd: _ _ A N _

Examples: 
- ""BLAND"": B L A N D -> B (1st), L (2nd), A (3rd), N (4th), D (5th). This fits: _ _ A N _ -> with A in 3rd and N in 4th.

Similarly, ""PLANT"": P L A N T -> same pattern.

Or ""GRANT"": but has R -> not allowed.

Or ""STAND"": S T A N D -> S (1st), T (2nd), A (3rd), N (4th), D (5th). No R, C, E.

So ""STAND"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""BLAND"": B L A N D -> same.

Now, for A in the 5th: _ _ _ N A

Examples: 
- ""PIZZA"": P I Z Z A -> 4th is Z, not N -> no.
- ""TUNNA"": not common and 4th is N? T U N N A -> 4th is N, 5th is A. But ""TUNNA"" is not a common word. We need valid words.

""MANIA"": M A N I A -> 4th is I, not N.

""MANNA"": M A N N A -> 4th is N? M (1st), A (2nd), N (3rd), N (4th), A (5th). So the 4th is N? Yes: positions: 1:M, 2:A, 3:N, 4:N, 5:A. So we have N in the 3rd and 4th? But we know N is in the 4th, but we don't know about the 3rd. However, we have two N's? But we don't know if the word has two N's.

But ""MANNA"" is a word (a type of fruit). But let's see: we are testing M, A, N, N, A. We know A and N are in the word. So we are testing M and the second N (which might be redundant if the word has only one N? But we don't know).

Alternatively, ""PIANO"" is a good candidate: P I A N O -> 1:P, 2:I, 3:A, 4:N, 5:O.

This has A in the 3rd and N in the 4th. We know A is in the word but not in the 2nd, so we are trying it in the 3rd. We also test P, I, O.

Similarly, ""PIANO"" is a valid word.

Another candidate: ""PLAIN"": P L A I N -> but the 4th is I, not N -> no.

""TRAIN"": has R -> not allowed.

""PLAIN"": P L A I N -> 4th is I, not N.

So ""PIANO"" is a good candidate.

But note: we have to avoid using letters we know are absent. We know C, R, E are absent. P, I, O are new.

We can also consider ""SALON"", but that doesn't fit because the 4th is O.

Another word: ""BANJO"": B A N J O -> but the 3rd is N, 4th is O -> no.

I think ""PIANO"" is a good choice because:
- It has A in the 3rd position (so we can check if A is in the 3rd or not).
- It has N in the 4th (which we know is correct, so we can confirm and also test other letters).

But note: we already know N is in the 4th, so we will get a check for N again? Yes, because it's in the same position. But that's okay because it confirms the position and we get to test other letters.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't repeat N? But we don't have to, because we know N is fixed in the 4th.

But to test more letters, we might want to avoid repeating N? Or we can use it to get more information about the other positions.

Since we have limited guesses, we want to maximize information. So it's better to use a word that has new letters and doesn't repeat the ones we know are absent, and also doesn't repeat N in a way that we can get new information? Actually, repeating N in the 4th is okay because we know it's correct, but we are using the same position again. The new information will be in the other positions.

But we are required to have N in the 4th.

So let's choose between ""ALONG"", ""PLANT"", ""STAND"", and ""PIANO"".

We can also consider ""DAUNT"": D A U N T -> but the 4th is N? D (1st), A (2nd), U (3rd), N (4th), T (5th). But we know A is not in the 2nd (from first feedback). So we cannot put A in the 2nd again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting A in the 2nd.

In ""DAUNT"", A is in the 2nd, which we know is wrong. So that would be a waste.

Similarly, in ""PIANO"", A is in the 3rd, which is new.

In ""ALONG"", A is in the 1st, which is new.

In ""PLANT"", A is in the 3rd, same as PIANO.

But ""PIANO"" has the advantage of having three new vowels (I and O) and a consonant (P).

Alternatively, we can use a word that has A in the 5th? But we couldn't find a common one without forbidden letters.

Another word: ""LAMIN"": not common.

""MANIA"": not because 4th is I.

I think ""PIANO"" is a good choice.

But let me check if there's a word that has A in the 5th: 
- ""DELTA"": but has E and R -> not allowed.
- ""BETTA"": has E -> not allowed.
- ""LYTTA"": not common.

So maybe ""PIANO"" is a good option.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know.

I think we should go with ""PIANO"".

So my second guess: PIANO

But let me confirm: 
- P: new
- I: new
- A: we know it's in the word, but we are trying it in the 3rd
- N: we know is in the 4th, so we expect a check for N.
- O: new

We avoid C, R, E.

So, let's go with ""PIANO"".

But wait, what if the word has A in the 1st? Then in ""PIANO"", A is in the 3rd and we get a '-' for A. Then we know A is in the 1st or 5th. And we get information about P, I, O.

If the word has A in the 3rd, then we get a check for A? But we don't know if A is in the 3rd or not.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in the 1st to test that possibility.

For example, ""ALONG"": A L O N G -> A in 1st, L in 2nd, O in 3rd, N in 4th, G in 5th.

This tests A in the 1st, and we test L, O, G.

We know A is in the word, so if we put it in the 1st, we might get:
- If A is in the 1st, then we get a check for A.
- If not, then we get a '-' for A (meaning it's in the 3rd or 5th) and we know.

Also, we test L, O, G.

Similarly, ""PLANT"": P L A N T -> A in 3rd.

I think both are good. But ""ALONG"" tests A in the 1st, which we haven't tested, while ""PIANO"" tests A in the 3rd.

Since we know A is not in the 2nd, we have two possibilities: 1st or 5th. So testing A in the 1st will help us narrow it down.

Therefore, I choose ""ALONG"".

But wait, in ""ALONG"", we have A in the 1st and we know A is in the word. So if the correct position is 1st, we get a check. If not, we get a '-' and know it's in the 5th.

Also, we test L, O, G.

Alternatively, we can use ""STAND"": S T A N D -> A in 3rd.

But I think testing A in the 1st is a good idea.

So I'll go with ""ALONG"".

But let me see if there's a word that has A in the 5th and doesn't use forbidden letters. After some thought, I found ""PENNA"": P E N N A -> but E is not allowed (we know E is absent). So invalid.

""JUNNA"": not common.

So ""ALONG"" seems good.

But note: we have to make sure the word is valid. ""ALONG"" is a valid word.

So second guess: ALONG

But let me compare with ""PIANO"". Both are valid.

I think ""ALONG"" is better because it tests A in the 1st, which is a new position, and we get to test S and T which are very common.

In ""PIANO"", we test P, I, O.

S and T are more common than P, I, O? Actually, S and T are very common.

So ""ALONG"" might be better.

But we also have to consider that we know N is in the 4th, so we are using that.

So I'll go with ""ALONG"".

But wait, in ""ALONG"", we have O and G. We don't know about them.

Alternatively, we can use ""SAINT"": S A I N T -> but the 4th is N? S (1st), A (2nd), I (3rd), N (4th), T (5th). But we know A is not in the 2nd! So we cannot put A in the 2nd. So ""SAINT"" is invalid because it has A in the 2nd.

So we must avoid putting A in the 2nd.

Therefore, ""ALONG"" is good: A in 1st, which is not the 2nd.

Similarly, ""PLANT"" is good: A in 3rd (not 2nd).

But I think ""ALONG"" is a good choice.

So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and E are not in the word (marked with ""x"").
- A is in the word but not in the 2nd position (marked with ""-"").
- N is in the word and in the correct 4th position (marked with ""✓"").

For the second guess:
- The word must have N in the 4th position.
- A must be included but not in the 2nd position (so positions 1st, 3rd, or 5th are candidates).
- Avoid using C, R, or E.
- Test new common letters to gather more information.

The word ""along"" fits well:
- A is in the 1st position (testing if A is in the 1st position).
- N is in the 4th position (confirmed correct).
- New letters: L, O, G (common consonants and a vowel).
- Avoids C, R, E.

This guess will help narrow down the position of A and test three new letters.",Guess 2: along -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(x) O(x) N(✓) G(✓),FAIL

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 04 Sep 2025

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(✓) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: ✓ (correct position, so N is the 4th letter)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The 4th letter is N.
- The letter A is in the word, but not in the 2nd position (since we guessed it in the 2nd position and it was marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, R, and E are not in the word.

We also know that the word has 5 letters and is a valid English word.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Has N in the 4th position (since it was correct in the first guess and we know it's fixed there).
- Includes the letter A, but not in the 2nd position (so we can try it in a different position to find the correct one).
- Avoids the letters C, R, E (since they are not in the word).

Additionally, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

Let's think of words that have N in the 4th position and include the letter A.

Possible positions for A: since it's not in the 2nd position, we can try it in the 1st, 3rd, or 5th position.

We also want to use other common consonants that we haven't tried yet. We haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: we should avoid the letters that we know are not in the word: C, R, E.

Let me try to think of words that have the pattern: _ _ _ N _

And include the letter A.

Some possibilities:
- A _ _ N _ : but we know A is not in the 2nd position, so we can try A in the 1st? But we don't know if it's in the 1st or not. We can try.
- Alternatively, we can try A in the 3rd or 5th.

We also want to test other letters to get more information.

Let me list some words that fit:
- ""PLANT"": P L A N T -> but we have A in the 3rd position and N in the 4th. However, we know A is in the word, but we don't know if it's in the 3rd. Also, we haven't used P, L, T.

But note: we have to avoid R, C, E. This word doesn't have those.

Alternatively, we can try ""MANGO"": M A N G O -> but we have A in the 2nd position? But we know A is not in the 2nd position? Wait, no: in the first guess, we had A in the 2nd position and it was marked as wrong position, meaning A is in the word but not in the 2nd. So we cannot put A in the 2nd again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there. We should try A in a different position.

In ""MANGO"", A is in the 2nd position, which we know is wrong. So that would be a waste because we already know A is not in the 2nd.

We need a word that has A in either the 1st, 3rd, or 5th.

Let me think of words with A in the 1st: 
- ""ADORN"": but we have R? We know R is not in the word (from first feedback: R was x). So we cannot use R.

We must avoid R, C, E.

So, words without C, R, E.

With A in the 1st: 
- ""ALIGN"": A L I G N -> but we have N in the 5th? We need N in the 4th. So the pattern is _ _ _ N _ -> so the 4th is N, then the 5th is something.

Actually, in ""ALIGN"", the N is the 5th letter, not the 4th. So that doesn't fit.

We need the 4th to be N.

So, let's think of words with the 4th letter N and the 1st letter A? 
- ""A _ _ N _""

Examples: 
- ""ALIGN"" has N at the end, not the 4th.
- ""ABHOR"" has R and H, but R is not allowed.

We need to avoid R, C, E.

Try A in the 1st: 
- ""ADMIN"": A D M I N -> but the 4th letter is I? No, the 4th is N? Let's see: A (1st), D (2nd), M (3rd), I (4th), N (5th). So the 4th is I, not N. So that doesn't work.

We need the 4th to be N. So the word must be: _ _ _ N _

With A in the 1st: 
- ""A _ _ N _"" -> examples: ""AFTER"" has E and R -> not allowed. 
- ""ALONG"": A L O N G -> this has A in 1st, L in 2nd, O in 3rd, N in 4th, G in 5th. And no R, C, E. So that's a candidate.

But note: we know A is in the word, and we are putting it in the 1st position. If the correct position is not 1st, then we'll get a '-' for A and know it's in the 3rd or 5th.

Alternatively, we can try A in the 3rd position: _ _ A N _

Examples: 
- ""PLANT"": P L A N T -> A is in 3rd, and N in 4th. No R, C, E. So that's a candidate.

Or ""GRANT"": but G R A N T -> has R, which is not allowed.

Another: ""BLAND"": B L A N D -> A in 3rd, N in 4th. No R, C, E. So that's a candidate.

Or ""STAND"": S T A N D -> A in 3rd, N in 4th. But we have S, T, D. However, we don't know if S, T, D are in the word.

But note: we also want to test new letters.

We have two candidates so far: ""ALONG"" and ""PLANT"" and ""BLAND"".

But we also have the option to try A in the 5th position: _ _ _ N A

Examples: 
- ""PIZZA"": but has Z and Z, and we don't know about Z. Also, we have two Z's? But we don't know if Z is in the word. Also, we want to test more common letters.

- ""MANIA"": M A N I A -> but the 4th letter is I? No, the 4th is N? Let's see: M (1st), A (2nd), N (3rd), I (4th), A (5th). So the 4th is I, not N. So that doesn't work.

We need the 4th to be N. So the word must be: _ _ _ N A

Examples: 
- ""URBAN"": U R B A N -> but R is not allowed.
- ""DOGMA"": D O G M A -> 4th is M, not N.

It's hard to find words with the pattern _ _ _ N A without using forbidden letters.

Another: ""PIANO"": P I A N O -> but the 4th is N? Let's see: P (1st), I (2nd), A (3rd), N (4th), O (5th). Yes! So A is in the 3rd and N in the 4th. And we avoid R, C, E.

But note: in ""PIANO"", we have A in the 3rd position. We know A is in the word, but we don't know if it's in the 3rd. We can try.

But wait, we already have two candidates: ""ALONG"" (A in 1st) and ""PIANO"" (A in 3rd). Which one is better?

We also have ""PLANT"" (A in 3rd).

But note: we want to maximize information. We should try to include letters that we haven't tested yet.

In the first guess, we used: C, R, A, N, E. We know C, R, E are absent. So we have tested A and N (with N being correct in the 4th).

Now, we want to test new letters. So ""PIANO"" uses P, I, A, N, O. We already know A and N are in the word (N is fixed). So we are testing P, I, O.

Similarly, ""ALONG"" uses A, L, O, N, G. We know A and N, so testing L, O, G.

But note: in ""ALONG"", we are putting A in the 1st position. If the correct position is not 1st, then we get a '-' for A and know it's in the 3rd or 5th.

In ""PIANO"", we are putting A in the 3rd position. If the correct position is not 3rd, then we get a '-' for A and know it's in the 1st or 5th.

We have two possibilities for A: 1st or 5th? Actually, it could be in the 3rd? But we don't know.

We can also consider words that have A in the 5th: _ _ _ N A

Examples: 
- ""PIZZA"": not good because of Z and we don't know.
- ""JUMNA"": not a word.
- ""TUNNA"": not common.

It's difficult. So let's stick with words that have A in the 1st or 3rd.

Another candidate: ""SALON"": S A L O N -> but the 4th is O? No, the 4th is N? Let's see: S (1st), A (2nd), L (3rd), O (4th), N (5th). So the 4th is O, not N. So no.

We need the 4th to be N. So the word must be: _ _ _ N _

So for A in the 1st: A _ _ N _
For A in the 3rd: _ _ A N _

Let me list more words:

With A in 1st: 
- ""ADMIN"" -> A D M I N -> 4th is I, not N -> invalid pattern.
- ""ADORN"" -> has R and O, but R is not allowed.
- ""AGLOW"": A G L O W -> 4th is O, not N.

Actually, we need the 4th to be N. So the word must have the 4th letter as N.

So for A in 1st: 
- ""A _ _ N _"" -> the 4th is N, then the 5th is something.

Examples: 
- ""ALIGN"" -> A L I G N -> 4th is G, not N -> no.
- ""ATTAIN"" -> too long.

5-letter words: 
- ""AUNTY"": A U N T Y -> but the 3rd is N? Let's see: A (1st), U (2nd), N (3rd), T (4th), Y (5th). So the 4th is T, not N. So no.

We need the 4th to be N. So the word must be: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] N [letter5]

So for A in 1st: 
- ""A _ _ N _""

Examples: 
- ""ADMIN"" -> A D M I N -> but the 4th is I, not N -> invalid.
- ""AFTER"" -> has E and R -> not allowed.

Actually, I can't think of a common word with A in 1st and N in 4th. 

Let me try A in the 3rd: _ _ A N _

Examples: 
- ""BLAND"": B L A N D -> B (1st), L (2nd), A (3rd), N (4th), D (5th). This fits: _ _ A N _ -> with A in 3rd and N in 4th.

Similarly, ""PLANT"": P L A N T -> same pattern.

Or ""GRANT"": but has R -> not allowed.

Or ""STAND"": S T A N D -> S (1st), T (2nd), A (3rd), N (4th), D (5th). No R, C, E.

So ""STAND"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""BLAND"": B L A N D -> same.

Now, for A in the 5th: _ _ _ N A

Examples: 
- ""PIZZA"": P I Z Z A -> 4th is Z, not N -> no.
- ""TUNNA"": not common and 4th is N? T U N N A -> 4th is N, 5th is A. But ""TUNNA"" is not a common word. We need valid words.

""MANIA"": M A N I A -> 4th is I, not N.

""MANNA"": M A N N A -> 4th is N? M (1st), A (2nd), N (3rd), N (4th), A (5th). So the 4th is N? Yes: positions: 1:M, 2:A, 3:N, 4:N, 5:A. So we have N in the 3rd and 4th? But we know N is in the 4th, but we don't know about the 3rd. However, we have two N's? But we don't know if the word has two N's.

But ""MANNA"" is a word (a type of fruit). But let's see: we are testing M, A, N, N, A. We know A and N are in the word. So we are testing M and the second N (which might be redundant if the word has only one N? But we don't know).

Alternatively, ""PIANO"" is a good candidate: P I A N O -> 1:P, 2:I, 3:A, 4:N, 5:O.

This has A in the 3rd and N in the 4th. We know A is in the word but not in the 2nd, so we are trying it in the 3rd. We also test P, I, O.

Similarly, ""PIANO"" is a valid word.

Another candidate: ""PLAIN"": P L A I N -> but the 4th is I, not N -> no.

""TRAIN"": has R -> not allowed.

""PLAIN"": P L A I N -> 4th is I, not N.

So ""PIANO"" is a good candidate.

But note: we have to avoid using letters we know are absent. We know C, R, E are absent. P, I, O are new.

We can also consider ""SALON"", but that doesn't fit because the 4th is O.

Another word: ""BANJO"": B A N J O -> but the 3rd is N, 4th is O -> no.

I think ""PIANO"" is a good choice because:
- It has A in the 3rd position (so we can check if A is in the 3rd or not).
- It has N in the 4th (which we know is correct, so we can confirm and also test other letters).

But note: we already know N is in the 4th, so we will get a check for N again? Yes, because it's in the same position. But that's okay because it confirms the position and we get to test other letters.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't repeat N? But we don't have to, because we know N is fixed in the 4th.

But to test more letters, we might want to avoid repeating N? Or we can use it to get more information about the other positions.

Since we have limited guesses, we want to maximize information. So it's better to use a word that has new letters and doesn't repeat the ones we know are absent, and also doesn't repeat N in a way that we can get new information? Actually, repeating N in the 4th is okay because we know it's correct, but we are using the same position again. The new information will be in the other positions.

But we are required to have N in the 4th.

So let's choose between ""ALONG"", ""PLANT"", ""STAND"", and ""PIANO"".

We can also consider ""DAUNT"": D A U N T -> but the 4th is N? D (1st), A (2nd), U (3rd), N (4th), T (5th). But we know A is not in the 2nd (from first feedback). So we cannot put A in the 2nd again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting A in the 2nd.

In ""DAUNT"", A is in the 2nd, which we know is wrong. So that would be a waste.

Similarly, in ""PIANO"", A is in the 3rd, which is new.

In ""ALONG"", A is in the 1st, which is new.

In ""PLANT"", A is in the 3rd, same as PIANO.

But ""PIANO"" has the advantage of having three new vowels (I and O) and a consonant (P).

Alternatively, we can use a word that has A in the 5th? But we couldn't find a common one without forbidden letters.

Another word: ""LAMIN"": not common.

""MANIA"": not because 4th is I.

I think ""PIANO"" is a good choice.

But let me check if there's a word that has A in the 5th: 
- ""DELTA"": but has E and R -> not allowed.
- ""BETTA"": has E -> not allowed.
- ""LYTTA"": not common.

So maybe ""PIANO"" is a good option.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know.

I think we should go with ""PIANO"".

So my second guess: PIANO

But let me confirm: 
- P: new
- I: new
- A: we know it's in the word, but we are trying it in the 3rd
- N: we know is in the 4th, so we expect a check for N.
- O: new

We avoid C, R, E.

So, let's go with ""PIANO"".

But wait, what if the word has A in the 1st? Then in ""PIANO"", A is in the 3rd and we get a '-' for A. Then we know A is in the 1st or 5th. And we get information about P, I, O.

If the word has A in the 3rd, then we get a check for A? But we don't know if A is in the 3rd or not.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in the 1st to test that possibility.

For example, ""ALONG"": A L O N G -> A in 1st, L in 2nd, O in 3rd, N in 4th, G in 5th.

This tests A in the 1st, and we test L, O, G.

We know A is in the word, so if we put it in the 1st, we might get:
- If A is in the 1st, then we get a check for A.
- If not, then we get a '-' for A (meaning it's in the 3rd or 5th) and we know.

Also, we test L, O, G.

Similarly, ""PLANT"": P L A N T -> A in 3rd.

I think both are good. But ""ALONG"" tests A in the 1st, which we haven't tested, while ""PIANO"" tests A in the 3rd.

Since we know A is not in the 2nd, we have two possibilities: 1st or 5th. So testing A in the 1st will help us narrow it down.

Therefore, I choose ""ALONG"".

But wait, in ""ALONG"", we have A in the 1st and we know A is in the word. So if the correct position is 1st, we get a check. If not, we get a '-' and know it's in the 5th.

Also, we test L, O, G.

Alternatively, we can use ""STAND"": S T A N D -> A in 3rd.

But I think testing A in the 1st is a good idea.

So I'll go with ""ALONG"".

But let me see if there's a word that has A in the 5th and doesn't use forbidden letters. After some thought, I found ""PENNA"": P E N N A -> but E is not allowed (we know E is absent). So invalid.

""JUNNA"": not common.

So ""ALONG"" seems good.

But note: we have to make sure the word is valid. ""ALONG"" is a valid word.

So second guess: ALONG

But let me compare with ""PIANO"". Both are valid.

I think ""ALONG"" is better because it tests A in the 1st, which is a new position, and we get to test S and T which are very common.

In ""PIANO"", we test P, I, O.

S and T are more common than P, I, O? Actually, S and T are very common.

So ""ALONG"" might be better.

But we also have to consider that we know N is in the 4th, so we are using that.

So I'll go with ""ALONG"".

But wait, in ""ALONG"", we have O and G. We don't know about them.

Alternatively, we can use ""SAINT"": S A I N T -> but the 4th is N? S (1st), A (2nd), I (3rd), N (4th), T (5th). But we know A is not in the 2nd! So we cannot put A in the 2nd. So ""SAINT"" is invalid because it has A in the 2nd.

So we must avoid putting A in the 2nd.

Therefore, ""ALONG"" is good: A in 1st, which is not the 2nd.

Similarly, ""PLANT"" is good: A in 3rd (not 2nd).

But I think ""ALONG"" is a good choice.

So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and E are not in the word (marked with ""x"").
- A is in the word but not in the 2nd position (marked with ""-"").
- N is in the word and in the correct 4th position (marked with ""✓"").

For the second guess:
- The word must have N in the 4th position.
- A must be included but not in the 2nd position (so positions 1st, 3rd, or 5th are candidates).
- Avoid using C, R, or E.
- Test new common letters to gather more information.

The word ""along"" fits well:
- A is in the 1st position (testing if A is in the 1st position).
- N is in the 4th position (confirmed correct).
- New letters: L, O, G (common consonants and a vowel).
- Avoids C, R, E.

This guess will help narrow down the position of A and test three new letters.

No R, C, E.\n\nSo ""STAND"" is a candidate.\n\nSimilarly, ""BLAND"": B L A N D -> same.\n\nNow, for A in the 5th: _ _ _ N A\n\nExamples: \n- ""PIZZA"": P I Z Z A -> 4th is Z, not N -> no.\n- ""TUNNA"": not common and 4th is N? T U N N A -> 4th is N, 5th is A. But ""TUNNA"" is not a common word. We need valid words.\n\n""MANIA"": M A N I A -> 4th is I, not N.\n\n""MANNA"": M A N N A -> 4th is N? M (1st), A (2nd), N (3rd), N (4th), A (5th). So the 4th is N? Yes: positions: 1:M, 2:A, 3:N, 4:N, 5:A. So we have N in the 3rd and 4th? But we know N is in the 4th, but we don\'t know about the 3rd. However, we have two N\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has two N\'s.\n\nBut ""MANNA"" is a word (a type of fruit). But let\'s see: we are testing M, A, N, N, A. We know A and N are in the word. So we are testing M and the second N (which might be redundant if the word has only one N? But we don\'t know).\n\nAlternatively, ""PIANO"" is a good candidate: P I A N O -> 1:P, 2:I, 3:A, 4:N, 5:O.\n\nThis has A in the 3rd and N in the 4th. We know A is in the word but not in the 2nd, so we are trying it in the 3rd. We also test P, I, O.\n\nSimilarly, ""PIANO"" is a valid word.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PLAIN"": P L A I N -> but the 4th is I, not N -> no.\n\n""TRAIN"": has R -> not allowed.\n\n""PLAIN"": P L A I N -> 4th is I, not N.\n\nSo ""PIANO"" is a good candidate.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid using letters we know are absent. We know C, R, E are absent. P, I, O are new.\n\nWe can also consider ""SALON"", but that doesn\'t fit because the 4th is O.\n\nAnother word: ""BANJO"": B A N J O -> but the 3rd is N, 4th is O -> no.\n\nI think ""PIANO"" is a good choice because:\n- It has A in the 3rd position (so we can check if A is in the 3rd or not).\n- It has N in the 4th (which we know is correct, so we can confirm and also test other letters).\n\nBut note: we already know N is in the 4th, so we will get a check for N again? Yes, because it\'s in the same position. But that\'s okay because it confirms the position and we get to test other letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t repeat N? But we don\'t have to, because we know N is fixed in the 4th.\n\nBut to test more letters, we might want to avoid repeating N? Or we can use it to get more information about the other positions.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, we want to maximize information. So it\'s better to use a word that has new letters and doesn\'t repeat the ones we know are absent, and also doesn\'t repeat N in a way that we can get new information? Actually, repeating N in the 4th is okay because we know it\'s correct, but we are using the same position again. The new information will be in the other positions.\n\nBut we are required to have N in the 4th.\n\nSo let\'s choose between ""ALONG"", ""PLANT"", ""STAND"", and ""PIANO"".\n\nWe can also consider ""DAUNT"": D A U N T -> but the 4th is N? D (1st), A (2nd), U (3rd), N (4th), T (5th). But we know A is not in the 2nd (from first feedback). So we cannot put A in the 2nd again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it\'s not there. So we should avoid putting A in the 2nd.\n\nIn ""DAUNT"", A is in the 2nd, which we know is wrong. So that would be a waste.\n\nSimilarly, in ""PIANO"", A is in the 3rd, which is new.\n\nIn ""ALONG"", A is in the 1st, which is new.\n\nIn ""PLANT"", A is in the 3rd, same as PIANO.\n\nBut ""PIANO"" has the advantage of having three new vowels (I and O) and a consonant (P).\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that has A in the 5th? But we couldn\'t find a common one without forbidden letters.\n\nAnother word: ""LAMIN"": not common.\n\n""MANIA"": not because 4th is I.\n\nI think ""PIANO"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me check if there\'s a word that has A in the 5th: \n- ""DELTA"": but has E and R -> not allowed.\n- ""BETTA"": has E -> not allowed.\n- ""LYTTA"": not common.\n\nSo maybe ""PIANO"" is a good option.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know.\n\nI think we should go with ""PIANO"".\n\nSo my second guess: PIANO\n\nBut let me confirm: \n- P: new\n- I: new\n- A: we know it\'s in the word, but we are trying it in the 3rd\n- N: we know is in the 4th, so we expect a check for N.\n- O: new\n\nWe avoid C, R, E.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""PIANO"".\n\nBut wait, what if the word has A in the 1st? Then in ""PIANO"", A is in the 3rd and we get a \'-\' for A. Then we know A is in the 1st or 5th. And we get information about P, I, O.\n\nIf the word has A in the 3rd, then we get a check for A? But we don\'t know if A is in the 3rd or not.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has A in the 1st to test that possibility.\n\nFor example, ""ALONG"": A L O N G -> A in 1st, L in 2nd, O in 3rd, N in 4th, G in 5th.\n\nThis tests A in the 1st, and we test L, O, G.\n\nWe know A is in the word, so if we put it in the 1st, we might get:\n- If A is in the 1st, then we get a check for A.\n- If not, then we get a \'-\' for A (meaning it\'s in the 3rd or 5th) and we know.\n\nAlso, we test L, O, G.\n\nSimilarly, ""PLANT"": P L A N T -> A in 3rd.\n\nI think both are good. But ""ALONG"" tests A in the 1st, which we haven\'t tested, while ""PIANO"" tests A in the 3rd.\n\nSince we know A is not in the 2nd, we have two possibilities: 1st or 5th. So testing A in the 1st will help us narrow it down.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""ALONG"".\n\nBut wait, in ""ALONG"", we have A in the 1st and we know A is in the word. So if the correct position is 1st, we get a check. If not, we get a \'-\' and know it\'s in the 5th.\n\nAlso, we test L, O, G.\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""STAND"": S T A N D -> A in 3rd.\n\nBut I think testing A in the 1st is a good idea.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""ALONG"".\n\nBut let me see if there\'s a word that has A in the 5th and doesn\'t use forbidden letters. After some thought, I found ""PENNA"": P E N N A -> but E is not allowed (we know E is absent). So invalid.\n\n""JUNNA"": not common.\n\nSo ""ALONG"" seems good.\n\nBut note: we have to make sure the word is valid. ""ALONG"" is a valid word.\n\nSo second guess: ALONG\n\nBut let me compare with ""PIANO"". Both are valid.\n\nI think ""ALONG"" is better because it tests A in the 1st, which is a new position, and we get to test S and T which are very common.\n\nIn ""PIANO"", we test P, I, O.\n\nS and T are more common than P, I, O? Actually, S and T are very common.\n\nSo ""ALONG"" might be better.\n\nBut we also have to consider that we know N is in the 4th, so we are using that.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""ALONG"".\n\nBut wait, in ""ALONG"", we have O and G. We don\'t know about them.\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""SAINT"": S A I N T -> but the 4th is N? S (1st), A (2nd), I (3rd), N (4th), T (5th). But we know A is not in the 2nd! So we cannot put A in the 2nd. So ""SAINT"" is invalid because it has A in the 2nd.\n\nSo we must avoid putting A in the 2nd.\n\nTherefore, ""ALONG"" is good: A in 1st, which is not the 2nd.\n\nSimilarly, ""PLANT"" is good: A in 3rd (not 2nd).\n\nBut I think ""ALONG"" is a good choice.\n\nSo I\'ll go with that.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, and E are not in the word (marked with ""x"").\n- A is in the word but not in the 2nd position (marked with ""-"").\n- N is in the word and in the correct 4th position (marked with ""✓"").\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must have N in the 4th position.\n- A must be included but not in the 2nd position (so positions 1st, 3rd, or 5th are candidates).\n- Avoid using C, R, or E.\n- Test new common letters to gather more information.\n\nThe word ""along"" fits well:\n- A is in the 1st position (testing if A is in the 1st position).\n- N is in the 4th position (confirmed correct).\n- New letters: L, O, G (common consonants and a vowel).\n- Avoids C, R, E.\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the position of A and test three new letters.\n\n<guess>along</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: along -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(x) O(x) N(✓) G(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- N: ✓ (correct, in position 4)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""along""
- A: ✓ (correct, in position 1)
- L: x (not in the word)
- O: x (not in the word)
- N: ✓ (correct, in position 4)
- G: ✓ (correct, in position 5)

So, from this, we know:

1. The first letter is A (from ""along"" feedback: A✓).
2. The fifth letter is G (from ""along"" feedback: G✓).
3. The fourth letter is N (from both guesses).
4. The letter A is in the word, and we now know it's in position 1. Also, we know from the first guess that A is not in position 2 (which we already used to our advantage).
5. The following letters are not in the word: C, R, E, L, O.

Also, from the first guess, we had A in the word but not in position 2, and now we know it's in position 1.

So the current known information:
- Position 1: A
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: G
- The word is: A _ _ N G

We need to find the second and third letters.

We know the following letters are not in the word: C, R, E, L, O.

We have to choose a word that fits the pattern A _ _ N G and uses letters that are not excluded.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Possible letters for the second and third positions: we have to avoid C, R, E, L, O. So available letters: B, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want to maximize information. Since we have two positions to guess, we can try to use common letters that we haven't tested yet.

In the first guess, we tested: C, R, A, N, E.
In the second guess, we tested: A, L, O, N, G.

So we have tested: A, C, E, L, N, O, R, G. But note:
- A, N, G are in the word (A in pos1, N in pos4, G in pos5).
- C, E, L, O, R are not in the word.

Therefore, the remaining letters to test are: B, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word: A _ _ N G

We can try to think of common words that fit this pattern.

Common words: 
- ""AFTER"": but E and R are not allowed (R was already excluded in guess1, and E in guess1).
- ""ALONG"": we already tried, and it had O and L which are now excluded.
- ""AMONG"": A M O N G -> but O is excluded (from guess2: O x). So not allowed.
- ""ASONG"": not a common word? And S is available, but let's see.
- ""ATONG"": not a word.
- ""AWING"": but the pattern is A _ _ N G, so the last letter must be G, not ""WING"". ""AWING"" ends with G? A W I N G -> positions: 1:A, 2:W, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> that fits. And W and I are not excluded.

But is ""AWING"" a word? Yes, meaning a type of bird or a verb meaning lifting device.

But we have to check if W and I are allowed. We haven't tested them, and they are not in the excluded list.

Excluded: C, R, E, L, O.

So W and I are free.

Another possibility: ""AUNGY""? Not a word.

""ABING"": A B I N G -> B and I are available. ""ABING"" is a word? It might be a surname or not common. Let me think of common words.

""ADING"": not a word.

""AFUNG"": not a word.

""AGUNG"": not common.

""AHING"": not a word.

""AIING"": not a word.

""ALING"": not a word.

""AMING"": not a word.

""APING"": not a word.

""ARING"": has R -> not allowed.

""ASHING"": too long.

""ATING"": not a word.

""AVIARY"": too long.

""AWING"" is a word.

Another common word: ""ASKEW"": but the pattern is A _ _ N G, so it must end with G. ""ASKEW"" ends with W, not G.

""ASKED"": has E and D? But E is excluded.

""ASSAY"": has S and S, but pattern: A S S A Y -> not matching.

We need the pattern: A _ _ N G.

Another word: ""ATOMS"": has O and M, but O is excluded, and it ends with S, not G.

""AVOID"": has O and I, but O is excluded, and it doesn't end with G.

""AWAKE"": has E and K, but E is excluded.

""AWARD"": has R and D, but R is excluded.

""AXING"": A X I N G -> X and I are available. ""AXING"" is a word (meaning to extract oil from ground).

But X is not very common.

""AZING"": not a word.

""ABACU"": not matching.

""ABYSS"": not matching.

""ADAPT"": has D and P, but pattern: A D A P T -> doesn't match because we need N in the 4th and G in the 5th.

We need the 4th to be N and 5th to be G.

So the word must end with ""NG"" after the third letter? No: the pattern is A _ _ N G, so the last two letters are ""NG"", with the 4th as N and 5th as G.

So the word is A ? ? N G.

Now, ""AWING"" is A W I N G -> positions: 1:A, 2:W, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> fits.

Also, ""AXING"": A X I N G -> fits.

But ""AWING"" is more common? Or ""AXING"".

We can also consider ""AMONG"" but O is excluded.

Another: ""ALONG"" we tried.

What about ""AUNGY""? Not a word.

""ABHNG""? Not a word.

""ADHNG""? Not a word.

""AFNG""? Not a word.

""AGNG""? Not a word.

""AING""? Not a word.

""ALNG""? Not a word.

""AMNG""? Not a word.

""APNG""? Not a word.

""ARNG""? Has R -> not allowed.

""ASNG""? Not a word.

""ATNG""? Not a word.

""AVNG""? Not a word.

""AWNG""? Not a word.

""AXNG""? Not a word.

""AZNG""? Not a word.

So ""AWING"" and ""AXING"" are candidates.

But ""AXING"" might be less common.

Another possibility: ""AHING"": not a word.

""AKING"": not a word.

""ALING"": not a word.

""AMING"": not a word.

""APING"": not a word.

""ARING"": has R -> not allowed.

""ASHING"": too long.

""AToning"": too long.

We might have to consider that the word might be ""AWING"" or ""AXING"", or perhaps I missed a word.

What about ""AUNGY""? Not standard.

Or ""ABYSS"" but doesn't fit.

Another idea: ""ATOMS"" doesn't end with G.

""AVOID"" doesn't end with G.

""AXIOM"": has O and M, but O is excluded, and pattern: A X I O M -> doesn't end with G.

We need the last two to be ""NG"", with N at 4 and G at 5.

So the word is A ? ? N G.

Common words: 
- ""AWING"" (as above)
- ""AXING"" (as above)
- ""ADWING"": A D W I N G -> but that's 6 letters? No, ""ADWING"" is 6 letters. We need 5 letters.

""ADWING"" is 6 letters. So no.

""ABHING"": not 5 letters.

""ABYING"": not common, and byings are 5? A B Y I N G -> 6 letters.

""ABYSS"" doesn't fit.

""ACING"": has C -> excluded.

""ADZING"": not a word.

""AFRIT"": has R and F, but R excluded.

I think ""AWING"" and ""AXING"" are the main options.

But ""AXING"" might be considered a verb, but ""AWING"" is more common.

Another word: ""AERIE"" has E and doesn't end with G.

""AGAPE"" has E and doesn't end with G.

We might have to consider that the word is ""AWING"" or ""AXING"", or perhaps I missed ""AMONG"" but O is excluded.

What about ""ALONG""? We tried and it had O and L which are excluded.

So the only common words I can think of are ""AWING"" and ""AXING"".

But let me confirm: 
- ""AWING"": A, W, I, N, G -> positions: 1:A, 2:W, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> fits the pattern.

""AXING"": A, X, I, N, G -> same pattern.

We also have ""AUNGY"" but not standard.

Or ""ABHNG"" no.

So between ""AWING"" and ""AXING"", which one to choose?

We want to test letters that are common. W, I, X.

I is a vowel, and W is a consonant. X is less common.

We might also consider that we have two positions to fill: 2nd and 3rd.

We can choose a word that uses two new letters to test both at once.

But we have to make a guess that might be the word.

Since we have two possibilities, we can choose one.

But note: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 3. So we can try one.

Alternatively, we can think of other words that fit the pattern.

What about ""AHING""? Not a word.

""AKING"": not a word.

""ALING"": not a word.

""AMING"": not a word.

""APING"": not a word.

""ARING"": has R -> not allowed.

""ASHING"": too long.

""ATING"": not a word.

""AVING"": not a word.

""AWING"" and ""AXING"" are the only common ones.

But there's also ""ABHNG"" no.

Another: ""ADZING"": not a word.

""AEING"": not a word, and has E.

""AGREE"": has E and doesn't end with G.

I think we have to choose between ""AWING"" and ""AXING"".

But let me check: ""AWING"" is a valid word, and ""AXING"" is also valid (meaning to extract oil).

But we might also consider that the word could be ""AUNGY"" but it's not standard, so probably not.

Or ""ABYSS"" doesn't fit.

Another idea: ""ATOMS"" is A T O M S -> no, ends with S.

""AVOID"" ends with D.

We need to end with ""NG"" for the last three letters? No: the pattern is A ? ? N G, so the last three are ? ? N G.

So the word is A _ _ N G.

Now, the second and third letters can be various.

We can also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

We have to guess one.

Let me see which one to pick. Since we have to test letters, we can choose ""AWING"" because W and I are more common than X.

But X is very common in words? Not really.

We can also consider that in the first guess, we had A in the word (not position 2) and now we know it's position 1. We also know N is position 4 and G is position 5.

So the word is A ? ? N G.

Now, for the third guess, we can try ""AWING"".

If it's not, then we try ""AXING"".

But we have two guesses left? We are on guess 3, so we have 4,5,6 left. But we might solve it in three.

So let's try ""AWING"".

But we have to make a guess.

Alternatively, we can think of other words.

What about ""AUNGY""? I think it's not standard, so avoid.

Or ""ABHNG"" no.

Another word: ""ADWING"" is 6 letters.

""ADZING"": not a word.

""AFRIT"": has R.

I think we have to go with ""AWING"" or ""AXING"".

But let me search my memory: 
- ""AWING"": yes.
- ""AXING"": yes.

But ""AXING"" might be less common. Also, X is a high-frequency letter in English? Not really.

We can also consider ""AHING"" but not a word.

Or ""AKING"" not a word.

I think we should try ""AWING"".

But note: we have to avoid using letters that are excluded. W and I are not excluded.

So let's guess ""AWING"".

But wait, in ""AWING"", the third letter is I. We don't know about I.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses two new letters that are common.

But we have to fit the pattern.

Another word: ""AUNGY"" is not standard, so I'll skip.

Or ""ABYSS"" doesn't fit.

I think ""AWING"" is a good guess.

But let me see if there's a word that uses more common letters.

What about ""STING"": but S is available, but the pattern is A _ _ N G, so it must start with A. ""STING"" starts with S.

We need A at the start.

So only words that start with A and end with ""NG"" after the third letter? Actually, the pattern is A ? ? N G, so the last three letters are the third letter, then the fourth is N, fifth is G.

So the word is A _ X N G, where X is the third letter.

Common words: 
- ""AWING"" (with X=I, W=2nd)
- ""AXING"" (with X=I, X=2nd)

But ""AXING"" has X in the second position and I in the third.

We can also consider ""ADZING"" not a word.

""AEING"" not a word.

""AGREE"" not ending with G.

I think we have to choose one.

Since we have to, let's pick ""AWING"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not missing something.

Another word: ""AUNGY"" is not standard, so I'll exclude it.

Or ""ABHNG"" no.

Perhaps ""ABHOR"" but has O and R, excluded.

So I think ""AWING"" is a valid guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""AWING"".

But let me double-check the pattern: 
- Position 1: A (we know is correct)
- Position 2: W (to test)
- Position 3: I (to test)
- Position 4: N (correct)
- Position 5: G (correct)

If the word is ""AWING"", then we get it right.

If not, we get feedback on W and I.

If W is not in the word or not in position, we know.

Similarly for I.

But we have two positions to fill, so we might get more information.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has different letters to cover more ground, but we are constrained by the pattern.

For example, we could try ""AXING"" to test X and I.

But I think ""AWING"" is more common.

So I'll go with ""AWING"".

But wait, what about ""AUNGY""? It's not standard, but let's assume we are not limited to common words? Actually, we must use valid English words.

""AUNGY"" is not in standard dictionaries.

So I think ""AWING"" is a good choice.

Therefore, the third guess is ""AWING"".

But let me see if there's a word like ""ADNEX""? Not a word.

Or ""AEDES"" has E and doesn't end with G.

I think we have to go with it.

So the guess is ""AWING"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(✓), E(x)  
  - This reveals:  
    - N is in the word and in the correct position (4th).  
    - A is in the word but not in the 2nd position.  
    - C, R, and E are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: along** → Feedback: A(✓), L(x), O(x), N(✓), G(✓)  
  - This reveals:  
    - A is in the correct position (1st).  
    - G is in the correct position (5th).  
    - L and O are not in the word.  
    - N is confirmed again in the 4th position.  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Confirmed positions**:  
  - Position 1: A  
  - Position 4: N  
  - Position 5: G  
  - The word pattern is: **A _ _ N G**  
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, E, L, O (not in the word).  
- **Unknown positions**: 2nd and 3rd letters.  
- **Available letters**: All letters except excluded ones (C, R, E, L, O). Common options include B, D, F, H, I, M, P, S, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- We need to test possible letters for the 2nd and 3rd positions.  
- The word must be valid and fit the pattern **A _ _ N G**.  
- After evaluating options (e.g., ""AWING"", ""AXING""), ""AWING"" is chosen because:  
  - It tests W in the 2nd position and I in the 3rd position.  
  - W and I are common letters not yet tested.  
  - ""AWING"" is a common English word (meaning a type of bird or a verb meaning inspiration).  
- If incorrect, the feedback will reveal if W or I are in the word and their positions, narrowing down possibilities for the next guess.

- O: x (not in the word)
- N: ✓ (correct, in position 4)
- G: ✓ (correct, in position 5)

So, from this, we know:

1. The first letter is A (from ""along"" feedback: A✓).
2. The fifth letter is G (from ""along"" feedback: G✓).
3. The fourth letter is N (from both guesses).
4. The letter A is in the word, and we now know it's in position 1. Also, we know from the first guess that A is not in position 2 (which we already used to our advantage).
5. The following letters are not in the word: C, R, E, L, O.

Also, from the first guess, we had A in the word but not in position 2, and now we know it's in position 1.

So the current known information:
- Position 1: A
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: G
- The word is: A _ _ N G

We need to find the second and third letters.

We know the following letters are not in the word: C, R, E, L, O.

We have to choose a word that fits the pattern A _ _ N G and uses letters that are not excluded.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Possible letters for the second and third positions: we have to avoid C, R, E, L, O. So available letters: B, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want to maximize information. Since we have two positions to guess, we can try to use common letters that we haven't tested yet.

In the first guess, we tested: C, R, A, N, E.
In the second guess, we tested: A, L, O, N, G.

So we have tested: A, C, E, L, N, O, R, G. But note:
- A, N, G are in the word (A in pos1, N in pos4, G in pos5).
- C, E, L, O, R are not in the word.

Therefore, the remaining letters to test are: B, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word: A _ _ N G

We can try to think of common words that fit this pattern.

Common words: 
- ""AFTER"": but E and R are not allowed (R was already excluded in guess1, and E in guess1).
- ""ALONG"": we already tried, and it had O and L which are now excluded.
- ""AMONG"": A M O N G -> but O is excluded (from guess2: O x). So not allowed.
- ""ASONG"": not a common word? And S is available, but let's see.
- ""ATONG"": not a word.
- ""AWING"": but the pattern is A _ _ N G, so the last letter must be G, not ""WING"". ""AWING"" ends with G? A W I N G -> positions: 1:A, 2:W, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> that fits. And W and I are not excluded.

But is ""AWING"" a word? Yes, meaning a type of bird or a verb meaning lifting device.

But we have to check if W and I are allowed. We haven't tested them, and they are not in the excluded list.

Excluded: C, R, E, L, O.

So W and I are free.

Another possibility: ""AUNGY""? Not a word.

""ABING"": A B I N G -> B and I are available. ""ABING"" is a word? It might be a surname or not common. Let me think of common words.

""ADING"": not a word.

""AFUNG"": not a word.

""AGUNG"": not common.

""AHING"": not a word.

""AIING"": not a word.

""ALING"": not a word.

""AMING"": not a word.

""APING"": not a word.

""ARING"": has R -> not allowed.

""ASHING"": too long.

""ATING"": not a word.

""AVIARY"": too long.

""AWING"" is a word.

Another common word: ""ASKEW"": but the pattern is A _ _ N G, so it must end with G. ""ASKEW"" ends with W, not G.

""ASKED"": has E and D? But E is excluded.

""ASSAY"": has S and S, but pattern: A S S A Y -> not matching.

We need the pattern: A _ _ N G.

Another word: ""ATOMS"": has O and M, but O is excluded, and it ends with S, not G.

""AVOID"": has O and I, but O is excluded, and it doesn't end with G.

""AWAKE"": has E and K, but E is excluded.

""AWARD"": has R and D, but R is excluded.

""AXING"": A X I N G -> X and I are available. ""AXING"" is a word (meaning to extract oil from ground).

But X is not very common.

""AZING"": not a word.

""ABACU"": not matching.

""ABYSS"": not matching.

""ADAPT"": has D and P, but pattern: A D A P T -> doesn't match because we need N in the 4th and G in the 5th.

We need the 4th to be N and 5th to be G.

So the word must end with ""NG"" after the third letter? No: the pattern is A _ _ N G, so the last two letters are ""NG"", with the 4th as N and 5th as G.

So the word is A ? ? N G.

Now, ""AWING"" is A W I N G -> positions: 1:A, 2:W, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> fits.

Also, ""AXING"": A X I N G -> fits.

But ""AWING"" is more common? Or ""AXING"".

We can also consider ""AMONG"" but O is excluded.

Another: ""ALONG"" we tried.

What about ""AUNGY""? Not a word.

""ABHNG""? Not a word.

""ADHNG""? Not a word.

""AFNG""? Not a word.

""AGNG""? Not a word.

""AING""? Not a word.

""ALNG""? Not a word.

""AMNG""? Not a word.

""APNG""? Not a word.

""ARNG""? Has R -> not allowed.

""ASNG""? Not a word.

""ATNG""? Not a word.

""AVNG""? Not a word.

""AWNG""? Not a word.

""AXNG""? Not a word.

""AZNG""? Not a word.

So ""AWING"" and ""AXING"" are candidates.

But ""AXING"" might be less common.

Another possibility: ""AHING"": not a word.

""AKING"": not a word.

""ALING"": not a word.

""AMING"": not a word.

""APING"": not a word.

""ARING"": has R -> not allowed.

""ASHING"": too long.

""AToning"": too long.

We might have to consider that the word might be ""AWING"" or ""AXING"", or perhaps I missed a word.

What about ""AUNGY""? Not standard.

Or ""ABYSS"" but doesn't fit.

Another idea: ""ATOMS"" doesn't end with G.

""AVOID"" doesn't end with G.

""AXIOM"": has O and M, but O is excluded, and pattern: A X I O M -> doesn't end with G.

We need the last two to be ""NG"", with N at 4 and G at 5.

So the word is A ? ? N G.

Common words: 
- ""AWING"" (as above)
- ""AXING"" (as above)
- ""ADWING"": A D W I N G -> but that's 6 letters? No, ""ADWING"" is 6 letters. We need 5 letters.

""ADWING"" is 6 letters. So no.

""ABHING"": not 5 letters.

""ABYING"": not common, and byings are 5? A B Y I N G -> 6 letters.

""ABYSS"" doesn't fit.

""ACING"": has C -> excluded.

""ADZING"": not a word.

""AFRIT"": has R and F, but R excluded.

I think ""AWING"" and ""AXING"" are the main options.

But ""AXING"" might be considered a verb, but ""AWING"" is more common.

Another word: ""AERIE"" has E and doesn't end with G.

""AGAPE"" has E and doesn't end with G.

We might have to consider that the word is ""AWING"" or ""AXING"", or perhaps I missed ""AMONG"" but O is excluded.

What about ""ALONG""? We tried and it had O and L which are excluded.

So the only common words I can think of are ""AWING"" and ""AXING"".

But let me confirm: 
- ""AWING"": A, W, I, N, G -> positions: 1:A, 2:W, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> fits the pattern.

""AXING"": A, X, I, N, G -> same pattern.

We also have ""AUNGY"" but not standard.

Or ""ABHNG"" no.

So between ""AWING"" and ""AXING"", which one to choose?

We want to test letters that are common. W, I, X.

I is a vowel, and W is a consonant. X is less common.

We might also consider that we have two positions to fill: 2nd and 3rd.

We can choose a word that uses two new letters to test both at once.

But we have to make a guess that might be the word.

Since we have two possibilities, we can choose one.

But note: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 3. So we can try one.

Alternatively, we can think of other words that fit the pattern.

What about ""AHING""? Not a word.

""AKING"": not a word.

""ALING"": not a word.

""AMING"": not a word.

""APING"": not a word.

""ARING"": has R -> not allowed.

""ASHING"": too long.

""ATING"": not a word.

""AVING"": not a word.

""AWING"" and ""AXING"" are the only common ones.

But there's also ""ABHNG"" no.

Another: ""ADZING"": not a word.

""AEING"": not a word, and has E.

""AGREE"": has E and doesn't end with G.

I think we have to choose between ""AWING"" and ""AXING"".

But let me check: ""AWING"" is a valid word, and ""AXING"" is also valid (meaning to extract oil).

But we might also consider that the word could be ""AUNGY"" but it's not standard, so probably not.

Or ""ABYSS"" doesn't fit.

Another idea: ""ATOMS"" is A T O M S -> no, ends with S.

""AVOID"" ends with D.

We need to end with ""NG"" for the last three letters? No: the pattern is A ? ? N G, so the last three are ? ? N G.

So the word is A _ _ N G.

Now, the second and third letters can be various.

We can also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

We have to guess one.

Let me see which one to pick. Since we have to test letters, we can choose ""AWING"" because W and I are more common than X.

But X is very common in words? Not really.

We can also consider that in the first guess, we had A in the word (not position 2) and now we know it's position 1. We also know N is position 4 and G is position 5.

So the word is A ? ? N G.

Now, for the third guess, we can try ""AWING"".

If it's not, then we try ""AXING"".

But we have two guesses left? We are on guess 3, so we have 4,5,6 left. But we might solve it in three.

So let's try ""AWING"".

But we have to make a guess.

Alternatively, we can think of other words.

What about ""AUNGY""? I think it's not standard, so avoid.

Or ""ABHNG"" no.

Another word: ""ADWING"" is 6 letters.

""ADZING"": not a word.

""AFRIT"": has R.

I think we have to go with ""AWING"" or ""AXING"".

But let me search my memory: 
- ""AWING"": yes.
- ""AXING"": yes.

But ""AXING"" might be less common. Also, X is a high-frequency letter in English? Not really.

We can also consider ""AHING"" but not a word.

Or ""AKING"" not a word.

I think we should try ""AWING"".

But note: we have to avoid using letters that are excluded. W and I are not excluded.

So let's guess ""AWING"".

But wait, in ""AWING"", the third letter is I. We don't know about I.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses two new letters that are common.

But we have to fit the pattern.

Another word: ""AUNGY"" is not standard, so I'll skip.

Or ""ABYSS"" doesn't fit.

I think ""AWING"" is a good guess.

But let me see if there's a word that uses more common letters.

What about ""STING"": but S is available, but the pattern is A _ _ N G, so it must start with A. ""STING"" starts with S.

We need A at the start.

So only words that start with A and end with ""NG"" after the third letter? Actually, the pattern is A ? ? N G, so the last three letters are the third letter, then the fourth is N, fifth is G.

So the word is A _ X N G, where X is the third letter.

Common words: 
- ""AWING"" (with X=I, W=2nd)
- ""AXING"" (with X=I, X=2nd)

But ""AXING"" has X in the second position and I in the third.

We can also consider ""ADZING"" not a word.

""AEING"" not a word.

""AGREE"" not ending with G.

I think we have to choose one.

Since we have to, let's pick ""AWING"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not missing something.

Another word: ""AUNGY"" is not standard, so I'll exclude it.

Or ""ABHNG"" no.

Perhaps ""ABHOR"" but has O and R, excluded.

So I think ""AWING"" is a valid guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""AWING"".

But let me double-check the pattern: 
- Position 1: A (we know is correct)
- Position 2: W (to test)
- Position 3: I (to test)
- Position 4: N (correct)
- Position 5: G (correct)

If the word is ""AWING"", then we get it right.

If not, we get feedback on W and I.

If W is not in the word or not in position, we know.

Similarly for I.

But we have two positions to fill, so we might get more information.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has different letters to cover more ground, but we are constrained by the pattern.

For example, we could try ""AXING"" to test X and I.

But I think ""AWING"" is more common.

So I'll go with ""AWING"".

But wait, what about ""AUNGY""? It's not standard, but let's assume we are not limited to common words? Actually, we must use valid English words.

""AUNGY"" is not in standard dictionaries.

So I think ""AWING"" is a good choice.

Therefore, the third guess is ""AWING"".

But let me see if there's a word like ""ADNEX""? Not a word.

Or ""AEDES"" has E and doesn't end with G.

I think we have to go with it.

So the guess is ""AWING"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(✓), E(x)  
  - This reveals:  
    - N is in the word and in the correct position (4th).  
    - A is in the word but not in the 2nd position.  
    - C, R, and E are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: along** → Feedback: A(✓), L(x), O(x), N(✓), G(✓)  
  - This reveals:  
    - A is in the correct position (1st).  
    - G is in the correct position (5th).  
    - L and O are not in the word.  
    - N is confirmed again in the 4th position.  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Confirmed positions**:  
  - Position 1: A  
  - Position 4: N  
  - Position 5: G  
  - The word pattern is: **A _ _ N G**  
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, E, L, O (not in the word).  
- **Unknown positions**: 2nd and 3rd letters.  
- **Available letters**: All letters except excluded ones (C, R, E, L, O). Common options include B, D, F, H, I, M, P, S, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- We need to test possible letters for the 2nd and 3rd positions.  
- The word must be valid and fit the pattern **A _ _ N G**.  
- After evaluating options (e.g., ""AWING"", ""AXING""), ""AWING"" is chosen because:  
  - It tests W in the 2nd position and I in the 3rd position.  
  - W and I are common letters not yet tested.  
  - ""AWING"" is a common English word (meaning a type of bird or a verb meaning inspiration).  
- If incorrect, the feedback will reveal if W or I are in the word and their positions, narrowing down possibilities for the next guess.",Guess 3: awing -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) W(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(✓) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: ✓ (correct position, so N is the 4th letter)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The 4th letter is N.
- The letter A is in the word, but not in the 2nd position (since we guessed it in the 2nd position and it was marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, R, and E are not in the word.

We also know that the word has 5 letters and is a valid English word.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Has N in the 4th position (since it was correct in the first guess and we know it's fixed there).
- Includes the letter A, but not in the 2nd position (so we can try it in a different position to find the correct one).
- Avoids the letters C, R, E (since they are not in the word).

Additionally, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

Let's think of words that have N in the 4th position and include the letter A.

Possible positions for A: since it's not in the 2nd position, we can try it in the 1st, 3rd, or 5th position.

We also want to use other common consonants that we haven't tried yet. We haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: we should avoid the letters that we know are not in the word: C, R, E.

Let me try to think of words that have the pattern: _ _ _ N _

And include the letter A.

Some possibilities:
- A _ _ N _ : but we know A is not in the 2nd position, so we can try A in the 1st? But we don't know if it's in the 1st or not. We can try.
- Alternatively, we can try A in the 3rd or 5th.

We also want to test other letters to get more information.

Let me list some words that fit:
- ""PLANT"": P L A N T -> but we have A in the 3rd position and N in the 4th. However, we know A is in the word, but we don't know if it's in the 3rd. Also, we haven't used P, L, T.

But note: we have to avoid R, C, E. This word doesn't have those.

Alternatively, we can try ""MANGO"": M A N G O -> but we have A in the 2nd position? But we know A is not in the 2nd position? Wait, no: in the first guess, we had A in the 2nd position and it was marked as wrong position, meaning A is in the word but not in the 2nd. So we cannot put A in the 2nd again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there. We should try A in a different position.

In ""MANGO"", A is in the 2nd position, which we know is wrong. So that would be a waste because we already know A is not in the 2nd.

We need a word that has A in either the 1st, 3rd, or 5th.

Let me think of words with A in the 1st: 
- ""ADORN"": but we have R? We know R is not in the word (from first feedback: R was x). So we cannot use R.

We must avoid R, C, E.

So, words without C, R, E.

With A in the 1st: 
- ""ALIGN"": A L I G N -> but we have N in the 5th? We need N in the 4th. So the pattern is _ _ _ N _ -> so the 4th is N, then the 5th is something.

Actually, in ""ALIGN"", the N is the 5th letter, not the 4th. So that doesn't fit.

We need the 4th to be N.

So, let's think of words with the 4th letter N and the 1st letter A? 
- ""A _ _ N _""

Examples: 
- ""ALIGN"" has N at the end, not the 4th.
- ""ABHOR"" has R and H, but R is not allowed.

We need to avoid R, C, E.

Try A in the 1st: 
- ""ADMIN"": A D M I N -> but the 4th letter is I? No, the 4th is N? Let's see: A (1st), D (2nd), M (3rd), I (4th), N (5th). So the 4th is I, not N. So that doesn't work.

We need the 4th to be N. So the word must be: _ _ _ N _

With A in the 1st: 
- ""A _ _ N _"" -> examples: ""AFTER"" has E and R -> not allowed. 
- ""ALONG"": A L O N G -> this has A in 1st, L in 2nd, O in 3rd, N in 4th, G in 5th. And no R, C, E. So that's a candidate.

But note: we know A is in the word, and we are putting it in the 1st position. If the correct position is not 1st, then we'll get a '-' for A and know it's in the 3rd or 5th.

Alternatively, we can try A in the 3rd position: _ _ A N _

Examples: 
- ""PLANT"": P L A N T -> A is in 3rd, and N in 4th. No R, C, E. So that's a candidate.

Or ""GRANT"": but G R A N T -> has R, which is not allowed.

Another: ""BLAND"": B L A N D -> A in 3rd, N in 4th. No R, C, E. So that's a candidate.

Or ""STAND"": S T A N D -> A in 3rd, N in 4th. But we have S, T, D. However, we don't know if S, T, D are in the word.

But note: we also want to test new letters.

We have two candidates so far: ""ALONG"" and ""PLANT"" and ""BLAND"".

But we also have the option to try A in the 5th position: _ _ _ N A

Examples: 
- ""PIZZA"": but has Z and Z, and we don't know about Z. Also, we have two Z's? But we don't know if Z is in the word. Also, we want to test more common letters.

- ""MANIA"": M A N I A -> but the 4th letter is I? No, the 4th is N? Let's see: M (1st), A (2nd), N (3rd), I (4th), A (5th). So the 4th is I, not N. So that doesn't work.

We need the 4th to be N. So the word must be: _ _ _ N A

Examples: 
- ""URBAN"": U R B A N -> but R is not allowed.
- ""DOGMA"": D O G M A -> 4th is M, not N.

It's hard to find words with the pattern _ _ _ N A without using forbidden letters.

Another: ""PIANO"": P I A N O -> but the 4th is N? Let's see: P (1st), I (2nd), A (3rd), N (4th), O (5th). Yes! So A is in the 3rd and N in the 4th. And we avoid R, C, E.

But note: in ""PIANO"", we have A in the 3rd position. We know A is in the word, but we don't know if it's in the 3rd. We can try.

But wait, we already have two candidates: ""ALONG"" (A in 1st) and ""PIANO"" (A in 3rd). Which one is better?

We also have ""PLANT"" (A in 3rd).

But note: we want to maximize information. We should try to include letters that we haven't tested yet.

In the first guess, we used: C, R, A, N, E. We know C, R, E are absent. So we have tested A and N (with N being correct in the 4th).

Now, we want to test new letters. So ""PIANO"" uses P, I, A, N, O. We already know A and N are in the word (N is fixed). So we are testing P, I, O.

Similarly, ""ALONG"" uses A, L, O, N, G. We know A and N, so testing L, O, G.

But note: in ""ALONG"", we are putting A in the 1st position. If the correct position is not 1st, then we get a '-' for A and know it's in the 3rd or 5th.

In ""PIANO"", we are putting A in the 3rd position. If the correct position is not 3rd, then we get a '-' for A and know it's in the 1st or 5th.

We have two possibilities for A: 1st or 5th? Actually, it could be in the 3rd? But we don't know.

We can also consider words that have A in the 5th: _ _ _ N A

Examples: 
- ""PIZZA"": not good because of Z and we don't know.
- ""JUMNA"": not a word.
- ""TUNNA"": not common.

It's difficult. So let's stick with words that have A in the 1st or 3rd.

Another candidate: ""SALON"": S A L O N -> but the 4th is O? No, the 4th is N? Let's see: S (1st), A (2nd), L (3rd), O (4th), N (5th). So the 4th is O, not N. So no.

We need the 4th to be N. So the word must be: _ _ _ N _

So for A in the 1st: A _ _ N _
For A in the 3rd: _ _ A N _

Let me list more words:

With A in 1st: 
- ""ADMIN"" -> A D M I N -> 4th is I, not N -> invalid pattern.
- ""ADORN"" -> has R and O, but R is not allowed.
- ""AGLOW"": A G L O W -> 4th is O, not N.

Actually, we need the 4th to be N. So the word must have the 4th letter as N.

So for A in 1st: 
- ""A _ _ N _"" -> the 4th is N, then the 5th is something.

Examples: 
- ""ALIGN"" -> A L I G N -> 4th is G, not N -> no.
- ""ATTAIN"" -> too long.

5-letter words: 
- ""AUNTY"": A U N T Y -> but the 3rd is N? Let's see: A (1st), U (2nd), N (3rd), T (4th), Y (5th). So the 4th is T, not N. So no.

We need the 4th to be N. So the word must be: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] N [letter5]

So for A in 1st: 
- ""A _ _ N _""

Examples: 
- ""ADMIN"" -> A D M I N -> but the 4th is I, not N -> invalid.
- ""AFTER"" -> has E and R -> not allowed.

Actually, I can't think of a common word with A in 1st and N in 4th. 

Let me try A in the 3rd: _ _ A N _

Examples: 
- ""BLAND"": B L A N D -> B (1st), L (2nd), A (3rd), N (4th), D (5th). This fits: _ _ A N _ -> with A in 3rd and N in 4th.

Similarly, ""PLANT"": P L A N T -> same pattern.

Or ""GRANT"": but has R -> not allowed.

Or ""STAND"": S T A N D -> S (1st), T (2nd), A (3rd), N (4th), D (5th). No R, C, E.

So ""STAND"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""BLAND"": B L A N D -> same.

Now, for A in the 5th: _ _ _ N A

Examples: 
- ""PIZZA"": P I Z Z A -> 4th is Z, not N -> no.
- ""TUNNA"": not common and 4th is N? T U N N A -> 4th is N, 5th is A. But ""TUNNA"" is not a common word. We need valid words.

""MANIA"": M A N I A -> 4th is I, not N.

""MANNA"": M A N N A -> 4th is N? M (1st), A (2nd), N (3rd), N (4th), A (5th). So the 4th is N? Yes: positions: 1:M, 2:A, 3:N, 4:N, 5:A. So we have N in the 3rd and 4th? But we know N is in the 4th, but we don't know about the 3rd. However, we have two N's? But we don't know if the word has two N's.

But ""MANNA"" is a word (a type of fruit). But let's see: we are testing M, A, N, N, A. We know A and N are in the word. So we are testing M and the second N (which might be redundant if the word has only one N? But we don't know).

Alternatively, ""PIANO"" is a good candidate: P I A N O -> 1:P, 2:I, 3:A, 4:N, 5:O.

This has A in the 3rd and N in the 4th. We know A is in the word but not in the 2nd, so we are trying it in the 3rd. We also test P, I, O.

Similarly, ""PIANO"" is a valid word.

Another candidate: ""PLAIN"": P L A I N -> but the 4th is I, not N -> no.

""TRAIN"": has R -> not allowed.

""PLAIN"": P L A I N -> 4th is I, not N.

So ""PIANO"" is a good candidate.

But note: we have to avoid using letters we know are absent. We know C, R, E are absent. P, I, O are new.

We can also consider ""SALON"", but that doesn't fit because the 4th is O.

Another word: ""BANJO"": B A N J O -> but the 3rd is N, 4th is O -> no.

I think ""PIANO"" is a good choice because:
- It has A in the 3rd position (so we can check if A is in the 3rd or not).
- It has N in the 4th (which we know is correct, so we can confirm and also test other letters).

But note: we already know N is in the 4th, so we will get a check for N again? Yes, because it's in the same position. But that's okay because it confirms the position and we get to test other letters.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't repeat N? But we don't have to, because we know N is fixed in the 4th.

But to test more letters, we might want to avoid repeating N? Or we can use it to get more information about the other positions.

Since we have limited guesses, we want to maximize information. So it's better to use a word that has new letters and doesn't repeat the ones we know are absent, and also doesn't repeat N in a way that we can get new information? Actually, repeating N in the 4th is okay because we know it's correct, but we are using the same position again. The new information will be in the other positions.

But we are required to have N in the 4th.

So let's choose between ""ALONG"", ""PLANT"", ""STAND"", and ""PIANO"".

We can also consider ""DAUNT"": D A U N T -> but the 4th is N? D (1st), A (2nd), U (3rd), N (4th), T (5th). But we know A is not in the 2nd (from first feedback). So we cannot put A in the 2nd again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting A in the 2nd.

In ""DAUNT"", A is in the 2nd, which we know is wrong. So that would be a waste.

Similarly, in ""PIANO"", A is in the 3rd, which is new.

In ""ALONG"", A is in the 1st, which is new.

In ""PLANT"", A is in the 3rd, same as PIANO.

But ""PIANO"" has the advantage of having three new vowels (I and O) and a consonant (P).

Alternatively, we can use a word that has A in the 5th? But we couldn't find a common one without forbidden letters.

Another word: ""LAMIN"": not common.

""MANIA"": not because 4th is I.

I think ""PIANO"" is a good choice.

But let me check if there's a word that has A in the 5th: 
- ""DELTA"": but has E and R -> not allowed.
- ""BETTA"": has E -> not allowed.
- ""LYTTA"": not common.

So maybe ""PIANO"" is a good option.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know.

I think we should go with ""PIANO"".

So my second guess: PIANO

But let me confirm: 
- P: new
- I: new
- A: we know it's in the word, but we are trying it in the 3rd
- N: we know is in the 4th, so we expect a check for N.
- O: new

We avoid C, R, E.

So, let's go with ""PIANO"".

But wait, what if the word has A in the 1st? Then in ""PIANO"", A is in the 3rd and we get a '-' for A. Then we know A is in the 1st or 5th. And we get information about P, I, O.

If the word has A in the 3rd, then we get a check for A? But we don't know if A is in the 3rd or not.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in the 1st to test that possibility.

For example, ""ALONG"": A L O N G -> A in 1st, L in 2nd, O in 3rd, N in 4th, G in 5th.

This tests A in the 1st, and we test L, O, G.

We know A is in the word, so if we put it in the 1st, we might get:
- If A is in the 1st, then we get a check for A.
- If not, then we get a '-' for A (meaning it's in the 3rd or 5th) and we know.

Also, we test L, O, G.

Similarly, ""PLANT"": P L A N T -> A in 3rd.

I think both are good. But ""ALONG"" tests A in the 1st, which we haven't tested, while ""PIANO"" tests A in the 3rd.

Since we know A is not in the 2nd, we have two possibilities: 1st or 5th. So testing A in the 1st will help us narrow it down.

Therefore, I choose ""ALONG"".

But wait, in ""ALONG"", we have A in the 1st and we know A is in the word. So if the correct position is 1st, we get a check. If not, we get a '-' and know it's in the 5th.

Also, we test L, O, G.

Alternatively, we can use ""STAND"": S T A N D -> A in 3rd.

But I think testing A in the 1st is a good idea.

So I'll go with ""ALONG"".

But let me see if there's a word that has A in the 5th and doesn't use forbidden letters. After some thought, I found ""PENNA"": P E N N A -> but E is not allowed (we know E is absent). So invalid.

""JUNNA"": not common.

So ""ALONG"" seems good.

But note: we have to make sure the word is valid. ""ALONG"" is a valid word.

So second guess: ALONG

But let me compare with ""PIANO"". Both are valid.

I think ""ALONG"" is better because it tests A in the 1st, which is a new position, and we get to test S and T which are very common.

In ""PIANO"", we test P, I, O.

S and T are more common than P, I, O? Actually, S and T are very common.

So ""ALONG"" might be better.

But we also have to consider that we know N is in the 4th, so we are using that.

So I'll go with ""ALONG"".

But wait, in ""ALONG"", we have O and G. We don't know about them.

Alternatively, we can use ""SAINT"": S A I N T -> but the 4th is N? S (1st), A (2nd), I (3rd), N (4th), T (5th). But we know A is not in the 2nd! So we cannot put A in the 2nd. So ""SAINT"" is invalid because it has A in the 2nd.

So we must avoid putting A in the 2nd.

Therefore, ""ALONG"" is good: A in 1st, which is not the 2nd.

Similarly, ""PLANT"" is good: A in 3rd (not 2nd).

But I think ""ALONG"" is a good choice.

So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and E are not in the word (marked with ""x"").
- A is in the word but not in the 2nd position (marked with ""-"").
- N is in the word and in the correct 4th position (marked with ""✓"").

For the second guess:
- The word must have N in the 4th position.
- A must be included but not in the 2nd position (so positions 1st, 3rd, or 5th are candidates).
- Avoid using C, R, or E.
- Test new common letters to gather more information.

The word ""along"" fits well:
- A is in the 1st position (testing if A is in the 1st position).
- N is in the 4th position (confirmed correct).
- New letters: L, O, G (common consonants and a vowel).
- Avoids C, R, E.

This guess will help narrow down the position of A and test three new letters.

<guess>along</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: along -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(x) O(x) N(✓) G(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- N: ✓ (correct, in position 4)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""along""
- A: ✓ (correct, in position 1)
- L: x (not in the word)
- O: x (not in the word)
- N: ✓ (correct, in position 4)
- G: ✓ (correct, in position 5)

So, from this, we know:

1. The first letter is A (from ""along"" feedback: A✓).
2. The fifth letter is G (from ""along"" feedback: G✓).
3. The fourth letter is N (from both guesses).
4. The letter A is in the word, and we now know it's in position 1. Also, we know from the first guess that A is not in position 2 (which we already used to our advantage).
5. The following letters are not in the word: C, R, E, L, O.

Also, from the first guess, we had A in the word but not in position 2, and now we know it's in position 1.

So the current known information:
- Position 1: A
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: G
- The word is: A _ _ N G

We need to find the second and third letters.

We know the following letters are not in the word: C, R, E, L, O.

We have to choose a word that fits the pattern A _ _ N G and uses letters that are not excluded.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Possible letters for the second and third positions: we have to avoid C, R, E, L, O. So available letters: B, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want to maximize information. Since we have two positions to guess, we can try to use common letters that we haven't tested yet.

In the first guess, we tested: C, R, A, N, E.
In the second guess, we tested: A, L, O, N, G.

So we have tested: A, C, E, L, N, O, R, G. But note:
- A, N, G are in the word (A in pos1, N in pos4, G in pos5).
- C, E, L, O, R are not in the word.

Therefore, the remaining letters to test are: B, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word: A _ _ N G

We can try to think of common words that fit this pattern.

Common words: 
- ""AFTER"": but E and R are not allowed (R was already excluded in guess1, and E in guess1).
- ""ALONG"": we already tried, and it had O and L which are now excluded.
- ""AMONG"": A M O N G -> but O is excluded (from guess2: O x). So not allowed.
- ""ASONG"": not a common word? And S is available, but let's see.
- ""ATONG"": not a word.
- ""AWING"": but the pattern is A _ _ N G, so the last letter must be G, not ""WING"". ""AWING"" ends with G? A W I N G -> positions: 1:A, 2:W, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> that fits. And W and I are not excluded.

But is ""AWING"" a word? Yes, meaning a type of bird or a verb meaning lifting device.

But we have to check if W and I are allowed. We haven't tested them, and they are not in the excluded list.

Excluded: C, R, E, L, O.

So W and I are free.

Another possibility: ""AUNGY""? Not a word.

""ABING"": A B I N G -> B and I are available. ""ABING"" is a word? It might be a surname or not common. Let me think of common words.

""ADING"": not a word.

""AFUNG"": not a word.

""AGUNG"": not common.

""AHING"": not a word.

""AIING"": not a word.

""ALING"": not a word.

""AMING"": not a word.

""APING"": not a word.

""ARING"": has R -> not allowed.

""ASHING"": too long.

""ATING"": not a word.

""AVIARY"": too long.

""AWING"" is a word.

Another common word: ""ASKEW"": but the pattern is A _ _ N G, so it must end with G. ""ASKEW"" ends with W, not G.

""ASKED"": has E and D? But E is excluded.

""ASSAY"": has S and S, but pattern: A S S A Y -> not matching.

We need the pattern: A _ _ N G.

Another word: ""ATOMS"": has O and M, but O is excluded, and it ends with S, not G.

""AVOID"": has O and I, but O is excluded, and it doesn't end with G.

""AWAKE"": has E and K, but E is excluded.

""AWARD"": has R and D, but R is excluded.

""AXING"": A X I N G -> X and I are available. ""AXING"" is a word (meaning to extract oil from ground).

But X is not very common.

""AZING"": not a word.

""ABACU"": not matching.

""ABYSS"": not matching.

""ADAPT"": has D and P, but pattern: A D A P T -> doesn't match because we need N in the 4th and G in the 5th.

We need the 4th to be N and 5th to be G.

So the word must end with ""NG"" after the third letter? No: the pattern is A _ _ N G, so the last two letters are ""NG"", with the 4th as N and 5th as G.

So the word is A ? ? N G.

Now, ""AWING"" is A W I N G -> positions: 1:A, 2:W, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> fits.

Also, ""AXING"": A X I N G -> fits.

But ""AWING"" is more common? Or ""AXING"".

We can also consider ""AMONG"" but O is excluded.

Another: ""ALONG"" we tried.

What about ""AUNGY""? Not a word.

""ABHNG""? Not a word.

""ADHNG""? Not a word.

""AFNG""? Not a word.

""AGNG""? Not a word.

""AING""? Not a word.

""ALNG""? Not a word.

""AMNG""? Not a word.

""APNG""? Not a word.

""ARNG""? Has R -> not allowed.

""ASNG""? Not a word.

""ATNG""? Not a word.

""AVNG""? Not a word.

""AWNG""? Not a word.

""AXNG""? Not a word.

""AZNG""? Not a word.

So ""AWING"" and ""AXING"" are candidates.

But ""AXING"" might be less common.

Another possibility: ""AHING"": not a word.

""AKING"": not a word.

""ALING"": not a word.

""AMING"": not a word.

""APING"": not a word.

""ARING"": has R -> not allowed.

""ASHING"": too long.

""AToning"": too long.

We might have to consider that the word might be ""AWING"" or ""AXING"", or perhaps I missed a word.

What about ""AUNGY""? Not standard.

Or ""ABYSS"" but doesn't fit.

Another idea: ""ATOMS"" doesn't end with G.

""AVOID"" doesn't end with G.

""AXIOM"": has O and M, but O is excluded, and pattern: A X I O M -> doesn't end with G.

We need the last two to be ""NG"", with N at 4 and G at 5.

So the word is A ? ? N G.

Common words: 
- ""AWING"" (as above)
- ""AXING"" (as above)
- ""ADWING"": A D W I N G -> but that's 6 letters? No, ""ADWING"" is 6 letters. We need 5 letters.

""ADWING"" is 6 letters. So no.

""ABHING"": not 5 letters.

""ABYING"": not common, and byings are 5? A B Y I N G -> 6 letters.

""ABYSS"" doesn't fit.

""ACING"": has C -> excluded.

""ADZING"": not a word.

""AFRIT"": has R and F, but R excluded.

I think ""AWING"" and ""AXING"" are the main options.

But ""AXING"" might be considered a verb, but ""AWING"" is more common.

Another word: ""AERIE"" has E and doesn't end with G.

""AGAPE"" has E and doesn't end with G.

We might have to consider that the word is ""AWING"" or ""AXING"", or perhaps I missed ""AMONG"" but O is excluded.

What about ""ALONG""? We tried and it had O and L which are excluded.

So the only common words I can think of are ""AWING"" and ""AXING"".

But let me confirm: 
- ""AWING"": A, W, I, N, G -> positions: 1:A, 2:W, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> fits the pattern.

""AXING"": A, X, I, N, G -> same pattern.

We also have ""AUNGY"" but not standard.

Or ""ABHNG"" no.

So between ""AWING"" and ""AXING"", which one to choose?

We want to test letters that are common. W, I, X.

I is a vowel, and W is a consonant. X is less common.

We might also consider that we have two positions to fill: 2nd and 3rd.

We can choose a word that uses two new letters to test both at once.

But we have to make a guess that might be the word.

Since we have two possibilities, we can choose one.

But note: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 3. So we can try one.

Alternatively, we can think of other words that fit the pattern.

What about ""AHING""? Not a word.

""AKING"": not a word.

""ALING"": not a word.

""AMING"": not a word.

""APING"": not a word.

""ARING"": has R -> not allowed.

""ASHING"": too long.

""ATING"": not a word.

""AVING"": not a word.

""AWING"" and ""AXING"" are the only common ones.

But there's also ""ABHNG"" no.

Another: ""ADZING"": not a word.

""AEING"": not a word, and has E.

""AGREE"": has E and doesn't end with G.

I think we have to choose between ""AWING"" and ""AXING"".

But let me check: ""AWING"" is a valid word, and ""AXING"" is also valid (meaning to extract oil).

But we might also consider that the word could be ""AUNGY"" but it's not standard, so probably not.

Or ""ABYSS"" doesn't fit.

Another idea: ""ATOMS"" is A T O M S -> no, ends with S.

""AVOID"" ends with D.

We need to end with ""NG"" for the last three letters? No: the pattern is A ? ? N G, so the last three are ? ? N G.

So the word is A _ _ N G.

Now, the second and third letters can be various.

We can also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

We have to guess one.

Let me see which one to pick. Since we have to test letters, we can choose ""AWING"" because W and I are more common than X.

But X is very common in words? Not really.

We can also consider that in the first guess, we had A in the word (not position 2) and now we know it's position 1. We also know N is position 4 and G is position 5.

So the word is A ? ? N G.

Now, for the third guess, we can try ""AWING"".

If it's not, then we try ""AXING"".

But we have two guesses left? We are on guess 3, so we have 4,5,6 left. But we might solve it in three.

So let's try ""AWING"".

But we have to make a guess.

Alternatively, we can think of other words.

What about ""AUNGY""? I think it's not standard, so avoid.

Or ""ABHNG"" no.

Another word: ""ADWING"" is 6 letters.

""ADZING"": not a word.

""AFRIT"": has R.

I think we have to go with ""AWING"" or ""AXING"".

But let me search my memory: 
- ""AWING"": yes.
- ""AXING"": yes.

But ""AXING"" might be less common. Also, X is a high-frequency letter in English? Not really.

We can also consider ""AHING"" but not a word.

Or ""AKING"" not a word.

I think we should try ""AWING"".

But note: we have to avoid using letters that are excluded. W and I are not excluded.

So let's guess ""AWING"".

But wait, in ""AWING"", the third letter is I. We don't know about I.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses two new letters that are common.

But we have to fit the pattern.

Another word: ""AUNGY"" is not standard, so I'll skip.

Or ""ABYSS"" doesn't fit.

I think ""AWING"" is a good guess.

But let me see if there's a word that uses more common letters.

What about ""STING"": but S is available, but the pattern is A _ _ N G, so it must start with A. ""STING"" starts with S.

We need A at the start.

So only words that start with A and end with ""NG"" after the third letter? Actually, the pattern is A ? ? N G, so the last three letters are the third letter, then the fourth is N, fifth is G.

So the word is A _ X N G, where X is the third letter.

Common words: 
- ""AWING"" (with X=I, W=2nd)
- ""AXING"" (with X=I, X=2nd)

But ""AXING"" has X in the second position and I in the third.

We can also consider ""ADZING"" not a word.

""AEING"" not a word.

""AGREE"" not ending with G.

I think we have to choose one.

Since we have to, let's pick ""AWING"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not missing something.

Another word: ""AUNGY"" is not standard, so I'll exclude it.

Or ""ABHNG"" no.

Perhaps ""ABHOR"" but has O and R, excluded.

So I think ""AWING"" is a valid guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""AWING"".

But let me double-check the pattern: 
- Position 1: A (we know is correct)
- Position 2: W (to test)
- Position 3: I (to test)
- Position 4: N (correct)
- Position 5: G (correct)

If the word is ""AWING"", then we get it right.

If not, we get feedback on W and I.

If W is not in the word or not in position, we know.

Similarly for I.

But we have two positions to fill, so we might get more information.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has different letters to cover more ground, but we are constrained by the pattern.

For example, we could try ""AXING"" to test X and I.

But I think ""AWING"" is more common.

So I'll go with ""AWING"".

But wait, what about ""AUNGY""? It's not standard, but let's assume we are not limited to common words? Actually, we must use valid English words.

""AUNGY"" is not in standard dictionaries.

So I think ""AWING"" is a good choice.

Therefore, the third guess is ""AWING"".

But let me see if there's a word like ""ADNEX""? Not a word.

Or ""AEDES"" has E and doesn't end with G.

I think we have to go with it.

So the guess is ""AWING"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(✓), E(x)  
  - This reveals:  
    - N is in the word and in the correct position (4th).  
    - A is in the word but not in the 2nd position.  
    - C, R, and E are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: along** → Feedback: A(✓), L(x), O(x), N(✓), G(✓)  
  - This reveals:  
    - A is in the correct position (1st).  
    - G is in the correct position (5th).  
    - L and O are not in the word.  
    - N is confirmed again in the 4th position.  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Confirmed positions**:  
  - Position 1: A  
  - Position 4: N  
  - Position 5: G  
  - The word pattern is: **A _ _ N G**  
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, E, L, O (not in the word).  
- **Unknown positions**: 2nd and 3rd letters.  
- **Available letters**: All letters except excluded ones (C, R, E, L, O). Common options include B, D, F, H, I, M, P, S, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- We need to test possible letters for the 2nd and 3rd positions.  
- The word must be valid and fit the pattern **A _ _ N G**.  
- After evaluating options (e.g., ""AWING"", ""AXING""), ""AWING"" is chosen because:  
  - It tests W in the 2nd position and I in the 3rd position.  
  - W and I are common letters not yet tested.  
  - ""AWING"" is a common English word (meaning a type of bird or a verb meaning inspiration).  
- If incorrect, the feedback will reveal if W or I are in the word and their positions, narrowing down possibilities for the next guess.

<guess>awing</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

We should choose a word that:\n- Has N in the 4th position (since it was correct in the first guess and we know it\'s fixed there).\n- Includes the letter A, but not in the 2nd position (so we can try it in a different position to find the correct one).\n- Avoids the letters C, R, E (since they are not in the word).\n\nAdditionally, we want to test other common letters to get more information.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have N in the 4th position and include the letter A.\n\nPossible positions for A: since it\'s not in the 2nd position, we can try it in the 1st, 3rd, or 5th position.\n\nWe also want to use other common consonants that we haven\'t tried yet. We haven\'t used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note: we should avoid the letters that we know are not in the word: C, R, E.\n\nLet me try to think of words that have the pattern: _ _ _ N _\n\nAnd include the letter A.\n\nSome possibilities:\n- A _ _ N _ : but we know A is not in the 2nd position, so we can try A in the 1st? But we don\'t know if it\'s in the 1st or not. We can try.\n- Alternatively, we can try A in the 3rd or 5th.\n\nWe also want to test other letters to get more information.\n\nLet me list some words that fit:\n- ""PLANT"": P L A N T -> but we have A in the 3rd position and N in the 4th. However, we know A is in the word, but we don\'t know if it\'s in the 3rd. Also, we haven\'t used P, L, T.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid R, C, E. This word doesn\'t have those.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""MANGO"": M A N G O -> but we have A in the 2nd position? But we know A is not in the 2nd position? Wait, no: in the first guess, we had A in the 2nd position and it was marked as wrong position, meaning A is in the word but not in the 2nd. So we cannot put A in the 2nd again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it\'s not there. We should try A in a different position.\n\nIn ""MANGO"", A is in the 2nd position, which we know is wrong. So that would be a waste because we already know A is not in the 2nd.\n\nWe need a word that has A in either the 1st, 3rd, or 5th.\n\nLet me think of words with A in the 1st: \n- ""ADORN"": but we have R? We know R is not in the word (from first feedback: R was x). So we cannot use R.\n\nWe must avoid R, C, E.\n\nSo, words without C, R, E.\n\nWith A in the 1st: \n- ""ALIGN"": A L I G N -> but we have N in the 5th? We need N in the 4th. So the pattern is _ _ _ N _ -> so the 4th is N, then the 5th is something.\n\nActually, in ""ALIGN"", the N is the 5th letter, not the 4th. So that doesn\'t fit.\n\nWe need the 4th to be N.\n\nSo, let\'s think of words with the 4th letter N and the 1st letter A? \n- ""A _ _ N _""\n\nExamples: \n- ""ALIGN"" has N at the end, not the 4th.\n- ""ABHOR"" has R and H, but R is not allowed.\n\nWe need to avoid R, C, E.\n\nTry A in the 1st: \n- ""ADMIN"": A D M I N -> but the 4th letter is I? No, the 4th is N? Let\'s see: A (1st), D (2nd), M (3rd), I (4th), N (5th). So the 4th is I, not N. So that doesn\'t work.\n\nWe need the 4th to be N. So the word must be: _ _ _ N _\n\nWith A in the 1st: \n- ""A _ _ N _"" -> examples: ""AFTER"" has E and R -> not allowed. \n- ""ALONG"": A L O N G -> this has A in 1st, L in 2nd, O in 3rd, N in 4th, G in 5th. And no R, C, E. So that\'s a candidate.\n\nBut note: we know A is in the word, and we are putting it in the 1st position. If the correct position is not 1st, then we\'ll get a \'-\' for A and know it\'s in the 3rd or 5th.\n\nAlternatively, we can try A in the 3rd position: _ _ A N _\n\nExamples: \n- ""PLANT"": P L A N T -> A is in 3rd, and N in 4th. No R, C, E. So that\'s a candidate.\n\nOr ""GRANT"": but G R A N T -> has R, which is not allowed.\n\nAnother: ""BLAND"": B L A N D -> A in 3rd, N in 4th. No R, C, E. So that\'s a candidate.\n\nOr ""STAND"": S T A N D -> A in 3rd, N in 4th. But we have S, T, D. However, we don\'t know if S, T, D are in the word.\n\nBut note: we also want to test new letters.\n\nWe have two candidates so far: ""ALONG"" and ""PLANT"" and ""BLAND"".\n\nBut we also have the option to try A in the 5th position: _ _ _ N A\n\nExamples: \n- ""PIZZA"": but has Z and Z, and we don\'t know about Z. Also, we have two Z\'s? But we don\'t know if Z is in the word. Also, we want to test more common letters.\n\n- ""MANIA"": M A N I A -> but the 4th letter is I? No, the 4th is N? Let\'s see: M (1st), A (2nd), N (3rd), I (4th), A (5th). So the 4th is I, not N. So that doesn\'t work.\n\nWe need the 4th to be N. So the word must be: _ _ _ N A\n\nExamples: \n- ""URBAN"": U R B A N -> but R is not allowed.\n- ""DOGMA"": D O G M A -> 4th is M, not N.\n\nIt\'s hard to find words with the pattern _ _ _ N A without using forbidden letters.\n\nAnother: ""PIANO"": P I A N O -> but the 4th is N? Let\'s see: P (1st), I (2nd), A (3rd), N (4th), O (5th). Yes! So A is in the 3rd and N in the 4th. And we avoid R, C, E.\n\nBut note: in ""PIANO"", we have A in the 3rd position. We know A is in the word, but we don\'t know if it\'s in the 3rd. We can try.\n\nBut wait, we already have two candidates: ""ALONG"" (A in 1st) and ""PIANO"" (A in 3rd). Which one is better?\n\nWe also have ""PLANT"" (A in 3rd).\n\nBut note: we want to maximize information. We should try to include letters that we haven\'t tested yet.\n\nIn the first guess, we used: C, R, A, N, E. We know C, R, E are absent. So we have tested A and N (with N being correct in the 4th).\n\nNow, we want to test new letters. So ""PIANO"" uses P, I, A, N, O. We already know A and N are in the word (N is fixed). So we are testing P, I, O.\n\nSimilarly, ""ALONG"" uses A, L, O, N, G. We know A and N, so testing L, O, G.\n\nBut note: in ""ALONG"", we are putting A in the 1st position. If the correct position is not 1st, then we get a \'-\' for A and know it\'s in the 3rd or 5th.\n\nIn ""PIANO"", we are putting A in the 3rd position. If the correct position is not 3rd, then we get a \'-\' for A and know it\'s in the 1st or 5th.\n\nWe have two possibilities for A: 1st or 5th? Actually, it could be in the 3rd? But we don\'t know.\n\nWe can also consider words that have A in the 5th: _ _ _ N A\n\nExamples: \n- ""PIZZA"": not good because of Z and we don\'t know.\n- ""JUMNA"": not a word.\n- ""TUNNA"": not common.\n\nIt\'s difficult. So let\'s stick with words that have A in the 1st or 3rd.\n\nAnother candidate: ""SALON"": S A L O N -> but the 4th is O? No, the 4th is N? Let\'s see: S (1st), A (2nd), L (3rd), O (4th), N (5th). So the 4th is O, not N. So no.\n\nWe need the 4th to be N. So the word must be: _ _ _ N _\n\nSo for A in the 1st: A _ _ N _\nFor A in the 3rd: _ _ A N _\n\nLet me list more words:\n\nWith A in 1st: \n- ""ADMIN"" -> A D M I N -> 4th is I, not N -> invalid pattern.\n- ""ADORN"" -> has R and O, but R is not allowed.\n- ""AGLOW"": A G L O W -> 4th is O, not N.\n\nActually, we need the 4th to be N. So the word must have the 4th letter as N.\n\nSo for A in 1st: \n- ""A _ _ N _"" -> the 4th is N, then the 5th is something.\n\nExamples: \n- ""ALIGN"" -> A L I G N -> 4th is G, not N -> no.\n- ""ATTAIN"" -> too long.\n\n5-letter words: \n- ""AUNTY"": A U N T Y -> but the 3rd is N? Let\'s see: A (1st), U (2nd), N (3rd), T (4th), Y (5th). So the 4th is T, not N. So no.\n\nWe need the 4th to be N. So the word must be: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] N [letter5]\n\nSo for A in 1st: \n- ""A _ _ N _""\n\nExamples: \n- ""ADMIN"" -> A D M I N -> but the 4th is I, not N -> invalid.\n- ""AFTER"" -> has E and R -> not allowed.\n\nActually, I can\'t think of a common word with A in 1st and N in 4th. \n\nLet me try A in the 3rd: _ _ A N _\n\nExamples: \n- ""BLAND"": B L A N D -> B (1st), L (2nd), A (3rd), N (4th), D (5th). This fits: _ _ A N _ -> with A in 3rd and N in 4th.\n\nSimilarly, ""PLANT"": P L A N T -> same pattern.\n\nOr ""GRANT"": but has R -> not allowed.\n\nOr ""STAND"": S T A N D -> S (1st), T (2nd), A (3rd), N (4th), D (5th). No R, C, E.\n\nSo ""STAND"" is a candidate.\n\nSimilarly, ""BLAND"": B L A N D -> same.\n\nNow, for A in the 5th: _ _ _ N A\n\nExamples: \n- ""PIZZA"": P I Z Z A -> 4th is Z, not N -> no.\n- ""TUNNA"": not common and 4th is N? T U N N A -> 4th is N, 5th is A. But ""TUNNA"" is not a common word. We need valid words.\n\n""MANIA"": M A N I A -> 4th is I, not N.\n\n""MANNA"": M A N N A -> 4th is N? M (1st), A (2nd), N (3rd), N (4th), A (5th). So the 4th is N? Yes: positions: 1:M, 2:A, 3:N, 4:N, 5:A. So we have N in the 3rd and 4th? But we know N is in the 4th, but we don\'t know about the 3rd. However, we have two N\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has two N\'s.\n\nBut ""MANNA"" is a word (a type of fruit). But let\'s see: we are testing M, A, N, N, A. We know A and N are in the word. So we are testing M and the second N (which might be redundant if the word has only one N? But we don\'t know).\n\nAlternatively, ""PIANO"" is a good candidate: P I A N O -> 1:P, 2:I, 3:A, 4:N, 5:O.\n\nThis has A in the 3rd and N in the 4th. We know A is in the word but not in the 2nd, so we are trying it in the 3rd. We also test P, I, O.\n\nSimilarly, ""PIANO"" is a valid word.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PLAIN"": P L A I N -> but the 4th is I, not N -> no.\n\n""TRAIN"": has R -> not allowed.\n\n""PLAIN"": P L A I N -> 4th is I, not N.\n\nSo ""PIANO"" is a good candidate.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid using letters we know are absent. We know C, R, E are absent. P, I, O are new.\n\nWe can also consider ""SALON"", but that doesn\'t fit because the 4th is O.\n\nAnother word: ""BANJO"": B A N J O -> but the 3rd is N, 4th is O -> no.\n\nI think ""PIANO"" is a good choice because:\n- It has A in the 3rd position (so we can check if A is in the 3rd or not).\n- It has N in the 4th (which we know is correct, so we can confirm and also test other letters).\n\nBut note: we already know N is in the 4th, so we will get a check for N again? Yes, because it\'s in the same position. But that\'s okay because it confirms the position and we get to test other letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t repeat N? But we don\'t have to, because we know N is fixed in the 4th.\n\nBut to test more letters, we might want to avoid repeating N? Or we can use it to get more information about the other positions.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, we want to maximize information. So it\'s better to use a word that has new letters and doesn\'t repeat the ones we know are absent, and also doesn\'t repeat N in a way that we can get new information? Actually, repeating N in the 4th is okay because we know it\'s correct, but we are using the same position again. The new information will be in the other positions.\n\nBut we are required to have N in the 4th.\n\nSo let\'s choose between ""ALONG"", ""PLANT"", ""STAND"", and ""PIANO"".\n\nWe can also consider ""DAUNT"": D A U N T -> but the 4th is N? D (1st), A (2nd), U (3rd), N (4th), T (5th). But we know A is not in the 2nd (from first feedback). So we cannot put A in the 2nd again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it\'s not there. So we should avoid putting A in the 2nd.\n\nIn ""DAUNT"", A is in the 2nd, which we know is wrong. So that would be a waste.\n\nSimilarly, in ""PIANO"", A is in the 3rd, which is new.\n\nIn ""ALONG"", A is in the 1st, which is new.\n\nIn ""PLANT"", A is in the 3rd, same as PIANO.\n\nBut ""PIANO"" has the advantage of having three new vowels (I and O) and a consonant (P).\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that has A in the 5th? But we couldn\'t find a common one without forbidden letters.\n\nAnother word: ""LAMIN"": not common.\n\n""MANIA"": not because 4th is I.\n\nI think ""PIANO"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me check if there\'s a word that has A in the 5th: \n- ""DELTA"": but has E and R -> not allowed.\n- ""BETTA"": has E -> not allowed.\n- ""LYTTA"": not common.\n\nSo maybe ""PIANO"" is a good option.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know.\n\nI think we should go with ""PIANO"".\n\nSo my second guess: PIANO\n\nBut let me confirm: \n- P: new\n- I: new\n- A: we know it\'s in the word, but we are trying it in the 3rd\n- N: we know is in the 4th, so we expect a check for N.\n- O: new\n\nWe avoid C, R, E.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""PIANO"".\n\nBut wait, what if the word has A in the 1st? Then in ""PIANO"", A is in the 3rd and we get a \'-\' for A. Then we know A is in the 1st or 5th. And we get information about P, I, O.\n\nIf the word has A in the 3rd, then we get a check for A? But we don\'t know if A is in the 3rd or not.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has A in the 1st to test that possibility.\n\nFor example, ""ALONG"": A L O N G -> A in 1st, L in 2nd, O in 3rd, N in 4th, G in 5th.\n\nThis tests A in the 1st, and we test L, O, G.\n\nWe know A is in the word, so if we put it in the 1st, we might get:\n- If A is in the 1st, then we get a check for A.\n- If not, then we get a \'-\' for A (meaning it\'s in the 3rd or 5th) and we know.\n\nAlso, we test L, O, G.\n\nSimilarly, ""PLANT"": P L A N T -> A in 3rd.\n\nI think both are good. But ""ALONG"" tests A in the 1st, which we haven\'t tested, while ""PIANO"" tests A in the 3rd.\n\nSince we know A is not in the 2nd, we have two possibilities: 1st or 5th. So testing A in the 1st will help us narrow it down.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""ALONG"".\n\nBut wait, in ""ALONG"", we have A in the 1st and we know A is in the word. So if the correct position is 1st, we get a check. If not, we get a \'-\' and know it\'s in the 5th.\n\nAlso, we test L, O, G.\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""STAND"": S T A N D -> A in 3rd.\n\nBut I think testing A in the 1st is a good idea.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""ALONG"".\n\nBut let me see if there\'s a word that has A in the 5th and doesn\'t use forbidden letters. After some thought, I found ""PENNA"": P E N N A -> but E is not allowed (we know E is absent). So invalid.\n\n""JUNNA"": not common.\n\nSo ""ALONG"" seems good.\n\nBut note: we have to make sure the word is valid. ""ALONG"" is a valid word.\n\nSo second guess: ALONG\n\nBut let me compare with ""PIANO"". Both are valid.\n\nI think ""ALONG"" is better because it tests A in the 1st, which is a new position, and we get to test S and T which are very common.\n\nIn ""PIANO"", we test P, I, O.\n\nS and T are more common than P, I, O? Actually, S and T are very common.\n\nSo ""ALONG"" might be better.\n\nBut we also have to consider that we know N is in the 4th, so we are using that.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""ALONG"".\n\nBut wait, in ""ALONG"", we have O and G. We don\'t know about them.\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""SAINT"": S A I N T -> but the 4th is N? S (1st), A (2nd), I (3rd), N (4th), T (5th). But we know A is not in the 2nd! So we cannot put A in the 2nd. So ""SAINT"" is invalid because it has A in the 2nd.\n\nSo we must avoid putting A in the 2nd.\n\nTherefore, ""ALONG"" is good: A in 1st, which is not the 2nd.\n\nSimilarly, ""PLANT"" is good: A in 3rd (not 2nd).\n\nBut I think ""ALONG"" is a good choice.\n\nSo I\'ll go with that.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, and E are not in the word (marked with ""x"").\n- A is in the word but not in the 2nd position (marked with ""-"").\n- N is in the word and in the correct 4th position (marked with ""✓"").\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must have N in the 4th position.\n- A must be included but not in the 2nd position (so positions 1st, 3rd, or 5th are candidates).\n- Avoid using C, R, or E.\n- Test new common letters to gather more information.\n\nThe word ""along"" fits well:\n- A is in the 1st position (testing if A is in the 1st position).\n- N is in the 4th position (confirmed correct).\n- New letters: L, O, G (common consonants and a vowel).\n- Avoids C, R, E.\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the position of A and test three new letters.\n\n<guess>along</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: along -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(x) O(x) N(✓) G(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: - (in the word, but not in position 2)\n- N: ✓ (correct, in position 4)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: ""along""\n- A: ✓ (correct, in position 1)\n- L: x (not in the word)\n- O: x (not in the word)\n- N: ✓ (correct, in position 4)\n- G: ✓ (correct, in position 5)\n\nSo, from this, we know:\n\n1. The first letter is A (from ""along"" feedback: A✓).\n2. The fifth letter is G (from ""along"" feedback: G✓).\n3. The fourth letter is N (from both guesses).\n4. The letter A is in the word, and we now know it\'s in position 1. Also, we know from the first guess that A is not in position 2 (which we already used to our advantage).\n5. The following letters are not in the word: C, R, E, L, O.\n\nAlso, from the first guess, we had A in the word but not in position 2, and now we know it\'s in position 1.\n\nSo the current known information:\n- Position 1: A\n- Position 4: N\n- Position 5: G\n- The word is: A _ _ N G\n\nWe need to find the second and third letters.\n\nWe know the following letters are not in the word: C, R, E, L, O.\n\nWe have to choose a word that fits the pattern A _ _ N G and uses letters that are not excluded.\n\nWe also know that the word must be a valid English word.\n\nPossible letters for the second and third positions: we have to avoid C, R, E, L, O. So available letters: B, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we want to maximize information. Since we have two positions to guess, we can try to use common letters that we haven\'t tested yet.\n\nIn the first guess, we tested: C, R, A, N, E.\nIn the second guess, we tested: A, L, O, N, G.\n\nSo we have tested: A, C, E, L, N, O, R, G. But note:\n- A, N, G are in the word (A in pos1, N in pos4, G in pos5).\n- C, E, L, O, R are not in the word.\n\nTherefore, the remaining letters to test are: B, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need to form a word: A _ _ N G\n\nWe can try to think of common words that fit this pattern.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""AFTER"": but E and R are not allowed (R was already excluded in guess1, and E in guess1).\n- ""ALONG"": we already tried, and it had O and L which are now excluded.\n- ""AMONG"": A M O N G -> but O is excluded (from guess2: O x). So not allowed.\n- ""ASONG"": not a common word? And S is available, but let\'s see.\n- ""ATONG"": not a word.\n- ""AWING"": but the pattern is A _ _ N G, so the last letter must be G, not ""WING"". ""AWING"" ends with G? A W I N G -> positions: 1:A, 2:W, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> that fits. And W and I are not excluded.\n\nBut is ""AWING"" a word? Yes, meaning a type of bird or a verb meaning lifting device.\n\nBut we have to check if W and I are allowed. We haven\'t tested them, and they are not in the excluded list.\n\nExcluded: C, R, E, L, O.\n\nSo W and I are free.\n\nAnother possibility: ""AUNGY""?

But E is excluded.\n\n""ASSAY"": has S and S, but pattern: A S S A Y -> not matching.\n\nWe need the pattern: A _ _ N G.\n\nAnother word: ""ATOMS"": has O and M, but O is excluded, and it ends with S, not G.\n\n""AVOID"": has O and I, but O is excluded, and it doesn\'t end with G.\n\n""AWAKE"": has E and K, but E is excluded.\n\n""AWARD"": has R and D, but R is excluded.\n\n""AXING"": A X I N G -> X and I are available. ""AXING"" is a word (meaning to extract oil from ground).\n\nBut X is not very common.\n\n""AZING"": not a word.\n\n""ABACU"": not matching.\n\n""ABYSS"": not matching.\n\n""ADAPT"": has D and P, but pattern: A D A P T -> doesn\'t match because we need N in the 4th and G in the 5th.\n\nWe need the 4th to be N and 5th to be G.\n\nSo the word must end with ""NG"" after the third letter? No: the pattern is A _ _ N G, so the last two letters are ""NG"", with the 4th as N and 5th as G.\n\nSo the word is A ? ? N G.\n\nNow, ""AWING"" is A W I N G -> positions: 1:A, 2:W, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> fits.\n\nAlso, ""AXING"": A X I N G -> fits.\n\nBut ""AWING"" is more common? Or ""AXING"".\n\nWe can also consider ""AMONG"" but O is excluded.\n\nAnother: ""ALONG"" we tried.\n\nWhat about ""AUNGY""? Not a word.\n\n""ABHNG""? Not a word.\n\n""ADHNG""? Not a word.\n\n""AFNG""? Not a word.\n\n""AGNG""? Not a word.\n\n""AING""? Not a word.\n\n""ALNG""? Not a word.\n\n""AMNG""? Not a word.\n\n""APNG""? Not a word.\n\n""ARNG""? Has R -> not allowed.\n\n""ASNG""? Not a word.\n\n""ATNG""? Not a word.\n\n""AVNG""? Not a word.\n\n""AWNG""? Not a word.\n\n""AXNG""? Not a word.\n\n""AZNG""? Not a word.\n\nSo ""AWING"" and ""AXING"" are candidates.\n\nBut ""AXING"" might be less common.\n\nAnother possibility: ""AHING"": not a word.\n\n""AKING"": not a word.\n\n""ALING"": not a word.\n\n""AMING"": not a word.\n\n""APING"": not a word.\n\n""ARING"": has R -> not allowed.\n\n""ASHING"": too long.\n\n""AToning"": too long.\n\nWe might have to consider that the word might be ""AWING"" or ""AXING"", or perhaps I missed a word.\n\nWhat about ""AUNGY""? Not standard.\n\nOr ""ABYSS"" but doesn\'t fit.\n\nAnother idea: ""ATOMS"" doesn\'t end with G.\n\n""AVOID"" doesn\'t end with G.\n\n""AXIOM"": has O and M, but O is excluded, and pattern: A X I O M -> doesn\'t end with G.\n\nWe need the last two to be ""NG"", with N at 4 and G at 5.\n\nSo the word is A ? ? N G.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""AWING"" (as above)\n- ""AXING"" (as above)\n- ""ADWING"": A D W I N G -> but that\'s 6 letters? No, ""ADWING"" is 6 letters. We need 5 letters.\n\n""ADWING"" is 6 letters. So no.\n\n""ABHING"": not 5 letters.\n\n""ABYING"": not common, and byings are 5? A B Y I N G -> 6 letters.\n\n""ABYSS"" doesn\'t fit.\n\n""ACING"": has C -> excluded.\n\n""ADZING"": not a word.\n\n""AFRIT"": has R and F, but R excluded.\n\nI think ""AWING"" and ""AXING"" are the main options.\n\nBut ""AXING"" might be considered a verb, but ""AWING"" is more common.\n\nAnother word: ""AERIE"" has E and doesn\'t end with G.\n\n""AGAPE"" has E and doesn\'t end with G.\n\nWe might have to consider that the word is ""AWING"" or ""AXING"", or perhaps I missed ""AMONG"" but O is excluded.\n\nWhat about ""ALONG""? We tried and it had O and L which are excluded.\n\nSo the only common words I can think of are ""AWING"" and ""AXING"".\n\nBut let me confirm: \n- ""AWING"": A, W, I, N, G -> positions: 1:A, 2:W, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> fits the pattern.\n\n""AXING"": A, X, I, N, G -> same pattern.\n\nWe also have ""AUNGY"" but not standard.\n\nOr ""ABHNG"" no.\n\nSo between ""AWING"" and ""AXING"", which one to choose?\n\nWe want to test letters that are common. W, I, X.\n\nI is a vowel, and W is a consonant. X is less common.\n\nWe might also consider that we have two positions to fill: 2nd and 3rd.\n\nWe can choose a word that uses two new letters to test both at once.\n\nBut we have to make a guess that might be the word.\n\nSince we have two possibilities, we can choose one.\n\nBut note: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 3. So we can try one.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of other words that fit the pattern.\n\nWhat about ""AHING""? Not a word.\n\n""AKING"": not a word.\n\n""ALING"": not a word.\n\n""AMING"": not a word.\n\n""APING"": not a word.\n\n""ARING"": has R -> not allowed.\n\n""ASHING"": too long.\n\n""ATING"": not a word.\n\n""AVING"": not a word.\n\n""AWING"" and ""AXING"" are the only common ones.\n\nBut there\'s also ""ABHNG"" no.\n\nAnother: ""ADZING"": not a word.\n\n""AEING"": not a word, and has E.\n\n""AGREE"": has E and doesn\'t end with G.\n\nI think we have to choose between ""AWING"" and ""AXING"".\n\nBut let me check: ""AWING"" is a valid word, and ""AXING"" is also valid (meaning to extract oil).\n\nBut we might also consider that the word could be ""AUNGY"" but it\'s not standard, so probably not.\n\nOr ""ABYSS"" doesn\'t fit.\n\nAnother idea: ""ATOMS"" is A T O M S -> no, ends with S.\n\n""AVOID"" ends with D.\n\nWe need to end with ""NG"" for the last three letters? No: the pattern is A ? ? N G, so the last three are ? ? N G.\n\nSo the word is A _ _ N G.\n\nNow, the second and third letters can be various.\n\nWe can also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have any indication of duplicates so far.\n\nWe have to guess one.\n\nLet me see which one to pick. Since we have to test letters, we can choose ""AWING"" because W and I are more common than X.\n\nBut X is very common in words? Not really.\n\nWe can also consider that in the first guess, we had A in the word (not position 2) and now we know it\'s position 1. We also know N is position 4 and G is position 5.\n\nSo the word is A ? ? N G.\n\nNow, for the third guess, we can try ""AWING"".\n\nIf it\'s not, then we try ""AXING"".\n\nBut we have two guesses left? We are on guess 3, so we have 4,5,6 left. But we might solve it in three.\n\nSo let\'s try ""AWING"".\n\nBut we have to make a guess.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of other words.\n\nWhat about ""AUNGY""? I think it\'s not standard, so avoid.\n\nOr ""ABHNG"" no.\n\nAnother word: ""ADWING"" is 6 letters.\n\n""ADZING"": not a word.\n\n""AFRIT"": has R.\n\nI think we have to go with ""AWING"" or ""AXING"".\n\nBut let me search my memory: \n- ""AWING"": yes.\n- ""AXING"": yes.\n\nBut ""AXING"" might be less common. Also, X is a high-frequency letter in English? Not really.\n\nWe can also consider ""AHING"" but not a word.\n\nOr ""AKING"" not a word.\n\nI think we should try ""AWING"".\n\nBut note: we have to avoid using letters that are excluded. W and I are not excluded.\n\nSo let\'s guess ""AWING"".\n\nBut wait, in ""AWING"", the third letter is I. We don\'t know about I.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that uses two new letters that are common.\n\nBut we have to fit the pattern.\n\nAnother word: ""AUNGY"" is not standard, so I\'ll skip.\n\nOr ""ABYSS"" doesn\'t fit.\n\nI think ""AWING"" is a good guess.\n\nBut let me see if there\'s a word that uses more common letters.\n\nWhat about ""STING"": but S is available, but the pattern is A _ _ N G, so it must start with A. ""STING"" starts with S.\n\nWe need A at the start.\n\nSo only words that start with A and end with ""NG"" after the third letter? Actually, the pattern is A ? ? N G, so the last three letters are the third letter, then the fourth is N, fifth is G.\n\nSo the word is A _ X N G, where X is the third letter.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""AWING"" (with X=I, W=2nd)\n- ""AXING"" (with X=I, X=2nd)\n\nBut ""AXING"" has X in the second position and I in the third.\n\nWe can also consider ""ADZING"" not a word.\n\n""AEING"" not a word.\n\n""AGREE"" not ending with G.\n\nI think we have to choose one.\n\nSince we have to, let\'s pick ""AWING"".\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that we are not missing something.\n\nAnother word: ""AUNGY"" is not standard, so I\'ll exclude it.\n\nOr ""ABHNG"" no.\n\nPerhaps ""ABHOR"" but has O and R, excluded.\n\nSo I think ""AWING"" is a valid guess.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""AWING"".\n\nBut let me double-check the pattern: \n- Position 1: A (we know is correct)\n- Position 2: W (to test)\n- Position 3: I (to test)\n- Position 4: N (correct)\n- Position 5: G (correct)\n\nIf the word is ""AWING"", then we get it right.\n\nIf not, we get feedback on W and I.\n\nIf W is not in the word or not in position, we know.\n\nSimilarly for I.\n\nBut we have two positions to fill, so we might get more information.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has different letters to cover more ground, but we are constrained by the pattern.\n\nFor example, we could try ""AXING"" to test X and I.\n\nBut I think ""AWING"" is more common.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""AWING"".\n\nBut wait, what about ""AUNGY""? It\'s not standard, but let\'s assume we are not limited to common words? Actually, we must use valid English words.\n\n""AUNGY"" is not in standard dictionaries.\n\nSo I think ""AWING"" is a good choice.\n\nTherefore, the third guess is ""AWING"".\n\nBut let me see if there\'s a word like ""ADNEX""? Not a word.\n\nOr ""AEDES"" has E and doesn\'t end with G.\n\nI think we have to go with it.\n\nSo the guess is ""AWING"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(✓), E(x)  \n  - This reveals:  \n    - N is in the word and in the correct position (4th).  \n    - A is in the word but not in the 2nd position.  \n    - C, R, and E are not in the word.  \n\n- **Guess 2: along** → Feedback: A(✓), L(x), O(x), N(✓), G(✓)  \n  - This reveals:  \n    - A is in the correct position (1st).  \n    - G is in the correct position (5th).  \n    - L and O are not in the word.  \n    - N is confirmed again in the 4th position.  \n\n### Current Knowledge:\n- **Confirmed positions**:  \n  - Position 1: A  \n  - Position 4: N  \n  - Position 5: G  \n  - The word pattern is: **A _ _ N G**  \n- **Excluded letters**: C, R, E, L, O (not in the word).  \n- **Unknown positions**: 2nd and 3rd letters.  \n- **Available letters**: All letters except excluded ones (C, R, E, L, O). Common options include B, D, F, H, I, M, P, S, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- We need to test possible letters for the 2nd and 3rd positions.  \n- The word must be valid and fit the pattern **A _ _ N G**.  \n- After evaluating options (e.g., ""AWING"", ""AXING""), ""AWING"" is chosen because:  \n  - It tests W in the 2nd position and I in the 3rd position.  \n  - W and I are common letters not yet tested.  \n  - ""AWING"" is a common English word (meaning a type of bird or a verb meaning inspiration).  \n- If incorrect, the feedback will reveal if W or I are in the word and their positions, narrowing down possibilities for the next guess.\n\n<guess>awing</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: along -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(x) O(x) N(✓) G(✓)\nGuess 3: awing -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) W(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from the third guess ""awing"":
- A: ✓ (correct position, which we already knew from guess 2)
- W: x (not in the word)
- I: ✓ (correct position! So I is in the word and in the 3rd position)
- N: ✓ (correct position, as before)
- G: ✓ (correct position, as before)

So now we know:
- Position 1: A (from guess 2 and 3)
- Position 3: I (from guess 3: I is correct and in the 3rd position)
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: G
- The word pattern is: A _ I N G

We also know that W is not in the word (from guess 3).

Additionally, from previous guesses, we know that C, R, E, L, O are not in the word.

So the word is A ? I N G, and the missing letter is the 2nd position.

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with A, has I in the 3rd, N in the 4th, and G in the 5th. The 2nd letter is unknown.

The word must be of the form: A X I N G, where X is a letter not in the excluded set.

Excluded letters: C, R, E, L, O, W (from guess 3: W is x).

Available letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.

We need to find a valid English word that fits: A _ I N G.

Possible words:
- ""AMING"": not a word.
- ""APING"": not a word.
- ""ARING"": has R -> not allowed.
- ""AING"": not a word (but ""AING"" is a word? It's the third person singular of ""ain"", but it's 4 letters. We need 5 letters.)

Actually, 5-letter words:
- ""ABING"": not a word.
- ""ADING"": not a word.
- ""AFING"": not a word.
- ""AHING"": not a word.
- ""AIING"": not a word.
- ""AKING"": not a word.
- ""ALING"": not a word.
- ""AMING"": not a word.
- ""APING"": not a word.
- ""ARING"": has R -> not allowed.
- ""ATING"": not a word? ""Ting"" is a suffix, but ""ating"" is not a word.
- ""AWING"": we tried, and W is not in the word, so not that.
- ""AXING"": we tried, and X is not in the word? In guess 3, we had ""awing"" which had W and I, and W was x, but I was ✓. So ""axing"" would be A X I N G, but X is the second letter.

But is ""axing"" a word? Yes, meaning to extract oil.

But we just tried ""awing"" and W is not in the word, so ""axing"" would have X in the second position. We don't know about X.

But in guess 3, we tested W and I. W was absent, but I was present and in the correct position (3rd).

So for ""axing"": 
- A: position 1 (should be A, so ✓)
- X: position 2 (unknown)
- I: position 3 (should be I, so ✓)
- N: position 4 (✓)
- G: position 5 (✓)

But we know from guess 3 that I is in the 3rd position, so it would be ✓.

But we need to test the second position.

Similarly, other words: 
- ""ADZING"": not a word.
- ""AEING"": not a word, and has E.
- ""AGREE"": has E and doesn't end with G.

But ""axing"" is a valid word.

Another word: ""AUNGY"" is not standard.

Or ""ABYSS"" doesn't fit.

What about ""ATOMS""? But it ends with S, not G.

We need the pattern A ? I N G.

So possible words:
- ""AXING"": A X I N G
- ""AWING"": but W is excluded now, so not possible.
- ""AMING"": not a word.
- ""APING"": not a word.
- ""ARING"": has R -> not allowed.

But ""axing"" is a word.

Another word: ""AIZING""? Not a word.

""AZING"": not a word.

""ABZING"": not a word.

""ADZING"": not a word.

""AFRIT"": has R.

I think ""axing"" is the only common word that fits.

But let me confirm: 
- ""AXING"": A (1st), X (2nd), I (3rd), N (4th), G (5th). 
- We know A, I, N, G are in the word and in these positions. 
- X is the only unknown.

We haven't tested X before, and it's not excluded.

So the word must be ""axing"".

But we are to make a guess, so we can guess ""axing"".

But note: we have to make sure that X is not excluded. It hasn't been tested, so it could be in the word or not. But in this case, we think it must be ""axing"" because other options are not words.

But let me double-check: 
- ""AUNGY"" is not standard.
- ""ABHNG"" no.
- ""ADWING"" is 6 letters.
- ""AEING"" has E and is not 5 letters? ""AEING"" is 5 letters? E-I-N-G? No, ""AEING"" is A-E-I-N-G, which is 5 letters? A(1), E(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). But E is excluded (from guess1: E x). So E is not allowed. So ""aeing"" has E, which is excluded. Therefore, not possible.

Similarly, ""adzing"" is not a word.

So ""axing"" is the only common word that fits the pattern and avoids excluded letters.

Therefore, we should guess ""axing"".

But note: we have to consider that the word might be ""axing"".

Alternatively, we can think of ""ating"" but it's not a word.

Or ""ajing"": not a word.

I think we have to go with ""axing"".

So the fourth guess is ""axing"".

But let me make sure: 
- Position 1: A (should be A) -> we expect ✓.
- Position 2: X (unknown) -> we hope it's X, but we are testing it.
- Position 3: I (should be I) -> ✓.
- Position 4: N -> ✓.
- Position 5: G -> ✓.

If the word is ""axing"", then we get all ✓.

If not, then we get feedback that X is not in the word, and then we can try other letters.

But what other letters could it be? We have to find a word that is A ? I N G.

We already considered ""axing"", and I think it's the only common word.

But let me think: 
- ""ABYSS"" is A B Y S S -> doesn't fit.
- ""ADMIT"": has D and M, but pattern: A D M I T -> 4th is T, not N -> no.
- ""ADORE"": has O and E -> excluded.

I think ""axing"" is the only possibility.

But there's also ""AUNGY"", but it's not standard.

Or ""ABHNG"" no.

So I think we should guess ""axing"".

Therefore, the fourth guess is ""axing"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(✓), E(x)  
  - Revealed:  
    - N is in position 4.  
    - A is in the word but not in position 2.  
    - C, R, E are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: along** → Feedback: A(✓), L(x), O(x), N(✓), G(✓)  
  - Revealed:  
    - A is in position 1 (correct).  
    - G is in position 5 (correct).  
    - L and O are not in the word.  
    - N is confirmed in position 4.  

- **Guess 3: awing** → Feedback: A(✓), W(x), I(✓), N(✓), G(✓)  
  - Revealed:  
    - I is in position 3 (correct).  
    - W is not in the word.  
    - N and G are reconfirmed in positions 4 and 5.  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Confirmed positions**:  
  - Position 1: A  
  - Position 3: I  
  - Position 4: N  
  - Position 5: G  
  - The word pattern is: **A _ I N G** (only position 2 is unknown).  
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, E, L, O, W (not in the word).  
- **Unknown position**: 2nd letter must be a letter not excluded (available: B, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z).  
- **Possible words**: The only common English word fitting **A _ I N G** is **AXING** (meaning to extract oil). Other combinations (e.g., ""ading"", ""fing"", ""sing"") are not valid 5-letter words in this context.  

### Reasoning:
- **AXING** is the only common word that matches the pattern and avoids excluded letters.  
- All other possibilities (e.g., ""aming"", ""aping"", ""ringing"") are invalid:  
  - ""aming"" → Not a valid word.  
  - ""aping"" → Not a valid word.  
  - ""ringing"" → 6 letters.  
- **AXING** uses X in position 2, which is untested and not excluded.  

### Next Guess:
Given that **AXING** is the only feasible word, it must be the solution. Feedback will confirm all positions if correct.

<guess>axing</guess>",axing,"We have the feedback from the third guess ""awing"":
- A: ✓ (correct position, which we already knew from guess 2)
- W: x (not in the word)
- I: ✓ (correct position! So I is in the word and in the 3rd position)
- N: ✓ (correct position, as before)
- G: ✓ (correct position, as before)

So now we know:
- Position 1: A (from guess 2 and 3)
- Position 3: I (from guess 3: I is correct and in the 3rd position)
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: G
- The word pattern is: A _ I N G

We also know that W is not in the word (from guess 3).

Additionally, from previous guesses, we know that C, R, E, L, O are not in the word.

So the word is A ? I N G, and the missing letter is the 2nd position.

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with A, has I in the 3rd, N in the 4th, and G in the 5th. The 2nd letter is unknown.

The word must be of the form: A X I N G, where X is a letter not in the excluded set.

Excluded letters: C, R, E, L, O, W (from guess 3: W is x).

Available letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.

We need to find a valid English word that fits: A _ I N G.

Possible words:
- ""AMING"": not a word.
- ""APING"": not a word.
- ""ARING"": has R -> not allowed.
- ""AING"": not a word (but ""AING"" is a word? It's the third person singular of ""ain"", but it's 4 letters. We need 5 letters.)

Actually, 5-letter words:
- ""ABING"": not a word.
- ""ADING"": not a word.
- ""AFING"": not a word.
- ""AHING"": not a word.
- ""AIING"": not a word.
- ""AKING"": not a word.
- ""ALING"": not a word.
- ""AMING"": not a word.
- ""APING"": not a word.
- ""ARING"": has R -> not allowed.
- ""ATING"": not a word? ""Ting"" is a suffix, but ""ating"" is not a word.
- ""AWING"": we tried, and W is not in the word, so not that.
- ""AXING"": we tried, and X is not in the word? In guess 3, we had ""awing"" which had W and I, and W was x, but I was ✓. So ""axing"" would be A X I N G, but X is the second letter.

But is ""axing"" a word? Yes, meaning to extract oil.

But we just tried ""awing"" and W is not in the word, so ""axing"" would have X in the second position. We don't know about X.

But in guess 3, we tested W and I. W was absent, but I was present and in the correct position (3rd).

So for ""axing"": 
- A: position 1 (should be A, so ✓)
- X: position 2 (unknown)
- I: position 3 (should be I, so ✓)
- N: position 4 (✓)
- G: position 5 (✓)

But we know from guess 3 that I is in the 3rd position, so it would be ✓.

But we need to test the second position.

Similarly, other words: 
- ""ADZING"": not a word.
- ""AEING"": not a word, and has E.
- ""AGREE"": has E and doesn't end with G.

But ""axing"" is a valid word.

Another word: ""AUNGY"" is not standard.

Or ""ABYSS"" doesn't fit.

What about ""ATOMS""? But it ends with S, not G.

We need the pattern A ? I N G.

So possible words:
- ""AXING"": A X I N G
- ""AWING"": but W is excluded now, so not possible.
- ""AMING"": not a word.
- ""APING"": not a word.
- ""ARING"": has R -> not allowed.

But ""axing"" is a word.

Another word: ""AIZING""? Not a word.

""AZING"": not a word.

""ABZING"": not a word.

""ADZING"": not a word.

""AFRIT"": has R.

I think ""axing"" is the only common word that fits.

But let me confirm: 
- ""AXING"": A (1st), X (2nd), I (3rd), N (4th), G (5th). 
- We know A, I, N, G are in the word and in these positions. 
- X is the only unknown.

We haven't tested X before, and it's not excluded.

So the word must be ""axing"".

But we are to make a guess, so we can guess ""axing"".

But note: we have to make sure that X is not excluded. It hasn't been tested, so it could be in the word or not. But in this case, we think it must be ""axing"" because other options are not words.

But let me double-check: 
- ""AUNGY"" is not standard.
- ""ABHNG"" no.
- ""ADWING"" is 6 letters.
- ""AEING"" has E and is not 5 letters? ""AEING"" is 5 letters? E-I-N-G? No, ""AEING"" is A-E-I-N-G, which is 5 letters? A(1), E(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). But E is excluded (from guess1: E x). So E is not allowed. So ""aeing"" has E, which is excluded. Therefore, not possible.

Similarly, ""adzing"" is not a word.

So ""axing"" is the only common word that fits the pattern and avoids excluded letters.

Therefore, we should guess ""axing"".

But note: we have to consider that the word might be ""axing"".

Alternatively, we can think of ""ating"" but it's not a word.

Or ""ajing"": not a word.

I think we have to go with ""axing"".

So the fourth guess is ""axing"".

But let me make sure: 
- Position 1: A (should be A) -> we expect ✓.
- Position 2: X (unknown) -> we hope it's X, but we are testing it.
- Position 3: I (should be I) -> ✓.
- Position 4: N -> ✓.
- Position 5: G -> ✓.

If the word is ""axing"", then we get all ✓.

If not, then we get feedback that X is not in the word, and then we can try other letters.

But what other letters could it be? We have to find a word that is A ? I N G.

We already considered ""axing"", and I think it's the only common word.

But let me think: 
- ""ABYSS"" is A B Y S S -> doesn't fit.
- ""ADMIT"": has D and M, but pattern: A D M I T -> 4th is T, not N -> no.
- ""ADORE"": has O and E -> excluded.

I think ""axing"" is the only possibility.

But there's also ""AUNGY"", but it's not standard.

Or ""ABHNG"" no.

So I think we should guess ""axing"".

Therefore, the fourth guess is ""axing"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(✓), E(x)  
  - Revealed:  
    - N is in position 4.  
    - A is in the word but not in position 2.  
    - C, R, E are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: along** → Feedback: A(✓), L(x), O(x), N(✓), G(✓)  
  - Revealed:  
    - A is in position 1 (correct).  
    - G is in position 5 (correct).  
    - L and O are not in the word.  
    - N is confirmed in position 4.  

- **Guess 3: awing** → Feedback: A(✓), W(x), I(✓), N(✓), G(✓)  
  - Revealed:  
    - I is in position 3 (correct).  
    - W is not in the word.  
    - N and G are reconfirmed in positions 4 and 5.  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Confirmed positions**:  
  - Position 1: A  
  - Position 3: I  
  - Position 4: N  
  - Position 5: G  
  - The word pattern is: **A _ I N G** (only position 2 is unknown).  
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, E, L, O, W (not in the word).  
- **Unknown position**: 2nd letter must be a letter not excluded (available: B, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z).  
- **Possible words**: The only common English word fitting **A _ I N G** is **AXING** (meaning to extract oil). Other combinations (e.g., ""ading"", ""fing"", ""sing"") are not valid 5-letter words in this context.  

### Reasoning:
- **AXING** is the only common word that matches the pattern and avoids excluded letters.  
- All other possibilities (e.g., ""aming"", ""aping"", ""ringing"") are invalid:  
  - ""aming"" → Not a valid word.  
  - ""aping"" → Not a valid word.  
  - ""ringing"" → 6 letters.  
- **AXING** uses X in position 2, which is untested and not excluded.  

### Next Guess:
Given that **AXING** is the only feasible word, it must be the solution. Feedback will confirm all positions if correct.",Guess 4: axing -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) X(✓) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓),SUCCESS
