We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: ✓ (correct position, so the secret word has A in the 3rd position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word has the letter A in the 3rd position.
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

 Since R and E are not in the word, and we know the word has A in the 3rd position, we can try to form a new word.

 We must avoid using C, R, N, E.

 Let's think of common 5-letter words that have A in the 3rd position.

 The pattern is: _ _ A _ _

 We have to choose letters that are not C, R, N, E.

 We can consider using other common consonants and vowels.

 Since we have eliminated 4 letters (C, R, N, E), we have plenty of options.

 Let's try to think of words that have A in the 3rd position.

 Some examples: 
   ""PLAIT"" -> but we don't know if P, L, I, T are in the word? But we can use them because they are not eliminated.
   ""BLAST"" -> but B, L, S, T are not eliminated, but note that we have A in the 3rd.

 However, we must avoid using the eliminated letters: C, R, N, E.

 Let's list some words with A in the 3rd position and without C, R, N, E:

   ""BALMY"" -> B, A, L, M, Y -> but we don't know about B, L, M, Y.
   ""PALMS"" -> P, A, L, M, S -> again, no C, R, N, E.

 But note: we want to maximize information. We should try to include common letters that we haven't tested yet.

 We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We can try to use a word that has multiple common letters.

 Let's consider ""SLATE"": 
   S, L, A, T, E -> but E is eliminated! We cannot use E.

 So avoid E.

 Another word: ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T -> no eliminated letters? 
   P, L, A, I, T: A is in the 3rd, and we are avoiding C, R, N, E. So this is acceptable.

 But we don't know if the word has P, L, I, T.

 Alternatively, ""BLAST"": B, L, A, S, T -> also acceptable.

 However, note that we have only 6 tries, so we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let's choose a word that has distinct letters and covers common ones.

 I'll go with ""PLAIT"" because it has P, L, I, T which are common.

 But wait, we have to make sure it's a valid word.

 Alternatively, we can use ""STAMP"": S, T, A, M, P -> but A is in the 3rd? 
   S (1st), T (2nd), A (3rd), M (4th), P (5th). Yes.

 But note: we are avoiding E, and STAMP doesn't have E. Also, no C, R, N.

 However, we already know A is in the 3rd, so we can use that.

 But let me check: we have eliminated C, R, N, E. So we can use any other letters.

 Another common word: ""SHALT"" -> but that might be archaic? We should use common words.

 Let's stick with common words.

 I think ""PLAIT"" is a good candidate because it has two vowels (A and I) and three consonants (P, L, T) that we haven't tried.

 But note: we have already eliminated E, so the word might have other vowels? Like O, U, I?

 We can also consider ""OPALE"" but that has E which is eliminated.

 Another word: ""QUAIL"" -> Q, U, A, I, L -> but Q and U are less common? And we have A in the 3rd.

 But we want to test more common letters.

 Let me think of words that have S, T, L, and other common letters.

 ""SLANT"" -> but N is eliminated! We cannot use N.

 So avoid N.

 ""SLATE"" is out because of E.

 ""PLAIT"" seems okay.

 Alternatively, ""BLIMP"": B, L, I, M, P -> but no A? We must have A in the 3rd.

 So we must choose a word that has A in the 3rd.

 Let me list: 
   ""ABACK"" -> but A is in the 1st? We need A in the 3rd.

 So the word must be: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5]

 We can use: 
   ""PLAIT: P L A I T -> positions: 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:I, 5:T
   ""BLAST: B L A S T -> 1:B, 2:L, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T
   ""STAMP: S T A M P -> 1:S, 2:T, 3:A, 4:M, 5:P
   ""SHARD: S H A R D -> but R is eliminated! So we cannot use R.
   ""SHALT: S H A L T -> 1:S, 2:H, 3:A, 4:L, 5:T -> but is it common? Maybe.

 We can also consider ""GLASS"" -> but that has two S's and we don't know about S and G. Also, A is in the 3rd? 
   G L A S S -> 1:G, 2:L, 3:A, 4:S, 5:S -> but we have two S's. It's valid, but we might get less information because of duplicate letters.

 We want to test as many new letters as possible, so distinct letters are better.

 So ""PLAIT"" has distinct letters: P, L, A, I, T -> all distinct.

 Similarly, ""BLAST"" has B, L, A, S, T -> distinct.

 ""STAMP"" has S, T, A, M, P -> distinct.

 I think ""STAMP"" is a good choice because it has S, T, M, P which are very common.

 But note: we already know A is in the 3rd, so we are testing S, T, M, P in positions 1,2,4,5.

 Alternatively, we can use ""PAINT"" -> but N is eliminated and T is at the end? 
   P A I N T -> but we need A in the 3rd? This has A in the 2nd. So not.

 We must have the 3rd letter as A.

 Another word: ""FAULT"" -> F A U L T -> A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd.

 So let's choose between ""PLAIT"" and ""STAMP"".

 I think ""STAMP"" is more common and has more common letters.

 But note: we have eliminated E, so the word might have O, U, I, O? 

 We can also consider ""DAILY"": D A I L Y -> A is in the 2nd? No.

 We need the 3rd to be A.

 Let me think of words: 
   ""BEADY"" -> B E A D Y -> but E is eliminated! So we cannot use E.

   ""HEADY"" -> H E A D Y -> E is eliminated.

   ""LEAVE"" -> has E and also V? But E is eliminated.

 So avoid E.

 Another: ""QUAKE"" -> Q U A K E -> E is eliminated.

 So we avoid E.

 After some thought, I'll go with ""STAMP"".

 But wait, we have to make sure that we are not using any eliminated letters: 
   S, T, A, M, P -> none of C, R, N, E. So it's okay.

 Alternatively, we can use ""SLACK"" -> but C is eliminated? Yes, C is eliminated. So we cannot use C.

 So ""STAMP"" is safe.

 Let me check: 
   S: not tested yet
   T: not tested
   A: we know is in the word and in the 3rd position (so we expect a check for A, but we are testing the position)
   M: not tested
   P: not tested

 This will give us information about S, T, M, P.

 Alternatively, we can use ""PLAIT"" to test P, L, I, T.

 But I think ""STAMP"" is a good choice because S and T are very common at the beginning or the end.

 Since we know A is fixed in the 3rd, we can try to cover the other positions.

 I'll go with ""STAMP"".

 So the next guess: ""STAMP""

 But note: the feedback for A will be ✓ because we know it's in the 3rd. So we are mainly testing the other letters.

 Let me write the guess: STAMP

 However, note that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't know.

 We are hoping to get feedback on S, T, M, P.

 If we get a ✓ for A, then we know it's still in the 3rd (which we already know) and we get feedback on the others.

 So let's go with ""STAMP"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- A is confirmed in the 3rd position (✓).
- C, R, N, E are eliminated (x).

For the next guess:
- Must have A in the 3rd position.
- Avoid using C, R, N, E.
- Prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, M, P, L, I) to maximize information.

I chose **STAMP** because:
- It places A in the 3rd position.
- Tests new common letters: S, T, M, P.
- Avoids eliminated letters (C, R, N, E).
- Uses distinct letters to cover more possibilities.

<guess>stamp</guess>",stamp,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":

 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: ✓ (correct position, so the secret word has A in the 3rd position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word has the letter A in the 3rd position.
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

 Since R and E are not in the word, and we know the word has A in the 3rd position, we can try to form a new word.

 We must avoid using C, R, N, E.

 Let's think of common 5-letter words that have A in the 3rd position.

 The pattern is: _ _ A _ _

 We have to choose letters that are not C, R, N, E.

 We can consider using other common consonants and vowels.

 Since we have eliminated 4 letters (C, R, N, E), we have plenty of options.

 Let's try to think of words that have A in the 3rd position.

 Some examples: 
   ""PLAIT"" -> but we don't know if P, L, I, T are in the word? But we can use them because they are not eliminated.
   ""BLAST"" -> but B, L, S, T are not eliminated, but note that we have A in the 3rd.

 However, we must avoid using the eliminated letters: C, R, N, E.

 Let's list some words with A in the 3rd position and without C, R, N, E:

   ""BALMY"" -> B, A, L, M, Y -> but we don't know about B, L, M, Y.
   ""PALMS"" -> P, A, L, M, S -> again, no C, R, N, E.

 But note: we want to maximize information. We should try to include common letters that we haven't tested yet.

 We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We can try to use a word that has multiple common letters.

 Let's consider ""SLATE"": 
   S, L, A, T, E -> but E is eliminated! We cannot use E.

 So avoid E.

 Another word: ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T -> no eliminated letters? 
   P, L, A, I, T: A is in the 3rd, and we are avoiding C, R, N, E. So this is acceptable.

 But we don't know if the word has P, L, I, T.

 Alternatively, ""BLAST"": B, L, A, S, T -> also acceptable.

 However, note that we have only 6 tries, so we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let's choose a word that has distinct letters and covers common ones.

 I'll go with ""PLAIT"" because it has P, L, I, T which are common.

 But wait, we have to make sure it's a valid word.

 Alternatively, we can use ""STAMP"": S, T, A, M, P -> but A is in the 3rd? 
   S (1st), T (2nd), A (3rd), M (4th), P (5th). Yes.

 But note: we are avoiding E, and STAMP doesn't have E. Also, no C, R, N.

 However, we already know A is in the 3rd, so we can use that.

 But let me check: we have eliminated C, R, N, E. So we can use any other letters.

 Another common word: ""SHALT"" -> but that might be archaic? We should use common words.

 Let's stick with common words.

 I think ""PLAIT"" is a good candidate because it has two vowels (A and I) and three consonants (P, L, T) that we haven't tried.

 But note: we have already eliminated E, so the word might have other vowels? Like O, U, I?

 We can also consider ""OPALE"" but that has E which is eliminated.

 Another word: ""QUAIL"" -> Q, U, A, I, L -> but Q and U are less common? And we have A in the 3rd.

 But we want to test more common letters.

 Let me think of words that have S, T, L, and other common letters.

 ""SLANT"" -> but N is eliminated! We cannot use N.

 So avoid N.

 ""SLATE"" is out because of E.

 ""PLAIT"" seems okay.

 Alternatively, ""BLIMP"": B, L, I, M, P -> but no A? We must have A in the 3rd.

 So we must choose a word that has A in the 3rd.

 Let me list: 
   ""ABACK"" -> but A is in the 1st? We need A in the 3rd.

 So the word must be: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5]

 We can use: 
   ""PLAIT: P L A I T -> positions: 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:I, 5:T
   ""BLAST: B L A S T -> 1:B, 2:L, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T
   ""STAMP: S T A M P -> 1:S, 2:T, 3:A, 4:M, 5:P
   ""SHARD: S H A R D -> but R is eliminated! So we cannot use R.
   ""SHALT: S H A L T -> 1:S, 2:H, 3:A, 4:L, 5:T -> but is it common? Maybe.

 We can also consider ""GLASS"" -> but that has two S's and we don't know about S and G. Also, A is in the 3rd? 
   G L A S S -> 1:G, 2:L, 3:A, 4:S, 5:S -> but we have two S's. It's valid, but we might get less information because of duplicate letters.

 We want to test as many new letters as possible, so distinct letters are better.

 So ""PLAIT"" has distinct letters: P, L, A, I, T -> all distinct.

 Similarly, ""BLAST"" has B, L, A, S, T -> distinct.

 ""STAMP"" has S, T, A, M, P -> distinct.

 I think ""STAMP"" is a good choice because it has S, T, M, P which are very common.

 But note: we already know A is in the 3rd, so we are testing S, T, M, P in positions 1,2,4,5.

 Alternatively, we can use ""PAINT"" -> but N is eliminated and T is at the end? 
   P A I N T -> but we need A in the 3rd? This has A in the 2nd. So not.

 We must have the 3rd letter as A.

 Another word: ""FAULT"" -> F A U L T -> A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd.

 So let's choose between ""PLAIT"" and ""STAMP"".

 I think ""STAMP"" is more common and has more common letters.

 But note: we have eliminated E, so the word might have O, U, I, O? 

 We can also consider ""DAILY"": D A I L Y -> A is in the 2nd? No.

 We need the 3rd to be A.

 Let me think of words: 
   ""BEADY"" -> B E A D Y -> but E is eliminated! So we cannot use E.

   ""HEADY"" -> H E A D Y -> E is eliminated.

   ""LEAVE"" -> has E and also V? But E is eliminated.

 So avoid E.

 Another: ""QUAKE"" -> Q U A K E -> E is eliminated.

 So we avoid E.

 After some thought, I'll go with ""STAMP"".

 But wait, we have to make sure that we are not using any eliminated letters: 
   S, T, A, M, P -> none of C, R, N, E. So it's okay.

 Alternatively, we can use ""SLACK"" -> but C is eliminated? Yes, C is eliminated. So we cannot use C.

 So ""STAMP"" is safe.

 Let me check: 
   S: not tested yet
   T: not tested
   A: we know is in the word and in the 3rd position (so we expect a check for A, but we are testing the position)
   M: not tested
   P: not tested

 This will give us information about S, T, M, P.

 Alternatively, we can use ""PLAIT"" to test P, L, I, T.

 But I think ""STAMP"" is a good choice because S and T are very common at the beginning or the end.

 Since we know A is fixed in the 3rd, we can try to cover the other positions.

 I'll go with ""STAMP"".

 So the next guess: ""STAMP""

 But note: the feedback for A will be ✓ because we know it's in the 3rd. So we are mainly testing the other letters.

 Let me write the guess: STAMP

 However, note that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't know.

 We are hoping to get feedback on S, T, M, P.

 If we get a ✓ for A, then we know it's still in the 3rd (which we already know) and we get feedback on the others.

 So let's go with ""STAMP"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- A is confirmed in the 3rd position (✓).
- C, R, N, E are eliminated (x).

For the next guess:
- Must have A in the 3rd position.
- Avoid using C, R, N, E.
- Prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, M, P, L, I) to maximize information.

I chose **STAMP** because:
- It places A in the 3rd position.
- Tests new common letters: S, T, M, P.
- Avoids eliminated letters (C, R, N, E).
- Uses distinct letters to cover more possibilities.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so the secret word has A in the 3rd position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""stamp""
- S: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is still in the 3rd position)
- M: x (not in the word)
- P: x (not in the word)

So, from both guesses, we know:
- The secret word has A in the 3rd position: _ _ A _ _
- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P

We have eliminated 8 letters: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P

We need to form a 5-letter word that has A in the 3rd position and does not contain any of the eliminated letters.

Available letters: We have not tested many letters. The alphabet minus the eliminated ones:
Eliminated: C, E, M, N, P, R, S, T
So available: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: A is already in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice? The feedback doesn't tell us about multiple occurrences. However, since we only have one A in the guesses and it was marked correct, we don't know if there are more A's. But we can assume for now that there is at least one A in the 3rd position.

We need to choose a word that uses only the available letters and has A in the 3rd.

We also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let's think of common words that fit:

Pattern: _ _ A _ _

We can try:

- ""BLANK"": but N is eliminated -> not allowed
- ""FLAKY"": F, L, A, K, Y -> all available? Let's check: F, L, A, K, Y. Yes, none of C,E,M,N,P,R,S,T. So it's valid.
- ""GLAZE"": but Z and E? E is eliminated -> not allowed
- ""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L -> all available? Q, U, A, I, L: yes. But Q and U are less common? But it's a valid word.
- ""JUMBO"": but O? We don't know about O, but the pattern is _ _ A _ _ -> J, U, M, B, O -> M is eliminated? Yes, M is eliminated from guess 2. So not allowed.

We must avoid M.

Another: ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> but A is in the 2nd? We need A in the 3rd. So no.

We need the 3rd to be A.

Let's try ""FAVOR"": F, A, V, O, R -> but A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd.

We need the 3rd letter to be A.

So: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5]

Possible words:

- ""FLAKY"": F L A K Y -> positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:A, 4:K, 5:Y
- ""QUACK"": Q U A C K -> but C is eliminated -> not allowed
- ""QUAFF"": Q U A F F -> but F is available? Yes, but duplicate F? We can use duplicate letters? The rules don't say we can't, but we are trying to maximize information. Also, we don't know if F is in the word. But we are testing Q, U, F, and K? But Q and U are less common.

We can try ""BLAZE"": but Z and E? E is eliminated -> not allowed.

""GLAZE"" has E -> not allowed.

""PHASE"": P is eliminated -> not allowed.

""GRACE"": G, R, A, C, E -> R, C, E are eliminated -> not allowed.

""QUAKE"": Q, U, A, K, E -> E is eliminated -> not allowed.

""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L -> this works: Q, U, A, I, L -> all available? Yes: Q, U, A, I, L -> and A is in the 3rd.

But is ""QUAIL"" a common word? It might be accepted.

Another: ""DWARF"": D, W, A, R, F -> R is eliminated -> not allowed.

""HAZEL"": H, A, Z, E, L -> E eliminated -> not allowed.

""JABOT"": J, A, B, O, T -> A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd.

We need the 3rd to be A.

""BALMY"": B, A, L, M, Y -> A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd.

We need to focus on words with A in the 3rd.

Let me list some:

- ""FLAKY"": F, L, A, K, Y
- ""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L
- ""BLIMP"": B, L, I, M, P -> M and P eliminated -> not allowed
- ""SLING"": S, L, I, N, G -> S and N eliminated -> not allowed
- ""CLAMP"": C, L, A, M, P -> C, M, P eliminated -> not allowed

Another: ""DOZEN"": D, O, Z, E, N -> E and N eliminated -> not allowed

""GAWKY"": G, A, W, K, Y -> A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd.

We need to look for words that have the 3rd letter as A.

Perhaps ""OUIJA"": O, U, I, J, A -> but the 3rd letter is I? Not A.

I think ""FLAKY"" and ""QUAIL"" are options.

But let's think of more:

- ""ABACK"": A, B, A, C, K -> A is in the 1st and 3rd? But we need the 3rd to be A, and the 1st should be A? But in this word, the 1st is A, 2nd is B, 3rd is A, 4th is C, 5th is K. But C is eliminated. So not.

We need the 3rd to be A, and the 1st,2nd,4th,5th to be from the available letters.

Another: ""BIALY"": B, I, A, L, Y -> but A is in the 3rd? 
  Position: 1:B, 2:I, 3:A, 4:L, 5:Y -> yes! And B, I, L, Y are available.

But is ""BIALY"" a common word? It might be obscure.

""KAPUT"": K, A, P, U, T -> A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd. And P and T are eliminated.

""LAUAN"": L, A, U, A, N -> A in 2nd and 4th? Not the 3rd. And N eliminated.

""WAQFS"": W, A, Q, F, S -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. And S eliminated.

""FAUNA"": F, A, U, N, A -> A in 2nd and 5th? Not 3rd. And N eliminated.

""MAUVE"": M, A, U, V, E -> M and E eliminated.

""HAUTE"": H, A, U, T, E -> T and E eliminated.

""RAJAH"": R, A, J, A, H -> R eliminated and A in 2nd and 4th.

I think ""FLAKY"" and ""QUAIL"" are reasonable.

But let's also consider ""BLAND"": B, L, A, N, D -> N eliminated.

""GLAND"": G, L, A, N, D -> N eliminated.

""PLAIT"": P, L, A, I, T -> P and T eliminated.

So without the eliminated letters, we have:

- ""FLAKY"": F, L, A, K, Y
- ""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L
- ""BIALY"": B, I, A, L, Y
- ""DIARY"": D, I, A, R, Y -> R eliminated
- ""FIARY"": not a word? 
- ""LIARD"": not common and R eliminated.

Another: ""GUAVA"": G, U, A, V, A -> A in 3rd? 
  Position: 1:G, 2:U, 3:A, 4:V, 5:A -> yes! And G, U, V, A are available. But we have two A's? That's okay.

But ""GUAVA"" has two A's. We don't know if the secret word has two A's. But it's possible.

Similarly, ""FLAVA""? Not a word.

""VAGUS"": V, A, G, U, S -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. S eliminated.

""DOGMA"": D, O, G, M, A -> M eliminated and A in 5th? Not 3rd.

""ALGAE"": A, L, G, A, E -> E eliminated and A in 1st and 4th? Not 3rd.

""PHASE"": P eliminated.

""CHASE"": C, H, A, S, E -> C, S, E eliminated.

So let's consider ""FLAKY"", ""QUAIL"", and ""GUAVA"".

""GUAVA"" has G, U, V, A, A. We are testing G, U, V, and we already know A is in the 3rd and 5th? But we don't know if there is a 5th A. But we are allowed to use A again? The word must be valid, but we are trying to get information. However, if we use A again, we might get feedback on whether there is a second A.

But we have limited guesses, so we might want to test new letters.

""FLAKY"" tests F, L, K, Y (and A again, but we know A is in the 3rd so the fourth letter is K and fifth Y, and first F).

""QUAIL"" tests Q, U, I, L (and A in 3rd).

""GUAVA"" tests G, U, V, and two A's (so we test G, U, V, and also whether there is an A in the fifth position).

Since we have only 6 guesses, we might avoid repeating A to test more new letters.

But we don't know if the word has another A. However, we can try to avoid repeats to get more information.

So ""FLAKY"" and ""QUAIL"" are better because they have all distinct letters except that A is repeated in ""GUAVA"". But in ""GUAVA"", the A's are in different positions, so we can test if there is a fifth letter.

But let's see the available letters: we have many, so we can choose.

I think ""FLAKY"" is a good choice because it uses common letters F, L, K, Y that we haven't tried.

""QUAIL"" is also good because it tests Q, U, I, L.

But Q and U are less common, so ""FLAKY"" might be better.

Another word: ""WACKY"": W, A, C, K, Y -> C eliminated -> not allowed.

""FLICK"": F, L, I, C, K -> C eliminated.

""BLIMP"": B, L, I, M, P -> M and P eliminated.

""JUICE"": J, U, I, C, E -> C and E eliminated.

""QUITE"": Q, U, I, T, E -> T and E eliminated.

So I think ""FLAKY"" is a solid choice.

But let me check if there are words with more common letters.

What about ""LABOR"": L, A, B, O, R -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. R eliminated.

""LABIA"": L, A, B, I, A -> A in 2nd and 5th? Not 3rd.

""GABON"": not common and N eliminated.

""KAFIR"": K, A, F, I, R -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. R eliminated.

""LAUAN"": not.

Perhaps ""AVAIL"": A, V, A, I, L -> A in 1st and 3rd? But we need the 3rd to be A, and the 1st is A? But we don't know if the word has two A's. However, the 1st letter is A, so if we use A in the 1st, we might get feedback on that.

But ""AVAIL"": A, V, A, I, L -> positions: 1:A, 2:V, 3:A, 4:I, 5:L -> so the 3rd is A. And we are testing V, I, L, and A in the 1st and 5th.

But we already know A is in the 3rd, so we are testing the 1st and 5th as well.

But the word ""AVAIL"" is valid.

However, we have eliminated letters: we are using A, V, I, L. V, I, L are available.

But we are repeating A. We know A is in the 3rd, so if we get a ✓ for A in the 1st or 5th, that would be new information.

But we are trying to find the secret word, so we can use this to test for multiple A's.

But in the feedback, for ""crane"" and ""stamp"", we only had one A and it was correct. If there were two A's, we wouldn't know.

So ""AVAIL"" is a possibility.

But let's compare to ""FLAKY"":

""FLAKY"": tests F, L, K, Y (and A in the 3rd, which we know). We get feedback on F, L, K, Y.

""AVAIL"": tests V, I, L (and A in 1st and 3rd). We get feedback on V, I, L, and also about the first A and the last A.

But ""AVAIL"" uses the letter I, which is a vowel, and we haven't tested I yet.

We haven't tested I, so that might be good.

But ""FLAKY"" tests F, L, K, Y which are also good.

Since we have eliminated many vowels (E, A is known, but A is fixed), we should test other vowels: I, O, U.

In ""AVAIL"", we test I and also O? Not O in this word.

In ""FLAKY"", we test Y which can be a vowel sometimes.

But ""AVAIL"" has two A's, which might be useful if we suspect a double A, but we don't have evidence.

I think ""FLAKY"" is a safer choice because it doesn't repeat A and tests four new letters.

But in ""FLAKY"", the A is only in the 3rd, so we are not testing for additional A's.

We can also consider ""OAKUM"": O, A, K, U, M -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. M eliminated.

""DAHLia"": too long.

5-letter words only.

Another: ""ABYSS"": A in 1st? Not 3rd.

I think ""FLAKY"" is a good choice.

But let me check if there is a word with O or U.

""ALOUD"": A, L, O, U, D -> A in 1st? Not 3rd.

""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O -> A in 1st? Not 3rd.

We need the 3rd to be A.

""PIANO"": P, I, A, N, O -> P and N eliminated.

""RADAR"": R, A, D, A, R -> R eliminated and A in 2nd and 4th.

Not.

""LAUDS"": L, A, U, D, S -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. S eliminated.

""QUADS"": Q, U, A, D, S -> A in 3rd? 
  Position: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:A, 4:D, 5:S -> but S is eliminated. So not.

""QUAFF"": Q, U, A, F, F -> A in 3rd? 
  1:Q, 2:U, 3:A, 4:F, 5:F -> but duplicate F. We can use duplicate letters? The rules don't forbid it, but it might not be efficient.

But we are trying to get information. If we use a word with duplicate letters, we might not know about as many letters.

So I think ""FLAKY"" is better because all letters are distinct.

Another word: ""WACKY"": not allowed because of C.

""FLAKY"" seems good.

But let's see if there is a word with I and O.

""ALGAL"": not common and A in 1st? Not 3rd.

""ATTAR"": A, T, T, A, R -> T and R eliminated.

Not.

""ADIEU"": A, D, I, E, U -> E eliminated and A in 1st? Not 3rd.

I think ""FLAKY"" is a reasonable choice.

But we have to make sure that we are not using any eliminated letters.

Let's list the letters we have eliminated: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P

So for ""FLAKY"": F, L, A, K, Y -> none of these are eliminated. And A is in the 3rd.

Similarly, for ""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L -> none eliminated, A in 3rd.

But ""QUAIL"" has Q and U which are less common. ""FLAKY"" has more common letters: F, L, K, Y.

""FLAKY"" uses F, L, K, Y, which are all fairly common.

We can also consider ""BLUET"": not a word? ""BLUET"" is not standard. ""BLUTE"" has E.

Another word: ""GAWKY"": G, A, W, K, Y -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd.

""JAZZY"": J, A, Z, Z, Y -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd.

I think ""FLAKY"" is a good choice.

But let's try ""HAVOC"": H, A, V, O, C -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. C eliminated.

""KAVAS"": K, A, V, A, S -> A in 2nd and 4th? Not 3rd. S eliminated.

""BAWDY"": B, A, W, D, Y -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd.

""DAFT"": not 5 letters.

I found: ""FLAKY"" is a valid word.

So I'll go with ""FLAKY"".

But note: we are testing F, L, K, Y. If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Alternatively, we can use ""QUAIL"" to test Q, U, I, L.

But I think ""FLAKY"" is more common.

Another option: ""WACKY"" is not allowed.

""FLAKY"" seems good.

But let me check if there is a word with O.

""ALGUM"": not common.

""FLAVY""? Not a word.

""FLAKY"" is the best so far.

We can also consider ""BLAZE"": but E is eliminated.

""GLAZE"": E eliminated.

""BEIGE"": B, E, I, G, E -> E eliminated.

So I think ""FLAKY"" is a solid second guess.

Therefore, I'll guess ""FLAKY"".

But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""FLAKY"" is a valid English word.

So the next guess is ""FLAKY"".

But note: we are not using any eliminated letters.

So let's go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **A is confirmed in the 3rd position** (✓).
- **C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P are eliminated** (x).

For the next guess:
- Must have **A in the 3rd position**.
- Avoid eliminated letters (C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P).
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., F, L, K, Y, Q, U, I, L) to maximize information.

I chose **FLAKY** because:
- It places A in the 3rd position.
- Tests new common letters: F, L, K, Y.
- Uses distinct letters to cover more possibilities.
- Avoids eliminated letters and repeats.

<guess>flaky</guess>",flaky,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so the secret word has A in the 3rd position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""stamp""
- S: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is still in the 3rd position)
- M: x (not in the word)
- P: x (not in the word)

So, from both guesses, we know:
- The secret word has A in the 3rd position: _ _ A _ _
- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P

We have eliminated 8 letters: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P

We need to form a 5-letter word that has A in the 3rd position and does not contain any of the eliminated letters.

Available letters: We have not tested many letters. The alphabet minus the eliminated ones:
Eliminated: C, E, M, N, P, R, S, T
So available: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: A is already in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice? The feedback doesn't tell us about multiple occurrences. However, since we only have one A in the guesses and it was marked correct, we don't know if there are more A's. But we can assume for now that there is at least one A in the 3rd position.

We need to choose a word that uses only the available letters and has A in the 3rd.

We also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let's think of common words that fit:

Pattern: _ _ A _ _

We can try:

- ""BLANK"": but N is eliminated -> not allowed
- ""FLAKY"": F, L, A, K, Y -> all available? Let's check: F, L, A, K, Y. Yes, none of C,E,M,N,P,R,S,T. So it's valid.
- ""GLAZE"": but Z and E? E is eliminated -> not allowed
- ""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L -> all available? Q, U, A, I, L: yes. But Q and U are less common? But it's a valid word.
- ""JUMBO"": but O? We don't know about O, but the pattern is _ _ A _ _ -> J, U, M, B, O -> M is eliminated? Yes, M is eliminated from guess 2. So not allowed.

We must avoid M.

Another: ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> but A is in the 2nd? We need A in the 3rd. So no.

We need the 3rd to be A.

Let's try ""FAVOR"": F, A, V, O, R -> but A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd.

We need the 3rd letter to be A.

So: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5]

Possible words:

- ""FLAKY"": F L A K Y -> positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:A, 4:K, 5:Y
- ""QUACK"": Q U A C K -> but C is eliminated -> not allowed
- ""QUAFF"": Q U A F F -> but F is available? Yes, but duplicate F? We can use duplicate letters? The rules don't say we can't, but we are trying to maximize information. Also, we don't know if F is in the word. But we are testing Q, U, F, and K? But Q and U are less common.

We can try ""BLAZE"": but Z and E? E is eliminated -> not allowed.

""GLAZE"" has E -> not allowed.

""PHASE"": P is eliminated -> not allowed.

""GRACE"": G, R, A, C, E -> R, C, E are eliminated -> not allowed.

""QUAKE"": Q, U, A, K, E -> E is eliminated -> not allowed.

""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L -> this works: Q, U, A, I, L -> all available? Yes: Q, U, A, I, L -> and A is in the 3rd.

But is ""QUAIL"" a common word? It might be accepted.

Another: ""DWARF"": D, W, A, R, F -> R is eliminated -> not allowed.

""HAZEL"": H, A, Z, E, L -> E eliminated -> not allowed.

""JABOT"": J, A, B, O, T -> A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd.

We need the 3rd to be A.

""BALMY"": B, A, L, M, Y -> A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd.

We need to focus on words with A in the 3rd.

Let me list some:

- ""FLAKY"": F, L, A, K, Y
- ""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L
- ""BLIMP"": B, L, I, M, P -> M and P eliminated -> not allowed
- ""SLING"": S, L, I, N, G -> S and N eliminated -> not allowed
- ""CLAMP"": C, L, A, M, P -> C, M, P eliminated -> not allowed

Another: ""DOZEN"": D, O, Z, E, N -> E and N eliminated -> not allowed

""GAWKY"": G, A, W, K, Y -> A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd.

We need to look for words that have the 3rd letter as A.

Perhaps ""OUIJA"": O, U, I, J, A -> but the 3rd letter is I? Not A.

I think ""FLAKY"" and ""QUAIL"" are options.

But let's think of more:

- ""ABACK"": A, B, A, C, K -> A is in the 1st and 3rd? But we need the 3rd to be A, and the 1st should be A? But in this word, the 1st is A, 2nd is B, 3rd is A, 4th is C, 5th is K. But C is eliminated. So not.

We need the 3rd to be A, and the 1st,2nd,4th,5th to be from the available letters.

Another: ""BIALY"": B, I, A, L, Y -> but A is in the 3rd? 
  Position: 1:B, 2:I, 3:A, 4:L, 5:Y -> yes! And B, I, L, Y are available.

But is ""BIALY"" a common word? It might be obscure.

""KAPUT"": K, A, P, U, T -> A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd. And P and T are eliminated.

""LAUAN"": L, A, U, A, N -> A in 2nd and 4th? Not the 3rd. And N eliminated.

""WAQFS"": W, A, Q, F, S -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. And S eliminated.

""FAUNA"": F, A, U, N, A -> A in 2nd and 5th? Not 3rd. And N eliminated.

""MAUVE"": M, A, U, V, E -> M and E eliminated.

""HAUTE"": H, A, U, T, E -> T and E eliminated.

""RAJAH"": R, A, J, A, H -> R eliminated and A in 2nd and 4th.

I think ""FLAKY"" and ""QUAIL"" are reasonable.

But let's also consider ""BLAND"": B, L, A, N, D -> N eliminated.

""GLAND"": G, L, A, N, D -> N eliminated.

""PLAIT"": P, L, A, I, T -> P and T eliminated.

So without the eliminated letters, we have:

- ""FLAKY"": F, L, A, K, Y
- ""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L
- ""BIALY"": B, I, A, L, Y
- ""DIARY"": D, I, A, R, Y -> R eliminated
- ""FIARY"": not a word? 
- ""LIARD"": not common and R eliminated.

Another: ""GUAVA"": G, U, A, V, A -> A in 3rd? 
  Position: 1:G, 2:U, 3:A, 4:V, 5:A -> yes! And G, U, V, A are available. But we have two A's? That's okay.

But ""GUAVA"" has two A's. We don't know if the secret word has two A's. But it's possible.

Similarly, ""FLAVA""? Not a word.

""VAGUS"": V, A, G, U, S -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. S eliminated.

""DOGMA"": D, O, G, M, A -> M eliminated and A in 5th? Not 3rd.

""ALGAE"": A, L, G, A, E -> E eliminated and A in 1st and 4th? Not 3rd.

""PHASE"": P eliminated.

""CHASE"": C, H, A, S, E -> C, S, E eliminated.

So let's consider ""FLAKY"", ""QUAIL"", and ""GUAVA"".

""GUAVA"" has G, U, V, A, A. We are testing G, U, V, and we already know A is in the 3rd and 5th? But we don't know if there is a 5th A. But we are allowed to use A again? The word must be valid, but we are trying to get information. However, if we use A again, we might get feedback on whether there is a second A.

But we have limited guesses, so we might want to test new letters.

""FLAKY"" tests F, L, K, Y (and A again, but we know A is in the 3rd so the fourth letter is K and fifth Y, and first F).

""QUAIL"" tests Q, U, I, L (and A in 3rd).

""GUAVA"" tests G, U, V, and two A's (so we test G, U, V, and also whether there is an A in the fifth position).

Since we have only 6 guesses, we might avoid repeating A to test more new letters.

But we don't know if the word has another A. However, we can try to avoid repeats to get more information.

So ""FLAKY"" and ""QUAIL"" are better because they have all distinct letters except that A is repeated in ""GUAVA"". But in ""GUAVA"", the A's are in different positions, so we can test if there is a fifth letter.

But let's see the available letters: we have many, so we can choose.

I think ""FLAKY"" is a good choice because it uses common letters F, L, K, Y that we haven't tried.

""QUAIL"" is also good because it tests Q, U, I, L.

But Q and U are less common, so ""FLAKY"" might be better.

Another word: ""WACKY"": W, A, C, K, Y -> C eliminated -> not allowed.

""FLICK"": F, L, I, C, K -> C eliminated.

""BLIMP"": B, L, I, M, P -> M and P eliminated.

""JUICE"": J, U, I, C, E -> C and E eliminated.

""QUITE"": Q, U, I, T, E -> T and E eliminated.

So I think ""FLAKY"" is a solid choice.

But let me check if there are words with more common letters.

What about ""LABOR"": L, A, B, O, R -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. R eliminated.

""LABIA"": L, A, B, I, A -> A in 2nd and 5th? Not 3rd.

""GABON"": not common and N eliminated.

""KAFIR"": K, A, F, I, R -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. R eliminated.

""LAUAN"": not.

Perhaps ""AVAIL"": A, V, A, I, L -> A in 1st and 3rd? But we need the 3rd to be A, and the 1st is A? But we don't know if the word has two A's. However, the 1st letter is A, so if we use A in the 1st, we might get feedback on that.

But ""AVAIL"": A, V, A, I, L -> positions: 1:A, 2:V, 3:A, 4:I, 5:L -> so the 3rd is A. And we are testing V, I, L, and A in the 1st and 5th.

But we already know A is in the 3rd, so we are testing the 1st and 5th as well.

But the word ""AVAIL"" is valid.

However, we have eliminated letters: we are using A, V, I, L. V, I, L are available.

But we are repeating A. We know A is in the 3rd, so if we get a ✓ for A in the 1st or 5th, that would be new information.

But we are trying to find the secret word, so we can use this to test for multiple A's.

But in the feedback, for ""crane"" and ""stamp"", we only had one A and it was correct. If there were two A's, we wouldn't know.

So ""AVAIL"" is a possibility.

But let's compare to ""FLAKY"":

""FLAKY"": tests F, L, K, Y (and A in the 3rd, which we know). We get feedback on F, L, K, Y.

""AVAIL"": tests V, I, L (and A in 1st and 3rd). We get feedback on V, I, L, and also about the first A and the last A.

But ""AVAIL"" uses the letter I, which is a vowel, and we haven't tested I yet.

We haven't tested I, so that might be good.

But ""FLAKY"" tests F, L, K, Y which are also good.

Since we have eliminated many vowels (E, A is known, but A is fixed), we should test other vowels: I, O, U.

I think ""FLAKY"" is a safer choice because it doesn't repeat A and tests four new letters.

But in ""FLAKY"", the A is only in the 3rd, so we are not testing for additional A's.

We can also consider ""OAKUM"": O, A, K, U, M -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. M eliminated.

""DAHLia"": too long.

5-letter words only.

Another: ""ABYSS"": A in 1st? Not 3rd.

I think ""FLAKY"" is a good choice.

But let me check if there is a word with O or U.

""ALOUD"": A, L, O, U, D -> A in 1st? Not 3rd.

""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O -> A in 1st? Not 3rd.

We need the 3rd to be A.

""PIANO"": P, I, A, N, O -> P and N eliminated.

""RADAR"": R, A, D, A, R -> R eliminated and A in 2nd and 4th.

Not.

""LAUDS"": L, A, U, D, S -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. S eliminated.

""QUADS"": Q, U, A, D, S -> A in 3rd? 
  Position: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:A, 4:D, 5:S -> but S is eliminated. So not.

""QUAFF"": Q, U, A, F, F -> A in 3rd? 
  1:Q, 2:U, 3:A, 4:F, 5:F -> but duplicate F. We can use duplicate letters? The rules don't forbid it, but it might not be efficient.

But we are trying to get information. If we use a word with duplicate letters, we might not know about as many letters.

So I think ""FLAKY"" is better because all letters are distinct.

Another word: ""WACKY"": not allowed because of C.

""FLAKY"" seems good.

But let's see if there is a word with I and O.

""ALGAL"": not common and A in 1st? Not 3rd.

""ATTAR"": A, T, T, A, R -> T and R eliminated.

Not.

""ADIEU"": A, D, I, E, U -> E eliminated and A in 1st? Not 3rd.

I think ""FLAKY"" is a reasonable choice.

But we have to make sure that we are not using any eliminated letters.

Let's list the letters we have eliminated: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P

So for ""FLAKY"": F, L, A, K, Y -> none of these are eliminated. And A is in the 3rd.

Similarly, for ""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L -> none eliminated, A in 3rd.

But ""QUAIL"" has Q and U which are less common. ""FLAKY"" has more common letters: F, L, K, Y.

""FLAKY"" uses F, L, K, Y, which are all fairly common.

We can also consider ""BLUET"": not a word? ""BLUET"" is not standard. ""BLUTE"" has E.

Another word: ""GAWKY"": G, A, W, K, Y -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd.

""JAZZY"": J, A, Z, Z, Y -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd.

I think ""FLAKY"" is a good choice.

But let's try ""HAVOC"": H, A, V, O, C -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. C eliminated.

""KAVAS"": K, A, V, A, S -> A in 2nd and 4th? Not 3rd. S eliminated.

""BAWDY"": B, A, W, D, Y -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd.

""DAFT"": not 5 letters.

I found: ""FLAKY"" is a valid word.

So I'll go with ""FLAKY"".

But note: we are testing F, L, K, Y. If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Alternatively, we can use ""QUAIL"" to test Q, U, I, L.

But I think ""FLAKY"" is more common.

Another option: ""WACKY"" is not allowed.

""FLAKY"" seems good.

But let me check if there is a word with O.

""ALGUM"": not common.

""FLAVY""? Not a word.

""FLAKY"" is the best so far.

We can also consider ""BLAZE"": but E is eliminated.

""GLAZE"": E eliminated.

""BEIGE"": B, E, I, G, E -> E eliminated.

So I think ""FLAKY"" is a solid second guess.

Therefore, I'll guess ""FLAKY"".

But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""FLAKY"" is a valid English word.

So the next guess is ""FLAKY"".

But note: we are not using any eliminated letters.

So let's go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **A is confirmed in the 3rd position** (✓).
- **C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P are eliminated** (x).

For the next guess:
- Must have **A in the 3rd position**.
- Avoid eliminated letters (C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P).
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., F, L, K, Y, Q, U, I, L) to maximize information.

I chose **FLAKY** because:
- It places A in the 3rd position.
- Tests new common letters: F, L, K, Y.
- Uses distinct letters to cover more possibilities.
- Avoids eliminated letters and repeats.",Guess 3: flaky -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(-) A(✓) K(x) Y(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: ✓ (correct position, so the secret word has A in the 3rd position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word has the letter A in the 3rd position.
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

 Since R and E are not in the word, and we know the word has A in the 3rd position, we can try to form a new word.

 We must avoid using C, R, N, E.

 Let's think of common 5-letter words that have A in the 3rd position.

 The pattern is: _ _ A _ _

 We have to choose letters that are not C, R, N, E.

 We can consider using other common consonants and vowels.

 Since we have eliminated 4 letters (C, R, N, E), we have plenty of options.

 Let's try to think of words that have A in the 3rd position.

 Some examples: 
   ""PLAIT"" -> but we don't know if P, L, I, T are in the word? But we can use them because they are not eliminated.
   ""BLAST"" -> but B, L, S, T are not eliminated, but note that we have A in the 3rd.

 However, we must avoid using the eliminated letters: C, R, N, E.

 Let's list some words with A in the 3rd position and without C, R, N, E:

   ""BALMY"" -> B, A, L, M, Y -> but we don't know about B, L, M, Y.
   ""PALMS"" -> P, A, L, M, S -> again, no C, R, N, E.

 But note: we want to maximize information. We should try to include common letters that we haven't tested yet.

 We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We can try to use a word that has multiple common letters.

 Let's consider ""SLATE"": 
   S, L, A, T, E -> but E is eliminated! We cannot use E.

 So avoid E.

 Another word: ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T -> no eliminated letters? 
   P, L, A, I, T: A is in the 3rd, and we are avoiding C, R, N, E. So this is acceptable.

 But we don't know if the word has P, L, I, T.

 Alternatively, ""BLAST"": B, L, A, S, T -> also acceptable.

 However, note that we have only 6 tries, so we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let's choose a word that has distinct letters and covers common ones.

 I'll go with ""PLAIT"" because it has P, L, I, T which are common.

 But wait, we have to make sure it's a valid word.

 Alternatively, we can use ""STAMP"": S, T, A, M, P -> but A is in the 3rd? 
   S (1st), T (2nd), A (3rd), M (4th), P (5th). Yes.

 But note: we are avoiding E, and STAMP doesn't have E. Also, no C, R, N.

 However, we already know A is in the 3rd, so we can use that.

 But let me check: we have eliminated C, R, N, E. So we can use any other letters.

 Another common word: ""SHALT"" -> but that might be archaic? We should use common words.

 Let's stick with common words.

 I think ""PLAIT"" is a good candidate because it has two vowels (A and I) and three consonants (P, L, T) that we haven't tried.

 But note: we have already eliminated E, so the word might have other vowels? Like O, U, I?

 We can also consider ""OPALE"" but that has E which is eliminated.

 Another word: ""QUAIL"" -> Q, U, A, I, L -> but Q and U are less common? And we have A in the 3rd.

 But we want to test more common letters.

 Let me think of words that have S, T, L, and other common letters.

 ""SLANT"" -> but N is eliminated! We cannot use N.

 So avoid N.

 ""SLATE"" is out because of E.

 ""PLAIT"" seems okay.

 Alternatively, ""BLIMP"": B, L, I, M, P -> but no A? We must have A in the 3rd.

 So we must choose a word that has A in the 3rd.

 Let me list: 
   ""ABACK"" -> but A is in the 1st? We need A in the 3rd.

 So the word must be: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5]

 We can use: 
   ""PLAIT: P L A I T -> positions: 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:I, 5:T
   ""BLAST: B L A S T -> 1:B, 2:L, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T
   ""STAMP: S T A M P -> 1:S, 2:T, 3:A, 4:M, 5:P
   ""SHARD: S H A R D -> but R is eliminated! So we cannot use R.
   ""SHALT: S H A L T -> 1:S, 2:H, 3:A, 4:L, 5:T -> but is it common? Maybe.

 We can also consider ""GLASS"" -> but that has two S's and we don't know about S and G. Also, A is in the 3rd? 
   G L A S S -> 1:G, 2:L, 3:A, 4:S, 5:S -> but we have two S's. It's valid, but we might get less information because of duplicate letters.

 We want to test as many new letters as possible, so distinct letters are better.

 So ""PLAIT"" has distinct letters: P, L, A, I, T -> all distinct.

 Similarly, ""BLAST"" has B, L, A, S, T -> distinct.

 ""STAMP"" has S, T, A, M, P -> distinct.

 I think ""STAMP"" is a good choice because it has S, T, M, P which are very common.

 But note: we already know A is in the 3rd, so we are testing S, T, M, P in positions 1,2,4,5.

 Alternatively, we can use ""PAINT"" -> but N is eliminated and T is at the end? 
   P A I N T -> but we need A in the 3rd? This has A in the 2nd. So not.

 We must have the 3rd letter as A.

 Another word: ""FAULT"" -> F A U L T -> A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd.

 So let's choose between ""PLAIT"" and ""STAMP"".

 I think ""STAMP"" is more common and has more common letters.

 But note: we have eliminated E, so the word might have O, U, I, O? 

 We can also consider ""DAILY"": D A I L Y -> A is in the 2nd? No.

 We need the 3rd to be A.

 Let me think of words: 
   ""BEADY"" -> B E A D Y -> but E is eliminated! So we cannot use E.

   ""HEADY"" -> H E A D Y -> E is eliminated.

   ""LEAVE"" -> has E and also V? But E is eliminated.

 So avoid E.

 Another: ""QUAKE"" -> Q U A K E -> E is eliminated.

 So we avoid E.

 After some thought, I'll go with ""STAMP"".

 But wait, we have to make sure that we are not using any eliminated letters: 
   S, T, A, M, P -> none of C, R, N, E. So it's okay.

 Alternatively, we can use ""SLACK"" -> but C is eliminated? Yes, C is eliminated. So we cannot use C.

 So ""STAMP"" is safe.

 Let me check: 
   S: not tested yet
   T: not tested
   A: we know is in the word and in the 3rd position (so we expect a check for A, but we are testing the position)
   M: not tested
   P: not tested

 This will give us information about S, T, M, P.

 Alternatively, we can use ""PLAIT"" to test P, L, I, T.

 But I think ""STAMP"" is a good choice because S and T are very common at the beginning or the end.

 Since we know A is fixed in the 3rd, we can try to cover the other positions.

 I'll go with ""STAMP"".

 So the next guess: ""STAMP""

 But note: the feedback for A will be ✓ because we know it's in the 3rd. So we are mainly testing the other letters.

 Let me write the guess: STAMP

 However, note that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't know.

 We are hoping to get feedback on S, T, M, P.

 If we get a ✓ for A, then we know it's still in the 3rd (which we already know) and we get feedback on the others.

 So let's go with ""STAMP"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- A is confirmed in the 3rd position (✓).
- C, R, N, E are eliminated (x).

For the next guess:
- Must have A in the 3rd position.
- Avoid using C, R, N, E.
- Prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, M, P, L, I) to maximize information.

I chose **STAMP** because:
- It places A in the 3rd position.
- Tests new common letters: S, T, M, P.
- Avoids eliminated letters (C, R, N, E).
- Uses distinct letters to cover more possibilities.

<guess>stamp</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: stamp -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) M(x) P(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so the secret word has A in the 3rd position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""stamp""
- S: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is still in the 3rd position)
- M: x (not in the word)
- P: x (not in the word)

So, from both guesses, we know:
- The secret word has A in the 3rd position: _ _ A _ _
- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P

We have eliminated 8 letters: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P

We need to form a 5-letter word that has A in the 3rd position and does not contain any of the eliminated letters.

Available letters: We have not tested many letters. The alphabet minus the eliminated ones:
Eliminated: C, E, M, N, P, R, S, T
So available: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: A is already in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice? The feedback doesn't tell us about multiple occurrences. However, since we only have one A in the guesses and it was marked correct, we don't know if there are more A's. But we can assume for now that there is at least one A in the 3rd position.

We need to choose a word that uses only the available letters and has A in the 3rd.

We also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let's think of common words that fit:

Pattern: _ _ A _ _

We can try:

- ""BLANK"": but N is eliminated -> not allowed
- ""FLAKY"": F, L, A, K, Y -> all available? Let's check: F, L, A, K, Y. Yes, none of C,E,M,N,P,R,S,T. So it's valid.
- ""GLAZE"": but Z and E? E is eliminated -> not allowed
- ""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L -> all available? Q, U, A, I, L: yes. But Q and U are less common? But it's a valid word.
- ""JUMBO"": but O? We don't know about O, but the pattern is _ _ A _ _ -> J, U, M, B, O -> M is eliminated? Yes, M is eliminated from guess 2. So not allowed.

We must avoid M.

Another: ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> but A is in the 2nd? We need A in the 3rd. So no.

We need the 3rd to be A.

Let's try ""FAVOR"": F, A, V, O, R -> but A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd.

We need the 3rd letter to be A.

So: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5]

Possible words:

- ""FLAKY"": F L A K Y -> positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:A, 4:K, 5:Y
- ""QUACK"": Q U A C K -> but C is eliminated -> not allowed
- ""QUAFF"": Q U A F F -> but F is available? Yes, but duplicate F? We can use duplicate letters? The rules don't say we can't, but we are trying to maximize information. Also, we don't know if F is in the word. But we are testing Q, U, F, and K? But Q and U are less common.

We can try ""BLAZE"": but Z and E? E is eliminated -> not allowed.

""GLAZE"" has E -> not allowed.

""PHASE"": P is eliminated -> not allowed.

""GRACE"": G, R, A, C, E -> R, C, E are eliminated -> not allowed.

""QUAKE"": Q, U, A, K, E -> E is eliminated -> not allowed.

""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L -> this works: Q, U, A, I, L -> all available? Yes: Q, U, A, I, L -> and A is in the 3rd.

But is ""QUAIL"" a common word? It might be accepted.

Another: ""DWARF"": D, W, A, R, F -> R is eliminated -> not allowed.

""HAZEL"": H, A, Z, E, L -> E eliminated -> not allowed.

""JABOT"": J, A, B, O, T -> A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd.

We need the 3rd to be A.

""BALMY"": B, A, L, M, Y -> A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd.

We need to focus on words with A in the 3rd.

Let me list some:

- ""FLAKY"": F, L, A, K, Y
- ""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L
- ""BLIMP"": B, L, I, M, P -> M and P eliminated -> not allowed
- ""SLING"": S, L, I, N, G -> S and N eliminated -> not allowed
- ""CLAMP"": C, L, A, M, P -> C, M, P eliminated -> not allowed

Another: ""DOZEN"": D, O, Z, E, N -> E and N eliminated -> not allowed

""GAWKY"": G, A, W, K, Y -> A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd.

We need to look for words that have the 3rd letter as A.

Perhaps ""OUIJA"": O, U, I, J, A -> but the 3rd letter is I? Not A.

I think ""FLAKY"" and ""QUAIL"" are options.

But let's think of more:

- ""ABACK"": A, B, A, C, K -> A is in the 1st and 3rd? But we need the 3rd to be A, and the 1st should be A? But in this word, the 1st is A, 2nd is B, 3rd is A, 4th is C, 5th is K. But C is eliminated. So not.

We need the 3rd to be A, and the 1st,2nd,4th,5th to be from the available letters.

Another: ""BIALY"": B, I, A, L, Y -> but A is in the 3rd? 
  Position: 1:B, 2:I, 3:A, 4:L, 5:Y -> yes! And B, I, L, Y are available.

But is ""BIALY"" a common word? It might be obscure.

""KAPUT"": K, A, P, U, T -> A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd. And P and T are eliminated.

""LAUAN"": L, A, U, A, N -> A in 2nd and 4th? Not the 3rd. And N eliminated.

""WAQFS"": W, A, Q, F, S -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. And S eliminated.

""FAUNA"": F, A, U, N, A -> A in 2nd and 5th? Not 3rd. And N eliminated.

""MAUVE"": M, A, U, V, E -> M and E eliminated.

""HAUTE"": H, A, U, T, E -> T and E eliminated.

""RAJAH"": R, A, J, A, H -> R eliminated and A in 2nd and 4th.

I think ""FLAKY"" and ""QUAIL"" are reasonable.

But let's also consider ""BLAND"": B, L, A, N, D -> N eliminated.

""GLAND"": G, L, A, N, D -> N eliminated.

""PLAIT"": P, L, A, I, T -> P and T eliminated.

So without the eliminated letters, we have:

- ""FLAKY"": F, L, A, K, Y
- ""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L
- ""BIALY"": B, I, A, L, Y
- ""DIARY"": D, I, A, R, Y -> R eliminated
- ""FIARY"": not a word? 
- ""LIARD"": not common and R eliminated.

Another: ""GUAVA"": G, U, A, V, A -> A in 3rd? 
  Position: 1:G, 2:U, 3:A, 4:V, 5:A -> yes! And G, U, V, A are available. But we have two A's? That's okay.

But ""GUAVA"" has two A's. We don't know if the secret word has two A's. But it's possible.

Similarly, ""FLAVA""? Not a word.

""VAGUS"": V, A, G, U, S -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. S eliminated.

""DOGMA"": D, O, G, M, A -> M eliminated and A in 5th? Not 3rd.

""ALGAE"": A, L, G, A, E -> E eliminated and A in 1st and 4th? Not 3rd.

""PHASE"": P eliminated.

""CHASE"": C, H, A, S, E -> C, S, E eliminated.

So let's consider ""FLAKY"", ""QUAIL"", and ""GUAVA"".

""GUAVA"" has G, U, V, A, A. We are testing G, U, V, and we already know A is in the 3rd and 5th? But we don't know if there is a 5th A. But we are allowed to use A again? The word must be valid, but we are trying to get information. However, if we use A again, we might get feedback on whether there is a second A.

But we have limited guesses, so we might want to test new letters.

""FLAKY"" tests F, L, K, Y (and A again, but we know A is in the 3rd so the fourth letter is K and fifth Y, and first F).

""QUAIL"" tests Q, U, I, L (and A in 3rd).

""GUAVA"" tests G, U, V, and two A's (so we test G, U, V, and also whether there is an A in the fifth position).

Since we have only 6 guesses, we might avoid repeating A to test more new letters.

But we don't know if the word has another A. However, we can try to avoid repeats to get more information.

So ""FLAKY"" and ""QUAIL"" are better because they have all distinct letters except that A is repeated in ""GUAVA"". But in ""GUAVA"", the A's are in different positions, so we can test if there is a fifth letter.

But let's see the available letters: we have many, so we can choose.

I think ""FLAKY"" is a good choice because it uses common letters F, L, K, Y that we haven't tried.

""QUAIL"" is also good because it tests Q, U, I, L.

But Q and U are less common, so ""FLAKY"" might be better.

Another word: ""WACKY"": W, A, C, K, Y -> C eliminated -> not allowed.

""FLICK"": F, L, I, C, K -> C eliminated.

""BLIMP"": B, L, I, M, P -> M and P eliminated.

""JUICE"": J, U, I, C, E -> C and E eliminated.

""QUITE"": Q, U, I, T, E -> T and E eliminated.

So I think ""FLAKY"" is a solid choice.

But let me check if there are words with more common letters.

What about ""LABOR"": L, A, B, O, R -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. R eliminated.

""LABIA"": L, A, B, I, A -> A in 2nd and 5th? Not 3rd.

""GABON"": not common and N eliminated.

""KAFIR"": K, A, F, I, R -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. R eliminated.

""LAUAN"": not.

Perhaps ""AVAIL"": A, V, A, I, L -> A in 1st and 3rd? But we need the 3rd to be A, and the 1st is A? But we don't know if the word has two A's. However, the 1st letter is A, so if we use A in the 1st, we might get feedback on that.

But ""AVAIL"": A, V, A, I, L -> positions: 1:A, 2:V, 3:A, 4:I, 5:L -> so the 3rd is A. And we are testing V, I, L, and A in the 1st and 5th.

But we already know A is in the 3rd, so we are testing the 1st and 5th as well.

But the word ""AVAIL"" is valid.

However, we have eliminated letters: we are using A, V, I, L. V, I, L are available.

But we are repeating A. We know A is in the 3rd, so if we get a ✓ for A in the 1st or 5th, that would be new information.

But we are trying to find the secret word, so we can use this to test for multiple A's.

But in the feedback, for ""crane"" and ""stamp"", we only had one A and it was correct. If there were two A's, we wouldn't know.

So ""AVAIL"" is a possibility.

But let's compare to ""FLAKY"":

""FLAKY"": tests F, L, K, Y (and A in the 3rd, which we know). We get feedback on F, L, K, Y.

""AVAIL"": tests V, I, L (and A in 1st and 3rd). We get feedback on V, I, L, and also about the first A and the last A.

But ""AVAIL"" uses the letter I, which is a vowel, and we haven't tested I yet.

We haven't tested I, so that might be good.

But ""FLAKY"" tests F, L, K, Y which are also good.

Since we have eliminated many vowels (E, A is known, but A is fixed), we should test other vowels: I, O, U.

In ""AVAIL"", we test I and also O? Not O in this word.

In ""FLAKY"", we test Y which can be a vowel sometimes.

But ""AVAIL"" has two A's, which might be useful if we suspect a double A, but we don't have evidence.

I think ""FLAKY"" is a safer choice because it doesn't repeat A and tests four new letters.

But in ""FLAKY"", the A is only in the 3rd, so we are not testing for additional A's.

We can also consider ""OAKUM"": O, A, K, U, M -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. M eliminated.

""DAHLia"": too long.

5-letter words only.

Another: ""ABYSS"": A in 1st? Not 3rd.

I think ""FLAKY"" is a good choice.

But let me check if there is a word with O or U.

""ALOUD"": A, L, O, U, D -> A in 1st? Not 3rd.

""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O -> A in 1st? Not 3rd.

We need the 3rd to be A.

""PIANO"": P, I, A, N, O -> P and N eliminated.

""RADAR"": R, A, D, A, R -> R eliminated and A in 2nd and 4th.

Not.

""LAUDS"": L, A, U, D, S -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. S eliminated.

""QUADS"": Q, U, A, D, S -> A in 3rd? 
  Position: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:A, 4:D, 5:S -> but S is eliminated. So not.

""QUAFF"": Q, U, A, F, F -> A in 3rd? 
  1:Q, 2:U, 3:A, 4:F, 5:F -> but duplicate F. We can use duplicate letters? The rules don't forbid it, but it might not be efficient.

But we are trying to get information. If we use a word with duplicate letters, we might not know about as many letters.

So I think ""FLAKY"" is better because all letters are distinct.

Another word: ""WACKY"": not allowed because of C.

""FLAKY"" seems good.

But let's see if there is a word with I and O.

""ALGAL"": not common and A in 1st? Not 3rd.

""ATTAR"": A, T, T, A, R -> T and R eliminated.

Not.

""ADIEU"": A, D, I, E, U -> E eliminated and A in 1st? Not 3rd.

I think ""FLAKY"" is a reasonable choice.

But we have to make sure that we are not using any eliminated letters.

Let's list the letters we have eliminated: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P

So for ""FLAKY"": F, L, A, K, Y -> none of these are eliminated. And A is in the 3rd.

Similarly, for ""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L -> none eliminated, A in 3rd.

But ""QUAIL"" has Q and U which are less common. ""FLAKY"" has more common letters: F, L, K, Y.

""FLAKY"" uses F, L, K, Y, which are all fairly common.

We can also consider ""BLUET"": not a word? ""BLUET"" is not standard. ""BLUTE"" has E.

Another word: ""GAWKY"": G, A, W, K, Y -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd.

""JAZZY"": J, A, Z, Z, Y -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd.

I think ""FLAKY"" is a good choice.

But let's try ""HAVOC"": H, A, V, O, C -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. C eliminated.

""KAVAS"": K, A, V, A, S -> A in 2nd and 4th? Not 3rd. S eliminated.

""BAWDY"": B, A, W, D, Y -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd.

""DAFT"": not 5 letters.

I found: ""FLAKY"" is a valid word.

So I'll go with ""FLAKY"".

But note: we are testing F, L, K, Y. If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Alternatively, we can use ""QUAIL"" to test Q, U, I, L.

But I think ""FLAKY"" is more common.

Another option: ""WACKY"" is not allowed.

""FLAKY"" seems good.

But let me check if there is a word with O.

""ALGUM"": not common.

""FLAVY""? Not a word.

""FLAKY"" is the best so far.

We can also consider ""BLAZE"": but E is eliminated.

""GLAZE"": E eliminated.

""BEIGE"": B, E, I, G, E -> E eliminated.

So I think ""FLAKY"" is a solid second guess.

Therefore, I'll guess ""FLAKY"".

But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""FLAKY"" is a valid English word.

So the next guess is ""FLAKY"".

But note: we are not using any eliminated letters.

So let's go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **A is confirmed in the 3rd position** (✓).
- **C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P are eliminated** (x).

For the next guess:
- Must have **A in the 3rd position**.
- Avoid eliminated letters (C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P).
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., F, L, K, Y, Q, U, I, L) to maximize information.

I chose **FLAKY** because:
- It places A in the 3rd position.
- Tests new common letters: F, L, K, Y.
- Uses distinct letters to cover more possibilities.
- Avoids eliminated letters and repeats.

We cannot use E.\n\n So avoid E.\n\n Another word: ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T -> no eliminated letters? \n   P, L, A, I, T: A is in the 3rd, and we are avoiding C, R, N, E.

Also, no C, R, N.\n\n However, we already know A is in the 3rd, so we can use that.\n\n But let me check: we have eliminated C, R, N, E. So we can use any other letters.\n\n Another common word: ""SHALT"" -> but that might be archaic? We should use common words.\n\n Let\'s stick with common words.\n\n I think ""PLAIT"" is a good candidate because it has two vowels (A and I) and three consonants (P, L, T) that we haven\'t tried.\n\n But note: we have already eliminated E, so the word might have other vowels? Like O, U, I?\n\n We can also consider ""OPALE"" but that has E which is eliminated.\n\n Another word: ""QUAIL"" -> Q, U, A, I, L -> but Q and U are less common? And we have A in the 3rd.\n\n But we want to test more common letters.\n\n Let me think of words that have S, T, L, and other common letters.\n\n ""SLANT"" -> but N is eliminated!

We need A in the 3rd.\n\n So the word must be: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5]\n\n We can use: \n   ""PLAIT: P L A I T -> positions: 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:I, 5:T\n   ""BLAST: B L A S T -> 1:B, 2:L, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T\n   ""STAMP: S T A M P -> 1:S, 2:T, 3:A, 4:M, 5:P\n   ""SHARD: S H A R D -> but R is eliminated!

Not the 3rd.\n\n So let\'s choose between ""PLAIT"" and ""STAMP"".\n\n I think ""STAMP"" is more common and has more common letters.\n\n But note: we have eliminated E, so the word might have O, U, I, O? \n\n We can also consider ""DAILY"": D A I L Y -> A is in the 2nd? No.\n\n We need the 3rd to be A.\n\n Let me think of words: \n   ""BEADY"" -> B E A D Y -> but E is eliminated! So we cannot use E.\n\n   ""HEADY"" -> H E A D Y -> E is eliminated.\n\n   ""LEAVE"" -> has E and also V? But E is eliminated.\n\n So avoid E.\n\n Another: ""QUAKE"" -> Q U A K E -> E is eliminated.\n\n So we avoid E.\n\n After some thought, I\'ll go with ""STAMP"".\n\n But wait, we have to make sure that we are not using any eliminated letters: \n   S, T, A, M, P -> none of C, R, N, E. So it\'s okay.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""SLACK"" -> but C is eliminated? Yes, C is eliminated. So we cannot use C.\n\n So ""STAMP"" is safe.\n\n Let me check: \n   S: not tested yet\n   T: not tested\n   A: we know is in the word and in the 3rd position (so we expect a check for A, but we are testing the position)\n   M: not tested\n   P: not tested\n\n This will give us information about S, T, M, P.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""PLAIT"" to test P, L, I, T.\n\n But I think ""STAMP"" is a good choice because S and T are very common at the beginning or the end.\n\n Since we know A is fixed in the 3rd, we can try to cover the other positions.\n\n I\'ll go with ""STAMP"".\n\n So the next guess: ""STAMP""\n\n But note: the feedback for A will be ✓ because we know it\'s in the 3rd. So we are mainly testing the other letters.\n\n Let me write the guess: STAMP\n\n However, note that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t know.\n\n We are hoping to get feedback on S, T, M, P.\n\n If we get a ✓ for A, then we know it\'s still in the 3rd (which we already know) and we get feedback on the others.\n\n So let\'s go with ""STAMP"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- A is confirmed in the 3rd position (✓).\n- C, R, N, E are eliminated (x).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must have A in the 3rd position.\n- Avoid using C, R, N, E.\n- Prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, M, P, L, I) to maximize information.\n\nI chose **STAMP** because:\n- It places A in the 3rd position.\n- Tests new common letters: S, T, M, P.\n- Avoids eliminated letters (C, R, N, E).\n- Uses distinct letters to cover more possibilities.\n\n<guess>stamp</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: stamp -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) M(x) P(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: ✓ (correct position, so the secret word has A in the 3rd position)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: ""stamp""\n- S: x (not in the word)\n- T: x (not in the word)\n- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is still in the 3rd position)\n- M: x (not in the word)\n- P: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, from both guesses, we know:\n- The secret word has A in the 3rd position: _ _ A _ _\n- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P\n\nWe have eliminated 8 letters: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that has A in the 3rd position and does not contain any of the eliminated letters.\n\nAvailable letters: We have not tested many letters.

Not A.\n\nI think ""FLAKY"" and ""QUAIL"" are options.\n\nBut let\'s think of more:\n\n- ""ABACK"": A, B, A, C, K -> A is in the 1st and 3rd? But we need the 3rd to be A, and the 1st should be A? But in this word, the 1st is A, 2nd is B, 3rd is A, 4th is C, 5th is K. But C is eliminated. So not.\n\nWe need the 3rd to be A, and the 1st,2nd,4th,5th to be from the available letters.\n\nAnother: ""BIALY"": B, I, A, L, Y -> but A is in the 3rd? \n  Position: 1:B, 2:I, 3:A, 4:L, 5:Y -> yes! And B, I, L, Y are available.\n\nBut is ""BIALY"" a common word? It might be obscure.\n\n""KAPUT"": K, A, P, U, T -> A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd. And P and T are eliminated.\n\n""LAUAN"": L, A, U, A, N -> A in 2nd and 4th? Not the 3rd. And N eliminated.\n\n""WAQFS"": W, A, Q, F, S -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. And S eliminated.\n\n""FAUNA"": F, A, U, N, A -> A in 2nd and 5th? Not 3rd. And N eliminated.\n\n""MAUVE"": M, A, U, V, E -> M and E eliminated.\n\n""HAUTE"": H, A, U, T, E -> T and E eliminated.\n\n""RAJAH"": R, A, J, A, H -> R eliminated and A in 2nd and 4th.\n\nI think ""FLAKY"" and ""QUAIL"" are reasonable.\n\nBut let\'s also consider ""BLAND"": B, L, A, N, D -> N eliminated.\n\n""GLAND"": G, L, A, N, D -> N eliminated.\n\n""PLAIT"": P, L, A, I, T -> P and T eliminated.\n\nSo without the eliminated letters, we have:\n\n- ""FLAKY"": F, L, A, K, Y\n- ""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L\n- ""BIALY"": B, I, A, L, Y\n- ""DIARY"": D, I, A, R, Y -> R eliminated\n- ""FIARY"": not a word? \n- ""LIARD"": not common and R eliminated.\n\nAnother: ""GUAVA"": G, U, A, V, A -> A in 3rd? \n  Position: 1:G, 2:U, 3:A, 4:V, 5:A -> yes! And G, U, V, A are available. But we have two A\'s? That\'s okay.\n\nBut ""GUAVA"" has two A\'s. We don\'t know if the secret word has two A\'s. But it\'s possible.\n\nSimilarly, ""FLAVA""? Not a word.\n\n""VAGUS"": V, A, G, U, S -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. S eliminated.\n\n""DOGMA"": D, O, G, M, A -> M eliminated and A in 5th? Not 3rd.\n\n""ALGAE"": A, L, G, A, E -> E eliminated and A in 1st and 4th? Not 3rd.\n\n""PHASE"": P eliminated.\n\n""CHASE"": C, H, A, S, E -> C, S, E eliminated.\n\nSo let\'s consider ""FLAKY"", ""QUAIL"", and ""GUAVA"".\n\n""GUAVA"" has G, U, V, A, A. We are testing G, U, V, and we already know A is in the 3rd and 5th? But we don\'t know if there is a 5th A. But we are allowed to use A again? The word must be valid, but we are trying to get information. However, if we use A again, we might get feedback on whether there is a second A.\n\nBut we have limited guesses, so we might want to test new letters.\n\n""FLAKY"" tests F, L, K, Y (and A again, but we know A is in the 3rd so the fourth letter is K and fifth Y, and first F).\n\n""QUAIL"" tests Q, U, I, L (and A in 3rd).\n\n""GUAVA"" tests G, U, V, and two A\'s (so we test G, U, V, and also whether there is an A in the fifth position).\n\nSince we have only 6 guesses, we might avoid repeating A to test more new letters.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has another A. However, we can try to avoid repeats to get more information.\n\nSo ""FLAKY"" and ""QUAIL"" are better because they have all distinct letters except that A is repeated in ""GUAVA"". But in ""GUAVA"", the A\'s are in different positions, so we can test if there is a fifth letter.\n\nBut let\'s see the available letters: we have many, so we can choose.\n\nI think ""FLAKY"" is a good choice because it uses common letters F, L, K, Y that we haven\'t tried.\n\n""QUAIL"" is also good because it tests Q, U, I, L.\n\nBut Q and U are less common, so ""FLAKY"" might be better.\n\nAnother word: ""WACKY"": W, A, C, K, Y -> C eliminated -> not allowed.\n\n""FLICK"": F, L, I, C, K -> C eliminated.\n\n""BLIMP"": B, L, I, M, P -> M and P eliminated.\n\n""JUICE"": J, U, I, C, E -> C and E eliminated.\n\n""QUITE"": Q, U, I, T, E -> T and E eliminated.\n\nSo I think ""FLAKY"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut let me check if there are words with more common letters.\n\nWhat about ""LABOR"": L, A, B, O, R -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. R eliminated.\n\n""LABIA"": L, A, B, I, A -> A in 2nd and 5th? Not 3rd.\n\n""GABON"": not common and N eliminated.\n\n""KAFIR"": K, A, F, I, R -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. R eliminated.\n\n""LAUAN"": not.\n\nPerhaps ""AVAIL"": A, V, A, I, L -> A in 1st and 3rd? But we need the 3rd to be A, and the 1st is A? But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. However, the 1st letter is A, so if we use A in the 1st, we might get feedback on that.\n\nBut ""AVAIL"": A, V, A, I, L -> positions: 1:A, 2:V, 3:A, 4:I, 5:L -> so the 3rd is A. And we are testing V, I, L, and A in the 1st and 5th.\n\nBut we already know A is in the 3rd, so we are testing the 1st and 5th as well.\n\nBut the word ""AVAIL"" is valid.\n\nHowever, we have eliminated letters: we are using A, V, I, L. V, I, L are available.\n\nBut we are repeating A. We know A is in the 3rd, so if we get a ✓ for A in the 1st or 5th, that would be new information.\n\nBut we are trying to find the secret word, so we can use this to test for multiple A\'s.\n\nBut in the feedback, for ""crane"" and ""stamp"", we only had one A and it was correct. If there were two A\'s, we wouldn\'t know.\n\nSo ""AVAIL"" is a possibility.\n\nBut let\'s compare to ""FLAKY"":\n\n""FLAKY"": tests F, L, K, Y (and A in the 3rd, which we know). We get feedback on F, L, K, Y.\n\n""AVAIL"": tests V, I, L (and A in 1st and 3rd). We get feedback on V, I, L, and also about the first A and the last A.\n\nBut ""AVAIL"" uses the letter I, which is a vowel, and we haven\'t tested I yet.\n\nWe haven\'t tested I, so that might be good.\n\nBut ""FLAKY"" tests F, L, K, Y which are also good.\n\nSince we have eliminated many vowels (E, A is known, but A is fixed), we should test other vowels: I, O, U.\n\nIn ""AVAIL"", we test I and also O? Not O in this word.\n\nIn ""FLAKY"", we test Y which can be a vowel sometimes.\n\nBut ""AVAIL"" has two A\'s, which might be useful if we suspect a double A, but we don\'t have evidence.\n\nI think ""FLAKY"" is a safer choice because it doesn\'t repeat A and tests four new letters.\n\nBut in ""FLAKY"", the A is only in the 3rd, so we are not testing for additional A\'s.\n\nWe can also consider ""OAKUM"": O, A, K, U, M -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. M eliminated.\n\n""DAHLia"": too long.\n\n5-letter words only.\n\nAnother: ""ABYSS"": A in 1st? Not 3rd.\n\nI think ""FLAKY"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me check if there is a word with O or U.\n\n""ALOUD"": A, L, O, U, D -> A in 1st? Not 3rd.\n\n""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O -> A in 1st? Not 3rd.\n\nWe need the 3rd to be A.\n\n""PIANO"": P, I, A, N, O -> P and N eliminated.\n\n""RADAR"": R, A, D, A, R -> R eliminated and A in 2nd and 4th.\n\nNot.\n\n""LAUDS"": L, A, U, D, S -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. S eliminated.\n\n""QUADS"": Q, U, A, D, S -> A in 3rd? \n  Position: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:A, 4:D, 5:S -> but S is eliminated. So not.\n\n""QUAFF"": Q, U, A, F, F -> A in 3rd? \n  1:Q, 2:U, 3:A, 4:F, 5:F -> but duplicate F. We can use duplicate letters? The rules don\'t forbid it, but it might not be efficient.\n\nBut we are trying to get information. If we use a word with duplicate letters, we might not know about as many letters.\n\nSo I think ""FLAKY"" is better because all letters are distinct.\n\nAnother word: ""WACKY"": not allowed because of C.\n\n""FLAKY"" seems good.\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word with I and O.\n\n""ALGAL"": not common and A in 1st? Not 3rd.\n\n""ATTAR"": A, T, T, A, R -> T and R eliminated.\n\nNot.\n\n""ADIEU"": A, D, I, E, U -> E eliminated and A in 1st? Not 3rd.\n\nI think ""FLAKY"" is a reasonable choice.\n\nBut we have to make sure that we are not using any eliminated letters.\n\nLet\'s list the letters we have eliminated: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P\n\nSo for ""FLAKY"": F, L, A, K, Y -> none of these are eliminated. And A is in the 3rd.\n\nSimilarly, for ""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L -> none eliminated, A in 3rd.\n\nBut ""QUAIL"" has Q and U which are less common. ""FLAKY"" has more common letters: F, L, K, Y.\n\n""FLAKY"" uses F, L, K, Y, which are all fairly common.\n\nWe can also consider ""BLUET"": not a word? ""BLUET"" is not standard. ""BLUTE"" has E.\n\nAnother word: ""GAWKY"": G, A, W, K, Y -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd.\n\n""JAZZY"": J, A, Z, Z, Y -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd.\n\nI think ""FLAKY"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let\'s try ""HAVOC"": H, A, V, O, C -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. C eliminated.\n\n""KAVAS"": K, A, V, A, S -> A in 2nd and 4th? Not 3rd. S eliminated.\n\n""BAWDY"": B, A, W, D, Y -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd.\n\n""DAFT"": not 5 letters.\n\nI found: ""FLAKY"" is a valid word.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""FLAKY"".\n\nBut note: we are testing F, L, K, Y. If we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""QUAIL"" to test Q, U, I, L.\n\nBut I think ""FLAKY"" is more common.\n\nAnother option: ""WACKY"" is not allowed.\n\n""FLAKY"" seems good.\n\nBut let me check if there is a word with O.\n\n""ALGUM"": not common.\n\n""FLAVY""? Not a word.\n\n""FLAKY"" is the best so far.\n\nWe can also consider ""BLAZE"": but E is eliminated.\n\n""GLAZE"": E eliminated.\n\n""BEIGE"": B, E, I, G, E -> E eliminated.\n\nSo I think ""FLAKY"" is a solid second guess.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll guess ""FLAKY"".\n\nBut wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""FLAKY"" is a valid English word.\n\nSo the next guess is ""FLAKY"".\n\nBut note: we are not using any eliminated letters.\n\nSo let\'s go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **A is confirmed in the 3rd position** (✓).\n- **C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P are eliminated** (x).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must have **A in the 3rd position**.\n- Avoid eliminated letters (C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P).\n- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., F, L, K, Y, Q, U, I, L) to maximize information.\n\nI chose **FLAKY** because:\n- It places A in the 3rd position.\n- Tests new common letters: F, L, K, Y.\n- Uses distinct letters to cover more possibilities.\n- Avoids eliminated letters and repeats.\n\n<guess>flaky</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: stamp -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) M(x) P(x)\nGuess 3: flaky -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(-) A(✓) K(x) Y(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, 3rd)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""stamp""
- S: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, 3rd)
- M: x (not in the word)
- P: x (not in the word)

Guess 3: ""flaky""
- F: x (not in the word)
- L: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: ✓ (correct position, 3rd)
- K: x (not in the word)
- Y: x (not in the word)

So, from all feedback, we know:

1. The secret word has the letter L in it, but not in the 2nd position (since in ""flaky"", L was in the 2nd and got a '-', meaning it's present but not there).
2. The secret word does not contain: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P, F, K, Y.
3. A is in the 3rd position and is correct.

The eliminated letters are: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P, F, K, Y.

Available letters: A, B, D, G, H, I, J, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (and L is in the word, but we don't know its position yet).

We also know that L is in the word, but not in the 2nd position. So L could be in position 1, 4, or 5.

The pattern is: _ _ A _ _

We need to form a word that has A in the 3rd position, includes L (but not in the 2nd), and uses only the available letters.

Let's list possible words:

- We need to fill positions 1, 2, 4, 5 with letters from: A, B, D, G, H, I, J, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, and we know L must be in one of 1,4,5 (but not 2).

But note: L can be in the word multiple times? The feedback only said L is in the word, but we don't know if it appears once or more. However, since we only have one L in the guesses, we don't know the count.

We must avoid the eliminated letters.

Let's try to think of words that fit the pattern and use the available letters.

Possible words:

- ""BLAND"": but N is eliminated -> not allowed
- ""BLAZE"": E eliminated -> not allowed
- ""BLAST"": S and T eliminated -> not allowed
- ""BLIMP"": M and P eliminated -> not allowed

We need to avoid the eliminated letters.

Another: ""DOULA"": D, O, U, L, A -> but A is in the 5th? Not the 3rd. We need A in the 3rd.

The pattern is: _ _ A _ _

So the 3rd is A, so the word must be: [1] [2] A [4] [5]

We need to choose letters from: A, B, D, G, H, I, J, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, and L must be in one of 1,4,5.

But L cannot be in position 2, which is already covered.

Let's try to find words:

- ""FLAVA""? Not a word.
- ""FLAKY"" we already tried, and K and Y are eliminated.

What about ""GLAZE"": has E -> eliminated.

""QUAFF"": Q, U, A, F, F -> F eliminated, and duplicate F? But F is eliminated.

""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L -> this is a candidate. Letters: Q, U, A, I, L. 
- Q: not tested
- U: not tested
- A: in 3rd (known)
- I: not tested
- L: in the word, but we are using it in the 5th position. We know L is not in the 2nd, but we don't know about the 5th.

In ""QUAIL"", L is in the 5th position. That's allowed because we haven't tested the 5th position for L.

Another word: ""QUAIL"" is valid.

But we have to check if the letters are available: 
- Q: not eliminated -> okay
- U: not eliminated -> okay
- A: known in 3rd -> okay
- I: not tested -> okay
- L: in the word -> okay, and we are testing it in the 5th.

But we are using Q and U, which are less common. However, we have to use the available letters.

Another possibility: ""WAQFS"" -> but S eliminated and A not in 3rd.

""JUMBO"": M eliminated.

""DOULA"": D, O, U, L, A -> pattern: 1:D, 2:O, 3:? -> but we need A in 3rd? This has L in the 4th and A in the 5th? Not 3rd.

We need the 3rd to be A.

""BALDY"": B, A, L, D, Y -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. Y eliminated.

""HALLO"": H, A, L, L, O -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd.

""GAWKY"": G, A, W, K, Y -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. K and Y eliminated.

""JAWAB"": J, A, W, A, B -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd.

""LAUAN"": L, A, U, A, N -> A in 2nd and 4th? Not 3rd. N eliminated.

""OAKUM"": O, A, K, U, M -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. K and M eliminated.

""QUAKE"": Q, U, A, K, E -> E eliminated and K eliminated.

""QUAIL"" seems a good candidate.

Another word: ""VIXEN"": V, I, X, E, N -> E and N eliminated.

""WOVEN"": W, O, V, E, N -> E and N eliminated.

""JUVEN"": not a word.

""QUAFF"" is not common and has F.

""QUAIL"" is a valid word.

Another: ""DOZEN"": D, O, Z, E, N -> E and N eliminated.

""GUANO"": G, U, A, N, O -> N eliminated.

""GUAVA"": G, U, A, V, A -> this has A in the 3rd? 
  Position: 1:G, 2:U, 3:A, 4:V, 5:A -> yes! And G, U, V, A are available. But we have two A's. We know A is in the 3rd, so the 5th is another A? That's possible.

But we are testing G, U, V, and the second A.

But we have to avoid eliminated letters: G, U, V are available, and A is already known.

But we are using A again in the 5th. We know A is in the 3rd, so if we get a ✓ for the 5th A, that would be new information.

But we are also testing G, U, V.

Is ""GUAVA"" common? It is a word.

But we have to consider that we are testing three new letters: G, U, V, and the fifth letter is A again.

We can also consider ""FLAVA"" - not a word.

""QUAIL"" tests Q, U, I, L (and A in 3rd).

""QUAIL"" uses Q and U, which are less common, but I is a common vowel.

Another word: ""BIJOU"": B, I, J, O, U -> but A not in 3rd.

We need A in the 3rd.

""BIALY"": B, I, A, L, Y -> but Y eliminated.

""DIARY"": D, I, A, R, Y -> R and Y eliminated.

""FIEST"": F and E and S eliminated.

""GIANT"": G, I, A, N, T -> N and T eliminated.

""GIANT"" has N and T, which are eliminated.

""HOAGY"": H, O, A, G, Y -> Y eliminated.

""HOBBY"": H, O, B, B, Y -> Y eliminated and duplicate B.

""JUMBO"": M eliminated.

""LABIA"": L, A, B, I, A -> A in 2nd and 5th? Not 3rd.

""LABOR"": L, A, B, O, R -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. R eliminated.

""LACKO"": C and K eliminated.

""LADLE"": L, A, D, L, E -> E eliminated and duplicate L? But L is in the word, but we are using it in the 1st and 4th? Not efficient and E eliminated.

""LARGO"": L, A, R, G, O -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. R eliminated.

""LAUAN"": not.

""OAKUM"": not.

""QUAIL"" seems to be one of the few options.

Another: ""DOULA"": D, O, U, L, A -> pattern: 1:D, 2:O, 3:? -> but the 3rd is L? Not A. We need the 3rd to be A.

""DOULA"" is D-O-U-L-A, so position 3 is L, not A.

We need the 3rd to be A.

""GUANO"": not.

""GUAVA"": G, U, A, V, A -> 1:G, 2:U, 3:A, 4:V, 5:A -> yes, the 3rd is A.

And letters: G, U, V, A, A. 
- G: available
- U: available
- V: available
- A: known in 3rd and also in 5th (so we are testing for a second A)

But we are using two A's. We know A is in the 3rd, so if we get a ✓ for the 5th A, that would be new.

But we are also testing G, U, V.

Is ""GUAVA"" common? Yes.

But we have to compare with ""QUAIL"".

""QUAIL"" uses Q, U, I, L, and A in 3rd and 5th? No, ""QUAIL"" has only one A? 
""QUAIL"": Q-U-A-I-L -> only one A, in the 3rd.

""GUAVA"": G-U-A-V-A -> two A's.

We can also consider ""VAUCH"": not a word.

""QUAIL"" might be better because it has more distinct letters? ""GUAVA"" has two A's, so we are testing fewer new letters.

In ""QUAIL"", we test Q, U, I, L (and A in 3rd, which we know). So we test four new letters: Q, U, I, L.

In ""GUAVA"", we test G, U, V, and the second A, so we test three new letters: G, U, V.

Therefore, ""QUAIL"" tests more new letters.

But Q and U are less common, but we have to use them because they are available.

Another word: ""WAQFS"" -> not.

""JAWAB"": not.

""LAUAN"": not.

""QUAIL"" is a valid option.

But let's see if there is a word with O or I.

""QUOIN"": Q, U, O, I, N -> N eliminated and A not in 3rd.

""QUOTA"": Q, U, O, T, A -> T eliminated and A in 5th? Not 3rd.

""VODKA"": V, O, D, K, A -> K eliminated and A in 5th.

""VOILA"": V, O, I, L, A -> pattern: 1:V, 2:O, 3:I, 4:L, 5:A -> but we need the 3rd to be A, not I. So no.

We need the 3rd to be A.

""BIAS"": not 5 letters.

""QUAIL"" seems the best.

But we have to consider that L is in the word, and in ""QUAIL"" it is in the 5th. We know L is not in the 2nd, but we don't know about the 5th.

Another word: ""DUVET"": D, U, V, E, T -> E and T eliminated.

""JUVEN"": not a word.

""QUAIL"" is a valid word.

But let's check if there is a word with L in the 1st or 4th.

For example, with L in the 1st: ""L_ _ A _ _""

But we need the 3rd to be A, so the word must be: L [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5]

What letters for position 2? It cannot be L (because if L is in the 1st, we don't know if it can be repeated? But we don't know if the word has two L's. However, we haven't tested L in other positions.

But we know L is in the word, but we don't know the position. So we can try to put L in a new position.

In ""flaky"", L was in position 2 and got a '-', so it's not in 2, so we can try position 1, 4, or 5.

In ""QUAIL"", we put L in position 5.

In ""GUAVA"", we put L in position 4? 
""GUAVA"": G-U-A-V-A -> position 4 is V, position 5 is A. So L is not in this word? But we know L must be in the word. ""GUAVA"" does not contain L. So it cannot be the word because L is missing.

We must include L in the guess because we know it's in the word.

So the word must contain L.

Therefore, we cannot use ""GUAVA"" because it doesn't have L.

Similarly, we must use L.

So back to ""QUAIL"": it has L and A in the 3rd.

Another word: ""QUILL"": Q, U, I, L, L -> but duplicate L? And the pattern: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:I, 4:L, 5:L -> but we need the 3rd to be A, not I. So not.

We need the 3rd to be A.

""QUAIL"" is the only common word I can think of that fits: 
- Position 1: Q
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: A (fixed)
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: L

And all letters are available: Q, U, I, L are all in the available set (Q, U, I, L are not eliminated, and A is known).

But Q and U are less common, but it's a valid word.

Another word: ""QUAFF"" is not, because of F and duplicate F? But F is eliminated.

""QUAKE"" is out because of E and K.

""QUART"": Q, U, A, R, T -> R and T eliminated.

""QUART"" has R and T, which are eliminated.

""QUASI"": Q, U, A, S, I -> S eliminated.

""QUASI"" has S, which is eliminated.

""QUOTA"": Q, U, O, T, A -> T eliminated and A in 5th.

Not.

""VODKA"": K eliminated and A in 5th.

I think ""QUAIL"" is the best option.

But let's see if there is a word with O or I.

""ALOUD"": A in 1st? Not 3rd.

""AUDIO"": A in 1st? Not 3rd.

""OBIIT"": not a word.

""QUAIL"" is the word.

But we have to consider that we are using two vowels: U and I. We haven't tested U and I.

We can also consider ""BLUID""? Not a word.

""GLYPH"": G, L, Y, P, H -> Y and P eliminated, and no A.

We need A in the 3rd.

""BLUET"": not a word.

""FLUID"": F eliminated and A not in 3rd.

I think ""QUAIL"" is the only common word that fits.

But let's check: is there a word like ""L_ _ A _ _"" with A in 3rd?

For example, ""LUCRE"": L, U, C, R, E -> C, R, E eliminated.

""LAMAR"": L, A, M, A, R -> M and R eliminated.

""LAPIN"": L, A, P, I, N -> P and N eliminated.

""LARVA"": L, A, R, V, A -> R eliminated.

""LEAVE"": L, E, A, V, E -> E eliminated.

""LIBRA"": L, I, B, R, A -> R eliminated and A in 5th.

Not.

""LIVID"": L, I, V, I, D -> no A.

We need A in the 3rd.

""LAVAS"": L, A, V, A, S -> A in 2nd and 4th? Not 3rd. S eliminated.

""LAVAS"" has S eliminated.

""LAWNS"": L, A, W, N, S -> N and S eliminated.

""LAWns"" has N and S.

""LAWNS"" is not allowed.

""LAWNS"" -> N and S eliminated.

""LAWS"": not 5 letters.

I think we have to go with ""QUAIL"".

But let's see if there is a word with O.

""ALGAL"": A in 1st? Not 3rd.

""ATTAR"": A in 1st? Not 3rd.

""AVAIL"": A in 1st and 3rd? But we need the 3rd to be A, and the 1st is A? But we don't know if the word has two A's. However, in ""AVAIL"", the 3rd is A, so that's good. But the 1st is A, which we know is in the 3rd, so if we use A in the 1st, we might get feedback on whether there is a second A.

But we are avoiding eliminated letters: A, V, A, I, L -> A is known, V, I, L are available.

But we have two A's. The pattern is: A V A I L -> so position 1: A, 2: V, 3: A? No, 3 is A? 
A V A I L -> position 1: A, 2: V, 3: A, 4: I, 5: L -> so the 3rd is A, which is good. But we are using A in the 1st and 3rd. We know the 3rd is A, so the 1st A might be another occurrence.

But we are testing for multiple A's.

However, we have to avoid eliminated letters: A, V, I, L are available? 
- A: we know is in the word, but we are testing if it appears again.
- V: not tested -> okay
- I: not tested -> okay
- L: in the word, testing it in the 5th position.

But we are using two A's, which might be inefficient for information.

Moreover, ""AVAIL"" has A in the 1st, which we don't know about.

But we are testing the 1st position with A.

Alternatively, we can use ""QUAIL"" which has only one A.

I think ""QUAIL"" is better because it tests more new letters.

But let's see the feedback we got for ""flaky"": L is in the word but not in the 2nd. So in ""QUAIL"", we are putting L in the 5th. If L is in the 5th, we might get a ✓ or a '-'.

Similarly, in ""QUAIL"", we are putting U in the 2nd and I in the 4th.

We haven't tested U or I.

In ""AVAIL"", we test V, I, and A in the 1st.

But ""AVAIL"" has A in the 1st, which we don't know about, and we are testing V and I.

But we are repeating A.

I think ""QUAIL"" is a better choice.

But we have to consider that the word might have the 3rd letter as A and the 5th as A? But that would be ""AVAIL"", which has A in the 1st and 3rd.

But we don't know if the word has two A's.

To maximize information, we should avoid repeating known letters? But we know A is in the 3rd, so if we use A in the 1st, we can test if there is a second A.

But we have limited guesses, so we might want to test new letters.

Since we have many available letters, we can choose a word that tests more common letters.

Common letters left: B, D, G, H, I, O, U.

In ""QUAIL"", we test Q, U, I, L.

In ""AVAIL"", we test V, I, and the second A (so effectively three tests: V, I, and the A in 1st).

But ""AVAIL"" has two A's, so we are testing two positions for A? But we know A is in the 3rd, so if we get a ✓ for the first A, that means there is an A in the 1st and 3rd? But the 3rd is already known, so if we get ✓ for the first A, then the word has A in 1st and 3rd.

But we don't know if that's the case.

We can also consider ""QUAIL"" to test more new letters.

But let's see the available letters: we have many, but we need to cover them.

Another word: ""DOULA"" -> D, O, U, L, A -> pattern: 1:D, 2:O, 3:L, 4:U, 5:A -> but we need the 3rd to be A, not L. So not.

""DOULA"" has L in the 3rd? Not A.

I think we have to go with ""QUAIL"" or ""AVAIL"".

But ""AVAIL"" has the advantage of testing if there is an A in the 1st, but ""QUAIL"" tests more new letters.

Since we have only 6 guesses, and we have 3 left, we can try ""QUAIL"".

But let's see if there is a word with O.

""ALGAL"" not.

""ATTAR"" not.

""AVOID"": A in 1st? Not 3rd.

""AVOWS"": A in 1st? Not 3rd.

""BAWDY"": A in 2nd? Not 3rd.

I think ""QUAIL"" is the best.

But let's check the dictionary: ""QUAIL"" is a valid word.

""GUAVA"" is also valid, but has two A's.

But to test more letters, ""QUAIL"" has four new letters: Q, U, I, L.

""GUAVA"" has three: G, U, V, and the second A.

So ""QUAIL"" tests more letters.

Moreover, in ""QUAIL"", we are putting L in the 5th position. We know L is in the word, and we haven't tested the 5th for L.

In ""AVAIL"", we put A in the 1st and 3rd, and L in the 5th.

But we know the 3rd is A, so if we put A in the 1st, we might get feedback on whether there is a second A.

But we are using a known letter A in the 1st, which we don't need to test again? We know A is in the 3rd, so if we put A in the 1st, and if it's not in the word, we get x, which tells us there is no second A. If we get ✓, then there is a second A in the 1st.

But we are using a guess to test that.

Similarly, in ""QUAIL"", we are not testing the 1st position with A.

So both are possible.

But I think ""QUAIL"" is better because it tests four new letters without repeating known letters.

So I'll go with ""QUAIL"".

But let's confirm the pattern: Q-U-A-I-L -> positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:A (known), 4:I, 5:L.

We are testing:
- Q in position 1
- U in position 2
- I in position 4
- L in position 5

And we know A in position 3 is correct.

So we'll get feedback on Q, U, I, L.

If L is in the 5th, we might get a ✓ for L, or a '-' if it's in the word but not 5th.

Similarly for the others.

So I think it's a good guess.

Therefore, the next guess is ""QUAIL"".

But note: we have to make sure that Q and U are not eliminated. They are not in the eliminated list.

Eliminated: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P, F, K, Y.

So Q and U are available.

I think ""QUAIL"" is the word to guess.

But let's see if there is a word with O.

""QUAGO""? Not a word.

""QUAFF"" is not.

""QUAIL"" is the best.

So I'll go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **A is confirmed in the 3rd position** (✓).
- **L is in the word but not in the 2nd position** (-).
- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P, F, K, Y (all x).

The secret word pattern is: _ _ A _ _

Available letters: A, B, D, G, H, I, J, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (and L must be included).

Since L is in the word but position unknown (not 2nd), it must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

After evaluating possible words:
- **QUAIL** is a valid option that fits the pattern (_ _ A _ _) and includes L in the 5th position (testing if L is there).
- It tests new common letters: Q, U, I (and L in a new position).
- Avoids all eliminated letters.

<guess>quail</guess>",quail,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, 3rd)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""stamp""
- S: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, 3rd)
- M: x (not in the word)
- P: x (not in the word)

Guess 3: ""flaky""
- F: x (not in the word)
- L: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: ✓ (correct position, 3rd)
- K: x (not in the word)
- Y: x (not in the word)

So, from all feedback, we know:

1. The secret word has the letter L in it, but not in the 2nd position (since in ""flaky"", L was in the 2nd and got a '-', meaning it's present but not there).
2. The secret word does not contain: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P, F, K, Y.
3. A is in the 3rd position and is correct.

The eliminated letters are: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P, F, K, Y.

Available letters: A, B, D, G, H, I, J, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (and L is in the word, but we don't know its position yet).

We also know that L is in the word, but not in the 2nd position. So L could be in position 1, 4, or 5.

The pattern is: _ _ A _ _

We need to form a word that has A in the 3rd position, includes L (but not in the 2nd), and uses only the available letters.

Let's list possible words:

- We need to fill positions 1, 2, 4, 5 with letters from: A, B, D, G, H, I, J, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, and we know L must be in one of 1,4,5 (but not 2).

But note: L can be in the word multiple times? The feedback only said L is in the word, but we don't know if it appears once or more. However, since we only have one L in the guesses, we don't know the count.

We must avoid the eliminated letters.

Let's try to think of words that fit the pattern and use the available letters.

Possible words:

- ""BLAND"": but N is eliminated -> not allowed
- ""BLAZE"": E eliminated -> not allowed
- ""BLAST"": S and T eliminated -> not allowed
- ""BLIMP"": M and P eliminated -> not allowed

We need to avoid the eliminated letters.

Another: ""DOULA"": D, O, U, L, A -> but A is in the 5th? Not the 3rd. We need A in the 3rd.

The pattern is: _ _ A _ _

So the 3rd is A, so the word must be: [1] [2] A [4] [5]

We need to choose letters from: A, B, D, G, H, I, J, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, and L must be in one of 1,4,5.

But L cannot be in position 2, which is already covered.

Let's try to find words:

- ""FLAVA""? Not a word.
- ""FLAKY"" we already tried, and K and Y are eliminated.

What about ""GLAZE"": has E -> eliminated.

""QUAFF"": Q, U, A, F, F -> F eliminated, and duplicate F? But F is eliminated.

""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L -> this is a candidate. Letters: Q, U, A, I, L. 
- Q: not tested
- U: not tested
- A: in 3rd (known)
- I: not tested
- L: in the word, but we are using it in the 5th position. We know L is not in the 2nd, but we don't know about the 5th.

In ""QUAIL"", L is in the 5th position. That's allowed because we haven't tested the 5th position for L.

Another word: ""QUAIL"" is valid.

But we have to check if the letters are available: 
- Q: not eliminated -> okay
- U: not eliminated -> okay
- A: known in 3rd -> okay
- I: not tested -> okay
- L: in the word -> okay, and we are testing it in the 5th.

But we are using Q and U, which are less common. However, we have to use the available letters.

Another possibility: ""WAQFS"" -> but S eliminated and A not in 3rd.

""JUMBO"": M eliminated.

""DOULA"": D, O, U, L, A -> pattern: 1:D, 2:O, 3:? -> but we need A in 3rd? This has L in the 4th and A in the 5th? Not 3rd.

We need the 3rd to be A.

""BALDY"": B, A, L, D, Y -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. Y eliminated.

""HALLO"": H, A, L, L, O -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd.

""GAWKY"": G, A, W, K, Y -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. K and Y eliminated.

""JAWAB"": J, A, W, A, B -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd.

""LAUAN"": L, A, U, A, N -> A in 2nd and 4th? Not 3rd. N eliminated.

""OAKUM"": O, A, K, U, M -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. K and M eliminated.

""QUAKE"": Q, U, A, K, E -> E eliminated and K eliminated.

""QUAIL"" seems a good candidate.

Another word: ""VIXEN"": V, I, X, E, N -> E and N eliminated.

""WOVEN"": W, O, V, E, N -> E and N eliminated.

""JUVEN"": not a word.

""QUAFF"" is not common and has F.

""QUAIL"" is a valid word.

Another: ""DOZEN"": D, O, Z, E, N -> E and N eliminated.

""GUANO"": G, U, A, N, O -> N eliminated.

""GUAVA"": G, U, A, V, A -> this has A in the 3rd? 
  Position: 1:G, 2:U, 3:A, 4:V, 5:A -> yes! And G, U, V, A are available. But we have two A's. We know A is in the 3rd, so the 5th is another A? That's possible.

But we are testing G, U, V, and the second A.

But we have to avoid eliminated letters: G, U, V are available, and A is already known.

But we are using A again in the 5th. We know A is in the 3rd, so if we get a ✓ for the 5th A, that would be new information.

But we are also testing G, U, V.

Is ""GUAVA"" common? It is a word.

But we have to consider that we are testing three new letters: G, U, V, and the fifth letter is A again.

We can also consider ""FLAVA"" - not a word.

""QUAIL"" tests Q, U, I, L (and A in 3rd).

""QUAIL"" uses Q and U, which are less common, but I is a common vowel.

Another word: ""BIJOU"": B, I, J, O, U -> but A not in 3rd.

We need A in the 3rd.

""BIALY"": B, I, A, L, Y -> but Y eliminated.

""DIARY"": D, I, A, R, Y -> R and Y eliminated.

""FIEST"": F and E and S eliminated.

""GIANT"": G, I, A, N, T -> N and T eliminated.

""GIANT"" has N and T, which are eliminated.

""HOAGY"": H, O, A, G, Y -> Y eliminated.

""HOBBY"": H, O, B, B, Y -> Y eliminated and duplicate B.

""JUMBO"": M eliminated.

""LABIA"": L, A, B, I, A -> A in 2nd and 5th? Not 3rd.

""LABOR"": L, A, B, O, R -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. R eliminated.

""LACKO"": C and K eliminated.

""LADLE"": L, A, D, L, E -> E eliminated and duplicate L? But L is in the word, but we are using it in the 1st and 4th? Not efficient and E eliminated.

""LARGO"": L, A, R, G, O -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. R eliminated.

""LAUAN"": not.

""OAKUM"": not.

""QUAIL"" seems to be one of the few options.

Another: ""DOULA"": D, O, U, L, A -> pattern: 1:D, 2:O, 3:? -> but the 3rd is L? Not A. We need the 3rd to be A.

""DOULA"" is D-O-U-L-A, so position 3 is L, not A.

We need the 3rd to be A.

""GUANO"": not.

""GUAVA"": G, U, A, V, A -> 1:G, 2:U, 3:A, 4:V, 5:A -> yes, the 3rd is A.

And letters: G, U, V, A, A. 
- G: available
- U: available
- V: available
- A: known in 3rd and also in 5th (so we are testing for a second A)

But we are using two A's. We know A is in the 3rd, so if we get a ✓ for the 5th A, that would be new.

But we are also testing G, U, V.

Is ""GUAVA"" common? Yes.

But we have to compare with ""QUAIL"".

""QUAIL"" uses Q, U, I, L, and A in 3rd and 5th? No, ""QUAIL"" has only one A? 
""QUAIL"": Q-U-A-I-L -> only one A, in the 3rd.

""GUAVA"": G-U-A-V-A -> two A's.

We can also consider ""VAUCH"": not a word.

""QUAIL"" might be better because it has more distinct letters? ""GUAVA"" has two A's, so we are testing fewer new letters.

In ""QUAIL"", we test Q, U, I, L (and A in 3rd, which we know). So we test four new letters: Q, U, I, L.

In ""GUAVA"", we test G, U, V, and the second A, so we test three new letters: G, U, V.

Therefore, ""QUAIL"" tests more new letters.

But Q and U are less common, but we have to use them because they are available.

Another word: ""WAQFS"" -> not.

""JAWAB"": not.

""LAUAN"": not.

""QUAIL"" is a valid option.

But let's see if there is a word with O or I.

""QUOIN"": Q, U, O, I, N -> N eliminated and A not in 3rd.

""QUOTA"": Q, U, O, T, A -> T eliminated and A in 5th? Not 3rd.

""VODKA"": V, O, D, K, A -> K eliminated and A in 5th.

""VOILA"": V, O, I, L, A -> pattern: 1:V, 2:O, 3:I, 4:L, 5:A -> but we need the 3rd to be A, not I. So no.

We need the 3rd to be A.

""BIAS"": not 5 letters.

""QUAIL"" seems the best.

But we have to consider that L is in the word, and in ""QUAIL"" it is in the 5th. We know L is not in the 2nd, but we don't know about the 5th.

Another word: ""DUVET"": D, U, V, E, T -> E and T eliminated.

""JUVEN"": not a word.

""QUAIL"" is a valid word.

But let's check if there is a word with L in the 1st or 4th.

For example, with L in the 1st: ""L_ _ A _ _""

But we need the 3rd to be A, so the word must be: L [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5]

What letters for position 2? It cannot be L (because if L is in the 1st, we don't know if it can be repeated? But we don't know if the word has two L's. However, we haven't tested L in other positions.

But we know L is in the word, but we don't know the position. So we can try to put L in a new position.

In ""flaky"", L was in position 2 and got a '-', so it's not in 2, so we can try position 1, 4, or 5.

In ""QUAIL"", we put L in position 5.

In ""GUAVA"", we put L in position 4? 
""GUAVA"": G-U-A-V-A -> position 4 is V, position 5 is A. So L is not in this word? But we know L must be in the word. ""GUAVA"" does not contain L. So it cannot be the word because L is missing.

We must include L in the guess because we know it's in the word.

So the word must contain L.

Therefore, we cannot use ""GUAVA"" because it doesn't have L.

Similarly, we must use L.

So back to ""QUAIL"": it has L and A in the 3rd.

Another word: ""QUILL"": Q, U, I, L, L -> but duplicate L? And the pattern: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:I, 4:L, 5:L -> but we need the 3rd to be A, not I. So not.

We need the 3rd to be A.

""QUAIL"" is the only common word I can think of that fits: 
- Position 1: Q
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: A (fixed)
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: L

And all letters are available: Q, U, I, L are all in the available set (Q, U, I, L are not eliminated, and A is known).

But Q and U are less common, but it's a valid word.

Another word: ""QUAFF"" is not, because of F and duplicate F? But F is eliminated.

""QUAKE"" is out because of E and K.

""QUART"": Q, U, A, R, T -> R and T eliminated.

""QUART"" has R and T, which are eliminated.

""QUASI"": Q, U, A, S, I -> S eliminated.

""QUASI"" has S, which is eliminated.

""QUOTA"": Q, U, O, T, A -> T eliminated and A in 5th.

Not.

""VODKA"": K eliminated and A in 5th.

I think ""QUAIL"" is the best option.

But let's see if there is a word with O or I.

""ALOUD"": A in 1st? Not 3rd.

""AUDIO"": A in 1st? Not 3rd.

""OBIIT"": not a word.

""QUAIL"" is the word.

But we have to consider that we are using two vowels: U and I. We haven't tested U and I.

We can also consider ""BLUID""? Not a word.

""GLYPH"": G, L, Y, P, H -> Y and P eliminated, and no A.

We need A in the 3rd.

""BLUET"": not a word.

""FLUID"": F eliminated and A not in 3rd.

I think ""QUAIL"" is the only common word that fits.

But let's check: is there a word like ""L_ _ A _ _"" with A in 3rd?

For example, ""LUCRE"": L, U, C, R, E -> C, R, E eliminated.

""LAMAR"": L, A, M, A, R -> M and R eliminated.

""LAPIN"": L, A, P, I, N -> P and N eliminated.

""LARVA"": L, A, R, V, A -> R eliminated.

""LEAVE"": L, E, A, V, E -> E eliminated.

""LIBRA"": L, I, B, R, A -> R eliminated and A in 5th.

Not.

""LIVID"": L, I, V, I, D -> no A.

We need A in the 3rd.

""LAVAS"": L, A, V, A, S -> A in 2nd and 4th? Not 3rd. S eliminated.

""LAVAS"" has S eliminated.

""LAWNS"": L, A, W, N, S -> N and S eliminated.

""LAWns"" has N and S.

""LAWNS"" is not allowed.

""LAWNS"" -> N and S eliminated.

""LAWS"": not 5 letters.

I think we have to go with ""QUAIL"".

But let's see if there is a word with O.

""ALGAL"": A in 1st? Not 3rd.

""ATTAR"": A in 1st? Not 3rd.

""AVAIL"": A in 1st and 3rd? But we need the 3rd to be A, and the 1st is A? But we don't know if the word has two A's. However, in ""AVAIL"", the 3rd is A, so that's good. But the 1st is A, which we know is in the 3rd, so if we use A in the 1st, we might get feedback on whether there is a second A.

But we are avoiding eliminated letters: A, V, A, I, L -> A is known, V, I, L are available.

But we have two A's. The pattern is: A V A I L -> so position 1: A, 2: V, 3: A? No, 3 is A? 
A V A I L -> position 1: A, 2: V, 3: A, 4: I, 5: L -> so the 3rd is A, which is good. But we are using A in the 1st and 3rd. We know the 3rd is A, so the 1st A might be another occurrence.

But we are testing for multiple A's.

However, we have to avoid eliminated letters: A, V, I, L are available? 
- A: we know is in the word, but we are testing if it appears again.
- V: not tested -> okay
- I: not tested -> okay
- L: in the word, testing it in the 5th position.

But we are using two A's, which might be inefficient for information.

Moreover, ""AVAIL"" has A in the 1st, which we don't know about.

But we are testing the 1st position with A.

Alternatively, we can use ""QUAIL"" which has only one A.

I think ""QUAIL"" is better because it tests more new letters.

But let's see the feedback we got for ""flaky"": L is in the word but not in the 2nd. So in ""QUAIL"", we are putting L in the 5th. If L is in the 5th, we might get a ✓ or a '-'.

Similarly, in ""QUAIL"", we are putting U in the 2nd and I in the 4th.

We haven't tested U or I.

In ""AVAIL"", we test V, I, and A in the 1st.

But ""AVAIL"" has A in the 1st, which we don't know about, and we are testing V and I.

But we are repeating A.

I think ""QUAIL"" is a better choice.

But we have to consider that the word might have the 3rd letter as A and the 5th as A? But that would be ""AVAIL"", which has A in the 1st and 3rd.

But we don't know if the word has two A's.

To maximize information, we should avoid repeating known letters? But we know A is in the 3rd, so if we use A in the 1st, we can test if there is a second A.

But we have limited guesses, so we might want to test new letters.

Since we have many available letters, we can choose a word that tests more common letters.

Common letters left: B, D, G, H, I, O, U.

In ""QUAIL"", we test Q, U, I, L.

In ""AVAIL"", we test V, I, and the second A (so effectively three tests: V, I, and the A in 1st).

But ""AVAIL"" has two A's, so we are testing two positions for A? But we know A is in the 3rd, so if we get a ✓ for the first A, that means there is an A in the 1st and 3rd? But the 3rd is already known, so if we get ✓ for the first A, then the word has A in 1st and 3rd.

But we don't know if that's the case.

We can also consider ""QUAIL"" to test more new letters.

But let's see the available letters: we have many, but we need to cover them.

Another word: ""DOULA"" -> D, O, U, L, A -> pattern: 1:D, 2:O, 3:L, 4:U, 5:A -> but we need the 3rd to be A, not L. So not.

""DOULA"" has L in the 3rd? Not A.

I think we have to go with ""QUAIL"" or ""AVAIL"".

But ""AVAIL"" has the advantage of testing if there is an A in the 1st, but ""QUAIL"" tests more new letters.

Since we have only 6 guesses, and we have 3 left, we can try ""QUAIL"".

But let's see if there is a word with O.

""ALGAL"" not.

""ATTAR"" not.

""AVOID"": A in 1st? Not 3rd.

""AVOWS"": A in 1st? Not 3rd.

""BAWDY"": A in 2nd? Not 3rd.

I think ""QUAIL"" is the best.

But let's check the dictionary: ""QUAIL"" is a valid word.

""GUAVA"" is also valid, but has two A's.

But to test more letters, ""QUAIL"" has four new letters: Q, U, I, L.

""GUAVA"" has three: G, U, V, and the second A.

So ""QUAIL"" tests more letters.

Moreover, in ""QUAIL"", we are putting L in the 5th position. We know L is in the word, and we haven't tested the 5th for L.

In ""AVAIL"", we put A in the 1st and 3rd, and L in the 5th.

But we know the 3rd is A, so if we put A in the 1st, we might get feedback on whether there is a second A.

But we are using a known letter A in the 1st, which we don't need to test again? We know A is in the 3rd, so if we put A in the 1st, and if it's not in the word, we get x, which tells us there is no second A. If we get ✓, then there is a second A in the 1st.

But we are using a guess to test that.

Similarly, in ""QUAIL"", we are not testing the 1st position with A.

So both are possible.

But I think ""QUAIL"" is better because it tests four new letters without repeating known letters.

So I'll go with ""QUAIL"".

But let's confirm the pattern: Q-U-A-I-L -> positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:A (known), 4:I, 5:L.

We are testing:
- Q in position 1
- U in position 2
- I in position 4
- L in position 5

And we know A in position 3 is correct.

So we'll get feedback on Q, U, I, L.

If L is in the 5th, we might get a ✓ for L, or a '-' if it's in the word but not 5th.

Similarly for the others.

So I think it's a good guess.

Therefore, the next guess is ""QUAIL"".

But note: we have to make sure that Q and U are not eliminated. They are not in the eliminated list.

Eliminated: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P, F, K, Y.

So Q and U are available.

I think ""QUAIL"" is the word to guess.

But let's see if there is a word with O.

""QUAGO""? Not a word.

""QUAFF"" is not.

""QUAIL"" is the best.

So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **A is confirmed in the 3rd position** (✓).
- **L is in the word but not in the 2nd position** (-).
- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P, F, K, Y (all x).

The secret word pattern is: _ _ A _ _

Available letters: A, B, D, G, H, I, J, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (and L must be included).

Since L is in the word but position unknown (not 2nd), it must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

After evaluating possible words:
- **QUAIL** is a valid option that fits the pattern (_ _ A _ _) and includes L in the 5th position (testing if L is there).
- It tests new common letters: Q, U, I (and L in a new position).
- Avoids all eliminated letters.",Guess 4: quail -> FEEDBACK: Q(x) U(x) A(✓) I(x) L(-),FAIL

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 04 Sep 2025

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: ✓ (correct position, so the secret word has A in the 3rd position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word has the letter A in the 3rd position.
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

 Since R and E are not in the word, and we know the word has A in the 3rd position, we can try to form a new word.

 We must avoid using C, R, N, E.

 Let's think of common 5-letter words that have A in the 3rd position.

 The pattern is: _ _ A _ _

 We have to choose letters that are not C, R, N, E.

 We can consider using other common consonants and vowels.

 Since we have eliminated 4 letters (C, R, N, E), we have plenty of options.

 Let's try to think of words that have A in the 3rd position.

 Some examples: 
   ""PLAIT"" -> but we don't know if P, L, I, T are in the word? But we can use them because they are not eliminated.
   ""BLAST"" -> but B, L, S, T are not eliminated, but note that we have A in the 3rd.

 However, we must avoid using the eliminated letters: C, R, N, E.

 Let's list some words with A in the 3rd position and without C, R, N, E:

   ""BALMY"" -> B, A, L, M, Y -> but we don't know about B, L, M, Y.
   ""PALMS"" -> P, A, L, M, S -> again, no C, R, N, E.

 But note: we want to maximize information. We should try to include common letters that we haven't tested yet.

 We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We can try to use a word that has multiple common letters.

 Let's consider ""SLATE"": 
   S, L, A, T, E -> but E is eliminated! We cannot use E.

 So avoid E.

 Another word: ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T -> no eliminated letters? 
   P, L, A, I, T: A is in the 3rd, and we are avoiding C, R, N, E. So this is acceptable.

 But we don't know if the word has P, L, I, T.

 Alternatively, ""BLAST"": B, L, A, S, T -> also acceptable.

 However, note that we have only 6 tries, so we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let's choose a word that has distinct letters and covers common ones.

 I'll go with ""PLAIT"" because it has P, L, I, T which are common.

 But wait, we have to make sure it's a valid word.

 Alternatively, we can use ""STAMP"": S, T, A, M, P -> but A is in the 3rd? 
   S (1st), T (2nd), A (3rd), M (4th), P (5th). Yes.

 But note: we are avoiding E, and STAMP doesn't have E. Also, no C, R, N.

 However, we already know A is in the 3rd, so we can use that.

 But let me check: we have eliminated C, R, N, E. So we can use any other letters.

 Another common word: ""SHALT"" -> but that might be archaic? We should use common words.

 Let's stick with common words.

 I think ""PLAIT"" is a good candidate because it has two vowels (A and I) and three consonants (P, L, T) that we haven't tried.

 But note: we have already eliminated E, so the word might have other vowels? Like O, U, I?

 We can also consider ""OPALE"" but that has E which is eliminated.

 Another word: ""QUAIL"" -> Q, U, A, I, L -> but Q and U are less common? And we have A in the 3rd.

 But we want to test more common letters.

 Let me think of words that have S, T, L, and other common letters.

 ""SLANT"" -> but N is eliminated! We cannot use N.

 So avoid N.

 ""SLATE"" is out because of E.

 ""PLAIT"" seems okay.

 Alternatively, ""BLIMP"": B, L, I, M, P -> but no A? We must have A in the 3rd.

 So we must choose a word that has A in the 3rd.

 Let me list: 
   ""ABACK"" -> but A is in the 1st? We need A in the 3rd.

 So the word must be: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5]

 We can use: 
   ""PLAIT: P L A I T -> positions: 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:I, 5:T
   ""BLAST: B L A S T -> 1:B, 2:L, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T
   ""STAMP: S T A M P -> 1:S, 2:T, 3:A, 4:M, 5:P
   ""SHARD: S H A R D -> but R is eliminated! So we cannot use R.
   ""SHALT: S H A L T -> 1:S, 2:H, 3:A, 4:L, 5:T -> but is it common? Maybe.

 We can also consider ""GLASS"" -> but that has two S's and we don't know about S and G. Also, A is in the 3rd? 
   G L A S S -> 1:G, 2:L, 3:A, 4:S, 5:S -> but we have two S's. It's valid, but we might get less information because of duplicate letters.

 We want to test as many new letters as possible, so distinct letters are better.

 So ""PLAIT"" has distinct letters: P, L, A, I, T -> all distinct.

 Similarly, ""BLAST"" has B, L, A, S, T -> distinct.

 ""STAMP"" has S, T, A, M, P -> distinct.

 I think ""STAMP"" is a good choice because it has S, T, M, P which are very common.

 But note: we already know A is in the 3rd, so we are testing S, T, M, P in positions 1,2,4,5.

 Alternatively, we can use ""PAINT"" -> but N is eliminated and T is at the end? 
   P A I N T -> but we need A in the 3rd? This has A in the 2nd. So not.

 We must have the 3rd letter as A.

 Another word: ""FAULT"" -> F A U L T -> A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd.

 So let's choose between ""PLAIT"" and ""STAMP"".

 I think ""STAMP"" is more common and has more common letters.

 But note: we have eliminated E, so the word might have O, U, I, O? 

 We can also consider ""DAILY"": D A I L Y -> A is in the 2nd? No.

 We need the 3rd to be A.

 Let me think of words: 
   ""BEADY"" -> B E A D Y -> but E is eliminated! So we cannot use E.

   ""HEADY"" -> H E A D Y -> E is eliminated.

   ""LEAVE"" -> has E and also V? But E is eliminated.

 So avoid E.

 Another: ""QUAKE"" -> Q U A K E -> E is eliminated.

 So we avoid E.

 After some thought, I'll go with ""STAMP"".

 But wait, we have to make sure that we are not using any eliminated letters: 
   S, T, A, M, P -> none of C, R, N, E. So it's okay.

 Alternatively, we can use ""SLACK"" -> but C is eliminated? Yes, C is eliminated. So we cannot use C.

 So ""STAMP"" is safe.

 Let me check: 
   S: not tested yet
   T: not tested
   A: we know is in the word and in the 3rd position (so we expect a check for A, but we are testing the position)
   M: not tested
   P: not tested

 This will give us information about S, T, M, P.

 Alternatively, we can use ""PLAIT"" to test P, L, I, T.

 But I think ""STAMP"" is a good choice because S and T are very common at the beginning or the end.

 Since we know A is fixed in the 3rd, we can try to cover the other positions.

 I'll go with ""STAMP"".

 So the next guess: ""STAMP""

 But note: the feedback for A will be ✓ because we know it's in the 3rd. So we are mainly testing the other letters.

 Let me write the guess: STAMP

 However, note that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't know.

 We are hoping to get feedback on S, T, M, P.

 If we get a ✓ for A, then we know it's still in the 3rd (which we already know) and we get feedback on the others.

 So let's go with ""STAMP"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- A is confirmed in the 3rd position (✓).
- C, R, N, E are eliminated (x).

For the next guess:
- Must have A in the 3rd position.
- Avoid using C, R, N, E.
- Prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, M, P, L, I) to maximize information.

I chose **STAMP** because:
- It places A in the 3rd position.
- Tests new common letters: S, T, M, P.
- Avoids eliminated letters (C, R, N, E).
- Uses distinct letters to cover more possibilities.

<guess>stamp</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: stamp -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) M(x) P(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so the secret word has A in the 3rd position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""stamp""
- S: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is still in the 3rd position)
- M: x (not in the word)
- P: x (not in the word)

So, from both guesses, we know:
- The secret word has A in the 3rd position: _ _ A _ _
- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P

We have eliminated 8 letters: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P

We need to form a 5-letter word that has A in the 3rd position and does not contain any of the eliminated letters.

Available letters: We have not tested many letters. The alphabet minus the eliminated ones:
Eliminated: C, E, M, N, P, R, S, T
So available: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: A is already in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice? The feedback doesn't tell us about multiple occurrences. However, since we only have one A in the guesses and it was marked correct, we don't know if there are more A's. But we can assume for now that there is at least one A in the 3rd position.

We need to choose a word that uses only the available letters and has A in the 3rd.

We also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let's think of common words that fit:

Pattern: _ _ A _ _

We can try:

- ""BLANK"": but N is eliminated -> not allowed
- ""FLAKY"": F, L, A, K, Y -> all available? Let's check: F, L, A, K, Y. Yes, none of C,E,M,N,P,R,S,T. So it's valid.
- ""GLAZE"": but Z and E? E is eliminated -> not allowed
- ""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L -> all available? Q, U, A, I, L: yes. But Q and U are less common? But it's a valid word.
- ""JUMBO"": but O? We don't know about O, but the pattern is _ _ A _ _ -> J, U, M, B, O -> M is eliminated? Yes, M is eliminated from guess 2. So not allowed.

We must avoid M.

Another: ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> but A is in the 2nd? We need A in the 3rd. So no.

We need the 3rd to be A.

Let's try ""FAVOR"": F, A, V, O, R -> but A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd.

We need the 3rd letter to be A.

So: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5]

Possible words:

- ""FLAKY"": F L A K Y -> positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:A, 4:K, 5:Y
- ""QUACK"": Q U A C K -> but C is eliminated -> not allowed
- ""QUAFF"": Q U A F F -> but F is available? Yes, but duplicate F? We can use duplicate letters? The rules don't say we can't, but we are trying to maximize information. Also, we don't know if F is in the word. But we are testing Q, U, F, and K? But Q and U are less common.

We can try ""BLAZE"": but Z and E? E is eliminated -> not allowed.

""GLAZE"" has E -> not allowed.

""PHASE"": P is eliminated -> not allowed.

""GRACE"": G, R, A, C, E -> R, C, E are eliminated -> not allowed.

""QUAKE"": Q, U, A, K, E -> E is eliminated -> not allowed.

""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L -> this works: Q, U, A, I, L -> all available? Yes: Q, U, A, I, L -> and A is in the 3rd.

But is ""QUAIL"" a common word? It might be accepted.

Another: ""DWARF"": D, W, A, R, F -> R is eliminated -> not allowed.

""HAZEL"": H, A, Z, E, L -> E eliminated -> not allowed.

""JABOT"": J, A, B, O, T -> A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd.

We need the 3rd to be A.

""BALMY"": B, A, L, M, Y -> A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd.

We need to focus on words with A in the 3rd.

Let me list some:

- ""FLAKY"": F, L, A, K, Y
- ""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L
- ""BLIMP"": B, L, I, M, P -> M and P eliminated -> not allowed
- ""SLING"": S, L, I, N, G -> S and N eliminated -> not allowed
- ""CLAMP"": C, L, A, M, P -> C, M, P eliminated -> not allowed

Another: ""DOZEN"": D, O, Z, E, N -> E and N eliminated -> not allowed

""GAWKY"": G, A, W, K, Y -> A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd.

We need to look for words that have the 3rd letter as A.

Perhaps ""OUIJA"": O, U, I, J, A -> but the 3rd letter is I? Not A.

I think ""FLAKY"" and ""QUAIL"" are options.

But let's think of more:

- ""ABACK"": A, B, A, C, K -> A is in the 1st and 3rd? But we need the 3rd to be A, and the 1st should be A? But in this word, the 1st is A, 2nd is B, 3rd is A, 4th is C, 5th is K. But C is eliminated. So not.

We need the 3rd to be A, and the 1st,2nd,4th,5th to be from the available letters.

Another: ""BIALY"": B, I, A, L, Y -> but A is in the 3rd? 
  Position: 1:B, 2:I, 3:A, 4:L, 5:Y -> yes! And B, I, L, Y are available.

But is ""BIALY"" a common word? It might be obscure.

""KAPUT"": K, A, P, U, T -> A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd. And P and T are eliminated.

""LAUAN"": L, A, U, A, N -> A in 2nd and 4th? Not the 3rd. And N eliminated.

""WAQFS"": W, A, Q, F, S -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. And S eliminated.

""FAUNA"": F, A, U, N, A -> A in 2nd and 5th? Not 3rd. And N eliminated.

""MAUVE"": M, A, U, V, E -> M and E eliminated.

""HAUTE"": H, A, U, T, E -> T and E eliminated.

""RAJAH"": R, A, J, A, H -> R eliminated and A in 2nd and 4th.

I think ""FLAKY"" and ""QUAIL"" are reasonable.

But let's also consider ""BLAND"": B, L, A, N, D -> N eliminated.

""GLAND"": G, L, A, N, D -> N eliminated.

""PLAIT"": P, L, A, I, T -> P and T eliminated.

So without the eliminated letters, we have:

- ""FLAKY"": F, L, A, K, Y
- ""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L
- ""BIALY"": B, I, A, L, Y
- ""DIARY"": D, I, A, R, Y -> R eliminated
- ""FIARY"": not a word? 
- ""LIARD"": not common and R eliminated.

Another: ""GUAVA"": G, U, A, V, A -> A in 3rd? 
  Position: 1:G, 2:U, 3:A, 4:V, 5:A -> yes! And G, U, V, A are available. But we have two A's? That's okay.

But ""GUAVA"" has two A's. We don't know if the secret word has two A's. But it's possible.

Similarly, ""FLAVA""? Not a word.

""VAGUS"": V, A, G, U, S -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. S eliminated.

""DOGMA"": D, O, G, M, A -> M eliminated and A in 5th? Not 3rd.

""ALGAE"": A, L, G, A, E -> E eliminated and A in 1st and 4th? Not 3rd.

""PHASE"": P eliminated.

""CHASE"": C, H, A, S, E -> C, S, E eliminated.

So let's consider ""FLAKY"", ""QUAIL"", and ""GUAVA"".

""GUAVA"" has G, U, V, A, A. We are testing G, U, V, and we already know A is in the 3rd and 5th? But we don't know if there is a 5th A. But we are allowed to use A again? The word must be valid, but we are trying to get information. However, if we use A again, we might get feedback on whether there is a second A.

But we have limited guesses, so we might want to test new letters.

""FLAKY"" tests F, L, K, Y (and A again, but we know A is in the 3rd so the fourth letter is K and fifth Y, and first F).

""QUAIL"" tests Q, U, I, L (and A in 3rd).

""GUAVA"" tests G, U, V, and two A's (so we test G, U, V, and also whether there is an A in the fifth position).

Since we have only 6 guesses, we might avoid repeating A to test more new letters.

But we don't know if the word has another A. However, we can try to avoid repeats to get more information.

So ""FLAKY"" and ""QUAIL"" are better because they have all distinct letters except that A is repeated in ""GUAVA"". But in ""GUAVA"", the A's are in different positions, so we can test if there is a fifth letter.

But let's see the available letters: we have many, so we can choose.

I think ""FLAKY"" is a good choice because it uses common letters F, L, K, Y that we haven't tried.

""QUAIL"" is also good because it tests Q, U, I, L.

But Q and U are less common, so ""FLAKY"" might be better.

Another word: ""WACKY"": W, A, C, K, Y -> C eliminated -> not allowed.

""FLICK"": F, L, I, C, K -> C eliminated.

""BLIMP"": B, L, I, M, P -> M and P eliminated.

""JUICE"": J, U, I, C, E -> C and E eliminated.

""QUITE"": Q, U, I, T, E -> T and E eliminated.

So I think ""FLAKY"" is a solid choice.

But let me check if there are words with more common letters.

What about ""LABOR"": L, A, B, O, R -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. R eliminated.

""LABIA"": L, A, B, I, A -> A in 2nd and 5th? Not 3rd.

""GABON"": not common and N eliminated.

""KAFIR"": K, A, F, I, R -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. R eliminated.

""LAUAN"": not.

Perhaps ""AVAIL"": A, V, A, I, L -> A in 1st and 3rd? But we need the 3rd to be A, and the 1st is A? But we don't know if the word has two A's. However, the 1st letter is A, so if we use A in the 1st, we might get feedback on that.

But ""AVAIL"": A, V, A, I, L -> positions: 1:A, 2:V, 3:A, 4:I, 5:L -> so the 3rd is A. And we are testing V, I, L, and A in the 1st and 5th.

But we already know A is in the 3rd, so we are testing the 1st and 5th as well.

But the word ""AVAIL"" is valid.

However, we have eliminated letters: we are using A, V, I, L. V, I, L are available.

But we are repeating A. We know A is in the 3rd, so if we get a ✓ for A in the 1st or 5th, that would be new information.

But we are trying to find the secret word, so we can use this to test for multiple A's.

But in the feedback, for ""crane"" and ""stamp"", we only had one A and it was correct. If there were two A's, we wouldn't know.

So ""AVAIL"" is a possibility.

But let's compare to ""FLAKY"":

""FLAKY"": tests F, L, K, Y (and A in the 3rd, which we know). We get feedback on F, L, K, Y.

""AVAIL"": tests V, I, L (and A in 1st and 3rd). We get feedback on V, I, L, and also about the first A and the last A.

But ""AVAIL"" uses the letter I, which is a vowel, and we haven't tested I yet.

We haven't tested I, so that might be good.

But ""FLAKY"" tests F, L, K, Y which are also good.

Since we have eliminated many vowels (E, A is known, but A is fixed), we should test other vowels: I, O, U.

In ""AVAIL"", we test I and also O? Not O in this word.

In ""FLAKY"", we test Y which can be a vowel sometimes.

But ""AVAIL"" has two A's, which might be useful if we suspect a double A, but we don't have evidence.

I think ""FLAKY"" is a safer choice because it doesn't repeat A and tests four new letters.

But in ""FLAKY"", the A is only in the 3rd, so we are not testing for additional A's.

We can also consider ""OAKUM"": O, A, K, U, M -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. M eliminated.

""DAHLia"": too long.

5-letter words only.

Another: ""ABYSS"": A in 1st? Not 3rd.

I think ""FLAKY"" is a good choice.

But let me check if there is a word with O or U.

""ALOUD"": A, L, O, U, D -> A in 1st? Not 3rd.

""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O -> A in 1st? Not 3rd.

We need the 3rd to be A.

""PIANO"": P, I, A, N, O -> P and N eliminated.

""RADAR"": R, A, D, A, R -> R eliminated and A in 2nd and 4th.

Not.

""LAUDS"": L, A, U, D, S -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. S eliminated.

""QUADS"": Q, U, A, D, S -> A in 3rd? 
  Position: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:A, 4:D, 5:S -> but S is eliminated. So not.

""QUAFF"": Q, U, A, F, F -> A in 3rd? 
  1:Q, 2:U, 3:A, 4:F, 5:F -> but duplicate F. We can use duplicate letters? The rules don't forbid it, but it might not be efficient.

But we are trying to get information. If we use a word with duplicate letters, we might not know about as many letters.

So I think ""FLAKY"" is better because all letters are distinct.

Another word: ""WACKY"": not allowed because of C.

""FLAKY"" seems good.

But let's see if there is a word with I and O.

""ALGAL"": not common and A in 1st? Not 3rd.

""ATTAR"": A, T, T, A, R -> T and R eliminated.

Not.

""ADIEU"": A, D, I, E, U -> E eliminated and A in 1st? Not 3rd.

I think ""FLAKY"" is a reasonable choice.

But we have to make sure that we are not using any eliminated letters.

Let's list the letters we have eliminated: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P

So for ""FLAKY"": F, L, A, K, Y -> none of these are eliminated. And A is in the 3rd.

Similarly, for ""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L -> none eliminated, A in 3rd.

But ""QUAIL"" has Q and U which are less common. ""FLAKY"" has more common letters: F, L, K, Y.

""FLAKY"" uses F, L, K, Y, which are all fairly common.

We can also consider ""BLUET"": not a word? ""BLUET"" is not standard. ""BLUTE"" has E.

Another word: ""GAWKY"": G, A, W, K, Y -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd.

""JAZZY"": J, A, Z, Z, Y -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd.

I think ""FLAKY"" is a good choice.

But let's try ""HAVOC"": H, A, V, O, C -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. C eliminated.

""KAVAS"": K, A, V, A, S -> A in 2nd and 4th? Not 3rd. S eliminated.

""BAWDY"": B, A, W, D, Y -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd.

""DAFT"": not 5 letters.

I found: ""FLAKY"" is a valid word.

So I'll go with ""FLAKY"".

But note: we are testing F, L, K, Y. If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Alternatively, we can use ""QUAIL"" to test Q, U, I, L.

But I think ""FLAKY"" is more common.

Another option: ""WACKY"" is not allowed.

""FLAKY"" seems good.

But let me check if there is a word with O.

""ALGUM"": not common.

""FLAVY""? Not a word.

""FLAKY"" is the best so far.

We can also consider ""BLAZE"": but E is eliminated.

""GLAZE"": E eliminated.

""BEIGE"": B, E, I, G, E -> E eliminated.

So I think ""FLAKY"" is a solid second guess.

Therefore, I'll guess ""FLAKY"".

But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""FLAKY"" is a valid English word.

So the next guess is ""FLAKY"".

But note: we are not using any eliminated letters.

So let's go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **A is confirmed in the 3rd position** (✓).
- **C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P are eliminated** (x).

For the next guess:
- Must have **A in the 3rd position**.
- Avoid eliminated letters (C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P).
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., F, L, K, Y, Q, U, I, L) to maximize information.

I chose **FLAKY** because:
- It places A in the 3rd position.
- Tests new common letters: F, L, K, Y.
- Uses distinct letters to cover more possibilities.
- Avoids eliminated letters and repeats.

<guess>flaky</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: stamp -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) M(x) P(x)
Guess 3: flaky -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(-) A(✓) K(x) Y(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, 3rd)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""stamp""
- S: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, 3rd)
- M: x (not in the word)
- P: x (not in the word)

Guess 3: ""flaky""
- F: x (not in the word)
- L: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: ✓ (correct position, 3rd)
- K: x (not in the word)
- Y: x (not in the word)

So, from all feedback, we know:

1. The secret word has the letter L in it, but not in the 2nd position (since in ""flaky"", L was in the 2nd and got a '-', meaning it's present but not there).
2. The secret word does not contain: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P, F, K, Y.
3. A is in the 3rd position and is correct.

The eliminated letters are: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P, F, K, Y.

Available letters: A, B, D, G, H, I, J, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (and L is in the word, but we don't know its position yet).

We also know that L is in the word, but not in the 2nd position. So L could be in position 1, 4, or 5.

The pattern is: _ _ A _ _

We need to form a word that has A in the 3rd position, includes L (but not in the 2nd), and uses only the available letters.

Let's list possible words:

- We need to fill positions 1, 2, 4, 5 with letters from: A, B, D, G, H, I, J, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, and we know L must be in one of 1,4,5 (but not 2).

But note: L can be in the word multiple times? The feedback only said L is in the word, but we don't know if it appears once or more. However, since we only have one L in the guesses, we don't know the count.

We must avoid the eliminated letters.

Let's try to think of words that fit the pattern and use the available letters.

Possible words:

- ""BLAND"": but N is eliminated -> not allowed
- ""BLAZE"": E eliminated -> not allowed
- ""BLAST"": S and T eliminated -> not allowed
- ""BLIMP"": M and P eliminated -> not allowed

We need to avoid the eliminated letters.

Another: ""DOULA"": D, O, U, L, A -> but A is in the 5th? Not the 3rd. We need A in the 3rd.

The pattern is: _ _ A _ _

So the 3rd is A, so the word must be: [1] [2] A [4] [5]

We need to choose letters from: A, B, D, G, H, I, J, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, and L must be in one of 1,4,5.

But L cannot be in position 2, which is already covered.

Let's try to find words:

- ""FLAVA""? Not a word.
- ""FLAKY"" we already tried, and K and Y are eliminated.

What about ""GLAZE"": has E -> eliminated.

""QUAFF"": Q, U, A, F, F -> F eliminated, and duplicate F? But F is eliminated.

""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L -> this is a candidate. Letters: Q, U, A, I, L. 
- Q: not tested
- U: not tested
- A: in 3rd (known)
- I: not tested
- L: in the word, but we are using it in the 5th position. We know L is not in the 2nd, but we don't know about the 5th.

In ""QUAIL"", L is in the 5th position. That's allowed because we haven't tested the 5th position for L.

Another word: ""QUAIL"" is valid.

But we have to check if the letters are available: 
- Q: not eliminated -> okay
- U: not eliminated -> okay
- A: known in 3rd -> okay
- I: not tested -> okay
- L: in the word -> okay, and we are testing it in the 5th.

But we are using Q and U, which are less common. However, we have to use the available letters.

Another possibility: ""WAQFS"" -> but S eliminated and A not in 3rd.

""JUMBO"": M eliminated.

""DOULA"": D, O, U, L, A -> pattern: 1:D, 2:O, 3:? -> but we need A in 3rd? This has L in the 4th and A in the 5th? Not 3rd.

We need the 3rd to be A.

""BALDY"": B, A, L, D, Y -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. Y eliminated.

""HALLO"": H, A, L, L, O -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd.

""GAWKY"": G, A, W, K, Y -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. K and Y eliminated.

""JAWAB"": J, A, W, A, B -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd.

""LAUAN"": L, A, U, A, N -> A in 2nd and 4th? Not 3rd. N eliminated.

""OAKUM"": O, A, K, U, M -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. K and M eliminated.

""QUAKE"": Q, U, A, K, E -> E eliminated and K eliminated.

""QUAIL"" seems a good candidate.

Another word: ""VIXEN"": V, I, X, E, N -> E and N eliminated.

""WOVEN"": W, O, V, E, N -> E and N eliminated.

""JUVEN"": not a word.

""QUAFF"" is not common and has F.

""QUAIL"" is a valid word.

Another: ""DOZEN"": D, O, Z, E, N -> E and N eliminated.

""GUANO"": G, U, A, N, O -> N eliminated.

""GUAVA"": G, U, A, V, A -> this has A in the 3rd? 
  Position: 1:G, 2:U, 3:A, 4:V, 5:A -> yes! And G, U, V, A are available. But we have two A's. We know A is in the 3rd, so the 5th is another A? That's possible.

But we are testing G, U, V, and the second A.

But we have to avoid eliminated letters: G, U, V are available, and A is already known.

But we are using A again in the 5th. We know A is in the 3rd, so if we get a ✓ for the 5th A, that would be new information.

But we are also testing G, U, V.

Is ""GUAVA"" common? It is a word.

But we have to consider that we are testing three new letters: G, U, V, and the fifth letter is A again.

We can also consider ""FLAVA"" - not a word.

""QUAIL"" tests Q, U, I, L (and A in 3rd).

""QUAIL"" uses Q and U, which are less common, but I is a common vowel.

Another word: ""BIJOU"": B, I, J, O, U -> but A not in 3rd.

We need A in the 3rd.

""BIALY"": B, I, A, L, Y -> but Y eliminated.

""DIARY"": D, I, A, R, Y -> R and Y eliminated.

""FIEST"": F and E and S eliminated.

""GIANT"": G, I, A, N, T -> N and T eliminated.

""GIANT"" has N and T, which are eliminated.

""HOAGY"": H, O, A, G, Y -> Y eliminated.

""HOBBY"": H, O, B, B, Y -> Y eliminated and duplicate B.

""JUMBO"": M eliminated.

""LABIA"": L, A, B, I, A -> A in 2nd and 5th? Not 3rd.

""LABOR"": L, A, B, O, R -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. R eliminated.

""LACKO"": C and K eliminated.

""LADLE"": L, A, D, L, E -> E eliminated and duplicate L? But L is in the word, but we are using it in the 1st and 4th? Not efficient and E eliminated.

""LARGO"": L, A, R, G, O -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. R eliminated.

""LAUAN"": not.

""OAKUM"": not.

""QUAIL"" seems to be one of the few options.

Another: ""DOULA"": D, O, U, L, A -> pattern: 1:D, 2:O, 3:? -> but the 3rd is L? Not A. We need the 3rd to be A.

""DOULA"" is D-O-U-L-A, so position 3 is L, not A.

We need the 3rd to be A.

""GUANO"": not.

""GUAVA"": G, U, A, V, A -> 1:G, 2:U, 3:A, 4:V, 5:A -> yes, the 3rd is A.

And letters: G, U, V, A, A. 
- G: available
- U: available
- V: available
- A: known in 3rd and also in 5th (so we are testing for a second A)

But we are using two A's. We know A is in the 3rd, so if we get a ✓ for the 5th A, that would be new.

But we are also testing G, U, V.

Is ""GUAVA"" common? Yes.

But we have to compare with ""QUAIL"".

""QUAIL"" uses Q, U, I, L, and A in 3rd and 5th? No, ""QUAIL"" has only one A? 
""QUAIL"": Q-U-A-I-L -> only one A, in the 3rd.

""GUAVA"": G-U-A-V-A -> two A's.

We can also consider ""VAUCH"": not a word.

""QUAIL"" might be better because it has more distinct letters? ""GUAVA"" has two A's, so we are testing fewer new letters.

In ""QUAIL"", we test Q, U, I, L (and A in 3rd, which we know). So we test four new letters: Q, U, I, L.

In ""GUAVA"", we test G, U, V, and the second A, so we test three new letters: G, U, V.

Therefore, ""QUAIL"" tests more new letters.

But Q and U are less common, but we have to use them because they are available.

Another word: ""WAQFS"" -> not.

""JAWAB"": not.

""LAUAN"": not.

""QUAIL"" is a valid option.

But let's see if there is a word with O or I.

""QUOIN"": Q, U, O, I, N -> N eliminated and A not in 3rd.

""QUOTA"": Q, U, O, T, A -> T eliminated and A in 5th? Not 3rd.

""VODKA"": V, O, D, K, A -> K eliminated and A in 5th.

""VOILA"": V, O, I, L, A -> pattern: 1:V, 2:O, 3:I, 4:L, 5:A -> but we need the 3rd to be A, not I. So no.

We need the 3rd to be A.

""BIAS"": not 5 letters.

""QUAIL"" seems the best.

But we have to consider that L is in the word, and in ""QUAIL"" it is in the 5th. We know L is not in the 2nd, but we don't know about the 5th.

Another word: ""DUVET"": D, U, V, E, T -> E and T eliminated.

""JUVEN"": not a word.

""QUAIL"" is a valid word.

But let's check if there is a word with L in the 1st or 4th.

For example, with L in the 1st: ""L_ _ A _ _""

But we need the 3rd to be A, so the word must be: L [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5]

What letters for position 2? It cannot be L (because if L is in the 1st, we don't know if it can be repeated? But we don't know if the word has two L's. However, we haven't tested L in other positions.

But we know L is in the word, but we don't know the position. So we can try to put L in a new position.

In ""flaky"", L was in position 2 and got a '-', so it's not in 2, so we can try position 1, 4, or 5.

In ""QUAIL"", we put L in position 5.

In ""GUAVA"", we put L in position 4? 
""GUAVA"": G-U-A-V-A -> position 4 is V, position 5 is A. So L is not in this word? But we know L must be in the word. ""GUAVA"" does not contain L. So it cannot be the word because L is missing.

We must include L in the guess because we know it's in the word.

So the word must contain L.

Therefore, we cannot use ""GUAVA"" because it doesn't have L.

Similarly, we must use L.

So back to ""QUAIL"": it has L and A in the 3rd.

Another word: ""QUILL"": Q, U, I, L, L -> but duplicate L? And the pattern: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:I, 4:L, 5:L -> but we need the 3rd to be A, not I. So not.

We need the 3rd to be A.

""QUAIL"" is the only common word I can think of that fits: 
- Position 1: Q
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: A (fixed)
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: L

And all letters are available: Q, U, I, L are all in the available set (Q, U, I, L are not eliminated, and A is known).

But Q and U are less common, but it's a valid word.

Another word: ""QUAFF"" is not, because of F and duplicate F? But F is eliminated.

""QUAKE"" is out because of E and K.

""QUART"": Q, U, A, R, T -> R and T eliminated.

""QUART"" has R and T, which are eliminated.

""QUASI"": Q, U, A, S, I -> S eliminated.

""QUASI"" has S, which is eliminated.

""QUOTA"": Q, U, O, T, A -> T eliminated and A in 5th.

Not.

""VODKA"": K eliminated and A in 5th.

I think ""QUAIL"" is the best option.

But let's see if there is a word with O or I.

""ALOUD"": A in 1st? Not 3rd.

""AUDIO"": A in 1st? Not 3rd.

""OBIIT"": not a word.

""QUAIL"" is the word.

But we have to consider that we are using two vowels: U and I. We haven't tested U and I.

We can also consider ""BLUID""? Not a word.

""GLYPH"": G, L, Y, P, H -> Y and P eliminated, and no A.

We need A in the 3rd.

""BLUET"": not a word.

""FLUID"": F eliminated and A not in 3rd.

I think ""QUAIL"" is the only common word that fits.

But let's check: is there a word like ""L_ _ A _ _"" with A in 3rd?

For example, ""LUCRE"": L, U, C, R, E -> C, R, E eliminated.

""LAMAR"": L, A, M, A, R -> M and R eliminated.

""LAPIN"": L, A, P, I, N -> P and N eliminated.

""LARVA"": L, A, R, V, A -> R eliminated.

""LEAVE"": L, E, A, V, E -> E eliminated.

""LIBRA"": L, I, B, R, A -> R eliminated and A in 5th.

Not.

""LIVID"": L, I, V, I, D -> no A.

We need A in the 3rd.

""LAVAS"": L, A, V, A, S -> A in 2nd and 4th? Not 3rd. S eliminated.

""LAVAS"" has S eliminated.

""LAWNS"": L, A, W, N, S -> N and S eliminated.

""LAWns"" has N and S.

""LAWNS"" is not allowed.

""LAWNS"" -> N and S eliminated.

""LAWS"": not 5 letters.

I think we have to go with ""QUAIL"".

But let's see if there is a word with O.

""ALGAL"": A in 1st? Not 3rd.

""ATTAR"": A in 1st? Not 3rd.

""AVAIL"": A in 1st and 3rd? But we need the 3rd to be A, and the 1st is A? But we don't know if the word has two A's. However, in ""AVAIL"", the 3rd is A, so that's good. But the 1st is A, which we know is in the 3rd, so if we use A in the 1st, we might get feedback on whether there is a second A.

But we are avoiding eliminated letters: A, V, A, I, L -> A is known, V, I, L are available.

But we have two A's. The pattern is: A V A I L -> so position 1: A, 2: V, 3: A? No, 3 is A? 
A V A I L -> position 1: A, 2: V, 3: A, 4: I, 5: L -> so the 3rd is A, which is good. But we are using A in the 1st and 3rd. We know the 3rd is A, so the 1st A might be another occurrence.

But we are testing for multiple A's.

However, we have to avoid eliminated letters: A, V, I, L are available? 
- A: we know is in the word, but we are testing if it appears again.
- V: not tested -> okay
- I: not tested -> okay
- L: in the word, testing it in the 5th position.

But we are using two A's, which might be inefficient for information.

Moreover, ""AVAIL"" has A in the 1st, which we don't know about.

But we are testing the 1st position with A.

Alternatively, we can use ""QUAIL"" which has only one A.

I think ""QUAIL"" is better because it tests more new letters.

But let's see the feedback we got for ""flaky"": L is in the word but not in the 2nd. So in ""QUAIL"", we are putting L in the 5th. If L is in the 5th, we might get a ✓ or a '-'.

Similarly, in ""QUAIL"", we are putting U in the 2nd and I in the 4th.

We haven't tested U or I.

In ""AVAIL"", we test V, I, and A in the 1st.

But ""AVAIL"" has A in the 1st, which we don't know about, and we are testing V and I.

But we are repeating A.

I think ""QUAIL"" is a better choice.

But we have to consider that the word might have the 3rd letter as A and the 5th as A? But that would be ""AVAIL"", which has A in the 1st and 3rd.

But we don't know if the word has two A's.

To maximize information, we should avoid repeating known letters? But we know A is in the 3rd, so if we use A in the 1st, we can test if there is a second A.

But we have limited guesses, so we might want to test new letters.

Since we have many available letters, we can choose a word that tests more common letters.

Common letters left: B, D, G, H, I, O, U.

In ""QUAIL"", we test Q, U, I, L.

In ""AVAIL"", we test V, I, and the second A (so effectively three tests: V, I, and the A in 1st).

But ""AVAIL"" has two A's, so we are testing two positions for A? But we know A is in the 3rd, so if we get a ✓ for the first A, that means there is an A in the 1st and 3rd? But the 3rd is already known, so if we get ✓ for the first A, then the word has A in 1st and 3rd.

But we don't know if that's the case.

We can also consider ""QUAIL"" to test more new letters.

But let's see the available letters: we have many, but we need to cover them.

Another word: ""DOULA"" -> D, O, U, L, A -> pattern: 1:D, 2:O, 3:L, 4:U, 5:A -> but we need the 3rd to be A, not L. So not.

""DOULA"" has L in the 3rd? Not A.

I think we have to go with ""QUAIL"" or ""AVAIL"".

But ""AVAIL"" has the advantage of testing if there is an A in the 1st, but ""QUAIL"" tests more new letters.

Since we have only 6 guesses, and we have 3 left, we can try ""QUAIL"".

But let's see if there is a word with O.

""ALGAL"" not.

""ATTAR"" not.

""AVOID"": A in 1st? Not 3rd.

""AVOWS"": A in 1st? Not 3rd.

""BAWDY"": A in 2nd? Not 3rd.

I think ""QUAIL"" is the best.

But let's check the dictionary: ""QUAIL"" is a valid word.

""GUAVA"" is also valid, but has two A's.

But to test more letters, ""QUAIL"" has four new letters: Q, U, I, L.

""GUAVA"" has three: G, U, V, and the second A.

So ""QUAIL"" tests more letters.

Moreover, in ""QUAIL"", we are putting L in the 5th position. We know L is in the word, and we haven't tested the 5th for L.

In ""AVAIL"", we put A in the 1st and 3rd, and L in the 5th.

But we know the 3rd is A, so if we put A in the 1st, we might get feedback on whether there is a second A.

But we are using a known letter A in the 1st, which we don't need to test again? We know A is in the 3rd, so if we put A in the 1st, and if it's not in the word, we get x, which tells us there is no second A. If we get ✓, then there is a second A in the 1st.

But we are using a guess to test that.

Similarly, in ""QUAIL"", we are not testing the 1st position with A.

So both are possible.

But I think ""QUAIL"" is better because it tests four new letters without repeating known letters.

So I'll go with ""QUAIL"".

But let's confirm the pattern: Q-U-A-I-L -> positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:A (known), 4:I, 5:L.

We are testing:
- Q in position 1
- U in position 2
- I in position 4
- L in position 5

And we know A in position 3 is correct.

So we'll get feedback on Q, U, I, L.

If L is in the 5th, we might get a ✓ for L, or a '-' if it's in the word but not 5th.

Similarly for the others.

So I think it's a good guess.

Therefore, the next guess is ""QUAIL"".

But note: we have to make sure that Q and U are not eliminated. They are not in the eliminated list.

Eliminated: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P, F, K, Y.

So Q and U are available.

I think ""QUAIL"" is the word to guess.

But let's see if there is a word with O.

""QUAGO""? Not a word.

""QUAFF"" is not.

""QUAIL"" is the best.

So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **A is confirmed in the 3rd position** (✓).
- **L is in the word but not in the 2nd position** (-).
- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P, F, K, Y (all x).

The secret word pattern is: _ _ A _ _

Available letters: A, B, D, G, H, I, J, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (and L must be included).

Since L is in the word but position unknown (not 2nd), it must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

After evaluating possible words:
- **QUAIL** is a valid option that fits the pattern (_ _ A _ _) and includes L in the 5th position (testing if L is there).
- It tests new common letters: Q, U, I (and L in a new position).
- Avoids all eliminated letters.

We must have A in the 3rd.\n\n So we must choose a word that has A in the 3rd.\n\n Let me list: \n   ""ABACK"" -> but A is in the 1st? We need A in the 3rd.\n\n So the word must be: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5]\n\n We can use: \n   ""PLAIT: P L A I T -> positions: 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:I, 5:T\n   ""BLAST: B L A S T -> 1:B, 2:L, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T\n   ""STAMP: S T A M P -> 1:S, 2:T, 3:A, 4:M, 5:P\n   ""SHARD: S H A R D -> but R is eliminated! So we cannot use R.\n   ""SHALT: S H A L T -> 1:S, 2:H, 3:A, 4:L, 5:T -> but is it common? Maybe.\n\n We can also consider ""GLASS"" -> but that has two S\'s and we don\'t know about S and G. Also, A is in the 3rd? \n   G L A S S -> 1:G, 2:L, 3:A, 4:S, 5:S -> but we have two S\'s. It\'s valid, but we might get less information because of duplicate letters.\n\n We want to test as many new letters as possible, so distinct letters are better.\n\n So ""PLAIT"" has distinct letters: P, L, A, I, T -> all distinct.\n\n Similarly, ""BLAST"" has B, L, A, S, T -> distinct.\n\n ""STAMP"" has S, T, A, M, P -> distinct.\n\n I think ""STAMP"" is a good choice because it has S, T, M, P which are very common.\n\n But note: we already know A is in the 3rd, so we are testing S, T, M, P in positions 1,2,4,5.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""PAINT"" -> but N is eliminated and T is at the end? \n   P A I N T -> but we need A in the 3rd? This has A in the 2nd. So not.\n\n We must have the 3rd letter as A.\n\n Another word: ""FAULT"" -> F A U L T -> A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd.\n\n So let\'s choose between ""PLAIT"" and ""STAMP"".\n\n I think ""STAMP"" is more common and has more common letters.\n\n But note: we have eliminated E, so the word might have O, U, I, O? \n\n We can also consider ""DAILY"": D A I L Y -> A is in the 2nd? No.\n\n We need the 3rd to be A.\n\n Let me think of words: \n   ""BEADY"" -> B E A D Y -> but E is eliminated! So we cannot use E.\n\n   ""HEADY"" -> H E A D Y -> E is eliminated.\n\n   ""LEAVE"" -> has E and also V? But E is eliminated.\n\n So avoid E.\n\n Another: ""QUAKE"" -> Q U A K E -> E is eliminated.\n\n So we avoid E.\n\n After some thought, I\'ll go with ""STAMP"".\n\n But wait, we have to make sure that we are not using any eliminated letters: \n   S, T, A, M, P -> none of C, R, N, E. So it\'s okay.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""SLACK"" -> but C is eliminated? Yes, C is eliminated. So we cannot use C.\n\n So ""STAMP"" is safe.\n\n Let me check: \n   S: not tested yet\n   T: not tested\n   A: we know is in the word and in the 3rd position (so we expect a check for A, but we are testing the position)\n   M: not tested\n   P: not tested\n\n This will give us information about S, T, M, P.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""PLAIT"" to test P, L, I, T.\n\n But I think ""STAMP"" is a good choice because S and T are very common at the beginning or the end.\n\n Since we know A is fixed in the 3rd, we can try to cover the other positions.\n\n I\'ll go with ""STAMP"".\n\n So the next guess: ""STAMP""\n\n But note: the feedback for A will be ✓ because we know it\'s in the 3rd. So we are mainly testing the other letters.\n\n Let me write the guess: STAMP\n\n However, note that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t know.\n\n We are hoping to get feedback on S, T, M, P.\n\n If we get a ✓ for A, then we know it\'s still in the 3rd (which we already know) and we get feedback on the others.\n\n So let\'s go with ""STAMP"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- A is confirmed in the 3rd position (✓).\n- C, R, N, E are eliminated (x).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must have A in the 3rd position.\n- Avoid using C, R, N, E.\n- Prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, M, P, L, I) to maximize information.\n\nI chose **STAMP** because:\n- It places A in the 3rd position.\n- Tests new common letters: S, T, M, P.\n- Avoids eliminated letters (C, R, N, E).\n- Uses distinct letters to cover more possibilities.\n\n<guess>stamp</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: stamp -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) M(x) P(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: ✓ (correct position, so the secret word has A in the 3rd position)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: ""stamp""\n- S: x (not in the word)\n- T: x (not in the word)\n- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is still in the 3rd position)\n- M: x (not in the word)\n- P: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, from both guesses, we know:\n- The secret word has A in the 3rd position: _ _ A _ _\n- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P\n\nWe have eliminated 8 letters: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that has A in the 3rd position and does not contain any of the eliminated letters.\n\nAvailable letters: We have not tested many letters. The alphabet minus the eliminated ones:\nEliminated: C, E, M, N, P, R, S, T\nSo available: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nBut note: A is already in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears twice? The feedback doesn\'t tell us about multiple occurrences. However, since we only have one A in the guesses and it was marked correct, we don\'t know if there are more A\'s. But we can assume for now that there is at least one A in the 3rd position.\n\nWe need to choose a word that uses only the available letters and has A in the 3rd.\n\nWe also want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nLet\'s think of common words that fit:\n\nPattern: _ _ A _ _\n\nWe can try:\n\n- ""BLANK"": but N is eliminated -> not allowed\n- ""FLAKY"": F, L, A, K, Y -> all available? Let\'s check: F, L, A, K, Y. Yes, none of C,E,M,N,P,R,S,T. So it\'s valid.\n- ""GLAZE"": but Z and E? E is eliminated -> not allowed\n- ""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L -> all available? Q, U, A, I, L: yes. But Q and U are less common? But it\'s a valid word.\n- ""JUMBO"": but O? We don\'t know about O, but the pattern is _ _ A _ _ -> J, U, M, B, O -> M is eliminated? Yes, M is eliminated from guess 2. So not allowed.\n\nWe must avoid M.\n\nAnother: ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> but A is in the 2nd? We need A in the 3rd. So no.\n\nWe need the 3rd to be A.\n\nLet\'s try ""FAVOR"": F, A, V, O, R -> but A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd.\n\nWe need the 3rd letter to be A.\n\nSo: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5]\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""FLAKY"": F L A K Y -> positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:A, 4:K, 5:Y\n- ""QUACK"": Q U A C K -> but C is eliminated -> not allowed\n- ""QUAFF"": Q U A F F -> but F is available? Yes, but duplicate F? We can use duplicate letters? The rules don\'t say we can\'t, but we are trying to maximize information. Also, we don\'t know if F is in the word. But we are testing Q, U, F, and K? But Q and U are less common.\n\nWe can try ""BLAZE"": but Z and E? E is eliminated -> not allowed.\n\n""GLAZE"" has E -> not allowed.\n\n""PHASE"": P is eliminated -> not allowed.\n\n""GRACE"": G, R, A, C, E -> R, C, E are eliminated -> not allowed.\n\n""QUAKE"": Q, U, A, K, E -> E is eliminated -> not allowed.\n\n""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L -> this works: Q, U, A, I, L -> all available? Yes: Q, U, A, I, L -> and A is in the 3rd.\n\nBut is ""QUAIL"" a common word? It might be accepted.\n\nAnother: ""DWARF"": D, W, A, R, F -> R is eliminated -> not allowed.\n\n""HAZEL"": H, A, Z, E, L -> E eliminated -> not allowed.\n\n""JABOT"": J, A, B, O, T -> A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd.\n\nWe need the 3rd to be A.\n\n""BALMY"": B, A, L, M, Y -> A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd.\n\nWe need to focus on words with A in the 3rd.\n\nLet me list some:\n\n- ""FLAKY"": F, L, A, K, Y\n- ""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L\n- ""BLIMP"": B, L, I, M, P -> M and P eliminated -> not allowed\n- ""SLING"": S, L, I, N, G -> S and N eliminated -> not allowed\n- ""CLAMP"": C, L, A, M, P -> C, M, P eliminated -> not allowed\n\nAnother: ""DOZEN"": D, O, Z, E, N -> E and N eliminated -> not allowed\n\n""GAWKY"": G, A, W, K, Y -> A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd.\n\nWe need to look for words that have the 3rd letter as A.\n\nPerhaps ""OUIJA"": O, U, I, J, A -> but the 3rd letter is I? Not A.\n\nI think ""FLAKY"" and ""QUAIL"" are options.\n\nBut let\'s think of more:\n\n- ""ABACK"": A, B, A, C, K -> A is in the 1st and 3rd? But we need the 3rd to be A, and the 1st should be A? But in this word, the 1st is A, 2nd is B, 3rd is A, 4th is C, 5th is K. But C is eliminated. So not.\n\nWe need the 3rd to be A, and the 1st,2nd,4th,5th to be from the available letters.\n\nAnother: ""BIALY"": B, I, A, L, Y -> but A is in the 3rd? \n  Position: 1:B, 2:I, 3:A, 4:L, 5:Y -> yes! And B, I, L, Y are available.\n\nBut is ""BIALY"" a common word? It might be obscure.\n\n""KAPUT"": K, A, P, U, T -> A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd. And P and T are eliminated.\n\n""LAUAN"": L, A, U, A, N -> A in 2nd and 4th? Not the 3rd. And N eliminated.\n\n""WAQFS"": W, A, Q, F, S -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. And S eliminated.\n\n""FAUNA"": F, A, U, N, A -> A in 2nd and 5th? Not 3rd. And N eliminated.\n\n""MAUVE"": M, A, U, V, E -> M and E eliminated.\n\n""HAUTE"": H, A, U, T, E -> T and E eliminated.\n\n""RAJAH"": R, A, J, A, H -> R eliminated and A in 2nd and 4th.\n\nI think ""FLAKY"" and ""QUAIL"" are reasonable.\n\nBut let\'s also consider ""BLAND"": B, L, A, N, D -> N eliminated.\n\n""GLAND"": G, L, A, N, D -> N eliminated.\n\n""PLAIT"": P, L, A, I, T -> P and T eliminated.\n\nSo without the eliminated letters, we have:\n\n- ""FLAKY"": F, L, A, K, Y\n- ""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L\n- ""BIALY"": B, I, A, L, Y\n- ""DIARY"": D, I, A, R, Y -> R eliminated\n- ""FIARY"": not a word? \n- ""LIARD"": not common and R eliminated.\n\nAnother: ""GUAVA"": G, U, A, V, A -> A in 3rd? \n  Position: 1:G, 2:U, 3:A, 4:V, 5:A -> yes! And G, U, V, A are available. But we have two A\'s? That\'s okay.\n\nBut ""GUAVA"" has two A\'s. We don\'t know if the secret word has two A\'s. But it\'s possible.\n\nSimilarly, ""FLAVA""? Not a word.\n\n""VAGUS"": V, A, G, U, S -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. S eliminated.\n\n""DOGMA"": D, O, G, M, A -> M eliminated and A in 5th? Not 3rd.\n\n""ALGAE"": A, L, G, A, E -> E eliminated and A in 1st and 4th? Not 3rd.\n\n""PHASE"": P eliminated.\n\n""CHASE"": C, H, A, S, E -> C, S, E eliminated.\n\nSo let\'s consider ""FLAKY"", ""QUAIL"", and ""GUAVA"".\n\n""GUAVA"" has G, U, V, A, A. We are testing G, U, V, and we already know A is in the 3rd and 5th? But we don\'t know if there is a 5th A. But we are allowed to use A again? The word must be valid, but we are trying to get information. However, if we use A again, we might get feedback on whether there is a second A.\n\nBut we have limited guesses, so we might want to test new letters.\n\n""FLAKY"" tests F, L, K, Y (and A again, but we know A is in the 3rd so the fourth letter is K and fifth Y, and first F).\n\n""QUAIL"" tests Q, U, I, L (and A in 3rd).\n\n""GUAVA"" tests G, U, V, and two A\'s (so we test G, U, V, and also whether there is an A in the fifth position).\n\nSince we have only 6 guesses, we might avoid repeating A to test more new letters.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has another A. However, we can try to avoid repeats to get more information.\n\nSo ""FLAKY"" and ""QUAIL"" are better because they have all distinct letters except that A is repeated in ""GUAVA"". But in ""GUAVA"", the A\'s are in different positions, so we can test if there is a fifth letter.\n\nBut let\'s see the available letters: we have many, so we can choose.\n\nI think ""FLAKY"" is a good choice because it uses common letters F, L, K, Y that we haven\'t tried.\n\n""QUAIL"" is also good because it tests Q, U, I, L.\n\nBut Q and U are less common, so ""FLAKY"" might be better.\n\nAnother word: ""WACKY"": W, A, C, K, Y -> C eliminated -> not allowed.\n\n""FLICK"": F, L, I, C, K -> C eliminated.\n\n""BLIMP"": B, L, I, M, P -> M and P eliminated.\n\n""JUICE"": J, U, I, C, E -> C and E eliminated.\n\n""QUITE"": Q, U, I, T, E -> T and E eliminated.\n\nSo I think ""FLAKY"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut let me check if there are words with more common letters.\n\nWhat about ""LABOR"": L, A, B, O, R -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. R eliminated.\n\n""LABIA"": L, A, B, I, A -> A in 2nd and 5th? Not 3rd.\n\n""GABON"": not common and N eliminated.\n\n""KAFIR"": K, A, F, I, R -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. R eliminated.\n\n""LAUAN"": not.\n\nPerhaps ""AVAIL"": A, V, A, I, L -> A in 1st and 3rd? But we need the 3rd to be A, and the 1st is A? But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. However, the 1st letter is A, so if we use A in the 1st, we might get feedback on that.\n\nBut ""AVAIL"": A, V, A, I, L -> positions: 1:A, 2:V, 3:A, 4:I, 5:L -> so the 3rd is A. And we are testing V, I, L, and A in the 1st and 5th.\n\nBut we already know A is in the 3rd, so we are testing the 1st and 5th as well.\n\nBut the word ""AVAIL"" is valid.\n\nHowever, we have eliminated letters: we are using A, V, I, L. V, I, L are available.\n\nBut we are repeating A. We know A is in the 3rd, so if we get a ✓ for A in the 1st or 5th, that would be new information.\n\nBut we are trying to find the secret word, so we can use this to test for multiple A\'s.\n\nBut in the feedback, for ""crane"" and ""stamp"", we only had one A and it was correct. If there were two A\'s, we wouldn\'t know.\n\nSo ""AVAIL"" is a possibility.\n\nBut let\'s compare to ""FLAKY"":\n\n""FLAKY"": tests F, L, K, Y (and A in the 3rd, which we know). We get feedback on F, L, K, Y.\n\n""AVAIL"": tests V, I, L (and A in 1st and 3rd). We get feedback on V, I, L, and also about the first A and the last A.\n\nBut ""AVAIL"" uses the letter I, which is a vowel, and we haven\'t tested I yet.\n\nWe haven\'t tested I, so that might be good.\n\nBut ""FLAKY"" tests F, L, K, Y which are also good.\n\nSince we have eliminated many vowels (E, A is known, but A is fixed), we should test other vowels: I, O, U.\n\nIn ""AVAIL"", we test I and also O? Not O in this word.\n\nIn ""FLAKY"", we test Y which can be a vowel sometimes.\n\nBut ""AVAIL"" has two A\'s, which might be useful if we suspect a double A, but we don\'t have evidence.\n\nI think ""FLAKY"" is a safer choice because it doesn\'t repeat A and tests four new letters.\n\nBut in ""FLAKY"", the A is only in the 3rd, so we are not testing for additional A\'s.\n\nWe can also consider ""OAKUM"": O, A, K, U, M -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. M eliminated.\n\n""DAHLia"": too long.\n\n5-letter words only.\n\nAnother: ""ABYSS"": A in 1st? Not 3rd.\n\nI think ""FLAKY"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me check if there is a word with O or U.\n\n""ALOUD"": A, L, O, U, D -> A in 1st? Not 3rd.\n\n""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O -> A in 1st? Not 3rd.\n\nWe need the 3rd to be A.\n\n""PIANO"": P, I, A, N, O -> P and N eliminated.\n\n""RADAR"": R, A, D, A, R -> R eliminated and A in 2nd and 4th.\n\nNot.\n\n""LAUDS"": L, A, U, D, S -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. S eliminated.\n\n""QUADS"": Q, U, A, D, S -> A in 3rd? \n  Position: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:A, 4:D, 5:S -> but S is eliminated. So not.\n\n""QUAFF"": Q, U, A, F, F -> A in 3rd? \n  1:Q, 2:U, 3:A, 4:F, 5:F -> but duplicate F. We can use duplicate letters? The rules don\'t forbid it, but it might not be efficient.\n\nBut we are trying to get information. If we use a word with duplicate letters, we might not know about as many letters.\n\nSo I think ""FLAKY"" is better because all letters are distinct.\n\nAnother word: ""WACKY"": not allowed because of C.\n\n""FLAKY"" seems good.\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word with I and O.\n\n""ALGAL"": not common and A in 1st? Not 3rd.\n\n""ATTAR"": A, T, T, A, R -> T and R eliminated.\n\nNot.\n\n""ADIEU"": A, D, I, E, U -> E eliminated and A in 1st? Not 3rd.\n\nI think ""FLAKY"" is a reasonable choice.\n\nBut we have to make sure that we are not using any eliminated letters.\n\nLet\'s list the letters we have eliminated: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P\n\nSo for ""FLAKY"": F, L, A, K, Y -> none of these are eliminated. And A is in the 3rd.\n\nSimilarly, for ""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L -> none eliminated, A in 3rd.\n\nBut ""QUAIL"" has Q and U which are less common. ""FLAKY"" has more common letters: F, L, K, Y.\n\n""FLAKY"" uses F, L, K, Y, which are all fairly common.\n\nWe can also consider ""BLUET"": not a word? ""BLUET"" is not standard. ""BLUTE"" has E.\n\nAnother word: ""GAWKY"": G, A, W, K, Y -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd.\n\n""JAZZY"": J, A, Z, Z, Y -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd.\n\nI think ""FLAKY"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let\'s try ""HAVOC"": H, A, V, O, C -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. C eliminated.\n\n""KAVAS"": K, A, V, A, S -> A in 2nd and 4th? Not 3rd. S eliminated.\n\n""BAWDY"": B, A, W, D, Y -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd.\n\n""DAFT"": not 5 letters.\n\nI found: ""FLAKY"" is a valid word.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""FLAKY"".\n\nBut note: we are testing F, L, K, Y. If we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""QUAIL"" to test Q, U, I, L.\n\nBut I think ""FLAKY"" is more common.\n\nAnother option: ""WACKY"" is not allowed.\n\n""FLAKY"" seems good.\n\nBut let me check if there is a word with O.\n\n""ALGUM"": not common.\n\n""FLAVY""? Not a word.\n\n""FLAKY"" is the best so far.\n\nWe can also consider ""BLAZE"": but E is eliminated.\n\n""GLAZE"": E eliminated.\n\n""BEIGE"": B, E, I, G, E -> E eliminated.\n\nSo I think ""FLAKY"" is a solid second guess.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll guess ""FLAKY"".\n\nBut wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""FLAKY"" is a valid English word.\n\nSo the next guess is ""FLAKY"".\n\nBut note: we are not using any eliminated letters.\n\nSo let\'s go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **A is confirmed in the 3rd position** (✓).\n- **C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P are eliminated** (x).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must have **A in the 3rd position**.\n- Avoid eliminated letters (C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P).\n- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., F, L, K, Y, Q, U, I, L) to maximize information.\n\nI chose **FLAKY** because:\n- It places A in the 3rd position.\n- Tests new common letters: F, L, K, Y.\n- Uses distinct letters to cover more possibilities.\n- Avoids eliminated letters and repeats.\n\n<guess>flaky</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: stamp -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) M(x) P(x)\nGuess 3: flaky -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(-) A(✓) K(x) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: ✓ (correct position, 3rd)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: ""stamp""\n- S: x (not in the word)\n- T: x (not in the word)\n- A: ✓ (correct position, 3rd)\n- M: x (not in the word)\n- P: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 3: ""flaky""\n- F: x (not in the word)\n- L: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- A: ✓ (correct position, 3rd)\n- K: x (not in the word)\n- Y: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, from all feedback, we know:\n\n1. The secret word has the letter L in it, but not in the 2nd position (since in ""flaky"", L was in the 2nd and got a \'-\', meaning it\'s present but not there).\n2. The secret word does not contain: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P, F, K, Y.\n3. A is in the 3rd position and is correct.\n\nThe eliminated letters are: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P, F, K, Y.\n\nAvailable letters: A, B, D, G, H, I, J, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (and L is in the word, but we don\'t know its position yet).\n\nWe also know that L is in the word, but not in the 2nd position. So L could be in position 1, 4, or 5.\n\nThe pattern is: _ _ A _ _\n\nWe need to form a word that has A in the 3rd position, includes L (but not in the 2nd), and uses only the available letters.\n\nLet\'s list possible words:\n\n- We need to fill positions 1, 2, 4, 5 with letters from: A, B, D, G, H, I, J, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, and we know L must be in one of 1,4,5 (but not 2).\n\nBut note: L can be in the word multiple times? The feedback only said L is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears once or more. However, since we only have one L in the guesses, we don\'t know the count.\n\nWe must avoid the eliminated letters.\n\nLet\'s try to think of words that fit the pattern and use the available letters.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""BLAND"": but N is eliminated -> not allowed\n- ""BLAZE"": E eliminated -> not allowed\n- ""BLAST"": S and T eliminated -> not allowed\n- ""BLIMP"": M and P eliminated -> not allowed\n\nWe need to avoid the eliminated letters.\n\nAnother: ""DOULA"": D, O, U, L, A -> but A is in the 5th? Not the 3rd. We need A in the 3rd.\n\nThe pattern is: _ _ A _ _\n\nSo the 3rd is A, so the word must be: [1] [2] A [4] [5]\n\nWe need to choose letters from: A, B, D, G, H, I, J, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, and L must be in one of 1,4,5.\n\nBut L cannot be in position 2, which is already covered.\n\nLet\'s try to find words:\n\n- ""FLAVA""? Not a word.\n- ""FLAKY"" we already tried, and K and Y are eliminated.\n\nWhat about ""GLAZE"": has E -> eliminated.\n\n""QUAFF"": Q, U, A, F, F -> F eliminated, and duplicate F? But F is eliminated.\n\n""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L -> this is a candidate.

We know L is not in the 2nd, but we don\'t know about the 5th.\n\nIn ""QUAIL"", L is in the 5th position. That\'s allowed because we haven\'t tested the 5th position for L.\n\nAnother word: ""QUAIL"" is valid.\n\nBut we have to check if the letters are available: \n- Q: not eliminated -> okay\n- U: not eliminated -> okay\n- A: known in 3rd -> okay\n- I: not tested -> okay\n- L: in the word -> okay, and we are testing it in the 5th.\n\nBut we are using Q and U, which are less common. However, we have to use the available letters.\n\nAnother possibility: ""WAQFS"" -> but S eliminated and A not in 3rd.\n\n""JUMBO"": M eliminated.\n\n""DOULA"": D, O, U, L, A -> pattern: 1:D, 2:O, 3:? -> but we need A in 3rd?

""GUAVA"" has two A\'s, so we are testing fewer new letters.\n\nIn ""QUAIL"", we test Q, U, I, L (and A in 3rd, which we know). So we test four new letters: Q, U, I, L.\n\nIn ""GUAVA"", we test G, U, V, and the second A, so we test three new letters: G, U, V.\n\nTherefore, ""QUAIL"" tests more new letters.\n\nBut Q and U are less common, but we have to use them because they are available.\n\nAnother word: ""WAQFS"" -> not.\n\n""JAWAB"": not.\n\n""LAUAN"": not.\n\n""QUAIL"" is a valid option.\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word with O or I.\n\n""QUOIN"": Q, U, O, I, N -> N eliminated and A not in 3rd.\n\n""QUOTA"": Q, U, O, T, A -> T eliminated and A in 5th?

We know L is not in the 2nd, but we don\'t know about the 5th.\n\nAnother word: ""DUVET"": D, U, V, E, T -> E and T eliminated.\n\n""JUVEN"": not a word.\n\n""QUAIL"" is a valid word.\n\nBut let\'s check if there is a word with L in the 1st or 4th.\n\nFor example, with L in the 1st: ""L_ _ A _ _""\n\nBut we need the 3rd to be A, so the word must be: L [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5]\n\nWhat letters for position 2? It cannot be L (because if L is in the 1st, we don\'t know if it can be repeated? But we don\'t know if the word has two L\'s. However, we haven\'t tested L in other positions.\n\nBut we know L is in the word, but we don\'t know the position. So we can try to put L in a new position.\n\nIn ""flaky"", L was in position 2 and got a \'-\', so it\'s not in 2, so we can try position 1, 4, or 5.\n\nIn ""QUAIL"", we put L in position 5.\n\nIn ""GUAVA"", we put L in position 4? \n""GUAVA"": G-U-A-V-A -> position 4 is V, position 5 is A. So L is not in this word? But we know L must be in the word. ""GUAVA"" does not contain L. So it cannot be the word because L is missing.\n\nWe must include L in the guess because we know it\'s in the word.\n\nSo the word must contain L.\n\nTherefore, we cannot use ""GUAVA"" because it doesn\'t have L.\n\nSimilarly, we must use L.\n\nSo back to ""QUAIL"": it has L and A in the 3rd.\n\nAnother word: ""QUILL"": Q, U, I, L, L -> but duplicate L? And the pattern: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:I, 4:L, 5:L -> but we need the 3rd to be A, not I.

Not 3rd.\n\n""ATTAR"": A in 1st? Not 3rd.\n\n""AVAIL"": A in 1st and 3rd? But we need the 3rd to be A, and the 1st is A? But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. However, in ""AVAIL"", the 3rd is A, so that\'s good. But the 1st is A, which we know is in the 3rd, so if we use A in the 1st, we might get feedback on whether there is a second A.\n\nBut we are avoiding eliminated letters: A, V, A, I, L -> A is known, V, I, L are available.\n\nBut we have two A\'s. The pattern is: A V A I L -> so position 1: A, 2: V, 3: A? No, 3 is A? \nA V A I L -> position 1: A, 2: V, 3: A, 4: I, 5: L -> so the 3rd is A, which is good. But we are using A in the 1st and 3rd. We know the 3rd is A, so the 1st A might be another occurrence.\n\nBut we are testing for multiple A\'s.\n\nHowever, we have to avoid eliminated letters: A, V, I, L are available? \n- A: we know is in the word, but we are testing if it appears again.\n- V: not tested -> okay\n- I: not tested -> okay\n- L: in the word, testing it in the 5th position.\n\nBut we are using two A\'s, which might be inefficient for information.\n\nMoreover, ""AVAIL"" has A in the 1st, which we don\'t know about.\n\nBut we are testing the 1st position with A.\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""QUAIL"" which has only one A.\n\nI think ""QUAIL"" is better because it tests more new letters.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we got for ""flaky"": L is in the word but not in the 2nd. So in ""QUAIL"", we are putting L in the 5th. If L is in the 5th, we might get a ✓ or a \'-\'.\n\nSimilarly, in ""QUAIL"", we are putting U in the 2nd and I in the 4th.\n\nWe haven\'t tested U or I.\n\nIn ""AVAIL"", we test V, I, and A in the 1st.\n\nBut ""AVAIL"" has A in the 1st, which we don\'t know about, and we are testing V and I.\n\nBut we are repeating A.\n\nI think ""QUAIL"" is a better choice.\n\nBut we have to consider that the word might have the 3rd letter as A and the 5th as A? But that would be ""AVAIL"", which has A in the 1st and 3rd.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s.\n\nTo maximize information, we should avoid repeating known letters? But we know A is in the 3rd, so if we use A in the 1st, we can test if there is a second A.\n\nBut we have limited guesses, so we might want to test new letters.\n\nSince we have many available letters, we can choose a word that tests more common letters.\n\nCommon letters left: B, D, G, H, I, O, U.\n\nIn ""QUAIL"", we test Q, U, I, L.\n\nIn ""AVAIL"", we test V, I, and the second A (so effectively three tests: V, I, and the A in 1st).\n\nBut ""AVAIL"" has two A\'s, so we are testing two positions for A? But we know A is in the 3rd, so if we get a ✓ for the first A, that means there is an A in the 1st and 3rd? But the 3rd is already known, so if we get ✓ for the first A, then the word has A in 1st and 3rd.\n\nBut we don\'t know if that\'s the case.\n\nWe can also consider ""QUAIL"" to test more new letters.\n\nBut let\'s see the available letters: we have many, but we need to cover them.\n\nAnother word: ""DOULA"" -> D, O, U, L, A -> pattern: 1:D, 2:O, 3:L, 4:U, 5:A -> but we need the 3rd to be A, not L. So not.\n\n""DOULA"" has L in the 3rd? Not A.\n\nI think we have to go with ""QUAIL"" or ""AVAIL"".\n\nBut ""AVAIL"" has the advantage of testing if there is an A in the 1st, but ""QUAIL"" tests more new letters.\n\nSince we have only 6 guesses, and we have 3 left, we can try ""QUAIL"".\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word with O.\n\n""ALGAL"" not.\n\n""ATTAR"" not.\n\n""AVOID"": A in 1st? Not 3rd.\n\n""AVOWS"": A in 1st? Not 3rd.\n\n""BAWDY"": A in 2nd? Not 3rd.\n\nI think ""QUAIL"" is the best.\n\nBut let\'s check the dictionary: ""QUAIL"" is a valid word.\n\n""GUAVA"" is also valid, but has two A\'s.\n\nBut to test more letters, ""QUAIL"" has four new letters: Q, U, I, L.\n\n""GUAVA"" has three: G, U, V, and the second A.\n\nSo ""QUAIL"" tests more letters.\n\nMoreover, in ""QUAIL"", we are putting L in the 5th position. We know L is in the word, and we haven\'t tested the 5th for L.\n\nIn ""AVAIL"", we put A in the 1st and 3rd, and L in the 5th.\n\nBut we know the 3rd is A, so if we put A in the 1st, we might get feedback on whether there is a second A.\n\nBut we are using a known letter A in the 1st, which we don\'t need to test again? We know A is in the 3rd, so if we put A in the 1st, and if it\'s not in the word, we get x, which tells us there is no second A. If we get ✓, then there is a second A in the 1st.\n\nBut we are using a guess to test that.\n\nSimilarly, in ""QUAIL"", we are not testing the 1st position with A.\n\nSo both are possible.\n\nBut I think ""QUAIL"" is better because it tests four new letters without repeating known letters.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""QUAIL"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the pattern: Q-U-A-I-L -> positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:A (known), 4:I, 5:L.\n\nWe are testing:\n- Q in position 1\n- U in position 2\n- I in position 4\n- L in position 5\n\nAnd we know A in position 3 is correct.\n\nSo we\'ll get feedback on Q, U, I, L.\n\nIf L is in the 5th, we might get a ✓ for L, or a \'-\' if it\'s in the word but not 5th.\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nSo I think it\'s a good guess.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""QUAIL"".\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that Q and U are not eliminated. They are not in the eliminated list.\n\nEliminated: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P, F, K, Y.\n\nSo Q and U are available.\n\nI think ""QUAIL"" is the word to guess.\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word with O.\n\n""QUAGO""? Not a word.\n\n""QUAFF"" is not.\n\n""QUAIL"" is the best.\n\nSo I\'ll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **A is confirmed in the 3rd position** (✓).\n- **L is in the word but not in the 2nd position** (-).\n- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P, F, K, Y (all x).\n\nThe secret word pattern is: _ _ A _ _\n\nAvailable letters: A, B, D, G, H, I, J, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (and L must be included).\n\nSince L is in the word but position unknown (not 2nd), it must be in position 1, 4, or 5.\n\nAfter evaluating possible words:\n- **QUAIL** is a valid option that fits the pattern (_ _ A _ _) and includes L in the 5th position (testing if L is there).\n- It tests new common letters: Q, U, I (and L in a new position).\n- Avoids all eliminated letters.\n\n<guess>quail</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: stamp -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) M(x) P(x)\nGuess 3: flaky -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(-) A(✓) K(x) Y(x)\nGuess 4: quail -> FEEDBACK: Q(x) U(x) A(✓) I(x) L(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(x)
  - So A is in the word and in the correct position (3rd), and C, R, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""stamp"" -> S(x), T(x), A(✓), M(x), P(x)
  - A is still in the 3rd position. S, T, M, P are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""flaky"" -> F(x), L(-), A(✓), K(x), Y(x)
  - L is in the word but not in the 2nd position. F, K, Y are not in the word.

Guess 4: ""quail"" -> Q(x), U(x), A(✓), I(x), L(-)
  - A is still in the 3rd position. Q, U, I are not in the word. L is in the word but not in the 5th position.

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. The secret word has the pattern: _ _ A _ _
   - The 3rd letter is A.

2. Letters in the word:
   - A (in position 3)
   - L (in the word, but not in position 2 or 5)

3. Eliminated letters (not in the word): 
   C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P, F, K, Y, Q, U, I

   So eliminated: C, E, F, I, K, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, U, Y

   Available letters: A, B, D, G, H, L, O, V, W, X, Z (and we know A and L are in the word)

4. L is in the word, but not in position 2 or 5. Since the word has only 5 positions, L must be in position 1 or 4.

   So the word can be:
   - L _ A _ _  (if L is in position 1)
   - _ L A _ _  (but L cannot be in position 2, so this is impossible)
   - _ _ A L _  (if L is in position 4)

   And we know the word has exactly these letters: A (3rd), L (either 1 or 4), and two more letters from the available set.

5. We have tested many letters and found them all absent except A and L.

   So the word must be made of the available letters: A, B, D, G, H, L, O, V, W, X, Z.

   And we know L is in position 1 or 4.

Now, we need to form a 5-letter word that fits the pattern and uses only available letters.

Let's consider the two cases:

Case 1: L in position 1 -> word: L _ A _ _
   - The second position must be filled with a letter from the available set (not L, because if L is in position 1, we don't know if it can be in the second? But we haven't tested L in the second, so it could be, but we know L is in the word, so if we put L in the second, it might be a duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, we haven't seen any duplicate feedback, but it's possible.

   But note: in ""flaky"", L was in position 2 and got a '-', meaning there is an L but not in position 2. So L could be in position 1 or 4.

   If we put L in position 1, then the word is L _ A _ _

   We need to fill position 2, 4, and 5 with available letters, avoiding eliminated ones.

   Available for position 2: B, D, G, H, O, V, W, X, Z (and L? But L is in position 1, so position 2 cannot be L because we already have L in position 1? But if the word has two L's, it could be, but we don't know. However, we haven't had any indication of duplicate letters, so we should consider the possibility.

   But to be safe, we can avoid using L again? Or we can use it to test for duplicates.

   However, we are trying to guess the word, so we can try to cover as many new letters as possible.

   For case 1 (L in 1st): 
      L [position2] A [position4] [position5]

   We need to choose position2, position4, position5 from: B, D, G, H, O, V, W, X, Z (and if we allow duplicates, L? but we don't know if L is duplicated).

   But we have not tested position2, so we can put a new letter there.

   Similarly, position4 and position5.

   We can try a word like ""LAWDS"" -> not a word.

   ""LAVAS"" -> S eliminated.

   ""LAVAS"" has S.

   ""LAWNS"" -> N and S eliminated.

   ""LAWNS"" not allowed.

   ""LAWDS"" not a word.

   ""LAWNY"" -> N and Y eliminated.

   ""LAWNY"" not allowed.

   ""LAWNS"" not.

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 04 Sep 2025

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: ✓ (correct position, so the secret word has A in the 3rd position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word has the letter A in the 3rd position.
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

 Since R and E are not in the word, and we know the word has A in the 3rd position, we can try to form a new word.

 We must avoid using C, R, N, E.

 Let's think of common 5-letter words that have A in the 3rd position.

 The pattern is: _ _ A _ _

 We have to choose letters that are not C, R, N, E.

 We can consider using other common consonants and vowels.

 Since we have eliminated 4 letters (C, R, N, E), we have plenty of options.

 Let's try to think of words that have A in the 3rd position.

 Some examples: 
   ""PLAIT"" -> but we don't know if P, L, I, T are in the word? But we can use them because they are not eliminated.
   ""BLAST"" -> but B, L, S, T are not eliminated, but note that we have A in the 3rd.

 However, we must avoid using the eliminated letters: C, R, N, E.

 Let's list some words with A in the 3rd position and without C, R, N, E:

   ""BALMY"" -> B, A, L, M, Y -> but we don't know about B, L, M, Y.
   ""PALMS"" -> P, A, L, M, S -> again, no C, R, N, E.

 But note: we want to maximize information. We should try to include common letters that we haven't tested yet.

 We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We can try to use a word that has multiple common letters.

 Let's consider ""SLATE"": 
   S, L, A, T, E -> but E is eliminated! We cannot use E.

 So avoid E.

 Another word: ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T -> no eliminated letters? 
   P, L, A, I, T: A is in the 3rd, and we are avoiding C, R, N, E. So this is acceptable.

 But we don't know if the word has P, L, I, T.

 Alternatively, ""BLAST"": B, L, A, S, T -> also acceptable.

 However, note that we have only 6 tries, so we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let's choose a word that has distinct letters and covers common ones.

 I'll go with ""PLAIT"" because it has P, L, I, T which are common.

 But wait, we have to make sure it's a valid word.

 Alternatively, we can use ""STAMP"": S, T, A, M, P -> but A is in the 3rd? 
   S (1st), T (2nd), A (3rd), M (4th), P (5th). Yes.

 But note: we are avoiding E, and STAMP doesn't have E. Also, no C, R, N.

 However, we already know A is in the 3rd, so we can use that.

 But let me check: we have eliminated C, R, N, E. So we can use any other letters.

 Another common word: ""SHALT"" -> but that might be archaic? We should use common words.

 Let's stick with common words.

 I think ""PLAIT"" is a good candidate because it has two vowels (A and I) and three consonants (P, L, T) that we haven't tried.

 But note: we have already eliminated E, so the word might have other vowels? Like O, U, I?

 We can also consider ""OPALE"" but that has E which is eliminated.

 Another word: ""QUAIL"" -> Q, U, A, I, L -> but Q and U are less common? And we have A in the 3rd.

 But we want to test more common letters.

 Let me think of words that have S, T, L, and other common letters.

 ""SLANT"" -> but N is eliminated! We cannot use N.

 So avoid N.

 ""SLATE"" is out because of E.

 ""PLAIT"" seems okay.

 Alternatively, ""BLIMP"": B, L, I, M, P -> but no A? We must have A in the 3rd.

 So we must choose a word that has A in the 3rd.

 Let me list: 
   ""ABACK"" -> but A is in the 1st? We need A in the 3rd.

 So the word must be: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5]

 We can use: 
   ""PLAIT: P L A I T -> positions: 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:I, 5:T
   ""BLAST: B L A S T -> 1:B, 2:L, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T
   ""STAMP: S T A M P -> 1:S, 2:T, 3:A, 4:M, 5:P
   ""SHARD: S H A R D -> but R is eliminated! So we cannot use R.
   ""SHALT: S H A L T -> 1:S, 2:H, 3:A, 4:L, 5:T -> but is it common? Maybe.

 We can also consider ""GLASS"" -> but that has two S's and we don't know about S and G. Also, A is in the 3rd? 
   G L A S S -> 1:G, 2:L, 3:A, 4:S, 5:S -> but we have two S's. It's valid, but we might get less information because of duplicate letters.

 We want to test as many new letters as possible, so distinct letters are better.

 So ""PLAIT"" has distinct letters: P, L, A, I, T -> all distinct.

 Similarly, ""BLAST"" has B, L, A, S, T -> distinct.

 ""STAMP"" has S, T, A, M, P -> distinct.

 I think ""STAMP"" is a good choice because it has S, T, M, P which are very common.

 But note: we already know A is in the 3rd, so we are testing S, T, M, P in positions 1,2,4,5.

 Alternatively, we can use ""PAINT"" -> but N is eliminated and T is at the end? 
   P A I N T -> but we need A in the 3rd? This has A in the 2nd. So not.

 We must have the 3rd letter as A.

 Another word: ""FAULT"" -> F A U L T -> A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd.

 So let's choose between ""PLAIT"" and ""STAMP"".

 I think ""STAMP"" is more common and has more common letters.

 But note: we have eliminated E, so the word might have O, U, I, O? 

 We can also consider ""DAILY"": D A I L Y -> A is in the 2nd? No.

 We need the 3rd to be A.

 Let me think of words: 
   ""BEADY"" -> B E A D Y -> but E is eliminated! So we cannot use E.

   ""HEADY"" -> H E A D Y -> E is eliminated.

   ""LEAVE"" -> has E and also V? But E is eliminated.

 So avoid E.

 Another: ""QUAKE"" -> Q U A K E -> E is eliminated.

 So we avoid E.

 After some thought, I'll go with ""STAMP"".

 But wait, we have to make sure that we are not using any eliminated letters: 
   S, T, A, M, P -> none of C, R, N, E. So it's okay.

 Alternatively, we can use ""SLACK"" -> but C is eliminated? Yes, C is eliminated. So we cannot use C.

 So ""STAMP"" is safe.

 Let me check: 
   S: not tested yet
   T: not tested
   A: we know is in the word and in the 3rd position (so we expect a check for A, but we are testing the position)
   M: not tested
   P: not tested

 This will give us information about S, T, M, P.

 Alternatively, we can use ""PLAIT"" to test P, L, I, T.

 But I think ""STAMP"" is a good choice because S and T are very common at the beginning or the end.

 Since we know A is fixed in the 3rd, we can try to cover the other positions.

 I'll go with ""STAMP"".

 So the next guess: ""STAMP""

 But note: the feedback for A will be ✓ because we know it's in the 3rd. So we are mainly testing the other letters.

 Let me write the guess: STAMP

 However, note that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't know.

 We are hoping to get feedback on S, T, M, P.

 If we get a ✓ for A, then we know it's still in the 3rd (which we already know) and we get feedback on the others.

 So let's go with ""STAMP"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- A is confirmed in the 3rd position (✓).
- C, R, N, E are eliminated (x).

For the next guess:
- Must have A in the 3rd position.
- Avoid using C, R, N, E.
- Prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, M, P, L, I) to maximize information.

I chose **STAMP** because:
- It places A in the 3rd position.
- Tests new common letters: S, T, M, P.
- Avoids eliminated letters (C, R, N, E).
- Uses distinct letters to cover more possibilities.

<guess>stamp</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: stamp -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) M(x) P(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so the secret word has A in the 3rd position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""stamp""
- S: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is still in the 3rd position)
- M: x (not in the word)
- P: x (not in the word)

So, from both guesses, we know:
- The secret word has A in the 3rd position: _ _ A _ _
- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P

We have eliminated 8 letters: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P

We need to form a 5-letter word that has A in the 3rd position and does not contain any of the eliminated letters.

Available letters: We have not tested many letters. The alphabet minus the eliminated ones:
Eliminated: C, E, M, N, P, R, S, T
So available: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: A is already in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice? The feedback doesn't tell us about multiple occurrences. However, since we only have one A in the guesses and it was marked correct, we don't know if there are more A's. But we can assume for now that there is at least one A in the 3rd position.

We need to choose a word that uses only the available letters and has A in the 3rd.

We also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let's think of common words that fit:

Pattern: _ _ A _ _

We can try:

- ""BLANK"": but N is eliminated -> not allowed
- ""FLAKY"": F, L, A, K, Y -> all available? Let's check: F, L, A, K, Y. Yes, none of C,E,M,N,P,R,S,T. So it's valid.
- ""GLAZE"": but Z and E? E is eliminated -> not allowed
- ""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L -> all available? Q, U, A, I, L: yes. But Q and U are less common? But it's a valid word.
- ""JUMBO"": but O? We don't know about O, but the pattern is _ _ A _ _ -> J, U, M, B, O -> M is eliminated? Yes, M is eliminated from guess 2. So not allowed.

We must avoid M.

Another: ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> but A is in the 2nd? We need A in the 3rd. So no.

We need the 3rd to be A.

Let's try ""FAVOR"": F, A, V, O, R -> but A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd.

We need the 3rd letter to be A.

So: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5]

Possible words:

- ""FLAKY"": F L A K Y -> positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:A, 4:K, 5:Y
- ""QUACK"": Q U A C K -> but C is eliminated -> not allowed
- ""QUAFF"": Q U A F F -> but F is available? Yes, but duplicate F? We can use duplicate letters? The rules don't say we can't, but we are trying to maximize information. Also, we don't know if F is in the word. But we are testing Q, U, F, and K? But Q and U are less common.

We can try ""BLAZE"": but Z and E? E is eliminated -> not allowed.

""GLAZE"" has E -> not allowed.

""PHASE"": P is eliminated -> not allowed.

""GRACE"": G, R, A, C, E -> R, C, E are eliminated -> not allowed.

""QUAKE"": Q, U, A, K, E -> E is eliminated -> not allowed.

""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L -> this works: Q, U, A, I, L -> all available? Yes: Q, U, A, I, L -> and A is in the 3rd.

But is ""QUAIL"" a common word? It might be accepted.

Another: ""DWARF"": D, W, A, R, F -> R is eliminated -> not allowed.

""HAZEL"": H, A, Z, E, L -> E eliminated -> not allowed.

""JABOT"": J, A, B, O, T -> A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd.

We need the 3rd to be A.

""BALMY"": B, A, L, M, Y -> A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd.

We need to focus on words with A in the 3rd.

Let me list some:

- ""FLAKY"": F, L, A, K, Y
- ""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L
- ""BLIMP"": B, L, I, M, P -> M and P eliminated -> not allowed
- ""SLING"": S, L, I, N, G -> S and N eliminated -> not allowed
- ""CLAMP"": C, L, A, M, P -> C, M, P eliminated -> not allowed

Another: ""DOZEN"": D, O, Z, E, N -> E and N eliminated -> not allowed

""GAWKY"": G, A, W, K, Y -> A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd.

We need to look for words that have the 3rd letter as A.

Perhaps ""OUIJA"": O, U, I, J, A -> but the 3rd letter is I? Not A.

I think ""FLAKY"" and ""QUAIL"" are options.

But let's think of more:

- ""ABACK"": A, B, A, C, K -> A is in the 1st and 3rd? But we need the 3rd to be A, and the 1st should be A? But in this word, the 1st is A, 2nd is B, 3rd is A, 4th is C, 5th is K. But C is eliminated. So not.

We need the 3rd to be A, and the 1st,2nd,4th,5th to be from the available letters.

Another: ""BIALY"": B, I, A, L, Y -> but A is in the 3rd? 
  Position: 1:B, 2:I, 3:A, 4:L, 5:Y -> yes! And B, I, L, Y are available.

But is ""BIALY"" a common word? It might be obscure.

""KAPUT"": K, A, P, U, T -> A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd. And P and T are eliminated.

""LAUAN"": L, A, U, A, N -> A in 2nd and 4th? Not the 3rd. And N eliminated.

""WAQFS"": W, A, Q, F, S -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. And S eliminated.

""FAUNA"": F, A, U, N, A -> A in 2nd and 5th? Not 3rd. And N eliminated.

""MAUVE"": M, A, U, V, E -> M and E eliminated.

""HAUTE"": H, A, U, T, E -> T and E eliminated.

""RAJAH"": R, A, J, A, H -> R eliminated and A in 2nd and 4th.

I think ""FLAKY"" and ""QUAIL"" are reasonable.

But let's also consider ""BLAND"": B, L, A, N, D -> N eliminated.

""GLAND"": G, L, A, N, D -> N eliminated.

""PLAIT"": P, L, A, I, T -> P and T eliminated.

So without the eliminated letters, we have:

- ""FLAKY"": F, L, A, K, Y
- ""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L
- ""BIALY"": B, I, A, L, Y
- ""DIARY"": D, I, A, R, Y -> R eliminated
- ""FIARY"": not a word? 
- ""LIARD"": not common and R eliminated.

Another: ""GUAVA"": G, U, A, V, A -> A in 3rd? 
  Position: 1:G, 2:U, 3:A, 4:V, 5:A -> yes! And G, U, V, A are available. But we have two A's? That's okay.

But ""GUAVA"" has two A's. We don't know if the secret word has two A's. But it's possible.

Similarly, ""FLAVA""? Not a word.

""VAGUS"": V, A, G, U, S -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. S eliminated.

""DOGMA"": D, O, G, M, A -> M eliminated and A in 5th? Not 3rd.

""ALGAE"": A, L, G, A, E -> E eliminated and A in 1st and 4th? Not 3rd.

""PHASE"": P eliminated.

""CHASE"": C, H, A, S, E -> C, S, E eliminated.

So let's consider ""FLAKY"", ""QUAIL"", and ""GUAVA"".

""GUAVA"" has G, U, V, A, A. We are testing G, U, V, and we already know A is in the 3rd and 5th? But we don't know if there is a 5th A. But we are allowed to use A again? The word must be valid, but we are trying to get information. However, if we use A again, we might get feedback on whether there is a second A.

But we have limited guesses, so we might want to test new letters.

""FLAKY"" tests F, L, K, Y (and A again, but we know A is in the 3rd so the fourth letter is K and fifth Y, and first F).

""QUAIL"" tests Q, U, I, L (and A in 3rd).

""GUAVA"" tests G, U, V, and two A's (so we test G, U, V, and also whether there is an A in the fifth position).

Since we have only 6 guesses, we might avoid repeating A to test more new letters.

But we don't know if the word has another A. However, we can try to avoid repeats to get more information.

So ""FLAKY"" and ""QUAIL"" are better because they have all distinct letters except that A is repeated in ""GUAVA"". But in ""GUAVA"", the A's are in different positions, so we can test if there is a fifth letter.

But let's see the available letters: we have many, so we can choose.

I think ""FLAKY"" is a good choice because it uses common letters F, L, K, Y that we haven't tried.

""QUAIL"" is also good because it tests Q, U, I, L.

But Q and U are less common, so ""FLAKY"" might be better.

Another word: ""WACKY"": W, A, C, K, Y -> C eliminated -> not allowed.

""FLICK"": F, L, I, C, K -> C eliminated.

""BLIMP"": B, L, I, M, P -> M and P eliminated.

""JUICE"": J, U, I, C, E -> C and E eliminated.

""QUITE"": Q, U, I, T, E -> T and E eliminated.

So I think ""FLAKY"" is a solid choice.

But let me check if there are words with more common letters.

What about ""LABOR"": L, A, B, O, R -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. R eliminated.

""LABIA"": L, A, B, I, A -> A in 2nd and 5th? Not 3rd.

""GABON"": not common and N eliminated.

""KAFIR"": K, A, F, I, R -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. R eliminated.

""LAUAN"": not.

Perhaps ""AVAIL"": A, V, A, I, L -> A in 1st and 3rd? But we need the 3rd to be A, and the 1st is A? But we don't know if the word has two A's. However, the 1st letter is A, so if we use A in the 1st, we might get feedback on that.

But ""AVAIL"": A, V, A, I, L -> positions: 1:A, 2:V, 3:A, 4:I, 5:L -> so the 3rd is A. And we are testing V, I, L, and A in the 1st and 5th.

But we already know A is in the 3rd, so we are testing the 1st and 5th as well.

But the word ""AVAIL"" is valid.

However, we have eliminated letters: we are using A, V, I, L. V, I, L are available.

But we are repeating A. We know A is in the 3rd, so if we get a ✓ for A in the 1st or 5th, that would be new information.

But we are trying to find the secret word, so we can use this to test for multiple A's.

But in the feedback, for ""crane"" and ""stamp"", we only had one A and it was correct. If there were two A's, we wouldn't know.

So ""AVAIL"" is a possibility.

But let's compare to ""FLAKY"":

""FLAKY"": tests F, L, K, Y (and A in the 3rd, which we know). We get feedback on F, L, K, Y.

""AVAIL"": tests V, I, L (and A in 1st and 3rd). We get feedback on V, I, L, and also about the first A and the last A.

But ""AVAIL"" uses the letter I, which is a vowel, and we haven't tested I yet.

We haven't tested I, so that might be good.

But ""FLAKY"" tests F, L, K, Y which are also good.

Since we have eliminated many vowels (E, A is known, but A is fixed), we should test other vowels: I, O, U.

In ""AVAIL"", we test I and also O? Not O in this word.

In ""FLAKY"", we test Y which can be a vowel sometimes.

But ""AVAIL"" has two A's, which might be useful if we suspect a double A, but we don't have evidence.

I think ""FLAKY"" is a safer choice because it doesn't repeat A and tests four new letters.

But in ""FLAKY"", the A is only in the 3rd, so we are not testing for additional A's.

We can also consider ""OAKUM"": O, A, K, U, M -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. M eliminated.

""DAHLia"": too long.

5-letter words only.

Another: ""ABYSS"": A in 1st? Not 3rd.

I think ""FLAKY"" is a good choice.

But let me check if there is a word with O or U.

""ALOUD"": A, L, O, U, D -> A in 1st? Not 3rd.

""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O -> A in 1st? Not 3rd.

We need the 3rd to be A.

""PIANO"": P, I, A, N, O -> P and N eliminated.

""RADAR"": R, A, D, A, R -> R eliminated and A in 2nd and 4th.

Not.

""LAUDS"": L, A, U, D, S -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. S eliminated.

""QUADS"": Q, U, A, D, S -> A in 3rd? 
  Position: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:A, 4:D, 5:S -> but S is eliminated. So not.

""QUAFF"": Q, U, A, F, F -> A in 3rd? 
  1:Q, 2:U, 3:A, 4:F, 5:F -> but duplicate F. We can use duplicate letters? The rules don't forbid it, but it might not be efficient.

But we are trying to get information. If we use a word with duplicate letters, we might not know about as many letters.

So I think ""FLAKY"" is better because all letters are distinct.

Another word: ""WACKY"": not allowed because of C.

""FLAKY"" seems good.

But let's see if there is a word with I and O.

""ALGAL"": not common and A in 1st? Not 3rd.

""ATTAR"": A, T, T, A, R -> T and R eliminated.

Not.

""ADIEU"": A, D, I, E, U -> E eliminated and A in 1st? Not 3rd.

I think ""FLAKY"" is a reasonable choice.

But we have to make sure that we are not using any eliminated letters.

Let's list the letters we have eliminated: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P

So for ""FLAKY"": F, L, A, K, Y -> none of these are eliminated. And A is in the 3rd.

Similarly, for ""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L -> none eliminated, A in 3rd.

But ""QUAIL"" has Q and U which are less common. ""FLAKY"" has more common letters: F, L, K, Y.

""FLAKY"" uses F, L, K, Y, which are all fairly common.

We can also consider ""BLUET"": not a word? ""BLUET"" is not standard. ""BLUTE"" has E.

Another word: ""GAWKY"": G, A, W, K, Y -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd.

""JAZZY"": J, A, Z, Z, Y -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd.

I think ""FLAKY"" is a good choice.

But let's try ""HAVOC"": H, A, V, O, C -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. C eliminated.

""KAVAS"": K, A, V, A, S -> A in 2nd and 4th? Not 3rd. S eliminated.

""BAWDY"": B, A, W, D, Y -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd.

""DAFT"": not 5 letters.

I found: ""FLAKY"" is a valid word.

So I'll go with ""FLAKY"".

But note: we are testing F, L, K, Y. If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Alternatively, we can use ""QUAIL"" to test Q, U, I, L.

But I think ""FLAKY"" is more common.

Another option: ""WACKY"" is not allowed.

""FLAKY"" seems good.

But let me check if there is a word with O.

""ALGUM"": not common.

""FLAVY""? Not a word.

""FLAKY"" is the best so far.

We can also consider ""BLAZE"": but E is eliminated.

""GLAZE"": E eliminated.

""BEIGE"": B, E, I, G, E -> E eliminated.

So I think ""FLAKY"" is a solid second guess.

Therefore, I'll guess ""FLAKY"".

But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""FLAKY"" is a valid English word.

So the next guess is ""FLAKY"".

But note: we are not using any eliminated letters.

So let's go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **A is confirmed in the 3rd position** (✓).
- **C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P are eliminated** (x).

For the next guess:
- Must have **A in the 3rd position**.
- Avoid eliminated letters (C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P).
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., F, L, K, Y, Q, U, I, L) to maximize information.

I chose **FLAKY** because:
- It places A in the 3rd position.
- Tests new common letters: F, L, K, Y.
- Uses distinct letters to cover more possibilities.
- Avoids eliminated letters and repeats.

<guess>flaky</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: stamp -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) M(x) P(x)
Guess 3: flaky -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(-) A(✓) K(x) Y(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, 3rd)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""stamp""
- S: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, 3rd)
- M: x (not in the word)
- P: x (not in the word)

Guess 3: ""flaky""
- F: x (not in the word)
- L: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: ✓ (correct position, 3rd)
- K: x (not in the word)
- Y: x (not in the word)

So, from all feedback, we know:

1. The secret word has the letter L in it, but not in the 2nd position (since in ""flaky"", L was in the 2nd and got a '-', meaning it's present but not there).
2. The secret word does not contain: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P, F, K, Y.
3. A is in the 3rd position and is correct.

The eliminated letters are: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P, F, K, Y.

Available letters: A, B, D, G, H, I, J, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (and L is in the word, but we don't know its position yet).

We also know that L is in the word, but not in the 2nd position. So L could be in position 1, 4, or 5.

The pattern is: _ _ A _ _

We need to form a word that has A in the 3rd position, includes L (but not in the 2nd), and uses only the available letters.

Let's list possible words:

- We need to fill positions 1, 2, 4, 5 with letters from: A, B, D, G, H, I, J, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, and we know L must be in one of 1,4,5 (but not 2).

But note: L can be in the word multiple times? The feedback only said L is in the word, but we don't know if it appears once or more. However, since we only have one L in the guesses, we don't know the count.

We must avoid the eliminated letters.

Let's try to think of words that fit the pattern and use the available letters.

Possible words:

- ""BLAND"": but N is eliminated -> not allowed
- ""BLAZE"": E eliminated -> not allowed
- ""BLAST"": S and T eliminated -> not allowed
- ""BLIMP"": M and P eliminated -> not allowed

We need to avoid the eliminated letters.

Another: ""DOULA"": D, O, U, L, A -> but A is in the 5th? Not the 3rd. We need A in the 3rd.

The pattern is: _ _ A _ _

So the 3rd is A, so the word must be: [1] [2] A [4] [5]

We need to choose letters from: A, B, D, G, H, I, J, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, and L must be in one of 1,4,5.

But L cannot be in position 2, which is already covered.

Let's try to find words:

- ""FLAVA""? Not a word.
- ""FLAKY"" we already tried, and K and Y are eliminated.

What about ""GLAZE"": has E -> eliminated.

""QUAFF"": Q, U, A, F, F -> F eliminated, and duplicate F? But F is eliminated.

""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L -> this is a candidate. Letters: Q, U, A, I, L. 
- Q: not tested
- U: not tested
- A: in 3rd (known)
- I: not tested
- L: in the word, but we are using it in the 5th position. We know L is not in the 2nd, but we don't know about the 5th.

In ""QUAIL"", L is in the 5th position. That's allowed because we haven't tested the 5th position for L.

Another word: ""QUAIL"" is valid.

But we have to check if the letters are available: 
- Q: not eliminated -> okay
- U: not eliminated -> okay
- A: known in 3rd -> okay
- I: not tested -> okay
- L: in the word -> okay, and we are testing it in the 5th.

But we are using Q and U, which are less common. However, we have to use the available letters.

Another possibility: ""WAQFS"" -> but S eliminated and A not in 3rd.

""JUMBO"": M eliminated.

""DOULA"": D, O, U, L, A -> pattern: 1:D, 2:O, 3:? -> but we need A in 3rd? This has L in the 4th and A in the 5th? Not 3rd.

We need the 3rd to be A.

""BALDY"": B, A, L, D, Y -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. Y eliminated.

""HALLO"": H, A, L, L, O -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd.

""GAWKY"": G, A, W, K, Y -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. K and Y eliminated.

""JAWAB"": J, A, W, A, B -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd.

""LAUAN"": L, A, U, A, N -> A in 2nd and 4th? Not 3rd. N eliminated.

""OAKUM"": O, A, K, U, M -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. K and M eliminated.

""QUAKE"": Q, U, A, K, E -> E eliminated and K eliminated.

""QUAIL"" seems a good candidate.

Another word: ""VIXEN"": V, I, X, E, N -> E and N eliminated.

""WOVEN"": W, O, V, E, N -> E and N eliminated.

""JUVEN"": not a word.

""QUAFF"" is not common and has F.

""QUAIL"" is a valid word.

Another: ""DOZEN"": D, O, Z, E, N -> E and N eliminated.

""GUANO"": G, U, A, N, O -> N eliminated.

""GUAVA"": G, U, A, V, A -> this has A in the 3rd? 
  Position: 1:G, 2:U, 3:A, 4:V, 5:A -> yes! And G, U, V, A are available. But we have two A's. We know A is in the 3rd, so the 5th is another A? That's possible.

But we are testing G, U, V, and the second A.

But we have to avoid eliminated letters: G, U, V are available, and A is already known.

But we are using A again in the 5th. We know A is in the 3rd, so if we get a ✓ for the 5th A, that would be new information.

But we are also testing G, U, V.

Is ""GUAVA"" common? It is a word.

But we have to consider that we are testing three new letters: G, U, V, and the fifth letter is A again.

We can also consider ""FLAVA"" - not a word.

""QUAIL"" tests Q, U, I, L (and A in 3rd).

""QUAIL"" uses Q and U, which are less common, but I is a common vowel.

Another word: ""BIJOU"": B, I, J, O, U -> but A not in 3rd.

We need A in the 3rd.

""BIALY"": B, I, A, L, Y -> but Y eliminated.

""DIARY"": D, I, A, R, Y -> R and Y eliminated.

""FIEST"": F and E and S eliminated.

""GIANT"": G, I, A, N, T -> N and T eliminated.

""GIANT"" has N and T, which are eliminated.

""HOAGY"": H, O, A, G, Y -> Y eliminated.

""HOBBY"": H, O, B, B, Y -> Y eliminated and duplicate B.

""JUMBO"": M eliminated.

""LABIA"": L, A, B, I, A -> A in 2nd and 5th? Not 3rd.

""LABOR"": L, A, B, O, R -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. R eliminated.

""LACKO"": C and K eliminated.

""LADLE"": L, A, D, L, E -> E eliminated and duplicate L? But L is in the word, but we are using it in the 1st and 4th? Not efficient and E eliminated.

""LARGO"": L, A, R, G, O -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. R eliminated.

""LAUAN"": not.

""OAKUM"": not.

""QUAIL"" seems to be one of the few options.

Another: ""DOULA"": D, O, U, L, A -> pattern: 1:D, 2:O, 3:? -> but the 3rd is L? Not A. We need the 3rd to be A.

""DOULA"" is D-O-U-L-A, so position 3 is L, not A.

We need the 3rd to be A.

""GUANO"": not.

""GUAVA"": G, U, A, V, A -> 1:G, 2:U, 3:A, 4:V, 5:A -> yes, the 3rd is A.

And letters: G, U, V, A, A. 
- G: available
- U: available
- V: available
- A: known in 3rd and also in 5th (so we are testing for a second A)

But we are using two A's. We know A is in the 3rd, so if we get a ✓ for the 5th A, that would be new.

But we are also testing G, U, V.

Is ""GUAVA"" common? Yes.

But we have to compare with ""QUAIL"".

""QUAIL"" uses Q, U, I, L, and A in 3rd and 5th? No, ""QUAIL"" has only one A? 
""QUAIL"": Q-U-A-I-L -> only one A, in the 3rd.

""GUAVA"": G-U-A-V-A -> two A's.

We can also consider ""VAUCH"": not a word.

""QUAIL"" might be better because it has more distinct letters? ""GUAVA"" has two A's, so we are testing fewer new letters.

In ""QUAIL"", we test Q, U, I, L (and A in 3rd, which we know). So we test four new letters: Q, U, I, L.

In ""GUAVA"", we test G, U, V, and the second A, so we test three new letters: G, U, V.

Therefore, ""QUAIL"" tests more new letters.

But Q and U are less common, but we have to use them because they are available.

Another word: ""WAQFS"" -> not.

""JAWAB"": not.

""LAUAN"": not.

""QUAIL"" is a valid option.

But let's see if there is a word with O or I.

""QUOIN"": Q, U, O, I, N -> N eliminated and A not in 3rd.

""QUOTA"": Q, U, O, T, A -> T eliminated and A in 5th? Not 3rd.

""VODKA"": V, O, D, K, A -> K eliminated and A in 5th.

""VOILA"": V, O, I, L, A -> pattern: 1:V, 2:O, 3:I, 4:L, 5:A -> but we need the 3rd to be A, not I. So no.

We need the 3rd to be A.

""BIAS"": not 5 letters.

""QUAIL"" seems the best.

But we have to consider that L is in the word, and in ""QUAIL"" it is in the 5th. We know L is not in the 2nd, but we don't know about the 5th.

Another word: ""DUVET"": D, U, V, E, T -> E and T eliminated.

""JUVEN"": not a word.

""QUAIL"" is a valid word.

But let's check if there is a word with L in the 1st or 4th.

For example, with L in the 1st: ""L_ _ A _ _""

But we need the 3rd to be A, so the word must be: L [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5]

What letters for position 2? It cannot be L (because if L is in the 1st, we don't know if it can be repeated? But we don't know if the word has two L's. However, we haven't tested L in other positions.

But we know L is in the word, but we don't know the position. So we can try to put L in a new position.

In ""flaky"", L was in position 2 and got a '-', so it's not in 2, so we can try position 1, 4, or 5.

In ""QUAIL"", we put L in position 5.

In ""GUAVA"", we put L in position 4? 
""GUAVA"": G-U-A-V-A -> position 4 is V, position 5 is A. So L is not in this word? But we know L must be in the word. ""GUAVA"" does not contain L. So it cannot be the word because L is missing.

We must include L in the guess because we know it's in the word.

So the word must contain L.

Therefore, we cannot use ""GUAVA"" because it doesn't have L.

Similarly, we must use L.

So back to ""QUAIL"": it has L and A in the 3rd.

Another word: ""QUILL"": Q, U, I, L, L -> but duplicate L? And the pattern: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:I, 4:L, 5:L -> but we need the 3rd to be A, not I. So not.

We need the 3rd to be A.

""QUAIL"" is the only common word I can think of that fits: 
- Position 1: Q
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: A (fixed)
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: L

And all letters are available: Q, U, I, L are all in the available set (Q, U, I, L are not eliminated, and A is known).

But Q and U are less common, but it's a valid word.

Another word: ""QUAFF"" is not, because of F and duplicate F? But F is eliminated.

""QUAKE"" is out because of E and K.

""QUART"": Q, U, A, R, T -> R and T eliminated.

""QUART"" has R and T, which are eliminated.

""QUASI"": Q, U, A, S, I -> S eliminated.

""QUASI"" has S, which is eliminated.

""QUOTA"": Q, U, O, T, A -> T eliminated and A in 5th.

Not.

""VODKA"": K eliminated and A in 5th.

I think ""QUAIL"" is the best option.

But let's see if there is a word with O or I.

""ALOUD"": A in 1st? Not 3rd.

""AUDIO"": A in 1st? Not 3rd.

""OBIIT"": not a word.

""QUAIL"" is the word.

But we have to consider that we are using two vowels: U and I. We haven't tested U and I.

We can also consider ""BLUID""? Not a word.

""GLYPH"": G, L, Y, P, H -> Y and P eliminated, and no A.

We need A in the 3rd.

""BLUET"": not a word.

""FLUID"": F eliminated and A not in 3rd.

I think ""QUAIL"" is the only common word that fits.

But let's check: is there a word like ""L_ _ A _ _"" with A in 3rd?

For example, ""LUCRE"": L, U, C, R, E -> C, R, E eliminated.

""LAMAR"": L, A, M, A, R -> M and R eliminated.

""LAPIN"": L, A, P, I, N -> P and N eliminated.

""LARVA"": L, A, R, V, A -> R eliminated.

""LEAVE"": L, E, A, V, E -> E eliminated.

""LIBRA"": L, I, B, R, A -> R eliminated and A in 5th.

Not.

""LIVID"": L, I, V, I, D -> no A.

We need A in the 3rd.

""LAVAS"": L, A, V, A, S -> A in 2nd and 4th? Not 3rd. S eliminated.

""LAVAS"" has S eliminated.

""LAWNS"": L, A, W, N, S -> N and S eliminated.

""LAWns"" has N and S.

""LAWNS"" is not allowed.

""LAWNS"" -> N and S eliminated.

""LAWS"": not 5 letters.

I think we have to go with ""QUAIL"".

But let's see if there is a word with O.

""ALGAL"": A in 1st? Not 3rd.

""ATTAR"": A in 1st? Not 3rd.

""AVAIL"": A in 1st and 3rd? But we need the 3rd to be A, and the 1st is A? But we don't know if the word has two A's. However, in ""AVAIL"", the 3rd is A, so that's good. But the 1st is A, which we know is in the 3rd, so if we use A in the 1st, we might get feedback on whether there is a second A.

But we are avoiding eliminated letters: A, V, A, I, L -> A is known, V, I, L are available.

But we have two A's. The pattern is: A V A I L -> so position 1: A, 2: V, 3: A? No, 3 is A? 
A V A I L -> position 1: A, 2: V, 3: A, 4: I, 5: L -> so the 3rd is A, which is good. But we are using A in the 1st and 3rd. We know the 3rd is A, so the 1st A might be another occurrence.

But we are testing for multiple A's.

However, we have to avoid eliminated letters: A, V, I, L are available? 
- A: we know is in the word, but we are testing if it appears again.
- V: not tested -> okay
- I: not tested -> okay
- L: in the word, testing it in the 5th position.

But we are using two A's, which might be inefficient for information.

Moreover, ""AVAIL"" has A in the 1st, which we don't know about.

But we are testing the 1st position with A.

Alternatively, we can use ""QUAIL"" which has only one A.

I think ""QUAIL"" is better because it tests more new letters.

But let's see the feedback we got for ""flaky"": L is in the word but not in the 2nd. So in ""QUAIL"", we are putting L in the 5th. If L is in the 5th, we might get a ✓ or a '-'.

Similarly, in ""QUAIL"", we are putting U in the 2nd and I in the 4th.

We haven't tested U or I.

In ""AVAIL"", we test V, I, and A in the 1st.

But ""AVAIL"" has A in the 1st, which we don't know about, and we are testing V and I.

But we are repeating A.

I think ""QUAIL"" is a better choice.

But we have to consider that the word might have the 3rd letter as A and the 5th as A? But that would be ""AVAIL"", which has A in the 1st and 3rd.

But we don't know if the word has two A's.

To maximize information, we should avoid repeating known letters? But we know A is in the 3rd, so if we use A in the 1st, we can test if there is a second A.

But we have limited guesses, so we might want to test new letters.

Since we have many available letters, we can choose a word that tests more common letters.

Common letters left: B, D, G, H, I, O, U.

In ""QUAIL"", we test Q, U, I, L.

In ""AVAIL"", we test V, I, and the second A (so effectively three tests: V, I, and the A in 1st).

But ""AVAIL"" has two A's, so we are testing two positions for A? But we know A is in the 3rd, so if we get a ✓ for the first A, that means there is an A in the 1st and 3rd? But the 3rd is already known, so if we get ✓ for the first A, then the word has A in 1st and 3rd.

But we don't know if that's the case.

We can also consider ""QUAIL"" to test more new letters.

But let's see the available letters: we have many, but we need to cover them.

Another word: ""DOULA"" -> D, O, U, L, A -> pattern: 1:D, 2:O, 3:L, 4:U, 5:A -> but we need the 3rd to be A, not L. So not.

""DOULA"" has L in the 3rd? Not A.

I think we have to go with ""QUAIL"" or ""AVAIL"".

But ""AVAIL"" has the advantage of testing if there is an A in the 1st, but ""QUAIL"" tests more new letters.

Since we have only 6 guesses, and we have 3 left, we can try ""QUAIL"".

But let's see if there is a word with O.

""ALGAL"" not.

""ATTAR"" not.

""AVOID"": A in 1st? Not 3rd.

""AVOWS"": A in 1st? Not 3rd.

""BAWDY"": A in 2nd? Not 3rd.

I think ""QUAIL"" is the best.

But let's check the dictionary: ""QUAIL"" is a valid word.

""GUAVA"" is also valid, but has two A's.

But to test more letters, ""QUAIL"" has four new letters: Q, U, I, L.

""GUAVA"" has three: G, U, V, and the second A.

So ""QUAIL"" tests more letters.

Moreover, in ""QUAIL"", we are putting L in the 5th position. We know L is in the word, and we haven't tested the 5th for L.

In ""AVAIL"", we put A in the 1st and 3rd, and L in the 5th.

But we know the 3rd is A, so if we put A in the 1st, we might get feedback on whether there is a second A.

But we are using a known letter A in the 1st, which we don't need to test again? We know A is in the 3rd, so if we put A in the 1st, and if it's not in the word, we get x, which tells us there is no second A. If we get ✓, then there is a second A in the 1st.

But we are using a guess to test that.

Similarly, in ""QUAIL"", we are not testing the 1st position with A.

So both are possible.

But I think ""QUAIL"" is better because it tests four new letters without repeating known letters.

So I'll go with ""QUAIL"".

But let's confirm the pattern: Q-U-A-I-L -> positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:A (known), 4:I, 5:L.

We are testing:
- Q in position 1
- U in position 2
- I in position 4
- L in position 5

And we know A in position 3 is correct.

So we'll get feedback on Q, U, I, L.

If L is in the 5th, we might get a ✓ for L, or a '-' if it's in the word but not 5th.

Similarly for the others.

So I think it's a good guess.

Therefore, the next guess is ""QUAIL"".

But note: we have to make sure that Q and U are not eliminated. They are not in the eliminated list.

Eliminated: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P, F, K, Y.

So Q and U are available.

I think ""QUAIL"" is the word to guess.

But let's see if there is a word with O.

""QUAGO""? Not a word.

""QUAFF"" is not.

""QUAIL"" is the best.

So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **A is confirmed in the 3rd position** (✓).
- **L is in the word but not in the 2nd position** (-).
- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P, F, K, Y (all x).

The secret word pattern is: _ _ A _ _

Available letters: A, B, D, G, H, I, J, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (and L must be included).

Since L is in the word but position unknown (not 2nd), it must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

After evaluating possible words:
- **QUAIL** is a valid option that fits the pattern (_ _ A _ _) and includes L in the 5th position (testing if L is there).
- It tests new common letters: Q, U, I (and L in a new position).
- Avoids all eliminated letters.

But we can use them because they are not eliminated.\n   ""BLAST"" -> but B, L, S, T are not eliminated, but note that we have A in the 3rd.\n\n However, we must avoid using the eliminated letters: C, R, N, E.\n\n Let\'s list some words with A in the 3rd position and without C, R, N, E:\n\n   ""BALMY"" -> B, A, L, M, Y -> but we don\'t know about B, L, M, Y.\n   ""PALMS"" -> P, A, L, M, S -> again, no C, R, N, E.\n\n But note: we want to maximize information.

We cannot use E.\n\n So avoid E.\n\n Another word: ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T -> no eliminated letters? \n   P, L, A, I, T: A is in the 3rd, and we are avoiding C, R, N, E. So this is acceptable.\n\n But we don\'t know if the word has P, L, I, T.\n\n Alternatively, ""BLAST"": B, L, A, S, T -> also acceptable.\n\n However, note that we have only 6 tries, so we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that has distinct letters and covers common ones.\n\n I\'ll go with ""PLAIT"" because it has P, L, I, T which are common.\n\n But wait, we have to make sure it\'s a valid word.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""STAMP"": S, T, A, M, P -> but A is in the 3rd? \n   S (1st), T (2nd), A (3rd), M (4th), P (5th). Yes.\n\n But note: we are avoiding E, and STAMP doesn\'t have E. Also, no C, R, N.\n\n However, we already know A is in the 3rd, so we can use that.\n\n But let me check: we have eliminated C, R, N, E. So we can use any other letters.\n\n Another common word: ""SHALT"" -> but that might be archaic? We should use common words.\n\n Let\'s stick with common words.\n\n I think ""PLAIT"" is a good candidate because it has two vowels (A and I) and three consonants (P, L, T) that we haven\'t tried.\n\n But note: we have already eliminated E, so the word might have other vowels? Like O, U, I?\n\n We can also consider ""OPALE"" but that has E which is eliminated.\n\n Another word: ""QUAIL"" -> Q, U, A, I, L -> but Q and U are less common? And we have A in the 3rd.\n\n But we want to test more common letters.\n\n Let me think of words that have S, T, L, and other common letters.\n\n ""SLANT"" -> but N is eliminated! We cannot use N.\n\n So avoid N.\n\n ""SLATE"" is out because of E.\n\n ""PLAIT"" seems okay.\n\n Alternatively, ""BLIMP"": B, L, I, M, P -> but no A? We must have A in the 3rd.\n\n So we must choose a word that has A in the 3rd.\n\n Let me list: \n   ""ABACK"" -> but A is in the 1st? We need A in the 3rd.\n\n So the word must be: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5]\n\n We can use: \n   ""PLAIT: P L A I T -> positions: 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:I, 5:T\n   ""BLAST: B L A S T -> 1:B, 2:L, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T\n   ""STAMP: S T A M P -> 1:S, 2:T, 3:A, 4:M, 5:P\n   ""SHARD: S H A R D -> but R is eliminated!

Also, A is in the 3rd? \n   G L A S S -> 1:G, 2:L, 3:A, 4:S, 5:S -> but we have two S\'s. It\'s valid, but we might get less information because of duplicate letters.\n\n We want to test as many new letters as possible, so distinct letters are better.\n\n So ""PLAIT"" has distinct letters: P, L, A, I, T -> all distinct.\n\n Similarly, ""BLAST"" has B, L, A, S, T -> distinct.\n\n ""STAMP"" has S, T, A, M, P -> distinct.\n\n I think ""STAMP"" is a good choice because it has S, T, M, P which are very common.\n\n But note: we already know A is in the 3rd, so we are testing S, T, M, P in positions 1,2,4,5.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""PAINT"" -> but N is eliminated and T is at the end? \n   P A I N T -> but we need A in the 3rd? This has A in the 2nd. So not.\n\n We must have the 3rd letter as A.\n\n Another word: ""FAULT"" -> F A U L T -> A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd.\n\n So let\'s choose between ""PLAIT"" and ""STAMP"".\n\n I think ""STAMP"" is more common and has more common letters.\n\n But note: we have eliminated E, so the word might have O, U, I, O? \n\n We can also consider ""DAILY"": D A I L Y -> A is in the 2nd? No.\n\n We need the 3rd to be A.\n\n Let me think of words: \n   ""BEADY"" -> B E A D Y -> but E is eliminated! So we cannot use E.\n\n   ""HEADY"" -> H E A D Y -> E is eliminated.\n\n   ""LEAVE"" -> has E and also V? But E is eliminated.\n\n So avoid E.\n\n Another: ""QUAKE"" -> Q U A K E -> E is eliminated.\n\n So we avoid E.\n\n After some thought, I\'ll go with ""STAMP"".\n\n But wait, we have to make sure that we are not using any eliminated letters: \n   S, T, A, M, P -> none of C, R, N, E. So it\'s okay.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""SLACK"" -> but C is eliminated? Yes, C is eliminated. So we cannot use C.\n\n So ""STAMP"" is safe.\n\n Let me check: \n   S: not tested yet\n   T: not tested\n   A: we know is in the word and in the 3rd position (so we expect a check for A, but we are testing the position)\n   M: not tested\n   P: not tested\n\n This will give us information about S, T, M, P.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""PLAIT"" to test P, L, I, T.\n\n But I think ""STAMP"" is a good choice because S and T are very common at the beginning or the end.\n\n Since we know A is fixed in the 3rd, we can try to cover the other positions.\n\n I\'ll go with ""STAMP"".\n\n So the next guess: ""STAMP""\n\n But note: the feedback for A will be ✓ because we know it\'s in the 3rd. So we are mainly testing the other letters.\n\n Let me write the guess: STAMP\n\n However, note that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t know.\n\n We are hoping to get feedback on S, T, M, P.\n\n If we get a ✓ for A, then we know it\'s still in the 3rd (which we already know) and we get feedback on the others.\n\n So let\'s go with ""STAMP"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- A is confirmed in the 3rd position (✓).\n- C, R, N, E are eliminated (x).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must have A in the 3rd position.\n- Avoid using C, R, N, E.\n- Prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, M, P, L, I) to maximize information.\n\nI chose **STAMP** because:\n- It places A in the 3rd position.\n- Tests new common letters: S, T, M, P.\n- Avoids eliminated letters (C, R, N, E).\n- Uses distinct letters to cover more possibilities.\n\n<guess>stamp</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: stamp -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) M(x) P(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: ✓ (correct position, so the secret word has A in the 3rd position)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: ""stamp""\n- S: x (not in the word)\n- T: x (not in the word)\n- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is still in the 3rd position)\n- M: x (not in the word)\n- P: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, from both guesses, we know:\n- The secret word has A in the 3rd position: _ _ A _ _\n- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P\n\nWe have eliminated 8 letters: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that has A in the 3rd position and does not contain any of the eliminated letters.\n\nAvailable letters: We have not tested many letters. The alphabet minus the eliminated ones:\nEliminated: C, E, M, N, P, R, S, T\nSo available: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nBut note: A is already in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears twice? The feedback doesn\'t tell us about multiple occurrences. However, since we only have one A in the guesses and it was marked correct, we don\'t know if there are more A\'s. But we can assume for now that there is at least one A in the 3rd position.\n\nWe need to choose a word that uses only the available letters and has A in the 3rd.\n\nWe also want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nLet\'s think of common words that fit:\n\nPattern: _ _ A _ _\n\nWe can try:\n\n- ""BLANK"": but N is eliminated -> not allowed\n- ""FLAKY"": F, L, A, K, Y -> all available? Let\'s check: F, L, A, K, Y. Yes, none of C,E,M,N,P,R,S,T. So it\'s valid.\n- ""GLAZE"": but Z and E? E is eliminated -> not allowed\n- ""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L -> all available? Q, U, A, I, L: yes. But Q and U are less common? But it\'s a valid word.\n- ""JUMBO"": but O? We don\'t know about O, but the pattern is _ _ A _ _ -> J, U, M, B, O -> M is eliminated? Yes, M is eliminated from guess 2. So not allowed.\n\nWe must avoid M.\n\nAnother: ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> but A is in the 2nd? We need A in the 3rd. So no.\n\nWe need the 3rd to be A.\n\nLet\'s try ""FAVOR"": F, A, V, O, R -> but A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd.\n\nWe need the 3rd letter to be A.\n\nSo: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5]\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""FLAKY"": F L A K Y -> positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:A, 4:K, 5:Y\n- ""QUACK"": Q U A C K -> but C is eliminated -> not allowed\n- ""QUAFF"": Q U A F F -> but F is available? Yes, but duplicate F? We can use duplicate letters? The rules don\'t say we can\'t, but we are trying to maximize information. Also, we don\'t know if F is in the word. But we are testing Q, U, F, and K? But Q and U are less common.\n\nWe can try ""BLAZE"": but Z and E? E is eliminated -> not allowed.\n\n""GLAZE"" has E -> not allowed.\n\n""PHASE"": P is eliminated -> not allowed.\n\n""GRACE"": G, R, A, C, E -> R, C, E are eliminated -> not allowed.\n\n""QUAKE"": Q, U, A, K, E -> E is eliminated -> not allowed.\n\n""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L -> this works: Q, U, A, I, L -> all available? Yes: Q, U, A, I, L -> and A is in the 3rd.\n\nBut is ""QUAIL"" a common word? It might be accepted.\n\nAnother: ""DWARF"": D, W, A, R, F -> R is eliminated -> not allowed.\n\n""HAZEL"": H, A, Z, E, L -> E eliminated -> not allowed.\n\n""JABOT"": J, A, B, O, T -> A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd.\n\nWe need the 3rd to be A.\n\n""BALMY"": B, A, L, M, Y -> A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd.\n\nWe need to focus on words with A in the 3rd.\n\nLet me list some:\n\n- ""FLAKY"": F, L, A, K, Y\n- ""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L\n- ""BLIMP"": B, L, I, M, P -> M and P eliminated -> not allowed\n- ""SLING"": S, L, I, N, G -> S and N eliminated -> not allowed\n- ""CLAMP"": C, L, A, M, P -> C, M, P eliminated -> not allowed\n\nAnother: ""DOZEN"": D, O, Z, E, N -> E and N eliminated -> not allowed\n\n""GAWKY"": G, A, W, K, Y -> A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd.\n\nWe need to look for words that have the 3rd letter as A.\n\nPerhaps ""OUIJA"": O, U, I, J, A -> but the 3rd letter is I? Not A.\n\nI think ""FLAKY"" and ""QUAIL"" are options.\n\nBut let\'s think of more:\n\n- ""ABACK"": A, B, A, C, K -> A is in the 1st and 3rd? But we need the 3rd to be A, and the 1st should be A? But in this word, the 1st is A, 2nd is B, 3rd is A, 4th is C, 5th is K. But C is eliminated. So not.\n\nWe need the 3rd to be A, and the 1st,2nd,4th,5th to be from the available letters.\n\nAnother: ""BIALY"": B, I, A, L, Y -> but A is in the 3rd? \n  Position: 1:B, 2:I, 3:A, 4:L, 5:Y -> yes! And B, I, L, Y are available.\n\nBut is ""BIALY"" a common word? It might be obscure.\n\n""KAPUT"": K, A, P, U, T -> A is in the 2nd? Not the 3rd. And P and T are eliminated.\n\n""LAUAN"": L, A, U, A, N -> A in 2nd and 4th? Not the 3rd. And N eliminated.\n\n""WAQFS"": W, A, Q, F, S -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. And S eliminated.\n\n""FAUNA"": F, A, U, N, A -> A in 2nd and 5th? Not 3rd. And N eliminated.\n\n""MAUVE"": M, A, U, V, E -> M and E eliminated.\n\n""HAUTE"": H, A, U, T, E -> T and E eliminated.\n\n""RAJAH"": R, A, J, A, H -> R eliminated and A in 2nd and 4th.\n\nI think ""FLAKY"" and ""QUAIL"" are reasonable.\n\nBut let\'s also consider ""BLAND"": B, L, A, N, D -> N eliminated.\n\n""GLAND"": G, L, A, N, D -> N eliminated.\n\n""PLAIT"": P, L, A, I, T -> P and T eliminated.\n\nSo without the eliminated letters, we have:\n\n- ""FLAKY"": F, L, A, K, Y\n- ""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L\n- ""BIALY"": B, I, A, L, Y\n- ""DIARY"": D, I, A, R, Y -> R eliminated\n- ""FIARY"": not a word? \n- ""LIARD"": not common and R eliminated.\n\nAnother: ""GUAVA"": G, U, A, V, A -> A in 3rd? \n  Position: 1:G, 2:U, 3:A, 4:V, 5:A -> yes! And G, U, V, A are available. But we have two A\'s? That\'s okay.\n\nBut ""GUAVA"" has two A\'s. We don\'t know if the secret word has two A\'s. But it\'s possible.\n\nSimilarly, ""FLAVA""? Not a word.\n\n""VAGUS"": V, A, G, U, S -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. S eliminated.\n\n""DOGMA"": D, O, G, M, A -> M eliminated and A in 5th? Not 3rd.\n\n""ALGAE"": A, L, G, A, E -> E eliminated and A in 1st and 4th? Not 3rd.\n\n""PHASE"": P eliminated.\n\n""CHASE"": C, H, A, S, E -> C, S, E eliminated.\n\nSo let\'s consider ""FLAKY"", ""QUAIL"", and ""GUAVA"".\n\n""GUAVA"" has G, U, V, A, A. We are testing G, U, V, and we already know A is in the 3rd and 5th? But we don\'t know if there is a 5th A. But we are allowed to use A again? The word must be valid, but we are trying to get information. However, if we use A again, we might get feedback on whether there is a second A.\n\nBut we have limited guesses, so we might want to test new letters.\n\n""FLAKY"" tests F, L, K, Y (and A again, but we know A is in the 3rd so the fourth letter is K and fifth Y, and first F).\n\n""QUAIL"" tests Q, U, I, L (and A in 3rd).\n\n""GUAVA"" tests G, U, V, and two A\'s (so we test G, U, V, and also whether there is an A in the fifth position).\n\nSince we have only 6 guesses, we might avoid repeating A to test more new letters.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has another A. However, we can try to avoid repeats to get more information.\n\nSo ""FLAKY"" and ""QUAIL"" are better because they have all distinct letters except that A is repeated in ""GUAVA"". But in ""GUAVA"", the A\'s are in different positions, so we can test if there is a fifth letter.\n\nBut let\'s see the available letters: we have many, so we can choose.\n\nI think ""FLAKY"" is a good choice because it uses common letters F, L, K, Y that we haven\'t tried.\n\n""QUAIL"" is also good because it tests Q, U, I, L.\n\nBut Q and U are less common, so ""FLAKY"" might be better.\n\nAnother word: ""WACKY"": W, A, C, K, Y -> C eliminated -> not allowed.\n\n""FLICK"": F, L, I, C, K -> C eliminated.\n\n""BLIMP"": B, L, I, M, P -> M and P eliminated.\n\n""JUICE"": J, U, I, C, E -> C and E eliminated.\n\n""QUITE"": Q, U, I, T, E -> T and E eliminated.\n\nSo I think ""FLAKY"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut let me check if there are words with more common letters.\n\nWhat about ""LABOR"": L, A, B, O, R -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. R eliminated.\n\n""LABIA"": L, A, B, I, A -> A in 2nd and 5th? Not 3rd.\n\n""GABON"": not common and N eliminated.\n\n""KAFIR"": K, A, F, I, R -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. R eliminated.\n\n""LAUAN"": not.\n\nPerhaps ""AVAIL"": A, V, A, I, L -> A in 1st and 3rd? But we need the 3rd to be A, and the 1st is A? But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. However, the 1st letter is A, so if we use A in the 1st, we might get feedback on that.\n\nBut ""AVAIL"": A, V, A, I, L -> positions: 1:A, 2:V, 3:A, 4:I, 5:L -> so the 3rd is A. And we are testing V, I, L, and A in the 1st and 5th.\n\nBut we already know A is in the 3rd, so we are testing the 1st and 5th as well.\n\nBut the word ""AVAIL"" is valid.\n\nHowever, we have eliminated letters: we are using A, V, I, L. V, I, L are available.\n\nBut we are repeating A. We know A is in the 3rd, so if we get a ✓ for A in the 1st or 5th, that would be new information.\n\nBut we are trying to find the secret word, so we can use this to test for multiple A\'s.\n\nBut in the feedback, for ""crane"" and ""stamp"", we only had one A and it was correct. If there were two A\'s, we wouldn\'t know.\n\nSo ""AVAIL"" is a possibility.\n\nBut let\'s compare to ""FLAKY"":\n\n""FLAKY"": tests F, L, K, Y (and A in the 3rd, which we know). We get feedback on F, L, K, Y.\n\n""AVAIL"": tests V, I, L (and A in 1st and 3rd). We get feedback on V, I, L, and also about the first A and the last A.\n\nBut ""AVAIL"" uses the letter I, which is a vowel, and we haven\'t tested I yet.\n\nWe haven\'t tested I, so that might be good.\n\nBut ""FLAKY"" tests F, L, K, Y which are also good.\n\nSince we have eliminated many vowels (E, A is known, but A is fixed), we should test other vowels: I, O, U.\n\nIn ""AVAIL"", we test I and also O? Not O in this word.\n\nIn ""FLAKY"", we test Y which can be a vowel sometimes.\n\nBut ""AVAIL"" has two A\'s, which might be useful if we suspect a double A, but we don\'t have evidence.\n\nI think ""FLAKY"" is a safer choice because it doesn\'t repeat A and tests four new letters.\n\nBut in ""FLAKY"", the A is only in the 3rd, so we are not testing for additional A\'s.\n\nWe can also consider ""OAKUM"": O, A, K, U, M -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. M eliminated.\n\n""DAHLia"": too long.\n\n5-letter words only.\n\nAnother: ""ABYSS"": A in 1st? Not 3rd.\n\nI think ""FLAKY"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me check if there is a word with O or U.\n\n""ALOUD"": A, L, O, U, D -> A in 1st? Not 3rd.\n\n""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O -> A in 1st? Not 3rd.\n\nWe need the 3rd to be A.\n\n""PIANO"": P, I, A, N, O -> P and N eliminated.\n\n""RADAR"": R, A, D, A, R -> R eliminated and A in 2nd and 4th.\n\nNot.\n\n""LAUDS"": L, A, U, D, S -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. S eliminated.\n\n""QUADS"": Q, U, A, D, S -> A in 3rd? \n  Position: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:A, 4:D, 5:S -> but S is eliminated. So not.\n\n""QUAFF"": Q, U, A, F, F -> A in 3rd? \n  1:Q, 2:U, 3:A, 4:F, 5:F -> but duplicate F. We can use duplicate letters? The rules don\'t forbid it, but it might not be efficient.\n\nBut we are trying to get information. If we use a word with duplicate letters, we might not know about as many letters.\n\nSo I think ""FLAKY"" is better because all letters are distinct.\n\nAnother word: ""WACKY"": not allowed because of C.\n\n""FLAKY"" seems good.\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word with I and O.\n\n""ALGAL"": not common and A in 1st? Not 3rd.\n\n""ATTAR"": A, T, T, A, R -> T and R eliminated.\n\nNot.\n\n""ADIEU"": A, D, I, E, U -> E eliminated and A in 1st? Not 3rd.\n\nI think ""FLAKY"" is a reasonable choice.\n\nBut we have to make sure that we are not using any eliminated letters.\n\nLet\'s list the letters we have eliminated: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P\n\nSo for ""FLAKY"": F, L, A, K, Y -> none of these are eliminated. And A is in the 3rd.\n\nSimilarly, for ""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L -> none eliminated, A in 3rd.\n\nBut ""QUAIL"" has Q and U which are less common. ""FLAKY"" has more common letters: F, L, K, Y.\n\n""FLAKY"" uses F, L, K, Y, which are all fairly common.\n\nWe can also consider ""BLUET"": not a word? ""BLUET"" is not standard. ""BLUTE"" has E.\n\nAnother word: ""GAWKY"": G, A, W, K, Y -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd.\n\n""JAZZY"": J, A, Z, Z, Y -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd.\n\nI think ""FLAKY"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let\'s try ""HAVOC"": H, A, V, O, C -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd. C eliminated.\n\n""KAVAS"": K, A, V, A, S -> A in 2nd and 4th? Not 3rd. S eliminated.\n\n""BAWDY"": B, A, W, D, Y -> A in 2nd? Not 3rd.\n\n""DAFT"": not 5 letters.\n\nI found: ""FLAKY"" is a valid word.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""FLAKY"".\n\nBut note: we are testing F, L, K, Y. If we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""QUAIL"" to test Q, U, I, L.\n\nBut I think ""FLAKY"" is more common.\n\nAnother option: ""WACKY"" is not allowed.\n\n""FLAKY"" seems good.\n\nBut let me check if there is a word with O.\n\n""ALGUM"": not common.\n\n""FLAVY""? Not a word.\n\n""FLAKY"" is the best so far.\n\nWe can also consider ""BLAZE"": but E is eliminated.\n\n""GLAZE"": E eliminated.\n\n""BEIGE"": B, E, I, G, E -> E eliminated.\n\nSo I think ""FLAKY"" is a solid second guess.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll guess ""FLAKY"".\n\nBut wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""FLAKY"" is a valid English word.\n\nSo the next guess is ""FLAKY"".\n\nBut note: we are not using any eliminated letters.\n\nSo let\'s go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **A is confirmed in the 3rd position** (✓).\n- **C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P are eliminated** (x).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must have **A in the 3rd position**.\n- Avoid eliminated letters (C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P).\n- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., F, L, K, Y, Q, U, I, L) to maximize information.\n\nI chose **FLAKY** because:\n- It places A in the 3rd position.\n- Tests new common letters: F, L, K, Y.\n- Uses distinct letters to cover more possibilities.\n- Avoids eliminated letters and repeats.\n\n<guess>flaky</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: stamp -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) M(x) P(x)\nGuess 3: flaky -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(-) A(✓) K(x) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: ✓ (correct position, 3rd)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: ""stamp""\n- S: x (not in the word)\n- T: x (not in the word)\n- A: ✓ (correct position, 3rd)\n- M: x (not in the word)\n- P: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 3: ""flaky""\n- F: x (not in the word)\n- L: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- A: ✓ (correct position, 3rd)\n- K: x (not in the word)\n- Y: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, from all feedback, we know:\n\n1. The secret word has the letter L in it, but not in the 2nd position (since in ""flaky"", L was in the 2nd and got a \'-\', meaning it\'s present but not there).\n2. The secret word does not contain: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P, F, K, Y.\n3. A is in the 3rd position and is correct.\n\nThe eliminated letters are: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P, F, K, Y.\n\nAvailable letters: A, B, D, G, H, I, J, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (and L is in the word, but we don\'t know its position yet).\n\nWe also know that L is in the word, but not in the 2nd position. So L could be in position 1, 4, or 5.\n\nThe pattern is: _ _ A _ _\n\nWe need to form a word that has A in the 3rd position, includes L (but not in the 2nd), and uses only the available letters.\n\nLet\'s list possible words:\n\n- We need to fill positions 1, 2, 4, 5 with letters from: A, B, D, G, H, I, J, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, and we know L must be in one of 1,4,5 (but not 2).\n\nBut note: L can be in the word multiple times? The feedback only said L is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears once or more. However, since we only have one L in the guesses, we don\'t know the count.\n\nWe must avoid the eliminated letters.\n\nLet\'s try to think of words that fit the pattern and use the available letters.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""BLAND"": but N is eliminated -> not allowed\n- ""BLAZE"": E eliminated -> not allowed\n- ""BLAST"": S and T eliminated -> not allowed\n- ""BLIMP"": M and P eliminated -> not allowed\n\nWe need to avoid the eliminated letters.\n\nAnother: ""DOULA"": D, O, U, L, A -> but A is in the 5th? Not the 3rd. We need A in the 3rd.\n\nThe pattern is: _ _ A _ _\n\nSo the 3rd is A, so the word must be: [1] [2] A [4] [5]\n\nWe need to choose letters from: A, B, D, G, H, I, J, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, and L must be in one of 1,4,5.\n\nBut L cannot be in position 2, which is already covered.\n\nLet\'s try to find words:\n\n- ""FLAVA""? Not a word.\n- ""FLAKY"" we already tried, and K and Y are eliminated.\n\nWhat about ""GLAZE"": has E -> eliminated.\n\n""QUAFF"": Q, U, A, F, F -> F eliminated, and duplicate F?

We know L is not in the 2nd, but we don\'t know about the 5th.\n\nIn ""QUAIL"", L is in the 5th position. That\'s allowed because we haven\'t tested the 5th position for L.\n\nAnother word: ""QUAIL"" is valid.\n\nBut we have to check if the letters are available: \n- Q: not eliminated -> okay\n- U: not eliminated -> okay\n- A: known in 3rd -> okay\n- I: not tested -> okay\n- L: in the word -> okay, and we are testing it in the 5th.\n\nBut we are using Q and U, which are less common.

It is a word.\n\nBut we have to consider that we are testing three new letters: G, U, V, and the fifth letter is A again.\n\nWe can also consider ""FLAVA"" - not a word.\n\n""QUAIL"" tests Q, U, I, L (and A in 3rd).\n\n""QUAIL"" uses Q and U, which are less common, but I is a common vowel.\n\nAnother word: ""BIJOU"": B, I, J, O, U -> but A not in 3rd.\n\nWe need A in the 3rd.\n\n""BIALY"": B, I, A, L, Y -> but Y eliminated.\n\n""DIARY"": D, I, A, R, Y -> R and Y eliminated.\n\n""FIEST"": F and E and S eliminated.\n\n""GIANT"": G, I, A, N, T -> N and T eliminated.\n\n""GIANT"" has N and T, which are eliminated.\n\n""HOAGY"": H, O, A, G, Y -> Y eliminated.\n\n""HOBBY"": H, O, B, B, Y -> Y eliminated and duplicate B.\n\n""JUMBO"": M eliminated.\n\n""LABIA"": L, A, B, I, A -> A in 2nd and 5th?

""GUAVA"" has two A\'s, so we are testing fewer new letters.\n\nIn ""QUAIL"", we test Q, U, I, L (and A in 3rd, which we know). So we test four new letters: Q, U, I, L.\n\nIn ""GUAVA"", we test G, U, V, and the second A, so we test three new letters: G, U, V.\n\nTherefore, ""QUAIL"" tests more new letters.\n\nBut Q and U are less common, but we have to use them because they are available.\n\nAnother word: ""WAQFS"" -> not.\n\n""JAWAB"": not.\n\n""LAUAN"": not.\n\n""QUAIL"" is a valid option.\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word with O or I.\n\n""QUOIN"": Q, U, O, I, N -> N eliminated and A not in 3rd.\n\n""QUOTA"": Q, U, O, T, A -> T eliminated and A in 5th?

We know L is not in the 2nd, but we don\'t know about the 5th.\n\nAnother word: ""DUVET"": D, U, V, E, T -> E and T eliminated.\n\n""JUVEN"": not a word.\n\n""QUAIL"" is a valid word.\n\nBut let\'s check if there is a word with L in the 1st or 4th.\n\nFor example, with L in the 1st: ""L_ _ A _ _""\n\nBut we need the 3rd to be A, so the word must be: L [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5]\n\nWhat letters for position 2? It cannot be L (because if L is in the 1st, we don\'t know if it can be repeated? But we don\'t know if the word has two L\'s. However, we haven\'t tested L in other positions.\n\nBut we know L is in the word, but we don\'t know the position. So we can try to put L in a new position.\n\nIn ""flaky"", L was in position 2 and got a \'-\', so it\'s not in 2, so we can try position 1, 4, or 5.\n\nIn ""QUAIL"", we put L in position 5.\n\nIn ""GUAVA"", we put L in position 4? \n""GUAVA"": G-U-A-V-A -> position 4 is V, position 5 is A. So L is not in this word? But we know L must be in the word. ""GUAVA"" does not contain L. So it cannot be the word because L is missing.\n\nWe must include L in the guess because we know it\'s in the word.\n\nSo the word must contain L.\n\nTherefore, we cannot use ""GUAVA"" because it doesn\'t have L.\n\nSimilarly, we must use L.\n\nSo back to ""QUAIL"": it has L and A in the 3rd.\n\nAnother word: ""QUILL"": Q, U, I, L, L -> but duplicate L? And the pattern: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:I, 4:L, 5:L -> but we need the 3rd to be A, not I.

Not 3rd.\n\n""ATTAR"": A in 1st? Not 3rd.\n\n""AVAIL"": A in 1st and 3rd? But we need the 3rd to be A, and the 1st is A? But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. However, in ""AVAIL"", the 3rd is A, so that\'s good. But the 1st is A, which we know is in the 3rd, so if we use A in the 1st, we might get feedback on whether there is a second A.\n\nBut we are avoiding eliminated letters: A, V, A, I, L -> A is known, V, I, L are available.\n\nBut we have two A\'s. The pattern is: A V A I L -> so position 1: A, 2: V, 3: A? No, 3 is A? \nA V A I L -> position 1: A, 2: V, 3: A, 4: I, 5: L -> so the 3rd is A, which is good. But we are using A in the 1st and 3rd. We know the 3rd is A, so the 1st A might be another occurrence.\n\nBut we are testing for multiple A\'s.\n\nHowever, we have to avoid eliminated letters: A, V, I, L are available? \n- A: we know is in the word, but we are testing if it appears again.\n- V: not tested -> okay\n- I: not tested -> okay\n- L: in the word, testing it in the 5th position.\n\nBut we are using two A\'s, which might be inefficient for information.\n\nMoreover, ""AVAIL"" has A in the 1st, which we don\'t know about.\n\nBut we are testing the 1st position with A.\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""QUAIL"" which has only one A.\n\nI think ""QUAIL"" is better because it tests more new letters.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we got for ""flaky"": L is in the word but not in the 2nd. So in ""QUAIL"", we are putting L in the 5th. If L is in the 5th, we might get a ✓ or a \'-\'.\n\nSimilarly, in ""QUAIL"", we are putting U in the 2nd and I in the 4th.\n\nWe haven\'t tested U or I.\n\nIn ""AVAIL"", we test V, I, and A in the 1st.\n\nBut ""AVAIL"" has A in the 1st, which we don\'t know about, and we are testing V and I.\n\nBut we are repeating A.\n\nI think ""QUAIL"" is a better choice.\n\nBut we have to consider that the word might have the 3rd letter as A and the 5th as A? But that would be ""AVAIL"", which has A in the 1st and 3rd.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s.\n\nTo maximize information, we should avoid repeating known letters? But we know A is in the 3rd, so if we use A in the 1st, we can test if there is a second A.\n\nBut we have limited guesses, so we might want to test new letters.\n\nSince we have many available letters, we can choose a word that tests more common letters.\n\nCommon letters left: B, D, G, H, I, O, U.\n\nIn ""QUAIL"", we test Q, U, I, L.\n\nIn ""AVAIL"", we test V, I, and the second A (so effectively three tests: V, I, and the A in 1st).\n\nBut ""AVAIL"" has two A\'s, so we are testing two positions for A? But we know A is in the 3rd, so if we get a ✓ for the first A, that means there is an A in the 1st and 3rd? But the 3rd is already known, so if we get ✓ for the first A, then the word has A in 1st and 3rd.\n\nBut we don\'t know if that\'s the case.\n\nWe can also consider ""QUAIL"" to test more new letters.\n\nBut let\'s see the available letters: we have many, but we need to cover them.\n\nAnother word: ""DOULA"" -> D, O, U, L, A -> pattern: 1:D, 2:O, 3:L, 4:U, 5:A -> but we need the 3rd to be A, not L. So not.\n\n""DOULA"" has L in the 3rd? Not A.\n\nI think we have to go with ""QUAIL"" or ""AVAIL"".\n\nBut ""AVAIL"" has the advantage of testing if there is an A in the 1st, but ""QUAIL"" tests more new letters.\n\nSince we have only 6 guesses, and we have 3 left, we can try ""QUAIL"".\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word with O.\n\n""ALGAL"" not.\n\n""ATTAR"" not.\n\n""AVOID"": A in 1st? Not 3rd.\n\n""AVOWS"": A in 1st? Not 3rd.\n\n""BAWDY"": A in 2nd? Not 3rd.\n\nI think ""QUAIL"" is the best.\n\nBut let\'s check the dictionary: ""QUAIL"" is a valid word.\n\n""GUAVA"" is also valid, but has two A\'s.\n\nBut to test more letters, ""QUAIL"" has four new letters: Q, U, I, L.\n\n""GUAVA"" has three: G, U, V, and the second A.\n\nSo ""QUAIL"" tests more letters.\n\nMoreover, in ""QUAIL"", we are putting L in the 5th position. We know L is in the word, and we haven\'t tested the 5th for L.\n\nIn ""AVAIL"", we put A in the 1st and 3rd, and L in the 5th.\n\nBut we know the 3rd is A, so if we put A in the 1st, we might get feedback on whether there is a second A.\n\nBut we are using a known letter A in the 1st, which we don\'t need to test again? We know A is in the 3rd, so if we put A in the 1st, and if it\'s not in the word, we get x, which tells us there is no second A. If we get ✓, then there is a second A in the 1st.\n\nBut we are using a guess to test that.\n\nSimilarly, in ""QUAIL"", we are not testing the 1st position with A.\n\nSo both are possible.\n\nBut I think ""QUAIL"" is better because it tests four new letters without repeating known letters.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""QUAIL"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the pattern: Q-U-A-I-L -> positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:A (known), 4:I, 5:L.\n\nWe are testing:\n- Q in position 1\n- U in position 2\n- I in position 4\n- L in position 5\n\nAnd we know A in position 3 is correct.\n\nSo we\'ll get feedback on Q, U, I, L.\n\nIf L is in the 5th, we might get a ✓ for L, or a \'-\' if it\'s in the word but not 5th.\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nSo I think it\'s a good guess.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""QUAIL"".\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that Q and U are not eliminated. They are not in the eliminated list.\n\nEliminated: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P, F, K, Y.\n\nSo Q and U are available.\n\nI think ""QUAIL"" is the word to guess.\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word with O.\n\n""QUAGO""? Not a word.\n\n""QUAFF"" is not.\n\n""QUAIL"" is the best.\n\nSo I\'ll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **A is confirmed in the 3rd position** (✓).\n- **L is in the word but not in the 2nd position** (-).\n- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P, F, K, Y (all x).\n\nThe secret word pattern is: _ _ A _ _\n\nAvailable letters: A, B, D, G, H, I, J, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (and L must be included).\n\nSince L is in the word but position unknown (not 2nd), it must be in position 1, 4, or 5.\n\nAfter evaluating possible words:\n- **QUAIL** is a valid option that fits the pattern (_ _ A _ _) and includes L in the 5th position (testing if L is there).\n- It tests new common letters: Q, U, I (and L in a new position).\n- Avoids all eliminated letters.\n\n<guess>quail</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: stamp -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) M(x) P(x)\nGuess 3: flaky -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(-) A(✓) K(x) Y(x)\nGuess 4: quail -> FEEDBACK: Q(x) U(x) A(✓) I(x) L(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Incorrect format think\n\n<guess>Incorrect format answer</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: stamp -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) M(x) P(x)\nGuess 3: flaky -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(-) A(✓) K(x) Y(x)\nGuess 4: quail -> FEEDBACK: Q(x) U(x) A(✓) I(x) L(-)\nModel answer is not in the correct format\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(x)
  - A is in the word and in the correct position (3rd).
  - C, R, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""stamp"" → S(x), T(x), A(✓), M(x), P(x)
  - A is still in the 3rd position.
  - S, T, M, P are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""flaky"" → F(x), L(-), A(✓), K(x), Y(x)
  - L is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
  - F, K, Y are not in the word.

Guess 4: ""quail"" → Q(x), U(x), A(✓), I(x), L(-)
  - L is still in the word but not in the 5th position (since it was in the 5th and got '-', so it must be in the word but not there).
  - Q, U, I are not in the word.

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. **A is in the 3rd position** and is correct.
2. **L is in the word** but not in the 2nd, 5th, or now 5th (from ""quail"") positions that we've tried. So L must be in position 1 or 4 (since position 3 is A, so L can't be there).
3. **Eliminated letters**: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P, F, K, Y, Q, U, I. 
   - From the feedback, we have eliminated: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P, F, K, Y, Q, U, I.
   - The remaining available letters are: B, D, G, H, O, V, W, X, Z, and L (which we know is in the word, so we must use it).

But note: L is in the word, so we must include it in the next guess, and it must be in position 1 or 4 (since position 3 is A and we know it's fixed).

Also, we have only 2 positions left for L: 1 or 4.

The pattern is: _ _ A _ _

L must be in position 1 or 4.

We need to form a word that has A in the 3rd, includes L in either position 1 or 4, and uses only the available letters: B, D, G, H, O, V, W, X, Z, and L (but L is already included, so we need to choose from the others).

Available letters for the other positions: B, D, G, H, O, V, W, X, Z.

We have to choose a word that fits the pattern and includes L in position 1 or 4.

Let's consider the two cases:

Case 1: L in position 1 → L _ A _ _
Case 2: L in position 4 → _ _ A L _

We need to find valid English words that fit one of these patterns and use only available letters.

First, let's try Case 1: L in position 1 → L _ A _ _

Possible words:
- ""LAWNS"": but N and S eliminated → not allowed.
- ""LAWns"" has N and S.
- ""LAVAS"": L, A, V, A, S → A in 2nd? Not 3rd. S eliminated.
- ""LAVAS"" has A in 2nd and 4th? Actually: L(1), A(2), V(3)? But we need A in 3rd. So not.
- We need the 3rd to be A, so the word must be: L [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5]

Available letters for position 2: B, D, G, H, O, V, W, X, Z (and L is already used in 1, so we can use another L? But we don't know if L can be repeated. However, we haven't tested L in other positions, so it might be repeated? But we know L is in the word, so if we use L again, we might get feedback on its position.

But we are trying to find the secret word, so we can use L again if necessary.
