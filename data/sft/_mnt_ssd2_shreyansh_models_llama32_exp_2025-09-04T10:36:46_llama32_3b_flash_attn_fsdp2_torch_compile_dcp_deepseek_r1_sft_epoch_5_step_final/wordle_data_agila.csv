We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the third position of ""crane"" and got a '-' meaning wrong position).
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the third position. Also, it does not contain C, R, N, E.

 Since we have only one letter known (A) and it's not in position 3, we need to choose a new word that:
 1. Includes the letter A (because we know it's in the word) but not in the third position.
 2. Avoids the letters C, R, N, E (since they are not in the word).
 3. Tries to cover other common letters to get more information.

 We have 5 positions. Let's denote the positions as 1,2,3,4,5.

 We know A is in the word but not at position 3. So A must be in one of the positions: 1,2,4,5.

 We also need to avoid C, R, N, E.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried yet. Some common consonants: T, S, L, P, M, D, G, B, etc. and vowels: O, I, U (but we already know A is present, so we might want to test other vowels?).

 However, note that we have only one vowel so far (A) and the word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but words usually have vowels.

 We can try a word that has A in a different position and includes other common letters.

 Let's try to form a word that:
 - Has A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
 - Does not contain C, R, N, E.
 - Contains other common letters to maximize information.

 Some good starting letters (besides A) might be: T, S, L, P, M, D, G, B, O, I, etc.

 Example words:
 - If we put A in the first position: words like ""ABOUT"", ""ABOVE"", ""AFTER"", but we must avoid R (in ABOUT: R is present -> but we know R is not in the word) -> so ABOUT is invalid because of R.
   - ""ALOFT"": A in position 1, and letters L, O, F, T. But we don't know about these. However, we must avoid R, C, N, E -> ALOFT doesn't have any of these. So that's a candidate.

 - Alternatively, A in position 2: words like ""PASTA"", but S and T are common. However, PASTA has two A's? But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. Also, we have to avoid R, C, N, E -> PASTA is okay? But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters, but we don't have evidence yet.

 - Another idea: since we know A is in the word and not in position 3, we can try to put A in position 4 or 5 to see if it's there. But we don't know, so we can try a word that has A in a new position and also tests other common letters.

 However, note that we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test more letters.

 Let's list some words that meet the criteria (no C, R, N, E and have A in a position other than 3):

 Options:
 1. ALOFT: A in position 1, and letters L, O, F, T.
 2. ALOUD: A in position 1, but we don't know if D and U are in the word? Also, avoids C,R,N,E.
 3. SALAD: but has two A's? And L and D. But note: we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, S and L are common.
 4. PLAIT: but has I and T, and avoids C,R,N,E. However, A is in position 3? But wait, we know A is not in position 3? Actually, in the first guess, A was in position 3 and got a '-', meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So we can try A in a different position.

 However, note: the feedback for A was in position 3, so we must avoid putting A in position 3 again? Actually, we can put it again? But that would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So we should try a different position.

 Let me think of words with A in position 2: 
   - SALTY: S, A, L, T, Y -> avoids C,R,N,E. But we don't know about S, L, T, Y.
   - PALSY: P, A, L, S, Y -> same.

 But we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Another idea: since we have only one known letter (A) and we know it's not in position 3, we can try to use a word that has A in position 1 and then test other common letters.

 Let me choose ""ALOFT"" because it has A in position 1 and then L, O, F, T which are common and we haven't tested them.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that has A in position 4 or 5 to see if it's there. But we don't have to fix the position of A? We can try a word that has A in a new position and also tests other letters.

 But note: we have 5 positions and we know A is in one of 1,2,4,5. We can try to put A in position 1 in this guess and then if it's not there, we know it must be in 2,4, or 5.

 However, we can also try a word that has A in a position we haven't tried (like 4 or 5) to see if it's there. But that might be less efficient because we are not testing the position 1,2 with A.

 Since we have many letters to test, I think it's better to try A in position 1 and then use other common letters.

 Let me choose ""ALOFT"".

 But wait: what if the word has two A's? We don't know. But ""ALOFT"" has only one A.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have A in position 3 and uses other common letters. Another common starting word that avoids C,R,N,E is ""SPLAT"", but that has A in position 3? We must avoid position 3 for A? Actually, we can put A in position 3 again? But we know it's not there, so it would be a waste of a position. So we should avoid putting A in position 3.

 Therefore, ""SPLAT"" is not good because A is in position 3.

 How about ""PASTA""? 
   - P: new
   - A: in position 2 -> that's a new position for A (previously we had it in position 3, now we try position 2).
   - S: new
   - T: new
   - A: again? But we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we are avoiding C,R,N,E -> PASTA is okay? But note: PASTA has two A's? Actually, PASTA has A at position 2 and 5. But we don't know if the word has two A's. It might be inefficient if the word has only one A.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TALON"", but N is not allowed (we know N is not in the word). So we must avoid N.

 Another word: ""PLAIT"" -> but A is in position 3? We must avoid position 3 for A. So no.

 How about ""AUDIO""? But that has A in position 1 and then U, D, I, O. But we don't know about U, D, I, O. Also, avoids C,R,N,E. But note: we have two vowels? That might be okay.

 However, we already know A is in the word, so we are testing U, D, I, O.

 But we can also try a word that has A in position 2: ""SALAD"" -> but has two A's and also D. But we don't know if the word has two A's.

 After considering, I think ""ALOFT"" is a good candidate because:
   - It has A in position 1 (a new position for A).
   - It introduces L, O, F, T (all common letters).

 Alternatively, we can try ""STAMP"": 
   - S, T, A, M, P -> A is in position 3? We must avoid position 3 for A -> so no.

 How about ""PASTA"": 
   - P, A (position 2), S, T, A (position 5) -> but we are testing A in two positions. If the word has only one A, then one of these will be marked as not present? But the feedback for A: if the word has one A and we put two A's, then one of them (the one in the correct position) will be marked as correct, and the other as absent? But we don't know the position of A.

 However, we know that A is in the word, so at least one of the A's will be marked as present (either '-' or '✓'). But we are trying to get maximum information.

 Since we are limited by the letters we can use (avoiding C,R,N,E), I think ""ALOFT"" is a good choice.

 Let me go with ""ALOFT"".

 So, the next guess: ""ALOFT""

 But note: we are not forced to use A in this guess? Actually, we know A is in the word, so we should use A to get more information about its position. Also, we are required to make a valid 5-letter word.

 Therefore, I choose ""ALOFT"".

<guess>aloft</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, N, E** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** (since it's confirmed in the word) but **not in position 3**.
- Avoid **C, R, N, E** entirely.
- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., **L, O, F, T**) to maximize information.

The word **""ALOFT""** fits these criteria:
- **A** is placed in **position 1** (a new position to test).
- Uses new common letters: **L, O, F, T**.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N, E).

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the third position of ""crane"" and got a '-' meaning wrong position).
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the third position. Also, it does not contain C, R, N, E.

 Since we have only one letter known (A) and it's not in position 3, we need to choose a new word that:
 1. Includes the letter A (because we know it's in the word) but not in the third position.
 2. Avoids the letters C, R, N, E (since they are not in the word).
 3. Tries to cover other common letters to get more information.

 We have 5 positions. Let's denote the positions as 1,2,3,4,5.

 We know A is in the word but not at position 3. So A must be in one of the positions: 1,2,4,5.

 We also need to avoid C, R, N, E.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried yet. Some common consonants: T, S, L, P, M, D, G, B, etc. and vowels: O, I, U (but we already know A is present, so we might want to test other vowels?).

 However, note that we have only one vowel so far (A) and the word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but words usually have vowels.

 We can try a word that has A in a different position and includes other common letters.

 Let's try to form a word that:
 - Has A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
 - Does not contain C, R, N, E.
 - Contains other common letters to maximize information.

 Some good starting letters (besides A) might be: T, S, L, P, M, D, G, B, O, I, etc.

 Example words:
 - If we put A in the first position: words like ""ABOUT"", ""ABOVE"", ""AFTER"", but we must avoid R (in ABOUT: R is present -> but we know R is not in the word) -> so ABOUT is invalid because of R.
   - ""ALOFT"": A in position 1, and letters L, O, F, T. But we don't know about these. However, we must avoid R, C, N, E -> ALOFT doesn't have any of these. So that's a candidate.

 - Alternatively, A in position 2: words like ""PASTA"", but S and T are common. However, PASTA has two A's? But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. Also, we have to avoid R, C, N, E -> PASTA is okay? But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters, but we don't have evidence yet.

 - Another idea: since we know A is in the word and not in position 3, we can try to put A in position 4 or 5 to see if it's there. But we don't know, so we can try a word that has A in a new position and also tests other common letters.

 However, note that we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test more letters.

 Let's list some words that meet the criteria (no C, R, N, E and have A in a position other than 3):

 Options:
 1. ALOFT: A in position 1, and letters L, O, F, T.
 2. ALOUD: A in position 1, but we don't know if D and U are in the word? Also, avoids C,R,N,E.
 3. SALAD: but has two A's? And L and D. But note: we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, S and L are common.
 4. PLAIT: but has I and T, and avoids C,R,N,E. However, A is in position 3? But wait, we know A is not in position 3? Actually, in the first guess, A was in position 3 and got a '-', meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So we can try A in a different position.

 However, note: the feedback for A was in position 3, so we must avoid putting A in position 3 again? Actually, we can put it again? But that would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So we should try a different position.

 Let me think of words with A in position 2: 
   - SALTY: S, A, L, T, Y -> avoids C,R,N,E. But we don't know about S, L, T, Y.
   - PALSY: P, A, L, S, Y -> same.

 But we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Another idea: since we have only one known letter (A) and we know it's not in position 3, we can try to use a word that has A in position 1 and then test other common letters.

 Let me choose ""ALOFT"" because it has A in position 1 and then L, O, F, T which are common and we haven't tested them.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that has A in position 4 or 5 to see if it's there. But we don't have to fix the position of A? We can try a word that has A in a new position and also tests other letters.

 But note: we have 5 positions and we know A is in one of 1,2,4,5. We can try to put A in position 1 in this guess and then if it's not there, we know it must be in 2,4, or 5.

 However, we can also try a word that has A in a position we haven't tried (like 4 or 5) to see if it's there. But that might be less efficient because we are not testing the position 1,2 with A.

 Since we have many letters to test, I think it's better to try A in position 1 and then use other common letters.

 Let me choose ""ALOFT"".

 But wait: what if the word has two A's? We don't know. But ""ALOFT"" has only one A.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have A in position 3 and uses other common letters. Another common starting word that avoids C,R,N,E is ""SPLAT"", but that has A in position 3? We must avoid position 3 for A? Actually, we can put A in position 3 again? But we know it's not there, so it would be a waste of a position. So we should avoid putting A in position 3.

 Therefore, ""SPLAT"" is not good because A is in position 3.

 How about ""PASTA""? 
   - P: new
   - A: in position 2 -> that's a new position for A (previously we had it in position 3, now we try position 2).
   - S: new
   - T: new
   - A: again? But we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we are avoiding C,R,N,E -> PASTA is okay? But note: PASTA has two A's? Actually, PASTA has A at position 2 and 5. But we don't know if the word has two A's. It might be inefficient if the word has only one A.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TALON"", but N is not allowed (we know N is not in the word). So we must avoid N.

 Another word: ""PLAIT"" -> but A is in position 3? We must avoid position 3 for A. So no.

 How about ""AUDIO""? But that has A in position 1 and then U, D, I, O. But we don't know about U, D, I, O. Also, avoids C,R,N,E. But note: we have two vowels? That might be okay.

 However, we already know A is in the word, so we are testing U, D, I, O.

 But we can also try a word that has A in position 2: ""SALAD"" -> but has two A's and also D. But we don't know if the word has two A's.

 After considering, I think ""ALOFT"" is a good candidate because:
   - It has A in position 1 (a new position for A).
   - It introduces L, O, F, T (all common letters).

 Alternatively, we can try ""STAMP"": 
   - S, T, A, M, P -> A is in position 3? We must avoid position 3 for A -> so no.

 How about ""PASTA"": 
   - P, A (position 2), S, T, A (position 5) -> but we are testing A in two positions. If the word has only one A, then one of these will be marked as not present? But the feedback for A: if the word has one A and we put two A's, then one of them (the one in the correct position) will be marked as correct, and the other as absent? But we don't know the position of A.

 However, we know that A is in the word, so at least one of the A's will be marked as present (either '-' or '✓'). But we are trying to get maximum information.

 Since we are limited by the letters we can use (avoiding C,R,N,E), I think ""ALOFT"" is a good choice.

 Let me go with ""ALOFT"".

 So, the next guess: ""ALOFT""

 But note: we are not forced to use A in this guess? Actually, we know A is in the word, so we should use A to get more information about its position. Also, we are required to make a valid 5-letter word.

 Therefore, I choose ""ALOFT"".

<guess>aloft</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, N, E** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** (since it's confirmed in the word) but **not in position 3**.
- Avoid **C, R, N, E** entirely.
- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., **L, O, F, T**) to maximize information.

The word **""ALOFT""** fits these criteria:
- **A** is placed in **position 1** (a new position to test).
- Uses new common letters: **L, O, F, T**.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N, E).

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, but not in position 3)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""aloft""
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is in position 1)
- L: - (in word, but not in position 2)
- O: x (not in word)
- F: x (not in word)
- T: x (not in word)

Now, combining the information:

1. A is in the word and correctly placed in position 1. (from guess 2: A✓)
2. L is in the word but not in position 2. (from guess 2: L-)
3. The following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, E, O, F, T. (all marked x in either guess)

Also, from guess 1, we know A is in the word (and now we know it's in position 1) and that A is not in position 3 (which we already used to avoid putting A there).

Current knowns:
- Position 1: A
- Position 2: Not L (and not any of the excluded letters)
- Position 3: Not A (but we already knew that) and now we know it's not any of the excluded letters.
- Position 4: Unknown
- Position 5: Unknown

Excluded letters: C, R, N, E, O, F, T

We also know the word contains L (somewhere not in position 2) and A (in position 1).

Since A is in position 1, and L is in the word but not in position 2, L could be in positions 3, 4, or 5.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Starts with A (position 1)
- Does not contain: C, R, N, E, O, F, T
- Contains L (but not in position 2)
- And we should try to test other common letters that haven't been tried yet.

Letters we haven't tried: B, D, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we can only use common ones)

We also know that the word must have L in one of positions 3,4,5.

Let's think of words that start with A and have L in them (but not in position 2) and avoid the excluded letters.

Possible positions for L:
- Position 3: then the word would be A _ L _ _
- Position 4: A _ _ L _
- Position 5: A _ _ _ L

We need to fill the remaining positions with letters not excluded.

Common letters to try: S, I, D, U, M, P, etc.

Let's try to form words:

Option 1: L in position 3: A _ L _ _
We need two letters for positions 2,4,5. But note: position 2 cannot be L (but we already know that) and must be a letter not excluded.

Example: A I L D S -> ""AILDS"" is not a word.
A U L S _ -> ""AULAS"" is not common, but ""AULOS"" is a word? But O is excluded. O is excluded so we can't use O.

We must avoid O, F, T, etc.

Try: A I L K S -> ""AILKS"" not a word.
A I L M S -> ""AILMS"" not a word.

Another: A D L E S -> but E is excluded.

We need to avoid E as well.

How about: A I L P S -> ""AILPS"" not a word.

This is difficult. Maybe L in position 4 is better.

Option 2: L in position 4: A _ _ L _
We need letters for positions 2,3,5.

Position 3: we can try a vowel? We have A already, and we know the word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but words usually have vowels. We have A, and we haven't found other vowels yet? We know the word has at least two vowels? Not necessarily, but we know A is present and we have one vowel so far.

We haven't tested I, U, etc.

Try: A I _ L _ 
We need a letter for position 3 and 5.

Example: A I D L S -> ""AIDLS"" not a word.
A I M L S -> ""AIMLS"" not a word.

Another: A U _ L _ 
A U D L S -> ""AUDLS"" not a word.
A U G L S -> ""AUGLS"" not a word.

Option 3: L in position 5: A _ _ _ L
We need letters for positions 2,3,4.

Example: A I _ _ L
A I D O L -> but O is excluded.
A I D L Y -> ""AIDLY"" not a word? ""AIDLY"" is not standard. ""AIDLY"" might be an adverb, but let's stick to common words.

A I M L Y -> ""AIMLY"" not a word.
A I P L Y -> ""AIPLY"" not a word.

Another: A _ _ L _ with L at the end: words like ""APPLE"", but P and L: A P P L E -> E is excluded and also has two P's? But E is excluded.

A _ _ L _ without E: A S S L Y -> ""ASSLY"" not a word.
A S S L _ -> ""ASSLY"" not a word.

How about ""ALIBI""? But I is allowed, and B is allowed. ""ALIBI"": A L I B I -> but wait, L is in position 2? But we know L cannot be in position 2 because in ""aloft"" L was in position 2 and got a '-', meaning it is in the word but not in position 2. So we cannot put L in position 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So we should avoid position 2 for L.

In ""ALIBI"", L is in position 2, which we know is wrong. So we shouldn't use that.

We need a word that has L in position 3,4, or 5 and avoids the excluded letters.

Let me list possible words:

- With L in position 3: A _ L _ _
  - We can have: A I L K S? (not a word)
  - A U L S _ -> ""AULOS"" (music instrument) but O is excluded? O is excluded, so no.
  - A B L E S -> E excluded.
  - A D L I S -> ""ADLIS"" not a word.
  - A G L O S -> O excluded.

This is difficult. Maybe we should try L in position 4.

- With L in position 4: A _ _ L _
  - A I _ L _ : A I D L S -> not a word.
  - A I M L S -> not a word.
  - A U _ L _ : A U D L S -> not a word.
  - A B _ L _ : A B E L S -> E excluded.
  - A S P L Y -> ""ASPLY"" not a word.

Another idea: what about ""APPLE""? But P, P, L, E -> E excluded.

We need to avoid E.

How about ""ALARM""? But R is excluded (from guess1: R x) and M is allowed? ""ALARM"" has R, which is excluded.

Another: ""ABYSS"" but no L? We need L.

We must include L.

Let me think of common words: 
- ""ALBUM""? But B, U, M -> but L is in position 2? We cannot put L in position 2. So no.

- ""ALLY"" is 4 letters. Not 5.

- ""ALLEY"": A L L E Y -> but L is in position 2 (not allowed) and E is excluded.

- ""ALPHA"": A L P H A -> L in position 2? Not allowed.

We need to avoid position 2 for L.

What about ""L"" in position 4? Let me try:

- A _ _ L _
We can have: A D U L M? ""ADULM"" not a word.
A G A L D? But two A's? And G, D. But we don't know if there are two A's? Actually, we only know one A is in position 1. But the word might have two A's? We don't know. However, we can try a word with two A's? But we have to avoid excluded letters.

But we don't have to avoid testing multiple A's? Actually, we can use A again to test if there is a second A? But we have limited guesses, so maybe not.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has L in position 5.

- A _ _ _ L
  - A B S L Y -> ""ABSLY"" not a word.
  - A D O L L Y -> O excluded and L in position 4? Not position 5.

  - A I D L Y -> ""AIDLY"" not a word.
  - A I P L Y -> ""AIPLY"" not a word.
  - A S S L Y -> ""ASSLY"" not a word.

Another common word: ""APPLE"" is out because of E.

What about ""AMPLE""? But M, P, L, E -> E excluded.

We need to avoid E.

Let me think of words starting with A and ending with L? Not common.

Perhaps ""ALGAL"" but no L? We need L.

I recall that ""ALGAE"" has E and also L in position 2? Not allowed.

Another idea: ""ALLY"" is 4 letters.

We might need to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence.

Perhaps we can try a word that has L in position 3? But we couldn't find a common one.

Let me try to list words starting with A and having L in position 3,4, or 5, and using only letters not excluded.

Excluded: C, R, N, E, O, F, T

Available: B, D, G, H, I, J, K, L (but L is already in the word, so we can use it again? But we don't know if the word has two L's. We can use L again to test? But we are trying to get information, so maybe avoid duplicates for now.

But we know L is in the word, so we must include it once (or possibly twice, but we don't know).

Let me try to find words with A in position 1 and L in position 4 or 5.

For example, position 5: A _ _ _ L
Words: 
- ""AISLE"" -> but E is excluded and S, L: A I S L E -> E excluded.
- ""AXLE"" -> E excluded.
- ""ANVIL"" -> N excluded.

Without E: 
- ""A D U L K"" -> not a word.
- ""A B U L Y"" -> ""ABULY"" not a word.
- ""A M U L Y"" -> ""AMULY"" not a word.

Position 4: A _ _ L _
Words:
- ""A D U L T"" -> T excluded.
- ""A G U L A"" -> two A's? And G, U, L. But A is in position 1 and then again? We don't know if there is a second A. Also, ""AGULA"" is not common.
- ""A B U L K"" -> not a word.
- ""A D L L Y"" -> but L in position 3? We are trying L in position 4? ""ADLY"" is not 5 letters.

Wait, we can try L in position 3? But we don't have a good word.

Another idea: perhaps the word has L in position 3? But let's see if we can find a word with L in position 3: A _ L _ _

Words:
- ""A B L E S"" -> E excluded.
- ""A D L I S"" -> ""ADLIS"" not a word.
- ""A G L O S"" -> O excluded.
- ""A I L K S"" -> not a word.
- ""A I L M S"" -> not a word.
- ""A I L V S"" -> not a word.

What about ""ALGAL""? No L.

Perhaps we missed something: we know the word has L, so maybe it's in position 3? But we need a valid word.

Another common word: ""APPLE"" is out.

I recall that ""ALGAE"" is not allowed because of E.

Let me think of words: ""ALBUM"" -> L in position 2? Not allowed.

""ALPHA"" -> L in position 2? Not allowed.

""ALLY"" is 4 letters.

Perhaps we can try a word that has L in position 4: ""AULOS"" but O is excluded.

""AXIOM"" -> no L.

We need to include L.

Another idea: ""AISLE"" is out.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might have L in position 5 and use a word like ""ANVIL"" but N excluded.

We are having trouble. Maybe we should try a different approach.

We know the word starts with A and has L (somewhere not position 2) and does not have: C, R, N, E, O, F, T.

We can try to use a word that has A in position 1 and L in position 5, and then test other common letters for positions 2,3,4.

For example: A _ _ _ L

We can try: A I P P L Y -> ""AIPPLY"" not a word.

A S S L Y -> ""ASSLY"" not a word.

A D U L Y -> ""ADULY"" not a word.

A B U L Y -> ""ABULY"" not a word.

A M U L Y -> ""AMULY"" not a word.

A G U L Y -> ""AGULY"" not a word.

A I D L Y -> ""AIDLY"" not a word.

But ""AIDLY"" is not standard. Let me check: ""AIDLY"" might be accepted? But we need valid words.

Another word: ""ALGAL"" is not 5 letters? ""ALGAL"" is 5 letters? A-L-G-A-L? But that has two A's and two L's? And G. But ""ALGAL"" is a word? It's a genus of algae. But let's see: positions: A(1), L(2), G(3), A(4), L(5). But L is in position 2? We cannot put L in position 2. So invalid.

We must avoid position 2 for L.

What about ""ALGAE""? But E is excluded.

Perhaps we can try ""ALIBI"" but L is in position 2? Not allowed.

I think we need to consider that the word might have L in position 3? But we don't have a word.

Another idea: ""AISLE"" is out.

Perhaps we can try a word that doesn't have L in the first few positions? But we know L is in the word, so we must include it.

Let me think of words: ""APPLE"" is out.

""ANVIL"" is out.

""AXIAL"": A X I A L -> but L is in position 5? And X, I, A, L. But A is in position 1 and then again in position 4? We don't know if there is a second A. Also, ""AXIAL"" is a word. But let's check the letters: A, X, I, A, L. We have A in position 1 and 4? But we know A is in position 1, so if we put A in position 4, it might be present or not.

But we are allowed to use A again? We can, but it might be inefficient.

In ""AXIAL"": 
- Position 1: A (correct, we know)
- Position 2: X (new)
- Position 3: I (new)
- Position 4: A (we don't know if A is here)
- Position 5: L (we know L is in the word, and here it's in position 5)

But we are testing X and I, and also testing if A is in position 4.

But ""AXIAL"" is a valid word.

But we have to avoid excluded letters: X and I are not excluded? Excluded are C,R,N,E,O,F,T. So X and I are allowed.

But let's see: if we use ""AXIAL"", we are testing:
- X: if it's in the word and in position 2? Or if it's present elsewhere?
- I: in position 3
- A: in position 4 (we know A is in the word, but not if it's in position 4)
- L: in position 5 (we know L is in the word, and we are testing if it's in position 5)

But we are not testing position 3? We are testing I in position 3.

Also, we are using A again in position 4. If the word has only one A, then this A will be marked as absent? But we know there is at least one A (in position 1), so if we put A in position 4 and it's not there, we get a '-' for A? But we don't know if there is a second A.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has L in position 3? But we don't have a good one.

Another word: ""ALGAL"" is not allowed because of L in position 2.

Perhaps ""ALGAE"" is out.

I recall that ""ALPHA"" is not allowed.

Let me think of ""ALBUM"": L in position 2? Not allowed.

""ALBUM"" is A L B U M -> L in position 2? Not allowed.

""ALGAM"" -> no L.

Perhaps we can try ""ALGAL"" but L in position 2 and 5? Not position 2.

I think we have to accept that L might be in position 4 or 5.

Let me try to find words with L in position 4: 
- ""A D U L A"" -> not 5 letters? ""ADULA"" is not common.
- ""A U T O L"" -> T and O excluded.

Without excluded letters: ""A B U L K"" -> not a word.
""A D U L M"" -> not a word.
""A G U L A"" -> ""AGULA"" (a spider) -> A G U L A. This is a word? It's accepted in some dictionaries. But let's see: positions: 1:A, 2:G, 3:U, 4:L, 5:A. So L is in position 4.

But we have A in position 5? We know A is in position 1, but we don't know about position 5. Also, we are using A again.

But ""AGULA"" is a valid word? It's a type of spider. But let's see if it's accepted.

Alternatively, ""AEGIS"" -> no L.

Another: ""AISLE"" is out.

Perhaps ""ALGAL"" is 5 letters: A-L-G-A-L -> but L in position 2? Not allowed.

I think we have to use a word that has L in position 5.

Let me try: A _ _ _ L

Words:
- ""A B Y L Y"" -> not a word.
- ""A D I L Y"" -> ""ADILY"" not a word.
- ""A I D L Y"" -> ""AIDLY"" not a word.
- ""A S S L Y"" -> ""ASSLY"" not a word.
- ""A U S L Y"" -> ""AUSLY"" not a word.
- ""A U L T L Y"" -> T excluded.

But ""AULAS"" is not common.

Perhaps ""ALGAL"" is the only one that comes to mind, but L in position 2? Not allowed.

Another word: ""ALPHA"" is not allowed.

I think we have to consider that the word might be ""ALGAL"", but L in position 2 is not allowed.

Perhaps we can try ""ALGAE"" but E is excluded.

Let me think of ""ALIBI"": L in position 2? Not allowed.

I recall that ""ALGAM"" is not a word.

Perhaps ""ALGAL"" is accepted? But let's assume it's not.

Another word: ""ALGAL"" is not standard.

Perhaps we should try a word that has L in position 4: ""AULOS"" is not common and O excluded.

""AXIAL"" is a word: A X I A L -> positions: 1:A, 2:X, 3:I, 4:A, 5:L.

This word:
- Starts with A (position 1 correct)
- Has L in position 5 (which we are testing)
- X and I are new letters.
- A in position 4: if the word has only one A, then this A will be marked as absent? But we know there is at least one A (in position 1), so if we put A in position 4 and it's not there, we get a '-' for A? But we don't know if there is a second A.

But ""AXIAL"" is a valid word. It's a type of axis.

We can use it.

But let's see if there are better words.

Another word: ""ALGAL"" is not allowed.

Perhaps ""ALGAE"" is out.

I think ""AXIAL"" is acceptable.

But we have to avoid excluded letters: it does avoid C,R,N,E,O,F,T.

So let's go with ""AXIAL"".

But in ""AXIAL"", we have:
- Position 1: A (correct, we know)
- Position 2: X (new)
- Position 3: I (new)
- Position 4: A (we are testing if A is also in position 4)
- Position 5: L (we are testing if L is in position 5)

This will give us information about X, I, and also about A in position 4 and L in position 5.

If we get feedback that A is not in position 4, then we know the second A must be in position 2,4, or 5? But position 2 is available, but we know position 2 cannot be L? But it can be A? But we have A in position 1, and if there is no second A, then position 4 cannot be A. But if there is a second A, then it could be in position 4.

But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has L in position 3? But we need a valid word.

Another word: ""ALGAL"" is not allowed.

Perhaps ""ALGAL"" is accepted? But let's assume it's not.

I found: ""ALGAL"" is not standard.

Another word: ""ALGAE"" is out.

Perhaps ""ALIBI"" is not allowed.

I think we have to use ""AXIAL"".

But let's try L in position 3: is there a word? 

""ABYLS"" -> not a word.

""ADILS"" -> not a word.

""AGLET"" -> T excluded.

""ALMUG"" -> no L in position 3? It has L in position 4? A L M U G -> L in position 2? Not allowed.

""ALMUD"" -> not common.

""ALPHA"" -> L in position 2.

I think we have to go with ""AXIAL"".

But let's consider: we know L is in the word, so if we put L in position 5 and it's correct, we get a ✓ for L. If not, then we know L must be in position 3 or 4.

Similarly, we are testing X and I.

So I'll go with ""AXIAL"".

But let's see if there is a better word.

Another word: ""ALGAL"" is not allowed.

Perhaps ""ALGAE"" is out.

I recall that ""ALGAM"" is not a word.

Perhaps ""ALGAL"" is accepted? But let's assume it's not.

Another word: ""ALGAL"" is not standard.

Perhaps we can try ""ALIBI"" but L in position 2.

I think we have to use ""AXIAL"".

But note: in ""AXIAL"", we have A in position 4. We know A is in position 1, but we don't know if there is a second A. If the word has only one A, then the A in position 4 will be marked as absent? But we know there is at least one A, so if we get a 'x' for the A in position 4, then we know there is no second A, and we can focus on other letters.

Similarly, for L in position 5: if it's not there, then L must be in position 3 or 4.

So let's go with ""AXIAL"".

But wait, we have to make sure it's a valid word.

""AXIAL"" is a valid English word.

So I'll guess ""AXIAL"".

But let's see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has L in position 3? But we need a word.

Another word: ""ALGAL"" is not accepted.

Perhaps ""ALGAE"" is out.

I think ""AXIAL"" is the best we can do.

So I'll go with that.

But let's think of other words.

What about ""ABYLS""? Not a word.

""ADILS"" not a word.

""AGLET"" T excluded.

""ALMUD"" not common.

""ALPHA"" L in position 2.

I found: ""ALGAL"" is not standard.

Perhaps ""ALGAM"" is not a word.

Another word: ""ALGAL"" is not accepted.

Perhaps ""ALIBI"" is not allowed.

I think we have to use ""AXIAL"".

So the next guess is ""AXIAL"".

But let's double-check the feedback we have.

We know:
- A in position 1: correct.
- L in the word: not in position 2, so must be in 3,4, or 5.
- We are testing position 5 for L.

Also, we are testing X in position 2 and I in position 3.

If we get feedback that L is not in position 5, then we know L is in position 3 or 4.

And if the A in position 4 is absent, then no second A.

So it's informative.

Therefore, I choose ""AXIAL"".

<guess>axial</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  - **A** is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - **C, R, N, E** are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: aloft** → Feedback: A(✓), L(-), O(x), F(x), T(x)  
  - **A** is correct in position 1 (so the word starts with A).  
  - **L** is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - **O, F, T** are not in the word.  

### Key Insights:
- The word starts with **A** (position 1).  
- **L** is present but not in position 2, so it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.  
- Excluded letters: **C, R, N, E, O, F, T** (cannot appear in the word).  
- We need to test new common letters (e.g., **I, X, S, D, M**) to gather more information.  
- The word must include **L** and avoid excluded letters.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Test **L** in position 5 (since positions 3 and 4 are still possible, but position 5 is untested).  
- Introduce new common letters: **X** (position 2) and **I** (position 3) to maximize information.  
- Avoid repeating known incorrect positions for **L** (position 2).  
- **AXIAL** is a valid 5-letter word that fits:  
  - Starts with **A** (position 1 correct).  
  - Places **L** in position 5 (to test if it belongs there).  
  - Tests **X** in position 2 and **I** in position 3.  
  - Avoids all excluded letters (C, R, N, E, O, F, T).  

If **L** is not in position 5, it must be in position 3 or 4. The feedback for **A** in position 4 will also help rule out a second **A** (if feedback is ""x"" for position 4, it means no second **A**). This guess efficiently narrows possibilities.

<guess>axial</guess>",axial,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, but not in position 3)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""aloft""
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is in position 1)
- L: - (in word, but not in position 2)
- O: x (not in word)
- F: x (not in word)
- T: x (not in word)

Now, combining the information:

1. A is in the word and correctly placed in position 1. (from guess 2: A✓)
2. L is in the word but not in position 2. (from guess 2: L-)
3. The following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, E, O, F, T. (all marked x in either guess)

Also, from guess 1, we know A is in the word (and now we know it's in position 1) and that A is not in position 3 (which we already used to avoid putting A there).

Current knowns:
- Position 1: A
- Position 2: Not L (and not any of the excluded letters)
- Position 3: Not A (but we already knew that) and now we know it's not any of the excluded letters.
- Position 4: Unknown
- Position 5: Unknown

Excluded letters: C, R, N, E, O, F, T

We also know the word contains L (somewhere not in position 2) and A (in position 1).

Since A is in position 1, and L is in the word but not in position 2, L could be in positions 3, 4, or 5.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Starts with A (position 1)
- Does not contain: C, R, N, E, O, F, T
- Contains L (but not in position 2)
- And we should try to test other common letters that haven't been tried yet.

Letters we haven't tried: B, D, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we can only use common ones)

We also know that the word must have L in one of positions 3,4,5.

Let's think of words that start with A and have L in them (but not in position 2) and avoid the excluded letters.

Possible positions for L:
- Position 3: then the word would be A _ L _ _
- Position 4: A _ _ L _
- Position 5: A _ _ _ L

We need to fill the remaining positions with letters not excluded.

Common letters to try: S, I, D, U, M, P, etc.

Let's try to form words:

Option 1: L in position 3: A _ L _ _
We need two letters for positions 2,4,5. But note: position 2 cannot be L (but we already know that) and must be a letter not excluded.

Example: A I L D S -> ""AILDS"" is not a word.
A U L S _ -> ""AULAS"" is not common, but ""AULOS"" is a word? But O is excluded. O is excluded so we can't use O.

We must avoid O, F, T, etc.

Try: A I L K S -> ""AILKS"" not a word.
A I L M S -> ""AILMS"" not a word.

Another: A D L E S -> but E is excluded.

We need to avoid E as well.

How about: A I L P S -> ""AILPS"" not a word.

This is difficult. Maybe L in position 4 is better.

Option 2: L in position 4: A _ _ L _
We need letters for positions 2,3,5.

Position 3: we can try a vowel? We have A already, and we know the word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but words usually have vowels. We have A, and we haven't found other vowels yet? We know the word has at least two vowels? Not necessarily, but we know A is present and we have one vowel so far.

We haven't tested I, U, etc.

Try: A I _ L _ 
We need a letter for position 3 and 5.

Example: A I D L S -> ""AIDLS"" not a word.
A I M L S -> ""AIMLS"" not a word.

Another: A U _ L _ 
A U D L S -> ""AUDLS"" not a word.
A U G L S -> ""AUGLS"" not a word.

Option 3: L in position 5: A _ _ _ L
We need letters for positions 2,3,4.

Example: A I _ _ L
A I D O L -> but O is excluded.
A I D L Y -> ""AIDLY"" not a word? ""AIDLY"" is not standard. ""AIDLY"" might be an adverb, but let's stick to common words.

A I M L Y -> ""AIMLY"" not a word.
A I P L Y -> ""AIPLY"" not a word.

Another: A _ _ L _ with L at the end: words like ""APPLE"", but P and L: A P P L E -> E is excluded and also has two P's? But E is excluded.

A _ _ L _ without E: A S S L Y -> ""ASSLY"" not a word.
A S S L _ -> ""ASSLY"" not a word.

How about ""ALIBI""? But I is allowed, and B is allowed. ""ALIBI"": A L I B I -> but wait, L is in position 2? But we know L cannot be in position 2 because in ""aloft"" L was in position 2 and got a '-', meaning it is in the word but not in position 2. So we cannot put L in position 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So we should avoid position 2 for L.

In ""ALIBI"", L is in position 2, which we know is wrong. So we shouldn't use that.

We need a word that has L in position 3,4, or 5 and avoids the excluded letters.

Let me list possible words:

- With L in position 3: A _ L _ _
  - We can have: A I L K S? (not a word)
  - A U L S _ -> ""AULOS"" (music instrument) but O is excluded? O is excluded, so no.
  - A B L E S -> E excluded.
  - A D L I S -> ""ADLIS"" not a word.
  - A G L O S -> O excluded.

This is difficult. Maybe we should try L in position 4.

- With L in position 4: A _ _ L _
  - A I _ L _ : A I D L S -> not a word.
  - A I M L S -> not a word.
  - A U _ L _ : A U D L S -> not a word.
  - A B _ L _ : A B E L S -> E excluded.
  - A S P L Y -> ""ASPLY"" not a word.

Another idea: what about ""APPLE""? But P, P, L, E -> E excluded.

We need to avoid E.

How about ""ALARM""? But R is excluded (from guess1: R x) and M is allowed? ""ALARM"" has R, which is excluded.

Another: ""ABYSS"" but no L? We need L.

We must include L.

Let me think of common words: 
- ""ALBUM""? But B, U, M -> but L is in position 2? We cannot put L in position 2. So no.

- ""ALLY"" is 4 letters. Not 5.

- ""ALLEY"": A L L E Y -> but L is in position 2 (not allowed) and E is excluded.

- ""ALPHA"": A L P H A -> L in position 2? Not allowed.

We need to avoid position 2 for L.

What about ""L"" in position 4? Let me try:

- A _ _ L _
We can have: A D U L M? ""ADULM"" not a word.
A G A L D? But two A's? And G, D. But we don't know if there are two A's? Actually, we only know one A is in position 1. But the word might have two A's? We don't know. However, we can try a word with two A's? But we have to avoid excluded letters.

But we don't have to avoid testing multiple A's? Actually, we can use A again to test if there is a second A? But we have limited guesses, so maybe not.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has L in position 5.

- A _ _ _ L
  - A B S L Y -> ""ABSLY"" not a word.
  - A D O L L Y -> O excluded and L in position 4? Not position 5.

  - A I D L Y -> ""AIDLY"" not a word.
  - A I P L Y -> ""AIPLY"" not a word.
  - A S S L Y -> ""ASSLY"" not a word.

Another common word: ""APPLE"" is out because of E.

What about ""AMPLE""? But M, P, L, E -> E excluded.

We need to avoid E.

Let me think of words starting with A and ending with L? Not common.

Perhaps ""ALGAL"" but no L? We need L.

I recall that ""ALGAE"" has E and also L in position 2? Not allowed.

Another idea: ""ALLY"" is 4 letters.

We might need to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence.

Perhaps we can try a word that has L in position 3? But we couldn't find a common one.

Let me try to list words starting with A and having L in position 3,4, or 5, and using only letters not excluded.

Excluded: C, R, N, E, O, F, T

Available: B, D, G, H, I, J, K, L (but L is already in the word, so we can use it again? But we don't know if the word has two L's. We can use L again to test? But we are trying to get information, so maybe avoid duplicates for now.

But we know L is in the word, so we must include it once (or possibly twice, but we don't know).

Let me try to find words with A in position 1 and L in position 4 or 5.

For example, position 5: A _ _ _ L
Words: 
- ""AISLE"" -> but E is excluded and S, L: A I S L E -> E excluded.
- ""AXLE"" -> E excluded.
- ""ANVIL"" -> N excluded.

Without E: 
- ""A D U L K"" -> not a word.
- ""A B U L Y"" -> ""ABULY"" not a word.
- ""A M U L Y"" -> ""AMULY"" not a word.

Position 4: A _ _ L _
Words:
- ""A D U L T"" -> T excluded.
- ""A G U L A"" -> two A's? And G, U, L. But A is in position 1 and then again? We don't know if there is a second A. Also, ""AGULA"" is not common.
- ""A B U L K"" -> not a word.
- ""A D L L Y"" -> but L in position 3? We are trying L in position 4? ""ADLY"" is not 5 letters.

Wait, we can try L in position 3? But we don't have a good word.

Another idea: perhaps the word has L in position 3? But let's see if we can find a word with L in position 3: A _ L _ _

Words:
- ""A B L E S"" -> E excluded.
- ""A D L I S"" -> ""ADLIS"" not a word.
- ""A G L O S"" -> O excluded.
- ""A I L K S"" -> not a word.
- ""A I L M S"" -> not a word.
- ""A I L V S"" -> not a word.

What about ""ALGAL""? No L.

Perhaps we missed something: we know the word has L, so maybe it's in position 3? But we need a valid word.

Another common word: ""APPLE"" is out.

I recall that ""ALGAE"" is not allowed because of E.

Let me think of words: ""ALBUM"" -> L in position 2? Not allowed.

""ALPHA"" -> L in position 2? Not allowed.

""ALLY"" is 4 letters.

Perhaps we can try a word that has L in position 4: ""AULOS"" but O is excluded.

""AXIOM"" -> no L.

We need to include L.

Another idea: ""AISLE"" is out.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might have L in position 5 and use a word like ""ANVIL"" but N excluded.

We are having trouble. Maybe we should try a different approach.

We know the word starts with A and has L (somewhere not position 2) and does not have: C, R, N, E, O, F, T.

We can try to use a word that has A in position 1 and L in position 5, and then test other common letters for positions 2,3,4.

For example: A _ _ _ L

We can try: A I P P L Y -> ""AIPPLY"" not a word.

A S S L Y -> ""ASSLY"" not a word.

A D U L Y -> ""ADULY"" not a word.

A B U L Y -> ""ABULY"" not a word.

A M U L Y -> ""AMULY"" not a word.

A G U L Y -> ""AGULY"" not a word.

A I D L Y -> ""AIDLY"" not a word.

But ""AIDLY"" is not standard. Let me check: ""AIDLY"" might be accepted? But we need valid words.

Another word: ""ALGAL"" is not 5 letters? ""ALGAL"" is 5 letters? A-L-G-A-L? But that has two A's and two L's? And G. But ""ALGAL"" is a word? It's a genus of algae. But let's see: positions: A(1), L(2), G(3), A(4), L(5). But L is in position 2? We cannot put L in position 2. So invalid.

We must avoid position 2 for L.

What about ""ALGAE""? But E is excluded.

Perhaps we can try ""ALIBI"" but L is in position 2? Not allowed.

I think we need to consider that the word might have L in position 3? But we don't have a word.

Another idea: ""AISLE"" is out.

Perhaps we can try a word that doesn't have L in the first few positions? But we know L is in the word, so we must include it.

Let me think of words: ""APPLE"" is out.

""ANVIL"" is out.

""AXIAL"": A X I A L -> but L is in position 5? And X, I, A, L. But A is in position 1 and then again in position 4? We don't know if there is a second A. Also, ""AXIAL"" is a word. But let's check the letters: A, X, I, A, L. We have A in position 1 and 4? But we know A is in position 1, so if we put A in position 4, it might be present or not.

But we are allowed to use A again? We can, but it might be inefficient.

In ""AXIAL"": 
- Position 1: A (correct, we know)
- Position 2: X (new)
- Position 3: I (new)
- Position 4: A (we don't know if A is here)
- Position 5: L (we know L is in the word, and here it's in position 5)

But we are testing X and I, and also testing if A is in position 4.

But ""AXIAL"" is a valid word.

But we have to avoid excluded letters: X and I are not excluded? Excluded are C,R,N,E,O,F,T. So X and I are allowed.

But let's see: if we use ""AXIAL"", we are testing:
- X: if it's in the word and in position 2? Or if it's present elsewhere?
- I: in position 3
- A: in position 4 (we know A is in the word, but not if it's in position 4)
- L: in position 5 (we know L is in the word, and we are testing if it's in position 5)

But we are not testing position 3? We are testing I in position 3.

Also, we are using A again in position 4. If the word has only one A, then this A will be marked as absent? But we know there is at least one A (in position 1), so if we put A in position 4 and it's not there, we get a '-' for A? But we don't know if there is a second A.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has L in position 3? But we don't have a good one.

Another word: ""ALGAL"" is not allowed because of L in position 2.

Perhaps ""ALGAE"" is out.

I recall that ""ALPHA"" is not allowed.

Let me think of ""ALBUM"": L in position 2? Not allowed.

""ALBUM"" is A L B U M -> L in position 2? Not allowed.

""ALGAM"" -> no L.

Perhaps we can try ""ALGAL"" but L in position 2 and 5? Not position 2.

I think we have to accept that L might be in position 4 or 5.

Let me try to find words with L in position 4: 
- ""A D U L A"" -> not 5 letters? ""ADULA"" is not common.
- ""A U T O L"" -> T and O excluded.

Without excluded letters: ""A B U L K"" -> not a word.
""A D U L M"" -> not a word.
""A G U L A"" -> ""AGULA"" (a spider) -> A G U L A. This is a word? It's accepted in some dictionaries. But let's see: positions: 1:A, 2:G, 3:U, 4:L, 5:A. So L is in position 4.

But we have A in position 5? We know A is in position 1, but we don't know about position 5. Also, we are using A again.

But ""AGULA"" is a valid word? It's a type of spider. But let's see if it's accepted.

Alternatively, ""AEGIS"" -> no L.

Another: ""AISLE"" is out.

Perhaps ""ALGAL"" is 5 letters: A-L-G-A-L -> but L in position 2? Not allowed.

I think we have to use a word that has L in position 5.

Let me try: A _ _ _ L

Words:
- ""A B Y L Y"" -> not a word.
- ""A D I L Y"" -> ""ADILY"" not a word.
- ""A I D L Y"" -> ""AIDLY"" not a word.
- ""A S S L Y"" -> ""ASSLY"" not a word.
- ""A U S L Y"" -> ""AUSLY"" not a word.
- ""A U L T L Y"" -> T excluded.

But ""AULAS"" is not common.

Perhaps ""ALGAL"" is the only one that comes to mind, but L in position 2? Not allowed.

Another word: ""ALPHA"" is not allowed.

I think we have to consider that the word might be ""ALGAL"", but L in position 2 is not allowed.

Perhaps we can try ""ALGAE"" but E is excluded.

Let me think of ""ALIBI"": L in position 2? Not allowed.

I recall that ""ALGAM"" is not a word.

Perhaps ""ALGAL"" is accepted? But let's assume it's not.

Another word: ""ALGAL"" is not standard.

Perhaps we should try a word that has L in position 4: ""AULOS"" is not common and O excluded.

""AXIAL"" is a word: A X I A L -> positions: 1:A, 2:X, 3:I, 4:A, 5:L.

This word:
- Starts with A (position 1 correct)
- Has L in position 5 (which we are testing)
- X and I are new letters.
- A in position 4: if the word has only one A, then this A will be marked as absent? But we know there is at least one A (in position 1), so if we put A in position 4 and it's not there, we get a '-' for A? But we don't know if there is a second A.

But ""AXIAL"" is a valid word. It's a type of axis.

We can use it.

But let's see if there are better words.

Another word: ""ALGAL"" is not allowed.

Perhaps ""ALGAE"" is out.

I think ""AXIAL"" is acceptable.

But we have to avoid excluded letters: it does avoid C,R,N,E,O,F,T.

So let's go with ""AXIAL"".

But in ""AXIAL"", we have:
- Position 1: A (correct, we know)
- Position 2: X (new)
- Position 3: I (new)
- Position 4: A (we are testing if A is also in position 4)
- Position 5: L (we are testing if L is in position 5)

This will give us information about X, I, and also about A in position 4 and L in position 5.

If we get feedback that A is not in position 4, then we know the second A must be in position 2,4, or 5? But position 2 is available, but we know position 2 cannot be L? But it can be A? But we have A in position 1, and if there is no second A, then position 4 cannot be A. But if there is a second A, then it could be in position 4.

But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has L in position 3? But we need a valid word.

Another word: ""ALGAL"" is not allowed.

Perhaps ""ALGAL"" is accepted? But let's assume it's not.

I found: ""ALGAL"" is not standard.

Another word: ""ALGAE"" is out.

Perhaps ""ALIBI"" is not allowed.

I think we have to use ""AXIAL"".

But let's try L in position 3: is there a word? 

""ABYLS"" -> not a word.

""ADILS"" -> not a word.

""AGLET"" -> T excluded.

""ALMUG"" -> no L in position 3? It has L in position 4? A L M U G -> L in position 2? Not allowed.

""ALMUD"" -> not common.

""ALPHA"" -> L in position 2.

I think we have to go with ""AXIAL"".

But let's consider: we know L is in the word, so if we put L in position 5 and it's correct, we get a ✓ for L. If not, then we know L must be in position 3 or 4.

Similarly, we are testing X and I.

So I'll go with ""AXIAL"".

But let's see if there is a better word.

Another word: ""ALGAL"" is not allowed.

Perhaps ""ALGAE"" is out.

I recall that ""ALGAM"" is not a word.

Perhaps ""ALGAL"" is accepted? But let's assume it's not.

Another word: ""ALGAL"" is not standard.

Perhaps we can try ""ALIBI"" but L in position 2.

I think we have to use ""AXIAL"".

But note: in ""AXIAL"", we have A in position 4. We know A is in position 1, but we don't know if there is a second A. If the word has only one A, then the A in position 4 will be marked as absent? But we know there is at least one A, so if we get a 'x' for the A in position 4, then we know there is no second A, and we can focus on other letters.

Similarly, for L in position 5: if it's not there, then L must be in position 3 or 4.

So let's go with ""AXIAL"".

But wait, we have to make sure it's a valid word.

""AXIAL"" is a valid English word.

So I'll guess ""AXIAL"".

But let's see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has L in position 3? But we need a word.

Another word: ""ALGAL"" is not accepted.

Perhaps ""ALGAE"" is out.

I think ""AXIAL"" is the best we can do.

So I'll go with that.

But let's think of other words.

What about ""ABYLS""? Not a word.

""ADILS"" not a word.

""AGLET"" T excluded.

""ALMUD"" not common.

""ALPHA"" L in position 2.

I found: ""ALGAL"" is not standard.

Perhaps ""ALGAM"" is not a word.

Another word: ""ALGAL"" is not accepted.

Perhaps ""ALIBI"" is not allowed.

I think we have to use ""AXIAL"".

So the next guess is ""AXIAL"".

But let's double-check the feedback we have.

We know:
- A in position 1: correct.
- L in the word: not in position 2, so must be in 3,4, or 5.
- We are testing position 5 for L.

Also, we are testing X in position 2 and I in position 3.

If we get feedback that L is not in position 5, then we know L is in position 3 or 4.

And if the A in position 4 is absent, then no second A.

So it's informative.

Therefore, I choose ""AXIAL"".

<guess>axial</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  - **A** is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - **C, R, N, E** are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: aloft** → Feedback: A(✓), L(-), O(x), F(x), T(x)  
  - **A** is correct in position 1 (so the word starts with A).  
  - **L** is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - **O, F, T** are not in the word.  

### Key Insights:
- The word starts with **A** (position 1).  
- **L** is present but not in position 2, so it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.  
- Excluded letters: **C, R, N, E, O, F, T** (cannot appear in the word).  
- We need to test new common letters (e.g., **I, X, S, D, M**) to gather more information.  
- The word must include **L** and avoid excluded letters.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Test **L** in position 5 (since positions 3 and 4 are still possible, but position 5 is untested).  
- Introduce new common letters: **X** (position 2) and **I** (position 3) to maximize information.  
- Avoid repeating known incorrect positions for **L** (position 2).  
- **AXIAL** is a valid 5-letter word that fits:  
  - Starts with **A** (position 1 correct).  
  - Places **L** in position 5 (to test if it belongs there).  
  - Tests **X** in position 2 and **I** in position 3.  
  - Avoids all excluded letters (C, R, N, E, O, F, T).  

If **L** is not in position 5, it must be in position 3 or 4. The feedback for **A** in position 4 will also help rule out a second **A** (if feedback is ""x"" for position 4, it means no second **A**). This guess efficiently narrows possibilities.",Guess 3: axial -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) X(x) I(✓) A(-) L(-),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the third position of ""crane"" and got a '-' meaning wrong position).
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the third position. Also, it does not contain C, R, N, E.

 Since we have only one letter known (A) and it's not in position 3, we need to choose a new word that:
 1. Includes the letter A (because we know it's in the word) but not in the third position.
 2. Avoids the letters C, R, N, E (since they are not in the word).
 3. Tries to cover other common letters to get more information.

 We have 5 positions. Let's denote the positions as 1,2,3,4,5.

 We know A is in the word but not at position 3. So A must be in one of the positions: 1,2,4,5.

 We also need to avoid C, R, N, E.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried yet. Some common consonants: T, S, L, P, M, D, G, B, etc. and vowels: O, I, U (but we already know A is present, so we might want to test other vowels?).

 However, note that we have only one vowel so far (A) and the word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but words usually have vowels.

 We can try a word that has A in a different position and includes other common letters.

 Let's try to form a word that:
 - Has A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
 - Does not contain C, R, N, E.
 - Contains other common letters to maximize information.

 Some good starting letters (besides A) might be: T, S, L, P, M, D, G, B, O, I, etc.

 Example words:
 - If we put A in the first position: words like ""ABOUT"", ""ABOVE"", ""AFTER"", but we must avoid R (in ABOUT: R is present -> but we know R is not in the word) -> so ABOUT is invalid because of R.
   - ""ALOFT"": A in position 1, and letters L, O, F, T. But we don't know about these. However, we must avoid R, C, N, E -> ALOFT doesn't have any of these. So that's a candidate.

 - Alternatively, A in position 2: words like ""PASTA"", but S and T are common. However, PASTA has two A's? But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. Also, we have to avoid R, C, N, E -> PASTA is okay? But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters, but we don't have evidence yet.

 - Another idea: since we know A is in the word and not in position 3, we can try to put A in position 4 or 5 to see if it's there. But we don't know, so we can try a word that has A in a new position and also tests other common letters.

 However, note that we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test more letters.

 Let's list some words that meet the criteria (no C, R, N, E and have A in a position other than 3):

 Options:
 1. ALOFT: A in position 1, and letters L, O, F, T.
 2. ALOUD: A in position 1, but we don't know if D and U are in the word? Also, avoids C,R,N,E.
 3. SALAD: but has two A's? And L and D. But note: we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, S and L are common.
 4. PLAIT: but has I and T, and avoids C,R,N,E. However, A is in position 3? But wait, we know A is not in position 3? Actually, in the first guess, A was in position 3 and got a '-', meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So we can try A in a different position.

 However, note: the feedback for A was in position 3, so we must avoid putting A in position 3 again? Actually, we can put it again? But that would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So we should try a different position.

 Let me think of words with A in position 2: 
   - SALTY: S, A, L, T, Y -> avoids C,R,N,E. But we don't know about S, L, T, Y.
   - PALSY: P, A, L, S, Y -> same.

 But we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Another idea: since we have only one known letter (A) and we know it's not in position 3, we can try to use a word that has A in position 1 and then test other common letters.

 Let me choose ""ALOFT"" because it has A in position 1 and then L, O, F, T which are common and we haven't tested them.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that has A in position 4 or 5 to see if it's there. But we don't have to fix the position of A? We can try a word that has A in a new position and also tests other letters.

 But note: we have 5 positions and we know A is in one of 1,2,4,5. We can try to put A in position 1 in this guess and then if it's not there, we know it must be in 2,4, or 5.

 However, we can also try a word that has A in a position we haven't tried (like 4 or 5) to see if it's there. But that might be less efficient because we are not testing the position 1,2 with A.

 Since we have many letters to test, I think it's better to try A in position 1 and then use other common letters.

 Let me choose ""ALOFT"".

 But wait: what if the word has two A's? We don't know. But ""ALOFT"" has only one A.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have A in position 3 and uses other common letters. Another common starting word that avoids C,R,N,E is ""SPLAT"", but that has A in position 3? We must avoid position 3 for A? Actually, we can put A in position 3 again? But we know it's not there, so it would be a waste of a position. So we should avoid putting A in position 3.

 Therefore, ""SPLAT"" is not good because A is in position 3.

 How about ""PASTA""? 
   - P: new
   - A: in position 2 -> that's a new position for A (previously we had it in position 3, now we try position 2).
   - S: new
   - T: new
   - A: again? But we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we are avoiding C,R,N,E -> PASTA is okay? But note: PASTA has two A's? Actually, PASTA has A at position 2 and 5. But we don't know if the word has two A's. It might be inefficient if the word has only one A.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TALON"", but N is not allowed (we know N is not in the word). So we must avoid N.

 Another word: ""PLAIT"" -> but A is in position 3? We must avoid position 3 for A. So no.

 How about ""AUDIO""? But that has A in position 1 and then U, D, I, O. But we don't know about U, D, I, O. Also, avoids C,R,N,E. But note: we have two vowels? That might be okay.

 However, we already know A is in the word, so we are testing U, D, I, O.

 But we can also try a word that has A in position 2: ""SALAD"" -> but has two A's and also D. But we don't know if the word has two A's.

 After considering, I think ""ALOFT"" is a good candidate because:
   - It has A in position 1 (a new position for A).
   - It introduces L, O, F, T (all common letters).

 Alternatively, we can try ""STAMP"": 
   - S, T, A, M, P -> A is in position 3? We must avoid position 3 for A -> so no.

 How about ""PASTA"": 
   - P, A (position 2), S, T, A (position 5) -> but we are testing A in two positions. If the word has only one A, then one of these will be marked as not present? But the feedback for A: if the word has one A and we put two A's, then one of them (the one in the correct position) will be marked as correct, and the other as absent? But we don't know the position of A.

 However, we know that A is in the word, so at least one of the A's will be marked as present (either '-' or '✓'). But we are trying to get maximum information.

 Since we are limited by the letters we can use (avoiding C,R,N,E), I think ""ALOFT"" is a good choice.

 Let me go with ""ALOFT"".

 So, the next guess: ""ALOFT""

 But note: we are not forced to use A in this guess? Actually, we know A is in the word, so we should use A to get more information about its position. Also, we are required to make a valid 5-letter word.

 Therefore, I choose ""ALOFT"".

<guess>aloft</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, N, E** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** (since it's confirmed in the word) but **not in position 3**.
- Avoid **C, R, N, E** entirely.
- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., **L, O, F, T**) to maximize information.

The word **""ALOFT""** fits these criteria:
- **A** is placed in **position 1** (a new position to test).
- Uses new common letters: **L, O, F, T**.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N, E).

Guess 2: aloft -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(-) O(x) F(x) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, but not in position 3)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""aloft""
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is in position 1)
- L: - (in word, but not in position 2)
- O: x (not in word)
- F: x (not in word)
- T: x (not in word)

Now, combining the information:

1. A is in the word and correctly placed in position 1. (from guess 2: A✓)
2. L is in the word but not in position 2. (from guess 2: L-)
3. The following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, E, O, F, T. (all marked x in either guess)

Also, from guess 1, we know A is in the word (and now we know it's in position 1) and that A is not in position 3 (which we already used to avoid putting A there).

Current knowns:
- Position 1: A
- Position 2: Not L (and not any of the excluded letters)
- Position 3: Not A (but we already knew that) and now we know it's not any of the excluded letters.
- Position 4: Unknown
- Position 5: Unknown

Excluded letters: C, R, N, E, O, F, T

We also know the word contains L (somewhere not in position 2) and A (in position 1).

Since A is in position 1, and L is in the word but not in position 2, L could be in positions 3, 4, or 5.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Starts with A (position 1)
- Does not contain: C, R, N, E, O, F, T
- Contains L (but not in position 2)
- And we should try to test other common letters that haven't been tried yet.

Letters we haven't tried: B, D, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we can only use common ones)

We also know that the word must have L in one of positions 3,4,5.

Let's think of words that start with A and have L in them (but not in position 2) and avoid the excluded letters.

Possible positions for L:
- Position 3: then the word would be A _ L _ _
- Position 4: A _ _ L _
- Position 5: A _ _ _ L

We need to fill the remaining positions with letters not excluded.

Common letters to try: S, I, D, U, M, P, etc.

Let's try to form words:

Option 1: L in position 3: A _ L _ _
We need two letters for positions 2,4,5. But note: position 2 cannot be L (but we already know that) and must be a letter not excluded.

Example: A I L D S -> ""AILDS"" is not a word.
A U L S _ -> ""AULAS"" is not common, but ""AULOS"" is a word? But O is excluded. O is excluded so we can't use O.

We must avoid O, F, T, etc.

Try: A I L K S -> ""AILKS"" not a word.
A I L M S -> ""AILMS"" not a word.

Another: A D L E S -> but E is excluded.

We need to avoid E as well.

How about: A I L P S -> ""AILPS"" not a word.

This is difficult. Maybe L in position 4 is better.

Option 2: L in position 4: A _ _ L _
We need letters for positions 2,3,5.

Position 3: we can try a vowel? We have A already, and we know the word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but words usually have vowels. We have A, and we haven't found other vowels yet? We know the word has at least two vowels? Not necessarily, but we know A is present and we have one vowel so far.

We haven't tested I, U, etc.

Try: A I _ L _ 
We need a letter for position 3 and 5.

Example: A I D L S -> ""AIDLS"" not a word.
A I M L S -> ""AIMLS"" not a word.

Another: A U _ L _ 
A U D L S -> ""AUDLS"" not a word.
A U G L S -> ""AUGLS"" not a word.

Option 3: L in position 5: A _ _ _ L
We need letters for positions 2,3,4.

Example: A I _ _ L
A I D O L -> but O is excluded.
A I D L Y -> ""AIDLY"" not a word? ""AIDLY"" is not standard. ""AIDLY"" might be an adverb, but let's stick to common words.

A I M L Y -> ""AIMLY"" not a word.
A I P L Y -> ""AIPLY"" not a word.

Another: A _ _ L _ with L at the end: words like ""APPLE"", but P and L: A P P L E -> E is excluded and also has two P's? But E is excluded.

A _ _ L _ without E: A S S L Y -> ""ASSLY"" not a word.
A S S L _ -> ""ASSLY"" not a word.

How about ""ALIBI""? But I is allowed, and B is allowed. ""ALIBI"": A L I B I -> but wait, L is in position 2? But we know L cannot be in position 2 because in ""aloft"" L was in position 2 and got a '-', meaning it is in the word but not in position 2. So we cannot put L in position 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So we should avoid position 2 for L.

In ""ALIBI"", L is in position 2, which we know is wrong. So we shouldn't use that.

We need a word that has L in position 3,4, or 5 and avoids the excluded letters.

Let me list possible words:

- With L in position 3: A _ L _ _
  - We can have: A I L K S? (not a word)
  - A U L S _ -> ""AULOS"" (music instrument) but O is excluded? O is excluded, so no.
  - A B L E S -> E excluded.
  - A D L I S -> ""ADLIS"" not a word.
  - A G L O S -> O excluded.

This is difficult. Maybe we should try L in position 4.

- With L in position 4: A _ _ L _
  - A I _ L _ : A I D L S -> not a word.
  - A I M L S -> not a word.
  - A U _ L _ : A U D L S -> not a word.
  - A B _ L _ : A B E L S -> E excluded.
  - A S P L Y -> ""ASPLY"" not a word.

Another idea: what about ""APPLE""? But P, P, L, E -> E excluded.

We need to avoid E.

How about ""ALARM""? But R is excluded (from guess1: R x) and M is allowed? ""ALARM"" has R, which is excluded.

Another: ""ABYSS"" but no L? We need L.

We must include L.

Let me think of common words: 
- ""ALBUM""? But B, U, M -> but L is in position 2? We cannot put L in position 2. So no.

- ""ALLY"" is 4 letters. Not 5.

- ""ALLEY"": A L L E Y -> but L is in position 2 (not allowed) and E is excluded.

- ""ALPHA"": A L P H A -> L in position 2? Not allowed.

We need to avoid position 2 for L.

What about ""L"" in position 4? Let me try:

- A _ _ L _
We can have: A D U L M? ""ADULM"" not a word.
A G A L D? But two A's? And G, D. But we don't know if there are two A's? Actually, we only know one A is in position 1. But the word might have two A's? We don't know. However, we can try a word with two A's? But we have to avoid excluded letters.

But we don't have to avoid testing multiple A's? Actually, we can use A again to test if there is a second A? But we have limited guesses, so maybe not.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has L in position 5.

- A _ _ _ L
  - A B S L Y -> ""ABSLY"" not a word.
  - A D O L L Y -> O excluded and L in position 4? Not position 5.

  - A I D L Y -> ""AIDLY"" not a word.
  - A I P L Y -> ""AIPLY"" not a word.
  - A S S L Y -> ""ASSLY"" not a word.

Another common word: ""APPLE"" is out because of E.

What about ""AMPLE""? But M, P, L, E -> E excluded.

We need to avoid E.

Let me think of words starting with A and ending with L? Not common.

Perhaps ""ALGAL"" but no L? We need L.

I recall that ""ALGAE"" has E and also L in position 2? Not allowed.

Another idea: ""ALLY"" is 4 letters.

We might need to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence.

Perhaps we can try a word that has L in position 3? But we couldn't find a common one.

Let me try to list words starting with A and having L in position 3,4, or 5, and using only letters not excluded.

Excluded: C, R, N, E, O, F, T

Available: B, D, G, H, I, J, K, L (but L is already in the word, so we can use it again? But we don't know if the word has two L's. We can use L again to test? But we are trying to get information, so maybe avoid duplicates for now.

But we know L is in the word, so we must include it once (or possibly twice, but we don't know).

Let me try to find words with A in position 1 and L in position 4 or 5.

For example, position 5: A _ _ _ L
Words: 
- ""AISLE"" -> but E is excluded and S, L: A I S L E -> E excluded.
- ""AXLE"" -> E excluded.
- ""ANVIL"" -> N excluded.

Without E: 
- ""A D U L K"" -> not a word.
- ""A B U L Y"" -> ""ABULY"" not a word.
- ""A M U L Y"" -> ""AMULY"" not a word.

Position 4: A _ _ L _
Words:
- ""A D U L T"" -> T excluded.
- ""A G U L A"" -> two A's? And G, U, L. But A is in position 1 and then again? We don't know if there is a second A. Also, ""AGULA"" is not common.
- ""A B U L K"" -> not a word.
- ""A D L L Y"" -> but L in position 3? We are trying L in position 4? ""ADLY"" is not 5 letters.

Wait, we can try L in position 3? But we don't have a good word.

Another idea: perhaps the word has L in position 3? But let's see if we can find a word with L in position 3: A _ L _ _

Words:
- ""A B L E S"" -> E excluded.
- ""A D L I S"" -> ""ADLIS"" not a word.
- ""A G L O S"" -> O excluded.
- ""A I L K S"" -> not a word.
- ""A I L M S"" -> not a word.
- ""A I L V S"" -> not a word.

What about ""ALGAL""? No L.

Perhaps we missed something: we know the word has L, so maybe it's in position 3? But we need a valid word.

Another common word: ""APPLE"" is out.

I recall that ""ALGAE"" is not allowed because of E.

Let me think of words: ""ALBUM"" -> L in position 2? Not allowed.

""ALPHA"" -> L in position 2? Not allowed.

""ALLY"" is 4 letters.

Perhaps we can try a word that has L in position 4: ""AULOS"" but O is excluded.

""AXIOM"" -> no L.

We need to include L.

Another idea: ""AISLE"" is out.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might have L in position 5 and use a word like ""ANVIL"" but N excluded.

We are having trouble. Maybe we should try a different approach.

We know the word starts with A and has L (somewhere not position 2) and does not have: C, R, N, E, O, F, T.

We can try to use a word that has A in position 1 and L in position 5, and then test other common letters for positions 2,3,4.

For example: A _ _ _ L

We can try: A I P P L Y -> ""AIPPLY"" not a word.

A S S L Y -> ""ASSLY"" not a word.

A D U L Y -> ""ADULY"" not a word.

A B U L Y -> ""ABULY"" not a word.

A M U L Y -> ""AMULY"" not a word.

A G U L Y -> ""AGULY"" not a word.

A I D L Y -> ""AIDLY"" not a word.

But ""AIDLY"" is not standard. Let me check: ""AIDLY"" might be accepted? But we need valid words.

Another word: ""ALGAL"" is not 5 letters? ""ALGAL"" is 5 letters? A-L-G-A-L? But that has two A's and two L's? And G. But ""ALGAL"" is a word? It's a genus of algae. But let's see: positions: A(1), L(2), G(3), A(4), L(5). But L is in position 2? We cannot put L in position 2. So invalid.

We must avoid position 2 for L.

What about ""ALGAE""? But E is excluded.

Perhaps we can try ""ALIBI"" but L is in position 2? Not allowed.

I think we need to consider that the word might have L in position 3? But we don't have a word.

Another idea: ""AISLE"" is out.

Perhaps we can try a word that doesn't have L in the first few positions? But we know L is in the word, so we must include it.

Let me think of words: ""APPLE"" is out.

""ANVIL"" is out.

""AXIAL"": A X I A L -> but L is in position 5? And X, I, A, L. But A is in position 1 and then again in position 4? We don't know if there is a second A. Also, ""AXIAL"" is a word. But let's check the letters: A, X, I, A, L. We have A in position 1 and 4? But we know A is in position 1, so if we put A in position 4, it might be present or not.

But we are allowed to use A again? We can, but it might be inefficient.

In ""AXIAL"": 
- Position 1: A (correct, we know)
- Position 2: X (new)
- Position 3: I (new)
- Position 4: A (we don't know if A is here)
- Position 5: L (we know L is in the word, and here it's in position 5)

But we are testing X and I, and also testing if A is in position 4.

But ""AXIAL"" is a valid word.

But we have to avoid excluded letters: X and I are not excluded? Excluded are C,R,N,E,O,F,T. So X and I are allowed.

But let's see: if we use ""AXIAL"", we are testing:
- X: if it's in the word and in position 2? Or if it's present elsewhere?
- I: in position 3
- A: in position 4 (we know A is in the word, but not if it's in position 4)
- L: in position 5 (we know L is in the word, and we are testing if it's in position 5)

But we are not testing position 3? We are testing I in position 3.

Also, we are using A again in position 4. If the word has only one A, then this A will be marked as absent? But we know there is at least one A (in position 1), so if we put A in position 4 and it's not there, we get a '-' for A? But we don't know if there is a second A.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has L in position 3? But we don't have a good one.

Another word: ""ALGAL"" is not allowed because of L in position 2.

Perhaps ""ALGAE"" is out.

I recall that ""ALPHA"" is not allowed.

Let me think of ""ALBUM"": L in position 2? Not allowed.

""ALBUM"" is A L B U M -> L in position 2? Not allowed.

""ALGAM"" -> no L.

Perhaps we can try ""ALGAL"" but L in position 2 and 5? Not position 2.

I think we have to accept that L might be in position 4 or 5.

Let me try to find words with L in position 4: 
- ""A D U L A"" -> not 5 letters? ""ADULA"" is not common.
- ""A U T O L"" -> T and O excluded.

Without excluded letters: ""A B U L K"" -> not a word.
""A D U L M"" -> not a word.
""A G U L A"" -> ""AGULA"" (a spider) -> A G U L A. This is a word? It's accepted in some dictionaries. But let's see: positions: 1:A, 2:G, 3:U, 4:L, 5:A. So L is in position 4.

But we have A in position 5? We know A is in position 1, but we don't know about position 5. Also, we are using A again.

But ""AGULA"" is a valid word? It's a type of spider. But let's see if it's accepted.

Alternatively, ""AEGIS"" -> no L.

Another: ""AISLE"" is out.

Perhaps ""ALGAL"" is 5 letters: A-L-G-A-L -> but L in position 2? Not allowed.

I think we have to use a word that has L in position 5.

Let me try: A _ _ _ L

Words:
- ""A B Y L Y"" -> not a word.
- ""A D I L Y"" -> ""ADILY"" not a word.
- ""A I D L Y"" -> ""AIDLY"" not a word.
- ""A S S L Y"" -> ""ASSLY"" not a word.
- ""A U S L Y"" -> ""AUSLY"" not a word.
- ""A U L T L Y"" -> T excluded.

But ""AULAS"" is not common.

Perhaps ""ALGAL"" is the only one that comes to mind, but L in position 2? Not allowed.

Another word: ""ALPHA"" is not allowed.

I think we have to consider that the word might be ""ALGAL"", but L in position 2 is not allowed.

Perhaps we can try ""ALGAE"" but E is excluded.

Let me think of ""ALIBI"": L in position 2? Not allowed.

I recall that ""ALGAM"" is not a word.

Perhaps ""ALGAL"" is accepted? But let's assume it's not.

Another word: ""ALGAL"" is not standard.

Perhaps we should try a word that has L in position 4: ""AULOS"" is not common and O excluded.

""AXIAL"" is a word: A X I A L -> positions: 1:A, 2:X, 3:I, 4:A, 5:L.

This word:
- Starts with A (position 1 correct)
- Has L in position 5 (which we are testing)
- X and I are new letters.
- A in position 4: if the word has only one A, then this A will be marked as absent? But we know there is at least one A (in position 1), so if we put A in position 4 and it's not there, we get a '-' for A? But we don't know if there is a second A.

But ""AXIAL"" is a valid word. It's a type of axis.

We can use it.

But let's see if there are better words.

Another word: ""ALGAL"" is not allowed.

Perhaps ""ALGAE"" is out.

I think ""AXIAL"" is acceptable.

But we have to avoid excluded letters: it does avoid C,R,N,E,O,F,T.

So let's go with ""AXIAL"".

But in ""AXIAL"", we have:
- Position 1: A (correct, we know)
- Position 2: X (new)
- Position 3: I (new)
- Position 4: A (we are testing if A is also in position 4)
- Position 5: L (we are testing if L is in position 5)

This will give us information about X, I, and also about A in position 4 and L in position 5.

If we get feedback that A is not in position 4, then we know the second A must be in position 2,4, or 5? But position 2 is available, but we know position 2 cannot be L? But it can be A? But we have A in position 1, and if there is no second A, then position 4 cannot be A. But if there is a second A, then it could be in position 4.

But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has L in position 3? But we need a valid word.

Another word: ""ALGAL"" is not allowed.

Perhaps ""ALGAL"" is accepted? But let's assume it's not.

I found: ""ALGAL"" is not standard.

Another word: ""ALGAE"" is out.

Perhaps ""ALIBI"" is not allowed.

I think we have to use ""AXIAL"".

But let's try L in position 3: is there a word? 

""ABYLS"" -> not a word.

""ADILS"" -> not a word.

""AGLET"" -> T excluded.

""ALMUG"" -> no L in position 3? It has L in position 4? A L M U G -> L in position 2? Not allowed.

""ALMUD"" -> not common.

""ALPHA"" -> L in position 2.

I think we have to go with ""AXIAL"".

But let's consider: we know L is in the word, so if we put L in position 5 and it's correct, we get a ✓ for L. If not, then we know L must be in position 3 or 4.

Similarly, we are testing X and I.

So I'll go with ""AXIAL"".

But let's see if there is a better word.

Another word: ""ALGAL"" is not allowed.

Perhaps ""ALGAE"" is out.

I recall that ""ALGAM"" is not a word.

Perhaps ""ALGAL"" is accepted? But let's assume it's not.

Another word: ""ALGAL"" is not standard.

Perhaps we can try ""ALIBI"" but L in position 2.

I think we have to use ""AXIAL"".

But note: in ""AXIAL"", we have A in position 4. We know A is in position 1, but we don't know if there is a second A. If the word has only one A, then the A in position 4 will be marked as absent? But we know there is at least one A, so if we get a 'x' for the A in position 4, then we know there is no second A, and we can focus on other letters.

Similarly, for L in position 5: if it's not there, then L must be in position 3 or 4.

So let's go with ""AXIAL"".

But wait, we have to make sure it's a valid word.

""AXIAL"" is a valid English word.

So I'll guess ""AXIAL"".

But let's see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has L in position 3? But we need a word.

Another word: ""ALGAL"" is not accepted.

Perhaps ""ALGAE"" is out.

I think ""AXIAL"" is the best we can do.

So I'll go with that.

But let's think of other words.

What about ""ABYLS""? Not a word.

""ADILS"" not a word.

""AGLET"" T excluded.

""ALMUD"" not common.

""ALPHA"" L in position 2.

I found: ""ALGAL"" is not standard.

Perhaps ""ALGAM"" is not a word.

Another word: ""ALGAL"" is not accepted.

Perhaps ""ALIBI"" is not allowed.

I think we have to use ""AXIAL"".

So the next guess is ""AXIAL"".

But let's double-check the feedback we have.

We know:
- A in position 1: correct.
- L in the word: not in position 2, so must be in 3,4, or 5.
- We are testing position 5 for L.

Also, we are testing X in position 2 and I in position 3.

If we get feedback that L is not in position 5, then we know L is in position 3 or 4.

And if the A in position 4 is absent, then no second A.

So it's informative.

Therefore, I choose ""AXIAL"".

<guess>axial</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  - **A** is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - **C, R, N, E** are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: aloft** → Feedback: A(✓), L(-), O(x), F(x), T(x)  
  - **A** is correct in position 1 (so the word starts with A).  
  - **L** is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - **O, F, T** are not in the word.  

### Key Insights:
- The word starts with **A** (position 1).  
- **L** is present but not in position 2, so it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.  
- Excluded letters: **C, R, N, E, O, F, T** (cannot appear in the word).  
- We need to test new common letters (e.g., **I, X, S, D, M**) to gather more information.  
- The word must include **L** and avoid excluded letters.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Test **L** in position 5 (since positions 3 and 4 are still possible, but position 5 is untested).  
- Introduce new common letters: **X** (position 2) and **I** (position 3) to maximize information.  
- Avoid repeating known incorrect positions for **L** (position 2).  
- **AXIAL** is a valid 5-letter word that fits:  
  - Starts with **A** (position 1 correct).  
  - Places **L** in position 5 (to test if it belongs there).  
  - Tests **X** in position 2 and **I** in position 3.  
  - Avoids all excluded letters (C, R, N, E, O, F, T).  

If **L** is not in position 5, it must be in position 3 or 4. The feedback for **A** in position 4 will also help rule out a second **A** (if feedback is ""x"" for position 4, it means no second **A**). This guess efficiently narrows possibilities.

Includes the letter A (because we know it\'s in the word) but not in the third position.\n 2. Avoids the letters C, R, N, E (since they are not in the word).\n 3. Tries to cover other common letters to get more information.\n\n We have 5 positions. Let\'s denote the positions as 1,2,3,4,5.\n\n We know A is in the word but not at position 3. So A must be in one of the positions: 1,2,4,5.\n\n We also need to avoid C, R, N, E.\n\n Let\'s think of common letters that we haven\'t tried yet. Some common consonants: T, S, L, P, M, D, G, B, etc. and vowels: O, I, U (but we already know A is present, so we might want to test other vowels?).\n\n However, note that we have only one vowel so far (A) and the word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but words usually have vowels.\n\n We can try a word that has A in a different position and includes other common letters.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that:\n - Has A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n - Does not contain C, R, N, E.\n - Contains other common letters to maximize information.\n\n Some good starting letters (besides A) might be: T, S, L, P, M, D, G, B, O, I, etc.\n\n Example words:\n - If we put A in the first position: words like ""ABOUT"", ""ABOVE"", ""AFTER"", but we must avoid R (in ABOUT: R is present -> but we know R is not in the word) -> so ABOUT is invalid because of R.\n   - ""ALOFT"": A in position 1, and letters L, O, F, T. But we don\'t know about these. However, we must avoid R, C, N, E -> ALOFT doesn\'t have any of these. So that\'s a candidate.\n\n - Alternatively, A in position 2: words like ""PASTA"", but S and T are common. However, PASTA has two A\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. Also, we have to avoid R, C, N, E -> PASTA is okay? But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters, but we don\'t have evidence yet.\n\n - Another idea: since we know A is in the word and not in position 3, we can try to put A in position 4 or 5 to see if it\'s there. But we don\'t know, so we can try a word that has A in a new position and also tests other common letters.\n\n However, note that we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test more letters.\n\n Let\'s list some words that meet the criteria (no C, R, N, E and have A in a position other than 3):\n\n Options:\n 1. ALOFT: A in position 1, and letters L, O, F, T.\n 2. ALOUD: A in position 1, but we don\'t know if D and U are in the word? Also, avoids C,R,N,E.\n 3. SALAD: but has two A\'s? And L and D. But note: we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. Also, S and L are common.\n 4. PLAIT: but has I and T, and avoids C,R,N,E. However, A is in position 3? But wait, we know A is not in position 3? Actually, in the first guess, A was in position 3 and got a \'-\', meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So we can try A in a different position.\n\n However, note: the feedback for A was in position 3, so we must avoid putting A in position 3 again? Actually, we can put it again? But that would be inefficient because we know it\'s not there. So we should try a different position.\n\n Let me think of words with A in position 2: \n   - SALTY: S, A, L, T, Y -> avoids C,R,N,E. But we don\'t know about S, L, T, Y.\n   - PALSY: P, A, L, S, Y -> same.\n\n But we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n Another idea: since we have only one known letter (A) and we know it\'s not in position 3, we can try to use a word that has A in position 1 and then test other common letters.\n\n Let me choose ""ALOFT"" because it has A in position 1 and then L, O, F, T which are common and we haven\'t tested them.\n\n Alternatively, we could choose a word that has A in position 4 or 5 to see if it\'s there. But we don\'t have to fix the position of A? We can try a word that has A in a new position and also tests other letters.\n\n But note: we have 5 positions and we know A is in one of 1,2,4,5. We can try to put A in position 1 in this guess and then if it\'s not there, we know it must be in 2,4, or 5.\n\n However, we can also try a word that has A in a position we haven\'t tried (like 4 or 5) to see if it\'s there. But that might be less efficient because we are not testing the position 1,2 with A.\n\n Since we have many letters to test, I think it\'s better to try A in position 1 and then use other common letters.\n\n Let me choose ""ALOFT"".\n\n But wait: what if the word has two A\'s? We don\'t know. But ""ALOFT"" has only one A.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t have A in position 3 and uses other common letters. Another common starting word that avoids C,R,N,E is ""SPLAT"", but that has A in position 3? We must avoid position 3 for A? Actually, we can put A in position 3 again? But we know it\'s not there, so it would be a waste of a position. So we should avoid putting A in position 3.\n\n Therefore, ""SPLAT"" is not good because A is in position 3.\n\n How about ""PASTA""? \n   - P: new\n   - A: in position 2 -> that\'s a new position for A (previously we had it in position 3, now we try position 2).\n   - S: new\n   - T: new\n   - A: again? But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. Also, we are avoiding C,R,N,E -> PASTA is okay? But note: PASTA has two A\'s? Actually, PASTA has A at position 2 and 5. But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. It might be inefficient if the word has only one A.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""TALON"", but N is not allowed (we know N is not in the word). So we must avoid N.\n\n Another word: ""PLAIT"" -> but A is in position 3? We must avoid position 3 for A. So no.\n\n How about ""AUDIO""? But that has A in position 1 and then U, D, I, O. But we don\'t know about U, D, I, O. Also, avoids C,R,N,E. But note: we have two vowels? That might be okay.\n\n However, we already know A is in the word, so we are testing U, D, I, O.\n\n But we can also try a word that has A in position 2: ""SALAD"" -> but has two A\'s and also D. But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s.\n\n After considering, I think ""ALOFT"" is a good candidate because:\n   - It has A in position 1 (a new position for A).\n   - It introduces L, O, F, T (all common letters).\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""STAMP"": \n   - S, T, A, M, P -> A is in position 3? We must avoid position 3 for A -> so no.\n\n How about ""PASTA"": \n   - P, A (position 2), S, T, A (position 5) -> but we are testing A in two positions. If the word has only one A, then one of these will be marked as not present? But the feedback for A: if the word has one A and we put two A\'s, then one of them (the one in the correct position) will be marked as correct, and the other as absent? But we don\'t know the position of A.\n\n However, we know that A is in the word, so at least one of the A\'s will be marked as present (either \'-\' or \'✓\'). But we are trying to get maximum information.\n\n Since we are limited by the letters we can use (avoiding C,R,N,E), I think ""ALOFT"" is a good choice.\n\n Let me go with ""ALOFT"".\n\n So, the next guess: ""ALOFT""\n\n But note: we are not forced to use A in this guess? Actually, we know A is in the word, so we should use A to get more information about its position. Also, we are required to make a valid 5-letter word.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""ALOFT"".\n\n<guess>aloft</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C, R, N, E** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **A** (since it\'s confirmed in the word) but **not in position 3**.\n- Avoid **C, R, N, E** entirely.\n- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., **L, O, F, T**) to maximize information.\n\nThe word **""ALOFT""** fits these criteria:\n- **A** is placed in **position 1** (a new position to test).\n- Uses new common letters: **L, O, F, T**.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N, E).\n\n<guess>aloft</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: aloft -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(-) O(x) F(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in word)\n- R: x (not in word)\n- A: - (in word, but not in position 3)\n- N: x (not in word)\n- E: x (not in word)\n\nGuess 2: ""aloft""\n- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is in position 1)\n- L: - (in word, but not in position 2)\n- O: x (not in word)\n- F: x (not in word)\n- T: x (not in word)\n\nNow, combining the information:\n\n1. A is in the word and correctly placed in position 1. (from guess 2: A✓)\n2. L is in the word but not in position 2. (from guess 2: L-)\n3. The following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, E, O, F, T.

But note: position 2 cannot be L (but we already know that) and must be a letter not excluded.\n\nExample: A I L D S -> ""AILDS"" is not a word.\nA U L S _ -> ""AULAS"" is not common, but ""AULOS"" is a word? But O is excluded. O is excluded so we can\'t use O.\n\nWe must avoid O, F, T, etc.\n\nTry: A I L K S -> ""AILKS"" not a word.\nA I L M S -> ""AILMS"" not a word.\n\nAnother: A D L E S -> but E is excluded.\n\nWe need to avoid E as well.\n\nHow about: A I L P S -> ""AILPS"" not a word.\n\nThis is difficult. Maybe L in position 4 is better.\n\nOption 2: L in position 4: A _ _ L _\nWe need letters for positions 2,3,5.\n\nPosition 3: we can try a vowel? We have A already, and we know the word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but words usually have vowels. We have A, and we haven\'t found other vowels yet? We know the word has at least two vowels? Not necessarily, but we know A is present and we have one vowel so far.\n\nWe haven\'t tested I, U, etc.\n\nTry: A I _ L _ \nWe need a letter for position 3 and 5.\n\nExample: A I D L S -> ""AIDLS"" not a word.\nA I M L S -> ""AIMLS"" not a word.\n\nAnother: A U _ L _ \nA U D L S -> ""AUDLS"" not a word.\nA U G L S -> ""AUGLS"" not a word.\n\nOption 3: L in position 5: A _ _ _ L\nWe need letters for positions 2,3,4.\n\nExample: A I _ _ L\nA I D O L -> but O is excluded.\nA I D L Y -> ""AIDLY"" not a word? ""AIDLY"" is not standard. ""AIDLY"" might be an adverb, but let\'s stick to common words.\n\nA I M L Y -> ""AIMLY"" not a word.\nA I P L Y -> ""AIPLY"" not a word.\n\nAnother: A _ _ L _ with L at the end: words like ""APPLE"", but P and L: A P P L E -> E is excluded and also has two P\'s? But E is excluded.\n\nA _ _ L _ without E: A S S L Y -> ""ASSLY"" not a word.\nA S S L _ -> ""ASSLY"" not a word.\n\nHow about ""ALIBI""? But I is allowed, and B is allowed. ""ALIBI"": A L I B I -> but wait, L is in position 2? But we know L cannot be in position 2 because in ""aloft"" L was in position 2 and got a \'-\', meaning it is in the word but not in position 2. So we cannot put L in position 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it\'s not there. So we should avoid position 2 for L.\n\nIn ""ALIBI"", L is in position 2, which we know is wrong. So we shouldn\'t use that.\n\nWe need a word that has L in position 3,4, or 5 and avoids the excluded letters.\n\nLet me list possible words:\n\n- With L in position 3: A _ L _ _\n  - We can have: A I L K S? (not a word)\n  - A U L S _ -> ""AULOS"" (music instrument) but O is excluded? O is excluded, so no.\n  - A B L E S -> E excluded.\n  - A D L I S -> ""ADLIS"" not a word.\n  - A G L O S -> O excluded.\n\nThis is difficult. Maybe we should try L in position 4.\n\n- With L in position 4: A _ _ L _\n  - A I _ L _ : A I D L S -> not a word.\n  - A I M L S -> not a word.\n  - A U _ L _ : A U D L S -> not a word.\n  - A B _ L _ : A B E L S -> E excluded.\n  - A S P L Y -> ""ASPLY"" not a word.\n\nAnother idea: what about ""APPLE""? But P, P, L, E -> E excluded.\n\nWe need to avoid E.\n\nHow about ""ALARM""? But R is excluded (from guess1: R x) and M is allowed? ""ALARM"" has R, which is excluded.\n\nAnother: ""ABYSS"" but no L? We need L.\n\nWe must include L.\n\nLet me think of common words: \n- ""ALBUM""? But B, U, M -> but L is in position 2? We cannot put L in position 2. So no.\n\n- ""ALLY"" is 4 letters. Not 5.\n\n- ""ALLEY"": A L L E Y -> but L is in position 2 (not allowed) and E is excluded.\n\n- ""ALPHA"": A L P H A -> L in position 2? Not allowed.\n\nWe need to avoid position 2 for L.\n\nWhat about ""L"" in position 4? Let me try:\n\n- A _ _ L _\nWe can have: A D U L M? ""ADULM"" not a word.\nA G A L D? But two A\'s? And G, D. But we don\'t know if there are two A\'s? Actually, we only know one A is in position 1. But the word might have two A\'s? We don\'t know. However, we can try a word with two A\'s? But we have to avoid excluded letters.\n\nBut we don\'t have to avoid testing multiple A\'s? Actually, we can use A again to test if there is a second A? But we have limited guesses, so maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has L in position 5.\n\n- A _ _ _ L\n  - A B S L Y -> ""ABSLY"" not a word.\n  - A D O L L Y -> O excluded and L in position 4? Not position 5.\n\n  - A I D L Y -> ""AIDLY"" not a word.\n  - A I P L Y -> ""AIPLY"" not a word.\n  - A S S L Y -> ""ASSLY"" not a word.\n\nAnother common word: ""APPLE"" is out because of E.\n\nWhat about ""AMPLE""? But M, P, L, E -> E excluded.\n\nWe need to avoid E.\n\nLet me think of words starting with A and ending with L? Not common.\n\nPerhaps ""ALGAL"" but no L? We need L.\n\nI recall that ""ALGAE"" has E and also L in position 2? Not allowed.\n\nAnother idea: ""ALLY"" is 4 letters.\n\nWe might need to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have evidence.\n\nPerhaps we can try a word that has L in position 3? But we couldn\'t find a common one.\n\nLet me try to list words starting with A and having L in position 3,4, or 5, and using only letters not excluded.\n\nExcluded: C, R, N, E, O, F, T\n\nAvailable: B, D, G, H, I, J, K, L (but L is already in the word, so we can use it again? But we don\'t know if the word has two L\'s. We can use L again to test? But we are trying to get information, so maybe avoid duplicates for now.\n\nBut we know L is in the word, so we must include it once (or possibly twice, but we don\'t know).\n\nLet me try to find words with A in position 1 and L in position 4 or 5.\n\nFor example, position 5: A _ _ _ L\nWords: \n- ""AISLE"" -> but E is excluded and S, L: A I S L E -> E excluded.\n- ""AXLE"" -> E excluded.\n- ""ANVIL"" -> N excluded.\n\nWithout E: \n- ""A D U L K"" -> not a word.\n- ""A B U L Y"" -> ""ABULY"" not a word.\n- ""A M U L Y"" -> ""AMULY"" not a word.\n\nPosition 4: A _ _ L _\nWords:\n- ""A D U L T"" -> T excluded.\n- ""A G U L A"" -> two A\'s? And G, U, L. But A is in position 1 and then again? We don\'t know if there is a second A. Also, ""AGULA"" is not common.\n- ""A B U L K"" -> not a word.\n- ""A D L L Y"" -> but L in position 3? We are trying L in position 4? ""ADLY"" is not 5 letters.\n\nWait, we can try L in position 3? But we don\'t have a good word.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the word has L in position 3? But let\'s see if we can find a word with L in position 3: A _ L _ _\n\nWords:\n- ""A B L E S"" -> E excluded.\n- ""A D L I S"" -> ""ADLIS"" not a word.\n- ""A G L O S"" -> O excluded.\n- ""A I L K S"" -> not a word.\n- ""A I L M S"" -> not a word.\n- ""A I L V S"" -> not a word.\n\nWhat about ""ALGAL""? No L.\n\nPerhaps we missed something: we know the word has L, so maybe it\'s in position 3? But we need a valid word.\n\nAnother common word: ""APPLE"" is out.\n\nI recall that ""ALGAE"" is not allowed because of E.\n\nLet me think of words: ""ALBUM"" -> L in position 2? Not allowed.\n\n""ALPHA"" -> L in position 2? Not allowed.\n\n""ALLY"" is 4 letters.\n\nPerhaps we can try a word that has L in position 4: ""AULOS"" but O is excluded.\n\n""AXIOM"" -> no L.\n\nWe need to include L.\n\nAnother idea: ""AISLE"" is out.\n\nPerhaps we should consider that the word might have L in position 5 and use a word like ""ANVIL"" but N excluded.\n\nWe are having trouble. Maybe we should try a different approach.\n\nWe know the word starts with A and has L (somewhere not position 2) and does not have: C, R, N, E, O, F, T.\n\nWe can try to use a word that has A in position 1 and L in position 5, and then test other common letters for positions 2,3,4.\n\nFor example: A _ _ _ L\n\nWe can try: A I P P L Y -> ""AIPPLY"" not a word.\n\nA S S L Y -> ""ASSLY"" not a word.\n\nA D U L Y -> ""ADULY"" not a word.\n\nA B U L Y -> ""ABULY"" not a word.\n\nA M U L Y -> ""AMULY"" not a word.\n\nA G U L Y -> ""AGULY"" not a word.\n\nA I D L Y -> ""AIDLY"" not a word.\n\nBut ""AIDLY"" is not standard. Let me check: ""AIDLY"" might be accepted? But we need valid words.\n\nAnother word: ""ALGAL"" is not 5 letters? ""ALGAL"" is 5 letters? A-L-G-A-L? But that has two A\'s and two L\'s? And G. But ""ALGAL"" is a word? It\'s a genus of algae. But let\'s see: positions: A(1), L(2), G(3), A(4), L(5). But L is in position 2? We cannot put L in position 2. So invalid.\n\nWe must avoid position 2 for L.\n\nWhat about ""ALGAE""? But E is excluded.\n\nPerhaps we can try ""ALIBI"" but L is in position 2? Not allowed.\n\nI think we need to consider that the word might have L in position 3? But we don\'t have a word.\n\nAnother idea: ""AISLE"" is out.\n\nPerhaps we can try a word that doesn\'t have L in the first few positions? But we know L is in the word, so we must include it.\n\nLet me think of words: ""APPLE"" is out.\n\n""ANVIL"" is out.\n\n""AXIAL"": A X I A L -> but L is in position 5? And X, I, A, L. But A is in position 1 and then again in position 4? We don\'t know if there is a second A. Also, ""AXIAL"" is a word. But let\'s check the letters: A, X, I, A, L. We have A in position 1 and 4? But we know A is in position 1, so if we put A in position 4, it might be present or not.\n\nBut we are allowed to use A again? We can, but it might be inefficient.\n\nIn ""AXIAL"": \n- Position 1: A (correct, we know)\n- Position 2: X (new)\n- Position 3: I (new)\n- Position 4: A (we don\'t know if A is here)\n- Position 5: L (we know L is in the word, and here it\'s in position 5)\n\nBut we are testing X and I, and also testing if A is in position 4.\n\nBut ""AXIAL"" is a valid word.\n\nBut we have to avoid excluded letters: X and I are not excluded? Excluded are C,R,N,E,O,F,T. So X and I are allowed.\n\nBut let\'s see: if we use ""AXIAL"", we are testing:\n- X: if it\'s in the word and in position 2? Or if it\'s present elsewhere?\n- I: in position 3\n- A: in position 4 (we know A is in the word, but not if it\'s in position 4)\n- L: in position 5 (we know L is in the word, and we are testing if it\'s in position 5)\n\nBut we are not testing position 3? We are testing I in position 3.\n\nAlso, we are using A again in position 4. If the word has only one A, then this A will be marked as absent? But we know there is at least one A (in position 1), so if we put A in position 4 and it\'s not there, we get a \'-\' for A? But we don\'t know if there is a second A.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has L in position 3?

This is a word? It\'s accepted in some dictionaries. But let\'s see: positions: 1:A, 2:G, 3:U, 4:L, 5:A. So L is in position 4.\n\nBut we have A in position 5? We know A is in position 1, but we don\'t know about position 5. Also, we are using A again.\n\nBut ""AGULA"" is a valid word? It\'s a type of spider.

But we don\'t know if there is a second A.\n\nBut ""AXIAL"" is a valid word. It\'s a type of axis.\n\nWe can use it.\n\nBut let\'s see if there are better words.\n\nAnother word: ""ALGAL"" is not allowed.\n\nPerhaps ""ALGAE"" is out.\n\nI think ""AXIAL"" is acceptable.\n\nBut we have to avoid excluded letters: it does avoid C,R,N,E,O,F,T.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""AXIAL"".\n\nBut in ""AXIAL"", we have:\n- Position 1: A (correct, we know)\n- Position 2: X (new)\n- Position 3: I (new)\n- Position 4: A (we are testing if A is also in position 4)\n- Position 5: L (we are testing if L is in position 5)\n\nThis will give us information about X, I, and also about A in position 4 and L in position 5.\n\nIf we get feedback that A is not in position 4, then we know the second A must be in position 2,4, or 5?

But if there is a second A, then it could be in position 4.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has L in position 3? But we need a valid word.\n\nAnother word: ""ALGAL"" is not allowed.\n\nPerhaps ""ALGAL"" is accepted? But let\'s assume it\'s not.\n\nI found: ""ALGAL"" is not standard.\n\nAnother word: ""ALGAE"" is out.\n\nPerhaps ""ALIBI"" is not allowed.\n\nI think we have to use ""AXIAL"".\n\nBut let\'s try L in position 3: is there a word? \n\n""ABYLS"" -> not a word.\n\n""ADILS"" -> not a word.\n\n""AGLET"" -> T excluded.\n\n""ALMUG"" -> no L in position 3?

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, but not in position 3)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""aloft""
- A: ✓ (correct, position 1)
- L: - (in word, but not in position 2)
- O: x (not in word)
- F: x (not in word)
- T: x (not in word)

Guess 3: ""axial""
- A: ✓ (correct, position 1)
- X: x (not in word)
- I: ✓ (correct, position 3)
- A: - (in word, but not in position 4)
- L: - (in word, but not in position 5)

Now, combining all:

1. Correct positions:
   - Position 1: A (from guess 2 and 3)
   - Position 3: I (from guess 3)

2. Letters in the word but wrong positions:
   - A: known to be in word, but not in position 3 (from guess 1) and not in position 4 (from guess 3). So A must be in position 2 or 5? Because position 1 is A and position 3 is I, so A can only be in position 2 or 5.
   - L: known to be in word, but not in position 2 (guess 2) and not in position 5 (guess 3). So L must be in position 4 (since position 1 is A, position 3 is I, so positions 2,4,5 are open, but 2 and 5 are ruled out for L). Wait, position 2: L was tried and not there, so L cannot be in position 2. Position 5: L was tried and not there (in ""axial"", L was in position 5 and got '-', so not there). Therefore, L must be in position 4? Because position 1 is taken by A, position 3 by I, so L must be in position 4.

   But let's confirm: positions are 1,2,3,4,5.
   - Position 1: A (fixed)
   - Position 3: I (fixed)
   - L cannot be in position 2 (from ""aloft"") and cannot be in position 5 (from ""axial""). So the only position left for L is position 4.

   Therefore, L must be in position 4.

3. Excluded letters: from all guesses, we have:
   - Excluded: C, R, N, E, O, F, T, X (from guess 3: X is not in the word)
   - Also, from ""crane"": C, R, N, E are excluded.
   - From ""aloft"": O, F, T excluded.
   - From ""axial"": X excluded.

   So excluded: C, R, N, E, O, F, T, X.

4. We know the word has A (position 1), I (position 3), L (position 4), and one more letter? We have positions 2 and 5 to fill.

   Also, we know that A is in the word and must be in position 2 or 5 (since not 3 or 4). And L is in position 4.

   So the word so far: A _ I L _

   And A must be in position 2 or 5.

   Also, we have to find the remaining letter for position 2 and 5, and it must not be excluded.

   Available letters: all letters except excluded: C,R,N,E,O,F,T,X.

   But we also know that the word must be a valid English word.

5. We have not tested many letters. We have tested: C,R,A,N,E,O,F,T,L (from ""crane"", ""aloft"", ""axial""), and I is in the word (from ""axial"").

   Tested letters: A, C, R, N, E, O, F, T, L, X, I.

   Available common letters: B, D, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, Y, Z.

   We need to form a word: A _ I L _

   With A in position 2 or 5.

   Let's consider the two cases:

   Case 1: A in position 2 -> word: A A I L _
        Position 2: A (but we are putting A there, which is position 2)
        Position 5: some letter.

   Case 2: A in position 5 -> word: A _ I L A
        Position 2: some letter
        Position 5: A

   We need to find valid words.

   First, try Case 1: A in position 2 -> A A I L _
        We need a letter for position 5 that makes a valid word. And position 2 is A.

        Words: 
          - ""ABILY"" -> not a word? ""ABILY"" is not standard.
          - ""ADILY"" -> not a word.
          - ""AGILY"" -> not a word.
          - ""AHILY"" -> not a word.
          - ""AKILY"" -> not a word.
          - ""ALILY"" -> not a word.
          - ""AMILY"" -> ""AMILY"" is a name? Not common.
          - ""ANILY"" -> N excluded.
          - ""A PILS"" -> ""A P I L S"" -> ""APILS"" is not a word? But ""APIS"" is 4 letters. ""APILS"" is not standard.
          - ""A V I L S"" -> ""AVILS"" is not a word.

        This doesn't work.

    Case 2: A in position 5: A _ I L A
        We need a letter for position 2.

        Words: 
          - ""A D I L A"" -> ""ADILA"" not a word.
          - ""A G I L A"" -> ""AGILA"" (a type of deer) -> valid? It's a word.
          - ""A H I L A"" -> not a word.
          - ""A K I L A"" -> not a word.
          - ""A M I L A"" -> ""AMILA"" (a type of tree) -> valid.
          - ""A P I L A"" -> ""APILA"" not a word.
          - ""A S I L A"" -> ""ASILA"" not a word.
          - ""A U I L A"" -> ""U I L A"" -> ""AUILA"" not a word.
          - ""A B I L A"" -> ""BILAA"" not a word.
          - ""A B I L S"" -> ""ABILS"" is not a word? ""ABIS"" is 4 letters.
          - ""A D I L S"" -> ""ADILS"" not a word.
          - ""A G I L S"" -> ""AGILS"" not a word.
          - ""A H I L S"" -> ""AHILS"" not a word.
          - ""A K I L S"" -> ""AKILS"" not a word.
          - ""A M I L S"" -> ""AMILS"" not a word.
          - ""A P I L S"" -> ""APILS"" not a word.
          - ""A S I L S"" -> ""ASILS"" not a word.
          - ""A U I L S"" -> ""AUILS"" not a word.

        But ""AGILA"" and ""AMILA"" are words? Let me check: 
          - ""AGILA"": a genus of deer (agile deer). 
          - ""AMILA"": a type of tree (milpa). 
        They are accepted in some dictionaries.

        But note: in ""AGILA"", the last letter is A, so it would be A G I L A -> positions: 1:A, 2:G, 3:I, 4:L, 5:A. 
        But we have position 5 as A? But we know A is in position 1, and we are putting A in position 5? That would be two A's? But we don't know if the word has two A's.

        Similarly, ""AMILA"": A M I L A.

        But we have to avoid excluded letters: G and M are not excluded.

        However, we have to check if these words are valid.

        But we also have to consider that we haven't tested G or M.

        Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 5 and a new letter in position 2.

        But we need to confirm if there is a second A.

        However, we have another constraint: in ""axial"", we had A in position 4 and got a '-', meaning A is in the word but not in position 4. So if we put A in position 5, that might be correct.

        But we don't know if the word has two A's.

        We can try ""AGILA"" or ""AMILA"", but they are not common.

        Are there more common words?

        What about ""AILA""? But that's 4 letters.

        ""AALIA"" -> not a word.

        ""AALIY"" -> not a word.

        ""AQUIL"" -> but Q and U: ""AQUIL"" is 5 letters? A Q U I L -> but L is in position 5? And position 4 is I? But we have position 4 as L? No, in ""AQUIL"": A(1), Q(2), U(3), I(4), L(5) -> but we need position 3 to be I, but here position 3 is U. So not.

        We need position 3 to be I.

        So the word must be: A ? I L ?

        With ? being letters not excluded.

        And A in position 5: so word: A ? I L A

        Now, what letters can we use? We have available: B, D, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, Y, Z.

        Common words: 
          - ""AGILE"" -> but E is excluded.
          - ""AMIGO"" -> O excluded.
          - ""ALIBI"" -> L in position 2? Not allowed.

        How about ""AMINA""? But N excluded.

        ""ABACI"" -> C excluded.

        ""ADILI"" -> D and I: but I is already in position 3, and we are putting I in position 3? ""ADILI"" has I in position 3? A D I L I -> but that would be A(1), D(2), I(3), L(4), I(5). But we have two I's? And we know I is in position 3, but we don't know if there is another I. Also, D is allowed.

        But ""ADILI"" is not a word? It might be a word? ""Adili"" is not standard.

        ""AEGIS"" -> no L.

        ""ALGAL"" -> L in position 2? Not allowed.

        ""ALGAE"" -> E excluded.

        ""ALPHA"" -> L in position 2.

        I think we are stuck with words like ""AGILA"" or ""AMILA"".

        But let's consider the other case: A in position 2.

        For A in position 2: A A I L ?

        We need a letter for position 5 and position 2? Position 2 is A, position 5 is something.

        Word: A A I L ?

        Examples: 
          - ""A A I L S"" -> ""AAILS"" not a word.
          - ""A A I L D"" -> ""AAILED"" too long.
          - ""A A I L K"" -> ""AAIK"" not a word.

        Not finding common words.

        Perhaps we missed that A might be in position 5.

        Let me list all possible words that start with A, have I in position 3, L in position 4, and end with A? Or have a letter in position 2 and 5.

        We know position 4 is L.

        So the word is: A [letter] I L [letter]

        And the letters must not be excluded.

        Available letters: B, D, G, H, J, K, M, P, S, U, V, W, Y, Z.

        And we know A is in the word, so one of the positions (2 or 5) must be A.

        Now, if we put A in position 5: then the word is A ? I L A

        Then we need a letter for position 2.

        Words: 
          - ""A G I L A"" -> ""AGILA"" (if we accept it, which it is a word)
          - ""A M I L A"" -> ""AMILA""
          - ""A B I L A"" -> not a word.
          - ""A D I L A"" -> not a word.
          - ""A H I L A"" -> not a word.
          - ""A K I L A"" -> not a word.
          - ""A P I L A"" -> not a word.
          - ""A S I L A"" -> not a word.
          - ""A U I L A"" -> ""AUILA"" not a word.

        So the only common words are ""AGILA"" and ""AMILA"".

        But we haven't tested G or M.

        We can try one of these.

        But we have to choose one.

        Alternatively, if we put A in position 2: A A I L ?

        We need a letter for position 5. What words? 
          - ""A A I L S"" -> not a word.
          - ""A A I L D"" -> ""AAILED"" is 6 letters.
          - ""A A I L K"" -> not a word.
          - ""A A I L Y"" -> ""AAILY"" not a word.

        Not found.

        Another idea: what if the word has duplicate letters? For example, two A's? But we don't have evidence.

        We know A is in position 1, and if we put A in position 2, that would be a duplicate.

        But we don't have a word for ""A A I L ?"".

        Perhaps ""A A I L S"" is not a word, but ""A A I L D"" is not 5 letters.

        I think we have to go with ""AGILA"" or ""AMILA"".

        But let's see if there is a word with a different letter in position 2.

        What about ""A B I L A""? Not a word.

        ""A D I L A""? No.

        ""A G I L A""? Yes, ""AGILA"".

        ""A M I L A""? ""AMILA"".

        Also, ""A P I L A""? No.

        ""A S I L A""? No.

        ""A U I L A""? No.

        So the only possibilities are ""AGILA"" and ""AMILA"".

        Now, we can choose one. Let's pick ""AGILA"" because G is more common than M? Or we can choose based on frequency.

        But we have to consider that we have not tested G or M.

        We can also consider that in ""AGILA"", we have G in position 2, and A in position 5. We know A is in position 1, so if we put A in position 5, it might be correct.

        Similarly, for ""AMILA"": M in position 2, A in position 5.

        But we don't know if the word has two A's.

        Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't assume A in position 5, but tests position 2.

        But we don't have a word for A in position 2.

        Another word: ""A B I L S"" is not a word.

        ""A D I L S"" not a word.

        ""A G I L S"" not a word.

        ""A M I L S"" not a word.

        ""A P I L S"" not a word.

        ""A S I L S"" not a word.

        ""A U I L S"" not a word.

        So the only options are ""AGILA"" and ""AMILA"".

        We can also consider ""A K I L S"" -> not a word.

        ""A V I L S"" -> not a word.

        ""A W I L S"" -> not a word.

        ""A Y I L S"" -> not a word.

        ""A Z I L S"" -> not a word.

        So only ""AGILA"" and ""AMILA"".

        Now, let's see if there is a word with A in position 5 and a different letter in position 2.

        We have ""AGILA"" (G in position 2) and ""AMILA"" (M in position 2).

        We can also consider ""AILA"" is 4 letters.

        Another word: ""A L I A L"" -> but L is in position 2? Not allowed, and also we have L in position 4? Conflict.

        We know L is in position 4, so we cannot have L in position 2.

        So back to ""AGILA"" or ""AMILA"".

        We can try ""AGILA"".

        But note: in ""AGILA"", we have:
          - Position 1: A (correct)
          - Position 2: G (new)
          - Position 3: I (correct)
          - Position 4: L (we know it must be L, so if it's correct, good)
          - Position 5: A (we are testing if A is in position 5)

        If the word is ""AGILA"", then position 5 is A, and we get a ✓ for A in position 5? But we don't know if it's correct.

        Similarly, if we try ""AMILA"", same thing.

        But we have to choose one.

        Alternatively, we can try a word that tests multiple possibilities.

        We know A must be in position 2 or 5. We can try a word that has A in position 2 and then if it's not, we know it's in position 5.

        But we don't have a word for A in position 2.

        We can try a word that has A in position 5 and a different letter in position 2.

        But we have to use one of the ""AMILA"" words.

        Or we can try a word that doesn't have A in position 5, but we have to include L in position 4.

        But we know L must be in position 4, so we have to put L there.

        So we are forced to put A in position 5 in this guess.

        Therefore, we choose ""AGILA"" to test.

        If ""AGILA"" is not the word, then we know it must be ""AMILA"" or another word? But what other words? We have only these two.

        But there might be others? Let me think.

        What about ""A B I L A""? Not a word.

        ""A D I L A"" -> not a word.

        ""A G I L A"" -> yes, ""AGILA""

        ""A M I L A"" -> ""AMILA""

        ""A P I L A"" -> not a word.

        ""A S I L A"" -> not a word.

        ""A U I L A"" -> not a word.

        ""A V I L A"" -> not a word.

        ""A W I L A"" -> not a word.

        ""A Y I L A"" -> not a word.

        ""A Z I L A"" -> not a word.

        So only two possibilities: ""AGILA"" and ""AMILA"".

        We can try ""AGILA"".

        If it's not, then we try ""AMILA"" next.

        But we have two guesses left? We have 6 tries, so we have 3 more? Let's see: we are on guess 4, so we have 3 more after this.

        But we can try to get more information.

        Alternatively, we can try a word that tests the position 2 letter and also tests for A in position 5, but without committing to A in position 5.

        For example, we can try a word that has A in position 5, but also includes other letters to test.

        But we have to have L in position 4.

        So the word must be A ? I L A.

        We can try ""AGILA"".

        If we are wrong, we know it's ""AMILA"".

        But we can also try to test more letters.

        We have to fill position 2 and 5.

        Position 2: we can try a common letter like S, D, G, M, etc.

        In ""AGILA"", we are trying G in position 2 and A in position 5.

        But we know A is in position 1, so if A is in position 5, it's a duplicate.

        We can also try ""AMILA"" to test M.

        But let's see if there is a word that doesn't have A in position 5? For example, if we put a different letter in position 5 and A in position 2.

        But we don't have a word for A in position 2.

        Another idea: what if the word is ""AILA"" with a suffix? But it's 4 letters.

        Or ""AILU"" -> not.

        I think we have to go with ""AGILA"" or ""AMILA"".

        Let me check if there is ""A I L"" with a letter in between and A at the end? But we have position 4 as L, so it's A ? I L A.

        Words: 
          - ""AGILA"" (if we accept it) -> G in position 2, A in position 5.
          - ""AMILA"" -> M in position 2, A in position 5.

        But ""AGILA"" is a word? It's in some dictionaries. Similarly, ""AMILA"" is also accepted.

        We can also consider ""A B I L A"" but not a word.

        Or ""A D I L A"" not a word.

        So I think we have to choose between ""AGILA"" and ""AMILA"".

        Let's pick ""AGILA"" as the next guess.

        If it's not, then we know it's ""AMILA"".

        But we have two more guesses after this.

        Alternatively, we can try to test more letters.

        We have not tested: B, D, G, H, K, M, P, S, U, V, W, Y, Z.

        In ""AGILA"", we are testing G and A in position 5.

        If we get feedback that A is correct in position 5, then we know it's ""AGILA"". If not, then it must be ""AMILA"".

        But we can also try a word that has A in position 5, but with a different letter in position 2, to test multiple options.

        For example, we can try ""AGILE"" but E is excluded.

        ""AGILE"" has E, which is excluded.

        ""AGLOW"" -> O and W? But O is excluded.

        ""AGREE"" -> E excluded.

        ""AGONE"" -> O and E excluded.

        ""AGAPE"" -> E excluded.

        ""AGAMA"" -> A G A M A -> but we have A in position 1 and 5? And I is in position 3? But ""AGAMA"": A(1), G(2), A(3), M(4), A(5) -> but position 3 is A, but we have I in position 3? Conflict. We know position 3 is I.

        So we cannot change position 3.

        Position 3 is fixed as I.

        So the word must be A ? I L ?

        And we have to fill the ? with letters not excluded.

        So the only options are letters that can form a word with A in position 5 and L in position 4.

        Therefore, we must guess one of ""AGILA"" or ""AMILA"".

        Let me choose ""AGILA"".

        So the next guess is ""AGILA"".

        If it's not, then we know it's ""AMILA"".

        But we have two more guesses, so it's acceptable.

        Alternatively, we can try a word that tests the duplicate A possibility without committing to position 5.

        For example, we can try a word that has A in position 2 (if we believe in duplicate A) and also tests other letters.

        But we don't have a word for A in position 2.

        We can try to put A in position 5 and test a new letter in position 2.

        But we have to use one of the two words.

        I think ""AGILA"" is a reasonable guess.

        So let's go with ""AGILA"".

        But note: in ""AGILA"", we have:
          - Position 1: A (correct)
          - Position 2: G (new)
          - Position 3: I (correct)
          - Position 4: L (we know it must be L, so if correct, good)
          - Position 5: A (we are testing)

        If the feedback shows:
          - If G is correct, then it's ""AGILA"".
          - If G is wrong, then it must be ""AMILA"", and we can try that next.

        But we can also get information about G.

        If G is not in the word, then we know it's ""AMILA"".

        Similarly, if A in position 5 is correct, then we know it's ""AGILA"" or ""AMILA"", but if it's not, then it must be ""AMILA"".

        But if A in position 5 is not correct, then we know A must be in position 2 (if duplicate A) or we have an error.

        But if A in position 5 is not correct, then we know A is in position 2, and the word is ""AMILA"".

        So the guess ""AGILA"" will tell us:

          - If A in position 5 is correct: then it's ""AGILA"" if G is also correct, or if A is correct but G wrong, then it might be ""AMILA"" but we don't know position 2.

          - If A in position 5 is not correct, then it must be ""AMILA"" (since A must be in position 2 if not 5, but we don't know duplicate A).

        But if A in position 5 is not correct, then we know A is in position 2, and the word is ""AMILA"", because if A is in position 2, then in ""AGILA"", A in position 5 would be wrong, and G in position 2: if G is not in the word, then it's ""AMILA"".

        So:

          - If feedback: A(✓) and G(✓) then word is ""AGILA"".
          - If feedback: A(✓) and G(x) then word is ""AMILA"" (because A must be in position 2, and G not in word, so ""AMILA"").
          - If feedback: A(x) then that would be a contradiction because we know A is in the word. But if A is not in position 5, and we put A in position 5, if it's not correct, then we know A must be in position 2, and the word must be ""AMILA"" (since ""AGILA"" would require G which is not present if A is not in 5).

        So:

          - If A is correct in position 5: then it's ""AGILA"" if G is also correct, or if A is correct but G is wrong, then it might be ""AMILA"" (but then A is in position 5, and G is not in the word, so ""AMILA"").

          - If A is not correct in position 5, then it must be ""AMILA"" (because A must be in position 2, and G is not in the word, so ""AMILA"").

        So by guessing ""AGILA"", we can distinguish:

          - If A is ✓ in position 5 and G is ✓, then word is ""AGILA"".
          - If A is ✓ in position 5 and G is x, then word is ""AMILA"".
          - If A is x in position 5, then word is ""AMILA"" (because A must be in position 2).

        And if we get A(✓) in position 5 and G(x), then we know A is in position 2, so the word is ""AMILA"", and we can try that next.

        So it's efficient.

        Therefore, I'll go with ""AGILA"".

        But let's see the feedback we might get.

        Guess: ""AGILA""

        If the word is ""AGILA"", then we win.

        If not, then we know it's ""AMILA"".

        So we can guess ""AGILA"".

        But note: in ""AGILA"", we are putting A in position 5. We know A is in position 1, so if the word has only one A, then A in position 5 should be marked as absent? But we know there is at least one A (in position 1), so if we put A in position 5 and it's not the word, it should be marked as '-' if there is a second A? But if the word has only one A, then position 5 A should be marked as 'x' if the word doesn't have A in position 5, but we know the word has A, so if we put A in position 5 and it's not the word, and if the word has only one A (in position 1), then the A in position 5 should be marked as absent? But the feedback for A: if the word has only one A, and we put A in position 5, then it should be marked as 'x' (not in word) because the only A is in position 1. But we know the word has at least one A, so if we put A in position 5 and it's not the word, it should be '-' if there is a second A? But if there is only one A, then it should be 'x' for position 5.

        But we don't know if there is a second A.

        However, in our previous guesses, we haven't tested position 2 for A.

        In ""axial"", we had A in position 4, which was wrong.

        So to test if A is in position 2 or 5, we can put A in position 5 and see.

        If we get A(✓) in position 5, then the word ends with A, and we know it's ""AGILA"" if G is also correct, or ""AMILA"" if G is wrong.

        If we get A(x) in position 5, then the word must have A in position 2, and G must be wrong, so the word is ""AMILA"".

        And if we get A(✓) in position 5 and G(✓), then it's ""AGILA"".

        And if we get A(✓) in position 5 and G(x), then it's ""AMILA"".

        And if we get A(x) in position 5, then it's ""AMILA"" (because A must be in position 2).

        So the feedback will tell us:

          - If A is ✓ in position 5: then word is A G I L A (if G is also ✓) or A ? I L A (if G is x, then position 2 is not G, and if A is ✓ in position 5, then position 2 must be something else, but if we get A(✓) in position 5, then we know position 2 is not A (because we are putting A in position 5 and it's correct, so position 2 is not A). So if we get A(✓) in position 5, then position 2 must be a letter that is not A and not excluded.

        But in ""AGILA"", we are putting G in position 2.

        So:

          - If A(✓) in position 5 and G(✓): word is ""AGILA"".
          - If A(✓) in position 5 and G(x): then word is ""AMILA"" (because A must be in position 2, and G is not in the word, so ""AMILA"").
          - If A(x) in position 5: then word is ""AMILA"" (because A must be in position 2, and position 5 is not A).

        So the feedback will be:

          - Position 5: A -> ✓ or x or - ? 
            - If the word is ""AGILA"": then A in position 5 is ✓.
            - If the word is ""AMILA"": then A in position 5 is not in the word? But the word has A in position 2, so A in position 5 is not present? So it would be marked as 'x' if the word has only one A? But we know the word has at least one A (in position 1), so if we put A in position 5 and the word has only one A (in position 1), then it should be marked as 'x' for position 5. But we know there is at least one A, so if we put A in position 5 and it's not the word, it should be '-' if there is a second A? But if there is only one A, then it should be 'x' for position 5.

        Let me clarify:

        - If the word is ""AGILA"": 
            - Position 1: A (✓)
            - Position 2: G (if we get ✓, then G is in the word and in position 2? But we are guessing G in position 2, and if it's correct, ✓. If not, then x or -.
            - Position 3: I (✓)
            - Position 4: L (✓, we know)
            - Position 5: A (✓) because it matches the word.

        - If the word is ""AMILA"":
            - Position 1: A (✓)
            - Position 2: G (if G is in the word? In ""AMILA"", position 2 is M, so if we put G in position 2, and M is not in the word, then G is x, and position 2 is not G and not M? But we don't know about M. If we put G in position 2 and the word has M in position 2, then G is x and position 2 is not G, but it might be M? So we get G(x) and then we know position 2 must be M (since it's the only option left for ""AMILA"").

        But if we get G(x) and A(✓) in position 5, then we know the word is ""AMILA"" (because A must be in position 2, and position 5 is A, so the word is A ? I L A, and if G is not in the word, then position 2 must be M).

        Similarly, if we get A(x) in position 5, then the word must be ""AMILA"" (because A must be in position 2).

        So:

          - If we get A(✓) in position 5 and G(✓): word is ""AGILA"".
          - If we get A(✓) in position 5 and G(x): word is ""AMILA"".
          - If we get A(x) in position 5: word is ""AMILA"" (because A must be in position 2).

        So the feedback will tell us the status of A in position 5 and G.

        Then we can proceed.

        Therefore, I'll go with ""AGILA"".

        So the next guess is ""AGILA"".

        But let's confirm the word: ""AGILA"" is a word? It is accepted in some dictionaries as a variant of ""agile"", but it is 5 letters. It means a type of deer or a term in law. But it's valid.

        We can also consider ""AMILA"".

        But I think ""AGILA"" is a reasonable guess.

        So I'll guess ""AGILA"".

        But note: in ""AGILA"", we are using G. We haven't tested G.

        We can also consider ""AIL"" is not 5.

        Another word: ""A K I L A"" is not a word.

        ""A V I L A"" not a word.

        ""A W I L A"" not a word.

        ""A Y I L A"" not a word.

        ""A Z I L A"" not a word.

        So only ""AGILA"" and ""AMILA"".

        I'll go with ""AGILA"".

        So the guess is ""AGILA"".

        But let's see the feedback we have.

        We know position 4 is L, and we are putting L in position 4, which is correct.

        So:

          Guess: AGILA

        If the word is ""AGILA"": then we win.

        If not, then we know it's ""AMILA"".

        And we use the next guess for ""AMILA"".

        But we have two more guesses, so it's okay.

        Alternatively, we can try a word that tests the duplicate A without committing to position 5.

        For example, we can try a word that has A in position 2 and a different letter in position 5, but we don't have a word.

        Or we can try a word that has A in position 5 and a new letter in position 2.

        But we have to use one of the two.

        I think ""AGILA"" is fine.

        So I'll go with that.

        <guess>agila</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  - **A** is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - **C, R, N, E** are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: aloft** → Feedback: A(✓), L(-), O(x), F(x), T(x)  
  - **A** is correct in position 1.  
  - **L** is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - **O, F, T** are not in the word.  

- **Guess 3: axial** → Feedback: A(✓), X(x), I(✓), A(-), L(-)  
  - **A** is correct in position 1 (reaffirmed).  
  - **I** is correct in position 3.  
  - **X** is not in the word.  
  - **A** is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - **L** is in the word but not in position 5.  

### Key Insights:
- The word starts with **A** (position 1) and has **I** in position 3: **A _ I _ _**
- **L** must be in position 4 (since it can't be in positions 2, 3, or 5: position 3 is I, and positions 2 and 5 are ruled out for L).  
- **A** must be in position 2 or 5 (due to feedback: not in 3 or 4).  
- Excluded letters: **C, R, N, E, O, F, T, X** (cannot appear).  
- The word structure is **A ? I L ?**, with positions 2 and 5 to be filled.  

### Analysis:
- **A in position 5**: If A is in position 5, the word is **A _ I L A**. Common words fitting this pattern are **AGILA** (if position 2 is G) or **AMILA** (if position 2 is M).  
- **A in position 2**: If A is in position 2, the word is **A A I L ?**, but no common English words match (e.g., ""AAI..."" are invalid).  
- **L in position 4**: Confirmed by Guess 3 (""axial"" → L- in position 5, but L is in position 4).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Test **A in position 5** and **G in position 2** for **AGILA**.  
- If correct, we solve the word. If not, the word must be **AMILA** (since A must be in position 2 if not 5, and G would be excluded).  
- This guess efficiently narrows the options with minimal guesses remaining.  

<guess>agila</guess>",agila,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, but not in position 3)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""aloft""
- A: ✓ (correct, position 1)
- L: - (in word, but not in position 2)
- O: x (not in word)
- F: x (not in word)
- T: x (not in word)

Guess 3: ""axial""
- A: ✓ (correct, position 1)
- X: x (not in word)
- I: ✓ (correct, position 3)
- A: - (in word, but not in position 4)
- L: - (in word, but not in position 5)

Now, combining all:

1. Correct positions:
   - Position 1: A (from guess 2 and 3)
   - Position 3: I (from guess 3)

2. Letters in the word but wrong positions:
   - A: known to be in word, but not in position 3 (from guess 1) and not in position 4 (from guess 3). So A must be in position 2 or 5? Because position 1 is A and position 3 is I, so A can only be in position 2 or 5.
   - L: known to be in word, but not in position 2 (guess 2) and not in position 5 (guess 3). So L must be in position 4 (since position 1 is A, position 3 is I, so positions 2,4,5 are open, but 2 and 5 are ruled out for L). Wait, position 2: L was tried and not there, so L cannot be in position 2. Position 5: L was tried and not there (in ""axial"", L was in position 5 and got '-', so not there). Therefore, L must be in position 4? Because position 1 is taken by A, position 3 by I, so L must be in position 4.

   But let's confirm: positions are 1,2,3,4,5.
   - Position 1: A (fixed)
   - Position 3: I (fixed)
   - L cannot be in position 2 (from ""aloft"") and cannot be in position 5 (from ""axial""). So the only position left for L is position 4.

   Therefore, L must be in position 4.

3. Excluded letters: from all guesses, we have:
   - Excluded: C, R, N, E, O, F, T, X (from guess 3: X is not in the word)
   - Also, from ""crane"": C, R, N, E are excluded.
   - From ""aloft"": O, F, T excluded.
   - From ""axial"": X excluded.

   So excluded: C, R, N, E, O, F, T, X.

4. We know the word has A (position 1), I (position 3), L (position 4), and one more letter? We have positions 2 and 5 to fill.

   Also, we know that A is in the word and must be in position 2 or 5 (since not 3 or 4). And L is in position 4.

   So the word so far: A _ I L _

   And A must be in position 2 or 5.

   Also, we have to find the remaining letter for position 2 and 5, and it must not be excluded.

   Available letters: all letters except excluded: C,R,N,E,O,F,T,X.

   But we also know that the word must be a valid English word.

5. We have not tested many letters. We have tested: C,R,A,N,E,O,F,T,L (from ""crane"", ""aloft"", ""axial""), and I is in the word (from ""axial"").

   Tested letters: A, C, R, N, E, O, F, T, L, X, I.

   Available common letters: B, D, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, Y, Z.

   We need to form a word: A _ I L _

   With A in position 2 or 5.

   Let's consider the two cases:

   Case 1: A in position 2 -> word: A A I L _
        Position 2: A (but we are putting A there, which is position 2)
        Position 5: some letter.

   Case 2: A in position 5 -> word: A _ I L A
        Position 2: some letter
        Position 5: A

   We need to find valid words.

   First, try Case 1: A in position 2 -> A A I L _
        We need a letter for position 5 that makes a valid word. And position 2 is A.

        Words: 
          - ""ABILY"" -> not a word? ""ABILY"" is not standard.
          - ""ADILY"" -> not a word.
          - ""AGILY"" -> not a word.
          - ""AHILY"" -> not a word.
          - ""AKILY"" -> not a word.
          - ""ALILY"" -> not a word.
          - ""AMILY"" -> ""AMILY"" is a name? Not common.
          - ""ANILY"" -> N excluded.
          - ""A PILS"" -> ""A P I L S"" -> ""APILS"" is not a word? But ""APIS"" is 4 letters. ""APILS"" is not standard.
          - ""A V I L S"" -> ""AVILS"" is not a word.

        This doesn't work.

    Case 2: A in position 5: A _ I L A
        We need a letter for position 2.

        Words: 
          - ""A D I L A"" -> ""ADILA"" not a word.
          - ""A G I L A"" -> ""AGILA"" (a type of deer) -> valid? It's a word.
          - ""A H I L A"" -> not a word.
          - ""A K I L A"" -> not a word.
          - ""A M I L A"" -> ""AMILA"" (a type of tree) -> valid.
          - ""A P I L A"" -> ""APILA"" not a word.
          - ""A S I L A"" -> ""ASILA"" not a word.
          - ""A U I L A"" -> ""U I L A"" -> ""AUILA"" not a word.
          - ""A B I L A"" -> ""BILAA"" not a word.
          - ""A B I L S"" -> ""ABILS"" is not a word? ""ABIS"" is 4 letters.
          - ""A D I L S"" -> ""ADILS"" not a word.
          - ""A G I L S"" -> ""AGILS"" not a word.
          - ""A H I L S"" -> ""AHILS"" not a word.
          - ""A K I L S"" -> ""AKILS"" not a word.
          - ""A M I L S"" -> ""AMILS"" not a word.
          - ""A P I L S"" -> ""APILS"" not a word.
          - ""A S I L S"" -> ""ASILS"" not a word.
          - ""A U I L S"" -> ""AUILS"" not a word.

        But ""AGILA"" and ""AMILA"" are words? Let me check: 
          - ""AGILA"": a genus of deer (agile deer). 
          - ""AMILA"": a type of tree (milpa). 
        They are accepted in some dictionaries.

        But note: in ""AGILA"", the last letter is A, so it would be A G I L A -> positions: 1:A, 2:G, 3:I, 4:L, 5:A. 
        But we have position 5 as A? But we know A is in position 1, and we are putting A in position 5? That would be two A's? But we don't know if the word has two A's.

        Similarly, ""AMILA"": A M I L A.

        But we have to avoid excluded letters: G and M are not excluded.

        However, we have to check if these words are valid.

        But we also have to consider that we haven't tested G or M.

        Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 5 and a new letter in position 2.

        But we need to confirm if there is a second A.

        However, we have another constraint: in ""axial"", we had A in position 4 and got a '-', meaning A is in the word but not in position 4. So if we put A in position 5, that might be correct.

        But we don't know if the word has two A's.

        We can try ""AGILA"" or ""AMILA"", but they are not common.

        Are there more common words?

        What about ""AILA""? But that's 4 letters.

        ""AALIA"" -> not a word.

        ""AALIY"" -> not a word.

        ""AQUIL"" -> but Q and U: ""AQUIL"" is 5 letters? A Q U I L -> but L is in position 5? And position 4 is I? But we have position 4 as L? No, in ""AQUIL"": A(1), Q(2), U(3), I(4), L(5) -> but we need position 3 to be I, but here position 3 is U. So not.

        We need position 3 to be I.

        So the word must be: A ? I L ?

        With ? being letters not excluded.

        And A in position 5: so word: A ? I L A

        Now, what letters can we use? We have available: B, D, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, Y, Z.

        Common words: 
          - ""AGILE"" -> but E is excluded.
          - ""AMIGO"" -> O excluded.
          - ""ALIBI"" -> L in position 2? Not allowed.

        How about ""AMINA""? But N excluded.

        ""ABACI"" -> C excluded.

        ""ADILI"" -> D and I: but I is already in position 3, and we are putting I in position 3? ""ADILI"" has I in position 3? A D I L I -> but that would be A(1), D(2), I(3), L(4), I(5). But we have two I's? And we know I is in position 3, but we don't know if there is another I. Also, D is allowed.

        But ""ADILI"" is not a word? It might be a word? ""Adili"" is not standard.

        ""AEGIS"" -> no L.

        ""ALGAL"" -> L in position 2? Not allowed.

        ""ALGAE"" -> E excluded.

        ""ALPHA"" -> L in position 2.

        I think we are stuck with words like ""AGILA"" or ""AMILA"".

        But let's consider the other case: A in position 2.

        For A in position 2: A A I L ?

        We need a letter for position 5 and position 2? Position 2 is A, position 5 is something.

        Word: A A I L ?

        Examples: 
          - ""A A I L S"" -> ""AAILS"" not a word.
          - ""A A I L D"" -> ""AAILED"" too long.
          - ""A A I L K"" -> ""AAIK"" not a word.

        Not finding common words.

        Perhaps we missed that A might be in position 5.

        Let me list all possible words that start with A, have I in position 3, L in position 4, and end with A? Or have a letter in position 2 and 5.

        We know position 4 is L.

        So the word is: A [letter] I L [letter]

        And the letters must not be excluded.

        Available letters: B, D, G, H, J, K, M, P, S, U, V, W, Y, Z.

        And we know A is in the word, so one of the positions (2 or 5) must be A.

        Now, if we put A in position 5: then the word is A ? I L A

        Then we need a letter for position 2.

        Words: 
          - ""A G I L A"" -> ""AGILA"" (if we accept it, which it is a word)
          - ""A M I L A"" -> ""AMILA""
          - ""A B I L A"" -> not a word.
          - ""A D I L A"" -> not a word.
          - ""A H I L A"" -> not a word.
          - ""A K I L A"" -> not a word.
          - ""A P I L A"" -> not a word.
          - ""A S I L A"" -> not a word.
          - ""A U I L A"" -> ""AUILA"" not a word.

        So the only common words are ""AGILA"" and ""AMILA"".

        But we haven't tested G or M.

        We can try one of these.

        But we have to choose one.

        Alternatively, if we put A in position 2: A A I L ?

        We need a letter for position 5. What words? 
          - ""A A I L S"" -> not a word.
          - ""A A I L D"" -> ""AAILED"" is 6 letters.
          - ""A A I L K"" -> not a word.
          - ""A A I L Y"" -> ""AAILY"" not a word.

        Not found.

        Another idea: what if the word has duplicate letters? For example, two A's? But we don't have evidence.

        We know A is in position 1, and if we put A in position 2, that would be a duplicate.

        But we don't have a word for ""A A I L ?"".

        Perhaps ""A A I L S"" is not a word, but ""A A I L D"" is not 5 letters.

        I think we have to go with ""AGILA"" or ""AMILA"".

        But let's see if there is a word with a different letter in position 2.

        What about ""A B I L A""? Not a word.

        ""A D I L A""? No.

        ""A G I L A""? Yes, ""AGILA"".

        ""A M I L A""? ""AMILA"".

        Also, ""A P I L A""? No.

        ""A S I L A""? No.

        ""A U I L A""? No.

        So the only possibilities are ""AGILA"" and ""AMILA"".

        Now, we can choose one. Let's pick ""AGILA"" because G is more common than M? Or we can choose based on frequency.

        But we have to consider that we have not tested G or M.

        We can also consider that in ""AGILA"", we have G in position 2, and A in position 5. We know A is in position 1, so if we put A in position 5, it might be correct.

        Similarly, for ""AMILA"": M in position 2, A in position 5.

        But we don't know if the word has two A's.

        Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't assume A in position 5, but tests position 2.

        But we don't have a word for A in position 2.

        Another word: ""A B I L S"" is not a word.

        ""A D I L S"" not a word.

        ""A G I L S"" not a word.

        ""A M I L S"" not a word.

        ""A P I L S"" not a word.

        ""A S I L S"" not a word.

        ""A U I L S"" not a word.

        So the only options are ""AGILA"" and ""AMILA"".

        We can also consider ""A K I L S"" -> not a word.

        ""A V I L S"" -> not a word.

        ""A W I L S"" -> not a word.

        ""A Y I L S"" -> not a word.

        ""A Z I L S"" -> not a word.

        So only ""AGILA"" and ""AMILA"".

        Now, let's see if there is a word with A in position 5 and a different letter in position 2.

        We have ""AGILA"" (G in position 2) and ""AMILA"" (M in position 2).

        We can also consider ""AILA"" is 4 letters.

        Another word: ""A L I A L"" -> but L is in position 2? Not allowed, and also we have L in position 4? Conflict.

        We know L is in position 4, so we cannot have L in position 2.

        So back to ""AGILA"" or ""AMILA"".

        We can try ""AGILA"".

        But note: in ""AGILA"", we have:
          - Position 1: A (correct)
          - Position 2: G (new)
          - Position 3: I (correct)
          - Position 4: L (we know it must be L, so if it's correct, good)
          - Position 5: A (we are testing if A is in position 5)

        If the word is ""AGILA"", then position 5 is A, and we get a ✓ for A in position 5? But we don't know if it's correct.

        Similarly, if we try ""AMILA"", same thing.

        But we have to choose one.

        Alternatively, we can try a word that tests multiple possibilities.

        We know A must be in position 2 or 5. We can try a word that has A in position 2 and then if it's not, we know it's in position 5.

        But we don't have a word for A in position 2.

        We can try a word that has A in position 5 and a different letter in position 2.

        But we have to use one of the ""AMILA"" words.

        Or we can try a word that doesn't have A in position 5, but we have to include L in position 4.

        But we know L must be in position 4, so we have to put L there.

        So we are forced to put A in position 5 in this guess.

        Therefore, we choose ""AGILA"" to test.

        If ""AGILA"" is not the word, then we know it must be ""AMILA"" or another word? But what other words? We have only these two.

        But there might be others? Let me think.

        What about ""A B I L A""? Not a word.

        ""A D I L A"" -> not a word.

        ""A G I L A"" -> yes, ""AGILA""

        ""A M I L A"" -> ""AMILA""

        ""A P I L A"" -> not a word.

        ""A S I L A"" -> not a word.

        ""A U I L A"" -> not a word.

        ""A V I L A"" -> not a word.

        ""A W I L A"" -> not a word.

        ""A Y I L A"" -> not a word.

        ""A Z I L A"" -> not a word.

        So only two possibilities: ""AGILA"" and ""AMILA"".

        We can try ""AGILA"".

        If it's not, then we try ""AMILA"" next.

        But we have two guesses left? We have 6 tries, so we have 3 more? Let's see: we are on guess 4, so we have 3 more after this.

        But we can try to get more information.

        Alternatively, we can try a word that tests the position 2 letter and also tests for A in position 5, but without committing to A in position 5.

        For example, we can try a word that has A in position 5, but also includes other letters to test.

        But we have to have L in position 4.

        So the word must be A ? I L A.

        We can try ""AGILA"".

        If we are wrong, we know it's ""AMILA"".

        But we can also try to test more letters.

        We have to fill position 2 and 5.

        Position 2: we can try a common letter like S, D, G, M, etc.

        In ""AGILA"", we are trying G in position 2 and A in position 5.

        But we know A is in position 1, so if A is in position 5, it's a duplicate.

        We can also try ""AMILA"" to test M.

        But let's see if there is a word that doesn't have A in position 5? For example, if we put a different letter in position 5 and A in position 2.

        But we don't have a word for A in position 2.

        Another idea: what if the word is ""AILA"" with a suffix? But it's 4 letters.

        Or ""AILU"" -> not.

        I think we have to go with ""AGILA"" or ""AMILA"".

        Let me check if there is ""A I L"" with a letter in between and A at the end? But we have position 4 as L, so it's A ? I L A.

        Words: 
          - ""AGILA"" (if we accept it) -> G in position 2, A in position 5.
          - ""AMILA"" -> M in position 2, A in position 5.

        But ""AGILA"" is a word? It's in some dictionaries. Similarly, ""AMILA"" is also accepted.

        We can also consider ""A B I L A"" but not a word.

        Or ""A D I L A"" not a word.

        So I think we have to choose between ""AGILA"" and ""AMILA"".

        Let's pick ""AGILA"" as the next guess.

        If it's not, then we know it's ""AMILA"".

        But we have two more guesses after this.

        Alternatively, we can try to test more letters.

        We have not tested: B, D, G, H, K, M, P, S, U, V, W, Y, Z.

        In ""AGILA"", we are testing G and A in position 5.

        If we get feedback that A is correct in position 5, then we know it's ""AGILA"". If not, then it must be ""AMILA"".

        But we can also try a word that has A in position 5, but with a different letter in position 2, to test multiple options.

        For example, we can try ""AGILE"" but E is excluded.

        ""AGILE"" has E, which is excluded.

        ""AGLOW"" -> O and W? But O is excluded.

        ""AGREE"" -> E excluded.

        ""AGONE"" -> O and E excluded.

        ""AGAPE"" -> E excluded.

        ""AGAMA"" -> A G A M A -> but we have A in position 1 and 5? And I is in position 3? But ""AGAMA"": A(1), G(2), A(3), M(4), A(5) -> but position 3 is A, but we have I in position 3? Conflict. We know position 3 is I.

        So we cannot change position 3.

        Position 3 is fixed as I.

        So the word must be A ? I L ?

        And we have to fill the ? with letters not excluded.

        So the only options are letters that can form a word with A in position 5 and L in position 4.

        Therefore, we must guess one of ""AGILA"" or ""AMILA"".

        Let me choose ""AGILA"".

        So the next guess is ""AGILA"".

        If it's not, then we know it's ""AMILA"".

        But we have two more guesses, so it's acceptable.

        Alternatively, we can try a word that tests the duplicate A possibility without committing to position 5.

        For example, we can try a word that has A in position 2 (if we believe in duplicate A) and also tests other letters.

        But we don't have a word for A in position 2.

        We can try to put A in position 5 and test a new letter in position 2.

        But we have to use one of the two words.

        I think ""AGILA"" is a reasonable guess.

        So let's go with ""AGILA"".

        But note: in ""AGILA"", we have:
          - Position 1: A (correct)
          - Position 2: G (new)
          - Position 3: I (correct)
          - Position 4: L (we know it must be L, so if correct, good)
          - Position 5: A (we are testing)

        If the feedback shows:
          - If G is correct, then it's ""AGILA"".
          - If G is wrong, then it must be ""AMILA"", and we can try that next.

        But we can also get information about G.

        If G is not in the word, then we know it's ""AMILA"".

        Similarly, if A in position 5 is correct, then we know it's ""AGILA"" or ""AMILA"", but if it's not, then it must be ""AMILA"".

        But if A in position 5 is not correct, then we know A must be in position 2 (if duplicate A) or we have an error.

        But if A in position 5 is not correct, then we know A is in position 2, and the word is ""AMILA"".

        So the guess ""AGILA"" will tell us:

          - If A in position 5 is correct: then it's ""AGILA"" if G is also correct, or if A is correct but G wrong, then it might be ""AMILA"" but we don't know position 2.

          - If A in position 5 is not correct, then it must be ""AMILA"" (since A must be in position 2 if not 5, but we don't know duplicate A).

        But if A in position 5 is not correct, then we know A is in position 2, and the word is ""AMILA"", because if A is in position 2, then in ""AGILA"", A in position 5 would be wrong, and G in position 2: if G is not in the word, then it's ""AMILA"".

        So:

          - If feedback: A(✓) and G(✓) then word is ""AGILA"".
          - If feedback: A(✓) and G(x) then word is ""AMILA"" (because A must be in position 2, and G not in word, so ""AMILA"").
          - If feedback: A(x) then that would be a contradiction because we know A is in the word. But if A is not in position 5, and we put A in position 5, if it's not correct, then we know A must be in position 2, and the word must be ""AMILA"" (since ""AGILA"" would require G which is not present if A is not in 5).

        So:

          - If A is correct in position 5: then it's ""AGILA"" if G is also correct, or if A is correct but G is wrong, then it might be ""AMILA"" (but then A is in position 5, and G is not in the word, so ""AMILA"").

          - If A is not correct in position 5, then it must be ""AMILA"" (because A must be in position 2, and G is not in the word, so ""AMILA"").

        So by guessing ""AGILA"", we can distinguish:

          - If A is ✓ in position 5 and G is ✓, then word is ""AGILA"".
          - If A is ✓ in position 5 and G is x, then word is ""AMILA"".
          - If A is x in position 5, then word is ""AMILA"" (because A must be in position 2).

        And if we get A(✓) in position 5 and G(x), then we know A is in position 2, so the word is ""AMILA"", and we can try that next.

        So it's efficient.

        Therefore, I'll go with ""AGILA"".

        But let's see the feedback we might get.

        Guess: ""AGILA""

        If the word is ""AGILA"", then we win.

        If not, then we know it's ""AMILA"".

        So we can guess ""AGILA"".

        But note: in ""AGILA"", we are putting A in position 5. We know A is in position 1, so if the word has only one A, then A in position 5 should be marked as absent? But we know there is at least one A (in position 1), so if we put A in position 5 and it's not the word, it should be marked as '-' if there is a second A? But if the word has only one A, then position 5 A should be marked as 'x' if the word doesn't have A in position 5, but we know the word has A, so if we put A in position 5 and it's not the word, and if the word has only one A (in position 1), then the A in position 5 should be marked as absent? But the feedback for A: if the word has only one A, and we put A in position 5, then it should be marked as 'x' (not in word) because the only A is in position 1. But we know the word has at least one A, so if we put A in position 5 and it's not the word, it should be '-' if there is a second A? But if there is only one A, then it should be 'x' for position 5.

        But we don't know if there is a second A.

        However, in our previous guesses, we haven't tested position 2 for A.

        In ""axial"", we had A in position 4, which was wrong.

        So to test if A is in position 2 or 5, we can put A in position 5 and see.

        If we get A(✓) in position 5, then the word ends with A, and we know it's ""AGILA"" if G is also correct, or ""AMILA"" if G is wrong.

        If we get A(x) in position 5, then the word must have A in position 2, and G must be wrong, so the word is ""AMILA"".

        And if we get A(✓) in position 5 and G(✓), then it's ""AGILA"".

        And if we get A(✓) in position 5 and G(x), then it's ""AMILA"".

        And if we get A(x) in position 5, then it's ""AMILA"" (because A must be in position 2).

        So the feedback will tell us:

          - If A is ✓ in position 5: then word is A G I L A (if G is also ✓) or A ? I L A (if G is x, then position 2 is not G, and if A is ✓ in position 5, then position 2 must be something else, but if we get A(✓) in position 5, then we know position 2 is not A (because we are putting A in position 5 and it's correct, so position 2 is not A). So if we get A(✓) in position 5, then position 2 must be a letter that is not A and not excluded.

        But in ""AGILA"", we are putting G in position 2.

        So:

          - If A(✓) in position 5 and G(✓): word is ""AGILA"".
          - If A(✓) in position 5 and G(x): then word is ""AMILA"" (because A must be in position 2, and G is not in the word, so ""AMILA"").
          - If A(x) in position 5: then word is ""AMILA"" (because A must be in position 2, and position 5 is not A).

        So the feedback will be:

          - Position 5: A -> ✓ or x or - ? 
            - If the word is ""AGILA"": then A in position 5 is ✓.
            - If the word is ""AMILA"": then A in position 5 is not in the word? But the word has A in position 2, so A in position 5 is not present? So it would be marked as 'x' if the word has only one A? But we know the word has at least one A (in position 1), so if we put A in position 5 and the word has only one A (in position 1), then it should be marked as 'x' for position 5. But we know there is at least one A, so if we put A in position 5 and it's not the word, it should be '-' if there is a second A? But if there is only one A, then it should be 'x' for position 5.

        Let me clarify:

        - If the word is ""AGILA"": 
            - Position 1: A (✓)
            - Position 2: G (if we get ✓, then G is in the word and in position 2? But we are guessing G in position 2, and if it's correct, ✓. If not, then x or -.
            - Position 3: I (✓)
            - Position 4: L (✓, we know)
            - Position 5: A (✓) because it matches the word.

        - If the word is ""AMILA"":
            - Position 1: A (✓)
            - Position 2: G (if G is in the word? In ""AMILA"", position 2 is M, so if we put G in position 2, and M is not in the word, then G is x, and position 2 is not G and not M? But we don't know about M. If we put G in position 2 and the word has M in position 2, then G is x and position 2 is not G, but it might be M? So we get G(x) and then we know position 2 must be M (since it's the only option left for ""AMILA"").

        But if we get G(x) and A(✓) in position 5, then we know the word is ""AMILA"" (because A must be in position 2, and position 5 is A, so the word is A ? I L A, and if G is not in the word, then position 2 must be M).

        Similarly, if we get A(x) in position 5, then the word must be ""AMILA"" (because A must be in position 2).

        So:

          - If we get A(✓) in position 5 and G(✓): word is ""AGILA"".
          - If we get A(✓) in position 5 and G(x): word is ""AMILA"".
          - If we get A(x) in position 5: word is ""AMILA"" (because A must be in position 2).

        So the feedback will tell us the status of A in position 5 and G.

        Then we can proceed.

        Therefore, I'll go with ""AGILA"".

        So the next guess is ""AGILA"".

        But let's confirm the word: ""AGILA"" is a word? It is accepted in some dictionaries as a variant of ""agile"", but it is 5 letters. It means a type of deer or a term in law. But it's valid.

        We can also consider ""AMILA"".

        But I think ""AGILA"" is a reasonable guess.

        So I'll guess ""AGILA"".

        But note: in ""AGILA"", we are using G. We haven't tested G.

        We can also consider ""AIL"" is not 5.

        Another word: ""A K I L A"" is not a word.

        ""A V I L A"" not a word.

        ""A W I L A"" not a word.

        ""A Y I L A"" not a word.

        ""A Z I L A"" not a word.

        So only ""AGILA"" and ""AMILA"".

        I'll go with ""AGILA"".

        So the guess is ""AGILA"".

        But let's see the feedback we have.

        We know position 4 is L, and we are putting L in position 4, which is correct.

        So:

          Guess: AGILA

        If the word is ""AGILA"": then we win.

        If not, then we know it's ""AMILA"".

        And we use the next guess for ""AMILA"".

        But we have two more guesses, so it's okay.

        Alternatively, we can try a word that tests the duplicate A without committing to position 5.

        For example, we can try a word that has A in position 2 and a different letter in position 5, but we don't have a word.

        Or we can try a word that has A in position 5 and a new letter in position 2.

        But we have to use one of the two.

        I think ""AGILA"" is fine.

        So I'll go with that.

        <guess>agila</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  - **A** is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - **C, R, N, E** are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: aloft** → Feedback: A(✓), L(-), O(x), F(x), T(x)  
  - **A** is correct in position 1.  
  - **L** is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - **O, F, T** are not in the word.  

- **Guess 3: axial** → Feedback: A(✓), X(x), I(✓), A(-), L(-)  
  - **A** is correct in position 1 (reaffirmed).  
  - **I** is correct in position 3.  
  - **X** is not in the word.  
  - **A** is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - **L** is in the word but not in position 5.  

### Key Insights:
- The word starts with **A** (position 1) and has **I** in position 3: **A _ I _ _**
- **L** must be in position 4 (since it can't be in positions 2, 3, or 5: position 3 is I, and positions 2 and 5 are ruled out for L).  
- **A** must be in position 2 or 5 (due to feedback: not in 3 or 4).  
- Excluded letters: **C, R, N, E, O, F, T, X** (cannot appear).  
- The word structure is **A ? I L ?**, with positions 2 and 5 to be filled.  

### Analysis:
- **A in position 5**: If A is in position 5, the word is **A _ I L A**. Common words fitting this pattern are **AGILA** (if position 2 is G) or **AMILA** (if position 2 is M).  
- **A in position 2**: If A is in position 2, the word is **A A I L ?**, but no common English words match (e.g., ""AAI..."" are invalid).  
- **L in position 4**: Confirmed by Guess 3 (""axial"" → L- in position 5, but L is in position 4).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Test **A in position 5** and **G in position 2** for **AGILA**.  
- If correct, we solve the word. If not, the word must be **AMILA** (since A must be in position 2 if not 5, and G would be excluded).  
- This guess efficiently narrows the options with minimal guesses remaining.",Guess 4: agila -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) G(✓) I(✓) L(✓) A(✓),SUCCESS
