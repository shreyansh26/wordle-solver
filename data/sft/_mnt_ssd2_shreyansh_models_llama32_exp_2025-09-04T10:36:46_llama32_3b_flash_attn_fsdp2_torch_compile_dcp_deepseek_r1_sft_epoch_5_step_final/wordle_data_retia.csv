 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letters C and N are not in the secret word.
 - The letters R, A, and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed.

 Since we know R, A, E are in the word, but not in the positions we had (which were positions 2, 3, and 5 respectively), we must place them elsewhere.

 Also, note that the secret word does not contain C or N.

 We have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.

 We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C or N.
   - Contains R, A, E (but not in positions 2, 3, 5? Actually, the feedback says they are in the word but not in the positions we guessed. So for R, it cannot be at position 2; for A, cannot be at position 3; for E, cannot be at position 5).

 However, note: the feedback does not prevent these letters from appearing in other positions if they are repeated? But we don't know if there are duplicates. Since we only have one occurrence in the guess, we assume at least one occurrence of each.

 We also know that the word has 5 letters and we have 3 known letters (R, A, E) and two unknown letters.

 We can try to use a word that has R, A, E in positions that are not 2, 3, 5? Actually, we can put them in any position except the ones we tried? But note: we only know that they are not in the positions we guessed. They could be in the same position again? But that would be a duplicate? We don't know.

 However, we must avoid the letters C and N.

 Let's think of words that contain R, A, E and two other letters (which are not C or N).

 Also, we want to test new positions for R, A, E and also get information about the other two letters.

 Since R was in position 2 in the first guess and now is not there, we can try R in a different position. Similarly for A and E.

 Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but not 2).
 Possible positions for A: 1, 4, 5 (but not 3).
 Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 4 (but not 5).

 We also have two more letters to guess.

 We can try to put R in position 1, A in position 4, and E in position 2? But we have to form a valid word.

 Let's try to think of words that have R, A, E and two other letters (not C, N).

 Example: ""LATER"" -> L, A, T, E, R.
 But note: we have to check the positions.

 In ""LATER"":
   L at position 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.

 But we know that A cannot be at position 3? Actually, in our first guess, A was at position 3 and we got a '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 3. So in ""LATER"", A is at position 2 which is allowed. Similarly, E is at position 4 (which is not 5, so allowed) and R is at position 5 (which is not 2, so allowed).

 However, we also have to consider that the word must be valid.

 But wait: we have to avoid C and N. ""LATER"" does not contain C or N.

 Alternatively, we could try ""RAISE"": 
   R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5 -> but E is at position 5? We know E cannot be at position 5 because in the first guess E was at position 5 and we got a '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5 again.

 Therefore, ""RAISE"" is invalid because E is at position 5.

 Another idea: ""STARE""
   S at 1, T at 2, A at 3 -> but A was at position 3 in the first guess and we know it cannot be at position 3? Actually, no: the feedback for the first guess said A is in the word but not at position 3. So we cannot put A at position 3 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not correct because the feedback already told us it's not at position 3. So we should avoid putting A at position 3.

 In ""STARE"", A is at position 3 again? So that's not allowed? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we already know it's not there. So we should try a word that puts A in a new position.

 Let's try to put A in position 1, E in position 2, and R in position 4? Example: ""AREAS"" -> but that has duplicate A? And also S at the end. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don't say, but typically in Wordle, words can have duplicate letters? However, the feedback might not indicate duplicates? Actually, the feedback per letter: if a letter appears twice, then the feedback might be tricky. But we don't have any duplicate in the first guess.

 However, we must avoid C and N.

 Another word: ""EARLY""
   E at 1, A at 2, R at 3, L at 4, Y at 5.
   But note: E is at position 1 (which is allowed), A at 2 (allowed because we only know it's not at 3), R at 3 (allowed because we only know it's not at 2). Also, we are testing new letters L and Y.

 But wait: we have E at position 1. We don't know if that's correct. We are trying to get more information.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROAST"", but we know that O and S are new, and A is at position 3? We know A cannot be at position 3? So we avoid that.

 How about ""RADIO""? 
   R at 1, A at 2, D at 3, I at 4, O at 5.
   But we know E is in the word? We don't have E in this word. We must include E because we know it's in the word.

 So we must include R, A, E.

 Another word: ""ALERT""
   A at 1, L at 2, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5.
   Check positions:
     A: position 1 (not 3 -> allowed)
     E: position 3 (not 5 -> allowed? we don't know about position 3 for E? The feedback only said E is not at position 5. So position 3 is new and allowed.
     R: position 4 (not 2 -> allowed)

   Also, we avoid C and N.

 But note: we have E at position 3. We don't know if that's correct.

 Alternatively, we can try ""STARE"" but we cannot put A at position 3. So we rearrange: 
   How about ""STORE""? 
     S at 1, T at 2, O at 3, R at 4, E at 5 -> but E at position 5 is not allowed? Because we know E is not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5.

 How about ""STARE"" but without putting A at 3? We can put A at 1? Then ""ALTER"" -> A at 1, L at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.
   Check:
     A: position 1 (not 3 -> allowed)
     E: position 4 (not 5 -> allowed)
     R: position 5 (not 2 -> allowed)

   This seems okay.

 But note: we have R at position 5 and E at position 4. Also, we are testing L and T.

 However, we have to consider that the word must be valid. ""ALTER"" is a valid word.

 But wait: we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

 Another option: ""RANGE"" -> but we know N is not in the word (from first guess: N was at position 4 and we got x) so we cannot use N.

 We must avoid N.

 So ""ALTER"" seems a good candidate.

 But let me check: we have A at 1, L at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.

 We are testing:
   A at 1: if it's correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or an x? But we know A is in the word, so if it's not at 1, we get a minus.

 Similarly, we are testing L and T.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RAISE"" but we cannot put E at 5. So we skip.

 Another word: ""PARSE""
   P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, S at 4, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed.

 How about ""PRIDE""? 
   P at 1, R at 2 -> but R was at position 2 in the first guess and we got a minus meaning it is not at position 2. So we cannot put R at position 2 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not there. So we avoid.

 How about ""DRIVE""? 
   D at 1, R at 2 -> again, R at position 2 is not allowed.

 We must avoid position 2 for R.

 So let's try to put R at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But we have constraints on A and E as well.

 We can try ""RADIO"" but we need E.

 How about ""REACT""? -> but we cannot use C (because we know C is not in the word).

 We must avoid C and N.

 So let's try ""REALM"": 
   R at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> but A at position 3 is not allowed? Because we know A is not at position 3. So we avoid.

 How about ""LEARN""? 
   L at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> again, A at 3 is not allowed.

 We need to avoid position 3 for A.

 So let's try to put A at position 1? Then we can put E at position 2? and R at position 4? Then we have two letters in the middle.

 Example: ""ALERT"" (which we considered earlier) is okay.

 But let me see: ""ALERT"" has A at 1, L at 2, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5.

 Check positions:
   A: 1 (not 3 -> allowed)
   E: 3 (not 5 -> allowed)
   R: 4 (not 2 -> allowed)

 So that's acceptable.

 Another option: ""ALTER"" (as above) has A at 1, L at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.

 Both are acceptable.

 But note: we also want to test new letters. We have already used: C, R, A, N, E (from the first guess). So we should avoid C and N, but we can use other letters.

 We haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to maximize information. So we should try to include common letters that we haven't tested.

 Common consonants: S, T, L, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that has R, A, E and two new common letters.

 We can try ""STARE"" but we cannot put A at 3. So we skip.

 How about ""TARES""? 
   T at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, S at 5.
   Check:
     A: position 2 (not 3 -> allowed)
     E: position 4 (not 5 -> allowed)
     R: position 3 (not 2 -> allowed)

   This is acceptable.

 But note: we are putting A at position 2 and R at position 3. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try ""LATER"": 
   L at 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> same as ALTER but with L instead of T.

 We haven't tested L or T. So either is fine.

 I think ""LATER"" is a common word.

 But note: we have to avoid using letters we know are not present: C and N. Both ""LATER"" and ""ALTER"" are safe.

 Let me choose ""LATER"". It uses L and T, which are common.

 So my second guess: ""LATER""

 However, note: we are not forced to put R, A, E in the next guess? Actually, we know they are in the word, so we should include them to get more information about their positions.

 We are including R, A, E and two new letters L and T.

 Let's go with ""LATER"".

<guess>later</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** and **N** are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **R**, **A**, and **E** are present but in incorrect positions (marked ""-""):
  - R cannot be in position 2.
  - A cannot be in position 3.
  - E cannot be in position 5.

For the second guess, I need a word that:
- Includes **R**, **A**, and **E** (since they are confirmed present).
- Excludes **C** and **N** (since they are absent).
- Tests new positions for R, A, and E to narrow down their locations.
- Introduces new common letters (like **L** and **T**) for additional information.

The word **""LATER""** fits these criteria:
- Places **R** at position 5 (not 2).
- Places **A** at position 2 (not 3).
- Places **E** at position 4 (not 5).
- Uses **L** and **T** (common letters not yet tested).
- Avoids **C** and **N**.

This guess will help verify the positions of R, A, and E while testing two new letters.

<guess>later</guess>",later,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letters C and N are not in the secret word.
 - The letters R, A, and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed.

 Since we know R, A, E are in the word, but not in the positions we had (which were positions 2, 3, and 5 respectively), we must place them elsewhere.

 Also, note that the secret word does not contain C or N.

 We have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.

 We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C or N.
   - Contains R, A, E (but not in positions 2, 3, 5? Actually, the feedback says they are in the word but not in the positions we guessed. So for R, it cannot be at position 2; for A, cannot be at position 3; for E, cannot be at position 5).

 However, note: the feedback does not prevent these letters from appearing in other positions if they are repeated? But we don't know if there are duplicates. Since we only have one occurrence in the guess, we assume at least one occurrence of each.

 We also know that the word has 5 letters and we have 3 known letters (R, A, E) and two unknown letters.

 We can try to use a word that has R, A, E in positions that are not 2, 3, 5? Actually, we can put them in any position except the ones we tried? But note: we only know that they are not in the positions we guessed. They could be in the same position again? But that would be a duplicate? We don't know.

 However, we must avoid the letters C and N.

 Let's think of words that contain R, A, E and two other letters (which are not C or N).

 Also, we want to test new positions for R, A, E and also get information about the other two letters.

 Since R was in position 2 in the first guess and now is not there, we can try R in a different position. Similarly for A and E.

 Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but not 2).
 Possible positions for A: 1, 4, 5 (but not 3).
 Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 4 (but not 5).

 We also have two more letters to guess.

 We can try to put R in position 1, A in position 4, and E in position 2? But we have to form a valid word.

 Let's try to think of words that have R, A, E and two other letters (not C, N).

 Example: ""LATER"" -> L, A, T, E, R.
 But note: we have to check the positions.

 In ""LATER"":
   L at position 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.

 But we know that A cannot be at position 3? Actually, in our first guess, A was at position 3 and we got a '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 3. So in ""LATER"", A is at position 2 which is allowed. Similarly, E is at position 4 (which is not 5, so allowed) and R is at position 5 (which is not 2, so allowed).

 However, we also have to consider that the word must be valid.

 But wait: we have to avoid C and N. ""LATER"" does not contain C or N.

 Alternatively, we could try ""RAISE"": 
   R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5 -> but E is at position 5? We know E cannot be at position 5 because in the first guess E was at position 5 and we got a '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5 again.

 Therefore, ""RAISE"" is invalid because E is at position 5.

 Another idea: ""STARE""
   S at 1, T at 2, A at 3 -> but A was at position 3 in the first guess and we know it cannot be at position 3? Actually, no: the feedback for the first guess said A is in the word but not at position 3. So we cannot put A at position 3 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not correct because the feedback already told us it's not at position 3. So we should avoid putting A at position 3.

 In ""STARE"", A is at position 3 again? So that's not allowed? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we already know it's not there. So we should try a word that puts A in a new position.

 Let's try to put A in position 1, E in position 2, and R in position 4? Example: ""AREAS"" -> but that has duplicate A? And also S at the end. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don't say, but typically in Wordle, words can have duplicate letters? However, the feedback might not indicate duplicates? Actually, the feedback per letter: if a letter appears twice, then the feedback might be tricky. But we don't have any duplicate in the first guess.

 However, we must avoid C and N.

 Another word: ""EARLY""
   E at 1, A at 2, R at 3, L at 4, Y at 5.
   But note: E is at position 1 (which is allowed), A at 2 (allowed because we only know it's not at 3), R at 3 (allowed because we only know it's not at 2). Also, we are testing new letters L and Y.

 But wait: we have E at position 1. We don't know if that's correct. We are trying to get more information.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROAST"", but we know that O and S are new, and A is at position 3? We know A cannot be at position 3? So we avoid that.

 How about ""RADIO""? 
   R at 1, A at 2, D at 3, I at 4, O at 5.
   But we know E is in the word? We don't have E in this word. We must include E because we know it's in the word.

 So we must include R, A, E.

 Another word: ""ALERT""
   A at 1, L at 2, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5.
   Check positions:
     A: position 1 (not 3 -> allowed)
     E: position 3 (not 5 -> allowed? we don't know about position 3 for E? The feedback only said E is not at position 5. So position 3 is new and allowed.
     R: position 4 (not 2 -> allowed)

   Also, we avoid C and N.

 But note: we have E at position 3. We don't know if that's correct.

 Alternatively, we can try ""STARE"" but we cannot put A at position 3. So we rearrange: 
   How about ""STORE""? 
     S at 1, T at 2, O at 3, R at 4, E at 5 -> but E at position 5 is not allowed? Because we know E is not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5.

 How about ""STARE"" but without putting A at 3? We can put A at 1? Then ""ALTER"" -> A at 1, L at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.
   Check:
     A: position 1 (not 3 -> allowed)
     E: position 4 (not 5 -> allowed)
     R: position 5 (not 2 -> allowed)

   This seems okay.

 But note: we have R at position 5 and E at position 4. Also, we are testing L and T.

 However, we have to consider that the word must be valid. ""ALTER"" is a valid word.

 But wait: we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

 Another option: ""RANGE"" -> but we know N is not in the word (from first guess: N was at position 4 and we got x) so we cannot use N.

 We must avoid N.

 So ""ALTER"" seems a good candidate.

 But let me check: we have A at 1, L at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.

 We are testing:
   A at 1: if it's correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or an x? But we know A is in the word, so if it's not at 1, we get a minus.

 Similarly, we are testing L and T.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RAISE"" but we cannot put E at 5. So we skip.

 Another word: ""PARSE""
   P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, S at 4, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed.

 How about ""PRIDE""? 
   P at 1, R at 2 -> but R was at position 2 in the first guess and we got a minus meaning it is not at position 2. So we cannot put R at position 2 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not there. So we avoid.

 How about ""DRIVE""? 
   D at 1, R at 2 -> again, R at position 2 is not allowed.

 We must avoid position 2 for R.

 So let's try to put R at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But we have constraints on A and E as well.

 We can try ""RADIO"" but we need E.

 How about ""REACT""? -> but we cannot use C (because we know C is not in the word).

 We must avoid C and N.

 So let's try ""REALM"": 
   R at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> but A at position 3 is not allowed? Because we know A is not at position 3. So we avoid.

 How about ""LEARN""? 
   L at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> again, A at 3 is not allowed.

 We need to avoid position 3 for A.

 So let's try to put A at position 1? Then we can put E at position 2? and R at position 4? Then we have two letters in the middle.

 Example: ""ALERT"" (which we considered earlier) is okay.

 But let me see: ""ALERT"" has A at 1, L at 2, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5.

 Check positions:
   A: 1 (not 3 -> allowed)
   E: 3 (not 5 -> allowed)
   R: 4 (not 2 -> allowed)

 So that's acceptable.

 Another option: ""ALTER"" (as above) has A at 1, L at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.

 Both are acceptable.

 But note: we also want to test new letters. We have already used: C, R, A, N, E (from the first guess). So we should avoid C and N, but we can use other letters.

 We haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to maximize information. So we should try to include common letters that we haven't tested.

 Common consonants: S, T, L, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that has R, A, E and two new common letters.

 We can try ""STARE"" but we cannot put A at 3. So we skip.

 How about ""TARES""? 
   T at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, S at 5.
   Check:
     A: position 2 (not 3 -> allowed)
     E: position 4 (not 5 -> allowed)
     R: position 3 (not 2 -> allowed)

   This is acceptable.

 But note: we are putting A at position 2 and R at position 3. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try ""LATER"": 
   L at 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> same as ALTER but with L instead of T.

 We haven't tested L or T. So either is fine.

 I think ""LATER"" is a common word.

 But note: we have to avoid using letters we know are not present: C and N. Both ""LATER"" and ""ALTER"" are safe.

 Let me choose ""LATER"". It uses L and T, which are common.

 So my second guess: ""LATER""

 However, note: we are not forced to put R, A, E in the next guess? Actually, we know they are in the word, so we should include them to get more information about their positions.

 We are including R, A, E and two new letters L and T.

 Let's go with ""LATER"".

<guess>later</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** and **N** are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **R**, **A**, and **E** are present but in incorrect positions (marked ""-""):
  - R cannot be in position 2.
  - A cannot be in position 3.
  - E cannot be in position 5.

For the second guess, I need a word that:
- Includes **R**, **A**, and **E** (since they are confirmed present).
- Excludes **C** and **N** (since they are absent).
- Tests new positions for R, A, and E to narrow down their locations.
- Introduces new common letters (like **L** and **T**) for additional information.

The word **""LATER""** fits these criteria:
- Places **R** at position 5 (not 2).
- Places **A** at position 2 (not 3).
- Places **E** at position 4 (not 5).
- Uses **L** and **T** (common letters not yet tested).
- Avoids **C** and **N**.

This guess will help verify the positions of R, A, and E while testing two new letters.",Guess 2: later -> FEEDBACK: L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(-) R(-),FAIL

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letters C and N are not in the secret word.
 - The letters R, A, and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed.

 Since we know R, A, E are in the word, but not in the positions we had (which were positions 2, 3, and 5 respectively), we must place them elsewhere.

 Also, note that the secret word does not contain C or N.

 We have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.

 We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C or N.
   - Contains R, A, E (but not in positions 2, 3, 5? Actually, the feedback says they are in the word but not in the positions we guessed. So for R, it cannot be at position 2; for A, cannot be at position 3; for E, cannot be at position 5).

 However, note: the feedback does not prevent these letters from appearing in other positions if they are repeated? But we don't know if there are duplicates. Since we only have one occurrence in the guess, we assume at least one occurrence of each.

 We also know that the word has 5 letters and we have 3 known letters (R, A, E) and two unknown letters.

 We can try to use a word that has R, A, E in positions that are not 2, 3, 5? Actually, we can put them in any position except the ones we tried? But note: we only know that they are not in the positions we guessed. They could be in the same position again? But that would be a duplicate? We don't know.

 However, we must avoid the letters C and N.

 Let's think of words that contain R, A, E and two other letters (which are not C or N).

 Also, we want to test new positions for R, A, E and also get information about the other two letters.

 Since R was in position 2 in the first guess and now is not there, we can try R in a different position. Similarly for A and E.

 Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but not 2).
 Possible positions for A: 1, 4, 5 (but not 3).
 Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 4 (but not 5).

 We also have two more letters to guess.

 We can try to put R in position 1, A in position 4, and E in position 2? But we have to form a valid word.

 Let's try to think of words that have R, A, E and two other letters (not C, N).

 Example: ""LATER"" -> L, A, T, E, R.
 But note: we have to check the positions.

 In ""LATER"":
   L at position 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.

 But we know that A cannot be at position 3? Actually, in our first guess, A was at position 3 and we got a '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 3. So in ""LATER"", A is at position 2 which is allowed. Similarly, E is at position 4 (which is not 5, so allowed) and R is at position 5 (which is not 2, so allowed).

 However, we also have to consider that the word must be valid.

 But wait: we have to avoid C and N. ""LATER"" does not contain C or N.

 Alternatively, we could try ""RAISE"": 
   R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5 -> but E is at position 5? We know E cannot be at position 5 because in the first guess E was at position 5 and we got a '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5 again.

 Therefore, ""RAISE"" is invalid because E is at position 5.

 Another idea: ""STARE""
   S at 1, T at 2, A at 3 -> but A was at position 3 in the first guess and we know it cannot be at position 3? Actually, no: the feedback for the first guess said A is in the word but not at position 3. So we cannot put A at position 3 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not correct because the feedback already told us it's not at position 3. So we should avoid putting A at position 3.

 In ""STARE"", A is at position 3 again? So that's not allowed? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we already know it's not there. So we should try a word that puts A in a new position.

 Let's try to put A in position 1, E in position 2, and R in position 4? Example: ""AREAS"" -> but that has duplicate A? And also S at the end. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don't say, but typically in Wordle, words can have duplicate letters? However, the feedback might not indicate duplicates? Actually, the feedback per letter: if a letter appears twice, then the feedback might be tricky. But we don't have any duplicate in the first guess.

 However, we must avoid C and N.

 Another word: ""EARLY""
   E at 1, A at 2, R at 3, L at 4, Y at 5.
   But note: E is at position 1 (which is allowed), A at 2 (allowed because we only know it's not at 3), R at 3 (allowed because we only know it's not at 2). Also, we are testing new letters L and Y.

 But wait: we have E at position 1. We don't know if that's correct. We are trying to get more information.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROAST"", but we know that O and S are new, and A is at position 3? We know A cannot be at position 3? So we avoid that.

 How about ""RADIO""? 
   R at 1, A at 2, D at 3, I at 4, O at 5.
   But we know E is in the word? We don't have E in this word. We must include E because we know it's in the word.

 So we must include R, A, E.

 Another word: ""ALERT""
   A at 1, L at 2, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5.
   Check positions:
     A: position 1 (not 3 -> allowed)
     E: position 3 (not 5 -> allowed? we don't know about position 3 for E? The feedback only said E is not at position 5. So position 3 is new and allowed.
     R: position 4 (not 2 -> allowed)

   Also, we avoid C and N.

 But note: we have E at position 3. We don't know if that's correct.

 Alternatively, we can try ""STARE"" but we cannot put A at position 3. So we rearrange: 
   How about ""STORE""? 
     S at 1, T at 2, O at 3, R at 4, E at 5 -> but E at position 5 is not allowed? Because we know E is not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5.

 How about ""STARE"" but without putting A at 3? We can put A at 1? Then ""ALTER"" -> A at 1, L at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.
   Check:
     A: position 1 (not 3 -> allowed)
     E: position 4 (not 5 -> allowed)
     R: position 5 (not 2 -> allowed)

   This seems okay.

 But note: we have R at position 5 and E at position 4. Also, we are testing L and T.

 However, we have to consider that the word must be valid. ""ALTER"" is a valid word.

 But wait: we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

 Another option: ""RANGE"" -> but we know N is not in the word (from first guess: N was at position 4 and we got x) so we cannot use N.

 We must avoid N.

 So ""ALTER"" seems a good candidate.

 But let me check: we have A at 1, L at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.

 We are testing:
   A at 1: if it's correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or an x? But we know A is in the word, so if it's not at 1, we get a minus.

 Similarly, we are testing L and T.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RAISE"" but we cannot put E at 5. So we skip.

 Another word: ""PARSE""
   P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, S at 4, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed.

 How about ""PRIDE""? 
   P at 1, R at 2 -> but R was at position 2 in the first guess and we got a minus meaning it is not at position 2. So we cannot put R at position 2 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not there. So we avoid.

 How about ""DRIVE""? 
   D at 1, R at 2 -> again, R at position 2 is not allowed.

 We must avoid position 2 for R.

 So let's try to put R at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But we have constraints on A and E as well.

 We can try ""RADIO"" but we need E.

 How about ""REACT""? -> but we cannot use C (because we know C is not in the word).

 We must avoid C and N.

 So let's try ""REALM"": 
   R at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> but A at position 3 is not allowed? Because we know A is not at position 3. So we avoid.

 How about ""LEARN""? 
   L at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> again, A at 3 is not allowed.

 We need to avoid position 3 for A.

 So let's try to put A at position 1? Then we can put E at position 2? and R at position 4? Then we have two letters in the middle.

 Example: ""ALERT"" (which we considered earlier) is okay.

 But let me see: ""ALERT"" has A at 1, L at 2, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5.

 Check positions:
   A: 1 (not 3 -> allowed)
   E: 3 (not 5 -> allowed)
   R: 4 (not 2 -> allowed)

 So that's acceptable.

 Another option: ""ALTER"" (as above) has A at 1, L at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.

 Both are acceptable.

 But note: we also want to test new letters. We have already used: C, R, A, N, E (from the first guess). So we should avoid C and N, but we can use other letters.

 We haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to maximize information. So we should try to include common letters that we haven't tested.

 Common consonants: S, T, L, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that has R, A, E and two new common letters.

 We can try ""STARE"" but we cannot put A at 3. So we skip.

 How about ""TARES""? 
   T at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, S at 5.
   Check:
     A: position 2 (not 3 -> allowed)
     E: position 4 (not 5 -> allowed)
     R: position 3 (not 2 -> allowed)

   This is acceptable.

 But note: we are putting A at position 2 and R at position 3. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try ""LATER"": 
   L at 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> same as ALTER but with L instead of T.

 We haven't tested L or T. So either is fine.

 I think ""LATER"" is a common word.

 But note: we have to avoid using letters we know are not present: C and N. Both ""LATER"" and ""ALTER"" are safe.

 Let me choose ""LATER"". It uses L and T, which are common.

 So my second guess: ""LATER""

 However, note: we are not forced to put R, A, E in the next guess? Actually, we know they are in the word, so we should include them to get more information about their positions.

 We are including R, A, E and two new letters L and T.

 Let's go with ""LATER"".

<guess>later</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** and **N** are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").

But we don\'t have any duplicate in the first guess.\n\n However, we must avoid C and N.\n\n Another word: ""EARLY""\n   E at 1, A at 2, R at 3, L at 4, Y at 5.\n   But note: E is at position 1 (which is allowed), A at 2 (allowed because we only know it\'s not at 3), R at 3 (allowed because we only know it\'s not at 2). Also, we are testing new letters L and Y.\n\n But wait: we have E at position 1. We don\'t know if that\'s correct. We are trying to get more information.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""ROAST"", but we know that O and S are new, and A is at position 3? We know A cannot be at position 3? So we avoid that.\n\n How about ""RADIO""? \n   R at 1, A at 2, D at 3, I at 4, O at 5.\n   But we know E is in the word? We don\'t have E in this word. We must include E because we know it\'s in the word.\n\n So we must include R, A, E.\n\n Another word: ""ALERT""\n   A at 1, L at 2, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5.\n   Check positions:\n     A: position 1 (not 3 -> allowed)\n     E: position 3 (not 5 -> allowed? we don\'t know about position 3 for E? The feedback only said E is not at position 5. So position 3 is new and allowed.\n     R: position 4 (not 2 -> allowed)\n\n   Also, we avoid C and N.\n\n But note: we have E at position 3. We don\'t know if that\'s correct.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""STARE"" but we cannot put A at position 3. So we rearrange: \n   How about ""STORE""? \n     S at 1, T at 2, O at 3, R at 4, E at 5 -> but E at position 5 is not allowed? Because we know E is not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5.\n\n How about ""STARE"" but without putting A at 3? We can put A at 1? Then ""ALTER"" -> A at 1, L at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.\n   Check:\n     A: position 1 (not 3 -> allowed)\n     E: position 4 (not 5 -> allowed)\n     R: position 5 (not 2 -> allowed)\n\n   This seems okay.\n\n But note: we have R at position 5 and E at position 4. Also, we are testing L and T.\n\n However, we have to consider that the word must be valid. ""ALTER"" is a valid word.\n\n But wait: we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t have any indication of duplicates so far.\n\n Another option: ""RANGE"" -> but we know N is not in the word (from first guess: N was at position 4 and we got x) so we cannot use N.\n\n We must avoid N.\n\n So ""ALTER"" seems a good candidate.\n\n But let me check: we have A at 1, L at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.\n\n We are testing:\n   A at 1: if it\'s correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or an x? But we know A is in the word, so if it\'s not at 1, we get a minus.\n\n Similarly, we are testing L and T.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""RAISE"" but we cannot put E at 5. So we skip.\n\n Another word: ""PARSE""\n   P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, S at 4, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed.\n\n How about ""PRIDE""? \n   P at 1, R at 2 -> but R was at position 2 in the first guess and we got a minus meaning it is not at position 2. So we cannot put R at position 2 again? Actually, we can, but we know it\'s not there. So we avoid.\n\n How about ""DRIVE""? \n   D at 1, R at 2 -> again, R at position 2 is not allowed.\n\n We must avoid position 2 for R.\n\n So let\'s try to put R at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But we have constraints on A and E as well.\n\n We can try ""RADIO"" but we need E.\n\n How about ""REACT""? -> but we cannot use C (because we know C is not in the word).\n\n We must avoid C and N.\n\n So let\'s try ""REALM"": \n   R at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> but A at position 3 is not allowed? Because we know A is not at position 3. So we avoid.\n\n How about ""LEARN""? \n   L at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> again, A at 3 is not allowed.\n\n We need to avoid position 3 for A.\n\n So let\'s try to put A at position 1? Then we can put E at position 2? and R at position 4? Then we have two letters in the middle.\n\n Example: ""ALERT"" (which we considered earlier) is okay.\n\n But let me see: ""ALERT"" has A at 1, L at 2, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5.\n\n Check positions:\n   A: 1 (not 3 -> allowed)\n   E: 3 (not 5 -> allowed)\n   R: 4 (not 2 -> allowed)\n\n So that\'s acceptable.\n\n Another option: ""ALTER"" (as above) has A at 1, L at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.\n\n Both are acceptable.\n\n But note: we also want to test new letters. We have already used: C, R, A, N, E (from the first guess). So we should avoid C and N, but we can use other letters.\n\n We haven\'t used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We want to maximize information. So we should try to include common letters that we haven\'t tested.\n\n Common consonants: S, T, L, etc.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that has R, A, E and two new common letters.\n\n We can try ""STARE"" but we cannot put A at 3. So we skip.\n\n How about ""TARES""? \n   T at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, S at 5.\n   Check:\n     A: position 2 (not 3 -> allowed)\n     E: position 4 (not 5 -> allowed)\n     R: position 3 (not 2 -> allowed)\n\n   This is acceptable.\n\n But note: we are putting A at position 2 and R at position 3. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""LATER"": \n   L at 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> same as ALTER but with L instead of T.\n\n We haven\'t tested L or T. So either is fine.\n\n I think ""LATER"" is a common word.\n\n But note: we have to avoid using letters we know are not present: C and N. Both ""LATER"" and ""ALTER"" are safe.\n\n Let me choose ""LATER"". It uses L and T, which are common.\n\n So my second guess: ""LATER""\n\n However, note: we are not forced to put R, A, E in the next guess? Actually, we know they are in the word, so we should include them to get more information about their positions.\n\n We are including R, A, E and two new letters L and T.\n\n Let\'s go with ""LATER"".\n\n<guess>later</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C** and **N** are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- **R**, **A**, and **E** are present but in incorrect positions (marked ""-""):\n  - R cannot be in position 2.\n  - A cannot be in position 3.\n  - E cannot be in position 5.\n\nFor the second guess, I need a word that:\n- Includes **R**, **A**, and **E** (since they are confirmed present).\n- Excludes **C** and **N** (since they are absent).\n- Tests new positions for R, A, and E to narrow down their locations.\n- Introduces new common letters (like **L** and **T**) for additional information.\n\nThe word **""LATER""** fits these criteria:\n- Places **R** at position 5 (not 2).\n- Places **A** at position 2 (not 3).\n- Places **E** at position 4 (not 5).\n- Uses **L** and **T** (common letters not yet tested).\n- Avoids **C** and **N**.\n\nThis guess will help verify the positions of R, A, and E while testing two new letters.\n\n<guess>later</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: later -> FEEDBACK: L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(-) R(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)

Guess 2: ""later""
- L: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 2)  [since it was in position 2 and got a minus]
- T: ✓ (correct, in position 3)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 4)  [since it was in position 4 and got a minus]
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 5)  [since it was in position 5 and got a minus]

What we know so far:
- The secret word contains: R, A, E (from first guess) and we now know T is in the word and in position 3 (from second guess).
- The secret word does not contain: C, N, L (from both guesses).
- Position 3 is T.

Also, from the first guess, we knew:
- R is not in position 2.
- A is not in position 3.
- E is not in position 5.

From the second guess:
- A is not in position 2 (because we put it in position 2 and got a minus).
- E is not in position 4 (because we put it in position 4 and got a minus).
- R is not in position 5 (because we put it in position 5 and got a minus).

So now we know:
- T is fixed at position 3.

We also know that R, A, E are in the word, but:
- R is not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 5 (from second guess). So R must be in position 1 or 4? (since position 3 is taken by T).
  But note: the word has 5 positions. Position 3 is T. So R can be in position 1, 4, or possibly 5? But we just learned R is not in position 5. So R must be in position 1 or 4.

- A is in the word but not in position 3 (from first guess) and not in position 2 (from second guess). So A can be in position 1, 4, or 5? But note: position 3 is taken by T, so A can be in 1, 4, or 5.

- E is in the word but not in position 5 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess). So E can be in position 1, 2, or 3? But position 3 is T, so E can be in position 1 or 2.

We also know the word does not contain: C, N, L.

Now, we have to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Has T in position 3.
- Includes R, A, E.
- Excludes C, N, L.
- And we need to test the possible positions for R, A, E.

We also need to find the two remaining letters.

Let's list the constraints for each known letter:
- R: must be in position 1 or 4 (since 2 and 5 are ruled out, and 3 is taken by T).
- A: must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (but not 2 or 3).
- E: must be in position 1 or 2 (since not 4 or 5, and 3 is taken).

But note: the word must have exactly these letters? Actually, we know the word has R, A, E, and T, and two more letters that we haven't found.

We also know that the word does not have C, N, L.

We can try to form a word that satisfies these conditions and tests the possible positions.

We have two unknown letters. We should try to use common letters that we haven't tested: for example, S, D, H, I, O, U, etc.

We also need to consider the positions.

Let's try to put E in position 1 and R in position 4? Then we have:
Position 1: E
Position 2: ? (must be a letter not in {C, N, L} and not conflicting)
Position 3: T (fixed)
Position 4: R
Position 5: ? (must be a letter not in {C, N, L} and not conflicting)

But we also have A to place. A can be in 1,4,5? But position 1 is taken by E, so A can be in 4 or 5.

If we put E in 1 and R in 4, then A must be in 5? Because positions 2 and 3 are taken by unknown letters and A cannot be in 2 or 3? Actually, A can be in 1,4,5 but 1 is taken, so 4 or 5.

But we also have to consider that the unknown letters in position 2 and 5 must not be C, N, L.

Let's try to form a word: E _ T R _ 
But we need to fill the blanks. And A must be in the word. So if we put A in position 5, then we have E _ T R A.

What letter can we put in position 2? We need a letter that is not C, N, L and not conflicting.

We can try ""EATER"":
- E at 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but R is at position 5? We know R is not at position 5 (from second guess: R at 5 got a minus). So we cannot put R at 5.

We must avoid putting R at 5.

So if we put R at 4, then we have E _ T R A. The letter in position 2 must be a letter that is not C, N, L and not conflicting.

What about ""EATER""? It has E at 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but R at 5 is not allowed. So skip.

We need to put R at 4, so the word would be E ? T R A? But then we have A at 5. Is that allowed? Yes, because A can be at 5.

But we have two E's? We don't know if the word has two E's? The first guess had only one E and it was marked present, but that doesn't rule out two E's. However, we have to be cautious.

But let's see: if we put E at 1 and R at 4, and A at 5, then the word is E _ T R A.

We need to fill the second position. What letter? It must be a letter that is not C, N, L and not conflicting.

We can try ""ENTER"": but N is not allowed (from first guess: N is absent). So skip.

We can try ""EIGHT"": but that has G and H, which are new. But the word would be E I G H T? But position 3 is T, so that would be E I G H T? But we need to have R in the word? We are putting R at 4? In ""EIGHT"", there is no R. So we must include R.

We must include R, A, and E.

So the word must have R, A, E, T, and one more letter (since it's 5 letters).

We have to put T at 3.

So the structure: 
Position 1: ? (or E? but we are considering E at 1)
Position 2: ? (must be a letter not in {C, N, L} and not conflicting)
Position 3: T
Position 4: R (if we put R at 4) or another letter?
Position 5: ? (and A must be here? or another letter? but A can be at 5)

But we have to put A somewhere. If we put R at 4, then A must be at 1 or 5? But position 1: if we put E at 1, then A cannot be at 1. So A must be at 5? Then the word would be E ? T R A.

But we need to fill position 2. What letter? It must be a letter not in {C, N, L} and not conflicting.

We can try ""EATER"" but R at 5 is not allowed.

Alternatively, we can put R at position 1? Then we have:
Position 1: R
Position 2: ? (must be a letter not in {C, N, L} and not conflicting)
Position 3: T
Position 4: ? 
Position 5: ? 

And A must be in the word. A can be in 4 or 5? But if we put R at 1, then A cannot be at 1. So A can be at 4 or 5.

If we put A at 4, then the word: R ? T A ? 
But we need to fill position 2 and 5.

If we put A at 5, then R ? T ? A.

We also have E to place. E can be in 1 or 2? But if we put R at 1, then E can be in 2.

So two possibilities:
1. R ? T E A (with E at 4 and A at 5)
2. R ? T A ? (with A at 4 and E at 2? or at 5? but if A at 4, then E can be at 2? but we have position 5 open)

But note: we have to avoid putting E at 4? We don't know if E can be at 4? Actually, we know from the second guess that E is not at position 4 (because we put it at 4 and got a minus). So E cannot be at 4. Therefore, in the first possibility, E is at 4, which is not allowed? So that's invalid.

Therefore, in the first possibility, we cannot put E at 4. So we have to put E at 2? Then the word: R E T A ? 

But then we have A at 4 and E at 2? Then position 5 is open.

So one possibility: R E T A ?

But we need a word. ""RETAB"" is not a word. ""RETAB"" is not a word.

Alternatively, we can put R at 1, E at 2, and A at 4? Then the word: R E T A ?

But we need a word. ""RETAB"" is not a word.

We need valid words.

Another idea: put E at 1 and R at 4? Then we have E ? T R A.

What words end with ""ETRA""? Not common. 

Put R at 4 and A at 1? But A cannot be at 1? Wait, no: A can be at 1? We haven't tried that. But we have E to place. If we put A at 1, then we have:
Position 1: A (but we know A is not at 2 or 3, but 1 is allowed? We haven't tried A at 1. But we know A is not at 2 or 3, so 1 is a possibility.)
Position 2: ? 
Position 3: T
Position 4: R
Position 5: ?

But we have to include E. E can be at 1 or 2? But if we put A at 1, then E cannot be at 1? So E must be at 2.

So the word: A E T R ? 

But we need a word. ""AETRA"" is not a word.

Alternatively, we can put R at 1 and A at 5? Then E must be at 2 (since it can be at 1 or 2, but 1 is taken by R). So:
Position 1: R
Position 2: E
Position 3: T
Position 4: ? 
Position 5: A

Then the word: R E T ? A

What words? ""RETIA"" (not common), ""REATA"" (not common), ""RESTA"" (not a word), ""RETSA"" (not common), ""REATA"" (not common). 

This is difficult.

Put R at 4 and A at 5? Then:
Position 1: ? 
Position 2: ? 
Position 3: T
Position 4: R
Position 5: A

And E must be at 1 or 2? But position 1: if we put E, then the word: E ? T R A.

What words? ""ETRA"" at the end? ""EATER"" is E A T E R -> but that has A at 2 and E at 4? But we are putting A at 5 and E at 1? So that doesn't match.

We need E at 1: so ""E _ T R A"". Words: ""EATER"" is E A T E R -> but that has A at 2 and E at 4? Not matching.

Actually, we need the pattern: E ? T R A -> so the second letter is unknown.

Words: ""EIGHT"" is E I G H T -> no R and no A? But we must have A.

We need a word that has E, T, R, A. But we have T at 3, R at 4, A at 5, and E at 1.

So the word must be: E ? T R A.

What letters can we put in the second position? We need a letter that is not C, N, L and not conflicting.

Possible words: 
- ""EATER"": but that has A at 2 and E at 4? No, that's E A T E R -> positions: E(1), A(2), T(3), E(4), R(5). But we need R at 4 and A at 5? So that doesn't match.

We need R at 4 and A at 5: so the word must end with ""RA"". But then the last two letters are R and A? So the word is ... R A.

But we have E at 1, then a letter at 2, then T at 3, then R at 4, then A at 5.

So the word: E X T R A, where X is the unknown letter.

What words? ""ENTER"" is E N T E R -> but N is not allowed and also E at 4? Not matching.

We need a word that has the pattern E X T R A.

Possible words: 
- ""EATER"" is E A T E R -> but that has A at 2 and E at 4? And R at 5? But we need R at 4 and A at 5? So no.

Another: ""EXTRA"": 
- X = E, then position 2: X = E? But we are putting E at 1? Then the word would be E X T R A. If X = E, then we have E at 1, E at 2? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, ""EXTRA"" has X = E, then position 2 is X? So E at 1 and E at 2? But we don't know if the word has two E's.

But let's check the feedback: in the first guess, we had E and it was present, but we don't know if there is a second E. Similarly, in the second guess, we had E and it was present but not at 4.

But we also have to consider that the word must have exactly the letters: E, T, R, A, and one more.

We know the word has R, A, E, T, and one more. So if we allow two E's, then ""EXTRA"" has two E's? But ""EXTRA"" is E X T R A -> so positions: E(1), X(2), T(3), R(4), A(5). This matches the pattern.

But we have to check if X can be E? We don't know if the word has two E's. But it's possible.

However, we have to avoid C, N, L. ""EXTRA"" has X (which is not C, N, L) and E at 1 and 2? But we are only required to have one E? Actually, the feedback from the first guess had only one E and it was marked present, but that doesn't rule out two E's. The feedback for the second guess also had only one E and it was marked present (but not at 4). So it could have two E's.

But we also have to consider the feedback: if the word had two E's, then in the second guess (when we put E at 4) we would have gotten a minus for E? But if there is an E at 1, then when we put E at 4, we get a minus because the E is present but not at 4. Similarly, if there is an E at 2, then we get a minus for E at 4? But we don't know if there are two E's.

However, we must avoid using letters we know are absent: C, N, L. ""EXTRA"" has X and E, T, R, A. X is not forbidden.

But we have to check if E is allowed at position 1? We don't have any feedback that E cannot be at 1. We only know E is not at 4 or 5.

Similarly, R is at 4: we know R is not at 2 or 5, so 4 is allowed.

A is at 5: we know A is not at 2 or 3, so 5 is allowed.

So ""EXTRA"" is a candidate.

But let me see if there are other possibilities.

Another candidate: put R at 1 and A at 4? Then we have:
Position 1: R
Position 2: ? 
Position 3: T
Position 4: A
Position 5: ? 

And E must be at 1 or 2? But position 1: if we put E, then word: E X T A ? 

What words? ""ETAMA"" (not common), ""ETALA"" (not common). 

Or if we put E at 2: then word: X E T A ? 

What words? ""SETAE"" (not common), ""METAL"" -> but L is not allowed. 

So ""EXTRA"" seems a good candidate.

But wait: in ""EXTRA"", we have two E's. We don't know if that's allowed. But it's possible.

Another candidate: put R at 4 and A at 1? But A at 1 is allowed? Then we have:
Position 1: A
Position 2: ? 
Position 3: T
Position 4: R
Position 5: ? 

And E must be at 1 or 2? But position 1 is taken by A, so E must be at 2.

So the word: A E T R ? 

What words? ""AETRA"" (not common), ""AETER"" (not common). 

Or if we put E at 1: then A at 2? But A cannot be at 2? We know A is not at 2 (from second guess: we put A at 2 and got a minus). So A cannot be at 2. Therefore, we cannot put A at 2.

So if we put A at 1, then E at 2: then the word: A E T R ? 

What words? ""AETRA"" (not common), ""AETER"" (not common). 

Alternatively, put R at 1 and A at 4? Then:
Position 1: R
Position 2: ? 
Position 3: T
Position 4: A
Position 5: ? 

And E must be at 1 or 2? But position 1: if we put E, then word: E X T A ? 

What words? ""ETALA"" (not common), ""ETAMA"" (not common). 

Or if we put E at 2: then position 1 is something else. But we need a word. ""X E T A ?"" -> ""SETAE"" (not common). 

So ""EXTRA"" seems a good candidate.

But let me check if there are other words that fit the pattern without duplicates.

What about ""ARTET""? Not a word.

Or ""RESTA"" -> but R is at 1, E at 2, S at 3? But position 3 must be T. So no.

Another idea: put R at 1 and E at 2? Then we have:
Position 1: R
Position 2: E
Position 3: T
Position 4: ? 
Position 5: ? 

And A must be at 4 or 5? But we have two positions: 4 and 5. And we can put A at 4 and then a new letter at 5? Or A at 5 and a new letter at 4.

But we also have to include A. So we can put A at 4 and then a new letter at 5.

But we need a word: ? E T ? A -> but we need to put a letter at 1 and 4? And we know R is in the word, so we can put R at 1? But we are already using R at 1? And we are trying to test R at 1? But we haven't tried R at 1.

Actually, we can try R at 1, E at 2, T at 3, and then for position 4 and 5, we put A and a new letter? But we have to put A in the word. So if we put A at 4, then position 5 is open. But we also have to include E? We have E at 2, so that's one E. Then we have A at 4 and a new letter at 5.

But we need a word: R E T A ? -> but that's 5 letters? R E T A ? -> ""RETA"" is not 5 letters. 

We need a 5-letter word. ""RETA"" is 4 letters.

How about ""REATA""? But that's 5 letters? R E A T A -> but that has A at 3? We know A cannot be at 3. Also, we are putting A at 3? But we know A is not at 3. So we cannot put A at 3.

In our structure, if we put R at 1, E at 2, T at 3, then we have positions 4 and 5. We want to put A at 4? But then we have two A's? Or we put A at 5.

So if we put A at 4? But we don't know if A can be at 4. We haven't tried that. But we know A is not at 2 or 3, so 4 is possible.

But we also have to consider that the word must have the letter A. So we can put A at 4? Then the word: R E T A ?

What words? ""RETA"" is 4 letters. We need 5. ""RETAS"" -> but S at 5? And we have A at 4? Then the word: R E T A S -> ""RETAS"" is a word? It's the plural ofreta? Not common. 

""RETA"" is not 5.

Another word: ""RESTA"" -> but R E S T A -> position 3 is S? But we need position 3 to be T. So no.

So it's hard to find a word with R at 1, E at 2, T at 3, and A at 4? Because then we have ""RETA"" with a letter in between? But we need a word like ""RETA"" plus one letter? Not possible.

Therefore, the only candidate I see is ""EXTRA"".

But let me confirm: 
- E at 1: we don't know if E can be at 1? We only know E is not at 4 or 5. So it can be at 1.
- X: we don't know, but it must be a letter not in {C, N, L} and not conflicting.
- T at 3: fixed.
- R at 4: we know R is not at 2 or 5, so 4 is allowed.
- A at 5: we know A is not at 2 or 3, so 5 is allowed.

And we are testing:
- If E is at 1: if it is, we get a check? But we don't know.
- We are testing X (which is the second letter) and also the position of E at 1.

But note: we are also testing the position of R at 4 and A at 5.

We can also test a new letter at position 2.

But we have to avoid using forbidden letters: C, N, L.

So ""EXTRA"" is a valid word and fits the constraints.

But wait: in ""EXTRA"", the second letter is X. We haven't tested X. And we know the word has R, A, E, T, and one more. If X is not the fifth letter? Actually, ""EXTRA"" has 5 letters: E, X, T, R, A.

So the fifth letter is A. We know A is in the word, so that's fine.

But we have to consider: what if the word has only one E? Then ""EXTRA"" has two E's? That might be a problem? But the feedback so far hasn't indicated duplicates, but it's possible.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't duplicate E to test the positions without assuming duplicates.

But we have to include all the known letters: R, A, E, T.

We have T fixed at 3.

We can try to put R at 1, A at 4, and E at 2? But we couldn't find a word.

Another candidate: put R at 4, A at 1, and E at 2? But we have to fill position 5.

So structure: A E T R ? 

What words? ""AETER"" (not common), ""AETRA"" (not common). 

Or put A at 1, E at 2, R at 4, and then position 5 is open. But we need a word: A E T R ? 

""AETR?"" -> not a word.

Put R at 1, E at 2, and A at 4? Then we have A at 4? Then the word: R E T A ? 

But we need a word. ""RETA"" is 4 letters. We need 5. ""RETAB"" is not a word. ""RETAQ"" not a word.

So I think ""EXTRA"" is a good choice.

But let me think of other words that have T at 3 and include R, A, E.

For example: ""PARTY"" -> but no R and no E? We must have R and A and E.

Another: ""ARTSY"" -> no R, E, A? 

We must have the letters R, A, E.

So let's go with ""EXTRA"".

But note: in ""EXTRA"", we are putting E at 1. We don't know if that's correct. We are testing R at 4 and A at 5.

If we get feedback that E is correct at 1, then we know. Similarly for others.

But we also test the letter X.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses more new letters to get information.

But we have to include the known letters.

Another word: ""TARES"" -> but we know T is at 3, so we cannot put T at 5? And we have T at 3 fixed. Also, we have to avoid using N (which is absent). So skip.

""TARES"" has T at 1? But we don't have T at 3 fixed? In ""TARES"", T is at 1, so that wouldn't work because position 3 is not T.

We must have T at position 3.

So the word must have T at 3.

Another word: ""STARE"" -> but we know A is not at 3? And in ""STARE"", A is at 3? So we cannot put A at 3. Also, we have to avoid using S? We haven't tested S, but we can use it. But in ""STARE"", A is at 3, which is not allowed.

We cannot put A at 3.

How about ""STEAR""? But that's not a common word. And it has E at 4? But we know E is not at 4? From second guess, E at 4 got a minus. So we cannot put E at 4.

So we must avoid putting E at 4 and A at 2,3,4,5? But we can put A at 4 or 5, and E at 1 or 2.

But in ""STEAR"", if we put E at 4? Not allowed.

So back to ""EXTRA"".

Another candidate: ""DATER"" -> D A T E R -> but we have A at 2? We know A is not at 2 (from second guess: we put A at 2 and got a minus). So we cannot put A at 2.

In ""DATER"", A is at 2 -> not allowed.

""RATER"": R A T E R -> but R at 1 and 5? We know R is not at 5. Also, A at 2 -> not allowed.

So ""EXTRA"" seems a good choice.

But let me check: in ""EXTRA"", we have:
- E at 1: we are testing if E is at 1.
- X at 2: new letter.
- T at 3: fixed and correct.
- R at 4: testing if R is at 4.
- A at 5: testing if A is at 5.

We also test X.

If we get:
- E at 1: if it's correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or x? But we know E is in the word, so if not at 1, we get a minus.

Similarly for R at 4 and A at 5.

And we get information about X.

But note: we are putting R at 4. We know R is in the word, so if it's not at 4, we get a minus. Similarly for A at 5.

We also get information about X.

So I think it's a good guess.

But wait: we have to avoid using forbidden letters. X is not forbidden? We haven't tested X and it's not C, N, L.

So let's go with ""EXTRA"".

But note: we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""EXTRA"" is a valid word.

So my third guess: ""EXTRA""

But let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters.

Another candidate: ""STEAR"" -> but that's not common and E at 4 is not allowed.

""STARE"" is not allowed because A at 3.

""TRIED"" -> T R I E D -> but R is at 2? We know R is not at 2. So we cannot put R at 2.

We must avoid putting R at 2.

In ""TRIED"", R is at 2 -> not allowed.

""TRIBE"" -> no R and no A? 

I think ""EXTRA"" is acceptable.

So I'll go with ""EXTRA"".

But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don't have evidence for duplicates, but it's possible.

Alternatively, we can try ""DRAFT"" -> but no E? We must include E.

We must include all the known letters: R, A, E, T.

So ""EXTRA"" includes all.

Therefore, the next guess is ""EXTRA"".

</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)  
  - **C** and **N** are absent from the secret word.  
  - **R**, **A**, and **E** are present but in incorrect positions:  
    - R cannot be in position 2.  
    - A cannot be in position 3.  
    - E cannot be in position 5.  

- **Guess 2: later** → Feedback: L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(-) R(-)  
  - **L** is absent.  
  - **T** is correct and in position 3 (fixed).  
  - **A** is present but not in position 2.  
  - **E** is present but not in position 4.  
  - **R** is present but not in position 5.  

### Analysis:
- **Confirmed letters**: R, A, E, T (T is fixed at position 3).  
- **Absent letters**: C, N, L.  
- **Position constraints**:  
  - R: Cannot be in positions 2 or 5 → must be in 1 or 4.  
  - A: Cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → must be in 1, 4, or 5.  
  - E: Cannot be in positions 4 or 5 → must be in 1 or 2.  
- **Unknowns**: Two additional letters (not C, N, L) need to be discovered.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test the possible positions for R, A, and E while introducing new common letters.  
- **""extra""** is chosen because:  
  - Fits the position constraints:  
    - E at position 1 (tests if E is in position 1).  
    - R at position 4 (tests if R is in position 4).  
    - A at position 5 (tests if A is in position 5).  
  - Includes all known letters (R, A, E, T) and avoids absent letters (C, N, L).  
  - Uses new common letters (X) for position 2 to test for presence/absence and position.  
- If E is not in position 1, we get feedback on E's correct position. Similarly, R and A positions will be narrowed down.  

<guess>extra</guess>",extra,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)

Guess 2: ""later""
- L: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 2)  [since it was in position 2 and got a minus]
- T: ✓ (correct, in position 3)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 4)  [since it was in position 4 and got a minus]
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 5)  [since it was in position 5 and got a minus]

What we know so far:
- The secret word contains: R, A, E (from first guess) and we now know T is in the word and in position 3 (from second guess).
- The secret word does not contain: C, N, L (from both guesses).
- Position 3 is T.

Also, from the first guess, we knew:
- R is not in position 2.
- A is not in position 3.
- E is not in position 5.

From the second guess:
- A is not in position 2 (because we put it in position 2 and got a minus).
- E is not in position 4 (because we put it in position 4 and got a minus).
- R is not in position 5 (because we put it in position 5 and got a minus).

So now we know:
- T is fixed at position 3.

We also know that R, A, E are in the word, but:
- R is not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 5 (from second guess). So R must be in position 1 or 4? (since position 3 is taken by T).
  But note: the word has 5 positions. Position 3 is T. So R can be in position 1, 4, or possibly 5? But we just learned R is not in position 5. So R must be in position 1 or 4.

- A is in the word but not in position 3 (from first guess) and not in position 2 (from second guess). So A can be in position 1, 4, or 5? But note: position 3 is taken by T, so A can be in 1, 4, or 5.

- E is in the word but not in position 5 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess). So E can be in position 1, 2, or 3? But position 3 is T, so E can be in position 1 or 2.

We also know the word does not contain: C, N, L.

Now, we have to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Has T in position 3.
- Includes R, A, E.
- Excludes C, N, L.
- And we need to test the possible positions for R, A, E.

We also need to find the two remaining letters.

Let's list the constraints for each known letter:
- R: must be in position 1 or 4 (since 2 and 5 are ruled out, and 3 is taken by T).
- A: must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (but not 2 or 3).
- E: must be in position 1 or 2 (since not 4 or 5, and 3 is taken).

But note: the word must have exactly these letters? Actually, we know the word has R, A, E, and T, and two more letters that we haven't found.

We also know that the word does not have C, N, L.

We can try to form a word that satisfies these conditions and tests the possible positions.

We have two unknown letters. We should try to use common letters that we haven't tested: for example, S, D, H, I, O, U, etc.

We also need to consider the positions.

Let's try to put E in position 1 and R in position 4? Then we have:
Position 1: E
Position 2: ? (must be a letter not in {C, N, L} and not conflicting)
Position 3: T (fixed)
Position 4: R
Position 5: ? (must be a letter not in {C, N, L} and not conflicting)

But we also have A to place. A can be in 1,4,5? But position 1 is taken by E, so A can be in 4 or 5.

If we put E in 1 and R in 4, then A must be in 5? Because positions 2 and 3 are taken by unknown letters and A cannot be in 2 or 3? Actually, A can be in 1,4,5 but 1 is taken, so 4 or 5.

But we also have to consider that the unknown letters in position 2 and 5 must not be C, N, L.

Let's try to form a word: E _ T R _ 
But we need to fill the blanks. And A must be in the word. So if we put A in position 5, then we have E _ T R A.

What letter can we put in position 2? We need a letter that is not C, N, L and not conflicting.

We can try ""EATER"":
- E at 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but R is at position 5? We know R is not at position 5 (from second guess: R at 5 got a minus). So we cannot put R at 5.

We must avoid putting R at 5.

So if we put R at 4, then we have E _ T R A. The letter in position 2 must be a letter that is not C, N, L and not conflicting.

What about ""EATER""? It has E at 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but R at 5 is not allowed. So skip.

We need to put R at 4, so the word would be E ? T R A? But then we have A at 5. Is that allowed? Yes, because A can be at 5.

But we have two E's? We don't know if the word has two E's? The first guess had only one E and it was marked present, but that doesn't rule out two E's. However, we have to be cautious.

But let's see: if we put E at 1 and R at 4, and A at 5, then the word is E _ T R A.

We need to fill the second position. What letter? It must be a letter that is not C, N, L and not conflicting.

We can try ""ENTER"": but N is not allowed (from first guess: N is absent). So skip.

We can try ""EIGHT"": but that has G and H, which are new. But the word would be E I G H T? But position 3 is T, so that would be E I G H T? But we need to have R in the word? We are putting R at 4? In ""EIGHT"", there is no R. So we must include R.

We must include R, A, and E.

So the word must have R, A, E, T, and one more letter (since it's 5 letters).

We have to put T at 3.

So the structure: 
Position 1: ? (or E? but we are considering E at 1)
Position 2: ? (must be a letter not in {C, N, L} and not conflicting)
Position 3: T
Position 4: R (if we put R at 4) or another letter?
Position 5: ? (and A must be here? or another letter? but A can be at 5)

But we have to put A somewhere. If we put R at 4, then A must be at 1 or 5? But position 1: if we put E at 1, then A cannot be at 1. So A must be at 5? Then the word would be E ? T R A.

But we need to fill position 2. What letter? It must be a letter not in {C, N, L} and not conflicting.

We can try ""EATER"" but R at 5 is not allowed.

Alternatively, we can put R at position 1? Then we have:
Position 1: R
Position 2: ? (must be a letter not in {C, N, L} and not conflicting)
Position 3: T
Position 4: ? 
Position 5: ? 

And A must be in the word. A can be in 4 or 5? But if we put R at 1, then A cannot be at 1. So A can be at 4 or 5.

If we put A at 4, then the word: R ? T A ? 
But we need to fill position 2 and 5.

If we put A at 5, then R ? T ? A.

We also have E to place. E can be in 1 or 2? But if we put R at 1, then E can be in 2.

So two possibilities:
1. R ? T E A (with E at 4 and A at 5)
2. R ? T A ? (with A at 4 and E at 2? or at 5? but if A at 4, then E can be at 2? but we have position 5 open)

But note: we have to avoid putting E at 4? We don't know if E can be at 4? Actually, we know from the second guess that E is not at position 4 (because we put it at 4 and got a minus). So E cannot be at 4. Therefore, in the first possibility, E is at 4, which is not allowed? So that's invalid.

Therefore, in the first possibility, we cannot put E at 4. So we have to put E at 2? Then the word: R E T A ? 

But then we have A at 4 and E at 2? Then position 5 is open.

So one possibility: R E T A ?

But we need a word. ""RETAB"" is not a word. ""RETAB"" is not a word.

Alternatively, we can put R at 1, E at 2, and A at 4? Then the word: R E T A ?

But we need a word. ""RETAB"" is not a word.

We need valid words.

Another idea: put E at 1 and R at 4? Then we have E ? T R A.

What words end with ""ETRA""? Not common. 

Put R at 4 and A at 1? But A cannot be at 1? Wait, no: A can be at 1? We haven't tried that. But we have E to place. If we put A at 1, then we have:
Position 1: A (but we know A is not at 2 or 3, but 1 is allowed? We haven't tried A at 1. But we know A is not at 2 or 3, so 1 is a possibility.)
Position 2: ? 
Position 3: T
Position 4: R
Position 5: ?

But we have to include E. E can be at 1 or 2? But if we put A at 1, then E cannot be at 1? So E must be at 2.

So the word: A E T R ? 

But we need a word. ""AETRA"" is not a word.

Alternatively, we can put R at 1 and A at 5? Then E must be at 2 (since it can be at 1 or 2, but 1 is taken by R). So:
Position 1: R
Position 2: E
Position 3: T
Position 4: ? 
Position 5: A

Then the word: R E T ? A

What words? ""RETIA"" (not common), ""REATA"" (not common), ""RESTA"" (not a word), ""RETSA"" (not common), ""REATA"" (not common). 

This is difficult.

Put R at 4 and A at 5? Then:
Position 1: ? 
Position 2: ? 
Position 3: T
Position 4: R
Position 5: A

And E must be at 1 or 2? But position 1: if we put E, then the word: E ? T R A.

What words? ""ETRA"" at the end? ""EATER"" is E A T E R -> but that has A at 2 and E at 4? But we are putting A at 5 and E at 1? So that doesn't match.

We need E at 1: so ""E _ T R A"". Words: ""EATER"" is E A T E R -> but that has A at 2 and E at 4? Not matching.

Actually, we need the pattern: E ? T R A -> so the second letter is unknown.

Words: ""EIGHT"" is E I G H T -> no R and no A? But we must have A.

We need a word that has E, T, R, A. But we have T at 3, R at 4, A at 5, and E at 1.

So the word must be: E ? T R A.

What letters can we put in the second position? We need a letter that is not C, N, L and not conflicting.

Possible words: 
- ""EATER"": but that has A at 2 and E at 4? No, that's E A T E R -> positions: E(1), A(2), T(3), E(4), R(5). But we need R at 4 and A at 5? So that doesn't match.

We need R at 4 and A at 5: so the word must end with ""RA"". But then the last two letters are R and A? So the word is ... R A.

But we have E at 1, then a letter at 2, then T at 3, then R at 4, then A at 5.

So the word: E X T R A, where X is the unknown letter.

What words? ""ENTER"" is E N T E R -> but N is not allowed and also E at 4? Not matching.

We need a word that has the pattern E X T R A.

Possible words: 
- ""EATER"" is E A T E R -> but that has A at 2 and E at 4? And R at 5? But we need R at 4 and A at 5? So no.

Another: ""EXTRA"": 
- X = E, then position 2: X = E? But we are putting E at 1? Then the word would be E X T R A. If X = E, then we have E at 1, E at 2? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, ""EXTRA"" has X = E, then position 2 is X? So E at 1 and E at 2? But we don't know if the word has two E's.

But let's check the feedback: in the first guess, we had E and it was present, but we don't know if there is a second E. Similarly, in the second guess, we had E and it was present but not at 4.

But we also have to consider that the word must have exactly the letters: E, T, R, A, and one more.

We know the word has R, A, E, T, and one more. So if we allow two E's, then ""EXTRA"" has two E's? But ""EXTRA"" is E X T R A -> so positions: E(1), X(2), T(3), R(4), A(5). This matches the pattern.

But we have to check if X can be E? We don't know if the word has two E's. But it's possible.

However, we have to avoid C, N, L. ""EXTRA"" has X (which is not C, N, L) and E at 1 and 2? But we are only required to have one E? Actually, the feedback from the first guess had only one E and it was marked present, but that doesn't rule out two E's. The feedback for the second guess also had only one E and it was marked present (but not at 4). So it could have two E's.

But we also have to consider the feedback: if the word had two E's, then in the second guess (when we put E at 4) we would have gotten a minus for E? But if there is an E at 1, then when we put E at 4, we get a minus because the E is present but not at 4. Similarly, if there is an E at 2, then we get a minus for E at 4? But we don't know if there are two E's.

However, we must avoid using letters we know are absent: C, N, L. ""EXTRA"" has X and E, T, R, A. X is not forbidden.

But we have to check if E is allowed at position 1? We don't have any feedback that E cannot be at 1. We only know E is not at 4 or 5.

Similarly, R is at 4: we know R is not at 2 or 5, so 4 is allowed.

A is at 5: we know A is not at 2 or 3, so 5 is allowed.

So ""EXTRA"" is a candidate.

But let me see if there are other possibilities.

Another candidate: put R at 1 and A at 4? Then we have:
Position 1: R
Position 2: ? 
Position 3: T
Position 4: A
Position 5: ? 

And E must be at 1 or 2? But position 1: if we put E, then word: E X T A ? 

What words? ""ETAMA"" (not common), ""ETALA"" (not common). 

Or if we put E at 2: then word: X E T A ? 

What words? ""SETAE"" (not common), ""METAL"" -> but L is not allowed. 

So ""EXTRA"" seems a good candidate.

But wait: in ""EXTRA"", we have two E's. We don't know if that's allowed. But it's possible.

Another candidate: put R at 4 and A at 1? But A at 1 is allowed? Then we have:
Position 1: A
Position 2: ? 
Position 3: T
Position 4: R
Position 5: ? 

And E must be at 1 or 2? But position 1 is taken by A, so E must be at 2.

So the word: A E T R ? 

What words? ""AETRA"" (not common), ""AETER"" (not common). 

Or if we put E at 1: then A at 2? But A cannot be at 2? We know A is not at 2 (from second guess: we put A at 2 and got a minus). So A cannot be at 2. Therefore, we cannot put A at 2.

So if we put A at 1, then E at 2: then the word: A E T R ? 

What words? ""AETRA"" (not common), ""AETER"" (not common). 

Alternatively, put R at 1 and A at 4? Then:
Position 1: R
Position 2: ? 
Position 3: T
Position 4: A
Position 5: ? 

And E must be at 1 or 2? But position 1: if we put E, then word: E X T A ? 

What words? ""ETALA"" (not common), ""ETAMA"" (not common). 

Or if we put E at 2: then position 1 is something else. But we need a word. ""X E T A ?"" -> ""SETAE"" (not common). 

So ""EXTRA"" seems a good candidate.

But let me check if there are other words that fit the pattern without duplicates.

What about ""ARTET""? Not a word.

Or ""RESTA"" -> but R is at 1, E at 2, S at 3? But position 3 must be T. So no.

Another idea: put R at 1 and E at 2? Then we have:
Position 1: R
Position 2: E
Position 3: T
Position 4: ? 
Position 5: ? 

And A must be at 4 or 5? But we have two positions: 4 and 5. And we can put A at 4 and then a new letter at 5? Or A at 5 and a new letter at 4.

But we also have to include A. So we can put A at 4 and then a new letter at 5.

But we need a word: ? E T ? A -> but we need to put a letter at 1 and 4? And we know R is in the word, so we can put R at 1? But we are already using R at 1? And we are trying to test R at 1? But we haven't tried R at 1.

Actually, we can try R at 1, E at 2, T at 3, and then for position 4 and 5, we put A and a new letter? But we have to put A in the word. So if we put A at 4, then position 5 is open. But we also have to include E? We have E at 2, so that's one E. Then we have A at 4 and a new letter at 5.

But we need a word: R E T A ? -> but that's 5 letters? R E T A ? -> ""RETA"" is not 5 letters. 

We need a 5-letter word. ""RETA"" is 4 letters.

How about ""REATA""? But that's 5 letters? R E A T A -> but that has A at 3? We know A cannot be at 3. Also, we are putting A at 3? But we know A is not at 3. So we cannot put A at 3.

In our structure, if we put R at 1, E at 2, T at 3, then we have positions 4 and 5. We want to put A at 4? But then we have two A's? Or we put A at 5.

So if we put A at 4? But we don't know if A can be at 4. We haven't tried that. But we know A is not at 2 or 3, so 4 is possible.

But we also have to consider that the word must have the letter A. So we can put A at 4? Then the word: R E T A ?

What words? ""RETA"" is 4 letters. We need 5. ""RETAS"" -> but S at 5? And we have A at 4? Then the word: R E T A S -> ""RETAS"" is a word? It's the plural ofreta? Not common. 

""RETA"" is not 5.

Another word: ""RESTA"" -> but R E S T A -> position 3 is S? But we need position 3 to be T. So no.

So it's hard to find a word with R at 1, E at 2, T at 3, and A at 4? Because then we have ""RETA"" with a letter in between? But we need a word like ""RETA"" plus one letter? Not possible.

Therefore, the only candidate I see is ""EXTRA"".

But let me confirm: 
- E at 1: we don't know if E can be at 1? We only know E is not at 4 or 5. So it can be at 1.
- X: we don't know, but it must be a letter not in {C, N, L} and not conflicting.
- T at 3: fixed.
- R at 4: we know R is not at 2 or 5, so 4 is allowed.
- A at 5: we know A is not at 2 or 3, so 5 is allowed.

And we are testing:
- If E is at 1: if it is, we get a check? But we don't know.
- We are testing X (which is the second letter) and also the position of E at 1.

But note: we are also testing the position of R at 4 and A at 5.

We can also test a new letter at position 2.

But we have to avoid using forbidden letters: C, N, L.

So ""EXTRA"" is a valid word and fits the constraints.

But wait: in ""EXTRA"", the second letter is X. We haven't tested X. And we know the word has R, A, E, T, and one more. If X is not the fifth letter? Actually, ""EXTRA"" has 5 letters: E, X, T, R, A.

So the fifth letter is A. We know A is in the word, so that's fine.

But we have to consider: what if the word has only one E? Then ""EXTRA"" has two E's? That might be a problem? But the feedback so far hasn't indicated duplicates, but it's possible.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't duplicate E to test the positions without assuming duplicates.

But we have to include all the known letters: R, A, E, T.

We have T fixed at 3.

We can try to put R at 1, A at 4, and E at 2? But we couldn't find a word.

Another candidate: put R at 4, A at 1, and E at 2? But we have to fill position 5.

So structure: A E T R ? 

What words? ""AETER"" (not common), ""AETRA"" (not common). 

Or put A at 1, E at 2, R at 4, and then position 5 is open. But we need a word: A E T R ? 

""AETR?"" -> not a word.

Put R at 1, E at 2, and A at 4? Then we have A at 4? Then the word: R E T A ? 

But we need a word. ""RETA"" is 4 letters. We need 5. ""RETAB"" is not a word. ""RETAQ"" not a word.

So I think ""EXTRA"" is a good choice.

But let me think of other words that have T at 3 and include R, A, E.

For example: ""PARTY"" -> but no R and no E? We must have R and A and E.

Another: ""ARTSY"" -> no R, E, A? 

We must have the letters R, A, E.

So let's go with ""EXTRA"".

But note: in ""EXTRA"", we are putting E at 1. We don't know if that's correct. We are testing R at 4 and A at 5.

If we get feedback that E is correct at 1, then we know. Similarly for others.

But we also test the letter X.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses more new letters to get information.

But we have to include the known letters.

Another word: ""TARES"" -> but we know T is at 3, so we cannot put T at 5? And we have T at 3 fixed. Also, we have to avoid using N (which is absent). So skip.

""TARES"" has T at 1? But we don't have T at 3 fixed? In ""TARES"", T is at 1, so that wouldn't work because position 3 is not T.

We must have T at position 3.

So the word must have T at 3.

Another word: ""STARE"" -> but we know A is not at 3? And in ""STARE"", A is at 3? So we cannot put A at 3. Also, we have to avoid using S? We haven't tested S, but we can use it. But in ""STARE"", A is at 3, which is not allowed.

We cannot put A at 3.

How about ""STEAR""? But that's not a common word. And it has E at 4? But we know E is not at 4? From second guess, E at 4 got a minus. So we cannot put E at 4.

So we must avoid putting E at 4 and A at 2,3,4,5? But we can put A at 4 or 5, and E at 1 or 2.

But in ""STEAR"", if we put E at 4? Not allowed.

So back to ""EXTRA"".

Another candidate: ""DATER"" -> D A T E R -> but we have A at 2? We know A is not at 2 (from second guess: we put A at 2 and got a minus). So we cannot put A at 2.

In ""DATER"", A is at 2 -> not allowed.

""RATER"": R A T E R -> but R at 1 and 5? We know R is not at 5. Also, A at 2 -> not allowed.

So ""EXTRA"" seems a good choice.

But let me check: in ""EXTRA"", we have:
- E at 1: we are testing if E is at 1.
- X at 2: new letter.
- T at 3: fixed and correct.
- R at 4: testing if R is at 4.
- A at 5: testing if A is at 5.

We also test X.

If we get:
- E at 1: if it's correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or x? But we know E is in the word, so if not at 1, we get a minus.

Similarly for R at 4 and A at 5.

And we get information about X.

But note: we are putting R at 4. We know R is in the word, so if it's not at 4, we get a minus. Similarly for A at 5.

We also get information about X.

So I think it's a good guess.

But wait: we have to avoid using forbidden letters. X is not forbidden? We haven't tested X and it's not C, N, L.

So let's go with ""EXTRA"".

But note: we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""EXTRA"" is a valid word.

So my third guess: ""EXTRA""

But let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters.

Another candidate: ""STEAR"" -> but that's not common and E at 4 is not allowed.

""STARE"" is not allowed because A at 3.

""TRIED"" -> T R I E D -> but R is at 2? We know R is not at 2. So we cannot put R at 2.

We must avoid putting R at 2.

In ""TRIED"", R is at 2 -> not allowed.

""TRIBE"" -> no R and no A? 

I think ""EXTRA"" is acceptable.

So I'll go with ""EXTRA"".

But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don't have evidence for duplicates, but it's possible.

Alternatively, we can try ""DRAFT"" -> but no E? We must include E.

We must include all the known letters: R, A, E, T.

So ""EXTRA"" includes all.

Therefore, the next guess is ""EXTRA"".

<guess>extra</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)  
  - **C** and **N** are absent from the secret word.  
  - **R**, **A**, and **E** are present but in incorrect positions:  
    - R cannot be in position 2.  
    - A cannot be in position 3.  
    - E cannot be in position 5.  

- **Guess 2: later** → Feedback: L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(-) R(-)  
  - **L** is absent.  
  - **T** is correct and in position 3 (fixed).  
  - **A** is present but not in position 2.  
  - **E** is present but not in position 4.  
  - **R** is present but not in position 5.  

### Analysis:
- **Confirmed letters**: R, A, E, T (T is fixed at position 3).  
- **Absent letters**: C, N, L.  
- **Position constraints**:  
  - R: Cannot be in positions 2 or 5 → must be in 1 or 4.  
  - A: Cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → must be in 1, 4, or 5.  
  - E: Cannot be in positions 4 or 5 → must be in 1 or 2.  
- **Unknowns**: Two additional letters (not C, N, L) need to be discovered.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test the possible positions for R, A, and E while introducing new common letters.  
- **""extra""** is chosen because:  
  - Fits the position constraints:  
    - E at position 1 (tests if E is in position 1).  
    - R at position 4 (tests if R is in position 4).  
    - A at position 5 (tests if A is in position 5).  
  - Includes all known letters (R, A, E, T) and avoids absent letters (C, N, L).  
  - Uses new common letters (X) for position 2 to test for presence/absence and position.  
- If E is not in position 1, we get feedback on E's correct position. Similarly, R and A positions will be narrowed down.",Guess 3: extra -> FEEDBACK: E(-) X(x) T(✓) R(-) A(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letters C and N are not in the secret word.
 - The letters R, A, and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed.

 Since we know R, A, E are in the word, but not in the positions we had (which were positions 2, 3, and 5 respectively), we must place them elsewhere.

 Also, note that the secret word does not contain C or N.

 We have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.

 We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C or N.
   - Contains R, A, E (but not in positions 2, 3, 5? Actually, the feedback says they are in the word but not in the positions we guessed. So for R, it cannot be at position 2; for A, cannot be at position 3; for E, cannot be at position 5).

 However, note: the feedback does not prevent these letters from appearing in other positions if they are repeated? But we don't know if there are duplicates. Since we only have one occurrence in the guess, we assume at least one occurrence of each.

 We also know that the word has 5 letters and we have 3 known letters (R, A, E) and two unknown letters.

 We can try to use a word that has R, A, E in positions that are not 2, 3, 5? Actually, we can put them in any position except the ones we tried? But note: we only know that they are not in the positions we guessed. They could be in the same position again? But that would be a duplicate? We don't know.

 However, we must avoid the letters C and N.

 Let's think of words that contain R, A, E and two other letters (which are not C or N).

 Also, we want to test new positions for R, A, E and also get information about the other two letters.

 Since R was in position 2 in the first guess and now is not there, we can try R in a different position. Similarly for A and E.

 Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but not 2).
 Possible positions for A: 1, 4, 5 (but not 3).
 Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 4 (but not 5).

 We also have two more letters to guess.

 We can try to put R in position 1, A in position 4, and E in position 2? But we have to form a valid word.

 Let's try to think of words that have R, A, E and two other letters (not C, N).

 Example: ""LATER"" -> L, A, T, E, R.
 But note: we have to check the positions.

 In ""LATER"":
   L at position 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.

 But we know that A cannot be at position 3? Actually, in our first guess, A was at position 3 and we got a '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 3. So in ""LATER"", A is at position 2 which is allowed. Similarly, E is at position 4 (which is not 5, so allowed) and R is at position 5 (which is not 2, so allowed).

 However, we also have to consider that the word must be valid.

 But wait: we have to avoid C and N. ""LATER"" does not contain C or N.

 Alternatively, we could try ""RAISE"": 
   R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5 -> but E is at position 5? We know E cannot be at position 5 because in the first guess E was at position 5 and we got a '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5 again.

 Therefore, ""RAISE"" is invalid because E is at position 5.

 Another idea: ""STARE""
   S at 1, T at 2, A at 3 -> but A was at position 3 in the first guess and we know it cannot be at position 3? Actually, no: the feedback for the first guess said A is in the word but not at position 3. So we cannot put A at position 3 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not correct because the feedback already told us it's not at position 3. So we should avoid putting A at position 3.

 In ""STARE"", A is at position 3 again? So that's not allowed? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we already know it's not there. So we should try a word that puts A in a new position.

 Let's try to put A in position 1, E in position 2, and R in position 4? Example: ""AREAS"" -> but that has duplicate A? And also S at the end. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don't say, but typically in Wordle, words can have duplicate letters? However, the feedback might not indicate duplicates? Actually, the feedback per letter: if a letter appears twice, then the feedback might be tricky. But we don't have any duplicate in the first guess.

 However, we must avoid C and N.

 Another word: ""EARLY""
   E at 1, A at 2, R at 3, L at 4, Y at 5.
   But note: E is at position 1 (which is allowed), A at 2 (allowed because we only know it's not at 3), R at 3 (allowed because we only know it's not at 2). Also, we are testing new letters L and Y.

 But wait: we have E at position 1. We don't know if that's correct. We are trying to get more information.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROAST"", but we know that O and S are new, and A is at position 3? We know A cannot be at position 3? So we avoid that.

 How about ""RADIO""? 
   R at 1, A at 2, D at 3, I at 4, O at 5.
   But we know E is in the word? We don't have E in this word. We must include E because we know it's in the word.

 So we must include R, A, E.

 Another word: ""ALERT""
   A at 1, L at 2, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5.
   Check positions:
     A: position 1 (not 3 -> allowed)
     E: position 3 (not 5 -> allowed? we don't know about position 3 for E? The feedback only said E is not at position 5. So position 3 is new and allowed.
     R: position 4 (not 2 -> allowed)

   Also, we avoid C and N.

 But note: we have E at position 3. We don't know if that's correct.

 Alternatively, we can try ""STARE"" but we cannot put A at position 3. So we rearrange: 
   How about ""STORE""? 
     S at 1, T at 2, O at 3, R at 4, E at 5 -> but E at position 5 is not allowed? Because we know E is not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5.

 How about ""STARE"" but without putting A at 3? We can put A at 1? Then ""ALTER"" -> A at 1, L at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.
   Check:
     A: position 1 (not 3 -> allowed)
     E: position 4 (not 5 -> allowed)
     R: position 5 (not 2 -> allowed)

   This seems okay.

 But note: we have R at position 5 and E at position 4. Also, we are testing L and T.

 However, we have to consider that the word must be valid. ""ALTER"" is a valid word.

 But wait: we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

 Another option: ""RANGE"" -> but we know N is not in the word (from first guess: N was at position 4 and we got x) so we cannot use N.

 We must avoid N.

 So ""ALTER"" seems a good candidate.

 But let me check: we have A at 1, L at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.

 We are testing:
   A at 1: if it's correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or an x? But we know A is in the word, so if it's not at 1, we get a minus.

 Similarly, we are testing L and T.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RAISE"" but we cannot put E at 5. So we skip.

 Another word: ""PARSE""
   P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, S at 4, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed.

 How about ""PRIDE""? 
   P at 1, R at 2 -> but R was at position 2 in the first guess and we got a minus meaning it is not at position 2. So we cannot put R at position 2 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not there. So we avoid.

 How about ""DRIVE""? 
   D at 1, R at 2 -> again, R at position 2 is not allowed.

 We must avoid position 2 for R.

 So let's try to put R at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But we have constraints on A and E as well.

 We can try ""RADIO"" but we need E.

 How about ""REACT""? -> but we cannot use C (because we know C is not in the word).

 We must avoid C and N.

 So let's try ""REALM"": 
   R at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> but A at position 3 is not allowed? Because we know A is not at position 3. So we avoid.

 How about ""LEARN""? 
   L at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> again, A at 3 is not allowed.

 We need to avoid position 3 for A.

 So let's try to put A at position 1? Then we can put E at position 2? and R at position 4? Then we have two letters in the middle.

 Example: ""ALERT"" (which we considered earlier) is okay.

 But let me see: ""ALERT"" has A at 1, L at 2, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5.

 Check positions:
   A: 1 (not 3 -> allowed)
   E: 3 (not 5 -> allowed)
   R: 4 (not 2 -> allowed)

 So that's acceptable.

 Another option: ""ALTER"" (as above) has A at 1, L at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.

 Both are acceptable.

 But note: we also want to test new letters. We have already used: C, R, A, N, E (from the first guess). So we should avoid C and N, but we can use other letters.

 We haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to maximize information. So we should try to include common letters that we haven't tested.

 Common consonants: S, T, L, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that has R, A, E and two new common letters.

 We can try ""STARE"" but we cannot put A at 3. So we skip.

 How about ""TARES""? 
   T at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, S at 5.
   Check:
     A: position 2 (not 3 -> allowed)
     E: position 4 (not 5 -> allowed)
     R: position 3 (not 2 -> allowed)

   This is acceptable.

 But note: we are putting A at position 2 and R at position 3. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try ""LATER"": 
   L at 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> same as ALTER but with L instead of T.

 We haven't tested L or T. So either is fine.

 I think ""LATER"" is a common word.

 But note: we have to avoid using letters we know are not present: C and N. Both ""LATER"" and ""ALTER"" are safe.

 Let me choose ""LATER"". It uses L and T, which are common.

 So my second guess: ""LATER""

 However, note: we are not forced to put R, A, E in the next guess? Actually, we know they are in the word, so we should include them to get more information about their positions.

 We are including R, A, E and two new letters L and T.

 Let's go with ""LATER"".

<guess>later</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** and **N** are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **R**, **A**, and **E** are present but in incorrect positions (marked ""-""):
  - R cannot be in position 2.
  - A cannot be in position 3.
  - E cannot be in position 5.

For the second guess, I need a word that:
- Includes **R**, **A**, and **E** (since they are confirmed present).
- Excludes **C** and **N** (since they are absent).
- Tests new positions for R, A, and E to narrow down their locations.
- Introduces new common letters (like **L** and **T**) for additional information.

The word **""LATER""** fits these criteria:
- Places **R** at position 5 (not 2).
- Places **A** at position 2 (not 3).
- Places **E** at position 4 (not 5).
- Uses **L** and **T** (common letters not yet tested).
- Avoids **C** and **N**.

This guess will help verify the positions of R, A, and E while testing two new letters.

<guess>later</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: later -> FEEDBACK: L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(-) R(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)

Guess 2: ""later""
- L: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 2)  [since it was in position 2 and got a minus]
- T: ✓ (correct, in position 3)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 4)  [since it was in position 4 and got a minus]
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 5)  [since it was in position 5 and got a minus]

What we know so far:
- The secret word contains: R, A, E (from first guess) and we now know T is in the word and in position 3 (from second guess).
- The secret word does not contain: C, N, L (from both guesses).
- Position 3 is T.

Also, from the first guess, we knew:
- R is not in position 2.
- A is not in position 3.
- E is not in position 5.

From the second guess:
- A is not in position 2 (because we put it in position 2 and got a minus).
- E is not in position 4 (because we put it in position 4 and got a minus).
- R is not in position 5 (because we put it in position 5 and got a minus).

So now we know:
- T is fixed at position 3.

We also know that R, A, E are in the word, but:
- R is not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 5 (from second guess). So R must be in position 1 or 4? (since position 3 is taken by T).
  But note: the word has 5 positions. Position 3 is T. So R can be in position 1, 4, or possibly 5? But we just learned R is not in position 5. So R must be in position 1 or 4.

- A is in the word but not in position 3 (from first guess) and not in position 2 (from second guess). So A can be in position 1, 4, or 5? But note: position 3 is taken by T, so A can be in 1, 4, or 5.

- E is in the word but not in position 5 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess). So E can be in position 1, 2, or 3? But position 3 is T, so E can be in position 1 or 2.

We also know the word does not contain: C, N, L.

Now, we have to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Has T in position 3.
- Includes R, A, E.
- Excludes C, N, L.
- And we need to test the possible positions for R, A, E.

We also need to find the two remaining letters.

Let's list the constraints for each known letter:
- R: must be in position 1 or 4 (since 2 and 5 are ruled out, and 3 is taken by T).
- A: must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (but not 2 or 3).
- E: must be in position 1 or 2 (since not 4 or 5, and 3 is taken).

But note: the word must have exactly these letters? Actually, we know the word has R, A, E, and T, and two more letters that we haven't found.

We also know that the word does not have C, N, L.

We can try to form a word that satisfies these conditions and tests the possible positions.

We have two unknown letters. We should try to use common letters that we haven't tested: for example, S, D, H, I, O, U, etc.

We also need to consider the positions.

Let's try to put E in position 1 and R in position 4? Then we have:
Position 1: E
Position 2: ? (must be a letter not in {C, N, L} and not conflicting)
Position 3: T (fixed)
Position 4: R
Position 5: ? (must be a letter not in {C, N, L} and not conflicting)

But we also have A to place. A can be in 1,4,5? But position 1 is taken by E, so A can be in 4 or 5.

If we put E in 1 and R in 4, then A must be in 5? Because positions 2 and 3 are taken by unknown letters and A cannot be in 2 or 3? Actually, A can be in 1,4,5 but 1 is taken, so 4 or 5.

But we also have to consider that the unknown letters in position 2 and 5 must not be C, N, L.

Let's try to form a word: E _ T R _ 
But we need to fill the blanks. And A must be in the word. So if we put A in position 5, then we have E _ T R A.

What letter can we put in position 2? We need a letter that is not C, N, L and not conflicting.

We can try ""EATER"":
- E at 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but R is at position 5? We know R is not at position 5 (from second guess: R at 5 got a minus). So we cannot put R at 5.

We must avoid putting R at 5.

So if we put R at 4, then we have E _ T R A. The letter in position 2 must be a letter that is not C, N, L and not conflicting.

What about ""EATER""? It has E at 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but R at 5 is not allowed. So skip.

We need to put R at 4, so the word would be E ? T R A? But then we have A at 5. Is that allowed? Yes, because A can be at 5.

But we have two E's? We don't know if the word has two E's? The first guess had only one E and it was marked present, but that doesn't rule out two E's. However, we have to be cautious.

But let's see: if we put E at 1 and R at 4, and A at 5, then the word is E _ T R A.

We need to fill the second position. What letter? It must be a letter that is not C, N, L and not conflicting.

We can try ""ENTER"": but N is not allowed (from first guess: N is absent). So skip.

We can try ""EIGHT"": but that has G and H, which are new. But the word would be E I G H T? But position 3 is T, so that would be E I G H T? But we need to have R in the word? We are putting R at 4? In ""EIGHT"", there is no R. So we must include R.

We must include R, A, and E.

So the word must have R, A, E, T, and one more letter (since it's 5 letters).

We have to put T at 3.

So the structure: 
Position 1: ? (or E? but we are considering E at 1)
Position 2: ? (must be a letter not in {C, N, L} and not conflicting)
Position 3: T
Position 4: R (if we put R at 4) or another letter?
Position 5: ? (and A must be here? or another letter? but A can be at 5)

But we have to put A somewhere. If we put R at 4, then A must be at 1 or 5? But position 1: if we put E at 1, then A cannot be at 1. So A must be at 5? Then the word would be E ? T R A.

But we need to fill position 2. What letter? It must be a letter not in {C, N, L} and not conflicting.

We can try ""EATER"" but R at 5 is not allowed.

Alternatively, we can put R at position 1? Then we have:
Position 1: R
Position 2: ? (must be a letter not in {C, N, L} and not conflicting)
Position 3: T
Position 4: ? 
Position 5: ? 

And A must be in the word. A can be in 4 or 5? But if we put R at 1, then A cannot be at 1. So A can be at 4 or 5.

If we put A at 4, then the word: R ? T A ? 
But we need to fill position 2 and 5.

If we put A at 5, then R ? T ? A.

We also have E to place. E can be in 1 or 2? But if we put R at 1, then E can be in 2.

So two possibilities:
1. R ? T E A (with E at 4 and A at 5)
2. R ? T A ? (with A at 4 and E at 2? or at 5? but if A at 4, then E can be at 2? but we have position 5 open)

But note: we have to avoid putting E at 4? We don't know if E can be at 4? Actually, we know from the second guess that E is not at position 4 (because we put it at 4 and got a minus). So E cannot be at 4. Therefore, in the first possibility, E is at 4, which is not allowed? So that's invalid.

Therefore, in the first possibility, we cannot put E at 4. So we have to put E at 2? Then the word: R E T A ? 

But then we have A at 4 and E at 2? Then position 5 is open.

So one possibility: R E T A ?

But we need a word. ""RETAB"" is not a word. ""RETAB"" is not a word.

Alternatively, we can put R at 1, E at 2, and A at 4? Then the word: R E T A ?

But we need a word. ""RETAB"" is not a word.

We need valid words.

Another idea: put E at 1 and R at 4? Then we have E ? T R A.

What words end with ""ETRA""? Not common. 

Put R at 4 and A at 1? But A cannot be at 1? Wait, no: A can be at 1? We haven't tried that. But we have E to place. If we put A at 1, then we have:
Position 1: A (but we know A is not at 2 or 3, but 1 is allowed? We haven't tried A at 1. But we know A is not at 2 or 3, so 1 is a possibility.)
Position 2: ? 
Position 3: T
Position 4: R
Position 5: ?

But we have to include E. E can be at 1 or 2? But if we put A at 1, then E cannot be at 1? So E must be at 2.

So the word: A E T R ? 

But we need a word. ""AETRA"" is not a word.

Alternatively, we can put R at 1 and A at 5? Then E must be at 2 (since it can be at 1 or 2, but 1 is taken by R). So:
Position 1: R
Position 2: E
Position 3: T
Position 4: ? 
Position 5: A

Then the word: R E T ? A

What words? ""RETIA"" (not common), ""REATA"" (not common), ""RESTA"" (not a word), ""RETSA"" (not common), ""REATA"" (not common). 

This is difficult.

Put R at 4 and A at 5? Then:
Position 1: ? 
Position 2: ? 
Position 3: T
Position 4: R
Position 5: A

And E must be at 1 or 2? But position 1: if we put E, then the word: E ? T R A.

What words? ""ETRA"" at the end? ""EATER"" is E A T E R -> but that has A at 2 and E at 4? But we are putting A at 5 and E at 1? So that doesn't match.

We need E at 1: so ""E _ T R A"". Words: ""EATER"" is E A T E R -> but that has A at 2 and E at 4? Not matching.

Actually, we need the pattern: E ? T R A -> so the second letter is unknown.

Words: ""EIGHT"" is E I G H T -> no R and no A? But we must have A.

We need a word that has E, T, R, A. But we have T at 3, R at 4, A at 5, and E at 1.

So the word must be: E ? T R A.

What letters can we put in the second position? We need a letter that is not C, N, L and not conflicting.

Possible words: 
- ""EATER"": but that has A at 2 and E at 4? No, that's E A T E R -> positions: E(1), A(2), T(3), E(4), R(5). But we need R at 4 and A at 5? So that doesn't match.

We need R at 4 and A at 5: so the word must end with ""RA"". But then the last two letters are R and A? So the word is ... R A.

But we have E at 1, then a letter at 2, then T at 3, then R at 4, then A at 5.

So the word: E X T R A, where X is the unknown letter.

What words? ""ENTER"" is E N T E R -> but N is not allowed and also E at 4? Not matching.

We need a word that has the pattern E X T R A.

Possible words: 
- ""EATER"" is E A T E R -> but that has A at 2 and E at 4? And R at 5? But we need R at 4 and A at 5? So no.

Another: ""EXTRA"": 
- X = E, then position 2: X = E? But we are putting E at 1? Then the word would be E X T R A. If X = E, then we have E at 1, E at 2? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, ""EXTRA"" has X = E, then position 2 is X? So E at 1 and E at 2? But we don't know if the word has two E's.

But let's check the feedback: in the first guess, we had E and it was present, but we don't know if there is a second E. Similarly, in the second guess, we had E and it was present but not at 4.

But we also have to consider that the word must have exactly the letters: E, T, R, A, and one more.

We know the word has R, A, E, T, and one more. So if we allow two E's, then ""EXTRA"" has two E's? But ""EXTRA"" is E X T R A -> so positions: E(1), X(2), T(3), R(4), A(5). This matches the pattern.

But we have to check if X can be E? We don't know if the word has two E's. But it's possible.

However, we have to avoid C, N, L. ""EXTRA"" has X (which is not C, N, L) and E at 1 and 2? But we are only required to have one E? Actually, the feedback from the first guess had only one E and it was marked present, but that doesn't rule out two E's. The feedback for the second guess also had only one E and it was marked present (but not at 4). So it could have two E's.

But we also have to consider the feedback: if the word had two E's, then in the second guess (when we put E at 4) we would have gotten a minus for E? But if there is an E at 1, then when we put E at 4, we get a minus because the E is present but not at 4. Similarly, if there is an E at 2, then we get a minus for E at 4? But we don't know if there are two E's.

However, we must avoid using letters we know are absent: C, N, L. ""EXTRA"" has X and E, T, R, A. X is not forbidden.

But we have to check if E is allowed at position 1? We don't have any feedback that E cannot be at 1. We only know E is not at 4 or 5.

Similarly, R is at 4: we know R is not at 2 or 5, so 4 is allowed.

A is at 5: we know A is not at 2 or 3, so 5 is allowed.

So ""EXTRA"" is a candidate.

But let me see if there are other possibilities.

Another candidate: put R at 1 and A at 4? Then we have:
Position 1: R
Position 2: ? 
Position 3: T
Position 4: A
Position 5: ? 

And E must be at 1 or 2? But position 1: if we put E, then word: E X T A ? 

What words? ""ETAMA"" (not common), ""ETALA"" (not common). 

Or if we put E at 2: then word: X E T A ? 

What words? ""SETAE"" (not common), ""METAL"" -> but L is not allowed. 

So ""EXTRA"" seems a good candidate.

But wait: in ""EXTRA"", we have two E's. We don't know if that's allowed. But it's possible.

Another candidate: put R at 4 and A at 1? But A at 1 is allowed? Then we have:
Position 1: A
Position 2: ? 
Position 3: T
Position 4: R
Position 5: ? 

And E must be at 1 or 2? But position 1 is taken by A, so E must be at 2.

So the word: A E T R ? 

What words? ""AETRA"" (not common), ""AETER"" (not common). 

Or if we put E at 1: then A at 2? But A cannot be at 2? We know A is not at 2 (from second guess: we put A at 2 and got a minus). So A cannot be at 2. Therefore, we cannot put A at 2.

So if we put A at 1, then E at 2: then the word: A E T R ? 

What words? ""AETRA"" (not common), ""AETER"" (not common). 

Alternatively, put R at 1 and A at 4? Then:
Position 1: R
Position 2: ? 
Position 3: T
Position 4: A
Position 5: ? 

And E must be at 1 or 2? But position 1: if we put E, then word: E X T A ? 

What words? ""ETALA"" (not common), ""ETAMA"" (not common). 

Or if we put E at 2: then position 1 is something else. But we need a word. ""X E T A ?"" -> ""SETAE"" (not common). 

So ""EXTRA"" seems a good candidate.

But let me check if there are other words that fit the pattern without duplicates.

What about ""ARTET""? Not a word.

Or ""RESTA"" -> but R is at 1, E at 2, S at 3? But position 3 must be T. So no.

Another idea: put R at 1 and E at 2? Then we have:
Position 1: R
Position 2: E
Position 3: T
Position 4: ? 
Position 5: ? 

And A must be at 4 or 5? But we have two positions: 4 and 5. And we can put A at 4 and then a new letter at 5? Or A at 5 and a new letter at 4.

But we also have to include A. So we can put A at 4 and then a new letter at 5.

But we need a word: ? E T ? A -> but we need to put a letter at 1 and 4? And we know R is in the word, so we can put R at 1? But we are already using R at 1? And we are trying to test R at 1? But we haven't tried R at 1.

Actually, we can try R at 1, E at 2, T at 3, and then for position 4 and 5, we put A and a new letter? But we have to put A in the word. So if we put A at 4, then position 5 is open. But we also have to include E? We have E at 2, so that's one E. Then we have A at 4 and a new letter at 5.

But we need a word: R E T A ? -> but that's 5 letters? R E T A ? -> ""RETA"" is not 5 letters. 

We need a 5-letter word. ""RETA"" is 4 letters.

How about ""REATA""? But that's 5 letters? R E A T A -> but that has A at 3? We know A cannot be at 3. Also, we are putting A at 3? But we know A is not at 3. So we cannot put A at 3.

In our structure, if we put R at 1, E at 2, T at 3, then we have positions 4 and 5. We want to put A at 4? But then we have two A's? Or we put A at 5.

So if we put A at 4? But we don't know if A can be at 4. We haven't tried that. But we know A is not at 2 or 3, so 4 is possible.

But we also have to consider that the word must have the letter A. So we can put A at 4? Then the word: R E T A ?

What words? ""RETA"" is 4 letters. We need 5. ""RETAS"" -> but S at 5? And we have A at 4? Then the word: R E T A S -> ""RETAS"" is a word? It's the plural ofreta? Not common. 

""RETA"" is not 5.

Another word: ""RESTA"" -> but R E S T A -> position 3 is S? But we need position 3 to be T. So no.

So it's hard to find a word with R at 1, E at 2, T at 3, and A at 4? Because then we have ""RETA"" with a letter in between? But we need a word like ""RETA"" plus one letter? Not possible.

Therefore, the only candidate I see is ""EXTRA"".

But let me confirm: 
- E at 1: we don't know if E can be at 1? We only know E is not at 4 or 5. So it can be at 1.
- X: we don't know, but it must be a letter not in {C, N, L} and not conflicting.
- T at 3: fixed.
- R at 4: we know R is not at 2 or 5, so 4 is allowed.
- A at 5: we know A is not at 2 or 3, so 5 is allowed.

And we are testing:
- If E is at 1: if it is, we get a check? But we don't know.
- We are testing X (which is the second letter) and also the position of E at 1.

But note: we are also testing the position of R at 4 and A at 5.

We can also test a new letter at position 2.

But we have to avoid using forbidden letters: C, N, L.

So ""EXTRA"" is a valid word and fits the constraints.

But wait: in ""EXTRA"", the second letter is X. We haven't tested X. And we know the word has R, A, E, T, and one more. If X is not the fifth letter? Actually, ""EXTRA"" has 5 letters: E, X, T, R, A.

So the fifth letter is A. We know A is in the word, so that's fine.

But we have to consider: what if the word has only one E? Then ""EXTRA"" has two E's? That might be a problem? But the feedback so far hasn't indicated duplicates, but it's possible.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't duplicate E to test the positions without assuming duplicates.

But we have to include all the known letters: R, A, E, T.

We have T fixed at 3.

We can try to put R at 1, A at 4, and E at 2? But we couldn't find a word.

Another candidate: put R at 4, A at 1, and E at 2? But we have to fill position 5.

So structure: A E T R ? 

What words? ""AETER"" (not common), ""AETRA"" (not common). 

Or put A at 1, E at 2, R at 4, and then position 5 is open. But we need a word: A E T R ? 

""AETR?"" -> not a word.

Put R at 1, E at 2, and A at 4? Then we have A at 4? Then the word: R E T A ? 

But we need a word. ""RETA"" is 4 letters. We need 5. ""RETAB"" is not a word. ""RETAQ"" not a word.

So I think ""EXTRA"" is a good choice.

But let me think of other words that have T at 3 and include R, A, E.

For example: ""PARTY"" -> but no R and no E? We must have R and A and E.

Another: ""ARTSY"" -> no R, E, A? 

We must have the letters R, A, E.

So let's go with ""EXTRA"".

But note: in ""EXTRA"", we are putting E at 1. We don't know if that's correct. We are testing R at 4 and A at 5.

If we get feedback that E is correct at 1, then we know. Similarly for others.

But we also test the letter X.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses more new letters to get information.

But we have to include the known letters.

Another word: ""TARES"" -> but we know T is at 3, so we cannot put T at 5? And we have T at 3 fixed. Also, we have to avoid using N (which is absent). So skip.

""TARES"" has T at 1? But we don't have T at 3 fixed? In ""TARES"", T is at 1, so that wouldn't work because position 3 is not T.

We must have T at position 3.

So the word must have T at 3.

Another word: ""STARE"" -> but we know A is not at 3? And in ""STARE"", A is at 3? So we cannot put A at 3. Also, we have to avoid using S? We haven't tested S, but we can use it. But in ""STARE"", A is at 3, which is not allowed.

We cannot put A at 3.

How about ""STEAR""? But that's not a common word. And it has E at 4? But we know E is not at 4? From second guess, E at 4 got a minus. So we cannot put E at 4.

So we must avoid putting E at 4 and A at 2,3,4,5? But we can put A at 4 or 5, and E at 1 or 2.

But in ""STEAR"", if we put E at 4? Not allowed.

So back to ""EXTRA"".

Another candidate: ""DATER"" -> D A T E R -> but we have A at 2? We know A is not at 2 (from second guess: we put A at 2 and got a minus). So we cannot put A at 2.

In ""DATER"", A is at 2 -> not allowed.

""RATER"": R A T E R -> but R at 1 and 5? We know R is not at 5. Also, A at 2 -> not allowed.

So ""EXTRA"" seems a good choice.

But let me check: in ""EXTRA"", we have:
- E at 1: we are testing if E is at 1.
- X at 2: new letter.
- T at 3: fixed and correct.
- R at 4: testing if R is at 4.
- A at 5: testing if A is at 5.

We also test X.

If we get:
- E at 1: if it's correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or x? But we know E is in the word, so if not at 1, we get a minus.

Similarly for R at 4 and A at 5.

And we get information about X.

But note: we are putting R at 4. We know R is in the word, so if it's not at 4, we get a minus. Similarly for A at 5.

We also get information about X.

So I think it's a good guess.

But wait: we have to avoid using forbidden letters. X is not forbidden? We haven't tested X and it's not C, N, L.

So let's go with ""EXTRA"".

But note: we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""EXTRA"" is a valid word.

So my third guess: ""EXTRA""

But let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters.

Another candidate: ""STEAR"" -> but that's not common and E at 4 is not allowed.

""STARE"" is not allowed because A at 3.

""TRIED"" -> T R I E D -> but R is at 2? We know R is not at 2. So we cannot put R at 2.

We must avoid putting R at 2.

In ""TRIED"", R is at 2 -> not allowed.

""TRIBE"" -> no R and no A? 

I think ""EXTRA"" is acceptable.

So I'll go with ""EXTRA"".

But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don't have evidence for duplicates, but it's possible.

Alternatively, we can try ""DRAFT"" -> but no E? We must include E.

We must include all the known letters: R, A, E, T.

So ""EXTRA"" includes all.

Therefore, the next guess is ""EXTRA"".

<guess>extra</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)  
  - **C** and **N** are absent from the secret word.  
  - **R**, **A**, and **E** are present but in incorrect positions:  
    - R cannot be in position 2.  
    - A cannot be in position 3.  
    - E cannot be in position 5.  

- **Guess 2: later** → Feedback: L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(-) R(-)  
  - **L** is absent.  
  - **T** is correct and in position 3 (fixed).  
  - **A** is present but not in position 2.  
  - **E** is present but not in position 4.  
  - **R** is present but not in position 5.  

### Analysis:
- **Confirmed letters**: R, A, E, T (T is fixed at position 3).  
- **Absent letters**: C, N, L.  
- **Position constraints**:  
  - R: Cannot be in positions 2 or 5 → must be in 1 or 4.  
  - A: Cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → must be in 1, 4, or 5.  
  - E: Cannot be in positions 4 or 5 → must be in 1 or 2.  
- **Unknowns**: Two additional letters (not C, N, L) need to be discovered.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test the possible positions for R, A, and E while introducing new common letters.  
- **""extra""** is chosen because:  
  - Fits the position constraints:  
    - E at position 1 (tests if E is in position 1).  
    - R at position 4 (tests if R is in position 4).  
    - A at position 5 (tests if A is in position 5).  
  - Includes all known letters (R, A, E, T) and avoids absent letters (C, N, L).  
  - Uses new common letters (X) for position 2 to test for presence/absence and position.  
- If E is not in position 1, we get feedback on E's correct position. Similarly, R and A positions will be narrowed down.

Actually, the feedback says they are in the word but not in the positions we guessed. So for R, it cannot be at position 2; for A, cannot be at position 3; for E, cannot be at position 5).\n\n However, note: the feedback does not prevent these letters from appearing in other positions if they are repeated? But we don\'t know if there are duplicates. Since we only have one occurrence in the guess, we assume at least one occurrence of each.\n\n We also know that the word has 5 letters and we have 3 known letters (R, A, E) and two unknown letters.\n\n We can try to use a word that has R, A, E in positions that are not 2, 3, 5? Actually, we can put them in any position except the ones we tried? But note: we only know that they are not in the positions we guessed. They could be in the same position again? But that would be a duplicate? We don\'t know.\n\n However, we must avoid the letters C and N.\n\n Let\'s think of words that contain R, A, E and two other letters (which are not C or N).\n\n Also, we want to test new positions for R, A, E and also get information about the other two letters.\n\n Since R was in position 2 in the first guess and now is not there, we can try R in a different position. Similarly for A and E.\n\n Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but not 2).\n Possible positions for A: 1, 4, 5 (but not 3).\n Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 4 (but not 5).\n\n We also have two more letters to guess.\n\n We can try to put R in position 1, A in position 4, and E in position 2? But we have to form a valid word.\n\n Let\'s try to think of words that have R, A, E and two other letters (not C, N).\n\n Example: ""LATER"" -> L, A, T, E, R.\n But note: we have to check the positions.\n\n In ""LATER"":\n   L at position 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.\n\n But we know that A cannot be at position 3? Actually, in our first guess, A was at position 3 and we got a \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not at position 3. So in ""LATER"", A is at position 2 which is allowed. Similarly, E is at position 4 (which is not 5, so allowed) and R is at position 5 (which is not 2, so allowed).\n\n However, we also have to consider that the word must be valid.\n\n But wait: we have to avoid C and N. ""LATER"" does not contain C or N.\n\n Alternatively, we could try ""RAISE"": \n   R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5 -> but E is at position 5? We know E cannot be at position 5 because in the first guess E was at position 5 and we got a \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5 again.\n\n Therefore, ""RAISE"" is invalid because E is at position 5.\n\n Another idea: ""STARE""\n   S at 1, T at 2, A at 3 -> but A was at position 3 in the first guess and we know it cannot be at position 3? Actually, no: the feedback for the first guess said A is in the word but not at position 3. So we cannot put A at position 3 again? Actually, we can, but we know it\'s not correct because the feedback already told us it\'s not at position 3. So we should avoid putting A at position 3.\n\n In ""STARE"", A is at position 3 again? So that\'s not allowed? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we already know it\'s not there. So we should try a word that puts A in a new position.\n\n Let\'s try to put A in position 1, E in position 2, and R in position 4? Example: ""AREAS"" -> but that has duplicate A? And also S at the end. But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don\'t say, but typically in Wordle, words can have duplicate letters? However, the feedback might not indicate duplicates? Actually, the feedback per letter: if a letter appears twice, then the feedback might be tricky. But we don\'t have any duplicate in the first guess.\n\n However, we must avoid C and N.\n\n Another word: ""EARLY""\n   E at 1, A at 2, R at 3, L at 4, Y at 5.\n   But note: E is at position 1 (which is allowed), A at 2 (allowed because we only know it\'s not at 3), R at 3 (allowed because we only know it\'s not at 2). Also, we are testing new letters L and Y.\n\n But wait: we have E at position 1. We don\'t know if that\'s correct. We are trying to get more information.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""ROAST"", but we know that O and S are new, and A is at position 3? We know A cannot be at position 3? So we avoid that.\n\n How about ""RADIO""? \n   R at 1, A at 2, D at 3, I at 4, O at 5.\n   But we know E is in the word? We don\'t have E in this word. We must include E because we know it\'s in the word.\n\n So we must include R, A, E.\n\n Another word: ""ALERT""\n   A at 1, L at 2, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5.\n   Check positions:\n     A: position 1 (not 3 -> allowed)\n     E: position 3 (not 5 -> allowed? we don\'t know about position 3 for E? The feedback only said E is not at position 5. So position 3 is new and allowed.\n     R: position 4 (not 2 -> allowed)\n\n   Also, we avoid C and N.\n\n But note: we have E at position 3. We don\'t know if that\'s correct.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""STARE"" but we cannot put A at position 3. So we rearrange: \n   How about ""STORE""? \n     S at 1, T at 2, O at 3, R at 4, E at 5 -> but E at position 5 is not allowed? Because we know E is not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5.\n\n How about ""STARE"" but without putting A at 3? We can put A at 1? Then ""ALTER"" -> A at 1, L at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.\n   Check:\n     A: position 1 (not 3 -> allowed)\n     E: position 4 (not 5 -> allowed)\n     R: position 5 (not 2 -> allowed)\n\n   This seems okay.\n\n But note: we have R at position 5 and E at position 4. Also, we are testing L and T.\n\n However, we have to consider that the word must be valid. ""ALTER"" is a valid word.\n\n But wait: we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t have any indication of duplicates so far.\n\n Another option: ""RANGE"" -> but we know N is not in the word (from first guess: N was at position 4 and we got x) so we cannot use N.\n\n We must avoid N.\n\n So ""ALTER"" seems a good candidate.\n\n But let me check: we have A at 1, L at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.\n\n We are testing:\n   A at 1: if it\'s correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or an x? But we know A is in the word, so if it\'s not at 1, we get a minus.\n\n Similarly, we are testing L and T.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""RAISE"" but we cannot put E at 5. So we skip.\n\n Another word: ""PARSE""\n   P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, S at 4, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed.\n\n How about ""PRIDE""? \n   P at 1, R at 2 -> but R was at position 2 in the first guess and we got a minus meaning it is not at position 2. So we cannot put R at position 2 again? Actually, we can, but we know it\'s not there. So we avoid.\n\n How about ""DRIVE""? \n   D at 1, R at 2 -> again, R at position 2 is not allowed.\n\n We must avoid position 2 for R.\n\n So let\'s try to put R at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But we have constraints on A and E as well.\n\n We can try ""RADIO"" but we need E.\n\n How about ""REACT""? -> but we cannot use C (because we know C is not in the word).\n\n We must avoid C and N.\n\n So let\'s try ""REALM"": \n   R at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> but A at position 3 is not allowed? Because we know A is not at position 3. So we avoid.\n\n How about ""LEARN""? \n   L at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> again, A at 3 is not allowed.\n\n We need to avoid position 3 for A.\n\n So let\'s try to put A at position 1? Then we can put E at position 2? and R at position 4? Then we have two letters in the middle.\n\n Example: ""ALERT"" (which we considered earlier) is okay.\n\n But let me see: ""ALERT"" has A at 1, L at 2, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5.\n\n Check positions:\n   A: 1 (not 3 -> allowed)\n   E: 3 (not 5 -> allowed)\n   R: 4 (not 2 -> allowed)\n\n So that\'s acceptable.\n\n Another option: ""ALTER"" (as above) has A at 1, L at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.\n\n Both are acceptable.\n\n But note: we also want to test new letters. We have already used: C, R, A, N, E (from the first guess). So we should avoid C and N, but we can use other letters.\n\n We haven\'t used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We want to maximize information. So we should try to include common letters that we haven\'t tested.\n\n Common consonants: S, T, L, etc.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that has R, A, E and two new common letters.\n\n We can try ""STARE"" but we cannot put A at 3. So we skip.\n\n How about ""TARES""? \n   T at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, S at 5.\n   Check:\n     A: position 2 (not 3 -> allowed)\n     E: position 4 (not 5 -> allowed)\n     R: position 3 (not 2 -> allowed)\n\n   This is acceptable.\n\n But note: we are putting A at position 2 and R at position 3. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""LATER"": \n   L at 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> same as ALTER but with L instead of T.\n\n We haven\'t tested L or T. So either is fine.\n\n I think ""LATER"" is a common word.\n\n But note: we have to avoid using letters we know are not present: C and N. Both ""LATER"" and ""ALTER"" are safe.\n\n Let me choose ""LATER"". It uses L and T, which are common.\n\n So my second guess: ""LATER""\n\n However, note: we are not forced to put R, A, E in the next guess? Actually, we know they are in the word, so we should include them to get more information about their positions.\n\n We are including R, A, E and two new letters L and T.\n\n Let\'s go with ""LATER"".\n\n<guess>later</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C** and **N** are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- **R**, **A**, and **E** are present but in incorrect positions (marked ""-""):\n  - R cannot be in position 2.\n  - A cannot be in position 3.\n  - E cannot be in position 5.\n\nFor the second guess, I need a word that:\n- Includes **R**, **A**, and **E** (since they are confirmed present).\n- Excludes **C** and **N** (since they are absent).\n- Tests new positions for R, A, and E to narrow down their locations.\n- Introduces new common letters (like **L** and **T**) for additional information.\n\nThe word **""LATER""** fits these criteria:\n- Places **R** at position 5 (not 2).\n- Places **A** at position 2 (not 3).\n- Places **E** at position 4 (not 5).\n- Uses **L** and **T** (common letters not yet tested).\n- Avoids **C** and **N**.\n\nThis guess will help verify the positions of R, A, and E while testing two new letters.\n\n<guess>later</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: later -> FEEDBACK: L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(-) R(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)\n- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)\n\nGuess 2: ""later""\n- L: x (not in the word)\n- A: - (in the word, but not in position 2)  [since it was in position 2 and got a minus]\n- T: ✓ (correct, in position 3)\n- E: - (in the word, but not in position 4)  [since it was in position 4 and got a minus]\n- R: - (in the word, but not in position 5)  [since it was in position 5 and got a minus]\n\nWhat we know so far:\n- The secret word contains: R, A, E (from first guess) and we now know T is in the word and in position 3 (from second guess).\n- The secret word does not contain: C, N, L (from both guesses).\n- Position 3 is T.\n\nAlso, from the first guess, we knew:\n- R is not in position 2.\n- A is not in position 3.\n- E is not in position 5.\n\nFrom the second guess:\n- A is not in position 2 (because we put it in position 2 and got a minus).\n- E is not in position 4 (because we put it in position 4 and got a minus).\n- R is not in position 5 (because we put it in position 5 and got a minus).\n\nSo now we know:\n- T is fixed at position 3.\n\nWe also know that R, A, E are in the word, but:\n- R is not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 5 (from second guess). So R must be in position 1 or 4? (since position 3 is taken by T).\n  But note: the word has 5 positions. Position 3 is T. So R can be in position 1, 4, or possibly 5? But we just learned R is not in position 5. So R must be in position 1 or 4.\n\n- A is in the word but not in position 3 (from first guess) and not in position 2 (from second guess). So A can be in position 1, 4, or 5? But note: position 3 is taken by T, so A can be in 1, 4, or 5.\n\n- E is in the word but not in position 5 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess). So E can be in position 1, 2, or 3? But position 3 is T, so E can be in position 1 or 2.\n\nWe also know the word does not contain: C, N, L.\n\nNow, we have to form a new 5-letter word that:\n- Has T in position 3.\n- Includes R, A, E.\n- Excludes C, N, L.\n- And we need to test the possible positions for R, A, E.\n\nWe also need to find the two remaining letters.\n\nLet\'s list the constraints for each known letter:\n- R: must be in position 1 or 4 (since 2 and 5 are ruled out, and 3 is taken by T).\n- A: must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (but not 2 or 3).\n- E: must be in position 1 or 2 (since not 4 or 5, and 3 is taken).\n\nBut note: the word must have exactly these letters? Actually, we know the word has R, A, E, and T, and two more letters that we haven\'t found.\n\nWe also know that the word does not have C, N, L.\n\nWe can try to form a word that satisfies these conditions and tests the possible positions.\n\nWe have two unknown letters. We should try to use common letters that we haven\'t tested: for example, S, D, H, I, O, U, etc.\n\nWe also need to consider the positions.\n\nLet\'s try to put E in position 1 and R in position 4? Then we have:\nPosition 1: E\nPosition 2: ? (must be a letter not in {C, N, L} and not conflicting)\nPosition 3: T (fixed)\nPosition 4: R\nPosition 5: ? (must be a letter not in {C, N, L} and not conflicting)\n\nBut we also have A to place. A can be in 1,4,5? But position 1 is taken by E, so A can be in 4 or 5.\n\nIf we put E in 1 and R in 4, then A must be in 5? Because positions 2 and 3 are taken by unknown letters and A cannot be in 2 or 3? Actually, A can be in 1,4,5 but 1 is taken, so 4 or 5.\n\nBut we also have to consider that the unknown letters in position 2 and 5 must not be C, N, L.\n\nLet\'s try to form a word: E _ T R _ \nBut we need to fill the blanks. And A must be in the word. So if we put A in position 5, then we have E _ T R A.\n\nWhat letter can we put in position 2? We need a letter that is not C, N, L and not conflicting.\n\nWe can try ""EATER"":\n- E at 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but R is at position 5? We know R is not at position 5 (from second guess: R at 5 got a minus). So we cannot put R at 5.\n\nWe must avoid putting R at 5.\n\nSo if we put R at 4, then we have E _ T R A. The letter in position 2 must be a letter that is not C, N, L and not conflicting.\n\nWhat about ""EATER""? It has E at 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but R at 5 is not allowed. So skip.\n\nWe need to put R at 4, so the word would be E ? T R A? But then we have A at 5. Is that allowed? Yes, because A can be at 5.\n\nBut we have two E\'s? We don\'t know if the word has two E\'s? The first guess had only one E and it was marked present, but that doesn\'t rule out two E\'s. However, we have to be cautious.\n\nBut let\'s see: if we put E at 1 and R at 4, and A at 5, then the word is E _ T R A.\n\nWe need to fill the second position. What letter? It must be a letter that is not C, N, L and not conflicting.\n\nWe can try ""ENTER"": but N is not allowed (from first guess: N is absent). So skip.\n\nWe can try ""EIGHT"": but that has G and H, which are new. But the word would be E I G H T? But position 3 is T, so that would be E I G H T? But we need to have R in the word? We are putting R at 4? In ""EIGHT"", there is no R. So we must include R.\n\nWe must include R, A, and E.\n\nSo the word must have R, A, E, T, and one more letter (since it\'s 5 letters).\n\nWe have to put T at 3.\n\nSo the structure: \nPosition 1: ? (or E? but we are considering E at 1)\nPosition 2: ? (must be a letter not in {C, N, L} and not conflicting)\nPosition 3: T\nPosition 4: R (if we put R at 4) or another letter?\nPosition 5: ? (and A must be here? or another letter? but A can be at 5)\n\nBut we have to put A somewhere. If we put R at 4, then A must be at 1 or 5? But position 1: if we put E at 1, then A cannot be at 1. So A must be at 5? Then the word would be E ? T R A.\n\nBut we need to fill position 2. What letter? It must be a letter not in {C, N, L} and not conflicting.\n\nWe can try ""EATER"" but R at 5 is not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, we can put R at position 1? Then we have:\nPosition 1: R\nPosition 2: ? (must be a letter not in {C, N, L} and not conflicting)\nPosition 3: T\nPosition 4: ? \nPosition 5: ? \n\nAnd A must be in the word. A can be in 4 or 5? But if we put R at 1, then A cannot be at 1. So A can be at 4 or 5.\n\nIf we put A at 4, then the word: R ? T A ? \nBut we need to fill position 2 and 5.\n\nIf we put A at 5, then R ? T ? A.\n\nWe also have E to place. E can be in 1 or 2? But if we put R at 1, then E can be in 2.\n\nSo two possibilities:\n1. R ? T E A (with E at 4 and A at 5)\n2. R ? T A ? (with A at 4 and E at 2? or at 5? but if A at 4, then E can be at 2? but we have position 5 open)\n\nBut note: we have to avoid putting E at 4? We don\'t know if E can be at 4? Actually, we know from the second guess that E is not at position 4 (because we put it at 4 and got a minus). So E cannot be at 4. Therefore, in the first possibility, E is at 4, which is not allowed? So that\'s invalid.\n\nTherefore, in the first possibility, we cannot put E at 4. So we have to put E at 2? Then the word: R E T A ? \n\nBut then we have A at 4 and E at 2? Then position 5 is open.\n\nSo one possibility: R E T A ?\n\nBut we need a word. ""RETAB"" is not a word. ""RETAB"" is not a word.\n\nAlternatively, we can put R at 1, E at 2, and A at 4? Then the word: R E T A ?\n\nBut we need a word. ""RETAB"" is not a word.\n\nWe need valid words.\n\nAnother idea: put E at 1 and R at 4? Then we have E ? T R A.\n\nWhat words end with ""ETRA""? Not common. \n\nPut R at 4 and A at 1? But A cannot be at 1? Wait, no: A can be at 1? We haven\'t tried that. But we have E to place. If we put A at 1, then we have:\nPosition 1: A (but we know A is not at 2 or 3, but 1 is allowed? We haven\'t tried A at 1. But we know A is not at 2 or 3, so 1 is a possibility.)\nPosition 2: ? \nPosition 3: T\nPosition 4: R\nPosition 5: ?\n\nBut we have to include E. E can be at 1 or 2? But if we put A at 1, then E cannot be at 1? So E must be at 2.\n\nSo the word: A E T R ? \n\nBut we need a word. ""AETRA"" is not a word.\n\nAlternatively, we can put R at 1 and A at 5? Then E must be at 2 (since it can be at 1 or 2, but 1 is taken by R). So:\nPosition 1: R\nPosition 2: E\nPosition 3: T\nPosition 4: ? \nPosition 5: A\n\nThen the word: R E T ? A\n\nWhat words? ""RETIA"" (not common), ""REATA"" (not common), ""RESTA"" (not a word), ""RETSA"" (not common), ""REATA"" (not common). \n\nThis is difficult.\n\nPut R at 4 and A at 5? Then:\nPosition 1: ? \nPosition 2: ? \nPosition 3: T\nPosition 4: R\nPosition 5: A\n\nAnd E must be at 1 or 2? But position 1: if we put E, then the word: E ? T R A.\n\nWhat words? ""ETRA"" at the end? ""EATER"" is E A T E R -> but that has A at 2 and E at 4? But we are putting A at 5 and E at 1? So that doesn\'t match.\n\nWe need E at 1: so ""E _ T R A"". Words: ""EATER"" is E A T E R -> but that has A at 2 and E at 4? Not matching.\n\nActually, we need the pattern: E ? T R A -> so the second letter is unknown.\n\nWords: ""EIGHT"" is E I G H T -> no R and no A? But we must have A.\n\nWe need a word that has E, T, R, A. But we have T at 3, R at 4, A at 5, and E at 1.\n\nSo the word must be: E ? T R A.\n\nWhat letters can we put in the second position? We need a letter that is not C, N, L and not conflicting.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""EATER"": but that has A at 2 and E at 4? No, that\'s E A T E R -> positions: E(1), A(2), T(3), E(4), R(5). But we need R at 4 and A at 5? So that doesn\'t match.\n\nWe need R at 4 and A at 5: so the word must end with ""RA"". But then the last two letters are R and A? So the word is ... R A.\n\nBut we have E at 1, then a letter at 2, then T at 3, then R at 4, then A at 5.\n\nSo the word: E X T R A, where X is the unknown letter.\n\nWhat words? ""ENTER"" is E N T E R -> but N is not allowed and also E at 4? Not matching.\n\nWe need a word that has the pattern E X T R A.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""EATER"" is E A T E R -> but that has A at 2 and E at 4? And R at 5? But we need R at 4 and A at 5? So no.\n\nAnother: ""EXTRA"": \n- X = E, then position 2: X = E? But we are putting E at 1? Then the word would be E X T R A. If X = E, then we have E at 1, E at 2? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, ""EXTRA"" has X = E, then position 2 is X? So E at 1 and E at 2? But we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s.\n\nBut let\'s check the feedback: in the first guess, we had E and it was present, but we don\'t know if there is a second E. Similarly, in the second guess, we had E and it was present but not at 4.\n\nBut we also have to consider that the word must have exactly the letters: E, T, R, A, and one more.\n\nWe know the word has R, A, E, T, and one more. So if we allow two E\'s, then ""EXTRA"" has two E\'s? But ""EXTRA"" is E X T R A -> so positions: E(1), X(2), T(3), R(4), A(5). This matches the pattern.\n\nBut we have to check if X can be E? We don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. But it\'s possible.\n\nHowever, we have to avoid C, N, L. ""EXTRA"" has X (which is not C, N, L) and E at 1 and 2? But we are only required to have one E? Actually, the feedback from the first guess had only one E and it was marked present, but that doesn\'t rule out two E\'s. The feedback for the second guess also had only one E and it was marked present (but not at 4). So it could have two E\'s.\n\nBut we also have to consider the feedback: if the word had two E\'s, then in the second guess (when we put E at 4) we would have gotten a minus for E? But if there is an E at 1, then when we put E at 4, we get a minus because the E is present but not at 4. Similarly, if there is an E at 2, then we get a minus for E at 4? But we don\'t know if there are two E\'s.\n\nHowever, we must avoid using letters we know are absent: C, N, L. ""EXTRA"" has X and E, T, R, A. X is not forbidden.\n\nBut we have to check if E is allowed at position 1? We don\'t have any feedback that E cannot be at 1. We only know E is not at 4 or 5.\n\nSimilarly, R is at 4: we know R is not at 2 or 5, so 4 is allowed.\n\nA is at 5: we know A is not at 2 or 3, so 5 is allowed.\n\nSo ""EXTRA"" is a candidate.\n\nBut let me see if there are other possibilities.\n\nAnother candidate: put R at 1 and A at 4? Then we have:\nPosition 1: R\nPosition 2: ? \nPosition 3: T\nPosition 4: A\nPosition 5: ? \n\nAnd E must be at 1 or 2? But position 1: if we put E, then word: E X T A ? \n\nWhat words? ""ETAMA"" (not common), ""ETALA"" (not common). \n\nOr if we put E at 2: then word: X E T A ? \n\nWhat words? ""SETAE"" (not common), ""METAL"" -> but L is not allowed. \n\nSo ""EXTRA"" seems a good candidate.\n\nBut wait: in ""EXTRA"", we have two E\'s. We don\'t know if that\'s allowed. But it\'s possible.\n\nAnother candidate: put R at 4 and A at 1? But A at 1 is allowed? Then we have:\nPosition 1: A\nPosition 2: ? \nPosition 3: T\nPosition 4: R\nPosition 5: ? \n\nAnd E must be at 1 or 2? But position 1 is taken by A, so E must be at 2.\n\nSo the word: A E T R ? \n\nWhat words? ""AETRA"" (not common), ""AETER"" (not common). \n\nOr if we put E at 1: then A at 2? But A cannot be at 2? We know A is not at 2 (from second guess: we put A at 2 and got a minus). So A cannot be at 2. Therefore, we cannot put A at 2.\n\nSo if we put A at 1, then E at 2: then the word: A E T R ? \n\nWhat words? ""AETRA"" (not common), ""AETER"" (not common). \n\nAlternatively, put R at 1 and A at 4? Then:\nPosition 1: R\nPosition 2: ? \nPosition 3: T\nPosition 4: A\nPosition 5: ? \n\nAnd E must be at 1 or 2? But position 1: if we put E, then word: E X T A ? \n\nWhat words? ""ETALA"" (not common), ""ETAMA"" (not common). \n\nOr if we put E at 2: then position 1 is something else. But we need a word. ""X E T A ?"" -> ""SETAE"" (not common). \n\nSo ""EXTRA"" seems a good candidate.\n\nBut let me check if there are other words that fit the pattern without duplicates.\n\nWhat about ""ARTET""? Not a word.\n\nOr ""RESTA"" -> but R is at 1, E at 2, S at 3? But position 3 must be T. So no.\n\nAnother idea: put R at 1 and E at 2? Then we have:\nPosition 1: R\nPosition 2: E\nPosition 3: T\nPosition 4: ? \nPosition 5: ? \n\nAnd A must be at 4 or 5? But we have two positions: 4 and 5. And we can put A at 4 and then a new letter at 5? Or A at 5 and a new letter at 4.\n\nBut we also have to include A. So we can put A at 4 and then a new letter at 5.\n\nBut we need a word: ? E T ? A -> but we need to put a letter at 1 and 4? And we know R is in the word, so we can put R at 1? But we are already using R at 1? And we are trying to test R at 1? But we haven\'t tried R at 1.\n\nActually, we can try R at 1, E at 2, T at 3, and then for position 4 and 5, we put A and a new letter? But we have to put A in the word. So if we put A at 4, then position 5 is open. But we also have to include E? We have E at 2, so that\'s one E. Then we have A at 4 and a new letter at 5.\n\nBut we need a word: R E T A ? -> but that\'s 5 letters? R E T A ? -> ""RETA"" is not 5 letters. \n\nWe need a 5-letter word. ""RETA"" is 4 letters.\n\nHow about ""REATA""? But that\'s 5 letters? R E A T A -> but that has A at 3? We know A cannot be at 3. Also, we are putting A at 3? But we know A is not at 3. So we cannot put A at 3.\n\nIn our structure, if we put R at 1, E at 2, T at 3, then we have positions 4 and 5. We want to put A at 4? But then we have two A\'s? Or we put A at 5.\n\nSo if we put A at 4? But we don\'t know if A can be at 4. We haven\'t tried that. But we know A is not at 2 or 3, so 4 is possible.\n\nBut we also have to consider that the word must have the letter A. So we can put A at 4? Then the word: R E T A ?\n\nWhat words? ""RETA"" is 4 letters. We need 5. ""RETAS"" -> but S at 5? And we have A at 4? Then the word: R E T A S -> ""RETAS"" is a word? It\'s the plural ofreta? Not common. \n\n""RETA"" is not 5.\n\nAnother word: ""RESTA"" -> but R E S T A -> position 3 is S? But we need position 3 to be T. So no.\n\nSo it\'s hard to find a word with R at 1, E at 2, T at 3, and A at 4? Because then we have ""RETA"" with a letter in between? But we need a word like ""RETA"" plus one letter? Not possible.\n\nTherefore, the only candidate I see is ""EXTRA"".\n\nBut let me confirm: \n- E at 1: we don\'t know if E can be at 1? We only know E is not at 4 or 5. So it can be at 1.\n- X: we don\'t know, but it must be a letter not in {C, N, L} and not conflicting.\n- T at 3: fixed.\n- R at 4: we know R is not at 2 or 5, so 4 is allowed.\n- A at 5: we know A is not at 2 or 3, so 5 is allowed.\n\nAnd we are testing:\n- If E is at 1: if it is, we get a check? But we don\'t know.\n- We are testing X (which is the second letter) and also the position of E at 1.\n\nBut note: we are also testing the position of R at 4 and A at 5.\n\nWe can also test a new letter at position 2.\n\nBut we have to avoid using forbidden letters: C, N, L.\n\nSo ""EXTRA"" is a valid word and fits the constraints.\n\nBut wait: in ""EXTRA"", the second letter is X. We haven\'t tested X. And we know the word has R, A, E, T, and one more. If X is not the fifth letter? Actually, ""EXTRA"" has 5 letters: E, X, T, R, A.\n\nSo the fifth letter is A. We know A is in the word, so that\'s fine.\n\nBut we have to consider: what if the word has only one E? Then ""EXTRA"" has two E\'s? That might be a problem? But the feedback so far hasn\'t indicated duplicates, but it\'s possible.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t duplicate E to test the positions without assuming duplicates.\n\nBut we have to include all the known letters: R, A, E, T.\n\nWe have T fixed at 3.\n\nWe can try to put R at 1, A at 4, and E at 2? But we couldn\'t find a word.\n\nAnother candidate: put R at 4, A at 1, and E at 2? But we have to fill position 5.\n\nSo structure: A E T R ? \n\nWhat words? ""AETER"" (not common), ""AETRA"" (not common). \n\nOr put A at 1, E at 2, R at 4, and then position 5 is open. But we need a word: A E T R ? \n\n""AETR?"" -> not a word.\n\nPut R at 1, E at 2, and A at 4? Then we have A at 4? Then the word: R E T A ? \n\nBut we need a word. ""RETA"" is 4 letters. We need 5. ""RETAB"" is not a word. ""RETAQ"" not a word.\n\nSo I think ""EXTRA"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me think of other words that have T at 3 and include R, A, E.\n\nFor example: ""PARTY"" -> but no R and no E? We must have R and A and E.\n\nAnother: ""ARTSY"" -> no R, E, A? \n\nWe must have the letters R, A, E.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""EXTRA"".\n\nBut note: in ""EXTRA"", we are putting E at 1. We don\'t know if that\'s correct. We are testing R at 4 and A at 5.\n\nIf we get feedback that E is correct at 1, then we know. Similarly for others.\n\nBut we also test the letter X.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that uses more new letters to get information.\n\nBut we have to include the known letters.\n\nAnother word: ""TARES"" -> but we know T is at 3, so we cannot put T at 5? And we have T at 3 fixed. Also, we have to avoid using N (which is absent). So skip.\n\n""TARES"" has T at 1? But we don\'t have T at 3 fixed? In ""TARES"", T is at 1, so that wouldn\'t work because position 3 is not T.\n\nWe must have T at position 3.\n\nSo the word must have T at 3.\n\nAnother word: ""STARE"" -> but we know A is not at 3? And in ""STARE"", A is at 3? So we cannot put A at 3. Also, we have to avoid using S? We haven\'t tested S, but we can use it. But in ""STARE"", A is at 3, which is not allowed.\n\nWe cannot put A at 3.\n\nHow about ""STEAR""? But that\'s not a common word. And it has E at 4? But we know E is not at 4? From second guess, E at 4 got a minus. So we cannot put E at 4.\n\nSo we must avoid putting E at 4 and A at 2,3,4,5? But we can put A at 4 or 5, and E at 1 or 2.\n\nBut in ""STEAR"", if we put E at 4? Not allowed.\n\nSo back to ""EXTRA"".\n\nAnother candidate: ""DATER"" -> D A T E R -> but we have A at 2? We know A is not at 2 (from second guess: we put A at 2 and got a minus). So we cannot put A at 2.\n\nIn ""DATER"", A is at 2 -> not allowed.\n\n""RATER"": R A T E R -> but R at 1 and 5? We know R is not at 5. Also, A at 2 -> not allowed.\n\nSo ""EXTRA"" seems a good choice.\n\nBut let me check: in ""EXTRA"", we have:\n- E at 1: we are testing if E is at 1.\n- X at 2: new letter.\n- T at 3: fixed and correct.\n- R at 4: testing if R is at 4.\n- A at 5: testing if A is at 5.\n\nWe also test X.\n\nIf we get:\n- E at 1: if it\'s correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or x? But we know E is in the word, so if not at 1, we get a minus.\n\nSimilarly for R at 4 and A at 5.\n\nAnd we get information about X.\n\nBut note: we are putting R at 4. We know R is in the word, so if it\'s not at 4, we get a minus. Similarly for A at 5.\n\nWe also get information about X.\n\nSo I think it\'s a good guess.\n\nBut wait: we have to avoid using forbidden letters. X is not forbidden? We haven\'t tested X and it\'s not C, N, L.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""EXTRA"".\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""EXTRA"" is a valid word.\n\nSo my third guess: ""EXTRA""\n\nBut let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters.\n\nAnother candidate: ""STEAR"" -> but that\'s not common and E at 4 is not allowed.\n\n""STARE"" is not allowed because A at 3.\n\n""TRIED"" -> T R I E D -> but R is at 2? We know R is not at 2. So we cannot put R at 2.\n\nWe must avoid putting R at 2.\n\nIn ""TRIED"", R is at 2 -> not allowed.\n\n""TRIBE"" -> no R and no A? \n\nI think ""EXTRA"" is acceptable.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""EXTRA"".\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t have evidence for duplicates, but it\'s possible.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""DRAFT"" -> but no E? We must include E.\n\nWe must include all the known letters: R, A, E, T.\n\nSo ""EXTRA"" includes all.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""EXTRA"".\n\n<guess>extra</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)  \n  - **C** and **N** are absent from the secret word.  \n  - **R**, **A**, and **E** are present but in incorrect positions:  \n    - R cannot be in position 2.  \n    - A cannot be in position 3.  \n    - E cannot be in position 5.  \n\n- **Guess 2: later** → Feedback: L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(-) R(-)  \n  - **L** is absent.  \n  - **T** is correct and in position 3 (fixed).  \n  - **A** is present but not in position 2.  \n  - **E** is present but not in position 4.  \n  - **R** is present but not in position 5.  \n\n### Analysis:\n- **Confirmed letters**: R, A, E, T (T is fixed at position 3).  \n- **Absent letters**: C, N, L.  \n- **Position constraints**:  \n  - R: Cannot be in positions 2 or 5 → must be in 1 or 4.  \n  - A: Cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → must be in 1, 4, or 5.  \n  - E: Cannot be in positions 4 or 5 → must be in 1 or 2.  \n- **Unknowns**: Two additional letters (not C, N, L) need to be discovered.  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- Test the possible positions for R, A, and E while introducing new common letters.  \n- **""extra""** is chosen because:  \n  - Fits the position constraints:  \n    - E at position 1 (tests if E is in position 1).  \n    - R at position 4 (tests if R is in position 4).  \n    - A at position 5 (tests if A is in position 5).  \n  - Includes all known letters (R, A, E, T) and avoids absent letters (C, N, L).  \n  - Uses new common letters (X) for position 2 to test for presence/absence and position.  \n- If E is not in position 1, we get feedback on E\'s correct position. Similarly, R and A positions will be narrowed down.\n\n<guess>extra</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: later -> FEEDBACK: L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(-) R(-)\nGuess 3: extra -> FEEDBACK: E(-) X(x) T(✓) R(-) A(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)

Guess 2: ""later""
- L: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- T: ✓ (correct, in position 3)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 4)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 5)

Guess 3: ""extra""
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 1)
- X: x (not in the word)
- T: ✓ (correct, in position 3)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 4)
- A: ✓ (correct, in position 5)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. Correct letters:
   - T is in position 3 (fixed).
   - A is in position 5 (from guess 3: A is correct at position 5).

2. Present letters (but not yet positioned):
   - R: 
     - From guess 1: not in position 2.
     - From guess 2: not in position 5.
     - From guess 3: not in position 4.
     - So R must be in position 1 (since position 3 is taken by T, and positions 2,4,5 are ruled out). Therefore, R is in position 1.
   - E:
     - From guess 1: not in position 5.
     - From guess 2: not in position 4.
     - From guess 3: not in position 1.
     - So E must be in position 2 (since position 3 is taken by T, and positions 1,4,5 are ruled out). Therefore, E is in position 2.
   - A: we now know it's in position 5 (from guess 3).

3. Absent letters: C, N, L, X (from guesses 1,2,3).

4. Position 3 is T.

So the secret word has:
- Position 1: R (we just deduced)
- Position 2: E (we just deduced)
- Position 3: T
- Position 4: ? (unknown)
- Position 5: A

Therefore, the word so far is: R E T ? A

We only need to find the fourth letter.

What can the fourth letter be?
- It must be a letter that is not in the absent list: C, N, L, X.
- It must form a valid English word.

We know the word is ""R E T ? A"", and we need the fourth letter.

What are possible letters for the fourth position?
- It must be a consonant or vowel that can form a word with ""RET_A"".

Common words:
- ""RETA"" is 4 letters, not 5.
- ""RETAQ"" is not a word.
- ""RETAG"" is not a word.

Actually, the only common word is ""RETA"" with a suffix? But ""reta"" is not 5 letters.

Perhaps ""REBAR"" -> but that has B and no A? Not matching.

We need the word to end with ""A"". So the pattern is RET?A.

What letters can we put in the fourth position to form a word?
- ""RETA"" is 4 letters. We need 5. So the fourth letter must be the last letter? But ""RET"" + letter + ""A"" -> the word must be 5 letters: R E T X A.

What X can we use? 
- We need X such that ""RETXA"" is a word.

Possible X:
- ""RETA"" is the base, but we need 5 letters. So we can't use ""RETA"" as is.

Actually, the word is ""R E T X A"", so the fourth letter is X.

What letters are possible?
- We can try ""RETA"" with a letter? But ""reta"" is not 5 letters. The word must have 5 letters: R, E, T, X, A.

So X must be a letter that forms a word. Let me think:

- ""RETAG"" is not a word.
- ""REBRA"" -> no.
- ""REFFA"" -> no.

Common words: 
- ""REATA"" -> but that's 5 letters? R E A T A -> but then position 4 is T? Then the word would be R E T T A? That's not ""RETA"" but ""RETA"" is 4 letters.

Actually, the word ""RETA"" is 4 letters. We need a 5-letter word.

Perhaps ""REATA"" is not standard. Another word: ""RECAP"" -> but C is absent and position 3 is T, so no.

Wait, what about ""REHAB""? But that's R E H A B -> but position 5 is B, not A. We know position 5 is A.

So the word must end with A: R E T ? A.

What about ""RETTA""? Not a word.

""REBRA"" -> no.

Perhaps we missed something: the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication.

Another idea: ""REMAA"" -> no.

This is tricky. Let me think of words that start with ""RET"" and end with ""A"".

Actually, ""reta"" is not 5. But we can think of words like ""rett a"" -> no.

Perhaps ""REACT"" -> but C is absent and position 3 is T, so no.

Wait, what about ""REACT""? It has C and T at 3, but C is absent.

Another word: ""REUSE"" -> but position 5 is E, not A.

We know position 5 is A.

So the word is R E T ? A.

What about ""RETA"" with a suffix? Not possible.

Perhaps ""REBAR"" is R E B A R -> but then position 5 is R, not A. And we have A at 4? But we know A is at 5.

So the word must be R E T X A.

What X can we use? Let me search for words:

- ""RETA"" is 4 letters. The next is ""RETAQ"" which is not a word.

But what about ""RETAG""? Not a word.

""REMA"" is 4 letters.

""REUSE"" is R E U S E -> position 5 is E, not A.

""RETIA"" -> R E T I A -> that's 5 letters? ""RETIA"" is a word? It's a proper noun? Not common. But let's check: in word games, it might be accepted? But we need common words.

""RETSA"" -> not common.

""RETA"" is 4.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might be ""REATA""? But that's 5 letters: R-E-T-A-T-A? No, ""REATA"" is spelled R-E-T-A-T-A? That's 6 letters.

Wait, ""REATA"" is 6 letters.

Another word: ""REBRA"" -> no.

Perhaps ""RECAP"" is out because of C.

Wait, what about ""REHAB""? R E H A B -> position 5 is B, not A.

We need position 5 to be A.

So the word is R E T ? A.

Perhaps ""RETTA"" is not a word.

I recall: ""REATA"" is not standard. But ""RETA"" is 4.

Another possibility: ""REMAN"" -> but position 5 is N, not A, and N is absent.

""REBAR"" -> R E B A R -> position 5 is R, not A.

This is confusing.

Perhaps we made a mistake in deducing the positions.

Let me reexamine the feedback for guess 3: ""extra""

Feedback: E(-) X(x) T(✓) R(-) A(✓)

For ""extra"":
- E at position 1: got a minus, so E is not at 1.
- X at position 2: got x, so X is not in the word.
- T at position 3: got check, so T is correct at 3.
- R at position 4: got a minus, so R is not at 4.
- A at position 5: got check, so A is correct at 5.

But we already knew A was at 5 from guess 3? Actually, we didn't: we knew A was at 5 from the feedback of guess 3? Let me check:

Guess 3: ""extra""
- E: position 1 -> minus: E is in the word but not at 1.
- A: position 5 -> check: A is correct at 5.

So we knew A was at 5.

But for R: we thought R was at 1? But in guess 3, R was at 4 and got a minus, so R is not at 4. And from guess 1, R is not at 2. Guess 2: R is not at 5. So R must be at 1? But we haven't guessed R at 1 yet.

Similarly, E: in guess 3, E at 1 got a minus, so E is not at 1. From guess 1, E is not at 5. Guess 2: E is not at 4. So E must be at 2? Because position 3 is T, so E can be at 2.

And we have R: from guess 1, R not at 2; guess 2, R not at 5; guess 3, R not at 4. So R must be at 1.

Therefore, the word is R E T ? A.

Now, what can the fourth letter be? It must form a valid English word.

Possible words: 
- ""RETA"" is 4 letters. We need 5. So we need a 5-letter word starting with ""RET"" and ending with ""A"".

Common 5-letter words: 
- ""REATA"" is 6 letters.
- ""RETA"" is 4.

But there is ""RETAQ"" which is not a word.

Perhaps ""RETIA"" is a proper noun? Not common.

""RETSA"" is not common.

""RETA"" is the root, so we need a word like ""RETA"" + one letter? But that doesn't work.

Another word: ""REUSE"" is R E U S E -> position 5 is E, not A.

""REHAB"" is R E H A B -> position 5 is B, not A.

""RECAP"" has C and position 3 is not T.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might have the fourth letter as a letter that forms a word.

Let me list possible words: 
- ""REBAR"" is R E B A R -> position 5 is R, not A.
- ""REMAN"" is R E M A N -> position 5 is N, not A, and N is absent.
- ""RENAA"" -> no.

Perhaps we made a mistake in the feedback of guess 3? Let me recheck the feedback for guess 3.

Guess 3: ""extra""
- E at 1: minus -> E is present but not at 1.
- X at 2: x -> X is absent.
- T at 3: check -> T is correct at 3.
- R at 4: minus -> R is present but not at 4.
- A at 5: check -> A is correct at 5.

But we already knew A was at 5 from the previous feedback? Actually, we didn't: we knew A was at 5 from guess 2: A was at 2 and got a minus, and from guess 3: A at 5 is correct. So we knew A was at 5.

But for R: we thought R was at 1? But in guess 3, R was at 4 and got a minus, so R is not at 4. And from guess 1, R is not at 2. Guess 2: R is not at 5. So R must be at 1.

Similarly, E: in guess 3, E at 1 got a minus, so E is not at 1. From guess 1, E is not at 5. Guess 2: E is not at 4. So E must be at 2.

Therefore, the word is R E T ? A.

Now, what can the fourth letter be? It must be a letter that forms a valid English word with ""RET_A"".

Possible letters: 
- ""RETA"" is 4, so we need a 5-letter word. The only common one is ""REATA"" which is 6 letters.

But there is ""RETA"" as a root, so perhaps ""RETA"" with a suffix? But no common 5-letter word.

Perhaps we missed ""RETAG""? Not a word.

Another idea: ""REHAB"" is 5 letters but ends with B, not A.

""REUSE"" ends with E.

""RETCH"" has C and H, but position 5 is H, not A.

""REACT"" has C and not T at 3.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might have the fourth letter as a vowel or consonant.

Let me think of words: 
- ""REATA"" is not 5.
- ""REBRA"" is not 5.

Perhaps ""RETIA"" is 5 letters? It's a word: RETIA is a proper noun? But in word games, it might be accepted? But we need common words.

Common words: 
- ""REATA"" is 6.
- ""RETA"" is 4.

But there is ""RETAQ"" which is not a word.

Perhaps ""REMAN"" is 5 but ends with N.

I think we have a problem. Maybe we made a mistake in the feedback of guess 3? But let's see.

Alternative: perhaps the word is not ""extra"" and we have to try another word.

But we have to make a guess.

We know the word is R E T ? A.

The fourth letter must be a letter that forms a word. Let me list possible letters for the fourth position that make a valid English word.

Possible words: 
- ""RETA"" is 4, so we need a 5-letter word. The only common one is ""REATA"" which is 6 letters. But 6 letters.

Perhaps ""RETA"" with a suffix? But no.

Another word: ""REBAR"" is 5 but ends with R, not A.

""REHAB"" ends with B.

""REUSE"" ends with E.

""RETCH"" ends with H.

""REACT"" has C.

Perhaps ""REACT"" is not possible because of C.

I recall: ""REATA"" is not standard. But ""RETA"" is 4, so we need a 5-letter word.

Perhaps ""RETIA"" is 5 letters? It's a word: RETIA is a medical term? But it's 5 letters: R-E-T-I-A.

Yes, ""RETIA"" is 5 letters. It's a valid word.

But in ""RETIA"", the fourth letter is I.

So the word is R E T I A.

But we have to check if that matches the feedback.

For guess 3: ""extra""
- We had E at 1: got minus -> in ""RETIA"", E is at 2, so that's correct. E is not at 1.
- X at 2: we had X, but in ""RETIA"", position 2 is I, so X is not in the word -> correct.
- T at 3: correct.
- R at 4: in ""extra"", R was at 4 and got minus, but in ""RETIA"", R is at 1, not 4 -> so R at 4 is not in the word? But wait, in ""RETIA"", R is at 1, so when we guessed R at 4, it should have given a minus because R is present but not at 4. That matches.

Also, A at 5: in ""extra"", A at 5 is correct, and in ""RETIA"", A is at 5.

Now, for the fourth letter: in ""RETIA"", the fourth letter is I.

Is I allowed? We haven't tested I. And it's not in the absent list (C, N, L, X).

So ""RETIA"" is a candidate.

But we have to check if it matches the first guess.

First guess: ""crane""
- C: absent -> correct, because ""RETIA"" has no C.
- R: present but not at 2 -> in ""RETIA"", R is at 1, so not at 2 -> correct.
- A: present but not at 3 -> in ""RETIA"", A is at 5, not at 3 -> correct.
- N: absent -> correct.
- E: present but not at 5 -> in ""RETIA"", E is at 2, not at 5 -> correct.

Second guess: ""later""
- L: absent -> correct.
- A: present but not at 2 -> in ""RETIA"", A is at 5, not at 2 -> correct.
- T: at position 3 -> correct.
- E: present but not at 4 -> in ""RETIA"", E is at 2, not at 4 -> correct.
- R: present but not at 5 -> in ""RETIA"", R is at 1, not at 5 -> correct.

Third guess: ""extra""
- E: present but not at 1 -> in ""RETIA"", E is at 2, so not at 1 -> correct.
- X: absent -> correct, because ""RETIA"" has no X.
- T: at 3 -> correct.
- R: present but not at 4 -> in ""RETIA"", R is at 1, so not at 4 -> correct.
- A: at 5 -> correct.

So ""RETIA"" fits all the feedback.

But is ""RETIA"" a valid word? It is a noun meaning a type of tree or a medical term. It might be accepted in word games.

But we have to consider that the word might be ""REATA"" but it's 6 letters. So ""RETIA"" is a possibility.

But let me see if there are other words.

Another word: ""RETAQ"" is not a word.

""RETAG"" is not a word.

""REHAB"" is R E H A B -> but position 5 is B, not A.

""REUSE"" is R E U S E -> position 5 is E, not A.

""REACT"" has C.

""REBAR"" is R E B A R -> position 5 is R, not A.

So ""RETIA"" seems to be the only common word that fits.

But what about ""RETA"" with a suffix? No.

Perhaps ""REMAN"" is 5 but ends with N.

I think ""RETIA"" is a strong candidate.

But we have to make sure that the letter I is not absent? We haven't tested I. So it could be.

But we have only 6 tries, and we are on guess 4. We can guess ""RETIA"".

But let me confirm the feedback for ""RETIA"" with previous guesses:

- Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C absent, R present (at 1, not 2), A present (at 5, not 3), N absent, E present (at 2, not 5) -> matches.
- Guess 2: ""later"" -> L absent, A present (at 5, not 2), T correct at 3, E present (at 2, not 4), R present (at 1, not 5) -> matches.
- Guess 3: ""extra"" -> E present (at 2, not 1), X absent, T correct at 3, R present (at 1, not 4), A correct at 5 -> matches.

So if we guess ""RETIA"", it should be correct.

But we are not 100% sure. There might be other words.

Another word: ""RETA"" is 4, so we need a 5-letter word. What about ""RETAQ""? Not a word.

""RETAG"" is not a word.

""REHAB"" is not ending with A.

Perhaps ""REUSE"" is not ending with A.

I think ""RETIA"" is the only common word that fits.

But let me think of ""REATA"": it is 6 letters, so not.

""REBAR"" is not ending with A.

So I think we should guess ""RETIA"".

But note: in ""RETIA"", the fourth letter is I. We haven't tested I, and it's not in the absent list.

So the next guess is ""RETIA"".

But we are on guess 4, and if ""RETIA"" is the word, we get it. If not, we get feedback.

But since it fits, we can try.

To be safe, we can try a word that tests the fourth position with a new letter, but we only have one letter missing.

We can try ""REHAB"" but it doesn't end with A.

We must have the word be R E T ? A.

So the only common word is ""RETIA"".

Perhaps ""RETA"" with a suffix? But no.

Another word: ""REMAN"" is not ending with A.

I think we should go with ""RETIA"".

But let me double-check the positions:

We deduced:
- Position 1: R
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: T
- Position 4: ? (unknown)
- Position 5: A

And the word must be R E T X A.

What X can we use? 

Possible X:
- I: as in ""RETIA"" -> valid word, medical term.
- J: ""RETAJ"" not a word.
- K: ""RETKA"" not a word.
- M: ""RETM A"" not a word.
- P: ""RETPA"" not a word.
- Q: ""RETAQ"" not a word.
- S: ""RETS A"" -> ""RETSA"" is not common, and S is new.
- U: ""RETAU"" not a word.
- V: ""RETV A"" not a word.
- W: ""RETW A"" not a word.
- Y: ""RETYA"" not a word.
- Z: ""RETZ A"" not a word.

So only I is possible? What about ""REBAR"" -> but that's R E B A R, which is not ending with A.

Another word: ""RECAP"" has C and position 3 is not T.

Perhaps ""REHAB"" is not ending with A.

I think ""RETIA"" is the only common word that fits.

But let me search online or in my mind: 
- ""REATA"" is 6 letters.
- ""RETA"" is 4.
- ""RETAG"" is not a word.
- ""RETAQ"" not a word.

Perhaps ""REMAN"" is 5 but ends with N.

Another word: ""REUSE"" ends with E.

I think we have to go with ""RETIA"".

But we have to confirm: is ""RETIA"" a valid word? According to some dictionaries, ""retia"" is a noun meaning a tree or a part of the body. It is in the Wordle dictionary.

To be safe, we can guess ""RETIA"".

But we have to make a guess.

Perhaps we can try a word that tests the fourth position with a new letter, but we only have one position to determine.

We can try ""REHAB"" but it doesn't end with A.

We must have the word be R E T X A.

So I think ""RETIA"" is the only reasonable guess.

Therefore, we guess ""RETIA"".

But note: we are on guess 4, and if we guess ""RETIA"", it might be correct.

If not, we get feedback on the fourth letter.

But since we have deduced that the word must be R E T ? A, and the only common word is ""RETIA"", we can try that.

So the next guess is ""RETIA"".

But let me write it in the required format.

<guess>retia</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we have deduced the following:

- **Position 1**: R (must be, since R cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 5, and position 3 is T).
- **Position 2**: E (must be, since E cannot be in positions 1, 4, or 5, and position 1 is R and position 3 is T).
- **Position 3**: T (confirmed in both Guess 2 and Guess 3).
- **Position 4**: Unknown, but must be a letter not in {C, N, L, X} and form a valid English word.
- **Position 5**: A (confirmed in Guess 3).

The secret word must be of the form: **R E T ? A**.

After evaluating possible words, **""RETIA""** is the only common English word that fits this pattern. It is a valid 5-letter word (meaning a tree or a medical term), uses the letter I (which is not excluded), and matches all feedback:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: R is present (not position 2), A is present (not position 3), E is present (not position 5), and C/N are absent.
- **Guess 2 (later)**: T is correct (position 3), A is present (not position 2), E is present (not position 4), R is present (not position 5), and L is absent.
- **Guess 3 (extra)**: E is present (not position 1), X is absent, T is correct (position 3), R is present (not position 4), A is correct (position 5).

This guess will confirm if **I** is the missing letter. If correct, the word is solved.

<guess>retia</guess>",retia,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)

Guess 2: ""later""
- L: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- T: ✓ (correct, in position 3)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 4)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 5)

Guess 3: ""extra""
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 1)
- X: x (not in the word)
- T: ✓ (correct, in position 3)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 4)
- A: ✓ (correct, in position 5)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. Correct letters:
   - T is in position 3 (fixed).
   - A is in position 5 (from guess 3: A is correct at position 5).

2. Present letters (but not yet positioned):
   - R: 
     - From guess 1: not in position 2.
     - From guess 2: not in position 5.
     - From guess 3: not in position 4.
     - So R must be in position 1 (since position 3 is taken by T, and positions 2,4,5 are ruled out). Therefore, R is in position 1.
   - E:
     - From guess 1: not in position 5.
     - From guess 2: not in position 4.
     - From guess 3: not in position 1.
     - So E must be in position 2 (since position 3 is taken by T, and positions 1,4,5 are ruled out). Therefore, E is in position 2.
   - A: we now know it's in position 5 (from guess 3).

3. Absent letters: C, N, L, X (from guesses 1,2,3).

4. Position 3 is T.

So the secret word has:
- Position 1: R (we just deduced)
- Position 2: E (we just deduced)
- Position 3: T
- Position 4: ? (unknown)
- Position 5: A

Therefore, the word so far is: R E T ? A

We only need to find the fourth letter.

What can the fourth letter be?
- It must be a letter that is not in the absent list: C, N, L, X.
- It must form a valid English word.

We know the word is ""R E T ? A"", and we need the fourth letter.

What are possible letters for the fourth position?
- It must be a consonant or vowel that can form a word with ""RET_A"".

Common words:
- ""RETA"" is 4 letters, not 5.
- ""RETAQ"" is not a word.
- ""RETAG"" is not a word.

Actually, the only common word is ""RETA"" with a suffix? But ""reta"" is not 5 letters.

Perhaps ""REBAR"" -> but that has B and no A? Not matching.

We need the word to end with ""A"". So the pattern is RET?A.

What letters can we put in the fourth position to form a word?
- ""RETA"" is 4 letters. We need 5. So the fourth letter must be the last letter? But ""RET"" + letter + ""A"" -> the word must be 5 letters: R E T X A.

What X can we use? 
- We need X such that ""RETXA"" is a word.

Possible X:
- ""RETA"" is the base, but we need 5 letters. So we can't use ""RETA"" as is.

Actually, the word is ""R E T X A"", so the fourth letter is X.

What letters are possible?
- We can try ""RETA"" with a letter? But ""reta"" is not 5 letters. The word must have 5 letters: R, E, T, X, A.

So X must be a letter that forms a word. Let me think:

- ""RETAG"" is not a word.
- ""REBRA"" -> no.
- ""REFFA"" -> no.

Common words: 
- ""REATA"" -> but that's 5 letters? R E A T A -> but then position 4 is T? Then the word would be R E T T A? That's not ""RETA"" but ""RETA"" is 4 letters.

Actually, the word ""RETA"" is 4 letters. We need a 5-letter word.

Perhaps ""REATA"" is not standard. Another word: ""RECAP"" -> but C is absent and position 3 is T, so no.

Wait, what about ""REHAB""? But that's R E H A B -> but position 5 is B, not A. We know position 5 is A.

So the word must end with A: R E T ? A.

What about ""RETTA""? Not a word.

""REBRA"" -> no.

Perhaps we missed something: the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication.

Another idea: ""REMAA"" -> no.

This is tricky. Let me think of words that start with ""RET"" and end with ""A"".

Actually, ""reta"" is not 5. But we can think of words like ""rett a"" -> no.

Perhaps ""REACT"" -> but C is absent and position 3 is T, so no.

Wait, what about ""REACT""? It has C and T at 3, but C is absent.

Another word: ""REUSE"" -> but position 5 is E, not A.

We know position 5 is A.

So the word is R E T ? A.

What about ""RETA"" with a suffix? Not possible.

Perhaps ""REBAR"" is R E B A R -> but then position 5 is R, not A. And we have A at 4? But we know A is at 5.

So the word must be R E T X A.

What X can we use? Let me search for words:

- ""RETA"" is 4 letters. The next is ""RETAQ"" which is not a word.

But what about ""RETAG""? Not a word.

""REMA"" is 4 letters.

""REUSE"" is R E U S E -> position 5 is E, not A.

""RETIA"" -> R E T I A -> that's 5 letters? ""RETIA"" is a word? It's a proper noun? Not common. But let's check: in word games, it might be accepted? But we need common words.

""RETSA"" -> not common.

""RETA"" is 4.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might be ""REATA""? But that's 5 letters: R-E-T-A-T-A? No, ""REATA"" is spelled R-E-T-A-T-A? That's 6 letters.

Wait, ""REATA"" is 6 letters.

Another word: ""REBRA"" -> no.

Perhaps ""RECAP"" is out because of C.

Wait, what about ""REHAB""? R E H A B -> position 5 is B, not A.

We need position 5 to be A.

So the word is R E T ? A.

Perhaps ""RETTA"" is not a word.

I recall: ""REATA"" is not standard. But ""RETA"" is 4.

Another possibility: ""REMAN"" -> but position 5 is N, not A, and N is absent.

""REBAR"" -> R E B A R -> position 5 is R, not A.

This is confusing.

Perhaps we made a mistake in deducing the positions.

Let me reexamine the feedback for guess 3: ""extra""

Feedback: E(-) X(x) T(✓) R(-) A(✓)

For ""extra"":
- E at position 1: got a minus, so E is not at 1.
- X at position 2: got x, so X is not in the word.
- T at position 3: got check, so T is correct at 3.
- R at position 4: got a minus, so R is not at 4.
- A at position 5: got check, so A is correct at 5.

But we already knew A was at 5 from guess 3? Actually, we didn't: we knew A was at 5 from the feedback of guess 3? Let me check:

Guess 3: ""extra""
- E: position 1 -> minus: E is in the word but not at 1.
- A: position 5 -> check: A is correct at 5.

So we knew A was at 5.

But for R: we thought R was at 1? But in guess 3, R was at 4 and got a minus, so R is not at 4. And from guess 1, R is not at 2. Guess 2: R is not at 5. So R must be at 1? But we haven't guessed R at 1 yet.

Similarly, E: in guess 3, E at 1 got a minus, so E is not at 1. From guess 1, E is not at 5. Guess 2: E is not at 4. So E must be at 2? Because position 3 is T, so E can be at 2.

And we have R: from guess 1, R not at 2; guess 2, R not at 5; guess 3, R not at 4. So R must be at 1.

Therefore, the word is R E T ? A.

Now, what can the fourth letter be? It must form a valid English word.

Possible words: 
- ""RETA"" is 4 letters. We need 5. So we need a 5-letter word starting with ""RET"" and ending with ""A"".

Common 5-letter words: 
- ""REATA"" is 6 letters.
- ""RETA"" is 4.

But there is ""RETAQ"" which is not a word.

Perhaps ""RETIA"" is a proper noun? Not common.

""RETSA"" is not common.

""RETA"" is the root, so we need a word like ""RETA"" + one letter? But that doesn't work.

Another word: ""REUSE"" is R E U S E -> position 5 is E, not A.

""REHAB"" is R E H A B -> position 5 is B, not A.

""RECAP"" has C and position 3 is not T.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might have the fourth letter as a letter that forms a word.

Let me list possible words: 
- ""REBAR"" is R E B A R -> position 5 is R, not A.
- ""REMAN"" is R E M A N -> position 5 is N, not A, and N is absent.
- ""RENAA"" -> no.

Perhaps we made a mistake in the feedback of guess 3? Let me recheck the feedback for guess 3.

Guess 3: ""extra""
- E at 1: minus -> E is present but not at 1.
- X at 2: x -> X is absent.
- T at 3: check -> T is correct at 3.
- R at 4: minus -> R is present but not at 4.
- A at 5: check -> A is correct at 5.

But we already knew A was at 5 from the previous feedback? Actually, we didn't: we knew A was at 5 from guess 2: A was at 2 and got a minus, and from guess 3: A at 5 is correct. So we knew A was at 5.

But for R: we thought R was at 1? But in guess 3, R was at 4 and got a minus, so R is not at 4. And from guess 1, R is not at 2. Guess 2: R is not at 5. So R must be at 1.

Similarly, E: in guess 3, E at 1 got a minus, so E is not at 1. From guess 1, E is not at 5. Guess 2: E is not at 4. So E must be at 2.

Therefore, the word is R E T ? A.

Now, what can the fourth letter be? It must be a letter that forms a valid English word with ""RET_A"".

Possible letters: 
- ""RETA"" is 4, so we need a 5-letter word. The only common one is ""REATA"" which is 6 letters.

But there is ""RETA"" as a root, so perhaps ""RETA"" with a suffix? But no common 5-letter word.

Perhaps we missed ""RETAG""? Not a word.

Another idea: ""REHAB"" is 5 letters but ends with B, not A.

""REUSE"" ends with E.

""RETCH"" has C and H, but position 5 is H, not A.

""REACT"" has C and not T at 3.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might have the fourth letter as a vowel or consonant.

Let me think of words: 
- ""REATA"" is not 5.
- ""REBRA"" is not 5.

Perhaps ""RETIA"" is 5 letters? It's a word: RETIA is a proper noun? But in word games, it might be accepted? But we need common words.

Common words: 
- ""REATA"" is 6.
- ""RETA"" is 4.

But there is ""RETAQ"" which is not a word.

Perhaps ""REMAN"" is 5 but ends with N.

I think we have a problem. Maybe we made a mistake in the feedback of guess 3? But let's see.

Alternative: perhaps the word is not ""extra"" and we have to try another word.

But we have to make a guess.

We know the word is R E T ? A.

The fourth letter must be a letter that forms a word. Let me list possible letters for the fourth position that make a valid English word.

Possible words: 
- ""RETA"" is 4, so we need a 5-letter word. The only common one is ""REATA"" which is 6 letters. But 6 letters.

Perhaps ""RETA"" with a suffix? But no.

Another word: ""REBAR"" is 5 but ends with R, not A.

""REHAB"" ends with B.

""REUSE"" ends with E.

""RETCH"" ends with H.

""REACT"" has C.

Perhaps ""REACT"" is not possible because of C.

I recall: ""REATA"" is not standard. But ""RETA"" is 4, so we need a 5-letter word.

Perhaps ""RETIA"" is 5 letters? It's a word: RETIA is a medical term? But it's 5 letters: R-E-T-I-A.

Yes, ""RETIA"" is 5 letters. It's a valid word.

But in ""RETIA"", the fourth letter is I.

So the word is R E T I A.

But we have to check if that matches the feedback.

For guess 3: ""extra""
- We had E at 1: got minus -> in ""RETIA"", E is at 2, so that's correct. E is not at 1.
- X at 2: we had X, but in ""RETIA"", position 2 is I, so X is not in the word -> correct.
- T at 3: correct.
- R at 4: in ""extra"", R was at 4 and got minus, but in ""RETIA"", R is at 1, not 4 -> so R at 4 is not in the word? But wait, in ""RETIA"", R is at 1, so when we guessed R at 4, it should have given a minus because R is present but not at 4. That matches.

Also, A at 5: in ""extra"", A at 5 is correct, and in ""RETIA"", A is at 5.

Now, for the fourth letter: in ""RETIA"", the fourth letter is I.

Is I allowed? We haven't tested I. And it's not in the absent list (C, N, L, X).

So ""RETIA"" is a candidate.

But we have to check if it matches the first guess.

First guess: ""crane""
- C: absent -> correct, because ""RETIA"" has no C.
- R: present but not at 2 -> in ""RETIA"", R is at 1, so not at 2 -> correct.
- A: present but not at 3 -> in ""RETIA"", A is at 5, not at 3 -> correct.
- N: absent -> correct.
- E: present but not at 5 -> in ""RETIA"", E is at 2, not at 5 -> correct.

Second guess: ""later""
- L: absent -> correct.
- A: present but not at 2 -> in ""RETIA"", A is at 5, not at 2 -> correct.
- T: at position 3 -> correct.
- E: present but not at 4 -> in ""RETIA"", E is at 2, not at 4 -> correct.
- R: present but not at 5 -> in ""RETIA"", R is at 1, not at 5 -> correct.

Third guess: ""extra""
- E: present but not at 1 -> in ""RETIA"", E is at 2, so not at 1 -> correct.
- X: absent -> correct, because ""RETIA"" has no X.
- T: at 3 -> correct.
- R: present but not at 4 -> in ""RETIA"", R is at 1, so not at 4 -> correct.
- A: at 5 -> correct.

So ""RETIA"" fits all the feedback.

But is ""RETIA"" a valid word? It is a noun meaning a type of tree or a medical term. It might be accepted in word games.

But we have to consider that the word might be ""REATA"" but it's 6 letters. So ""RETIA"" is a possibility.

But let me see if there are other words.

Another word: ""RETAQ"" is not a word.

""RETAG"" is not a word.

""REHAB"" is R E H A B -> but position 5 is B, not A.

""REUSE"" is R E U S E -> position 5 is E, not A.

""REACT"" has C.

""REBAR"" is R E B A R -> position 5 is R, not A.

So ""RETIA"" seems to be the only common word that fits.

But what about ""RETA"" with a suffix? No.

Perhaps ""REMAN"" is 5 but ends with N.

I think ""RETIA"" is a strong candidate.

But we have to make sure that the letter I is not absent? We haven't tested I. So it could be.

But we have only 6 tries, and we are on guess 4. We can guess ""RETIA"".

But let me confirm the feedback for ""RETIA"" with previous guesses:

- Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C absent, R present (at 1, not 2), A present (at 5, not 3), N absent, E present (at 2, not 5) -> matches.
- Guess 2: ""later"" -> L absent, A present (at 5, not 2), T correct at 3, E present (at 2, not 4), R present (at 1, not 5) -> matches.
- Guess 3: ""extra"" -> E present (at 2, not 1), X absent, T correct at 3, R present (at 1, not 4), A correct at 5 -> matches.

So if we guess ""RETIA"", it should be correct.

But we are not 100% sure. There might be other words.

Another word: ""RETA"" is 4, so we need a 5-letter word. What about ""RETAQ""? Not a word.

""RETAG"" is not a word.

""REHAB"" is not ending with A.

Perhaps ""REUSE"" is not ending with A.

I think ""RETIA"" is the only common word that fits.

But let me think of ""REATA"": it is 6 letters, so not.

""REBAR"" is not ending with A.

So I think we should guess ""RETIA"".

But note: in ""RETIA"", the fourth letter is I. We haven't tested I, and it's not in the absent list.

So the next guess is ""RETIA"".

But we are on guess 4, and if ""RETIA"" is the word, we get it. If not, we get feedback.

But since it fits, we can try.

To be safe, we can try a word that tests the fourth position with a new letter, but we only have one letter missing.

We can try ""REHAB"" but it doesn't end with A.

We must have the word be R E T ? A.

So the only common word is ""RETIA"".

Perhaps ""RETA"" with a suffix? But no.

Another word: ""REMAN"" is not ending with A.

I think we should go with ""RETIA"".

But let me double-check the positions:

We deduced:
- Position 1: R
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: T
- Position 4: ? (unknown)
- Position 5: A

And the word must be R E T X A.

What X can we use? 

Possible X:
- I: as in ""RETIA"" -> valid word, medical term.
- J: ""RETAJ"" not a word.
- K: ""RETKA"" not a word.
- M: ""RETM A"" not a word.
- P: ""RETPA"" not a word.
- Q: ""RETAQ"" not a word.
- S: ""RETS A"" -> ""RETSA"" is not common, and S is new.
- U: ""RETAU"" not a word.
- V: ""RETV A"" not a word.
- W: ""RETW A"" not a word.
- Y: ""RETYA"" not a word.
- Z: ""RETZ A"" not a word.

So only I is possible? What about ""REBAR"" -> but that's R E B A R, which is not ending with A.

Another word: ""RECAP"" has C and position 3 is not T.

Perhaps ""REHAB"" is not ending with A.

I think ""RETIA"" is the only common word that fits.

But let me search online or in my mind: 
- ""REATA"" is 6 letters.
- ""RETA"" is 4.
- ""RETAG"" is not a word.
- ""RETAQ"" not a word.

Perhaps ""REMAN"" is 5 but ends with N.

Another word: ""REUSE"" ends with E.

I think we have to go with ""RETIA"".

But we have to confirm: is ""RETIA"" a valid word? According to some dictionaries, ""retia"" is a noun meaning a tree or a part of the body. It is in the Wordle dictionary.

To be safe, we can guess ""RETIA"".

But we have to make a guess.

Perhaps we can try a word that tests the fourth position with a new letter, but we only have one position to determine.

We can try ""REHAB"" but it doesn't end with A.

We must have the word be R E T X A.

So I think ""RETIA"" is the only reasonable guess.

Therefore, we guess ""RETIA"".

But note: we are on guess 4, and if we guess ""RETIA"", it might be correct.

If not, we get feedback on the fourth letter.

But since we have deduced that the word must be R E T ? A, and the only common word is ""RETIA"", we can try that.

So the next guess is ""RETIA"".

But let me write it in the required format.

<guess>retia</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we have deduced the following:

- **Position 1**: R (must be, since R cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 5, and position 3 is T).
- **Position 2**: E (must be, since E cannot be in positions 1, 4, or 5, and position 1 is R and position 3 is T).
- **Position 3**: T (confirmed in both Guess 2 and Guess 3).
- **Position 4**: Unknown, but must be a letter not in {C, N, L, X} and form a valid English word.
- **Position 5**: A (confirmed in Guess 3).

The secret word must be of the form: **R E T ? A**.

After evaluating possible words, **""RETIA""** is the only common English word that fits this pattern. It is a valid 5-letter word (meaning a tree or a medical term), uses the letter I (which is not excluded), and matches all feedback:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: R is present (not position 2), A is present (not position 3), E is present (not position 5), and C/N are absent.
- **Guess 2 (later)**: T is correct (position 3), A is present (not position 2), E is present (not position 4), R is present (not position 5), and L is absent.
- **Guess 3 (extra)**: E is present (not position 1), X is absent, T is correct (position 3), R is present (not position 4), A is correct (position 5).

This guess will confirm if **I** is the missing letter. If correct, the word is solved.",Guess 4: retia -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(✓) T(✓) I(✓) A(✓),SUCCESS
