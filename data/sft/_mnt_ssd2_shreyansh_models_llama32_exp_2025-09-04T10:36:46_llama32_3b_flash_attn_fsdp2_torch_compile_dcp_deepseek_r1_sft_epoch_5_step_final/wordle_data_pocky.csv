We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: - (meaning C is in the secret word but in the wrong position)
 R: x (R is not in the secret word)
 A: x (A is not in the secret word)
 N: x (N is not in the secret word)
 E: x (E is not in the secret word)

 So, from this feedback, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letter 'C', but not in the first position (since in ""crane"", C is the first letter and it's marked as wrong position).
 - The letters R, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word has the letter 'C' in one of the positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (since it's not in position 1).

 Also, we know that the secret word does not contain: R, A, N, E.

 Since we have only one letter that is present ('C'), we need to choose a new word that:
 1. Includes the letter 'C' (but not in the first position, because in the first guess it was in the first position and was wrong).
 2. Avoids the letters R, A, N, E.

 Additionally, we want to maximize information by including other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 Let's think of common letters that are not R, A, N, E. Some common letters are: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

 We also note that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

 We can try to put 'C' in a different position. Since it was in position 1 and was wrong, we can try position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

 However, we don't know which position is correct. So we might want to try a word that has 'C' in a different position and also includes other common letters.

 Let's consider the following: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to try more letters.

 A good strategy is to use a word that has 'C' and four other new letters (that are common and not in the set {R, A, N, E}).

 We can try to use the letter 'S' which is very common. Also, we can try 'T', 'L', 'O', etc.

 Let's try to form a word that has 'C' and avoids R, A, N, E.

 Example words:
 - Could we use ""CLOUT""? But that has O and U, and T and L. However, we don't know if O, U, T, L are in the word.
 - Another idea: ""SCALP"" but that has S, C, A (but A is already excluded) -> so we cannot use A.

 We must avoid A, so let's avoid vowels for now? But we know the word has at least one vowel? Actually, we don't know, but commonly words have vowels.

 We have to use a word without A, E, and also without R, N.

 Let's think of words that have 'C' and without R, A, N, E.

 Possibilities: 
 - ""C"" in position 2: words like ?C??? 
   Example: ""SCULP"" (not common) or ""SCUFF"" (but has two F's and we don't know about F) -> not ideal for information.
 - ""C"" in position 3: ??C?? 
   Example: ""FANCY"" -> but has A (excluded) and N (excluded). So invalid.
 - ""C"" in position 4: ???C?
   Example: ""TOPIC"" -> has O, P, I, C. But we don't know about O, P, I. Also, we can use this.

 However, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Another idea: ""CLOMP"" -> but has O, M, P. But we don't know about O, M, P. Also, we avoid R, A, N, E.

 But note: we have to avoid R, A, N, E. So ""CLOMP"" is acceptable? Let's check: C is in position 1? We want to avoid position 1 for C? Actually, we can put C in any position except 1? But wait, the feedback said C is in the word but not in position 1. So we can try position 1 again? Actually, no, because the feedback said it's in the wrong position, so we know it's not in position 1. So we should avoid putting C in position 1 again.

 But note: the feedback only said that in the first guess, C was in position 1 and it was wrong. It doesn't say that the secret word has C in position 1? Actually, no: the feedback for C was (-) meaning it is in the word but not in position 1. So the secret word has a C, but not at position 1. Therefore, we can try C in positions 2,3,4,5.

 However, we are allowed to put C in position 1 again? But that would be redundant and we know it's not there. So we should avoid position 1 for C.

 So for the next guess, we should put C in one of positions 2,3,4,5.

 Let's try to form a word that has C in position 2: 
   _ C _ _ _

 We need to fill the blanks with letters that are not R, A, N, E.

 Common letters: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

 Example: ""SCULP"" (not common) -> let's think of more common words.

 How about ""SCHOL""? But that has S, C, H, O, L. But we don't know about S, H, O, L. Also, it's a valid word? Yes, meaning a school or a student.

 But note: we have to avoid R, A, N, E. ""SCHOL"" doesn't have any of these.

 Alternatively, ""CLOMP"" has C in position 1? We cannot put C in position 1. So we need a word that has C in position 2 or later.

 Let me try to list words with C in position 2: 
   Position 1: any letter except R, A, N, E, and also not C (because we are putting C in position 2) -> so we can use other consonants or vowels (but vowels: O, I, U are available, but we know the word must have at least one vowel? Actually, we don't know about vowels because we only know about A and E being absent. But the word might have I, O, U, or even Y?).

 Example: ""SCALY"" -> but has A (excluded) and L, Y. But A is excluded -> so invalid.
   ""SCOWL"" -> has O, W, L. But W is less common. And we don't know about O, W, L. Also, no excluded letters.

 But we can use ""SCOWL"". However, we have to consider that we are only on the second guess, so we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Another word: ""SCUBA"" -> has A (excluded) -> invalid.

 How about ""SCION""? -> has I, O, N -> but N is excluded! We cannot use N.

 So we must avoid N.

 Therefore, ""SCION"" is invalid because of N.

 Let me try ""SCUFF"" -> has U, F, F. But F is not very common. And we have two F's? We don't know if F is in the word.

 Alternatively, we can try C in position 3: 
   _ _ C _ _

 Example: ""FICUS"" -> has F, I, C, U, S. But F is not very common. And we have to avoid R, A, N, E -> which we are. But we can do better.

 How about ""MUSIC"" -> has M, U, S, I, C. But C is at the end (position 5). Also, we avoid R, A, N, E.

 But note: we have to avoid using the same letter twice? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But we can try.

 However, we are trying to get information. Using ""MUSIC"" would use M, U, S, I, C. That's five new letters (except C which we know is present). And we are putting C at the end.

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess told us that C is in the word but not in position 1. So if we put C in position 5, that's a new position.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PICKS"" -> but has S, I, C, K, S. But we don't know about P, I, K, S. However, we have two S's? And we are avoiding R, A, N, E.

 But we can also consider words that have C in position 4: 
   _ _ _ C _

 Example: ""TOPIC"" -> T, O, P, I, C. This avoids R, A, N, E. And we haven't tried T, O, P, I.

 But note: we are allowed to use T, O, P, I? Yes, because they are not excluded.

 However, we must avoid using letters that we know are absent: R, A, N, E.

 So ""TOPIC"" is a valid word and uses T, O, P, I, C.

 But we also want to cover more common consonants. Let's see the frequency of letters.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CLOMP"" but that has C in position 1? We cannot do that because we know C is not in position 1. So we must avoid position 1 for C.

 Therefore, we cannot use words that start with C.

 So let's try ""CLOMP"" is invalid because it has C in position 1.

 How about ""MUCKY""? -> but Y is less common.

 Another idea: ""PITCH"" -> has P, I, T, C, H. C is in position 4. This avoids R, A, N, E. And we get to test P, I, T, C, H.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has H or not. But that's the point of guessing.

 Alternatively, ""C"" in position 5: 
   _ _ _ _ C

 Example: ""MANIC"" -> has A (excluded) and N (excluded) -> invalid.
   ""TOPIC"" -> we considered that, but it has C at the end.

 However, ""TOPIC"" has C at the end. We can use that.

 But let me check: the word ""TOPIC"" is valid.

 However, we can also try ""CLOPS"" -> but that has C in position 1? No, we cannot. So we must avoid C in position 1.

 Therefore, we can use words that have C in positions 2,3,4,5.

 Let me try to find a word that has C in position 2 and uses common letters: 
   Position 1: not C, and not R, A, N, E -> so we can use S, T, L, O, I, etc.
   Position 2: C
   Positions 3,4,5: other letters.

 Example: ""SCULP"" (not common) -> let's try ""SCUFF"" but that has two F's and is not very common.

 Another: ""SCHOL"" (as I thought earlier) -> S, C, H, O, L. This is a valid word. And we avoid R, A, N, E.

 But we can also try ""SLOTH"" -> but no C? We must include C because we know it's in the word. So we have to include C.

 So we must have C in the word.

 Therefore, let's choose between:
   Option 1: ""SCHOL"" (C in position 2) -> letters: S, C, H, O, L.
   Option 2: ""TOPIC"" (C in position 5) -> letters: T, O, P, I, C.

 Which one is better? 
   We want to cover more common letters. The frequency of letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... (but we have excluded A, E, R, N). So the most common left are T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U.

   ""TOPIC"" has T, O, P, I, C -> that's T, O, P, I, and C (which we know is present). 
   ""SCHOL"" has S, C, H, O, L -> S, H, O, L.

   The set of letters in ""TOPIC"" includes T, O, P, I, C. 
   The set of letters in ""SCHOL"" includes S, C, H, O, L.

   The frequency of T, O, P, I is higher than S, H, O, L? 
     T is very common, O is common, P is common, I is common. 
     S is also common, H is common, O is common, L is common.

   But note: we already know that the word has C, so we are testing 4 new letters in both.

   However, we have two options. We can choose either.

   But we can also consider ""CLOTH"" -> but C is in position 1? We cannot use that.

   How about ""SHOCK""? -> has S, H, O, C, K. C is in position 4. This avoids R, A, N, E. And we test S, H, O, C, K.

   This seems good because K is also common.

   But we have to choose one.

   Alternatively, ""CHOMP"" -> but C is in position 1? We cannot use that.

   So let's avoid position 1 for C.

   After considering, I think ""SHOCK"" is a good candidate: 
        S H O C K

   But note: we are putting C in position 4. We know C is in the word, but we don't know where. So position 4 is a good candidate?

   However, we don't know. We are trying to cover multiple positions.

   Another candidate: ""BLOCK"" -> but has B, L, O, C, K. But we don't know about B, L, O, K. And we avoid R, A, N, E. But note: we have to avoid using letters that are not in the word? We are allowed to use any letters, even if they are not present, to test.

   But we are only interested in letters that might be present.

   However, we already know that the word has C, so we should focus on other letters.

   Let me compare:

   ""SHOCK"": tests S, H, O, C, K. We know C is present, so we are testing S, H, O, K.
   ""BLOCK"": tests B, L, O, C, K. But note: we are putting C in position 4. Also, we avoid R, A, N, E.

   But we don't know if the word has O or not. Similarly for the others.

   We want to maximize the chance of getting more feedback.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has the letter 'S' because it's very common.

   How about ""SCOLD""? -> has S, C, O, L, but the word is ""SCOLD"". This avoids R, A, N, E. And C is in position 2.

   But we are putting C in position 2. This is a new position.

   Let me check: 
      Position 1: S
      Position 2: C
      Position 3: O
      Position 4: L
      Position 5: D

   This word: ""SCOLD"" -> S, C, O, L, D.

   We haven't tried S, O, L, D. And we know C is present.

   But note: we are not sure if the word has O or not. We are testing.

   Another common word: ""CLOCK"" -> but C is in position 1? We cannot use that.

   So ""SCOLD"" is a valid word.

   But we have to consider that we are using D. Alternatively, we can use ""SCULP"" but that's not common.

   Let me choose ""SCOLD"" because it uses common letters and we avoid the excluded ones.

   However, we have to make sure we don't use any of the excluded letters: R, A, N, E. ""SCOLD"" doesn't have any of these.

   So I will go with ""SCOLD"".

   But wait: what if the secret word has C in position 2? Then we get a match. But if not, we get feedback on S, C, O, L, D.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has C in a position that we haven't tried? Actually, in the first guess, we tried C in position 1. Now we are trying C in position 2. If we get a match in position 2, then we know. If not, we know that C is not in position 2 and we can try other positions.

   But we have 5 positions. We can try to cover multiple positions? Actually, we are doing that.

   However, we have only one known letter (C) and we are testing it in a new position.

   Let me decide: 

   Option 1: ""SCOLD"" -> tests S, C (in pos2), O, L, D.
   Option 2: ""TOPIC"" -> tests T, O, P, I, C (in pos5). 

   Both are good. But ""TOPIC"" has the advantage of having two vowels (O and I) which might be useful.

   But note: we already know that the word doesn't have A and E, so the vowels must be among I, O, U, and possibly Y.

   We haven't tested O, I, U. So testing two vowels at once might be efficient.

   Also, ""TOPIC"" has T and P which are common.

   So I think ""TOPIC"" is a good choice.

   But wait: we are putting C in position 5. We know C is in the word, but we don't know if it's in position 5. So we are testing that.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has C in a position that we haven't tried and also includes more common letters.

   After consideration, I think ""TOPIC"" is a good choice.

   So I will go with ""TOPIC"".

   But let me check: the word ""TOPIC"" is valid.

   Therefore, my second guess is ""TOPIC"".

   We are hoping to get feedback on T, O, P, I, and also on C (we know it will be either correct or present? Actually, we know it's present, so we expect either:
        - If the word has C in position 5: then we get C as correct (✓) and then we know the last letter is C.
        - Otherwise, we get C as (-) meaning it's in another position.

   But we are also testing T, O, P, I.

   So we will get information about these.

   Let me write the guess: TOPIC

   But note: we are not sure if the word has O or I. But that's the point.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has the letter 'S' because it's very common. 

   How about ""COSTS""? -> but C is in position 1? We cannot use that.

   How about ""SCOWL""? -> C in position 2. But we are avoiding R, A, N, E -> and it has W and L. W is less common. But it's acceptable.

   But we can do better: ""SCOWL"" is not as common.

   Another: ""STOIC"" -> has S, T, O, I, C. C is in position 5. This is a valid word. And we avoid R, A, N, E.

   ""STOIC"" is a common word.

   So between ""TOPIC"" and ""STOIC"", which one? 
        ""TOPIC"": T, O, P, I, C
        ""STOIC"": S, T, O, I, C

   Both are good. But ""STOIC"" has S which is very common. And we haven't tested S.

   So I think ""STOIC"" is a good choice.

   But note: we are putting C in position 5 in both. We don't know if that's correct.

   However, we are also testing S, T, O, I.

   Let me choose ""STOIC"".

   So my second guess: STOIC

   But wait: we are putting C in position 5. We know C is in the word, but we don't know if it's in position 5. So we are testing that.

   Alternatively, we can try to put C in a position that we haven't tested? Actually, we only tested position 1. So positions 2,3,4,5 are untested for C.

   We can choose any of 2,3,4,5. 

   I think ""STOIC"" is a good choice.

   So I'll go with ""STOIC"".

   But note: we are also testing S, T, O, I. And we know C is present.

   Therefore, I choose ""STOIC"".

   So the guess is ""stoic"".

   But let me confirm: 
        S: we don't know -> we are testing S.
        T: testing T.
        O: testing O.
        I: testing I.
        C: we know is present, so we are testing if it's in position 5.

   This will give us good information.

   So the word is ""STOIC"".

   We'll guess ""STOIC"".

   If the feedback for C is (-) then we know C is not in position 5, so it must be in 2,3, or 4.

   And we get information about S, T, O, I.

   So let's do that.

   Guess: stoic

   Format: <guess>stoic</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is present but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R, A, N, E are absent from the secret word.

For the next guess, I need to:
1. Include the letter ""C"" in a position other than 1 (since it was incorrect there).
2. Avoid using R, A, N, E.
3. Test new common letters to gather more information.

I chose ""stoic"" because:
- It places ""C"" in position 5 (a new position to test).
- It avoids excluded letters (R, A, N, E).
- It introduces four new common letters: S, T, O, I.
- The word is valid and balances vowel/consonant testing (O and I are vowels).

This guess will help identify the position of ""C"" and test for the presence of S, T, O, I.

 R: x (R is not in the secret word)
 A: x (A is not in the secret word)
 N: x (N is not in the secret word)
 E: x (E is not in the secret word)

 So, from this feedback, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letter 'C', but not in the first position (since in ""crane"", C is the first letter and it's marked as wrong position).
 - The letters R, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word has the letter 'C' in one of the positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (since it's not in position 1).

 Also, we know that the secret word does not contain: R, A, N, E.

 Since we have only one letter that is present ('C'), we need to choose a new word that:
 1. Includes the letter 'C' (but not in the first position, because in the first guess it was in the first position and was wrong).
 2. Avoids the letters R, A, N, E.

 Additionally, we want to maximize information by including other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 Let's think of common letters that are not R, A, N, E. Some common letters are: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

 We also note that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

 We can try to put 'C' in a different position. Since it was in position 1 and was wrong, we can try position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

 However, we don't know which position is correct. So we might want to try a word that has 'C' in a different position and also includes other common letters.

 Let's consider the following: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to try more letters.

 A good strategy is to use a word that has 'C' and four other new letters (that are common and not in the set {R, A, N, E}).

 We can try to use the letter 'S' which is very common. Also, we can try 'T', 'L', 'O', etc.

 Let's try to form a word that has 'C' and avoids R, A, N, E.

 Example words:
 - Could we use ""CLOUT""? But that has O and U, and T and L. However, we don't know if O, U, T, L are in the word.
 - Another idea: ""SCALP"" but that has S, C, A (but A is already excluded) -> so we cannot use A.

 We must avoid A, so let's avoid vowels for now? But we know the word has at least one vowel? Actually, we don't know, but commonly words have vowels.

 We have to use a word without A, E, and also without R, N.

 Let's think of words that have 'C' and without R, A, N, E.

 Possibilities: 
 - ""C"" in position 2: words like ?C??? 
   Example: ""SCULP"" (not common) or ""SCUFF"" (but has two F's and we don't know about F) -> not ideal for information.
 - ""C"" in position 3: ??C?? 
   Example: ""FANCY"" -> but has A (excluded) and N (excluded). So invalid.
 - ""C"" in position 4: ???C?
   Example: ""TOPIC"" -> has O, P, I, C. But we don't know about O, P, I. Also, we can use this.

 However, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Another idea: ""CLOMP"" -> but has O, M, P. But we don't know about O, M, P. Also, we avoid R, A, N, E.

 But note: we have to avoid R, A, N, E. So ""CLOMP"" is acceptable? Let's check: C is in position 1? We want to avoid position 1 for C? Actually, we can put C in any position except 1? But wait, the feedback said C is in the word but not in position 1. So we can try position 1 again? Actually, no, because the feedback said it's in the wrong position, so we know it's not in position 1. So we should avoid putting C in position 1 again.

 But note: the feedback only said that in the first guess, C was in position 1 and it was wrong. It doesn't say that the secret word has C in position 1? Actually, no: the feedback for C was (-) meaning it is in the word but not in position 1. So the secret word has a C, but not at position 1. Therefore, we can try C in positions 2,3,4,5.

 However, we are allowed to put C in position 1 again? But that would be redundant and we know it's not there. So we should avoid position 1 for C.

 So for the next guess, we should put C in one of positions 2,3,4,5.

 Let's try to form a word that has C in position 2: 
   _ C _ _ _

 We need to fill the blanks with letters that are not R, A, N, E.

 Common letters: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

 Example: ""SCULP"" (not common) -> let's think of more common words.

 How about ""SCHOL""? But that has S, C, H, O, L. But we don't know about S, H, O, L. Also, it's a valid word? Yes, meaning a school or a student.

 But note: we have to avoid R, A, N, E. ""SCHOL"" doesn't have any of these.

 Alternatively, ""CLOMP"" has C in position 1? We cannot put C in position 1. So we need a word that has C in position 2 or later.

 Let me try to list words with C in position 2: 
   Position 1: any letter except R, A, N, E, and also not C (because we are putting C in position 2) -> so we can use other consonants or vowels (but vowels: O, I, U are available, but we know the word must have at least one vowel? Actually, we don't know about vowels because we only know about A and E being absent. But the word might have I, O, U, or even Y?).

 Example: ""SCALY"" -> but has A (excluded) and L, Y. But A is excluded -> so invalid.
   ""SCOWL"" -> has O, W, L. But W is less common. And we don't know about O, W, L. Also, no excluded letters.

 But we can use ""SCOWL"". However, we have to consider that we are only on the second guess, so we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Another word: ""SCUBA"" -> has A (excluded) -> invalid.

 How about ""SCION""? -> has I, O, N -> but N is excluded! We cannot use N.

 So we must avoid N.

 Therefore, ""SCION"" is invalid because of N.

 Let me try ""SCUFF"" -> has U, F, F. But F is not very common. And we have two F's? We don't know if F is in the word.

 Alternatively, we can try C in position 3: 
   _ _ C _ _

 Example: ""FICUS"" -> has F, I, C, U, S. But F is not very common. And we have to avoid R, A, N, E -> which we are. But we can do better.

 How about ""MUSIC"" -> has M, U, S, I, C. But C is at the end (position 5). Also, we avoid R, A, N, E.

 But note: we have to avoid using the same letter twice? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But we can try.

 However, we are trying to get information. Using ""MUSIC"" would use M, U, S, I, C. That's five new letters (except C which we know is present). And we are putting C at the end.

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess told us that C is in the word but not in position 1. So if we put C in position 5, that's a new position.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PICKS"" -> but has S, I, C, K, S. But we don't know about P, I, K, S. However, we have two S's? And we are avoiding R, A, N, E.

 But we can also consider words that have C in position 4: 
   _ _ _ C _

 Example: ""TOPIC"" -> T, O, P, I, C. This avoids R, A, N, E. And we haven't tried T, O, P, I.

 But note: we are allowed to use T, O, P, I? Yes, because they are not excluded.

 However, we must avoid using letters that we know are absent: R, A, N, E.

 So ""TOPIC"" is a valid word and uses T, O, P, I, C.

 But we also want to cover more common consonants. Let's see the frequency of letters.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CLOMP"" but that has C in position 1? We cannot do that because we know C is not in position 1. So we must avoid position 1 for C.

 Therefore, we cannot use words that start with C.

 So let's try ""CLOMP"" is invalid because it has C in position 1.

 How about ""MUCKY""? -> but Y is less common.

 Another idea: ""PITCH"" -> has P, I, T, C, H. C is in position 4. This avoids R, A, N, E. And we get to test P, I, T, C, H.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has H or not. But that's the point of guessing.

 Alternatively, ""C"" in position 5: 
   _ _ _ _ C

 Example: ""MANIC"" -> has A (excluded) and N (excluded) -> invalid.
   ""TOPIC"" -> we considered that, but it has C at the end.

 However, ""TOPIC"" has C at the end. We can use that.

 But let me check: the word ""TOPIC"" is valid.

 However, we can also try ""CLOPS"" -> but that has C in position 1? No, we cannot. So we must avoid C in position 1.

 Therefore, we can use words that have C in positions 2,3,4,5.

 Let me try to find a word that has C in position 2 and uses common letters: 
   Position 1: not C, and not R, A, N, E -> so we can use S, T, L, O, I, etc.
   Position 2: C
   Positions 3,4,5: other letters.

 Example: ""SCULP"" (not common) -> let's try ""SCUFF"" but that has two F's and is not very common.

 Another: ""SCHOL"" (as I thought earlier) -> S, C, H, O, L. This is a valid word. And we avoid R, A, N, E.

 But we can also try ""SLOTH"" -> but no C? We must include C because we know it's in the word. So we have to include C.

 So we must have C in the word.

 Therefore, let's choose between:
   Option 1: ""SCHOL"" (C in position 2) -> letters: S, C, H, O, L.
   Option 2: ""TOPIC"" (C in position 5) -> letters: T, O, P, I, C.

 Which one is better? 
   We want to cover more common letters. The frequency of letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... (but we have excluded A, E, R, N). So the most common left are T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U.

   ""TOPIC"" has T, O, P, I, C -> that's T, O, P, I, and C (which we know is present). 
   ""SCHOL"" has S, C, H, O, L -> S, H, O, L.

   The set of letters in ""TOPIC"" includes T, O, P, I, C. 
   The set of letters in ""SCHOL"" includes S, C, H, O, L.

   The frequency of T, O, P, I is higher than S, H, O, L? 
     T is very common, O is common, P is common, I is common. 
     S is also common, H is common, O is common, L is common.

   But note: we already know that the word has C, so we are testing 4 new letters in both.

   However, we have two options. We can choose either.

   But we can also consider ""CLOTH"" -> but C is in position 1? We cannot use that.

   How about ""SHOCK""? -> has S, H, O, C, K. C is in position 4. This avoids R, A, N, E. And we test S, H, O, C, K.

   This seems good because K is also common.

   But we have to choose one.

   Alternatively, ""CHOMP"" -> but C is in position 1? We cannot use that.

   So let's avoid position 1 for C.

   After considering, I think ""SHOCK"" is a good candidate: 
        S H O C K

   But note: we are putting C in position 4. We know C is in the word, but we don't know where. So position 4 is a good candidate?

   However, we don't know. We are trying to cover multiple positions.

   Another candidate: ""BLOCK"" -> but has B, L, O, C, K. But we don't know about B, L, O, K. And we avoid R, A, N, E. But note: we have to avoid using letters that are not in the word? We are allowed to use any letters, even if they are not present, to test.

   But we are only interested in letters that might be present.

   However, we already know that the word has C, so we should focus on other letters.

   Let me compare:

   ""SHOCK"": tests S, H, O, C, K. We know C is present, so we are testing S, H, O, K.
   ""BLOCK"": tests B, L, O, C, K. But note: we are putting C in position 4. Also, we avoid R, A, N, E.

   But we don't know if the word has O or not. Similarly for the others.

   We want to maximize the chance of getting more feedback.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has the letter 'S' because it's very common.

   How about ""SCOLD""? -> has S, C, O, L, but the word is ""SCOLD"". This avoids R, A, N, E. And C is in position 2.

   But we are putting C in position 2. This is a new position.

   Let me check: 
      Position 1: S
      Position 2: C
      Position 3: O
      Position 4: L
      Position 5: D

   This word: ""SCOLD"" -> S, C, O, L, D.

   We haven't tried S, O, L, D. And we know C is present.

   But note: we are not sure if the word has O or not. We are testing.

   Another common word: ""CLOCK"" -> but C is in position 1? We cannot use that.

   So ""SCOLD"" is a valid word.

   But we have to consider that we are using D. Alternatively, we can use ""SCULP"" but that's not common.

   Let me choose ""SCOLD"" because it uses common letters and we avoid the excluded ones.

   However, we have to make sure we don't use any of the excluded letters: R, A, N, E. ""SCOLD"" doesn't have any of these.

   So I will go with ""SCOLD"".

   But wait: what if the secret word has C in position 2? Then we get a match. But if not, we get feedback on S, C, O, L, D.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has C in a position that we haven't tried? Actually, in the first guess, we tried C in position 1. Now we are trying C in position 2. If we get a match in position 2, then we know. If not, we know that C is not in position 2 and we can try other positions.

   But we have 5 positions. We can try to cover multiple positions? Actually, we are doing that.

   However, we have only one known letter (C) and we are testing it in a new position.

   Let me decide: 

   Option 1: ""SCOLD"" -> tests S, C (in pos2), O, L, D.
   Option 2: ""TOPIC"" -> tests T, O, P, I, C (in pos5). 

   Both are good. But ""TOPIC"" has the advantage of having two vowels (O and I) which might be useful.

   But note: we already know that the word doesn't have A and E, so the vowels must be among I, O, U, and possibly Y.

   We haven't tested O, I, U. So testing two vowels at once might be efficient.

   Also, ""TOPIC"" has T and P which are common.

   So I think ""TOPIC"" is a good choice.

   But wait: we are putting C in position 5. We know C is in the word, but we don't know if it's in position 5. So we are testing that.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has C in a position that we haven't tried and also includes more common letters.

   After consideration, I think ""TOPIC"" is a good choice.

   So I will go with ""TOPIC"".

   But let me check: the word ""TOPIC"" is valid.

   Therefore, my second guess is ""TOPIC"".

   We are hoping to get feedback on T, O, P, I, and also on C (we know it will be either correct or present? Actually, we know it's present, so we expect either:
        - If the word has C in position 5: then we get C as correct (✓) and then we know the last letter is C.
        - Otherwise, we get C as (-) meaning it's in another position.

   But we are also testing T, O, P, I.

   So we will get information about these.

   Let me write the guess: TOPIC

   But note: we are not sure if the word has O or I. But that's the point.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has the letter 'S' because it's very common. 

   How about ""COSTS""? -> but C is in position 1? We cannot use that.

   How about ""SCOWL""? -> C in position 2. But we are avoiding R, A, N, E -> and it has W and L. W is less common. But it's acceptable.

   But we can do better: ""SCOWL"" is not as common.

   Another: ""STOIC"" -> has S, T, O, I, C. C is in position 5. This is a valid word. And we avoid R, A, N, E.

   ""STOIC"" is a common word.

   So between ""TOPIC"" and ""STOIC"", which one? 
        ""TOPIC"": T, O, P, I, C
        ""STOIC"": S, T, O, I, C

   Both are good. But ""STOIC"" has S which is very common. And we haven't tested S.

   So I think ""STOIC"" is a good choice.

   But note: we are putting C in position 5 in both. We don't know if that's correct.

   However, we are also testing S, T, O, I.

   Let me choose ""STOIC"".

   So my second guess: STOIC

   But wait: we are putting C in position 5. We know C is in the word, but we don't know if it's in position 5. So we are testing that.

   Alternatively, we can try to put C in a position that we haven't tested? Actually, we only tested position 1. So positions 2,3,4,5 are untested for C.

   We can choose any of 2,3,4,5. 

   I think ""STOIC"" is a good choice.

   So I'll go with ""STOIC"".

   But note: we are also testing S, T, O, I. And we know C is present.

   Therefore, I choose ""STOIC"".

   So the guess is ""stoic"".

   But let me confirm: 
        S: we don't know -> we are testing S.
        T: testing T.
        O: testing O.
        I: testing I.
        C: we know is present, so we are testing if it's in position 5.

   This will give us good information.

   So the word is ""STOIC"".

   We'll guess ""STOIC"".

   If the feedback for C is (-) then we know C is not in position 5, so it must be in 2,3, or 4.

   And we get information about S, T, O, I.

   So let's do that.

   Guess: stoic

   Format: <guess>stoic</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is present but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R, A, N, E are absent from the secret word.

For the next guess, I need to:
1. Include the letter ""C"" in a position other than 1 (since it was incorrect there).
2. Avoid using R, A, N, E.
3. Test new common letters to gather more information.

I chose ""stoic"" because:
- It places ""C"" in position 5 (a new position to test).
- It avoids excluded letters (R, A, N, E).
- It introduces four new common letters: S, T, O, I.
- The word is valid and balances vowel/consonant testing (O and I are vowels).

This guess will help identify the position of ""C"" and test for the presence of S, T, O, I.",Guess 2: stoic -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(-) I(x) C(-),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: - (meaning C is in the secret word but in the wrong position)
 R: x (R is not in the secret word)
 A: x (A is not in the secret word)
 N: x (N is not in the secret word)
 E: x (E is not in the secret word)

 So, from this feedback, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letter 'C', but not in the first position (since in ""crane"", C is the first letter and it's marked as wrong position).
 - The letters R, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word has the letter 'C' in one of the positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (since it's not in position 1).

 Also, we know that the secret word does not contain: R, A, N, E.

 Since we have only one letter that is present ('C'), we need to choose a new word that:
 1. Includes the letter 'C' (but not in the first position, because in the first guess it was in the first position and was wrong).
 2. Avoids the letters R, A, N, E.

 Additionally, we want to maximize information by including other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 Let's think of common letters that are not R, A, N, E. Some common letters are: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

 We also note that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

 We can try to put 'C' in a different position. Since it was in position 1 and was wrong, we can try position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

 However, we don't know which position is correct. So we might want to try a word that has 'C' in a different position and also includes other common letters.

 Let's consider the following: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to try more letters.

 A good strategy is to use a word that has 'C' and four other new letters (that are common and not in the set {R, A, N, E}).

 We can try to use the letter 'S' which is very common. Also, we can try 'T', 'L', 'O', etc.

 Let's try to form a word that has 'C' and avoids R, A, N, E.

 Example words:
 - Could we use ""CLOUT""? But that has O and U, and T and L. However, we don't know if O, U, T, L are in the word.
 - Another idea: ""SCALP"" but that has S, C, A (but A is already excluded) -> so we cannot use A.

 We must avoid A, so let's avoid vowels for now? But we know the word has at least one vowel? Actually, we don't know, but commonly words have vowels.

 We have to use a word without A, E, and also without R, N.

 Let's think of words that have 'C' and without R, A, N, E.

 Possibilities: 
 - ""C"" in position 2: words like ?C??? 
   Example: ""SCULP"" (not common) or ""SCUFF"" (but has two F's and we don't know about F) -> not ideal for information.
 - ""C"" in position 3: ??C?? 
   Example: ""FANCY"" -> but has A (excluded) and N (excluded). So invalid.
 - ""C"" in position 4: ???C?
   Example: ""TOPIC"" -> has O, P, I, C. But we don't know about O, P, I. Also, we can use this.

 However, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Another idea: ""CLOMP"" -> but has O, M, P. But we don't know about O, M, P. Also, we avoid R, A, N, E.

 But note: we have to avoid R, A, N, E. So ""CLOMP"" is acceptable? Let's check: C is in position 1? We want to avoid position 1 for C? Actually, we can put C in any position except 1? But wait, the feedback said C is in the word but not in position 1. So we can try position 1 again? Actually, no, because the feedback said it's in the wrong position, so we know it's not in position 1. So we should avoid putting C in position 1 again.

 But note: the feedback only said that in the first guess, C was in position 1 and it was wrong. It doesn't say that the secret word has C in position 1? Actually, no: the feedback for C was (-) meaning it is in the word but not in position 1. So the secret word has a C, but not at position 1. Therefore, we can try C in positions 2,3,4,5.

 However, we are allowed to put C in position 1 again? But that would be redundant and we know it's not there. So we should avoid position 1 for C.

 So for the next guess, we should put C in one of positions 2,3,4,5.

 Let's try to form a word that has C in position 2: 
   _ C _ _ _

 We need to fill the blanks with letters that are not R, A, N, E.

 Common letters: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

 Example: ""SCULP"" (not common) -> let's think of more common words.

 How about ""SCHOL""? But that has S, C, H, O, L. But we don't know about S, H, O, L. Also, it's a valid word? Yes, meaning a school or a student.

 But note: we have to avoid R, A, N, E. ""SCHOL"" doesn't have any of these.

 Alternatively, ""CLOMP"" has C in position 1? We cannot put C in position 1. So we need a word that has C in position 2 or later.

 Let me try to list words with C in position 2: 
   Position 1: any letter except R, A, N, E, and also not C (because we are putting C in position 2) -> so we can use other consonants or vowels (but vowels: O, I, U are available, but we know the word must have at least one vowel? Actually, we don't know about vowels because we only know about A and E being absent. But the word might have I, O, U, or even Y?).

 Example: ""SCALY"" -> but has A (excluded) and L, Y. But A is excluded -> so invalid.
   ""SCOWL"" -> has O, W, L. But W is less common. And we don't know about O, W, L. Also, no excluded letters.

 But we can use ""SCOWL"". However, we have to consider that we are only on the second guess, so we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Another word: ""SCUBA"" -> has A (excluded) -> invalid.

 How about ""SCION""? -> has I, O, N -> but N is excluded! We cannot use N.

 So we must avoid N.

 Therefore, ""SCION"" is invalid because of N.

 Let me try ""SCUFF"" -> has U, F, F. But F is not very common. And we have two F's? We don't know if F is in the word.

 Alternatively, we can try C in position 3: 
   _ _ C _ _

 Example: ""FICUS"" -> has F, I, C, U, S. But F is not very common. And we have to avoid R, A, N, E -> which we are. But we can do better.

 How about ""MUSIC"" -> has M, U, S, I, C. But C is at the end (position 5). Also, we avoid R, A, N, E.

 But note: we have to avoid using the same letter twice? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But we can try.

 However, we are trying to get information. Using ""MUSIC"" would use M, U, S, I, C. That's five new letters (except C which we know is present). And we are putting C at the end.

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess told us that C is in the word but not in position 1. So if we put C in position 5, that's a new position.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PICKS"" -> but has S, I, C, K, S. But we don't know about P, I, K, S. However, we have two S's? And we are avoiding R, A, N, E.

 But we can also consider words that have C in position 4: 
   _ _ _ C _

 Example: ""TOPIC"" -> T, O, P, I, C. This avoids R, A, N, E. And we haven't tried T, O, P, I.

 But note: we are allowed to use T, O, P, I? Yes, because they are not excluded.

 However, we must avoid using letters that we know are absent: R, A, N, E.

 So ""TOPIC"" is a valid word and uses T, O, P, I, C.

 But we also want to cover more common consonants. Let's see the frequency of letters.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CLOMP"" but that has C in position 1? We cannot do that because we know C is not in position 1. So we must avoid position 1 for C.

 Therefore, we cannot use words that start with C.

 So let's try ""CLOMP"" is invalid because it has C in position 1.

 How about ""MUCKY""? -> but Y is less common.

 Another idea: ""PITCH"" -> has P, I, T, C, H. C is in position 4. This avoids R, A, N, E. And we get to test P, I, T, C, H.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has H or not. But that's the point of guessing.

 Alternatively, ""C"" in position 5: 
   _ _ _ _ C

 Example: ""MANIC"" -> has A (excluded) and N (excluded) -> invalid.
   ""TOPIC"" -> we considered that, but it has C at the end.

 However, ""TOPIC"" has C at the end. We can use that.

 But let me check: the word ""TOPIC"" is valid.

 However, we can also try ""CLOPS"" -> but that has C in position 1? No, we cannot. So we must avoid C in position 1.

 Therefore, we can use words that have C in positions 2,3,4,5.

 Let me try to find a word that has C in position 2 and uses common letters: 
   Position 1: not C, and not R, A, N, E -> so we can use S, T, L, O, I, etc.
   Position 2: C
   Positions 3,4,5: other letters.

 Example: ""SCULP"" (not common) -> let's try ""SCUFF"" but that has two F's and is not very common.

 Another: ""SCHOL"" (as I thought earlier) -> S, C, H, O, L. This is a valid word. And we avoid R, A, N, E.

 But we can also try ""SLOTH"" -> but no C? We must include C because we know it's in the word. So we have to include C.

 So we must have C in the word.

 Therefore, let's choose between:
   Option 1: ""SCHOL"" (C in position 2) -> letters: S, C, H, O, L.
   Option 2: ""TOPIC"" (C in position 5) -> letters: T, O, P, I, C.

 Which one is better? 
   We want to cover more common letters. The frequency of letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... (but we have excluded A, E, R, N). So the most common left are T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U.

   ""TOPIC"" has T, O, P, I, C -> that's T, O, P, I, and C (which we know is present). 
   ""SCHOL"" has S, C, H, O, L -> S, H, O, L.

   The set of letters in ""TOPIC"" includes T, O, P, I, C. 
   The set of letters in ""SCHOL"" includes S, C, H, O, L.

   The frequency of T, O, P, I is higher than S, H, O, L? 
     T is very common, O is common, P is common, I is common. 
     S is also common, H is common, O is common, L is common.

   But note: we already know that the word has C, so we are testing 4 new letters in both.

   However, we have two options. We can choose either.

   But we can also consider ""CLOTH"" -> but C is in position 1? We cannot use that.

   How about ""SHOCK""? -> has S, H, O, C, K. C is in position 4. This avoids R, A, N, E. And we test S, H, O, C, K.

   This seems good because K is also common.

   But we have to choose one.

   Alternatively, ""CHOMP"" -> but C is in position 1? We cannot use that.

   So let's avoid position 1 for C.

   After considering, I think ""SHOCK"" is a good candidate: 
        S H O C K

   But note: we are putting C in position 4. We know C is in the word, but we don't know where. So position 4 is a good candidate?

   However, we don't know. We are trying to cover multiple positions.

   Another candidate: ""BLOCK"" -> but has B, L, O, C, K. But we don't know about B, L, O, K. And we avoid R, A, N, E. But note: we have to avoid using letters that are not in the word? We are allowed to use any letters, even if they are not present, to test.

   But we are only interested in letters that might be present.

   However, we already know that the word has C, so we should focus on other letters.

   Let me compare:

   ""SHOCK"": tests S, H, O, C, K. We know C is present, so we are testing S, H, O, K.
   ""BLOCK"": tests B, L, O, C, K. But note: we are putting C in position 4. Also, we avoid R, A, N, E.

   But we don't know if the word has O or not. Similarly for the others.

   We want to maximize the chance of getting more feedback.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has the letter 'S' because it's very common.

   How about ""SCOLD""? -> has S, C, O, L, but the word is ""SCOLD"". This avoids R, A, N, E. And C is in position 2.

   But we are putting C in position 2. This is a new position.

   Let me check: 
      Position 1: S
      Position 2: C
      Position 3: O
      Position 4: L
      Position 5: D

   This word: ""SCOLD"" -> S, C, O, L, D.

   We haven't tried S, O, L, D. And we know C is present.

   But note: we are not sure if the word has O or not. We are testing.

   Another common word: ""CLOCK"" -> but C is in position 1? We cannot use that.

   So ""SCOLD"" is a valid word.

   But we have to consider that we are using D. Alternatively, we can use ""SCULP"" but that's not common.

   Let me choose ""SCOLD"" because it uses common letters and we avoid the excluded ones.

   However, we have to make sure we don't use any of the excluded letters: R, A, N, E. ""SCOLD"" doesn't have any of these.

   So I will go with ""SCOLD"".

   But wait: what if the secret word has C in position 2? Then we get a match. But if not, we get feedback on S, C, O, L, D.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has C in a position that we haven't tried? Actually, in the first guess, we tried C in position 1. Now we are trying C in position 2. If we get a match in position 2, then we know. If not, we know that C is not in position 2 and we can try other positions.

   But we have 5 positions. We can try to cover multiple positions? Actually, we are doing that.

   However, we have only one known letter (C) and we are testing it in a new position.

   Let me decide: 

   Option 1: ""SCOLD"" -> tests S, C (in pos2), O, L, D.
   Option 2: ""TOPIC"" -> tests T, O, P, I, C (in pos5). 

   Both are good. But ""TOPIC"" has the advantage of having two vowels (O and I) which might be useful.

   But note: we already know that the word doesn't have A and E, so the vowels must be among I, O, U, and possibly Y.

   We haven't tested O, I, U. So testing two vowels at once might be efficient.

   Also, ""TOPIC"" has T and P which are common.

   So I think ""TOPIC"" is a good choice.

   But wait: we are putting C in position 5. We know C is in the word, but we don't know if it's in position 5. So we are testing that.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has C in a position that we haven't tried and also includes more common letters.

   After consideration, I think ""TOPIC"" is a good choice.

   So I will go with ""TOPIC"".

   But let me check: the word ""TOPIC"" is valid.

   Therefore, my second guess is ""TOPIC"".

   We are hoping to get feedback on T, O, P, I, and also on C (we know it will be either correct or present? Actually, we know it's present, so we expect either:
        - If the word has C in position 5: then we get C as correct (✓) and then we know the last letter is C.
        - Otherwise, we get C as (-) meaning it's in another position.

   But we are also testing T, O, P, I.

   So we will get information about these.

   Let me write the guess: TOPIC

   But note: we are not sure if the word has O or I. But that's the point.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has the letter 'S' because it's very common. 

   How about ""COSTS""? -> but C is in position 1? We cannot use that.

   How about ""SCOWL""? -> C in position 2. But we are avoiding R, A, N, E -> and it has W and L. W is less common. But it's acceptable.

   But we can do better: ""SCOWL"" is not as common.

   Another: ""STOIC"" -> has S, T, O, I, C. C is in position 5. This is a valid word. And we avoid R, A, N, E.

   ""STOIC"" is a common word.

   So between ""TOPIC"" and ""STOIC"", which one? 
        ""TOPIC"": T, O, P, I, C
        ""STOIC"": S, T, O, I, C

   Both are good. But ""STOIC"" has S which is very common. And we haven't tested S.

   So I think ""STOIC"" is a good choice.

   But note: we are putting C in position 5 in both. We don't know if that's correct.

   However, we are also testing S, T, O, I.

   Let me choose ""STOIC"".

   So my second guess: STOIC

   But wait: we are putting C in position 5. We know C is in the word, but we don't know if it's in position 5. So we are testing that.

   Alternatively, we can try to put C in a position that we haven't tested? Actually, we only tested position 1. So positions 2,3,4,5 are untested for C.

   We can choose any of 2,3,4,5. 

   I think ""STOIC"" is a good choice.

   So I'll go with ""STOIC"".

   But note: we are also testing S, T, O, I. And we know C is present.

   Therefore, I choose ""STOIC"".

   So the guess is ""stoic"".

   But let me confirm: 
        S: we don't know -> we are testing S.
        T: testing T.
        O: testing O.
        I: testing I.
        C: we know is present, so we are testing if it's in position 5.

   This will give us good information.

   So the word is ""STOIC"".

   We'll guess ""STOIC"".

   If the feedback for C is (-) then we know C is not in position 5, so it must be in 2,3, or 4.

   And we get information about S, T, O, I.

   So let's do that.

   Guess: stoic

   Format: <guess>stoic</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is present but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R, A, N, E are absent from the secret word.

For the next guess, I need to:
1. Include the letter ""C"" in a position other than 1 (since it was incorrect there).
2. Avoid using R, A, N, E.
3. Test new common letters to gather more information.

I chose ""stoic"" because:
- It places ""C"" in position 5 (a new position to test).
- It avoids excluded letters (R, A, N, E).
- It introduces four new common letters: S, T, O, I.
- The word is valid and balances vowel/consonant testing (O and I are vowels).

This guess will help identify the position of ""C"" and test for the presence of S, T, O, I.

Actually, we don\'t know, but commonly words have vowels.\n\n We have to use a word without A, E, and also without R, N.\n\n Let\'s think of words that have \'C\' and without R, A, N, E.\n\n Possibilities: \n - ""C"" in position 2: words like ?C??? \n   Example: ""SCULP"" (not common) or ""SCUFF"" (but has two F\'s and we don\'t know about F) -> not ideal for information.\n - ""C"" in position 3: ??C?? \n   Example: ""FANCY"" -> but has A (excluded) and N (excluded).

Actually, we can put C in any position except 1? But wait, the feedback said C is in the word but not in position 1. So we can try position 1 again? Actually, no, because the feedback said it\'s in the wrong position, so we know it\'s not in position 1. So we should avoid putting C in position 1 again.\n\n But note: the feedback only said that in the first guess, C was in position 1 and it was wrong. It doesn\'t say that the secret word has C in position 1? Actually, no: the feedback for C was (-) meaning it is in the word but not in position 1. So the secret word has a C, but not at position 1. Therefore, we can try C in positions 2,3,4,5.\n\n However, we are allowed to put C in position 1 again? But that would be redundant and we know it\'s not there. So we should avoid position 1 for C.\n\n So for the next guess, we should put C in one of positions 2,3,4,5.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that has C in position 2: \n   _ C _ _ _\n\n We need to fill the blanks with letters that are not R, A, N, E.\n\n Common letters: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.\n\n Example: ""SCULP"" (not common) -> let\'s think of more common words.\n\n How about ""SCHOL""? But that has S, C, H, O, L. But we don\'t know about S, H, O, L. Also, it\'s a valid word? Yes, meaning a school or a student.\n\n But note: we have to avoid R, A, N, E. ""SCHOL"" doesn\'t have any of these.\n\n Alternatively, ""CLOMP"" has C in position 1? We cannot put C in position 1. So we need a word that has C in position 2 or later.\n\n Let me try to list words with C in position 2: \n   Position 1: any letter except R, A, N, E, and also not C (because we are putting C in position 2) -> so we can use other consonants or vowels (but vowels: O, I, U are available, but we know the word must have at least one vowel? Actually, we don\'t know about vowels because we only know about A and E being absent. But the word might have I, O, U, or even Y?).\n\n Example: ""SCALY"" -> but has A (excluded) and L, Y. But A is excluded -> so invalid.\n   ""SCOWL"" -> has O, W, L. But W is less common. And we don\'t know about O, W, L. Also, no excluded letters.\n\n But we can use ""SCOWL"".

Also, we avoid R, A, N, E.\n\n But note: we have to avoid using the same letter twice? We don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. But we can try.\n\n However, we are trying to get information.

And we are putting C at the end.\n\n But wait: the feedback for the first guess told us that C is in the word but not in position 1. So if we put C in position 5, that\'s a new position.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""PICKS"" -> but has S, I, C, K, S. But we don\'t know about P, I, K, S. However, we have two S\'s? And we are avoiding R, A, N, E.\n\n But we can also consider words that have C in position 4: \n   _ _ _ C _\n\n Example: ""TOPIC"" -> T, O, P, I, C. This avoids R, A, N, E.

Yes, because they are not excluded.\n\n However, we must avoid using letters that we know are absent: R, A, N, E.\n\n So ""TOPIC"" is a valid word and uses T, O, P, I, C.\n\n But we also want to cover more common consonants. Let\'s see the frequency of letters.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""CLOMP"" but that has C in position 1? We cannot do that because we know C is not in position 1. So we must avoid position 1 for C.\n\n Therefore, we cannot use words that start with C.\n\n So let\'s try ""CLOMP"" is invalid because it has C in position 1.\n\n How about ""MUCKY""? -> but Y is less common.\n\n Another idea: ""PITCH"" -> has P, I, T, C, H. C is in position 4. This avoids R, A, N, E. And we get to test P, I, T, C, H.\n\n But note: we are not sure if the word has H or not. But that\'s the point of guessing.\n\n Alternatively, ""C"" in position 5: \n   _ _ _ _ C\n\n Example: ""MANIC"" -> has A (excluded) and N (excluded) -> invalid.\n   ""TOPIC"" -> we considered that, but it has C at the end.\n\n However, ""TOPIC"" has C at the end. We can use that.\n\n But let me check: the word ""TOPIC"" is valid.\n\n However, we can also try ""CLOPS"" -> but that has C in position 1? No, we cannot. So we must avoid C in position 1.\n\n Therefore, we can use words that have C in positions 2,3,4,5.\n\n Let me try to find a word that has C in position 2 and uses common letters: \n   Position 1: not C, and not R, A, N, E -> so we can use S, T, L, O, I, etc.\n   Position 2: C\n   Positions 3,4,5: other letters.\n\n Example: ""SCULP"" (not common) -> let\'s try ""SCUFF"" but that has two F\'s and is not very common.\n\n Another: ""SCHOL"" (as I thought earlier) -> S, C, H, O, L. This is a valid word. And we avoid R, A, N, E.\n\n But we can also try ""SLOTH"" -> but no C? We must include C because we know it\'s in the word. So we have to include C.\n\n So we must have C in the word.\n\n Therefore, let\'s choose between:\n   Option 1: ""SCHOL"" (C in position 2) -> letters: S, C, H, O, L.\n   Option 2: ""TOPIC"" (C in position 5) -> letters: T, O, P, I, C.\n\n Which one is better? \n   We want to cover more common letters. The frequency of letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... (but we have excluded A, E, R, N). So the most common left are T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U.\n\n   ""TOPIC"" has T, O, P, I, C -> that\'s T, O, P, I, and C (which we know is present). \n   ""SCHOL"" has S, C, H, O, L -> S, H, O, L.\n\n   The set of letters in ""TOPIC"" includes T, O, P, I, C. \n   The set of letters in ""SCHOL"" includes S, C, H, O, L.\n\n   The frequency of T, O, P, I is higher than S, H, O, L? \n     T is very common, O is common, P is common, I is common. \n     S is also common, H is common, O is common, L is common.\n\n   But note: we already know that the word has C, so we are testing 4 new letters in both.\n\n   However, we have two options. We can choose either.\n\n   But we can also consider ""CLOTH"" -> but C is in position 1? We cannot use that.\n\n   How about ""SHOCK""? -> has S, H, O, C, K. C is in position 4. This avoids R, A, N, E. And we test S, H, O, C, K.\n\n   This seems good because K is also common.\n\n   But we have to choose one.\n\n   Alternatively, ""CHOMP"" -> but C is in position 1? We cannot use that.\n\n   So let\'s avoid position 1 for C.\n\n   After considering, I think ""SHOCK"" is a good candidate: \n        S H O C K\n\n   But note: we are putting C in position 4. We know C is in the word, but we don\'t know where. So position 4 is a good candidate?\n\n   However, we don\'t know. We are trying to cover multiple positions.\n\n   Another candidate: ""BLOCK"" -> but has B, L, O, C, K. But we don\'t know about B, L, O, K. And we avoid R, A, N, E. But note: we have to avoid using letters that are not in the word? We are allowed to use any letters, even if they are not present, to test.\n\n   But we are only interested in letters that might be present.\n\n   However, we already know that the word has C, so we should focus on other letters.\n\n   Let me compare:\n\n   ""SHOCK"": tests S, H, O, C, K. We know C is present, so we are testing S, H, O, K.\n   ""BLOCK"": tests B, L, O, C, K. But note: we are putting C in position 4. Also, we avoid R, A, N, E.\n\n   But we don\'t know if the word has O or not. Similarly for the others.\n\n   We want to maximize the chance of getting more feedback.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try a word that has the letter \'S\' because it\'s very common.\n\n   How about ""SCOLD""? -> has S, C, O, L, but the word is ""SCOLD"". This avoids R, A, N, E. And C is in position 2.\n\n   But we are putting C in position 2. This is a new position.\n\n   Let me check: \n      Position 1: S\n      Position 2: C\n      Position 3: O\n      Position 4: L\n      Position 5: D\n\n   This word: ""SCOLD"" -> S, C, O, L, D.\n\n   We haven\'t tried S, O, L, D. And we know C is present.\n\n   But note: we are not sure if the word has O or not. We are testing.\n\n   Another common word: ""CLOCK"" -> but C is in position 1? We cannot use that.\n\n   So ""SCOLD"" is a valid word.\n\n   But we have to consider that we are using D. Alternatively, we can use ""SCULP"" but that\'s not common.\n\n   Let me choose ""SCOLD"" because it uses common letters and we avoid the excluded ones.\n\n   However, we have to make sure we don\'t use any of the excluded letters: R, A, N, E. ""SCOLD"" doesn\'t have any of these.\n\n   So I will go with ""SCOLD"".\n\n   But wait: what if the secret word has C in position 2? Then we get a match. But if not, we get feedback on S, C, O, L, D.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try a word that has C in a position that we haven\'t tried? Actually, in the first guess, we tried C in position 1. Now we are trying C in position 2. If we get a match in position 2, then we know. If not, we know that C is not in position 2 and we can try other positions.\n\n   But we have 5 positions. We can try to cover multiple positions? Actually, we are doing that.\n\n   However, we have only one known letter (C) and we are testing it in a new position.\n\n   Let me decide: \n\n   Option 1: ""SCOLD"" -> tests S, C (in pos2), O, L, D.\n   Option 2: ""TOPIC"" -> tests T, O, P, I, C (in pos5). \n\n   Both are good. But ""TOPIC"" has the advantage of having two vowels (O and I) which might be useful.\n\n   But note: we already know that the word doesn\'t have A and E, so the vowels must be among I, O, U, and possibly Y.\n\n   We haven\'t tested O, I, U. So testing two vowels at once might be efficient.\n\n   Also, ""TOPIC"" has T and P which are common.\n\n   So I think ""TOPIC"" is a good choice.\n\n   But wait: we are putting C in position 5. We know C is in the word, but we don\'t know if it\'s in position 5. So we are testing that.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try a word that has C in a position that we haven\'t tried and also includes more common letters.\n\n   After consideration, I think ""TOPIC"" is a good choice.\n\n   So I will go with ""TOPIC"".\n\n   But let me check: the word ""TOPIC"" is valid.\n\n   Therefore, my second guess is ""TOPIC"".\n\n   We are hoping to get feedback on T, O, P, I, and also on C (we know it will be either correct or present? Actually, we know it\'s present, so we expect either:\n        - If the word has C in position 5: then we get C as correct (✓) and then we know the last letter is C.\n        - Otherwise, we get C as (-) meaning it\'s in another position.\n\n   But we are also testing T, O, P, I.\n\n   So we will get information about these.\n\n   Let me write the guess: TOPIC\n\n   But note: we are not sure if the word has O or I. But that\'s the point.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try a word that has the letter \'S\' because it\'s very common. \n\n   How about ""COSTS""? -> but C is in position 1? We cannot use that.\n\n   How about ""SCOWL""? -> C in position 2. But we are avoiding R, A, N, E -> and it has W and L. W is less common. But it\'s acceptable.\n\n   But we can do better: ""SCOWL"" is not as common.\n\n   Another: ""STOIC"" -> has S, T, O, I, C. C is in position 5. This is a valid word. And we avoid R, A, N, E.\n\n   ""STOIC"" is a common word.\n\n   So between ""TOPIC"" and ""STOIC"", which one? \n        ""TOPIC"": T, O, P, I, C\n        ""STOIC"": S, T, O, I, C\n\n   Both are good. But ""STOIC"" has S which is very common. And we haven\'t tested S.\n\n   So I think ""STOIC"" is a good choice.\n\n   But note: we are putting C in position 5 in both. We don\'t know if that\'s correct.\n\n   However, we are also testing S, T, O, I.\n\n   Let me choose ""STOIC"".\n\n   So my second guess: STOIC\n\n   But wait: we are putting C in position 5. We know C is in the word, but we don\'t know if it\'s in position 5. So we are testing that.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try to put C in a position that we haven\'t tested? Actually, we only tested position 1. So positions 2,3,4,5 are untested for C.\n\n   We can choose any of 2,3,4,5. \n\n   I think ""STOIC"" is a good choice.\n\n   So I\'ll go with ""STOIC"".\n\n   But note: we are also testing S, T, O, I. And we know C is present.\n\n   Therefore, I choose ""STOIC"".\n\n   So the guess is ""stoic"".\n\n   But let me confirm: \n        S: we don\'t know -> we are testing S.\n        T: testing T.\n        O: testing O.\n        I: testing I.\n        C: we know is present, so we are testing if it\'s in position 5.\n\n   This will give us good information.\n\n   So the word is ""STOIC"".\n\n   We\'ll guess ""STOIC"".\n\n   If the feedback for C is (-) then we know C is not in position 5, so it must be in 2,3, or 4.\n\n   And we get information about S, T, O, I.\n\n   So let\'s do that.\n\n   Guess: stoic\n\n   Format: <guess>stoic</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C is present but in the wrong position (not position 1).\n- R, A, N, E are absent from the secret word.\n\nFor the next guess, I need to:\n1. Include the letter ""C"" in a position other than 1 (since it was incorrect there).\n2. Avoid using R, A, N, E.\n3. Test new common letters to gather more information.\n\nI chose ""stoic"" because:\n- It places ""C"" in position 5 (a new position to test).\n- It avoids excluded letters (R, A, N, E).\n- It introduces four new common letters: S, T, O, I.\n- The word is valid and balances vowel/consonant testing (O and I are vowels).\n\nThis guess will help identify the position of ""C"" and test for the presence of S, T, O, I.\n\n<guess>stoic</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: stoic -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(-) I(x) C(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(-), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""stoic"" -> S(x), T(x), O(-), I(x), C(-)
Meaning:
- S is not in the word.
- T is not in the word.
- O is in the word but not in position 3 (since in ""stoic"", O is the third letter).
- I is not in the word.
- C is in the word but not in position 5 (since in ""stoic"", C is the fifth letter).

So, combining the information:

Letters known to be absent: R, A, N, E, S, T, I
Letters known to be present: C and O

For C:
- It is not in position 1 (from guess 1) and not in position 5 (from guess 2). So it must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

For O:
- It is in the word but not in position 3 (from guess 2). So it could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We also know that the secret word has exactly 5 letters, and we have two known letters: C and O. But there are three more letters we don't know.

We need to avoid the absent letters: R, A, N, E, S, T, I.

Available letters: We can use any letter except the absent ones. Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We have 4 more guesses (since we used 2, and we have 6 total).

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Contains C and O (both must be present, but we don't know their positions yet).
- Does not contain R, A, N, E, S, T, I.
- We can use other letters from the available set.

We also want to test new common letters to get more information.

Let's think about the positions for C and O:

- C must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- O must not be in position 3 (from the feedback of ""stoic""), so O can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

But note: we don't know if there are duplicate letters. However, we haven't encountered any duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates for now.

We need to choose a word that has both C and O, and three other letters that are not in the absent list.

We also want to cover common letters that we haven't tested. The remaining common letters include: L, H, D, M, P, U, B, G, etc.

Let's try to form words:

Option 1: Put O in position 1 and C in position 2? 
   Word: O _ C _ _
   We need to fill the blanks. Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

   Example: ""OCCUR"" -> but has two C's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but we can try. However, we have only one C known so far, and if we use two C's, we might get confused. Also, ""OCCUR"" has U and R (R is excluded) -> invalid.

   ""OCHRE"" -> has R and E (excluded) -> invalid.

   ""OCLAD"" -> not a common word.

   ""OCHIN"" -> not common.

   ""OCHRE"" is invalid.

   How about ""OCHER""? -> has E and R -> invalid.

   This is difficult.

Option 2: Put O in position 1 and C in position 3?
   Word: O _ C _ _
   Example: ""OUPHE"" -> not common and has E.

   ""OCTAL"" -> has T (excluded) -> invalid.

   ""OCCAM"" -> has A (excluded) -> invalid.

   ""OCHER"" -> invalid.

   Not many common words.

Option 3: Put O in position 1 and C in position 4?
   Word: O _ _ C _
   Example: ""OPERA"" -> has E and R -> invalid.
   ""OBIIT"" -> not common and has I (excluded) -> invalid.

   ""OCTAD"" -> has T -> invalid.

   ""OCHOS"" -> has S -> invalid.

   Still difficult.

Option 4: Put O in position 2 and C in position 3?
   Word: _ O C _ _
   Example: ""FOCUS"" -> has F, O, C, U, S -> but S is excluded -> invalid.
   ""LOCUS"" -> has L, O, C, U, S -> S excluded -> invalid.
   ""DOCKS"" -> has S -> invalid.

   We need to avoid S.

   ""BLOCK"" -> has B, L, O, C, K -> but we don't know about B, L, K. And S is not in it. But we have to avoid T? ""BLOCK"" has no T, but it has B, L, O, C, K. However, we have to check if any of these are excluded? We haven't excluded B, L, K. And O and C are included.

   But note: we are putting O in position 3? In ""BLOCK"", O is in position 3? But we know from guess 2 that O is not in position 3? Actually, the feedback for ""stoic"" said O is in the word but not in position 3. So we cannot put O in position 3 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not there. So we should avoid position 3 for O.

   In ""BLOCK"", O is in position 3? Let's see:
        B L O C K -> positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:O, 4:C, 5:K -> so O is in 3, which we know is wrong. So we should avoid that.

   We must avoid putting O in position 3 because we already know it's not there.

   So for the pattern _ O C _ _, we would have O in position 2 and C in position 3. Then we need to fill the first and last positions.

   Example: ""DOCKS"" -> has S -> invalid.

   ""FOCUS"" -> has S -> invalid.

   ""LOCUM"" -> has U, M, but no C? We need C. ""LOCUM"" is L, O, C, U, M -> but that's 5 letters? L O C U M -> positions: 1:L, 2:O, 3:C, 4:U, 5:M. But we are putting O in position 2 and C in position 3. This is acceptable? But we don't know if O can be in position 2? We haven't tested O in position 2.

   However, we know O is not in position 3, but position 2 is untested.

   But ""LOCUM"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning a place or a thing.

   But we have to avoid S, T, I, etc. ""LOCUM"" has L, O, C, U, M -> no S, T, I, R, A, N, E. So it's acceptable.

   But we are putting C in position 3. We know C is not in position 1 or 5, but position 3 is untested.

   However, we are also putting O in position 2. We don't know if O is in position 2.

   But note: we are testing two new positions for C and O.

   Alternatively, we can try to put C in position 2 and O in position 4? 
        Word: _ C _ O _
        Example: ""SCOWL"" -> but S is excluded -> invalid.
        ""ACORN"" -> A and R excluded -> invalid.

   ""OCULI"" -> has I -> invalid.

   ""OCHER"" -> invalid.

   This is challenging.

   Let me try putting O in position 4 and C in position 2:
        Word: _ C _ O _
        Example: ""CLOAK"" -> has A -> invalid.
        ""CROOK"" -> has R -> invalid.
        ""DUCAT"" -> has T -> invalid.

   Not working.

   Put O in position 5 and C in position 3?
        Word: _ _ C _ O
        Example: ""MANCO"" -> has A and N -> invalid.
        ""FICUS"" -> has I and S -> invalid.

   ""MUCRO"" -> has U, C, R, O -> R excluded -> invalid.

   ""MACHO"" -> has A -> invalid.

   This is difficult.

   Put O in position 1 and C in position 4:
        Word: O _ _ C _
        Example: ""OPIUM"" -> has I and U? But I is excluded. -> invalid.
        ""OCTYL"" -> has T and Y, L -> but T excluded -> invalid.

   ""OCHER"" -> invalid.

   Put O in position 2 and C in position 4:
        Word: _ O _ C _
        Example: ""BLOCK"" -> we already considered, but O is in position 3? In ""BLOCK"": B(1), L(2), O(3), C(4), K(5) -> so O is in 3, which we know is wrong. So we cannot use that.

   We must avoid position 3 for O.

   So for _ O _ C _, we need O in position 2 and C in position 4. Then the third position must be filled.

   Example: ""DOUCE"" -> has E -> invalid.
        ""FOCUS"" -> has S -> invalid.

   ""LOCUS"" -> has S -> invalid.

   ""VOCAL"" -> has A -> invalid.

   ""YOCKS"" -> has S -> invalid.

   Not working.

   Put O in position 4 and C in position 2:
        Word: _ C _ O _
        Example: ""SCOWL"" -> S excluded -> invalid.
        ""ACROW"" -> A and R excluded -> invalid.

   ""OCULI"" -> has I -> invalid.

   This is difficult.

   Put O in position 5 and C in position 3:
        Word: _ _ C _ O
        Example: ""MANCO"" -> A and N excluded -> invalid.
        ""FICUS"" -> I and S excluded -> invalid.

   ""MUCRO"" -> R excluded -> invalid.

   ""MACHO"" -> A excluded -> invalid.

   Given the difficulty, let's consider putting C in position 2 and O in position 4? 
        Word: _ C _ O _
        But we need to fill position 1, 3, and 5.

        Example: ""CLOAK"" -> A excluded -> invalid.
        ""CROCK"" -> R and C (duplicate?) -> but we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, R excluded -> invalid.

        ""DUCAT"" -> T excluded -> invalid.

        ""FACET"" -> A, E, T excluded -> invalid.

        ""PILOT"" -> has I and T -> invalid.

        ""MUCOR"" -> R excluded -> invalid.

        ""MYCO"" -> too short? 5 letters? ""MYCOS"" -> has S -> invalid.

        ""YCLAD"" -> not common.

   This is not working.

   Let me try putting C in position 4 and O in position 1? 
        Word: O _ _ C _
        Example: ""OBIIT"" -> has I -> invalid.
        ""OCHER"" -> invalid.

        ""OCTYL"" -> T excluded -> invalid.

        ""OUPHE"" -> E -> invalid.

        ""OUMAS"" -> has S -> invalid.

        ""OUMA"" -> too short.

   Not working.

   Put O in position 1 and C in position 3:
        Word: O _ C _ _
        Example: ""OCCUR"" -> has R -> invalid.
        ""OCHER"" -> invalid.

        ""OCTAD"" -> T excluded -> invalid.

        ""OCTYL"" -> T excluded -> invalid.

        ""OCHOS"" -> S excluded -> invalid.

        ""OCHRE"" -> E and R excluded -> invalid.

   This is difficult.

   Put O in position 1 and C in position 4:
        Word: O _ _ C _
        Example: ""OPERA"" -> E and R -> invalid.
        ""OBIIT"" -> I -> invalid.
        ""OCTAD"" -> T excluded -> invalid.

        ""OCHER"" -> invalid.

        ""OUMAS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""OUMA"" -> too short.

   Not working.

   Put O in position 1 and C in position 5: 
        Word: O _ _ _ C
        Example: ""OPING"" -> not a word? 
        ""OUBIT"" -> has I -> invalid.
        ""OCTIC"" -> T excluded -> invalid.

        ""OCHRE"" -> E and R -> invalid.

        ""OCHOS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""OCHRY"" -> R -> invalid.

        ""OCHUM"" -> U, M -> but ""OCHUM"" is not common? And we have to avoid R? It doesn't have R, but has U and M. But is it a word? Not really.

        ""OCTYL"" -> T excluded.

   This is difficult.

   Put O in position 2 and C in position 4:
        Word: _ O _ C _
        Example: ""BLOCK"" -> O is in position 3? No, in ""BLOCK"": 
            Position 1: B, 2: L, 3: O, 4: C, 5: K -> so O is in 3, which we know is wrong. So we cannot use that.

        We need O in position 2 and C in position 4. So the word: 
            Position 1: ?
            Position 2: O
            Position 3: ? (must not be O, because then we have two O's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, we haven't seen O twice, so maybe the word has only one O? But we don't know. We can try a word with two O's? But we don't have evidence of duplicates.)

        Example: ""DOUCE"" -> E -> invalid.
        ""FOCUS"" -> S -> invalid.
        ""LOCUS"" -> S -> invalid.
        ""VOCAL"" -> A -> invalid.

        ""YOCKS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""BOCKS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""LOCKO"" -> not a word.

        ""BLOCK"" is invalid because O is in position 3.

        How about ""DOCKS"" -> has S -> invalid.

        ""HOCKS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""POCKS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""WOCK"" -> too short.

   This is difficult.

   Put O in position 2 and C in position 3:
        Word: _ O C _ _
        Example: ""FOCUS"" -> S -> invalid.
        ""LOCUS"" -> S -> invalid.
        ""COCKS"" -> has S -> invalid.
        ""DOCKS"" -> S -> invalid.
        ""HOCKS"" -> S -> invalid.
        ""POCKS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""YOCKS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""BLOCK"" -> O is in position 3 -> invalid.

        How about ""COUCH"" -> has U, C, H -> but C is in position 2 and 4? We are putting C in position 3? 
            ""COUCH"": C(1), O(2), U(3), C(4), H(5) -> but we are trying to put C in position 3? Actually, in ""COUCH"", the first C is position 1, which we know is not correct, and the third letter is U, and then C in position 4. But we are trying to test C in position 3? 
            However, we are putting O in position 2 and C in position 3? In ""COUCH"", O is in position 2, but then we have C in position 1 (which we know is wrong) and then U and H. So we cannot use C in position 1.

        We need a word that has C in position 3 and O in position 2. But ""COUCH"" has C in position 1 and 4, not 3.

        How about ""DOUCE"" -> E -> invalid.

        ""FOCUS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""LOCUM"" -> but then O is in position 2, C in position 3? 
            ""LOCUM"": L(1), O(2), C(3), U(4), M(5). This avoids the excluded letters. And we are testing L, O, C, U, M. 
            But note: we are putting O in position 2 and C in position 3. This is acceptable because we haven't tested O in position 2 and C in position 3.

            Is ""LOCUM"" a word? Yes, meaning a place or a thing.

            And it avoids R, A, N, E, S, T, I.

            So ""LOCUM"" is a candidate.

   So we have a candidate: ""LOCUM""

   But let's check the positions:
        L in position 1: we don't know.
        O in position 2: we are testing O in position 2.
        C in position 3: we are testing C in position 3.
        U in position 4: we don't know.
        M in position 5: we don't know.

   This seems like a good test.

   But note: we are putting O in position 2. We don't know if O is in position 2. Similarly, C in position 3 is new.

   We also test L, U, M.

   Alternatively, we can try ""LOCUS"" but it has S -> invalid.

   Another candidate: ""DOCKS"" is invalid because of S.

   How about ""FOCUS"" -> invalid.

   ""LOCUM"" seems acceptable.

   But we have to consider that we are putting C in position 3. We know C is not in position 1 or 5, but position 3 is possible.

   Another candidate: ""MUCUS"" -> has S -> invalid.

   ""FACET"" -> invalid.

   ""PICO"" -> too short.

   ""CLOCUS"" -> has S -> invalid.

   So ""LOCUM"" is a candidate.

   But let me see if there's a better one.

   How about ""BOCCE"" -> has E -> invalid.

   ""COWPS"" -> has S -> invalid.

   ""HOWFC"" -> not a word.

   ""JUMBO"" -> no C.

   We need C.

   Another idea: put O in position 4 and C in position 2? 
        Word: _ C _ O _
        Example: ""SCOWL"" -> S -> invalid.
        ""ACOWP"" -> A and S excluded -> invalid.

        ""OCULI"" -> I -> invalid.

        ""OCHER"" -> invalid.

        ""OCTAD"" -> T excluded.

        ""OCTYL"" -> T excluded.

        ""OCHOS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""OCHRY"" -> R -> invalid.

        ""OCHUM"" -> not common.

        ""LOCUM"" is one of the few options.

   Or put O in position 5 and C in position 2: 
        Word: _ C _ _ O
        Example: ""SCALO"" -> A and S -> invalid.
        ""FOCUS"" -> S -> invalid.
        ""DOCKO"" -> has O in position 5? But we are putting O in position 5, and C in position 2. But ""DOCKO"" is not a word.

        ""YCLAD"" -> not common.

        ""MUCRO"" -> R -> invalid.

        ""MUCOR"" -> R -> invalid.

        ""MUCID"" -> has I -> invalid.

        ""MUCUS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""CUMIN"" -> has N -> invalid.

        ""CUMUL"" -> not common.

        ""CUPRO"" -> R -> invalid.

        ""CUPSO"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""CUPID"" -> has I -> invalid.

        ""CUPRO"" -> R -> invalid.

        ""CUPSO"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""CABOC"" -> A -> invalid.

        ""CABOB"" -> A -> invalid.

        ""CACKO"" -> has A -> invalid.

        ""CACAO"" -> A -> invalid.

        ""CACTI"" -> A and I -> invalid.

        ""CACTI"" has A and I -> both excluded.

        ""CACTI"" is invalid.

        ""FACED"" -> A, E, D -> A and E excluded -> invalid.

        ""FACET"" -> A, E, T -> all excluded -> invalid.

        ""FICUS"" -> I, S -> invalid.

        ""FICUS"" is invalid.

        ""FUGUS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""HUMIC"" -> has I -> invalid.

        ""LUMPS"" -> has S -> invalid.

        ""MUCIC"" -> I -> invalid.

        ""MUCRO"" -> R -> invalid.

        ""MUCUS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""PULCO"" -> has U, L, C, O -> but ""PULCO"" is not common? And it has P, U, L, C, O. But we don't know about P, U, L. And it avoids the excluded letters? 
            P, U, L, C, O -> no R, A, N, E, S, T, I. So it's acceptable.

        ""PULCO"" is a word? I think it's a proper noun? Not common. Let me check: actually, ""pulco"" is not a standard word. 

        ""PULMO"" -> has M, O -> but no C? We need C.

        ""PULIS"" -> has S -> invalid.

        ""PULKA"" -> has A -> invalid.

        ""PULMO"" -> no C.

        ""PUMICE"" -> too long.

        ""PUMICE"" is 6 letters.

        ""PUMAS"" -> has A and S -> invalid.

        ""PUMBO"" -> has B, O -> but no C? We need C.

        ""PUMICE"" is 6 letters.

        ""PUNKO"" -> has U, N, K, O -> N excluded -> invalid.

        ""PUNKO"" has N -> invalid.

        ""PUPCO"" -> has U, P, C, O -> but ""PUPCO"" is not common? And it has P, U, C, O. But we don't know about P, U. And it avoids excluded letters? 
            P, U, P, C, O -> duplicate P? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. We can try, but let's avoid for now.

        ""PUPCO"" is not standard.

   After some research, ""LOCUM"" seems to be a valid word and meets the criteria.

   But let me confirm: 
        L: not excluded -> okay.
        O: we are testing in position 2 -> okay.
        C: we are testing in position 3 -> okay.
        U: not excluded -> okay.
        M: not excluded -> okay.

   And it avoids R, A, N, E, S, T, I.

   So I think ""LOCUM"" is a good guess.

   But note: we are putting O in position 2 and C in position 3. We know O is not in position 3, but position 2 is untested. Similarly, C is not in 1 or 5, so position 3 is untested.

   We also test L, U, M.

   Alternatively, we can try ""COUCH"" but that has C in position 1 (which we know is wrong) and O in position 2. But we cannot use C in position 1. So that's out.

   Another candidate: ""DOUCE"" -> has E -> invalid.

   ""LOCUM"" seems best.

   But wait, what about ""CLOMP""? We cannot because C is in position 1.

   How about ""CLOPS""? C in position 1 -> invalid.

   We must avoid position 1 for C.

   So ""LOCUM"" is a good choice.

   But let me see if there's a word that has O in position 4 and C in position 2? 
        Word: _ C _ O _
        Example: ""SCOWL"" -> S -> invalid.
        ""ACOWP"" -> A and S excluded -> invalid.

        ""OCULI"" -> I -> invalid.

        ""OCHER"" -> invalid.

        ""OCTAD"" -> T excluded.

        ""OCTYL"" -> T excluded.

        ""OCHOS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""OCHRY"" -> R -> invalid.

        ""OCHUM"" -> not common.

        ""LOCUM"" is one of the few.

   Or ""CUMIN"" -> has N -> invalid.

   Another: ""CUMUL"" -> not common.

   So I think ""LOCUM"" is a reasonable choice.

   But note: we are putting C in position 3. We know that C is not in position 1 or 5, but position 3 is possible.

   We'll go with ""LOCUM"".

   So the guess is ""LOCUM"".

   Format: <guess>locum</guess>

   But let me double-check the word: L-O-C-U-M.

   Positions:
        1: L -> test L
        2: O -> test O in position 2
        3: C -> test C in position 3
        4: U -> test U
        5: M -> test M

   This will give us information about the positions of C and O, and also about L, U, M.

   If we get a match for O in position 2, that would be great. But if not, we know O is not in position 2.

   Similarly for C in position 3.

   And we test L, U, M.

   So it's informative.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has O in position 4 and C in position 2? 
        Word: _ C _ O _
        Example: ""SCOWL"" -> S -> invalid.
        ""ACOWP"" -> A and S excluded -> invalid.

        ""OCULI"" -> I -> invalid.

        ""OCHER"" -> invalid.

        ""OCTAD"" -> T excluded.

        ""OCTYL"" -> T excluded.

        ""OCHOS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""OCHRY"" -> R -> invalid.

        ""OCHUM"" -> not common.

        ""LOCUM"" is the only common word I can think of for this pattern.

   Or ""CLOPS"" -> C in position 1 -> invalid.

   So I think ""LOCUM"" is the best.

   Therefore, we guess ""LOCUM"".

   But note: we are putting O in position 2 and C in position 3. We know that O is not in position 3, but position 2 is new. C is not in position 1 or 5, so position 3 is new.

   We'll go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **C** is in the word but not in positions 1 or 5 (from ""crane"" and ""stoic"" feedback).
- **O** is in the word but not in position 3 (from ""stoic"" feedback).
- Absent letters: R, A, N, E, S, T, I (cannot be used).
- Present letters: C and O must be included, with C in positions 2, 3, or 4 and O in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

For the next guess, I chose ""locum"" because:
- It includes both required letters (**C** and **O**) in untested positions: **C** in position 3 and **O** in position 2.
- It avoids all absent letters (R, A, N, E, S, T, I).
- It tests new common letters (L, U, M) to gather more information.
- The word is valid and helps narrow down positions for C and O while covering frequent consonants.

<guess>locum</guess>",locum,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(-), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""stoic"" -> S(x), T(x), O(-), I(x), C(-)
Meaning:
- S is not in the word.
- T is not in the word.
- O is in the word but not in position 3 (since in ""stoic"", O is the third letter).
- I is not in the word.
- C is in the word but not in position 5 (since in ""stoic"", C is the fifth letter).

So, combining the information:

Letters known to be absent: R, A, N, E, S, T, I
Letters known to be present: C and O

For C:
- It is not in position 1 (from guess 1) and not in position 5 (from guess 2). So it must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

For O:
- It is in the word but not in position 3 (from guess 2). So it could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We also know that the secret word has exactly 5 letters, and we have two known letters: C and O. But there are three more letters we don't know.

We need to avoid the absent letters: R, A, N, E, S, T, I.

Available letters: We can use any letter except the absent ones. Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We have 4 more guesses (since we used 2, and we have 6 total).

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Contains C and O (both must be present, but we don't know their positions yet).
- Does not contain R, A, N, E, S, T, I.
- We can use other letters from the available set.

We also want to test new common letters to get more information.

Let's think about the positions for C and O:

- C must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- O must not be in position 3 (from the feedback of ""stoic""), so O can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

But note: we don't know if there are duplicate letters. However, we haven't encountered any duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates for now.

We need to choose a word that has both C and O, and three other letters that are not in the absent list.

We also want to cover common letters that we haven't tested. The remaining common letters include: L, H, D, M, P, U, B, G, etc.

Let's try to form words:

Option 1: Put O in position 1 and C in position 2? 
   Word: O _ C _ _
   We need to fill the blanks. Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

   Example: ""OCCUR"" -> but has two C's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but we can try. However, we have only one C known so far, and if we use two C's, we might get confused. Also, ""OCCUR"" has U and R (R is excluded) -> invalid.

   ""OCHRE"" -> has R and E (excluded) -> invalid.

   ""OCLAD"" -> not a common word.

   ""OCHIN"" -> not common.

   ""OCHRE"" is invalid.

   How about ""OCHER""? -> has E and R -> invalid.

   This is difficult.

Option 2: Put O in position 1 and C in position 3?
   Word: O _ C _ _
   Example: ""OUPHE"" -> not common and has E.

   ""OCTAL"" -> has T (excluded) -> invalid.

   ""OCCAM"" -> has A (excluded) -> invalid.

   ""OCHER"" -> invalid.

   Not many common words.

Option 3: Put O in position 1 and C in position 4?
   Word: O _ _ C _
   Example: ""OPERA"" -> has E and R -> invalid.
   ""OBIIT"" -> not common and has I (excluded) -> invalid.

   ""OCTAD"" -> has T -> invalid.

   ""OCHOS"" -> has S -> invalid.

   Still difficult.

Option 4: Put O in position 2 and C in position 3?
   Word: _ O C _ _
   Example: ""FOCUS"" -> has F, O, C, U, S -> but S is excluded -> invalid.
   ""LOCUS"" -> has L, O, C, U, S -> S excluded -> invalid.
   ""DOCKS"" -> has S -> invalid.

   We need to avoid S.

   ""BLOCK"" -> has B, L, O, C, K -> but we don't know about B, L, K. And S is not in it. But we have to avoid T? ""BLOCK"" has no T, but it has B, L, O, C, K. However, we have to check if any of these are excluded? We haven't excluded B, L, K. And O and C are included.

   But note: we are putting O in position 3? In ""BLOCK"", O is in position 3? But we know from guess 2 that O is not in position 3? Actually, the feedback for ""stoic"" said O is in the word but not in position 3. So we cannot put O in position 3 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not there. So we should avoid position 3 for O.

   In ""BLOCK"", O is in position 3? Let's see:
        B L O C K -> positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:O, 4:C, 5:K -> so O is in 3, which we know is wrong. So we should avoid that.

   We must avoid putting O in position 3 because we already know it's not there.

   So for the pattern _ O C _ _, we would have O in position 2 and C in position 3. Then we need to fill the first and last positions.

   Example: ""DOCKS"" -> has S -> invalid.

   ""FOCUS"" -> has S -> invalid.

   ""LOCUM"" -> has U, M, but no C? We need C. ""LOCUM"" is L, O, C, U, M -> but that's 5 letters? L O C U M -> positions: 1:L, 2:O, 3:C, 4:U, 5:M. But we are putting O in position 2 and C in position 3. This is acceptable? But we don't know if O can be in position 2? We haven't tested O in position 2.

   However, we know O is not in position 3, but position 2 is untested.

   But ""LOCUM"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning a place or a thing.

   But we have to avoid S, T, I, etc. ""LOCUM"" has L, O, C, U, M -> no S, T, I, R, A, N, E. So it's acceptable.

   But we are putting C in position 3. We know C is not in position 1 or 5, but position 3 is untested.

   However, we are also putting O in position 2. We don't know if O is in position 2.

   But note: we are testing two new positions for C and O.

   Alternatively, we can try to put C in position 2 and O in position 4? 
        Word: _ C _ O _
        Example: ""SCOWL"" -> but S is excluded -> invalid.
        ""ACORN"" -> A and R excluded -> invalid.

   ""OCULI"" -> has I -> invalid.

   ""OCHER"" -> invalid.

   This is challenging.

   Let me try putting O in position 4 and C in position 2:
        Word: _ C _ O _
        Example: ""CLOAK"" -> has A -> invalid.
        ""CROOK"" -> has R -> invalid.
        ""DUCAT"" -> has T -> invalid.

   Not working.

   Put O in position 5 and C in position 3?
        Word: _ _ C _ O
        Example: ""MANCO"" -> has A and N -> invalid.
        ""FICUS"" -> has I and S -> invalid.

   ""MUCRO"" -> has U, C, R, O -> R excluded -> invalid.

   ""MACHO"" -> has A -> invalid.

   This is difficult.

   Put O in position 1 and C in position 4:
        Word: O _ _ C _
        Example: ""OPIUM"" -> has I and U? But I is excluded. -> invalid.
        ""OCTYL"" -> has T and Y, L -> but T excluded -> invalid.

   ""OCHER"" -> invalid.

   Put O in position 2 and C in position 4:
        Word: _ O _ C _
        Example: ""BLOCK"" -> we already considered, but O is in position 3? In ""BLOCK"": B(1), L(2), O(3), C(4), K(5) -> so O is in 3, which we know is wrong. So we cannot use that.

   We must avoid position 3 for O.

   So for _ O _ C _, we need O in position 2 and C in position 4. Then the third position must be filled.

   Example: ""DOUCE"" -> has E -> invalid.
        ""FOCUS"" -> has S -> invalid.

   ""LOCUS"" -> has S -> invalid.

   ""VOCAL"" -> has A -> invalid.

   ""YOCKS"" -> has S -> invalid.

   Not working.

   Put O in position 4 and C in position 2:
        Word: _ C _ O _
        Example: ""SCOWL"" -> S excluded -> invalid.
        ""ACROW"" -> A and R excluded -> invalid.

   ""OCULI"" -> has I -> invalid.

   This is difficult.

   Put O in position 5 and C in position 3:
        Word: _ _ C _ O
        Example: ""MANCO"" -> A and N excluded -> invalid.
        ""FICUS"" -> I and S excluded -> invalid.

   ""MUCRO"" -> R excluded -> invalid.

   ""MACHO"" -> A excluded -> invalid.

   Given the difficulty, let's consider putting C in position 2 and O in position 4? 
        Word: _ C _ O _
        But we need to fill position 1, 3, and 5.

        Example: ""CLOAK"" -> A excluded -> invalid.
        ""CROCK"" -> R and C (duplicate?) -> but we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, R excluded -> invalid.

        ""DUCAT"" -> T excluded -> invalid.

        ""FACET"" -> A, E, T excluded -> invalid.

        ""PILOT"" -> has I and T -> invalid.

        ""MUCOR"" -> R excluded -> invalid.

        ""MYCO"" -> too short? 5 letters? ""MYCOS"" -> has S -> invalid.

        ""YCLAD"" -> not common.

   This is not working.

   Let me try putting C in position 4 and O in position 1? 
        Word: O _ _ C _
        Example: ""OBIIT"" -> has I -> invalid.
        ""OCHER"" -> invalid.

        ""OCTYL"" -> T excluded -> invalid.

        ""OUPHE"" -> E -> invalid.

        ""OUMAS"" -> has S -> invalid.

        ""OUMA"" -> too short.

   Not working.

   Put O in position 1 and C in position 3:
        Word: O _ C _ _
        Example: ""OCCUR"" -> has R -> invalid.
        ""OCHER"" -> invalid.

        ""OCTAD"" -> T excluded -> invalid.

        ""OCTYL"" -> T excluded -> invalid.

        ""OCHOS"" -> S excluded -> invalid.

        ""OCHRE"" -> E and R excluded -> invalid.

   This is difficult.

   Put O in position 1 and C in position 4:
        Word: O _ _ C _
        Example: ""OPERA"" -> E and R -> invalid.
        ""OBIIT"" -> I -> invalid.
        ""OCTAD"" -> T excluded -> invalid.

        ""OCHER"" -> invalid.

        ""OUMAS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""OUMA"" -> too short.

   Not working.

   Put O in position 1 and C in position 5: 
        Word: O _ _ _ C
        Example: ""OPING"" -> not a word? 
        ""OUBIT"" -> has I -> invalid.
        ""OCTIC"" -> T excluded -> invalid.

        ""OCHRE"" -> E and R -> invalid.

        ""OCHOS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""OCHRY"" -> R -> invalid.

        ""OCHUM"" -> U, M -> but ""OCHUM"" is not common? And we have to avoid R? It doesn't have R, but has U and M. But is it a word? Not really.

        ""OCTYL"" -> T excluded.

   This is difficult.

   Put O in position 2 and C in position 4:
        Word: _ O _ C _
        Example: ""BLOCK"" -> O is in position 3? No, in ""BLOCK"": 
            Position 1: B, 2: L, 3: O, 4: C, 5: K -> so O is in 3, which we know is wrong. So we cannot use that.

        We need O in position 2 and C in position 4. So the word: 
            Position 1: ?
            Position 2: O
            Position 3: ? (must not be O, because then we have two O's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, we haven't seen O twice, so maybe the word has only one O? But we don't know. We can try a word with two O's? But we don't have evidence of duplicates.)

        Example: ""DOUCE"" -> E -> invalid.
        ""FOCUS"" -> S -> invalid.
        ""LOCUS"" -> S -> invalid.
        ""VOCAL"" -> A -> invalid.

        ""YOCKS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""BOCKS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""LOCKO"" -> not a word.

        ""BLOCK"" is invalid because O is in position 3.

        How about ""DOCKS"" -> has S -> invalid.

        ""HOCKS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""POCKS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""WOCK"" -> too short.

   This is difficult.

   Put O in position 2 and C in position 3:
        Word: _ O C _ _
        Example: ""FOCUS"" -> S -> invalid.
        ""LOCUS"" -> S -> invalid.
        ""COCKS"" -> has S -> invalid.
        ""DOCKS"" -> S -> invalid.
        ""HOCKS"" -> S -> invalid.
        ""POCKS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""YOCKS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""BLOCK"" -> O is in position 3 -> invalid.

        How about ""COUCH"" -> has U, C, H -> but C is in position 2 and 4? We are putting C in position 3? 
            ""COUCH"": C(1), O(2), U(3), C(4), H(5) -> but we are trying to put C in position 3? Actually, in ""COUCH"", the first C is position 1, which we know is not correct, and the third letter is U, and then C in position 4. But we are trying to test C in position 3? 
            However, we are putting O in position 2 and C in position 3? In ""COUCH"", O is in position 2, but then we have C in position 1 (which we know is wrong) and then U and H. So we cannot use C in position 1.

        We need a word that has C in position 3 and O in position 2. But ""COUCH"" has C in position 1 and 4, not 3.

        How about ""DOUCE"" -> E -> invalid.

        ""FOCUS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""LOCUM"" -> but then O is in position 2, C in position 3? 
            ""LOCUM"": L(1), O(2), C(3), U(4), M(5). This avoids the excluded letters. And we are testing L, O, C, U, M. 
            But note: we are putting O in position 2 and C in position 3. This is acceptable because we haven't tested O in position 2 and C in position 3.

            Is ""LOCUM"" a word? Yes, meaning a place or a thing.

            And it avoids R, A, N, E, S, T, I.

            So ""LOCUM"" is a candidate.

   So we have a candidate: ""LOCUM""

   But let's check the positions:
        L in position 1: we don't know.
        O in position 2: we are testing O in position 2.
        C in position 3: we are testing C in position 3.
        U in position 4: we don't know.
        M in position 5: we don't know.

   This seems like a good test.

   But note: we are putting O in position 2. We don't know if O is in position 2. Similarly, C in position 3 is new.

   We also test L, U, M.

   Alternatively, we can try ""LOCUS"" but it has S -> invalid.

   Another candidate: ""DOCKS"" is invalid because of S.

   How about ""FOCUS"" -> invalid.

   ""LOCUM"" seems acceptable.

   But we have to consider that we are putting C in position 3. We know C is not in position 1 or 5, but position 3 is possible.

   Another candidate: ""MUCUS"" -> has S -> invalid.

   ""FACET"" -> invalid.

   ""PICO"" -> too short.

   ""CLOCUS"" -> has S -> invalid.

   So ""LOCUM"" is a candidate.

   But let me see if there's a better one.

   How about ""BOCCE"" -> has E -> invalid.

   ""COWPS"" -> has S -> invalid.

   ""HOWFC"" -> not a word.

   ""JUMBO"" -> no C.

   We need C.

   Another idea: put O in position 4 and C in position 2? 
        Word: _ C _ O _
        Example: ""SCOWL"" -> S -> invalid.
        ""ACOWP"" -> A and S excluded -> invalid.

        ""OCULI"" -> I -> invalid.

        ""OCHER"" -> invalid.

        ""OCTAD"" -> T excluded.

        ""OCTYL"" -> T excluded.

        ""OCHOS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""OCHRY"" -> R -> invalid.

        ""OCHUM"" -> not common.

        ""LOCUM"" is one of the few options.

   Or put O in position 5 and C in position 2: 
        Word: _ C _ _ O
        Example: ""SCALO"" -> A and S -> invalid.
        ""FOCUS"" -> S -> invalid.
        ""DOCKO"" -> has O in position 5? But we are putting O in position 5, and C in position 2. But ""DOCKO"" is not a word.

        ""YCLAD"" -> not common.

        ""MUCRO"" -> R -> invalid.

        ""MUCOR"" -> R -> invalid.

        ""MUCID"" -> has I -> invalid.

        ""MUCUS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""CUMIN"" -> has N -> invalid.

        ""CUMUL"" -> not common.

        ""CUPRO"" -> R -> invalid.

        ""CUPSO"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""CUPID"" -> has I -> invalid.

        ""CUPRO"" -> R -> invalid.

        ""CUPSO"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""CABOC"" -> A -> invalid.

        ""CABOB"" -> A -> invalid.

        ""CACKO"" -> has A -> invalid.

        ""CACAO"" -> A -> invalid.

        ""CACTI"" -> A and I -> invalid.

        ""CACTI"" has A and I -> both excluded.

        ""CACTI"" is invalid.

        ""FACED"" -> A, E, D -> A and E excluded -> invalid.

        ""FACET"" -> A, E, T -> all excluded -> invalid.

        ""FICUS"" -> I, S -> invalid.

        ""FICUS"" is invalid.

        ""FUGUS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""HUMIC"" -> has I -> invalid.

        ""LUMPS"" -> has S -> invalid.

        ""MUCIC"" -> I -> invalid.

        ""MUCRO"" -> R -> invalid.

        ""MUCUS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""PULCO"" -> has U, L, C, O -> but ""PULCO"" is not common? And it has P, U, L, C, O. But we don't know about P, U, L. And it avoids the excluded letters? 
            P, U, L, C, O -> no R, A, N, E, S, T, I. So it's acceptable.

        ""PULCO"" is a word? I think it's a proper noun? Not common. Let me check: actually, ""pulco"" is not a standard word. 

        ""PULMO"" -> has M, O -> but no C? We need C.

        ""PULIS"" -> has S -> invalid.

        ""PULKA"" -> has A -> invalid.

        ""PULMO"" -> no C.

        ""PUMICE"" -> too long.

        ""PUMICE"" is 6 letters.

        ""PUMAS"" -> has A and S -> invalid.

        ""PUMBO"" -> has B, O -> but no C? We need C.

        ""PUMICE"" is 6 letters.

        ""PUNKO"" -> has U, N, K, O -> N excluded -> invalid.

        ""PUNKO"" has N -> invalid.

        ""PUPCO"" -> has U, P, C, O -> but ""PUPCO"" is not common? And it has P, U, C, O. But we don't know about P, U. And it avoids excluded letters? 
            P, U, P, C, O -> duplicate P? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. We can try, but let's avoid for now.

        ""PUPCO"" is not standard.

   After some research, ""LOCUM"" seems to be a valid word and meets the criteria.

   But let me confirm: 
        L: not excluded -> okay.
        O: we are testing in position 2 -> okay.
        C: we are testing in position 3 -> okay.
        U: not excluded -> okay.
        M: not excluded -> okay.

   And it avoids R, A, N, E, S, T, I.

   So I think ""LOCUM"" is a good guess.

   But note: we are putting O in position 2 and C in position 3. We know O is not in position 3, but position 2 is untested. Similarly, C is not in 1 or 5, so position 3 is untested.

   We also test L, U, M.

   Alternatively, we can try ""COUCH"" but that has C in position 1 (which we know is wrong) and O in position 2. But we cannot use C in position 1. So that's out.

   Another candidate: ""DOUCE"" -> has E -> invalid.

   ""LOCUM"" seems best.

   But wait, what about ""CLOMP""? We cannot because C is in position 1.

   How about ""CLOPS""? C in position 1 -> invalid.

   We must avoid position 1 for C.

   So ""LOCUM"" is a good choice.

   But let me see if there's a word that has O in position 4 and C in position 2? 
        Word: _ C _ O _
        Example: ""SCOWL"" -> S -> invalid.
        ""ACOWP"" -> A and S excluded -> invalid.

        ""OCULI"" -> I -> invalid.

        ""OCHER"" -> invalid.

        ""OCTAD"" -> T excluded.

        ""OCTYL"" -> T excluded.

        ""OCHOS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""OCHRY"" -> R -> invalid.

        ""OCHUM"" -> not common.

        ""LOCUM"" is one of the few.

   Or ""CUMIN"" -> has N -> invalid.

   Another: ""CUMUL"" -> not common.

   So I think ""LOCUM"" is a reasonable choice.

   But note: we are putting C in position 3. We know that C is not in position 1 or 5, but position 3 is possible.

   We'll go with ""LOCUM"".

   So the guess is ""LOCUM"".

   Format: <guess>locum</guess>

   But let me double-check the word: L-O-C-U-M.

   Positions:
        1: L -> test L
        2: O -> test O in position 2
        3: C -> test C in position 3
        4: U -> test U
        5: M -> test M

   This will give us information about the positions of C and O, and also about L, U, M.

   If we get a match for O in position 2, that would be great. But if not, we know O is not in position 2.

   Similarly for C in position 3.

   And we test L, U, M.

   So it's informative.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has O in position 4 and C in position 2? 
        Word: _ C _ O _
        Example: ""SCOWL"" -> S -> invalid.
        ""ACOWP"" -> A and S excluded -> invalid.

        ""OCULI"" -> I -> invalid.

        ""OCHER"" -> invalid.

        ""OCTAD"" -> T excluded.

        ""OCTYL"" -> T excluded.

        ""OCHOS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""OCHRY"" -> R -> invalid.

        ""OCHUM"" -> not common.

        ""LOCUM"" is the only common word I can think of for this pattern.

   Or ""CLOPS"" -> C in position 1 -> invalid.

   So I think ""LOCUM"" is the best.

   Therefore, we guess ""LOCUM"".

   But note: we are putting O in position 2 and C in position 3. We know that O is not in position 3, but position 2 is new. C is not in position 1 or 5, so position 3 is new.

   We'll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **C** is in the word but not in positions 1 or 5 (from ""crane"" and ""stoic"" feedback).
- **O** is in the word but not in position 3 (from ""stoic"" feedback).
- Absent letters: R, A, N, E, S, T, I (cannot be used).
- Present letters: C and O must be included, with C in positions 2, 3, or 4 and O in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

For the next guess, I chose ""locum"" because:
- It includes both required letters (**C** and **O**) in untested positions: **C** in position 3 and **O** in position 2.
- It avoids all absent letters (R, A, N, E, S, T, I).
- It tests new common letters (L, U, M) to gather more information.
- The word is valid and helps narrow down positions for C and O while covering frequent consonants.",Guess 3: locum -> FEEDBACK: L(x) O(✓) C(✓) U(x) M(x),FAIL

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 04 Sep 2025

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: - (meaning C is in the secret word but in the wrong position)
 R: x (R is not in the secret word)
 A: x (A is not in the secret word)
 N: x (N is not in the secret word)
 E: x (E is not in the secret word)

 So, from this feedback, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letter 'C', but not in the first position (since in ""crane"", C is the first letter and it's marked as wrong position).
 - The letters R, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word has the letter 'C' in one of the positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (since it's not in position 1).

 Also, we know that the secret word does not contain: R, A, N, E.

 Since we have only one letter that is present ('C'), we need to choose a new word that:
 1. Includes the letter 'C' (but not in the first position, because in the first guess it was in the first position and was wrong).
 2. Avoids the letters R, A, N, E.

 Additionally, we want to maximize information by including other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 Let's think of common letters that are not R, A, N, E. Some common letters are: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

 We also note that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

 We can try to put 'C' in a different position. Since it was in position 1 and was wrong, we can try position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

 However, we don't know which position is correct. So we might want to try a word that has 'C' in a different position and also includes other common letters.

 Let's consider the following: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to try more letters.

 A good strategy is to use a word that has 'C' and four other new letters (that are common and not in the set {R, A, N, E}).

 We can try to use the letter 'S' which is very common. Also, we can try 'T', 'L', 'O', etc.

 Let's try to form a word that has 'C' and avoids R, A, N, E.

 Example words:
 - Could we use ""CLOUT""? But that has O and U, and T and L. However, we don't know if O, U, T, L are in the word.
 - Another idea: ""SCALP"" but that has S, C, A (but A is already excluded) -> so we cannot use A.

 We must avoid A, so let's avoid vowels for now? But we know the word has at least one vowel? Actually, we don't know, but commonly words have vowels.

 We have to use a word without A, E, and also without R, N.

 Let's think of words that have 'C' and without R, A, N, E.

 Possibilities: 
 - ""C"" in position 2: words like ?C??? 
   Example: ""SCULP"" (not common) or ""SCUFF"" (but has two F's and we don't know about F) -> not ideal for information.
 - ""C"" in position 3: ??C?? 
   Example: ""FANCY"" -> but has A (excluded) and N (excluded). So invalid.
 - ""C"" in position 4: ???C?
   Example: ""TOPIC"" -> has O, P, I, C. But we don't know about O, P, I. Also, we can use this.

 However, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Another idea: ""CLOMP"" -> but has O, M, P. But we don't know about O, M, P. Also, we avoid R, A, N, E.

 But note: we have to avoid R, A, N, E. So ""CLOMP"" is acceptable? Let's check: C is in position 1? We want to avoid position 1 for C? Actually, we can put C in any position except 1? But wait, the feedback said C is in the word but not in position 1. So we can try position 1 again? Actually, no, because the feedback said it's in the wrong position, so we know it's not in position 1. So we should avoid putting C in position 1 again.

 But note: the feedback only said that in the first guess, C was in position 1 and it was wrong. It doesn't say that the secret word has C in position 1? Actually, no: the feedback for C was (-) meaning it is in the word but not in position 1. So the secret word has a C, but not at position 1. Therefore, we can try C in positions 2,3,4,5.

 However, we are allowed to put C in position 1 again? But that would be redundant and we know it's not there. So we should avoid position 1 for C.

 So for the next guess, we should put C in one of positions 2,3,4,5.

 Let's try to form a word that has C in position 2: 
   _ C _ _ _

 We need to fill the blanks with letters that are not R, A, N, E.

 Common letters: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

 Example: ""SCULP"" (not common) -> let's think of more common words.

 How about ""SCHOL""? But that has S, C, H, O, L. But we don't know about S, H, O, L. Also, it's a valid word? Yes, meaning a school or a student.

 But note: we have to avoid R, A, N, E. ""SCHOL"" doesn't have any of these.

 Alternatively, ""CLOMP"" has C in position 1? We cannot put C in position 1. So we need a word that has C in position 2 or later.

 Let me try to list words with C in position 2: 
   Position 1: any letter except R, A, N, E, and also not C (because we are putting C in position 2) -> so we can use other consonants or vowels (but vowels: O, I, U are available, but we know the word must have at least one vowel? Actually, we don't know about vowels because we only know about A and E being absent. But the word might have I, O, U, or even Y?).

 Example: ""SCALY"" -> but has A (excluded) and L, Y. But A is excluded -> so invalid.
   ""SCOWL"" -> has O, W, L. But W is less common. And we don't know about O, W, L. Also, no excluded letters.

 But we can use ""SCOWL"". However, we have to consider that we are only on the second guess, so we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Another word: ""SCUBA"" -> has A (excluded) -> invalid.

 How about ""SCION""? -> has I, O, N -> but N is excluded! We cannot use N.

 So we must avoid N.

 Therefore, ""SCION"" is invalid because of N.

 Let me try ""SCUFF"" -> has U, F, F. But F is not very common. And we have two F's? We don't know if F is in the word.

 Alternatively, we can try C in position 3: 
   _ _ C _ _

 Example: ""FICUS"" -> has F, I, C, U, S. But F is not very common. And we have to avoid R, A, N, E -> which we are. But we can do better.

 How about ""MUSIC"" -> has M, U, S, I, C. But C is at the end (position 5). Also, we avoid R, A, N, E.

 But note: we have to avoid using the same letter twice? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But we can try.

 However, we are trying to get information. Using ""MUSIC"" would use M, U, S, I, C. That's five new letters (except C which we know is present). And we are putting C at the end.

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess told us that C is in the word but not in position 1. So if we put C in position 5, that's a new position.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PICKS"" -> but has S, I, C, K, S. But we don't know about P, I, K, S. However, we have two S's? And we are avoiding R, A, N, E.

 But we can also consider words that have C in position 4: 
   _ _ _ C _

 Example: ""TOPIC"" -> T, O, P, I, C. This avoids R, A, N, E. And we haven't tried T, O, P, I.

 But note: we are allowed to use T, O, P, I? Yes, because they are not excluded.

 However, we must avoid using letters that we know are absent: R, A, N, E.

 So ""TOPIC"" is a valid word and uses T, O, P, I, C.

 But we also want to cover more common consonants. Let's see the frequency of letters.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CLOMP"" but that has C in position 1? We cannot do that because we know C is not in position 1. So we must avoid position 1 for C.

 Therefore, we cannot use words that start with C.

 So let's try ""CLOMP"" is invalid because it has C in position 1.

 How about ""MUCKY""? -> but Y is less common.

 Another idea: ""PITCH"" -> has P, I, T, C, H. C is in position 4. This avoids R, A, N, E. And we get to test P, I, T, C, H.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has H or not. But that's the point of guessing.

 Alternatively, ""C"" in position 5: 
   _ _ _ _ C

 Example: ""MANIC"" -> has A (excluded) and N (excluded) -> invalid.
   ""TOPIC"" -> we considered that, but it has C at the end.

 However, ""TOPIC"" has C at the end. We can use that.

 But let me check: the word ""TOPIC"" is valid.

 However, we can also try ""CLOPS"" -> but that has C in position 1? No, we cannot. So we must avoid C in position 1.

 Therefore, we can use words that have C in positions 2,3,4,5.

 Let me try to find a word that has C in position 2 and uses common letters: 
   Position 1: not C, and not R, A, N, E -> so we can use S, T, L, O, I, etc.
   Position 2: C
   Positions 3,4,5: other letters.

 Example: ""SCULP"" (not common) -> let's try ""SCUFF"" but that has two F's and is not very common.

 Another: ""SCHOL"" (as I thought earlier) -> S, C, H, O, L. This is a valid word. And we avoid R, A, N, E.

 But we can also try ""SLOTH"" -> but no C? We must include C because we know it's in the word. So we have to include C.

 So we must have C in the word.

 Therefore, let's choose between:
   Option 1: ""SCHOL"" (C in position 2) -> letters: S, C, H, O, L.
   Option 2: ""TOPIC"" (C in position 5) -> letters: T, O, P, I, C.

 Which one is better? 
   We want to cover more common letters. The frequency of letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... (but we have excluded A, E, R, N). So the most common left are T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U.

   ""TOPIC"" has T, O, P, I, C -> that's T, O, P, I, and C (which we know is present). 
   ""SCHOL"" has S, C, H, O, L -> S, H, O, L.

   The set of letters in ""TOPIC"" includes T, O, P, I, C. 
   The set of letters in ""SCHOL"" includes S, C, H, O, L.

   The frequency of T, O, P, I is higher than S, H, O, L? 
     T is very common, O is common, P is common, I is common. 
     S is also common, H is common, O is common, L is common.

   But note: we already know that the word has C, so we are testing 4 new letters in both.

   However, we have two options. We can choose either.

   But we can also consider ""CLOTH"" -> but C is in position 1? We cannot use that.

   How about ""SHOCK""? -> has S, H, O, C, K. C is in position 4. This avoids R, A, N, E. And we test S, H, O, C, K.

   This seems good because K is also common.

   But we have to choose one.

   Alternatively, ""CHOMP"" -> but C is in position 1? We cannot use that.

   So let's avoid position 1 for C.

   After considering, I think ""SHOCK"" is a good candidate: 
        S H O C K

   But note: we are putting C in position 4. We know C is in the word, but we don't know where. So position 4 is a good candidate?

   However, we don't know. We are trying to cover multiple positions.

   Another candidate: ""BLOCK"" -> but has B, L, O, C, K. But we don't know about B, L, O, K. And we avoid R, A, N, E. But note: we have to avoid using letters that are not in the word? We are allowed to use any letters, even if they are not present, to test.

   But we are only interested in letters that might be present.

   However, we already know that the word has C, so we should focus on other letters.

   Let me compare:

   ""SHOCK"": tests S, H, O, C, K. We know C is present, so we are testing S, H, O, K.
   ""BLOCK"": tests B, L, O, C, K. But note: we are putting C in position 4. Also, we avoid R, A, N, E.

   But we don't know if the word has O or not. Similarly for the others.

   We want to maximize the chance of getting more feedback.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has the letter 'S' because it's very common.

   How about ""SCOLD""? -> has S, C, O, L, but the word is ""SCOLD"". This avoids R, A, N, E. And C is in position 2.

   But we are putting C in position 2. This is a new position.

   Let me check: 
      Position 1: S
      Position 2: C
      Position 3: O
      Position 4: L
      Position 5: D

   This word: ""SCOLD"" -> S, C, O, L, D.

   We haven't tried S, O, L, D. And we know C is present.

   But note: we are not sure if the word has O or not. We are testing.

   Another common word: ""CLOCK"" -> but C is in position 1? We cannot use that.

   So ""SCOLD"" is a valid word.

   But we have to consider that we are using D. Alternatively, we can use ""SCULP"" but that's not common.

   Let me choose ""SCOLD"" because it uses common letters and we avoid the excluded ones.

   However, we have to make sure we don't use any of the excluded letters: R, A, N, E. ""SCOLD"" doesn't have any of these.

   So I will go with ""SCOLD"".

   But wait: what if the secret word has C in position 2? Then we get a match. But if not, we get feedback on S, C, O, L, D.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has C in a position that we haven't tried? Actually, in the first guess, we tried C in position 1. Now we are trying C in position 2. If we get a match in position 2, then we know. If not, we know that C is not in position 2 and we can try other positions.

   But we have 5 positions. We can try to cover multiple positions? Actually, we are doing that.

   However, we have only one known letter (C) and we are testing it in a new position.

   Let me decide: 

   Option 1: ""SCOLD"" -> tests S, C (in pos2), O, L, D.
   Option 2: ""TOPIC"" -> tests T, O, P, I, C (in pos5). 

   Both are good. But ""TOPIC"" has the advantage of having two vowels (O and I) which might be useful.

   But note: we already know that the word doesn't have A and E, so the vowels must be among I, O, U, and possibly Y.

   We haven't tested O, I, U. So testing two vowels at once might be efficient.

   Also, ""TOPIC"" has T and P which are common.

   So I think ""TOPIC"" is a good choice.

   But wait: we are putting C in position 5. We know C is in the word, but we don't know if it's in position 5. So we are testing that.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has C in a position that we haven't tried and also includes more common letters.

   After consideration, I think ""TOPIC"" is a good choice.

   So I will go with ""TOPIC"".

   But let me check: the word ""TOPIC"" is valid.

   Therefore, my second guess is ""TOPIC"".

   We are hoping to get feedback on T, O, P, I, and also on C (we know it will be either correct or present? Actually, we know it's present, so we expect either:
        - If the word has C in position 5: then we get C as correct (✓) and then we know the last letter is C.
        - Otherwise, we get C as (-) meaning it's in another position.

   But we are also testing T, O, P, I.

   So we will get information about these.

   Let me write the guess: TOPIC

   But note: we are not sure if the word has O or I. But that's the point.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has the letter 'S' because it's very common. 

   How about ""COSTS""? -> but C is in position 1? We cannot use that.

   How about ""SCOWL""? -> C in position 2. But we are avoiding R, A, N, E -> and it has W and L. W is less common. But it's acceptable.

   But we can do better: ""SCOWL"" is not as common.

   Another: ""STOIC"" -> has S, T, O, I, C. C is in position 5. This is a valid word. And we avoid R, A, N, E.

   ""STOIC"" is a common word.

   So between ""TOPIC"" and ""STOIC"", which one? 
        ""TOPIC"": T, O, P, I, C
        ""STOIC"": S, T, O, I, C

   Both are good. But ""STOIC"" has S which is very common. And we haven't tested S.

   So I think ""STOIC"" is a good choice.

   But note: we are putting C in position 5 in both. We don't know if that's correct.

   However, we are also testing S, T, O, I.

   Let me choose ""STOIC"".

   So my second guess: STOIC

   But wait: we are putting C in position 5. We know C is in the word, but we don't know if it's in position 5. So we are testing that.

   Alternatively, we can try to put C in a position that we haven't tested? Actually, we only tested position 1. So positions 2,3,4,5 are untested for C.

   We can choose any of 2,3,4,5. 

   I think ""STOIC"" is a good choice.

   So I'll go with ""STOIC"".

   But note: we are also testing S, T, O, I. And we know C is present.

   Therefore, I choose ""STOIC"".

   So the guess is ""stoic"".

   But let me confirm: 
        S: we don't know -> we are testing S.
        T: testing T.
        O: testing O.
        I: testing I.
        C: we know is present, so we are testing if it's in position 5.

   This will give us good information.

   So the word is ""STOIC"".

   We'll guess ""STOIC"".

   If the feedback for C is (-) then we know C is not in position 5, so it must be in 2,3, or 4.

   And we get information about S, T, O, I.

   So let's do that.

   Guess: stoic

   Format: <guess>stoic</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is present but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R, A, N, E are absent from the secret word.

For the next guess, I need to:
1. Include the letter ""C"" in a position other than 1 (since it was incorrect there).
2. Avoid using R, A, N, E.
3. Test new common letters to gather more information.

I chose ""stoic"" because:
- It places ""C"" in position 5 (a new position to test).
- It avoids excluded letters (R, A, N, E).
- It introduces four new common letters: S, T, O, I.
- The word is valid and balances vowel/consonant testing (O and I are vowels).

This guess will help identify the position of ""C"" and test for the presence of S, T, O, I.

<guess>stoic</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: stoic -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(-) I(x) C(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(-), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""stoic"" -> S(x), T(x), O(-), I(x), C(-)
Meaning:
- S is not in the word.
- T is not in the word.
- O is in the word but not in position 3 (since in ""stoic"", O is the third letter).
- I is not in the word.
- C is in the word but not in position 5 (since in ""stoic"", C is the fifth letter).

So, combining the information:

Letters known to be absent: R, A, N, E, S, T, I
Letters known to be present: C and O

For C:
- It is not in position 1 (from guess 1) and not in position 5 (from guess 2). So it must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

For O:
- It is in the word but not in position 3 (from guess 2). So it could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We also know that the secret word has exactly 5 letters, and we have two known letters: C and O. But there are three more letters we don't know.

We need to avoid the absent letters: R, A, N, E, S, T, I.

Available letters: We can use any letter except the absent ones. Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We have 4 more guesses (since we used 2, and we have 6 total).

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Contains C and O (both must be present, but we don't know their positions yet).
- Does not contain R, A, N, E, S, T, I.
- We can use other letters from the available set.

We also want to test new common letters to get more information.

Let's think about the positions for C and O:

- C must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- O must not be in position 3 (from the feedback of ""stoic""), so O can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

But note: we don't know if there are duplicate letters. However, we haven't encountered any duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates for now.

We need to choose a word that has both C and O, and three other letters that are not in the absent list.

We also want to cover common letters that we haven't tested. The remaining common letters include: L, H, D, M, P, U, B, G, etc.

Let's try to form words:

Option 1: Put O in position 1 and C in position 2? 
   Word: O _ C _ _
   We need to fill the blanks. Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

   Example: ""OCCUR"" -> but has two C's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but we can try. However, we have only one C known so far, and if we use two C's, we might get confused. Also, ""OCCUR"" has U and R (R is excluded) -> invalid.

   ""OCHRE"" -> has R and E (excluded) -> invalid.

   ""OCLAD"" -> not a common word.

   ""OCHIN"" -> not common.

   ""OCHRE"" is invalid.

   How about ""OCHER""? -> has E and R -> invalid.

   This is difficult.

Option 2: Put O in position 1 and C in position 3?
   Word: O _ C _ _
   Example: ""OUPHE"" -> not common and has E.

   ""OCTAL"" -> has T (excluded) -> invalid.

   ""OCCAM"" -> has A (excluded) -> invalid.

   ""OCHER"" -> invalid.

   Not many common words.

Option 3: Put O in position 1 and C in position 4?
   Word: O _ _ C _
   Example: ""OPERA"" -> has E and R -> invalid.
   ""OBIIT"" -> not common and has I (excluded) -> invalid.

   ""OCTAD"" -> has T -> invalid.

   ""OCHOS"" -> has S -> invalid.

   Still difficult.

Option 4: Put O in position 2 and C in position 3?
   Word: _ O C _ _
   Example: ""FOCUS"" -> has F, O, C, U, S -> but S is excluded -> invalid.
   ""LOCUS"" -> has L, O, C, U, S -> S excluded -> invalid.
   ""DOCKS"" -> has S -> invalid.

   We need to avoid S.

   ""BLOCK"" -> has B, L, O, C, K -> but we don't know about B, L, K. And S is not in it. But we have to avoid T? ""BLOCK"" has no T, but it has B, L, O, C, K. However, we have to check if any of these are excluded? We haven't excluded B, L, K. And O and C are included.

   But note: we are putting O in position 3? In ""BLOCK"", O is in position 3? But we know from guess 2 that O is not in position 3? Actually, the feedback for ""stoic"" said O is in the word but not in position 3. So we cannot put O in position 3 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not there. So we should avoid position 3 for O.

   In ""BLOCK"", O is in position 3? Let's see:
        B L O C K -> positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:O, 4:C, 5:K -> so O is in 3, which we know is wrong. So we should avoid that.

   We must avoid putting O in position 3 because we already know it's not there.

   So for the pattern _ O C _ _, we would have O in position 2 and C in position 3. Then we need to fill the first and last positions.

   Example: ""DOCKS"" -> has S -> invalid.

   ""FOCUS"" -> has S -> invalid.

   ""LOCUM"" -> has U, M, but no C? We need C. ""LOCUM"" is L, O, C, U, M -> but that's 5 letters? L O C U M -> positions: 1:L, 2:O, 3:C, 4:U, 5:M. But we are putting O in position 2 and C in position 3. This is acceptable? But we don't know if O can be in position 2? We haven't tested O in position 2.

   However, we know O is not in position 3, but position 2 is untested.

   But ""LOCUM"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning a place or a thing.

   But we have to avoid S, T, I, etc. ""LOCUM"" has L, O, C, U, M -> no S, T, I, R, A, N, E. So it's acceptable.

   But we are putting C in position 3. We know C is not in position 1 or 5, but position 3 is untested.

   However, we are also putting O in position 2. We don't know if O is in position 2.

   But note: we are testing two new positions for C and O.

   Alternatively, we can try to put C in position 2 and O in position 4? 
        Word: _ C _ O _
        Example: ""SCOWL"" -> but S is excluded -> invalid.
        ""ACORN"" -> A and R excluded -> invalid.

   ""OCULI"" -> has I -> invalid.

   ""OCHER"" -> invalid.

   This is challenging.

   Let me try putting O in position 4 and C in position 2:
        Word: _ C _ O _
        Example: ""CLOAK"" -> has A -> invalid.
        ""CROOK"" -> has R -> invalid.
        ""DUCAT"" -> has T -> invalid.

   Not working.

   Put O in position 5 and C in position 3?
        Word: _ _ C _ O
        Example: ""MANCO"" -> has A and N -> invalid.
        ""FICUS"" -> has I and S -> invalid.

   ""MUCRO"" -> has U, C, R, O -> R excluded -> invalid.

   ""MACHO"" -> has A -> invalid.

   This is difficult.

   Put O in position 1 and C in position 4:
        Word: O _ _ C _
        Example: ""OPIUM"" -> has I and U? But I is excluded. -> invalid.
        ""OCTYL"" -> has T and Y, L -> but T excluded -> invalid.

   ""OCHER"" -> invalid.

   Put O in position 2 and C in position 4:
        Word: _ O _ C _
        Example: ""BLOCK"" -> we already considered, but O is in position 3? In ""BLOCK"": B(1), L(2), O(3), C(4), K(5) -> so O is in 3, which we know is wrong. So we cannot use that.

   We must avoid position 3 for O.

   So for _ O _ C _, we need O in position 2 and C in position 4. Then the third position must be filled.

   Example: ""DOUCE"" -> has E -> invalid.
        ""FOCUS"" -> has S -> invalid.

   ""LOCUS"" -> has S -> invalid.

   ""VOCAL"" -> has A -> invalid.

   ""YOCKS"" -> has S -> invalid.

   Not working.

   Put O in position 4 and C in position 2:
        Word: _ C _ O _
        Example: ""SCOWL"" -> S excluded -> invalid.
        ""ACROW"" -> A and R excluded -> invalid.

   ""OCULI"" -> has I -> invalid.

   This is difficult.

   Put O in position 5 and C in position 3:
        Word: _ _ C _ O
        Example: ""MANCO"" -> A and N excluded -> invalid.
        ""FICUS"" -> I and S excluded -> invalid.

   ""MUCRO"" -> R excluded -> invalid.

   ""MACHO"" -> A excluded -> invalid.

   Given the difficulty, let's consider putting C in position 2 and O in position 4? 
        Word: _ C _ O _
        But we need to fill position 1, 3, and 5.

        Example: ""CLOAK"" -> A excluded -> invalid.
        ""CROCK"" -> R and C (duplicate?) -> but we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, R excluded -> invalid.

        ""DUCAT"" -> T excluded -> invalid.

        ""FACET"" -> A, E, T excluded -> invalid.

        ""PILOT"" -> has I and T -> invalid.

        ""MUCOR"" -> R excluded -> invalid.

        ""MYCO"" -> too short? 5 letters? ""MYCOS"" -> has S -> invalid.

        ""YCLAD"" -> not common.

   This is not working.

   Let me try putting C in position 4 and O in position 1? 
        Word: O _ _ C _
        Example: ""OBIIT"" -> has I -> invalid.
        ""OCHER"" -> invalid.

        ""OCTYL"" -> T excluded -> invalid.

        ""OUPHE"" -> E -> invalid.

        ""OUMAS"" -> has S -> invalid.

        ""OUMA"" -> too short.

   Not working.

   Put O in position 1 and C in position 3:
        Word: O _ C _ _
        Example: ""OCCUR"" -> has R -> invalid.
        ""OCHER"" -> invalid.

        ""OCTAD"" -> T excluded -> invalid.

        ""OCTYL"" -> T excluded -> invalid.

        ""OCHOS"" -> S excluded -> invalid.

        ""OCHRE"" -> E and R excluded -> invalid.

   This is difficult.

   Put O in position 1 and C in position 4:
        Word: O _ _ C _
        Example: ""OPERA"" -> E and R -> invalid.
        ""OBIIT"" -> I -> invalid.
        ""OCTAD"" -> T excluded -> invalid.

        ""OCHER"" -> invalid.

        ""OUMAS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""OUMA"" -> too short.

   Not working.

   Put O in position 1 and C in position 5: 
        Word: O _ _ _ C
        Example: ""OPING"" -> not a word? 
        ""OUBIT"" -> has I -> invalid.
        ""OCTIC"" -> T excluded -> invalid.

        ""OCHRE"" -> E and R -> invalid.

        ""OCHOS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""OCHRY"" -> R -> invalid.

        ""OCHUM"" -> U, M -> but ""OCHUM"" is not common? And we have to avoid R? It doesn't have R, but has U and M. But is it a word? Not really.

        ""OCTYL"" -> T excluded.

   This is difficult.

   Put O in position 2 and C in position 4:
        Word: _ O _ C _
        Example: ""BLOCK"" -> O is in position 3? No, in ""BLOCK"": 
            Position 1: B, 2: L, 3: O, 4: C, 5: K -> so O is in 3, which we know is wrong. So we cannot use that.

        We need O in position 2 and C in position 4. So the word: 
            Position 1: ?
            Position 2: O
            Position 3: ? (must not be O, because then we have two O's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, we haven't seen O twice, so maybe the word has only one O? But we don't know. We can try a word with two O's? But we don't have evidence of duplicates.)

        Example: ""DOUCE"" -> E -> invalid.
        ""FOCUS"" -> S -> invalid.
        ""LOCUS"" -> S -> invalid.
        ""VOCAL"" -> A -> invalid.

        ""YOCKS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""BOCKS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""LOCKO"" -> not a word.

        ""BLOCK"" is invalid because O is in position 3.

        How about ""DOCKS"" -> has S -> invalid.

        ""HOCKS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""POCKS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""WOCK"" -> too short.

   This is difficult.

   Put O in position 2 and C in position 3:
        Word: _ O C _ _
        Example: ""FOCUS"" -> S -> invalid.
        ""LOCUS"" -> S -> invalid.
        ""COCKS"" -> has S -> invalid.
        ""DOCKS"" -> S -> invalid.
        ""HOCKS"" -> S -> invalid.
        ""POCKS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""YOCKS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""BLOCK"" -> O is in position 3 -> invalid.

        How about ""COUCH"" -> has U, C, H -> but C is in position 2 and 4? We are putting C in position 3? 
            ""COUCH"": C(1), O(2), U(3), C(4), H(5) -> but we are trying to put C in position 3? Actually, in ""COUCH"", the first C is position 1, which we know is not correct, and the third letter is U, and then C in position 4. But we are trying to test C in position 3? 
            However, we are putting O in position 2 and C in position 3? In ""COUCH"", O is in position 2, but then we have C in position 1 (which we know is wrong) and then U and H. So we cannot use C in position 1.

        We need a word that has C in position 3 and O in position 2. But ""COUCH"" has C in position 1 and 4, not 3.

        How about ""DOUCE"" -> E -> invalid.

        ""FOCUS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""LOCUM"" -> but then O is in position 2, C in position 3? 
            ""LOCUM"": L(1), O(2), C(3), U(4), M(5). This avoids the excluded letters. And we are testing L, O, C, U, M. 
            But note: we are putting O in position 2 and C in position 3. This is acceptable because we haven't tested O in position 2 and C in position 3.

            Is ""LOCUM"" a word? Yes, meaning a place or a thing.

            And it avoids R, A, N, E, S, T, I.

            So ""LOCUM"" is a candidate.

   So we have a candidate: ""LOCUM""

   But let's check the positions:
        L in position 1: we don't know.
        O in position 2: we are testing O in position 2.
        C in position 3: we are testing C in position 3.
        U in position 4: we don't know.
        M in position 5: we don't know.

   This seems like a good test.

   But note: we are putting O in position 2. We don't know if O is in position 2. Similarly, C in position 3 is new.

   We also test L, U, M.

   Alternatively, we can try ""LOCUS"" but it has S -> invalid.

   Another candidate: ""DOCKS"" is invalid because of S.

   How about ""FOCUS"" -> invalid.

   ""LOCUM"" seems acceptable.

   But we have to consider that we are putting C in position 3. We know C is not in position 1 or 5, but position 3 is possible.

   Another candidate: ""MUCUS"" -> has S -> invalid.

   ""FACET"" -> invalid.

   ""PICO"" -> too short.

   ""CLOCUS"" -> has S -> invalid.

   So ""LOCUM"" is a candidate.

   But let me see if there's a better one.

   How about ""BOCCE"" -> has E -> invalid.

   ""COWPS"" -> has S -> invalid.

   ""HOWFC"" -> not a word.

   ""JUMBO"" -> no C.

   We need C.

   Another idea: put O in position 4 and C in position 2? 
        Word: _ C _ O _
        Example: ""SCOWL"" -> S -> invalid.
        ""ACOWP"" -> A and S excluded -> invalid.

        ""OCULI"" -> I -> invalid.

        ""OCHER"" -> invalid.

        ""OCTAD"" -> T excluded.

        ""OCTYL"" -> T excluded.

        ""OCHOS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""OCHRY"" -> R -> invalid.

        ""OCHUM"" -> not common.

        ""LOCUM"" is one of the few options.

   Or put O in position 5 and C in position 2: 
        Word: _ C _ _ O
        Example: ""SCALO"" -> A and S -> invalid.
        ""FOCUS"" -> S -> invalid.
        ""DOCKO"" -> has O in position 5? But we are putting O in position 5, and C in position 2. But ""DOCKO"" is not a word.

        ""YCLAD"" -> not common.

        ""MUCRO"" -> R -> invalid.

        ""MUCOR"" -> R -> invalid.

        ""MUCID"" -> has I -> invalid.

        ""MUCUS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""CUMIN"" -> has N -> invalid.

        ""CUMUL"" -> not common.

        ""CUPRO"" -> R -> invalid.

        ""CUPSO"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""CUPID"" -> has I -> invalid.

        ""CUPRO"" -> R -> invalid.

        ""CUPSO"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""CABOC"" -> A -> invalid.

        ""CABOB"" -> A -> invalid.

        ""CACKO"" -> has A -> invalid.

        ""CACAO"" -> A -> invalid.

        ""CACTI"" -> A and I -> invalid.

        ""CACTI"" has A and I -> both excluded.

        ""CACTI"" is invalid.

        ""FACED"" -> A, E, D -> A and E excluded -> invalid.

        ""FACET"" -> A, E, T -> all excluded -> invalid.

        ""FICUS"" -> I, S -> invalid.

        ""FICUS"" is invalid.

        ""FUGUS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""HUMIC"" -> has I -> invalid.

        ""LUMPS"" -> has S -> invalid.

        ""MUCIC"" -> I -> invalid.

        ""MUCRO"" -> R -> invalid.

        ""MUCUS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""PULCO"" -> has U, L, C, O -> but ""PULCO"" is not common? And it has P, U, L, C, O. But we don't know about P, U, L. And it avoids the excluded letters? 
            P, U, L, C, O -> no R, A, N, E, S, T, I. So it's acceptable.

        ""PULCO"" is a word? I think it's a proper noun? Not common. Let me check: actually, ""pulco"" is not a standard word. 

        ""PULMO"" -> has M, O -> but no C? We need C.

        ""PULIS"" -> has S -> invalid.

        ""PULKA"" -> has A -> invalid.

        ""PULMO"" -> no C.

        ""PUMICE"" -> too long.

        ""PUMICE"" is 6 letters.

        ""PUMAS"" -> has A and S -> invalid.

        ""PUMBO"" -> has B, O -> but no C? We need C.

        ""PUMICE"" is 6 letters.

        ""PUNKO"" -> has U, N, K, O -> N excluded -> invalid.

        ""PUNKO"" has N -> invalid.

        ""PUPCO"" -> has U, P, C, O -> but ""PUPCO"" is not common? And it has P, U, C, O. But we don't know about P, U. And it avoids excluded letters? 
            P, U, P, C, O -> duplicate P? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. We can try, but let's avoid for now.

        ""PUPCO"" is not standard.

   After some research, ""LOCUM"" seems to be a valid word and meets the criteria.

   But let me confirm: 
        L: not excluded -> okay.
        O: we are testing in position 2 -> okay.
        C: we are testing in position 3 -> okay.
        U: not excluded -> okay.
        M: not excluded -> okay.

   And it avoids R, A, N, E, S, T, I.

   So I think ""LOCUM"" is a good guess.

   But note: we are putting O in position 2 and C in position 3. We know O is not in position 3, but position 2 is untested. Similarly, C is not in 1 or 5, so position 3 is untested.

   We also test L, U, M.

   Alternatively, we can try ""COUCH"" but that has C in position 1 (which we know is wrong) and O in position 2. But we cannot use C in position 1. So that's out.

   Another candidate: ""DOUCE"" -> has E -> invalid.

   ""LOCUM"" seems best.

   But wait, what about ""CLOMP""? We cannot because C is in position 1.

   How about ""CLOPS""? C in position 1 -> invalid.

   We must avoid position 1 for C.

   So ""LOCUM"" is a good choice.

   But let me see if there's a word that has O in position 4 and C in position 2? 
        Word: _ C _ O _
        Example: ""SCOWL"" -> S -> invalid.
        ""ACOWP"" -> A and S excluded -> invalid.

        ""OCULI"" -> I -> invalid.

        ""OCHER"" -> invalid.

        ""OCTAD"" -> T excluded.

        ""OCTYL"" -> T excluded.

        ""OCHOS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""OCHRY"" -> R -> invalid.

        ""OCHUM"" -> not common.

        ""LOCUM"" is one of the few.

   Or ""CUMIN"" -> has N -> invalid.

   Another: ""CUMUL"" -> not common.

   So I think ""LOCUM"" is a reasonable choice.

   But note: we are putting C in position 3. We know that C is not in position 1 or 5, but position 3 is possible.

   We'll go with ""LOCUM"".

   So the guess is ""LOCUM"".

   Format: <guess>locum</guess>

   But let me double-check the word: L-O-C-U-M.

   Positions:
        1: L -> test L
        2: O -> test O in position 2
        3: C -> test C in position 3
        4: U -> test U
        5: M -> test M

   This will give us information about the positions of C and O, and also about L, U, M.

   If we get a match for O in position 2, that would be great. But if not, we know O is not in position 2.

   Similarly for C in position 3.

   And we test L, U, M.

   So it's informative.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has O in position 4 and C in position 2? 
        Word: _ C _ O _
        Example: ""SCOWL"" -> S -> invalid.
        ""ACOWP"" -> A and S excluded -> invalid.

        ""OCULI"" -> I -> invalid.

        ""OCHER"" -> invalid.

        ""OCTAD"" -> T excluded.

        ""OCTYL"" -> T excluded.

        ""OCHOS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""OCHRY"" -> R -> invalid.

        ""OCHUM"" -> not common.

        ""LOCUM"" is the only common word I can think of for this pattern.

   Or ""CLOPS"" -> C in position 1 -> invalid.

   So I think ""LOCUM"" is the best.

   Therefore, we guess ""LOCUM"".

   But note: we are putting O in position 2 and C in position 3. We know that O is not in position 3, but position 2 is new. C is not in position 1 or 5, so position 3 is new.

   We'll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **C** is in the word but not in positions 1 or 5 (from ""crane"" and ""stoic"" feedback).
- **O** is in the word but not in position 3 (from ""stoic"" feedback).
- Absent letters: R, A, N, E, S, T, I (cannot be used).
- Present letters: C and O must be included, with C in positions 2, 3, or 4 and O in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

For the next guess, I chose ""locum"" because:
- It includes both required letters (**C** and **O**) in untested positions: **C** in position 3 and **O** in position 2.
- It avoids all absent letters (R, A, N, E, S, T, I).
- It tests new common letters (L, U, M) to gather more information.
- The word is valid and helps narrow down positions for C and O while covering frequent consonants.

Includes the letter \'C\' (but not in the first position, because in the first guess it was in the first position and was wrong).\n 2. Avoids the letters R, A, N, E.\n\n Additionally, we want to maximize information by including other common letters that we haven\'t tried yet.\n\n Let\'s think of common letters that are not R, A, N, E. Some common letters are: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.\n\n We also note that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.\n\n We can try to put \'C\' in a different position. Since it was in position 1 and was wrong, we can try position 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n However, we don\'t know which position is correct. So we might want to try a word that has \'C\' in a different position and also includes other common letters.\n\n Let\'s consider the following: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to try more letters.\n\n A good strategy is to use a word that has \'C\' and four other new letters (that are common and not in the set {R, A, N, E}).\n\n We can try to use the letter \'S\' which is very common. Also, we can try \'T\', \'L\', \'O\', etc.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that has \'C\' and avoids R, A, N, E.\n\n Example words:\n - Could we use ""CLOUT""? But that has O and U, and T and L. However, we don\'t know if O, U, T, L are in the word.\n - Another idea: ""SCALP"" but that has S, C, A (but A is already excluded) -> so we cannot use A.\n\n We must avoid A, so let\'s avoid vowels for now? But we know the word has at least one vowel? Actually, we don\'t know, but commonly words have vowels.\n\n We have to use a word without A, E, and also without R, N.\n\n Let\'s think of words that have \'C\' and without R, A, N, E.\n\n Possibilities: \n - ""C"" in position 2: words like ?C??? \n   Example: ""SCULP"" (not common) or ""SCUFF"" (but has two F\'s and we don\'t know about F) -> not ideal for information.\n - ""C"" in position 3: ??C?? \n   Example: ""FANCY"" -> but has A (excluded) and N (excluded). So invalid.\n - ""C"" in position 4: ???C?\n   Example: ""TOPIC"" -> has O, P, I, C. But we don\'t know about O, P, I. Also, we can use this.\n\n However, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\n Another idea: ""CLOMP"" -> but has O, M, P. But we don\'t know about O, M, P. Also, we avoid R, A, N, E.\n\n But note: we have to avoid R, A, N, E. So ""CLOMP"" is acceptable? Let\'s check: C is in position 1? We want to avoid position 1 for C? Actually, we can put C in any position except 1? But wait, the feedback said C is in the word but not in position 1. So we can try position 1 again? Actually, no, because the feedback said it\'s in the wrong position, so we know it\'s not in position 1. So we should avoid putting C in position 1 again.\n\n But note: the feedback only said that in the first guess, C was in position 1 and it was wrong. It doesn\'t say that the secret word has C in position 1? Actually, no: the feedback for C was (-) meaning it is in the word but not in position 1. So the secret word has a C, but not at position 1. Therefore, we can try C in positions 2,3,4,5.\n\n However, we are allowed to put C in position 1 again? But that would be redundant and we know it\'s not there. So we should avoid position 1 for C.\n\n So for the next guess, we should put C in one of positions 2,3,4,5.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that has C in position 2: \n   _ C _ _ _\n\n We need to fill the blanks with letters that are not R, A, N, E.\n\n Common letters: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.\n\n Example: ""SCULP"" (not common) -> let\'s think of more common words.\n\n How about ""SCHOL""? But that has S, C, H, O, L. But we don\'t know about S, H, O, L. Also, it\'s a valid word? Yes, meaning a school or a student.\n\n But note: we have to avoid R, A, N, E. ""SCHOL"" doesn\'t have any of these.\n\n Alternatively, ""CLOMP"" has C in position 1? We cannot put C in position 1. So we need a word that has C in position 2 or later.\n\n Let me try to list words with C in position 2: \n   Position 1: any letter except R, A, N, E, and also not C (because we are putting C in position 2) -> so we can use other consonants or vowels (but vowels: O, I, U are available, but we know the word must have at least one vowel? Actually, we don\'t know about vowels because we only know about A and E being absent. But the word might have I, O, U, or even Y?).\n\n Example: ""SCALY"" -> but has A (excluded) and L, Y. But A is excluded -> so invalid.\n   ""SCOWL"" -> has O, W, L. But W is less common. And we don\'t know about O, W, L. Also, no excluded letters.\n\n But we can use ""SCOWL"". However, we have to consider that we are only on the second guess, so we want to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\n Another word: ""SCUBA"" -> has A (excluded) -> invalid.\n\n How about ""SCION""? -> has I, O, N -> but N is excluded! We cannot use N.\n\n So we must avoid N.\n\n Therefore, ""SCION"" is invalid because of N.\n\n Let me try ""SCUFF"" -> has U, F, F. But F is not very common. And we have two F\'s? We don\'t know if F is in the word.\n\n Alternatively, we can try C in position 3: \n   _ _ C _ _\n\n Example: ""FICUS"" -> has F, I, C, U, S. But F is not very common. And we have to avoid R, A, N, E -> which we are. But we can do better.\n\n How about ""MUSIC"" -> has M, U, S, I, C. But C is at the end (position 5). Also, we avoid R, A, N, E.\n\n But note: we have to avoid using the same letter twice? We don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. But we can try.\n\n However, we are trying to get information. Using ""MUSIC"" would use M, U, S, I, C. That\'s five new letters (except C which we know is present). And we are putting C at the end.\n\n But wait: the feedback for the first guess told us that C is in the word but not in position 1. So if we put C in position 5, that\'s a new position.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""PICKS"" -> but has S, I, C, K, S. But we don\'t know about P, I, K, S. However, we have two S\'s? And we are avoiding R, A, N, E.\n\n But we can also consider words that have C in position 4: \n   _ _ _ C _\n\n Example: ""TOPIC"" -> T, O, P, I, C. This avoids R, A, N, E. And we haven\'t tried T, O, P, I.\n\n But note: we are allowed to use T, O, P, I? Yes, because they are not excluded.\n\n However, we must avoid using letters that we know are absent: R, A, N, E.\n\n So ""TOPIC"" is a valid word and uses T, O, P, I, C.\n\n But we also want to cover more common consonants. Let\'s see the frequency of letters.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""CLOMP"" but that has C in position 1? We cannot do that because we know C is not in position 1. So we must avoid position 1 for C.\n\n Therefore, we cannot use words that start with C.\n\n So let\'s try ""CLOMP"" is invalid because it has C in position 1.\n\n How about ""MUCKY""? -> but Y is less common.\n\n Another idea: ""PITCH"" -> has P, I, T, C, H. C is in position 4. This avoids R, A, N, E. And we get to test P, I, T, C, H.\n\n But note: we are not sure if the word has H or not. But that\'s the point of guessing.\n\n Alternatively, ""C"" in position 5: \n   _ _ _ _ C\n\n Example: ""MANIC"" -> has A (excluded) and N (excluded) -> invalid.\n   ""TOPIC"" -> we considered that, but it has C at the end.\n\n However, ""TOPIC"" has C at the end. We can use that.\n\n But let me check: the word ""TOPIC"" is valid.\n\n However, we can also try ""CLOPS"" -> but that has C in position 1? No, we cannot. So we must avoid C in position 1.\n\n Therefore, we can use words that have C in positions 2,3,4,5.\n\n Let me try to find a word that has C in position 2 and uses common letters: \n   Position 1: not C, and not R, A, N, E -> so we can use S, T, L, O, I, etc.\n   Position 2: C\n   Positions 3,4,5: other letters.\n\n Example: ""SCULP"" (not common) -> let\'s try ""SCUFF"" but that has two F\'s and is not very common.\n\n Another: ""SCHOL"" (as I thought earlier) -> S, C, H, O, L. This is a valid word. And we avoid R, A, N, E.\n\n But we can also try ""SLOTH"" -> but no C? We must include C because we know it\'s in the word. So we have to include C.\n\n So we must have C in the word.\n\n Therefore, let\'s choose between:\n   Option 1: ""SCHOL"" (C in position 2) -> letters: S, C, H, O, L.\n   Option 2: ""TOPIC"" (C in position 5) -> letters: T, O, P, I, C.\n\n Which one is better? \n   We want to cover more common letters. The frequency of letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... (but we have excluded A, E, R, N). So the most common left are T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U.\n\n   ""TOPIC"" has T, O, P, I, C -> that\'s T, O, P, I, and C (which we know is present). \n   ""SCHOL"" has S, C, H, O, L -> S, H, O, L.\n\n   The set of letters in ""TOPIC"" includes T, O, P, I, C. \n   The set of letters in ""SCHOL"" includes S, C, H, O, L.\n\n   The frequency of T, O, P, I is higher than S, H, O, L? \n     T is very common, O is common, P is common, I is common. \n     S is also common, H is common, O is common, L is common.\n\n   But note: we already know that the word has C, so we are testing 4 new letters in both.\n\n   However, we have two options. We can choose either.\n\n   But we can also consider ""CLOTH"" -> but C is in position 1? We cannot use that.\n\n   How about ""SHOCK""? -> has S, H, O, C, K. C is in position 4. This avoids R, A, N, E. And we test S, H, O, C, K.\n\n   This seems good because K is also common.\n\n   But we have to choose one.\n\n   Alternatively, ""CHOMP"" -> but C is in position 1? We cannot use that.\n\n   So let\'s avoid position 1 for C.\n\n   After considering, I think ""SHOCK"" is a good candidate: \n        S H O C K\n\n   But note: we are putting C in position 4. We know C is in the word, but we don\'t know where. So position 4 is a good candidate?\n\n   However, we don\'t know. We are trying to cover multiple positions.\n\n   Another candidate: ""BLOCK"" -> but has B, L, O, C, K. But we don\'t know about B, L, O, K. And we avoid R, A, N, E. But note: we have to avoid using letters that are not in the word? We are allowed to use any letters, even if they are not present, to test.\n\n   But we are only interested in letters that might be present.\n\n   However, we already know that the word has C, so we should focus on other letters.\n\n   Let me compare:\n\n   ""SHOCK"": tests S, H, O, C, K. We know C is present, so we are testing S, H, O, K.\n   ""BLOCK"": tests B, L, O, C, K. But note: we are putting C in position 4. Also, we avoid R, A, N, E.\n\n   But we don\'t know if the word has O or not. Similarly for the others.\n\n   We want to maximize the chance of getting more feedback.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try a word that has the letter \'S\' because it\'s very common.\n\n   How about ""SCOLD""? -> has S, C, O, L, but the word is ""SCOLD"". This avoids R, A, N, E. And C is in position 2.\n\n   But we are putting C in position 2. This is a new position.\n\n   Let me check: \n      Position 1: S\n      Position 2: C\n      Position 3: O\n      Position 4: L\n      Position 5: D\n\n   This word: ""SCOLD"" -> S, C, O, L, D.\n\n   We haven\'t tried S, O, L, D. And we know C is present.\n\n   But note: we are not sure if the word has O or not. We are testing.\n\n   Another common word: ""CLOCK"" -> but C is in position 1? We cannot use that.\n\n   So ""SCOLD"" is a valid word.\n\n   But we have to consider that we are using D. Alternatively, we can use ""SCULP"" but that\'s not common.\n\n   Let me choose ""SCOLD"" because it uses common letters and we avoid the excluded ones.\n\n   However, we have to make sure we don\'t use any of the excluded letters: R, A, N, E. ""SCOLD"" doesn\'t have any of these.\n\n   So I will go with ""SCOLD"".\n\n   But wait: what if the secret word has C in position 2? Then we get a match. But if not, we get feedback on S, C, O, L, D.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try a word that has C in a position that we haven\'t tried? Actually, in the first guess, we tried C in position 1. Now we are trying C in position 2. If we get a match in position 2, then we know. If not, we know that C is not in position 2 and we can try other positions.\n\n   But we have 5 positions. We can try to cover multiple positions? Actually, we are doing that.\n\n   However, we have only one known letter (C) and we are testing it in a new position.\n\n   Let me decide: \n\n   Option 1: ""SCOLD"" -> tests S, C (in pos2), O, L, D.\n   Option 2: ""TOPIC"" -> tests T, O, P, I, C (in pos5). \n\n   Both are good. But ""TOPIC"" has the advantage of having two vowels (O and I) which might be useful.\n\n   But note: we already know that the word doesn\'t have A and E, so the vowels must be among I, O, U, and possibly Y.\n\n   We haven\'t tested O, I, U. So testing two vowels at once might be efficient.\n\n   Also, ""TOPIC"" has T and P which are common.\n\n   So I think ""TOPIC"" is a good choice.\n\n   But wait: we are putting C in position 5. We know C is in the word, but we don\'t know if it\'s in position 5. So we are testing that.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try a word that has C in a position that we haven\'t tried and also includes more common letters.\n\n   After consideration, I think ""TOPIC"" is a good choice.\n\n   So I will go with ""TOPIC"".\n\n   But let me check: the word ""TOPIC"" is valid.\n\n   Therefore, my second guess is ""TOPIC"".\n\n   We are hoping to get feedback on T, O, P, I, and also on C (we know it will be either correct or present? Actually, we know it\'s present, so we expect either:\n        - If the word has C in position 5: then we get C as correct (✓) and then we know the last letter is C.\n        - Otherwise, we get C as (-) meaning it\'s in another position.\n\n   But we are also testing T, O, P, I.\n\n   So we will get information about these.\n\n   Let me write the guess: TOPIC\n\n   But note: we are not sure if the word has O or I. But that\'s the point.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try a word that has the letter \'S\' because it\'s very common. \n\n   How about ""COSTS""? -> but C is in position 1? We cannot use that.\n\n   How about ""SCOWL""? -> C in position 2. But we are avoiding R, A, N, E -> and it has W and L. W is less common. But it\'s acceptable.\n\n   But we can do better: ""SCOWL"" is not as common.\n\n   Another: ""STOIC"" -> has S, T, O, I, C. C is in position 5. This is a valid word. And we avoid R, A, N, E.\n\n   ""STOIC"" is a common word.\n\n   So between ""TOPIC"" and ""STOIC"", which one? \n        ""TOPIC"": T, O, P, I, C\n        ""STOIC"": S, T, O, I, C\n\n   Both are good. But ""STOIC"" has S which is very common. And we haven\'t tested S.\n\n   So I think ""STOIC"" is a good choice.\n\n   But note: we are putting C in position 5 in both. We don\'t know if that\'s correct.\n\n   However, we are also testing S, T, O, I.\n\n   Let me choose ""STOIC"".\n\n   So my second guess: STOIC\n\n   But wait: we are putting C in position 5. We know C is in the word, but we don\'t know if it\'s in position 5. So we are testing that.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try to put C in a position that we haven\'t tested? Actually, we only tested position 1. So positions 2,3,4,5 are untested for C.\n\n   We can choose any of 2,3,4,5. \n\n   I think ""STOIC"" is a good choice.\n\n   So I\'ll go with ""STOIC"".\n\n   But note: we are also testing S, T, O, I. And we know C is present.\n\n   Therefore, I choose ""STOIC"".\n\n   So the guess is ""stoic"".\n\n   But let me confirm: \n        S: we don\'t know -> we are testing S.\n        T: testing T.\n        O: testing O.\n        I: testing I.\n        C: we know is present, so we are testing if it\'s in position 5.\n\n   This will give us good information.\n\n   So the word is ""STOIC"".\n\n   We\'ll guess ""STOIC"".\n\n   If the feedback for C is (-) then we know C is not in position 5, so it must be in 2,3, or 4.\n\n   And we get information about S, T, O, I.\n\n   So let\'s do that.\n\n   Guess: stoic\n\n   Format: <guess>stoic</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C is present but in the wrong position (not position 1).\n- R, A, N, E are absent from the secret word.\n\nFor the next guess, I need to:\n1. Include the letter ""C"" in a position other than 1 (since it was incorrect there).\n2. Avoid using R, A, N, E.\n3. Test new common letters to gather more information.\n\nI chose ""stoic"" because:\n- It places ""C"" in position 5 (a new position to test).\n- It avoids excluded letters (R, A, N, E).\n- It introduces four new common letters: S, T, O, I.\n- The word is valid and balances vowel/consonant testing (O and I are vowels).\n\nThis guess will help identify the position of ""C"" and test for the presence of S, T, O, I.\n\n<guess>stoic</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: stoic -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(-) I(x) C(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(-), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x)\nMeaning:\n- C is in the word but not in position 1.\n- R, A, N, E are not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: ""stoic"" -> S(x), T(x), O(-), I(x), C(-)\nMeaning:\n- S is not in the word.\n- T is not in the word.\n- O is in the word but not in position 3 (since in ""stoic"", O is the third letter).\n- I is not in the word.\n- C is in the word but not in position 5 (since in ""stoic"", C is the fifth letter).\n\nSo, combining the information:\n\nLetters known to be absent: R, A, N, E, S, T, I\nLetters known to be present: C and O\n\nFor C:\n- It is not in position 1 (from guess 1) and not in position 5 (from guess 2). So it must be in position 2, 3, or 4.\n\nFor O:\n- It is in the word but not in position 3 (from guess 2). So it could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nWe also know that the secret word has exactly 5 letters, and we have two known letters: C and O. But there are three more letters we don\'t know.\n\nWe need to avoid the absent letters: R, A, N, E, S, T, I.\n\nAvailable letters: We can use any letter except the absent ones. Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nWe have 4 more guesses (since we used 2, and we have 6 total).\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that:\n- Contains C and O (both must be present, but we don\'t know their positions yet).\n- Does not contain R, A, N, E, S, T, I.\n- We can use other letters from the available set.\n\nWe also want to test new common letters to get more information.\n\nLet\'s think about the positions for C and O:\n\n- C must be in position 2, 3, or 4.\n- O must not be in position 3 (from the feedback of ""stoic""), so O can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if there are duplicate letters. However, we haven\'t encountered any duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates for now.\n\nWe need to choose a word that has both C and O, and three other letters that are not in the absent list.\n\nWe also want to cover common letters that we haven\'t tested. The remaining common letters include: L, H, D, M, P, U, B, G, etc.\n\nLet\'s try to form words:\n\nOption 1: Put O in position 1 and C in position 2? \n   Word: O _ C _ _\n   We need to fill the blanks. Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\n   Example: ""OCCUR"" -> but has two C\'s? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed, but we can try. However, we have only one C known so far, and if we use two C\'s, we might get confused. Also, ""OCCUR"" has U and R (R is excluded) -> invalid.\n\n   ""OCHRE"" -> has R and E (excluded) -> invalid.\n\n   ""OCLAD"" -> not a common word.\n\n   ""OCHIN"" -> not common.\n\n   ""OCHRE"" is invalid.\n\n   How about ""OCHER""? -> has E and R -> invalid.\n\n   This is difficult.\n\nOption 2: Put O in position 1 and C in position 3?\n   Word: O _ C _ _\n   Example: ""OUPHE"" -> not common and has E.\n\n   ""OCTAL"" -> has T (excluded) -> invalid.\n\n   ""OCCAM"" -> has A (excluded) -> invalid.\n\n   ""OCHER"" -> invalid.\n\n   Not many common words.\n\nOption 3: Put O in position 1 and C in position 4?\n   Word: O _ _ C _\n   Example: ""OPERA"" -> has E and R -> invalid.\n   ""OBIIT"" -> not common and has I (excluded) -> invalid.\n\n   ""OCTAD"" -> has T -> invalid.\n\n   ""OCHOS"" -> has S -> invalid.\n\n   Still difficult.\n\nOption 4: Put O in position 2 and C in position 3?\n   Word: _ O C _ _\n   Example: ""FOCUS"" -> has F, O, C, U, S -> but S is excluded -> invalid.\n   ""LOCUS"" -> has L, O, C, U, S -> S excluded -> invalid.\n   ""DOCKS"" -> has S -> invalid.\n\n   We need to avoid S.\n\n   ""BLOCK"" -> has B, L, O, C, K -> but we don\'t know about B, L, K. And S is not in it. But we have to avoid T? ""BLOCK"" has no T, but it has B, L, O, C, K. However, we have to check if any of these are excluded? We haven\'t excluded B, L, K. And O and C are included.\n\n   But note: we are putting O in position 3? In ""BLOCK"", O is in position 3? But we know from guess 2 that O is not in position 3? Actually, the feedback for ""stoic"" said O is in the word but not in position 3. So we cannot put O in position 3 again? Actually, we can, but we know it\'s not there. So we should avoid position 3 for O.\n\n   In ""BLOCK"", O is in position 3? Let\'s see:\n        B L O C K -> positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:O, 4:C, 5:K -> so O is in 3, which we know is wrong. So we should avoid that.\n\n   We must avoid putting O in position 3 because we already know it\'s not there.\n\n   So for the pattern _ O C _ _, we would have O in position 2 and C in position 3. Then we need to fill the first and last positions.\n\n   Example: ""DOCKS"" -> has S -> invalid.\n\n   ""FOCUS"" -> has S -> invalid.\n\n   ""LOCUM"" -> has U, M, but no C? We need C. ""LOCUM"" is L, O, C, U, M -> but that\'s 5 letters? L O C U M -> positions: 1:L, 2:O, 3:C, 4:U, 5:M. But we are putting O in position 2 and C in position 3. This is acceptable? But we don\'t know if O can be in position 2? We haven\'t tested O in position 2.\n\n   However, we know O is not in position 3, but position 2 is untested.\n\n   But ""LOCUM"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning a place or a thing.\n\n   But we have to avoid S, T, I, etc. ""LOCUM"" has L, O, C, U, M -> no S, T, I, R, A, N, E. So it\'s acceptable.\n\n   But we are putting C in position 3. We know C is not in position 1 or 5, but position 3 is untested.\n\n   However, we are also putting O in position 2. We don\'t know if O is in position 2.\n\n   But note: we are testing two new positions for C and O.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try to put C in position 2 and O in position 4? \n        Word: _ C _ O _\n        Example: ""SCOWL"" -> but S is excluded -> invalid.\n        ""ACORN"" -> A and R excluded -> invalid.\n\n   ""OCULI"" -> has I -> invalid.\n\n   ""OCHER"" -> invalid.\n\n   This is challenging.\n\n   Let me try putting O in position 4 and C in position 2:\n        Word: _ C _ O _\n        Example: ""CLOAK"" -> has A -> invalid.\n        ""CROOK"" -> has R -> invalid.\n        ""DUCAT"" -> has T -> invalid.\n\n   Not working.\n\n   Put O in position 5 and C in position 3?\n        Word: _ _ C _ O\n        Example: ""MANCO"" -> has A and N -> invalid.\n        ""FICUS"" -> has I and S -> invalid.\n\n   ""MUCRO"" -> has U, C, R, O -> R excluded -> invalid.\n\n   ""MACHO"" -> has A -> invalid.\n\n   This is difficult.\n\n   Put O in position 1 and C in position 4:\n        Word: O _ _ C _\n        Example: ""OPIUM"" -> has I and U? But I is excluded. -> invalid.\n        ""OCTYL"" -> has T and Y, L -> but T excluded -> invalid.\n\n   ""OCHER"" -> invalid.\n\n   Put O in position 2 and C in position 4:\n        Word: _ O _ C _\n        Example: ""BLOCK"" -> we already considered, but O is in position 3? In ""BLOCK"": B(1), L(2), O(3), C(4), K(5) -> so O is in 3, which we know is wrong. So we cannot use that.\n\n   We must avoid position 3 for O.\n\n   So for _ O _ C _, we need O in position 2 and C in position 4. Then the third position must be filled.\n\n   Example: ""DOUCE"" -> has E -> invalid.\n        ""FOCUS"" -> has S -> invalid.\n\n   ""LOCUS"" -> has S -> invalid.\n\n   ""VOCAL"" -> has A -> invalid.\n\n   ""YOCKS"" -> has S -> invalid.\n\n   Not working.\n\n   Put O in position 4 and C in position 2:\n        Word: _ C _ O _\n        Example: ""SCOWL"" -> S excluded -> invalid.\n        ""ACROW"" -> A and R excluded -> invalid.\n\n   ""OCULI"" -> has I -> invalid.\n\n   This is difficult.\n\n   Put O in position 5 and C in position 3:\n        Word: _ _ C _ O\n        Example: ""MANCO"" -> A and N excluded -> invalid.\n        ""FICUS"" -> I and S excluded -> invalid.\n\n   ""MUCRO"" -> R excluded -> invalid.\n\n   ""MACHO"" -> A excluded -> invalid.\n\n   Given the difficulty, let\'s consider putting C in position 2 and O in position 4? \n        Word: _ C _ O _\n        But we need to fill position 1, 3, and 5.\n\n        Example: ""CLOAK"" -> A excluded -> invalid.\n        ""CROCK"" -> R and C (duplicate?) -> but we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, R excluded -> invalid.\n\n        ""DUCAT"" -> T excluded -> invalid.\n\n        ""FACET"" -> A, E, T excluded -> invalid.\n\n        ""PILOT"" -> has I and T -> invalid.\n\n        ""MUCOR"" -> R excluded -> invalid.\n\n        ""MYCO"" -> too short? 5 letters? ""MYCOS"" -> has S -> invalid.\n\n        ""YCLAD"" -> not common.\n\n   This is not working.\n\n   Let me try putting C in position 4 and O in position 1? \n        Word: O _ _ C _\n        Example: ""OBIIT"" -> has I -> invalid.\n        ""OCHER"" -> invalid.\n\n        ""OCTYL"" -> T excluded -> invalid.\n\n        ""OUPHE"" -> E -> invalid.\n\n        ""OUMAS"" -> has S -> invalid.\n\n        ""OUMA"" -> too short.\n\n   Not working.\n\n   Put O in position 1 and C in position 3:\n        Word: O _ C _ _\n        Example: ""OCCUR"" -> has R -> invalid.\n        ""OCHER"" -> invalid.\n\n        ""OCTAD"" -> T excluded -> invalid.\n\n        ""OCTYL"" -> T excluded -> invalid.\n\n        ""OCHOS"" -> S excluded -> invalid.\n\n        ""OCHRE"" -> E and R excluded -> invalid.\n\n   This is difficult.\n\n   Put O in position 1 and C in position 4:\n        Word: O _ _ C _\n        Example: ""OPERA"" -> E and R -> invalid.\n        ""OBIIT"" -> I -> invalid.\n        ""OCTAD"" -> T excluded -> invalid.\n\n        ""OCHER"" -> invalid.\n\n        ""OUMAS"" -> S -> invalid.\n\n        ""OUMA"" -> too short.\n\n   Not working.\n\n   Put O in position 1 and C in position 5: \n        Word: O _ _ _ C\n        Example: ""OPING"" -> not a word? \n        ""OUBIT"" -> has I -> invalid.\n        ""OCTIC"" -> T excluded -> invalid.\n\n        ""OCHRE"" -> E and R -> invalid.\n\n        ""OCHOS"" -> S -> invalid.\n\n        ""OCHRY"" -> R -> invalid.\n\n        ""OCHUM"" -> U, M -> but ""OCHUM"" is not common? And we have to avoid R? It doesn\'t have R, but has U and M. But is it a word? Not really.\n\n        ""OCTYL"" -> T excluded.\n\n   This is difficult.\n\n   Put O in position 2 and C in position 4:\n        Word: _ O _ C _\n        Example: ""BLOCK"" -> O is in position 3? No, in ""BLOCK"": \n            Position 1: B, 2: L, 3: O, 4: C, 5: K -> so O is in 3, which we know is wrong. So we cannot use that.\n\n        We need O in position 2 and C in position 4. So the word: \n            Position 1: ?\n            Position 2: O\n            Position 3: ? (must not be O, because then we have two O\'s? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. However, we haven\'t seen O twice, so maybe the word has only one O? But we don\'t know. We can try a word with two O\'s? But we don\'t have evidence of duplicates.)\n\n        Example: ""DOUCE"" -> E -> invalid.\n        ""FOCUS"" -> S -> invalid.\n        ""LOCUS"" -> S -> invalid.\n        ""VOCAL"" -> A -> invalid.\n\n        ""YOCKS"" -> S -> invalid.\n\n        ""BOCKS"" -> S -> invalid.\n\n        ""LOCKO"" -> not a word.\n\n        ""BLOCK"" is invalid because O is in position 3.\n\n        How about ""DOCKS"" -> has S -> invalid.\n\n        ""HOCKS"" -> S -> invalid.\n\n        ""POCKS"" -> S -> invalid.\n\n        ""WOCK"" -> too short.\n\n   This is difficult.\n\n   Put O in position 2 and C in position 3:\n        Word: _ O C _ _\n        Example: ""FOCUS"" -> S -> invalid.\n        ""LOCUS"" -> S -> invalid.\n        ""COCKS"" -> has S -> invalid.\n        ""DOCKS"" -> S -> invalid.\n        ""HOCKS"" -> S -> invalid.\n        ""POCKS"" -> S -> invalid.\n\n        ""YOCKS"" -> S -> invalid.\n\n        ""BLOCK"" -> O is in position 3 -> invalid.\n\n        How about ""COUCH"" -> has U, C, H -> but C is in position 2 and 4? We are putting C in position 3? \n            ""COUCH"": C(1), O(2), U(3), C(4), H(5) -> but we are trying to put C in position 3? Actually, in ""COUCH"", the first C is position 1, which we know is not correct, and the third letter is U, and then C in position 4. But we are trying to test C in position 3? \n            However, we are putting O in position 2 and C in position 3? In ""COUCH"", O is in position 2, but then we have C in position 1 (which we know is wrong) and then U and H. So we cannot use C in position 1.\n\n        We need a word that has C in position 3 and O in position 2. But ""COUCH"" has C in position 1 and 4, not 3.\n\n        How about ""DOUCE"" -> E -> invalid.\n\n        ""FOCUS"" -> S -> invalid.\n\n        ""LOCUM"" -> but then O is in position 2, C in position 3? \n            ""LOCUM"": L(1), O(2), C(3), U(4), M(5). This avoids the excluded letters. And we are testing L, O, C, U, M. \n            But note: we are putting O in position 2 and C in position 3. This is acceptable because we haven\'t tested O in position 2 and C in position 3.\n\n            Is ""LOCUM"" a word? Yes, meaning a place or a thing.\n\n            And it avoids R, A, N, E, S, T, I.\n\n            So ""LOCUM"" is a candidate.\n\n   So we have a candidate: ""LOCUM""\n\n   But let\'s check the positions:\n        L in position 1: we don\'t know.\n        O in position 2: we are testing O in position 2.\n        C in position 3: we are testing C in position 3.\n        U in position 4: we don\'t know.\n        M in position 5: we don\'t know.\n\n   This seems like a good test.\n\n   But note: we are putting O in position 2. We don\'t know if O is in position 2. Similarly, C in position 3 is new.\n\n   We also test L, U, M.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try ""LOCUS"" but it has S -> invalid.\n\n   Another candidate: ""DOCKS"" is invalid because of S.\n\n   How about ""FOCUS"" -> invalid.\n\n   ""LOCUM"" seems acceptable.\n\n   But we have to consider that we are putting C in position 3. We know C is not in position 1 or 5, but position 3 is possible.\n\n   Another candidate: ""MUCUS"" -> has S -> invalid.\n\n   ""FACET"" -> invalid.\n\n   ""PICO"" -> too short.\n\n   ""CLOCUS"" -> has S -> invalid.\n\n   So ""LOCUM"" is a candidate.\n\n   But let me see if there\'s a better one.\n\n   How about ""BOCCE"" -> has E -> invalid.\n\n   ""COWPS"" -> has S -> invalid.\n\n   ""HOWFC"" -> not a word.\n\n   ""JUMBO"" -> no C.\n\n   We need C.\n\n   Another idea: put O in position 4 and C in position 2? \n        Word: _ C _ O _\n        Example: ""SCOWL"" -> S -> invalid.\n        ""ACOWP"" -> A and S excluded -> invalid.\n\n        ""OCULI"" -> I -> invalid.\n\n        ""OCHER"" -> invalid.\n\n        ""OCTAD"" -> T excluded.\n\n        ""OCTYL"" -> T excluded.\n\n        ""OCHOS"" -> S -> invalid.\n\n        ""OCHRY"" -> R -> invalid.\n\n        ""OCHUM"" -> not common.\n\n        ""LOCUM"" is one of the few options.\n\n   Or put O in position 5 and C in position 2: \n        Word: _ C _ _ O\n        Example: ""SCALO"" -> A and S -> invalid.\n        ""FOCUS"" -> S -> invalid.\n        ""DOCKO"" -> has O in position 5?

And it has P, U, C, O. But we don\'t know about P, U. And it avoids excluded letters? \n            P, U, P, C, O -> duplicate P? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. We can try, but let\'s avoid for now.\n\n        ""PUPCO"" is not standard.\n\n   After some research, ""LOCUM"" seems to be a valid word and meets the criteria.\n\n   But let me confirm: \n        L: not excluded -> okay.\n        O: we are testing in position 2 -> okay.\n        C: we are testing in position 3 -> okay.\n        U: not excluded -> okay.\n        M: not excluded -> okay.\n\n   And it avoids R, A, N, E, S, T, I.\n\n   So I think ""LOCUM"" is a good guess.\n\n   But note: we are putting O in position 2 and C in position 3. We know O is not in position 3, but position 2 is untested. Similarly, C is not in 1 or 5, so position 3 is untested.\n\n   We also test L, U, M.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try ""COUCH"" but that has C in position 1 (which we know is wrong) and O in position 2. But we cannot use C in position 1. So that\'s out.\n\n   Another candidate: ""DOUCE"" -> has E -> invalid.\n\n   ""LOCUM"" seems best.\n\n   But wait, what about ""CLOMP""? We cannot because C is in position 1.\n\n   How about ""CLOPS""? C in position 1 -> invalid.\n\n   We must avoid position 1 for C.\n\n   So ""LOCUM"" is a good choice.\n\n   But let me see if there\'s a word that has O in position 4 and C in position 2? \n        Word: _ C _ O _\n        Example: ""SCOWL"" -> S -> invalid.\n        ""ACOWP"" -> A and S excluded -> invalid.\n\n        ""OCULI"" -> I -> invalid.\n\n        ""OCHER"" -> invalid.\n\n        ""OCTAD"" -> T excluded.\n\n        ""OCTYL"" -> T excluded.\n\n        ""OCHOS"" -> S -> invalid.\n\n        ""OCHRY"" -> R -> invalid.\n\n        ""OCHUM"" -> not common.\n\n        ""LOCUM"" is one of the few.\n\n   Or ""CUMIN"" -> has N -> invalid.\n\n   Another: ""CUMUL"" -> not common.\n\n   So I think ""LOCUM"" is a reasonable choice.\n\n   But note: we are putting C in position 3. We know that C is not in position 1 or 5, but position 3 is possible.\n\n   We\'ll go with ""LOCUM"".\n\n   So the guess is ""LOCUM"".\n\n   Format: <guess>locum</guess>\n\n   But let me double-check the word: L-O-C-U-M.\n\n   Positions:\n        1: L -> test L\n        2: O -> test O in position 2\n        3: C -> test C in position 3\n        4: U -> test U\n        5: M -> test M\n\n   This will give us information about the positions of C and O, and also about L, U, M.\n\n   If we get a match for O in position 2, that would be great. But if not, we know O is not in position 2.\n\n   Similarly for C in position 3.\n\n   And we test L, U, M.\n\n   So it\'s informative.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try a word that has O in position 4 and C in position 2? \n        Word: _ C _ O _\n        Example: ""SCOWL"" -> S -> invalid.\n        ""ACOWP"" -> A and S excluded -> invalid.\n\n        ""OCULI"" -> I -> invalid.\n\n        ""OCHER"" -> invalid.\n\n        ""OCTAD"" -> T excluded.\n\n        ""OCTYL"" -> T excluded.\n\n        ""OCHOS"" -> S -> invalid.\n\n        ""OCHRY"" -> R -> invalid.\n\n        ""OCHUM"" -> not common.\n\n        ""LOCUM"" is the only common word I can think of for this pattern.\n\n   Or ""CLOPS"" -> C in position 1 -> invalid.\n\n   So I think ""LOCUM"" is the best.\n\n   Therefore, we guess ""LOCUM"".\n\n   But note: we are putting O in position 2 and C in position 3. We know that O is not in position 3, but position 2 is new. C is not in position 1 or 5, so position 3 is new.\n\n   We\'ll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **C** is in the word but not in positions 1 or 5 (from ""crane"" and ""stoic"" feedback).\n- **O** is in the word but not in position 3 (from ""stoic"" feedback).\n- Absent letters: R, A, N, E, S, T, I (cannot be used).\n- Present letters: C and O must be included, with C in positions 2, 3, or 4 and O in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nFor the next guess, I chose ""locum"" because:\n- It includes both required letters (**C** and **O**) in untested positions: **C** in position 3 and **O** in position 2.\n- It avoids all absent letters (R, A, N, E, S, T, I).\n- It tests new common letters (L, U, M) to gather more information.\n- The word is valid and helps narrow down positions for C and O while covering frequent consonants.\n\n<guess>locum</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: stoic -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(-) I(x) C(-)\nGuess 3: locum -> FEEDBACK: L(x) O(✓) C(✓) U(x) M(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(-), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x)
  - C is present but not in position 1.
  - R, A, N, E are absent.

Guess 2: ""stoic"" -> S(x), T(x), O(-), I(x), C(-)
  - S, T, I are absent.
  - O is present but not in position 3.
  - C is present but not in position 5.

Guess 3: ""locum"" -> L(x), O(✓), C(✓), U(x), M(x)
  - L, U, M are absent.
  - O is correct in position 2 (so the secret word has O in the second position).
  - C is correct in position 3 (so the secret word has C in the third position).

So now we know:
- The secret word has O in position 2 and C in position 3.
- Therefore, the word is of the form: _ O C _ _
- We also know that the letters R, A, N, E, S, T, I, L, U, M are absent.

Additionally, from guess 1, we know that C is present (now we know it's in position 3) and from guess 2, we know O is present (now we know it's in position 2).

We need to find a word that fits: _ O C _ _

And the absent letters are: R, A, N, E, S, T, I, L, U, M.

So the available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, K, P, V, W, Y, and possibly others not excluded.

We have to fill the first and last two positions.

The word must be: [letter1] O C [letter4] [letter5]

We know that letter1, letter4, letter5 must be from the available set and form a valid English word.

We also know that the word must have exactly these letters? Not necessarily, because we might have duplicates? But so far, we haven't encountered duplicates. However, we cannot rule out duplicates, but since we have O and C already, and they are in positions 2 and 3, the other letters must be distinct.

But note: in ""locum"", we had O and C correct, and L, U, M absent. So the word has O in 2, C in 3, and the other three letters are from the available set and not in the absent list.

Now, we need to guess a word that fits the pattern and uses available letters.

Let's list possible words:

We need words of the form: ? O C ? ?

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, P, V, W, Y, and possibly others. But note: we have excluded: R, A, N, E, S, T, I, L, U, M.

So available: B, D, F, G, H, K, P, V, W, Y.

Now, common words that fit ? O C ? ?:

- BLOCK: but B is available, but we have to check the last two. ""BLOCK"" has B, L, O, C, K -> but L is absent (from guess 3, L is x). So invalid.

- CLOMP: C is in position 1? We cannot, and also M and P are available, but C is in position 1 -> invalid.

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 04 Sep 2025

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: - (meaning C is in the secret word but in the wrong position)
 R: x (R is not in the secret word)
 A: x (A is not in the secret word)
 N: x (N is not in the secret word)
 E: x (E is not in the secret word)

 So, from this feedback, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letter 'C', but not in the first position (since in ""crane"", C is the first letter and it's marked as wrong position).
 - The letters R, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word has the letter 'C' in one of the positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (since it's not in position 1).

 Also, we know that the secret word does not contain: R, A, N, E.

 Since we have only one letter that is present ('C'), we need to choose a new word that:
 1. Includes the letter 'C' (but not in the first position, because in the first guess it was in the first position and was wrong).
 2. Avoids the letters R, A, N, E.

 Additionally, we want to maximize information by including other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 Let's think of common letters that are not R, A, N, E. Some common letters are: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

 We also note that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

 We can try to put 'C' in a different position. Since it was in position 1 and was wrong, we can try position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

 However, we don't know which position is correct. So we might want to try a word that has 'C' in a different position and also includes other common letters.

 Let's consider the following: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to try more letters.

 A good strategy is to use a word that has 'C' and four other new letters (that are common and not in the set {R, A, N, E}).

 We can try to use the letter 'S' which is very common. Also, we can try 'T', 'L', 'O', etc.

 Let's try to form a word that has 'C' and avoids R, A, N, E.

 Example words:
 - Could we use ""CLOUT""? But that has O and U, and T and L. However, we don't know if O, U, T, L are in the word.
 - Another idea: ""SCALP"" but that has S, C, A (but A is already excluded) -> so we cannot use A.

 We must avoid A, so let's avoid vowels for now? But we know the word has at least one vowel? Actually, we don't know, but commonly words have vowels.

 We have to use a word without A, E, and also without R, N.

 Let's think of words that have 'C' and without R, A, N, E.

 Possibilities: 
 - ""C"" in position 2: words like ?C??? 
   Example: ""SCULP"" (not common) or ""SCUFF"" (but has two F's and we don't know about F) -> not ideal for information.
 - ""C"" in position 3: ??C?? 
   Example: ""FANCY"" -> but has A (excluded) and N (excluded). So invalid.
 - ""C"" in position 4: ???C?
   Example: ""TOPIC"" -> has O, P, I, C. But we don't know about O, P, I. Also, we can use this.

 However, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Another idea: ""CLOMP"" -> but has O, M, P. But we don't know about O, M, P. Also, we avoid R, A, N, E.

 But note: we have to avoid R, A, N, E. So ""CLOMP"" is acceptable? Let's check: C is in position 1? We want to avoid position 1 for C? Actually, we can put C in any position except 1? But wait, the feedback said C is in the word but not in position 1. So we can try position 1 again? Actually, no, because the feedback said it's in the wrong position, so we know it's not in position 1. So we should avoid putting C in position 1 again.

 But note: the feedback only said that in the first guess, C was in position 1 and it was wrong. It doesn't say that the secret word has C in position 1? Actually, no: the feedback for C was (-) meaning it is in the word but not in position 1. So the secret word has a C, but not at position 1. Therefore, we can try C in positions 2,3,4,5.

 However, we are allowed to put C in position 1 again? But that would be redundant and we know it's not there. So we should avoid position 1 for C.

 So for the next guess, we should put C in one of positions 2,3,4,5.

 Let's try to form a word that has C in position 2: 
   _ C _ _ _

 We need to fill the blanks with letters that are not R, A, N, E.

 Common letters: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

 Example: ""SCULP"" (not common) -> let's think of more common words.

 How about ""SCHOL""? But that has S, C, H, O, L. But we don't know about S, H, O, L. Also, it's a valid word? Yes, meaning a school or a student.

 But note: we have to avoid R, A, N, E. ""SCHOL"" doesn't have any of these.

 Alternatively, ""CLOMP"" has C in position 1? We cannot put C in position 1. So we need a word that has C in position 2 or later.

 Let me try to list words with C in position 2: 
   Position 1: any letter except R, A, N, E, and also not C (because we are putting C in position 2) -> so we can use other consonants or vowels (but vowels: O, I, U are available, but we know the word must have at least one vowel? Actually, we don't know about vowels because we only know about A and E being absent. But the word might have I, O, U, or even Y?).

 Example: ""SCALY"" -> but has A (excluded) and L, Y. But A is excluded -> so invalid.
   ""SCOWL"" -> has O, W, L. But W is less common. And we don't know about O, W, L. Also, no excluded letters.

 But we can use ""SCOWL"". However, we have to consider that we are only on the second guess, so we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Another word: ""SCUBA"" -> has A (excluded) -> invalid.

 How about ""SCION""? -> has I, O, N -> but N is excluded! We cannot use N.

 So we must avoid N.

 Therefore, ""SCION"" is invalid because of N.

 Let me try ""SCUFF"" -> has U, F, F. But F is not very common. And we have two F's? We don't know if F is in the word.

 Alternatively, we can try C in position 3: 
   _ _ C _ _

 Example: ""FICUS"" -> has F, I, C, U, S. But F is not very common. And we have to avoid R, A, N, E -> which we are. But we can do better.

 How about ""MUSIC"" -> has M, U, S, I, C. But C is at the end (position 5). Also, we avoid R, A, N, E.

 But note: we have to avoid using the same letter twice? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But we can try.

 However, we are trying to get information. Using ""MUSIC"" would use M, U, S, I, C. That's five new letters (except C which we know is present). And we are putting C at the end.

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess told us that C is in the word but not in position 1. So if we put C in position 5, that's a new position.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PICKS"" -> but has S, I, C, K, S. But we don't know about P, I, K, S. However, we have two S's? And we are avoiding R, A, N, E.

 But we can also consider words that have C in position 4: 
   _ _ _ C _

 Example: ""TOPIC"" -> T, O, P, I, C. This avoids R, A, N, E. And we haven't tried T, O, P, I.

 But note: we are allowed to use T, O, P, I? Yes, because they are not excluded.

 However, we must avoid using letters that we know are absent: R, A, N, E.

 So ""TOPIC"" is a valid word and uses T, O, P, I, C.

 But we also want to cover more common consonants. Let's see the frequency of letters.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CLOMP"" but that has C in position 1? We cannot do that because we know C is not in position 1. So we must avoid position 1 for C.

 Therefore, we cannot use words that start with C.

 So let's try ""CLOMP"" is invalid because it has C in position 1.

 How about ""MUCKY""? -> but Y is less common.

 Another idea: ""PITCH"" -> has P, I, T, C, H. C is in position 4. This avoids R, A, N, E. And we get to test P, I, T, C, H.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has H or not. But that's the point of guessing.

 Alternatively, ""C"" in position 5: 
   _ _ _ _ C

 Example: ""MANIC"" -> has A (excluded) and N (excluded) -> invalid.
   ""TOPIC"" -> we considered that, but it has C at the end.

 However, ""TOPIC"" has C at the end. We can use that.

 But let me check: the word ""TOPIC"" is valid.

 However, we can also try ""CLOPS"" -> but that has C in position 1? No, we cannot. So we must avoid C in position 1.

 Therefore, we can use words that have C in positions 2,3,4,5.

 Let me try to find a word that has C in position 2 and uses common letters: 
   Position 1: not C, and not R, A, N, E -> so we can use S, T, L, O, I, etc.
   Position 2: C
   Positions 3,4,5: other letters.

 Example: ""SCULP"" (not common) -> let's try ""SCUFF"" but that has two F's and is not very common.

 Another: ""SCHOL"" (as I thought earlier) -> S, C, H, O, L. This is a valid word. And we avoid R, A, N, E.

 But we can also try ""SLOTH"" -> but no C? We must include C because we know it's in the word. So we have to include C.

 So we must have C in the word.

 Therefore, let's choose between:
   Option 1: ""SCHOL"" (C in position 2) -> letters: S, C, H, O, L.
   Option 2: ""TOPIC"" (C in position 5) -> letters: T, O, P, I, C.

 Which one is better? 
   We want to cover more common letters. The frequency of letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... (but we have excluded A, E, R, N). So the most common left are T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U.

   ""TOPIC"" has T, O, P, I, C -> that's T, O, P, I, and C (which we know is present). 
   ""SCHOL"" has S, C, H, O, L -> S, H, O, L.

   The set of letters in ""TOPIC"" includes T, O, P, I, C. 
   The set of letters in ""SCHOL"" includes S, C, H, O, L.

   The frequency of T, O, P, I is higher than S, H, O, L? 
     T is very common, O is common, P is common, I is common. 
     S is also common, H is common, O is common, L is common.

   But note: we already know that the word has C, so we are testing 4 new letters in both.

   However, we have two options. We can choose either.

   But we can also consider ""CLOTH"" -> but C is in position 1? We cannot use that.

   How about ""SHOCK""? -> has S, H, O, C, K. C is in position 4. This avoids R, A, N, E. And we test S, H, O, C, K.

   This seems good because K is also common.

   But we have to choose one.

   Alternatively, ""CHOMP"" -> but C is in position 1? We cannot use that.

   So let's avoid position 1 for C.

   After considering, I think ""SHOCK"" is a good candidate: 
        S H O C K

   But note: we are putting C in position 4. We know C is in the word, but we don't know where. So position 4 is a good candidate?

   However, we don't know. We are trying to cover multiple positions.

   Another candidate: ""BLOCK"" -> but has B, L, O, C, K. But we don't know about B, L, O, K. And we avoid R, A, N, E. But note: we have to avoid using letters that are not in the word? We are allowed to use any letters, even if they are not present, to test.

   But we are only interested in letters that might be present.

   However, we already know that the word has C, so we should focus on other letters.

   Let me compare:

   ""SHOCK"": tests S, H, O, C, K. We know C is present, so we are testing S, H, O, K.
   ""BLOCK"": tests B, L, O, C, K. But note: we are putting C in position 4. Also, we avoid R, A, N, E.

   But we don't know if the word has O or not. Similarly for the others.

   We want to maximize the chance of getting more feedback.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has the letter 'S' because it's very common.

   How about ""SCOLD""? -> has S, C, O, L, but the word is ""SCOLD"". This avoids R, A, N, E. And C is in position 2.

   But we are putting C in position 2. This is a new position.

   Let me check: 
      Position 1: S
      Position 2: C
      Position 3: O
      Position 4: L
      Position 5: D

   This word: ""SCOLD"" -> S, C, O, L, D.

   We haven't tried S, O, L, D. And we know C is present.

   But note: we are not sure if the word has O or not. We are testing.

   Another common word: ""CLOCK"" -> but C is in position 1? We cannot use that.

   So ""SCOLD"" is a valid word.

   But we have to consider that we are using D. Alternatively, we can use ""SCULP"" but that's not common.

   Let me choose ""SCOLD"" because it uses common letters and we avoid the excluded ones.

   However, we have to make sure we don't use any of the excluded letters: R, A, N, E. ""SCOLD"" doesn't have any of these.

   So I will go with ""SCOLD"".

   But wait: what if the secret word has C in position 2? Then we get a match. But if not, we get feedback on S, C, O, L, D.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has C in a position that we haven't tried? Actually, in the first guess, we tried C in position 1. Now we are trying C in position 2. If we get a match in position 2, then we know. If not, we know that C is not in position 2 and we can try other positions.

   But we have 5 positions. We can try to cover multiple positions? Actually, we are doing that.

   However, we have only one known letter (C) and we are testing it in a new position.

   Let me decide: 

   Option 1: ""SCOLD"" -> tests S, C (in pos2), O, L, D.
   Option 2: ""TOPIC"" -> tests T, O, P, I, C (in pos5). 

   Both are good. But ""TOPIC"" has the advantage of having two vowels (O and I) which might be useful.

   But note: we already know that the word doesn't have A and E, so the vowels must be among I, O, U, and possibly Y.

   We haven't tested O, I, U. So testing two vowels at once might be efficient.

   Also, ""TOPIC"" has T and P which are common.

   So I think ""TOPIC"" is a good choice.

   But wait: we are putting C in position 5. We know C is in the word, but we don't know if it's in position 5. So we are testing that.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has C in a position that we haven't tried and also includes more common letters.

   After consideration, I think ""TOPIC"" is a good choice.

   So I will go with ""TOPIC"".

   But let me check: the word ""TOPIC"" is valid.

   Therefore, my second guess is ""TOPIC"".

   We are hoping to get feedback on T, O, P, I, and also on C (we know it will be either correct or present? Actually, we know it's present, so we expect either:
        - If the word has C in position 5: then we get C as correct (✓) and then we know the last letter is C.
        - Otherwise, we get C as (-) meaning it's in another position.

   But we are also testing T, O, P, I.

   So we will get information about these.

   Let me write the guess: TOPIC

   But note: we are not sure if the word has O or I. But that's the point.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has the letter 'S' because it's very common. 

   How about ""COSTS""? -> but C is in position 1? We cannot use that.

   How about ""SCOWL""? -> C in position 2. But we are avoiding R, A, N, E -> and it has W and L. W is less common. But it's acceptable.

   But we can do better: ""SCOWL"" is not as common.

   Another: ""STOIC"" -> has S, T, O, I, C. C is in position 5. This is a valid word. And we avoid R, A, N, E.

   ""STOIC"" is a common word.

   So between ""TOPIC"" and ""STOIC"", which one? 
        ""TOPIC"": T, O, P, I, C
        ""STOIC"": S, T, O, I, C

   Both are good. But ""STOIC"" has S which is very common. And we haven't tested S.

   So I think ""STOIC"" is a good choice.

   But note: we are putting C in position 5 in both. We don't know if that's correct.

   However, we are also testing S, T, O, I.

   Let me choose ""STOIC"".

   So my second guess: STOIC

   But wait: we are putting C in position 5. We know C is in the word, but we don't know if it's in position 5. So we are testing that.

   Alternatively, we can try to put C in a position that we haven't tested? Actually, we only tested position 1. So positions 2,3,4,5 are untested for C.

   We can choose any of 2,3,4,5. 

   I think ""STOIC"" is a good choice.

   So I'll go with ""STOIC"".

   But note: we are also testing S, T, O, I. And we know C is present.

   Therefore, I choose ""STOIC"".

   So the guess is ""stoic"".

   But let me confirm: 
        S: we don't know -> we are testing S.
        T: testing T.
        O: testing O.
        I: testing I.
        C: we know is present, so we are testing if it's in position 5.

   This will give us good information.

   So the word is ""STOIC"".

   We'll guess ""STOIC"".

   If the feedback for C is (-) then we know C is not in position 5, so it must be in 2,3, or 4.

   And we get information about S, T, O, I.

   So let's do that.

   Guess: stoic

   Format: <guess>stoic</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is present but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R, A, N, E are absent from the secret word.

For the next guess, I need to:
1. Include the letter ""C"" in a position other than 1 (since it was incorrect there).
2. Avoid using R, A, N, E.
3. Test new common letters to gather more information.

I chose ""stoic"" because:
- It places ""C"" in position 5 (a new position to test).
- It avoids excluded letters (R, A, N, E).
- It introduces four new common letters: S, T, O, I.
- The word is valid and balances vowel/consonant testing (O and I are vowels).

This guess will help identify the position of ""C"" and test for the presence of S, T, O, I.

<guess>stoic</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: stoic -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(-) I(x) C(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(-), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""stoic"" -> S(x), T(x), O(-), I(x), C(-)
Meaning:
- S is not in the word.
- T is not in the word.
- O is in the word but not in position 3 (since in ""stoic"", O is the third letter).
- I is not in the word.
- C is in the word but not in position 5 (since in ""stoic"", C is the fifth letter).

So, combining the information:

Letters known to be absent: R, A, N, E, S, T, I
Letters known to be present: C and O

For C:
- It is not in position 1 (from guess 1) and not in position 5 (from guess 2). So it must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

For O:
- It is in the word but not in position 3 (from guess 2). So it could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We also know that the secret word has exactly 5 letters, and we have two known letters: C and O. But there are three more letters we don't know.

We need to avoid the absent letters: R, A, N, E, S, T, I.

Available letters: We can use any letter except the absent ones. Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We have 4 more guesses (since we used 2, and we have 6 total).

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Contains C and O (both must be present, but we don't know their positions yet).
- Does not contain R, A, N, E, S, T, I.
- We can use other letters from the available set.

We also want to test new common letters to get more information.

Let's think about the positions for C and O:

- C must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- O must not be in position 3 (from the feedback of ""stoic""), so O can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

But note: we don't know if there are duplicate letters. However, we haven't encountered any duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates for now.

We need to choose a word that has both C and O, and three other letters that are not in the absent list.

We also want to cover common letters that we haven't tested. The remaining common letters include: L, H, D, M, P, U, B, G, etc.

Let's try to form words:

Option 1: Put O in position 1 and C in position 2? 
   Word: O _ C _ _
   We need to fill the blanks. Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

   Example: ""OCCUR"" -> but has two C's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but we can try. However, we have only one C known so far, and if we use two C's, we might get confused. Also, ""OCCUR"" has U and R (R is excluded) -> invalid.

   ""OCHRE"" -> has R and E (excluded) -> invalid.

   ""OCLAD"" -> not a common word.

   ""OCHIN"" -> not common.

   ""OCHRE"" is invalid.

   How about ""OCHER""? -> has E and R -> invalid.

   This is difficult.

Option 2: Put O in position 1 and C in position 3?
   Word: O _ C _ _
   Example: ""OUPHE"" -> not common and has E.

   ""OCTAL"" -> has T (excluded) -> invalid.

   ""OCCAM"" -> has A (excluded) -> invalid.

   ""OCHER"" -> invalid.

   Not many common words.

Option 3: Put O in position 1 and C in position 4?
   Word: O _ _ C _
   Example: ""OPERA"" -> has E and R -> invalid.
   ""OBIIT"" -> not common and has I (excluded) -> invalid.

   ""OCTAD"" -> has T -> invalid.

   ""OCHOS"" -> has S -> invalid.

   Still difficult.

Option 4: Put O in position 2 and C in position 3?
   Word: _ O C _ _
   Example: ""FOCUS"" -> has F, O, C, U, S -> but S is excluded -> invalid.
   ""LOCUS"" -> has L, O, C, U, S -> S excluded -> invalid.
   ""DOCKS"" -> has S -> invalid.

   We need to avoid S.

   ""BLOCK"" -> has B, L, O, C, K -> but we don't know about B, L, K. And S is not in it. But we have to avoid T? ""BLOCK"" has no T, but it has B, L, O, C, K. However, we have to check if any of these are excluded? We haven't excluded B, L, K. And O and C are included.

   But note: we are putting O in position 3? In ""BLOCK"", O is in position 3? But we know from guess 2 that O is not in position 3? Actually, the feedback for ""stoic"" said O is in the word but not in position 3. So we cannot put O in position 3 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not there. So we should avoid position 3 for O.

   In ""BLOCK"", O is in position 3? Let's see:
        B L O C K -> positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:O, 4:C, 5:K -> so O is in 3, which we know is wrong. So we should avoid that.

   We must avoid putting O in position 3 because we already know it's not there.

   So for the pattern _ O C _ _, we would have O in position 2 and C in position 3. Then we need to fill the first and last positions.

   Example: ""DOCKS"" -> has S -> invalid.

   ""FOCUS"" -> has S -> invalid.

   ""LOCUM"" -> has U, M, but no C? We need C. ""LOCUM"" is L, O, C, U, M -> but that's 5 letters? L O C U M -> positions: 1:L, 2:O, 3:C, 4:U, 5:M. But we are putting O in position 2 and C in position 3. This is acceptable? But we don't know if O can be in position 2? We haven't tested O in position 2.

   However, we know O is not in position 3, but position 2 is untested.

   But ""LOCUM"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning a place or a thing.

   But we have to avoid S, T, I, etc. ""LOCUM"" has L, O, C, U, M -> no S, T, I, R, A, N, E. So it's acceptable.

   But we are putting C in position 3. We know C is not in position 1 or 5, but position 3 is untested.

   However, we are also putting O in position 2. We don't know if O is in position 2.

   But note: we are testing two new positions for C and O.

   Alternatively, we can try to put C in position 2 and O in position 4? 
        Word: _ C _ O _
        Example: ""SCOWL"" -> but S is excluded -> invalid.
        ""ACORN"" -> A and R excluded -> invalid.

   ""OCULI"" -> has I -> invalid.

   ""OCHER"" -> invalid.

   This is challenging.

   Let me try putting O in position 4 and C in position 2:
        Word: _ C _ O _
        Example: ""CLOAK"" -> has A -> invalid.
        ""CROOK"" -> has R -> invalid.
        ""DUCAT"" -> has T -> invalid.

   Not working.

   Put O in position 5 and C in position 3?
        Word: _ _ C _ O
        Example: ""MANCO"" -> has A and N -> invalid.
        ""FICUS"" -> has I and S -> invalid.

   ""MUCRO"" -> has U, C, R, O -> R excluded -> invalid.

   ""MACHO"" -> has A -> invalid.

   This is difficult.

   Put O in position 1 and C in position 4:
        Word: O _ _ C _
        Example: ""OPIUM"" -> has I and U? But I is excluded. -> invalid.
        ""OCTYL"" -> has T and Y, L -> but T excluded -> invalid.

   ""OCHER"" -> invalid.

   Put O in position 2 and C in position 4:
        Word: _ O _ C _
        Example: ""BLOCK"" -> we already considered, but O is in position 3? In ""BLOCK"": B(1), L(2), O(3), C(4), K(5) -> so O is in 3, which we know is wrong. So we cannot use that.

   We must avoid position 3 for O.

   So for _ O _ C _, we need O in position 2 and C in position 4. Then the third position must be filled.

   Example: ""DOUCE"" -> has E -> invalid.
        ""FOCUS"" -> has S -> invalid.

   ""LOCUS"" -> has S -> invalid.

   ""VOCAL"" -> has A -> invalid.

   ""YOCKS"" -> has S -> invalid.

   Not working.

   Put O in position 4 and C in position 2:
        Word: _ C _ O _
        Example: ""SCOWL"" -> S excluded -> invalid.
        ""ACROW"" -> A and R excluded -> invalid.

   ""OCULI"" -> has I -> invalid.

   This is difficult.

   Put O in position 5 and C in position 3:
        Word: _ _ C _ O
        Example: ""MANCO"" -> A and N excluded -> invalid.
        ""FICUS"" -> I and S excluded -> invalid.

   ""MUCRO"" -> R excluded -> invalid.

   ""MACHO"" -> A excluded -> invalid.

   Given the difficulty, let's consider putting C in position 2 and O in position 4? 
        Word: _ C _ O _
        But we need to fill position 1, 3, and 5.

        Example: ""CLOAK"" -> A excluded -> invalid.
        ""CROCK"" -> R and C (duplicate?) -> but we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, R excluded -> invalid.

        ""DUCAT"" -> T excluded -> invalid.

        ""FACET"" -> A, E, T excluded -> invalid.

        ""PILOT"" -> has I and T -> invalid.

        ""MUCOR"" -> R excluded -> invalid.

        ""MYCO"" -> too short? 5 letters? ""MYCOS"" -> has S -> invalid.

        ""YCLAD"" -> not common.

   This is not working.

   Let me try putting C in position 4 and O in position 1? 
        Word: O _ _ C _
        Example: ""OBIIT"" -> has I -> invalid.
        ""OCHER"" -> invalid.

        ""OCTYL"" -> T excluded -> invalid.

        ""OUPHE"" -> E -> invalid.

        ""OUMAS"" -> has S -> invalid.

        ""OUMA"" -> too short.

   Not working.

   Put O in position 1 and C in position 3:
        Word: O _ C _ _
        Example: ""OCCUR"" -> has R -> invalid.
        ""OCHER"" -> invalid.

        ""OCTAD"" -> T excluded -> invalid.

        ""OCTYL"" -> T excluded -> invalid.

        ""OCHOS"" -> S excluded -> invalid.

        ""OCHRE"" -> E and R excluded -> invalid.

   This is difficult.

   Put O in position 1 and C in position 4:
        Word: O _ _ C _
        Example: ""OPERA"" -> E and R -> invalid.
        ""OBIIT"" -> I -> invalid.
        ""OCTAD"" -> T excluded -> invalid.

        ""OCHER"" -> invalid.

        ""OUMAS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""OUMA"" -> too short.

   Not working.

   Put O in position 1 and C in position 5: 
        Word: O _ _ _ C
        Example: ""OPING"" -> not a word? 
        ""OUBIT"" -> has I -> invalid.
        ""OCTIC"" -> T excluded -> invalid.

        ""OCHRE"" -> E and R -> invalid.

        ""OCHOS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""OCHRY"" -> R -> invalid.

        ""OCHUM"" -> U, M -> but ""OCHUM"" is not common? And we have to avoid R? It doesn't have R, but has U and M. But is it a word? Not really.

        ""OCTYL"" -> T excluded.

   This is difficult.

   Put O in position 2 and C in position 4:
        Word: _ O _ C _
        Example: ""BLOCK"" -> O is in position 3? No, in ""BLOCK"": 
            Position 1: B, 2: L, 3: O, 4: C, 5: K -> so O is in 3, which we know is wrong. So we cannot use that.

        We need O in position 2 and C in position 4. So the word: 
            Position 1: ?
            Position 2: O
            Position 3: ? (must not be O, because then we have two O's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, we haven't seen O twice, so maybe the word has only one O? But we don't know. We can try a word with two O's? But we don't have evidence of duplicates.)

        Example: ""DOUCE"" -> E -> invalid.
        ""FOCUS"" -> S -> invalid.
        ""LOCUS"" -> S -> invalid.
        ""VOCAL"" -> A -> invalid.

        ""YOCKS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""BOCKS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""LOCKO"" -> not a word.

        ""BLOCK"" is invalid because O is in position 3.

        How about ""DOCKS"" -> has S -> invalid.

        ""HOCKS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""POCKS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""WOCK"" -> too short.

   This is difficult.

   Put O in position 2 and C in position 3:
        Word: _ O C _ _
        Example: ""FOCUS"" -> S -> invalid.
        ""LOCUS"" -> S -> invalid.
        ""COCKS"" -> has S -> invalid.
        ""DOCKS"" -> S -> invalid.
        ""HOCKS"" -> S -> invalid.
        ""POCKS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""YOCKS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""BLOCK"" -> O is in position 3 -> invalid.

        How about ""COUCH"" -> has U, C, H -> but C is in position 2 and 4? We are putting C in position 3? 
            ""COUCH"": C(1), O(2), U(3), C(4), H(5) -> but we are trying to put C in position 3? Actually, in ""COUCH"", the first C is position 1, which we know is not correct, and the third letter is U, and then C in position 4. But we are trying to test C in position 3? 
            However, we are putting O in position 2 and C in position 3? In ""COUCH"", O is in position 2, but then we have C in position 1 (which we know is wrong) and then U and H. So we cannot use C in position 1.

        We need a word that has C in position 3 and O in position 2. But ""COUCH"" has C in position 1 and 4, not 3.

        How about ""DOUCE"" -> E -> invalid.

        ""FOCUS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""LOCUM"" -> but then O is in position 2, C in position 3? 
            ""LOCUM"": L(1), O(2), C(3), U(4), M(5). This avoids the excluded letters. And we are testing L, O, C, U, M. 
            But note: we are putting O in position 2 and C in position 3. This is acceptable because we haven't tested O in position 2 and C in position 3.

            Is ""LOCUM"" a word? Yes, meaning a place or a thing.

            And it avoids R, A, N, E, S, T, I.

            So ""LOCUM"" is a candidate.

   So we have a candidate: ""LOCUM""

   But let's check the positions:
        L in position 1: we don't know.
        O in position 2: we are testing O in position 2.
        C in position 3: we are testing C in position 3.
        U in position 4: we don't know.
        M in position 5: we don't know.

   This seems like a good test.

   But note: we are putting O in position 2. We don't know if O is in position 2. Similarly, C in position 3 is new.

   We also test L, U, M.

   Alternatively, we can try ""LOCUS"" but it has S -> invalid.

   Another candidate: ""DOCKS"" is invalid because of S.

   How about ""FOCUS"" -> invalid.

   ""LOCUM"" seems acceptable.

   But we have to consider that we are putting C in position 3. We know C is not in position 1 or 5, but position 3 is possible.

   Another candidate: ""MUCUS"" -> has S -> invalid.

   ""FACET"" -> invalid.

   ""PICO"" -> too short.

   ""CLOCUS"" -> has S -> invalid.

   So ""LOCUM"" is a candidate.

   But let me see if there's a better one.

   How about ""BOCCE"" -> has E -> invalid.

   ""COWPS"" -> has S -> invalid.

   ""HOWFC"" -> not a word.

   ""JUMBO"" -> no C.

   We need C.

   Another idea: put O in position 4 and C in position 2? 
        Word: _ C _ O _
        Example: ""SCOWL"" -> S -> invalid.
        ""ACOWP"" -> A and S excluded -> invalid.

        ""OCULI"" -> I -> invalid.

        ""OCHER"" -> invalid.

        ""OCTAD"" -> T excluded.

        ""OCTYL"" -> T excluded.

        ""OCHOS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""OCHRY"" -> R -> invalid.

        ""OCHUM"" -> not common.

        ""LOCUM"" is one of the few options.

   Or put O in position 5 and C in position 2: 
        Word: _ C _ _ O
        Example: ""SCALO"" -> A and S -> invalid.
        ""FOCUS"" -> S -> invalid.
        ""DOCKO"" -> has O in position 5? But we are putting O in position 5, and C in position 2. But ""DOCKO"" is not a word.

        ""YCLAD"" -> not common.

        ""MUCRO"" -> R -> invalid.

        ""MUCOR"" -> R -> invalid.

        ""MUCID"" -> has I -> invalid.

        ""MUCUS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""CUMIN"" -> has N -> invalid.

        ""CUMUL"" -> not common.

        ""CUPRO"" -> R -> invalid.

        ""CUPSO"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""CUPID"" -> has I -> invalid.

        ""CUPRO"" -> R -> invalid.

        ""CUPSO"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""CABOC"" -> A -> invalid.

        ""CABOB"" -> A -> invalid.

        ""CACKO"" -> has A -> invalid.

        ""CACAO"" -> A -> invalid.

        ""CACTI"" -> A and I -> invalid.

        ""CACTI"" has A and I -> both excluded.

        ""CACTI"" is invalid.

        ""FACED"" -> A, E, D -> A and E excluded -> invalid.

        ""FACET"" -> A, E, T -> all excluded -> invalid.

        ""FICUS"" -> I, S -> invalid.

        ""FICUS"" is invalid.

        ""FUGUS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""HUMIC"" -> has I -> invalid.

        ""LUMPS"" -> has S -> invalid.

        ""MUCIC"" -> I -> invalid.

        ""MUCRO"" -> R -> invalid.

        ""MUCUS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""PULCO"" -> has U, L, C, O -> but ""PULCO"" is not common? And it has P, U, L, C, O. But we don't know about P, U, L. And it avoids the excluded letters? 
            P, U, L, C, O -> no R, A, N, E, S, T, I. So it's acceptable.

        ""PULCO"" is a word? I think it's a proper noun? Not common. Let me check: actually, ""pulco"" is not a standard word. 

        ""PULMO"" -> has M, O -> but no C? We need C.

        ""PULIS"" -> has S -> invalid.

        ""PULKA"" -> has A -> invalid.

        ""PULMO"" -> no C.

        ""PUMICE"" -> too long.

        ""PUMICE"" is 6 letters.

        ""PUMAS"" -> has A and S -> invalid.

        ""PUMBO"" -> has B, O -> but no C? We need C.

        ""PUMICE"" is 6 letters.

        ""PUNKO"" -> has U, N, K, O -> N excluded -> invalid.

        ""PUNKO"" has N -> invalid.

        ""PUPCO"" -> has U, P, C, O -> but ""PUPCO"" is not common? And it has P, U, C, O. But we don't know about P, U. And it avoids excluded letters? 
            P, U, P, C, O -> duplicate P? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. We can try, but let's avoid for now.

        ""PUPCO"" is not standard.

   After some research, ""LOCUM"" seems to be a valid word and meets the criteria.

   But let me confirm: 
        L: not excluded -> okay.
        O: we are testing in position 2 -> okay.
        C: we are testing in position 3 -> okay.
        U: not excluded -> okay.
        M: not excluded -> okay.

   And it avoids R, A, N, E, S, T, I.

   So I think ""LOCUM"" is a good guess.

   But note: we are putting O in position 2 and C in position 3. We know O is not in position 3, but position 2 is untested. Similarly, C is not in 1 or 5, so position 3 is untested.

   We also test L, U, M.

   Alternatively, we can try ""COUCH"" but that has C in position 1 (which we know is wrong) and O in position 2. But we cannot use C in position 1. So that's out.

   Another candidate: ""DOUCE"" -> has E -> invalid.

   ""LOCUM"" seems best.

   But wait, what about ""CLOMP""? We cannot because C is in position 1.

   How about ""CLOPS""? C in position 1 -> invalid.

   We must avoid position 1 for C.

   So ""LOCUM"" is a good choice.

   But let me see if there's a word that has O in position 4 and C in position 2? 
        Word: _ C _ O _
        Example: ""SCOWL"" -> S -> invalid.
        ""ACOWP"" -> A and S excluded -> invalid.

        ""OCULI"" -> I -> invalid.

        ""OCHER"" -> invalid.

        ""OCTAD"" -> T excluded.

        ""OCTYL"" -> T excluded.

        ""OCHOS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""OCHRY"" -> R -> invalid.

        ""OCHUM"" -> not common.

        ""LOCUM"" is one of the few.

   Or ""CUMIN"" -> has N -> invalid.

   Another: ""CUMUL"" -> not common.

   So I think ""LOCUM"" is a reasonable choice.

   But note: we are putting C in position 3. We know that C is not in position 1 or 5, but position 3 is possible.

   We'll go with ""LOCUM"".

   So the guess is ""LOCUM"".

   Format: <guess>locum</guess>

   But let me double-check the word: L-O-C-U-M.

   Positions:
        1: L -> test L
        2: O -> test O in position 2
        3: C -> test C in position 3
        4: U -> test U
        5: M -> test M

   This will give us information about the positions of C and O, and also about L, U, M.

   If we get a match for O in position 2, that would be great. But if not, we know O is not in position 2.

   Similarly for C in position 3.

   And we test L, U, M.

   So it's informative.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has O in position 4 and C in position 2? 
        Word: _ C _ O _
        Example: ""SCOWL"" -> S -> invalid.
        ""ACOWP"" -> A and S excluded -> invalid.

        ""OCULI"" -> I -> invalid.

        ""OCHER"" -> invalid.

        ""OCTAD"" -> T excluded.

        ""OCTYL"" -> T excluded.

        ""OCHOS"" -> S -> invalid.

        ""OCHRY"" -> R -> invalid.

        ""OCHUM"" -> not common.

        ""LOCUM"" is the only common word I can think of for this pattern.

   Or ""CLOPS"" -> C in position 1 -> invalid.

   So I think ""LOCUM"" is the best.

   Therefore, we guess ""LOCUM"".

   But note: we are putting O in position 2 and C in position 3. We know that O is not in position 3, but position 2 is new. C is not in position 1 or 5, so position 3 is new.

   We'll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **C** is in the word but not in positions 1 or 5 (from ""crane"" and ""stoic"" feedback).
- **O** is in the word but not in position 3 (from ""stoic"" feedback).
- Absent letters: R, A, N, E, S, T, I (cannot be used).
- Present letters: C and O must be included, with C in positions 2, 3, or 4 and O in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

For the next guess, I chose ""locum"" because:
- It includes both required letters (**C** and **O**) in untested positions: **C** in position 3 and **O** in position 2.
- It avoids all absent letters (R, A, N, E, S, T, I).
- It tests new common letters (L, U, M) to gather more information.
- The word is valid and helps narrow down positions for C and O while covering frequent consonants.

We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.\n A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.\n Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.\n I\'ll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.\n\n So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":\n C: - (meaning C is in the secret word but in the wrong position)\n R: x (R is not in the secret word)\n A: x (A is not in the secret word)\n N: x (N is not in the secret word)\n E: x (E is not in the secret word)\n\n So, from this feedback, we know:\n - The secret word contains the letter \'C\', but not in the first position (since in ""crane"", C is the first letter and it\'s marked as wrong position).\n - The letters R, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.\n\n Therefore, the secret word has the letter \'C\' in one of the positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (since it\'s not in position 1).\n\n Also, we know that the secret word does not contain: R, A, N, E.\n\n Since we have only one letter that is present (\'C\'), we need to choose a new word that:\n 1. Includes the letter \'C\' (but not in the first position, because in the first guess it was in the first position and was wrong).\n 2. Avoids the letters R, A, N, E.\n\n Additionally, we want to maximize information by including other common letters that we haven\'t tried yet.\n\n Let\'s think of common letters that are not R, A, N, E. Some common letters are: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.\n\n We also note that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.\n\n We can try to put \'C\' in a different position. Since it was in position 1 and was wrong, we can try position 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n However, we don\'t know which position is correct. So we might want to try a word that has \'C\' in a different position and also includes other common letters.\n\n Let\'s consider the following: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to try more letters.\n\n A good strategy is to use a word that has \'C\' and four other new letters (that are common and not in the set {R, A, N, E}).\n\n We can try to use the letter \'S\' which is very common. Also, we can try \'T\', \'L\', \'O\', etc.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that has \'C\' and avoids R, A, N, E.\n\n Example words:\n - Could we use ""CLOUT""? But that has O and U, and T and L. However, we don\'t know if O, U, T, L are in the word.\n - Another idea: ""SCALP"" but that has S, C, A (but A is already excluded) -> so we cannot use A.\n\n We must avoid A, so let\'s avoid vowels for now? But we know the word has at least one vowel? Actually, we don\'t know, but commonly words have vowels.\n\n We have to use a word without A, E, and also without R, N.\n\n Let\'s think of words that have \'C\' and without R, A, N, E.\n\n Possibilities: \n - ""C"" in position 2: words like ?C??? \n   Example: ""SCULP"" (not common) or ""SCUFF"" (but has two F\'s and we don\'t know about F) -> not ideal for information.\n - ""C"" in position 3: ??C?? \n   Example: ""FANCY"" -> but has A (excluded) and N (excluded). So invalid.\n - ""C"" in position 4: ???C?\n   Example: ""TOPIC"" -> has O, P, I, C. But we don\'t know about O, P, I. Also, we can use this.\n\n However, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\n Another idea: ""CLOMP"" -> but has O, M, P. But we don\'t know about O, M, P. Also, we avoid R, A, N, E.\n\n But note: we have to avoid R, A, N, E. So ""CLOMP"" is acceptable? Let\'s check: C is in position 1? We want to avoid position 1 for C? Actually, we can put C in any position except 1? But wait, the feedback said C is in the word but not in position 1. So we can try position 1 again? Actually, no, because the feedback said it\'s in the wrong position, so we know it\'s not in position 1. So we should avoid putting C in position 1 again.\n\n But note: the feedback only said that in the first guess, C was in position 1 and it was wrong. It doesn\'t say that the secret word has C in position 1? Actually, no: the feedback for C was (-) meaning it is in the word but not in position 1. So the secret word has a C, but not at position 1. Therefore, we can try C in positions 2,3,4,5.\n\n However, we are allowed to put C in position 1 again? But that would be redundant and we know it\'s not there. So we should avoid position 1 for C.\n\n So for the next guess, we should put C in one of positions 2,3,4,5.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that has C in position 2: \n   _ C _ _ _\n\n We need to fill the blanks with letters that are not R, A, N, E.\n\n Common letters: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.\n\n Example: ""SCULP"" (not common) -> let\'s think of more common words.\n\n How about ""SCHOL""? But that has S, C, H, O, L. But we don\'t know about S, H, O, L. Also, it\'s a valid word? Yes, meaning a school or a student.\n\n But note: we have to avoid R, A, N, E. ""SCHOL"" doesn\'t have any of these.\n\n Alternatively, ""CLOMP"" has C in position 1? We cannot put C in position 1. So we need a word that has C in position 2 or later.\n\n Let me try to list words with C in position 2: \n   Position 1: any letter except R, A, N, E, and also not C (because we are putting C in position 2) -> so we can use other consonants or vowels (but vowels: O, I, U are available, but we know the word must have at least one vowel? Actually, we don\'t know about vowels because we only know about A and E being absent. But the word might have I, O, U, or even Y?).\n\n Example: ""SCALY"" -> but has A (excluded) and L, Y. But A is excluded -> so invalid.\n   ""SCOWL"" -> has O, W, L. But W is less common. And we don\'t know about O, W, L. Also, no excluded letters.\n\n But we can use ""SCOWL"". However, we have to consider that we are only on the second guess, so we want to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\n Another word: ""SCUBA"" -> has A (excluded) -> invalid.\n\n How about ""SCION""? -> has I, O, N -> but N is excluded! We cannot use N.\n\n So we must avoid N.\n\n Therefore, ""SCION"" is invalid because of N.\n\n Let me try ""SCUFF"" -> has U, F, F. But F is not very common. And we have two F\'s? We don\'t know if F is in the word.\n\n Alternatively, we can try C in position 3: \n   _ _ C _ _\n\n Example: ""FICUS"" -> has F, I, C, U, S. But F is not very common. And we have to avoid R, A, N, E -> which we are. But we can do better.\n\n How about ""MUSIC"" -> has M, U, S, I, C. But C is at the end (position 5). Also, we avoid R, A, N, E.\n\n But note: we have to avoid using the same letter twice? We don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. But we can try.\n\n However, we are trying to get information. Using ""MUSIC"" would use M, U, S, I, C. That\'s five new letters (except C which we know is present). And we are putting C at the end.\n\n But wait: the feedback for the first guess told us that C is in the word but not in position 1. So if we put C in position 5, that\'s a new position.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""PICKS"" -> but has S, I, C, K, S. But we don\'t know about P, I, K, S. However, we have two S\'s? And we are avoiding R, A, N, E.\n\n But we can also consider words that have C in position 4: \n   _ _ _ C _\n\n Example: ""TOPIC"" -> T, O, P, I, C. This avoids R, A, N, E. And we haven\'t tried T, O, P, I.\n\n But note: we are allowed to use T, O, P, I? Yes, because they are not excluded.\n\n However, we must avoid using letters that we know are absent: R, A, N, E.\n\n So ""TOPIC"" is a valid word and uses T, O, P, I, C.\n\n But we also want to cover more common consonants. Let\'s see the frequency of letters.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""CLOMP"" but that has C in position 1? We cannot do that because we know C is not in position 1. So we must avoid position 1 for C.\n\n Therefore, we cannot use words that start with C.\n\n So let\'s try ""CLOMP"" is invalid because it has C in position 1.\n\n How about ""MUCKY""? -> but Y is less common.\n\n Another idea: ""PITCH"" -> has P, I, T, C, H. C is in position 4. This avoids R, A, N, E. And we get to test P, I, T, C, H.\n\n But note: we are not sure if the word has H or not. But that\'s the point of guessing.\n\n Alternatively, ""C"" in position 5: \n   _ _ _ _ C\n\n Example: ""MANIC"" -> has A (excluded) and N (excluded) -> invalid.\n   ""TOPIC"" -> we considered that, but it has C at the end.\n\n However, ""TOPIC"" has C at the end. We can use that.\n\n But let me check: the word ""TOPIC"" is valid.\n\n However, we can also try ""CLOPS"" -> but that has C in position 1? No, we cannot. So we must avoid C in position 1.\n\n Therefore, we can use words that have C in positions 2,3,4,5.\n\n Let me try to find a word that has C in position 2 and uses common letters: \n   Position 1: not C, and not R, A, N, E -> so we can use S, T, L, O, I, etc.\n   Position 2: C\n   Positions 3,4,5: other letters.\n\n Example: ""SCULP"" (not common) -> let\'s try ""SCUFF"" but that has two F\'s and is not very common.\n\n Another: ""SCHOL"" (as I thought earlier) -> S, C, H, O, L. This is a valid word. And we avoid R, A, N, E.\n\n But we can also try ""SLOTH"" -> but no C? We must include C because we know it\'s in the word. So we have to include C.\n\n So we must have C in the word.\n\n Therefore, let\'s choose between:\n   Option 1: ""SCHOL"" (C in position 2) -> letters: S, C, H, O, L.\n   Option 2: ""TOPIC"" (C in position 5) -> letters: T, O, P, I, C.\n\n Which one is better? \n   We want to cover more common letters. The frequency of letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... (but we have excluded A, E, R, N). So the most common left are T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U.\n\n   ""TOPIC"" has T, O, P, I, C -> that\'s T, O, P, I, and C (which we know is present). \n   ""SCHOL"" has S, C, H, O, L -> S, H, O, L.\n\n   The set of letters in ""TOPIC"" includes T, O, P, I, C. \n   The set of letters in ""SCHOL"" includes S, C, H, O, L.\n\n   The frequency of T, O, P, I is higher than S, H, O, L? \n     T is very common, O is common, P is common, I is common. \n     S is also common, H is common, O is common, L is common.\n\n   But note: we already know that the word has C, so we are testing 4 new letters in both.\n\n   However, we have two options. We can choose either.\n\n   But we can also consider ""CLOTH"" -> but C is in position 1? We cannot use that.\n\n   How about ""SHOCK""? -> has S, H, O, C, K. C is in position 4. This avoids R, A, N, E. And we test S, H, O, C, K.\n\n   This seems good because K is also common.\n\n   But we have to choose one.\n\n   Alternatively, ""CHOMP"" -> but C is in position 1? We cannot use that.\n\n   So let\'s avoid position 1 for C.\n\n   After considering, I think ""SHOCK"" is a good candidate: \n        S H O C K\n\n   But note: we are putting C in position 4. We know C is in the word, but we don\'t know where. So position 4 is a good candidate?\n\n   However, we don\'t know. We are trying to cover multiple positions.\n\n   Another candidate: ""BLOCK"" -> but has B, L, O, C, K. But we don\'t know about B, L, O, K. And we avoid R, A, N, E. But note: we have to avoid using letters that are not in the word? We are allowed to use any letters, even if they are not present, to test.\n\n   But we are only interested in letters that might be present.\n\n   However, we already know that the word has C, so we should focus on other letters.\n\n   Let me compare:\n\n   ""SHOCK"": tests S, H, O, C, K. We know C is present, so we are testing S, H, O, K.\n   ""BLOCK"": tests B, L, O, C, K. But note: we are putting C in position 4. Also, we avoid R, A, N, E.\n\n   But we don\'t know if the word has O or not. Similarly for the others.\n\n   We want to maximize the chance of getting more feedback.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try a word that has the letter \'S\' because it\'s very common.\n\n   How about ""SCOLD""? -> has S, C, O, L, but the word is ""SCOLD"". This avoids R, A, N, E. And C is in position 2.\n\n   But we are putting C in position 2. This is a new position.\n\n   Let me check: \n      Position 1: S\n      Position 2: C\n      Position 3: O\n      Position 4: L\n      Position 5: D\n\n   This word: ""SCOLD"" -> S, C, O, L, D.\n\n   We haven\'t tried S, O, L, D. And we know C is present.\n\n   But note: we are not sure if the word has O or not. We are testing.\n\n   Another common word: ""CLOCK"" -> but C is in position 1? We cannot use that.\n\n   So ""SCOLD"" is a valid word.\n\n   But we have to consider that we are using D. Alternatively, we can use ""SCULP"" but that\'s not common.\n\n   Let me choose ""SCOLD"" because it uses common letters and we avoid the excluded ones.\n\n   However, we have to make sure we don\'t use any of the excluded letters: R, A, N, E. ""SCOLD"" doesn\'t have any of these.\n\n   So I will go with ""SCOLD"".\n\n   But wait: what if the secret word has C in position 2? Then we get a match. But if not, we get feedback on S, C, O, L, D.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try a word that has C in a position that we haven\'t tried? Actually, in the first guess, we tried C in position 1. Now we are trying C in position 2. If we get a match in position 2, then we know. If not, we know that C is not in position 2 and we can try other positions.\n\n   But we have 5 positions. We can try to cover multiple positions? Actually, we are doing that.\n\n   However, we have only one known letter (C) and we are testing it in a new position.\n\n   Let me decide: \n\n   Option 1: ""SCOLD"" -> tests S, C (in pos2), O, L, D.\n   Option 2: ""TOPIC"" -> tests T, O, P, I, C (in pos5). \n\n   Both are good. But ""TOPIC"" has the advantage of having two vowels (O and I) which might be useful.\n\n   But note: we already know that the word doesn\'t have A and E, so the vowels must be among I, O, U, and possibly Y.\n\n   We haven\'t tested O, I, U. So testing two vowels at once might be efficient.\n\n   Also, ""TOPIC"" has T and P which are common.\n\n   So I think ""TOPIC"" is a good choice.\n\n   But wait: we are putting C in position 5. We know C is in the word, but we don\'t know if it\'s in position 5. So we are testing that.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try a word that has C in a position that we haven\'t tried and also includes more common letters.\n\n   After consideration, I think ""TOPIC"" is a good choice.\n\n   So I will go with ""TOPIC"".\n\n   But let me check: the word ""TOPIC"" is valid.\n\n   Therefore, my second guess is ""TOPIC"".\n\n   We are hoping to get feedback on T, O, P, I, and also on C (we know it will be either correct or present? Actually, we know it\'s present, so we expect either:\n        - If the word has C in position 5: then we get C as correct (✓) and then we know the last letter is C.\n        - Otherwise, we get C as (-) meaning it\'s in another position.\n\n   But we are also testing T, O, P, I.\n\n   So we will get information about these.\n\n   Let me write the guess: TOPIC\n\n   But note: we are not sure if the word has O or I. But that\'s the point.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try a word that has the letter \'S\' because it\'s very common. \n\n   How about ""COSTS""? -> but C is in position 1? We cannot use that.\n\n   How about ""SCOWL""? -> C in position 2. But we are avoiding R, A, N, E -> and it has W and L. W is less common. But it\'s acceptable.\n\n   But we can do better: ""SCOWL"" is not as common.\n\n   Another: ""STOIC"" -> has S, T, O, I, C. C is in position 5. This is a valid word. And we avoid R, A, N, E.\n\n   ""STOIC"" is a common word.\n\n   So between ""TOPIC"" and ""STOIC"", which one? \n        ""TOPIC"": T, O, P, I, C\n        ""STOIC"": S, T, O, I, C\n\n   Both are good. But ""STOIC"" has S which is very common. And we haven\'t tested S.\n\n   So I think ""STOIC"" is a good choice.\n\n   But note: we are putting C in position 5 in both. We don\'t know if that\'s correct.\n\n   However, we are also testing S, T, O, I.\n\n   Let me choose ""STOIC"".\n\n   So my second guess: STOIC\n\n   But wait: we are putting C in position 5. We know C is in the word, but we don\'t know if it\'s in position 5. So we are testing that.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try to put C in a position that we haven\'t tested? Actually, we only tested position 1. So positions 2,3,4,5 are untested for C.\n\n   We can choose any of 2,3,4,5. \n\n   I think ""STOIC"" is a good choice.\n\n   So I\'ll go with ""STOIC"".\n\n   But note: we are also testing S, T, O, I. And we know C is present.\n\n   Therefore, I choose ""STOIC"".\n\n   So the guess is ""stoic"".\n\n   But let me confirm: \n        S: we don\'t know -> we are testing S.\n        T: testing T.\n        O: testing O.\n        I: testing I.\n        C: we know is present, so we are testing if it\'s in position 5.\n\n   This will give us good information.\n\n   So the word is ""STOIC"".\n\n   We\'ll guess ""STOIC"".\n\n   If the feedback for C is (-) then we know C is not in position 5, so it must be in 2,3, or 4.\n\n   And we get information about S, T, O, I.\n\n   So let\'s do that.\n\n   Guess: stoic\n\n   Format: <guess>stoic</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C is present but in the wrong position (not position 1).\n- R, A, N, E are absent from the secret word.\n\nFor the next guess, I need to:\n1. Include the letter ""C"" in a position other than 1 (since it was incorrect there).\n2. Avoid using R, A, N, E.\n3. Test new common letters to gather more information.\n\nI chose ""stoic"" because:\n- It places ""C"" in position 5 (a new position to test).\n- It avoids excluded letters (R, A, N, E).\n- It introduces four new common letters: S, T, O, I.\n- The word is valid and balances vowel/consonant testing (O and I are vowels).\n\nThis guess will help identify the position of ""C"" and test for the presence of S, T, O, I.\n\n<guess>stoic</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: stoic -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(-) I(x) C(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(-), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x)\nMeaning:\n- C is in the word but not in position 1.\n- R, A, N, E are not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: ""stoic"" -> S(x), T(x), O(-), I(x), C(-)\nMeaning:\n- S is not in the word.\n- T is not in the word.\n- O is in the word but not in position 3 (since in ""stoic"", O is the third letter).\n- I is not in the word.\n- C is in the word but not in position 5 (since in ""stoic"", C is the fifth letter).\n\nSo, combining the information:\n\nLetters known to be absent: R, A, N, E, S, T, I\nLetters known to be present: C and O\n\nFor C:\n- It is not in position 1 (from guess 1) and not in position 5 (from guess 2). So it must be in position 2, 3, or 4.\n\nFor O:\n- It is in the word but not in position 3 (from guess 2). So it could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nWe also know that the secret word has exactly 5 letters, and we have two known letters: C and O. But there are three more letters we don\'t know.\n\nWe need to avoid the absent letters: R, A, N, E, S, T, I.\n\nAvailable letters: We can use any letter except the absent ones. Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nWe have 4 more guesses (since we used 2, and we have 6 total).\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that:\n- Contains C and O (both must be present, but we don\'t know their positions yet).\n- Does not contain R, A, N, E, S, T, I.\n- We can use other letters from the available set.\n\nWe also want to test new common letters to get more information.\n\nLet\'s think about the positions for C and O:\n\n- C must be in position 2, 3, or 4.\n- O must not be in position 3 (from the feedback of ""stoic""), so O can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if there are duplicate letters. However, we haven\'t encountered any duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates for now.\n\nWe need to choose a word that has both C and O, and three other letters that are not in the absent list.\n\nWe also want to cover common letters that we haven\'t tested. The remaining common letters include: L, H, D, M, P, U, B, G, etc.\n\nLet\'s try to form words:\n\nOption 1: Put O in position 1 and C in position 2? \n   Word: O _ C _ _\n   We need to fill the blanks. Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\n   Example: ""OCCUR"" -> but has two C\'s? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed, but we can try. However, we have only one C known so far, and if we use two C\'s, we might get confused. Also, ""OCCUR"" has U and R (R is excluded) -> invalid.\n\n   ""OCHRE"" -> has R and E (excluded) -> invalid.\n\n   ""OCLAD"" -> not a common word.\n\n   ""OCHIN"" -> not common.\n\n   ""OCHRE"" is invalid.\n\n   How about ""OCHER""? -> has E and R -> invalid.\n\n   This is difficult.\n\nOption 2: Put O in position 1 and C in position 3?\n   Word: O _ C _ _\n   Example: ""OUPHE"" -> not common and has E.\n\n   ""OCTAL"" -> has T (excluded) -> invalid.\n\n   ""OCCAM"" -> has A (excluded) -> invalid.\n\n   ""OCHER"" -> invalid.\n\n   Not many common words.\n\nOption 3: Put O in position 1 and C in position 4?\n   Word: O _ _ C _\n   Example: ""OPERA"" -> has E and R -> invalid.\n   ""OBIIT"" -> not common and has I (excluded) -> invalid.\n\n   ""OCTAD"" -> has T -> invalid.\n\n   ""OCHOS"" -> has S -> invalid.\n\n   Still difficult.\n\nOption 4: Put O in position 2 and C in position 3?\n   Word: _ O C _ _\n   Example: ""FOCUS"" -> has F, O, C, U, S -> but S is excluded -> invalid.\n   ""LOCUS"" -> has L, O, C, U, S -> S excluded -> invalid.\n   ""DOCKS"" -> has S -> invalid.\n\n   We need to avoid S.\n\n   ""BLOCK"" -> has B, L, O, C, K -> but we don\'t know about B, L, K. And S is not in it. But we have to avoid T? ""BLOCK"" has no T, but it has B, L, O, C, K. However, we have to check if any of these are excluded? We haven\'t excluded B, L, K. And O and C are included.\n\n   But note: we are putting O in position 3? In ""BLOCK"", O is in position 3? But we know from guess 2 that O is not in position 3? Actually, the feedback for ""stoic"" said O is in the word but not in position 3. So we cannot put O in position 3 again? Actually, we can, but we know it\'s not there. So we should avoid position 3 for O.\n\n   In ""BLOCK"", O is in position 3? Let\'s see:\n        B L O C K -> positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:O, 4:C, 5:K -> so O is in 3, which we know is wrong. So we should avoid that.\n\n   We must avoid putting O in position 3 because we already know it\'s not there.\n\n   So for the pattern _ O C _ _, we would have O in position 2 and C in position 3. Then we need to fill the first and last positions.\n\n   Example: ""DOCKS"" -> has S -> invalid.\n\n   ""FOCUS"" -> has S -> invalid.\n\n   ""LOCUM"" -> has U, M, but no C? We need C. ""LOCUM"" is L, O, C, U, M -> but that\'s 5 letters? L O C U M -> positions: 1:L, 2:O, 3:C, 4:U, 5:M. But we are putting O in position 2 and C in position 3. This is acceptable? But we don\'t know if O can be in position 2? We haven\'t tested O in position 2.\n\n   However, we know O is not in position 3, but position 2 is untested.\n\n   But ""LOCUM"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning a place or a thing.\n\n   But we have to avoid S, T, I, etc. ""LOCUM"" has L, O, C, U, M -> no S, T, I, R, A, N, E. So it\'s acceptable.\n\n   But we are putting C in position 3. We know C is not in position 1 or 5, but position 3 is untested.\n\n   However, we are also putting O in position 2. We don\'t know if O is in position 2.\n\n   But note: we are testing two new positions for C and O.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try to put C in position 2 and O in position 4? \n        Word: _ C _ O _\n        Example: ""SCOWL"" -> but S is excluded -> invalid.\n        ""ACORN"" -> A and R excluded -> invalid.\n\n   ""OCULI"" -> has I -> invalid.\n\n   ""OCHER"" -> invalid.\n\n   This is challenging.\n\n   Let me try putting O in position 4 and C in position 2:\n        Word: _ C _ O _\n        Example: ""CLOAK"" -> has A -> invalid.\n        ""CROOK"" -> has R -> invalid.\n        ""DUCAT"" -> has T -> invalid.\n\n   Not working.\n\n   Put O in position 5 and C in position 3?\n        Word: _ _ C _ O\n        Example: ""MANCO"" -> has A and N -> invalid.\n        ""FICUS"" -> has I and S -> invalid.\n\n   ""MUCRO"" -> has U, C, R, O -> R excluded -> invalid.\n\n   ""MACHO"" -> has A -> invalid.\n\n   This is difficult.\n\n   Put O in position 1 and C in position 4:\n        Word: O _ _ C _\n        Example: ""OPIUM"" -> has I and U? But I is excluded. -> invalid.\n        ""OCTYL"" -> has T and Y, L -> but T excluded -> invalid.\n\n   ""OCHER"" -> invalid.\n\n   Put O in position 2 and C in position 4:\n        Word: _ O _ C _\n        Example: ""BLOCK"" -> we already considered, but O is in position 3? In ""BLOCK"": B(1), L(2), O(3), C(4), K(5) -> so O is in 3, which we know is wrong. So we cannot use that.\n\n   We must avoid position 3 for O.\n\n   So for _ O _ C _, we need O in position 2 and C in position 4. Then the third position must be filled.\n\n   Example: ""DOUCE"" -> has E -> invalid.\n        ""FOCUS"" -> has S -> invalid.\n\n   ""LOCUS"" -> has S -> invalid.\n\n   ""VOCAL"" -> has A -> invalid.\n\n   ""YOCKS"" -> has S -> invalid.\n\n   Not working.\n\n   Put O in position 4 and C in position 2:\n        Word: _ C _ O _\n        Example: ""SCOWL"" -> S excluded -> invalid.\n        ""ACROW"" -> A and R excluded -> invalid.\n\n   ""OCULI"" -> has I -> invalid.\n\n   This is difficult.\n\n   Put O in position 5 and C in position 3:\n        Word: _ _ C _ O\n        Example: ""MANCO"" -> A and N excluded -> invalid.\n        ""FICUS"" -> I and S excluded -> invalid.\n\n   ""MUCRO"" -> R excluded -> invalid.\n\n   ""MACHO"" -> A excluded -> invalid.\n\n   Given the difficulty, let\'s consider putting C in position 2 and O in position 4? \n        Word: _ C _ O _\n        But we need to fill position 1, 3, and 5.\n\n        Example: ""CLOAK"" -> A excluded -> invalid.\n        ""CROCK"" -> R and C (duplicate?) -> but we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, R excluded -> invalid.\n\n        ""DUCAT"" -> T excluded -> invalid.\n\n        ""FACET"" -> A, E, T excluded -> invalid.\n\n        ""PILOT"" -> has I and T -> invalid.\n\n        ""MUCOR"" -> R excluded -> invalid.\n\n        ""MYCO"" -> too short? 5 letters?

No, in ""BLOCK"": \n            Position 1: B, 2: L, 3: O, 4: C, 5: K -> so O is in 3, which we know is wrong. So we cannot use that.\n\n        We need O in position 2 and C in position 4. So the word: \n            Position 1: ?\n            Position 2: O\n            Position 3: ? (must not be O, because then we have two O\'s? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. However, we haven\'t seen O twice, so maybe the word has only one O? But we don\'t know. We can try a word with two O\'s? But we don\'t have evidence of duplicates.)\n\n        Example: ""DOUCE"" -> E -> invalid.\n        ""FOCUS"" -> S -> invalid.\n        ""LOCUS"" -> S -> invalid.\n        ""VOCAL"" -> A -> invalid.\n\n        ""YOCKS"" -> S -> invalid.\n\n        ""BOCKS"" -> S -> invalid.\n\n        ""LOCKO"" -> not a word.\n\n        ""BLOCK"" is invalid because O is in position 3.\n\n        How about ""DOCKS"" -> has S -> invalid.\n\n        ""HOCKS"" -> S -> invalid.\n\n        ""POCKS"" -> S -> invalid.\n\n        ""WOCK"" -> too short.\n\n   This is difficult.\n\n   Put O in position 2 and C in position 3:\n        Word: _ O C _ _\n        Example: ""FOCUS"" -> S -> invalid.\n        ""LOCUS"" -> S -> invalid.\n        ""COCKS"" -> has S -> invalid.\n        ""DOCKS"" -> S -> invalid.\n        ""HOCKS"" -> S -> invalid.\n        ""POCKS"" -> S -> invalid.\n\n        ""YOCKS"" -> S -> invalid.\n\n        ""BLOCK"" -> O is in position 3 -> invalid.\n\n        How about ""COUCH"" -> has U, C, H -> but C is in position 2 and 4?

Actually, in ""COUCH"", the first C is position 1, which we know is not correct, and the third letter is U, and then C in position 4. But we are trying to test C in position 3? \n            However, we are putting O in position 2 and C in position 3? In ""COUCH"", O is in position 2, but then we have C in position 1 (which we know is wrong) and then U and H. So we cannot use C in position 1.\n\n        We need a word that has C in position 3 and O in position 2. But ""COUCH"" has C in position 1 and 4, not 3.\n\n        How about ""DOUCE"" -> E -> invalid.\n\n        ""FOCUS"" -> S -> invalid.\n\n        ""LOCUM"" -> but then O is in position 2, C in position 3? \n            ""LOCUM"": L(1), O(2), C(3), U(4), M(5).

So it\'s acceptable.\n\n        ""PULCO"" is a word? I think it\'s a proper noun? Not common. Let me check: actually, ""pulco"" is not a standard word. \n\n        ""PULMO"" -> has M, O -> but no C?

We can try, but let\'s avoid for now.\n\n        ""PUPCO"" is not standard.\n\n   After some research, ""LOCUM"" seems to be a valid word and meets the criteria.\n\n   But let me confirm: \n        L: not excluded -> okay.\n        O: we are testing in position 2 -> okay.\n        C: we are testing in position 3 -> okay.\n        U: not excluded -> okay.\n        M: not excluded -> okay.\n\n   And it avoids R, A, N, E, S, T, I.\n\n   So I think ""LOCUM"" is a good guess.\n\n   But note: we are putting O in position 2 and C in position 3. We know O is not in position 3, but position 2 is untested. Similarly, C is not in 1 or 5, so position 3 is untested.\n\n   We also test L, U, M.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try ""COUCH"" but that has C in position 1 (which we know is wrong) and O in position 2. But we cannot use C in position 1. So that\'s out.\n\n   Another candidate: ""DOUCE"" -> has E -> invalid.\n\n   ""LOCUM"" seems best.\n\n   But wait, what about ""CLOMP""? We cannot because C is in position 1.\n\n   How about ""CLOPS""? C in position 1 -> invalid.\n\n   We must avoid position 1 for C.\n\n   So ""LOCUM"" is a good choice.\n\n   But let me see if there\'s a word that has O in position 4 and C in position 2? \n        Word: _ C _ O _\n        Example: ""SCOWL"" -> S -> invalid.\n        ""ACOWP"" -> A and S excluded -> invalid.\n\n        ""OCULI"" -> I -> invalid.\n\n        ""OCHER"" -> invalid.\n\n        ""OCTAD"" -> T excluded.\n\n        ""OCTYL"" -> T excluded.\n\n        ""OCHOS"" -> S -> invalid.\n\n        ""OCHRY"" -> R -> invalid.\n\n        ""OCHUM"" -> not common.\n\n        ""LOCUM"" is one of the few.\n\n   Or ""CUMIN"" -> has N -> invalid.\n\n   Another: ""CUMUL"" -> not common.\n\n   So I think ""LOCUM"" is a reasonable choice.\n\n   But note: we are putting C in position 3. We know that C is not in position 1 or 5, but position 3 is possible.\n\n   We\'ll go with ""LOCUM"".\n\n   So the guess is ""LOCUM"".\n\n   Format: <guess>locum</guess>\n\n   But let me double-check the word: L-O-C-U-M.\n\n   Positions:\n        1: L -> test L\n        2: O -> test O in position 2\n        3: C -> test C in position 3\n        4: U -> test U\n        5: M -> test M\n\n   This will give us information about the positions of C and O, and also about L, U, M.\n\n   If we get a match for O in position 2, that would be great. But if not, we know O is not in position 2.\n\n   Similarly for C in position 3.\n\n   And we test L, U, M.\n\n   So it\'s informative.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try a word that has O in position 4 and C in position 2? \n        Word: _ C _ O _\n        Example: ""SCOWL"" -> S -> invalid.\n        ""ACOWP"" -> A and S excluded -> invalid.\n\n        ""OCULI"" -> I -> invalid.\n\n        ""OCHER"" -> invalid.\n\n        ""OCTAD"" -> T excluded.\n\n        ""OCTYL"" -> T excluded.\n\n        ""OCHOS"" -> S -> invalid.\n\n        ""OCHRY"" -> R -> invalid.\n\n        ""OCHUM"" -> not common.\n\n        ""LOCUM"" is the only common word I can think of for this pattern.\n\n   Or ""CLOPS"" -> C in position 1 -> invalid.\n\n   So I think ""LOCUM"" is the best.\n\n   Therefore, we guess ""LOCUM"".\n\n   But note: we are putting O in position 2 and C in position 3. We know that O is not in position 3, but position 2 is new. C is not in position 1 or 5, so position 3 is new.\n\n   We\'ll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **C** is in the word but not in positions 1 or 5 (from ""crane"" and ""stoic"" feedback).\n- **O** is in the word but not in position 3 (from ""stoic"" feedback).\n- Absent letters: R, A, N, E, S, T, I (cannot be used).\n- Present letters: C and O must be included, with C in positions 2, 3, or 4 and O in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nFor the next guess, I chose ""locum"" because:\n- It includes both required letters (**C** and **O**) in untested positions: **C** in position 3 and **O** in position 2.\n- It avoids all absent letters (R, A, N, E, S, T, I).\n- It tests new common letters (L, U, M) to gather more information.\n- The word is valid and helps narrow down positions for C and O while covering frequent consonants.\n\n<guess>locum</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: stoic -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(-) I(x) C(-)\nGuess 3: locum -> FEEDBACK: L(x) O(✓) C(✓) U(x) M(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Incorrect format think\n\n<guess>Incorrect format answer</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: stoic -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(-) I(x) C(-)\nGuess 3: locum -> FEEDBACK: L(x) O(✓) C(✓) U(x) M(x)\nModel answer is not in the correct format\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(-), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x)
  - C is present but not in position 1.
  - R, A, N, E are absent.

Guess 2: ""stoic"" -> S(x), T(x), O(-), I(x), C(-)
  - S, T, I are absent.
  - O is present but not in position 3.
  - C is present but not in position 5.

Guess 3: ""locum"" -> L(x), O(✓), C(✓), U(x), M(x)
  - L, U, M are absent.
  - O is correct in position 2 (so the secret word has O in the second position).
  - C is correct in position 3 (so the secret word has C in the third position).

So now we know:
- The secret word has O in position 2 and C in position 3.
- Therefore, the word pattern is: _ O C _ _
- We also know that the letters R, A, N, E, S, T, I, L, U, M are absent.

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits: _ O C _ _
- The first and last two positions (positions 1, 4, and 5) must be filled with letters that are not in the absent list.
- The word must be composed of available letters: from the remaining alphabet excluding R, A, N, E, S, T, I, L, U, M.

Available letters (consonants and vowels): 
Vowels: O is already placed, and we know A, E, I, U are absent. So the only vowel left is possibly Y (and sometimes W, but less common). 
Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We have to fill positions 1, 4, and 5.

We also know that the word must contain only letters that are not excluded.

Let's list the absent letters: A, E, I, L, M, N, R, S, T, U.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, P, V, W, Y, and possibly Y as a vowel.

Now, we need to form a word: [letter1] O C [letter4] [letter5]

We have to choose letter1, letter4, and letter5 from the available letters.

Common words that fit this pattern? 

- Words ending with Y: e.g., ""COCOA"" -> but 5 letters? ""COCOA"" is 5 letters: C O C O A -> but we have C in position 3, so position 1 would be C? But we know C is in position 3, so position 1 cannot be C (because if it were, it would be a duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback, we haven't seen any duplicate so far, but it's possible).

But note: in ""locum"", we had C in position 3 and it was correct. If the word had two C's, then in ""stoic"" we had C in position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. But now we have C in position 3. So if the word has two C's, then in ""stoic"" the C in position 5 would be one of the C's? But we don't know. However, we haven't seen evidence of duplicates.

But to be safe, we should consider the possibility of duplicates. However, we have no indication so far.

Given the pattern _ O C _ _, and the available letters, let's think of words:

- ""BLOCK"" -> but B L O C K: L is excluded (from guess 3) -> invalid.
- ""CLOCK"" -> C in position 1? We cannot, and also L is excluded.
- ""FOCUS"" -> F O C U S -> but U and S are excluded (from guess 3) -> invalid.
- ""LOCUS"" -> L and S excluded -> invalid.
- ""POCKS"" -> P O C K S -> S excluded -> invalid.
- ""YOCKS"" -> S excluded -> invalid.

Now, with the available letters, what can we have?

We need to use letters from: B, D, F, G, H, K, P, V, W, Y.

Let's try to form words:

- Position 1: B, D, F, G, H, K, P, V, W, Y
- Position 4: same set
- Position 5: same set

Common words? 

- ""YOCRY""? Not a word.
- ""HOCOM""? Not a word.
- ""POCOY""? Not a word.

Perhaps we need to consider Y as a vowel? 

Words ending with Y: 
- ""COCOA"" -> but position 1 is C, which would be a duplicate? And we have position 3 as C. But ""COCOA"" is C O C O A -> but we need position 3 to be C, which it is. But position 1 is C, which we don't know if it's allowed. Also, O is in position 2, which is correct. But we have two C's? And A is excluded. So invalid.

- ""BOCCE"" -> B O C E C E -> but E is excluded -> invalid.

- ""FOCAL"" -> F O C A L -> A excluded -> invalid.

- ""HOC"" + two letters? 

How about ""YOCRY""? Not a word.

""POCKY"" -> P O C K Y -> but K and Y are available? 
- ""POCKY"": P(1), O(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5). 
- Check absent: P, K, Y are not in the absent list. O and C are already placed. 
- So this is a candidate: ""POCKY"".

Is ""POCKY"" a word? Yes, meaning cheeky or mischievous.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""POCKY"" uses P, O, C, K, Y. 
- O and C are known to be present. 
- P, K, Y are not excluded (excluded: R,A,N,E,S,T,I,L,U,M).

So ""POCKY"" is a valid guess.

Another possibility: ""BOWCY""? Not a word.

""JOCKY""? Not common, and J is available? But ""JOCKY"" is not standard.

""FOCAL"" is invalid because of A.

""VOCAL"" is invalid because of A.

""DOCKY""? Not a word.

""BLOCK"" is invalid because of L.

""OCKER"" -> has R -> invalid.

""YOCKS"" -> has S -> invalid.

""YOCRY"" -> not a word.

Another word: ""HOCKY""? Not common.

""COCKY"" -> C in position 1? We cannot, because we know C is in position 3. Also, ""COCKY"" has C in position 1 and 3? But we are putting C in position 1, which we know is wrong. So invalid.

But what if we put C in position 3 only? We are forced to put C in position 3 because it's fixed. So we cannot avoid it.

Another word: ""POCKS"" -> has S -> invalid.

""POCK"" is only 4 letters.

So ""POCKY"" seems a good candidate.

But let me check if there are other options.

""YOCRY"" is not a word.

""BOCKS"" -> has S -> invalid.

""COCKS"" -> C in position 1 -> invalid.

""DOCKS"" -> has S -> invalid.

""FOCUS"" -> has U and S -> invalid.

""LOCUS"" -> has L and S -> invalid.

""MOCK"" is 4 letters.

""POCKY"" is 5 letters and uses P, K, Y which are available.

But we have to make sure that Y is allowed. Yes, because it's not excluded.

Also, ""POCKY"" means something like ""cheeky"" or ""mischievous"". It's a valid English word.

Another word: ""HOCKY""? Not common. ""Hockey"" is 5 letters but ends with Y. ""HOCKY"" is not standard.

""JOCKY"" -> not common.

""WOCKY"" -> not common.

""YOCKY"" -> not common.

""YOCRY"" -> not a word.

""YOCRY"" is not recognized.

Perhaps ""BOCCE"" -> but has E -> invalid.

Or ""BOWCE"" -> has E -> invalid.

So ""POCKY"" seems to be the only common word that fits.

But wait, what about ""COVET""? But that doesn't fit the pattern. We need O in position 2 and C in position 3.

Another word: ""FOCUS"" is invalid.

""OCREA"" -> has A -> invalid.

""OCRE"" is 4 letters.

""OCHRE"" -> has R and E -> invalid.

So I think ""POCKY"" is the best bet.

But note: we are putting O in position 2 and C in position 3, which we already know are correct. So in ""POCKY"", we have:
- P in position 1: we don't know.
- K in position 4: we don't know.
- Y in position 5: we don't know.

And we test P, K, Y.

But we also know that the word must have exactly the letters we find? Not necessarily, because we know O and C are fixed in positions 2 and 3.

But the word must be _ O C _ _, and the last two letters are P, K, and Y? In ""POCKY"".

But is ""POCKY"" the only possibility? 

What about ""YOCRY""? Not a word.

""BOCCE"" -> has E -> invalid.

""LOCUM"" we already tried, and it had U and M which are absent.

Another word: ""COCOA"" -> but C in position 1 and 3? And A is excluded. So invalid.

""DOCO"" is 4 letters.

""FOCUS"" is invalid.

""OCULI"" -> has I -> invalid.

""OCHER"" -> invalid.

So I think ""POCKY"" is the word.

But let me double-check: 
- Position 1: P (not excluded)
- Position 4: K (not excluded)
- Position 5: Y (not excluded)

And the word is ""POCKY"".

But we are not 100% sure because there might be other words. However, with the constraints, it seems to be the only common word.

Perhaps ""HOCKY"" is a word? In some contexts, ""hockey"" is 6 letters. ""HOCKY"" is not standard.

""JOCKY"" is not common.

""WOCKY"" not common.

""YOCKY"" not common.

""YOCRY"" not a word.

So I think ""POCKY"" is the guess.

But note: we have to make sure that we are not missing something.

Another word: ""COCKY"" -> but C in position 1? We cannot, because we know C is in position 3. Also, ""COCKY"" has C in position 1 and 3? But we are putting C in position 1, which we know is wrong. So invalid.

""BLOCK"" is invalid.

So I'll go with ""POCKY"".

But wait, what about ""BOCCE""? Not 5 letters? ""Bocce"" is 5 letters: B O C E C -> but E is excluded -> invalid.

""COBRA"" -> has A and R -> invalid.

Therefore, the only common word that fits the pattern and the constraints is ""POCKY"".

So we guess ""POCKY"".

But note: we are using Y. Y can be a vowel, and it's not excluded.

So the guess is ""pocky"".

But let me write it in uppercase: POCKY.

However, in the previous guesses, we used uppercase? The example was in uppercase. So we'll use uppercase.

But the user input was in lowercase, so I'll use lowercase for consistency.

Actually, the previous feedback was in lowercase: ""stoic"" and ""locum"" were in lowercase? Let's check:

Guess 1: crane -> lowercase
Guess 2: stoic -> lowercase
Guess 3: locum -> lowercase

So I'll use lowercase.

But the word ""POCKY"" is uppercase? No, ""pocky"" is 5 letters: P-O-C-K-Y.

So in lowercase: pocky.

But the guess should be in uppercase? The example is in uppercase. However, the user said ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" and provided feedback in lowercase? 

In the last message, the user said:
""Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: stoic -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(-) I(x) C(-)
Guess 3: locum -> FEEDBACK: L(x) O(✓) C(✓) U(x) M(x)""

So the feedback is in lowercase? But the guess should be in uppercase? 

The instruction says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess."" and then they provide the feedback in lowercase. But in the previous response, I guessed in lowercase? 

In my previous response, I said: ""<guess>pocky</guess>"" but in lowercase. However, the instruction says to use uppercase? 

But the example in the instruction uses uppercase: ""POCKY"" is uppercase. 

But the user input is in lowercase: ""pocky"" is in lowercase. So I'll use lowercase for consistency.

However, the instruction says: ""Guess: stoic"" in uppercase? But in the context, it's lowercase. 

To be consistent, I'll use lowercase for the guess.

But note: the instruction says ""Guess: <guess>stoic</guess>"" in the example, which is in lowercase. So I'll use lowercase.

However, in the current situation, we are to make a guess. And the word is ""pocky"".

So I'll go with ""pocky"".

But let me confirm: is ""pocky"" a valid word? Yes, it means something that pokes or prods.

So the guess is ""pocky"".

But we are not sure if it's the word. We are just guessing to get more information.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests more letters? But we only have two positions to fill (positions 1,4,5) and we know positions 2 and 3 are O and C. So we have to guess a word that fits the pattern.

And ""pocky"" is a valid word that fits: P O C K Y -> positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:C, 4:K, 5:Y.

And it uses P, K, Y which are available.

So we'll do that.

But note: we are also testing P, K, Y. If we get feedback that they are present or absent, we can narrow down.

So the guess is ""pocky"".

But let me see if there is another word. 

What about ""BOWCY""? Not a word.

""COCKY"" -> C in position 1 -> invalid.

""DOCKY"" -> not a word.

""FOCAL"" -> A excluded.

So I think ""pocky"" is the only common word that fits.

Therefore, we guess ""pocky"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **O** is confirmed in position 2 (from ""locum"" feedback: O(✓)).
- **C** is confirmed in position 3 (from ""locum"" feedback: C(✓)).
- The secret word pattern is: _ O C _ _
- Absent letters: R, A, N, E, S, T, I, L, U, M (from all feedback).
- Present letters: O (position 2), C (position 3), and one unknown letter (position 1, 4, or 5).

We need to fill positions 1, 4, and 5 with letters not in the absent list. Possible candidates include:
- **POCKY**: Uses P, K, Y (available letters). 
- Other options like ""YOCRY"" or ""BOCKY"" are invalid words. ""POCKY"" is a valid English word (meaning cheeky or mischievous).

This guess tests P, K, and Y in positions 1, 4, and 5, which could help identify the remaining letters.

<guess>pocky</guess>",pocky,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(-), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x)
  - C is present but not in position 1.
  - R, A, N, E are absent.

Guess 2: ""stoic"" -> S(x), T(x), O(-), I(x), C(-)
  - S, T, I are absent.
  - O is present but not in position 3.
  - C is present but not in position 5.

Guess 3: ""locum"" -> L(x), O(✓), C(✓), U(x), M(x)
  - L, U, M are absent.
  - O is correct in position 2 (so the secret word has O in the second position).
  - C is correct in position 3 (so the secret word has C in the third position).

So now we know:
- The secret word has O in position 2 and C in position 3.
- Therefore, the word pattern is: _ O C _ _
- We also know that the letters R, A, N, E, S, T, I, L, U, M are absent.

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits: _ O C _ _
- The first and last two positions (positions 1, 4, and 5) must be filled with letters that are not in the absent list.
- The word must be composed of available letters: from the remaining alphabet excluding R, A, N, E, S, T, I, L, U, M.

Available letters (consonants and vowels): 
Vowels: O is already placed, and we know A, E, I, U are absent. So the only vowel left is possibly Y (and sometimes W, but less common). 
Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We have to fill positions 1, 4, and 5.

We also know that the word must contain only letters that are not excluded.

Let's list the absent letters: A, E, I, L, M, N, R, S, T, U.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, P, V, W, Y, and possibly Y as a vowel.

Now, we need to form a word: [letter1] O C [letter4] [letter5]

We have to choose letter1, letter4, and letter5 from the available letters.

Common words that fit this pattern? 

- Words ending with Y: e.g., ""COCOA"" -> but 5 letters? ""COCOA"" is 5 letters: C O C O A -> but we have C in position 3, so position 1 would be C? But we know C is in position 3, so position 1 cannot be C (because if it were, it would be a duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback, we haven't seen any duplicate so far, but it's possible).

But note: in ""locum"", we had C in position 3 and it was correct. If the word had two C's, then in ""stoic"" we had C in position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. But now we have C in position 3. So if the word has two C's, then in ""stoic"" the C in position 5 would be one of the C's? But we don't know. However, we haven't seen evidence of duplicates.

But to be safe, we should consider the possibility of duplicates. However, we have no indication so far.

Given the pattern _ O C _ _, and the available letters, let's think of words:

- ""BLOCK"" -> but B L O C K: L is excluded (from guess 3) -> invalid.
- ""CLOCK"" -> C in position 1? We cannot, and also L is excluded.
- ""FOCUS"" -> F O C U S -> but U and S are excluded (from guess 3) -> invalid.
- ""LOCUS"" -> L and S excluded -> invalid.
- ""POCKS"" -> P O C K S -> S excluded -> invalid.
- ""YOCKS"" -> S excluded -> invalid.

Now, with the available letters, what can we have?

We need to use letters from: B, D, F, G, H, K, P, V, W, Y.

Let's try to form words:

- Position 1: B, D, F, G, H, K, P, V, W, Y
- Position 4: same set
- Position 5: same set
