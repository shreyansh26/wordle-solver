For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters and letter positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English (like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I) and avoid repeating letters to test more unique characters. 

Common starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it includes S (common in 5-letter words), L, A, T, and E - all very frequent letters in English. It also covers different positions well (S at start, E at end). I'll go with SLATE as my first guess.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 (S _ _ _ _)
- T is correct in position 4 (_ _ _ T _)
- E is in the word but not in position 5
- L and A are not in the word at all

So the pattern we have so far is:
S _ _ T _
and we know the word contains E somewhere other than the last position.

Possible positions for E: 2, 3, or 4. But position 4 is already T, so E must be in 2 or 3.

Let’s try to fill in the blanks with letters we haven’t ruled out yet. We should avoid L and A. We also know E must appear once more (since it was only marked “-” not “✓”).

A good next guess would test new common letters while placing E in one of the two possible slots. Words like:
- SHUTE (but U is less common)
- STENT (but N is already ruled out indirectly)
- STOLE (but O and L are ruled out indirectly)
- STEAK (but A is ruled out)

Actually, let’s think systematically. We need:
S _ _ T _
with E in 2 or 3, and no L or A.

Option 1: E in position 2 → S E _ T _
Option 2: E in position 3 → S _ E T _

For option 1, possible letters for position 3: common ones not yet used (R, N, I, O, etc.)
For option 2, possible letters for position 2: same set.

Let’s pick a word that fits option 1: S E _ T _. A good candidate is “SEWER” but W hasn’t been tested yet. However, we don’t know if W is in the word. Another option is “SEPTA” but A is ruled out. “SEPTO” is 5 letters but O hasn’t been ruled out.

Actually, let’s go with “SEWER” because it introduces W and R, both common, and keeps to the S E _ T _ pattern. But wait, that would be S E W T E, which has E twice—maybe not ideal since we only know one E exists.

Better: “SEPTU” is 5 letters but U is less common. Let’s instead pick “SEWER” but adjust to avoid double E. Actually, “SEWER” is fine because the second E would just confirm another E, but we might not need that.

Let’s switch to option 2: S _ E T _. A good word here is “SHEET” but that has double E. “SHETT” isn’t valid. “SKEET” uses K and E, but K is less common. “SMELT” uses M, E, L—but L is ruled out. “SPENT” uses P, E, N, T. P and N are good untested letters.

“SPENT” fits:
S P E N T
- S ✓ pos 1
- P new
- E in pos 3
- N new
- T ✓ pos 4
And it avoids L and A. This seems like a strong next guess.

Let's digest the new feedback from SPENT:

S(✓) – still correct in position 1  
P(x) – P is not in the word  
E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 3  
N(x) – N is not in the word  
T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 4  

Combining with the earlier feedback:

1. Word pattern: S _ _ _ _ (S locked in position 1)  
2. T must appear somewhere other than position 4.  
3. E must appear somewhere other than positions 3 or 5.  
4. Letters ruled out so far: L, A, P, N  
5. Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we’ll focus on common ones).

Possible positions for E: 2 or 4 (since 3 and 5 are excluded).  
Possible positions for T: 2, 3, or 5 (since 4 is excluded).

Let’s try to place E in position 2 and T in position 5, giving the pattern:

S E _ _ T

We need two more letters (positions 3 and 4) that haven’t been ruled out and are common. Good candidates: R, O, I, K, M, etc.

A common word fitting this is “SERIT” (but that’s not valid).  
“SEIRT” – invalid.  
“SEWER” – W and R are still possible, but we’d have double E if we put E in 2 and 4.  

Wait, we can only have one E. Let’s try:

S E R _ T → “SERIT” invalid  
S E C _ T → “SECT” + T → “SECTT” invalid.  

Better: S E C K T → “SECKT” invalid.  

Let’s instead put T in position 3 and E in position 2:

S E T _ _

We need a valid 5-letter word: S E T _ _.  
Possible: “SETON” – but N is ruled out.  
“SETAR” – A is ruled out.  
“SETIC” – I and C are possible.  
“SETOR” – O and R possible.  

“SETOR” is valid (variant of “setter” or “septor”).  

But let’s pick a more common word: “SEWER” has E in 2 and 5, but 5 is excluded for E.  

Alternative pattern: S _ _ T E – but E can’t be in 5.  

Another pattern: S _ T _ E – again E can’t be in 5.  

Let’s try S _ _ T _ with T in 4 excluded, so T must be in 2 or 3.  

Let’s try T in 2: S T _ _ _  
E must be in 3 or 4.  

Common word: S T E _ _ → “STEIN” – N ruled out.  
“STEAK” – A ruled out.  
“STEER” – E in 3 and 5, 5 excluded.  

T in 3: S _ T _ _  
E must be in 2 or 4.  

Word: S _ T _ _  
E in 2: S E T _ _ → “SETO?” – “SETON” N ruled out.  
E in 4: S _ T E _ → “SMOTE” – O and M possible, but W not ruled out yet.  

“SMOTE” is valid.  

Let’s choose “SMOTE”:
- S ✓ pos 1  
- M new  
- O new  
- T in pos 4 (but earlier T was ✓ in pos 4 from SLATE, but feedback for SPENT says T(-) – meaning T is in word but not in pos 4. So T cannot be in pos 4. Thus “SMOTE” is invalid for T placement.  

Back to drawing board.  

We need:
S _ _ _ _  
T somewhere not pos 4  
E somewhere not pos 3 or 5

S(✓) – still correct in position 1  
P(x) – P is not in the word  
E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 3  
N(x) – N is not in the word  
T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 4  

Combining with the earlier feedback:

1. Word pattern: S _ _ _ _ (S locked in position 1)  
2. T must appear somewhere other than position 4.  
3. E must appear somewhere other than positions 3 or 5.  
4. Letters ruled out so far: L, A, P, N  
5. Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we’ll focus on common ones).

Possible positions for E: 2 or 4 (since 3 and 5 are excluded).  
Possible positions for T: 2, 3, or 5 (since 4 is excluded).

Let’s try to place E in position 2 and T in position 5, giving the pattern:

S E _ _ T

We need two more letters (positions 3 and 4) that haven’t been ruled out and are common. Good candidates: R, O, I, K, M, etc.

A common word fitting this is “SERIT” (but that’s not valid).  
“SEIRT” – invalid.  
“SEWER” – W and R are still possible, but we’d have double E if we put E in 2 and 4.  

Wait, we can only have one E. Let’s try:

S E R _ T → “SERIT” invalid  
S E C _ T → “SECT” + T → “SECTT” invalid.  

Better: S E C K T → “SECKT” invalid.  

Let’s instead put T in position 3 and E in position 2:

S E T _ _

We need a valid 5-letter word: S E T _ _.  
Possible: “SETON” – but N is ruled out.  
“SETAR” – A is ruled out.  
“SETIC” – I and C are possible.  
“SETOR” – O and R possible.  

“SETOR” is valid (variant of “setter” or “septor”).  

But let’s pick a more common word: “SEWER” has E in 2 and 5, but 5 is excluded for E.  

Alternative pattern: S _ _ T E – but E can’t be in 5.  

Another pattern: S _ T _ E – again E can’t be in 5.  

Let’s try S _ _ T _ with T in 4 excluded, so T must be in 2 or 3.  

Let’s try T in 2: S T _ _ _  
E must be in 3 or 4.  

Common word: S T E _ _ → “STEIN” – N ruled out.  
“STEAK” – A ruled out.  
“STEER” – E in 3 and 5, 5 excluded.  

T in 3: S _ T _ _  
E must be in 2 or 4.  

Word: S _ T _ _  
E in 2: S E T _ _ → “SETO?” – “SETON” N ruled out.  
E in 4: S _ T E _ → “SMOTE” – O and M possible, but W not ruled out yet.  

“SMOTE” is valid.  

Let’s choose “SMOTE”:
- S ✓ pos 1  
- M new  
- O new  
- T in pos 4 (but earlier T was ✓ in pos 4 from SLATE, but feedback for SPENT says T(-) – meaning T is in word but not in pos 4. So T cannot be in pos 4. Thus “SMOTE” is invalid for T placement.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters and letter positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English (like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I) and avoid repeating letters to test more unique characters. 

Common starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it includes S (common in 5-letter words), L, A, T, and E - all very frequent letters in English. It also covers different positions well (S at start, E at end). I'll go with SLATE as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 (S _ _ _ _)
- T is correct in position 4 (_ _ _ T _)
- E is in the word but not in position 5
- L and A are not in the word at all

So the pattern we have so far is:
S _ _ T _
and we know the word contains E somewhere other than the last position.

Possible positions for E: 2, 3, or 4. But position 4 is already T, so E must be in 2 or 3.

Let’s try to fill in the blanks with letters we haven’t ruled out yet. We should avoid L and A. We also know E must appear once more (since it was only marked “-” not “✓”).

A good next guess would test new common letters while placing E in one of the two possible slots. Words like:
- SHUTE (but U is less common)
- STENT (but N is already ruled out indirectly)
- STOLE (but O and L are ruled out indirectly)
- STEAK (but A is ruled out)

Actually, let’s think systematically. We need:
S _ _ T _
with E in 2 or 3, and no L or A.

Option 1: E in position 2 → S E _ T _
Option 2: E in position 3 → S _ E T _

For option 1, possible letters for position 3: common ones not yet used (R, N, I, O, etc.)
For option 2, possible letters for position 2: same set.

Let’s pick a word that fits option 1: S E _ T _. A good candidate is “SEWER” but W hasn’t been tested yet. However, we don’t know if W is in the word. Another option is “SEPTA” but A is ruled out. “SEPTO” is 5 letters but O hasn’t been ruled out.

Actually, let’s go with “SEWER” because it introduces W and R, both common, and keeps to the S E _ T _ pattern. But wait, that would be S E W T E, which has E twice—maybe not ideal since we only know one E exists.

Better: “SEPTU” is 5 letters but U is less common. Let’s instead pick “SEWER” but adjust to avoid double E. Actually, “SEWER” is fine because the second E would just confirm another E, but we might not need that.

Let’s switch to option 2: S _ E T _. A good word here is “SHEET” but that has double E. “SHETT” isn’t valid. “SKEET” uses K and E, but K is less common. “SMELT” uses M, E, L—but L is ruled out. “SPENT” uses P, E, N, T. P and N are good untested letters.

“SPENT” fits:
S P E N T
- S ✓ pos 1
- P new
- E in pos 3
- N new
- T ✓ pos 4
And it avoids L and A. This seems like a strong next guess.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

1. S is fixed in position 1: S _ _ _ _
2. T is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 4 (from SPENT and STOKE feedback).
   Therefore T must be in position 3 or 5.
3. E is in the word but NOT in positions 3, 4, or 5 (from SPENT and STOKE feedback).
   Therefore E must be in position 2.
4. Letters already ruled out: L, A, P, N, O, K.

So the pattern is now:
S E T _ _   (if T is in position 3)
or
S E _ _ T   (if T is in position 5)

Common 5-letter words that fit:

- S E T _ _ : “SETON” (N ruled out), “SETAR” (A ruled out), “SETIC” (valid but uncommon), “SETHS” (invalid).
- S E _ _ T : “SEWER” (W and R possible), “SEMIT” (M and I possible), “SECTS” (C ruled out? No, C still allowed).

Among these, “SEWER” and “SEMIT” stand out. “SEWER” uses W and R which are still allowed and common. Let’s pick that.

Pattern check:
S E W E R – but this has E in 2 and 4, and we know E must be only in 2. So invalid.

Next, “SEMIT”:
S E M I T – E in 2, T in 5, M and I new. Valid.

Another candidate: “SECTS” – but C and S, and S is already used. Also E would be in 2, T in 5, but C is allowed. However “SECTS” is valid.

Between “SEMIT” and “SECTS”, “SECTS” is more common.

Let’s go with “SECTS”:
- S ✓ pos 1
- E in pos 2
- C new
- T in pos 5
- S in pos 5 – but we already have S in pos 1, and letters can repeat. However we have no info against S repeating. But “SECTS” is valid.

Actually, let’s check for a word with T in pos 3 instead. The only common word seems to be “SETON” but N is ruled out. So T must be in pos 5.

Thus, the word must be S E _ _ T with E in 2 and T in 5, and positions 3 and 4 to be filled with new allowed letters.

Possible: S E C K T – but K ruled out.  
S E C R T – “SECRT” invalid.  
S E C L T – L ruled out.  
S E C H T – “SECHT” invalid.  
S E C M T – “SECMT” invalid.  

The only valid common word seems to be “SEWER” but that has E in 4 which is invalid.  

Wait, let’s list allowed letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, M, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two letters from these for positions 3 and 4, forming a valid word with S E _ _ T.

Valid words:
- S E C T S – but S already in 1, and T in 5, E in 2. This is “SECTS”.
- S E R T S – “SERTS” invalid.
- S E M I T – “SEMIT”.
- S E W E T – invalid E in 4.
- S E W I T – “SEWIT” invalid.
- S E R T E – invalid E in 5.

The two valid candidates are “SECTS” and “SEMIT”. Between them, “SECTS” is more common.

But let’s verify “SECTS”:
- S E C T S
- S in 1 ✓
- E in 2 ✓
- C new
- T in 5 ✓
- S in 5 – no rule against repeats.

Thus, “SECTS” is a valid next guess.

<guess>SECTS</guess>",SECTS,"Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

1. S is fixed in position 1: S _ _ _ _
2. T is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 4 (from SPENT and STOKE feedback).
   Therefore T must be in position 3 or 5.
3. E is in the word but NOT in positions 3, 4, or 5 (from SPENT and STOKE feedback).
   Therefore E must be in position 2.
4. Letters already ruled out: L, A, P, N, O, K.

So the pattern is now:
S E T _ _   (if T is in position 3)
or
S E _ _ T   (if T is in position 5)

Common 5-letter words that fit:

- S E T _ _ : “SETON” (N ruled out), “SETAR” (A ruled out), “SETIC” (valid but uncommon), “SETHS” (invalid).
- S E _ _ T : “SEWER” (W and R possible), “SEMIT” (M and I possible), “SECTS” (C ruled out? No, C still allowed).

Among these, “SEWER” and “SEMIT” stand out. “SEWER” uses W and R which are still allowed and common. Let’s pick that.

Pattern check:
S E W E R – but this has E in 2 and 4, and we know E must be only in 2. So invalid.

Next, “SEMIT”:
S E M I T – E in 2, T in 5, M and I new. Valid.

Another candidate: “SECTS” – but C and S, and S is already used. Also E would be in 2, T in 5, but C is allowed. However “SECTS” is valid.

Between “SEMIT” and “SECTS”, “SECTS” is more common.

Let’s go with “SECTS”:
- S ✓ pos 1
- E in pos 2
- C new
- T in pos 5
- S in pos 5 – but we already have S in pos 1, and letters can repeat. However we have no info against S repeating. But “SECTS” is valid.

Actually, let’s check for a word with T in pos 3 instead. The only common word seems to be “SETON” but N is ruled out. So T must be in pos 5.

Thus, the word must be S E _ _ T with E in 2 and T in 5, and positions 3 and 4 to be filled with new allowed letters.

Possible: S E C K T – but K ruled out.  
S E C R T – “SECRT” invalid.  
S E C L T – L ruled out.  
S E C H T – “SECHT” invalid.  
S E C M T – “SECMT” invalid.  

The only valid common word seems to be “SEWER” but that has E in 4 which is invalid.  

Wait, let’s list allowed letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, M, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two letters from these for positions 3 and 4, forming a valid word with S E _ _ T.

Valid words:

- S E W I T – “SEWIT” invalid.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters and letter positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English (like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I) and avoid repeating letters to test more unique characters. 

Common starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it includes S (common in 5-letter words), L, A, T, and E - all very frequent letters in English. It also covers different positions well (S at start, E at end). I'll go with SLATE as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 (S _ _ _ _)
- T is correct in position 4 (_ _ _ T _)
- E is in the word but not in position 5
- L and A are not in the word at all

So the pattern we have so far is:
S _ _ T _
and we know the word contains E somewhere other than the last position.

Possible positions for E: 2, 3, or 4. But position 4 is already T, so E must be in 2 or 3.

Let’s try to fill in the blanks with letters we haven’t ruled out yet. We should avoid L and A. We also know E must appear once more (since it was only marked “-” not “✓”).

A good next guess would test new common letters while placing E in one of the two possible slots. Words like:
- SHUTE (but U is less common)
- STENT (but N is already ruled out indirectly)
- STOLE (but O and L are ruled out indirectly)
- STEAK (but A is ruled out)

Actually, let’s think systematically. We need:
S _ _ T _
with E in 2 or 3, and no L or A.

Option 1: E in position 2 → S E _ T _
Option 2: E in position 3 → S _ E T _

For option 1, possible letters for position 3: common ones not yet used (R, N, I, O, etc.)
For option 2, possible letters for position 2: same set.

Let’s pick a word that fits option 1: S E _ T _. A good candidate is “SEWER” but W hasn’t been tested yet. However, we don’t know if W is in the word. Another option is “SEPTA” but A is ruled out. “SEPTO” is 5 letters but O hasn’t been ruled out.

Actually, let’s go with “SEWER” because it introduces W and R, both common, and keeps to the S E _ T _ pattern. But wait, that would be S E W T E, which has E twice—maybe not ideal since we only know one E exists.

Better: “SEPTU” is 5 letters but U is less common. Let’s instead pick “SEWER” but adjust to avoid double E. Actually, “SEWER” is fine because the second E would just confirm another E, but we might not need that.

Let’s switch to option 2: S _ E T _. A good word here is “SHEET” but that has double E. “SHETT” isn’t valid. “SKEET” uses K and E, but K is less common. “SMELT” uses M, E, L—but L is ruled out. “SPENT” uses P, E, N, T. P and N are good untested letters.

“SPENT” fits:
S P E N T
- S ✓ pos 1
- P new
- E in pos 3
- N new
- T ✓ pos 4
And it avoids L and A. This seems like a strong next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(-)
Guess 2: SPENT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) E(-) N(x) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's digest the new feedback from SPENT:

S(✓) – still correct in position 1  
P(x) – P is not in the word  
E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 3  
N(x) – N is not in the word  
T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 4  

Combining with the earlier feedback:

1. Word pattern: S _ _ _ _ (S locked in position 1)  
2. T must appear somewhere other than position 4.  
3. E must appear somewhere other than positions 3 or 5.  
4. Letters ruled out so far: L, A, P, N  
5. Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we’ll focus on common ones).

Possible positions for E: 2 or 4 (since 3 and 5 are excluded).  
Possible positions for T: 2, 3, or 5 (since 4 is excluded).

Let’s try to place E in position 2 and T in position 5, giving the pattern:

S E _ _ T

We need two more letters (positions 3 and 4) that haven’t been ruled out and are common. Good candidates: R, O, I, K, M, etc.

A common word fitting this is “SERIT” (but that’s not valid).  
“SEIRT” – invalid.  
“SEWER” – W and R are still possible, but we’d have double E if we put E in 2 and 4.  

Wait, we can only have one E. Let’s try:

S E R _ T → “SERIT” invalid  
S E C _ T → “SECT” + T → “SECTT” invalid.  

Better: S E C K T → “SECKT” invalid.  

Let’s instead put T in position 3 and E in position 2:

S E T _ _

We need a valid 5-letter word: S E T _ _.  
Possible: “SETON” – but N is ruled out.  
“SETAR” – A is ruled out.  
“SETIC” – I and C are possible.  
“SETOR” – O and R possible.  

“SETOR” is valid (variant of “setter” or “septor”).  

But let’s pick a more common word: “SEWER” has E in 2 and 5, but 5 is excluded for E.  

Alternative pattern: S _ _ T E – but E can’t be in 5.  

Another pattern: S _ T _ E – again E can’t be in 5.  

Let’s try S _ _ T _ with T in 4 excluded, so T must be in 2 or 3.  

Let’s try T in 2: S T _ _ _  
E must be in 3 or 4.  

Common word: S T E _ _ → “STEIN” – N ruled out.  
“STEAK” – A ruled out.  
“STEER” – E in 3 and 5, 5 excluded.  

T in 3: S _ T _ _  
E must be in 2 or 4.  

Word: S _ T _ _  
E in 2: S E T _ _ → “SETO?” – “SETON” N ruled out.  
E in 4: S _ T E _ → “SMOTE” – O and M possible, but W not ruled out yet.  

“SMOTE” is valid.  

Let’s choose “SMOTE”:
- S ✓ pos 1  
- M new  
- O new  
- T in pos 4 (but earlier T was ✓ in pos 4 from SLATE, but feedback for SPENT says T(-) – meaning T is in word but not in pos 4. So T cannot be in pos 4. Thus “SMOTE” is invalid for T placement.  

Back to drawing board.  

We need:
S _ _ _ _  
T somewhere not pos 4  
E somewhere not pos 3 or 5  

Let’s try E in 2 and T in 5:  
S E _ _ T  

Valid word: “SEWIT” – but W and I are possible.  
“SEWIT” is valid.  

But let’s pick a more common word: “SEWER” has E in 2 and 5, but 5 is excluded for E.  

Next idea: E in 4 and T in 2:  
S T _ E _  

Valid word: “STREE” – double E not needed.  
“STOKE” – O, K possible.  
“STOKE” is valid.  

Let’s choose “STOKE”:
- S ✓ pos 1  
- T in pos 2 (allowed)  
- O new  
- K new  
- E in pos 4 (allowed)  

No ruled-out letters used.

1. S is fixed in position 1: S _ _ _ _
2. T is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 4 (from SPENT and STOKE feedback).

So the pattern is now:

or
S E _ _ T   (if T is in position 5)

Common 5-letter words that fit:

- S E T _ _ : “SETON” (N ruled out), “SETAR” (A ruled out), “SETIC” (valid but uncommon), “SETHS” (invalid).
- S E _ _ T : “SEWER” (W and R possible), “SEMIT” (M and I possible), “SECTS” (C ruled out? No, C still allowed).

Among these, “SEWER” and “SEMIT” stand out. “SEWER” uses W and R which are still allowed and common. Let’s pick that.

S E W E R – but this has E in 2 and 4, and we know E must be only in 2. So invalid.

Next, “SEMIT”:

Another candidate: “SECTS” – but C and S, and S is already used. Also E would be in 2, T in 5, but C is allowed. However “SECTS” is valid.

Between “SEMIT” and “SECTS”, “SECTS” is more common.

Thus, the word must be S E _ _ T with E in 2 and T in 5, and positions 3 and 4 to be filled with new allowed letters.

Possible: S E C K T – but K ruled out.  
S E C R T – “SECRT” invalid.  
S E C L T – L ruled out.  
S E C H T – “SECHT” invalid.  
S E C M T – “SECMT” invalid.  

The only valid common word seems to be “SEWER” but that has E in 4 which is invalid.  

Wait, let’s list allowed letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, M, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two letters from these for positions 3 and 4, forming a valid word with S E _ _ T.

Valid words:
- S E C T S – but S already in 1, and T in 5, E in 2. This is “SECTS”.
- S E R T S – “SERTS” invalid.
- S E M I T – “SEMIT”.
- S E W E T – invalid E in 4.
- S E W I T – “SEWIT” invalid.
- S E R T E – invalid E in 5.

The two valid candidates are “SECTS” and “SEMIT”. Between them, “SECTS” is more common.

But let’s verify “SECTS”:
- S E C T S
- S in 1 ✓
- E in 2 ✓
- C new
- T in 5 ✓
- S in 5 – no rule against repeats.

Thus, “SECTS” is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters and letter positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English (like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I) and avoid repeating letters to test more unique characters. 

Common starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it includes S (common in 5-letter words), L, A, T, and E - all very frequent letters in English. It also covers different positions well (S at start, E at end). I'll go with SLATE as my first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 (S _ _ _ _)
- T is correct in position 4 (_ _ _ T _)
- E is in the word but not in position 5
- L and A are not in the word at all

So the pattern we have so far is:
S _ _ T _
and we know the word contains E somewhere other than the last position.

Possible positions for E: 2, 3, or 4. But position 4 is already T, so E must be in 2 or 3.

Let’s try to fill in the blanks with letters we haven’t ruled out yet. We should avoid L and A. We also know E must appear once more (since it was only marked “-” not “✓”).

A good next guess would test new common letters while placing E in one of the two possible slots. Words like:
- SHUTE (but U is less common)
- STENT (but N is already ruled out indirectly)
- STOLE (but O and L are ruled out indirectly)
- STEAK (but A is ruled out)

Actually, let’s think systematically. We need:
S _ _ T _
with E in 2 or 3, and no L or A.

Option 1: E in position 2 → S E _ T _
Option 2: E in position 3 → S _ E T _

For option 1, possible letters for position 3: common ones not yet used (R, N, I, O, etc.)
For option 2, possible letters for position 2: same set.

Let’s pick a word that fits option 1: S E _ T _. A good candidate is “SEWER” but W hasn’t been tested yet. However, we don’t know if W is in the word. Another option is “SEPTA” but A is ruled out. “SEPTO” is 5 letters but O hasn’t been ruled out.

Actually, let’s go with “SEWER” because it introduces W and R, both common, and keeps to the S E _ T _ pattern. But wait, that would be S E W T E, which has E twice—maybe not ideal since we only know one E exists.

Better: “SEPTU” is 5 letters but U is less common. Let’s instead pick “SEWER” but adjust to avoid double E. Actually, “SEWER” is fine because the second E would just confirm another E, but we might not need that.

Let’s switch to option 2: S _ E T _. A good word here is “SHEET” but that has double E. “SHETT” isn’t valid. “SKEET” uses K and E, but K is less common. “SMELT” uses M, E, L—but L is ruled out. “SPENT” uses P, E, N, T. P and N are good untested letters.

“SPENT” fits:
S P E N T
- S ✓ pos 1
- P new
- E in pos 3
- N new
- T ✓ pos 4
And it avoids L and A. This seems like a strong next guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: SPENT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) E(-) N(x) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's digest the new feedback from SPENT:

S(✓) – still correct in position 1  
P(x) – P is not in the word  
E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 3  
N(x) – N is not in the word  
T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 4  

Combining with the earlier feedback:

1. Word pattern: S _ _ _ _ (S locked in position 1)  
2. T must appear somewhere other than position 4.  
3. E must appear somewhere other than positions 3 or 5.  
4. Letters ruled out so far: L, A, P, N  
5. Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we’ll focus on common ones).

Possible positions for E: 2 or 4 (since 3 and 5 are excluded).  
Possible positions for T: 2, 3, or 5 (since 4 is excluded).

Let’s try to place E in position 2 and T in position 5, giving the pattern:

S E _ _ T

We need two more letters (positions 3 and 4) that haven’t been ruled out and are common. Good candidates: R, O, I, K, M, etc.

A common word fitting this is “SERIT” (but that’s not valid).  
“SEIRT” – invalid.  
“SEWER” – W and R are still possible, but we’d have double E if we put E in 2 and 4.  

Wait, we can only have one E. Let’s try:

S E R _ T → “SERIT” invalid  
S E C _ T → “SECT” + T → “SECTT” invalid.  

Better: S E C K T → “SECKT” invalid.  

Let’s instead put T in position 3 and E in position 2:

S E T _ _

We need a valid 5-letter word: S E T _ _.  
Possible: “SETON” – but N is ruled out.  
“SETAR” – A is ruled out.  
“SETIC” – I and C are possible.  
“SETOR” – O and R possible.  

“SETOR” is valid (variant of “setter” or “septor”).  

But let’s pick a more common word: “SEWER” has E in 2 and 5, but 5 is excluded for E.  

Alternative pattern: S _ _ T E – but E can’t be in 5.  

Another pattern: S _ T _ E – again E can’t be in 5.  

Let’s try S _ _ T _ with T in 4 excluded, so T must be in 2 or 3.  

Let’s try T in 2: S T _ _ _  
E must be in 3 or 4.  

Common word: S T E _ _ → “STEIN” – N ruled out.  
“STEAK” – A ruled out.  
“STEER” – E in 3 and 5, 5 excluded.  

T in 3: S _ T _ _  
E must be in 2 or 4.  

Word: S _ T _ _  
E in 2: S E T _ _ → “SETO?” – “SETON” N ruled out.  
E in 4: S _ T E _ → “SMOTE” – O and M possible, but W not ruled out yet.  

“SMOTE” is valid.  

Let’s choose “SMOTE”:
- S ✓ pos 1  
- M new  
- O new  
- T in pos 4 (but earlier T was ✓ in pos 4 from SLATE, but feedback for SPENT says T(-) – meaning T is in word but not in pos 4. So T cannot be in pos 4. Thus “SMOTE” is invalid for T placement.  

Back to drawing board.  

We need:
S _ _ _ _  
T somewhere not pos 4  
E somewhere not pos 3 or 5  

Let’s try E in 2 and T in 5:  
S E _ _ T  

Valid word: “SEWIT” – but W and I are possible.  
“SEWIT” is valid.  

But let’s pick a more common word: “SEWER” has E in 2 and 5, but 5 is excluded for E.  

Next idea: E in 4 and T in 2:  
S T _ E _  

Valid word: “STREE” – double E not needed.  
“STOKE” – O, K possible.  
“STOKE” is valid.  

Let’s choose “STOKE”:
- S ✓ pos 1  
- T in pos 2 (allowed)  
- O new  
- K new  
- E in pos 4 (allowed)  

No ruled-out letters used.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

1. S is fixed in position 1: S _ _ _ _
2. T is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 4 (from SPENT and STOKE feedback).
   Therefore T must be in position 3 or 5.
3. E is in the word but NOT in positions 3, 4, or 5 (from SPENT and STOKE feedback).
   Therefore E must be in position 2.
4. Letters already ruled out: L, A, P, N, O, K.

So the pattern is now:
S E T _ _   (if T is in position 3)
or
S E _ _ T   (if T is in position 5)

Common 5-letter words that fit:

- S E T _ _ : “SETON” (N ruled out), “SETAR” (A ruled out), “SETIC” (valid but uncommon), “SETHS” (invalid).
- S E _ _ T : “SEWER” (W and R possible), “SEMIT” (M and I possible), “SECTS” (C ruled out? No, C still allowed).

Among these, “SEWER” and “SEMIT” stand out. “SEWER” uses W and R which are still allowed and common. Let’s pick that.

Pattern check:
S E W E R – but this has E in 2 and 4, and we know E must be only in 2. So invalid.

Next, “SEMIT”:
S E M I T – E in 2, T in 5, M and I new. Valid.

Another candidate: “SECTS” – but C and S, and S is already used. Also E would be in 2, T in 5, but C is allowed. However “SECTS” is valid.

Between “SEMIT” and “SECTS”, “SECTS” is more common.

Let’s go with “SECTS”:
- S ✓ pos 1
- E in pos 2
- C new
- T in pos 5
- S in pos 5 – but we already have S in pos 1, and letters can repeat. However we have no info against S repeating. But “SECTS” is valid.

Actually, let’s check for a word with T in pos 3 instead. The only common word seems to be “SETON” but N is ruled out. So T must be in pos 5.

Thus, the word must be S E _ _ T with E in 2 and T in 5, and positions 3 and 4 to be filled with new allowed letters.

Possible: S E C K T – but K ruled out.  
S E C R T – “SECRT” invalid.  
S E C L T – L ruled out.  
S E C H T – “SECHT” invalid.  
S E C M T – “SECMT” invalid.  

The only valid common word seems to be “SEWER” but that has E in 4 which is invalid.  

Wait, let’s list allowed letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, M, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two letters from these for positions 3 and 4, forming a valid word with S E _ _ T.

Valid words:
- S E C T S – but S already in 1, and T in 5, E in 2. This is “SECTS”.
- S E R T S – “SERTS” invalid.
- S E M I T – “SEMIT”.
- S E W E T – invalid E in 4.
- S E W I T – “SEWIT” invalid.
- S E R T E – invalid E in 5.

The two valid candidates are “SECTS” and “SEMIT”. Between them, “SECTS” is more common.

But let’s verify “SECTS”:
- S E C T S
- S in 1 ✓
- E in 2 ✓
- C new
- T in 5 ✓
- S in 5 – no rule against repeats.

Thus, “SECTS” is a valid next guess.

S E R T S is not valid, but S E T T S is not valid either.  
The correct word is S E R T S, but we already tried that.  

Upon careful recheck, the only valid word fitting this pattern is:

S E R T S – but we already used that.  

Hold on, let’s list all valid English words ending in “ETS”:

- LEETS – starts with L (invalid)  
- MEETS – starts with M  
- REETS – starts with R  
- SEETS – starts with S (but S already in 1, and “SEETS” is not a standard word)  

The actual valid word is “REETS”, but R has not been ruled out yet.  

Let’s verify “REETS”:

R has never been guessed before, so it’s still allowed.  
Pattern: S E R T S – matches all feedback.

Thus, the correct word must be “REETS”.

Current pattern (from SECTS and REETS feedback):

- Position 2: E ✓
- Position 3: unknown, but must be a letter not yet ruled out (not L, A, P, N, O, K, C, R)
- Position 4: T ✓
- Position 5: S ✓

So the word is: S E _ T S

Letters already eliminated from position 3: L, A, P, N, O, K, C, R

Remaining common consonants for position 3: B, D, F, G, H, M, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for valid 5-letter English words that fit S E _ T S:

- S E B T S – invalid
- S E D T S – invalid
- S E F T S – invalid
- S E G T S – invalid
- S E H T S – invalid
- S E M T S – invalid
- S E V T S – invalid
- S E W T S – invalid
- S E Y T S – invalid

The only valid English word that matches this pattern is:

S E T T S – but this repeats T in positions 3 and 4, and T is already in position 4. However, letters can repeat in different positions.

Checking dictionaries, ""SETTS"" is a valid variant spelling (though rare), but more commonly ""SEATS"" comes to mind, but A is ruled out.

Upon closer inspection, the correct and only valid word fitting S E _ T S is:

S E T T S – ""SETTS""

But ""SETTS"" is valid (plural of ""set"" in some contexts).

However, let's verify:

- S E T T S: positions 1-5: S, E, T, T, S
- T in position 3 is allowed (no feedback against it)
- All other constraints satisfied

Thus, the word must be ""SETTS"".
