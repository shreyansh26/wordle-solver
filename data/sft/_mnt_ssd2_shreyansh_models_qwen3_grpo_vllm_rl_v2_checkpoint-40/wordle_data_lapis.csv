For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The goal is to maximize information gain by covering frequently used vowels and consonants. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters like A, E, R, S, T, N, etc.

Some excellent starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give us good information about which of these letters are in the secret word and their positions.

- C: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)
- N: not in the word (x)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:

2. The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.
3. We still have 21 other letters (from the alphabet excluding C, R, N, E) that could be in the word.

Since A is confirmed, I should try to place A in a different position and introduce new common consonants and vowels. Good remaining consonants to test include S, T, L, D, M, P, B, etc. Vowels left to test include I, O, U.

A word that uses A in a different position and introduces several new common letters is ""STOMA"":
- S, T, O, M are all new letters not tested before.
- A is moved to the 5th position (was 3rd in CRANE).

This gives us information on 4 new letters and re-tests A in a new spot.

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, T, O, M  
2. The letter A IS in the word, but it is NOT in position 3 or 5 (it was marked “-” in both places).  
3. The letter S is in the word but in the wrong position (position 1 in STOMA).  

Therefore:
- A must be in position 1, 2, or 4.  
- S must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.  
- Remaining unused common letters to test next include D, L, I, U, B, G, H, K, P, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
- Place A in a new position (say position 2).  
- Place S in a new position (say position 4).  
- Introduce several new, high-frequency consonants and vowels.

A word that satisfies these constraints is “SALID”:
- S is in position 1 (but we know S is not in position 1, so this is invalid).  
Oops, that violates the S placement.

From the feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, T, O, M, B  
Letters known to be in the word: A, S, I, L  
Positions fixed so far:
- A is in position 2 (✓)
- I is in position 4 (✓)

Remaining positions to fill: 1, 3, 5  
Constraints on remaining letters:
- S must be in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 5 (it was “-” in all those spots across the guesses).  
  Therefore S must be in position 2, but position 2 is already A.  
  This is impossible, so my earlier assumption must be wrong.

Wait: re-examine S placements:
- In STOMA (S at 1) → S(-) → S not in 1
- In BASIL (S at 3) → S(-) → S not in 3
So S cannot be in 1 or 3.  
But positions 2,4,5 are already partially filled:
- 2 = A
- 4 = I
So S has nowhere left to go. This contradiction shows S must be in position 5, but we have L(-) in position 5, meaning L is not in 5. Therefore S cannot be in 5 either. 

This implies S is not in the word, contradicting the earlier “-” (S is in word but wrong position). The only resolution is that S must be in position 5, despite L(-) in position 5. That means L is not in position 5, so S can be in 5.

Thus:
- 1: new letter (not C,R,N,E,T,O,M,B)
- 3: new letter (not C,R,N,E,T,O,M,B,S,A,I,L)
- 5: S

Let’s pick a word that fits:
- Pos 2 = A
- Pos 4 = I
- Pos 5 = S
- Pos 1 and 3 from remaining letters.

A good candidate is “FAIRY”:
- F (new), A (fixed), I (fixed), R (but R is excluded), Y (new) – R is excluded, so invalid.

Next try “GAISK” – but K is okay, but S must be in 5, so:
- 1: G
- 2: A
- 3: I (but I is fixed at 4) – invalid.

Correct structure:
- 1: ?

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The goal is to maximize information gain by covering frequently used vowels and consonants. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters like A, E, R, S, T, N, etc.

Some excellent starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give us good information about which of these letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)
- N: not in the word (x)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter A, but not in the 3rd position.
2. The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.
3. We still have 21 other letters (from the alphabet excluding C, R, N, E) that could be in the word.

Since A is confirmed, I should try to place A in a different position and introduce new common consonants and vowels. Good remaining consonants to test include S, T, L, D, M, P, B, etc. Vowels left to test include I, O, U.

A word that uses A in a different position and introduces several new common letters is ""STOMA"":
- S, T, O, M are all new letters not tested before.
- A is moved to the 5th position (was 3rd in CRANE).

This gives us information on 4 new letters and re-tests A in a new spot.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, T, O, M  
2. The letter A IS in the word, but it is NOT in position 3 or 5 (it was marked “-” in both places).  
3. The letter S is in the word but in the wrong position (position 1 in STOMA).  

Therefore:
- A must be in position 1, 2, or 4.  
- S must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.  
- Remaining unused common letters to test next include D, L, I, U, B, G, H, K, P, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
- Place A in a new position (say position 2).  
- Place S in a new position (say position 4).  
- Introduce several new, high-frequency consonants and vowels.

A word that satisfies these constraints is “SALID”:
- S is in position 1 (but we know S is not in position 1, so this is invalid).  
Oops, that violates the S placement.

Let’s try “BASIL”:
- A is in position 2 (allowed).  
- S is in position 3 (allowed).  
- B, I, L are new letters.

This seems valid.

From the feedback so far:

Positions fixed so far:
- A is in position 2 (✓)
- I is in position 4 (✓)

Remaining positions to fill: 1, 3, 5  
Constraints on remaining letters:
- S must be in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 5 (it was “-” in all those spots across the guesses).  
  Therefore S must be in position 2, but position 2 is already A.  
  This is impossible, so my earlier assumption must be wrong.

Wait: re-examine S placements:
- In STOMA (S at 1) → S(-) → S not in 1
- In BASIL (S at 3) → S(-) → S not in 3
So S cannot be in 1 or 3.  
But positions 2,4,5 are already partially filled:
- 2 = A
- 4 = I
So S has nowhere left to go. This contradiction shows S must be in position 5, but we have L(-) in position 5, meaning L is not in 5. Therefore S cannot be in 5 either. 

This implies S is not in the word, contradicting the earlier “-” (S is in word but wrong position). The only resolution is that S must be in position 5, despite L(-) in position 5. That means L is not in position 5, so S can be in 5.

Thus:
- 1: new letter (not C,R,N,E,T,O,M,B)
- 3: new letter (not C,R,N,E,T,O,M,B,S,A,I,L)
- 5: S

Common remaining consonants: D, F, G, H, K, P, U, V, W, Y  
Vowels left: U, Y (since A and I are used)

Let’s pick a word that fits:
- Pos 2 = A
- Pos 4 = I
- Pos 5 = S
- Pos 1 and 3 from remaining letters.

A good candidate is “FAIRY”:
- F (new), A (fixed), I (fixed), R (but R is excluded), Y (new) – R is excluded, so invalid.

Next try “GAISK” – but K is okay, but S must be in 5, so:
- 1: G
- 2: A
- 3: I (but I is fixed at 4) – invalid.

Correct structure:
- 1: ?

Let’s consolidate what we now know after four guesses.

Letters NOT in the word (✗):
C, R, N, E, T, O, M, B, D, Y

Letters that ARE in the word (✓):
A, S, I, L

Positional information:
- A is in position 2 (✓).
- I is somewhere in the word but NOT in position 4 (it was marked “-” in DAISY, position 3).
- S is somewhere in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (it was “-” in all those spots across the guesses).  
  Therefore S must be in position 2, but position 2 is already A.  
  This is impossible, so the only logical conclusion is that S must be in position 5, despite the earlier “L(-)” in position 5.  
  That means L is not in position 5, so S can indeed be in position 5.

Current template:
- Position 1: ?
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: ?
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: S

Letters still available (not yet ruled out):
From the alphabet, exclude all ✗ letters and the ones already placed (A, S). Remaining consonants: F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.  
Vowels left: U (since A and I are used).

We also know:
- I must appear exactly once (it hasn’t been marked ✓ yet), and it cannot be in position 4 (DAISY feedback).  
  So I must be in position 1 or 3.

Let’s test the two possibilities:

Case 1: I in position 1  
Template: I A _ _ S  
Remaining middle letters (positions 3 & 4) must be from the available pool.  
A valid English word: I A L _ S → “IALIS” is not a word.  
I A G _ S → “IAGHS” is not a word.  
No common 5-letter word fits.

Case 2: I in position 3  
Template: _ A I _ S  
We need a consonant for position 1 and 4.  
Position 4 must be a consonant (no vowel left except U, and U is available).  
Try common consonants:  
- Position 1: F, G, H, K, P, V  
- Position 4: same pool, but must make a valid word.

A valid word that fits: “VAIUS” – but VAIUS is not standard.  
“PAIUS” – also not a word.  
“GAIS” is too short.  
Wait: “VAIUS” is not valid, but “VAIS” is 4 letters.  
Actually, “VAIUS” is not recognized.

Another approach: look for known 5-letter words ending in AS… but we have A in 2 and S in 5.

Wait, the template is: ? A ? ? S

Let me list possible words fitting _ A _ _ S with remaining letters.

Available letters: F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z and I must appear once.

We have to place I in 1 or 3.

Try I in 3: _ A I _ S  
Need a consonant in 1 and 4.  
A valid word: “VAIUS” – not standard.  
“PAIUS” – no.  
“FAIUS” – no.  
“GAIUS” – this is a proper noun (a name), but not usually accepted in Wordle lists.

Try I in 1: I A _ _ S  
Need consonants in 3 & 4.  
A valid word: “IACIS” – no.  
“IAGIS” – no.  
“IAPIS” – no.  
“IASIS” – this is a valid word (an ancient city).

Let’s check “IASIS”:
- I (position 1) – allowed
- A (position 2) – fixed ✓
- S (position 5) – allowed
- Letters used: I, A, S – all allowed
- Second S is allowed (repetition not forbidden)

This seems to be the only plausible word left.

Therefore, guess: IASIS

Letters NOT in the word (✗):
C, R, N, E, T, O, M, B, D, Y

Letters that ARE in the word (✓):
A, S, I, L

Positional information:
- A is in position 2 (✓).
- I is somewhere in the word but NOT in position 4 (it was marked “-” in DAISY, position 3).
- S is somewhere in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (it was “-” in all those spots across the guesses).  
  Therefore S must be in position 2, but position 2 is already A.  
  This is impossible, so the only logical conclusion is that S must be in position 5, despite the earlier “L(-)” in position 5.  
  That means L is not in position 5, so S can indeed be in position 5.

Current template:
- Position 1: ?
- Position 2: A

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The goal is to maximize information gain by covering frequently used vowels and consonants. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters like A, E, R, S, T, N, etc.

Some excellent starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give us good information about which of these letters are in the secret word and their positions.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|>

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)
- N: not in the word (x)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter A, but not in the 3rd position.
2. The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.
3. We still have 21 other letters (from the alphabet excluding C, R, N, E) that could be in the word.

Since A is confirmed, I should try to place A in a different position and introduce new common consonants and vowels. Good remaining consonants to test include S, T, L, D, M, P, B, etc. Vowels left to test include I, O, U.

A word that uses A in a different position and introduces several new common letters is ""STOMA"":
- S, T, O, M are all new letters not tested before.
- A is moved to the 5th position (was 3rd in CRANE).

This gives us information on 4 new letters and re-tests A in a new spot.

Guess 2: STOMA -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(x) M(x) A(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, T, O, M  
2. The letter A IS in the word, but it is NOT in position 3 or 5 (it was marked “-” in both places).  
3. The letter S is in the word but in the wrong position (position 1 in STOMA).  

Therefore:
- A must be in position 1, 2, or 4.  
- S must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.  
- Remaining unused common letters to test next include D, L, I, U, B, G, H, K, P, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
- Place A in a new position (say position 2).  
- Place S in a new position (say position 4).  
- Introduce several new, high-frequency consonants and vowels.

A word that satisfies these constraints is “SALID”:
- S is in position 1 (but we know S is not in position 1, so this is invalid).  
Oops, that violates the S placement.

Let’s try “BASIL”:
- A is in position 2 (allowed).  
- S is in position 3 (allowed).  
- B, I, L are new letters.

This seems valid.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 3: BASIL -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) S(-) I(✓) L(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, T, O, M, B  
Letters known to be in the word: A, S, I, L  
Positions fixed so far:
- A is in position 2 (✓)
- I is in position 4 (✓)

Remaining positions to fill: 1, 3, 5  
Constraints on remaining letters:
- S must be in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 5 (it was “-” in all those spots across the guesses).  
  Therefore S must be in position 2, but position 2 is already A.  
  This is impossible, so my earlier assumption must be wrong.

Wait: re-examine S placements:
- In STOMA (S at 1) → S(-) → S not in 1
- In BASIL (S at 3) → S(-) → S not in 3
So S cannot be in 1 or 3.  
But positions 2,4,5 are already partially filled:
- 2 = A
- 4 = I
So S has nowhere left to go. This contradiction shows S must be in position 5, but we have L(-) in position 5, meaning L is not in 5. Therefore S cannot be in 5 either. 

This implies S is not in the word, contradicting the earlier “-” (S is in word but wrong position). The only resolution is that S must be in position 5, despite L(-) in position 5. That means L is not in position 5, so S can be in 5.

Thus:
- 1: new letter (not C,R,N,E,T,O,M,B)
- 3: new letter (not C,R,N,E,T,O,M,B,S,A,I,L)
- 5: S

Common remaining consonants: D, F, G, H, K, P, U, V, W, Y  
Vowels left: U, Y (since A and I are used)

Let’s pick a word that fits:
- Pos 2 = A
- Pos 4 = I
- Pos 5 = S
- Pos 1 and 3 from remaining letters.

A good candidate is “FAIRY”:
- F (new), A (fixed), I (fixed), R (but R is excluded), Y (new) – R is excluded, so invalid.

Next try “GAISK” – but K is okay, but S must be in 5, so:
- 1: G
- 2: A
- 3: I (but I is fixed at 4) – invalid.

Correct structure:
- 1: ?
- 2: A
- 3: ?
- 4: I
- 5: S

A valid word: “GAIS” is 4 letters. Need 5 letters.

Try “GAISS” – not a word.

Try “PAIUS” – not a word.

Try “VAIUS” – not a word.

Try “DAISY”:
- D (new), A (2), I (4), S (5), Y (new) – fits all constraints.

Check letters: D, A, I, S, Y – none are excluded. This works.

Let’s summarize everything we now know after five guesses.

Letters NOT in the word (✗):
C, R, N, E, T, O, M, B, D, Y

Letters that ARE in the word (✓):
A, S, I, L

Positional information:
- A is in position 2 (✓).
- I appears at least once, but:
  – I was marked “-” in IASIS at positions 1 and 4, so I cannot be in 1 or 4.
  – I was marked “✓” in IASIS at position 3, so I MUST be in position 3.
- S appears at least once, but:
  – S was marked “-” in IASIS at positions 1, 3, 4, so S cannot be in 1, 3, 4.
  – S was marked “✓” in IASIS at position 5, so S MUST be in position 5.
- L was marked “-” in BASIL at position 5, so L cannot be in 5. But we have no other constraints on L yet.

Therefore the word has the fixed form:
- Position 1: ?
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: S

Letters still available (not yet ruled out and not yet placed):
From the alphabet, exclude all ✗ letters and the ones already placed (A, I, S). Remaining consonants: F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.  
Vowels left: U (since A and I are used).

We need to fill positions 1 and 4 with these remaining letters, and the word must be a valid 5-letter English word.

Let’s list possible combinations:

Position 1: any of F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z  
Position 4: any of F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need to find a word of the form ? A I ? S.

A quick scan of common English words gives:

- FAIRY – but Y is ✗.
- PAIUS – not a standard word.
- VAIS – too short.
- HAIRS – H is allowed, R is ✗.
- GAINS – N is ✗.
- JAINS – N is ✗.
- KAIUS – not standard.
- PAIUS – not standard.
- VAIS – too short.
- WAIST – T is ✗.
- XAIS – not a word.
- ZAIDS – D is ✗.

Wait, let me think of others:

- HAIS – too short.
- LAIS – L is allowed, but only 4 letters.
- VAIS – too short.

Actually, the only valid English word of the form ? A I ? S using allowed letters seems to be:

- VAIS – but this is 4 letters.
- HAIS – 4 letters.

Wait, let me reconsider the allowed letters for position 4. We have U as the only remaining vowel, and consonants F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Let me try:

- F A I R S – but R is ✗.
- F A I T S – T is ✗.
- F A I L S – L is allowed, and F, A, I, L, S are all allowed. This is a valid word: FAILS.

Check FAILS against all constraints:
- Letters: F, A, I, L, S – none are ✗.
- Positions:
  – 1: F – allowed
  – 2: A – fixed ✓
  – 3: I – fixed ✓
  – 4: L – allowed (L was only excluded from 5, not from 4)
  – 5: S – fixed ✓
- All previous feedback are satisfied.

Therefore, the correct word must be FAILS.
