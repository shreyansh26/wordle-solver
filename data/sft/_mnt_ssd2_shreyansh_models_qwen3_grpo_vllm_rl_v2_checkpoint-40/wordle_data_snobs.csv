### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent in English 5-letter words

This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word and potentially their positions.

From the new feedback on SOUND:

- S(✓) → S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- O(-) → O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (contradicts earlier feedback that O was in position 3).  
  Wait – this is impossible. The first guess AROSE gave O(✓), meaning O was definitely in position 3.  
  The second guess SOUND shows O(-), meaning O is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
  This contradiction means one of the following must be true:
  1. The feedback was mis-recorded.
  2. The secret word has two O’s, one in position 3 and one elsewhere (but that’s unusual).
  3. The feedback for SOUND’s O is simply saying it’s in the word but not in position 3, which would override the earlier ✓.

Assuming the feedback is correct, the only consistent interpretation is that the secret word has an O in position 3 (from AROSE) and another O somewhere else (from SOUND’s O(-)). This would make the word have two O’s, which is rare but possible.

So we now know:
- Position 1: S
- Position 3: O
- O also appears somewhere else (positions 2, 4, or 5)
- Letters to exclude: A, R, E, U, D
- N(-) from SOUND means N is in the word but not in position 4.

Next guess should:
1. Keep S in position 1.
2. Keep O in position 3.
3. Place N somewhere else (positions 2, 5).
4. Introduce new common letters (I, L, T, etc.).

Candidate: SINOS (but repeats S).  
Better: SPOIL (but P not yet tested).  
Best: SINUS (but repeats S and U).  
Another candidate: SLOIN (but uncommon).  
A good common word: SPOIL – uses P, I, L (all untested), keeps S and O in correct spots, and N could go in position 5.

Wait – let’s try SINUS: S I N O S.  
- S in position 1 ✓  
- I new  
- N in position 3 – but O must be in position 3. So invalid.

Try SPOIL: S P O I L  
- S in position 1 ✓  
- P new  
- O in position 3 ✓  
- I new

Also checks: N must be in the word (from SOUND’s N(-)), so N must go somewhere. Let’s force N into position 5: S P O I N – “SPOIN” is not a valid word.

Next valid word: S L O I N – “SLoin” invalid.  
“SOLIN” – valid? Yes, a name but not common.  
“SONIC” – C new, N in position 4 (but N(-) says N not in 4).

“SNOBI” – invalid.  
“STONY” – T new, N in 4 – invalid.  
“SPOON” – P, O, O, N – but O already in 3, second O would be new position, N in 4 – invalid.

“SLOTH” – L, T, H new, O in 3, S in 1, but H not common.

“SPOIL” is the best valid word that fits all constraints so far:  
S P O I L – uses P, I, L (all new), keeps S and O in correct positions, and N must be in word but not in 4 – so N must be in 2, but P is in 2. Thus N must go elsewhere.

Actually, let’s list what we know:
- S _ O _ _ (position 1 and 3 fixed)
- N must appear somewhere (not in 4)
- Possible positions for N: 2 or 5
- Letters used so far: S, O, N must be present; excluded: A, R, E, U, D

Possible words:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent in English 5-letter words

This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word and potentially their positions.

Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(-) U(x) N(-) D(x)
<|im_end|>

From the new feedback on SOUND:

- S(✓) → S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- O(-) → O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (contradicts earlier feedback that O was in position 3).  
  Wait – this is impossible. The first guess AROSE gave O(✓), meaning O was definitely in position 3.  
  The second guess SOUND shows O(-), meaning O is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
  This contradiction means one of the following must be true:
  1. The feedback was mis-recorded.
  2. The secret word has two O’s, one in position 3 and one elsewhere (but that’s unusual).
  3. The feedback for SOUND’s O is simply saying it’s in the word but not in position 3, which would override the earlier ✓.

Assuming the feedback is correct, the only consistent interpretation is that the secret word has an O in position 3 (from AROSE) and another O somewhere else (from SOUND’s O(-)). This would make the word have two O’s, which is rare but possible.

So we now know:
- Position 1: S
- Position 3: O
- O also appears somewhere else (positions 2, 4, or 5)
- Letters to exclude: A, R, E, U, D
- N(-) from SOUND means N is in the word but not in position 4.

Next guess should:
1. Keep S in position 1.
2. Keep O in position 3.
3. Place N somewhere else (positions 2, 5).
4. Introduce new common letters (I, L, T, etc.).

Candidate: SINOS (but repeats S).  
Better: SPOIL (but P not yet tested).  
Best: SINUS (but repeats S and U).  
Another candidate: SLOIN (but uncommon).  
A good common word: SPOIL – uses P, I, L (all untested), keeps S and O in correct spots, and N could go in position 5.

Wait – let’s try SINUS: S I N O S.  
- S in position 1 ✓  
- I new  
- N in position 3 – but O must be in position 3. So invalid.

Try SPOIL: S P O I L  
- S in position 1 ✓  
- P new  
- O in position 3 ✓  
- I new  
- L new  
Also checks: N must be in the word (from SOUND’s N(-)), so N must go somewhere. Let’s force N into position 5: S P O I N – “SPOIN” is not a valid word.

Next valid word: S L O I N – “SLoin” invalid.  
“SOLIN” – valid? Yes, a name but not common.  
“SONIC” – C new, N in position 4 (but N(-) says N not in 4).  
“SONIC” has N in 4 – invalid.

“SNOBI” – invalid.  
“STONY” – T new, N in 4 – invalid.  
“SPOON” – P, O, O, N – but O already in 3, second O would be new position, N in 4 – invalid.

“SLOTH” – L, T, H new, O in 3, S in 1, but H not common.

“SPOIL” is the best valid word that fits all constraints so far:  
S P O I L – uses P, I, L (all new), keeps S and O in correct positions, and N must be in word but not in 4 – so N must be in 2, but P is in 2. Thus N must go elsewhere.

Actually, let’s list what we know:
- S _ O _ _ (position 1 and 3 fixed)
- N must appear somewhere (not in 4)
- Possible positions for N: 2 or 5
- Letters used so far: S, O, N must be present; excluded: A, R, E, U, D

Possible words:
- S N O _ _ : SNOWY – W new, Y new.  
- S _ O _ N : S P O I N – invalid.  
“SNOWY” is valid and fits all constraints.

Therefore, next guess: SNOWY.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent in English 5-letter words

This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word and potentially their positions.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in the word and is in the 3rd position (index 2).
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters to exclude: A, R, E.
- O must be in position 3.
- S must appear somewhere else (positions 1, 2, or 5).

A good next guess should:
1. Keep O in position 3.
2. Include S in a different position.
3. Introduce new common letters not yet tested.

Possible candidates: 
- ""SOLID"" (S, O, L, I, D) – but L and I are not top 10, and D is moderate.
- ""SOUND"" (S, O, U, N, D) – U and N are top 10, D is moderate.
- ""SPOON"" (S, P, O, O, N) – P and N are top 10, but double O is unlikely.

“SPOIL” is the best valid word that fits all constraints so far:  
S P O I L – uses P, I, L (all new), keeps S and O in correct positions, and N must be in word but not in 4 – so N must be in 2, but P is in 2. Thus N must go elsewhere.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent in English 5-letter words

This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word and potentially their positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in the word and is in the 3rd position (index 2).
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters to exclude: A, R, E.
- O must be in position 3.
- S must appear somewhere else (positions 1, 2, or 5).

A good next guess should:
1. Keep O in position 3.
2. Include S in a different position.
3. Introduce new common letters not yet tested.

Possible candidates: 
- ""SOLID"" (S, O, L, I, D) – but L and I are not top 10, and D is moderate.
- ""SOUND"" (S, O, U, N, D) – U and N are top 10, D is moderate.
- ""SPOON"" (S, P, O, O, N) – P and N are top 10, but double O is unlikely.

""SOUND"" seems best: it places O in position 3, moves S to position 1, and introduces U, N, D (all common and untested).

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(-) U(x) N(-) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on SOUND:

- S(✓) → S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- O(-) → O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (contradicts earlier feedback that O was in position 3).  
  Wait – this is impossible. The first guess AROSE gave O(✓), meaning O was definitely in position 3.  
  The second guess SOUND shows O(-), meaning O is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
  This contradiction means one of the following must be true:
  1. The feedback was mis-recorded.
  2. The secret word has two O’s, one in position 3 and one elsewhere (but that’s unusual).
  3. The feedback for SOUND’s O is simply saying it’s in the word but not in position 3, which would override the earlier ✓.

Assuming the feedback is correct, the only consistent interpretation is that the secret word has an O in position 3 (from AROSE) and another O somewhere else (from SOUND’s O(-)). This would make the word have two O’s, which is rare but possible.

So we now know:
- Position 1: S
- Position 3: O
- O also appears somewhere else (positions 2, 4, or 5)
- Letters to exclude: A, R, E, U, D
- N(-) from SOUND means N is in the word but not in position 4.

Next guess should:
1. Keep S in position 1.
2. Keep O in position 3.
3. Place N somewhere else (positions 2, 5).
4. Introduce new common letters (I, L, T, etc.).

Candidate: SINOS (but repeats S).  
Better: SPOIL (but P not yet tested).  
Best: SINUS (but repeats S and U).  
Another candidate: SLOIN (but uncommon).  
A good common word: SPOIL – uses P, I, L (all untested), keeps S and O in correct spots, and N could go in position 5.

Wait – let’s try SINUS: S I N O S.  
- S in position 1 ✓  
- I new  
- N in position 3 – but O must be in position 3. So invalid.

Try SPOIL: S P O I L  
- S in position 1 ✓  
- P new  
- O in position 3 ✓  
- I new  
- L new  
Also checks: N must be in the word (from SOUND’s N(-)), so N must go somewhere. Let’s force N into position 5: S P O I N – “SPOIN” is not a valid word.

Next valid word: S L O I N – “SLoin” invalid.  
“SOLIN” – valid? Yes, a name but not common.  
“SONIC” – C new, N in position 4 (but N(-) says N not in 4).  
“SONIC” has N in 4 – invalid.

“SNOBI” – invalid.  
“STONY” – T new, N in 4 – invalid.  
“SPOON” – P, O, O, N – but O already in 3, second O would be new position, N in 4 – invalid.

“SLOTH” – L, T, H new, O in 3, S in 1, but H not common.

“SPOIL” is the best valid word that fits all constraints so far:  
S P O I L – uses P, I, L (all new), keeps S and O in correct positions, and N must be in word but not in 4 – so N must be in 2, but P is in 2. Thus N must go elsewhere.

Actually, let’s list what we know:
- S _ O _ _ (position 1 and 3 fixed)
- N must appear somewhere (not in 4)
- Possible positions for N: 2 or 5
- Letters used so far: S, O, N must be present; excluded: A, R, E, U, D

Possible words:
- S N O _ _ : SNOWY – W new, Y new.  
- S _ O _ N : S P O I N – invalid.  
“SNOWY” is valid and fits all constraints.

Therefore, next guess: SNOWY.

From the latest feedback:

- S N O _ _ are confirmed correct for positions 1-3.
- R and T are NOT in the word (they were marked “x”).

Letters already used / fixed: S, N, O  
Letters already ruled out: A, R, E, T, U, W, Y

So the pattern is S N O _ _, and the fourth letter must be one of the remaining common consonants or vowels that haven’t been excluded.  
Available letters (roughly descending frequency): L, I, K, P, C, M, F, G, B, etc.

Common 5-letter words that start with “SNO” and avoid all excluded letters:
- SNOW?  – W is excluded.  
- SNOS? – second S is allowed but no such word.  
- SNOL? – not a word.  
- SNOK? – valid (a regional word for “snook” or a slang term).  
- SNOM? – not a word.  
- SNOC? – not a word.  
- SNOP? – already tried (and rejected).  
- SNOW? – already rejected.  
- SNOWS? – invalid length and S already used.  

The only remaining common English word that fits is “SNOK” (Scrabble dictionary) or “SNOW” (invalid). However, “SNOW” is invalid because W is excluded. 

Looking again, there’s also “SNIBS” (invalid length and B/S), “SNIB” (invalid), “SNIBS” (invalid). 

Another candidate: “SNICK” – but C is available and K is available. Wait, the pattern is S N O _ _, so “SNICK” would be S N I C K, which doesn’t fit the fixed S N O.

Realizing my mistake: the pattern is S N O _ _, so the fourth letter must be after O. Valid words:
- SNOW? – W excluded.  
- SNOS? – invalid.  
- SNOK? – valid (S N O K).  
- SNOL? – invalid.  
- SNOM? – invalid.  

The only valid word left is “SNOK” (a valid Scrabble word meaning a small fish or a slang term). Since the game accepts any valid 5-letter word, and “SNOK” fits all constraints, this must be the answer.
