### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. ""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and consonants effectively. This should give us good coverage to narrow down the secret word.

From the feedback on “arose”:

- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
1. The word contains S, but not in position 4.
2. The word does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses S somewhere other than the 4th position.
- Avoids A, R, O, E entirely.
- Uses other common letters not yet tested (e.g., T, N, I, L, C, U, D, M, P, Y).

A good second guess that satisfies these constraints is “STUMP”:
- S is in position 1 (not 4), satisfying the feedback.
- T, U, M, P are all new letters that haven’t been tested yet.
- The word avoids all the eliminated letters (A, R, O, E).

Letters we know are in the word: S (position 5), I.

Remaining possible positions for I: 1, 2, or 4 (since it can’t be 3).

Allowed letters left (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus I and S).

We need a 5-letter word ending in S, containing I, and using only allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
- _ I _ _ S
- I _ _ _ S
- _ _ I _ S

Let’s pick a word that fits _ I _ _ S and uses common remaining letters. Good candidates are consonants like C, D, L, G, B, K.

“CIGAR” is invalid (A, R ruled out).
“WISPS” – W, I, S, P, S. P is ruled out.
“DILDS” – D, I, L, D, S. All letters allowed.

But let’s try a more common word: “WISPS” fails on P.
“FISTS” – F, I, S, T, S. T is ruled out.
“LISPS” – L, I, S, P, S. P ruled out.
“DISKS” – D, I, S, K, S. All letters allowed and common.

So “DISKS” fits:
- Ends with S (position 5 ✓).
- Contains I in position 2 (allowed).
- Uses D, I, S, K, S. All letters not ruled out.

This will confirm positions of D, K, and where I belongs.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. ""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and consonants effectively. This should give us good coverage to narrow down the secret word.

From the feedback on “arose”:

- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
1. The word contains S, but not in position 4.
2. The word does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses S somewhere other than the 4th position.
- Avoids A, R, O, E entirely.
- Uses other common letters not yet tested (e.g., T, N, I, L, C, U, D, M, P, Y).

A good second guess that satisfies these constraints is “STUMP”:
- S is in position 1 (not 4), satisfying the feedback.
- T, U, M, P are all new letters that haven’t been tested yet.
- The word avoids all the eliminated letters (A, R, O, E).

This should give us more information about the remaining letters and the correct placement of S.

Therefore S must be in position 2, 3, or 5.

We also know the word has no vowels A, O, E, U, so the remaining vowels are I and Y (if Y counts as a vowel). We still haven’t tested I or Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:

- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (so no A, R, O, E, T, U, M, P).

- S in position 5 (allowed).
- H, I, N, S are all still possible letters.
- It has two S’s, which is allowed.

From the new feedback on “shins”:

- S(✓) in position 5 → the word ends in S.
- S(-) in position 1 → S is not in position 1 (already knew it wasn’t 4 or 1, now confirmed).
- H(x) → H is not in the word.
- I(-) → I is in the word but not in position 3.
- N(x) → N is not in the word.

Letters still ruled out: A, R, O, E, T, U, M, P, H, N.

Letters we know are in the word: S (position 5), I.

Remaining possible positions for I: 1, 2, or 4 (since it can’t be 3).

Allowed letters left (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus I and S).

We need a 5-letter word ending in S, containing I, and using only allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
- _ I _ _ S
- I _ _ _ S
- _ _ I _ S

Let’s pick a word that fits _ I _ _ S and uses common remaining letters. Good candidates are consonants like C, D, L, G, B, K.

“CIGAR” is invalid (A, R ruled out).
“WISPS” – W, I, S, P, S. P is ruled out.
“DILDS” – D, I, L, D, S. All letters allowed.

But let’s try a more common word: “WISPS” fails on P.
“FISTS” – F, I, S, T, S. T is ruled out.
“LISPS” – L, I, S, P, S. P ruled out.
“DISKS” – D, I, S, K, S. All letters allowed and common.

So “DISKS” fits:
- Ends with S (position 5 ✓).
- Contains I in position 2 (allowed).
- Uses D, I, S, K, S. All letters not ruled out.

This will confirm positions of D, K, and where I belongs.

From the latest feedback on “disks”:

- I(✓) in position 2 → the word has I in position 2.
- S(-) in position 3 → S is not in position 3.
- S(✓) in position 5 → the word ends with S.
- D(x) and K(x) → D and K are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ I _ _ S
- Letters definitely in: I (position 2), S (positions 5 and must appear elsewhere).
- Letters ruled out: A, R, O, E, T, U, M, P, H, N, D, K.
- S cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (wait, no: S is in 5 and not in 1 or 3 from previous feedback). Actually, from arose S was in 4 (-), stump S in 1 (-), shins S in 1 (-), disks S in 3 (-). So S is in 5 and not in 1,3,4. Therefore S must be in 5 only.
- So the word has I in 2 and S in 5, and must have another S? No, letters can repeat but we don't know yet. Actually, the feedback shows S is in 5 and not in 1,3,4. So S is only in 5. But the word has 5 letters, so positions 1,3,4 must be filled with allowed letters.

Wait, let's re-express:

From all feedback:
- S is in the word and is in position 5 (✓).
- S is NOT in positions 1, 3, 4.
- I is in the word and is in position 2 (✓).
- I is NOT in position 3 (from shins feedback).
- Ruled out letters: A, R, O, E, T, U, M, P, H, N, D, K.

So the pattern is: _ I _ _ S
And we need to fill positions 1, 3, 4 with letters not in the ruled out list.

Available letters (not ruled out): B, C, F, G, J, L, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus I and S (but I is in 2, S in 5).

We need common English words fitting _ I _ _ S with these letters.

Possible candidates:
- B I L L S → ""bills"" – uses B, I, L, L, S. All letters allowed.
- C I V I L S – too long.
- F I L M S – M ruled out.
- G I L D S – D ruled out.
- W I L D S – D ruled out.
- L I V E S – E ruled out.
- C I G A R S – too long and A,R ruled out.
- B I G S – too short.
- V I L L S – ""vills"" is a valid word (plural of villa), uses V, I, L, L, S. All letters allowed.

Between ""bills"" and ""vills"", ""bills"" is more common.

Let's choose ""bills"".
