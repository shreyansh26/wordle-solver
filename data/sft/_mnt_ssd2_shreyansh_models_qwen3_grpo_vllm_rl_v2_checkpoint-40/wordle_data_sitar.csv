### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these common letters, especially vowels and common consonants.

One of the best starting words in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English

This gives us good coverage to quickly identify which vowels and consonants are in the word and their possible positions.

- S T A R _ → but A is 4th, so S T A R ? (no)

From the two pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   - A, R, S are all in the word but not in their original positions (1, 2, 4 respectively).  
   - O and E are not in the word.

2. STRAY → S(✓) T(-) R(-) A(✓) Y(x)  
   - S is now in the correct position (1st).  
   - A is now in the correct position (4th).  
   - T and R are in the word but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.  
   - Y is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: S _ _ A _  
- Letters in the word: S, T, R, A  
- Letters not in the word: O, E, Y  
- R cannot be in position 3.  
- T cannot be in position 2.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S and has A in the 4th position.  
- Contains T and R somewhere in the remaining slots (positions 2, 3, 5).  
- Does not contain O, E, Y.  
- Uses only valid letters.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (but we already know T and R are present).

Let’s list possible words fitting S _ _ A _ with T and R:
- S T R A _ → STRAB (not a word)  
- S T _ A R → ST _ AR → ST CAR? (no)  
- S _ T A R → S T A R _ → S T A R ? (but A is already 4th)  
- S R T A _ → (no common word)  
- S _ R A T → S B R A T (no)  
- S T A R _ → but A is 4th, so S T A R ? (no)  
- S C R A T → SCRAT (no)  
- S P R A T → SPRAT (valid word meaning a small fish)

Let’s check SPRAT:
- S (✓) P R A T  
- Positions: S(1), P(2), R(3), A(4), T(5)  
- Contains S, P, R, A, T.  
- No O, E, Y.  
- R is in position 3 (originally feedback said R is in word but not position 3, so this is allowed).  
- T is in position 5 (originally feedback said T is in word but not position 2, so this is allowed).

This seems valid.

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   A, R, S are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 4 respectively.  
   O, E are out.

2. STRAY → S(✓) T(-) R(-) A(✓) Y(x)  
   S is fixed at position 1, A is fixed at position 4.  
   T and R are in the word but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.  
   Y is out.

3. SPRAT → S(✓) P(x) R(-) A(✓) T(-)  
   P is not in the word.  
   R is still in the word but not in position 3.  
   T is still in the word but not in position 5.

Current constraints:
- Pattern: S _ _ A _  
- Must contain T and R somewhere in positions 2, 3, 5.  
- R cannot be in position 3.  
- T cannot be in positions 2 or 5.  
- Letters out: O, E, Y, P.

Possible positions for T and R:
- T can only be in position 3 (since 2 and 5 are excluded).  
- R must then be in position 2 or 5. But position 5 is open, and position 2 is open (but R was excluded from position 2 in STRAY feedback? Wait, no: in STRAY, R was in position 3 and got (-), meaning R is not in position 3, but could be in 2 or 5. In SPRAT, R is in position 3 again and still gets (-), confirming R is not in position 3. So R can be in 2 or 5.

But T must be in position 3 (only remaining spot it can fit). So:
- Position 3 = T  
- Then R must be in position 2 or 5.  
- Position 5 is open, position 2 is open.

So possible patterns:
- S R T A _ (but then we need a 5th letter, and R is already used)
- S _ T A R (R in position 5)

But we already have S _ _ A _ and T must be in position 3 (only place it can be), so:
S _ T A _ (but then R must be in position 2 or 5. Position 5 is open, position 2 is open.)

So possible words:
- S C T A R (no)  
- S L T A R (no)  
- S N T A R (no)  
- S B T A R (no)  
- S D T A R (no)  
- S M T A R (no)  
- S G T A R (no)  
- S H T A R (no)  
- S F T A R (no)  
- S K T A R (no)  
- S V T A R (no)  
- S W T A R (no)  
- S X T A R (no)  
- S Z T A R (no)  

Wait, none of these seem valid. Maybe I missed something.

Alternative: Maybe T is in position 2? But in STRAY, T was in position 2 and got (-), meaning T is not in position 2. So T cannot be in position 2. Similarly, in SPRAT, T is in position 5 and got (-), so T is not in position 5. Therefore T must be in position 3, which is the only remaining spot.

So the word must be S _ T A _ with R being in position 2 or 5. But position 5 is open, and position 2 is open. So possible:
- S R T A _ (but then we need a 5th letter, and R is already used)
- S _ T A R (R in position 5)

So the word must be S _ T A R. The blank in position 2 must be a letter that hasn't been excluded. Letters excluded so far: O, E, Y, P. Also, from previous feedback, we have no info on B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Looking for common letters, likely C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N.

Possible valid words:
- S C T A R (no)  
- S D T A R (no)  
- S F T A R (no)  
- S G T A R (no)  
- S H T A R (no)  
- S I T A R (yes! ""SITAR"" - a musical instrument)

SITAR:
- S(1) I(2) T(3) A(4) R(5)  
- Contains S, I, T, A, R.  
- No O, E, Y, P.  
- T is in position 3 (allowed).  
- R is in position 5 (allowed).  
- I is a new letter to test.

This seems valid.
