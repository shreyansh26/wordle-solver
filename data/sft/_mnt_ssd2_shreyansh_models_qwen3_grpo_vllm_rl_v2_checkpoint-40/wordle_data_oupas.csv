For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll choose a word that uses several of these letters. A good strategy is to use a word with no repeated letters to maximize information gain. 

Looking at these common letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains A, R, O, S, E - five of the most common English letters, all in different positions. This will give me information about the presence and position of these very common letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 4.

Next guess should:
1. Keep A, O, S in new positions
2. Introduce new common letters (avoid R, E)
3. Use a word structure that tests new positions for A, O, S

Good candidates: 
- SAINT (has S, A, O in new positions, but O isn't present)

This will give me information about the presence and position of these very common letters in the secret word.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.\n- R(x): R is not in the word at all.\n- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3.\n- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 4.\n- E(x): E is not in the word at all.\n\nSo we know:\n- Letters NOT in the word: R, E\n- Letters that ARE in the word: A, O, S\n- A is somewhere in positions 2-5\n- O is somewhere in positions 1, 2, 4, 5\n- S is somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, 5\n\nWe also know positions 1, 3, 4, 5 have no R or E, and positions 1, 3, 4 have no O in their original spots.\n\nNext guess should:\n1.

From the three guesses we now have:

Letters NOT in the word: R, E, L, N, C, T  
Letters that ARE in the word: A, O, S  

Positions ruled out so far:

A: not in 1 (AROSE), not in 2 (SALON), not in 3 (COAST)  
O: not in 3 (AROSE), not in 4 (SALON), not in 2 (COAST)  
S: not in 4 (AROSE), not in 1 (SALON), not in 5 (COAST)  

Therefore:

A can only be in position 4 or 5  
O can only be in position 1 or 5  
S can only be in position 2 or 3  

We need a 5-letter word that uses A, O, S exactly once each, in one of these remaining positions, plus two new letters (from the remaining alphabet, excluding R, E, L, N, C, T).

Let’s list the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want a word that satisfies:

- A in 4 or 5  
- O in 1 or 5  
- S in 2 or 3  

One straightforward combination is:

O _ S _ A   (O in 1, S in 3, A in 5)  
We need two new letters for positions 2 and 4.

Choosing common remaining letters: B and D gives OBSDA, but that’s not a valid word.  
Choosing B and M gives OBSMA – invalid.  
Choosing D and M gives ODSMA – invalid.  
Choosing B and I gives OBSIA – invalid.  

Another pattern: _ O _ A S  
But then O is in 2, which is disallowed.

Another pattern: _ S _ A O  
Then S is in 2, A in 4, O in 5.  
We need letters for positions 1 and 3.

Using B and D: BSDAO – invalid.  
Using B and I: BSI AO – invalid.  
Using D and I: DSIAO – invalid.  

Another pattern: A _ S _ _  
But A can’t be in 3, and we need A in 4 or 5.  

Let’s try A in 4, O in 1, S in 3:  
O _ S A _  
We need letters for 2 and 5.  
Using B and D: OBSDA – invalid.  
Using B and I: OBSDI – invalid.  
Using B and M: OBSMA – invalid.  

Let’s try A in 5, O in 1, S in 2 or 3.

O S _ _ A  
Need letters for 3 and 4.  
Using B and D: OSBDA – invalid.  
Using B and I: OSBIA – invalid.  

Another pattern: _ A S _ _  
But A can’t be in 3.  

Let’s try A in 5, S in 2, O in 1:  
O S _ _ A  
Need valid 5-letter words fitting this.  
Possible word: OSMIA – but that’s not valid.  
OSCAR – but C is out.  
OSKAR – but K is allowed.  
OSKAR – valid? Yes, “OSKAR” is a proper noun but not allowed in Wordle.  

Another approach: look for known words with A, O, S in remaining positions.

Consider “SOAPY” – but Y is allowed.  
Check positions: S in 1 (disallowed), so no.  

Consider “SPOON” – but N is out.  

Consider “SOAPY” again – S in 1 (disallowed).  

Consider “SWORD” – but D is allowed.  
Check positions: S in 1 (disallowed).  

Consider “SWAMP” – but P is allowed, but word is 6 letters.  

Consider “SWASH” – but repeats S.  

Consider “SABOT” – but T is out.  

Consider “SALAD” – but L is out.  

Consider “SAMBA” – but B is allowed, M is allowed.  
Check positions: S in 1 (disallowed).  

Consider “SANDY” – N is out.  

Consider “SAPID” – but I and D are allowed.  
S in 1 (disallowed).  

Consider “SAVIO” – but V and I are allowed, but word is 5 letters.  
SAVIO – not a valid word.  

Consider “SABOT” – T is out.  

Let me systematically list possible positions:

We have:

A must be 4 or 5  
O must be 1 or 5  
S must be 2 or 3  

Case 1: O in 1, A in 4, S in 2 or 3  
Pattern: O S _ A _ or O _ S A _

For O S _ A _:  
Need letters 3 and 5.  
Valid word: O S B A D – not valid.  
O S M A D – not valid.  
O S P A D – not valid.  

For O _ S A _:  
Need letters 2 and 5.  
O B S A D – not valid.  
O M S A D – not valid.  

Case 2: O in 1, A in 5, S in 2 or 3  
Pattern: O S _ _ A or O _ S _ A  

O S _ _ A:  
Need letters 3 and 4.  
O S B B A – not valid.  
O S B M A – not valid.  

O _ S _ A:  
Need letters 2 and 4.  
O B S M A – not valid.  

Case 3: A in 4, O in 5, S in 2 or 3  
Pattern: _ S _ A O or _ _ S A O  

_ S _ A O:  
Need letters 1 and 3.  
B S M A O – not valid.  

_ _ S A O:  
Need letters 1 and 2.  
B M S A O – not valid.  

Case 4: A in 5, O in 1, S in 2 or 3  
Same as Case 1.  

Wait, let me think differently: use a systematic word list.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll choose a word that uses several of these letters. A good strategy is to use a word with no repeated letters to maximize information gain. 

Looking at these common letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains A, R, O, S, E - five of the most common English letters, all in different positions. This will give me information about the presence and position of these very common letters in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, E
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, O, S
- A is somewhere in positions 2-5
- O is somewhere in positions 1, 2, 4, 5
- S is somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, 5

We also know positions 1, 3, 4, 5 have no R or E, and positions 1, 3, 4 have no O in their original spots.

Next guess should:
1. Keep A, O, S in new positions
2. Introduce new common letters (avoid R, E)
3. Use a word structure that tests new positions for A, O, S

Good candidates: 
- SAINT (has S, A, O in new positions, but O isn't present)
- STOAS (has S, O, A but repeats S)
- SALON (has A, S, O in new positions and introduces L, N)

SALON looks good: S (position 1), A (position 2), L (new), O (position 4), N (new). This tests:
- S in position 1
- A in position 2
- O in position 4
- Introduces L and N

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two previous guesses we know:

Letters NOT in the word: R, E, L, N  
Letters that ARE in the word: A, O, S  

Positions ruled out so far:

A: not in 1 (AROSE), not in 2 (SALON)  
O: not in 3 (AROSE), not in 4 (SALON)  
S: not in 4 (AROSE), not in 1 (SALON)  

So the remaining possible positions are:

A: 3, 4, 5  
O: 1, 2, 5  
S: 2, 3, 5  

We need a 5-letter word that uses A, O, S exactly once each and only in the still-allowed positions, plus two new letters (avoiding R, E, L, N).  
A good candidate is “COAST”:

C (new), O (allowed in 2), A (allowed in 3), S (allowed in 4), T (new).  
Checks:  
- Contains A, O, S in still-allowed spots.  
- Adds two new letters (C, T) that haven’t been tested yet.  
- No disallowed letters.  

Hence COAST is a strong next guess.

From the three guesses we have:

Letters known to be in the word: A, O, S  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, E, L, N, C, T  

Positions ruled out so far:
- A: not in 1 (AROSE), not in 2 (SALON), not in 3 (COAST) → must be in 4 or 5
- O: not in 3 (AROSE), not in 4 (SALON), not in 2 (COAST) → must be in 1 or 5
- S: not in 4 (AROSE), not in 1 (SALON), not in 5 (COAST) → must be in 2 or 3

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, O, S exactly once each.
2. Places A in position 4 or 5.
3. Places O in position 1 or 5.
4. Places S in position 2 or 3.
5. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no R, E, L, N, C, T).

Let's consider possible placements:

Case 1: O in 1, A in 4, S in 2 or 3
- O _ S _ A → needs two more letters (not ruled out)
- Possible: O S _ _ A → but S would be in 2, need 3rd and 4th letters
  - O S _ _ A: need two new letters, e.g., O S P I A (but ""OSPIA"" isn't a word)
  - O S _ _ A: ""O S A _ _"" doesn't fit A in 4
Actually, O _ _ A _ with S in 2 or 3:
- O S _ A _ → need 3rd and 5th letters, e.g., O S I A D (not a word)
- O _ S A _ → need 2nd and 5th letters, e.g., O M S A D (not a word)

Case 2: O in 1, A in 5, S in 2 or 3
- O _ S _ A or O _ _ S A
- O S _ _ A: need 3rd and 4th, e.g., O S I D A (not a word)
- O _ S _ A: need 2nd and 4th, e.g., O M S I A (not a word)

Case 3: O in 5, A in 4, S in 2 or 3
- _ _ A S O or _ _ S A O
- _ S A S O: repeats S
- _ _ A S O: need 1st and 2nd letters, e.g., D I A S O (not a word)
- _ S _ A O: need 2nd and 4th, e.g., P S I A O (not a word)

Case 4: O in 5, A in 5 (impossible) - skip

Wait, let's try concrete words:
We need A in 4 or 5, O in 1 or 5, S in 2 or 3, and two new letters from remaining (allowed letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Looking for words:
- O S _ A _ : ""OSA**"" - no common word
- _ O S _ A : ""O S A**"" - no
- _ S O A _ : ""S O A**"" - no
- S O _ A _ : ""S O A**"" - no

Alternative: ""ADIOS"" - but A is 1st (ruled out), D and I are new
""ASIDE"" - has E (ruled out)
""ASHOR"" - has R (ruled out)
""SOAKY"" - has K and Y, but A is 3rd (allowed), O is 2nd (allowed), S is 1st (ruled out)
""SOAPY"" - O is 2nd (allowed), S is 1st (ruled out)
""SWASH"" - repeats S
""SWAYS"" - repeats S

Wait, let's think differently - maybe A is 5th, O is 1st, S is 2nd or 3rd:
- O _ S _ A: ""O S _ _ A"" - need 3rd and 4th letters, e.g., O S I D A (not a word)
- O _ _ S A: ""O _ _ S A"" - need 2nd and 3rd, e.g., O M I S A (not a word)

Hmm, let's try ""SOUND"" - but U and N, N is ruled out
""STONY"" - T and N are ruled out
""SHOWN"" - H, W, N - N ruled out
""SHOUT"" - T ruled out
""SWISH"" - repeats S
""SWISH"" - no

Wait, let's try ""SPOOF"" - but P, F are new, but A and O not present
Need to include A, O, S.

Let's try ""FOAMY"" - but M, Y new, but A is 3rd (allowed), O is 2nd (allowed), S missing
""FOSSA"" - has S, A, but O is 2nd (allowed), A is 5th (allowed), S is 3rd (allowed), F and O are new
But ""FOSSA"" is a word (a type of mollusk)

Check positions:
F (new), O (2nd), S (3rd), S (repeats), A (5th) - but S repeats, and we don't know if S appears once or twice

<guess>SOBIA</guess>",SOBIA,"From the three guesses we have:

Letters known to be in the word: A, O, S  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, E, L, N, C, T  

Positions ruled out so far:
- A: not in 1 (AROSE), not in 2 (SALON), not in 3 (COAST) → must be in 4 or 5
- O: not in 3 (AROSE), not in 4 (SALON), not in 2 (COAST) → must be in 1 or 5
- S: not in 4 (AROSE), not in 1 (SALON), not in 5 (COAST) → must be in 2 or 3

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, O, S exactly once each.
2. Places A in position 4 or 5.
3. Places O in position 1 or 5.
4. Places S in position 2 or 3.
5. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no R, E, L, N, C, T).

Let's consider possible placements:

Case 1: O in 1, A in 4, S in 2 or 3
- O _ S _ A → needs two more letters (not ruled out)
- Possible: O S _ _ A → but S would be in 2, need 3rd and 4th letters
  - O S _ _ A: need two new letters, e.g., O S P I A (but ""OSPIA"" isn't a word)
  - O S _ _ A: ""O S A _ _"" doesn't fit A in 4
Actually, O _ _ A _ with S in 2 or 3:
- O S _ A _ → need 3rd and 5th letters, e.g., O S I A D (not a word)
- O _ S A _ → need 2nd and 5th letters, e.g., O M S A D (not a word)

Case 2: O in 1, A in 5, S in 2 or 3
- O _ S _ A or O _ _ S A
- O S _ _ A: need 3rd and 4th, e.g., O S I D A (not a word)
- O _ S _ A: need 2nd and 4th, e.g., O M S I A (not a word)

Case 3: O in 5, A in 4, S in 2 or 3
- _ _ A S O or _ _ S A O
- _ S A S O: repeats S
- _ _ A S O: need 1st and 2nd letters, e.g., D I A S O (not a word)
- _ S _ A O: need 2nd and 4th, e.g., P S I A O (not a word)

Case 4: O in 5, A in 5 (impossible) - skip

Wait, let's try concrete words:
We need A in 4 or 5, O in 1 or 5, S in 2 or 3, and two new letters from remaining (allowed letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Looking for words:
- O S _ A _ : ""OSA**"" - no common word
- _ O S _ A : ""O S A**"" - no
- _ S O A _ : ""S O A**"" - no
- S O _ A _ : ""S O A**"" - no

Alternative: ""ADIOS"" - but A is 1st (ruled out), D and I are new
""ASIDE"" - has E (ruled out)
""ASHOR"" - has R (ruled out)
""SOAKY"" - has K and Y, but A is 3rd (allowed), O is 2nd (allowed), S is 1st (ruled out)
""SOAPY"" - O is 2nd (allowed), S is 1st (ruled out)
""SWASH"" - repeats S
""SWAYS"" - repeats S

Wait, let's think differently - maybe A is 5th, O is 1st, S is 2nd or 3rd:
- O _ S _ A: ""O S _ _ A"" - need 3rd and 4th letters, e.g., O S I D A (not a word)
- O _ _ S A: ""O _ _ S A"" - need 2nd and 3rd, e.g., O M I S A (not a word)

Hmm, let's try ""SOUND"" - but U and N, N is ruled out
""STONY"" - T and N are ruled out
""SHOWN"" - H, W, N - N ruled out
""SHOUT"" - T ruled out
""SWISH"" - repeats S
""SWISH"" - no

Wait, let's try ""SPOOF"" - but P, F are new, but A and O not present
Need to include A, O, S.

Let's try ""FOAMY"" - but M, Y new, but A is 3rd (allowed), O is 2nd (allowed), S missing
""FOSSA"" - has S, A, but O is 2nd (allowed), A is 5th (allowed), S is 3rd (allowed), F and O are new
But ""FOSSA"" is a word (a type of mollusk)

Check positions:
F (new), O (2nd), S (3rd), S (repeats), A (5th) - but S repeats, and we don't know if S appears once or twice
But the problem says ""5-letter word"" without specifying unique letters, so repeats possible

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll choose a word that uses several of these letters. A good strategy is to use a word with no repeated letters to maximize information gain. 

Looking at these common letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains A, R, O, S, E - five of the most common English letters, all in different positions. This will give me information about the presence and position of these very common letters in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, E
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, O, S
- A is somewhere in positions 2-5
- O is somewhere in positions 1, 2, 4, 5
- S is somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, 5

We also know positions 1, 3, 4, 5 have no R or E, and positions 1, 3, 4 have no O in their original spots.

Next guess should:
1. Keep A, O, S in new positions
2. Introduce new common letters (avoid R, E)
3. Use a word structure that tests new positions for A, O, S

Good candidates: 
- SAINT (has S, A, O in new positions, but O isn't present)
- STOAS (has S, O, A but repeats S)
- SALON (has A, S, O in new positions and introduces L, N)

SALON looks good: S (position 1), A (position 2), L (new), O (position 4), N (new). This tests:
- S in position 1
- A in position 2
- O in position 4
- Introduces L and N

Guess 2: SALON -> FEEDBACK: S(-) A(-) L(x) O(-) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two previous guesses we know:

Letters NOT in the word: R, E, L, N  
Letters that ARE in the word: A, O, S  

Positions ruled out so far:

A: not in 1 (AROSE), not in 2 (SALON)  
O: not in 3 (AROSE), not in 4 (SALON)  
S: not in 4 (AROSE), not in 1 (SALON)  

So the remaining possible positions are:

A: 3, 4, 5  
O: 1, 2, 5  
S: 2, 3, 5  

We need a 5-letter word that uses A, O, S exactly once each and only in the still-allowed positions, plus two new letters (avoiding R, E, L, N).  
A good candidate is “COAST”:

C (new), O (allowed in 2), A (allowed in 3), S (allowed in 4), T (new).  
Checks:  
- Contains A, O, S in still-allowed spots.  
- Adds two new letters (C, T) that haven’t been tested yet.  
- No disallowed letters.  

Hence COAST is a strong next guess.

From the three guesses we have:

Letters known to be in the word: A, O, S  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, E, L, N, C, T  

Positions ruled out so far:
- A: not in 1 (AROSE), not in 2 (SALON), not in 3 (COAST) → must be in 4 or 5
- O: not in 3 (AROSE), not in 4 (SALON), not in 2 (COAST) → must be in 1 or 5
- S: not in 4 (AROSE), not in 1 (SALON), not in 5 (COAST) → must be in 2 or 3

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, O, S exactly once each.
2. Places A in position 4 or 5.
3. Places O in position 1 or 5.
4. Places S in position 2 or 3.
5. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no R, E, L, N, C, T).

Let's consider possible placements:

Case 1: O in 1, A in 4, S in 2 or 3
- O _ S _ A → needs two more letters (not ruled out)
- Possible: O S _ _ A → but S would be in 2, need 3rd and 4th letters
  - O S _ _ A: need two new letters, e.g., O S P I A (but ""OSPIA"" isn't a word)
  - O S _ _ A: ""O S A _ _"" doesn't fit A in 4
Actually, O _ _ A _ with S in 2 or 3:
- O S _ A _ → need 3rd and 5th letters, e.g., O S I A D (not a word)
- O _ S A _ → need 2nd and 5th letters, e.g., O M S A D (not a word)

Case 2: O in 1, A in 5, S in 2 or 3
- O _ S _ A or O _ _ S A
- O S _ _ A: need 3rd and 4th, e.g., O S I D A (not a word)
- O _ S _ A: need 2nd and 4th, e.g., O M S I A (not a word)

Case 3: O in 5, A in 4, S in 2 or 3
- _ _ A S O or _ _ S A O
- _ S A S O: repeats S
- _ _ A S O: need 1st and 2nd letters, e.g., D I A S O (not a word)
- _ S _ A O: need 2nd and 4th, e.g., P S I A O (not a word)

Case 4: O in 5, A in 5 (impossible) - skip

Wait, let's try concrete words:
We need A in 4 or 5, O in 1 or 5, S in 2 or 3, and two new letters from remaining (allowed letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Looking for words:
- O S _ A _ : ""OSA**"" - no common word
- _ O S _ A : ""O S A**"" - no
- _ S O A _ : ""S O A**"" - no
- S O _ A _ : ""S O A**"" - no

Alternative: ""ADIOS"" - but A is 1st (ruled out), D and I are new
""ASIDE"" - has E (ruled out)
""ASHOR"" - has R (ruled out)
""SOAKY"" - has K and Y, but A is 3rd (allowed), O is 2nd (allowed), S is 1st (ruled out)
""SOAPY"" - O is 2nd (allowed), S is 1st (ruled out)
""SWASH"" - repeats S
""SWAYS"" - repeats S

Wait, let's think differently - maybe A is 5th, O is 1st, S is 2nd or 3rd:
- O _ S _ A: ""O S _ _ A"" - need 3rd and 4th letters, e.g., O S I D A (not a word)
- O _ _ S A: ""O _ _ S A"" - need 2nd and 3rd, e.g., O M I S A (not a word)

Hmm, let's try ""SOUND"" - but U and N, N is ruled out
""STONY"" - T and N are ruled out
""SHOWN"" - H, W, N - N ruled out
""SHOUT"" - T ruled out
""SWISH"" - repeats S
""SWISH"" - no

Wait, let's try ""SPOOF"" - but P, F are new, but A and O not present
Need to include A, O, S.

Let's try ""FOAMY"" - but M, Y new, but A is 3rd (allowed), O is 2nd (allowed), S missing
""FOSSA"" - has S, A, but O is 2nd (allowed), A is 5th (allowed), S is 3rd (allowed), F and O are new
But ""FOSSA"" is a word (a type of mollusk)

Check positions:
F (new), O (2nd), S (3rd), S (repeats), A (5th) - but S repeats, and we don't know if S appears once or twice
But the problem says ""5-letter word"" without specifying unique letters, so repeats possible
But we have no info about repeats yet

However, ""FOSSA"" has two S's, which might not be optimal for info

Better: ""SOUND"" - but N ruled out
""SOAKY"" - K, Y new, S 1st (ruled out)
""SOBIA"" - I, B new, S 1st (ruled out)
""SOAKY"" - S 1st (ruled out)

Wait, let's try ""SWORD"" - but W, D new, S 1st (ruled out)
""SPASM"" - repeats S
""SPRAY"" - but R, Y - R ruled out
""SPASM"" - repeats S

Alternative: ""BOAST"" - but T ruled out
""BOSSA"" - repeats S
""BOSSY"" - repeats S

Let's try ""SALVO"" - but L ruled out
""SAVOR"" - R ruled out
""SAUCE"" - C, E ruled out
""SAVIA"" - repeats A
""SAVON"" - N ruled out

""VASAL"" - L ruled out
""VAPID"" - D, P new, but A is 2nd (ruled out)

Wait, let's think of words with A in 4 or 5, O in 1 or 5, S in 2 or 3:

Possible structure:
- O _ S _ A
- O _ _ S A
- _ O S _ A
- _ O _ S A
- _ S O _ A
- _ S _ O A
- S _ O _ A
- S _ _ O A
- S _ A O _ (but A must be 4 or 5)
- etc.

Looking for actual words:
- ""OCEAN"" - but C, N ruled out
- ""OZONE"" - repeats O and Z, N ruled out
- ""OSPREY"" - too long
- ""OSCAR"" - C ruled out
- ""OSAMA"" - M new, but A is 5th (allowed), O is 1st (allowed), S is 2nd (allowed), A is 3rd (ruled out in COAST), but A must be 4 or 5
Wait, ""OSAMA"" has A in 3rd - ruled out

""OPIUM"" - but P, U, M new, but A missing
""OPALS"" - has A in 4th (allowed), O in 1st (allowed), S in 5th (ruled out for S), P, L new - but S can't be 5th
""OPALS"" - S is 5th (ruled out), so invalid

""OPIAS"" - has A in 4th (allowed), O in 1st (allowed), S in 5th (ruled out)
Invalid

""OPIUM"" - no A

""OVALE"" - E ruled out
""OVARY"" - R ruled out
""OVENS"" - N, S - N ruled out

""SAVIA"" - A is 4th (allowed), O missing
""SAVAN"" - N ruled out

""VOGAS"" - G, V new, but O is 2nd (allowed), A is 4th (allowed), S is 5th (ruled out)
""VOGAS"" - S is 5th (ruled out)

""VOILA"" - L, I new, but A is 5th (allowed), O is 2nd (allowed), S missing

""VOCAL"" - C, L ruled out
""VOCAD"" - D new, but A is 3rd (ruled out)

""VAPID"" - P, I, D new, A is 2nd (ruled out)

""VOGUS"" - S is 5th (ruled out)

""VOGUT"" - T ruled out

""VOGUE"" - E ruled out

""VOGAL"" - L ruled out

""VOGAW"" - not a word

""VOGAY"" - not a word

""VOGAZ"" - Z new, but A is 5th (allowed), O is 2nd (allowed), S is 5th (ruled out)

""VOGAS"" - S is 5th (ruled out)

Hmm, seems like finding a word that fits is tricky. Let's try ""SWORD"" - but S is 1st (ruled out)

""SWAMI"" - W, M, I new, but S is 1st (ruled out)
""SWASH"" - repeats S
""SWAYS"" - repeats S
""SWINE"" - N, I new, but S is 1st (ruled out)

""SOBIA"" - but A is 4th (allowed), O is 1st (allowed), S is 2nd (allowed), I, B new
""SOBIA"" is a valid word (a plant genus)

Check positions:
S (2nd allowed), O (1st allowed), B (new), I (new), A (4th allowed) - all constraints met

Thus, ""SOBIA"" is a valid next guess.

From the four guesses we have:

Letters known to be in the word: A, O, S  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, E, L, N, C, T, B, I  

Positions ruled out so far:
- A: not in 1 (AROSE), not in 2 (SALON), not in 3 (COAST), not in 5 (SOBIA) → must be in 4
- O: not in 3 (AROSE), not in 4 (SALON), not in 2 (COAST), not in 2 (SOBIA) → must be in 1 or 5
- S: not in 4 (AROSE), not in 1 (SALON), not in 5 (COAST), not in 1 (SOBIA) → must be in 2 or 3

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, O, S exactly once each.
2. Places A in position 4.
3. Places O in position 1 or 5.
4. Places S in position 2 or 3.
5. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no R, E, L, N, C, T, B, I).

Let’s test the two cases for O:

Case 1: O in 1, A in 4, S in 2 or 3
- O _ S _ A or O _ _ S A
  - O S _ _ A: need two new letters (must be from allowed set: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)
    Possible: O S M A D (not a word), O S P A D (not a word), O S K A D (not a word)
  - O _ S _ A: need two new letters
    Possible: O M S A D (not a word), O P S A D (not a word), O H S A D (not a word)

Case 2: O in 5, A in 4, S in 2 or 3
- _ _ A S O or _ _ S A O
  - _ S A S O: repeats S (invalid)
  - _ _ A S O: need two new letters
    Possible: D S A M O (not a word), H S A M O (not a word), M S A M O (not a word)
  - _ _ S A O: need two new letters
    Possible: D H S A O (not a word), M P S A O (not a word), K M S A O (not a word)

Looking for actual words that fit:
- O _ S _ A: ""OSMA**"" – no
- O _ _ S A: ""OMSA**"" – no
- _ _ A S O: ""DASMO"" – no
- _ _ S A O: ""KESMO"" – no

Wait, let’s try ""DASHO"" – but H, D new, S in 3, A in 4, O in 5
Check positions:
D (new), A (4), S (3), H (new), O (5) – all constraints met
""DASHO"" is a valid word (a type of administrative district in some countries)

Thus, ""DASHO"" is a valid next guess.
