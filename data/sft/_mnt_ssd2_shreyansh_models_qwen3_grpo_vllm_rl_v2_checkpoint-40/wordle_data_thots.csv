### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters and different vowels/consonants. 

Common letters in 5-letter words include: A, E, T, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U, M, W, F, G, Y, P, B.

Looking at these, a strong starting word would be something like ""AROSE"" or ""SLATE"" because they contain multiple vowels and common consonants. However, ""AROSE"" has 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S), which might be good. 

Another good option is ""STARE"" - similar to AROSE but with S and T. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters.

- S must be in position 2 or 5  
- Forbidden letters: A, R, E, P, I, L  
- Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

- M O S T Y → MOSTY (invalid)  
- N U S T Y → NUSTY (invalid)  
- T O S T Y → TOSTY (invalid)

Forbidden letters: A, R, E, P, I, L  
Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Valid words:

- C S O U T → CSOUT (invalid)  
- D S O U N → DSOUN (invalid)  
- F S O U T → FSOUT (invalid)  
- G S O U T → GSOUT (invalid)  
- H S O U T → HSOUT (invalid)  
- M S O U T → MSOUT (invalid)  

This seems impossible. Let me re-examine the constraints.

Wait, I missed ""J"" and ""Q"" as possible letters. Let me try:

- J U S T O → JUSTO (invalid)  
- Q U O S T → QUOST (invalid)  

Another approach: look up 5-letter words with O in position 3 and S in position 2 or 5, excluding forbidden letters.

Upon checking, valid English words:
- C H O S E → invalid (E)  
- D O S S Y → invalid  
- F O U S T → invalid  
- G U S T O → invalid  
- M O S T Y → invalid  

Actually, ""CHOPS"" is a valid word (means to chop), but P is forbidden.

""CHOTS"" is valid but has T and S.

""CHOTS"" - C H O T S  
- C, H, O, T, S  
- O is in position 3 (✓)  
- S is in position 5 (allowed)  
- No A, R, E, P, I, L

Wait, I missed ""J"" and ""Q"" as possible letters. Let me try:

- J U S T O → JUSTO (invalid)  
- Q U O S T → QUOST (invalid)  

Another approach: look up 5-letter words with O in position 3 and S in position 2 or 5, excluding forbidden letters.

- C H O S E → invalid (E)  
- D O S S Y → invalid  
- F O U S T → invalid

""CHOTS"" is valid but has T and S.

""CHOTS"" - C H O T S  
- C, H, O, T, S  
- O is in position 3 (✓)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters and different vowels/consonants. 

Common letters in 5-letter words include: A, E, T, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U, M, W, F, G, Y, P, B.

Looking at these, a strong starting word would be something like ""AROSE"" or ""SLATE"" because they contain multiple vowels and common consonants. However, ""AROSE"" has 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S), which might be good. 

Another good option is ""STARE"" - similar to AROSE but with S and T. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- O: in the word and in the correct position (✓) → position 3 is O
- S: in the word but in the wrong position (-) → S is in the word, but not in position 4
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word has O in position 3.
- It contains S somewhere, but not in position 4.
- It does not contain A, R, or E.

We need a word with:
- O in the third position.
- S somewhere else (positions 1, 2, or 5).
- No A, R, or E.

Possible letters left (excluding A, R, E): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let's try to find a word that fits:
- _ _ O _ _ with S in position 1, 2, or 5.

Possible candidates:
- SPOIL (S P O I L) - S in position 1, O in 3, no A/R/E
- SMOKE - but has E
- STONY - but has T and N, no E
- SNOUT - has U, N, T
- STOIC - has C, I
- SLOTH - has H

""SPOIL"" seems good - S, P, O, I, L - all allowed letters, O in 3rd, S in 1st.

Guess 2: SPOIL -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) O(✓) I(x) L(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)  
   - O is locked in position 3.  
   - S exists in the word but is NOT in position 4 (from AROSE) and NOT in position 1 (from SPOIL).  
   - Letters A, R, E, P, I, L are all absent.

2. SPOIL → S(-) P(x) O(✓) I(x) L(x)  
   - Confirms O in position 3 again.  
   - S is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4.  
   - P, I, L are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ _  
- Must contain S in position 2 or 5.  
- Forbidden letters: A, R, E, P, I, L  
- Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s look for 5-letter words that fit _ _ O _ _ with S in position 2 or 5, and only the allowed letters.

Candidate words:
- B S O U N → BSOUN (not a valid word)  
- C H O R S → CHORS (not valid)

- M O U S T → MOUSE (invalid, has E)  
- N U S T Y → NUSTY (invalid)  
- S C O P Y → SCOpy (invalid, has P)  

Wait, let’s re-examine allowed letters and positions carefully.

We need:
- Position 3: O (fixed)  
- S must be in position 2 or 5  
- Forbidden letters: A, R, E, P, I, L  
- Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Valid words:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters and different vowels/consonants. 

Common letters in 5-letter words include: A, E, T, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U, M, W, F, G, Y, P, B.

Looking at these, a strong starting word would be something like ""AROSE"" or ""SLATE"" because they contain multiple vowels and common consonants. However, ""AROSE"" has 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S), which might be good. 

Another good option is ""STARE"" - similar to AROSE but with S and T. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- O: in the word and in the correct position (✓) → position 3 is O
- S: in the word but in the wrong position (-) → S is in the word, but not in position 4
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word has O in position 3.
- It contains S somewhere, but not in position 4.
- It does not contain A, R, or E.

We need a word with:
- O in the third position.
- S somewhere else (positions 1, 2, or 5).
- No A, R, or E.

Possible letters left (excluding A, R, E): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let's try to find a word that fits:
- _ _ O _ _ with S in position 1, 2, or 5.

Possible candidates:
- SPOIL (S P O I L) - S in position 1, O in 3, no A/R/E
- SMOKE - but has E
- STONY - but has T and N, no E
- SNOUT - has U, N, T
- STOIC - has C, I
- SLOTH - has H

""SPOIL"" seems good - S, P, O, I, L - all allowed letters, O in 3rd, S in 1st.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: SPOIL -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) O(✓) I(x) L(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)  
   - O is locked in position 3.  
   - S exists in the word but is NOT in position 4 (from AROSE) and NOT in position 1 (from SPOIL).  
   - Letters A, R, E, P, I, L are all absent.

2. SPOIL → S(-) P(x) O(✓) I(x) L(x)  
   - Confirms O in position 3 again.  
   - S is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4.  
   - P, I, L are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ _  
- Must contain S in position 2 or 5.  
- Forbidden letters: A, R, E, P, I, L  
- Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s look for 5-letter words that fit _ _ O _ _ with S in position 2 or 5, and only the allowed letters.

Candidate words:
- B S O U N → BSOUN (not a valid word)  
- C H O R S → CHORS (not valid)  
- C O S M I → COSMI (invalid, has I)  
- D O S S A → DOSSA (invalid, has A)  
- F O U S T → FOUST (invalid)  
- M O U S E → MOUSE (invalid, has E)  
- N U S T O → NUSTO (invalid)  
- T O U S S → TOUSS (invalid)  
- V O S S A → VOSSA (invalid)  
- W O S T E → WOSTE (invalid)  
- Y O U S H → Yoush (invalid)  

Valid English words that fit:
- B O S S Y → BOSSY (but S is in position 3, not allowed)  
- C H O S E → CHOSE (invalid, has E)  
- D O S S Y → DOSSY (invalid)  
- F O U S T → FOUST (invalid)  
- M O U S T → MOUSE (invalid, has E)  
- N U S T Y → NUSTY (invalid)  
- S C O P Y → SCOpy (invalid, has P)  

Wait, let’s re-examine allowed letters and positions carefully.

We need:
- Position 3: O (fixed)  
- S must be in position 2 or 5  
- Forbidden letters: A, R, E, P, I, L  
- Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Valid words:
- B U S T Y → BUSTY (S in position 3, not allowed)  
- C H O S E → CHOSE (invalid, has E)  
- D O S S Y → DOSSY (invalid)  
- F O U S T → FOUST (invalid)  
- G U S T O → GUSTO (invalid, has O in position 5)  
- H O S T S → HOSTS (invalid, has S in position 4)  
- J O S T Y → JOSTY (invalid)  
- K N O S T → KNOST (invalid)  
- M O S T Y → MOSTY (invalid)  
- N U S T Y → NUSTY (invalid)  
- T O S S Y → TOSYS (invalid)  

Hmm, let me think differently. Maybe S is in position 5.

Pattern: _ _ O _ S  
Forbidden letters: A, R, E, P, I, L  
Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Valid words:
- B U N K S → BUNKS (invalid, has U and N, but no forbidden letters)  
- C H O R S → CHORS (invalid)  
- C O N S T → CONST (invalid)  
- D O N K S → DONKS (invalid)  
- F U N K S → FUNKS (invalid)  
- G U N K S → GUNKS (invalid)  
- H U N K S → HUNKS (invalid)  
- M O N K S → MONKS (invalid)  
- N U N K S → NUNKS (invalid)  
- T O N K S → TONKS (invalid)  

Wait, let me list valid English words that fit _ _ O _ _ with S in position 2 or 5 and no forbidden letters.

Valid words:
- B U S T Y → BUSTY (S in position 3, not allowed)  
- C H O S E → CHOSE (invalid, has E)  
- D O S S Y → DOSSY (invalid)  
- F O U S T → FOUST (invalid)  
- G U S T O → GUSTO (invalid)  
- H O S T S → HOSTS (invalid)  
- J O S T Y → JOSTY (invalid)  
- K N O S T → KNOST (invalid)  
- M O S T Y → MOSTY (invalid)  
- N U S T Y → NUSTY (invalid)  
- T O S T Y → TOSTY (invalid)  

I’m struggling to find valid words. Let me try S in position 2:

Pattern: _ S O _ _  
Forbidden letters: A, R, E, P, I, L  
Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Valid words:
- B S O U N → BSOUN (invalid)  
- C S O U T → CSOUT (invalid)  
- D S O U N → DSOUN (invalid)  
- F S O U T → FSOUT (invalid)  
- G S O U T → GSOUT (invalid)  
- H S O U T → HSOUT (invalid)  
- M S O U T → MSOUT (invalid)  

This seems impossible. Let me re-examine the constraints.

Wait, I missed ""J"" and ""Q"" as possible letters. Let me try:

- J U S T O → JUSTO (invalid)  
- Q U O S T → QUOST (invalid)  

Another approach: look up 5-letter words with O in position 3 and S in position 2 or 5, excluding forbidden letters.

Upon checking, valid English words:
- C H O S E → invalid (E)  
- D O S S Y → invalid  
- F O U S T → invalid  
- G U S T O → invalid  
- M O S T Y → invalid  

Actually, ""CHOPS"" is a valid word (means to chop), but P is forbidden.

""CHOTS"" is valid but has T and S.

""CHOTS"" - C H O T S  
- C, H, O, T, S  
- O is in position 3 (✓)  
- S is in position 5 (allowed)  
- No A, R, E, P, I, L  

This fits perfectly!

Let's carefully reconcile the new feedback with what we already know.

1. From AROSE:
   - A, R, E are not in the word.
   - O is in position 3.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

2. From SPOIL:
   - P, I, L are not in the word.
   - S is not in position 1 (because SPOIL had S in position 1 and it got “-”).

3. From CHOTS:
   - C is not in the word.
   - H is in position 2 and correct.
   - O is confirmed in position 3.
   - T is in position 4 and correct.
   - S is in position 5 and correct.

4. From GHOST:
   - G is not in the word.
   - H is still correct in position 2.
   - O is still correct in position 3.
   - S is now marked “-” in position 5, which contradicts the CHOTS feedback that said S was “✓” in position 5.

This contradiction means my previous interpretation must have been wrong. Let me re-examine the feedback carefully:

- CHOTS feedback: C(x) H(✓) O(✓) T(✓) S(✓)  
  This clearly states S is in position 5 and correct.

- GHOST feedback: G(x) H(✓) O(✓) T(-) S(-)  
  Here, T is marked “-” (wrong position) and S is marked “-” (wrong position), which directly contradicts the CHOTS feedback that T and S were both “✓” in positions 4 and 5 respectively.

The only logical conclusion is that the feedback provided in Guess 4 (GHOST) contains an error. Since we cannot rely on contradictory information, I will proceed with the confirmed correct positions from CHOTS:

- Positions: _ H O T S  
- First letter must be chosen from remaining allowed letters: B, D, F, J, K, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Among these, the only valid English word is “BHOST” (but that’s not a word), “DHOST” (invalid), … until we reach “WHOTS” (invalid). However, “WHOTS” is not valid. 

But wait — the correct valid word that fits _HOST is “BHOST” (invalid), “DHOST” (invalid), … until we realize “JHOST” is invalid. 

Actually, the only valid English word that matches _HOST is:

- BHOST – invalid  
- DHOST – invalid  
- FHOST – invalid  
- GHOST – already tried (G is invalid)  
- JHOST – invalid  
- KHOST – invalid  
- MHOST – invalid  
- NHOTS – invalid  
- QHOST – invalid  
- THOTS – invalid  
- VHOTS – invalid  
- WHOTS – invalid  
- XHOST – invalid  
- YHOST – invalid  
- ZHOST – invalid  

None of these are valid except “GHOST” which we already saw fails. This implies the only possible word must be “BHOST” which is invalid. 

But this suggests I made an error in interpreting the feedback. Let me re-express the pattern:

From CHOTS: positions 2,3,4,5 are H,O,T,S respectively. Thus pattern is _HOST. 

Valid English word: “BHOST” is invalid, but “HOSTS” is 6 letters. 

Wait — the only valid 5-letter word that is _HOST is “BHOST” which is not valid. This indicates the feedback must be read carefully.

Upon closer inspection, the feedback for CHOTS shows S as “✓” in position 5, meaning S is correct in position 5. The feedback for GHOST shows S as “-” in position 5, which contradicts.

This contradiction implies the feedback for GHOST must have been mis-typed. Assuming the CHOTS feedback is correct, the word must be _HOST, but no valid 5-letter word fits except “BHOST” which is invalid. 

However, the only valid English word that is 5 letters and ends with HOST is “HOSTS” which is 6 letters. This indicates the word must be “BHOST” which is invalid. 

But this is impossible. Therefore, the only possible resolution is that the word is “HOSTS” but that’s 6 letters. This suggests the feedback for GHOST must have intended T as “✓” and S as “-”, meaning S is in the word but not in position 5. 

Re-reading the feedback carefully:

- GHOST feedback: G(x) H(✓) O(✓) T(-) S(-)  
  - H is correct in position 2.  
  - O is correct in position 3.  
  - T is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - S is in the word but not in position 5.  

This changes everything. The correct pattern is now:

- Position 2: H (fixed)  
- Position 3: O (fixed)  
- T must be in position 1 or 5 (but not 4)  
- S must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5)  

Forbidden letters: A, C, E, I, L, P, R, G  

Allowed letters for positions 1,4,5: B, D, F, J, K, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, T, S  

We need to find a word that:

- Has H in position 2 and O in position 3.  
- Contains T and S somewhere.  
- Does not use forbidden letters.  

Possible patterns:

- T _ O _ S  
- T _ O S _  
- _ H O T S (but S cannot be in position 5)  
- _ H O S T (T in position 5)  

Let’s explore:

1. T _ O _ S  
   - T H O _ S → THONS (valid word)  
   - T B O N S → T BONS (invalid)  
   - T D O N S → T DONS (invalid)  
   - T F O N S → T FONS (invalid)  
   - T M O N S → T MONS (invalid)  

   Valid word: THONS (means a type of fabric or haircut)

2. T _ O S _  
   - T H O S _ → THOS_ (invalid)  
   - T B O S _ → T BOS_ (invalid)  

3. _ H O S T  
   - B H O S T → BHOTS (invalid)  
   - D H O S T → DHOTS (invalid)  
   - F H O S T → FHOTS (invalid)  
   - M H O S T → MHOTS (invalid)  
   - N H O S T → NHOTS (invalid)  

   No valid words here.

Thus, the only valid candidate is THONS.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters and different vowels/consonants. 

Common letters in 5-letter words include: A, E, T, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U, M, W, F, G, Y, P, B.

Looking at these, a strong starting word would be something like ""AROSE"" or ""SLATE"" because they contain multiple vowels and common consonants. However, ""AROSE"" has 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S), which might be good. 

Another good option is ""STARE"" - similar to AROSE but with S and T. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- O: in the word and in the correct position (✓) → position 3 is O
- S: in the word but in the wrong position (-) → S is in the word, but not in position 4
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word has O in position 3.
- It contains S somewhere, but not in position 4.
- It does not contain A, R, or E.

We need a word with:
- O in the third position.
- S somewhere else (positions 1, 2, or 5).
- No A, R, or E.

Possible letters left (excluding A, R, E): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let's try to find a word that fits:
- _ _ O _ _ with S in position 1, 2, or 5.

Possible candidates:
- SPOIL (S P O I L) - S in position 1, O in 3, no A/R/E
- SMOKE - but has E
- STONY - but has T and N, no E
- SNOUT - has U, N, T
- STOIC - has C, I
- SLOTH - has H

""SPOIL"" seems good - S, P, O, I, L - all allowed letters, O in 3rd, S in 1st.

<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)  
   - O is locked in position 3.  
   - S exists in the word but is NOT in position 4 (from AROSE) and NOT in position 1 (from SPOIL).  
   - Letters A, R, E, P, I, L are all absent.

2. SPOIL → S(-) P(x) O(✓) I(x) L(x)  
   - Confirms O in position 3 again.  
   - S is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4.  
   - P, I, L are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ _  
- Must contain S in position 2 or 5.  
- Forbidden letters: A, R, E, P, I, L  
- Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s look for 5-letter words that fit _ _ O _ _ with S in position 2 or 5, and only the allowed letters.

Candidate words:
- B S O U N → BSOUN (not a valid word)  
- C H O R S → CHORS (not valid)  
- C O S M I → COSMI (invalid, has I)  
- D O S S A → DOSSA (invalid, has A)  
- F O U S T → FOUST (invalid)  
- M O U S E → MOUSE (invalid, has E)  
- N U S T O → NUSTO (invalid)  
- T O U S S → TOUSS (invalid)  
- V O S S A → VOSSA (invalid)  
- W O S T E → WOSTE (invalid)  
- Y O U S H → Yoush (invalid)  

Valid English words that fit:
- B O S S Y → BOSSY (but S is in position 3, not allowed)  
- C H O S E → CHOSE (invalid, has E)  
- D O S S Y → DOSSY (invalid)  
- F O U S T → FOUST (invalid)  
- M O U S T → MOUSE (invalid, has E)  
- N U S T Y → NUSTY (invalid)  
- S C O P Y → SCOpy (invalid, has P)  

Wait, let’s re-examine allowed letters and positions carefully.

We need:
- Position 3: O (fixed)  
- S must be in position 2 or 5  
- Forbidden letters: A, R, E, P, I, L  
- Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Valid words:
- B U S T Y → BUSTY (S in position 3, not allowed)  
- C H O S E → CHOSE (invalid, has E)  
- D O S S Y → DOSSY (invalid)  
- F O U S T → FOUST (invalid)  
- G U S T O → GUSTO (invalid, has O in position 5)  
- H O S T S → HOSTS (invalid, has S in position 4)  
- J O S T Y → JOSTY (invalid)  
- K N O S T → KNOST (invalid)  
- M O S T Y → MOSTY (invalid)  
- N U S T Y → NUSTY (invalid)  
- T O S S Y → TOSYS (invalid)  

Hmm, let me think differently. Maybe S is in position 5.

Pattern: _ _ O _ S  
Forbidden letters: A, R, E, P, I, L  
Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Valid words:
- B U N K S → BUNKS (invalid, has U and N, but no forbidden letters)  
- C H O R S → CHORS (invalid)  
- C O N S T → CONST (invalid)  
- D O N K S → DONKS (invalid)  
- F U N K S → FUNKS (invalid)  
- G U N K S → GUNKS (invalid)  
- H U N K S → HUNKS (invalid)  
- M O N K S → MONKS (invalid)  
- N U N K S → NUNKS (invalid)  
- T O N K S → TONKS (invalid)  

Wait, let me list valid English words that fit _ _ O _ _ with S in position 2 or 5 and no forbidden letters.

Valid words:
- B U S T Y → BUSTY (S in position 3, not allowed)  
- C H O S E → CHOSE (invalid, has E)  
- D O S S Y → DOSSY (invalid)  
- F O U S T → FOUST (invalid)  
- G U S T O → GUSTO (invalid)  
- H O S T S → HOSTS (invalid)  
- J O S T Y → JOSTY (invalid)  
- K N O S T → KNOST (invalid)  
- M O S T Y → MOSTY (invalid)  
- N U S T Y → NUSTY (invalid)  
- T O S T Y → TOSTY (invalid)  

I’m struggling to find valid words. Let me try S in position 2:

Pattern: _ S O _ _  
Forbidden letters: A, R, E, P, I, L  
Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Valid words:
- B S O U N → BSOUN (invalid)  
- C S O U T → CSOUT (invalid)  
- D S O U N → DSOUN (invalid)  
- F S O U T → FSOUT (invalid)  
- G S O U T → GSOUT (invalid)  
- H S O U T → HSOUT (invalid)  
- M S O U T → MSOUT (invalid)  

This seems impossible. Let me re-examine the constraints.

Wait, I missed ""J"" and ""Q"" as possible letters. Let me try:

- J U S T O → JUSTO (invalid)  
- Q U O S T → QUOST (invalid)  

Another approach: look up 5-letter words with O in position 3 and S in position 2 or 5, excluding forbidden letters.

Upon checking, valid English words:
- C H O S E → invalid (E)  
- D O S S Y → invalid  
- F O U S T → invalid  
- G U S T O → invalid  
- M O S T Y → invalid  

Actually, ""CHOPS"" is a valid word (means to chop), but P is forbidden.

""CHOTS"" is valid but has T and S.

""CHOTS"" - C H O T S  
- C, H, O, T, S  
- O is in position 3 (✓)  
- S is in position 5 (allowed)  
- No A, R, E, P, I, L  

This fits perfectly!

- H(✓) – H is in the word and already in the correct position (position 2).
- O(✓) – O is confirmed in position 3.
- T(✓) – T is in the word and already in the correct position (position 4).
- S(✓) – S is in the word and already in the correct position (position 5).

So the pattern is now: _ H O T S.

We only need to find the first letter.  
Forbidden letters so far: A, C, E, I, L, P, R.  
Allowed remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for valid 5-letter English words that start with any of these letters and fit _ H O T S:

- BHOST – invalid (not a word)
- DHOST – invalid
- FHOST – invalid
- GHOST – valid word
- JHOST – invalid
- KHOST – invalid
- MHOST – invalid
- NHOTS – invalid
- QHOST – invalid
- UHOST – invalid
- VHOTS – invalid
- WHOTS – invalid
- XHOST – invalid
- YHOST – invalid
- ZHOST – invalid

Only “GHOST” is a legitimate English word that matches _ H O T S.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SPOIL -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) O(✓) I(x) L(x)

Guess 4: GHOST -> FEEDBACK: G(x) H(✓) O(✓) S(-) T(-)

Let's carefully reconcile the new feedback with what we already know.

1. From AROSE:
   - A, R, E are not in the word.
   - O is in position 3.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

2. From SPOIL:
   - P, I, L are not in the word.
   - S is not in position 1 (because SPOIL had S in position 1 and it got “-”).

3. From CHOTS:
   - C is not in the word.
   - H is in position 2 and correct.
   - O is confirmed in position 3.
   - T is in position 4 and correct.
   - S is in position 5 and correct.

4. From GHOST:
   - G is not in the word.
   - H is still correct in position 2.
   - O is still correct in position 3.
   - S is now marked “-” in position 5, which contradicts the CHOTS feedback that said S was “✓” in position 5.

This contradiction means my previous interpretation must have been wrong. Let me re-examine the feedback carefully:

- CHOTS feedback: C(x) H(✓) O(✓) T(✓) S(✓)  
  This clearly states S is in position 5 and correct.

- GHOST feedback: G(x) H(✓) O(✓) T(-) S(-)  
  Here, T is marked “-” (wrong position) and S is marked “-” (wrong position), which directly contradicts the CHOTS feedback that T and S were both “✓” in positions 4 and 5 respectively.

The only logical conclusion is that the feedback provided in Guess 4 (GHOST) contains an error. Since we cannot rely on contradictory information, I will proceed with the confirmed correct positions from CHOTS:

- Positions: _ H O T S  
- First letter must be chosen from remaining allowed letters: B, D, F, J, K, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Among these, the only valid English word is “BHOST” (but that’s not a word), “DHOST” (invalid), … until we reach “WHOTS” (invalid). However, “WHOTS” is not valid. 

But wait — the correct valid word that fits _HOST is “BHOST” (invalid), “DHOST” (invalid), … until we realize “JHOST” is invalid. 

Actually, the only valid English word that matches _HOST is:

- BHOST – invalid  
- DHOST – invalid  
- FHOST – invalid  
- GHOST – already tried (G is invalid)  
- JHOST – invalid  
- KHOST – invalid  
- MHOST – invalid  
- NHOTS – invalid  
- QHOST – invalid  
- THOTS – invalid  
- VHOTS – invalid  
- WHOTS – invalid  
- XHOST – invalid  
- YHOST – invalid  
- ZHOST – invalid  

None of these are valid except “GHOST” which we already saw fails. This implies the only possible word must be “BHOST” which is invalid. 

But this suggests I made an error in interpreting the feedback. Let me re-express the pattern:

From CHOTS: positions 2,3,4,5 are H,O,T,S respectively. Thus pattern is _HOST. 

Valid English word: “BHOST” is invalid, but “HOSTS” is 6 letters. 

Wait — the only valid 5-letter word that is _HOST is “BHOST” which is not valid. This indicates the feedback must be read carefully.

Upon closer inspection, the feedback for CHOTS shows S as “✓” in position 5, meaning S is correct in position 5. The feedback for GHOST shows S as “-” in position 5, which contradicts.

This contradiction implies the feedback for GHOST must have been mis-typed. Assuming the CHOTS feedback is correct, the word must be _HOST, but no valid 5-letter word fits except “BHOST” which is invalid. 

However, the only valid English word that is 5 letters and ends with HOST is “HOSTS” which is 6 letters. This indicates the word must be “BHOST” which is invalid. 

But this is impossible. Therefore, the only possible resolution is that the word is “HOSTS” but that’s 6 letters. This suggests the feedback for GHOST must have intended T as “✓” and S as “-”, meaning S is in the word but not in position 5. 

Re-reading the feedback carefully:

- GHOST feedback: G(x) H(✓) O(✓) T(-) S(-)  
  - H is correct in position 2.  
  - O is correct in position 3.  
  - T is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - S is in the word but not in position 5.  

This changes everything. The correct pattern is now:

- Position 2: H (fixed)  
- Position 3: O (fixed)  
- T must be in position 1 or 5 (but not 4)  
- S must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5)  

Forbidden letters: A, C, E, I, L, P, R, G  

Allowed letters for positions 1,4,5: B, D, F, J, K, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, T, S  

We need to find a word that:

- Has H in position 2 and O in position 3.  
- Contains T and S somewhere.  
- Does not use forbidden letters.  

Possible patterns:

- T _ O _ S  
- T _ O S _  
- _ H O T S (but S cannot be in position 5)  
- _ H O S T (T in position 5)  

Let’s explore:

1. T _ O _ S  
   - T H O _ S → THONS (valid word)  
   - T B O N S → T BONS (invalid)  
   - T D O N S → T DONS (invalid)  
   - T F O N S → T FONS (invalid)  
   - T M O N S → T MONS (invalid)  

   Valid word: THONS (means a type of fabric or haircut)

2. T _ O S _  
   - T H O S _ → THOS_ (invalid)  
   - T B O S _ → T BOS_ (invalid)  

3. _ H O S T  
   - B H O S T → BHOTS (invalid)  
   - D H O S T → DHOTS (invalid)  
   - F H O S T → FHOTS (invalid)  
   - M H O S T → MHOTS (invalid)  
   - N H O S T → NHOTS (invalid)  

   No valid words here.

Thus, the only valid candidate is THONS.

From the new feedback on THONS:

- T(✓) – T is in the word and already in the correct position (position 1).
- H(✓) – H is in the word and already in the correct position (position 2).
- O(✓) – O is in the word and already in the correct position (position 3).
- N(x) – N is not in the word.
- S(✓) – S is in the word and already in the correct position (position 5).

So the pattern is now completely determined: T H O _ S.

We only need to find the fourth letter.  
Forbidden letters so far: A, C, E, I, L, N, P, R, G.  
Allowed remaining letters: B, D, F, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for valid 5-letter English words that fit T H O _ S:

- THOSE – contains E (forbidden).  
- THOSE – invalid.  
- THOBS – invalid.  
- THOCS – invalid.  
- THODS – invalid.  
- THOMS – contains M (allowed).  
- THOPS – contains P (forbidden).  
- THOTS – contains T (already in position 1, but T can repeat).  
- THOVS – invalid.  
- THOWS – invalid.  
- THOXS – invalid.  

The only valid word among these is **THOMS** (a surname, but recognized as a word).

However, let’s double-check the dictionary: **THO** + ? + **S**.

Valid dictionary entry: **THOMS** (a variant spelling of “thums” or a surname). It is acceptable in Scrabble/Wordle lists.

Therefore, the secret word must be **THOMS**.
