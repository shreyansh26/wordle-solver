### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or more letters in the secret word.

Let me think about why this is a strong choice:
1. It covers 5 unique letters, which is optimal for the first guess.
2. It has 3 vowels, which are very common in English words.
3. It has R and S, two of the most common consonants in English.
4. The letters are all distinct, which helps eliminate many possibilities quickly.

This should give us good coverage to narrow down the possibilities for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter O, but not in position 3.
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, or E.

We now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes O (but not in the 3rd position).
2. Excludes A, R, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to gain more information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since O is already known to be present).

Let me try a word like ""POINT"":
- P, I, N, T are all new letters.
- O is in position 2 (different from position 3 in AROSE), satisfying the feedback.
- No A, R, S, E are used.

This should help determine the position of O and test new letters.
