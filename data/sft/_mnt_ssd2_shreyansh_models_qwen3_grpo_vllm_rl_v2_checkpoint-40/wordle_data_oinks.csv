### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- Two common consonants (R, S) that appear frequently in 5-letter words
- No repeated letters, maximizing the information gained from the feedback

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (from both feedback sets):
A, R, E, U, D.

Letters that ARE in the word (but currently in wrong positions):
O, S, N.

Positions ruled out so far:
- O cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE) or position 2 (from SOUND).
- S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) or position 1 (from SOUND).
- N cannot be in position 4 (from SOUND).

So the word must contain O, S, N and may not contain A, R, E, U, D.

Available letters (besides O, S, N) are: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to place O, S, N into three of the five positions, respecting the position bans above, and fill the remaining two slots with any of the available letters.

Possible positions for O: 1, 4, 5 (cannot be 2 or 3)
Possible positions for S: 1, 2, 3, 5 (cannot be 4)
Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3, 5 (cannot be 4)

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints. One systematic way is to test permutations of O, S, N among the positions and see if any valid English word emerges.

Try placing O in position 1, S in position 2, N in position 3: O S N _ _
Need two more letters from the available set. Let’s pick H and I (common letters not yet used). That gives “OSNHI” – not a valid English word.

Try O in position 1, S in position 3, N in position 2: O N S _ _
Pick H and I again: “ONSHI” – not valid.

Try O in position 4, S in position 1, N in position 2: S N O _ _
Pick H and I: “SNOHI” – not valid.

Try O in position 5, S in position 1, N in position 2: S N _ _ O
Pick H and I: “SNHIO” – not valid.

Let’s try a different permutation: O in position 1, N in position 2, S in position 5: O N _ _ S
Pick H and I: “ON HIS” – “ON HIS” is not a word.

Try O in position 4, N in position 1, S in position 2: N S _ O _
Pick H and I: “NSHOI” – not valid.

Try O in position 5, N in position 1, S in position 2: N S _ _ O
Pick H and I: “NSHIO” – not valid.

Try O in position 1, S in position 2, N in position 5: O S _ _ N
Pick H and I: “OSHIN” – that’s a valid English word!

Let me verify the constraints:
- Contains O, S, N – yes.
- O is in position 1 (allowed).
- S is in position 2 (allowed).
- N is in position 5 (allowed).
- No A, R, E, U, D – yes.
- Uses H and I which are new and allowed.

So “OSHIN” seems to be a valid next guess.

Let's update what we know after the third guess.

Letters that are NOT in the word (from all feedback):
A, R, E, U, D, H.

Letters that ARE in the word and their current status:
- O: confirmed in position 1 (✓).
- S: in the word but wrong positions so far (from AROSE: not 4, from SOUND: not 1, from OSHIN: not 2).
- N: in the word but wrong positions so far (from SOUND: not 4, from OSHIN: not 5).
- I: in the word but wrong position (from OSHIN: not 4).

So the word must contain:
- O in position 1.
- S somewhere (positions 2,3,5 allowed).
- N somewhere (positions 2,3,5 allowed).
- I somewhere (positions 2,3,5 allowed).

Also, we can use any letters not yet ruled out (B, C, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z).

We need to place S, N, I into positions 2,3,5 (since position 1 is O and position 4 is invalid for all three).

Possible permutations:
- Position 2: S, N, or I
- Position 3: S, N, or I
- Position 5: S, N, or I

Let's try to find a valid word:

Option 1: O S N I _ → ""OSNIX"" (not valid)
Option 2: O S I N _ → ""OSINN"" (invalid, N repeated)
Option 3: O N S I _ → ""ONSI_"" → ""ONSIT"" (not valid)
Option 4: O N I S _ → ""ONIS_"" → ""ONIST"" (not valid)
Option 5: O I S N _ → ""OISN_"" → ""OISNS"" (invalid)
Option 6: O I N S _ → ""OIN_S"" → ""OINSA"" (invalid, A ruled out)

Let's try ""O S _ N I"" → ""OS_NI"" → ""OSKNI"" (invalid)
""O S _ I N"" → ""OS_I_N"" → ""OSKIN"" (valid word!)

Check constraints:
- O in position 1 (✓)
- S in position 2 (allowed)
- K is new and allowed
- I in position 4 (allowed)
- N in position 5 (allowed)

Also, no banned letters are used.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- Two common consonants (R, S) that appear frequently in 5-letter words
- No repeated letters, maximizing the information gained from the feedback

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word contains:
- O and S somewhere, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, R, E at all.

Letters still in play: O, S plus any other letters not yet tested (B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

I need a new word that:
1. Includes both O and S.
2. Places O somewhere other than position 3.
3. Places S somewhere other than position 4.
4. Avoids A, R, E.

A good candidate is ""SOUND"":
- Contains S and O.
- S is in position 1 (not 4, so allowed).
- O is in position 2 (not 3, so allowed).
- Uses new letters U, N, D which haven't been tested yet.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (from both feedback sets):
A, R, E, U, D.

Letters that ARE in the word (but currently in wrong positions):
O, S, N.

Positions ruled out so far:
- O cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE) or position 2 (from SOUND).
- S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) or position 1 (from SOUND).
- N cannot be in position 4 (from SOUND).

So the word must contain O, S, N and may not contain A, R, E, U, D.

Available letters (besides O, S, N) are: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to place O, S, N into three of the five positions, respecting the position bans above, and fill the remaining two slots with any of the available letters.

Possible positions for O: 1, 4, 5 (cannot be 2 or 3)
Possible positions for S: 1, 2, 3, 5 (cannot be 4)
Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3, 5 (cannot be 4)

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints. One systematic way is to test permutations of O, S, N among the positions and see if any valid English word emerges.

Try placing O in position 1, S in position 2, N in position 3: O S N _ _
Need two more letters from the available set. Let’s pick H and I (common letters not yet used). That gives “OSNHI” – not a valid English word.

Try O in position 1, S in position 3, N in position 2: O N S _ _
Pick H and I again: “ONSHI” – not valid.

Try O in position 4, S in position 1, N in position 2: S N O _ _
Pick H and I: “SNOHI” – not valid.

Try O in position 5, S in position 1, N in position 2: S N _ _ O
Pick H and I: “SNHIO” – not valid.

Let’s try a different permutation: O in position 1, N in position 2, S in position 5: O N _ _ S
Pick H and I: “ON HIS” – “ON HIS” is not a word.

Try O in position 4, N in position 1, S in position 2: N S _ O _
Pick H and I: “NSHOI” – not valid.

Try O in position 5, N in position 1, S in position 2: N S _ _ O
Pick H and I: “NSHIO” – not valid.

Try O in position 1, S in position 2, N in position 5: O S _ _ N
Pick H and I: “OSHIN” – that’s a valid English word!

Let me verify the constraints:
- Contains O, S, N – yes.
- O is in position 1 (allowed).
- S is in position 2 (allowed).
- N is in position 5 (allowed).
- No A, R, E, U, D – yes.
- Uses H and I which are new and allowed.

So “OSHIN” seems to be a valid next guess.

- I: in the word but wrong position (from OSHIN: not 4).

So the word must contain:
- O in position 1.
- S somewhere (positions 2,3,5 allowed).
- N somewhere (positions 2,3,5 allowed).
- I somewhere (positions 2,3,5 allowed).

Also, we can use any letters not yet ruled out (B, C, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z).

We need to place S, N, I into positions 2,3,5 (since position 1 is O and position 4 is invalid for all three).

Possible permutations:
- Position 2: S, N, or I
- Position 3: S, N, or I
- Position 5: S, N, or I

Let's try to find a valid word:

Option 1: O S N I _ → ""OSNIX"" (not valid)
Option 2: O S I N _ → ""OSINN"" (invalid, N repeated)
Option 3: O N S I _ → ""ONSI_"" → ""ONSIT"" (not valid)
Option 4: O N I S _ → ""ONIS_"" → ""ONIST"" (not valid)
Option 5: O I S N _ → ""OISN_"" → ""OISNS"" (invalid)
Option 6: O I N S _ → ""OIN_S"" → ""OINSA"" (invalid, A ruled out)

Let's try ""O S _ N I"" → ""OS_NI"" → ""OSKNI"" (invalid)
""O S _ I N"" → ""OS_I_N"" → ""OSKIN"" (valid word!)

Check constraints:
- O in position 1 (✓)
- S in position 2 (allowed)
- K is new and allowed
- I in position 4 (allowed)
- N in position 5 (allowed)

Also, no banned letters are used.

Let’s summarize everything we know after four guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x in any position):
A, R, E, U, D, H, K.

Letters that ARE in the word (but currently in wrong positions):
- O is fixed in position 1 (✓).
- S must appear somewhere, but NOT in positions 1, 2, 4 (from SOUND and OSHIN/OSKIN).
  – Allowed positions for S: 3 or 5.
- I must appear somewhere, but NOT in positions 2, 4 (from OSHIN/OSKIN).
  – Allowed positions for I: 3 or 5.
- N must appear somewhere, but NOT in positions 4, 5 (from SOUND/OSHIN).
  – Allowed positions for N: 2 or 3.

So the word looks like:
O _ _ _ _
with the remaining letters {S, I, N} and one more letter from the still-allowed set:
B, C, F, G, J, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to place S, I, N into positions 2, 3, 5 (position 4 is banned for all of them), respecting their individual bans.

Possible positions:
- N can be in 2 or 3.
- S can be in 3 or 5.
- I can be in 3 or 5.

Let’s enumerate the valid permutations of S, I, N across positions 2,3,5:

1. N in 2:
   - 2: N
   - 3: must be S or I
   - 5: must be the remaining of S/I

   a) N S I → O N S I _ → need a 5th letter, but we already have O, N, S, I. The word would be ONSI?, which is 4 letters. We need one more letter, but we’ve already placed all required letters. This implies the word is O N S I plus one more letter, but we only have 5 positions. Actually, we have O _ _ _ _, and we need to place N, S, I plus one more letter. This suggests we need a 5th letter from the allowed set.

   Let me rephrase: the word has 5 letters, with O fixed in position 1. The remaining 4 positions must contain S, I, N and one more allowed letter. But we have 4 positions and 4 letters (S, I, N, and one extra). So the word is O followed by a permutation of [S, I, N, X], where X is an allowed letter.

   So possible words:
   - O N S I X → but we need a 5-letter word, so this would be O N S I ? which is 4 letters. Actually, the structure is O _ _ _ _, and we need to place S, I, N into 3 of the remaining 4 positions, plus one more letter.

   Let me think differently: the word is O _ _ _ _, and must contain S, I, N. So the remaining 4 positions must contain S, I, N and one more letter. The positions for S, I, N are restricted:
   - S: 3 or 5
   - I: 3 or 5
   - N: 2 or 3

   Let’s try placing N in position 2:
   - Position 2: N
   - Then S and I must be in positions 3 and 5 (since they can’t be in 4, and 2 is taken by N).
   - So possible:
     - Position 3: S → then position 5: I → word: O N S _ I → need a letter for position 4. But position 4 cannot be S, I, N, O. Allowed letters: B, C, F, G, J, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.
     - So O N S ? I → looking for a valid word: ONSTI (invalid), ONSCI (invalid), ONSSI (invalid), ONSP I (invalid), etc. Not finding any valid words here.

   - Position 3: I → then position 5: S → word: O N I _ S → need a letter for position 4. Possible: ONIPS (invalid), ONIGS (invalid), ONILS (invalid), etc. Not finding valid words.

2. N in 3:
   - Position 3: N
   - Then S and I must be in positions 5 (since they can’t be in 4, and 3 is taken by N).
   - But we have two letters (S, I) and only one position (5) to place them, which is impossible. So N cannot be in position 3.

Thus, the only possible placement is N in position 2, and S and I in positions 3 and 5 in some order, with a valid letter in position 4.

Looking for valid English words:
- O N S _ I → ""ONSET"" – but T is allowed, and this fits:
  - O(1) N(2) S(3) E(4) T(5) – but E is banned (from AROSE).
- O N _ S I → ""ONASI"" – invalid.
- O N _ I S → ""ONBIS"" – invalid.

Wait, let me systematically list possible letters for position 4:
Allowed letters: B, C, F, G, J, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Try:
- O N S B I → ""ON BSI"" – invalid.
- O N S C I → ""ONSCI"" – invalid.
- O N S F I → ""ON SFI"" – invalid.
- O N S G I → ""ONSGI"" – invalid.
- O N S J I → ""ON SJI"" – invalid.
- O N S L I → ""ONSLI"" – invalid.
- O N S M I → ""ONSMI"" – invalid.
- O N S P I → ""ON SPI"" – invalid.
- O N S T I → ""ONSTI"" – invalid.
- O N S V I → ""ON SVI"" – invalid.
- O N S W I → ""ON SWI"" – invalid.
- O N S X I → ""ON SXI"" – invalid.
- O N S Y I → ""ON SYI"" – invalid.
- O N S Z I → ""ON SZI"" – invalid.

None of these seem valid. Let me try the other permutation:
N in position 2, I in position 3, S in position 5:
- O N I _ S → need a letter for position 4.
Possible words:
- O N I B S → ""ONIBS"" – invalid.
- O N I C S → ""ONICS"" – invalid.
- O N I F S → ""ONIFS"" – invalid.
- O N I G S → ""ONIGS"" – invalid.
- O N I J S → ""ON IJS"" – invalid.
- O N I L S → ""ONILS"" – invalid.
- O N I M S → ""ONIMS"" – invalid.
- O N I P S → ""ONIPS"" – invalid.
- O N I T S → ""ONITS"" – invalid.
- O N I V S → ""ONIVS"" – invalid.
- O N I W S → ""ONIWS"" – invalid.
- O N I X S → ""ONIXS"" – invalid.
- O N I Y S → ""ONIYS"" – invalid.
- O N I Z S → ""ONIZS"" – invalid.

Hmm, not finding valid words. Maybe I missed a letter or permutation. Let me re-examine the allowed letters and possible placements.

Wait, the word must be O _ _ _ _, contain S, I, N, and one more allowed letter. The remaining positions are 2,3,4,5. We have to place S, I, N into three of these, plus one more letter.

Given the restrictions:
- S: 3 or 5
- I: 3 or 5
- N: 2 or 3

Let me try:
- Position 2: N
- Position 3: S
- Then I must be in 5, and we need a letter for position 4:
  - O N S _ I → ""ONSET"" – but E is banned.
  - ""ONSCO"" – but C is allowed, but this is 5 letters: O N S C O – but O is repeated and banned for position 4 (no, O is only banned in positions 2,3,5 for some letters, but O is already in position 1).
  - Actually, ""ONSET"" is invalid due to E.
  - ""ONSTI"" – invalid.
  - ""ONSP I"" – invalid.

This seems problematic. Maybe I missed a valid word.

Wait, let me try ""O N I S T"" – but this would be:
- O(1) N(2) I(3) S(4) T(5) – but S cannot be in 4 (from SOUND: S(-) means not in 4).

Another approach: list possible 5-letter words starting with O, containing S, I, N, and no banned letters.

Possible candidates:
- ""ONION"" – but O is repeated and position 4 is N, which is allowed, but N cannot be in 5 (from SOUND: N(-) in 4, but 5 is allowed). However, this word has O twice, which is possible, but we have no info against it. Let's check:
  - O(1) N(2) I(3) O(4) N(5) – but O is already in position 1, and we don't know if O repeats. Also, N in 5 is allowed (from SOUND: N(-) in 4, so 5 is allowed). But we have no confirmation O repeats. This seems risky.

- ""OFTEN"" – but F, T, E, N are allowed, but E is banned.

- ""OVENS"" – but V is allowed, but E is banned.

- ""ONSET"" – E banned.

- ""ONION"" seems the closest, but has O twice. Let me check if it fits all constraints:
  - O in 1 (✓)
  - N in 2 (allowed)
  - I in 3 (allowed)
  - O in 4 (no restriction, but we don't know if O repeats)
  - N in 5 (allowed)

But we have no evidence O repeats, and we want to test new letters. Maybe there's another word.

Wait, let me think of ""OPIUM"" – but P, U, M – U is banned.

""OPENS"" – E banned.

""OLIVE"" – E banned.

""OFTEN"" – E banned.

""OXIDE"" – E banned.

""OZONE"" – Z, O repeats, E banned.

""OPIUM"" – U banned.

""OPALS"" – A banned.

""OPENS"" – E banned.

""OVARY"" – A, R, Y – R banned.

""OVENS"" – E banned.

""OWENS"" – E banned.

""OZONE"" – E banned.

""OPERA"" – A, R, E banned.

This suggests ""ONION"" might be the only possible word left that fits the constraints, despite the O repetition. Let me verify:
- O in 1 (✓)
- N in 2 (allowed)
- I in 3 (allowed)
- O in 4 (no restriction)
- N in 5 (allowed)

And it uses only allowed letters (no A, R, E, U, D, H, K).

Thus, ""ONION"" seems to be the logical next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- Two common consonants (R, S) that appear frequently in 5-letter words
- No repeated letters, maximizing the information gained from the feedback

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word contains:
- O and S somewhere, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, R, E at all.

Letters still in play: O, S plus any other letters not yet tested (B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

I need a new word that:
1. Includes both O and S.
2. Places O somewhere other than position 3.
3. Places S somewhere other than position 4.
4. Avoids A, R, E.

A good candidate is ""SOUND"":
- Contains S and O.
- S is in position 1 (not 4, so allowed).
- O is in position 2 (not 3, so allowed).
- Uses new letters U, N, D which haven't been tested yet.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (from both feedback sets):
A, R, E, U, D.

Letters that ARE in the word (but currently in wrong positions):
O, S, N.

Positions ruled out so far:
- O cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE) or position 2 (from SOUND).
- S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) or position 1 (from SOUND).
- N cannot be in position 4 (from SOUND).

So the word must contain O, S, N and may not contain A, R, E, U, D.

Available letters (besides O, S, N) are: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to place O, S, N into three of the five positions, respecting the position bans above, and fill the remaining two slots with any of the available letters.

Possible positions for O: 1, 4, 5 (cannot be 2 or 3)
Possible positions for S: 1, 2, 3, 5 (cannot be 4)
Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3, 5 (cannot be 4)

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints. One systematic way is to test permutations of O, S, N among the positions and see if any valid English word emerges.

Try placing O in position 1, S in position 2, N in position 3: O S N _ _
Need two more letters from the available set. Let’s pick H and I (common letters not yet used). That gives “OSNHI” – not a valid English word.

Try O in position 1, S in position 3, N in position 2: O N S _ _
Pick H and I again: “ONSHI” – not valid.

Try O in position 4, S in position 1, N in position 2: S N O _ _
Pick H and I: “SNOHI” – not valid.

Try O in position 5, S in position 1, N in position 2: S N _ _ O
Pick H and I: “SNHIO” – not valid.

Let’s try a different permutation: O in position 1, N in position 2, S in position 5: O N _ _ S
Pick H and I: “ON HIS” – “ON HIS” is not a word.

Try O in position 4, N in position 1, S in position 2: N S _ O _
Pick H and I: “NSHOI” – not valid.

Try O in position 5, N in position 1, S in position 2: N S _ _ O
Pick H and I: “NSHIO” – not valid.

Try O in position 1, S in position 2, N in position 5: O S _ _ N
Pick H and I: “OSHIN” – that’s a valid English word!

Let me verify the constraints:
- Contains O, S, N – yes.
- O is in position 1 (allowed).
- S is in position 2 (allowed).
- N is in position 5 (allowed).
- No A, R, E, U, D – yes.
- Uses H and I which are new and allowed.

So “OSHIN” seems to be a valid next guess.

Let's update what we know after the third guess.

Letters that are NOT in the word (from all feedback):
A, R, E, U, D, H.

Letters that ARE in the word and their current status:
- O: confirmed in position 1 (✓).
- S: in the word but wrong positions so far (from AROSE: not 4, from SOUND: not 1, from OSHIN: not 2).
- N: in the word but wrong positions so far (from SOUND: not 4, from OSHIN: not 5).
- I: in the word but wrong position (from OSHIN: not 4).

So the word must contain:
- O in position 1.
- S somewhere (positions 2,3,5 allowed).
- N somewhere (positions 2,3,5 allowed).
- I somewhere (positions 2,3,5 allowed).

Also, we can use any letters not yet ruled out (B, C, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z).

We need to place S, N, I into positions 2,3,5 (since position 1 is O and position 4 is invalid for all three).

Possible permutations:
- Position 2: S, N, or I
- Position 3: S, N, or I
- Position 5: S, N, or I

Let's try to find a valid word:

Option 1: O S N I _ → ""OSNIX"" (not valid)
Option 2: O S I N _ → ""OSINN"" (invalid, N repeated)
Option 3: O N S I _ → ""ONSI_"" → ""ONSIT"" (not valid)
Option 4: O N I S _ → ""ONIS_"" → ""ONIST"" (not valid)
Option 5: O I S N _ → ""OISN_"" → ""OISNS"" (invalid)
Option 6: O I N S _ → ""OIN_S"" → ""OINSA"" (invalid, A ruled out)

Let's try ""O S _ N I"" → ""OS_NI"" → ""OSKNI"" (invalid)
""O S _ I N"" → ""OS_I_N"" → ""OSKIN"" (valid word!)

Check constraints:
- O in position 1 (✓)
- S in position 2 (allowed)
- K is new and allowed
- I in position 4 (allowed)
- N in position 5 (allowed)

Also, no banned letters are used.

So ""OSKIN"" seems valid.

Let’s summarize everything we know after four guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x in any position):
A, R, E, U, D, H, K.

Letters that ARE in the word (but currently in wrong positions):
- O is fixed in position 1 (✓).
- S must appear somewhere, but NOT in positions 1, 2, 4 (from SOUND and OSHIN/OSKIN).
  – Allowed positions for S: 3 or 5.
- I must appear somewhere, but NOT in positions 2, 4 (from OSHIN/OSKIN).
  – Allowed positions for I: 3 or 5.
- N must appear somewhere, but NOT in positions 4, 5 (from SOUND/OSHIN).
  – Allowed positions for N: 2 or 3.

So the word looks like:
O _ _ _ _
with the remaining letters {S, I, N} and one more letter from the still-allowed set:
B, C, F, G, J, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to place S, I, N into positions 2, 3, 5 (position 4 is banned for all of them), respecting their individual bans.

Possible positions:
- N can be in 2 or 3.
- S can be in 3 or 5.
- I can be in 3 or 5.

Let’s enumerate the valid permutations of S, I, N across positions 2,3,5:

1. N in 2:
   - 2: N
   - 3: must be S or I
   - 5: must be the remaining of S/I

   a) N S I → O N S I _ → need a 5th letter, but we already have O, N, S, I. The word would be ONSI?, which is 4 letters. We need one more letter, but we’ve already placed all required letters. This implies the word is O N S I plus one more letter, but we only have 5 positions. Actually, we have O _ _ _ _, and we need to place N, S, I plus one more letter. This suggests we need a 5th letter from the allowed set.

   Let me rephrase: the word has 5 letters, with O fixed in position 1. The remaining 4 positions must contain S, I, N and one more allowed letter. But we have 4 positions and 4 letters (S, I, N, and one extra). So the word is O followed by a permutation of [S, I, N, X], where X is an allowed letter.

   So possible words:
   - O N S I X → but we need a 5-letter word, so this would be O N S I ? which is 4 letters. Actually, the structure is O _ _ _ _, and we need to place S, I, N into 3 of the remaining 4 positions, plus one more letter.

   Let me think differently: the word is O _ _ _ _, and must contain S, I, N. So the remaining 4 positions must contain S, I, N and one more letter. The positions for S, I, N are restricted:
   - S: 3 or 5
   - I: 3 or 5
   - N: 2 or 3

   Let’s try placing N in position 2:
   - Position 2: N
   - Then S and I must be in positions 3 and 5 (since they can’t be in 4, and 2 is taken by N).
   - So possible:
     - Position 3: S → then position 5: I → word: O N S _ I → need a letter for position 4. But position 4 cannot be S, I, N, O. Allowed letters: B, C, F, G, J, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.
     - So O N S ? I → looking for a valid word: ONSTI (invalid), ONSCI (invalid), ONSSI (invalid), ONSP I (invalid), etc. Not finding any valid words here.

   - Position 3: I → then position 5: S → word: O N I _ S → need a letter for position 4. Possible: ONIPS (invalid), ONIGS (invalid), ONILS (invalid), etc. Not finding valid words.

2. N in 3:
   - Position 3: N
   - Then S and I must be in positions 5 (since they can’t be in 4, and 3 is taken by N).
   - But we have two letters (S, I) and only one position (5) to place them, which is impossible. So N cannot be in position 3.

Thus, the only possible placement is N in position 2, and S and I in positions 3 and 5 in some order, with a valid letter in position 4.

Looking for valid English words:
- O N S _ I → ""ONSET"" – but T is allowed, and this fits:
  - O(1) N(2) S(3) E(4) T(5) – but E is banned (from AROSE).
- O N _ S I → ""ONASI"" – invalid.
- O N _ I S → ""ONBIS"" – invalid.

Wait, let me systematically list possible letters for position 4:
Allowed letters: B, C, F, G, J, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Try:
- O N S B I → ""ON BSI"" – invalid.
- O N S C I → ""ONSCI"" – invalid.
- O N S F I → ""ON SFI"" – invalid.
- O N S G I → ""ONSGI"" – invalid.
- O N S J I → ""ON SJI"" – invalid.
- O N S L I → ""ONSLI"" – invalid.
- O N S M I → ""ONSMI"" – invalid.
- O N S P I → ""ON SPI"" – invalid.
- O N S T I → ""ONSTI"" – invalid.
- O N S V I → ""ON SVI"" – invalid.
- O N S W I → ""ON SWI"" – invalid.
- O N S X I → ""ON SXI"" – invalid.
- O N S Y I → ""ON SYI"" – invalid.
- O N S Z I → ""ON SZI"" – invalid.

None of these seem valid. Let me try the other permutation:
N in position 2, I in position 3, S in position 5:
- O N I _ S → need a letter for position 4.
Possible words:
- O N I B S → ""ONIBS"" – invalid.
- O N I C S → ""ONICS"" – invalid.
- O N I F S → ""ONIFS"" – invalid.
- O N I G S → ""ONIGS"" – invalid.
- O N I J S → ""ON IJS"" – invalid.
- O N I L S → ""ONILS"" – invalid.
- O N I M S → ""ONIMS"" – invalid.
- O N I P S → ""ONIPS"" – invalid.
- O N I T S → ""ONITS"" – invalid.
- O N I V S → ""ONIVS"" – invalid.
- O N I W S → ""ONIWS"" – invalid.
- O N I X S → ""ONIXS"" – invalid.
- O N I Y S → ""ONIYS"" – invalid.
- O N I Z S → ""ONIZS"" – invalid.

Hmm, not finding valid words. Maybe I missed a letter or permutation. Let me re-examine the allowed letters and possible placements.

Wait, the word must be O _ _ _ _, contain S, I, N, and one more allowed letter. The remaining positions are 2,3,4,5. We have to place S, I, N into three of these, plus one more letter.

Given the restrictions:
- S: 3 or 5
- I: 3 or 5
- N: 2 or 3

Let me try:
- Position 2: N
- Position 3: S
- Then I must be in 5, and we need a letter for position 4:
  - O N S _ I → ""ONSET"" – but E is banned.
  - ""ONSCO"" – but C is allowed, but this is 5 letters: O N S C O – but O is repeated and banned for position 4 (no, O is only banned in positions 2,3,5 for some letters, but O is already in position 1).
  - Actually, ""ONSET"" is invalid due to E.
  - ""ONSTI"" – invalid.
  - ""ONSP I"" – invalid.

This seems problematic. Maybe I missed a valid word.

Wait, let me try ""O N I S T"" – but this would be:
- O(1) N(2) I(3) S(4) T(5) – but S cannot be in 4 (from SOUND: S(-) means not in 4).

Another approach: list possible 5-letter words starting with O, containing S, I, N, and no banned letters.

Possible candidates:
- ""ONION"" – but O is repeated and position 4 is N, which is allowed, but N cannot be in 5 (from SOUND: N(-) in 4, but 5 is allowed). However, this word has O twice, which is possible, but we have no info against it. Let's check:
  - O(1) N(2) I(3) O(4) N(5) – but O is already in position 1, and we don't know if O repeats. Also, N in 5 is allowed (from SOUND: N(-) in 4, so 5 is allowed). But we have no confirmation O repeats. This seems risky.

- ""OFTEN"" – but F, T, E, N are allowed, but E is banned.

- ""OVENS"" – but V is allowed, but E is banned.

- ""ONSET"" – E banned.

- ""ONION"" seems the closest, but has O twice. Let me check if it fits all constraints:
  - O in 1 (✓)
  - N in 2 (allowed)
  - I in 3 (allowed)
  - O in 4 (no restriction, but we don't know if O repeats)
  - N in 5 (allowed)

But we have no evidence O repeats, and we want to test new letters. Maybe there's another word.

Wait, let me think of ""OPIUM"" – but P, U, M – U is banned.

""OPENS"" – E banned.

""OLIVE"" – E banned.

""OFTEN"" – E banned.

""OXIDE"" – E banned.

""OZONE"" – Z, O repeats, E banned.

""OPIUM"" – U banned.

""OPALS"" – A banned.

""OPENS"" – E banned.

""OVARY"" – A, R, Y – R banned.

""OVENS"" – E banned.

""OWENS"" – E banned.

""OZONE"" – E banned.

""OPERA"" – A, R, E banned.

This suggests ""ONION"" might be the only possible word left that fits the constraints, despite the O repetition. Let me verify:
- O in 1 (✓)
- N in 2 (allowed)
- I in 3 (allowed)
- O in 4 (no restriction)
- N in 5 (allowed)

And it uses only allowed letters (no A, R, E, U, D, H, K).

Thus, ""ONION"" seems to be the logical next guess.

So the word is O followed by a permutation of [S, I, N, X], where X is an allowed letter.\n\n   So possible words:\n   - O N S I X → but we need a 5-letter word, so this would be O N S I ? which is 4 letters. Actually, the structure is O _ _ _ _, and we need to place S, I, N into 3 of the remaining 4 positions, plus one more letter.\n\n   Let me think differently: the word is O _ _ _ _, and must contain S, I, N. So the remaining 4 positions must contain S, I, N and one more letter. The positions for S, I, N are restricted:\n   - S: 3 or 5\n   - I: 3 or 5\n   - N: 2 or 3\n\n   Let’s try placing N in position 2:\n   - Position 2: N\n   - Then S and I must be in positions 3 and 5 (since they can’t be in 4, and 2 is taken by N).\n   - So possible:\n     - Position 3: S → then position 5: I → word: O N S _ I → need a letter for position 4. But position 4 cannot be S, I, N, O. Allowed letters: B, C, F, G, J, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n     - So O N S ? I → looking for a valid word: ONSTI (invalid), ONSCI (invalid), ONSSI (invalid), ONSP I (invalid), etc. Not finding any valid words here.\n\n   - Position 3: I → then position 5: S → word: O N I _ S → need a letter for position 4. Possible: ONIPS (invalid), ONIGS (invalid), ONILS (invalid), etc. Not finding valid words.\n\n2. N in 3:\n   - Position 3: N\n   - Then S and I must be in positions 5 (since they can’t be in 4, and 3 is taken by N).\n   - But we have two letters (S, I) and only one position (5) to place them, which is impossible. So N cannot be in position 3.\n\nThus, the only possible placement is N in position 2, and S and I in positions 3 and 5 in some order, with a valid letter in position 4.\n\nLooking for valid English words:\n- O N S _ I → ""ONSET"" – but T is allowed, and this fits:\n  - O(1) N(2) S(3) E(4) T(5) – but E is banned (from AROSE).\n- O N _ S I → ""ONASI"" – invalid.\n- O N _ I S → ""ONBIS"" – invalid.\n\nWait, let me systematically list possible letters for position 4:\nAllowed letters: B, C, F, G, J, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nTry:\n- O N S B I → ""ON BSI"" – invalid.\n- O N S C I → ""ONSCI"" – invalid.\n- O N S F I → ""ON SFI"" – invalid.\n- O N S G I → ""ONSGI"" – invalid.\n- O N S J I → ""ON SJI"" – invalid.\n- O N S L I → ""ONSLI"" – invalid.\n- O N S M I → ""ONSMI"" – invalid.\n- O N S P I → ""ON SPI"" – invalid.\n- O N S T I → ""ONSTI"" – invalid.\n- O N S V I → ""ON SVI"" – invalid.\n- O N S W I → ""ON SWI"" – invalid.\n- O N S X I → ""ON SXI"" – invalid.\n- O N S Y I → ""ON SYI"" – invalid.\n- O N S Z I → ""ON SZI"" – invalid.\n\nNone of these seem valid. Let me try the other permutation:\nN in position 2, I in position 3, S in position 5:\n- O N I _ S → need a letter for position 4.\nPossible words:\n- O N I B S → ""ONIBS"" – invalid.\n- O N I C S → ""ONICS"" – invalid.\n- O N I F S → ""ONIFS"" – invalid.\n- O N I G S → ""ONIGS"" – invalid.\n- O N I J S → ""ON IJS"" – invalid.\n- O N I L S → ""ONILS"" – invalid.\n- O N I M S → ""ONIMS"" – invalid.\n- O N I P S → ""ONIPS"" – invalid.\n- O N I T S → ""ONITS"" – invalid.\n- O N I V S → ""ONIVS"" – invalid.\n- O N I W S → ""ONIWS"" – invalid.\n- O N I X S → ""ONIXS"" – invalid.\n- O N I Y S → ""ONIYS"" – invalid.\n- O N I Z S → ""ONIZS"" – invalid.\n\nHmm, not finding valid words. Maybe I missed a letter or permutation. Let me re-examine the allowed letters and possible placements.\n\nWait, the word must be O _ _ _ _, contain S, I, N, and one more allowed letter. The remaining positions are 2,3,4,5. We have to place S, I, N into three of these, plus one more letter.\n\nGiven the restrictions:\n- S: 3 or 5\n- I: 3 or 5\n- N: 2 or 3\n\nLet me try:\n- Position 2: N\n- Position 3: S\n- Then I must be in 5, and we need a letter for position 4:\n  - O N S _ I → ""ONSET"" – but E is banned.\n  - ""ONSCO"" – but C is allowed, but this is 5 letters: O N S C O – but O is repeated and banned for position 4 (no, O is only banned in positions 2,3,5 for some letters, but O is already in position 1).\n  - Actually, ""ONSET"" is invalid due to E.\n  - ""ONSTI"" – invalid.\n  - ""ONSP I"" – invalid.\n\nThis seems problematic. Maybe I missed a valid word.\n\nWait, let me try ""O N I S T"" – but this would be:\n- O(1) N(2) I(3) S(4) T(5) – but S cannot be in 4 (from SOUND: S(-) means not in 4).\n\nAnother approach: list possible 5-letter words starting with O, containing S, I, N, and no banned letters.\n\nPossible candidates:\n- ""ONION"" – but O is repeated and position 4 is N, which is allowed, but N cannot be in 5 (from SOUND: N(-) in 4, but 5 is allowed). However, this word has O twice, which is possible, but we have no info against it. Let\'s check:\n  - O(1) N(2) I(3) O(4) N(5) – but O is already in position 1, and we don\'t know if O repeats. Also, N in 5 is allowed (from SOUND: N(-) in 4, so 5 is allowed). But we have no confirmation O repeats. This seems risky.\n\n- ""OFTEN"" – but F, T, E, N are allowed, but E is banned.\n\n- ""OVENS"" – but V is allowed, but E is banned.\n\n- ""ONSET"" – E banned.\n\n- ""ONION"" seems the closest, but has O twice. Let me check if it fits all constraints:\n  - O in 1 (✓)\n  - N in 2 (allowed)\n  - I in 3 (allowed)\n  - O in 4 (no restriction, but we don\'t know if O repeats)\n  - N in 5 (allowed)\n\nBut we have no evidence O repeats, and we want to test new letters. Maybe there\'s another word.\n\nWait, let me think of ""OPIUM"" – but P, U, M – U is banned.\n\n""OPENS"" – E banned.\n\n""OLIVE"" – E banned.\n\n""OFTEN"" – E banned.\n\n""OXIDE"" – E banned.\n\n""OZONE"" – Z, O repeats, E banned.\n\n""OPIUM"" – U banned.\n\n""OPALS"" – A banned.\n\n""OPENS"" – E banned.\n\n""OVARY"" – A, R, Y – R banned.\n\n""OVENS"" – E banned.\n\n""OWENS"" – E banned.\n\n""OZONE"" – E banned.\n\n""OPERA"" – A, R, E banned.\n\nThis suggests ""ONION"" might be the only possible word left that fits the constraints, despite the O repetition. Let me verify:\n- O in 1 (✓)\n- N in 2 (allowed)\n- I in 3 (allowed)\n- O in 4 (no restriction)\n- N in 5 (allowed)\n\nAnd it uses only allowed letters (no A, R, E, U, D, H, K).\n\nThus, ""ONION"" seems to be the logical next guess.\n\n<guess>ONION</guess>\n\n<guess>ONION</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(-) U(x) N(-) D(x)\nGuess 3: OSHIN -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) S(-) H(x) I(-) N(-)\nGuess 4: OSKIN -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) S(-) K(-) I(-) N(-)\nGuess 5: ONION -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) N(-) I(-) O(-) N(-)\n'}]","<think>
Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x in any position):
A, R, E, U, D, H, K.

Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:
- O is fixed in position 1 (✓).

Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:
- N must appear somewhere (it has never landed in the correct spot).
- S must appear somewhere.
- I must appear somewhere.

Positions ruled out for these letters so far:
N: cannot be in 2, 4, 5 (from SOUND, ONION)
S: cannot be in 1, 2, 4 (from SOUND, OSHIN, OSKIN)
I: cannot be in 2, 3, 4 (from OSHIN, OSKIN, ONION)

Remaining possible positions for each:
N: only 3 is left (positions 2,4,5 already excluded)
S: only 3 or 5 are left (positions 1,2,4 excluded)
I: only 5 is left (positions 2,3,4 excluded)

So the word structure must be:
O _ _ _ _
with:
- N in position 3
- S in position 3 or 5
- I in position 5

But position 3 can only hold one letter, so N must be in 3, and that forces S to be in 5 and I to be in 5 – which is impossible (both S and I cannot be in 5).

This contradiction means our earlier assumption must be wrong. The only letter left that can fill position 3 is N, which forces S to go to 5 and I to go to 5 – impossible. Therefore, the only resolution is that one of S, I, N must actually be in position 3 and the other two must fit into the remaining spots without conflict.

Re-evaluate:
- N can only be in 3.
- S can be in 3 or 5, but 3 is taken by N, so S must be in 5.
- I must then be in the remaining spot, which is position 2 or 4, but positions 2 and 4 are banned for I (from earlier feedback).

This suggests the only possible arrangement is:
O _ N _ S
with I in position 4 (even though earlier feedback said I cannot be in 4), but looking back:

From ONION feedback: I(-) in position 3 – so I cannot be in 3.
From OSKIN feedback: I(-) in position 4 – so I cannot be in 4.
From OSHIN feedback: I(-) in position 4 – so I cannot be in 4.

Thus, I cannot be in 2,3,4 – only 5 is left, but 5 is taken by S.

This is a contradiction, meaning our interpretation must be missing something. Re-examining the feedback:

From SOUND: N(-) – N is in word but not in 4.
From OSHIN: N(-) – N is in word but not in 5.
From OSKIN: N(-) – N is in word but not in 5.
From ONION: N(-) – N is in word but not in 2.

So N can only be in 3.

Similarly, S:
From AROSE: S(-) – not in 4.
From SOUND: S(-) – not in 1.
From OSHIN: S(-) – not in 2.
From OSKIN: S(-) – not in 2.
Thus S can be in 3 or 5.

I:
From OSHIN: I(-) – not in 4.
From OSKIN: I(-) – not in 4.
From ONION: I(-) – not in 3.
Thus I can only be in 2 or 5.

Given N must be in 3, we have two cases:

Case 1: S in 3 (but 3 is N) – impossible.
Case 2: S in 5.

Then:
O _ N _ S
with I in 2 (only remaining spot for I).

Thus the word must be:
O I N _ S

The missing letter (position 4) must be from allowed letters: B, C, F, G, J, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.
