For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""AROSE,"" ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""ADIEU."" 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify which vowels are in the word
- Two very common consonants (R, S) which appear in many 5-letter words

This should give good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (x)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word contains the letter O but not in position 3.  
We also know it does NOT contain A, R, S, or E.

Since we’ve eliminated several common letters, we want a new guess that:
1. Keeps the O (but moves it to a different slot).
2. Introduces other common letters we haven’t tried yet (e.g., T, N, L, I, C, D, U, etc.).
3. Avoids any of the letters already ruled out.

A good candidate is “POINT”:
- P, I, N, T are new letters.
- O is reused but placed in position 2 instead of 3.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, N, T.
2. Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: O and I.
   - From AROSE: O is in the word but not in position 3.
   - From POINT: O is in the word but not in position 2, and I is in the word but not in position 3.

So the secret word must contain both O and I, and each must appear in one of the remaining positions that have not yet been ruled out.

Positions ruled out so far:
- Position 1: A, R, S, E, P, N, T (and O is not here from AROSE feedback)
- Position 2: O is not here (from POINT feedback)
- Position 3: O and I are not here (from POINT feedback)
- Position 4: No letters ruled out yet.
- Position 5: No letters ruled out yet.

Therefore, O could be in positions 1, 4, or 5.
I could be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We need a word that:
- Uses both O and I.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (so no A, R, S, E, P, N, T).
- Places O and I in positions not yet ruled out.

Possible remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus O and I.

Let’s try to pick a word that uses common remaining letters and places O and I in allowable positions. A good candidate is “COBID” (but that’s not a valid English word). Another is “COBIA” (a type of fish), but A is ruled out. 

A valid word is “COBIA” but it has A. Next, “COBID” is invalid. 

Another candidate: “DOILY” – but Y is allowed, and positions:
- D (pos 1) – allowed
- O (pos 2) – allowed (only O is not allowed in pos 2 from POINT feedback, but O is allowed in pos 2? Wait, POINT feedback said O is in the word but not in position 2. So O cannot be in pos 2. So DOILY is invalid because O is in pos 2.

Next: “VOILA” – but A is ruled out. 

Next: “WIDOW” – but O is in pos 4 and 5, but we only need one O. Also W, I, D are allowed. Let’s check positions:
- W (pos 1) – allowed
- I (pos 2) – allowed (I is not ruled out in pos 2)
- D (pos 3) – allowed (D not ruled out)
- O (pos 4) – allowed
- W (pos 5) – allowed
But we need to have both O and I in the word, and WIDOW has both, but O is in pos 4 (allowed) and I is in pos 2 (allowed). Also, W, D are not ruled out. This seems valid.

But let me think of a simpler word. “WIMBO” – but B is allowed, W, I, M are allowed, O is in pos 5 (allowed). But is WIMBO a valid word? It’s a surname, but may not be in the dictionary.

“COBIA” is invalid (A ruled out). 

“FOILY” – Y is allowed, positions:
- F (pos 1) – allowed
- O (pos 2) – not allowed (O cannot be in pos 2)
Invalid.

“VOILA” – A ruled out.

“DOILY” – O in pos 2, which is not allowed (from POINT feedback: O is not in pos 2).

“COBIA” – invalid.

“LIMBO” – positions:
- L (pos 1) – allowed
- I (pos 2) – allowed
- M (pos 3) – allowed
- B (pos 4) – allowed
- O (pos 5) – allowed
Letters used: L, I, M, B, O – none are ruled out except I and O must be in the word. This seems valid.

LIMBO is a valid English word meaning a state of ignorance or confusion, and it fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is LIMBO.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes:

This should give good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Next: “WIDOW” – but O is in pos 4 and 5, but we only need one O. Also W, I, D are allowed. Let’s check positions:
- W (pos 1) – allowed
- I (pos 2) – allowed (I is not ruled out in pos 2)
- D (pos 3) – allowed (D not ruled out)
- O (pos 4) – allowed
- W (pos 5) – allowed
But we need to have both O and I in the word, and WIDOW has both, but O is in pos 4 (allowed) and I is in pos 2 (allowed). Also, W, D are not ruled out. This seems valid.

But let me think of a simpler word. “WIMBO” – but B is allowed, W, I, M are allowed, O is in pos 5 (allowed). But is WIMBO a valid word? It’s a surname, but may not be in the dictionary.

“COBIA” is invalid (A ruled out). 

“FOILY” – Y is allowed, positions:
- F (pos 1) – allowed
- O (pos 2) – not allowed (O cannot be in pos 2)
Invalid.

“VOILA” – A ruled out.

“DOILY” – O in pos 2, which is not allowed (from POINT feedback: O is not in pos 2).

“COBIA” – invalid.

“LIMBO” – positions:
- L (pos 1) – allowed
- I (pos 2) – allowed
- M (pos 3) – allowed
- B (pos 4) – allowed
- O (pos 5) – allowed
Letters used: L, I, M, B, O – none are ruled out except I and O must be in the word. This seems valid.

LIMBO is a valid English word meaning a state of ignorance or confusion, and it fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is LIMBO.

Let’s consolidate what we now know.

Letters NOT in the word (✗):
A, R, S, E, P, N, T, M, B

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
O, I, L
- From LIMBO: L is in the word but not in position 1; I is in the word but not in position 2; O is in the word but not in position 5.

Positions ruled out so far:
- Position 1: A, R, S, E, P, N, T, M, B, L (L is not here)
- Position 2: O (from POINT), I (from LIMBO), A, R, S, E, P, N, T, M, B
- Position 3: I (from LIMBO), A, R, S, E, P, N, T, M, B
- Position 4: A, R, S, E, P, N, T, M, B
- Position 5: O (from LIMBO), A, R, S, E, P, N, T, M, B

So every position except possibly positions 3 and 4 are now ruled out for several letters. We still need to place O, I, and L somewhere in positions 3 or 4, but we have only two positions left to fill with three required letters. This implies one of the letters must appear twice, or we have miscounted.

Wait: the word is 5 letters, and we have only confirmed two distinct letters (O, I, L) must appear at least once. It’s possible a third letter appears twice. Let’s re-examine the feedback:

- AROSE: O is in word (but not pos 3)
- POINT: O is in word (but not pos 2), I is in word (but not pos 3)
- LIMBO: L is in word (but not pos 1), I is in word (but not pos 2), O is in word (but not pos 5)

Thus the word must contain O, I, L, and two other letters (which must be from remaining allowed letters: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

But we have only two positions left (3 and 4) to place O, I, L plus any duplicates. This seems impossible unless one letter appears twice. Let’s list remaining letters that have not been ruled out:
C, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains O, I, L (each in allowed positions)
- Uses only letters from the remaining set
- Has O not in pos 2,3,5
- Has I not in pos 2,3
- Has L not in pos 1

Possible positions for each:
O: can be in pos 1, 4
I: can be in pos 1, 4, 5
L: can be in pos 2, 3, 4, 5

Let’s try to construct a word:
- O must be in pos 1 or 4
- I must be in pos 1,4,5
- L must be in pos 2,3,4,5

Case 1: O in pos 1
Then word is O _ _ _ _
I must be in pos 4 or 5
L must be in pos 2,3,4,5 but not pos 1 (already O)

Subcase 1a: I in pos 4
Then word is O _ _ I _
L must be in pos 2,3,5
Possible: O L _ I _ or O _ L I _
But pos 3 and 5 need to be filled with remaining letters.

Example: O L C I D – but D is allowed, C is allowed. Check positions:
- O in pos 1 (allowed)
- L in pos 2 (allowed)
- C in pos 3 (allowed)
- I in pos 4 (allowed)
- D in pos 5 (allowed)
This forms the word OLICD, but that’s not a valid English word.

Another: O L D I C – OLDIC? Not valid.

Subcase 1b: I in pos 5
Then word is O _ _ _ I
L must be in pos 2,3,4
Example: O C L D I – OCLDI? Not valid.

Case 2: O in pos 4
Then word is _ _ _ O _
I must be in pos 1,5
L must be in pos 2,3,5

Subcase 2a: I in pos 1
Then word is I _ _ O _
L must be in pos 2,3,5
Example: I L C O D – ILCOD? Not valid.

Subcase 2b: I in pos 5
Then word is _ _ _ O I
L must be in pos 2,3
Example: C L U O I –CLUOI? Not valid.

We need a valid English word. Let’s think differently: perhaps a letter repeats. For example, ""O"" could appear twice.

Consider the word ""COYLI"" – but Y is allowed, positions:
C (pos 1) – allowed
O (pos 2) – not allowed (O cannot be in pos 2)
Invalid.

""DOILY"" – O in pos 2, invalid.

""FOILY"" – same issue.

""VOILA"" – A ruled out.

""WIDOW"" – O appears twice, positions:
W (pos 1) – allowed
I (pos 2) – allowed
D (pos 3) – allowed
O (pos 4) – allowed
W (pos 5) – allowed
But we already considered WIDOW earlier, and it fits all constraints:
- Contains O, I, W (W is allowed)
- O is in pos 4 (allowed)
- I is in pos 2 (allowed)
- W is in pos 1 and 5 (allowed)
- No ruled-out letters

Thus WIDOW seems valid. Let’s verify:
- Letters: W, I, D, O, W
- Contains O, I (both confirmed in word)
- W is allowed (not ruled out)
- D is allowed (not ruled out)
- Positions:
  - W in pos 1: allowed (not ruled out for W)
  - I in pos 2: allowed (only O is ruled out for pos 2)
  - D in pos 3: allowed
  - O in pos 4: allowed
  - W in pos 5: allowed
This satisfies all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is WIDOW.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""AROSE,"" ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""ADIEU."" 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify which vowels are in the word
- Two very common consonants (R, S) which appear in many 5-letter words

This should give good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (x)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word contains the letter O but not in position 3.  
We also know it does NOT contain A, R, S, or E.

Since we’ve eliminated several common letters, we want a new guess that:
1. Keeps the O (but moves it to a different slot).
2. Introduces other common letters we haven’t tried yet (e.g., T, N, L, I, C, D, U, etc.).
3. Avoids any of the letters already ruled out.

A good candidate is “POINT”:
- P, I, N, T are new letters.
- O is reused but placed in position 2 instead of 3.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, N, T.
2. Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: O and I.
   - From AROSE: O is in the word but not in position 3.
   - From POINT: O is in the word but not in position 2, and I is in the word but not in position 3.

So the secret word must contain both O and I, and each must appear in one of the remaining positions that have not yet been ruled out.

Positions ruled out so far:
- Position 1: A, R, S, E, P, N, T (and O is not here from AROSE feedback)
- Position 2: O is not here (from POINT feedback)
- Position 3: O and I are not here (from POINT feedback)
- Position 4: No letters ruled out yet.
- Position 5: No letters ruled out yet.

Therefore, O could be in positions 1, 4, or 5.
I could be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We need a word that:
- Uses both O and I.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (so no A, R, S, E, P, N, T).
- Places O and I in positions not yet ruled out.

Possible remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus O and I.

Let’s try to pick a word that uses common remaining letters and places O and I in allowable positions. A good candidate is “COBID” (but that’s not a valid English word). Another is “COBIA” (a type of fish), but A is ruled out. 

A valid word is “COBIA” but it has A. Next, “COBID” is invalid. 

Another candidate: “DOILY” – but Y is allowed, and positions:
- D (pos 1) – allowed
- O (pos 2) – allowed (only O is not allowed in pos 2 from POINT feedback, but O is allowed in pos 2? Wait, POINT feedback said O is in the word but not in position 2. So O cannot be in pos 2. So DOILY is invalid because O is in pos 2.

Next: “VOILA” – but A is ruled out. 

Next: “WIDOW” – but O is in pos 4 and 5, but we only need one O. Also W, I, D are allowed. Let’s check positions:
- W (pos 1) – allowed
- I (pos 2) – allowed (I is not ruled out in pos 2)
- D (pos 3) – allowed (D not ruled out)
- O (pos 4) – allowed
- W (pos 5) – allowed
But we need to have both O and I in the word, and WIDOW has both, but O is in pos 4 (allowed) and I is in pos 2 (allowed). Also, W, D are not ruled out. This seems valid.

But let me think of a simpler word. “WIMBO” – but B is allowed, W, I, M are allowed, O is in pos 5 (allowed). But is WIMBO a valid word? It’s a surname, but may not be in the dictionary.

“COBIA” is invalid (A ruled out). 

“FOILY” – Y is allowed, positions:
- F (pos 1) – allowed
- O (pos 2) – not allowed (O cannot be in pos 2)
Invalid.

“VOILA” – A ruled out.

“DOILY” – O in pos 2, which is not allowed (from POINT feedback: O is not in pos 2).

“COBIA” – invalid.

“LIMBO” – positions:
- L (pos 1) – allowed
- I (pos 2) – allowed
- M (pos 3) – allowed
- B (pos 4) – allowed
- O (pos 5) – allowed
Letters used: L, I, M, B, O – none are ruled out except I and O must be in the word. This seems valid.

LIMBO is a valid English word meaning a state of ignorance or confusion, and it fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is LIMBO.

Let’s consolidate what we now know.

Letters NOT in the word (✗):
A, R, S, E, P, N, T, M, B

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
O, I, L
- From LIMBO: L is in the word but not in position 1; I is in the word but not in position 2; O is in the word but not in position 5.

Positions ruled out so far:
- Position 1: A, R, S, E, P, N, T, M, B, L (L is not here)
- Position 2: O (from POINT), I (from LIMBO), A, R, S, E, P, N, T, M, B
- Position 3: I (from LIMBO), A, R, S, E, P, N, T, M, B
- Position 4: A, R, S, E, P, N, T, M, B
- Position 5: O (from LIMBO), A, R, S, E, P, N, T, M, B

So every position except possibly positions 3 and 4 are now ruled out for several letters. We still need to place O, I, and L somewhere in positions 3 or 4, but we have only two positions left to fill with three required letters. This implies one of the letters must appear twice, or we have miscounted.

Wait: the word is 5 letters, and we have only confirmed two distinct letters (O, I, L) must appear at least once. It’s possible a third letter appears twice. Let’s re-examine the feedback:

- AROSE: O is in word (but not pos 3)
- POINT: O is in word (but not pos 2), I is in word (but not pos 3)
- LIMBO: L is in word (but not pos 1), I is in word (but not pos 2), O is in word (but not pos 5)

Thus the word must contain O, I, L, and two other letters (which must be from remaining allowed letters: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

But we have only two positions left (3 and 4) to place O, I, L plus any duplicates. This seems impossible unless one letter appears twice. Let’s list remaining letters that have not been ruled out:
C, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains O, I, L (each in allowed positions)
- Uses only letters from the remaining set
- Has O not in pos 2,3,5
- Has I not in pos 2,3
- Has L not in pos 1

Possible positions for each:
O: can be in pos 1, 4
I: can be in pos 1, 4, 5
L: can be in pos 2, 3, 4, 5

Let’s try to construct a word:
- O must be in pos 1 or 4
- I must be in pos 1,4,5
- L must be in pos 2,3,4,5

Case 1: O in pos 1
Then word is O _ _ _ _
I must be in pos 4 or 5
L must be in pos 2,3,4,5 but not pos 1 (already O)

Subcase 1a: I in pos 4
Then word is O _ _ I _
L must be in pos 2,3,5
Possible: O L _ I _ or O _ L I _
But pos 3 and 5 need to be filled with remaining letters.

Example: O L C I D – but D is allowed, C is allowed. Check positions:
- O in pos 1 (allowed)
- L in pos 2 (allowed)
- C in pos 3 (allowed)
- I in pos 4 (allowed)
- D in pos 5 (allowed)
This forms the word OLICD, but that’s not a valid English word.

Another: O L D I C – OLDIC? Not valid.

Subcase 1b: I in pos 5
Then word is O _ _ _ I
L must be in pos 2,3,4
Example: O C L D I – OCLDI? Not valid.

Case 2: O in pos 4
Then word is _ _ _ O _
I must be in pos 1,5
L must be in pos 2,3,5

Subcase 2a: I in pos 1
Then word is I _ _ O _
L must be in pos 2,3,5
Example: I L C O D – ILCOD? Not valid.

Subcase 2b: I in pos 5
Then word is _ _ _ O I
L must be in pos 2,3
Example: C L U O I –CLUOI? Not valid.

We need a valid English word. Let’s think differently: perhaps a letter repeats. For example, ""O"" could appear twice.

Consider the word ""COYLI"" – but Y is allowed, positions:
C (pos 1) – allowed
O (pos 2) – not allowed (O cannot be in pos 2)
Invalid.

""DOILY"" – O in pos 2, invalid.

""FOILY"" – same issue.

""VOILA"" – A ruled out.

""WIDOW"" – O appears twice, positions:
W (pos 1) – allowed
I (pos 2) – allowed
D (pos 3) – allowed
O (pos 4) – allowed
W (pos 5) – allowed
But we already considered WIDOW earlier, and it fits all constraints:
- Contains O, I, W (W is allowed)
- O is in pos 4 (allowed)
- I is in pos 2 (allowed)
- W is in pos 1 and 5 (allowed)
- No ruled-out letters

Thus WIDOW seems valid. Let’s verify:
- Letters: W, I, D, O, W
- Contains O, I (both confirmed in word)
- W is allowed (not ruled out)
- D is allowed (not ruled out)
- Positions:
  - W in pos 1: allowed (not ruled out for W)
  - I in pos 2: allowed (only O is ruled out for pos 2)
  - D in pos 3: allowed
  - O in pos 4: allowed
  - W in pos 5: allowed
This satisfies all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is WIDOW.

Let’s summarize what we now know.

Letters that are NOT in the word (✗):
A, R, S, E, P, N, T, M, B, W, D

Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:
O, I, L

Additional positional constraints:
- O is in the word, but it is NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (from POINT, LIMBO, WIDOW feedback).
  → The only remaining spot for O is position 1.
- I is in the word, but it is NOT in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from LIMBO, WIDOW feedback).
  → I must be in position 4.
- L is in the word, but it is NOT in position 1 (from LIMBO feedback).
  → L can be in positions 2, 3, or 5.

So the word structure is now:
O _ _ I _

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):
C, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

We need to fill positions 2, 3, and 5 with these allowed letters, ensuring L appears exactly once in positions 2, 3, or 5.

Possible permutations:
- Position 2: L → L _ _ I _
- Position 3: L → _ L _ I _
- Position 5: L → _ _ _ I L

Let’s generate valid English words for each case.

Case 1: L in position 2 → O L _ I _
Need a valid 5-letter word starting with OL and ending with I _.
Possible: OLIVE – but E is ruled out.
OLOGY – but G is allowed, Y is allowed. ""OLOGY"" is a valid word (a suffix in sciences).
Check letters: O, L, O, G, Y
- O is allowed in pos 1 (✓)
- L is allowed in pos 2 (✓)
- G, Y are allowed
- Second O is allowed (no restriction on duplicates)

Case 2: L in position 3 → O _ L I _
Need a word like O _ L I _. Possible: OLIVE – E ruled out.
OLOGY already considered. ""OXILI"" – not a word.
""OZONI"" – not valid.

Case 3: L in position 5 → O _ _ I L
Possible: OXILI – not valid.
""OZYLI"" – not valid.

The most promising valid word from above is OLOGY (O-L-O-G-Y). Let’s verify:
- Contains O, L, I (all confirmed required)
- O in pos 1 (required)
- I in pos 4 (required)
- L in pos 2 (required)
- G and Y are allowed letters
- No ruled-out letters used

Therefore, OLOGY is a valid next guess.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""AROSE,"" ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""ADIEU."" 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify which vowels are in the word
- Two very common consonants (R, S) which appear in many 5-letter words

This should give good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (x)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word contains the letter O but not in position 3.  
We also know it does NOT contain A, R, S, or E.

Since we’ve eliminated several common letters, we want a new guess that:
1. Keeps the O (but moves it to a different slot).
2. Introduces other common letters we haven’t tried yet (e.g., T, N, L, I, C, D, U, etc.).
3. Avoids any of the letters already ruled out.

A good candidate is “POINT”:
- P, I, N, T are new letters.
- O is reused but placed in position 2 instead of 3.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, N, T.
2. Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: O and I.
   - From AROSE: O is in the word but not in position 3.
   - From POINT: O is in the word but not in position 2, and I is in the word but not in position 3.

So the secret word must contain both O and I, and each must appear in one of the remaining positions that have not yet been ruled out.

Positions ruled out so far:
- Position 1: A, R, S, E, P, N, T (and O is not here from AROSE feedback)
- Position 2: O is not here (from POINT feedback)
- Position 3: O and I are not here (from POINT feedback)
- Position 4: No letters ruled out yet.
- Position 5: No letters ruled out yet.

Therefore, O could be in positions 1, 4, or 5.
I could be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We need a word that:
- Uses both O and I.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (so no A, R, S, E, P, N, T).
- Places O and I in positions not yet ruled out.

Possible remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus O and I.

Let’s try to pick a word that uses common remaining letters and places O and I in allowable positions. A good candidate is “COBID” (but that’s not a valid English word). Another is “COBIA” (a type of fish), but A is ruled out. 

A valid word is “COBIA” but it has A. Next, “COBID” is invalid. 

Another candidate: “DOILY” – but Y is allowed, and positions:
- D (pos 1) – allowed
- O (pos 2) – allowed (only O is not allowed in pos 2 from POINT feedback, but O is allowed in pos 2? Wait, POINT feedback said O is in the word but not in position 2. So O cannot be in pos 2. So DOILY is invalid because O is in pos 2.

Next: “VOILA” – but A is ruled out. 

Next: “WIDOW” – but O is in pos 4 and 5, but we only need one O. Also W, I, D are allowed. Let’s check positions:
- W (pos 1) – allowed
- I (pos 2) – allowed (I is not ruled out in pos 2)
- D (pos 3) – allowed (D not ruled out)
- O (pos 4) – allowed
- W (pos 5) – allowed
But we need to have both O and I in the word, and WIDOW has both, but O is in pos 4 (allowed) and I is in pos 2 (allowed). Also, W, D are not ruled out. This seems valid.

But let me think of a simpler word. “WIMBO” – but B is allowed, W, I, M are allowed, O is in pos 5 (allowed). But is WIMBO a valid word? It’s a surname, but may not be in the dictionary.

“COBIA” is invalid (A ruled out). 

“FOILY” – Y is allowed, positions:
- F (pos 1) – allowed
- O (pos 2) – not allowed (O cannot be in pos 2)
Invalid.

“VOILA” – A ruled out.

“DOILY” – O in pos 2, which is not allowed (from POINT feedback: O is not in pos 2).

“COBIA” – invalid.

“LIMBO” – positions:
- L (pos 1) – allowed
- I (pos 2) – allowed
- M (pos 3) – allowed
- B (pos 4) – allowed
- O (pos 5) – allowed
Letters used: L, I, M, B, O – none are ruled out except I and O must be in the word. This seems valid.

LIMBO is a valid English word meaning a state of ignorance or confusion, and it fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is LIMBO.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s consolidate what we now know.

Letters NOT in the word (✗):
A, R, S, E, P, N, T, M, B

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
O, I, L
- From LIMBO: L is in the word but not in position 1; I is in the word but not in position 2; O is in the word but not in position 5.

Positions ruled out so far:
- Position 1: A, R, S, E, P, N, T, M, B, L (L is not here)
- Position 2: O (from POINT), I (from LIMBO), A, R, S, E, P, N, T, M, B
- Position 3: I (from LIMBO), A, R, S, E, P, N, T, M, B
- Position 4: A, R, S, E, P, N, T, M, B
- Position 5: O (from LIMBO), A, R, S, E, P, N, T, M, B

So every position except possibly positions 3 and 4 are now ruled out for several letters. We still need to place O, I, and L somewhere in positions 3 or 4, but we have only two positions left to fill with three required letters. This implies one of the letters must appear twice, or we have miscounted.

Wait: the word is 5 letters, and we have only confirmed two distinct letters (O, I, L) must appear at least once. It’s possible a third letter appears twice. Let’s re-examine the feedback:

- AROSE: O is in word (but not pos 3)
- POINT: O is in word (but not pos 2), I is in word (but not pos 3)
- LIMBO: L is in word (but not pos 1), I is in word (but not pos 2), O is in word (but not pos 5)

Thus the word must contain O, I, L, and two other letters (which must be from remaining allowed letters: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

But we have only two positions left (3 and 4) to place O, I, L plus any duplicates. This seems impossible unless one letter appears twice. Let’s list remaining letters that have not been ruled out:
C, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains O, I, L (each in allowed positions)
- Uses only letters from the remaining set
- Has O not in pos 2,3,5
- Has I not in pos 2,3
- Has L not in pos 1

Possible positions for each:
O: can be in pos 1, 4
I: can be in pos 1, 4, 5
L: can be in pos 2, 3, 4, 5

Let’s try to construct a word:
- O must be in pos 1 or 4
- I must be in pos 1,4,5
- L must be in pos 2,3,4,5

Case 1: O in pos 1
Then word is O _ _ _ _
I must be in pos 4 or 5
L must be in pos 2,3,4,5 but not pos 1 (already O)

Subcase 1a: I in pos 4
Then word is O _ _ I _
L must be in pos 2,3,5
Possible: O L _ I _ or O _ L I _
But pos 3 and 5 need to be filled with remaining letters.

Example: O L C I D – but D is allowed, C is allowed. Check positions:
- O in pos 1 (allowed)
- L in pos 2 (allowed)
- C in pos 3 (allowed)
- I in pos 4 (allowed)
- D in pos 5 (allowed)
This forms the word OLICD, but that’s not a valid English word.

Another: O L D I C – OLDIC? Not valid.

Subcase 1b: I in pos 5
Then word is O _ _ _ I
L must be in pos 2,3,4
Example: O C L D I – OCLDI? Not valid.

Case 2: O in pos 4
Then word is _ _ _ O _
I must be in pos 1,5
L must be in pos 2,3,5

Subcase 2a: I in pos 1
Then word is I _ _ O _
L must be in pos 2,3,5
Example: I L C O D – ILCOD? Not valid.

Subcase 2b: I in pos 5
Then word is _ _ _ O I
L must be in pos 2,3
Example: C L U O I –CLUOI? Not valid.

We need a valid English word. Let’s think differently: perhaps a letter repeats. For example, ""O"" could appear twice.

Consider the word ""COYLI"" – but Y is allowed, positions:
C (pos 1) – allowed
O (pos 2) – not allowed (O cannot be in pos 2)
Invalid.

""DOILY"" – O in pos 2, invalid.

""FOILY"" – same issue.

""VOILA"" – A ruled out.

""WIDOW"" – O appears twice, positions:
W (pos 1) – allowed
I (pos 2) – allowed
D (pos 3) – allowed
O (pos 4) – allowed
W (pos 5) – allowed
But we already considered WIDOW earlier, and it fits all constraints:
- Contains O, I, W (W is allowed)
- O is in pos 4 (allowed)
- I is in pos 2 (allowed)
- W is in pos 1 and 5 (allowed)
- No ruled-out letters

Thus WIDOW seems valid. Let’s verify:
- Letters: W, I, D, O, W
- Contains O, I (both confirmed in word)
- W is allowed (not ruled out)
- D is allowed (not ruled out)
- Positions:
  - W in pos 1: allowed (not ruled out for W)
  - I in pos 2: allowed (only O is ruled out for pos 2)
  - D in pos 3: allowed
  - O in pos 4: allowed
  - W in pos 5: allowed
This satisfies all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is WIDOW.

Let’s summarize what we now know.

Letters that are NOT in the word (✗):
A, R, S, E, P, N, T, M, B, W, D

Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:
O, I, L

Additional positional constraints:
- O is in the word, but it is NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (from POINT, LIMBO, WIDOW feedback).
  → The only remaining spot for O is position 1.
- I is in the word, but it is NOT in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from LIMBO, WIDOW feedback).
  → I must be in position 4.
- L is in the word, but it is NOT in position 1 (from LIMBO feedback).
  → L can be in positions 2, 3, or 5.

So the word structure is now:
O _ _ I _

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):
C, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

We need to fill positions 2, 3, and 5 with these allowed letters, ensuring L appears exactly once in positions 2, 3, or 5.

Possible permutations:
- Position 2: L → L _ _ I _
- Position 3: L → _ L _ I _
- Position 5: L → _ _ _ I L

Let’s generate valid English words for each case.

Case 1: L in position 2 → O L _ I _
Need a valid 5-letter word starting with OL and ending with I _.
Possible: OLIVE – but E is ruled out.
OLOGY – but G is allowed, Y is allowed. ""OLOGY"" is a valid word (a suffix in sciences).
Check letters: O, L, O, G, Y
- O is allowed in pos 1 (✓)
- L is allowed in pos 2 (✓)
- G, Y are allowed
- Second O is allowed (no restriction on duplicates)

Case 2: L in position 3 → O _ L I _
Need a word like O _ L I _. Possible: OLIVE – E ruled out.
OLOGY already considered. ""OXILI"" – not a word.
""OZONI"" – not valid.

Case 3: L in position 5 → O _ _ I L
Possible: OXILI – not valid.
""OZYLI"" – not valid.

The most promising valid word from above is OLOGY (O-L-O-G-Y). Let’s verify:
- Contains O, L, I (all confirmed required)
- O in pos 1 (required)
- I in pos 4 (required)
- L in pos 2 (required)
- G and Y are allowed letters
- No ruled-out letters used

Therefore, OLOGY is a valid next guess.

From the latest feedback:

- O(-) L(-) O(✓) G(x) Y(x)

Interpretation:
- First O is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- Second O is in position 3 and is CORRECT.
- L is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- G and Y are NOT in the word.

So far we know:

Letters that are NOT in the word (✗):
A, R, S, E, P, N, T, M, B, W, D, G, Y

Letters that ARE in the word:
- O (must be in position 3)
- I (must appear somewhere)
- L (must appear somewhere)

Position constraints:
- O is fixed at position 3: _ _ O _ _
- I is not in positions 2, 3, 5 (from earlier feedback)
  → I must be in position 1 or 4
- L is not in position 1 or 2 (from earlier feedback)
  → L must be in position 4 or 5

But position 4 can only have one letter, so we need to consider two cases:

Case 1: I in position 1 and L in position 5
Word structure: I _ O _ L

Case 2: I in position 4 and L in position 5
Word structure: _ _ O I L

We also know the remaining letters must come from the allowed set:
C, F, H, J, K, Q, U, V, X, Z

Let’s check each case for valid English words.

Case 1: I _ O _ L
Possible: I C O K L – not a word
I C O F L – not a word
I C O V L – not a word
I C O U L – not a word
No valid words found.

Case 2: _ _ O I L
Possible: C H O I L – ""CHOIL"" is archaic but valid (a narrow channel)
C L O I L – ""CLOIL"" is not a word
F U O I L – not a word
H O I L – too short
V O I L – too short
Only ""CHOIL"" seems plausible, though rare.

However, let’s double-check the allowed letters and constraints:
- Position 1 and 2 must be from C, F, H, J, K, Q, U, V, X, Z
- Position 4 is I (✓)
- Position 5 is L (✓)
- Position 3 is O (✓)

""CHOIL"" fits:
C (pos 1) – allowed
H (pos 2) – allowed
O (pos 3) – correct
I (pos 4) – correct
L (pos 5) – correct

Thus, ""CHOIL"" is the only valid word fitting all constraints.
