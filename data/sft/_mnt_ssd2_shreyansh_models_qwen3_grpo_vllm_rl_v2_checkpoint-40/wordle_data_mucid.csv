For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it has common letters and good letter distribution. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better vowel coverage.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means we now know the word contains none of those five letters.

To maximize information from the second guess, I want a word that:
- uses entirely different letters from AROSE,
- still includes common vowels and consonants to test new ones,
- avoids repeating any of the already-eliminated letters.

Good remaining common letters include: T, N, I, L, U, D, C, M, P, Y, etc.

A balanced choice is “UNITY”:
- U, N, I, T, Y – none of these appeared in AROSE.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters that are **not** in the word at all: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, Y  
- Letters that **are** in the word but in the wrong positions:  
  – U (was in position 1)  
  – I (was in position 3)

So the secret word:
- contains U and I  
- does **not** contain A, R, O, S, E, N, T, Y  
- U is **not** in position 1, and I is **not** in position 3

Remaining common letters to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, etc.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses U and I  
2. Places U somewhere other than position 1  
3. Places I somewhere other than position 3  
4. Uses only letters from the still-allowed set (no A, R, O, S, E, N, T, Y)

A quick scan:  
- “BUILD” – but D is allowed and we haven’t tested it yet, but L and D are still possible. However, it has L and D, but we need to test more letters.  
- “QUIET” – contains Q, which is rare and we haven’t tested it yet, but Q is allowed. However, it has Q and T, and T is already eliminated.  
- “CUBIC” – has C, U, B, I, C. But C is allowed, B is allowed, but we have two C’s and we don’t know about C yet.  
- “DUKIL” – but “DUKIL” isn’t a valid English word.  
- “FUMIC” – not a valid word.  
- “LUMPY” – has M, P, Y, but Y is eliminated.  
- “MUCKY” – Y is eliminated.  
- “PICKY” – Y is eliminated.  
- “PIKUL” – not a valid word.  
- “QUICK” – Q and U, but T is eliminated.  
- “WICKY” – Y is eliminated.  
- “CUBIT” – T is eliminated.  
- “BUILT” – T is eliminated.  
- “BUILD” – L and D are still allowed, but we haven’t tested them yet.  

Wait, let’s list allowed letters:  
Allowed letters so far (excluding the 8 eliminated ones):  
B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We know the word must contain U and I, and must not have U in position 1 or I in position 3.

Let’s try “BUILD”:
- B, U, I, L, D – all allowed letters.  
- U is in position 2 (allowed, since U can’t be in 1).  
- I is in position 3 – but feedback said I is in the word but **not** in position 3. So “BUILD” is invalid because it puts I in position 3.

Next try “CUBIC”:
- C, U, B, I, C – I is in position 4 (allowed), U is in position 2 (allowed). This seems valid.

But we can do better by testing more new consonants. Let’s try “LUMPY” – but Y is eliminated.  
Try “MUCKY” – Y is eliminated.  
Try “PIKUL” – not a valid word.  
Try “FUMIC” – not a valid word.  
Try “QUICK” – T is eliminated.  
Try “CUBIC” – valid word, uses C, U, B, I, C.

But let’s try a word that uses more new consonants. How about “DUKIL” – invalid.  
“FUCKY” – Y eliminated.  
“LUMPY” – Y eliminated.  
“MUCKY” – Y eliminated.  
“PIKUL” – invalid.  
“QUICK” – T eliminated.  

Another approach: use U and I in different positions, and test new consonants. Let’s try “LUMPY” – no.  
Try “MULCH”:
- M, U, L, C, H – all allowed letters.  
- U is in position 2 (allowed).  
- I is missing – we must include I.  

So we need a word with both U and I. Let’s try “CUPID”:
- C, U, P, I, D – all allowed letters.  
- U is in position 2 (allowed).  
- I is in position 4 (allowed).  
- Tests new letters C, P, D.

This seems like a good choice.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it has common letters and good letter distribution. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better vowel coverage.

Remaining common letters to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, etc.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses U and I  
2. Places U somewhere other than position 1  
3. Places I somewhere other than position 3  
4. Uses only letters from the still-allowed set (no A, R, O, S, E, N, T, Y)

A quick scan:  
- “BUILD” – but D is allowed and we haven’t tested it yet, but L and D are still possible. However, it has L and D, but we need to test more letters.  
- “QUIET” – contains Q, which is rare and we haven’t tested it yet, but Q is allowed. However, it has Q and T, and T is already eliminated.  
- “CUBIC” – has C, U, B, I, C. But C is allowed, B is allowed, but we have two C’s and we don’t know about C yet.  
- “DUKIL” – but “DUKIL” isn’t a valid English word.  
- “FUMIC” – not a valid word.  
- “LUMPY” – has M, P, Y, but Y is eliminated.  
- “MUCKY” – Y is eliminated.  
- “PICKY” – Y is eliminated.  
- “PIKUL” – not a valid word.  
- “QUICK” – Q and U, but T is eliminated.  
- “WICKY” – Y is eliminated.  
- “CUBIT” – T is eliminated.  
- “BUILT” – T is eliminated.  
- “BUILD” – L and D are still allowed, but we haven’t tested them yet.  

Wait, let’s list allowed letters:  
Allowed letters so far (excluding the 8 eliminated ones):  
B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We know the word must contain U and I, and must not have U in position 1 or I in position 3.

Let’s try “BUILD”:
- B, U, I, L, D – all allowed letters.  
- U is in position 2 (allowed, since U can’t be in 1).  
- I is in position 3 – but feedback said I is in the word but **not** in position 3. So “BUILD” is invalid because it puts I in position 3.

Next try “CUBIC”:
- C, U, B, I, C – I is in position 4 (allowed), U is in position 2 (allowed). This seems valid.

But we can do better by testing more new consonants. Let’s try “LUMPY” – but Y is eliminated.  
Try “MUCKY” – Y is eliminated.  
Try “PIKUL” – not a valid word.  
Try “FUMIC” – not a valid word.  
Try “QUICK” – T is eliminated.  
Try “CUBIC” – valid word, uses C, U, B, I, C.

But let’s try a word that uses more new consonants. How about “DUKIL” – invalid.  
“FUCKY” – Y eliminated.  
“LUMPY” – Y eliminated.  
“MUCKY” – Y eliminated.  
“PIKUL” – invalid.  
“QUICK” – T eliminated.  

Another approach: use U and I in different positions, and test new consonants. Let’s try “LUMPY” – no.  
Try “MULCH”:
- M, U, L, C, H – all allowed letters.  
- U is in position 2 (allowed).  
- I is missing – we must include I.  

So we need a word with both U and I. Let’s try “CUPID”:
- C, U, P, I, D – all allowed letters.  
- U is in position 2 (allowed).  
- I is in position 4 (allowed).  
- Tests new letters C, P, D.

This seems like a good choice.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means we now know the word contains none of those five letters.

To maximize information from the second guess, I want a word that:
- uses entirely different letters from AROSE,
- still includes common vowels and consonants to test new ones,
- avoids repeating any of the already-eliminated letters.

Good remaining common letters include: T, N, I, L, U, D, C, M, P, Y, etc.

A balanced choice is “UNITY”:
- U, N, I, T, Y – none of these appeared in AROSE.
- It covers two new vowels (U, I) and three common consonants (N, T, Y).

This should help narrow down the remaining possibilities efficiently.

- Letters that **are** in the word but in the wrong positions:  
  – U (was in position 1)

However, I\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better vowel coverage.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  \nThat means we now know the word contains none of those five letters.\n\nTo maximize information from the second guess, I want a word that:\n- uses entirely different letters from AROSE,\n- still includes common vowels and consonants to test new ones,\n- avoids repeating any of the already-eliminated letters.\n\nGood remaining common letters include: T, N, I, L, U, D, C, M, P, Y, etc.\n\nA balanced choice is “UNITY”:\n- U, N, I, T, Y – none of these appeared in AROSE.\n- It covers two new vowels (U, I) and three common consonants (N, T, Y).\n\nThis should help narrow down the remaining possibilities efficiently.\n\n<guess>UNITY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: UNITY -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(x) I(-) T(x) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback so far:\n\n- Letters that are **not** in the word at all: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, Y  \n- Letters that **are** in the word but in the wrong positions:  \n  – U (was in position 1)  \n  – I (was in position 3)\n\nSo the secret word:\n- contains U and I  \n- does **not** contain A, R, O, S, E, N, T, Y  \n- U is **not** in position 1, and I is **not** in position 3\n\nRemaining common letters to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, etc.\n\nI need a 5-letter word that:\n1.

This seems valid.\n\nBut we can do better by testing more new consonants.

4. Additional info:
   – From Guess 3 (CUPID) we had M(-) in Guess 4 (HUMID).  
     That means M is in the word but NOT in position 3.

Therefore:
- Position 1 must be one of the allowed letters.
- Position 3 must be one of the allowed letters, but NOT M (since M is in the word but not in position 3).

So possible letters for position 3: B, C, F, G, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a valid English word of the form ? U ? I D.

Let’s list possibilities:

- B U ? I D → BULKID (invalid), BURID (invalid), BUTID (invalid)

- V U ? I D → VULID (invalid)  
- W U ? I D → WULID (invalid)  
- X U ? I D → XULID (invalid)  
- Z U ? I D → ZULID (invalid)

Valid words: JUMID, LUMPID

Between these, JUMID is a valid word and uses J (allowed) and M (allowed, and M is in the word but not in position 3 – in JUMID, M is in position 3, but we know M is not allowed in position 3 from HUMID feedback. Wait, this is a problem.

Wait, in JUMID, M is in position 3, but from HUMID feedback, M is in the word but NOT in position 3. Therefore JUMID is invalid because it puts M in position 3.

Only remaining valid word is LUMPID:
- LUMPID: L, U, M, P, I, D – but P is already eliminated.

Wait, let me re-examine:

From Guess 3 (CUPID): C(-) U(✓) P(x) I(✓) D(✓) → P is not in the word.

From Guess 4 (HUMID): H(x) U(✓) M(-) I(✓) D(✓) → M is in the word but not in position 3.

So in the pattern _ U _ I D, position 3 cannot be M.

Valid words:
- LUMPID: L, U, M, P, I, D – but P is eliminated, so invalid.
- JUMID: J, U, M, I, D – P is not in this word, and M is in position 3, but we know M is not allowed in position 3. So invalid.

Wait, this suggests no valid words, but that can't be right.

Let me re-examine possible letters:

Allowed letters for positions 1 and 3: B, C, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z

And position 3 cannot be M.

So possible combinations:

Position 1: B, C, F, G, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z  
Position 3: same list excluding M

Looking for valid English words:

- BULKID – invalid  
- CURLID – invalid  
- FUMID – invalid  
- GULID – invalid  
- JUMID – invalid (M in position 3)  
- KUMID – invalid  
- LUMPID – invalid (P is eliminated)  
- MULID – invalid (M in position 3)  
- VULID – invalid  
- WULID – invalid  
- XULID – invalid  
- ZULID – invalid  

This seems problematic. Did I miss any valid words?

Wait, let me think differently. The word must be _ U _ I D, with letters from allowed set.

Looking at the pattern, possible valid words:

- BULKID – invalid  
- CURLID – invalid  
- FUMID – invalid  
- GULID – invalid  
- JUMID – invalid (M in position 3)  
- LUMPID – invalid (P is eliminated)  
- MULID – invalid (M in position 3)  
- VULID – invalid  
- WULID – invalid  
- XULID – invalid  
- ZULID – invalid  

This suggests the only possible word is ""JUMID"" but M cannot be in position 3. This implies I might have missed a word or made an error.

Wait, let me check ""FUMID"" – F, U, M, I, D – but M is in position 3, which is invalid.

Looking back at the allowed letters, is there another word?

Ah! ""CUBID"" – but P is eliminated, but CUBID is valid? Let me check:

CUBID: C, U, B, I, D – but this would be _ U B I D, so positions 1,2,3,4,5: C, U, B, I, D.

This fits:
- Position 1: C (allowed)  
- Position 2: U (correct)  
- Position 3: B (allowed)  
- Position 4: I (correct)  
- Position 5: D (correct)  

And C is allowed (not eliminated), B is allowed, and M is not required here.

So ""CUBID"" seems valid.

But wait, from Guess 3 (CUPID) we had C(-) – meaning C is in the word but not in position 1. So C cannot be in position 1 in our next guess.

Therefore CUBID is invalid because it puts C in position 1.

This is tricky. Let me re-examine:

From Guess 3 (CUPID): C(-) – C is in the word but not in position 1.  
From Guess 4 (HUMID): M(-) – M is in the word but not in position 3.

So the word must contain both C and M, with:
- C not in position 1  
- M not in position 3  

And the pattern is _ U _ I D.

So positions:
1: not C, not M  
2: U  
3: not M  
4: I  
5: D  

And the remaining letters must be from allowed set: B, C, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a word that:
- Contains C and M  
- C not in position 1  
- M not in position 3  

Possible arrangements:
- C must be in position 3 (since 1 and 3 are the only open spots for C and M, and 3 is open for C)  
- M must be in position 1 (since 3 is excluded for M)  

So the word would be M U C I D.

Check:
- M U C I D – M, U, C, I, D  
- M is in position 1 (allowed, since M is in the word and not restricted here)  
- C is in position 3 (allowed, since C is in the word but not in position 1)  
- All letters are allowed.  

And ""MUCID"" is a valid English word (though rare, it's listed in some dictionaries as a variant of ""mucid"" meaning related to mucus).

Given the constraints, this seems to be the only possible word.
