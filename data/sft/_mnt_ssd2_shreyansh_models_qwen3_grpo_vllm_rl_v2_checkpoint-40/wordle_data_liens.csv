From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word contains the letters S and E, but:
- S is not in the 4th position.
- E is not in the 5th position.

Also, we know the letters A, R, O are not present at all.

For the next guess, I want to:
1. Keep S and E in different positions.
2. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tested yet.
3. Avoid A, R, O.

A good candidate is “STEIN”:
- S moves to position 1 (was 4).

- Introduces T, I, N which are common and untested.

This should help narrow down the remaining letters efficiently.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - A, R, O are not in the word.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. STEIN → S(-) T(x) E(✓) I(-) N(-)
   - T is not in the word.
   - E is in position 3 (✓), so the word has E in the 3rd slot.
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - I is in the word but not in position 4.
   - N is in the word but not in position 5.

Known so far:
- Letters in the word: E (position 3), S, I, N.
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, T.
- Positions ruled out:
  – S cannot be 1 or 4.
  – I cannot be 4.
  – N cannot be 5.

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5 (but 3 is E), so 2 or 5.
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 3, 5 (but 3 is E), so 1, 2, 5.
Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3, 4 (but 3 is E), so 1, 2, 4.

Let’s try to place S in position 2, I in position 1, and N in position 4. That gives the pattern:
I S E N _ (with S in 2, E in 3, N in 4).

We need a 5th letter that hasn’t been used yet and is common. Remaining common letters: D, L, C, B, G, etc. Trying D gives ISEND – but that’s not a valid word. Trying L gives ISLEN – also invalid. Trying B gives ISBEN – invalid. Trying G gives ISGEN – invalid. 

Let’s try a different arrangement. Suppose S is in position 5, I in position 1, N in position 2: I N E S _. We need a 5th letter. Valid word: INES_ – nothing obvious.

Another arrangement: S in position 2, I in position 5, N in position 1: N S E _ I. Need a 4th letter. Valid word: N S E _ I – maybe NSEKI (invalid) or NSELI (invalid).

Another arrangement: N in position 4, S in position 2, I in position 5: _ S E N I. Need a 1st letter. Valid word: CSEN I – no. BSENI – no. GSENI – no. 

Let’s try S in position 5, N in position 1, I in position 2: N I E _ S. Need a 4th letter. Valid word: NIEUS – no. NIECS – no. NIEBS – no.

Let’s try S in position 2, N in position 4, I in position 1: I S E N _. Need a 5th letter. Valid word: ISEN_ – nothing.

Wait, let’s list possible positions systematically:
E is fixed in 3.
S can be 2 or 5.
I can be 1, 2, 5.
N can be 1, 2, 4.

Case 1: S in 2
Then word: _ S E _ _
I must be 1 or 5.
N must be 1 or 4.

Subcase 1a: I in 1, N in 4 → I S E N _ → need 5th letter. Valid word: ISENS – no. ISENE – no. ISEN_ – nothing obvious.

Subcase 1b: I in 5, N in 1 → N S E _ I → need 4th letter. Valid word: NSEKI – no. NSELI – no. NSEDI – no.

Case 2: S in 5
Then word: _ _ E _ S
I can be 1, 2, 4 (but not 4 because I cannot be 4 – wait, I can be 1, 2, 5, but 5 is S, so 1 or 2).
N can be 1, 2, 4.

Subcase 2a: I in 1, N in 2 → I N E _ S → need 4th letter. Valid word: INEWS – yes! (INEWS is a valid word meaning news in a different sense, or a surname).

Let’s check if INEWS uses allowed letters: I, N, E, W, S – all allowed so far (no A, R, O, T), and positions:
- I in 1 (allowed)
- N in 2 (allowed)
- E in 3 (correct)
- W (new letter)
- S in 5 (allowed)

This seems valid.

Therefore, the next guess is INEWS.

We need a 5th letter that hasn’t been used yet and is common. Remaining common letters: D, L, C, B, G, etc. Trying D gives ISEND – but that’s not a valid word. Trying L gives ISLEN – also invalid. Trying B gives ISBEN – invalid. Trying G gives ISGEN – invalid. 

Let’s try a different arrangement. Suppose S is in position 5, I in position 1, N in position 2: I N E S _. We need a 5th letter. Valid word: INES_ – nothing obvious.

Another arrangement: S in position 2, I in position 5, N in position 1: N S E _ I. Need a 4th letter. Valid word: N S E _ I – maybe NSEKI (invalid) or NSELI (invalid).

Another arrangement: N in position 4, S in position 2, I in position 5: _ S E N I. Need a 1st letter. Valid word: CSEN I – no. BSENI – no. GSENI – no. 

Let’s try S in position 5, N in position 1, I in position 2: N I E _ S. Need a 4th letter. Valid word: NIEUS – no. NIECS – no. NIEBS – no.

Let’s try S in position 2, N in position 4, I in position 1: I S E N _. Need a 5th letter. Valid word: ISEN_ – nothing.

Wait, let’s list possible positions systematically:
E is fixed in 3.
S can be 2 or 5.
I can be 1, 2, 5.
N can be 1, 2, 4.

Case 1: S in 2
Then word: _ S E _ _
I must be 1 or 5.
N must be 1 or 4.

Subcase 1a: I in 1, N in 4 → I S E N _ → need 5th letter. Valid word: ISENS – no. ISENE – no. ISEN_ – nothing obvious.

Subcase 1b: I in 5, N in 1 → N S E _ I → need 4th letter. Valid word: NSEKI – no. NSELI – no. NSEDI – no.

Case 2: S in 5
Then word: _ _ E _ S
I can be 1, 2, 4 (but not 4 because I cannot be 4 – wait, I can be 1, 2, 5, but 5 is S, so 1 or 2).
N can be 1, 2, 4.

Subcase 2a: I in 1, N in 2 → I N E _ S → need 4th letter. Valid word: INEWS – yes! (INEWS is a valid word meaning news in a different sense, or a surname).

Let’s check if INEWS uses allowed letters: I, N, E, W, S – all allowed so far (no A, R, O, T), and positions:
- I in 1 (allowed)
- N in 2 (allowed)
- E in 3 (correct)
- W (new letter)
- S in 5 (allowed)

This seems valid.

Therefore, the next guess is INEWS.

Let's process the new feedback from INEWS:

INEWS → I(-) N(-) E(✓) W(x) S(✓)

Interpretation:
- I is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- E is correctly in position 3 (✓).
- W is NOT in the word (x).
- S is correctly in position 5 (✓).

So far we know:
- Fixed letters: E in 3, S in 5.
- Letters definitely in the word: I, N (both misplaced).
- Letters ruled out: A, R, O, T, W.
- Positions ruled out:
  – I cannot be in 1.
  – N cannot be in 2.

Current pattern: _ _ E _ S
We need to place I and N in the remaining slots (1, 2, 4) with the constraints:
- I must be in 2 or 4 (cannot be 1 or 3 or 5).
- N must be in 1 or 4 (cannot be 2 or 3 or 5).

Possible arrangements:
1. N I E _ S → but I would be in 2 (allowed), N in 1 (allowed). Need a 4th letter.
   - Valid word: N I E _ S → NIECS – no. NIEBS – no. NIEGS – no. NIEFS – no.
2. N _ E I S → N in 1, I in 4. Need a 2nd letter. Valid word: N _ E I S → NDEIS – no. NLEIS – no. NBEIS – no.
3. _ N E I S → I in 4, N in 2 – but N cannot be in 2 (from feedback). Invalid.
4. _ I E N S → I in 2, N in 4. Need a 1st letter. Valid word: B I E N S – no. C I E N S – no. D I E N S – no.

Let’s look for a word fitting _ I E N S or N I E _ S with allowed letters.

Looking at _ I E N S: first letter must be unused common consonant. Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, etc.
- B I E N S – not a word.
- C I E N S – not a word.
- D I E N S – not a word.
- F I E N S – not a word.
- G I E N S – not a word.
- L I E N S – not a word.
- M I E N S – not a word.
- P I E N S – not a word.

Looking at N I E _ S: fourth letter must be unused consonant.
- N I E D S – not a word.
- N I E L S – not a word.
- N I E G S – not a word.
- N I E C S – not a word.
- N I E B S – not a word.

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Let me reconsider the possible arrangements.

Wait, maybe the word is _ N E I S. Let me check:
- First letter: unused consonant.
- N in 2 (but feedback says N is in the word but wrong position, and in INEWS N was in 2 and got (-), so N cannot be in 2). So _ N E I S is invalid because N would be in 2.

Another arrangement: I must be in 2 or 4, N must be in 1 or 4, and they can't both be in 4.

So:
- If I is in 2, N must be in 1 → N I E _ S → need 4th letter. Valid word: N I E N S – no. N I E D S – no.
- If I is in 4, N must be in 1 → N _ E I S → need 2nd letter. Valid word: N _ E I S → N D E I S – no. N L E I S – no. N B E I S – no.

This is tricky. Let me think of 5-letter words ending in ES with E in 3 and S in 5, containing I and N, and no A, R, O, T, W.

Possible candidates:
- ""NIESE"" – but double E and not common.
- ""NINSE"" – no.
- ""LENIS"" – but L and E, but E is already in 3, and this would have E in 2 and 3, which might be possible, but let's check:
  L E N I S – but E is supposed to be in 3, so this doesn't fit _ _ E _ S.

Wait, let me systematically list possible words:
We need _ _ E _ S with letters I, N, E, S and no A, R, O, T, W.

Possible permutations:
- N I E _ S → N I E _ S → need 4th letter. Valid word: N I E N S – no. N I E D S – no.
- N _ E I S → N _ E I S → N D E I S – no. N L E I S – no.
- _ N E I S → _ N E I S → B N E I S – no. C N E I S – no.
- _ I E N S → _ I E N S → B I E N S – no. C I E N S – no.

This suggests the word might be ""NIESE"" (a variant spelling or surname), but it's not standard.

Alternatively, perhaps the word is ""LENIS"" but this doesn't fit the E in 3.

Wait, let me think differently: maybe the word is ""NINES"" but this has N in 1 and 3, but E is in 3, so N I N E S – but this has N in 2 and 3, which might be possible, but let's check:
N I N E S:
- N in 1: allowed
- I in 2: allowed
- N in 3: but E must be in 3, so this is invalid.

Another candidate: ""PINES"" – but P is new, I in 2, N in 4, E in 3, S in 5.
Check constraints:
- P: new letter, allowed
- I: in 2 (allowed)
- N: in 4 (allowed, since N was in 2 before and got (-), so 4 is new)
- E: in 3 (correct)
- S: in 5 (correct)
- No A, R, O, T, W.

""PINES"" fits all constraints perfectly!

Let me verify:
- P I N E S:
  - I is in the word (yes) and in position 2 (new position).
  - N is in the word (yes) and in position 4 (new position).
  - E is in position 3 (correct).
  - S is in position 5 (correct).

This seems to be the valid guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word right away.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word contains the letters S and E, but:
- S is not in the 4th position.
- E is not in the 5th position.

Also, we know the letters A, R, O are not present at all.

For the next guess, I want to:
1. Keep S and E in different positions.
2. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tested yet.
3. Avoid A, R, O.

A good candidate is “STEIN”:
- S moves to position 1 (was 4).
- E moves to position 2 (was 5).
- Introduces T, I, N which are common and untested.

This should help narrow down the remaining letters efficiently.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - A, R, O are not in the word.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. STEIN → S(-) T(x) E(✓) I(-) N(-)
   - T is not in the word.
   - E is in position 3 (✓), so the word has E in the 3rd slot.
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - I is in the word but not in position 4.
   - N is in the word but not in position 5.

Known so far:
- Letters in the word: E (position 3), S, I, N.
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, T.
- Positions ruled out:
  – S cannot be 1 or 4.
  – I cannot be 4.
  – N cannot be 5.

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5 (but 3 is E), so 2 or 5.
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 3, 5 (but 3 is E), so 1, 2, 5.
Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3, 4 (but 3 is E), so 1, 2, 4.

Let’s try to place S in position 2, I in position 1, and N in position 4. That gives the pattern:
I S E N _ (with S in 2, E in 3, N in 4).

We need a 5th letter that hasn’t been used yet and is common. Remaining common letters: D, L, C, B, G, etc. Trying D gives ISEND – but that’s not a valid word. Trying L gives ISLEN – also invalid. Trying B gives ISBEN – invalid. Trying G gives ISGEN – invalid. 

Let’s try a different arrangement. Suppose S is in position 5, I in position 1, N in position 2: I N E S _. We need a 5th letter. Valid word: INES_ – nothing obvious.

Another arrangement: S in position 2, I in position 5, N in position 1: N S E _ I. Need a 4th letter. Valid word: N S E _ I – maybe NSEKI (invalid) or NSELI (invalid).

Another arrangement: N in position 4, S in position 2, I in position 5: _ S E N I. Need a 1st letter. Valid word: CSEN I – no. BSENI – no. GSENI – no. 

Let’s try S in position 5, N in position 1, I in position 2: N I E _ S. Need a 4th letter. Valid word: NIEUS – no. NIECS – no. NIEBS – no.

Let’s try S in position 2, N in position 4, I in position 1: I S E N _. Need a 5th letter. Valid word: ISEN_ – nothing.

Wait, let’s list possible positions systematically:
E is fixed in 3.
S can be 2 or 5.
I can be 1, 2, 5.
N can be 1, 2, 4.

Case 1: S in 2
Then word: _ S E _ _
I must be 1 or 5.
N must be 1 or 4.

Subcase 1a: I in 1, N in 4 → I S E N _ → need 5th letter. Valid word: ISENS – no. ISENE – no. ISEN_ – nothing obvious.

Subcase 1b: I in 5, N in 1 → N S E _ I → need 4th letter. Valid word: NSEKI – no. NSELI – no. NSEDI – no.

Case 2: S in 5
Then word: _ _ E _ S
I can be 1, 2, 4 (but not 4 because I cannot be 4 – wait, I can be 1, 2, 5, but 5 is S, so 1 or 2).
N can be 1, 2, 4.

Subcase 2a: I in 1, N in 2 → I N E _ S → need 4th letter. Valid word: INEWS – yes! (INEWS is a valid word meaning news in a different sense, or a surname).

Let’s check if INEWS uses allowed letters: I, N, E, W, S – all allowed so far (no A, R, O, T), and positions:
- I in 1 (allowed)
- N in 2 (allowed)
- E in 3 (correct)
- W (new letter)
- S in 5 (allowed)

This seems valid.

Therefore, the next guess is INEWS.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STEIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) E(✓) I(-) N(-)
Guess 3: INEWS -> FEEDBACK: I(-) N(-) E(✓) W(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's process the new feedback from INEWS:

INEWS → I(-) N(-) E(✓) W(x) S(✓)

Interpretation:
- I is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- E is correctly in position 3 (✓).
- W is NOT in the word (x).
- S is correctly in position 5 (✓).

So far we know:
- Fixed letters: E in 3, S in 5.
- Letters definitely in the word: I, N (both misplaced).
- Letters ruled out: A, R, O, T, W.
- Positions ruled out:
  – I cannot be in 1.
  – N cannot be in 2.

Current pattern: _ _ E _ S
We need to place I and N in the remaining slots (1, 2, 4) with the constraints:
- I must be in 2 or 4 (cannot be 1 or 3 or 5).
- N must be in 1 or 4 (cannot be 2 or 3 or 5).

Possible arrangements:
1. N I E _ S → but I would be in 2 (allowed), N in 1 (allowed). Need a 4th letter.
   - Valid word: N I E _ S → NIECS – no. NIEBS – no. NIEGS – no. NIEFS – no.
2. N _ E I S → N in 1, I in 4. Need a 2nd letter. Valid word: N _ E I S → NDEIS – no. NLEIS – no. NBEIS – no.
3. _ N E I S → I in 4, N in 2 – but N cannot be in 2 (from feedback). Invalid.
4. _ I E N S → I in 2, N in 4. Need a 1st letter. Valid word: B I E N S – no. C I E N S – no. D I E N S – no.

Let’s look for a word fitting _ I E N S or N I E _ S with allowed letters.

Looking at _ I E N S: first letter must be unused common consonant. Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, etc.
- B I E N S – not a word.
- C I E N S – not a word.
- D I E N S – not a word.
- F I E N S – not a word.
- G I E N S – not a word.
- L I E N S – not a word.
- M I E N S – not a word.
- P I E N S – not a word.

Looking at N I E _ S: fourth letter must be unused consonant.
- N I E D S – not a word.
- N I E L S – not a word.
- N I E G S – not a word.
- N I E C S – not a word.
- N I E B S – not a word.

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Let me reconsider the possible arrangements.

Wait, maybe the word is _ N E I S. Let me check:
- First letter: unused consonant.
- N in 2 (but feedback says N is in the word but wrong position, and in INEWS N was in 2 and got (-), so N cannot be in 2). So _ N E I S is invalid because N would be in 2.

Another arrangement: I must be in 2 or 4, N must be in 1 or 4, and they can't both be in 4.

So:
- If I is in 2, N must be in 1 → N I E _ S → need 4th letter. Valid word: N I E N S – no. N I E D S – no.
- If I is in 4, N must be in 1 → N _ E I S → need 2nd letter. Valid word: N _ E I S → N D E I S – no. N L E I S – no. N B E I S – no.

This is tricky. Let me think of 5-letter words ending in ES with E in 3 and S in 5, containing I and N, and no A, R, O, T, W.

Possible candidates:
- ""NIESE"" – but double E and not common.
- ""NINSE"" – no.
- ""LENIS"" – but L and E, but E is already in 3, and this would have E in 2 and 3, which might be possible, but let's check:
  L E N I S – but E is supposed to be in 3, so this doesn't fit _ _ E _ S.

Wait, let me systematically list possible words:
We need _ _ E _ S with letters I, N, E, S and no A, R, O, T, W.

Possible permutations:
- N I E _ S → N I E _ S → need 4th letter. Valid word: N I E N S – no. N I E D S – no.
- N _ E I S → N _ E I S → N D E I S – no. N L E I S – no.
- _ N E I S → _ N E I S → B N E I S – no. C N E I S – no.
- _ I E N S → _ I E N S → B I E N S – no. C I E N S – no.

This suggests the word might be ""NIESE"" (a variant spelling or surname), but it's not standard.

Alternatively, perhaps the word is ""LENIS"" but this doesn't fit the E in 3.

Wait, let me think differently: maybe the word is ""NINES"" but this has N in 1 and 3, but E is in 3, so N I N E S – but this has N in 2 and 3, which might be possible, but let's check:
N I N E S:
- N in 1: allowed
- I in 2: allowed
- N in 3: but E must be in 3, so this is invalid.

Another candidate: ""PINES"" – but P is new, I in 2, N in 4, E in 3, S in 5.
Check constraints:
- P: new letter, allowed
- I: in 2 (allowed)
- N: in 4 (allowed, since N was in 2 before and got (-), so 4 is new)
- E: in 3 (correct)
- S: in 5 (correct)
- No A, R, O, T, W.

""PINES"" fits all constraints perfectly!

Let me verify:
- P I N E S:
  - I is in the word (yes) and in position 2 (new position).
  - N is in the word (yes) and in position 4 (new position).
  - E is in position 3 (correct).
  - S is in position 5 (correct).
  - No forbidden letters.

This seems to be the valid guess.

Let's digest the new feedback from PINES:

PINES → P(x) I(✓) N(-) E(-) S(✓)

Interpretation:
- P is NOT in the word (x).
- I is in the word and in the CORRECT position 2 (✓).
- N is in the word but in the WRONG position (-).
- E is in the word but in the WRONG position (-).
- S is in the word and in the CORRECT position 5 (✓).

So far we know:
- Fixed letters: I in 2, S in 5.
- E must be in the word but NOT in position 3 (because in PINES it was in 4 and got (-)).
- N must be in the word but NOT in position 3 (because in PINES it was in 3 and got (-)).
- Letters ruled out: A, R, O, T, W, P.

Current pattern: _ I _ _ S
We need to place E and N in positions 1, 3, 4 with the constraints:
- E cannot be in 3.
- N cannot be in 3.

Possible positions:
- E can be 1, 4.
- N can be 1, 4.

They must occupy two different slots among 1, 3, 4, with E not in 3 and N not in 3.

Thus:
- If E is in 1, then N must be in 4.
- If E is in 4, then N must be in 1.

So two possible skeletons:
1. E I _ N S → need 3rd letter.
2. N I _ E S → need 3rd letter.

Letters available: any not ruled out (not A, R, O, T, W, P).

Let's check both cases.

Case 1: E I _ N S
Need a 3rd letter that is:
- Not any of A, R, O, T, W, P.
- Not E, I, N, S (they are already used).
Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Valid 5-letter word: E I _ N S.
Looking for common words:
- EINHS – no.
- EINNS – no.
- EINHS – no.
Actually, ""EIN"" is a prefix but not sure.

Case 2: N I _ E S
Need a 3rd letter.
Possible letters same as above.
Looking for common words:
- N I _ E S.
Possible candidates:
  - N I V E S – ""NIVES"" – but V is allowed, and it's a word (variant of ""nive"" or surname).
  - N I C E S – ""NICES"" – but C is allowed, and it's a word (plural of nice).
  - N I D E S – ""NIDES"" – but D is allowed, and it's a word (plural of nide, but rarer).
  - N I L E S – ""NILSE"" – but L is allowed, but this seems less common.

Let's check ""NICES"":
- N I C E S:
  - N in 1: allowed (was in 3 before, now new position).
  - I in 2: correct.
  - C: new letter, allowed.
  - E in 4: allowed (was in 3 before, now new position).
  - S in 5: correct.
  - No forbidden letters.

This fits perfectly.

Therefore, the next guess is NICES.

1. E I _ N S → need 3rd letter.
2. N I _ E S → need 3rd letter.

Letters available: any not ruled out (not A, R, O, T, W, P).

Let's check both cases.

Case 1: E I _ N S
Need a 3rd letter that is:
- Not any of A, R, O, T, W, P.
- Not E, I, N, S (they are already used).
Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Valid 5-letter word: E I _ N S.
Looking for common words:
- EINHS – no.
- EINNS – no.
- EINHS – no.
Actually, ""EIN"" is a prefix but not sure.

Case 2: N I _ E S
Need a 3rd letter.
Possible letters same as above.
Looking for common words:
- N I _ E S.
Possible candidates:
  - N I V E S – ""NIVES"" – but V is allowed, and it's a word (variant of ""nive"" or surname).
  - N I C E S – ""NICES"" – but C is allowed, and it's a word (plural of nice).
  - N I D E S – ""NIDES"" – but D is allowed, and it's a word (plural of nide, but rarer).
  - N I L E S – ""NILSE"" – but L is allowed, but this seems less common.

Let's check ""NICES"":
- N I C E S:
  - N in 1: allowed (was in 3 before, now new position).
  - I in 2: correct.
  - C: new letter, allowed.
  - E in 4: allowed (was in 3 before, now new position).
  - S in 5: correct.
  - No forbidden letters.

This fits perfectly.

Therefore, the next guess is NICES.",Guess 5: NICES -> FEEDBACK: N(-) I(✓) C(x) E(-) S(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word right away.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word contains the letters S and E, but:
- S is not in the 4th position.
- E is not in the 5th position.

Also, we know the letters A, R, O are not present at all.

For the next guess, I want to:
1. Keep S and E in different positions.
2. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tested yet.
3. Avoid A, R, O.

A good candidate is “STEIN”:
- S moves to position 1 (was 4).
- E moves to position 2 (was 5).
- Introduces T, I, N which are common and untested.

This should help narrow down the remaining letters efficiently.

Guess 2: STEIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) E(✓) I(-) N(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - A, R, O are not in the word.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. STEIN → S(-) T(x) E(✓) I(-) N(-)
   - T is not in the word.
   - E is in position 3 (✓), so the word has E in the 3rd slot.
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - I is in the word but not in position 4.
   - N is in the word but not in position 5.

Known so far:
- Letters in the word: E (position 3), S, I, N.
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, T.
- Positions ruled out:
  – S cannot be 1 or 4.
  – I cannot be 4.
  – N cannot be 5.

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5 (but 3 is E), so 2 or 5.
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 3, 5 (but 3 is E), so 1, 2, 5.
Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3, 4 (but 3 is E), so 1, 2, 4.

Let’s try to place S in position 2, I in position 1, and N in position 4. That gives the pattern:
I S E N _ (with S in 2, E in 3, N in 4).

We need a 5th letter that hasn’t been used yet and is common. Remaining common letters: D, L, C, B, G, etc. Trying D gives ISEND – but that’s not a valid word. Trying L gives ISLEN – also invalid. Trying B gives ISBEN – invalid. Trying G gives ISGEN – invalid. 

Let’s try a different arrangement. Suppose S is in position 5, I in position 1, N in position 2: I N E S _. We need a 5th letter. Valid word: INES_ – nothing obvious.

Another arrangement: S in position 2, I in position 5, N in position 1: N S E _ I. Need a 4th letter. Valid word: N S E _ I – maybe NSEKI (invalid) or NSELI (invalid).

Another arrangement: N in position 4, S in position 2, I in position 5: _ S E N I. Need a 1st letter. Valid word: CSEN I – no. BSENI – no. GSENI – no. 

Let’s try S in position 5, N in position 1, I in position 2: N I E _ S. Need a 4th letter. Valid word: NIEUS – no. NIECS – no. NIEBS – no.

Let’s try S in position 2, N in position 4, I in position 1: I S E N _. Need a 5th letter. Valid word: ISEN_ – nothing.

Wait, let’s list possible positions systematically:
E is fixed in 3.
S can be 2 or 5.
I can be 1, 2, 5.
N can be 1, 2, 4.

Case 1: S in 2
Then word: _ S E _ _
I must be 1 or 5.
N must be 1 or 4.

Subcase 1a: I in 1, N in 4 → I S E N _ → need 5th letter. Valid word: ISENS – no. ISENE – no. ISEN_ – nothing obvious.

Subcase 1b: I in 5, N in 1 → N S E _ I → need 4th letter. Valid word: NSEKI – no. NSELI – no. NSEDI – no.

Case 2: S in 5
Then word: _ _ E _ S
I can be 1, 2, 4 (but not 4 because I cannot be 4 – wait, I can be 1, 2, 5, but 5 is S, so 1 or 2).
N can be 1, 2, 4.

Subcase 2a: I in 1, N in 2 → I N E _ S → need 4th letter. Valid word: INEWS – yes! (INEWS is a valid word meaning news in a different sense, or a surname).

Let’s check if INEWS uses allowed letters: I, N, E, W, S – all allowed so far (no A, R, O, T), and positions:
- I in 1 (allowed)
- N in 2 (allowed)
- E in 3 (correct)
- W (new letter)
- S in 5 (allowed)

This seems valid.

Therefore, the next guess is INEWS.

Guess 3: INEWS -> FEEDBACK: I(-) N(-) E(✓) W(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's process the new feedback from INEWS:

INEWS → I(-) N(-) E(✓) W(x) S(✓)

Interpretation:
- I is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- E is correctly in position 3 (✓).
- W is NOT in the word (x).
- S is correctly in position 5 (✓).

So far we know:
- Fixed letters: E in 3, S in 5.
- Letters definitely in the word: I, N (both misplaced).
- Letters ruled out: A, R, O, T, W.
- Positions ruled out:
  – I cannot be in 1.
  – N cannot be in 2.

Current pattern: _ _ E _ S
We need to place I and N in the remaining slots (1, 2, 4) with the constraints:
- I must be in 2 or 4 (cannot be 1 or 3 or 5).
- N must be in 1 or 4 (cannot be 2 or 3 or 5).

Possible arrangements:
1. N I E _ S → but I would be in 2 (allowed), N in 1 (allowed). Need a 4th letter.
   - Valid word: N I E _ S → NIECS – no. NIEBS – no. NIEGS – no. NIEFS – no.
2. N _ E I S → N in 1, I in 4. Need a 2nd letter. Valid word: N _ E I S → NDEIS – no. NLEIS – no. NBEIS – no.
3. _ N E I S → I in 4, N in 2 – but N cannot be in 2 (from feedback). Invalid.
4. _ I E N S → I in 2, N in 4. Need a 1st letter. Valid word: B I E N S – no. C I E N S – no. D I E N S – no.

Let’s look for a word fitting _ I E N S or N I E _ S with allowed letters.

Looking at _ I E N S: first letter must be unused common consonant. Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, etc.
- B I E N S – not a word.
- C I E N S – not a word.
- D I E N S – not a word.
- F I E N S – not a word.
- G I E N S – not a word.
- L I E N S – not a word.
- M I E N S – not a word.
- P I E N S – not a word.

Looking at N I E _ S: fourth letter must be unused consonant.
- N I E D S – not a word.
- N I E L S – not a word.
- N I E G S – not a word.
- N I E C S – not a word.
- N I E B S – not a word.

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Let me reconsider the possible arrangements.

Wait, maybe the word is _ N E I S. Let me check:
- First letter: unused consonant.
- N in 2 (but feedback says N is in the word but wrong position, and in INEWS N was in 2 and got (-), so N cannot be in 2). So _ N E I S is invalid because N would be in 2.

Another arrangement: I must be in 2 or 4, N must be in 1 or 4, and they can't both be in 4.

So:
- If I is in 2, N must be in 1 → N I E _ S → need 4th letter. Valid word: N I E N S – no. N I E D S – no.
- If I is in 4, N must be in 1 → N _ E I S → need 2nd letter. Valid word: N _ E I S → N D E I S – no. N L E I S – no. N B E I S – no.

This is tricky. Let me think of 5-letter words ending in ES with E in 3 and S in 5, containing I and N, and no A, R, O, T, W.

Possible candidates:
- ""NIESE"" – but double E and not common.
- ""NINSE"" – no.
- ""LENIS"" – but L and E, but E is already in 3, and this would have E in 2 and 3, which might be possible, but let's check:
  L E N I S – but E is supposed to be in 3, so this doesn't fit _ _ E _ S.

Wait, let me systematically list possible words:
We need _ _ E _ S with letters I, N, E, S and no A, R, O, T, W.

Possible permutations:
- N I E _ S → N I E _ S → need 4th letter. Valid word: N I E N S – no. N I E D S – no.
- N _ E I S → N _ E I S → N D E I S – no. N L E I S – no.
- _ N E I S → _ N E I S → B N E I S – no. C N E I S – no.
- _ I E N S → _ I E N S → B I E N S – no. C I E N S – no.

This suggests the word might be ""NIESE"" (a variant spelling or surname), but it's not standard.

Alternatively, perhaps the word is ""LENIS"" but this doesn't fit the E in 3.

Wait, let me think differently: maybe the word is ""NINES"" but this has N in 1 and 3, but E is in 3, so N I N E S – but this has N in 2 and 3, which might be possible, but let's check:
N I N E S:
- N in 1: allowed
- I in 2: allowed
- N in 3: but E must be in 3, so this is invalid.

Another candidate: ""PINES"" – but P is new, I in 2, N in 4, E in 3, S in 5.
Check constraints:
- P: new letter, allowed
- I: in 2 (allowed)
- N: in 4 (allowed, since N was in 2 before and got (-), so 4 is new)
- E: in 3 (correct)
- S: in 5 (correct)
- No A, R, O, T, W.

""PINES"" fits all constraints perfectly!

Let me verify:
- P I N E S:
  - I is in the word (yes) and in position 2 (new position).
  - N is in the word (yes) and in position 4 (new position).
  - E is in position 3 (correct).
  - S is in position 5 (correct).
  - No forbidden letters.

This seems to be the valid guess.

Let's digest the new feedback from PINES:

PINES → P(x) I(✓) N(-) E(-) S(✓)

Interpretation:
- P is NOT in the word (x).
- I is in the word and in the CORRECT position 2 (✓).
- N is in the word but in the WRONG position (-).
- E is in the word but in the WRONG position (-).
- S is in the word and in the CORRECT position 5 (✓).

So far we know:
- Fixed letters: I in 2, S in 5.
- E must be in the word but NOT in position 3 (because in PINES it was in 4 and got (-)).
- N must be in the word but NOT in position 3 (because in PINES it was in 3 and got (-)).
- Letters ruled out: A, R, O, T, W, P.

Current pattern: _ I _ _ S
We need to place E and N in positions 1, 3, 4 with the constraints:
- E cannot be in 3.
- N cannot be in 3.

Possible positions:
- E can be 1, 4.
- N can be 1, 4.

They must occupy two different slots among 1, 3, 4, with E not in 3 and N not in 3.

Thus:
- If E is in 1, then N must be in 4.
- If E is in 4, then N must be in 1.

So two possible skeletons:
1. E I _ N S → need 3rd letter.
2. N I _ E S → need 3rd letter.

Letters available: any not ruled out (not A, R, O, T, W, P).

Let's check both cases.

Case 1: E I _ N S
Need a 3rd letter that is:
- Not any of A, R, O, T, W, P.
- Not E, I, N, S (they are already used).
Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Valid 5-letter word: E I _ N S.
Looking for common words:
- EINHS – no.
- EINNS – no.
- EINHS – no.
Actually, ""EIN"" is a prefix but not sure.

Case 2: N I _ E S
Need a 3rd letter.
Possible letters same as above.
Looking for common words:
- N I _ E S.
Possible candidates:
  - N I V E S – ""NIVES"" – but V is allowed, and it's a word (variant of ""nive"" or surname).
  - N I C E S – ""NICES"" – but C is allowed, and it's a word (plural of nice).
  - N I D E S – ""NIDES"" – but D is allowed, and it's a word (plural of nide, but rarer).
  - N I L E S – ""NILSE"" – but L is allowed, but this seems less common.

Let's check ""NICES"":
- N I C E S:
  - N in 1: allowed (was in 3 before, now new position).
  - I in 2: correct.
  - C: new letter, allowed.
  - E in 4: allowed (was in 3 before, now new position).
  - S in 5: correct.
  - No forbidden letters.

This fits perfectly.

Therefore, the next guess is NICES.

Need a 1st letter. Valid word: B I E N S – no. C I E N S – no. D I E N S – no.\n\nLet’s look for a word fitting _ I E N S or N I E _ S with allowed letters.\n\nLooking at _ I E N S: first letter must be unused common consonant. Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, etc.\n- B I E N S – not a word.\n- C I E N S – not a word.\n- D I E N S – not a word.\n- F I E N S – not a word.\n- G I E N S – not a word.\n- L I E N S – not a word.\n- M I E N S – not a word.\n- P I E N S – not a word.\n\nLooking at N I E _ S: fourth letter must be unused consonant.\n- N I E D S – not a word.\n- N I E L S – not a word.\n- N I E G S – not a word.\n- N I E C S – not a word.\n- N I E B S – not a word.\n\nHmm, none of these seem valid. Let me reconsider the possible arrangements.\n\nWait, maybe the word is _ N E I S. Let me check:\n- First letter: unused consonant.\n- N in 2 (but feedback says N is in the word but wrong position, and in INEWS N was in 2 and got (-), so N cannot be in 2). So _ N E I S is invalid because N would be in 2.\n\nAnother arrangement: I must be in 2 or 4, N must be in 1 or 4, and they can\'t both be in 4.\n\nSo:\n- If I is in 2, N must be in 1 → N I E _ S → need 4th letter. Valid word: N I E N S – no. N I E D S – no.\n- If I is in 4, N must be in 1 → N _ E I S → need 2nd letter. Valid word: N _ E I S → N D E I S – no. N L E I S – no. N B E I S – no.\n\nThis is tricky. Let me think of 5-letter words ending in ES with E in 3 and S in 5, containing I and N, and no A, R, O, T, W.\n\nPossible candidates:\n- ""NIESE"" – but double E and not common.\n- ""NINSE"" – no.\n- ""LENIS"" – but L and E, but E is already in 3, and this would have E in 2 and 3, which might be possible, but let\'s check:\n  L E N I S – but E is supposed to be in 3, so this doesn\'t fit _ _ E _ S.\n\nWait, let me systematically list possible words:\nWe need _ _ E _ S with letters I, N, E, S and no A, R, O, T, W.\n\nPossible permutations:\n- N I E _ S → N I E _ S → need 4th letter. Valid word: N I E N S – no. N I E D S – no.\n- N _ E I S → N _ E I S → N D E I S – no. N L E I S – no.\n- _ N E I S → _ N E I S → B N E I S – no. C N E I S – no.\n- _ I E N S → _ I E N S → B I E N S – no. C I E N S – no.\n\nThis suggests the word might be ""NIESE"" (a variant spelling or surname), but it\'s not standard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the word is ""LENIS"" but this doesn\'t fit the E in 3.\n\nWait, let me think differently: maybe the word is ""NINES"" but this has N in 1 and 3, but E is in 3, so N I N E S – but this has N in 2 and 3, which might be possible, but let\'s check:\nN I N E S:\n- N in 1: allowed\n- I in 2: allowed\n- N in 3: but E must be in 3, so this is invalid.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PINES"" – but P is new, I in 2, N in 4, E in 3, S in 5.\nCheck constraints:\n- P: new letter, allowed\n- I: in 2 (allowed)\n- N: in 4 (allowed, since N was in 2 before and got (-), so 4 is new)\n- E: in 3 (correct)\n- S: in 5 (correct)\n- No A, R, O, T, W.\n\n""PINES"" fits all constraints perfectly!\n\nLet me verify:\n- P I N E S:\n  - I is in the word (yes) and in position 2 (new position).\n  - N is in the word (yes) and in position 4 (new position).\n  - E is in position 3 (correct).\n  - S is in position 5 (correct).\n  - No forbidden letters.\n\nThis seems to be the valid guess.\n\n<guess>PINES</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: STEIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) E(✓) I(-) N(-)\nGuess 3: INEWS -> FEEDBACK: I(-) N(-) E(✓) W(x) S(✓)\nGuess 4: PINES -> FEEDBACK: P(x) I(✓) N(-) E(-) S(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Let\'s digest the new feedback from PINES:\n\nPINES → P(x) I(✓) N(-) E(-) S(✓)\n\nInterpretation:\n- P is NOT in the word (x).\n- I is in the word and in the CORRECT position 2 (✓).\n- N is in the word but in the WRONG position (-).\n- E is in the word but in the WRONG position (-).\n- S is in the word and in the CORRECT position 5 (✓).\n\nSo far we know:\n- Fixed letters: I in 2, S in 5.\n- E must be in the word but NOT in position 3 (because in PINES it was in 4 and got (-)).\n- N must be in the word but NOT in position 3 (because in PINES it was in 3 and got (-)).\n- Letters ruled out: A, R, O, T, W, P.\n\nCurrent pattern: _ I _ _ S\nWe need to place E and N in positions 1, 3, 4 with the constraints:\n- E cannot be in 3.\n- N cannot be in 3.\n\nPossible positions:\n- E can be 1, 4.\n- N can be 1, 4.\n\nThey must occupy two different slots among 1, 3, 4, with E not in 3 and N not in 3.\n\nThus:\n- If E is in 1, then N must be in 4.\n- If E is in 4, then N must be in 1.\n\nSo two possible skeletons:\n1.

From the latest feedback on NICES:

N I C E S → N(-) I(✓) C(x) E(-) S(✓)

Interpretation:
- N is in the word but in the WRONG position (-).
- I is in the word and in the CORRECT position 2 (✓).
- C is NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the WRONG position (-).
- S is in the word and in the CORRECT position 5 (✓).

So far we know:
- Fixed letters: I in 2, S in 5.
- Letters in the word but positions unknown: N, E.
- Letters ruled out: A, R, O, T, W, P, C.

Current pattern: _ I _ _ S
We need to place N and E in positions 1, 3, 4 with the constraints:
- N cannot be in 1 (because in NICES it was in 1 and got (-), so it must be elsewhere).
- E cannot be in 4 (because in NICES it was in 4 and got (-), so it must be elsewhere).

Thus:
- N must be in 3 or 4.
- E must be in 1 or 3.

They must occupy two different slots among 1, 3, 4.

Possible arrangements:
1. If N is in 3, then E must be in 1 → E I N _ S → need 4th letter.
2. If N is in 4, then E must be in 1 or 3 → 
   - E in 1 → E I _ N S → need 3rd letter.
   - E in 3 → _ I E N S → need 1st letter.

Let's explore these.

Case 1: E I N _ S → need 4th letter.
Letters available: any not ruled out (not A, R, O, T, W, P, C).
Possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.
Valid 5-letter word: E I N _ S.

- EINHS – no.
- EINSS – no.
- EINNS – no.
This seems unlikely.

- E I L N S – ""EILNS"" – no.
- E I M N S – ""EIMNS"" – no.
- E I B N S – ""EIBNS"" – no.
This also seems unlikely.

Case 2b: _ I E N S → need 1st letter.

- G I E N S – ""GIENS"" – no.
- H I E N S – ""HIENS"" – no.
- L I E N S – ""LIENS"" – yes! ""LIENS"" is a valid word (plural of lien).

Check ""LIENS"":
- L: new letter, allowed.
