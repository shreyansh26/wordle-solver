### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that will give us the most information possible. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. This helps eliminate or confirm many letters at once.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

A word like ""AROSE"" contains 5 of these common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This gives us a good starting point to gather information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Another good option could be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems like a strong first guess to maximize information gain.

So far we have:

  The only remaining spot for R is position 3.

- We still need two more letters for positions 1 and 4, chosen from the remaining alphabet (avoiding the banned letters).

Common remaining consonants: T, N, L, G, H, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Let’s try to find a word that fits:
- Pattern: _ O R _ A  
- First and fourth letters must be from allowed set.

A good candidate is “GORAL” but L is allowed and G is allowed, but “GORAL” is not a common word.  
Another is “TORAN” but N is allowed and T is allowed, but “TORAN” is not common.  
A valid common word is “TORSA” but S is banned.  
Another is “FORGE” but E is banned.  
A valid common word is “PORCH” but H is allowed and P is allowed, but we need A in position 5.  
Wait, the pattern is _ O R _ A, so let’s list possible words:

- F O R _ A → FORGA, FORMA, FORNA, FORCA (but C is banned).  
  FORGA and FORMA are not common.  
- T O R _ A → TORPA, TORNA, TORA? (but needs 5 letters).

- N O R _ A → NORA? (needs 5 letters, “NORAD” but D is banned).  
- P O R _ A → PORCA (C banned), PORA? (needs 5 letters).  

Actually, let’s think differently: the word must be _ O R _ A with R in position 3.  
A valid common word is “TORAL” but L is allowed and T is allowed.  
“T O R A L” fits: T, O, R, A, L.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that will give us the most information possible. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. This helps eliminate or confirm many letters at once.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

A word like ""AROSE"" contains 5 of these common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This gives us a good starting point to gather information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Another good option could be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems like a strong first guess to maximize information gain.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word contains the letters A, R, O somewhere, but not in their previous positions (1, 2, 3 respectively), and does NOT contain S or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, R, O.
2. A is not in position 1.
3. R is not in position 2.
4. O is not in position 3.
5. Does not contain S or E.

Possible positions for A: 2,3,4,5  
Possible positions for R: 1,3,4,5  
Possible positions for O: 1,2,4,5  

Let’s try to place them differently. A good candidate is “RADIO”:
- R in position 1 (allowed, since R was not in position 2).
- A in position 2 (allowed, since A was not in position 1).
- D (new letter, but allowed).
- I (new letter, but allowed).
- O in position 5 (allowed, since O was not in position 3).

This satisfies all constraints and introduces two new letters (D, I) that could help narrow down the remaining letters.

   ⇒ D and I are not in the word.  
   ⇒ O is not in position 5 (confirms it’s not in position 3 either).

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: A, R, O.  
- Letters NOT in the word: S, E, D, I.  
- Possible positions:
  – A: 3, 4, 5 (cannot be 1 or 2).  
  – R: 3, 4, 5 (cannot be 1 or 2).  
  – O: 1, 2, 4 (cannot be 3 or 5).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, R, O exactly once each.  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (so no S, E, D, I).  
- Places A, R, O in allowed positions.

Remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, B, G, H, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.

- F O R M A → FORMA (not common)
- G O R A L → GORAL (valid, less common)
- H O R S A → HORSA (S banned)
- M O R A L → MORAL (valid, common)

Check MORAL:

  M and L: L was banned in TORAL, so L is out.  
  GORAL: G, O, R, A, L → L is banned.  
  FORMA: F, O, R, M, A → M is allowed, F is allowed.

FORMA is not a common word, but FORGA is also not common.

“M O R A L” is valid but L is banned.  
“P O R K A” is not a word.  
“H O R N A” is not a word.

The only remaining valid word seems to be FORGA, but it’s not common.  
However, FORGA is listed in some dictionaries as a variant of FORGE.  
But let’s think of another: “F O R G A” is the only possible.

But wait, let’s check “FORGA”:
- F, O, R, G, A.  
  F, G are allowed.

  This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess should be FORGA.

But let me double-check:
- O is in position 2 (✓).  
- R is in position 3 (✓).  
- A is in position 5 (✓).  
- F and G are allowed (not banned).  
- No banned letters are used.

Thus, FORGA is the correct next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that will give us the most information possible. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. This helps eliminate or confirm many letters at once.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

A word like ""AROSE"" contains 5 of these common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This gives us a good starting point to gather information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Another good option could be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems like a strong first guess to maximize information gain.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word contains the letters A, R, O somewhere, but not in their previous positions (1, 2, 3 respectively), and does NOT contain S or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, R, O.
2. A is not in position 1.
3. R is not in position 2.
4. O is not in position 3.
5. Does not contain S or E.

Possible positions for A: 2,3,4,5  
Possible positions for R: 1,3,4,5  
Possible positions for O: 1,2,4,5  

Let’s try to place them differently. A good candidate is “RADIO”:
- R in position 1 (allowed, since R was not in position 2).
- A in position 2 (allowed, since A was not in position 1).
- D (new letter, but allowed).
- I (new letter, but allowed).
- O in position 5 (allowed, since O was not in position 3).

This satisfies all constraints and introduces two new letters (D, I) that could help narrow down the remaining letters.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ A, R, O are all in the word, but not in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively.  
   ⇒ S and E are not in the word.

2. RADIO → R(-) A(-) D(x) I(x) O(-)  
   ⇒ R is not in position 1 (confirms it’s not in position 2 either).  
   ⇒ A is not in position 2 (confirms it’s not in position 1 either).  
   ⇒ D and I are not in the word.  
   ⇒ O is not in position 5 (confirms it’s not in position 3 either).

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: A, R, O.  
- Letters NOT in the word: S, E, D, I.  
- Possible positions:
  – A: 3, 4, 5 (cannot be 1 or 2).  
  – R: 3, 4, 5 (cannot be 1 or 2).  
  – O: 1, 2, 4 (cannot be 3 or 5).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, R, O exactly once each.  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (so no S, E, D, I).  
- Places A, R, O in allowed positions.

Remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, B, G, H, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Let’s try “COBRA”:
- C, B are new letters (allowed).  
- Positions: C(1), O(2), B(3), R(4), A(5).  
  – A is in position 5 (allowed).  
  – R is in position 4 (allowed).  
  – O is in position 2 (allowed).  
- Contains all required letters A, R, O.

   ⇒ R is not in position 4 (but we already know it’s not in 1, 2, 4).  
   ⇒ A is in position 5 (✓).

So far we have:
- Word must contain: O in position 2, A in position 5, and R somewhere.  
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4 (from feedback).  
  The only remaining spot for R is position 3.  
- Letters already ruled out: S, E, D, I, C, B.  
- We still need two more letters for positions 1 and 4, chosen from the remaining alphabet (avoiding the banned letters).

Common remaining consonants: T, N, L, G, H, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Let’s try to find a word that fits:
- Pattern: _ O R _ A  
- First and fourth letters must be from allowed set.

A good candidate is “GORAL” but L is allowed and G is allowed, but “GORAL” is not a common word.  
Another is “TORAN” but N is allowed and T is allowed, but “TORAN” is not common.  
A valid common word is “TORSA” but S is banned.  
Another is “FORGE” but E is banned.  
A valid common word is “PORCH” but H is allowed and P is allowed, but we need A in position 5.  
Wait, the pattern is _ O R _ A, so let’s list possible words:

- F O R _ A → FORGA, FORMA, FORNA, FORCA (but C is banned).  
  FORGA and FORMA are not common.  
- T O R _ A → TORPA, TORNA, TORA? (but needs 5 letters).  
  “TORNA” is not a common word.  
- M O R _ A → MORQA, MORPA, MORA? (needs 5 letters).  
- H O R _ A → HORLA, HORPA, HORSA (S banned).  
- G O R _ A → GORAL (valid but less common).  
- N O R _ A → NORA? (needs 5 letters, “NORAD” but D is banned).  
- P O R _ A → PORCA (C banned), PORA? (needs 5 letters).  

Actually, let’s think differently: the word must be _ O R _ A with R in position 3.  
A valid common word is “TORAL” but L is allowed and T is allowed.  
“T O R A L” fits: T, O, R, A, L.  
Check letters: T, O, R, A, L.  
- T: allowed.  
- O: in position 2 (✓).  
- R: in position 3 (allowed).  
- A: in position 5 (✓).  
- L: allowed (not banned).  

“TORAL” is a valid 5-letter word meaning relating to the cortex of the brain or relating to the torus.

“M O R A L” is valid but L is banned.  
“P O R K A” is not a word.  
“H O R N A” is not a word.

The only remaining valid word seems to be FORGA, but it’s not common.  
However, FORGA is listed in some dictionaries as a variant of FORGE.  
But let’s think of another: “F O R G A” is the only possible.

But wait, let’s check “FORGA”:
- F, O, R, G, A.  
  F, G are allowed.  
  Pattern: F(1) O(2) R(3) G(4) A(5).  
  This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess should be FORGA.

But let me double-check:
- O is in position 2 (✓).  
- R is in position 3 (✓).  
- A is in position 5 (✓).  
- F and G are allowed (not banned).  
- No banned letters are used.

Thus, FORGA is the correct next guess.
