For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the word.

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
   - A is locked in position 1.
   - O and S are somewhere in the word but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
   - R and E are not in the word.

2. AUDIO → A(✓) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(-)
   - A is still correct in position 1.
   - U, D, I are not in the word.
   - O is in the word but not in position 5 (and we already knew it wasn’t in 3 or 4).

So far:
- Letters known to be in the word: A (position 1), O, S.
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, E, U, D, I.

Possible positions for O and S:
- O can only be in positions 2 or 4 (since it can’t be 3, 4, or 5).
- S can be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (since it can’t be 4).

Let’s list possible placements:

Case 1: O in position 2
   - A O _ _ _
   - S must go in 3 or 5.
   - If S in 3: A O S _ _
   - If S in 5: A O _ _ S

Case 2: O in position 4
   - A _ _ O _
   - S must go in 2, 3, or 5.
   - If S in 2: A S _ O _
   - If S in 3: A _ S O _
   - If S in 5: A _ _ O S

Now we need to pick a word that fits one of these patterns and uses only letters not yet ruled out. Good candidate letters to test next are common ones like T, N, L, C, M, Y, etc.

Looking at Case 1: A O S _ _
The only common word that fits is AOS_ _ — but no valid 5-letter words start with AOS.

Looking at Case 2: A _ _ O S
Possible words: A _ _ O S. The most common would be A L O S? No. A M O S? ""AMOS"" is a valid word (a biblical figure).

Let’s check ""AMOS"":
- A (✓) position 1 — correct.
- M — new letter, not yet tested.
- O — in position 3 (allowed, since O can be 2 or 4).
- S — in position 5 (allowed, since S can be 2,3,5).
- O is repeated, but that’s fine.

This seems like a solid next guess to test M and confirm positions for O and S.

The feedback for Guess 3 (""AMOS"") says: ""Model answer is not five letters.""  
That must mean the system is expecting a different format or the word ""AMOS"" was rejected for some reason (e.g., it’s not in the allowed word list).  

Since we can’t use ""AMOS"", we need to try another word that:
- Starts with A,
- Contains O and S,
- Doesn’t use R, E, U, D, I,
- And avoids the position constraints that failed for ""AMOS"".

From earlier:
- O must be in position 2 or 4.
- S must be in position 2, 3, or 5 (and not 4).

Let’s look at Case 2 again but pick a valid word:
- A _ _ O S (O in 4, S in 5) → ""AFOGS"" – invalid.
- A S _ O _ (O in 4, S in 2) → ""ASGO_"" – invalid.
- A _ S O _ (O in 4, S in 3) → ""ABSO_"" – ""ABSORB"" is 6 letters.
- A _ _ O S → ""ACORN"" – but R is forbidden.
- ""ACOSS"" – double S, but S is allowed.

Actually, ""ACORN"" is invalid (R).  
Let’s try ""ACOSS"":
- A (✓) position 1,
- C – new letter,
- O – position 2 (allowed),
- S – position 3 (allowed),
- S – position 4 (but S can’t be in 4, since original S was in 4 and marked wrong position).

So ""ACOSS"" has S in 3 and 4 – but 4 is invalid.  
Next idea: ""ALOES"" – but E is forbidden.  
""ALOUD"" – U and D forbidden.  
""ANSON"" – N is allowed, but S is in 4 (invalid).  
""ANTOS"" – T and N allowed, S in 5 (allowed), O in 3 (invalid).  
""APPOS"" – P allowed, O in 3 (invalid).  
""ASONS"" – O in 3 (invalid).  
""ASTON"" – O in 3 (invalid).  
""ATONS"" – same issue.

- A O _ _ _
- S must be 3 or 5.
- A O S _ _ → ""AOS_ _"" – no valid word.
- A O _ _ S → ""AOGAS"" – invalid.

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words starting with A, containing O and S, avoiding forbidden letters (R,E,U,D,I) and positions:

Allowed letters: A (fixed at 1), O, S, plus B,C,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,N,P,Q,T,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Possible patterns:
1. A O _ _ S
   - A O B L S – ""AOBLS"" – invalid.
   - A O K S – too short.
   - Actually, no common words fit A O _ _ S.

2. A _ O _ S
   - A C O N S – ""ACONS"" – not a word.
   - A M O N S – ""AMONS"" – not standard.

3. A _ _ O S
   - A C T O S – ""ACTOS"" – valid (a drug name).

     - O – position 4 (allowed)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word and in the correct first position (✓).
- R is NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- E is NOT in the word (x).

So far we know:
1. First letter is A.
2. The word contains O and S, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
3. The word does NOT contain R or E.

Possible positions for O and S:
- O could be in positions 2, 4, or 5.
- S could be in positions 2, 3, or 5.

We also know the remaining letters (positions 2, 3, 4, 5) must be from the remaining alphabet excluding R and E.

A good next guess would introduce new common letters while respecting the known constraints. Let's try a word like ""AUDIO"":
- A is already confirmed in position 1.
- U is a common vowel not yet tested.
- D is a common consonant not yet tested.
- I is another common vowel not yet tested.
- T is another common consonant not yet tested.

This should help us gather more information about which of these new letters are present and their positions.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
   - A is locked in position 1.
   - O and S are somewhere in the word but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
   - R and E are not in the word.

2. AUDIO → A(✓) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(-)
   - A is still correct in position 1.
   - U, D, I are not in the word.
   - O is in the word but not in position 5 (and we already knew it wasn’t in 3 or 4).

So far:
- Letters known to be in the word: A (position 1), O, S.
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, E, U, D, I.

Possible positions for O and S:
- O can only be in positions 2 or 4 (since it can’t be 3, 4, or 5).
- S can be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (since it can’t be 4).

Let’s list possible placements:

Case 1: O in position 2
   - A O _ _ _
   - S must go in 3 or 5.
   - If S in 3: A O S _ _
   - If S in 5: A O _ _ S

Case 2: O in position 4
   - A _ _ O _
   - S must go in 2, 3, or 5.
   - If S in 2: A S _ O _
   - If S in 3: A _ S O _
   - If S in 5: A _ _ O S

Now we need to pick a word that fits one of these patterns and uses only letters not yet ruled out. Good candidate letters to test next are common ones like T, N, L, C, M, Y, etc.

Looking at Case 1: A O S _ _
The only common word that fits is AOS_ _ — but no valid 5-letter words start with AOS.

Looking at Case 2: A _ _ O S
Possible words: A _ _ O S. The most common would be A L O S? No. A M O S? ""AMOS"" is a valid word (a biblical figure).

Let’s check ""AMOS"":
- A (✓) position 1 — correct.
- M — new letter, not yet tested.
- O — in position 3 (allowed, since O can be 2 or 4).
- S — in position 5 (allowed, since S can be 2,3,5).
- O is repeated, but that’s fine.

This seems like a solid next guess to test M and confirm positions for O and S.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word and in the correct first position (✓).
- R is NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- E is NOT in the word (x).

So far we know:
1. First letter is A.
2. The word contains O and S, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
3. The word does NOT contain R or E.

Possible positions for O and S:
- O could be in positions 2, 4, or 5.
- S could be in positions 2, 3, or 5.

We also know the remaining letters (positions 2, 3, 4, 5) must be from the remaining alphabet excluding R and E.

A good next guess would introduce new common letters while respecting the known constraints. Let's try a word like ""AUDIO"":
- A is already confirmed in position 1.
- U is a common vowel not yet tested.
- D is a common consonant not yet tested.
- I is another common vowel not yet tested.
- T is another common consonant not yet tested.

This should help us gather more information about which of these new letters are present and their positions.

Guess 2: AUDIO -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
   - A is locked in position 1.
   - O and S are somewhere in the word but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
   - R and E are not in the word.

2. AUDIO → A(✓) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(-)
   - A is still correct in position 1.
   - U, D, I are not in the word.
   - O is in the word but not in position 5 (and we already knew it wasn’t in 3 or 4).

So far:
- Letters known to be in the word: A (position 1), O, S.
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, E, U, D, I.

Possible positions for O and S:
- O can only be in positions 2 or 4 (since it can’t be 3, 4, or 5).
- S can be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (since it can’t be 4).

Let’s list possible placements:

Case 1: O in position 2
   - A O _ _ _
   - S must go in 3 or 5.
   - If S in 3: A O S _ _
   - If S in 5: A O _ _ S

Case 2: O in position 4
   - A _ _ O _
   - S must go in 2, 3, or 5.
   - If S in 2: A S _ O _
   - If S in 3: A _ S O _
   - If S in 5: A _ _ O S

Now we need to pick a word that fits one of these patterns and uses only letters not yet ruled out. Good candidate letters to test next are common ones like T, N, L, C, M, Y, etc.

Looking at Case 1: A O S _ _
The only common word that fits is AOS_ _ — but no valid 5-letter words start with AOS.

Looking at Case 2: A _ _ O S
Possible words: A _ _ O S. The most common would be A L O S? No. A M O S? ""AMOS"" is a valid word (a biblical figure).

Let’s check ""AMOS"":
- A (✓) position 1 — correct.
- M — new letter, not yet tested.
- O — in position 3 (allowed, since O can be 2 or 4).
- S — in position 5 (allowed, since S can be 2,3,5).
- O is repeated, but that’s fine.

This seems like a solid next guess to test M and confirm positions for O and S.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: AUDIO -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(-)
Guess 3: AMOS -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The feedback for Guess 3 (""AMOS"") says: ""Model answer is not five letters.""  
That must mean the system is expecting a different format or the word ""AMOS"" was rejected for some reason (e.g., it’s not in the allowed word list).  

Since we can’t use ""AMOS"", we need to try another word that:
- Starts with A,
- Contains O and S,
- Doesn’t use R, E, U, D, I,
- And avoids the position constraints that failed for ""AMOS"".

From earlier:
- O must be in position 2 or 4.
- S must be in position 2, 3, or 5 (and not 4).

Let’s look at Case 2 again but pick a valid word:
- A _ _ O S (O in 4, S in 5) → ""AFOGS"" – invalid.
- A S _ O _ (O in 4, S in 2) → ""ASGO_"" – invalid.
- A _ S O _ (O in 4, S in 3) → ""ABSO_"" – ""ABSORB"" is 6 letters.
- A _ _ O S → ""ACORN"" – but R is forbidden.
- ""ACOSS"" – double S, but S is allowed.

Actually, ""ACORN"" is invalid (R).  
Let’s try ""ACOSS"":
- A (✓) position 1,
- C – new letter,
- O – position 2 (allowed),
- S – position 3 (allowed),
- S – position 4 (but S can’t be in 4, since original S was in 4 and marked wrong position).

So ""ACOSS"" has S in 3 and 4 – but 4 is invalid.  
Next idea: ""ALOES"" – but E is forbidden.  
""ALOUD"" – U and D forbidden.  
""ANSON"" – N is allowed, but S is in 4 (invalid).  
""ANTOS"" – T and N allowed, S in 5 (allowed), O in 3 (invalid).  
""APPOS"" – P allowed, O in 3 (invalid).  
""ASONS"" – O in 3 (invalid).  
""ASTON"" – O in 3 (invalid).  
""ATONS"" – same issue.

Let’s try O in position 2:
- A O _ _ _
- S must be 3 or 5.
- A O S _ _ → ""AOS_ _"" – no valid word.
- A O _ _ S → ""AOGAS"" – invalid.

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words starting with A, containing O and S, avoiding forbidden letters (R,E,U,D,I) and positions:
Forbidden letters: R,E,U,D,I
Allowed letters: A (fixed at 1), O, S, plus B,C,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,N,P,Q,T,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Possible patterns:
1. A O _ _ S
   - A O B L S – ""AOBLS"" – invalid.
   - A O K S – too short.
   - Actually, no common words fit A O _ _ S.

2. A _ O _ S
   - A C O N S – ""ACONS"" – not a word.
   - A M O N S – ""AMONS"" – not standard.
   - A L O N S – ""ALONS"" – not standard.

3. A _ _ O S
   - A C T O S – ""ACTOS"" – valid (a drug name).
   - A B O O S – invalid (double O, but O is allowed).
   - ""ACTOS"" uses:
     - A (✓) 1
     - C – new
     - T – new
     - O – position 4 (allowed)
     - S – position 5 (allowed)
   - No forbidden letters.

""ACTOS"" seems valid and fits all constraints.

The feedback from AXONS is:
A(✓) X(x) O(-) N(x) S(✓)

Interpretation:
- A is correct in position 1 (already known).
- S is correct in position 5 (already known).
- O is in the word but not in position 3 (already knew it couldn’t be 3, 4, or 5 from earlier guesses).
- X and N are not in the word.

So the confirmed structure is:
A _ _ _ S
with O somewhere in position 2 or 3 (since it can’t be 4 or 5, and 1 is A).

Letters still allowed: all except R, E, U, D, I, C, T, X, N.
