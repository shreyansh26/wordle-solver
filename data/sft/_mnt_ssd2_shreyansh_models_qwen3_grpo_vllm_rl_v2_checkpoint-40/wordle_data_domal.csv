### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these letters to test multiple possibilities.

Some popular and effective starting words are:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- ADIEU
- AUDIO
- STARE

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of letters to work with for the next steps based on the feedback.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word contains L and A, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain S, T, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains L and A
- Does NOT contain S, T, or E
- Has L not in position 2
- Has A not in position 3

Possible positions for L: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but not 2)
Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5 (but not 3)

Let’s try a word that moves L and A to new positions while avoiding the forbidden letters. A good candidate is ""FLANK"":
- F: new letter to test
- L: moved to position 2 (originally position 2 was wrong, so position 2 is still wrong for L - need to avoid)
Wait, in SLATE, L was position 2 (wrong), so in FLANK, L is position 2 again - that’s bad.

Let’s try ""PLANK"":
- P: new letter
- L: position 2 - again same problem.

Let’s try ""CLAMP"":
- C: new letter

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: S, T, E, B, U  
Letters that ARE in the word, but whose positions are still unknown: L, A, M

Positions ruled out so far:
- L cannot be in positions 2 (from SLATE) or 2 (from ALBUM)  
- A cannot be in positions 3 (from SLATE) or 1 (from ALBUM)  
- M cannot be in position 5 (from ALBUM)

So the remaining possible positions are:
L: 1, 3, 4, 5  
A: 2, 4, 5  
M: 1, 2, 3, 4  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- contains L, A, M exactly once each  
- avoids S, T, E, B, U  
- respects the positional bans above  
- uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Good candidate letters to fill the remaining two slots are among: C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, O, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s look for a word that satisfies:
- L, A, M all present  
- no banned letters  
- positions consistent with bans.

One such word is “CLAIM”:
C (new, allowed), L (allowed positions 1,3,4,5 – here 2, but 2 is banned for L) – so L cannot be in position 2, thus “CLAIM” is invalid.

Another: “FLAM” + one more letter – but we need 5 letters.

Another: “PLAGM” – invalid.

Another: “CLAMP” – contains B (no), and P is allowed, but M is in position 5 which is banned.

Another: “FLANK” – contains N and K, but A is in position 3 which is banned.

Another: “GLAND” – A in position 3 banned.

Another: “CLARY” – contains R and Y, but A in position 3 banned.

Another: “PLAZA” – A in position 3 banned.

Another: “MALIC” – contains C, but A in position 1 banned.

Another: “LAMPS” – contains S banned.

Another: “MALFY” – contains F, Y; check positions:
M (position 1 – allowed), A (position 2 – allowed), L (position 3 – allowed), F (new), Y (new).  
No banned letters, and all positional bans respected.

Therefore “MALFY” is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these letters to test multiple possibilities.

Some popular and effective starting words are:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- ADIEU
- AUDIO
- STARE

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of letters to work with for the next steps based on the feedback.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word contains L and A, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain S, T, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains L and A
- Does NOT contain S, T, or E
- Has L not in position 2
- Has A not in position 3

Possible positions for L: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but not 2)
Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5 (but not 3)

Let’s try a word that moves L and A to new positions while avoiding the forbidden letters. A good candidate is ""FLANK"":
- F: new letter to test
- L: moved to position 2 (originally position 2 was wrong, so position 2 is still wrong for L - need to avoid)
Wait, in SLATE, L was position 2 (wrong), so in FLANK, L is position 2 again - that’s bad.

Let’s try ""PLANK"":
- P: new letter
- L: position 2 - again same problem.

Let’s try ""CLAMP"":
- C: new letter
- L: position 2 - again same problem.

Let’s try ""CLANG"":
- C: new letter
- L: position 2 - again same problem.

Let’s try ""BLANK"":
- B: new letter
- L: position 2 - again same problem.

Let’s try ""GLAND"":
- G: new letter
- L: position 2 - again same problem.

Let’s try ""PLAZA"":
- P: new letter
- L: position 2 - again same problem.

Let’s try ""CLARY"":
- C: new letter
- L: position 2 - again same problem.

Let’s try ""ALARM"":
- A: position 1 (was position 3, so allowed)
- L: position 2 (was position 2, so not allowed - same position)

Let’s try ""ALOUD"":
- A: position 1 (allowed)
- L: position 2 (not allowed - same as SLATE)

Let’s try ""ADULT"":
- A: position 1 (allowed)
- L: position 3 (allowed - wasn't in position 3 in SLATE)
- U: new letter
- D: new letter
- T: but T is forbidden (from SLATE feedback)

Let’s try ""ALBUM"":
- A: position 1 (allowed)
- L: position 3 (allowed)
- B: new letter
- U: new letter
- M: new letter

This seems good - it moves A to position 1 and L to position 3, avoids S, T, E, and introduces new letters to test.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: ALBUM -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(-) B(x) U(x) M(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: S, T, E, B, U  
Letters that ARE in the word, but whose positions are still unknown: L, A, M

Positions ruled out so far:
- L cannot be in positions 2 (from SLATE) or 2 (from ALBUM)  
- A cannot be in positions 3 (from SLATE) or 1 (from ALBUM)  
- M cannot be in position 5 (from ALBUM)

So the remaining possible positions are:
L: 1, 3, 4, 5  
A: 2, 4, 5  
M: 1, 2, 3, 4  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- contains L, A, M exactly once each  
- avoids S, T, E, B, U  
- respects the positional bans above  
- uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Good candidate letters to fill the remaining two slots are among: C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, O, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s look for a word that satisfies:
- L, A, M all present  
- no banned letters  
- positions consistent with bans.

One such word is “CLAIM”:
C (new, allowed), L (allowed positions 1,3,4,5 – here 2, but 2 is banned for L) – so L cannot be in position 2, thus “CLAIM” is invalid.

Another: “FLAM” + one more letter – but we need 5 letters.

Another: “PLAGM” – invalid.

Another: “CLAMP” – contains B (no), and P is allowed, but M is in position 5 which is banned.

Another: “FLANK” – contains N and K, but A is in position 3 which is banned.

Another: “GLAND” – A in position 3 banned.

Another: “CLARY” – contains R and Y, but A in position 3 banned.

Another: “PLAZA” – A in position 3 banned.

Another: “MALIC” – contains C, but A in position 1 banned.

Another: “LAMPS” – contains S banned.

Another: “MALFY” – contains F, Y; check positions:
M (position 1 – allowed), A (position 2 – allowed), L (position 3 – allowed), F (new), Y (new).  
No banned letters, and all positional bans respected.

Therefore “MALFY” is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these letters to test multiple possibilities.

Some popular and effective starting words are:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- ADIEU
- AUDIO
- STARE

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of letters to work with for the next steps based on the feedback.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word contains L and A, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain S, T, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains L and A
- Does NOT contain S, T, or E
- Has L not in position 2
- Has A not in position 3

Possible positions for L: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but not 2)
Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5 (but not 3)

Let’s try a word that moves L and A to new positions while avoiding the forbidden letters. A good candidate is ""FLANK"":
- F: new letter to test
- L: moved to position 2 (originally position 2 was wrong, so position 2 is still wrong for L - need to avoid)
Wait, in SLATE, L was position 2 (wrong), so in FLANK, L is position 2 again - that’s bad.

Let’s try ""PLANK"":
- P: new letter
- L: position 2 - again same problem.

Let’s try ""CLAMP"":
- C: new letter
- L: position 2 - again same problem.

Let’s try ""CLANG"":
- C: new letter
- L: position 2 - again same problem.

Let’s try ""BLANK"":
- B: new letter
- L: position 2 - again same problem.

Let’s try ""GLAND"":
- G: new letter
- L: position 2 - again same problem.

Let’s try ""PLAZA"":
- P: new letter
- L: position 2 - again same problem.

Let’s try ""CLARY"":
- C: new letter
- L: position 2 - again same problem.

Let’s try ""ALARM"":
- A: position 1 (was position 3, so allowed)
- L: position 2 (was position 2, so not allowed - same position)

Let’s try ""ALOUD"":
- A: position 1 (allowed)
- L: position 2 (not allowed - same as SLATE)

Let’s try ""ADULT"":
- A: position 1 (allowed)
- L: position 3 (allowed - wasn't in position 3 in SLATE)
- U: new letter
- D: new letter
- T: but T is forbidden (from SLATE feedback)

Let’s try ""ALBUM"":
- A: position 1 (allowed)
- L: position 3 (allowed)
- B: new letter
- U: new letter
- M: new letter

This seems good - it moves A to position 1 and L to position 3, avoids S, T, E, and introduces new letters to test.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ALBUM -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(-) B(x) U(x) M(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: S, T, E, B, U  
Letters that ARE in the word, but whose positions are still unknown: L, A, M

Positions ruled out so far:
- L cannot be in positions 2 (from SLATE) or 2 (from ALBUM)  
- A cannot be in positions 3 (from SLATE) or 1 (from ALBUM)  
- M cannot be in position 5 (from ALBUM)

So the remaining possible positions are:
L: 1, 3, 4, 5  
A: 2, 4, 5  
M: 1, 2, 3, 4  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- contains L, A, M exactly once each  
- avoids S, T, E, B, U  
- respects the positional bans above  
- uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Good candidate letters to fill the remaining two slots are among: C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, O, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s look for a word that satisfies:
- L, A, M all present  
- no banned letters  
- positions consistent with bans.

One such word is “CLAIM”:
C (new, allowed), L (allowed positions 1,3,4,5 – here 2, but 2 is banned for L) – so L cannot be in position 2, thus “CLAIM” is invalid.

Another: “FLAM” + one more letter – but we need 5 letters.

Another: “PLAGM” – invalid.

Another: “CLAMP” – contains B (no), and P is allowed, but M is in position 5 which is banned.

Another: “FLANK” – contains N and K, but A is in position 3 which is banned.

Another: “GLAND” – A in position 3 banned.

Another: “CLARY” – contains R and Y, but A in position 3 banned.

Another: “PLAZA” – A in position 3 banned.

Another: “MALIC” – contains C, but A in position 1 banned.

Another: “LAMPS” – contains S banned.

Another: “MALFY” – contains F, Y; check positions:
M (position 1 – allowed), A (position 2 – allowed), L (position 3 – allowed), F (new), Y (new).  
No banned letters, and all positional bans respected.

Therefore “MALFY” is a valid next guess.

From the three rounds of feedback we have:

Letters that are NOT in the word: S, T, E, B, U, F, Y  
Letters that ARE in the word: L, A, M (each must appear exactly once)

Positions ruled out so far:
- L: cannot be in positions 2 (SLATE), 2 (ALBUM), 3 (MALFY)  
- A: cannot be in positions 3 (SLATE), 1 (ALBUM), 2 (MALFY)  
- M: cannot be in positions 5 (ALBUM), 1 (MALFY)

So the remaining possible positions are:
L: 1, 4, 5  
A: 4, 5  
M: 2, 3, 4  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- contains L, A, M exactly once each  
- uses only letters not yet eliminated (so from the remaining alphabet: C, D, G, H, I, J, K, N, O, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Z)  
- respects the positional bans above.

Let’s look for a word that satisfies:
- L in 1, 4, or 5  
- A in 4 or 5  
- M in 2, 3, or 4  

A quick scan of possibilities gives “CLAIM”:
C (allowed), L (position 2 – banned), so invalid.

“PLAGM” – invalid (5 letters, but not a word).

“GLAND” – A in position 3 (banned).

“CLAMP” – M in position 5 (banned).

“MALIC” – C at end, but A in position 2 (banned).

“LAMPS” – S banned.

“MALIC” already checked.

“PLANK” – A in position 3 (banned).

“CLANK” – A in position 3 (banned).

“PLAZA” – Z and A in position 4 (allowed), but A in position 3 (banned).

“MALIC” – same issue.

“MALTY” – Y banned.

“MALIC” – same.

Let’s try “CLAMP” again – M in position 5 is banned.

“PLAGM” – not a word.

“GLAM” + one letter – “GLAM” is 4 letters.

“CLAM” + one letter – “CLAM” is 4 letters.

“PLAM” + one letter – “PLAM” is 4 letters.

“CLANK” – A in position 3 banned.

“PLANK” – same.

“CLASH” – S banned.

“CLAMP” – same.

“CLANG” – G at end, A in position 3 banned.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these letters to test multiple possibilities.

Some popular and effective starting words are:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- ADIEU
- AUDIO
- STARE

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of letters to work with for the next steps based on the feedback.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word contains L and A, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain S, T, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains L and A
- Does NOT contain S, T, or E
- Has L not in position 2
- Has A not in position 3

Possible positions for L: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but not 2)
Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5 (but not 3)

Let’s try a word that moves L and A to new positions while avoiding the forbidden letters. A good candidate is ""FLANK"":
- F: new letter to test
- L: moved to position 2 (originally position 2 was wrong, so position 2 is still wrong for L - need to avoid)
Wait, in SLATE, L was position 2 (wrong), so in FLANK, L is position 2 again - that’s bad.

Let’s try ""PLANK"":
- P: new letter
- L: position 2 - again same problem.

Let’s try ""CLAMP"":
- C: new letter
- L: position 2 - again same problem.

Let’s try ""CLANG"":
- C: new letter
- L: position 2 - again same problem.

Let’s try ""BLANK"":
- B: new letter
- L: position 2 - again same problem.

Let’s try ""GLAND"":
- G: new letter
- L: position 2 - again same problem.

Let’s try ""PLAZA"":
- P: new letter
- L: position 2 - again same problem.

Let’s try ""CLARY"":
- C: new letter
- L: position 2 - again same problem.

Let’s try ""ALARM"":
- A: position 1 (was position 3, so allowed)
- L: position 2 (was position 2, so not allowed - same position)

Let’s try ""ALOUD"":
- A: position 1 (allowed)
- L: position 2 (not allowed - same as SLATE)

Let’s try ""ADULT"":
- A: position 1 (allowed)
- L: position 3 (allowed - wasn't in position 3 in SLATE)
- U: new letter
- D: new letter
- T: but T is forbidden (from SLATE feedback)

Let’s try ""ALBUM"":
- A: position 1 (allowed)
- L: position 3 (allowed)
- B: new letter
- U: new letter
- M: new letter

This seems good - it moves A to position 1 and L to position 3, avoids S, T, E, and introduces new letters to test.

<guess>ALBUM</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ALBUM -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(-) B(x) U(x) M(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: S, T, E, B, U  
Letters that ARE in the word, but whose positions are still unknown: L, A, M

Positions ruled out so far:
- L cannot be in positions 2 (from SLATE) or 2 (from ALBUM)  
- A cannot be in positions 3 (from SLATE) or 1 (from ALBUM)  
- M cannot be in position 5 (from ALBUM)

So the remaining possible positions are:
L: 1, 3, 4, 5  
A: 2, 4, 5  
M: 1, 2, 3, 4  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- contains L, A, M exactly once each  
- avoids S, T, E, B, U  
- respects the positional bans above  
- uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Good candidate letters to fill the remaining two slots are among: C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, O, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s look for a word that satisfies:
- L, A, M all present  
- no banned letters  
- positions consistent with bans.

One such word is “CLAIM”:
C (new, allowed), L (allowed positions 1,3,4,5 – here 2, but 2 is banned for L) – so L cannot be in position 2, thus “CLAIM” is invalid.

Another: “FLAM” + one more letter – but we need 5 letters.

Another: “PLAGM” – invalid.

Another: “CLAMP” – contains B (no), and P is allowed, but M is in position 5 which is banned.

Another: “FLANK” – contains N and K, but A is in position 3 which is banned.

Another: “GLAND” – A in position 3 banned.

Another: “CLARY” – contains R and Y, but A in position 3 banned.

Another: “PLAZA” – A in position 3 banned.

Another: “MALIC” – contains C, but A in position 1 banned.

Another: “LAMPS” – contains S banned.

Another: “MALFY” – contains F, Y; check positions:
M (position 1 – allowed), A (position 2 – allowed), L (position 3 – allowed), F (new), Y (new).  
No banned letters, and all positional bans respected.

Therefore “MALFY” is a valid next guess.

From all feedback so far:

Known letters in the word: L, A, M  
Known letters NOT in the word: S, T, E, B, U, F, Y  

Positional exclusions:
- L cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from SLATE and ALBUM/MALFY)  
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (from ALBUM and MALFY)  
- M cannot be in positions 5 (from ALBUM) or 1 (from MALFY)  

So:
L: allowed in 1, 4, 5  
A: allowed in 2, 4, 5  
M: allowed in 2, 3, 4  

We need a 5-letter word that contains L, A, M exactly once each, avoids all banned letters, and respects the positional bans.

Candidate letters to fill the remaining two slots: C, D, G, H, I, K, N, O, P, R, V, W, X, Z.

Let’s look for a valid arrangement:

Try placing L in position 4:
- _ _ _ L _
  - A must be in 2 or 5
  - M must be in 2, 3, or 4 (but 4 is taken by L, so 2 or 3)

Option 1: A in 2, M in 3 → _ A M L _
  Need two new letters for positions 1 and 5, avoiding banned set.
  Example: C A M L D → “CAMLD” – invalid (not a word).
  Example: D A M L K → “DAMLK” – invalid.

Option 2: A in 5, M in 2 → _ M _ L A
  Example: C M I L A – “C MILA” – invalid.
  Example: R M I L A – “R M I L A” – invalid.

Try placing L in position 5:
- _ _ _ _ L
  - A must be in 2, 4
  - M must be in 2, 3, 4

Option 1: A in 2, M in 3 → _ M A _ L
  Example: C M A R L – “CMARL” – invalid.
  Example: D M A R L – “DMARL” – invalid.

Option 2: A in 2, M in 4 → _ M A L
  Wait, L is in 5, so positions are _ M A _ L.
  Same as above.

Option 3: A in 4, M in 2 → _ M _ A L
  Example: C M I A L – “CMIAL” – invalid.
  Example: R M I A L – “RMIAL” – invalid.

Try placing L in position 1:
- L _ _ _ _
  - A must be in 2, 4, 5
  - M must be in 2, 3, 4

Option 1: A in 2, M in 3 → L A M _ _
  Example: L A M C H – “LAMCH” – invalid.
  Example: L A M D R – “LAMDR” – invalid.

Option 2: A in 4, M in 2 → L M _ A _
  Example: L M I N A – “LMINA” – invalid.
  Example: L M C H A – “LMCHA” – invalid.

Option 3: A in 5, M in 2 → L M _ _ A
  Example: L M I N A – “LMINA” – invalid.
  Example: L M C H A – “LMCHA” – invalid.

Try placing L in position 4 again but look for real words:
- _ _ _ L _
  - A must be 2 or 5
  - M must be 2 or 3

Real word check:
- “CLAIM” – has L in 2 (banned) and I in 4, but L is banned in 2 → invalid.
- “PLANK” – P, L in 2 (banned), A in 3 (banned), N, K → invalid.
- “FLANK” – F banned → invalid.
- “CLAMP” – M in 5 (banned) → invalid.
- “CLANG” – M not present → invalid.
- “GLAND” – A in 3 (banned) → invalid.
- “CLARY” – Y banned → invalid.
- “PLAZA” – Z, A in 3 (banned) → invalid.
- “MALIC” – C, but A in 1 (banned) → invalid.
- “LAMPS” – S banned → invalid.

Try “MURAL” – U banned → invalid.

Try “RALLY” – Y banned → invalid.

Try “MALIC” – already checked.

Try “LAMPS” – S banned.

Try “PLANK” – L in 2 banned.

Try “CLAMP” – M in 5 banned.

Try “GLAM” + one letter – need 5 letters.

Try “G L A M _” – but positions:
G (new), L (position 2 – banned) → invalid.

Try “P L A M _” – L in 2 banned.

Try “C L A M _” – L in 2 banned.

Try “L A M _ _” – L in 1 (allowed), A in 2 (allowed), M in 3 (allowed).
  Need two new letters for positions 4 and 5, avoiding banned set.
  Example: L A M C H – “LAMCH” – invalid.
  Example: L A M D R – “LAMDR” – invalid.

Try “L A M I N” – “LAMIN” – valid word (short for laminar).
  Check letters: L, A, M, I, N – all allowed.
  Positions:
  - L in 1 (allowed)
  - A in 2 (allowed)
  - M in 3 (allowed)
  - I and N are new and allowed.
