For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, T, etc. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a good starting guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many English words. This gives us maximum information about which letters might be in the secret word.

Another good option could be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers some of the most common vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

1. The word contains S but NOT in the 4th position.
2. The word does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S (but not in position 4).

Good vowels left: I, U.

Let me try to use common letters from the remaining set. A word like ""SUNNY"" would use S, U, N, N, Y. But N is common and Y might be less common. Alternatively, ""STUMP"" uses S, T, U, M, P. But P is less common. 

Another good option is ""SINGH"" but H is less common. ""SULKY"" uses S, U, L, K, Y.

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)

Key deductions so far:
1. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, L, K, Y.
2. Letter S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4.
3. Letter U is in the word and is in position 2.

So the pattern so far is: _ U _ _ _  
and the word must contain S somewhere in positions 3 or 5 (since 1 and 4 are ruled out).

Remaining consonants that are still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z  
Remaining vowels that are still possible: I (since U is already used and A, O, E are out).

Let’s look for a word that fits:
- Pattern: _ U S _ _  or  _ U _ _ S
- Uses only the still-allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- MUST: fits _ U S _ _, uses M, T (both allowed).
- PUSH: but H is allowed, but we already have U in position 2 and S in position 3.
- BUSH: B, U, S, H – all allowed, fits _ U S _ _.

""BUSH"" seems like a strong candidate because:
- B is a common starting letter.
- U is in position 2 (✓ from feedback).
- S is in position 3 (allowed, since S can’t be in 1 or 4).
- H is still allowed.
- It doesn’t contain any of the ruled-out letters.

Another candidate is ""MUST"":
- M, U, S, T – all allowed.
- Fits _ U S _ _.

Between ""BUSH"" and ""MUST"", ""MUST"" is slightly more common as a word, but both are valid. I’ll go with ""MUST"" as it’s a very common word and uses T which is a very common letter.

Pattern check: _ U S _ _ → M U S T ? – wait, ""MUST"" is only 4 letters. I need a 5-letter word.

Oops, ""MUST"" is 4 letters. Let me reconsider.

Valid 5-letter words fitting _ U S _ _:
- MUSTY – but Y is ruled out.
- BUSTY – Y ruled out.
- FUSED – E ruled out.
- GUSHY – Y ruled out.
- MUSTY – Y ruled out.

2. Letter S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4.
3. Letter U is in the word and is in position 2.

So the pattern so far is: _ U _ _ _  
and the word must contain S somewhere in positions 3 or 5 (since 1 and 4 are ruled out).

Remaining consonants that are still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z  
Remaining vowels that are still possible: I (since U is already used and A, O, E are out).

Let’s look for a word that fits:
- Pattern: _ U S _ _  or  _ U _ _ S
- Uses only the still-allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- MUST: fits _ U S _ _, uses M, T (both allowed).
- PUSH: but H is allowed, but we already have U in position 2 and S in position 3.
- BUSH: B, U, S, H – all allowed, fits _ U S _ _.

""BUSH"" seems like a strong candidate because:
- B is a common starting letter.
- U is in position 2 (✓ from feedback).
- S is in position 3 (allowed, since S can’t be in 1 or 4).
- H is still allowed.
- It doesn’t contain any of the ruled-out letters.

Another candidate is ""MUST"":
- M, U, S, T – all allowed.
- Fits _ U S _ _.

Between ""BUSH"" and ""MUST"", ""MUST"" is slightly more common as a word, but both are valid. I’ll go with ""MUST"" as it’s a very common word and uses T which is a very common letter.

Pattern check: _ U S _ _ → M U S T ? – wait, ""MUST"" is only 4 letters. I need a 5-letter word.

Oops, ""MUST"" is 4 letters. Let me reconsider.

Valid 5-letter words fitting _ U S _ _:
- MUSTY – but Y is ruled out.
- BUSTY – Y ruled out.
- FUSED – E ruled out.
- GUSHY – Y ruled out.
- MUSTY – Y ruled out.
- BUSED – E ruled out.

Looking at _ U _ _ S:
- HUMPS – H, U, M, P, S – all allowed.
- BUMPY – Y ruled out.
- DUMPY – Y ruled out.
- GUMPS – G, U, M, P, S – all allowed.
- FUMES – E ruled out.

""GUMPS"" seems valid:
- G, U, M, P, S – none of the ruled-out letters.
- U is in position 2 (✓).
- S is in position 5 (allowed, since S can’t be in 1 or 4).

Another good option is ""HUMPS"":
- H, U, M, P, S – all allowed.
- U in position 2 (✓).
- S in position 5 (allowed).

Both ""GUMPS"" and ""HUMPS"" are valid, but ""HUMPS"" is more common.

So I’ll go with ""HUMPS"".

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters ruled out completely:  
A, R, O, E, L, K, Y, H, M

Letters we know are in the word:  
- U (must be in position 2)  
- S (must be in position 5)  
- P (somewhere, but not in position 4)

So the pattern is: _ U _ _ S  
and the word must also contain P, but P cannot be in position 4.

Possible positions for P: 1 or 3.

Case 1: P in position 1 → P U _ _ S  
Case 2: P in position 3 → _ U P _ S  

Allowed letters left (excluding the ruled-out set):

We need to pick a valid 5-letter word from these patterns.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, T, etc. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a good starting guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many English words. This gives us maximum information about which letters might be in the secret word.

Another good option could be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers some of the most common vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
1. The word contains S but NOT in the 4th position.
2. The word does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S (but not in position 4).
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

Good consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Good vowels left: I, U.

Let me try to use common letters from the remaining set. A word like ""SUNNY"" would use S, U, N, N, Y. But N is common and Y might be less common. Alternatively, ""STUMP"" uses S, T, U, M, P. But P is less common. 

Another good option is ""SINGH"" but H is less common. ""SULKY"" uses S, U, L, K, Y. 

I think ""SULKY"" is a good next guess as it uses S (in position 1, so not 4), U, L, K, Y - none of which are A, R, O, E.

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
Guess 2: SULKY → S(-) U(✓) L(x) K(x) Y(x)

Key deductions so far:
1. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, L, K, Y.
2. Letter S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4.
3. Letter U is in the word and is in position 2.

So the pattern so far is: _ U _ _ _  
and the word must contain S somewhere in positions 3 or 5 (since 1 and 4 are ruled out).

Remaining consonants that are still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z  
Remaining vowels that are still possible: I (since U is already used and A, O, E are out).

Let’s look for a word that fits:
- Pattern: _ U S _ _  or  _ U _ _ S
- Uses only the still-allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- MUST: fits _ U S _ _, uses M, T (both allowed).
- PUSH: but H is allowed, but we already have U in position 2 and S in position 3.
- BUSH: B, U, S, H – all allowed, fits _ U S _ _.

""BUSH"" seems like a strong candidate because:
- B is a common starting letter.
- U is in position 2 (✓ from feedback).
- S is in position 3 (allowed, since S can’t be in 1 or 4).
- H is still allowed.
- It doesn’t contain any of the ruled-out letters.

Another candidate is ""MUST"":
- M, U, S, T – all allowed.
- Fits _ U S _ _.

Between ""BUSH"" and ""MUST"", ""MUST"" is slightly more common as a word, but both are valid. I’ll go with ""MUST"" as it’s a very common word and uses T which is a very common letter.

Pattern check: _ U S _ _ → M U S T ? – wait, ""MUST"" is only 4 letters. I need a 5-letter word.

Oops, ""MUST"" is 4 letters. Let me reconsider.

Valid 5-letter words fitting _ U S _ _:
- MUSTY – but Y is ruled out.
- BUSTY – Y ruled out.
- FUSED – E ruled out.
- GUSHY – Y ruled out.
- MUSTY – Y ruled out.
- BUSED – E ruled out.

Looking at _ U _ _ S:
- HUMPS – H, U, M, P, S – all allowed.
- BUMPY – Y ruled out.
- DUMPY – Y ruled out.
- GUMPS – G, U, M, P, S – all allowed.
- FUMES – E ruled out.

""GUMPS"" seems valid:
- G, U, M, P, S – none of the ruled-out letters.
- U is in position 2 (✓).
- S is in position 5 (allowed, since S can’t be in 1 or 4).

Another good option is ""HUMPS"":
- H, U, M, P, S – all allowed.
- U in position 2 (✓).
- S in position 5 (allowed).

Both ""GUMPS"" and ""HUMPS"" are valid, but ""HUMPS"" is more common.

A word like ""SUNNY"" would use S, U, N, N, Y. But N is common and Y might be less common. Alternatively, ""STUMP"" uses S, T, U, M, P.

We now have four pieces of feedback.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)

2. SULKY → S(-) U(✓) L(x) K(x) Y(x)

3. HUMPS → H(x) U(✓) M(x) P(-) S(✓)  
   ⇒ U is in position 2 (confirmed), S is in position 5, P is in the word but not in position 4, H and M are out.

4. PUNTS → P(✓) U(✓) N(x) T(x) S(✓)

Letters already used: P, U, S  
Letters ruled out: A, R, O, E, L, K, Y, H, M, N, T  

Remaining possible letters for positions 3 and 4 (from the alphabet minus the ruled-out set):  
B, C, D, F, G, I, J, Q, V, W, X, Z  

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form P U _ _ S.

Possible candidates:  
- P U B I S → “PUBIS” – valid (plural of pubis)  
- P U B C S → “PUBCS” – invalid
