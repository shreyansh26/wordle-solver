### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This combination can provide good coverage of the alphabet and help identify which letters are in the secret word.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it includes S, L, A, T, E which are all common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better vowel coverage.

This is my first guess, so I don't have any prior information to work with - the goal is to maximize information gain.

Also: A is now confirmed to be in position 3.

Current constraints:
- Letters known to be in the word: A, R, O, S (and A is fixed at position 3).
- Letters ruled out: E, T.
- Positions ruled out so far:

  – R cannot be in positions 1, 2, 5.
  – O cannot be in positions 2, 3, 5.

So we have:
1: S  
3: A  
and we still need to place R and O in positions 2 and 4 (but respecting their restrictions).

R is allowed in positions 3,4,5.  But 3 is taken by A, 5 is disallowed, so R must be in position 4.  
O is allowed in positions 1,4,5.  1 is taken by S, 4 is now taken by R, 5 is disallowed.  That leaves no place for O.  This is a contradiction.

Therefore my assumption that S must be in position 1 is correct, but it leaves O with no valid positions.  The only resolution is that one of the letters must appear twice.  The only common letter left is S; perhaps the word contains two S’s.

Let’s test the pattern S _ A _ S.

The remaining letters to place are R and O.  Positions 2 and 4 must be filled with R and O in some order.

Try S O A R S:
- S in 1 (allowed)

- Letters ruled out: E, T.
- Positions ruled out so far:
  – A cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 (but we now know it must be in position 3).
  – R cannot be in positions 1, 2, 5.
  – O cannot be in positions 2, 3, 5.
  – S cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5.  Therefore S must be in position 1.

So we have:
1: S  
3: A  
and we still need to place R and O in positions 2 and 4 (but respecting their restrictions).

R is allowed in positions 3,4,5.  But 3 is taken by A, 5 is disallowed, so R must be in position 4.  
O is allowed in positions 1,4,5.  1 is taken by S, 4 is now taken by R, 5 is disallowed.  That leaves no place for O.  This is a contradiction.

Therefore my assumption that S must be in position 1 is correct, but it leaves O with no valid positions.  The only resolution is that one of the letters must appear twice.  The only common letter left is S; perhaps the word contains two S’s.

Let’s test the pattern S _ A _ S.

The remaining letters to place are R and O.  Positions 2 and 4 must be filled with R and O in some order.

Try S O A R S:
- S in 1 (allowed)  
- O in 2 (allowed)  
- A in 3 (fixed ✓)  
- R in 4 (allowed)  
- S in 5 (allowed for S)  

Check constraints:
- Contains A, R, O, S.  
- No E, T.  
- All positional restrictions satisfied.

This seems valid.

A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This combination can provide good coverage of the alphabet and help identify which letters are in the secret word.\n\nAnother popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it includes S, L, A, T, E which are all common letters. However, I\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better vowel coverage.\n\nThis is my first guess, so I don\'t have any prior information to work with - the goal is to maximize information gain.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1\n- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2\n- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3\n- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 4\n- E(x): E is not in the word at all\n\nSo the secret word contains the letters A, R, O, S (each somewhere other than their original positions) and does NOT contain E.\n\nPositions ruled out:\n- Position 1: not A\n- Position 2: not R\n- Position 3: not O\n- Position 4: not S\n- Position 5: E is already ruled out, but we still need a letter here.\n\nI need a new 5-letter word that:\n- Uses A, R, O, S (each at least once)\n- Does NOT use E\n- Places each of A, R, O, S in positions they haven\'t been ruled out for\n\nPossible positions:\nA can be in 2,3,4,5\nR can be in 1,3,4,5\nO can be in 1,2,4,5\nS can be in 1,2,3,5\n\nI\'ll try to rearrange these letters while respecting the constraints.

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(x)  
   ⇒ Word contains A, R, O, S (each not in original position) and lacks E.

2. ROAST → R(-) O(-) A(✓) S(-) T(x)  
   ⇒ Word contains R, O, A, S again (no new info) and lacks T.  
   Also confirms A is in position 3.

3. SOARS → S(-) O(-) A(✓) R(✓) S(✓)  
   ⇒ Word contains S, O, A, R again and lacks nothing new.  
   Now we know:  
   - A is in position 3 (✓).  
   - R is in position 4 (✓).  
   - S is in position 5 (✓).  
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (since it got “-”).  

So the pattern so far is:  
_ _ A R S  

Letters left to place: O (must be in position 1 or 2, but NOT 2).  
Therefore O must be in position 1.

Thus the only possible arrangement is:  
O _ A R S  

The blank must be filled by the remaining unused letter.  
We know the word must contain A, R, O, S and no E, T.  
The only letter left that can fit is the second S (since S is already used twice).  

Hence the word is O S A R S.

Check constraints:  
- Letters: O, S, A, R — all required.  
- Positions:  
  – A in 3 (✓)  
  – R in 4 (✓)  
  – S in 5 (✓)  
  – O in 1 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of 2).  

This satisfies everything.
