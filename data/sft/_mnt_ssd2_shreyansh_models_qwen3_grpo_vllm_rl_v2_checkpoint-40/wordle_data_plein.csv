For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English words

This gives us maximum information about letter presence and position. I'll go with AROSE as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E somewhere, but not as the last letter.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S at all.

1. Uses E in positions 1-4.
2. Avoids A, R, O, S.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, etc.
Good vowels left: E (already confirmed), I, U.

A balanced word with E and common consonants: ""UNTIE"" uses:
- U, N, T, I, E
- E is in position 5 (but feedback says E is not in position 5), so this is invalid.

""ELITE"" uses E in position 1 (valid), and has L, I, T, E.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)

   - Letter E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

2. INLET → I(-) N(-) L(-) E(-) T(x)
   - Letters not in the word: T (and we already knew A, R, O, S are out)
   - Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions: I, N, L, E
   - So the word contains I, N, L, E and one more letter that we haven’t tested yet.

Constraints so far:
- Must contain I, N, L, E (each exactly once)
- Must NOT contain A, R, O, S, T
- E cannot be in position 5
- I, N, L are also not in their guessed positions:
   – I was in position 1 → I cannot be in position 1
   – N was in position 2 → N cannot be in position 2
   – L was in position 3 → L cannot be in position 3

Remaining positions for I, N, L, E:
We have 5 positions and one more letter to place. Let’s list possible permutations of I, N, L, E across positions 1-5 with the above restrictions and see which ones are valid.

Possible positions:
1: Cannot be A, R, O, S, T, and cannot be I (since I was in position 1 and marked wrong)
2: Cannot be N (since N was in position 2 and marked wrong)
3: Cannot be L (since L was in position 3 and marked wrong)
4: No restriction on E (except E cannot be in position 5)
5: Cannot be E (from AROSE feedback)

Let’s try to place the letters:

We need one more letter. From unused common letters (excluding A, R, O, S, T), good candidates are: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Let’s pick a word that includes one of these letters and fits the constraints. A good candidate is “FIELD” but it has two I’s which we don’t need. 

“CLINE” has C, L, I, N, E – but E is in position 5 which is invalid.

“FLING” has F, L, I, N, G – but missing E which we know is in the word.

“ELINT” is just the reverse of INLET and has E in position 1 (valid), L in position 2 (was position 3, so allowed), I in position 3 (was position 1, so allowed), N in position 4 (was position 2, so allowed), T is out so this is invalid.

“LINEN” has two N’s – invalid.

“LINED” has L, I, N, E, D – positions:
1:L (was position 3, allowed)
2:I (was position 1, allowed)
3:N (was position 2, allowed)
4:E (was position 4, but E cannot be in position 5 – this is fine, position 4 is allowed)
5:D (new letter, allowed)

This seems valid: LINED.

Check constraints:
- Contains I, N, L, E – yes
- No A, R, O, S, T – yes
- E is in position 4 (not 5) – yes
- I is in position 2 (was 1, so allowed)
- N is in position 3 (was 2, so allowed)

- I, N, L are also not in their guessed positions:
   – I was in position 1 → I cannot be in position 1
   – N was in position 2 → N cannot be in position 2
   – L was in position 3 → L cannot be in position 3

Remaining positions for I, N, L, E:
We have 5 positions and one more letter to place. Let’s list possible permutations of I, N, L, E across positions 1-5 with the above restrictions and see which ones are valid.

Possible positions:
1: Cannot be A, R, O, S, T, and cannot be I (since I was in position 1 and marked wrong)
2: Cannot be N (since N was in position 2 and marked wrong)
3: Cannot be L (since L was in position 3 and marked wrong)
4: No restriction on E (except E cannot be in position 5)
5: Cannot be E (from AROSE feedback)

Let’s try to place the letters:

We need one more letter. From unused common letters (excluding A, R, O, S, T), good candidates are: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Let’s pick a word that includes one of these letters and fits the constraints. A good candidate is “FIELD” but it has two I’s which we don’t need. 

“CLINE” has C, L, I, N, E – but E is in position 5 which is invalid.

“FLING” has F, L, I, N, G – but missing E which we know is in the word.

“ELINT” is just the reverse of INLET and has E in position 1 (valid), L in position 2 (was position 3, so allowed), I in position 3 (was position 1, so allowed), N in position 4 (was position 2, so allowed), T is out so this is invalid.

“LINEN” has two N’s – invalid.

“LINED” has L, I, N, E, D – positions:
1:L (was position 3, allowed)
2:I (was position 1, allowed)
3:N (was position 2, allowed)
4:E (was position 4, but E cannot be in position 5 – this is fine, position 4 is allowed)
5:D (new letter, allowed)

This seems valid: LINED.

Check constraints:
- Contains I, N, L, E – yes
- No A, R, O, S, T – yes
- E is in position 4 (not 5) – yes
- I is in position 2 (was 1, so allowed)
- N is in position 3 (was 2, so allowed)
- L is in position 1 (was 3, so allowed)
- D is new – allowed

So LINED is a valid next guess.

From the three rounds:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)  
   – Letters not in word: A, R, O, S  
   – E is in word but NOT in position 5.

2. INLET → I(-) N(-) L(-) E(-) T(x)

   – I, N, L, E are all in word but in wrong positions.

3. LINED → L(-) I(-) N(-) E(-) D(x)  
   – D is not in word.  
   – L, I, N, E are again confirmed to be in word but in wrong positions.

So far we know:
- Word contains exactly the letters {E, I, L, N} plus one more letter (unknown yet).  
- The extra letter must be from the remaining alphabet excluding A, R, O, S, T, D.  
  Common unused consonants: C, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Positions ruled out:
- E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE).  
- I cannot be in position 1 (from INLET).  
- N cannot be in position 2 (from INLET).  
- L cannot be in position 3 (from INLET).  
  (From LINED, the same letters are again marked wrong, so no new positional info.)

We need a permutation of E, I, L, N plus one new letter that satisfies all constraints.

Let’s list possible positions for E, I, L, N:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Letters:   _ _ _ _ _

Constraints:
- E ≠ 5  
- I ≠ 1  
- N ≠ 2  
- L ≠ 3  

We must place E, I, L, N into four of the five positions, leaving one spot for the new letter.

A quick way is to try permutations of E, I, L, N across positions 1-5 while respecting the positional bans, and see which fit.

One such permutation:  
Place the new letter in position 5 (since it’s untested and we know E can’t be there).  
Then arrange E, I, L, N across 1-4 with the bans respected.

Check if any valid arrangement exists:

Try:
1: N (allowed, N only banned from 2)  
2: E (allowed, E only banned from 5)  
3: I (allowed, I only banned from 1)  
4: L (allowed, L only banned from 3)  
5: new letter (say C)  

This gives N E I L C → “NEIL C” – but we need a real 5-letter word.

Real word that fits: “NEILY” (archaic term for “neither”) – but Y is a semi-vowel and may be less common.

Another candidate: “FILMY” – but F, M, Y are new letters and we only know the word has E, I, L, N plus one more. So FILMY lacks E and N.

We must use exactly E, I, L, N plus one new letter.

Another permutation:
1: I – banned (I cannot be 1)  
2: N – banned (N cannot be 2)  
3: L – banned (L cannot be 3)  
4: E – allowed  
5: new letter  

So valid positions could be:
1: L  
2: I  
3: E  
4: N  
5: new letter  

This gives L I E N _ → “LIEN_” – real word “LIENS” (plural of lien) but S is already ruled out.

Next:  
1: E (allowed)  
2: I (allowed)  
3: N (allowed)  
4: L (allowed)  
5: new letter  

Gives E I N L _ → “EINL_” – no common word.

Another:  
1: L  
2: E  
3: I  
4: N  
5: new letter  

L E I N _ → “LEIN_” – real word “LEINY” (slang) but not standard.

Try new letter in position 2:  
1: E  
2: new letter  
3: I  
4: L  
5: N  

E _ I L N → “EILIN” – not a word.

Try new letter in position 3:  
1: E  
2: I  
3: new letter  
4: L  
5: N  

E I _ L N → “EILIN” – same issue.

Try new letter in position 4:  
1: E  
2: I  
3: L  
4: new letter  
5: N  

E I L _ N → “EILYN” – not a word.

Try new letter in position 1:  
1: new letter  
2: E  
3: I  
4: L  
5: N  

_ E I L N → “BEILN” – no.

Let’s pick a new letter that is common and forms a real word with E, I, L, N.

The only plausible English word I can see that uses exactly E, I, L, N plus one new letter and respects the positional bans is:

“FLING” – but it lacks E.

Wait, we must use E, I, L, N plus one new letter.

After checking, the only valid English word fitting all constraints is “FLING” missing E, so that’s no good.

Another check: “CLINK” – has C, L, I, N, K – missing E.

“PILNE” – not a word.

“HINNE” – not a word.

“MILNE” – surname, not common.

“GIVEN” – has G, I, V, E, N – but lacks L.

We must include L.

Real word: “LINED” already tried.

“ELINT” – reverse of INLET, but T is out.

“ILENE” – has I, L, E, N, E – duplicate E.

“LINEN” – duplicate N.

“LENIS” – has S (out).

“LINED” – D is out.

“LINES” – S is out.

“LINER” – R is out.

“LINED” – D is out.

“LIVEN” – has V, not yet tested, but lacks L in position 1.

Wait, let’s try “FLEIN” – not a word.

“FLIEN” – not a word.

“FLING” – no E.

I’m struggling to find a common word. Let me instead pick a word that uses E, I, L, N plus a new letter and check positions:

“FLING” – no E.

“ELINT” – T is out.

“FLIEN” – not a word.

“FLING” – no.

After careful search, the only plausible remaining word seems to be “FLING” but it misses E. This suggests I might have missed a permutation.

Re-examine possible positions with new letter in 5:

We have letters E, I, L, N and one new letter. The new letter must be placed in one position, and E, I, L, N in the remaining.

Let’s try:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Letters:   L I E N new → “LIEN_” – no.

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Letters:   E I N L new → “EINL_” – no.

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Letters:   N E I L new → “NEIL_” – “NEILY” is a word (though rare).

“NEILY” uses N, E, I, L, Y – all allowed, and positions:
N (1) – allowed (N only banned from 2)  
E (2) – allowed (E only banned from 5)  
I (3) – allowed (I only banned from 1)  
L (4) – allowed (L only banned from 3)  
Y (5) – new letter.

This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is “NEILY”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English words

This gives us maximum information about letter presence and position. I'll go with AROSE as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E somewhere, but not as the last letter.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S at all.

We now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses E in positions 1-4.
2. Avoids A, R, O, S.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, etc.
Good vowels left: E (already confirmed), I, U.

A balanced word with E and common consonants: ""UNTIE"" uses:
- U, N, T, I, E
- E is in position 5 (but feedback says E is not in position 5), so this is invalid.

""ELITE"" uses E in position 1 (valid), and has L, I, T, E.
But E is repeated, which may not be optimal for info.

""EVENT"" uses E in position 1 and 5 (position 5 is invalid for E).

""INLET"" uses I, N, L, E, T - E in position 4 (valid), no A/R/O/S.

This seems good: INLET.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Guess 2: INLET -> FEEDBACK: I(-) N(-) L(-) E(-) T(x)
<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - Letters not in the word: A, R, O, S
   - Letter E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

2. INLET → I(-) N(-) L(-) E(-) T(x)
   - Letters not in the word: T (and we already knew A, R, O, S are out)
   - Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions: I, N, L, E
   - So the word contains I, N, L, E and one more letter that we haven’t tested yet.

Constraints so far:
- Must contain I, N, L, E (each exactly once)
- Must NOT contain A, R, O, S, T
- E cannot be in position 5
- I, N, L are also not in their guessed positions:
   – I was in position 1 → I cannot be in position 1
   – N was in position 2 → N cannot be in position 2
   – L was in position 3 → L cannot be in position 3

Remaining positions for I, N, L, E:
We have 5 positions and one more letter to place. Let’s list possible permutations of I, N, L, E across positions 1-5 with the above restrictions and see which ones are valid.

Possible positions:
1: Cannot be A, R, O, S, T, and cannot be I (since I was in position 1 and marked wrong)
2: Cannot be N (since N was in position 2 and marked wrong)
3: Cannot be L (since L was in position 3 and marked wrong)
4: No restriction on E (except E cannot be in position 5)
5: Cannot be E (from AROSE feedback)

Let’s try to place the letters:

We need one more letter. From unused common letters (excluding A, R, O, S, T), good candidates are: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Let’s pick a word that includes one of these letters and fits the constraints. A good candidate is “FIELD” but it has two I’s which we don’t need. 

“CLINE” has C, L, I, N, E – but E is in position 5 which is invalid.

“FLING” has F, L, I, N, G – but missing E which we know is in the word.

“ELINT” is just the reverse of INLET and has E in position 1 (valid), L in position 2 (was position 3, so allowed), I in position 3 (was position 1, so allowed), N in position 4 (was position 2, so allowed), T is out so this is invalid.

“LINEN” has two N’s – invalid.

“LINED” has L, I, N, E, D – positions:
1:L (was position 3, allowed)
2:I (was position 1, allowed)
3:N (was position 2, allowed)
4:E (was position 4, but E cannot be in position 5 – this is fine, position 4 is allowed)
5:D (new letter, allowed)

This seems valid: LINED.

Check constraints:
- Contains I, N, L, E – yes
- No A, R, O, S, T – yes
- E is in position 4 (not 5) – yes
- I is in position 2 (was 1, so allowed)
- N is in position 3 (was 2, so allowed)
- L is in position 1 (was 3, so allowed)
- D is new – allowed

So LINED is a valid next guess.

From the three rounds:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)  
   – Letters not in word: A, R, O, S  
   – E is in word but NOT in position 5.

2. INLET → I(-) N(-) L(-) E(-) T(x)  
   – T is not in word.  
   – I, N, L, E are all in word but in wrong positions.

3. LINED → L(-) I(-) N(-) E(-) D(x)  
   – D is not in word.  
   – L, I, N, E are again confirmed to be in word but in wrong positions.

So far we know:
- Word contains exactly the letters {E, I, L, N} plus one more letter (unknown yet).  
- The extra letter must be from the remaining alphabet excluding A, R, O, S, T, D.  
  Common unused consonants: C, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Positions ruled out:
- E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE).  
- I cannot be in position 1 (from INLET).  
- N cannot be in position 2 (from INLET).  
- L cannot be in position 3 (from INLET).  
  (From LINED, the same letters are again marked wrong, so no new positional info.)

We need a permutation of E, I, L, N plus one new letter that satisfies all constraints.

Let’s list possible positions for E, I, L, N:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Letters:   _ _ _ _ _

Constraints:
- E ≠ 5  
- I ≠ 1  
- N ≠ 2  
- L ≠ 3  

We must place E, I, L, N into four of the five positions, leaving one spot for the new letter.

A quick way is to try permutations of E, I, L, N across positions 1-5 while respecting the positional bans, and see which fit.

One such permutation:  
Place the new letter in position 5 (since it’s untested and we know E can’t be there).  
Then arrange E, I, L, N across 1-4 with the bans respected.

Check if any valid arrangement exists:

Try:
1: N (allowed, N only banned from 2)  
2: E (allowed, E only banned from 5)  
3: I (allowed, I only banned from 1)  
4: L (allowed, L only banned from 3)  
5: new letter (say C)  

This gives N E I L C → “NEIL C” – but we need a real 5-letter word.

Real word that fits: “NEILY” (archaic term for “neither”) – but Y is a semi-vowel and may be less common.

Another candidate: “FILMY” – but F, M, Y are new letters and we only know the word has E, I, L, N plus one more. So FILMY lacks E and N.

We must use exactly E, I, L, N plus one new letter.

Another permutation:
1: I – banned (I cannot be 1)  
2: N – banned (N cannot be 2)  
3: L – banned (L cannot be 3)  
4: E – allowed  
5: new letter  

So valid positions could be:
1: L  
2: I  
3: E  
4: N  
5: new letter  

This gives L I E N _ → “LIEN_” – real word “LIENS” (plural of lien) but S is already ruled out.

Next:  
1: E (allowed)  
2: I (allowed)  
3: N (allowed)  
4: L (allowed)  
5: new letter  

Gives E I N L _ → “EINL_” – no common word.

Another:  
1: L  
2: E  
3: I  
4: N  
5: new letter  

L E I N _ → “LEIN_” – real word “LEINY” (slang) but not standard.

Try new letter in position 2:  
1: E  
2: new letter  
3: I  
4: L  
5: N  

E _ I L N → “EILIN” – not a word.

Try new letter in position 3:  
1: E  
2: I  
3: new letter  
4: L  
5: N  

E I _ L N → “EILIN” – same issue.

Try new letter in position 4:  
1: E  
2: I  
3: L  
4: new letter  
5: N  

E I L _ N → “EILYN” – not a word.

Try new letter in position 1:  
1: new letter  
2: E  
3: I  
4: L  
5: N  

_ E I L N → “BEILN” – no.

Let’s pick a new letter that is common and forms a real word with E, I, L, N.

The only plausible English word I can see that uses exactly E, I, L, N plus one new letter and respects the positional bans is:

“FLING” – but it lacks E.

Wait, we must use E, I, L, N plus one new letter.

After checking, the only valid English word fitting all constraints is “FLING” missing E, so that’s no good.

Another check: “CLINK” – has C, L, I, N, K – missing E.

“PILNE” – not a word.

“HINNE” – not a word.

“MILNE” – surname, not common.

“GIVEN” – has G, I, V, E, N – but lacks L.

We must include L.

Real word: “LINED” already tried.

“ELINT” – reverse of INLET, but T is out.

“ILENE” – has I, L, E, N, E – duplicate E.

“LINEN” – duplicate N.

“LENIS” – has S (out).

“LINED” – D is out.

“LINES” – S is out.

“LINER” – R is out.

“LINED” – D is out.

“LIVEN” – has V, not yet tested, but lacks L in position 1.

Wait, let’s try “FLEIN” – not a word.

“FLIEN” – not a word.

“FLING” – no E.

I’m struggling to find a common word. Let me instead pick a word that uses E, I, L, N plus a new letter and check positions:

“FLING” – no E.

“ELINT” – T is out.

“FLIEN” – not a word.

“FLING” – no.

After careful search, the only plausible remaining word seems to be “FLING” but it misses E. This suggests I might have missed a permutation.

Re-examine possible positions with new letter in 5:

We have letters E, I, L, N and one new letter. The new letter must be placed in one position, and E, I, L, N in the remaining.

Let’s try:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Letters:   L I E N new → “LIEN_” – no.

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Letters:   E I N L new → “EINL_” – no.

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Letters:   N E I L new → “NEIL_” – “NEILY” is a word (though rare).

“NEILY” uses N, E, I, L, Y – all allowed, and positions:
N (1) – allowed (N only banned from 2)  
E (2) – allowed (E only banned from 5)  
I (3) – allowed (I only banned from 1)  
L (4) – allowed (L only banned from 3)  
Y (5) – new letter.

This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is “NEILY”.

  – L cannot be in positions 3, 4 (from LINED, NEILY)  
  – N cannot be in positions 2, 5 (from NEILY)

So the word must contain exactly the letters {E, I, L, N} plus one more letter (unknown yet).  
The fifth letter must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the banned set:  
  allowed = {B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z}

We need a 5-letter word that:
  – uses each of E, I, L, N exactly once  
  – uses one letter from the allowed set  
  – respects all positional bans above

Let’s list the positional bans again for clarity:

Position 1: cannot be A, R, O, S, T, D, Y, I, N  
Position 2: cannot be T, D, Y, E, N  
Position 3: cannot be A, R, O, S, L, D, Y, I  
Position 4: cannot be A, R, O, S, L, D, Y, E  
Position 5: cannot be A, R, O, S, T, D, Y, E, N

The only remaining positions for each known letter:

E: allowed in 1, 3 (cannot be 2, 4, 5)  
I: allowed in 2, 4, 5 (cannot be 1, 3)  
L: allowed in 1, 2, 5 (cannot be 3, 4)  
N: allowed in 1, 3, 4 (cannot be 2, 5)

We must place E, I, L, N into four of the five positions, leaving one spot for the new letter.

Let’s try to find a valid permutation:

Option 1: place new letter in position 1  
  Then positions 2,3,4,5 must contain E,I,L,N with bans respected.  
  Check possible arrangements:
  – 2: E (allowed), 3: I (allowed), 4: L (banned), so invalid  
  – 2: I (allowed), 3: E (allowed), 4: L (banned), invalid  
  – 2: L (allowed), 3: E (allowed), 4: I (allowed), 5: N (allowed)  
    This gives: [new] L E I N → word is “BLEIN” (not valid)  
    “CLEAN” – but A is banned.  
    “FLEIN” – not a word.  
    “GLEIN” – not a word.  
    “PLEIN” – variant of plein, but uncommon.

Option 2: place new letter in position 2  
  Then positions 1,3,4,5 contain E,I,L,N with bans:  
  – 1: cannot be I,N  
  – 3: cannot be L,I  
  – 4: cannot be L,E  
  – 5: cannot be N,E  
  Possible arrangement:  
  1: E (allowed), 2: new, 3: I (allowed), 4: L (banned), invalid  
  1: L (allowed), 2: new, 3: E (allowed), 4: I (allowed), 5: N (allowed)  
  Word: L _ E I N → “LEPIN” (not a word)  
  “LEMIN” – not a word.

Option 3: place new letter in position 3  
  Then positions 1,2,4,5 contain E,I,L,N with bans:  
  – 1: cannot be I,N  
  – 2: cannot be E,N  
  – 4: cannot be L,E  
  – 5: cannot be N,E  
  Possible arrangement:  
  1: E (allowed), 2: I (allowed), 3: new, 4: L (banned), invalid  
  1: L (allowed), 2: I (allowed), 3: new, 4: E (allowed), 5: N (allowed)  
  Word: L I _ E N → “LIKEN” – valid English word!  
  Check constraints:
    – Letters: L, I, K, E, N – contains K (new), E, I, L, N – perfect.  
    – Positions:  
      1:L – allowed (banned from 3,4,5)  
      2:I – allowed (banned from 1,3)  
      3:K – new letter – allowed  
      4:E – allowed (banned from 2,5)  
      5:N – allowed (banned from 2,5)  
    – No banned letters used.

Therefore, the next guess is “LIKEN”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English words

This gives us maximum information about letter presence and position. I'll go with AROSE as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E somewhere, but not as the last letter.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S at all.

We now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses E in positions 1-4.
2. Avoids A, R, O, S.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, etc.
Good vowels left: E (already confirmed), I, U.

A balanced word with E and common consonants: ""UNTIE"" uses:
- U, N, T, I, E
- E is in position 5 (but feedback says E is not in position 5), so this is invalid.

""ELITE"" uses E in position 1 (valid), and has L, I, T, E.
But E is repeated, which may not be optimal for info.

""EVENT"" uses E in position 1 and 5 (position 5 is invalid for E).

""INLET"" uses I, N, L, E, T - E in position 4 (valid), no A/R/O/S.

This seems good: INLET.

Guess 2: INLET -> FEEDBACK: I(-) N(-) L(-) E(-) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - Letters not in the word: A, R, O, S
   - Letter E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

2. INLET → I(-) N(-) L(-) E(-) T(x)
   - Letters not in the word: T (and we already knew A, R, O, S are out)
   - Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions: I, N, L, E
   - So the word contains I, N, L, E and one more letter that we haven’t tested yet.

Constraints so far:
- Must contain I, N, L, E (each exactly once)
- Must NOT contain A, R, O, S, T
- E cannot be in position 5
- I, N, L are also not in their guessed positions:
   – I was in position 1 → I cannot be in position 1
   – N was in position 2 → N cannot be in position 2
   – L was in position 3 → L cannot be in position 3

Remaining positions for I, N, L, E:
We have 5 positions and one more letter to place. Let’s list possible permutations of I, N, L, E across positions 1-5 with the above restrictions and see which ones are valid.

Possible positions:
1: Cannot be A, R, O, S, T, and cannot be I (since I was in position 1 and marked wrong)
2: Cannot be N (since N was in position 2 and marked wrong)
3: Cannot be L (since L was in position 3 and marked wrong)
4: No restriction on E (except E cannot be in position 5)
5: Cannot be E (from AROSE feedback)

Let’s try to place the letters:

We need one more letter. From unused common letters (excluding A, R, O, S, T), good candidates are: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Let’s pick a word that includes one of these letters and fits the constraints. A good candidate is “FIELD” but it has two I’s which we don’t need. 

“CLINE” has C, L, I, N, E – but E is in position 5 which is invalid.

“FLING” has F, L, I, N, G – but missing E which we know is in the word.

“ELINT” is just the reverse of INLET and has E in position 1 (valid), L in position 2 (was position 3, so allowed), I in position 3 (was position 1, so allowed), N in position 4 (was position 2, so allowed), T is out so this is invalid.

“LINEN” has two N’s – invalid.

“LINED” has L, I, N, E, D – positions:
1:L (was position 3, allowed)
2:I (was position 1, allowed)
3:N (was position 2, allowed)
4:E (was position 4, but E cannot be in position 5 – this is fine, position 4 is allowed)
5:D (new letter, allowed)

This seems valid: LINED.

Check constraints:
- Contains I, N, L, E – yes
- No A, R, O, S, T – yes
- E is in position 4 (not 5) – yes
- I is in position 2 (was 1, so allowed)
- N is in position 3 (was 2, so allowed)
- L is in position 1 (was 3, so allowed)
- D is new – allowed

So LINED is a valid next guess.

From the three rounds:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)  
   – Letters not in word: A, R, O, S  
   – E is in word but NOT in position 5.

2. INLET → I(-) N(-) L(-) E(-) T(x)  
   – T is not in word.  
   – I, N, L, E are all in word but in wrong positions.

3. LINED → L(-) I(-) N(-) E(-) D(x)  
   – D is not in word.  
   – L, I, N, E are again confirmed to be in word but in wrong positions.

So far we know:
- Word contains exactly the letters {E, I, L, N} plus one more letter (unknown yet).  
- The extra letter must be from the remaining alphabet excluding A, R, O, S, T, D.  
  Common unused consonants: C, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Positions ruled out:
- E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE).  
- I cannot be in position 1 (from INLET).  
- N cannot be in position 2 (from INLET).  
- L cannot be in position 3 (from INLET).  
  (From LINED, the same letters are again marked wrong, so no new positional info.)

We need a permutation of E, I, L, N plus one new letter that satisfies all constraints.

Let’s list possible positions for E, I, L, N:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Letters:   _ _ _ _ _

Constraints:
- E ≠ 5  
- I ≠ 1  
- N ≠ 2  
- L ≠ 3  

We must place E, I, L, N into four of the five positions, leaving one spot for the new letter.

A quick way is to try permutations of E, I, L, N across positions 1-5 while respecting the positional bans, and see which fit.

One such permutation:  
Place the new letter in position 5 (since it’s untested and we know E can’t be there).  
Then arrange E, I, L, N across 1-4 with the bans respected.

Check if any valid arrangement exists:

Try:
1: N (allowed, N only banned from 2)  
2: E (allowed, E only banned from 5)  
3: I (allowed, I only banned from 1)  
4: L (allowed, L only banned from 3)  
5: new letter (say C)  

This gives N E I L C → “NEIL C” – but we need a real 5-letter word.

Real word that fits: “NEILY” (archaic term for “neither”) – but Y is a semi-vowel and may be less common.

Another candidate: “FILMY” – but F, M, Y are new letters and we only know the word has E, I, L, N plus one more. So FILMY lacks E and N.

We must use exactly E, I, L, N plus one new letter.

Another permutation:
1: I – banned (I cannot be 1)  
2: N – banned (N cannot be 2)  
3: L – banned (L cannot be 3)  
4: E – allowed  
5: new letter  

So valid positions could be:
1: L  
2: I  
3: E  
4: N  
5: new letter  

This gives L I E N _ → “LIEN_” – real word “LIENS” (plural of lien) but S is already ruled out.

Next:  
1: E (allowed)  
2: I (allowed)  
3: N (allowed)  
4: L (allowed)  
5: new letter  

Gives E I N L _ → “EINL_” – no common word.

Another:  
1: L  
2: E  
3: I  
4: N  
5: new letter  

L E I N _ → “LEIN_” – real word “LEINY” (slang) but not standard.

Try new letter in position 2:  
1: E  
2: new letter  
3: I  
4: L  
5: N  

E _ I L N → “EILIN” – not a word.

Try new letter in position 3:  
1: E  
2: I  
3: new letter  
4: L  
5: N  

E I _ L N → “EILIN” – same issue.

Try new letter in position 4:  
1: E  
2: I  
3: L  
4: new letter  
5: N  

E I L _ N → “EILYN” – not a word.

Try new letter in position 1:  
1: new letter  
2: E  
3: I  
4: L  
5: N  

_ E I L N → “BEILN” – no.

Let’s pick a new letter that is common and forms a real word with E, I, L, N.

The only plausible English word I can see that uses exactly E, I, L, N plus one new letter and respects the positional bans is:

“FLING” – but it lacks E.

Wait, we must use E, I, L, N plus one new letter.

After checking, the only valid English word fitting all constraints is “FLING” missing E, so that’s no good.

Another check: “CLINK” – has C, L, I, N, K – missing E.

“PILNE” – not a word.

“HINNE” – not a word.

“MILNE” – surname, not common.

“GIVEN” – has G, I, V, E, N – but lacks L.

We must include L.

Real word: “LINED” already tried.

“ELINT” – reverse of INLET, but T is out.

“ILENE” – has I, L, E, N, E – duplicate E.

“LINEN” – duplicate N.

“LENIS” – has S (out).

“LINED” – D is out.

“LINES” – S is out.

“LINER” – R is out.

“LINED” – D is out.

“LIVEN” – has V, not yet tested, but lacks L in position 1.

Wait, let’s try “FLEIN” – not a word.

“FLIEN” – not a word.

“FLING” – no E.

I’m struggling to find a common word. Let me instead pick a word that uses E, I, L, N plus a new letter and check positions:

“FLING” – no E.

“ELINT” – T is out.

“FLIEN” – not a word.

“FLING” – no.

After careful search, the only plausible remaining word seems to be “FLING” but it misses E. This suggests I might have missed a permutation.

Re-examine possible positions with new letter in 5:

We have letters E, I, L, N and one new letter. The new letter must be placed in one position, and E, I, L, N in the remaining.

Let’s try:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Letters:   L I E N new → “LIEN_” – no.

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Letters:   E I N L new → “EINL_” – no.

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Letters:   N E I L new → “NEIL_” – “NEILY” is a word (though rare).

“NEILY” uses N, E, I, L, Y – all allowed, and positions:
N (1) – allowed (N only banned from 2)  
E (2) – allowed (E only banned from 5)  
I (3) – allowed (I only banned from 1)  
L (4) – allowed (L only banned from 3)  
Y (5) – new letter.

This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is “NEILY”.

From the four rounds of feedback we now know:

- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, T, D, Y  
- Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong positions so far): E, I, L, N  
- Additional positional bans:
  – E cannot be in positions 2, 4, 5 (from INLET, LINED, NEILY)  
  – I cannot be in positions 1, 3 (from INLET, NEILY)  
  – L cannot be in positions 3, 4 (from LINED, NEILY)  
  – N cannot be in positions 2, 5 (from NEILY)

So the word must contain exactly the letters {E, I, L, N} plus one more letter (unknown yet).  
The fifth letter must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the banned set:  
  allowed = {B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z}

We need a 5-letter word that:
  – uses each of E, I, L, N exactly once  
  – uses one letter from the allowed set  
  – respects all positional bans above

Let’s list the positional bans again for clarity:

Position 1: cannot be A, R, O, S, T, D, Y, I, N  
Position 2: cannot be T, D, Y, E, N  
Position 3: cannot be A, R, O, S, L, D, Y, I  
Position 4: cannot be A, R, O, S, L, D, Y, E  
Position 5: cannot be A, R, O, S, T, D, Y, E, N

The only remaining positions for each known letter:

E: allowed in 1, 3 (cannot be 2, 4, 5)  
I: allowed in 2, 4, 5 (cannot be 1, 3)  
L: allowed in 1, 2, 5 (cannot be 3, 4)  
N: allowed in 1, 3, 4 (cannot be 2, 5)

We must place E, I, L, N into four of the five positions, leaving one spot for the new letter.

Let’s try to find a valid permutation:

Option 1: place new letter in position 1  
  Then positions 2,3,4,5 must contain E,I,L,N with bans respected.  
  Check possible arrangements:
  – 2: E (allowed), 3: I (allowed), 4: L (banned), so invalid  
  – 2: I (allowed), 3: E (allowed), 4: L (banned), invalid  
  – 2: L (allowed), 3: E (allowed), 4: I (allowed), 5: N (allowed)  
    This gives: [new] L E I N → word is “BLEIN” (not valid)  
    “CLEAN” – but A is banned.  
    “FLEIN” – not a word.  
    “GLEIN” – not a word.  
    “PLEIN” – variant of plein, but uncommon.

Option 2: place new letter in position 2  
  Then positions 1,3,4,5 contain E,I,L,N with bans:  
  – 1: cannot be I,N  
  – 3: cannot be L,I  
  – 4: cannot be L,E  
  – 5: cannot be N,E  
  Possible arrangement:  
  1: E (allowed), 2: new, 3: I (allowed), 4: L (banned), invalid  
  1: L (allowed), 2: new, 3: E (allowed), 4: I (allowed), 5: N (allowed)  
  Word: L _ E I N → “LEPIN” (not a word)  
  “LEMIN” – not a word.

Option 3: place new letter in position 3  
  Then positions 1,2,4,5 contain E,I,L,N with bans:  
  – 1: cannot be I,N  
  – 2: cannot be E,N  
  – 4: cannot be L,E  
  – 5: cannot be N,E  
  Possible arrangement:  
  1: E (allowed), 2: I (allowed), 3: new, 4: L (banned), invalid  
  1: L (allowed), 2: I (allowed), 3: new, 4: E (allowed), 5: N (allowed)  
  Word: L I _ E N → “LIKEN” – valid English word!  
  Check constraints:
    – Letters: L, I, K, E, N – contains K (new), E, I, L, N – perfect.  
    – Positions:  
      1:L – allowed (banned from 3,4,5)  
      2:I – allowed (banned from 1,3)  
      3:K – new letter – allowed  
      4:E – allowed (banned from 2,5)  
      5:N – allowed (banned from 2,5)  
    – No banned letters used.

Therefore, the next guess is “LIKEN”.

From the latest feedback:

- N is in the correct position (position 5).
- L is in the word but not in position 1.
- I is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 4.
- K is not in the word.

So the word is of the form: _ _ _ _ N  
and must contain L, I, E in some order in positions 1-4, with the following constraints:
- L cannot be in position 1
- I cannot be in position 2
- E cannot be in position 4

We already know the letters are {E, I, L, N} plus one more letter, but N is already placed at position 5, so the fifth letter must be one we haven't used yet. From previous rounds, the only letters we've ruled out are A, R, O, S, T, D, Y, K. So the fifth letter must be from {B, C, F, G, H, J, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z}.

But looking at the word structure _ _ _ _ N and needing to place E, I, L in positions 1-4, let's list possible permutations:

Possible positions for E, I, L in 1-4 with constraints:
- L cannot be 1
- I cannot be 2
- E cannot be 4

Let's enumerate valid permutations:

1. L I E _ N → positions: L(1) - invalid (L cannot be 1)
2. L E I _ N → positions: L(1) - invalid
3. E L I _ N → positions: E(1), L(2), I(3) - valid
4. E I L _ N → positions: E(1), I(2) - invalid (I cannot be 2)
5. I L E _ N → positions: I(1), L(2), E(3) - valid
6. I E L _ N → positions: I(1), E(2), L(3) - valid
7. L _ I E N → positions: L(1) - invalid
8. L _ E I N → positions: L(1) - invalid
9. E _ L I N → positions: E(1), L(3), I(4) - but E cannot be 4 (already in word), but here E is in 1, so valid
10. E _ I L N → positions: E(1), I(3), L(4) - valid
11. etc.

From these, the valid patterns are:
- E L I _ N → need a letter in position 4, but we already have E, L, I, N. Wait, we need one more letter. This suggests our earlier assumption might be off.

Wait, the word must contain E, I, L, N plus one more letter. Since N is fixed at position 5, the other four positions must contain E, I, L and the new letter. So the letters are E, I, L, new_letter, N.

Let's re-express: the word has letters {E, I, L, X, N} where X is the new letter. The structure is _ _ _ _ N, and positions 1-4 must contain E, I, L, X in some order with constraints:
- L not in 1
- I not in 2
- E not in 4

Let's list possible permutations of E, I, L, X in positions 1-4, then append N.

But since X is unknown, let's consider possible X from remaining letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z.

Let's try possible X:

For example, let's try X = C:
Permutations of E, I, L, C:
- C E L I → positions: C(1), E(2), L(3), I(4) → word: C E L I N
Check constraints:
  - L not in 1: yes (3)
  - I not in 2: yes (4)
  - E not in 4: yes (2)
  - All letters: C, E, L, I, N - valid

This seems valid. Let's check if ""CELIN"" is a word - no, it's not valid.

Next permutation: C I L E → positions: C(1), I(2) - invalid (I cannot be 2)

Next: E C L I → positions: E(1), C(2), L(3), I(4) - valid
Word: E C L I N - ""ECLIN"" - not a word.

Next: E I L C → positions: E(1), I(2) - invalid

Next: L C E I → positions: L(1) - invalid

Next: L I C E → positions: L(1) - invalid

Next: I C E L → positions: I(1), C(2), E(3), L(4) - valid
Word: I C E L N - ""ICELN"" - not a word.

This suggests C may not be the right letter. Let's try X = M:

Permutations of E, I, L, M:
- M E L I → positions: M(1), E(2), L(3), I(4) → M E L I N - ""ME LIN"" - not a word
- E M L I → positions: E(1), M(2), L(3), I(4) - valid
  Word: E M L I N - ""EMLIN"" - not a word
- etc.

This approach is time-consuming. Let's instead look for real 5-letter words ending in N that contain E, I, L plus one more letter, with the constraints.

Looking at valid English words ending in N with E, I, L:
Possible candidates: ""ELFIN"", ""ELVIN"", ""FLING"" (but lacks E), ""BLINK"" (but lacks E), etc.

""ELFIN"" - letters E, L, F, I, N
Check constraints:
  - L not in 1: yes (2)
  - I not in 2: yes (4)
  - E not in 4: yes (1)
  - All letters: E, L, F, I, N - valid
  - Word: E L F I N - positions: 1:E, 2:L, 3:F, 4:I, 5:N
  - This fits all constraints.

Let's verify:
- Contains E, L, I, N plus F
- N is in correct position 5
- L is in position 2 (not 1) - valid
- I is in position 4 (not 2) - valid
- E is in position 1 (not 4) - valid

Thus, ""ELFIN"" is a valid guess.

<guess>ELFIN</guess>",ELFIN,"From the latest feedback:

- N is in the correct position (position 5).
- L is in the word but not in position 1.
- I is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 4.
- K is not in the word.

So the word is of the form: _ _ _ _ N  
and must contain L, I, E in some order in positions 1-4, with the following constraints:
- L cannot be in position 1
- I cannot be in position 2
- E cannot be in position 4

We already know the letters are {E, I, L, N} plus one more letter, but N is already placed at position 5, so the fifth letter must be one we haven't used yet. From previous rounds, the only letters we've ruled out are A, R, O, S, T, D, Y, K. So the fifth letter must be from {B, C, F, G, H, J, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z}.

But looking at the word structure _ _ _ _ N and needing to place E, I, L in positions 1-4, let's list possible permutations:

Possible positions for E, I, L in 1-4 with constraints:
- L cannot be 1
- I cannot be 2
- E cannot be 4

Let's enumerate valid permutations:

1. L I E _ N → positions: L(1) - invalid (L cannot be 1)
2. L E I _ N → positions: L(1) - invalid
3. E L I _ N → positions: E(1), L(2), I(3) - valid
4. E I L _ N → positions: E(1), I(2) - invalid (I cannot be 2)
5. I L E _ N → positions: I(1), L(2), E(3) - valid
6. I E L _ N → positions: I(1), E(2), L(3) - valid
7. L _ I E N → positions: L(1) - invalid
8. L _ E I N → positions: L(1) - invalid
9. E _ L I N → positions: E(1), L(3), I(4) - but E cannot be 4 (already in word), but here E is in 1, so valid
10. E _ I L N → positions: E(1), I(3), L(4) - valid
11. etc.

From these, the valid patterns are:
- E L I _ N → need a letter in position 4, but we already have E, L, I, N. Wait, we need one more letter. This suggests our earlier assumption might be off.

Wait, the word must contain E, I, L, N plus one more letter. Since N is fixed at position 5, the other four positions must contain E, I, L and the new letter. So the letters are E, I, L, new_letter, N.

Let's re-express: the word has letters {E, I, L, X, N} where X is the new letter. The structure is _ _ _ _ N, and positions 1-4 must contain E, I, L, X in some order with constraints:
- L not in 1
- I not in 2
- E not in 4

Let's list possible permutations of E, I, L, X in positions 1-4, then append N.

But since X is unknown, let's consider possible X from remaining letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z.

Let's try possible X:

For example, let's try X = C:
Permutations of E, I, L, C:
- C E L I → positions: C(1), E(2), L(3), I(4) → word: C E L I N
Check constraints:
  - L not in 1: yes (3)
  - I not in 2: yes (4)
  - E not in 4: yes (2)
  - All letters: C, E, L, I, N - valid

This seems valid. Let's check if ""CELIN"" is a word - no, it's not valid.

Next permutation: C I L E → positions: C(1), I(2) - invalid (I cannot be 2)

Next: E C L I → positions: E(1), C(2), L(3), I(4) - valid
Word: E C L I N - ""ECLIN"" - not a word.

Next: E I L C → positions: E(1), I(2) - invalid

Next: L C E I → positions: L(1) - invalid

Next: L I C E → positions: L(1) - invalid

Next: I C E L → positions: I(1), C(2), E(3), L(4) - valid
Word: I C E L N - ""ICELN"" - not a word.

This suggests C may not be the right letter. Let's try X = M:

Permutations of E, I, L, M:
- M E L I → positions: M(1), E(2), L(3), I(4) → M E L I N - ""ME LIN"" - not a word
- E M L I → positions: E(1), M(2), L(3), I(4) - valid
  Word: E M L I N - ""EMLIN"" - not a word
- etc.

This approach is time-consuming. Let's instead look for real 5-letter words ending in N that contain E, I, L plus one more letter, with the constraints.

Looking at valid English words ending in N with E, I, L:
Possible candidates: ""ELFIN"", ""ELVIN"", ""FLING"" (but lacks E), ""BLINK"" (but lacks E), etc.

""ELFIN"" - letters E, L, F, I, N
Check constraints:
  - L not in 1: yes (2)
  - I not in 2: yes (4)
  - E not in 4: yes (1)
  - All letters: E, L, F, I, N - valid
  - Word: E L F I N - positions: 1:E, 2:L, 3:F, 4:I, 5:N
  - This fits all constraints.

Let's verify:
- Contains E, L, I, N plus F
- N is in correct position 5
- L is in position 2 (not 1) - valid
- I is in position 4 (not 2) - valid
- E is in position 1 (not 4) - valid

Thus, ""ELFIN"" is a valid guess.",Guess 6: ELFIN -> FEEDBACK: E(-) L(✓) F(x) I(✓) N(✓),FAIL
