### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters
- Covers 5 distinct letters

This gives us good coverage of the alphabet's most common letters and will likely reveal several letters that are in the secret word.

5. We need a 5-letter word that:
   - Has U as the second letter.  
   - Has Y as the fifth letter.  
   - Uses only the still-allowed letters in positions 1, 3, 4.

6. Scanning common English words that fit _ U _ _ Y and use only allowed letters:
   - DUMMY (but M and D are allowed, yet second M would repeat M which is fine, but we already have Y at end)  
   - HUMPY (H, M, P, Y – all allowed)  
   - JUMPY (J, M, P, Y – all allowed)  
   - GULPY (G, L, P, Y – but L is already ruled out)  
   - CUPPY (C, P, P, Y – P is allowed, but C is allowed)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters
- Covers 5 distinct letters

This gives us good coverage of the alphabet's most common letters and will likely reveal several letters that are in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means we need a completely new set of letters.  
To maximize information again, I’ll pick a word that uses five of the next most common letters that weren’t in AROSE.  
The remaining high-frequency letters include: T, I, N, L, U, C, Y, D, H, M, P, B, G, K, F, W, V, Z, X, Q, J.  
A balanced choice is “UNITY” (U, N, I, T, Y) – it contains three vowels (U, I, Y) and two common consonants (N, T), none of which were used in the first guess.

Guess 2: UNITY -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(x) I(x) T(x) Y(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

- A, R, O, S, E, N, I, T are all NOT in the word (x).
- U is in the word but not in position 1 (-).
- Y is in the word and in position 5 (✓).

So the secret word:
- Ends with Y.
- Contains U somewhere other than position 1.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, E, N, I, T.

Remaining common letters not yet tried: D, L, C, B, G, H, M, P, F, K, W, V, Z, Q, J, X.

We need a 5-letter word ending in Y that uses U and avoids the excluded letters.  
A good candidate is “BULKY”:
- Ends with Y (✓).
- Contains U in position 2 (allowed, since U is not in position 1).
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (B, L, K).
- No repeats of any excluded letters.

Let’s go with BULKY.

2. Letters that ARE in the word:  
   - U (and it is in position 2)  
   - Y (and it is in position 5)

3. Therefore the pattern so far is:  
   _ U _ _ Y

4. Letters still available (not yet ruled out):  
   C, D, F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

5. We need a 5-letter word that:
   - Has U as the second letter.

   - Uses only the still-allowed letters in positions 1, 3, 4.

From the feedback so far:

  A, R, O, S, E, N, I, T, B, L, K, J, M, P, F
- Remaining available letters for position 3:

We need a single letter for position 3 that:
1. Is one of the still-allowed letters.
2. Forms a valid English word with H U _ _ Y.

Scanning the remaining letters:

- C → H U C _ Y → “HUCHY” – not a word
