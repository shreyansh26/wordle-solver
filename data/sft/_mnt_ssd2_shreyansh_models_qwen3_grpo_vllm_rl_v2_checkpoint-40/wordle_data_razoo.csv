For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate many possibilities early on.

Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A strong first guess would use a mix of these letters without repeating any. 

Some excellent starting words are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, I, S, E) and has been shown to be one of the best starting words statistically.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word:
- A (not in positions 1 or 3)
- R (not in positions 2 or 2 again, so not in position 2)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- I, S, E (from ARISE)
- C, N, K (from CRANK)

So the hidden word contains A and R, and does not contain I, S, E, C, N, K.

Available letters left to try:
Vowels: O, U (A is already used, E and I are out)
Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, T, W, Y, etc.

We still need three more letters.  
We also know:
- A cannot be in position 1 or 3, so it must be in 2, 4, or 5.
- R cannot be in position 2, so it must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Let’s look for a word that:
1. Uses A and R
2. Uses only the still-allowed letters
3. Places A and R in new positions

Candidate words:
- RADIO – contains D, I (I is out)
- RADIO – invalid
- ROAST – contains S (out)
- BRAWL – contains B, R, A, W, L; all letters allowed; positions: R is 2 (disallowed), A is 3 (disallowed) → invalid
- GRAFT – contains G, R, A, F, T; all letters allowed; positions: R is 2 (disallowed) → invalid
- PARTY – contains P, A, R, T, Y; all letters allowed; positions: A is 2, R is 3 → both positions are still possible for A and R.

PARTY satisfies every constraint:
- Letters: P, A, R, T, Y – none of the forbidden ones.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- R is in position 3 (allowed).

Current knowledge:

Letters that are in the word but whose positions are still unknown:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate many possibilities early on.

Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A strong first guess would use a mix of these letters without repeating any. 

Some excellent starting words are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, I, S, E) and has been shown to be one of the best starting words statistically.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ARISE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2
- I(x) → I is NOT in the word
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively
- Does NOT contain I, S, or E
- Has 3 other letters still unknown

Letters we know are NOT in the word: I, S, E  
Letters we know ARE in the word: A, R (positions unknown)

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and R (since they’re confirmed)
2. Avoids I, S, E
3. Avoids positions 1 for A and 2 for R (unless those letters appear elsewhere)

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.  
Good vowels left: O, U (since A is already used, and I/E are out)

Let me think of words with A and R, avoiding I/S/E.  
Possible candidates: 
- RATIO – contains I and O (I is out)  
- RAPID – contains I and D (I is out)  
- CAROL – contains O and L (but A is in position 2, which is allowed)  
- DRAPE – contains E (out)  
- CRANK – good: C, R, A, N, K; uses A and R, avoids I/S/E; positions: A is 3, R is 2 – neither is fixed yet.

CRANK looks solid:
- C: new letter to test
- R: known in word (position 2 is still possible)
- A: known in word (position 3 is still possible)
- N: new letter
- K: new letter

No I, S, or E; re-uses no letters from ARISE beyond A and R.

From all feedback so far:

Known positions:
- Position 2: A (✓)
- Position 1: R (✓)

Known letters in word:
- R (positions 1 and 5 are ✓, so R is fixed at both ends)
- A (position 2 is ✓, so A is fixed here)

Forbidden letters: I, S, E, C, N, K, P, T, Y, D

So the word must look like: R A _ _ R

We need two more letters for positions 3 and 4, chosen from allowed letters:
Allowed letters left: B, F, G, H, L, M, O, U, W, etc.

We also know from earlier feedback:
- R is not in position 2 or 3 (already fixed at 1 and 5, so no conflict)
- A is not in positions 1 or 3 (already fixed at 2, so no conflict)

Let's find valid 5-letter words matching R A _ _ R with allowed letters.

Possible combinations:
- R A B _ R → RABAR (not a word), RABOR (not common)
- R A G _ R → RAGAR (not a word)
- R A L _ R → RALAR (not a word)
- R A M _ R → RAMAR (not a word)

- R A F U R → RAFUR (not a word)
- R A H U R → RAHUR (not a word)
- R A W U R → RAWUR (not a word)

Wait, let me think of actual English words:

- R A F _ R → RAFAR (not a word)
- R A H _ R → RAHAR (not a word)
- R A W _ R → RAWAR (not a word)

Hmm, none of these seem to be valid words. Let me reconsider.

Looking at valid English words that fit R A _ _ R:
- R A B E R → RABER (not common)

- R A L U R → RALUR (not a word)
- R A M U R → RAMUR (not a word)
- R A W U R → RAWUR (not a word)

From this, the valid words seem to be:
- RAGER (R A G E R)
- ROWER (R A W E R)

Let me check RAGER:
Letters: R, A, G, E, R
- E is forbidden (from ARISE feedback), so RAGER is invalid.

ROWER:
Letters: R, O, W, E, R
- E is forbidden, so ROWER is invalid.

Hmm, both seem to contain E. Let me think of other possibilities.

Looking at allowed letters again: B, F, G, H, L, M, O, U, W

Possible combinations for positions 3 and 4:
- B and O → R A B O R (not a word)

- R A F _ R → RAFAR (not a word)
- R A H _ R → RAHAR (not a word)
- R A W _ R → RAWAR (not a word)

Wait, I'm missing some words. Let me list all valid English words that fit R A _ _ R:
- R A B E R → RABER (not common)
- R A G E R → RAGER (invalid due to E)
- R A L E R → RALER (not common)
- R A M E R → RAMER (not common)

- R A H O R → RAHOR (not a word)
- R A L O R → RALOR (not a word)
- R A M O R → RAMOR (not a word)
- R A W O R → RAWOR (not a word)

It seems the only valid word left is RABER, but it's not common. However, looking back, RABER is actually a surname and may be accepted. Alternatively, let me check if I missed any letters.

Wait, I have forbidden letters: I, S, E, C, N, K, P, T, Y, D

Looking at R A B E R: contains E (forbidden) → invalid
R A G E R: contains E → invalid
R A L E R: contains E → invalid
R A M E R: contains E → invalid
R A B O R: no E → valid? But RABOR is not a standard word
R A G O R: no E → RAGOR is not a word
R A L O R: no E → RALOR is not a word
R A M O R: no E → RAMOR is not a word
R A W O R: no E → RAWOR is not a word
R A B U R: no E → RABUR is not a word
R A F U R → RAFUR is not a word
R A G U R → RAGUR is not a word
R A L U R → RALUR is not a word
R A M U R → RAMUR is not a word
R A W U R → RAWUR is not a word

This suggests the only possible word is RABOR, but it's not standard. However, looking at the remaining letters, let me try R A B O R even if it's not common, or perhaps I missed another word.

Wait, I think I missed R A M O R (RAMOR) is not a word, but let me think of R A B O R as a possible guess, or maybe R A G O R.

But none of these seem right. Let me reconsider the allowed letters and possible combinations.

Looking at allowed letters: B, F, G, H, L, M, O, U, W

Possible valid words:
- R A B O R (not standard)
- R A G O R (not standard)
- R A L O R (not standard)
- R A M O R (not standard)
- R A B U R (not standard)
- R A F U R (not standard)
- R A G U R (not standard)
- R A L U R (not standard)
- R A M U R (not standard)
- R A W U R (not standard)

This seems impossible. Let me check if I made an error earlier.

Wait, from Guess 4 feedback:
RADAR → R(✓) A(✓) D(x) A(-) R(-)

This means:
- R is correct in positions 1 and 5 → word is R A _ _ R
- A is correct in position 2 → word is R A _ _ R
- D is not in the word
- A is in the word but not in position 4 (already fixed at 2)
- R is in the word but not in position 5 (but we just established it must be in position 5 from the ✓)

This seems contradictory. Let me re-examine the feedback:

Guess 4: RADAR
Feedback: R(✓) A(✓) D(x) A(-) R(-)

This means:
- Position 1: R is correct (✓)
- Position 2: A is correct (✓)
- Position 3: D is not in the word (x)
- Position 4: A is in the word but not here (-)
- Position 5: R is in the word but not here (-)

But this creates a contradiction because:
- We already have R in position 1 (✓), so position 5 cannot have R (-)
- We have A in position 2 (✓), so position 4 cannot have A (-)

This implies the word must be R A _ _ _ with R not in position 5, but earlier we thought R must be in position 5. This suggests an error in interpretation.

Re-reading the feedback:
- R(✓) at position 1: R is correct in position 1
- A(✓) at position 2: A is correct in position 2
- D(x) at position 3: D is not in the word
- A(-) at position 4: A is in the word but not at position 4 (already correct at 2, so this is consistent)
- R(-) at position 5: R is in the word but not at position 5

This resolves the contradiction. So the word is R A _ _ _ and must contain R somewhere else (but position 1 already has R, so this is impossible). This suggests the word has only one R at position 1, and the feedback for position 5 is simply indicating R is in the word (already confirmed at position 1), so position 5's R is extra.

Thus the word is R A _ _ _ with no second R, but this contradicts the earlier feedback that R is in the word but not in position 2 or 3. This is getting too ambiguous.

Given the constraints:
- Word must start with R A
- Must not contain D, I, S, E, C, N, K, P, T, Y
- Must have A not in position 4 (already correct at 2)
- Must have R not in position 5 (so no second R)

Thus the word is R A _ _ _ with letters from B, F, G, H, L, M, O, U, W

Looking for valid words:
- R A B _ _ → RABID (contains I), RABOT (not a word)
- R A F _ _ → RAFID (not a word)
- R A G _ _ → RAGGA (not a word), RAGGY (contains Y)
- R A H _ _ → RAHAB (not a word)
- R A L _ _ → RALPH (contains P), RALTY (contains T, Y)
- R A M _ _ → RAMAL (not a word), RAMBO (contains O and B), RAMON (contains N)
- R A O _ _ → RAON (contains N), RAOUL (contains U, L)
- R A U _ _ → RAUCA (not a word)
- R A W _ _ → RACON (contains C, N), RAVEN (contains E, N)

From these, the closest valid words seem to be:
- RAMBO (R A M B O) - but contains O which is allowed
- RAUL (but is 4 letters)
- RAOUL (5 letters: R A O U L)

Let me check RAOUL:
- R A O U L
- Letters: R, A, O, U, L - none are forbidden
- R is in position 1 (✓)
- A is in position 2 (✓)
- O, U, L are new letters
- No D, I, S, E, C, N, K, P, T, Y

This seems valid. RAOUL is a 5-letter word meaning a surname or a river in France.

Thus, the next guess should be RAOUL.
</think>

Based on the feedback, we now know:
- The word is R A _ _ _ (R in position 1, A in position 2)
- Forbidden letters: I, S, E, C, N, K, P, T, Y, D
- Allowed letters for positions 3,4,5: B, F, G, H, L, M, O, U, W

Looking for valid 5-letter words starting with RA and using only allowed letters, ""RAOUL"" fits perfectly.

R A L E R: contains E → invalid
R A M E R: contains E → invalid
R A B O R: no E → valid? But RABOR is not a standard word
R A G O R: no E → RAGOR is not a word
R A L O R: no E → RALOR is not a word
R A M O R: no E → RAMOR is not a word
R A W O R: no E → RAWOR is not a word
R A B U R: no E → RABUR is not a word
R A F U R → RAFUR is not a word
R A G U R → RAGUR is not a word
R A L U R → RALUR is not a word
R A M U R → RAMUR is not a word
R A W U R → RAWUR is not a word

This suggests the only possible word is RABOR, but it's not standard. However, looking at the remaining letters, let me try R A B O R even if it's not common, or perhaps I missed another word.

Wait, I think I missed R A M O R (RAMOR) is not a word, but let me think of R A B O R as a possible guess, or maybe R A G O R.

But none of these seem right. Let me reconsider the allowed letters and possible combinations.

Looking at allowed letters: B, F, G, H, L, M, O, U, W

Possible valid words:
- R A B O R (not standard)
- R A G O R (not standard)
- R A L O R (not standard)
- R A M O R (not standard)
- R A B U R (not standard)
- R A F U R (not standard)
- R A G U R (not standard)
- R A L U R (not standard)
- R A M U R (not standard)
- R A W U R (not standard)

This seems impossible. Let me check if I made an error earlier.

Wait, from Guess 4 feedback:
RADAR → R(✓) A(✓) D(x) A(-) R(-)

This means:
- R is correct in positions 1 and 5 → word is R A _ _ R
- A is correct in position 2 → word is R A _ _ R
- D is not in the word
- A is in the word but not in position 4 (already fixed at 2)
- R is in the word but not in position 5 (but we just established it must be in position 5 from the ✓)

This seems contradictory. Let me re-examine the feedback:

Guess 4: RADAR
Feedback: R(✓) A(✓) D(x) A(-) R(-)

This means:
- Position 1: R is correct (✓)
- Position 2: A is correct (✓)
- Position 3: D is not in the word (x)
- Position 4: A is in the word but not here (-)
- Position 5: R is in the word but not here (-)

But this creates a contradiction because:
- We already have R in position 1 (✓), so position 5 cannot have R (-)
- We have A in position 2 (✓), so position 4 cannot have A (-)

This implies the word must be R A _ _ _ with R not in position 5, but earlier we thought R must be in position 5. This suggests an error in interpretation.

Re-reading the feedback:
- R(✓) at position 1: R is correct in position 1
- A(✓) at position 2: A is correct in position 2
- D(x) at position 3: D is not in the word
- A(-) at position 4: A is in the word but not at position 4 (already correct at 2, so this is consistent)
- R(-) at position 5: R is in the word but not at position 5

This resolves the contradiction. So the word is R A _ _ _ and must contain R somewhere else (but position 1 already has R, so this is impossible). This suggests the word has only one R at position 1, and the feedback for position 5 is simply indicating R is in the word (already confirmed at position 1), so position 5's R is extra.

Thus the word is R A _ _ _ with no second R, but this contradicts the earlier feedback that R is in the word but not in position 2 or 3. This is getting too ambiguous.

Given the constraints:
- Word must start with R A
- Must not contain D, I, S, E, C, N, K, P, T, Y
- Must have A not in position 4 (already correct at 2)
- Must have R not in position 5 (so no second R)

Thus the word is R A _ _ _ with letters from B, F, G, H, L, M, O, U, W

Looking for valid words:
- R A B _ _ → RABID (contains I), RABOT (not a word)
- R A F _ _ → RAFID (not a word)
- R A G _ _ → RAGGA (not a word), RAGGY (contains Y)
- R A H _ _ → RAHAB (not a word)
- R A L _ _ → RALPH (contains P), RALTY (contains T, Y)
- R A M _ _ → RAMAL (not a word), RAMBO (contains O and B), RAMON (contains N)
- R A O _ _ → RAON (contains N), RAOUL (contains U, L)
- R A U _ _ → RAUCA (not a word)
- R A W _ _ → RACON (contains C, N), RAVEN (contains E, N)

From these, the closest valid words seem to be:
- RAMBO (R A M B O) - but contains O which is allowed
- RAUL (but is 4 letters)
- RAOUL (5 letters: R A O U L)

Let me check RAOUL:
- R A O U L
- Letters: R, A, O, U, L - none are forbidden
- R is in position 1 (✓)
- A is in position 2 (✓)
- O, U, L are new letters
- No D, I, S, E, C, N, K, P, T, Y

This seems valid. RAOUL is a 5-letter word meaning a surname or a river in France.

Thus, the next guess should be RAOUL.Based on the feedback, we now know:
- The word is R A _ _ _ (R in position 1, A in position 2)
- Forbidden letters: I, S, E, C, N, K, P, T, Y, D
- Allowed letters for positions 3,4,5: B, F, G, H, L, M, O, U, W

Looking for valid 5-letter words starting with RA and using only allowed letters, ""RAOUL"" fits perfectly.",Guess 5: RAOUL -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) O(-) U(x) L(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate many possibilities early on.

Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A strong first guess would use a mix of these letters without repeating any. 

Some excellent starting words are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, I, S, E) and has been shown to be one of the best starting words statistically.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ARISE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2
- I(x) → I is NOT in the word
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively
- Does NOT contain I, S, or E
- Has 3 other letters still unknown

Letters we know are NOT in the word: I, S, E  
Letters we know ARE in the word: A, R (positions unknown)

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and R (since they’re confirmed)
2. Avoids I, S, E
3. Avoids positions 1 for A and 2 for R (unless those letters appear elsewhere)

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.  
Good vowels left: O, U (since A is already used, and I/E are out)

Let me think of words with A and R, avoiding I/S/E.  
Possible candidates: 
- RATIO – contains I and O (I is out)  
- RAPID – contains I and D (I is out)  
- CAROL – contains O and L (but A is in position 2, which is allowed)  
- DRAPE – contains E (out)  
- CRANK – good: C, R, A, N, K; uses A and R, avoids I/S/E; positions: A is 3, R is 2 – neither is fixed yet.

CRANK looks solid:
- C: new letter to test
- R: known in word (position 2 is still possible)
- A: known in word (position 3 is still possible)
- N: new letter
- K: new letter

No I, S, or E; re-uses no letters from ARISE beyond A and R.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word:
- A (not in positions 1 or 3)
- R (not in positions 2 or 2 again, so not in position 2)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- I, S, E (from ARISE)
- C, N, K (from CRANK)

So the hidden word contains A and R, and does not contain I, S, E, C, N, K.

Available letters left to try:
Vowels: O, U (A is already used, E and I are out)
Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, T, W, Y, etc.

We still need three more letters.  
We also know:
- A cannot be in position 1 or 3, so it must be in 2, 4, or 5.
- R cannot be in position 2, so it must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Let’s look for a word that:
1. Uses A and R
2. Uses only the still-allowed letters
3. Places A and R in new positions

Candidate words:
- RADIO – contains D, I (I is out)
- RADIO – invalid
- ROAST – contains S (out)
- BRAWL – contains B, R, A, W, L; all letters allowed; positions: R is 2 (disallowed), A is 3 (disallowed) → invalid
- GRAFT – contains G, R, A, F, T; all letters allowed; positions: R is 2 (disallowed) → invalid
- PARTY – contains P, A, R, T, Y; all letters allowed; positions: A is 2, R is 3 → both positions are still possible for A and R.

PARTY satisfies every constraint:
- Letters: P, A, R, T, Y – none of the forbidden ones.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- R is in position 3 (allowed).

Current knowledge:

Letters that are in the word and their positions:
- A is in position 2 (✓).

Letters that are in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
- R (not in positions 2 or 3).

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- I, S, E, C, N, K, P, T, Y.

So the hidden word looks like: _ A _ _ _
and must contain R somewhere in positions 1, 4, or 5.

Allowed letters left (excluding the forbidden ones):
Vowels: O, U (A is already placed)
Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, W, etc.

We need three more letters (positions 1, 3, 5) chosen from the allowed set, and one of them must be R.

Possible patterns:
- R A _ _ _
- _ A _ R _
- _ A _ _ R

Let’s look for a word that fits one of these patterns and uses only allowed letters.

Candidate words:
- R A _ _ _: RABID (contains I and D – I is out), RAGGY (contains G twice – allowed), RADAR (contains D and second R – allowed)
- _ A _ R _: BARGE (contains G and E – E is out), LARKS (contains S – out), MARRY (contains Y – out)
- _ A _ _ R: GARBs (plural of garb – allowed), LARBS (slang – acceptable), MARSH (contains S – out)

From these, RADAR fits the pattern R A D A R:
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (✓)
- D in position 3 (allowed)
- A in position 4 (allowed)
- R in position 5 (allowed)

All letters are allowed and no forbidden letters are used.

From all feedback so far:

Known positions:
- Position 2: A (✓)
- Position 1: R (✓)

Known letters in word:
- R (positions 1 and 5 are ✓, so R is fixed at both ends)
- A (position 2 is ✓, so A is fixed here)

Forbidden letters: I, S, E, C, N, K, P, T, Y, D

So the word must look like: R A _ _ R

We need two more letters for positions 3 and 4, chosen from allowed letters:
Allowed letters left: B, F, G, H, L, M, O, U, W, etc.

We also know from earlier feedback:
- R is not in position 2 or 3 (already fixed at 1 and 5, so no conflict)
- A is not in positions 1 or 3 (already fixed at 2, so no conflict)

Let's find valid 5-letter words matching R A _ _ R with allowed letters.

Possible combinations:
- R A B _ R → RABAR (not a word), RABOR (not common)
- R A G _ R → RAGAR (not a word)
- R A L _ R → RALAR (not a word)
- R A M _ R → RAMAR (not a word)
- R A O _ R → RAORO (not a word)
- R A U _ R → RAUAR (not a word)
- R A F _ R → RAFAR (not a word)
- R A H _ R → RAHAR (not a word)
- R A W _ R → RAWAR (not a word)
- R A B O R → RABOR (not a word)
- R A G G R → RAGGR (not a word)
- R A L L R → RALLR (not a word)
- R A M M R → RAMMR (not a word)
- R A O O R → RAOOR (not a word)
- R A U U R → RAUUR (not a word)
- R A B U R → RABUR (not a word)
- R A F U R → RAFUR (not a word)
- R A H U R → RAHUR (not a word)
- R A W U R → RAWUR (not a word)

Wait, let me think of actual English words:
- R A B _ R → RABAR (not a word)
- R A G _ R → RAGAR (not a word)
- R A L _ R → RALAR (not a word)
- R A M _ R → RAMAR (not a word)
- R A O _ R → RAORO (not a word)
- R A U _ R → RAUAR (not a word)
- R A F _ R → RAFAR (not a word)
- R A H _ R → RAHAR (not a word)
- R A W _ R → RAWAR (not a word)

Hmm, none of these seem to be valid words. Let me reconsider.

Looking at valid English words that fit R A _ _ R:
- R A B E R → RABER (not common)
- R A G E R → RAGER (valid word)
- R A L E R → RALER (not common)
- R A M E R → RAMER (not common)
- R A B E R → RABER (not common)
- R A F E R → RAFE R (not a word)
- R A H E R → RAHER (not a word)
- R A W E R → ROWER (valid word)
- R A B O R → RABOR (not a word)
- R A G O R → RAGOR (not a word)
- R A L O R → RALOR (not a word)
- R A M O R → RAMOR (not a word)
- R A W O R → RAWOR (not a word)
- R A B U R → RABUR (not a word)
- R A G U R → RAGUR (not a word)
- R A L U R → RALUR (not a word)
- R A M U R → RAMUR (not a word)
- R A W U R → RAWUR (not a word)

From this, the valid words seem to be:
- RAGER (R A G E R)
- ROWER (R A W E R)

Let me check RAGER:
Letters: R, A, G, E, R
- E is forbidden (from ARISE feedback), so RAGER is invalid.

ROWER:
Letters: R, O, W, E, R
- E is forbidden, so ROWER is invalid.

Hmm, both seem to contain E. Let me think of other possibilities.

Looking at allowed letters again: B, F, G, H, L, M, O, U, W

Possible combinations for positions 3 and 4:
- B and O → R A B O R (not a word)
- B and U → R A B U R (not a word)
- F and O → R A F O R (not a word)
- G and O → R A G O R (not a word)
- H and O → R A H O R (not a word)
- L and O → R A L O R (not a word)
- M and O → R A M O R (not a word)
- B and G → R A B G R (not a word)
- B and H → R A B H R (not a word)
- F and G → R A F G R (not a word)
- G and H → R A G H R (not a word)
- L and G → R A L G R (not a word)
- M and G → R A M G R (not a word)
- B and M → R A B M R (not a word)
- F and M → R A F M R (not a word)
- G and M → R A G M R (not a word)
- L and M → R A L M R (not a word)
- H and M → R A H M R (not a word)
- O and U → R A O U R (not a word)
- U and W → R A U W R (not a word)
- B and W → R A B W R (not a word)
- F and W → R A F W R (not a word)
- G and W → R A G W R (not a word)
- L and W → R A L W R (not a word)
- M and W → R A M W R (not a word)
- H and W → R A H W R (not a word)
- O and G → R A O G R (not a word)
- O and L → R A O L R (not a word)
- O and M → R A O M R (not a word)
- U and G → R A U G R (not a word)
- U and L → R A U L R (not a word)
- U and M → R A U M R (not a word)
- W and G → R A W G R (not a word)
- W and L → R A W L R (not a word)
- W and M → R A W M R (not a word)

This is tricky. Let me think of actual words:
- R A B _ R → RABAR (not a word)
- R A G _ R → RAGAR (not a word)
- R A L _ R → RALAR (not a word)
- R A M _ R → RAMAR (not a word)
- R A O _ R → RAORO (not a word)
- R A U _ R → RAUAR (not a word)
- R A F _ R → RAFAR (not a word)
- R A H _ R → RAHAR (not a word)
- R A W _ R → RAWAR (not a word)

Wait, I'm missing some words. Let me list all valid English words that fit R A _ _ R:
- R A B E R → RABER (not common)
- R A G E R → RAGER (invalid due to E)
- R A L E R → RALER (not common)
- R A M E R → RAMER (not common)
- R A B O R → RABOR (not a word)
- R A G O R → RAGOR (not a word)
- R A L O R → RALOR (not a word)
- R A M O R → RAMOR (not a word)
- R A W O R → RAWOR (not a word)
- R A B U R → RABUR (not a word)
- R A F U R → RAFUR (not a word)
- R A G U R → RAGUR (not a word)
- R A L U R → RALUR (not a word)
- R A M U R → RAMUR (not a word)
- R A W U R → RAWUR (not a word)
- R A B O R → RABOR (not a word)
- R A F O R → RAFOR (not a word)
- R A H O R → RAHOR (not a word)
- R A L O R → RALOR (not a word)
- R A M O R → RAMOR (not a word)
- R A W O R → RAWOR (not a word)

It seems the only valid word left is RABER, but it's not common. However, looking back, RABER is actually a surname and may be accepted. Alternatively, let me check if I missed any letters.

Wait, I have forbidden letters: I, S, E, C, N, K, P, T, Y, D

Looking at R A B E R: contains E (forbidden) → invalid
R A G E R: contains E → invalid
R A L E R: contains E → invalid
R A M E R: contains E → invalid
R A B O R: no E → valid? But RABOR is not a standard word
R A G O R: no E → RAGOR is not a word
R A L O R: no E → RALOR is not a word
R A M O R: no E → RAMOR is not a word
R A W O R: no E → RAWOR is not a word
R A B U R: no E → RABUR is not a word
R A F U R → RAFUR is not a word
R A G U R → RAGUR is not a word
R A L U R → RALUR is not a word
R A M U R → RAMUR is not a word
R A W U R → RAWUR is not a word

This suggests the only possible word is RABOR, but it's not standard. However, looking at the remaining letters, let me try R A B O R even if it's not common, or perhaps I missed another word.

Wait, I think I missed R A M O R (RAMOR) is not a word, but let me think of R A B O R as a possible guess, or maybe R A G O R.

But none of these seem right. Let me reconsider the allowed letters and possible combinations.

Looking at allowed letters: B, F, G, H, L, M, O, U, W

Possible valid words:
- R A B O R (not standard)
- R A G O R (not standard)
- R A L O R (not standard)
- R A M O R (not standard)
- R A B U R (not standard)
- R A F U R (not standard)
- R A G U R (not standard)
- R A L U R (not standard)
- R A M U R (not standard)
- R A W U R (not standard)

This seems impossible. Let me check if I made an error earlier.

Wait, from Guess 4 feedback:
RADAR → R(✓) A(✓) D(x) A(-) R(-)

This means:
- R is correct in positions 1 and 5 → word is R A _ _ R
- A is correct in position 2 → word is R A _ _ R
- D is not in the word
- A is in the word but not in position 4 (already fixed at 2)
- R is in the word but not in position 5 (but we just established it must be in position 5 from the ✓)

This seems contradictory. Let me re-examine the feedback:

Guess 4: RADAR
Feedback: R(✓) A(✓) D(x) A(-) R(-)

This means:
- Position 1: R is correct (✓)
- Position 2: A is correct (✓)
- Position 3: D is not in the word (x)
- Position 4: A is in the word but not here (-)
- Position 5: R is in the word but not here (-)

But this creates a contradiction because:
- We already have R in position 1 (✓), so position 5 cannot have R (-)
- We have A in position 2 (✓), so position 4 cannot have A (-)

This implies the word must be R A _ _ _ with R not in position 5, but earlier we thought R must be in position 5. This suggests an error in interpretation.

Re-reading the feedback:
- R(✓) at position 1: R is correct in position 1
- A(✓) at position 2: A is correct in position 2
- D(x) at position 3: D is not in the word
- A(-) at position 4: A is in the word but not at position 4 (already correct at 2, so this is consistent)
- R(-) at position 5: R is in the word but not at position 5

This resolves the contradiction. So the word is R A _ _ _ and must contain R somewhere else (but position 1 already has R, so this is impossible). This suggests the word has only one R at position 1, and the feedback for position 5 is simply indicating R is in the word (already confirmed at position 1), so position 5's R is extra.

Thus the word is R A _ _ _ with no second R, but this contradicts the earlier feedback that R is in the word but not in position 2 or 3. This is getting too ambiguous.

Given the constraints:
- Word must start with R A
- Must not contain D, I, S, E, C, N, K, P, T, Y
- Must have A not in position 4 (already correct at 2)
- Must have R not in position 5 (so no second R)

Thus the word is R A _ _ _ with letters from B, F, G, H, L, M, O, U, W

Looking for valid words:
- R A B _ _ → RABID (contains I), RABOT (not a word)
- R A F _ _ → RAFID (not a word)
- R A G _ _ → RAGGA (not a word), RAGGY (contains Y)
- R A H _ _ → RAHAB (not a word)
- R A L _ _ → RALPH (contains P), RALTY (contains T, Y)
- R A M _ _ → RAMAL (not a word), RAMBO (contains O and B), RAMON (contains N)
- R A O _ _ → RAON (contains N), RAOUL (contains U, L)
- R A U _ _ → RAUCA (not a word)
- R A W _ _ → RACON (contains C, N), RAVEN (contains E, N)

From these, the closest valid words seem to be:
- RAMBO (R A M B O) - but contains O which is allowed
- RAUL (but is 4 letters)
- RAOUL (5 letters: R A O U L)

Let me check RAOUL:
- R A O U L
- Letters: R, A, O, U, L - none are forbidden
- R is in position 1 (✓)
- A is in position 2 (✓)
- O, U, L are new letters
- No D, I, S, E, C, N, K, P, T, Y

This seems valid. RAOUL is a 5-letter word meaning a surname or a river in France.

Thus, the next guess should be RAOUL.Based on the feedback, we now know:
- The word is R A _ _ _ (R in position 1, A in position 2)
- Forbidden letters: I, S, E, C, N, K, P, T, Y, D
- Allowed letters for positions 3,4,5: B, F, G, H, L, M, O, U, W

Looking for valid 5-letter words starting with RA and using only allowed letters, ""RAOUL"" fits perfectly.

Let me re-examine the feedback:\n\nGuess 4: RADAR\nFeedback: R(✓) A(✓) D(x) A(-) R(-)\n\nThis means:\n- Position 1: R is correct (✓)\n- Position 2: A is correct (✓)\n- Position 3: D is not in the word (x)\n- Position 4: A is in the word but not here (-)\n- Position 5: R is in the word but not here (-)\n\nBut this creates a contradiction because:\n- We already have R in position 1 (✓), so position 5 cannot have R (-)\n- We have A in position 2 (✓), so position 4 cannot have A (-)\n\nThis implies the word must be R A _ _ _ with R not in position 5, but earlier we thought R must be in position 5. This suggests an error in interpretation.\n\nRe-reading the feedback:\n- R(✓) at position 1: R is correct in position 1\n- A(✓) at position 2: A is correct in position 2\n- D(x) at position 3: D is not in the word\n- A(-) at position 4: A is in the word but not at position 4 (already correct at 2, so this is consistent)\n- R(-) at position 5: R is in the word but not at position 5\n\nThis resolves the contradiction. So the word is R A _ _ _ and must contain R somewhere else (but position 1 already has R, so this is impossible). This suggests the word has only one R at position 1, and the feedback for position 5 is simply indicating R is in the word (already confirmed at position 1), so position 5\'s R is extra.\n\nThus the word is R A _ _ _ with no second R, but this contradicts the earlier feedback that R is in the word but not in position 2 or 3. This is getting too ambiguous.\n\nGiven the constraints:\n- Word must start with R A\n- Must not contain D, I, S, E, C, N, K, P, T, Y\n- Must have A not in position 4 (already correct at 2)\n- Must have R not in position 5 (so no second R)\n\nThus the word is R A _ _ _ with letters from B, F, G, H, L, M, O, U, W\n\nLooking for valid words:\n- R A B _ _ → RABID (contains I), RABOT (not a word)\n- R A F _ _ → RAFID (not a word)\n- R A G _ _ → RAGGA (not a word), RAGGY (contains Y)\n- R A H _ _ → RAHAB (not a word)\n- R A L _ _ → RALPH (contains P), RALTY (contains T, Y)\n- R A M _ _ → RAMAL (not a word), RAMBO (contains O and B), RAMON (contains N)\n- R A O _ _ → RAON (contains N), RAOUL (contains U, L)\n- R A U _ _ → RAUCA (not a word)\n- R A W _ _ → RACON (contains C, N), RAVEN (contains E, N)\n\nFrom these, the closest valid words seem to be:\n- RAMBO (R A M B O) - but contains O which is allowed\n- RAUL (but is 4 letters)\n- RAOUL (5 letters: R A O U L)\n\nLet me check RAOUL:\n- R A O U L\n- Letters: R, A, O, U, L - none are forbidden\n- R is in position 1 (✓)\n- A is in position 2 (✓)\n- O, U, L are new letters\n- No D, I, S, E, C, N, K, P, T, Y\n\nThis seems valid. RAOUL is a 5-letter word meaning a surname or a river in France.\n\nThus, the next guess should be RAOUL.Based on the feedback, we now know:\n- The word is R A _ _ _ (R in position 1, A in position 2)\n- Forbidden letters: I, S, E, C, N, K, P, T, Y, D\n- Allowed letters for positions 3,4,5: B, F, G, H, L, M, O, U, W\n\nLooking for valid 5-letter words starting with RA and using only allowed letters, ""RAOUL"" fits perfectly.\n\n<guess>RAOUL</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: CRANK -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) K(x)\nGuess 3: PARTY -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(-) T(x) Y(x)\nGuess 4: RADAR -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) D(x) A(-) R(-)\nGuess 5: RAOUL -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) O(-) U(x) L(x)\n'}]","<think>
