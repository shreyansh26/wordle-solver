### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or more letters in the secret word. 

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it covers S, L, A, T, E. However, ""AROSE"" might be slightly better due to the inclusion of O which is very common. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess since it's a well-balanced starting word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains R and S.
- It does not contain A, O, or E.
- R is not in position 2 and S is not in position 4.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R and S.
2. Does not contain A, O, or E.
3. Places R somewhere other than position 2 and S somewhere other than position 4.

Good consonants to try next are T, N, L, D, C, etc. Vowels left to try are I and U. Let’s aim for a word that uses common letters and satisfies the constraints.

A good candidate is “TRIPS”:
- Contains R and S.
- No A, O, E.
- R is in position 2 (but feedback said R is NOT in position 2), so this is invalid.

Next candidate: “FIRST” – but it has an E (indirectly), and we know E is out.

Next: “CRISP”:
- Contains R and S.
- No A, O, E.
- R is in position 3 (allowed), S is in position 4 (but feedback says S is not in position 4) – invalid.

Next: “DRIPS”:
- Contains R and S.
- No A, O, E.
- R is in position 2 – invalid (same issue).

Next: “STRIP”:
- Contains R and S.
- No A, O, E.
- R is in position 3 (allowed), S is in position 1 (allowed).
This looks valid.

Let me double-check:
- Letters: S, T, R, I, P – none of A, O, E.
- R is in position 3 (not 2) – ok.
- S is in position 1 (not 4) – ok.

   - S is in the word but **not** in positions 1 or 4  
   - I is in the word but **not** in position 4  

So the hidden word contains R, S, I and two other letters that are **not** among A, O, E, T, P.  
Available consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Available vowels: U (only vowel left besides I)

Let’s try to place the known letters:
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → possible positions: 1, 4, 5  
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4 → possible positions: 2, 3, 5  
- I cannot be in position 4 → possible positions: 1, 2, 3, 5  

We need two more letters. To maximize information, pick common letters that haven’t been ruled out yet: N and U are good choices (U is the only remaining vowel).

Candidate words:
- R I N S U → “RINUS” (not a valid English word)  
- S I N G R → “SINGR” (invalid)

- F U R S I → “FURSI” (invalid)  
- B U R I S → “BURIS” (invalid)  
- S U R I N → “SURIN” (valid but rare)  

A better common word is “CRISP” but P is ruled out.  
Next: “DRIPS” – P ruled out.  
Next: “GRINS” – G, R, I, N, S:  
   - G (new, allowed)  
   - R in position 2 – but R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE feedback) → invalid  

Next: “GRINS” is invalid due to R in position 2.

Next: “BRISK” – B, R, I, S, K:  
   - B (allowed)  
   - R in position 2 – invalid  

Next: “FRISK” – F, R, I, S, K:  
   - R in position 2 – invalid  

Next: “DRISL” – invalid.  

Next: “SURGE” – E ruled out.  

Next: “SURFY” – Y allowed, but F, U, R, Y:  
   - S is missing → invalid  

We need a word that uses R, S, I plus two new letters.  
Try “SIR” + two new letters:  
   - “SIR” + “N” + “U” → “SINUR” (invalid)

   - “S” in position 2, “I” in position 3, “R” in position 5:  
      “U” and “N” left → “USINR” (invalid)  

A valid English word that fits: “CURSI” (but C, U, R, S, I) – but “CURSI” is a medical term (plural of cursive), and may be obscure.  

Better: “SCRIN” (archaic for a narrow strip) – but rare.  

Another valid word: “FURSI” (plural of furse, obsolete) – still obscure.  

A more common word: “BRUIS” – but not valid.  

Next: “GRINS” already considered.  

Next: “DRIPS” – P ruled out.  

Next: “CRISP” – P ruled out.  

Next: “TRIPS” – T ruled out.  

Next: “URINS” – valid (plural of urna, medical term) – but rare.  

Next: “SURIN” – valid (a type of tree) – but rare.  

Next: “CURIO” – O ruled out.  

Next: “CURVE” – E ruled out.  

Next: “CURVE” – invalid.  

Next: “CURDY” – D, Y allowed, but missing S and I.  

We need a word that contains R, S, I and two new letters.  
Let’s try “S” in position 3, “I” in position 2, “R” in position 5:  
   New letters: U and N → “USNIR” (invalid)  

Try “S” in position 5, “I” in position 2, “R” in position 1:  
   New letters: U and N → “RUSIN” (valid, a type of tree resin) – but rare.  

Next: “S” in position 3, “I” in position 1, “R” in position 5:

Next: “S” in position 2, “I” in position 1, “R” in position 5:  
   New letters: U and N → “IUSNR” (invalid)  

Next: “S” in position 3, “I” in position 5, “R” in position 1:  
   New letters: U and N → “RUSIN” (same as above)  

Next: “S” in position 2, “I” in position 3, “R” in position 5:  
   New letters: U and N → “UNISR” (invalid)  

Next: “S” in position 5, “I” in position 3, “R” in position 1:  
   New letters: U and N → “RUSIN” (valid, but rare)  

Given the constraints, the best valid word is “RUSIN” (a resinous substance).  
It contains R, S, I and two new letters U and N, and satisfies the positional constraints:
   - R is in position 1 (allowed: 1, 4, 5)  
   - S is in position 5 (allowed: 2, 3, 5)  
   - I is in position 3 (allowed: 1, 2, 3, 5)  

“RUSIN” is the most plausible next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or more letters in the secret word. 

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it covers S, L, A, T, E. However, ""AROSE"" might be slightly better due to the inclusion of O which is very common. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess since it's a well-balanced starting word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains R and S.
- It does not contain A, O, or E.
- R is not in position 2 and S is not in position 4.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R and S.
2. Does not contain A, O, or E.
3. Places R somewhere other than position 2 and S somewhere other than position 4.

Good consonants to try next are T, N, L, D, C, etc. Vowels left to try are I and U. Let’s aim for a word that uses common letters and satisfies the constraints.

A good candidate is “TRIPS”:
- Contains R and S.
- No A, O, E.
- R is in position 2 (but feedback said R is NOT in position 2), so this is invalid.

Next candidate: “FIRST” – but it has an E (indirectly), and we know E is out.

Next: “CRISP”:
- Contains R and S.
- No A, O, E.
- R is in position 3 (allowed), S is in position 4 (but feedback says S is not in position 4) – invalid.

Next: “DRIPS”:
- Contains R and S.
- No A, O, E.
- R is in position 2 – invalid (same issue).

Next: “STRIP”:
- Contains R and S.
- No A, O, E.
- R is in position 3 (allowed), S is in position 1 (allowed).
This looks valid.

Let me double-check:
- Letters: S, T, R, I, P – none of A, O, E.
- R is in position 3 (not 2) – ok.
- S is in position 1 (not 4) – ok.

“STRIP” meets all constraints.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are **not** in the word: A, O, E, T, P  
2. Letters that **are** in the word: R, S, I  
   - R is in the word but **not** in positions 2 or 3  
   - S is in the word but **not** in positions 1 or 4  
   - I is in the word but **not** in position 4  

So the hidden word contains R, S, I and two other letters that are **not** among A, O, E, T, P.  
Available consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Available vowels: U (only vowel left besides I)

Let’s try to place the known letters:
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → possible positions: 1, 4, 5  
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4 → possible positions: 2, 3, 5  
- I cannot be in position 4 → possible positions: 1, 2, 3, 5  

We need two more letters. To maximize information, pick common letters that haven’t been ruled out yet: N and U are good choices (U is the only remaining vowel).

Candidate words:
- R I N S U → “RINUS” (not a valid English word)  
- S I N G R → “SINGR” (invalid)  
- C R I S N → “CRISN” (invalid)

From the new feedback on RUSIN:

- Position 1: R
- Position 2: must be a letter that is either I or another consonant (but I could be here)
- Position 3: S
- Position 4: unknown (but I is somewhere else)
- Position 5: unknown

Since I must be in the word (from STRIP feedback) and not in position 4, I must be in position 2 or 5.

- Need a consonant in position 4 and 5. Possible endings: ""RISKS"" (but K is allowed), ""RISMS"" (M allowed), ""RISBS"" (B allowed), etc. ""RISKS"" is a valid word meaning to risk something.

For R _ S _ I:
- Need a consonant in position 2 and 4. Possible: ""RBSI"" (invalid), ""RCSI"" (invalid), ""RDSI"" (invalid), ""RFSI"" (invalid), ""RHSI"" (invalid), ""RLSI"" (invalid), ""RMSI"" (invalid), ""RWSI"" (invalid), ""RYSI"" (invalid). None seem valid.

Thus, ""RISKS"" seems the most promising word that fits all constraints:
- R in position 1 (✓)
- I in position 2 (allowed, since I is not in position 4)
- S in position 3 (✓)
- K and S in positions 4 and 5 (K and S are allowed letters not yet ruled out)

Let me verify:
- Letters: R, I, S, K, S
- R and S are confirmed in their correct positions.
- I is in the word (from STRIP) and not in position 4 (here it's in 2) - allowed.
- K is a new letter not yet tested - acceptable.
- S is repeated, but that's allowed in Wordle.

Thus, ""RISKS"" is a valid guess.

<guess>RISKS</guess>",RISKS,"From the new feedback on RUSIN:
- R(✓) – R is in the word and in the correct position 1.
- U(x) – U is not in the word.
- S(✓) – S is in the word and in the correct position 3.
- I(-) – I is in the word but not in position 4.
- N(x) – N is not in the word.

So we now know:
1. Letters not in the word: A, O, E, T, P, U, N
2. Letters in the word and their positions:
   - Position 1: R
   - Position 3: S
3. Letters in the word but whose positions are not yet fixed:
   - I (not in position 4)

We still need to determine positions 2 and 5. The remaining letters must come from the unused alphabet excluding the known absent letters. Available consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. Available vowels: none left (only I is left, and it must go in position 2 or 5).

We have:
- Position 1: R
- Position 2: must be a letter that is either I or another consonant (but I could be here)
- Position 3: S
- Position 4: unknown (but I is somewhere else)
- Position 5: unknown

Since I must be in the word (from STRIP feedback) and not in position 4, I must be in position 2 or 5.

Let’s consider possible words:
- R _ S _ _
- R I S _ _  (I in position 2)
- R _ S _ I  (I in position 5)
