### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the word.

Another strong contender is ""SLATE"" - it has S, L, T (common consonants) and A, E (common vowels). 

Between these, ""AROSE"" might be slightly better positioned because it covers more unique vowels, but both are excellent choices. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).\n\nOne of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S).

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - A and R are not in the word.

2. HOUSE → H(x) O(✓) U(x) S(-) E(✓)
   - O is confirmed in position 2.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - H and U are not in the word.

3. SONIC → S(-) O(✓) N(x) I(x) C(x)
   - O is confirmed in position 2.
   - S is in the word but not in position 1 (and already known not in 4).
   - N, I, C are not in the word.

Current constraints:
- Word pattern: _ O _ _ E
- S must be in position 3 (only remaining possible position: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 2=O, 5=E, 1 and 4 are excluded for S, so 3 is the only spot left).
- Letters not allowed: A, R, H, U, N, I, C.
- Allowed letters (common ones left): T, L, D, G, B, M, F, Y, etc.

Thus the word must be: _ O S _ E
We need two letters for positions 1 and 4 from the allowed set.
