For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by using common letters. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters without repeating any, to test as many unique letters as possible.

One of the best starting words according to Wordle strategy is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 unique high-frequency letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many 5-letter words. This gives us good coverage to narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

Other strong candidates could be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O and the distribution of vowels/consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in the word and in the 3rd position.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- 3rd letter is O.
- S appears somewhere else (positions 1, 2, or 5).
- A, R, E are excluded.
- We still need to test other common letters like T, L, N, I, C, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep O in the 3rd position.
2. Include S in a different position (1, 2, or 5).
3. Introduce new common letters not yet tested.

Possible words:
- STONE (but E is excluded)
- SPOIL (but I and L are new, but P hasn't been tested)
- SNOUT (but U hasn't been tested)
- SHOWN (but H and W haven't been tested)
- STONY (but Y hasn't been tested)

""SHOWN"" has S in position 1, H and W are new consonants, O is in position 3, and N is also new. This seems like a good spread.

Another option is ""STOIC"" but C hasn't been tested and we might want to test more consonants.

""SHOWN"" seems better as it tests S, H, W, N, O.

But wait, O is fixed in position 3, so ""SHOWN"" would be S-H-O-W-N, which has O in position 3. This fits.

Let me verify: S is in the word (from feedback), O is in position 3, and we're testing H, W, N. This seems optimal.

Actually, ""STOIC"" might be better as it tests T and C which are common, but we have S(-) from AROSE meaning S is in the word but not position 4, so S could be 1,2,3,5. O is 3, so S could be 1,2,5.

""STOIC"" has S in 1, T in 2, O in 3, I in 4, C in 5. This tests T and C, and I is a new vowel.

But from feedback, AROSE had A(x), R(x), O(✓), S(-), E(x). So vowels tested so far: A, O, E. Missing I and U. Including I or U would be good.

""STOIC"" includes I, which is good. But S is in position 1 here, which is allowed.

Another option: ""SPOIL"" - S in 1, P new, O in 3, I in 4, L new. But P is less common than T or N.

""SNOUT"" - S in 1, N new, O in 3, U new, T new. Tests U which is a vowel not yet tested.

Between ""STOIC"" and ""SNOUT"", ""STOIC"" tests more common letters (T, C) and includes I.

But ""SHOWN"" tests H and W which are less common. Maybe ""STOIC"" is better.

Wait, let's think differently - we have O in position 3, S somewhere else. We haven't tested T, L, N, I, C, etc.

""STOIC"" seems good, but let me consider ""SNORT"" - but R is excluded from feedback.

""SNOWY"" - but Y is less common.

""STONY"" - tests T, N, Y. But Y is less common.

""STOIC"" seems better with T and C.

But actually, ""STOIC"" has C which is less common than N or T.

Another angle: from AROSE feedback, S is in word but not position 4. So possible positions: 1,2,3,5. But O is in position 3, so S could be 1,2,5.

Looking for words with O in 3rd and S in 1,2, or 5.

Examples:
- S _ O _ _ (SPOIL, STOIC, SLOTH, etc.)
- _ S O _ _ (COSSE, DOSER, etc.)
- _ _ O _ S (BLONS, etc.)

""SPOIL"" has S in 1, P new, O in 3, I new, L new. Tests P, I, L.

""STOIC"" has S in 1, T new, O in 3, I new, C new.

""SNORT"" - R is excluded.

""SNOUT"" - S in 1, N new, O in 3, U new, T new.

Between these, ""SPOIL"" seems good as P, I, L are all new and common.

But ""STOIC"" has T which is very common.

I think ""STOIC"" is a strong choice.

Wait, but from feedback, AROSE had S(-) meaning S is in the word but not position 4. So S could be 1,2,3,5. But O is in 3, so S could be 1,2,5.

""STOIC"" has S in 1, which is allowed.

But let me think of another word: ""SONIC"" - S in 1, O in 3, N new, I new, C new. This tests N and C, and I.

""SONIC"" seems good.

Between ""STOIC"" and ""SONIC"", ""SONIC"" tests N instead of T, which might be better.

I think ""SONIC"" is a strong next guess.
</think>

Based on the feedback:
- O is in the correct position (3rd letter).
- S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- A, R, E are not in the word.

A good next guess is ""SONIC"" because:
- It keeps O in the 3rd position.
- It places S in the 1st position (testing a new position for S).
- It introduces new letters: N, I, C.

Let’s tabulate what we now know.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A, R, E are NOT in the word.
- O is in the word and is in position 3.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

From Guess 2 (SONIC):
- S is in the word AND in position 1 (✓).
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).  
  (This contradicts Guess 1 where O was marked ✓ in position 3.  
  The only way both can be true is if O is in position 3 and also appears elsewhere, which is impossible in a 5-letter word.  
  Therefore the feedback must be read carefully: the second guess SONIC has O in position 2, and the feedback “O(-)” means that letter is in the word but not in position 2.  
  The ✓ in position 1 for S is definitive: S is first letter.)

So:
- S is fixed in position 1.
- O is in the word but not in position 2 (from SONIC) and not in position 4 (from AROSE).  
  Possible positions for O: 2, 3, 5.  
  But from AROSE, O was marked ✓ in position 3, so O must be in position 3.  
  (The contradiction resolved: in SONIC, O was in position 2, so the “-” means it’s not there; the ✓ from AROSE already locked O in position 3.)

Other letters:
- N is in the word but not in position 3 (from SONIC).
- I and C are NOT in the word.
- A, R, E are NOT in the word.

So far:
1: S

Letters still to place: N (not in 3), plus two more unknown letters (positions 2 and 5).

Common letters not yet tested: T, L, D, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, with O in position 3, containing N somewhere (but not in position 3), and using only unexcluded letters.

Possible patterns:
S _ O _ _
with N in position 2, 4, or 5.

Examples:
- S N O T _  (need 5th letter)
- S _ O N _  
- S _ O _ N  

Let’s pick “SNORT”:
- S in 1 ✓
- N in 2 (allowed, since N not in 3)
- O in 3 ✓
- R is excluded (from AROSE), so “SNORT” is invalid.

Next try “SPOON”:
- P and second O not yet tested, but we only have one O confirmed.  
  Also, double O might be unlikely, and we don’t know if there are duplicates.

Try “SLOTH”:
- L, T, H new; O in 3 ✓; S in 1 ✓; but H not yet tested.  
  However, N must be in the word (from SONIC feedback), so “SLOTH” is invalid.

We must include N.

Possible word: “SPOON” – but double O and P is new.  
Another: “SLOAN” – but A is excluded.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by using common letters. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters without repeating any, to test as many unique letters as possible.

One of the best starting words according to Wordle strategy is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 unique high-frequency letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many 5-letter words. This gives us good coverage to narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

Other strong candidates could be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O and the distribution of vowels/consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in the word and in the 3rd position.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- 3rd letter is O.
- S appears somewhere else (positions 1, 2, or 5).
- A, R, E are excluded.
- We still need to test other common letters like T, L, N, I, C, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep O in the 3rd position.
2. Include S in a different position (1, 2, or 5).
3. Introduce new common letters not yet tested.

Possible words:
- STONE (but E is excluded)
- SPOIL (but I and L are new, but P hasn't been tested)
- SNOUT (but U hasn't been tested)
- SHOWN (but H and W haven't been tested)
- STONY (but Y hasn't been tested)

""SHOWN"" has S in position 1, H and W are new consonants, O is in position 3, and N is also new. This seems like a good spread.

Another option is ""STOIC"" but C hasn't been tested and we might want to test more consonants.

""SHOWN"" seems better as it tests S, H, W, N, O.

But wait, O is fixed in position 3, so ""SHOWN"" would be S-H-O-W-N, which has O in position 3. This fits.

Let me verify: S is in the word (from feedback), O is in position 3, and we're testing H, W, N. This seems optimal.

Actually, ""STOIC"" might be better as it tests T and C which are common, but we have S(-) from AROSE meaning S is in the word but not position 4, so S could be 1,2,3,5. O is 3, so S could be 1,2,5.

""STOIC"" has S in 1, T in 2, O in 3, I in 4, C in 5. This tests T and C, and I is a new vowel.

But from feedback, AROSE had A(x), R(x), O(✓), S(-), E(x). So vowels tested so far: A, O, E. Missing I and U. Including I or U would be good.

""STOIC"" includes I, which is good. But S is in position 1 here, which is allowed.

Another option: ""SPOIL"" - S in 1, P new, O in 3, I in 4, L new. But P is less common than T or N.

""SNOUT"" - S in 1, N new, O in 3, U new, T new. Tests U which is a vowel not yet tested.

Between ""STOIC"" and ""SNOUT"", ""STOIC"" tests more common letters (T, C) and includes I.

But ""SHOWN"" tests H and W which are less common. Maybe ""STOIC"" is better.

Wait, let's think differently - we have O in position 3, S somewhere else. We haven't tested T, L, N, I, C, etc.

""STOIC"" seems good, but let me consider ""SNORT"" - but R is excluded from feedback.

""SNOWY"" - but Y is less common.

""STONY"" - tests T, N, Y. But Y is less common.

""STOIC"" seems better with T and C.

But actually, ""STOIC"" has C which is less common than N or T.

Another angle: from AROSE feedback, S is in word but not position 4. So possible positions: 1,2,3,5. But O is in position 3, so S could be 1,2,5.

Looking for words with O in 3rd and S in 1,2, or 5.

Examples:
- S _ O _ _ (SPOIL, STOIC, SLOTH, etc.)
- _ S O _ _ (COSSE, DOSER, etc.)
- _ _ O _ S (BLONS, etc.)

""SPOIL"" has S in 1, P new, O in 3, I new, L new. Tests P, I, L.

""STOIC"" has S in 1, T new, O in 3, I new, C new.

""SNORT"" - R is excluded.

""SNOUT"" - S in 1, N new, O in 3, U new, T new.

Between these, ""SPOIL"" seems good as P, I, L are all new and common.

But ""STOIC"" has T which is very common.

I think ""STOIC"" is a strong choice.

Wait, but from feedback, AROSE had S(-) meaning S is in the word but not position 4. So S could be 1,2,3,5. But O is in 3, so S could be 1,2,5.

""STOIC"" has S in 1, which is allowed.

But let me think of another word: ""SONIC"" - S in 1, O in 3, N new, I new, C new. This tests N and C, and I.

""SONIC"" seems good.

Between ""STOIC"" and ""SONIC"", ""SONIC"" tests N instead of T, which might be better.

I think ""SONIC"" is a strong next guess.Based on the feedback:
- O is in the correct position (3rd letter).
- S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- A, R, E are not in the word.

A good next guess is ""SONIC"" because:
- It keeps O in the 3rd position.
- It places S in the 1st position (testing a new position for S).
- It introduces new letters: N, I, C.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by using common letters. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters without repeating any, to test as many unique letters as possible.

One of the best starting words according to Wordle strategy is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 unique high-frequency letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many 5-letter words. This gives us good coverage to narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

Other strong candidates could be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O and the distribution of vowels/consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in the word and in the 3rd position.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- 3rd letter is O.
- S appears somewhere else (positions 1, 2, or 5).
- A, R, E are excluded.
- We still need to test other common letters like T, L, N, I, C, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep O in the 3rd position.
2. Include S in a different position (1, 2, or 5).
3. Introduce new common letters not yet tested.

Possible words:
- STONE (but E is excluded)
- SPOIL (but I and L are new, but P hasn't been tested)
- SNOUT (but U hasn't been tested)
- SHOWN (but H and W haven't been tested)
- STONY (but Y hasn't been tested)

""SHOWN"" has S in position 1, H and W are new consonants, O is in position 3, and N is also new. This seems like a good spread.

Another option is ""STOIC"" but C hasn't been tested and we might want to test more consonants.

""SHOWN"" seems better as it tests S, H, W, N, O.

But wait, O is fixed in position 3, so ""SHOWN"" would be S-H-O-W-N, which has O in position 3. This fits.

Let me verify: S is in the word (from feedback), O is in position 3, and we're testing H, W, N. This seems optimal.

Actually, ""STOIC"" might be better as it tests T and C which are common, but we have S(-) from AROSE meaning S is in the word but not position 4, so S could be 1,2,3,5. O is 3, so S could be 1,2,5.

""STOIC"" has S in 1, T in 2, O in 3, I in 4, C in 5. This tests T and C, and I is a new vowel.

But from feedback, AROSE had A(x), R(x), O(✓), S(-), E(x). So vowels tested so far: A, O, E. Missing I and U. Including I or U would be good.

""STOIC"" includes I, which is good. But S is in position 1 here, which is allowed.

Another option: ""SPOIL"" - S in 1, P new, O in 3, I in 4, L new. But P is less common than T or N.

""SNOUT"" - S in 1, N new, O in 3, U new, T new. Tests U which is a vowel not yet tested.

Between ""STOIC"" and ""SNOUT"", ""STOIC"" tests more common letters (T, C) and includes I.

But ""SHOWN"" tests H and W which are less common. Maybe ""STOIC"" is better.

Wait, let's think differently - we have O in position 3, S somewhere else. We haven't tested T, L, N, I, C, etc.

""STOIC"" seems good, but let me consider ""SNORT"" - but R is excluded from feedback.

""SNOWY"" - but Y is less common.

""STONY"" - tests T, N, Y. But Y is less common.

""STOIC"" seems better with T and C.

But actually, ""STOIC"" has C which is less common than N or T.

Another angle: from AROSE feedback, S is in word but not position 4. So possible positions: 1,2,3,5. But O is in position 3, so S could be 1,2,5.

Looking for words with O in 3rd and S in 1,2, or 5.

Examples:
- S _ O _ _ (SPOIL, STOIC, SLOTH, etc.)
- _ S O _ _ (COSSE, DOSER, etc.)
- _ _ O _ S (BLONS, etc.)

""SPOIL"" has S in 1, P new, O in 3, I new, L new. Tests P, I, L.

""STOIC"" has S in 1, T new, O in 3, I new, C new.

""SNORT"" - R is excluded.

""SNOUT"" - S in 1, N new, O in 3, U new, T new.

Between these, ""SPOIL"" seems good as P, I, L are all new and common.

But ""STOIC"" has T which is very common.

I think ""STOIC"" is a strong choice.

Wait, but from feedback, AROSE had S(-) meaning S is in the word but not position 4. So S could be 1,2,3,5. But O is in 3, so S could be 1,2,5.

""STOIC"" has S in 1, which is allowed.

But let me think of another word: ""SONIC"" - S in 1, O in 3, N new, I new, C new. This tests N and C, and I.

""SONIC"" seems good.

Between ""STOIC"" and ""SONIC"", ""SONIC"" tests N instead of T, which might be better.

I think ""SONIC"" is a strong next guess.Based on the feedback:
- O is in the correct position (3rd letter).
- S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- A, R, E are not in the word.

A good next guess is ""SONIC"" because:
- It keeps O in the 3rd position.
- It places S in the 1st position (testing a new position for S).
- It introduces new letters: N, I, C.

Let’s tabulate what we now know.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A, R, E are NOT in the word.
- O is in the word and is in position 3.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

From Guess 2 (SONIC):
- S is in the word AND in position 1 (✓).
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).  
  (This contradicts Guess 1 where O was marked ✓ in position 3.  
  The only way both can be true is if O is in position 3 and also appears elsewhere, which is impossible in a 5-letter word.  
  Therefore the feedback must be read carefully: the second guess SONIC has O in position 2, and the feedback “O(-)” means that letter is in the word but not in position 2.  
  The ✓ in position 1 for S is definitive: S is first letter.)

So:
- S is fixed in position 1.
- O is in the word but not in position 2 (from SONIC) and not in position 4 (from AROSE).  
  Possible positions for O: 2, 3, 5.  
  But from AROSE, O was marked ✓ in position 3, so O must be in position 3.  
  (The contradiction resolved: in SONIC, O was in position 2, so the “-” means it’s not there; the ✓ from AROSE already locked O in position 3.)

Other letters:
- N is in the word but not in position 3 (from SONIC).
- I and C are NOT in the word.
- A, R, E are NOT in the word.

So far:
1: S
3: O
Letters still to place: N (not in 3), plus two more unknown letters (positions 2 and 5).

Common letters not yet tested: T, L, D, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, with O in position 3, containing N somewhere (but not in position 3), and using only unexcluded letters.

Possible patterns:
S _ O _ _
with N in position 2, 4, or 5.

Examples:
- S N O T _  (need 5th letter)
- S _ O N _  
- S _ O _ N  

Let’s pick “SNORT”:
- S in 1 ✓
- N in 2 (allowed, since N not in 3)
- O in 3 ✓
- R is excluded (from AROSE), so “SNORT” is invalid.

Next try “SPOON”:
- P and second O not yet tested, but we only have one O confirmed.  
  Also, double O might be unlikely, and we don’t know if there are duplicates.

Try “SLOTH”:
- L, T, H new; O in 3 ✓; S in 1 ✓; but H not yet tested.  
  However, N must be in the word (from SONIC feedback), so “SLOTH” is invalid.

We must include N.  
Pattern: S _ O _ N (positions 1,3,5 fixed as S, O, N)

Possible word: “SPOON” – but double O and P is new.  
Another: “SLOAN” – but A is excluded.

“STOCK” – C excluded.

“SUGON” – U, G new, but is it a word?

“SNOOK” – K new, but double O and K uncommon.

“SWORD” – R excluded, D new.

“SWORN” – R excluded.

“SWOON” – R excluded.

“SPOON” – R excluded (no, R is excluded, P is new).

Wait, let’s list valid letters left: S, O, N are placed; remaining pool: T, L, D, U, Y, H, etc.

Pattern: S _ O _ N  
Possible 2nd letter: T, L, D, U, Y, H.

“STON” is 4 letters.

“STONY” – Y new, is a word.

“STONY”:
- S(1) ✓

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)  
   ⇒ O is in position 3.  
   ⇒ S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

2. SONIC → S(✓) O(-) N(-) I(x) C(x)  
   ⇒ S is in position 1 (✓).  
   ⇒ O is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
   ⇒ N is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   ⇒ I and C are NOT in the word.

3. STONY → S(✓) T(x) O(✓) N(-) Y(x)  
   ⇒ S is in position 1 (✓).  
   ⇒ T and Y are NOT in the word.  
   ⇒ O is in position 3 (✓).  
   ⇒ N is in the word but NOT in position 4.

Current fixed letters:
- Position 1: S
- Position 3: O

Letters still to place:
- N (must be in position 2 or 5, since it cannot be in 3,4)
- Two more distinct letters (positions 2 and 5) from the remaining unused alphabet, excluding A, R, E, I, C, T, Y.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z (and N).

We have two cases for N:
a) N in position 2 → word pattern: S N O _ _  
   Need two more letters for positions 4 and 5.

b) N in position 5 → word pattern: S _ O _ N  
   Need two more letters for positions 2 and 4.

Let’s explore both cases.

Case a) S N O _ _  
   Possible letters left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z  
   Need two distinct letters from these.  
   Example valid words: SNOWP (not a word), SNOUT (T excluded), SNOOK (K allowed), SNOOP (P allowed).  
   “SNOOK” is a valid 5-letter word (fish).  
   Letters: S, N, O, O, K → but O is already in position 3; duplicate O would require second O to be placed, but we have no info on duplicates.  
   “SNOOK” uses K which is new.

Case b) S _ O _ N  
   Possible letters for position 2: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z  
   Possible letters for position 4: same list.  
   Example: S P O K N (not a word), S L O P N (not a word), S H O O N (double O again), S L O G N (not a word).  
   “SHOWN” is a valid word: S H O W N.  
   Letters: S, H, O, W, N.  
   All letters are new except O and N which fit constraints.

Between “SNOOK” and “SHOWN”, “SHOWN” is more common and uses H and W which are new.

Let’s choose “SHOWN”.

A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters without repeating any, to test as many unique letters as possible.\n\nOne of the best starting words according to Wordle strategy is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 unique high-frequency letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many 5-letter words. This gives us good coverage to narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.\n\nOther strong candidates could be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O and the distribution of vowels/consonants.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A(x) → A is not in the word.\n- R(x) → R is not in the word.\n- O(✓) → O is in the word and in the 3rd position.\n- S(-) → S is in the word but not in the 4th position.\n- E(x) → E is not in the word.\n\nSo we know:\n- 3rd letter is O.\n- S appears somewhere else (positions 1, 2, or 5).\n- A, R, E are excluded.\n- We still need to test other common letters like T, L, N, I, C, etc.\n\nA good next guess should:\n1. Keep O in the 3rd position.\n2. Include S in a different position (1, 2, or 5).\n3. Introduce new common letters not yet tested.\n\nPossible words:\n- STONE (but E is excluded)\n- SPOIL (but I and L are new, but P hasn\'t been tested)\n- SNOUT (but U hasn\'t been tested)\n- SHOWN (but H and W haven\'t been tested)\n- STONY (but Y hasn\'t been tested)\n\n""SHOWN"" has S in position 1, H and W are new consonants, O is in position 3, and N is also new. This seems like a good spread.\n\nAnother option is ""STOIC"" but C hasn\'t been tested and we might want to test more consonants.\n\n""SHOWN"" seems better as it tests S, H, W, N, O.\n\nBut wait, O is fixed in position 3, so ""SHOWN"" would be S-H-O-W-N, which has O in position 3. This fits.\n\nLet me verify: S is in the word (from feedback), O is in position 3, and we\'re testing H, W, N. This seems optimal.\n\nActually, ""STOIC"" might be better as it tests T and C which are common, but we have S(-) from AROSE meaning S is in the word but not position 4, so S could be 1,2,3,5. O is 3, so S could be 1,2,5.\n\n""STOIC"" has S in 1, T in 2, O in 3, I in 4, C in 5. This tests T and C, and I is a new vowel.\n\nBut from feedback, AROSE had A(x), R(x), O(✓), S(-), E(x). So vowels tested so far: A, O, E. Missing I and U. Including I or U would be good.\n\n""STOIC"" includes I, which is good. But S is in position 1 here, which is allowed.\n\nAnother option: ""SPOIL"" - S in 1, P new, O in 3, I in 4, L new. But P is less common than T or N.\n\n""SNOUT"" - S in 1, N new, O in 3, U new, T new. Tests U which is a vowel not yet tested.\n\nBetween ""STOIC"" and ""SNOUT"", ""STOIC"" tests more common letters (T, C) and includes I.\n\nBut ""SHOWN"" tests H and W which are less common. Maybe ""STOIC"" is better.\n\nWait, let\'s think differently - we have O in position 3, S somewhere else. We haven\'t tested T, L, N, I, C, etc.\n\n""STOIC"" seems good, but let me consider ""SNORT"" - but R is excluded from feedback.\n\n""SNOWY"" - but Y is less common.\n\n""STONY"" - tests T, N, Y. But Y is less common.\n\n""STOIC"" seems better with T and C.\n\nBut actually, ""STOIC"" has C which is less common than N or T.\n\nAnother angle: from AROSE feedback, S is in word but not position 4. So possible positions: 1,2,3,5. But O is in position 3, so S could be 1,2,5.\n\nLooking for words with O in 3rd and S in 1,2, or 5.\n\nExamples:\n- S _ O _ _ (SPOIL, STOIC, SLOTH, etc.)\n- _ S O _ _ (COSSE, DOSER, etc.)\n- _ _ O _ S (BLONS, etc.)\n\n""SPOIL"" has S in 1, P new, O in 3, I new, L new. Tests P, I, L.\n\n""STOIC"" has S in 1, T new, O in 3, I new, C new.\n\n""SNORT"" - R is excluded.\n\n""SNOUT"" - S in 1, N new, O in 3, U new, T new.\n\nBetween these, ""SPOIL"" seems good as P, I, L are all new and common.\n\nBut ""STOIC"" has T which is very common.\n\nI think ""STOIC"" is a strong choice.\n\nWait, but from feedback, AROSE had S(-) meaning S is in the word but not position 4. So S could be 1,2,3,5. But O is in 3, so S could be 1,2,5.\n\n""STOIC"" has S in 1, which is allowed.\n\nBut let me think of another word: ""SONIC"" - S in 1, O in 3, N new, I new, C new. This tests N and C, and I.\n\n""SONIC"" seems good.\n\nBetween ""STOIC"" and ""SONIC"", ""SONIC"" tests N instead of T, which might be better.\n\nI think ""SONIC"" is a strong next guess.Based on the feedback:\n- O is in the correct position (3rd letter).\n- S is in the word but not in the 4th position.\n- A, R, E are not in the word.\n\nA good next guess is ""SONIC"" because:\n- It keeps O in the 3rd position.\n- It places S in the 1st position (testing a new position for S).\n- It introduces new letters: N, I, C.\n\n<guess>SONIC</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SONIC -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(-) N(-) I(x) C(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Let’s tabulate what we now know.\n\nFrom Guess 1 (AROSE):\n- A, R, E are NOT in the word.\n- O is in the word and is in position 3.\n- S is in the word but NOT in position 4.\n\nFrom Guess 2 (SONIC):\n- S is in the word AND in position 1 (✓).\n- O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).  \n  (This contradicts Guess 1 where O was marked ✓ in position 3.  \n  The only way both can be true is if O is in position 3 and also appears elsewhere, which is impossible in a 5-letter word.  \n  Therefore the feedback must be read carefully: the second guess SONIC has O in position 2, and the feedback “O(-)” means that letter is in the word but not in position 2.  \n  The ✓ in position 1 for S is definitive: S is first letter.)\n\nSo:\n- S is fixed in position 1.\n- O is in the word but not in position 2 (from SONIC) and not in position 4 (from AROSE).  \n  Possible positions for O: 2, 3, 5.  \n  But from AROSE, O was marked ✓ in position 3, so O must be in position 3.  \n  (The contradiction resolved: in SONIC, O was in position 2, so the “-” means it’s not there; the ✓ from AROSE already locked O in position 3.)\n\nOther letters:\n- N is in the word but not in position 3 (from SONIC).\n- I and C are NOT in the word.\n- A, R, E are NOT in the word.\n\nSo far:\n1: S\n3: O\nLetters still to place: N (not in 3), plus two more unknown letters (positions 2 and 5).\n\nCommon letters not yet tested: T, L, D, U, Y, etc.\n\nWe need a 5-letter word starting with S, with O in position 3, containing N somewhere (but not in position 3), and using only unexcluded letters.\n\nPossible patterns:\nS _ O _ _\nwith N in position 2, 4, or 5.\n\nExamples:\n- S N O T _  (need 5th letter)\n- S _ O N _  \n- S _ O _ N  \n\nLet’s pick “SNORT”:\n- S in 1 ✓\n- N in 2 (allowed, since N not in 3)\n- O in 3 ✓\n- R is excluded (from AROSE), so “SNORT” is invalid.\n\nNext try “SPOON”:\n- P and second O not yet tested, but we only have one O confirmed.  \n  Also, double O might be unlikely, and we don’t know if there are duplicates.\n\nTry “SLOTH”:\n- L, T, H new; O in 3 ✓; S in 1 ✓; but H not yet tested.  \n  However, N must be in the word (from SONIC feedback), so “SLOTH” is invalid.\n\nWe must include N.  \nPattern: S _ O _ N (positions 1,3,5 fixed as S, O, N)\n\nPossible word: “SPOON” – but double O and P is new.  \nAnother: “SLOAN” – but A is excluded.\n\n“STOCK” – C excluded.\n\n“SUGON” – U, G new, but is it a word?\n\n“SNOOK” – K new, but double O and K uncommon.\n\n“SWORD” – R excluded, D new.\n\n“SWORN” – R excluded.\n\n“SWOON” – R excluded.\n\n“SPOON” – R excluded (no, R is excluded, P is new).\n\nWait, let’s list valid letters left: S, O, N are placed; remaining pool: T, L, D, U, Y, H, etc.\n\nPattern: S _ O _ N  \nPossible 2nd letter: T, L, D, U, Y, H.\n\n“STON” is 4 letters.\n\n“STONY” – Y new, is a word.\n\n“STONY”:\n- S(1) ✓\n- T(2) new\n- O(3) ✓\n- N(4) new position (allowed, since N not in 3)\n- Y(5) new\n\nThis satisfies all constraints.\n\n<guess>STONY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SONIC -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(-) N(-) I(x) C(x)\nGuess 3: STONY -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) O(✓) N(-) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.\n\n1.

There is only one remaining valid English word that fits the pattern S N O W _: “SNOWY”, but Y is excluded.

Thus N must be in position 2.

Given the pattern S N O W _, and no valid word exists except “SNOWY” which uses excluded Y, the only logical conclusion is that the word contains a repeated letter or a less common spelling.

However, “SNOWY” is invalid due to Y.  
The next possibility is “SNOWS” – but S is already used in position 1 and duplicate S would require confirmation.

“SNOWS” is a valid word (plural of snow).  
Let’s check constraints:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by using common letters. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters without repeating any, to test as many unique letters as possible.

One of the best starting words according to Wordle strategy is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 unique high-frequency letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many 5-letter words. This gives us good coverage to narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

Other strong candidates could be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O and the distribution of vowels/consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in the word and in the 3rd position.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- 3rd letter is O.
- S appears somewhere else (positions 1, 2, or 5).
- A, R, E are excluded.
- We still need to test other common letters like T, L, N, I, C, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep O in the 3rd position.
2. Include S in a different position (1, 2, or 5).
3. Introduce new common letters not yet tested.

Possible words:
- STONE (but E is excluded)
- SPOIL (but I and L are new, but P hasn't been tested)
- SNOUT (but U hasn't been tested)
- SHOWN (but H and W haven't been tested)
- STONY (but Y hasn't been tested)

""SHOWN"" has S in position 1, H and W are new consonants, O is in position 3, and N is also new. This seems like a good spread.

Another option is ""STOIC"" but C hasn't been tested and we might want to test more consonants.

""SHOWN"" seems better as it tests S, H, W, N, O.

But wait, O is fixed in position 3, so ""SHOWN"" would be S-H-O-W-N, which has O in position 3. This fits.

Let me verify: S is in the word (from feedback), O is in position 3, and we're testing H, W, N. This seems optimal.

Actually, ""STOIC"" might be better as it tests T and C which are common, but we have S(-) from AROSE meaning S is in the word but not position 4, so S could be 1,2,3,5. O is 3, so S could be 1,2,5.

""STOIC"" has S in 1, T in 2, O in 3, I in 4, C in 5. This tests T and C, and I is a new vowel.

But from feedback, AROSE had A(x), R(x), O(✓), S(-), E(x). So vowels tested so far: A, O, E. Missing I and U. Including I or U would be good.

""STOIC"" includes I, which is good. But S is in position 1 here, which is allowed.

Another option: ""SPOIL"" - S in 1, P new, O in 3, I in 4, L new. But P is less common than T or N.

""SNOUT"" - S in 1, N new, O in 3, U new, T new. Tests U which is a vowel not yet tested.

Between ""STOIC"" and ""SNOUT"", ""STOIC"" tests more common letters (T, C) and includes I.

But ""SHOWN"" tests H and W which are less common. Maybe ""STOIC"" is better.

Wait, let's think differently - we have O in position 3, S somewhere else. We haven't tested T, L, N, I, C, etc.

""STOIC"" seems good, but let me consider ""SNORT"" - but R is excluded from feedback.

""SNOWY"" - but Y is less common.

""STONY"" - tests T, N, Y. But Y is less common.

""STOIC"" seems better with T and C.

But actually, ""STOIC"" has C which is less common than N or T.

Another angle: from AROSE feedback, S is in word but not position 4. So possible positions: 1,2,3,5. But O is in position 3, so S could be 1,2,5.

Looking for words with O in 3rd and S in 1,2, or 5.

Examples:
- S _ O _ _ (SPOIL, STOIC, SLOTH, etc.)
- _ S O _ _ (COSSE, DOSER, etc.)
- _ _ O _ S (BLONS, etc.)

""SPOIL"" has S in 1, P new, O in 3, I new, L new. Tests P, I, L.

""STOIC"" has S in 1, T new, O in 3, I new, C new.

""SNORT"" - R is excluded.

""SNOUT"" - S in 1, N new, O in 3, U new, T new.

Between these, ""SPOIL"" seems good as P, I, L are all new and common.

But ""STOIC"" has T which is very common.

I think ""STOIC"" is a strong choice.

Wait, but from feedback, AROSE had S(-) meaning S is in the word but not position 4. So S could be 1,2,3,5. But O is in 3, so S could be 1,2,5.

""STOIC"" has S in 1, which is allowed.

But let me think of another word: ""SONIC"" - S in 1, O in 3, N new, I new, C new. This tests N and C, and I.

""SONIC"" seems good.

Between ""STOIC"" and ""SONIC"", ""SONIC"" tests N instead of T, which might be better.

I think ""SONIC"" is a strong next guess.Based on the feedback:
- O is in the correct position (3rd letter).
- S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- A, R, E are not in the word.

A good next guess is ""SONIC"" because:
- It keeps O in the 3rd position.
- It places S in the 1st position (testing a new position for S).
- It introduces new letters: N, I, C.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SONIC -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(-) N(-) I(x) C(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s tabulate what we now know.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A, R, E are NOT in the word.
- O is in the word and is in position 3.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

From Guess 2 (SONIC):
- S is in the word AND in position 1 (✓).
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).  
  (This contradicts Guess 1 where O was marked ✓ in position 3.  
  The only way both can be true is if O is in position 3 and also appears elsewhere, which is impossible in a 5-letter word.  
  Therefore the feedback must be read carefully: the second guess SONIC has O in position 2, and the feedback “O(-)” means that letter is in the word but not in position 2.  
  The ✓ in position 1 for S is definitive: S is first letter.)

So:
- S is fixed in position 1.
- O is in the word but not in position 2 (from SONIC) and not in position 4 (from AROSE).  
  Possible positions for O: 2, 3, 5.  
  But from AROSE, O was marked ✓ in position 3, so O must be in position 3.  
  (The contradiction resolved: in SONIC, O was in position 2, so the “-” means it’s not there; the ✓ from AROSE already locked O in position 3.)

Other letters:
- N is in the word but not in position 3 (from SONIC).
- I and C are NOT in the word.
- A, R, E are NOT in the word.

So far:
1: S
3: O
Letters still to place: N (not in 3), plus two more unknown letters (positions 2 and 5).

Common letters not yet tested: T, L, D, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, with O in position 3, containing N somewhere (but not in position 3), and using only unexcluded letters.

Possible patterns:
S _ O _ _
with N in position 2, 4, or 5.

Examples:
- S N O T _  (need 5th letter)
- S _ O N _  
- S _ O _ N  

Let’s pick “SNORT”:
- S in 1 ✓
- N in 2 (allowed, since N not in 3)
- O in 3 ✓
- R is excluded (from AROSE), so “SNORT” is invalid.

Next try “SPOON”:
- P and second O not yet tested, but we only have one O confirmed.  
  Also, double O might be unlikely, and we don’t know if there are duplicates.

Try “SLOTH”:
- L, T, H new; O in 3 ✓; S in 1 ✓; but H not yet tested.  
  However, N must be in the word (from SONIC feedback), so “SLOTH” is invalid.

We must include N.  
Pattern: S _ O _ N (positions 1,3,5 fixed as S, O, N)

Possible word: “SPOON” – but double O and P is new.  
Another: “SLOAN” – but A is excluded.

“STOCK” – C excluded.

“SUGON” – U, G new, but is it a word?

“SNOOK” – K new, but double O and K uncommon.

“SWORD” – R excluded, D new.

“SWORN” – R excluded.

“SWOON” – R excluded.

“SPOON” – R excluded (no, R is excluded, P is new).

Wait, let’s list valid letters left: S, O, N are placed; remaining pool: T, L, D, U, Y, H, etc.

Pattern: S _ O _ N  
Possible 2nd letter: T, L, D, U, Y, H.

“STON” is 4 letters.

“STONY” – Y new, is a word.

“STONY”:
- S(1) ✓
- T(2) new
- O(3) ✓
- N(4) new position (allowed, since N not in 3)
- Y(5) new

This satisfies all constraints.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)  
   ⇒ O is in position 3.  
   ⇒ S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

2. SONIC → S(✓) O(-) N(-) I(x) C(x)  
   ⇒ S is in position 1 (✓).  
   ⇒ O is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
   ⇒ N is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   ⇒ I and C are NOT in the word.

3. STONY → S(✓) T(x) O(✓) N(-) Y(x)  
   ⇒ S is in position 1 (✓).  
   ⇒ T and Y are NOT in the word.  
   ⇒ O is in position 3 (✓).  
   ⇒ N is in the word but NOT in position 4.

Current fixed letters:
- Position 1: S
- Position 3: O

Letters still to place:
- N (must be in position 2 or 5, since it cannot be in 3,4)
- Two more distinct letters (positions 2 and 5) from the remaining unused alphabet, excluding A, R, E, I, C, T, Y.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z (and N).

We have two cases for N:
a) N in position 2 → word pattern: S N O _ _  
   Need two more letters for positions 4 and 5.

b) N in position 5 → word pattern: S _ O _ N  
   Need two more letters for positions 2 and 4.

Let’s explore both cases.

Case a) S N O _ _  
   Possible letters left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z  
   Need two distinct letters from these.  
   Example valid words: SNOWP (not a word), SNOUT (T excluded), SNOOK (K allowed), SNOOP (P allowed).  
   “SNOOK” is a valid 5-letter word (fish).  
   Letters: S, N, O, O, K → but O is already in position 3; duplicate O would require second O to be placed, but we have no info on duplicates.  
   “SNOOK” uses K which is new.

Case b) S _ O _ N  
   Possible letters for position 2: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z  
   Possible letters for position 4: same list.  
   Example: S P O K N (not a word), S L O P N (not a word), S H O O N (double O again), S L O G N (not a word).  
   “SHOWN” is a valid word: S H O W N.  
   Letters: S, H, O, W, N.  
   All letters are new except O and N which fit constraints.

Between “SNOOK” and “SHOWN”, “SHOWN” is more common and uses H and W which are new.

Let’s choose “SHOWN”.

Let’s extract every constraint revealed so far.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)  
   ⇒ O is in position 3.  
   ⇒ S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

2. SONIC → S(✓) O(-) N(-) I(x) C(x)  
   ⇒ S is in position 1 (✓).  
   ⇒ O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (already satisfied).  
   ⇒ N is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   ⇒ I and C are NOT in the word.

3. STONY → S(✓) T(x) O(✓) N(-) Y(x)  
   ⇒ T and Y are NOT in the word.  
   ⇒ N is in the word but NOT in position 4.

4. SHOWN → S(✓) H(x) O(✓) W(✓) N(-)  
   ⇒ H is NOT in the word.  
   ⇒ W is in the word and in position 4 (✓).  
   ⇒ N is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Current fixed letters:
- Position 1: S
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: W

Letters still to place:
- N (must be in position 2, since it cannot be in 3,4,5)
- One more letter for position 5, chosen from unused letters.

Pattern so far: S N O W _

Letters already excluded: A, R, E, I, C, T, Y, H.

Available letters for position 5: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, P, U, V, X, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form S N O W _.

The only common English word fitting this pattern is “SNOWY”, but Y is already excluded (from STONY feedback).

Next possible: “SNOWB” – not a word.  
“SNOWD” – not a word.  
“SNOWG” – not a word.  
“SNOWK” – not a word.  
“SNOWL” – not a word.  
“SNOWM” – not a word.  
“SNOWP” – not a word.  
“SNOWU” – not a word.  
“SNOWV” – not a word.  
“SNOWX” – not a word.  
“SNOWZ” – not a word.

There is only one remaining valid English word that fits the pattern S N O W _: “SNOWY”, but Y is excluded.  
This suggests we must have made an error in assuming N must be in position 2.

Re-examining N placement:
- From SONIC: N not in 3.
- From STONY: N not in 4.
- From SHOWN: N not in 5.
Thus N must be in position 2.

Given the pattern S N O W _, and no valid word exists except “SNOWY” which uses excluded Y, the only logical conclusion is that the word contains a repeated letter or a less common spelling.

However, “SNOWY” is invalid due to Y.  
The next possibility is “SNOWS” – but S is already used in position 1 and duplicate S would require confirmation.

“SNOWS” is a valid word (plural of snow).  
Let’s check constraints:
- S in position 1: ✓  
- N in position 2: allowed (no restriction on N in 2).  
- O in 3: ✓  
- W in 4: ✓  
- S in 5: duplicate S is allowed; original S only excluded from 4, so 5 is fine.

Thus, the correct guess is “SNOWS”.

From the latest feedback:

SNOWS → S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) W(✓) S(-)

1. S is in position 1 (✓).  
2. N is in position 2 (✓).  
3. O is in position 3 (✓).  
4. W is in position 4 (✓).  
5. The final S is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).

However, we already have S in position 1, and no rule prevents duplicate letters. The feedback simply tells us the final S is not in position 5, which is already satisfied because we have S in position 1. Thus, the word must be S N O W _ with the fifth letter being any valid letter except those already excluded.

Excluded letters so far: A, R, E, I, C, T, Y, H.  
Available letters for position 5: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, P, U, V, X, Z.

The only common 5-letter word matching S N O W _ is ""SNOWY"", but Y is excluded. The next valid word is ""SNOWS"", which we just tried. Since ""SNOWS"" got a (-) on the last S, the actual word must be ""SNOWB"", ""SNOWD"", etc., but these are not valid. 

Rechecking: The valid English word is ""SNOWY"", but Y is excluded. This implies the word must be ""SNOWS"" despite the (-) on the last S, as it's the only fit. However, the (-) indicates the last S is not in position 5, which is already true because S is in position 1. Thus, ""SNOWS"" is the intended word.

But wait, the feedback for ""SNOWS"" shows the last S as (-), meaning it's in the word but not in position 5. This is consistent because S is in position 1. Therefore, the word is ""SNOWS"".
