### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and frequently used consonants. After considering options like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", and ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"" stands out because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

3. Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, P, D.
4. N is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-).

So the pattern so far is:

Letters still allowed: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

- Starts with S

- Contains N somewhere other than position 4

Let's list candidates:
- S N E _ _  (N in position 2)
  - SNELL – contains L (excluded)
  - SNEER – valid, uses E twice (but E is already known to be in position 3)
  - SNEEK – valid

Let's consolidate what we now know:

1. Fixed letters:
   - Position 1: S (✓)
   - Position 3: E (✓)
   - Position 4: E (✓)

   So the pattern is: S _ E E _

2. Letters that are in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
   - N (-)  (it must appear somewhere, but NOT in position 2)

3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
   L, A, T, P, D, R

4. Therefore the word looks like: S _ E E N   (because N must be in position 5)

That gives us the pattern S _ E E N.

Now we just need to find the missing second letter. It must be a letter that:
- Has not been ruled out (not L, A, T, P, D, R)
- Is a valid English word when combined with S _ E E N

The only common 5-letter word that fits is ""SHENE"" – but that's not a valid English word.

Next possible letters for position 2: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Checking valid words:
- S B E E N → ""SBEEN"" – invalid
- S C E E N → ""SCENE"" – valid (though ""scene"" is often 4 letters)
- S H E E N → ""SHEN"" is 4 letters, but ""SHEN"" is not 5
- S W E E N → ""SWEEN"" – not a standard word
- S K E E N → ""SKENE"" – not standard
- S M E E N → ""SMEE"" is 4 letters
- S G E E N → ""SGEEN"" – invalid
- S F E E N → ""SFEEN"" – invalid
- S V E E N → ""SVEEN"" – invalid
- S W E E N → ""SWEEN"" – invalid
- S Y E E N → ""SYEEN"" – invalid
- S O E E N → ""SOEEN"" – invalid

The only valid 5-letter word that fits the pattern S _ E E N is ""SHEN"" plus an extra letter, but none seem valid. Rechecking, the actual valid word is ""SHEN"" but that's 4 letters. 

Wait, let's list all valid 5-letter words ending in ""EEN"":
- S C E E N – ""SCENE"" (valid, though rare)
- S H E E N – ""SHEN"" is 4 letters, but ""SHEN"" isn't 5
- S W E E N – invalid
- S K E E N – invalid

Actually, the correct valid word is ""SCENE"" (S-C-E-N-E), but our pattern is S _ E E N, which would require N in position 4, but N is excluded from position 4. 

This suggests an error in earlier steps. Let me re-examine:

From Guess 3 (SNEER) feedback:
- S(✓) N(-) E(✓) E(✓) R(x)

This means:
- N is in the word but NOT in position 2
- E is in positions 3 and 4 (✓)
- R is not in the word
- S is in position 1 (✓)

So the word is S _ E E _ and N must be in position 5 (since it can't be in 2). Thus: S _ E E N

Now checking valid 5-letter words: S _ E E N
- S C E E N – ""SCENE"" (valid, though rare)
- S H E E N – invalid
- S K E E N – invalid
- S M E E N – invalid
- S W E E N – invalid

The only valid word is ""SCENE"". Let's verify:
- S(✓) C _ E E N
- Letters used: S, C, E, N – all allowed
- N is in position 5, which is allowed (not excluded)
- No excluded letters

Thus, ""SCENE"" is the correct guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and frequently used consonants. After considering options like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", and ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"" stands out because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the correct first position (✓).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- L, A, T are not in the word at all (x).

So far we know:
1. Word starts with S
2. Contains E, but E is not in the 5th position
3. Does not contain L, A, T

We need a 5-letter word starting with S that includes E somewhere in positions 2-4 and avoids L, A, T.

Good candidates:
- SHINE (S, H, I, N, E) – E is in position 5, which we know is invalid
- SHEND (not a valid word)
- SPEND – valid, E in position 4
- SPOKE – E in position 4
- STONE – T is excluded
- SWINE – E in position 4
- SPECK – E in position 3

""SPEND"" seems like the strongest choice: starts with S, includes E in position 4, and avoids all excluded letters.

Current constraints from both guesses:

1. S is fixed in position 1 (✓).
2. E is in the word and is now known to be in position 3 (✓ from SPEND).
3. Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, P, D.
4. N is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-).

So the pattern so far is:
S _ E _ _

Letters still allowed: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
(plus any others not yet ruled out)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S
- Has E in position 3
- Contains N somewhere other than position 4
- Uses only allowed letters

Possible positions for N: 2 or 5 (since 1,3 are taken and 4 is excluded for N)

Let's list candidates:
- S N E _ _  (N in position 2)
  - SNELL – contains L (excluded)
  - SNEER – valid, uses E twice (but E is already known to be in position 3)
  - SNEEK – valid
- S _ E _ N  (N in position 5)
  - SHEND – invalid (D excluded)
  - SWEEN – valid
  - SKEEN – valid
  - SMEEN – valid

Among these, ""SNEER"" seems the most common and likely. It fits:
- S ✓
- N in position 2
- E in position 3 (✓)
- E in position 4 (allowed, since E can appear twice)
- R is a new letter to test

""SNEER"" is a valid English word and fits all constraints.

1. Fixed letters:
   - Position 1: S (✓)
   - Position 3: E (✓)
   - Position 4: E (✓)

   Pattern: S _ E E _

2. Letters that are in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
   - N (-)  (must appear, but not in positions 2, 4, or 5)

3. Letters that are NOT in the word:
   L, A, T, P, D, R, C

4. Therefore N must be in position 2 (the only remaining spot).

   Word must be: S N E E _

5. Now we need a 5-letter word that starts with SN and ends with EE_.

   Valid English words:
   - SNEER (already guessed, feedback was N(-) which is consistent with N not in position 2 - but wait, this seems contradictory)
   - SNEER was guess 3 and feedback was N(-) meaning N is in the word but not in position 2. However, we just deduced N must be in position 2, so SNEER cannot be the word.

   Next possible word: SNEER is invalid (N not in position 2). We need a word like SN E E _ where N is in position 2.

   Checking valid words:
   - SN E E _ : ""SNEEK"" is valid (variant spelling), but let's see if it fits all constraints.

   ""SNEEK"" uses letters S, N, E, E, K. All letters are allowed (not in the excluded list), and N is in position 2 which satisfies the requirement that N must be in position 2.

   Let's verify:
   - S(✓) N(-) E(✓) E(✓) K

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and frequently used consonants. After considering options like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", and ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"" stands out because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the correct first position (✓).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- L, A, T are not in the word at all (x).

So far we know:
1. Word starts with S
2. Contains E, but E is not in the 5th position
3. Does not contain L, A, T

We need a 5-letter word starting with S that includes E somewhere in positions 2-4 and avoids L, A, T.

Good candidates:
- SHINE (S, H, I, N, E) – E is in position 5, which we know is invalid
- SHEND (not a valid word)
- SPEND – valid, E in position 4
- SPOKE – E in position 4
- STONE – T is excluded
- SWINE – E in position 4
- SPECK – E in position 3

""SPEND"" seems like the strongest choice: starts with S, includes E in position 4, and avoids all excluded letters.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: SPEND -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) E(✓) N(-) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Current constraints from both guesses:

1. S is fixed in position 1 (✓).
2. E is in the word and is now known to be in position 3 (✓ from SPEND).
3. Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, P, D.
4. N is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-).

So the pattern so far is:
S _ E _ _

Letters still allowed: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
(plus any others not yet ruled out)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S
- Has E in position 3
- Contains N somewhere other than position 4
- Uses only allowed letters

Possible positions for N: 2 or 5 (since 1,3 are taken and 4 is excluded for N)

Let's list candidates:
- S N E _ _  (N in position 2)
  - SNELL – contains L (excluded)
  - SNEER – valid, uses E twice (but E is already known to be in position 3)
  - SNEEK – valid
- S _ E _ N  (N in position 5)
  - SHEND – invalid (D excluded)
  - SWEEN – valid
  - SKEEN – valid
  - SMEEN – valid

Among these, ""SNEER"" seems the most common and likely. It fits:
- S ✓
- N in position 2
- E in position 3 (✓)
- E in position 4 (allowed, since E can appear twice)
- R is a new letter to test

""SNEER"" is a valid English word and fits all constraints.

Let's consolidate what we now know:

1. Fixed letters:
   - Position 1: S (✓)
   - Position 3: E (✓)
   - Position 4: E (✓)

   So the pattern is: S _ E E _

2. Letters that are in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
   - N (-)  (it must appear somewhere, but NOT in position 2)

3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
   L, A, T, P, D, R

4. Therefore the word looks like: S _ E E N   (because N must be in position 5)

That gives us the pattern S _ E E N.

Now we just need to find the missing second letter. It must be a letter that:
- Has not been ruled out (not L, A, T, P, D, R)
- Is a valid English word when combined with S _ E E N

The only common 5-letter word that fits is ""SHENE"" – but that's not a valid English word.

Next possible letters for position 2: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Checking valid words:
- S B E E N → ""SBEEN"" – invalid
- S C E E N → ""SCENE"" – valid (though ""scene"" is often 4 letters)
- S H E E N → ""SHEN"" is 4 letters, but ""SHEN"" is not 5
- S W E E N → ""SWEEN"" – not a standard word
- S K E E N → ""SKENE"" – not standard
- S M E E N → ""SMEE"" is 4 letters
- S G E E N → ""SGEEN"" – invalid
- S F E E N → ""SFEEN"" – invalid
- S V E E N → ""SVEEN"" – invalid
- S W E E N → ""SWEEN"" – invalid
- S Y E E N → ""SYEEN"" – invalid
- S O E E N → ""SOEEN"" – invalid

The only valid 5-letter word that fits the pattern S _ E E N is ""SHEN"" plus an extra letter, but none seem valid. Rechecking, the actual valid word is ""SHEN"" but that's 4 letters. 

Wait, let's list all valid 5-letter words ending in ""EEN"":
- S C E E N – ""SCENE"" (valid, though rare)
- S H E E N – ""SHEN"" is 4 letters, but ""SHEN"" isn't 5
- S W E E N – invalid
- S K E E N – invalid

Actually, the correct valid word is ""SCENE"" (S-C-E-N-E), but our pattern is S _ E E N, which would require N in position 4, but N is excluded from position 4. 

This suggests an error in earlier steps. Let me re-examine:

From Guess 3 (SNEER) feedback:
- S(✓) N(-) E(✓) E(✓) R(x)

This means:
- N is in the word but NOT in position 2
- E is in positions 3 and 4 (✓)
- R is not in the word
- S is in position 1 (✓)

So the word is S _ E E _ and N must be in position 5 (since it can't be in 2). Thus: S _ E E N

Now checking valid 5-letter words: S _ E E N
- S C E E N – ""SCENE"" (valid, though rare)
- S H E E N – invalid
- S K E E N – invalid
- S M E E N – invalid
- S W E E N – invalid

The only valid word is ""SCENE"". Let's verify:
- S(✓) C _ E E N
- Letters used: S, C, E, N – all allowed
- N is in position 5, which is allowed (not excluded)
- No excluded letters

Thus, ""SCENE"" is the correct guess.

Let's summarize everything we now know after five guesses.

1. Fixed letters:
   - Position 1: S (✓)
   - Position 3: E (✓)
   - Position 4: E (✓)

   Pattern: S _ E E _

2. Letters that are in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
   - N (-)  (must appear, but not in positions 2, 4, or 5)
   - K (-)  (must appear, but not in position 5)

3. Letters that are NOT in the word:
   L, A, T, P, D, R, C

4. From the feedback on SNEEK (K(-)):
   - K is in the word but not in position 5.

5. Positions to fill:
   - Position 2 must be N (since N cannot be in positions 4 or 5, and position 3/4 are E's)
   - Position 5 must be K (since K cannot be in position 5, but all other positions are filled or excluded)

   Therefore the word must be: S N E E K

6. Check if this is a valid English word:
   - ""SNEEK"" is actually a valid variant spelling of ""sneer"" in some dialects, but more importantly, ""SNEEK"" is listed as a valid 5-letter word in standard word lists.

7. Verify all constraints:
   - S(✓) N(-) E(✓) E(✓) K(-)
   - N is in position 2 (allowed, since N must be in the word but not in positions 4 or 5)
   - K is in position 5, but feedback said K(-) meaning K is in the word but not in position 5. This seems like a contradiction.

Wait, this indicates an error in our deduction. Let's re-examine:

From SNEEK feedback:
- K(-) means K is in the word but NOT in position 5.

But our pattern is S _ E E _ with N needing to be in position 2. The only remaining position for K is 5, but K cannot be there. This implies our assumption that N must be in position 2 is incorrect.

Re-evaluate:
- N must be in the word but not in positions 2, 4, or 5 (from previous feedback)
- The only remaining position is position 2, but this leads to K needing to be in position 5 which is disallowed.

This suggests we missed another possible position for N. However, positions 3 and 4 are already E's, and position 1 is S. Thus N cannot be anywhere else, which implies our earlier interpretation might be missing something.

Re-checking feedback:
- From SNEER: N(-) means N is in the word but not in position 2
- From SCENE: N(-) means N is in the word but not in position 4
- From SNEEK: N(-) means N is in the word but not in position 2 (consistent)

Thus N must be in position 5, but feedback on SNEER said N(-) (not in position 2) and on SNEEK N(-) (not in position 2), which doesn't directly say it's not in position 5. Wait, no feedback explicitly says N is not in position 5, so position 5 is possible.

Similarly, K must be in the word but not in position 5 (from SNEEK K(-)), so K must be in position 2.

Thus the word must be: S K E E N

Check:
- S(✓) K _ E E N
- K is in position 2 (allowed, since K must be in word but not in position 5)
- N is in position 5 (allowed, since no feedback says N is not in position 5)
- All letters used: S, K, E, N - none are in the excluded list.

""SKENE"" is a valid 5-letter word (a variant of ""skean"" or a surname), so this must be the correct guess.
</think>

After carefully re-evaluating the constraints:

- S is fixed in position 1
- E is fixed in positions 3 and 4
- K must be in the word but not in position 5 → must be in position 2
- N must be in the word but not in positions 2 or 4 → must be in position 5

Thus the word must be: S K E E N
