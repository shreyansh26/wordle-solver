For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these letters to test multiple possibilities. Some popular choices are ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""RAISE."" I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it can’t be in position 1).
- L is not in the word at all.
- A is not in the word at all.
- T is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- E is not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern: _ _ _ T _
- It contains S (but not in position 1) and T (in position 4).
- It does NOT contain L, A, or E.

To maximize information, I want a word that:
1. Keeps T in position 4.
2. Places S somewhere other than position 1.
3. Introduces new common consonants and vowels (like R, I, N, O, U, etc.) to test for their presence.

A good candidate is “FIRST”:
- F: new consonant.
- I: new vowel.
- R: new consonant.
- S: already known to be in the word, and here it would be in position 4 (but position 4 is T). So that’s bad—S can’t be in position 4.  
Another candidate: “WRIST” – but that has S in position 5, which is allowed, and introduces W, R, I.  
However, W isn’t super common. A better choice might be “CRUST”:
- C: new consonant.
- R: new consonant.
- U: new vowel.
- S: known to be in the word, and here it’s in position 4 (but position 4 is T). So that’s no good.

Let’s try “ROUST”:
- R, O, U are new letters.
- S is in position 5 (allowed, since S can’t be in position 1).
- T is in position 4 (correct).

This seems optimal: it tests R, O, U, and confirms S is in position 5.

From Guess 1 (SLATE):

From Guess 2 (ROUST):
- R is NOT in the word.
- O is NOT in the word.
- U is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4 (and we already knew it’s not in position 1).
- T is in the word but NOT in position 5 (and we already knew it’s in position 4).

So far:
- Pattern: _ _ _ T _
- Letters known to be in the word: S, T, U
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: L, A, E, R, O
- S can be in positions 2, 3, or 5.
- U can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but position 4 is T, so positions 1, 2, or 5).

We need a word that:
1. Has T in position 4.
2. Contains S and U in allowed positions.
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible candidates:
- SU_ T _ : but S can’t be in position 1, and U can’t be in position 3.
- _ S U T _ : but U can’t be in position 3 (already T), and S would be in position 2, U in 3 (invalid).
- _ U S T _ : U in 2, S in 3 – both allowed.
- S _ U T _ : S in 1 – invalid (S can’t be in 1).
- _ S _ T U : S in 2, U in 5 – both allowed.
- _ U _ T S : U in 2, S in 5 – both allowed.

Let’s pick a word that tests new common letters while fitting these constraints. A good choice is “BUSTS”:
- B: new consonant.
- U: known to be in word, here in position 2 (allowed).
- S: known to be in word, here in position 3 (allowed).
- T: in position 4 (correct).
- S: in position 5 (allowed).

This tests B as a new letter and confirms positions of U and S.

- Letters known to be in the word: S, T, U
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: L, A, E, R, O
- S can be in positions 2, 3, or 5.
- U can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but position 4 is T, so positions 1, 2, or 5).

We need a word that:
1. Has T in position 4.
2. Contains S and U in allowed positions.
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible candidates:
- SU_ T _ : but S can’t be in position 1, and U can’t be in position 3.
- _ S U T _ : but U can’t be in position 3 (already T), and S would be in position 2, U in 3 (invalid).
- _ U S T _ : U in 2, S in 3 – both allowed.
- S _ U T _ : S in 1 – invalid (S can’t be in 1).
- _ S _ T U : S in 2, U in 5 – both allowed.
- _ U _ T S : U in 2, S in 5 – both allowed.

Let’s pick a word that tests new common letters while fitting these constraints. A good choice is “BUSTS”:
- B: new consonant.
- U: known to be in word, here in position 2 (allowed).
- S: known to be in word, here in position 3 (allowed).
- T: in position 4 (correct).
- S: in position 5 (allowed).

This tests B as a new letter and confirms positions of U and S.

Let's extract every constraint we now have.

Known positions
- Position 4 = T ✓ (fixed)

Known letters
- U is in the word and is in position 2 ✓
- S is in the word and is in position 5 ✓
- T is in the word and is in position 4 ✓

Forbidden letters (from all previous x-feedback)
L, A, E, R, O, B

Forbidden positions
- S cannot be in position 1 or 4 (already ruled out by earlier feedback)
- U cannot be in position 3 (already satisfied since U is in position 2)
- T cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (already satisfied since T is in position 4)

Current pattern
_ U _ T S

We need a valid 5-letter English word that matches this pattern and only uses letters not yet ruled out.

Possible consonants left: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible vowels left: I (since A, E, O are out and U is already used)

Let's look for common words fitting _ U _ T S:
- CUPID – doesn't fit (needs 5 letters ending with S)
- DUSTS – fits perfectly: D U _ T S
- FISTS – but F and I are allowed, but we already have S in position 5
- GUSTS – G and S are allowed
- MUSTS – M and S are allowed
- NUTTS – N and S are allowed

Among these, ""DUSTS"" seems most straightforward as it uses common letters and hasn't been tested yet.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these letters to test multiple possibilities. Some popular choices are ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""RAISE."" I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it can’t be in position 1).
- L is not in the word at all.
- A is not in the word at all.
- T is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- E is not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern: _ _ _ T _
- It contains S (but not in position 1) and T (in position 4).
- It does NOT contain L, A, or E.

To maximize information, I want a word that:
1. Keeps T in position 4.
2. Places S somewhere other than position 1.
3. Introduces new common consonants and vowels (like R, I, N, O, U, etc.) to test for their presence.

A good candidate is “FIRST”:
- F: new consonant.
- I: new vowel.
- R: new consonant.
- S: already known to be in the word, and here it would be in position 4 (but position 4 is T). So that’s bad—S can’t be in position 4.  
Another candidate: “WRIST” – but that has S in position 5, which is allowed, and introduces W, R, I.  
However, W isn’t super common. A better choice might be “CRUST”:
- C: new consonant.
- R: new consonant.
- U: new vowel.
- S: known to be in the word, and here it’s in position 4 (but position 4 is T). So that’s no good.

Let’s try “ROUST”:
- R, O, U are new letters.
- S is in position 5 (allowed, since S can’t be in position 1).
- T is in position 4 (correct).

This seems optimal: it tests R, O, U, and confirms S is in position 5.

Let’s update what we know after the two guesses.

From Guess 1 (SLATE):
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- T is in the word and IS in position 4.
- L, A, E are NOT in the word.

From Guess 2 (ROUST):
- R is NOT in the word.
- O is NOT in the word.
- U is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4 (and we already knew it’s not in position 1).
- T is in the word but NOT in position 5 (and we already knew it’s in position 4).

So far:
- Pattern: _ _ _ T _
- Letters known to be in the word: S, T, U
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: L, A, E, R, O
- S can be in positions 2, 3, or 5.
- U can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but position 4 is T, so positions 1, 2, or 5).

We need a word that:
1. Has T in position 4.
2. Contains S and U in allowed positions.
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible candidates:
- SU_ T _ : but S can’t be in position 1, and U can’t be in position 3.
- _ S U T _ : but U can’t be in position 3 (already T), and S would be in position 2, U in 3 (invalid).
- _ U S T _ : U in 2, S in 3 – both allowed.
- S _ U T _ : S in 1 – invalid (S can’t be in 1).
- _ S _ T U : S in 2, U in 5 – both allowed.
- _ U _ T S : U in 2, S in 5 – both allowed.

Let’s pick a word that tests new common letters while fitting these constraints. A good choice is “BUSTS”:
- B: new consonant.
- U: known to be in word, here in position 2 (allowed).
- S: known to be in word, here in position 3 (allowed).
- T: in position 4 (correct).
- S: in position 5 (allowed).

This tests B as a new letter and confirms positions of U and S.

From all feedback so far we have:

Fixed letters:

Forbidden positions:

Remaining allowed consonants (not yet ruled out): C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Remaining allowed vowels: I (only vowel left besides U)

We need a valid English word that is _ U _ T S and uses only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- CUPID – doesn’t end with S
- MUSTS – M is allowed, fits pattern
- FISTS – I is allowed, fits pattern
- GUSTS – G is allowed, fits pattern
- NUTTS – N is allowed, fits pattern

Among these, ""FISTS"" uses I (the only remaining vowel) in position 3, which hasn’t been tested yet. This will confirm whether I is in the word.

Pattern: F I S T S – but this would place S in position 3, which is forbidden (S cannot be in position 3). My mistake!

Wait, the pattern is _ U _ T S, so position 3 is the only unknown. The word must be: X U Y T S, where X and Y are allowed letters.

Looking again:

- M U I T S – ""MUIT?"" no
- N U I T S – ""NUITS"" (valid French loanword, but may not be in standard English wordlists)

Actually, the most straightforward valid English word fitting _ U _ T S with allowed letters is ""MUSTS"" (M U S T S), but S is in position 3 which is forbidden.

Next best: ""CUPID"" doesn't fit. ""FISTS"" is F I S T S – again S in position 3.

Realizing the only valid English word left seems to be ""CUTIS"" (C U T I S), but T is in position 4, so it would be C U I T S – which is 5 letters and fits perfectly.

However, ""CUTIS"" is a valid English word (the medical term for skin). Let's verify:
C U I T S
- C: allowed
- U: correct position 2
- I: allowed vowel
- T: correct position 4

This tests I in position 3. If this is the word, we'll get ✓ for I in position 3.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these letters to test multiple possibilities. Some popular choices are ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""RAISE."" I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it can’t be in position 1).
- L is not in the word at all.
- A is not in the word at all.
- T is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- E is not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern: _ _ _ T _
- It contains S (but not in position 1) and T (in position 4).
- It does NOT contain L, A, or E.

To maximize information, I want a word that:
1. Keeps T in position 4.
2. Places S somewhere other than position 1.
3. Introduces new common consonants and vowels (like R, I, N, O, U, etc.) to test for their presence.

A good candidate is “FIRST”:
- F: new consonant.
- I: new vowel.
- R: new consonant.
- S: already known to be in the word, and here it would be in position 4 (but position 4 is T). So that’s bad—S can’t be in position 4.  
Another candidate: “WRIST” – but that has S in position 5, which is allowed, and introduces W, R, I.  
However, W isn’t super common. A better choice might be “CRUST”:
- C: new consonant.
- R: new consonant.
- U: new vowel.
- S: known to be in the word, and here it’s in position 4 (but position 4 is T). So that’s no good.

Let’s try “ROUST”:
- R, O, U are new letters.
- S is in position 5 (allowed, since S can’t be in position 1).
- T is in position 4 (correct).

This seems optimal: it tests R, O, U, and confirms S is in position 5.

Let’s update what we know after the two guesses.

From Guess 1 (SLATE):
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- T is in the word and IS in position 4.
- L, A, E are NOT in the word.

From Guess 2 (ROUST):
- R is NOT in the word.
- O is NOT in the word.
- U is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4 (and we already knew it’s not in position 1).
- T is in the word but NOT in position 5 (and we already knew it’s in position 4).

So far:
- Pattern: _ _ _ T _
- Letters known to be in the word: S, T, U
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: L, A, E, R, O
- S can be in positions 2, 3, or 5.
- U can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but position 4 is T, so positions 1, 2, or 5).

We need a word that:
1. Has T in position 4.
2. Contains S and U in allowed positions.
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible candidates:
- SU_ T _ : but S can’t be in position 1, and U can’t be in position 3.
- _ S U T _ : but U can’t be in position 3 (already T), and S would be in position 2, U in 3 (invalid).
- _ U S T _ : U in 2, S in 3 – both allowed.
- S _ U T _ : S in 1 – invalid (S can’t be in 1).
- _ S _ T U : S in 2, U in 5 – both allowed.
- _ U _ T S : U in 2, S in 5 – both allowed.

Let’s pick a word that tests new common letters while fitting these constraints. A good choice is “BUSTS”:
- B: new consonant.
- U: known to be in word, here in position 2 (allowed).
- S: known to be in word, here in position 3 (allowed).
- T: in position 4 (correct).
- S: in position 5 (allowed).

This tests B as a new letter and confirms positions of U and S.

Let's extract every constraint we now have.

Known positions
- Position 4 = T ✓ (fixed)

Known letters
- U is in the word and is in position 2 ✓
- S is in the word and is in position 5 ✓
- T is in the word and is in position 4 ✓

Forbidden letters (from all previous x-feedback)
L, A, E, R, O, B

Forbidden positions
- S cannot be in position 1 or 4 (already ruled out by earlier feedback)
- U cannot be in position 3 (already satisfied since U is in position 2)
- T cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (already satisfied since T is in position 4)

Current pattern
_ U _ T S

We need a valid 5-letter English word that matches this pattern and only uses letters not yet ruled out.

Possible consonants left: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible vowels left: I (since A, E, O are out and U is already used)

Let's look for common words fitting _ U _ T S:
- CUPID – doesn't fit (needs 5 letters ending with S)
- DUSTS – fits perfectly: D U _ T S
- FISTS – but F and I are allowed, but we already have S in position 5
- GUSTS – G and S are allowed
- MUSTS – M and S are allowed
- NUTTS – N and S are allowed

Among these, ""DUSTS"" seems most straightforward as it uses common letters and hasn't been tested yet.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Fixed positions
- Position 2 = U ✓
- Position 5 = S ✓
- Position 4 = T ✓   (from SLATE)  
  – In CUTIS the feedback for T was “-”, meaning T is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
  – This is a contradiction: earlier we had T(✓) in position 4 from SLATE, so T MUST be in position 4.  
  – Therefore the feedback for CUTIS must be interpreted as:
        T(-)  → T is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
        But we already have T(✓) from SLATE, which is absolute.  
  – The only consistent reading is that the feedback for CUTIS was:
        C(x) U(✓) T(-) I(x) S(✓)  
        means T is NOT in position 4 (impossible) – so the only way this can be is if the feedback was meant to confirm T in position 4.  
  – Re-reading the example in the rules: in the example feedback, the ✓ is for correct position, – for correct letter wrong position, x for absent.  
  – So in CUTIS, the feedback:
        C(x)  → C not in word
        U(✓) → U correct in position 2
        T(-) → T is in word but not in position 4 (but we know from SLATE it IS in position 4)  
        I(x) → I not in word
        S(✓) → S correct in position 5
  – This is impossible: T cannot simultaneously be in position 4 (from SLATE) and not in position 4 (from CUTIS feedback).  
  – The only resolution is that the feedback for CUTIS was intended to confirm T in position 4; the “-” must have been a typo or misread and should have been “✓”.  
  – Given the rules as stated, we will proceed assuming:
        Position 4 = T ✓ (from SLATE)
        Position 2 = U ✓ (from BUSTS)
        Position 5 = S ✓ (from BUSTS)
        Forbidden letters so far: L, A, E, R, O, B, D, C, I

Pattern so far: _ U _ T S

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out): F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form X U Y T S where X and Y are from the allowed set.

Possible candidates:
- F U G T S – “FUGTS” – not a word
- F U N T S – “FUNDS” – but D is forbidden
- G U N T S – “GUNTS” – not standard
- H U N T S – “HUNTS” – H, U, N, T, S – all letters allowed
- J U N T S – “JUNTS” – not standard
- M U N T S – “MUNTS” – not standard
- N U M T S – “NUMTS” – no
- P U N T S – “PUNTS” – P, U, N, T, S – all allowed
- W U N T S – “WUNTS” – not standard

The two most plausible valid English words are:
- HUNTS
- PUNTS

Both fit the pattern and use only allowed letters. We’ll guess HUNTS first.

Pattern: H U N T S
- H: allowed
