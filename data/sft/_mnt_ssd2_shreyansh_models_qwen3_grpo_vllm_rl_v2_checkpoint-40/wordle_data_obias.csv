For the first guess, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A: very common first letter
- R: common consonant
- O: common vowel
- S: common consonant
- E: most common letter in English

This gives good coverage of vowels and common consonants to quickly identify which letters are in the word.

From all three guesses we now have:

Letters that are in the word (but still in wrong positions):
- A – cannot be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd ⇒ must be 4th or 5th
- O – cannot be 2nd, 3rd, or 4th ⇒ must be 1st or 5th
- S – cannot be 1st, 4th, or 5th ⇒ must be 2nd or 3rd

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word:
R, E, C, T, L, N

So the word contains exactly A, O, S once each and two other letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding the six ruled-out letters). The remaining common letters include D, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.

We need to place:
- A in 4th or 5th
- O in 1st or 5th
- S in 2nd or 3rd

Let’s try to form a valid pattern. One promising arrangement is:

O _ S _ A

This uses:
- O in 1st (allowed)
- S in 3rd (allowed)
- A in 5th (allowed)

We need two more letters for positions 2 and 4, chosen from the remaining pool and distinct. Common choices could be D and I, forming the word ODISA (but that’s not a valid English word). Another combination could be H and D, forming OHDSA (invalid). Trying G and I gives OSGIA (invalid).

Instead, let’s try swapping positions. Another pattern: _ O _ A S – but S cannot be 5th. 

Another valid pattern: _ A _ O S – but S cannot be 5th.

Next pattern: S _ A _ O – S in 1st is invalid.

Next pattern: _ S _ A O – S in 2nd (allowed), A in 4th (allowed), O in 5th (allowed). This looks valid.

So the pattern is: _ S _ A O

We need two letters for positions 1 and 3, not R, E, C, T, L, N. Common choices: D and I give DSIAO (invalid). H and I give HSIAO (invalid). G and I give G S I A O → GSIAO (invalid).

Another pattern: S _ O _ A – S in 1st invalid.

Next pattern: _ _ S _ A – but O must be placed.

Let’s try O in 1st and A in 4th: O _ _ A _

Then S must be in 2nd or 3rd. Trying S in 2nd: O S _ A _

Need two letters for 3rd and 5th. Common letters: D and I → OS D A I (invalid). 

Trying S in 3rd: O _ S A _

Need letters for 2nd and 5th. Common: D and I → O D S A I (invalid).

Another pattern: A in 5th, O in 1st, S in 2nd: O S _ _ A

Need letters for 3rd and 4th. Common: D and I → OS D I A (invalid).

Another pattern: A in 4th, O in 5th, S in 2nd: _ S _ A O

Need letters for 1st and 3rd. Common: D and I → D S I A O (invalid).

After checking many combinations, the only valid English word that fits the constraints is:

SADLY – but L is ruled out.

SIGHT – but I and G and H are new, and positions: S(2) allowed, A(4) allowed, O is missing.

Wait, we must include O.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A: very common first letter
- R: common consonant
- O: common vowel
- S: common consonant
- E: most common letter in English

This gives good coverage of vowels and common consonants to quickly identify which letters are in the word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4
- E(x) → E is not in the word

So the secret word:
- Contains A, O, S (but none in their previous positions)
- Does NOT contain R or E

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses A, O, S (but A not 1st, O not 3rd, S not 4th)
- Avoids R and E
- Uses two additional letters that haven't been tested yet (to maximize info)

Good candidates: 
- SAINT (but uses I and N which are new)
- SALON (but uses L and N which are new)
- COAST (but uses C and T which are new)

I'll choose COAST because:
- C and T are common letters not yet tested
- Places A in position 3 (allowed since A can't be 1st or 4th)
- Places O in position 2 (allowed since O can't be 3rd)
- Places S in position 1 (allowed since S can't be 4th)
- Uses T which is a common ending letter

From the two guesses we now know:

Letters that are in the word (but in wrong positions so far):
- A (cannot be 1st or 3rd)
- O (cannot be 3rd or 2nd)
- S (cannot be 4th or 5th)

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word:
- R, E, C, T

So the word must contain A, O, S exactly once each and may contain two more letters that are not R, E, C, T.

Possible additional letters (common ones not yet ruled out): D, L, N, M, P, B, G, H, I, K, U, Y, etc.

We need to place A, O, S in positions they haven’t been ruled out for:
- A can be 2nd, 4th, or 5th
- O can be 1st, 4th, or 5th
- S can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd

Let’s try a word that satisfies these constraints and introduces two new common letters. A good candidate is:

SALON
- S in 1st (allowed)
- A in 2nd (allowed)
- L (new)
- O in 4th (allowed)
- N (new)

This uses two new letters (L, N) and places A, O, S in allowed positions.

- A – cannot be 1st, 3rd, or 2nd (from AROSE and COAST/SALON)
- O – cannot be 2nd, 3rd, or 4th (from AROSE, COAST, SALON)
- S – cannot be 1st, 4th, or 5th (from AROSE, COAST, SALON)

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
R, E, C, T, L, N

So the word must contain A, O, S exactly once each and two other letters that are NOT in {R,E,C,T,L,N}.  
Allowed positions left:
- A can only be 4th or 5th
- O can only be 1st or 5th
- S can only be 2nd or 3rd

Let’s pick two fresh common letters that haven’t been tried: D and G.

We need a valid 5-letter word using A, O, S plus D and G, with the above positional restrictions.

One such word is “SADOG”:
- S (2nd) – allowed
- A (4th) – allowed
- D – new letter
- O (5th) – allowed
- G – new letter

Check: no disallowed letters, all constraints met.

From the five guesses we now know:

Letters that are definitely in the word:
- A, O, S (each appears once)

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word:
R, E, C, T, L, N, D, G

Positions ruled out so far:
- A: cannot be 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th → must be 5th
- O: cannot be 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th → must be 1st
- S: cannot be 1st, 4th, 5th → can be 2nd or 3rd

So the word structure must be:
O _ _ _ A
with the middle three positions containing S plus two other letters that have NOT been eliminated.

Allowed letters left (not yet used and not eliminated):
B, F, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word that starts with O, ends with A, contains S somewhere in positions 2-3, and uses two fresh letters from the allowed set.

Candidate words:
- OSMIA (but M and I are allowed)
- OPYSA (but P and Y are allowed)
- OCHRA (but C and H are allowed – but C is eliminated)
- OPIAS (but P and I are allowed)

Let’s pick OPIAS:
- O (1st) – allowed
- P – new
- I – new
- A (5th) – must be here
- S – must be in 2nd or 3rd, here it’s 4th – invalid

Try OSMIA:
- O (1st) – allowed
- S (2nd) – allowed
- M – new
- I – new
- A (5th) – allowed

This fits all constraints.
