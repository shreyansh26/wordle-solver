### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct common letters.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
- It contains 5 unique letters (A, R, O, S, E)
- All letters are among the most common in English
- It gives us information about 5 different positions
- The word is valid and common

This will help us quickly identify which of these very common letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct first position (A ✓ _ _ _ _)
- R is in the word but not in position 2
- O is in the word but not in position 3
- S and E are not in the word at all

So the pattern so far:
1st letter = A
2nd letter ≠ R
3rd letter ≠ O
4th and 5th letters are still unknown, but we know S and E are not present.

Good next letters to test (since S and E are out) are common consonants and vowels not yet used: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, M, P, etc.

I want to test new letters while respecting the known constraints. A strong candidate is “ANTIC”:
- Keeps A in position 1
- Tests N, T, I, C in positions 2-5
- Avoids R and O in their restricted spots
- Uses no S or E
- All letters are common and distinct

Current constraints:
1. A is fixed in position 1: A _ _ _ _
2. R is somewhere in the word but NOT in position 2
3. O is somewhere in the word but NOT in position 3
4. Letters already ruled out: S, E, T, I, C

So far we have:
A ✓ N ✓ _ _ _  (positions 1 and 2 are locked)
R must appear in positions 3, 4, or 5
O must appear in positions 2, 4, or 5

But position 2 is already N, so both R and O must appear in positions 3, 4, or 5.

Possible remaining letters (common ones not yet used): D, L, U, M, P, G, B, F, H, K, Y, W, V, etc.

Let’s try to place R and O in the remaining three slots while introducing new common letters.

Candidate word: A N D R O
- A and N are correct in positions 1 and 2
- R and O are tested in positions 4 and 5
- D is a new common consonant in position 3
- No S, E, T, I, C used
- Word is valid: ANDRO (though less common, it’s a valid 5-letter form)

A better common word would be ANGRO? No, that’s not a word. ANGEL? E is out. ANGEL not possible.

Another approach: A N R O _ — but we need a 5th letter. Let’s try A N R O L? Not a word.

How about A N D R O? It’s a valid word (short for androgynous or a name). But let’s pick a more common word.

Better common word: A N D R O isn’t common. Let’s try A N G R O? Not a word.

Alternative: A N D R O is the only valid 5-letter word with A N _ _ _ and R and O in positions 4 and 5. But let’s check another.

Another valid word: A N G R Y — but Y is less common. And we’d be testing G and Y.

But we have to place R and O somewhere. Let’s try A N D R O.

Actually, A N D R O is valid (short for androgynous). Let’s use it.

But to be safe, let’s pick a more common word: A N G R Y isn’t ideal. Let’s try A N D R O.

But let’s think differently: positions 3,4,5 must contain R and O plus one new letter. Possible permutations:

- A N R O _ → need a 5th letter. ANROD? Not a word.
- A N O R _ → ANOR_ → ANORE? Not a word.
- A N _ R O → ANDRO (valid)
- A N _ O R → ANGRO? Not a word.

So the only valid word seems to be ANDRO. But let’s check another approach.

Alternative: A N _ _ _ with R and O in positions 3,4,5 in some order plus one new letter.

Possible word: A N O R D? Not valid.

Another valid word: A N R O D? Not valid.

Another: A N D O R? Not valid.

Another: A N G O R? Not valid.

Another: A N P O R? Not valid.

Another: A N D R O is the only valid word found.

But let’s check A N D R O: yes, it’s valid (short for androgynous).

So we’ll go with ANDRO.

But to maximize common letters, let’s try A N D R O.

However, let’s think of another word: A N G R Y — but Y is less common.

Another: A N G O R — not valid.

Another: A N D R O is the best found.

Thus, the next guess is ANDRO.
