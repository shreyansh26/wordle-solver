For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the best starting words in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowels in the secret word
- Two very common consonants (R, S) which appear in many 5-letter words

This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position. It's a balanced approach that covers common letters without repeating any.

- R is not in the word at all.

A good next guess should:

Let's extract every constraint from the three rounds of feedback.

Letters known NOT in the word:
R, S, E (from AROSE)
T, N, L (from TONAL)
G, M (from DOGMA)

Letters known TO be in the word:
O – and it is confirmed in position 2 (from TONAL and DOGMA).
A – it is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (because in AROSE it was in position 1 and marked “-”, in TONAL it was in position 4 and marked “-”, and in DOGMA it was in position 5 and marked “-”).  
Therefore A must be in position 2… but position 2 is already taken by O.  
This is a contradiction, which means my interpretation must be wrong.

Re-examining the feedback:
- In DOGMA: D(-) O(✓) G(x) M(x) A(-)
  – O is correct in position 2 (✓).
  – A is in the word but in the wrong position (-); it was in position 5 there, so A is NOT in position 5.

So far we have:
- O in position 2.
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 4, or 5.
  – Therefore A must be in position 3.
- Letters excluded: R, S, E, T, N, L, G, M.

We now have the pattern:
_ O A _ _

Remaining letters to fill positions 1 and 4 must come from the unused alphabet, excluding the above excluded letters.  
Common remaining consonants: C, D, F, H, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need two more consonants, one for position 1 and one for position 4, without repeating any letter.

Possible candidates:
- COBRA – invalid (R excluded)
- FOAMY – invalid (M excluded)
- HOPPY – invalid (P and Y allowed, but double P)
- COAST – invalid (S excluded)
- COBIA – valid letters (C, O, B, I, A) – but B and I are allowed.

Let’s check COBIA:
- C, O, B, I, A – none of the excluded letters.
- O in position 2 – correct.
- A in position 5 – but we just deduced A must be in position 3.  
So COBIA is invalid because A is in position 5.

We need A in position 3, so the pattern is:
_ O A _ _

Now we need to fill positions 1 and 4 with allowed letters.

Possible combinations:
- C O A D _ – need a 5th letter.  
- C O A B _ – need a 5th letter.

Looking for common English words fitting _ O A _ _ with allowed letters:
- COBRA – R excluded
- COALA – L excluded
- COAST – S excluded
- COBIA – already considered, A in 5 not allowed
- FOAMY – M excluded
- HOAGY – G excluded
- POACH – H, P, C, etc. – but P is allowed, H is allowed.

Let’s try POACH:
- P, O, A, C, H – none of the excluded letters.
- Pattern: P O A C H – A is in position 3 – correct.
- All letters are unique and allowed.

This fits all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the best starting words in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowels in the secret word
- Two very common consonants (R, S) which appear in many 5-letter words

This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position. It's a balanced approach that covers common letters without repeating any.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3).
- S is not in the word at all.
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E.
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are unknown: A, O.
- We still have no information about T, N, L, I, C, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Include A and O in new positions.
2. Avoid R, S, E.
3. Introduce new common consonants to test.

Possible candidates: 
- TONAL (but has L, which is fine)
- CANTO (but has C and N, which is fine)
- PLANT (but has P, L, N, T)

""TONAL"" looks good because:
- T is a very common consonant.
- O is in a new position (2).
- A is in a new position (3).
- L and N are also common consonants we haven't tested.

Let's go with TONAL.

Guess 2: TONAL -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(✓) N(x) A(-) L(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.
   - R, S, E are not in the word.

2. TONAL → T(x) O(✓) N(x) A(-) L(-)
   - O is in the correct position (position 2).
   - A is in the word but not in position 4.
   - T, N, L are not in the word.

So far we know:
- O is in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4.
- Letters definitely excluded: R, S, E, T, N, L.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2.
- A somewhere in positions 3 or 5 (since 1 and 4 are excluded for A).
- No R, S, E, T, N, L.

Common consonants left to test: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let's try to construct a word:
- Pattern: _ O _ _ _
- A must be in position 3 or 5.
- We need two more consonants from the allowed set.

Possible candidates:
- COBRA (but R is excluded)
- DOGMA (but M is allowed, but let's check letters: D, O, G, M, A - all allowed)
- FOAMY (but Y is allowed, but M is allowed)
- HOMAM (but M is allowed, but this seems less common)

DOGMA seems valid:
- D, O, G, M, A - none of the excluded letters.
- O in position 2.
- A in position 5 (which is allowed since A can't be in 1 or 4).

Another option is COBIA (but I is allowed, but C, O, B, I, A - but B is allowed, but this might be less common).

Let's go with DOGMA as it uses common letters and fits the constraints.

Let's extract every constraint from the three rounds of feedback.

Letters known NOT in the word:
R, S, E (from AROSE)
T, N, L (from TONAL)
G, M (from DOGMA)

Letters known TO be in the word:
O – and it is confirmed in position 2 (from TONAL and DOGMA).
A – it is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (because in AROSE it was in position 1 and marked “-”, in TONAL it was in position 4 and marked “-”, and in DOGMA it was in position 5 and marked “-”).  
Therefore A must be in position 2… but position 2 is already taken by O.  
This is a contradiction, which means my interpretation must be wrong.

Re-examining the feedback:
- In DOGMA: D(-) O(✓) G(x) M(x) A(-)
  – O is correct in position 2 (✓).
  – A is in the word but in the wrong position (-); it was in position 5 there, so A is NOT in position 5.

So far we have:
- O in position 2.
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 4, or 5.
  – Therefore A must be in position 3.
- Letters excluded: R, S, E, T, N, L, G, M.

We now have the pattern:
_ O A _ _

Remaining letters to fill positions 1 and 4 must come from the unused alphabet, excluding the above excluded letters.  
Common remaining consonants: C, D, F, H, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need two more consonants, one for position 1 and one for position 4, without repeating any letter.

Possible candidates:
- COBRA – invalid (R excluded)
- FOAMY – invalid (M excluded)
- HOPPY – invalid (P and Y allowed, but double P)
- COAST – invalid (S excluded)
- COBIA – valid letters (C, O, B, I, A) – but B and I are allowed.

Let’s check COBIA:
- C, O, B, I, A – none of the excluded letters.
- O in position 2 – correct.
- A in position 5 – but we just deduced A must be in position 3.  
So COBIA is invalid because A is in position 5.

We need A in position 3, so the pattern is:
_ O A _ _

Now we need to fill positions 1 and 4 with allowed letters.

Possible combinations:
- C O A D _ – need a 5th letter.  
- C O A B _ – need a 5th letter.

Looking for common English words fitting _ O A _ _ with allowed letters:
- COBRA – R excluded
- COALA – L excluded
- COAST – S excluded
- COBIA – already considered, A in 5 not allowed
- FOAMY – M excluded
- HOAGY – G excluded
- POACH – H, P, C, etc. – but P is allowed, H is allowed.

Let’s try POACH:
- P, O, A, C, H – none of the excluded letters.
- Pattern: P O A C H – A is in position 3 – correct.
- All letters are unique and allowed.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the best starting words in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowels in the secret word
- Two very common consonants (R, S) which appear in many 5-letter words

This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position. It's a balanced approach that covers common letters without repeating any.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3).
- S is not in the word at all.
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E.
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are unknown: A, O.
- We still have no information about T, N, L, I, C, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Include A and O in new positions.
2. Avoid R, S, E.
3. Introduce new common consonants to test.

Possible candidates: 
- TONAL (but has L, which is fine)
- CANTO (but has C and N, which is fine)
- PLANT (but has P, L, N, T)

""TONAL"" looks good because:
- T is a very common consonant.
- O is in a new position (2).
- A is in a new position (3).
- L and N are also common consonants we haven't tested.

Let's go with TONAL.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: TONAL -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(✓) N(x) A(-) L(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.
   - R, S, E are not in the word.

2. TONAL → T(x) O(✓) N(x) A(-) L(-)
   - O is in the correct position (position 2).
   - A is in the word but not in position 4.
   - T, N, L are not in the word.

So far we know:
- O is in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4.
- Letters definitely excluded: R, S, E, T, N, L.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2.
- A somewhere in positions 3 or 5 (since 1 and 4 are excluded for A).
- No R, S, E, T, N, L.

Common consonants left to test: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let's try to construct a word:
- Pattern: _ O _ _ _
- A must be in position 3 or 5.
- We need two more consonants from the allowed set.

Possible candidates:
- COBRA (but R is excluded)
- DOGMA (but M is allowed, but let's check letters: D, O, G, M, A - all allowed)
- FOAMY (but Y is allowed, but M is allowed)
- HOMAM (but M is allowed, but this seems less common)

DOGMA seems valid:
- D, O, G, M, A - none of the excluded letters.
- O in position 2.
- A in position 5 (which is allowed since A can't be in 1 or 4).

Another option is COBIA (but I is allowed, but C, O, B, I, A - but B is allowed, but this might be less common).

Let's go with DOGMA as it uses common letters and fits the constraints.

Let's extract every constraint from the three rounds of feedback.

Letters known NOT in the word:
R, S, E (from AROSE)
T, N, L (from TONAL)
G, M (from DOGMA)

Letters known TO be in the word:
O – and it is confirmed in position 2 (from TONAL and DOGMA).
A – it is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (because in AROSE it was in position 1 and marked “-”, in TONAL it was in position 4 and marked “-”, and in DOGMA it was in position 5 and marked “-”).  
Therefore A must be in position 2… but position 2 is already taken by O.  
This is a contradiction, which means my interpretation must be wrong.

Re-examining the feedback:
- In DOGMA: D(-) O(✓) G(x) M(x) A(-)
  – O is correct in position 2 (✓).
  – A is in the word but in the wrong position (-); it was in position 5 there, so A is NOT in position 5.

So far we have:
- O in position 2.
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 4, or 5.
  – Therefore A must be in position 3.
- Letters excluded: R, S, E, T, N, L, G, M.

We now have the pattern:
_ O A _ _

Remaining letters to fill positions 1 and 4 must come from the unused alphabet, excluding the above excluded letters.  
Common remaining consonants: C, D, F, H, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need two more consonants, one for position 1 and one for position 4, without repeating any letter.

Possible candidates:
- COBRA – invalid (R excluded)
- FOAMY – invalid (M excluded)
- HOPPY – invalid (P and Y allowed, but double P)
- COAST – invalid (S excluded)
- COBIA – valid letters (C, O, B, I, A) – but B and I are allowed.

Let’s check COBIA:
- C, O, B, I, A – none of the excluded letters.
- O in position 2 – correct.
- A in position 5 – but we just deduced A must be in position 3.  
So COBIA is invalid because A is in position 5.

We need A in position 3, so the pattern is:
_ O A _ _

Now we need to fill positions 1 and 4 with allowed letters.

Possible combinations:
- C O A D _ – need a 5th letter.  
- C O A B _ – need a 5th letter.

Looking for common English words fitting _ O A _ _ with allowed letters:
- COBRA – R excluded
- COALA – L excluded
- COAST – S excluded
- COBIA – already considered, A in 5 not allowed
- FOAMY – M excluded
- HOAGY – G excluded
- POACH – H, P, C, etc. – but P is allowed, H is allowed.

Let’s try POACH:
- P, O, A, C, H – none of the excluded letters.
- Pattern: P O A C H – A is in position 3 – correct.
- All letters are unique and allowed.

This fits all constraints.

From the latest feedback on WOAID:
W(✓) O(✓) A(✓) I(x) D(✓)

This gives us:
- Position 1: W is correct (✓)
- Position 2: O is correct (✓)
- Position 3: A is correct (✓)
- Position 4: I is NOT in the word (x)
- Position 5: D is correct (✓)

So the pattern is now completely determined: W O A _ D

We need a 5-letter word that matches W O A _ D.

The only letter in position 4 must be a consonant that has not been excluded yet and completes a valid English word.

Excluded letters so far: R, S, E, T, N, L, G, M, P, C, H, I

Remaining possible letters for position 4: B, F, K, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z (and any others not listed)

Looking for common English words that fit W O A _ D:
- WOAD? - but that's 4 letters
- WOADY - but Y is allowed, and W O A D Y is a valid word (though rare)
- WOAKD - not a word
- WOAFD - not a word
- WOAVD - not a word
- WOAKD - not a word

Actually, the only common English word that fits W O A _ D is WOAD, but that's 4 letters. This suggests we might have missed a word earlier, but given the constraints, WOAD is the only possible 4-letter word. However, the game requires 5-letter words.

Rechecking the constraints:
We have W O A _ D. The only valid 5-letter word fitting this is WOADD? No, that's not a word.
Wait, let's think of other possibilities.

Looking at the remaining letters: B, F, K, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

Possible words:
- WOABD - not a word
- WOAUD - not a word
- WOAUD - not a word
- WOAKD - not a word
- WOAVD - not a word
- WOADY - this is a valid 5-letter word meaning to cover with woad

Thus, the only possible word is WOADY.
