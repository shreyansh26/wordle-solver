1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good first guess should contain several of these common letters to help identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us coverage of 5 of the most common letters, which should provide substantial information regardless of the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x)
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains O and S
- Does NOT contain A, R, E
- O is not in position 3
- S is not in position 4

We need a 5-letter word with O and S, no A/R/E, and O/S not in their original positions.

Good letters to try next: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

- S (known in word, not in position 4)

From the new feedback on STONY:

- Y is now in the correct position (✓) → position 5 is Y
- O is still in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- T and N are NOT in the word (x)

So the secret word:
- Starts with S
- Ends with Y
- Contains O (but not in position 3)
- Does NOT contain A, R, E, T, N
- Letters used so far: S, O, Y

Remaining positions to fill: 2, 3, 4  
Possible letters (excluding A, R, E, T, N): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z

We also know O must appear somewhere in positions 2 or 4 (since it can’t be in 3).

Let’s try a word that places O in position 2 and uses common remaining letters:
- S _ O _ Y

A good candidate is ""SPOIL"" but it ends with L, not Y.  
Another candidate: ""SLOPY"" – but P and L are allowed, and O is in position 2.

However, ""SLOPY"" uses P and L which are valid.  
But let’s check if we can do better with more common letters.

Consider ""SUGLY"" – but U and G are okay, but ""SUGLY"" is less common.

A more common word: ""SLOSH"" – but ends with H, not Y.

Wait, we need to end with Y.  
So the pattern is S _ _ _ Y with O somewhere in 2, 3, or 4, but not 3 (from AROSE feedback O was in position 3 and marked -, so O can't be in 3). So O must be in 2 or 4.

Let’s try O in position 4: S _ _ O Y  
A common word fitting this: ""SHOCK"" – but ends with C, not Y.

Another: ""SPOOF"" – ends with F.

A common word: ""SOCKY"" – but ""socky"" is not a standard word.

""SOILY"" – uses I and L, both allowed. ""SOILY"" means covered with soil, but is a valid word.

But let’s think of more common words.  
""SLOPY"" is valid (slippery).

But let’s try ""SLOPY"":
- S(✓) in position 1
- L(new)
- O(known in word, position 3 – but from AROSE, O can't be in position 3. So O in position 3 is invalid. Thus ""SLOPY"" is invalid because it puts O in position 3.

So O must be in position 2 or 4.

Let’s try O in position 4: S _ _ O Y  
A common word: ""SHOCK"" – no, ends with C.

""SMOCK"" – ends with K.

""SPICY"" – ends with Y, but contains I and C, and O is in position 4.

""SPICY"" has O in position 4, S in 1, Y in 5, and uses P, I, C which are allowed.

""SOILY"" – uses I and L, both allowed. ""SOILY"" means covered with soil, but is a valid word.

But let’s think of more common words.  
""SLOPY"" is valid (slippery).

But let’s try ""SLOPY"":
- S(✓) in position 1
- L(new)
- O(known in word, position 3 – but from AROSE, O can't be in position 3. So O in position 3 is invalid. Thus ""SLOPY"" is invalid because it puts O in position 3.

So O must be in position 2 or 4.

Let’s try O in position 4: S _ _ O Y  
A common word: ""SHOCK"" – no, ends with C.

""SMOCK"" – ends with K.

""SPICY"" – ends with Y, but contains I and C, and O is in position 4.

""SPICY"" has O in position 4, S in 1, Y in 5, and uses P, I, C which are allowed.

""SPICY"" is a valid word and fits all constraints:
- S in 1 (✓)
- P(new)
- I(new)
- C(new)
- Y in 5 (✓)
- O is in position 4 (allowed, since O can't be in 3)
- No A, R, E, T, N

Thus, ""SPICY"" is a good next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good first guess should contain several of these common letters to help identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us coverage of 5 of the most common letters, which should provide substantial information regardless of the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x)
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains O and S
- Does NOT contain A, R, E
- O is not in position 3
- S is not in position 4

We need a 5-letter word with O and S, no A/R/E, and O/S not in their original positions.

Good letters to try next: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

A word that uses O and S plus some new common letters: ""STONY""
- S (known in word, not in position 4)
- T (new letter)
- O (known in word, not in position 3)
- N (new letter)
- Y (new letter)

This gives us new letters while respecting the constraints.

Guess 2: STONY -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) O(-) N(x) Y(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on STONY:
- S is now in the correct position (✓) → position 1 is S
- Y is now in the correct position (✓) → position 5 is Y
- O is still in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- T and N are NOT in the word (x)

So the secret word:
- Starts with S
- Ends with Y
- Contains O (but not in position 3)
- Does NOT contain A, R, E, T, N
- Letters used so far: S, O, Y

Remaining positions to fill: 2, 3, 4  
Possible letters (excluding A, R, E, T, N): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z

We also know O must appear somewhere in positions 2 or 4 (since it can’t be in 3).

Let’s try a word that places O in position 2 and uses common remaining letters:
- S _ O _ Y

A good candidate is ""SPOIL"" but it ends with L, not Y.  
Another candidate: ""SLOPY"" – but P and L are allowed, and O is in position 2.

However, ""SLOPY"" uses P and L which are valid.  
But let’s check if we can do better with more common letters.

Consider ""SUGLY"" – but U and G are okay, but ""SUGLY"" is less common.

A more common word: ""SLOSH"" – but ends with H, not Y.

Wait, we need to end with Y.  
So the pattern is S _ _ _ Y with O somewhere in 2, 3, or 4, but not 3 (from AROSE feedback O was in position 3 and marked -, so O can't be in 3). So O must be in 2 or 4.

Let’s try O in position 4: S _ _ O Y  
A common word fitting this: ""SHOCK"" – but ends with C, not Y.

Another: ""SPOOF"" – ends with F.

Hmm, let’s try O in position 2: S O _ _ Y  
A common word: ""SOCKY"" – but ""socky"" is not a standard word.

""SOILY"" – uses I and L, both allowed. ""SOILY"" means covered with soil, but is a valid word.

But let’s think of more common words.  
""SLOPY"" is valid (slippery).

But let’s try ""SLOPY"":
- S(✓) in position 1
- L(new)
- O(known in word, position 3 – but from AROSE, O can't be in position 3. So O in position 3 is invalid. Thus ""SLOPY"" is invalid because it puts O in position 3.

So O must be in position 2 or 4.

Let’s try O in position 4: S _ _ O Y  
A common word: ""SHOCK"" – no, ends with C.

""SMOCK"" – ends with K.

""SPICY"" – ends with Y, but contains I and C, and O is in position 4.

""SPICY"" has O in position 4, S in 1, Y in 5, and uses P, I, C which are allowed.

""SPICY"" is a valid word and fits all constraints:
- S in 1 (✓)
- P(new)
- I(new)
- C(new)
- Y in 5 (✓)
- O is in position 4 (allowed, since O can't be in 3)
- No A, R, E, T, N

From the feedback on SOLLY:
- S(✓) – correct in position 1
- O(✓) – correct in position 2
- L(-) – letter L is in the word but not in position 3
- L(✓) – correct in position 4
- Y(✓) – correct in position 5

So the pattern is now fully determined: S O _ L Y.

The only missing letter is in position 3.  
From previous eliminations, the letters not allowed are: A, R, E, T, N, P, I, C, and we already have S, O, L, Y fixed.  
The remaining unused letters that can fit in position 3 are: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, U, V, W, X, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words matching S O _ L Y:

The only valid dictionary word fitting S O _ L Y is “SODLY” (though it is rare), but more importantly, the feedback shows L is already in position 4, so position 3 must be a different letter. However, the only common word fitting is “SOLLY,” which we already tried. This suggests we might have missed another possibility.

Wait – let me re-examine the feedback carefully. The feedback on SOLLY was:
S(✓) O(✓) L(-) L(✓) Y(✓)

This means:
- Position 1: S ✓
- Position 2: O ✓
- Position 3: L is in the word but not in position 3 (so it must be elsewhere)
- Position 4: L ✓
- Position 5: Y ✓

Thus the word is S O _ L Y, and the blank must be a letter that is NOT L (since L is already in position 4). From remaining letters, the only common word is “SODLY,” but it is quite rare. Another possibility is “SOBLY,” which is also rare.

However, there is another valid word: “SOGLY” (though it is uncommon). The most likely intended word here is “SOGLY,” but it is still obscure.

Given the constraints, the only plausible word is “SOGLY,” but since it is uncommon, the next best is to check if we missed any other letters. The letter D is still available, giving “SODLY.” Between these, “SODLY” is slightly more common.

Therefore, the correct word must be “SODLY,” as it is the only remaining common form fitting the pattern.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good first guess should contain several of these common letters to help identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us coverage of 5 of the most common letters, which should provide substantial information regardless of the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x)
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains O and S
- Does NOT contain A, R, E
- O is not in position 3
- S is not in position 4

We need a 5-letter word with O and S, no A/R/E, and O/S not in their original positions.

Good letters to try next: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

A word that uses O and S plus some new common letters: ""STONY""
- S (known in word, not in position 4)
- T (new letter)
- O (known in word, not in position 3)
- N (new letter)
- Y (new letter)

This gives us new letters while respecting the constraints.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STONY -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) O(-) N(x) Y(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on STONY:
- S is now in the correct position (✓) → position 1 is S
- Y is now in the correct position (✓) → position 5 is Y
- O is still in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- T and N are NOT in the word (x)

So the secret word:
- Starts with S
- Ends with Y
- Contains O (but not in position 3)
- Does NOT contain A, R, E, T, N
- Letters used so far: S, O, Y

Remaining positions to fill: 2, 3, 4  
Possible letters (excluding A, R, E, T, N): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z

We also know O must appear somewhere in positions 2 or 4 (since it can’t be in 3).

Let’s try a word that places O in position 2 and uses common remaining letters:
- S _ O _ Y

A good candidate is ""SPOIL"" but it ends with L, not Y.  
Another candidate: ""SLOPY"" – but P and L are allowed, and O is in position 2.

However, ""SLOPY"" uses P and L which are valid.  
But let’s check if we can do better with more common letters.

Consider ""SUGLY"" – but U and G are okay, but ""SUGLY"" is less common.

A more common word: ""SLOSH"" – but ends with H, not Y.

Wait, we need to end with Y.  
So the pattern is S _ _ _ Y with O somewhere in 2, 3, or 4, but not 3 (from AROSE feedback O was in position 3 and marked -, so O can't be in 3). So O must be in 2 or 4.

Let’s try O in position 4: S _ _ O Y  
A common word fitting this: ""SHOCK"" – but ends with C, not Y.

Another: ""SPOOF"" – ends with F.

Hmm, let’s try O in position 2: S O _ _ Y  
A common word: ""SOCKY"" – but ""socky"" is not a standard word.

""SOILY"" – uses I and L, both allowed. ""SOILY"" means covered with soil, but is a valid word.

But let’s think of more common words.  
""SLOPY"" is valid (slippery).

But let’s try ""SLOPY"":
- S(✓) in position 1
- L(new)
- O(known in word, position 3 – but from AROSE, O can't be in position 3. So O in position 3 is invalid. Thus ""SLOPY"" is invalid because it puts O in position 3.

So O must be in position 2 or 4.

Let’s try O in position 4: S _ _ O Y  
A common word: ""SHOCK"" – no, ends with C.

""SMOCK"" – ends with K.

""SPICY"" – ends with Y, but contains I and C, and O is in position 4.

""SPICY"" has O in position 4, S in 1, Y in 5, and uses P, I, C which are allowed.

""SPICY"" is a valid word and fits all constraints:
- S in 1 (✓)
- P(new)
- I(new)
- C(new)
- Y in 5 (✓)
- O is in position 4 (allowed, since O can't be in 3)
- No A, R, E, T, N

Thus, ""SPICY"" is a good next guess.

Current constraints:

1. Word pattern: S _ _ _ Y (S fixed at position 1, Y fixed at position 5).
2. Must contain O (from AROSE and STONY feedback).
3. O cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE feedback).
4. Letters already eliminated: A, R, E, T, N, P, I, C.
5. Remaining positions for O: 2 or 4.

Possible letters left (excluding eliminated ones): B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, X, Z.

Case 1: O in position 2 → S O _ _ Y
- Need two letters from remaining set for positions 3 and 4.
- Common combinations: S O B L Y → ""SOBLY"" (not a word), S O B B Y → ""SOBBY"" (not common), S O L L Y → ""SOLLY"" (valid variant of ""silly"").
- ""SOLLY"" is a valid word meaning silly.

Case 2: O in position 4 → S _ _ O Y
- Need two letters for positions 2 and 3.
- Common combinations: S L O O Y (invalid, O repeated), S L U O Y (not a word), S M O O Y (invalid), S H O O Y (invalid), S L O G Y → ""SLOPY"" (but O would be in position 3, which is invalid), S L U G Y → ""SLUGY"" (valid, but O is in position 4).
- ""SLUGY"" is valid but less common.

Between ""SOLLY"" and ""SLUGY"", ""SOLLY"" is more straightforward and uses common remaining letters.

Thus, next guess: ""SOLLY"".

The feedback on SOLLY was:\nS(✓) O(✓) L(-) L(✓) Y(✓)\n\nThis means:\n- Position 1: S ✓\n- Position 2: O ✓\n- Position 3: L is in the word but not in position 3 (so it must be elsewhere)\n- Position 4: L ✓\n- Position 5: Y ✓\n\nThus the word is S O _ L Y, and the blank must be a letter that is NOT L (since L is already in position 4). From remaining letters, the only common word is “SODLY,” but it is quite rare. Another possibility is “SOBLY,” which is also rare.\n\nHowever, there is another valid word: “SOGLY” (though it is uncommon). The most likely intended word here is “SOGLY,” but it is still obscure.\n\nGiven the constraints, the only plausible word is “SOGLY,” but since it is uncommon, the next best is to check if we missed any other letters. The letter D is still available, giving “SODLY.” Between these, “SODLY” is slightly more common.\n\nTherefore, the correct word must be “SODLY,” as it is the only remaining common form fitting the pattern.\n\n<guess>SODLY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: STONY -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) O(-) N(x) Y(✓)\nGuess 3: SPICY -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) I(x) C(x) Y(✓)\nGuess 4: SOLLY -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(✓) L(-) L(✓) Y(✓)\nGuess 5: SODLY -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(✓) D(x) L(✓) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
From the latest feedback on SODLY:
- S(✓) – correct in position 1
- O(✓) – correct in position 2
- D(x) – D is NOT in the word
- L(✓) – correct in position 4
- Y(✓) – correct in position 5

So the pattern is fixed: S O _ L Y, and the missing letter (position 3) cannot be D or any of the previously eliminated letters (A, R, E, T, N, P, I, C, D).  
Remaining letters that can fit position 3: B, F, G, H, K, M, U, V, W, X, Z.

The only common English word matching S O _ L Y is “SOGLY,” but that is uncommon.  
Another possibility is “SOBLY,” which is also rare.  
However, “SOGLY” is listed in standard dictionaries (e.g., as a variant of “soggy”), and no other common word fits the pattern.

Therefore, the secret word must be “SOGLY.”
