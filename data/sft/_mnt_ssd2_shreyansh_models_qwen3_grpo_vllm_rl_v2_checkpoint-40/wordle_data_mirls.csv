For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best starting words typically have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to maximize information gain

A popular and effective first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All unique letters
- Good letter distribution across positions

This gives me the best chance to get useful feedback about multiple common letters right away.

Let's consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Letters we know are in the word: R, S, I  
- S is locked in position 5 (✓ from Guess 2 and 3).  
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from TRIPS and GRINS feedback).  
  Therefore R must be in position 4.  
- I is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from TRIPS and GRINS feedback).  
  Therefore I must be in position 1.

So the word has the fixed pattern: I _ _ R S

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, O, E, T, P, G, N

We need to fill positions 2 and 3 with letters that are:
- not yet excluded
- valid English letters

Available consonants/vowels left: B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let's think of common 5-letter words ending in ""IRS"":
- ""HIRS"" is not valid (needs 5 letters).  
- ""FURRS"" – no, has two R's and S is already fixed at 5.  
- ""MURDRS"" – too long.  
- ""CIVILS"" – too long.  
- ""FUROR"" – doesn't fit.  

Wait, we need to fit I _ _ R S.

- I B R S – no, needs 5 letters.  
- I C R S – no.  
- I D R S – no.  
- I L R S – no.  
- I M R S – no.

- I C H R S – ""ICHOR"" (valid word, means a golden fluid in ancient times)  
- I L Y R S – ""ILYRS"" – not a word.  
- I M B R S – ""IMBRS"" – not a word.  
- I L D R S – ""ILDOR"" – no.  

""ICHOR"" seems to be the only valid word fitting the pattern I _ _ R S with letters not yet excluded.

Let's check:
- I (position 1) – allowed.  
- C (position 2) – not excluded.  
- H (position 3) – not excluded.  
- R (position 4) – must be here (only allowed position left).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best starting words typically have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to maximize information gain

A popular and effective first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All unique letters
- Good letter distribution across positions

This gives me the best chance to get useful feedback about multiple common letters right away.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains R and S somewhere.
- Does NOT contain A, O, or E.
- R is not in position 2.
- S is not in position 4.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Keeps R and S in new positions.
2. Avoids A, O, E.
3. Introduces other common consonants and vowels (I, U, T, L, N, etc.).

A good candidate is “TRIPS”:
- T, I, P are new letters.
- R moves to position 1 (allowed).
- S moves to position 5 (allowed).
- No A, O, E.
- Common letters and good coverage.

Let’s go with TRIPS.

Guess 2: TRIPS -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) I(-) P(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE  
A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
→ R and S are in the word but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.  
→ A, O, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: TRIPS  
T(x) R(-) I(-) P(x) S(✓)  
→ S is in position 5 (✓).  
→ R is in the word but not in position 2 (still true) and now also not in position 1.  
→ I is in the word but not in position 3.  
→ T and P are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: R, S, I  
- S is locked in position 5.  
- R cannot be in positions 1 or 2.  
- I cannot be in position 3.  
- Letters excluded: A, O, E, T, P.

We need a 5-letter word ending in S, containing R and I, with R not in positions 1 or 2, and I not in position 3.

Possible positions for R: 3, 4  
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 4

Let’s try to place them:
- If R is in position 3: _ _ R _ S  
- If R is in position 4: _ _ _ R S  

And I must fit into 1, 2, or 4 (not 3).

A good candidate is “CRISP” but P is excluded.  
“DRIPS” – P excluded.  
“GRINS” – S is in 5, R in 3, I in 2. This fits all constraints:
- G, N are new letters (not excluded).  
- R is in position 3 (allowed).  
- I is in position 2 (allowed).  
- S is in position 5 (matches ✓).  
- No A, O, E, T, P.

- I is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from TRIPS and GRINS feedback).  
  Therefore I must be in position 1.

So the word has the fixed pattern: I _ _ R S

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, O, E, T, P, G, N

We need to fill positions 2 and 3 with letters that are:
- not yet excluded
- valid English letters

- ""MURDRS"" – too long.

- I D R S – no.  
- I L R S – no.  
- I M R S – no.

- I L Y R S – ""ILYRS"" – not a word.  
- I M B R S – ""IMBRS"" – not a word.

Let's update what we now know after four guesses.

Letters that must be in the word: R, S, I  
- S is locked in position 5 (✓ from guesses 2, 3, 4).  
- I is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3 (from GRINS and ICHOR feedback).  
  Therefore I must be in position 4.  
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (from TRIPS, GRINS, ICHOR feedback).  
  But there are only five positions, and position 5 is already S.  
  This is impossible: R cannot be in the word under these constraints.

This means our earlier assumption must be wrong.  
Re-examining the feedback:

Guess 4: ICHOR → I(-) C(x) H(x) O(x) R(-)  
- I(-) means I is in the word but not in position 1.  
- R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 5 (which we already knew).  
  It does NOT say R is not in position 4 — we misread it.  
  So R could still be in position 4.

Corrected constraints:
- S is in position 5.  
- I is in the word and NOT in positions 1, 2, 3 → must be in position 4.  
- R is in the word and NOT in positions 1, 2, 3 → must be in position 4, but position 4 is taken by I.  
  This is still a contradiction.

Wait — the feedback for ICHOR shows R(-) in position 5, which means R is in the word but not in position 5 (which we already knew).  
The contradiction remains: I must be in position 4, and R must be somewhere else (positions 1, 2, or 3), but earlier feedback said R is not in positions 1, 2, 3.  
Let me re-list R restrictions:

From TRIPS: R not in position 1 or 2.  
From GRINS: R not in position 3.  
From ICHOR: R not in position 5.  
Thus R must be in position 4.

But I must also be in the word and not in positions 1, 2, 3 → must be in position 4.  
This forces R and I to both occupy position 4, which is impossible.

This indicates an error in our interpretation.  
Rechecking:  
Guess 3: GRINS → R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 2.  
Guess 4: ICHOR → R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 5.  
Thus R can still be in positions 3 or 4.

Let's re-tabulate:

Letters known to be in the word: R, S, I  
- S is in position 5.  
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 5 → possible positions 3 or 4.  
- I is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 1 → possible positions 4.

Thus:
- If I is in position 4, then R must be in position 3 (since it can't be in 4 because I is there).  
  This gives the pattern: _ _ R I S

Letters excluded so far: A, O, E, T, P, G, N, C, H, U (from ICHOR's I(-) and C(x), H(x), O(x)).

We need a 5-letter word ending in ""RIS"" with pattern _ _ R I S.

Possible words:
- ""FURIS"" – not valid.  
- ""BURIS"" – not valid.  
- ""DURIS"" – not valid.  
- ""MURIS"" – not valid.  
- ""LURIS"" – not valid.  
- ""SULIS"" – not valid.  
- ""VIRIS"" – valid (plural of ""vira"", a biological term).

""VIRIS"" fits:
- V (position 1) – not excluded.  
- I (position 2) – allowed (we only know I is not in positions 1,2,3 from GRINS, but GRINS said I(-) meaning not in position 2, not 3).  
Wait — GRINS feedback: I(-) means I is in the word but not in position 3.  
Thus I can be in positions 1, 2, 4, 5.  
But position 5 is S, and from ICHOR I(-) means not in position 1.  
Thus I can be in positions 2 or 4.

In ""VIRIS"":
- I is in position 2 – allowed.  
- R is in position 3 – allowed (not excluded).  
- S is in position 5 – correct.  
- V and the remaining letter (position 1) must be chosen from allowed letters.

Actually, let's think of the pattern _ _ R I S with letters not excluded.  
Possible words:
- ""FURIS"" – no.  
- ""BURIS"" – no.  
- ""SURIS"" – no.  
- ""CURIS"" – C is excluded.  
- ""LURIS"" – no.  
- ""MURIS"" – no.  
- ""SURIS"" – no.  
- ""DURIS"" – no.

- ""VIRIS"" – seems the only valid one.

""VIRIS"" is the best candidate.

After carefully re-evaluating the feedback, the only remaining possibility is the word ""VIRIS"" which fits all constraints:

- Ends with ""RIS"" (S in 5, R in 3, I in 2).  
- Uses only letters not yet excluded.  

<guess>VIRIS</guess>",VIRIS,"Let's update what we now know after four guesses.

Letters that must be in the word: R, S, I  
- S is locked in position 5 (✓ from guesses 2, 3, 4).  
- I is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3 (from GRINS and ICHOR feedback).  
  Therefore I must be in position 4.  
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (from TRIPS, GRINS, ICHOR feedback).  
  But there are only five positions, and position 5 is already S.  
  This is impossible: R cannot be in the word under these constraints.

This means our earlier assumption must be wrong.  
Re-examining the feedback:

Guess 4: ICHOR → I(-) C(x) H(x) O(x) R(-)  
- I(-) means I is in the word but not in position 1.  
- R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 5 (which we already knew).  
  It does NOT say R is not in position 4 — we misread it.  
  So R could still be in position 4.

Corrected constraints:
- S is in position 5.  
- I is in the word and NOT in positions 1, 2, 3 → must be in position 4.  
- R is in the word and NOT in positions 1, 2, 3 → must be in position 4, but position 4 is taken by I.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best starting words typically have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to maximize information gain

A popular and effective first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All unique letters
- Good letter distribution across positions

This gives me the best chance to get useful feedback about multiple common letters right away.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains R and S somewhere.
- Does NOT contain A, O, or E.
- R is not in position 2.
- S is not in position 4.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Keeps R and S in new positions.
2. Avoids A, O, E.
3. Introduces other common consonants and vowels (I, U, T, L, N, etc.).

A good candidate is “TRIPS”:
- T, I, P are new letters.
- R moves to position 1 (allowed).
- S moves to position 5 (allowed).
- No A, O, E.
- Common letters and good coverage.

Let’s go with TRIPS.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: TRIPS -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) I(-) P(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE  
A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
→ R and S are in the word but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.  
→ A, O, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: TRIPS  
T(x) R(-) I(-) P(x) S(✓)  
→ S is in position 5 (✓).  
→ R is in the word but not in position 2 (still true) and now also not in position 1.  
→ I is in the word but not in position 3.  
→ T and P are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: R, S, I  
- S is locked in position 5.  
- R cannot be in positions 1 or 2.  
- I cannot be in position 3.  
- Letters excluded: A, O, E, T, P.

We need a 5-letter word ending in S, containing R and I, with R not in positions 1 or 2, and I not in position 3.

Possible positions for R: 3, 4  
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 4

Let’s try to place them:
- If R is in position 3: _ _ R _ S  
- If R is in position 4: _ _ _ R S  

And I must fit into 1, 2, or 4 (not 3).

A good candidate is “CRISP” but P is excluded.  
“DRIPS” – P excluded.  
“GRINS” – S is in 5, R in 3, I in 2. This fits all constraints:
- G, N are new letters (not excluded).  
- R is in position 3 (allowed).  
- I is in position 2 (allowed).  
- S is in position 5 (matches ✓).  
- No A, O, E, T, P.

Let’s use GRINS.

Guess 3: GRINS -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(-) I(-) N(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Letters we know are in the word: R, S, I  
- S is locked in position 5 (✓ from Guess 2 and 3).  
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from TRIPS and GRINS feedback).  
  Therefore R must be in position 4.  
- I is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from TRIPS and GRINS feedback).  
  Therefore I must be in position 1.

So the word has the fixed pattern: I _ _ R S

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, O, E, T, P, G, N

We need to fill positions 2 and 3 with letters that are:
- not yet excluded
- valid English letters

Available consonants/vowels left: B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let's think of common 5-letter words ending in ""IRS"":
- ""HIRS"" is not valid (needs 5 letters).  
- ""FURRS"" – no, has two R's and S is already fixed at 5.  
- ""MURDRS"" – too long.  
- ""CIVILS"" – too long.  
- ""FUROR"" – doesn't fit.  

Wait, we need to fit I _ _ R S.

Let's list possible combinations:
- I B R S – no, needs 5 letters.  
- I C R S – no.  
- I D R S – no.  
- I L R S – no.  
- I M R S – no.  
- I C H R S – no.  
- I C L R S – no.  

Actually, we need to think of 5-letter words with pattern I _ _ R S.

Some possibilities:
- I C H R S – ""ICHOR"" (valid word, means a golden fluid in ancient times)  
- I L Y R S – ""ILYRS"" – not a word.  
- I M B R S – ""IMBRS"" – not a word.  
- I L D R S – ""ILDOR"" – no.  

""ICHOR"" seems to be the only valid word fitting the pattern I _ _ R S with letters not yet excluded.

Let's check:
- I (position 1) – allowed.  
- C (position 2) – not excluded.  
- H (position 3) – not excluded.  
- R (position 4) – must be here (only allowed position left).  
- S (position 5) – locked.  

No conflicts with previous exclusions.

Therefore, the next logical guess is ICHOR.

Guess 5: VIRIS  
V(x) I(✓) R(✓) I(-) S(✓)

- V is not in the word.  
- I is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).  
- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).  
- The second I is in the word but NOT in position 4 (so it must be in position 1 or 5).  
- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

But position 5 is already S, so the second I cannot be in position 5. Therefore the second I must be in position 1, but that would require two I's in positions 1 and 2, which contradicts I(✓) in position 2. This indicates the second I is simply confirming the first I is correct and the word has only one I.

Thus the pattern is now:
Position 1: ?
Position 2: I
Position 3: R
Position 4: ?
Position 5: S

Letters known to be in the word: I, R, S  
Letters known to be excluded: A, O, E, T, P, G, N, C, H, V

We need a 5-letter word with the pattern _ I R _ S, using only allowed letters.

Possible letters for positions 1 and 4: B, D, F, K, L, M, U, W, Y, etc.

Looking for common words:
- ""FIRMS"" – F, I, R, M, S. All letters allowed.  
- ""DIRKS"" – D, I, R, K, S. All letters allowed.  
- ""LIRKS"" – L, I, R, K, S. All letters allowed.  
- ""WRIST"" – W, R, I, S, T. T is excluded.  
- ""BRISK"" – B, R, I, S, K. R is in position 3, but this would place R in position 2, which contradicts R(✓) in position 3.  

""FIRMS"" fits perfectly:
- F (position 1) – allowed.  
- I (position 2) – correct.  
- R (position 3) – correct.  
- M (position 4) – allowed.  
- S (position 5) – correct.

This is the only remaining possibility that satisfies all feedback.
