For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct, common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

Some excellent starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

Since A must appear somewhere, and it can't be in positions 1 or 3, possible positions for A are 2, 4, or 5.

Also, S is already in position 1, so we need to place A and three other distinct consonants (no repeats of letters we know are out).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct, common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

Some excellent starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1  
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all  
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all  
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4  
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all  

So we know:
- The word contains A and S, but not R, O, or E.  
- A cannot be the first letter, and S cannot be the fourth letter.  

Next, I want a word that:
1. Uses A and S in new positions.  
2. Avoids R, O, E.  
3. Introduces new common consonants (T, L, N, C, D, etc.) and vowels (I, U).  

A good candidate is “STAIN”:
- S is moved to position 1 (allowed).  
- A is in position 3 (allowed).  
- T, I, N are new common letters.  
- No R, O, E.  

Let’s try STAIN.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STAIN -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. STAIN → S(✓) T(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   - S is correct in position 1.
   - T, I, N are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- The word starts with S.
- It contains A, but A is not in position 1 or 3.
- It does not contain R, O, E, T, I, N.

Letters still allowed: A, S, plus any remaining consonants (B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z) and vowels (U, since A is already confirmed and E, I, O are out).

Since A must appear somewhere, and it can't be in positions 1 or 3, possible positions for A are 2, 4, or 5.

Also, S is already in position 1, so we need to place A and three other distinct consonants (no repeats of letters we know are out).

Let's think of common 5-letter words starting with S, containing A, and avoiding all excluded letters.

Possible candidates:
- S _ A _ _ (A in position 3 is invalid, so this would be S _ A _ _ but A can't be in position 3, so this is invalid)
- S _ _ A _ (A in position 4)
- S _ _ _ A (A in position 5)

Looking at common words:
- SUADS (but D is allowed, but this seems uncommon)
- SCAMP (but P is allowed, but we don't know about C, M, P yet)
- SALAD (but L, D are allowed, but A is repeated which might not be allowed)
- SALSA (but S is repeated, which might not be allowed)
- SCARF (but R is excluded)
- SCUBA (but U, B are allowed, and A is in position 5)

SCUBA seems valid:
- S in position 1 (correct)
- C, U, B are new letters (not excluded)
- A in position 5 (allowed)
- No excluded letters (R, O, E, T, I, N)

Let's try SCUBA.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct, common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

Some excellent starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1  
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all  
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all  
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4  
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all  

So we know:
- The word contains A and S, but not R, O, or E.  
- A cannot be the first letter, and S cannot be the fourth letter.  

Next, I want a word that:
1. Uses A and S in new positions.  
2. Avoids R, O, E.  
3. Introduces new common consonants (T, L, N, C, D, etc.) and vowels (I, U).  

A good candidate is “STAIN”:
- S is moved to position 1 (allowed).  
- A is in position 3 (allowed).  
- T, I, N are new common letters.  
- No R, O, E.  

Let’s try STAIN.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STAIN -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. STAIN → S(✓) T(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   - S is correct in position 1.
   - T, I, N are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- The word starts with S.
- It contains A, but A is not in position 1 or 3.
- It does not contain R, O, E, T, I, N.

Letters still allowed: A, S, plus any remaining consonants (B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z) and vowels (U, since A is already confirmed and E, I, O are out).

Since A must appear somewhere, and it can't be in positions 1 or 3, possible positions for A are 2, 4, or 5.

Also, S is already in position 1, so we need to place A and three other distinct consonants (no repeats of letters we know are out).

Let's think of common 5-letter words starting with S, containing A, and avoiding all excluded letters.

Possible candidates:
- S _ A _ _ (A in position 3 is invalid, so this would be S _ A _ _ but A can't be in position 3, so this is invalid)
- S _ _ A _ (A in position 4)
- S _ _ _ A (A in position 5)

Looking at common words:
- SUADS (but D is allowed, but this seems uncommon)
- SCAMP (but P is allowed, but we don't know about C, M, P yet)
- SALAD (but L, D are allowed, but A is repeated which might not be allowed)
- SALSA (but S is repeated, which might not be allowed)
- SCARF (but R is excluded)
- SCUBA (but U, B are allowed, and A is in position 5)

SCUBA seems valid:
- S in position 1 (correct)
- C, U, B are new letters (not excluded)
- A in position 5 (allowed)
- No excluded letters (R, O, E, T, I, N)

Let's try SCUBA.

- Cannot contain: R, O, E, T, I, N, C, U, B.
- Remaining letters allowed: A, S, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, with A in position 2 or 4, and three other consonants from the allowed set.

- S _ _ A _:  SHARK (R excluded), SKAMP (K, M, P allowed), SLACK (C excluded), SMARM (M allowed, but repeats S,M,A)

This is proving difficult. Let’s list all remaining allowed letters:
A, S, D, F, G, H, J, L, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word starting with S, containing A once, and A in position 2 or 4.

Possible words:
- S A D _ _ (SAD__): SADLY (L allowed, Y allowed)
- S A D L Y – SALDY (no, SADLY is a word)
- S A D L Y – SADLY: S A D L Y
   - A in position 2 (allowed)
   - Letters: S, A, D, L, Y – none are excluded
   - This seems valid.

Let’s check SADLY:
- S A D L Y
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- No excluded letters
- This is a valid word.

Thus, the next guess should be SADLY.

From the latest feedback:

5. SADLY → S(✓) A(✓) D(x) L(-) Y(x)

- S is correct in position 1.
- A is correct in position 2.
- D and Y are not in the word.
- L is in the word but not in position 4.

So the word looks like: S A _ _ _

Letters already used and confirmed:
- S (position 1)
- A (position 2)

Letters known to be absent: R, O, E, T, I, N, C, U, B, K, M, P, D, Y

Letters still allowed: F, G, H, J, L, Q, V, W, X, Z

Also, L must appear somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5 (since it’s not in position 4 from SADLY).

Possible patterns:
- S A _ L _
- S A _ _ L

Looking at remaining letters, we need to fill the blanks with allowed letters and include L.

Possible words:
- S A F L _ (SAFLL – no)
- S A L F _ (SALFX – no)
- S A L _ _ (SAL_ _): SALSA (S repeats, but S is allowed)
- S A L _ _ (SAL_ _): SALSV – no
- S A L _ _ (SAL_ _): SALSA is the only possible word, but S repeats.

Looking at S A _ _ L:
- S A F F L – no
- S A G G L – no
- S A H H L – no
- S A L L L – no
- S A V V L – no

Actually, looking at S A _ L _:
- S A L L _ – SALLS (plural of salsa? No, not common)
- S A L L _ – SALLS (not standard)

Looking at S A _ _ L:
- S A L _ L – SAL_L (no common word)

Wait, let’s think of S A _ L _:
- S A L L _ – SALLS (not standard)
- S A L _ _ – SAL_ _ (SALSA is a word, but S repeats)

Looking at S A _ _ L:
- S A L _ L – no

Actually, the only possible word seems to be SALSA, even though S repeats. But S is allowed to appear more than once.

But let’s check SALSA:
- S A L S A
- Positions: S(1), A(2), L(3), S(4), A(5)
- A is already confirmed in position 2, and the feedback didn’t say anything about A appearing twice.
- The feedback only confirmed A in position 2, but didn’t prohibit it from appearing elsewhere.

However, in SADLY, A(✓) in position 2 means that position 2 is correct, but doesn’t necessarily mean A only appears once. So SALSA is possible.

But let’s see if there’s another word. The remaining letters are F, G, H, J, L, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Looking at S A _ _ L:
- S A F F L – no
- S A G G L – no
- S A H H L – no
- S A L L L – no
- S A V V L – no

Looking at S A _ L _:

- S A G L _ – SAGLL – no
- S A H L _ – SAHLL – no
- S A L L _ – SALLL – no
- S A V L _ – SA V L _ – no

This suggests SALSA might be the only possible word, despite S and A repeating.

But let’s think differently: maybe L is in position 3 or 5.

Looking at S A _ _ L (L in position 5):
- S A _ _ L: possible letters F, G, H, J, Q, V, W, X, Z
- Need two letters from these for positions 3 and 4.

Possible combinations:
- S A F G L – SAFGL – no
- S A F H L – SAFHL – no
- S A F V L – SAFVL – no
- S A G H L – SAGHL – no
- S A H V L – SAHVL – no

Similarly, no common words seem to form.

Looking at S A _ L _ (L in position 4):
- S A _ L _: need two letters for positions 3 and 5
- Possible: S A F L G – SAFLG – no
- S A H L F – SAHLF – no

This is proving difficult. The most plausible word seems to be SALSA, even with the repeated letters.

But let’s verify:
- S A L S A
- S(1) confirmed ✓
- A(2) confirmed ✓
- L(3) – not yet excluded
- S(4) – allowed to repeat
- A(5) – allowed to repeat (no feedback against it)

Given the constraints, SALSA appears to be the only possible word.

</think>

Based on the latest feedback, the word must start with ""SA"" and contain the letter L somewhere (but not in position 4). After checking all possible combinations with the remaining allowed letters (F, G, H, J, L, Q, V, W, X, Z), the only valid word that fits is:

Looking at S A _ L _ (L in position 4):
- S A _ L _: need two letters for positions 3 and 5
- Possible: S A F L G – SAFLG – no
- S A H L F – SAHLF – no

This is proving difficult. The most plausible word seems to be SALSA, even with the repeated letters.

But let’s verify:
- S A L S A
- S(1) confirmed ✓
- A(2) confirmed ✓
- L(3) – not yet excluded
- S(4) – allowed to repeat
- A(5) – allowed to repeat (no feedback against it)

Given the constraints, SALSA appears to be the only possible word.Based on the latest feedback, the word must start with ""SA"" and contain the letter L somewhere (but not in position 4). After checking all possible combinations with the remaining allowed letters (F, G, H, J, L, Q, V, W, X, Z), the only valid word that fits is:",Guess 6: SALSA -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(✓) L(✓) S(-) A(-),FAIL
