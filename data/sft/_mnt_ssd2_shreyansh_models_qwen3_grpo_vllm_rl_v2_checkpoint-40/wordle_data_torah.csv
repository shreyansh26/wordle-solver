For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use vowels and common consonants to maximize information gain. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of frequently used letters in English 5-letter words. Let me go with AROSE.

So the secret word contains the letters A, R, and O, but none of them are in the positions they occupied in AROSE. It does not contain S or E.

Since we have three confirmed letters (A, R, O) and two positions still unknown, we need a word that:
1. Uses A, R, and O in different positions from before.
2. Adds two new consonants that haven’t been ruled out (avoiding S and E).

A good next guess would be something like “RADIO”. This uses:
- R in position 1 (was in position 2 before)
- A in position 2 (was in position 1 before)
- D and I are new letters that haven’t been tested yet
- O is in position 4 (was in position 3 before)

This should help us determine the correct positions for A, R, and O while introducing two new letters.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong positions so far):
   - A (cannot be 1st or 2nd)
   - R (cannot be 1st or 2nd)
   - O (cannot be 3rd or 5th)

2. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
   - S, E, D, I

So the secret word contains A, R, and O exactly once each, and two other letters that are not S, E, D, or I.

Possible remaining consonants (not yet ruled out): B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A, R, O (each once) and two new consonants from the allowed set.
- Places A, R, O in positions they have not yet occupied (A not 1st/2nd, R not 1st/2nd, O not 3rd/5th).

Let’s try a word that satisfies these constraints. A good candidate is “COBRA”:
- C and B are new letters not yet tested.
- Positions: C(1), O(2), B(3), R(4), A(5).
  - A is in 5th (allowed).
  - R is in 4th (allowed).
  - O is in 2nd (allowed).

This gives us fresh consonants (C, B) and places the known letters in new spots.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use vowels and common consonants to maximize information gain. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of frequently used letters in English 5-letter words. Let me go with AROSE.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word contains the letters A, R, and O, but none of them are in the positions they occupied in AROSE. It does not contain S or E.

Since we have three confirmed letters (A, R, O) and two positions still unknown, we need a word that:
1. Uses A, R, and O in different positions from before.
2. Adds two new consonants that haven’t been ruled out (avoiding S and E).

A good next guess would be something like “RADIO”. This uses:
- R in position 1 (was in position 2 before)
- A in position 2 (was in position 1 before)
- D and I are new letters that haven’t been tested yet
- O is in position 4 (was in position 3 before)

This should help us determine the correct positions for A, R, and O while introducing two new letters.

   - R (cannot be 1st or 2nd)
   - O (cannot be 3rd or 5th)

2. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
   - S, E, D, I

So the secret word contains A, R, and O exactly once each, and two other letters that are not S, E, D, or I.

Possible remaining consonants (not yet ruled out): B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A, R, O (each once) and two new consonants from the allowed set.
- Places A, R, O in positions they have not yet occupied (A not 1st/2nd, R not 1st/2nd, O not 3rd/5th).

Let’s try a word that satisfies these constraints. A good candidate is “COBRA”:
- C and B are new letters not yet tested.
- Positions: C(1), O(2), B(3), R(4), A(5).
  - A is in 5th (allowed).
  - R is in 4th (allowed).

This gives us fresh consonants (C, B) and places the known letters in new spots.

A quick check of common English words gives us “GORAL” (a type of mountain goat) or “PORAL” (rare), but both are uncommon.  
The most common and valid word fitting this pattern is “GORAL”.

However, “GORAL” is a bit obscure. Let me double-check a more common word:  
“TORAN” is not valid. “HORSE” has E (ruled out). “CORAL” has C (ruled out).  
Actually, “GORAL” is the only valid 5-letter word I can find that fits G _ O R A L.

So the secret word contains the letters A, R, and O, but none of them are in the positions they occupied in AROSE. It does not contain S or E.

Since we have three confirmed letters (A, R, O) and two positions still unknown, we need a word that:

- D and I are new letters that haven’t been tested yet

This should help us determine the correct positions for A, R, and O while introducing two new letters.

- A cannot be 1st or 2nd (from AROSE and RADIO feedback) → A must be 3rd, 4th, or 5th.
- R cannot be 1st, 2nd, or 5th (from AROSE, RADIO, COBRA feedback) → R must be 3rd or 4th.

Let’s try a word that satisfies:
- O in 2nd
- A and R placed in allowed spots
- two new consonants

A good candidate: F O R A M
- Positions: F(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), M(5)
- A is in 4th (allowed)
- R is in 3rd (allowed)
- F and M are new letters not yet tested.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: RADIO -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) D(x) I(x) O(-)
Guess 3: COBRA -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(✓) B(x) R(-) A(-)
Guess 4: FORAM -> FEEDBACK: F(x) O(✓) R(✓) A(✓) M(x)

From Guess 4 (FORAM) we now have:

Positions:
1: F(x) – F is not in the word.
2: O(✓) – O is correct in position 2.
3: R(✓) – R is correct in position 3.
4: A(✓) – A is correct in position 4.
5: M(x) – M is not in the word.

So the pattern is now fixed for four positions:
_ O R A _

We only need the first letter.  
Letters already ruled out (from all guesses):  
S, E, D, I, C, B, F, M.

Remaining unused consonants that could start a valid word:  
G, H, K, L, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word of the form ? O R A ?.  
The only missing letter is the first one.  
A quick check of common English words gives us “GORAL” (a type of mountain goat) or “PORAL” (rare), but both are uncommon.  
The most common and valid word fitting this pattern is “GORAL”.

However, “GORAL” is a bit obscure. Let me double-check a more common word:  
“TORAN” is not valid. “HORSE” has E (ruled out). “CORAL” has C (ruled out).  
Actually, “GORAL” is the only valid 5-letter word I can find that fits G _ O R A L.  

But wait, the pattern is _ O R A _, so the word must be 5 letters total, ending with _ A _ (but we have A in position 4).  
Actually, the pattern is:  
Position 1: ?  
Position 2: O  
Position 3: R  
Position 4: A  
Position 5: ?  

So the word is ? O R A ?.  
We need a 5-letter word that is O R A _ in positions 2-4.  
The only common word is “GORAL” (as above) or “PORAL” (rare).  
Another possibility is “TORAL” (as in the torminal region), but T is still allowed.  
Let’s pick “GORAL” as it’s the most recognized.

But to be safe, let’s check “GORAL” is valid: yes, it’s a recognized 5-letter word (a type of goat).  
So the final guess is GORAL.
