For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once. 

Some good starting words include:
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (contains C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that uses as many of these as possible without repeating letters.

""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeats. This should give us good coverage to narrow down the possibilities for the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the 3rd letter is O
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so S appears somewhere other than the 4th position
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so E appears somewhere other than the 5th position

Constraints so far:
1. Word is _ _ O _ _
2. Must contain S and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively
3. Must NOT contain A or R
4. Remaining letters can be any of the other 21 letters (excluding A and R)

Good next-step words should:
- Keep O in the 3rd position
- Include S and E in new positions
- Avoid A and R
- Prefer common letters not yet eliminated

Possible candidates:
- STONE (but N is new, T is common) – but E is in position 5 which was wrong
- SHOVE (H and V are new) – E in position 5 is invalid
- SPOKE (P and K are new) – E in position 5 is invalid
- STOLE (T, L are new) – E in position 5 is invalid
- SLOPE (L, P are new) – E in position 5 is invalid
- SPELO (but O is already fixed in position 3, so this would move O)

Better approach: Place S and E in new positions, and introduce new common letters.

Let’s try ""STONE"":
- S in position 1 (new position)
- T in position 2 (new letter)
- O in position 3 (correct)
- N in position 4 (new letter)
- E in position 5 (but feedback said E is in wrong position, so this is invalid)

Next try ""SPOKE"":
- S in position 1 (new)
- P in position 2 (new)
- O in position 3 (correct)
- K in position 4 (new)
- E in position 5 (invalid, same issue)

We need to move E away from position 5. Let’s try ""SLOPE"":
- S in position 1 (new)
- L in position 2 (new)
- O in position 3 (correct)
- P in position 4 (new)
- E in position 5 (invalid)

Next try ""SHEET"":
- S in position 1 (new)
- H in position 2 (new)
- E in position 3 (new position)
- E in position 4 (but E is already in word, and we don’t know if it appears twice)
- T in position 5 (new position)

But E in position 5 was invalid in AROSE, so this is risky.

Still invalid. Let’s try ""SOLTE"":

- L in position 2 (new)

This seems valid:

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Pattern so far: _ L O _ _  
   (because O is fixed in position 3 and L is fixed in position 2)

2. Letters that are definitely in the word:
   - O (position 3)
   - L (position 2)
   - S (somewhere, but NOT positions 1 or 4)
   - E (somewhere, but NOT positions 3, 4, or 5)

3. Letters that are definitely NOT in the word:
   A, R, P, T

4. Therefore S and E must occupy positions 5 and 1 in some order:
   - S cannot be in 1 or 4, and E cannot be in 3, 4, or 5.
   - The only remaining positions for S and E are 1 and 5.

So the word must be one of:
   E L O S _
   or
   S L O E _

But we still need a 5th letter.  The first pattern (E L O S _) would require a letter in position 5 that we haven’t ruled out.  The second pattern (S L O E _) would require a letter in position 1 that we haven’t ruled out.

Looking at common 5-letter words that fit:
- S L O E _ → “SLOED” (not a word), “SLOES” (but S already used), “SLOES” (same)
- E L O S _ → “ELOS_” – nothing common

Wait, let’s re-examine the constraints more carefully:

Positions:
1: cannot be A, R, P, T, S (because S cannot be in 1), E (because E cannot be in 5)
2: must be L
3: must be O
4: cannot be A, R, P, T, E (because E cannot be in 4)
5: cannot be A, R, P, T, E (because E cannot be in 5), S (because S cannot be in 4)

So the only remaining letters for positions 1 and 4 are from the rest of the alphabet excluding A, R, P, T, E, S.

Common letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, U, V, W, Y, etc.

But we have two unknown positions: 1 and 4, and we need a valid word.

Let’s list possible words that fit _ L O _ _ with letters from the allowed set and contain both S and E in the remaining positions.

Given that S must be in 5 and E in 1:
Word form: E L O _ S
The only common word fitting is “ELBOS” (but B is allowed).

Check constraints:
- E in 1: allowed (E was only excluded from 3,4,5)
- L in 2: correct
- O in 3: correct
- B in 4: allowed
- S in 5: allowed (S was only excluded from 1,4)

“ELBOS” is a valid 5-letter English word.

Let’s verify:
- Contains all required letters (E, L, O, S)
- No forbidden letters (A, R, P, T)
- Meets positional constraints

Therefore, “ELBOS” is the best next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once. 

Some good starting words include:
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (contains C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that uses as many of these as possible without repeating letters.

""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeats. This should give us good coverage to narrow down the possibilities for the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the 3rd letter is O
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so S appears somewhere other than the 4th position
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so E appears somewhere other than the 5th position

Constraints so far:
1. Word is _ _ O _ _
2. Must contain S and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively
3. Must NOT contain A or R
4. Remaining letters can be any of the other 21 letters (excluding A and R)

Good next-step words should:
- Keep O in the 3rd position
- Include S and E in new positions
- Avoid A and R
- Prefer common letters not yet eliminated

Possible candidates:
- STONE (but N is new, T is common) – but E is in position 5 which was wrong
- SHOVE (H and V are new) – E in position 5 is invalid
- SPOKE (P and K are new) – E in position 5 is invalid
- STOLE (T, L are new) – E in position 5 is invalid
- SLOPE (L, P are new) – E in position 5 is invalid
- SPELO (but O is already fixed in position 3, so this would move O)

Better approach: Place S and E in new positions, and introduce new common letters.

Let’s try ""STONE"":
- S in position 1 (new position)
- T in position 2 (new letter)
- O in position 3 (correct)
- N in position 4 (new letter)
- E in position 5 (but feedback said E is in wrong position, so this is invalid)

Next try ""SPOKE"":
- S in position 1 (new)
- P in position 2 (new)
- O in position 3 (correct)
- K in position 4 (new)
- E in position 5 (invalid, same issue)

We need to move E away from position 5. Let’s try ""SLOPE"":
- S in position 1 (new)
- L in position 2 (new)
- O in position 3 (correct)
- P in position 4 (new)
- E in position 5 (invalid)

Next try ""SHEET"":
- S in position 1 (new)
- H in position 2 (new)
- E in position 3 (new position)
- E in position 4 (but E is already in word, and we don’t know if it appears twice)
- T in position 5 (new position)

But E in position 5 was invalid in AROSE, so this is risky.

Better: ""SHOVE"":
- S in position 1 (new)
- H in position 2 (new)
- O in position 3 (correct)
- V in position 4 (new)
- E in position 5 (invalid)

This seems problematic. Let’s try ""SPORE"":
- S in position 1 (new)
- P in position 2 (new)
- O in position 3 (correct)
- R in position 4 (but R is invalid)
- E in position 5 (invalid)

Not good. Let’s try ""SLOTE"":
- S in position 1 (new)
- L in position 2 (new)
- O in position 3 (correct)
- T in position 4 (new)
- E in position 5 (invalid)

Still invalid. Let’s try ""SOLTE"":
- S in position 1 (new)
- O in position 2 (but O must be in position 3)
- Not valid.

Let’s try ""SLEPT"":
- S in position 1 (new)
- L in position 2 (new)
- E in position 3 (new position)
- P in position 4 (new)
- T in position 5 (new)

This seems valid:
- S is in position 1 (was in position 4 before, now new)
- E is in position 3 (was in position 5 before, now new)
- No A or R
- New letters L, P, T introduced

This looks like a good next guess.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Known positions  
- 2: L (✓)  
- 3: O (✓)  

Known letters in word (positions still unknown)  
- S (must appear, but cannot be in 1, 4, or 5)  
- E (must appear, but cannot be in 1, 3, 4, or 5)  

Forbidden letters (never appear)  
A, R, P, T, B  

Forbidden positions  
- S: not 1, 4, 5 → must be in position 2  
- E: not 1, 3, 4, 5 → must be in position 2  

But position 2 is already L.  
Therefore the only way both S and E can be in the word is if one of them is in position 2, but position 2 is L.  
This contradiction shows that at least one of S or E must appear exactly once and the other must appear once in the remaining single valid spot.

Re-examining constraints carefully:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
- 2 = L (fixed)  
- 3 = O (fixed)  

Letters that must appear: S and E  
- S cannot be in 1, 4, 5 → only possible in 2, but 2 is L → impossible  
- E cannot be in 1, 3, 4, 5 → only possible in 2, but 2 is L → impossible  

This means our earlier assumption was flawed. Actually, the feedback shows that S and E are both in the word but not necessarily each appearing once. The only way both can fit is if one of them appears twice or we miscounted.

Looking back:

From Guess 1 (AROSE):  
A(x), R(x), O(✓), S(-), E(-)  
→ O is correct in position 3  
→ S is in word, not in 4  
→ E is in word, not in 5  

From Guess 2 (SLEPT):  
S(-), L(✓), E(-), P(x), T(x)  
→ L is correct in position 2  
→ E is in word, not in 3  
→ S is in word, not in 1  

From Guess 3 (ELBOS):  
E(-), L(✓), B(x), O(-), S(✓)  
→ O is in word but not in 3 (but we know from Guess 1 it must be in 3) → contradiction  
Wait, this is impossible. The feedback for O in Guess 3 says O(-), meaning O is in word but not in position 3, but Guess 1 already showed O is in position 3. This must be a typo in my reading. Actually, the feedback for Guess 3 is:

E(-) L(✓) B(x) O(-) S(✓)

This means:
- E is in word but not in 1  
- L is correct in 2  
- B is not in word  
- O is in word but not in 4 (position 4 is last letter)  
- S is correct in 5  

Ah! This changes everything.

Now we have:
- Position 2: L (✓)  
- Position 5: S (✓)  
- Position 3: O (✓) from Guess 1, and from Guess 3 O(-) means it’s not in 4, so it must be in 3  
Thus the pattern is: _ L O _ S  

Letters known to be in word: E (must appear, not in 1, 3, 4, 5)  
- E cannot be in 1, 3, 4, 5 → only possible in 2, but 2 is L → impossible  

This contradiction implies E must appear twice or we have misread. Rechecking:

From Guess 1: E(-) → E is in word, not in 5  
From Guess 2: E(-) → E is in word, not in 3  
From Guess 3: E(-) → E is in word, not in 1  

Thus E must be in position 4.  

So the word must be: _ L O E S  

Only position 1 remains. Letters not yet excluded (not in A, R, P, T, B) and not yet placed: common remaining letters are C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, U, V, W, Y.  

Looking for common 5-letter words ending in LOES:  
“CLICK” – no  
“CLUES” – ends in UES, not LOES  
“FLOES” – yes! “FLOES” is a valid word meaning “thin sheets of ice”.

Check constraints:
- Position 1: F (allowed)  
- Position 2: L (✓)  
- Position 3: O (✓)  
- Position 4: E (must be here)  
- Position 5: S (✓)  

No forbidden letters, meets all positional constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is FLOES.
