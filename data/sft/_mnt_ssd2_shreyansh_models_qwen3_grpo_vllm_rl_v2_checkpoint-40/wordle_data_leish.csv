For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about the letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D.

Looking at these letters, the word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains five of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This will help me quickly identify which of these common letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O and S which are very common. I'll go with AROSE as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- S is in the word and in the correct 4th position.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5, so it must be in positions 1,2,3, or 4. But position 4 is already S, so E must be in positions 1,2, or 3).
- A, R, O are not in the word at all.

So the word looks like: _ _ _ S _ and must contain an E somewhere in positions 1,2, or 3.

I need to pick a word that:
1. Has S in position 4.
2. Has E in position 1, 2, or 3.
3. Does not contain A, R, or O.

Good remaining common letters to try are T, I, N, L, C, D, U, M, etc.

Possible candidates:
- STEMS (but has S twice, and M might be less common)
- TESLA (but has A which we know is out)
- LENSE (but has N and E in position 3, but has L and N which are good)
- INSET (but has I and N, and E in position 3)
- CREST (but has R which is out)

Looking at these, ""INSET"" seems good - it has S in position 4, E in position 3, and uses common letters I and N. But let me check if it violates any rules (no A,R,O).

Actually, ""INSET"" has S in position 4 and E in position 3, and no A,R,O. That seems valid.

But let me think of a better one - ""STEPS"" has E in position 3 and S in position 4, but has P which is less common. 

""ENSES"" has E in positions 1,2,3,4 but S is in position 4, but has N which is good. But it has S in position 4 and E in position 3.

Another good option is ""TENSE"" - T in 1, E in 2, N in 3, S in 4, E in 5. But this has E in position 5 which we know is wrong (from AROSE feedback), but in TENSE the E in position 5 is the same as in AROSE, so this would get E(-) again. But we need to avoid that.

Wait, in AROSE, E was in position 5 and got (-), so in our next guess we must not put E in position 5. So TENSE would have E in position 5 again, which is bad.

So E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

Let's try ""LINES"" - L in 1, I in 2, N in 3, E in 4, S in 5. But S must be in position 4, so this is wrong.

""ELDER"" has E in position 1, but R is out.

""EXIST"" has E in position 2, X is less common.

""INSET"" seems best - I in 1, N in 2, S in 3, but S must be in 4. Wait no - INSET is I N S E T, so S is in position 3, not 4. That's wrong.

""SNIDE"" has S in position 1, but we need S in position 4.

""STEIN"" has S in position 1, not 4.

""SEINE"" has S in position 1, not 4.

""PISES"" has S in position 4, but P is less common.

""SPIKE"" has S in position 1, not 4.

""DISKS"" has S in position 4, but has D, I, K, S, S. K is less common.

""LISES"" has S in position 4, L in 1, I in 2, S in 3 (but S must be in 4), so this is wrong.

""INSET"" was wrong because S was in position 3.

""INSET"" is I N S E T - S in position 3, not 4. So this is invalid.

Let me re-examine: the word must be _ _ _ S _ with E in positions 1,2, or 3.

Possible patterns:
- E _ _ S _
- _ E _ S _
- _ _ E S _

Letters allowed: any except A, R, O.

Let's try ""EJECT"" - E in 1, J is less common.
""EXILE"" - X is less common.
""ELBOW"" - O is out.
""ELFIN"" - F is less common.
""ENZYM"" - Z is less common.

""DESKS"" has S in position 4 and E in position 2, and no A,R,O. This seems good.

""DESKS"" - D E S K S: S is in position 4 (good), E is in position 2 (good), no A,R,O. This looks valid.

Another option is ""HEXES"" - H E X E S: but X is less common and E is in position 2, S in 4. But this has X which is less common.

""DESKS"" seems best.

But let me check ""DESKS"" - D E S K S: positions 1-5. S is in position 4 (correct), E is in position 2 (which is allowed since E was (-) in position 5 before). This should work.

So my next guess is ""DESKS"".
</think>

Based on the feedback that S is in the correct 4th position and E is in the word but not in the 5th position, I need a word with S in the 4th spot and E somewhere in the first three positions, while avoiding A, R, and O.

A good candidate is ""DESKS"" - it places S correctly in the 4th position and E in the 2nd position, using only allowed letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about the letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D.

Looking at these letters, the word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains five of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This will help me quickly identify which of these common letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O and S which are very common. I'll go with AROSE as my first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- S is in the word and in the correct 4th position.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5, so it must be in positions 1,2,3, or 4. But position 4 is already S, so E must be in positions 1,2, or 3).
- A, R, O are not in the word at all.

So the word looks like: _ _ _ S _ and must contain an E somewhere in positions 1,2, or 3.

I need to pick a word that:
1. Has S in position 4.
2. Has E in position 1, 2, or 3.
3. Does not contain A, R, or O.

Good remaining common letters to try are T, I, N, L, C, D, U, M, etc.

Possible candidates:
- STEMS (but has S twice, and M might be less common)
- TESLA (but has A which we know is out)
- LENSE (but has N and E in position 3, but has L and N which are good)
- INSET (but has I and N, and E in position 3)
- CREST (but has R which is out)

Looking at these, ""INSET"" seems good - it has S in position 4, E in position 3, and uses common letters I and N. But let me check if it violates any rules (no A,R,O).

Actually, ""INSET"" has S in position 4 and E in position 3, and no A,R,O. That seems valid.

But let me think of a better one - ""STEPS"" has E in position 3 and S in position 4, but has P which is less common. 

""ENSES"" has E in positions 1,2,3,4 but S is in position 4, but has N which is good. But it has S in position 4 and E in position 3.

Another good option is ""TENSE"" - T in 1, E in 2, N in 3, S in 4, E in 5. But this has E in position 5 which we know is wrong (from AROSE feedback), but in TENSE the E in position 5 is the same as in AROSE, so this would get E(-) again. But we need to avoid that.

Wait, in AROSE, E was in position 5 and got (-), so in our next guess we must not put E in position 5. So TENSE would have E in position 5 again, which is bad.

So E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

Let's try ""LINES"" - L in 1, I in 2, N in 3, E in 4, S in 5. But S must be in position 4, so this is wrong.

""ELDER"" has E in position 1, but R is out.

""EXIST"" has E in position 2, X is less common.

""INSET"" seems best - I in 1, N in 2, S in 3, but S must be in 4. Wait no - INSET is I N S E T, so S is in position 3, not 4. That's wrong.

""SNIDE"" has S in position 1, but we need S in position 4.

""STEIN"" has S in position 1, not 4.

""SEINE"" has S in position 1, not 4.

""PISES"" has S in position 4, but P is less common.

""SPIKE"" has S in position 1, not 4.

""DISKS"" has S in position 4, but has D, I, K, S, S. K is less common.

""LISES"" has S in position 4, L in 1, I in 2, S in 3 (but S must be in 4), so this is wrong.

""INSET"" was wrong because S was in position 3.

""INSET"" is I N S E T - S in position 3, not 4. So this is invalid.

Let me re-examine: the word must be _ _ _ S _ with E in positions 1,2, or 3.

Possible patterns:
- E _ _ S _
- _ E _ S _
- _ _ E S _

Letters allowed: any except A, R, O.

Let's try ""EJECT"" - E in 1, J is less common.
""EXILE"" - X is less common.
""ELBOW"" - O is out.
""ELFIN"" - F is less common.
""ENZYM"" - Z is less common.

""DESKS"" has S in position 4 and E in position 2, and no A,R,O. This seems good.

""DESKS"" - D E S K S: S is in position 4 (good), E is in position 2 (good), no A,R,O. This looks valid.

Another option is ""HEXES"" - H E X E S: but X is less common and E is in position 2, S in 4. But this has X which is less common.

""DESKS"" seems best.

But let me check ""DESKS"" - D E S K S: positions 1-5. S is in position 4 (correct), E is in position 2 (which is allowed since E was (-) in position 5 before). This should work.

So my next guess is ""DESKS"".Based on the feedback that S is in the correct 4th position and E is in the word but not in the 5th position, I need a word with S in the 4th spot and E somewhere in the first three positions, while avoiding A, R, and O.

A good candidate is ""DESKS"" - it places S correctly in the 4th position and E in the 2nd position, using only allowed letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about the letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D.

Looking at these letters, the word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains five of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This will help me quickly identify which of these common letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O and S which are very common. I'll go with AROSE as my first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- S is in the word and in the correct 4th position.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5, so it must be in positions 1,2,3, or 4. But position 4 is already S, so E must be in positions 1,2, or 3).
- A, R, O are not in the word at all.

So the word looks like: _ _ _ S _ and must contain an E somewhere in positions 1,2, or 3.

I need to pick a word that:
1. Has S in position 4.
2. Has E in position 1, 2, or 3.
3. Does not contain A, R, or O.

Good remaining common letters to try are T, I, N, L, C, D, U, M, etc.

Possible candidates:
- STEMS (but has S twice, and M might be less common)
- TESLA (but has A which we know is out)
- LENSE (but has N and E in position 3, but has L and N which are good)
- INSET (but has I and N, and E in position 3)
- CREST (but has R which is out)

Looking at these, ""INSET"" seems good - it has S in position 4, E in position 3, and uses common letters I and N. But let me check if it violates any rules (no A,R,O).

Actually, ""INSET"" has S in position 4 and E in position 3, and no A,R,O. That seems valid.

But let me think of a better one - ""STEPS"" has E in position 3 and S in position 4, but has P which is less common. 

""ENSES"" has E in positions 1,2,3,4 but S is in position 4, but has N which is good. But it has S in position 4 and E in position 3.

Another good option is ""TENSE"" - T in 1, E in 2, N in 3, S in 4, E in 5. But this has E in position 5 which we know is wrong (from AROSE feedback), but in TENSE the E in position 5 is the same as in AROSE, so this would get E(-) again. But we need to avoid that.

Wait, in AROSE, E was in position 5 and got (-), so in our next guess we must not put E in position 5. So TENSE would have E in position 5 again, which is bad.

So E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

Let's try ""LINES"" - L in 1, I in 2, N in 3, E in 4, S in 5. But S must be in position 4, so this is wrong.

""ELDER"" has E in position 1, but R is out.

""EXIST"" has E in position 2, X is less common.

""INSET"" seems best - I in 1, N in 2, S in 3, but S must be in 4. Wait no - INSET is I N S E T, so S is in position 3, not 4. That's wrong.

""SNIDE"" has S in position 1, but we need S in position 4.

""STEIN"" has S in position 1, not 4.

""SEINE"" has S in position 1, not 4.

""PISES"" has S in position 4, but P is less common.

""SPIKE"" has S in position 1, not 4.

""DISKS"" has S in position 4, but has D, I, K, S, S. K is less common.

""LISES"" has S in position 4, L in 1, I in 2, S in 3 (but S must be in 4), so this is wrong.

""INSET"" was wrong because S was in position 3.

""INSET"" is I N S E T - S in position 3, not 4. So this is invalid.

Let me re-examine: the word must be _ _ _ S _ with E in positions 1,2, or 3.

Possible patterns:
- E _ _ S _
- _ E _ S _
- _ _ E S _

Letters allowed: any except A, R, O.

Let's try ""EJECT"" - E in 1, J is less common.
""EXILE"" - X is less common.
""ELBOW"" - O is out.
""ELFIN"" - F is less common.
""ENZYM"" - Z is less common.

""DESKS"" has S in position 4 and E in position 2, and no A,R,O. This seems good.

""DESKS"" - D E S K S: S is in position 4 (good), E is in position 2 (good), no A,R,O. This looks valid.

Another option is ""HEXES"" - H E X E S: but X is less common and E is in position 2, S in 4. But this has X which is less common.

""DESKS"" seems best.

But let me check ""DESKS"" - D E S K S: positions 1-5. S is in position 4 (correct), E is in position 2 (which is allowed since E was (-) in position 5 before). This should work.

So my next guess is ""DESKS"".Based on the feedback that S is in the correct 4th position and E is in the word but not in the 5th position, I need a word with S in the 4th spot and E somewhere in the first three positions, while avoiding A, R, and O.

A good candidate is ""DESKS"" - it places S correctly in the 4th position and E in the 2nd position, using only allowed letters.

Let's carefully update what we know after both guesses.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- S is in the word and is in position 4 (✓ at index 4).
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).
- A, R, O are not in the word at all (x).

From Guess 2 (DESKS):
- D and K are not in the word (x).
- E is in the word and is in position 2 (✓ at index 2).
- S appears twice in DESKS: positions 3 and 5 both get (-), meaning those S's are NOT in the word in those positions. But we already know S is in position 4 from Guess 1, so this is consistent (the word only has one S in position 4).

So far we have:
- Pattern: _ E _ S _
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, D, K
- Allowed letters: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus E and S which are already placed).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E in position 2.
2. Has S in position 4.
3. Uses none of the forbidden letters (A, R, O, D, K).
4. Uses only valid English letters.

Possible candidates:
- F E N S E (but E is already in position 2 and can't be in 5)
- L E N S E (same issue)
- M E N S T (but T is allowed)
- L E N S T (but T is allowed)
- B E N S T (B is allowed)
- P E N S T (P is allowed)
- H E N S T (H is allowed)

Looking at these, ""BENTS"" seems valid - B, E, N, T, S. Let's check:
- B: allowed
- E: in position 2 (✓)
- N: allowed
- T: allowed
- S: in position 4 (✓)
- No forbidden letters.

""BENTS"" fits all constraints.Based on the updated constraints, I'll try ""BENTS"".

   - The second S (from CHESS: S(-) at position 5 – present but not in position 5)

4. Remaining possible letters (besides E and S)  
   F, G, I, J, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus H (which must appear somewhere).

5. H must appear in the word (from CHESS: H(-)), but it cannot be in position 3 (since H(-) at position 3).  
   Therefore H must be in position 1 or 5.

6. The word must contain H exactly once (no double-H evidence) and must fit _ E _ S _.

Possible placements for H:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about the letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D.

Looking at these letters, the word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains five of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This will help me quickly identify which of these common letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O and S which are very common. I'll go with AROSE as my first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- S is in the word and in the correct 4th position.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5, so it must be in positions 1,2,3, or 4. But position 4 is already S, so E must be in positions 1,2, or 3).
- A, R, O are not in the word at all.

So the word looks like: _ _ _ S _ and must contain an E somewhere in positions 1,2, or 3.

I need to pick a word that:
1. Has S in position 4.
2. Has E in position 1, 2, or 3.
3. Does not contain A, R, or O.

Good remaining common letters to try are T, I, N, L, C, D, U, M, etc.

Possible candidates:
- STEMS (but has S twice, and M might be less common)
- TESLA (but has A which we know is out)
- LENSE (but has N and E in position 3, but has L and N which are good)
- INSET (but has I and N, and E in position 3)
- CREST (but has R which is out)

Looking at these, ""INSET"" seems good - it has S in position 4, E in position 3, and uses common letters I and N. But let me check if it violates any rules (no A,R,O).

Actually, ""INSET"" has S in position 4 and E in position 3, and no A,R,O. That seems valid.

But let me think of a better one - ""STEPS"" has E in position 3 and S in position 4, but has P which is less common. 

""ENSES"" has E in positions 1,2,3,4 but S is in position 4, but has N which is good. But it has S in position 4 and E in position 3.

Another good option is ""TENSE"" - T in 1, E in 2, N in 3, S in 4, E in 5. But this has E in position 5 which we know is wrong (from AROSE feedback), but in TENSE the E in position 5 is the same as in AROSE, so this would get E(-) again. But we need to avoid that.

Wait, in AROSE, E was in position 5 and got (-), so in our next guess we must not put E in position 5. So TENSE would have E in position 5 again, which is bad.

So E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

Let's try ""LINES"" - L in 1, I in 2, N in 3, E in 4, S in 5. But S must be in position 4, so this is wrong.

""ELDER"" has E in position 1, but R is out.

""EXIST"" has E in position 2, X is less common.

""INSET"" seems best - I in 1, N in 2, S in 3, but S must be in 4. Wait no - INSET is I N S E T, so S is in position 3, not 4. That's wrong.

""SNIDE"" has S in position 1, but we need S in position 4.

""STEIN"" has S in position 1, not 4.

""SEINE"" has S in position 1, not 4.

""PISES"" has S in position 4, but P is less common.

""SPIKE"" has S in position 1, not 4.

""DISKS"" has S in position 4, but has D, I, K, S, S. K is less common.

""LISES"" has S in position 4, L in 1, I in 2, S in 3 (but S must be in 4), so this is wrong.

""INSET"" was wrong because S was in position 3.

""INSET"" is I N S E T - S in position 3, not 4. So this is invalid.

Let me re-examine: the word must be _ _ _ S _ with E in positions 1,2, or 3.

Possible patterns:
- E _ _ S _
- _ E _ S _
- _ _ E S _

Letters allowed: any except A, R, O.

Let's try ""EJECT"" - E in 1, J is less common.
""EXILE"" - X is less common.
""ELBOW"" - O is out.
""ELFIN"" - F is less common.
""ENZYM"" - Z is less common.

""DESKS"" has S in position 4 and E in position 2, and no A,R,O. This seems good.

""DESKS"" - D E S K S: S is in position 4 (good), E is in position 2 (good), no A,R,O. This looks valid.

Another option is ""HEXES"" - H E X E S: but X is less common and E is in position 2, S in 4. But this has X which is less common.

""DESKS"" seems best.

But let me check ""DESKS"" - D E S K S: positions 1-5. S is in position 4 (correct), E is in position 2 (which is allowed since E was (-) in position 5 before). This should work.

So my next guess is ""DESKS"".Based on the feedback that S is in the correct 4th position and E is in the word but not in the 5th position, I need a word with S in the 4th spot and E somewhere in the first three positions, while avoiding A, R, and O.

A good candidate is ""DESKS"" - it places S correctly in the 4th position and E in the 2nd position, using only allowed letters.

Let's carefully update what we know after both guesses.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- S is in the word and is in position 4 (✓ at index 4).
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).
- A, R, O are not in the word at all (x).

From Guess 2 (DESKS):
- D and K are not in the word (x).
- E is in the word and is in position 2 (✓ at index 2).
- S appears twice in DESKS: positions 3 and 5 both get (-), meaning those S's are NOT in the word in those positions. But we already know S is in position 4 from Guess 1, so this is consistent (the word only has one S in position 4).

So far we have:
- Pattern: _ E _ S _
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, D, K
- Allowed letters: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus E and S which are already placed).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E in position 2.
2. Has S in position 4.
3. Uses none of the forbidden letters (A, R, O, D, K).
4. Uses only valid English letters.

Possible candidates:
- F E N S E (but E is already in position 2 and can't be in 5)
- L E N S E (same issue)
- M E N S T (but T is allowed)
- L E N S T (but T is allowed)
- B E N S T (B is allowed)
- P E N S T (P is allowed)
- H E N S T (H is allowed)

Looking at these, ""BENTS"" seems valid - B, E, N, T, S. Let's check:
- B: allowed
- E: in position 2 (✓)
- N: allowed
- T: allowed
- S: in position 4 (✓)
- No forbidden letters.

""BENTS"" fits all constraints.Based on the updated constraints, I'll try ""BENTS"".

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Known facts after three guesses:

1. Position 2 = E (✓)  
2. Position 4 = S (✓)  
3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:  
   A, R, O, D, K, B, N, T  
4. The remaining alphabet letters that are still possible (besides E and S):  
   C, F, G, H, I, J, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

So the pattern is:  
_ E _ S _

We need a valid 5-letter English word that fits this pattern and uses only the still-allowed letters.

Scanning the remaining letters, common consonants left are C, F, G, H, L, M, P, etc.

Candidate words:
- CHESS – but S appears twice (position 4 is already S, and position 5 would be S, which is allowed only if the word has two S’s; no restriction against that). However, we have no feedback against C or H yet.  
- FELLS – but L repeats and we don’t know if double letters are allowed, and F, L are still possible.  
- GEESE – but double E is possible, and G, E are allowed.  
- HESPY – not a valid word.  
- MESSY – M, E, S, S, Y: double S is OK, and all letters are allowed.  
- PESKY – P, E, S, K, Y: but K is already ruled out (x in Guess 2).  
- VESPY – not valid.  
- WESPY – not valid.  
- YESSY – not a real word.  
- LEMES – not a real word.  
- FESMS – not valid.  
- GEMS – too short.  
- HEMS – not valid.  
- LEMS – not valid.  
- PEMS – not valid.  
- QEMS – not valid.  
- VEMS – not valid.  
- XEMS – not valid.  
- ZEMS – not valid.  

The most plausible valid word among these is “CHESS”.  
Let’s check:  
C (allowed), H (allowed), E (position 2 ✓), S (position 4 ✓), S (allowed to appear again).  
No forbidden letters used.

Therefore, “CHESS” is the best next guess.

   - The second S (from CHESS: S(-) at position 5 – present but not in position 5)

4. Remaining possible letters (besides E and S)  
   F, G, I, J, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus H (which must appear somewhere).

5. H must appear in the word (from CHESS: H(-)), but it cannot be in position 3 (since H(-) at position 3).  
   Therefore H must be in position 1 or 5.

6. The word must contain H exactly once (no double-H evidence) and must fit _ E _ S _.

Possible placements for H:
- Position 1: H E _ S _  
- Position 5: _ E _ S H

A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words.

This will help me quickly identify which of these common letters are in the secret word and their positions.\n\nAnother good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O and S which are very common.

Let’s tabulate the new information from Guess 5 (HELMS):

- H(-)   → H is in the word but NOT in position 1  
- E(✓)   → E is confirmed in position 2 (already known)  
- L(-)   → L is in the word but NOT in position 3  
- M(x)   → M is NOT in the word  
- S(-)   → S is in the word but NOT in position 5 (already known, since S is in position 4)

So the only new hard constraint is:
- H must appear somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 1  
- L must appear somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 3  
- M is now also excluded (from M(x))  

Current known pattern: _ E _ S _

Remaining letters that are still allowed (besides E and S):
F, G, I, J, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus H and L (both must appear once).

Since both H and L must appear exactly once and the word is only 5 letters, one of them must occupy position 1 and the other must occupy position 3, in some order.

Possible placements:
1. H in position 3, L in position 1  → L E H S _  
2. L in position 3, H in position 1  → H E L S _  

But H(-) from Guess 5 tells us H is NOT in position 1, so option 2 is impossible.  
Therefore the only possible arrangement is:

L E H S _

We now need a 5-letter word of the form L E H S _ that is valid in English.

The only common English word that fits is “LEHS?” – but none of the letters Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z make a valid word with L E H S.

Wait – let’s list the remaining possible letters for position 5: F, G, I, J, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Scanning the dictionary for “LEHS?” combinations, the only valid word is:

LEHS + Y  → “LEHSY” – not valid  
LEHS + F  → “LEHSF” – not valid  
…none exist.

This suggests our assumption that both H and L must appear is correct, but no such word exists.  
Therefore we must reinterpret the S(-) in Guess 5.

Re-examining Guess 5 feedback:
- S(-) at position 5 means S is in the word but NOT in position 5.  
  Since we already know S is in position 4, this is consistent and does not imply a second S.

Thus, the word contains:
- E in position 2  
- S in position 4  
- H somewhere (but not position 1)  
- L somewhere (but not position 3)  
- No M  

With pattern _ E _ S _, and H and L needing to fit in positions 1 and 3, but H cannot be in 1, the only possibility is:

_ E L S H

That is, position 1 = ?, position 3 = L, position 5 = H.

So the pattern is: ? E L S H

Now we need a letter for position 1 from the remaining allowed set: F, G, I, J, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Valid English word: F E L S H → “FELSH” – not valid  
G E L S H → “GELSH” – not valid  
J E L S H → “JELSH” – not valid  
P E L S H → “PELSH” – not valid  
V E L S H → “VELSH” – not valid  
W E L S H → “WELSH” – valid word!
