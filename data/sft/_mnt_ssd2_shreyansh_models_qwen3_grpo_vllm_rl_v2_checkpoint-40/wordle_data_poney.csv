### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information I can get from the feedback. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll try to include several of these in my first guess.

A popular and effective first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (most common letter)

This gives me a good spread of vowels and consonants that should provide useful feedback for narrowing down future guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S are NOT in the word (x)
- O and E ARE in the word but in the wrong positions (-)

So the secret word contains:
- O and E somewhere, but NOT in positions 3 and 5 respectively
- Does NOT contain A, R, or S

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses O and E in different positions than 3 and 5
2. Avoids A, R, S entirely
3. Uses other common letters not yet tested (like T, N, L, C, D, etc.)

A good candidate is ""TONEY"":
- T (new letter, common)
- O (in position 2 instead of 3)
- N (new letter)
- E (in position 4 instead of 5)
- Y (new letter)

This tests several new letters while incorporating the known O and E in new positions.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information I can get from the feedback. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll try to include several of these in my first guess.

A popular and effective first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (most common letter)

This gives me a good spread of vowels and consonants that should provide useful feedback for narrowing down future guesses.

A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once.\n\nLooking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I\'ll try to include several of these in my first guess.\n\nA popular and effective first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains:\n- A (very common)\n- R (very common)\n- O (very common)\n- S (very common)\n- E (most common letter)\n\nThis gives me a good spread of vowels and consonants that should provide useful feedback for narrowing down future guesses.\n\n<guess>arose</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A, R, S are NOT in the word (x)\n- O and E ARE in the word but in the wrong positions (-)\n\nSo the secret word contains:\n- O and E somewhere, but NOT in positions 3 and 5 respectively\n- Does NOT contain A, R, or S\n\nI need a new 5-letter word that:\n1.

From Guess 5 (coney) we now know:

- C is NOT in the word (x)
- O, N, E, Y are still in their correct positions (✓)

So the pattern is still _ O N E Y, and the first letter must be one we have not yet ruled out.

Letters already ruled out: A, R, S, T, M, H, C

Remaining common first letters: B, D, F, G, L, P, V, W, etc.

Valid 5-letter words ending in “ONEY”:
- BONEY (not common)
- DONEY (not a word)
- FONEY (not a word)
- GONEY (not a word)
- LONEY (rare)
- PONEY (archaic)
- VONEY (not a word)
- WONEY (not a word)

The only remaining valid word is BONEY, but it is not common. However, it is a valid English word (a type of rifle). Since all other options have been ruled out, BONEY is the only possible word left.

Therefore, the secret word must be BONEY.
