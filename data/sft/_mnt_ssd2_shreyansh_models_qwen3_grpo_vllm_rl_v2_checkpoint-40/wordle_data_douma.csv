For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the word, whether they're in the correct position or not. Another strong alternative is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. After considering these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is NOT in the word.
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (not third).
- S is NOT in the word.
- E is NOT in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and O.
- Does NOT contain R, S, or E.
- A is not in position 1, and O is not in position 3.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and O.
2. Avoids R, S, E.
3. Places A somewhere other than position 1.
4. Places O somewhere other than position 3.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Possible structure: Since A and O are present, maybe try a word like ""ADOPT"" (but P and T are allowed). However, let's see:

- A must be in positions 2-5.
- O must be in positions 1,2,4,5 (not 3).

Let me think of words:
- ""ADOPT"" - but O is in position 2, A in position 1 (invalid for A).
- ""COBIA"" - but I don't know if I needs to have A and O together.
- ""TALON"" - has A and O, but O is in position 3 (invalid).
- ""CLOAK"" - has A and O, but O is in position 3 (invalid).
- ""PLANT"" - has A, but no O.
- ""MANGO"" - has A and O, but O is in position 5 (valid), A in position 3 (valid). Also avoids R,S,E.

""MANGO"" seems good:
- Letters: M, A, N, G, O.
- Contains A (position 3) and O (position 5).
- Doesn't contain R, S, E.
- A not in position 1, O not in position 3.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is NOT in the word.
- O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S is NOT in the word.
- E is NOT in the word.

- M is in the word but not in position 1.
- A is in the word but not in position 2.
- N is NOT in the word.
- G is NOT in the word.
- O is in the word but not in position 5.

Summary of constraints so far:
1. Letters known to be in the word: A, O, M.
2. Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, S, E, N, G.
3. Positions:
   - A cannot be in position 1 or 2.
   - O cannot be in position 3 or 5.
   - M cannot be in position 1.

Possible positions for A: 3, 4, 5.
Possible positions for O: 1, 2, 4.
Possible positions for M: 2, 3, 4, 5.

Other letters must be chosen from the remaining unused letters (excluding R,S,E,N,G). Common remaining consonants: T, L, C, D, P, etc. Vowels: I, U (since A and O are already used).

Let’s try to construct a word:
- We need to place A, O, M and two other consonants.
- Let’s try putting O in position 1 (since it’s allowed), A in position 3, and M in position 2:
  O M A _ _
  The remaining two letters must be from the allowed set (T, L, C, D, P, I, U).
  Possible endings: O M A T _ or O M A T I, etc.
  ""OMATI"" is not a valid English word.
  ""OMAHA"" has H (allowed) but is a proper noun.
  ""OMAKA"" – not valid.
  
Alternative: O in position 2, A in position 3 or 4, M in position 2,3,4,5:
Try O in position 2, A in position 4, M in position 5:
_ O _ A M
Possible first letter: T, L, C, D, P, I, U.
""TOCAM"" – not valid.
""POCAL"" – not valid.
""COBAM"" – not valid.

Another approach: A in position 3, O in position 2, M in position 4:
_ O A M _
Possible first and fifth letters: T, L, C, D, P, I, U.
""TOAM_"" – not valid.
""POCAL"" – no.

Let me try A in position 5, O in position 2, M in position 3:
_ O M _ A
Possible first and fourth letters: T, L, C, D, P, I, U.
""TOPLA"" – not valid.
""COMIA"" – not valid.

Try A in position 4, O in position 1, M in position 2:
O M _ A _
Possible third and fifth letters: T, L, C, D, P, I, U.
""OMTAL"" – not valid.
""OMCAB"" – not valid.

Another pattern: A in position 3, O in position 4, M in position 2:
_ M A O _
Possible first and fifth letters: T, L, C, D, P, I, U.
""TM A O"" – not valid.

Wait, let's think differently: We have three required letters (A, O, M) and two more letters to choose from allowed consonants/vowels. Let's list possible 5-letter words containing A, O, M with the given constraints.

Possible words:
- ""CAMPS"" – has S (invalid)
- ""COMAT"" – not valid
- ""COBIA"" – has I, but O is in position 2 (allowed), A in position 4 (allowed), M in position 3 (allowed). Also avoids forbidden letters.
  Check: C O B I A
  - Letters: C, O, B, I, A – all allowed.
  - A is in position 4 (not 1 or 2) – ok.
  - O is in position 2 (not 3 or 5) – ok.
  - M is not in this word – but we know M must be in the word. So this is invalid.

Next: ""COBMA"" – not valid.
""COMAI"" – not valid.
""COMAT"" – not valid.

Try ""TAMPA"" – has P, A, M, T. But O is missing.

We need O, A, M together. Let's try:
""AMO"" + two more letters. But positions are fixed.

Alternative: ""PAOM_"" – not valid.

Let me try ""PLAOM"" – not valid.

Another approach: Since A, O, M must be present, and positions are constrained, let's list possible positions:
Possible positions for A: 3,4,5
Possible positions for O: 1,2,4
Possible positions for M: 2,3,4,5

Let's try:
- A in 3, O in 1, M in 2: O M A _ _
  Need two more letters from allowed: T, L, C, D, P, I, U.
  ""OMATI"" – not valid.
  ""OMAHA"" – proper noun.
  ""OMAKA"" – not valid.

- A in 3, O in 2, M in 4: _ O A M _
  ""TOAM_"" – not valid.
  ""POCAL"" – no.

- A in 4, O in 1, M in 2: O M _ A _
  ""OMTAL"" – not valid.
  ""OMCAB"" – no.

- A in 4, O in 2, M in 5: _ O _ A M
  ""TOCAL"" – no.
  ""POCAL"" – no.

- A in 5, O in 1, M in 2: O M _ _ A
  ""OMTIA"" – not valid.
  ""OMLCA"" – no.

This seems tricky. Maybe try A in 3, O in 4, M in 2:
_ M A O _
""TM A O"" – no.

Let me try ""CLOAM"" – not valid.
""PLAOM"" – no.

Wait, let's think of actual English words:
- ""COMA"" is 4 letters.
- ""AMO"" is 3 letters.
We need 5 letters.

Possible 5-letter words with A, O, M:
- ""CAMPS"" – has S (invalid)
- ""COMAT"" – not valid
- ""COBIA"" – no M
- ""COBMA"" – not valid
- ""COGMA"" – has G (invalid)
- ""CLOAM"" – not valid
- ""PLAOM"" – not valid
- ""TAMPA"" – no O
- ""MOCHA"" – has C, H, A. O is missing.
- ""MOCHA"" – no O.

This seems difficult. Maybe try ""AMO"" + ""T"" + ""L"" as ""AMOLT"" – not valid.

Alternative: ""PAULM"" – no O.

Let me try ""OCTAM"" – has C, T, A, M. O is in position 1 (allowed), A in position 3 (allowed), M in position 5 (allowed). Also avoids forbidden letters (R,S,E,N,G).
""OCTAM"" – is this a valid English word? It's not common.

Another: ""COATM"" – not valid.
""COBAM"" – not valid.

Let me try ""COMAT"" – not valid.

Wait, let's try ""PLATO"" – has P, L, A, T, O. But M is missing.

We must include M. Let's try ""PLAMO"" – not valid.

""ALMOT"" – not valid.

""MOATL"" – not valid.

This is tough. Maybe try ""AMORT"" – has A, M, O, R, T. But R is forbidden.

""AMOUL"" – has U, L. Not valid.

""AMOED"" – has E (invalid).

""AMOUL"" – not valid.

""AMOUL"" – no.

Let me try ""COBIA"" – no M.

""COMAT"" – not valid.

""COMIA"" – not valid.

""COMMA"" – has C, O, M, M, A. This is valid!
Check ""COMMA"":
- Letters: C, O, M, M, A.
- Contains A, O, M – all required.
- A is in position 5 (not 1 or 2) – ok.
- O is in position 2 (not 3 or 5) – ok.

2. Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, S, E, N, G.
3. Positions:
   - A cannot be in position 1 or 2.
   - O cannot be in position 3 or 5.
   - M cannot be in position 1.

Possible positions for A: 3, 4, 5.
Possible positions for O: 1, 2, 4.
Possible positions for M: 2, 3, 4, 5.

Other letters must be chosen from the remaining unused letters (excluding R,S,E,N,G). Common remaining consonants: T, L, C, D, P, etc. Vowels: I, U (since A and O are already used).

Let’s try to construct a word:
- We need to place A, O, M and two other consonants.
- Let’s try putting O in position 1 (since it’s allowed), A in position 3, and M in position 2:
  O M A _ _
  The remaining two letters must be from the allowed set (T, L, C, D, P, I, U).
  Possible endings: O M A T _ or O M A T I, etc.
  ""OMATI"" is not a valid English word.
  ""OMAHA"" has H (allowed) but is a proper noun.
  ""OMAKA"" – not valid.
  
Alternative: O in position 2, A in position 3 or 4, M in position 2,3,4,5:
Try O in position 2, A in position 4, M in position 5:
_ O _ A M
Possible first letter: T, L, C, D, P, I, U.
""TOCAM"" – not valid.
""POCAL"" – not valid.
""COBAM"" – not valid.

Another approach: A in position 3, O in position 2, M in position 4:
_ O A M _
Possible first and fifth letters: T, L, C, D, P, I, U.
""TOAM_"" – not valid.
""POCAL"" – no.

Let me try A in position 5, O in position 2, M in position 3:
_ O M _ A
Possible first and fourth letters: T, L, C, D, P, I, U.
""TOPLA"" – not valid.
""COMIA"" – not valid.

Try A in position 4, O in position 1, M in position 2:
O M _ A _
Possible third and fifth letters: T, L, C, D, P, I, U.
""OMTAL"" – not valid.
""OMCAB"" – not valid.

Another pattern: A in position 3, O in position 4, M in position 2:
_ M A O _
Possible first and fifth letters: T, L, C, D, P, I, U.
""TM A O"" – not valid.

Wait, let's think differently: We have three required letters (A, O, M) and two more letters to choose from allowed consonants/vowels. Let's list possible 5-letter words containing A, O, M with the given constraints.

Possible words:
- ""CAMPS"" – has S (invalid)
- ""COMAT"" – not valid
- ""COBIA"" – has I, but O is in position 2 (allowed), A in position 4 (allowed), M in position 3 (allowed). Also avoids forbidden letters.
  Check: C O B I A
  - Letters: C, O, B, I, A – all allowed.
  - A is in position 4 (not 1 or 2) – ok.
  - O is in position 2 (not 3 or 5) – ok.
  - M is not in this word – but we know M must be in the word. So this is invalid.

Next: ""COBMA"" – not valid.
""COMAI"" – not valid.
""COMAT"" – not valid.

Try ""TAMPA"" – has P, A, M, T. But O is missing.

We need O, A, M together. Let's try:
""AMO"" + two more letters. But positions are fixed.

Alternative: ""PAOM_"" – not valid.

Let me try ""PLAOM"" – not valid.

Another approach: Since A, O, M must be present, and positions are constrained, let's list possible positions:
Possible positions for A: 3,4,5
Possible positions for O: 1,2,4
Possible positions for M: 2,3,4,5

Let's try:
- A in 3, O in 1, M in 2: O M A _ _
  Need two more letters from allowed: T, L, C, D, P, I, U.
  ""OMATI"" – not valid.
  ""OMAHA"" – proper noun.
  ""OMAKA"" – not valid.

- A in 3, O in 2, M in 4: _ O A M _
  ""TOAM_"" – not valid.
  ""POCAL"" – no.

- A in 4, O in 1, M in 2: O M _ A _
  ""OMTAL"" – not valid.
  ""OMCAB"" – no.

- A in 4, O in 2, M in 5: _ O _ A M
  ""TOCAL"" – no.
  ""POCAL"" – no.

- A in 5, O in 1, M in 2: O M _ _ A
  ""OMTIA"" – not valid.
  ""OMLCA"" – no.

This seems tricky. Maybe try A in 3, O in 4, M in 2:
_ M A O _
""TM A O"" – no.

Let me try ""CLOAM"" – not valid.
""PLAOM"" – no.

Wait, let's think of actual English words:
- ""COMA"" is 4 letters.
- ""AMO"" is 3 letters.
We need 5 letters.

Possible 5-letter words with A, O, M:
- ""CAMPS"" – has S (invalid)
- ""COMAT"" – not valid
- ""COBIA"" – no M
- ""COBMA"" – not valid
- ""COGMA"" – has G (invalid)
- ""CLOAM"" – not valid
- ""PLAOM"" – not valid
- ""TAMPA"" – no O
- ""MOCHA"" – has C, H, A. O is missing.
- ""MOCHA"" – no O.

This seems difficult. Maybe try ""AMO"" + ""T"" + ""L"" as ""AMOLT"" – not valid.

Alternative: ""PAULM"" – no O.

Let me try ""OCTAM"" – has C, T, A, M. O is in position 1 (allowed), A in position 3 (allowed), M in position 5 (allowed). Also avoids forbidden letters (R,S,E,N,G).
""OCTAM"" – is this a valid English word? It's not common.

Another: ""COATM"" – not valid.
""COBAM"" – not valid.

Let me try ""COMAT"" – not valid.

Wait, let's try ""PLATO"" – has P, L, A, T, O. But M is missing.

We must include M. Let's try ""PLAMO"" – not valid.

""ALMOT"" – not valid.

""MOATL"" – not valid.

This is tough. Maybe try ""AMORT"" – has A, M, O, R, T. But R is forbidden.

""AMOUL"" – has U, L. Not valid.

""AMOED"" – has E (invalid).

""AMOUL"" – not valid.

""AMOUL"" – no.

Let me try ""COBIA"" – no M.

""COMAT"" – not valid.

""COMIA"" – not valid.

""COMMA"" – has C, O, M, M, A. This is valid!
Check ""COMMA"":
- Letters: C, O, M, M, A.
- Contains A, O, M – all required.
- A is in position 5 (not 1 or 2) – ok.
- O is in position 2 (not 3 or 5) – ok.
- M is in positions 3 and 4 (not 1) – ok.
- Does not contain R, S, E, N, G – ok.

""COMMA"" seems to satisfy all constraints.",Guess 3: COMMA -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(✓) M(-) M(✓) A(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the word, whether they're in the correct position or not. Another strong alternative is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. After considering these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is NOT in the word.
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (not third).
- S is NOT in the word.
- E is NOT in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and O.
- Does NOT contain R, S, or E.
- A is not in position 1, and O is not in position 3.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and O.
2. Avoids R, S, E.
3. Places A somewhere other than position 1.
4. Places O somewhere other than position 3.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Possible structure: Since A and O are present, maybe try a word like ""ADOPT"" (but P and T are allowed). However, let's see:

- A must be in positions 2-5.
- O must be in positions 1,2,4,5 (not 3).

Let me think of words:
- ""ADOPT"" - but O is in position 2, A in position 1 (invalid for A).
- ""COBIA"" - but I don't know if I needs to have A and O together.
- ""TALON"" - has A and O, but O is in position 3 (invalid).
- ""CLOAK"" - has A and O, but O is in position 3 (invalid).
- ""PLANT"" - has A, but no O.
- ""MANGO"" - has A and O, but O is in position 5 (valid), A in position 3 (valid). Also avoids R,S,E.

""MANGO"" seems good:
- Letters: M, A, N, G, O.
- Contains A (position 3) and O (position 5).
- Doesn't contain R, S, E.
- A not in position 1, O not in position 3.

This seems like a strong second guess.

From the new feedback on COMMA:
- C is NOT in the word.
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- M is in the word but in the wrong position (positions 1 and 3 are wrong, so M must be in 4 or 5).
- M(✓) at position 4 means the fourth letter is M.
- A(✓) at position 5 means the fifth letter is A.

So the secret word has the pattern:
- Position 1: unknown, but cannot be C, R, S, E, N, G.
- Position 2: O (fixed).
- Position 3: unknown, but cannot be M (from COMMA feedback), and cannot be R, S, E, N, G.
- Position 4: M (fixed).
- Position 5: A (fixed).

Thus the word is of the form: _ O _ M A.

Letters we know must appear: O, M, A (already placed).  
Letters we know do NOT appear: C, R, S, E, N, G.

Possible remaining consonants for positions 1 and 3: B, D, F, H, I, K, L, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

We need to fill positions 1 and 3 with letters from that set, forming a valid English word ending in ""OMA"".

Common 5-letter words ending in ""OMA"":
- ""HOMMA"" – not valid.
- ""BOMMA"" – not valid.
- ""DOMMA"" – not valid.
- ""LOMAA"" – not valid.
- ""POOMA"" – not valid.
- ""TOOMA"" – not valid.
- ""VOGMA"" – has G (invalid).
- ""BOOMA"" – has B, O, O, M, A. But O is already in position 2, and we don't know if there's another O. Also, B is allowed.

Wait, let's think systematically:
The pattern is _ O _ M A.

Possible position 1 letters: B, D, F, H, I, K, L, P, T, U, V, W, Y.
Possible position 3 letters: same set, but cannot be M (already in 4).

Let's try:
- B: B O _ M A → ""BOOMA"" (but has two O's; we don't know if O repeats).
- D: D O _ M A → ""DOOMA"" – not valid.
- F: F O _ M A → ""FOOMA"" – not valid.
- H: H O _ M A → ""HOOMA"" – not valid.
- I: I O _ M A → ""IOMA"" – too short.
- K: K O _ M A → ""KOMMA"" – not valid.
- L: L O _ M A → ""LOOMA"" – has L, O, O, M, A. Two O's possible, but let's see.
- P: P O _ M A → ""POOMA"" – not valid.
- T: T O _ M A → ""TOOMA"" – not valid.

- V: V O _ M A → ""VOMMA"" – not valid.
- W: W O _ M A → ""WOMMA"" – not valid.
- Y: Y O _ M A → ""YOMMA"" – not valid.

Hmm, none of these seem to be valid English words. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think of other words ending in ""OMA"".

Another approach: Maybe the word is ""LOMAA"" – but that's not valid.

Wait, let's try ""BOOMA"" – even though it has two O's, maybe that's possible. But ""BOOMA"" is not a standard word.

Actually, let me think of ""VOGMA"" – but G is invalid.

Another possibility: ""FOOMA"" – not valid.

This suggests I might need to reconsider. Maybe the word is ""LOOMA"" – but again, not valid.

Wait, let me think of ""HOMMA"" – not valid.

This seems problematic. Maybe I need to try a different letter for position 1 or 3.

Let me try ""F"" for position 1 and ""I"" for position 3: F O I M A – ""FOIMA"" – not valid.

""F"" and ""K"": F O K M A – ""FOKMA"" – not valid.

""F"" and ""L"": F O L M A – ""FOLMA"" – not valid.

""F"" and ""T"": F O T M A – ""FOTMA"" – not valid.

""F"" and ""U"": F O U M A – ""FOUMA"" – not valid.

""F"" and ""V"": F O V M A – ""FOVMA"" – not valid.

""F"" and ""W"": F O W M A – ""FOWMA"" – not valid.

""F"" and ""Y"": F O Y M A – ""FOYMA"" – not valid.

This seems impossible. Maybe I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, let me re-examine the feedback on COMMA:
- O(✓) at position 2: correct.
- M(-) at position 1: M is in the word but not at position 1.
- M(✓) at position 4: correct.
- A(✓) at position 5: correct.
- C(x): C not in word.

So the word is _ O _ M A, with M not at position 1 (already at 4) and A at 5.

Letters not in word: C, R, S, E, N, G.

Possible letters for position 1: any except C, R, S, E, N, G, and not M (since M is at 4).
Possible letters: B, D, F, H, I, K, L, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

Possible letters for position 3: same set, but also not O (since O is at 2), and not M (at 4).

Let me try ""B"" at 1 and ""I"" at 3: B O I M A – ""BOIMA"" – not valid.

""B"" and ""U"": B O U M A – ""BOUMA"" – not valid.

""W"" and ""I"": W O I M A – ""WOIMA"" – not valid.

""Y"" and ""I"": Y O I M A – ""YOIMA"" – not valid.

This seems impossible. Maybe I need to consider that the word might have another O somewhere, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, let me try ""B"" and ""O"" for position 3: but O is already at 2.

Actually, position 3 can be any letter except the forbidden ones. Let me try ""B"" and ""O"" – but O is already used.

I think the only possible word here is ""BOOMA"", even though it has two O's. Let me check if that's valid – no, ""BOOMA"" is not a standard word.

This suggests I might have made an error in earlier steps. Let me re-examine the feedback.

Wait, the feedback on COMMA was:
C(x) O(✓) M(-) M(✓) A(✓)

This means:
- O is correct at position 2.
- M is in the word but not at position 1 (so it must be at 3,4, or 5).
- M(✓) at position 4 means M is correct at 4.
- A(✓) at position 5 means A is correct at 5.

Thus the word is _ O _ M A, with M at 4 and A at 5.

Letters not in word: C, R, S, E, N, G.

Possible letters for position 1: B, D, F, H, I, K, L, P, T, U, V, W, Y.
Possible letters for position 3: same set, but also not O (since O is at 2), and not M (at 4).

Let me try ""B"" and ""I"": B O I M A – ""BOIMA"" – not valid.

""B"" and ""L"": B O L M A – ""BOLMA"" – not valid.

""B"" and ""K"": B O K M A – ""BOKMA"" – not valid.

""D"" and ""I"": D O I M A – ""DOI MA"" – not valid.

""D"" and ""L"": D O L M A – ""DOLMA"" – this is actually a valid word (a type of stuffed grape leaf).

Let me check ""DOLMA"":
- D: allowed (not in forbidden list).
- O: correct at 2.
- L: allowed.
- M: correct at 4.
- A: correct at 5.
- No C, R, S, E, N, G.
- M is not at 1 (ok, it's at 4).
- A is at 5 (correct).
- O is at 2 (correct).

This seems to fit all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the word, whether they're in the correct position or not. Another strong alternative is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. After considering these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is NOT in the word.
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (not third).
- S is NOT in the word.
- E is NOT in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and O.
- Does NOT contain R, S, or E.
- A is not in position 1, and O is not in position 3.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and O.
2. Avoids R, S, E.
3. Places A somewhere other than position 1.
4. Places O somewhere other than position 3.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Possible structure: Since A and O are present, maybe try a word like ""ADOPT"" (but P and T are allowed). However, let's see:

- A must be in positions 2-5.
- O must be in positions 1,2,4,5 (not 3).

Let me think of words:
- ""ADOPT"" - but O is in position 2, A in position 1 (invalid for A).
- ""COBIA"" - but I don't know if I needs to have A and O together.
- ""TALON"" - has A and O, but O is in position 3 (invalid).
- ""CLOAK"" - has A and O, but O is in position 3 (invalid).
- ""PLANT"" - has A, but no O.
- ""MANGO"" - has A and O, but O is in position 5 (valid), A in position 3 (valid). Also avoids R,S,E.

""MANGO"" seems good:
- Letters: M, A, N, G, O.
- Contains A (position 3) and O (position 5).
- Doesn't contain R, S, E.
- A not in position 1, O not in position 3.

This seems like a strong second guess.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):

- R is NOT in the word.
- O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S is NOT in the word.
- E is NOT in the word.

- M is in the word but not in position 1.
- A is in the word but not in position 2.
- N is NOT in the word.
- G is NOT in the word.
- O is in the word but not in position 5.

Summary of constraints so far:
1. Letters known to be in the word: A, O, M.
2. Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, S, E, N, G.
3. Positions:
   - A cannot be in position 1 or 2.
   - O cannot be in position 3 or 5.
   - M cannot be in position 1.

Possible positions for A: 3, 4, 5.
Possible positions for O: 1, 2, 4.
Possible positions for M: 2, 3, 4, 5.

Other letters must be chosen from the remaining unused letters (excluding R,S,E,N,G). Common remaining consonants: T, L, C, D, P, etc. Vowels: I, U (since A and O are already used).

Let’s try to construct a word:
- We need to place A, O, M and two other consonants.
- Let’s try putting O in position 1 (since it’s allowed), A in position 3, and M in position 2:
  O M A _ _
  The remaining two letters must be from the allowed set (T, L, C, D, P, I, U).
  Possible endings: O M A T _ or O M A T I, etc.
  ""OMATI"" is not a valid English word.
  ""OMAHA"" has H (allowed) but is a proper noun.
  ""OMAKA"" – not valid.
  
Alternative: O in position 2, A in position 3 or 4, M in position 2,3,4,5:
Try O in position 2, A in position 4, M in position 5:
_ O _ A M
Possible first letter: T, L, C, D, P, I, U.
""TOCAM"" – not valid.
""POCAL"" – not valid.
""COBAM"" – not valid.

Another approach: A in position 3, O in position 2, M in position 4:
_ O A M _
Possible first and fifth letters: T, L, C, D, P, I, U.
""TOAM_"" – not valid.
""POCAL"" – no.

Let me try A in position 5, O in position 2, M in position 3:
_ O M _ A
Possible first and fourth letters: T, L, C, D, P, I, U.
""TOPLA"" – not valid.
""COMIA"" – not valid.

Try A in position 4, O in position 1, M in position 2:
O M _ A _
Possible third and fifth letters: T, L, C, D, P, I, U.
""OMTAL"" – not valid.
""OMCAB"" – not valid.

Another pattern: A in position 3, O in position 4, M in position 2:
_ M A O _
Possible first and fifth letters: T, L, C, D, P, I, U.
""TM A O"" – not valid.

Wait, let's think differently: We have three required letters (A, O, M) and two more letters to choose from allowed consonants/vowels. Let's list possible 5-letter words containing A, O, M with the given constraints.

Possible words:
- ""CAMPS"" – has S (invalid)
- ""COMAT"" – not valid
- ""COBIA"" – has I, but O is in position 2 (allowed), A in position 4 (allowed), M in position 3 (allowed). Also avoids forbidden letters.
  Check: C O B I A
  - Letters: C, O, B, I, A – all allowed.
  - A is in position 4 (not 1 or 2) – ok.
  - O is in position 2 (not 3 or 5) – ok.
  - M is not in this word – but we know M must be in the word. So this is invalid.

Next: ""COBMA"" – not valid.
""COMAI"" – not valid.
""COMAT"" – not valid.

Try ""TAMPA"" – has P, A, M, T. But O is missing.

We need O, A, M together. Let's try:
""AMO"" + two more letters. But positions are fixed.

Alternative: ""PAOM_"" – not valid.

Let me try ""PLAOM"" – not valid.

Another approach: Since A, O, M must be present, and positions are constrained, let's list possible positions:
Possible positions for A: 3,4,5
Possible positions for O: 1,2,4
Possible positions for M: 2,3,4,5

Let's try:
- A in 3, O in 1, M in 2: O M A _ _
  Need two more letters from allowed: T, L, C, D, P, I, U.
  ""OMATI"" – not valid.
  ""OMAHA"" – proper noun.
  ""OMAKA"" – not valid.

- A in 3, O in 2, M in 4: _ O A M _
  ""TOAM_"" – not valid.
  ""POCAL"" – no.

- A in 4, O in 1, M in 2: O M _ A _
  ""OMTAL"" – not valid.
  ""OMCAB"" – no.

- A in 4, O in 2, M in 5: _ O _ A M
  ""TOCAL"" – no.
  ""POCAL"" – no.

- A in 5, O in 1, M in 2: O M _ _ A
  ""OMTIA"" – not valid.
  ""OMLCA"" – no.

This seems tricky. Maybe try A in 3, O in 4, M in 2:
_ M A O _
""TM A O"" – no.

Let me try ""CLOAM"" – not valid.
""PLAOM"" – no.

Wait, let's think of actual English words:
- ""COMA"" is 4 letters.
- ""AMO"" is 3 letters.
We need 5 letters.

Possible 5-letter words with A, O, M:
- ""CAMPS"" – has S (invalid)
- ""COMAT"" – not valid
- ""COBIA"" – no M
- ""COBMA"" – not valid
- ""COGMA"" – has G (invalid)
- ""CLOAM"" – not valid
- ""PLAOM"" – not valid
- ""TAMPA"" – no O
- ""MOCHA"" – has C, H, A. O is missing.
- ""MOCHA"" – no O.

This seems difficult. Maybe try ""AMO"" + ""T"" + ""L"" as ""AMOLT"" – not valid.

Alternative: ""PAULM"" – no O.

Let me try ""OCTAM"" – has C, T, A, M. O is in position 1 (allowed), A in position 3 (allowed), M in position 5 (allowed). Also avoids forbidden letters (R,S,E,N,G).
""OCTAM"" – is this a valid English word? It's not common.

Another: ""COATM"" – not valid.
""COBAM"" – not valid.

Let me try ""COMAT"" – not valid.

Wait, let's try ""PLATO"" – has P, L, A, T, O. But M is missing.

We must include M. Let's try ""PLAMO"" – not valid.

""ALMOT"" – not valid.

""MOATL"" – not valid.

This is tough. Maybe try ""AMORT"" – has A, M, O, R, T. But R is forbidden.

""AMOUL"" – has U, L. Not valid.

""AMOED"" – has E (invalid).

""AMOUL"" – not valid.

""AMOUL"" – no.

Let me try ""COBIA"" – no M.

""COMAT"" – not valid.

""COMIA"" – not valid.

""COMMA"" – has C, O, M, M, A. This is valid!
Check ""COMMA"":
- Letters: C, O, M, M, A.
- Contains A, O, M – all required.
- A is in position 5 (not 1 or 2) – ok.
- O is in position 2 (not 3 or 5) – ok.
- M is in positions 3 and 4 (not 1) – ok.
- Does not contain R, S, E, N, G – ok.

""COMMA"" seems to satisfy all constraints.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: MANGO -> FEEDBACK: M(-) A(-) N(x) G(x) O(-)
Guess 3: COMMA -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(✓) M(-) M(✓) A(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on COMMA:
- C is NOT in the word.
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- M is in the word but in the wrong position (positions 1 and 3 are wrong, so M must be in 4 or 5).
- M(✓) at position 4 means the fourth letter is M.
- A(✓) at position 5 means the fifth letter is A.

So the secret word has the pattern:
- Position 1: unknown, but cannot be C, R, S, E, N, G.
- Position 2: O (fixed).
- Position 3: unknown, but cannot be M (from COMMA feedback), and cannot be R, S, E, N, G.
- Position 4: M (fixed).
- Position 5: A (fixed).

Thus the word is of the form: _ O _ M A.

Letters we know must appear: O, M, A (already placed).  
Letters we know do NOT appear: C, R, S, E, N, G.

Possible remaining consonants for positions 1 and 3: B, D, F, H, I, K, L, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

We need to fill positions 1 and 3 with letters from that set, forming a valid English word ending in ""OMA"".

Common 5-letter words ending in ""OMA"":
- ""HOMMA"" – not valid.
- ""BOMMA"" – not valid.
- ""DOMMA"" – not valid.
- ""LOMAA"" – not valid.
- ""POOMA"" – not valid.
- ""TOOMA"" – not valid.
- ""VOGMA"" – has G (invalid).
- ""BOOMA"" – has B, O, O, M, A. But O is already in position 2, and we don't know if there's another O. Also, B is allowed.

Wait, let's think systematically:
The pattern is _ O _ M A.

Possible position 1 letters: B, D, F, H, I, K, L, P, T, U, V, W, Y.
Possible position 3 letters: same set, but cannot be M (already in 4).

Let's try:
- B: B O _ M A → ""BOOMA"" (but has two O's; we don't know if O repeats).
- D: D O _ M A → ""DOOMA"" – not valid.
- F: F O _ M A → ""FOOMA"" – not valid.
- H: H O _ M A → ""HOOMA"" – not valid.
- I: I O _ M A → ""IOMA"" – too short.
- K: K O _ M A → ""KOMMA"" – not valid.
- L: L O _ M A → ""LOOMA"" – has L, O, O, M, A. Two O's possible, but let's see.
- P: P O _ M A → ""POOMA"" – not valid.
- T: T O _ M A → ""TOOMA"" – not valid.
- U: U O _ M A → ""UOMMA"" – not valid.
- V: V O _ M A → ""VOMMA"" – not valid.
- W: W O _ M A → ""WOMMA"" – not valid.
- Y: Y O _ M A → ""YOMMA"" – not valid.

Hmm, none of these seem to be valid English words. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think of other words ending in ""OMA"".

Another approach: Maybe the word is ""LOMAA"" – but that's not valid.

Wait, let's try ""BOOMA"" – even though it has two O's, maybe that's possible. But ""BOOMA"" is not a standard word.

Actually, let me think of ""VOGMA"" – but G is invalid.

Another possibility: ""FOOMA"" – not valid.

This suggests I might need to reconsider. Maybe the word is ""LOOMA"" – but again, not valid.

Wait, let me think of ""HOMMA"" – not valid.

This seems problematic. Maybe I need to try a different letter for position 1 or 3.

Let me try ""F"" for position 1 and ""I"" for position 3: F O I M A – ""FOIMA"" – not valid.

""F"" and ""K"": F O K M A – ""FOKMA"" – not valid.

""F"" and ""L"": F O L M A – ""FOLMA"" – not valid.

""F"" and ""T"": F O T M A – ""FOTMA"" – not valid.

""F"" and ""U"": F O U M A – ""FOUMA"" – not valid.

""F"" and ""V"": F O V M A – ""FOVMA"" – not valid.

""F"" and ""W"": F O W M A – ""FOWMA"" – not valid.

""F"" and ""Y"": F O Y M A – ""FOYMA"" – not valid.

This seems impossible. Maybe I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, let me re-examine the feedback on COMMA:
- O(✓) at position 2: correct.
- M(-) at position 1: M is in the word but not at position 1.
- M(✓) at position 4: correct.
- A(✓) at position 5: correct.
- C(x): C not in word.

So the word is _ O _ M A, with M not at position 1 (already at 4) and A at 5.

Letters not in word: C, R, S, E, N, G.

Possible letters for position 1: any except C, R, S, E, N, G, and not M (since M is at 4).
Possible letters: B, D, F, H, I, K, L, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

Possible letters for position 3: same set, but also not O (since O is at 2), and not M (at 4).

Let me try ""B"" at 1 and ""I"" at 3: B O I M A – ""BOIMA"" – not valid.

""B"" and ""U"": B O U M A – ""BOUMA"" – not valid.

""B"" and ""K"": B O K M A – ""BOKMA"" – not valid.

""D"" and ""I"": D O I M A – ""DOI MA"" – not valid.

""D"" and ""U"": D O U M A – ""DOUMA"" – not valid.

""F"" and ""I"": F O I M A – ""FOIMA"" – not valid.

""H"" and ""I"": H O I M A – ""HOIMA"" – not valid.

""I"" and ""O"": but O is at 2.

""K"" and ""I"": K O I M A – ""KOIMA"" – not valid.

""L"" and ""I"": L O I M A – ""LOIMA"" – not valid.

""P"" and ""I"": P O I M A – ""POIMA"" – not valid.

""T"" and ""I"": T O I M A – ""TOIMA"" – not valid.

""U"" and ""O"": not possible.

""V"" and ""I"": V O I M A – ""VOIMA"" – not valid.

""W"" and ""I"": W O I M A – ""WOIMA"" – not valid.

""Y"" and ""I"": Y O I M A – ""YOIMA"" – not valid.

This seems impossible. Maybe I need to consider that the word might have another O somewhere, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, let me try ""B"" and ""O"" for position 3: but O is already at 2.

Actually, position 3 can be any letter except the forbidden ones. Let me try ""B"" and ""O"" – but O is already used.

I think the only possible word here is ""BOOMA"", even though it has two O's. Let me check if that's valid – no, ""BOOMA"" is not a standard word.

This suggests I might have made an error in earlier steps. Let me re-examine the feedback.

Wait, the feedback on COMMA was:
C(x) O(✓) M(-) M(✓) A(✓)

This means:
- O is correct at position 2.
- M is in the word but not at position 1 (so it must be at 3,4, or 5).
- M(✓) at position 4 means M is correct at 4.
- A(✓) at position 5 means A is correct at 5.

Thus the word is _ O _ M A, with M at 4 and A at 5.

Letters not in word: C, R, S, E, N, G.

Possible letters for position 1: B, D, F, H, I, K, L, P, T, U, V, W, Y.
Possible letters for position 3: same set, but also not O (since O is at 2), and not M (at 4).

Let me try ""B"" and ""I"": B O I M A – ""BOIMA"" – not valid.

""B"" and ""L"": B O L M A – ""BOLMA"" – not valid.

""B"" and ""K"": B O K M A – ""BOKMA"" – not valid.

""D"" and ""I"": D O I M A – ""DOI MA"" – not valid.

""D"" and ""L"": D O L M A – ""DOLMA"" – this is actually a valid word (a type of stuffed grape leaf).

Let me check ""DOLMA"":
- D: allowed (not in forbidden list).
- O: correct at 2.
- L: allowed.
- M: correct at 4.
- A: correct at 5.
- No C, R, S, E, N, G.
- M is not at 1 (ok, it's at 4).
- A is at 5 (correct).
- O is at 2 (correct).

This seems to fit all constraints.Based on the feedback, the word must be _ O _ M A with O in position 2, M in position 4, and A in position 5. After checking possible combinations, ""DOLMA"" fits all constraints.

From the feedback on DOLMA:
- D is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- L is NOT in the word.
- M is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So the word has the fixed pattern:
D O _ M A

Looking for common 5-letter English words that fit D O _ M A:

- D O B M A – not valid

- D O H M A – not valid
- D O I M A – not valid
- D O K M A – not valid

- D O T M A – “DOTMA” – not valid
- D O U M A – “DOUMA” – not valid
- D O V M A – not valid
- D O W M A – not valid
- D O Y M A – not valid

The only valid English word that fits D O _ M A is “DOUMA” (a variant spelling of “Duma” or a place name), but it’s not in most standard word lists. However, “DOUMA” is recognized in some dictionaries.

Given the constraints, “DOUMA” is the only possible word left. Let’s verify:
- D: ✓ at 1
- O: ✓ at 2
- U: allowed (not ruled out)
- M: ✓ at 4
- A: ✓ at 5

Since no other common word fits, we’ll guess “DOUMA”.
