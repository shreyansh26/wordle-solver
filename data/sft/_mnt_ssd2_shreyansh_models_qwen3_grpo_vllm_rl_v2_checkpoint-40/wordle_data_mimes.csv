For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A popular and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 5 unique letters (no duplicates)
- High frequency letters (A, R, O, S, E)
- Good mix of vowels and consonants
- Has been statistically shown to be effective in Wordle-type games

Other good alternatives could be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems like a strong first choice.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E (but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively).
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.

- Letters to include: S, E
- Letters to exclude: A, R, O
- S is not in position 4 (it was in position 4 in AROSE and got ""-"")
- E is not in position 5 (it was in position 5 in AROSE and got ""-"")

Next guess should:
1. Include S and E in different positions.
2. Avoid A, R, O.
3. Introduce new common letters to test.

Good candidates: STILE, SLICE, SHINE, SPEND, STONE, SLIDE.

""STILE"" seems good:
- S is in position 1 (was position 4 before, so new position)

Let's consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (from both guesses):
A, R, O, T, L  (five letters ruled out)

Letters that ARE in the word (from both guesses):
S and E  (both marked “-” twice, so they’re definitely present)

Positions we have ruled out for each of those two letters:

S:
- position 4 (from AROSE)
- position 1 (from STILE)

E:
- position 5 (from AROSE)
- position 4 (from STILE)

Therefore:
- S must be in position 2, 3, or 5
- E must be in position 1, 2, or 3

We still need to test several common consonants and vowels that haven’t been tried yet: N, D, C, M, P, U, I, Y, etc.

A good next word should:
1. Place S and E in still-allowed positions.
2. Use only untested letters.
3. Be a common, valid 5-letter word.

Candidate words that fit:
- SPEND  (but P and N are untested, D is new)
- SNECY  (not a valid word)
- SPICE  (but C and I are untested, P and new)
- SMILE  (but L is already ruled out)
- SCENT  (but T is ruled out)

“SPEND” looks good: it has S and E in new positions (S-2, E-4), and uses P, N, D which are all fresh letters.

Still-untested common letters: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both S and E in still-allowed positions.
2. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.
3. Is a valid English word.

Candidate words that satisfy these constraints:
- SHINE  (S-2, E-3; uses H, I, N) – but N is already ruled out.
- SMILE  – L and N are ruled out.
- SWEET  – T is ruled out.
- SIEVE  – I, V, E; E is in position 3 (allowed), S in position 1 (disallowed – S cannot be 1).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A popular and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 5 unique letters (no duplicates)
- High frequency letters (A, R, O, S, E)
- Good mix of vowels and consonants
- Has been statistically shown to be effective in Wordle-type games

Other good alternatives could be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems like a strong first choice.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E (but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively).
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.

We now know:
- Letters to include: S, E
- Letters to exclude: A, R, O
- S is not in position 4 (it was in position 4 in AROSE and got ""-"")
- E is not in position 5 (it was in position 5 in AROSE and got ""-"")

Next guess should:
1. Include S and E in different positions.
2. Avoid A, R, O.
3. Introduce new common letters to test.

Good candidates: STILE, SLICE, SHINE, SPEND, STONE, SLIDE.

""STILE"" seems good:
- S is in position 1 (was position 4 before, so new position)
- E is in position 4 (was position 5 before, so new position)
- Uses new letters T, I, L which are common and haven't been tested.

Let's consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (from both guesses):
A, R, O, T, L  (five letters ruled out)

Letters that ARE in the word (from both guesses):
S and E  (both marked “-” twice, so they’re definitely present)

Positions we have ruled out for each of those two letters:

S:
- position 4 (from AROSE)
- position 1 (from STILE)

E:
- position 5 (from AROSE)
- position 4 (from STILE)

Therefore:
- S must be in position 2, 3, or 5
- E must be in position 1, 2, or 3

We still need to test several common consonants and vowels that haven’t been tried yet: N, D, C, M, P, U, I, Y, etc.

A good next word should:
1. Place S and E in still-allowed positions.
2. Use only untested letters.
3. Be a common, valid 5-letter word.

Candidate words that fit:
- SPEND  (but P and N are untested, D is new)
- SNECY  (not a valid word)
- SPICE  (but C and I are untested, P and new)
- SMILE  (but L is already ruled out)
- SCENT  (but T is ruled out)

“SPEND” looks good: it has S and E in new positions (S-2, E-4), and uses P, N, D which are all fresh letters.

- Contains S and E (but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively).
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.

We now know:
- Letters to include: S, E
- Letters to exclude: A, R, O
- S is not in position 4 (it was in position 4 in AROSE and got ""-"")
- E is not in position 5 (it was in position 5 in AROSE and got ""-"")

Next guess should:
1. Include S and E in different positions.
2. Avoid A, R, O.
3. Introduce new common letters to test.

Good candidates: STILE, SLICE, SHINE, SPEND, STONE, SLIDE.

""STILE"" seems good:
- S is in position 1 (was position 4 before, so new position)
- E is in position 4 (was position 5 before, so new position)
- Uses new letters T, I, L which are common and haven't been tested.

Let's consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (from both guesses):
A, R, O, T, L  (five letters ruled out)

Letters that ARE in the word (from both guesses):
S and E  (both marked “-” twice, so they’re definitely present)

Positions we have ruled out for each of those two letters:

S:
- position 4 (from AROSE)
- position 1 (from STILE)

E:
- position 5 (from AROSE)
- position 4 (from STILE)

Therefore:
- S must be in position 2, 3, or 5
- E must be in position 1, 2, or 3

We still need to test several common consonants and vowels that haven’t been tried yet: N, D, C, M, P, U, I, Y, etc.

A good next word should:
1. Place S and E in still-allowed positions.
2. Use only untested letters.
3. Be a common, valid 5-letter word.

Candidate words that fit:
- SPEND  (but P and N are untested, D is new)
- SNECY  (not a valid word)
- SPICE  (but C and I are untested, P and new)
- SMILE  (but L is already ruled out)
- SCENT  (but T is ruled out)

“SPEND” looks good: it has S and E in new positions (S-2, E-4), and uses P, N, D which are all fresh letters.

Let’s summarize what we now know after three guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x-feedback):
A, R, O, T, L, P, N, D

Letters that ARE in the word (--feedback):
S and E (both have been marked “-” at least twice, so they are definitely present)

Positions ruled out so far:
- S: positions 1, 4 (from STILE and SPEND) → must be in 2, 3, or 5
- E: positions 4, 5 (from STILE and SPEND) → must be in 1, 2, or 3

Still-untested common letters: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both S and E in still-allowed positions.
2. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.
3. Is a valid English word.

Candidate words that satisfy these constraints:
- SHINE  (S-2, E-3; uses H, I, N) – but N is already ruled out.
- SMILE  – L and N are ruled out.
- SWEET  – T is ruled out.
- SIEVE  – I, V, E; E is in position 3 (allowed), S in position 1 (disallowed – S cannot be 1).  
- SENSE  – S in 1 and 5 (both disallowed for S).
- SCENT  – T and N ruled out.
- SWISE  – not a valid word.
- SHELF  – L and F; L is ruled out.
- SHIES  – S in 5 (allowed), E in 3 (allowed); uses H, I, Y (all untested).  Valid word.

“SHIES” fits perfectly:
- S is in position 5 (still allowed).
- E is in position 3 (still allowed).
- Letters H, I, Y have never been tested and are not ruled out.

From the latest feedback on SHIES:

- S(-)  → S is in the word but not in position 1.  
- H(x) → H is NOT in the word.  
- I(-) → I is in the word but not in position 3.  
- E(✓) → E is in the word AND in position 4.  
- S(✓) → S is in the word AND in position 5.

So we now know:
1. The word ends in …ES (positions 4 and 5 are E and S).
2. Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, L, P, N, D, H.
3. Letters definitely IN the word: E (position 4), S (position 5), I (somewhere else).
4. I cannot be in position 3, so it must be in position 1 or 2.
5. Still-untested common letters: B, C, F, G, K, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has E in position 4 and S in position 5 (…ES).
- Has I in position 1 or 2.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Candidate words:
- I…ES:  impossible (only 5 letters).
- _I…ES:  the blank must be a single letter that is not yet ruled out and not used elsewhere.
Possible consonants for position 2: B, C, F, G, K, M, U, V, W, Y.

Scanning the dictionary for common 5-letter words ending in “IES” with I in position 1:
- “VICES” – V, I, C, E, S.  All letters are still allowed (V, I, C, E, S).  No conflicts.

“VICES” satisfies every constraint.

None of the obvious ones work. Let me think differently: maybe position 3 is a vowel we haven’t ruled out? But we’ve ruled out A, O, E (E is fixed in 4), I (already in 2), U (not tested but not ruled out). 

Wait, we have not tested U for position 3.

So: _ I U E S – the only common word is “QUIES” but Q hasn’t been tested and isn’t ruled out.

Let me check: Q, U, I, E, S – all letters are still allowed (Q, U, I, E, S have not been ruled out).
