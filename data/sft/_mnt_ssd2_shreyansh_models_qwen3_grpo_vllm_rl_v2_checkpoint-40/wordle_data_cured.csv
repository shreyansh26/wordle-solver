### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet's most common letters.

Let me think about why this is a good choice:
1. Covers 5 distinct letters, maximizing information gain
2. Contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
3. Contains two high-frequency consonants (R, S)
4. Is a valid 5-letter English word

This should give us good feedback on multiple common letters right away.

   - Present letters: R (now known to be in position 3), E
   - E not in position 2
   - C is present but not in position 4

So far we know:
- Word has R in position 3
- Word has E somewhere (positions 1, 3, 4 possible, but 3 is already R)
- Word contains C somewhere (positions 1, 2, 5 possible, not 4)
- Letters definitely absent: A, O, S, P, H

Remaining candidate letters: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word with:
- R in position 3
- E in position 1, 4, or 5
- C in position 1, 2, or 5
- No A, O, S, P, H

Let's try to form such a word. One approach is to use common consonants and vowels not yet eliminated.

Possible structure: _ _ R _ _
With C and E to place.

Try ""CRATE"" – but A is absent, so invalid.
Try ""CREPT"" – P is absent, so invalid.
Try ""CRUEL"" – L is allowed, but let's check: C, R, U, E, L. No forbidden letters. R is in 3, E in 4, C in 1. This fits all constraints.

""CRUEL"" seems valid:
- C in 1 (allowed)
- R in 3 (matches ✓)
- U (not yet eliminated)
- E in 4 (allowed)
- L (not yet eliminated)

No forbidden letters (A, O, S, P, H) are present.

Let’s carefully update what we now know after the three guesses.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S
   - Letters IN the word: R, E
   - R is NOT in position 2
   - E is NOT in position 5

2. PERCH → P(x) E(-) R(✓) C(-) H(x)
   - Letters NOT in the word: P, H (added to A, O, S)
   - Letters IN the word: R, E, C
   - R is now confirmed to be in position 3
   - E is NOT in position 2
   - C is NOT in position 4

3. CRUEL → C(✓) R(-) U(-) E(✓) L(x)
   - C is in position 1 (✓)
   - R is NOT in position 2 (already known), but here it shows “-” for position 2, which is consistent
   - U is in the word but NOT in position 3
   - E is in position 4 (✓)
   - L is NOT in the word (x)

Current constraints:
- Word pattern: C _ R E _
- Letters definitely in: C (pos 1), R (pos 3), E (pos 4)
- Letters definitely absent: A, O, S, P, H, L
- U is in the word but NOT in position 3 (already satisfied since pos 3 is R)
- Remaining positions to fill: 2 and 5
- Allowed letters for positions 2 and 5: any letters not yet eliminated (not A, O, S, P, H, L)

Common remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
Common remaining vowels: I, U (U is already known to be in the word, but not yet placed)

Since U must be placed, and the only open positions are 2 and 5, and position 3 is R, position 4 is E, position 1 is C, U must be in either position 2 or 5.

Let’s try:
- Position 2: U
- Position 5: any remaining consonant

Candidate: C U R E _
Need a consonant for position 5 not yet used. Common choices: B, D, F, G, K, M, N, T, V, W, Y, Z.

“CURER” – but R is already in position 3, and we can’t have R twice (unless word has double R, but unlikely).
“CURED” – D is allowed.
“CUREK” – K is allowed but less common.
“CURET” – T is allowed.

“CURED” seems most plausible.

Check constraints:
- C(✓) U(-) R(✓) E(✓) D(x)
   - U is in position 2 (allowed, since earlier feedback only said U is not in position 3)
   - D is not yet eliminated
   - No forbidden letters

Thus, “CURED” fits all constraints.
