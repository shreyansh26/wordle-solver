For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct common letters to test multiple positions. 

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters in English words.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s not in position 1).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- The word contains S, but not in the first position.
- The word does NOT contain L, A, T, E.
- We still have four unknown positions (2-5) to fill with letters that haven’t been ruled out.

Good remaining common letters to test: R, I, N, O, U, C, H, M, D, G, B, F, K, P, Y, W, V, X, Z, Q, J.

I want a word that:
- Has S in one of positions 2-5.
- Uses other common letters not yet tested (e.g., R, I, N, O, C, H, etc.).
- Avoids L, A, T, E.

A strong next guess is “SHORN”:
- S is in position 1 again, but we know S isn’t in position 1 from SLATE, so this would violate the feedback. Let me rethink.

Better word: “CRISP” – but C and R haven’t been ruled out, but we want to test more letters.

Another good choice: “DRIPS” – but D, R, I, P, S: S is in position 5 (allowed), and we test D, R, I, P.

Wait, let’s pick a word where S is in position 2-5 and we introduce new common letters.

Good candidate: “SHRUB” – but H, R, U, B are new, and S is in position 1 (no good).

Better: “BRISK” – but B, R, I, S, K: S is in position 4 (allowed), and we test B, R, I, K.

But we already saw in the example that BRISK gives good feedback if the word is BRISK, but we don’t know the word yet.

Let me pick “SHRIN” – but that’s not a valid word.

Valid word: “SHRUB” – S in position 1 (invalid).

Valid word: “CRISP” – C, R, I, S, P: S in position 4 (allowed), tests C, R, I, P.

Another valid word: “CHURN” – C, H, U, R, N: tests C, H, U, R, N, and S is not present (but we know S is in the word, so this is bad).

We must include S somewhere in positions 2-5.

Valid word: “SPURN” – S, P, U, R, N: S in position 1 (invalid).

Valid word: “BRISK” – B, R, I, S, K: S in position 4 (allowed), tests B, R, I, K.

This seems good.

But let me think of a word that introduces more new common letters while keeping S in positions 2-5.

Valid word: “FRISK” – F, R, I, S, K: S in position 4, tests F, R, I, K.

Valid word: “GRISP” – G, R, I, S, P: S in position 4, tests G, R, I, P.

Valid word: “PRISM” – P, R, I, S, M: S in position 4, tests P, R, I, M.

I’ll choose “BRISK” as it tests B, R, I, K and has S in position 4.

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 (SLATE):
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

Round 2 (BRISK):
- B, R, I, K are NOT in the word.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, B, R, I, K
- Letter S is in the word, but cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
- Therefore S must be in position 2, 3, or 5.

Remaining common letters to test: C, D, F, G, H, M, N, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S in position 2, 3, or 5.
2. Uses only letters from the remaining pool (no L,A,T,E,B,R,I,K).
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Possible positions for S:
- Position 2: _S___
- Position 3: __S__
- Position 5: ____S

Let’s test position 2 with a word like “CLOUD” but that has no S. We need S in position 2.

Candidate words:
- “CUSPS” – C, U, S, P, S: S appears twice (positions 3 and 5), but we only know one S exists. Also uses U, C, P.
- “FUSIL” – but L is excluded.
- “DUSKY” – no S in position 2.
- “MUSKY” – no S in position 2.
- “HUSKS” – S in position 5 (allowed), tests H, U, K (but K is excluded), so bad.
- “NUSKS” – same issue with K.
- “GUSHS” – S in position 5, tests G, U, H.
- “FUSHS” – same as above with F.

Let’s pick “GUSHS”:
- G, U, S, H, S: S appears in positions 3 and 5. Even though we only know one S exists, this is acceptable as it still tells us about positions 3 and 5, and introduces G, U, H.

But a better choice might be “CUSPS”:
- C, U, S, P, S: tests C, U, P, and confirms S in positions 3 and 5.

However, we might want to avoid repeating S too much. Let’s instead choose a word with S in position 3 and other unique letters.

“FOSSA” – but A is excluded.
“MOSSY” – Y is allowed, but A is excluded.
“POSSUM” – too long.
“DUSKY” – no S in position 2.
“MUSKY” – same.

Another approach: S in position 5.
“CLOUD” – no S.
“FLOOD” – no S.
“GROIN” – no S.
“HUMID” – no S.
“JOKER” – no S.
“LOWLY” – no S.
“MONEY” – no S.
“NOVEM” – no S.
“PONCY” – no S.
“QUICK” – no S.
“UNION” – no S.
“VOCAL” – no S.
“WOKEN” – no S.
“YEARN” – no S.
“ZONAL” – no S.

Let’s list valid words with S in position 2, 3, or 5, avoiding excluded letters:

Excluded letters: L, A, T, E, B, R, I, K

Valid words:
- “CUSPS” – C, U, S, P, S (S in 3,5)
- “FUSIL” – invalid (L)

Let’s pick “CUSPS” as it tests C, U, P, and S positions.

But we might want to avoid double S. Let’s try S in position 2.

“CUSPS” has S in 3 and 5, but not 2. Let’s try:

“CUSPS” – no S in 2.

But we might want to avoid double S. Let’s try S in position 2.

“CUSPS” – no S in 2.

Actually, none of these have S in position 2. Let’s think differently.

We need a word with S in 2, 3, or 5, and no excluded letters.

Excluded letters: L, A, T, E, B, R, I, K

Valid letters: C, D, F, G, H, M, N, O, P, U, V, W, Y, S

<guess>CUSPS</guess>",CUSPS,"From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 (SLATE):
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

Round 2 (BRISK):
- B, R, I, K are NOT in the word.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, B, R, I, K
- Letter S is in the word, but cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
- Therefore S must be in position 2, 3, or 5.

Remaining common letters to test: C, D, F, G, H, M, N, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S in position 2, 3, or 5.
2. Uses only letters from the remaining pool (no L,A,T,E,B,R,I,K).
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Possible positions for S:
- Position 2: _S___
- Position 3: __S__
- Position 5: ____S

Let’s test position 2 with a word like “CLOUD” but that has no S. We need S in position 2.

Candidate words:
- “CUSPS” – C, U, S, P, S: S appears twice (positions 3 and 5), but we only know one S exists. Also uses U, C, P.
- “FUSIL” – but L is excluded.
- “DUSKY” – no S in position 2.
- “MUSKY” – no S in position 2.
- “HUSKS” – S in position 5 (allowed), tests H, U, K (but K is excluded), so bad.
- “NUSKS” – same issue with K.
- “GUSHS” – S in position 5, tests G, U, H.
- “FUSHS” – same as above with F.

Let’s pick “GUSHS”:
- G, U, S, H, S: S appears in positions 3 and 5. Even though we only know one S exists, this is acceptable as it still tells us about positions 3 and 5, and introduces G, U, H.

But a better choice might be “CUSPS”:
- C, U, S, P, S: tests C, U, P, and confirms S in positions 3 and 5.

However, we might want to avoid repeating S too much. Let’s instead choose a word with S in position 3 and other unique letters.

“MOSSY” – Y is allowed, but A is excluded.
“POSSUM” – too long.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct common letters to test multiple positions. 

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters in English words.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s not in position 1).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- The word contains S, but not in the first position.
- The word does NOT contain L, A, T, E.
- We still have four unknown positions (2-5) to fill with letters that haven’t been ruled out.

Good remaining common letters to test: R, I, N, O, U, C, H, M, D, G, B, F, K, P, Y, W, V, X, Z, Q, J.

I want a word that:
- Has S in one of positions 2-5.
- Uses other common letters not yet tested (e.g., R, I, N, O, C, H, etc.).
- Avoids L, A, T, E.

A strong next guess is “SHORN”:
- S is in position 1 again, but we know S isn’t in position 1 from SLATE, so this would violate the feedback. Let me rethink.

Better word: “CRISP” – but C and R haven’t been ruled out, but we want to test more letters.

Another good choice: “DRIPS” – but D, R, I, P, S: S is in position 5 (allowed), and we test D, R, I, P.

Wait, let’s pick a word where S is in position 2-5 and we introduce new common letters.

Good candidate: “SHRUB” – but H, R, U, B are new, and S is in position 1 (no good).

Better: “BRISK” – but B, R, I, S, K: S is in position 4 (allowed), and we test B, R, I, K.

But we already saw in the example that BRISK gives good feedback if the word is BRISK, but we don’t know the word yet.

Let me pick “SHRIN” – but that’s not a valid word.

Valid word: “SHRUB” – S in position 1 (invalid).

Valid word: “CRISP” – C, R, I, S, P: S in position 4 (allowed), tests C, R, I, P.

Another valid word: “CHURN” – C, H, U, R, N: tests C, H, U, R, N, and S is not present (but we know S is in the word, so this is bad).

We must include S somewhere in positions 2-5.

Valid word: “SPURN” – S, P, U, R, N: S in position 1 (invalid).

Valid word: “BRISK” – B, R, I, S, K: S in position 4 (allowed), tests B, R, I, K.

This seems good.

But let me think of a word that introduces more new common letters while keeping S in positions 2-5.

Valid word: “FRISK” – F, R, I, S, K: S in position 4, tests F, R, I, K.

Valid word: “GRISP” – G, R, I, S, P: S in position 4, tests G, R, I, P.

Valid word: “PRISM” – P, R, I, S, M: S in position 4, tests P, R, I, M.

I’ll choose “BRISK” as it tests B, R, I, K and has S in position 4.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct common letters to test multiple positions. 

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters in English words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s not in position 1).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- The word contains S, but not in the first position.
- The word does NOT contain L, A, T, E.
- We still have four unknown positions (2-5) to fill with letters that haven’t been ruled out.

Good remaining common letters to test: R, I, N, O, U, C, H, M, D, G, B, F, K, P, Y, W, V, X, Z, Q, J.

I want a word that:
- Has S in one of positions 2-5.
- Uses other common letters not yet tested (e.g., R, I, N, O, C, H, etc.).
- Avoids L, A, T, E.

A strong next guess is “SHORN”:
- S is in position 1 again, but we know S isn’t in position 1 from SLATE, so this would violate the feedback. Let me rethink.

Better word: “CRISP” – but C and R haven’t been ruled out, but we want to test more letters.

Another good choice: “DRIPS” – but D, R, I, P, S: S is in position 5 (allowed), and we test D, R, I, P.

Wait, let’s pick a word where S is in position 2-5 and we introduce new common letters.

Good candidate: “SHRUB” – but H, R, U, B are new, and S is in position 1 (no good).

Better: “BRISK” – but B, R, I, S, K: S is in position 4 (allowed), and we test B, R, I, K.

But we already saw in the example that BRISK gives good feedback if the word is BRISK, but we don’t know the word yet.

Let me pick “SHRIN” – but that’s not a valid word.

Valid word: “SHRUB” – S in position 1 (invalid).

Valid word: “CRISP” – C, R, I, S, P: S in position 4 (allowed), tests C, R, I, P.

Another valid word: “CHURN” – C, H, U, R, N: tests C, H, U, R, N, and S is not present (but we know S is in the word, so this is bad).

We must include S somewhere in positions 2-5.

Valid word: “SPURN” – S, P, U, R, N: S in position 1 (invalid).

Valid word: “BRISK” – B, R, I, S, K: S in position 4 (allowed), tests B, R, I, K.

This seems good.

But let me think of a word that introduces more new common letters while keeping S in positions 2-5.

Valid word: “FRISK” – F, R, I, S, K: S in position 4, tests F, R, I, K.

Valid word: “GRISP” – G, R, I, S, P: S in position 4, tests G, R, I, P.

Valid word: “PRISM” – P, R, I, S, M: S in position 4, tests P, R, I, M.

I’ll choose “BRISK” as it tests B, R, I, K and has S in position 4.

Guess 2: BRISK -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(x) I(x) S(-) K(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 (SLATE):
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

Round 2 (BRISK):
- B, R, I, K are NOT in the word.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, B, R, I, K
- Letter S is in the word, but cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
- Therefore S must be in position 2, 3, or 5.

Remaining common letters to test: C, D, F, G, H, M, N, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S in position 2, 3, or 5.
2. Uses only letters from the remaining pool (no L,A,T,E,B,R,I,K).
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Possible positions for S:
- Position 2: _S___
- Position 3: __S__
- Position 5: ____S

Let’s test position 2 with a word like “CLOUD” but that has no S. We need S in position 2.

Candidate words:
- “CUSPS” – C, U, S, P, S: S appears twice (positions 3 and 5), but we only know one S exists. Also uses U, C, P.
- “FUSIL” – but L is excluded.
- “DUSKY” – no S in position 2.
- “MUSKY” – no S in position 2.
- “HUSKS” – S in position 5 (allowed), tests H, U, K (but K is excluded), so bad.
- “NUSKS” – same issue with K.
- “GUSHS” – S in position 5, tests G, U, H.
- “FUSHS” – same as above with F.

Let’s pick “GUSHS”:
- G, U, S, H, S: S appears in positions 3 and 5. Even though we only know one S exists, this is acceptable as it still tells us about positions 3 and 5, and introduces G, U, H.

But a better choice might be “CUSPS”:
- C, U, S, P, S: tests C, U, P, and confirms S in positions 3 and 5.

However, we might want to avoid repeating S too much. Let’s instead choose a word with S in position 3 and other unique letters.

“FOSSA” – but A is excluded.
“MOSSY” – Y is allowed, but A is excluded.
“POSSUM” – too long.
“DUSKY” – no S in position 2.
“MUSKY” – same.

Another approach: S in position 5.
“CLOUD” – no S.
“FLOOD” – no S.
“GROIN” – no S.
“HUMID” – no S.
“JOKER” – no S.
“LOWLY” – no S.
“MONEY” – no S.
“NOVEM” – no S.
“PONCY” – no S.
“QUICK” – no S.
“UNION” – no S.
“VOCAL” – no S.
“WOKEN” – no S.
“YEARN” – no S.
“ZONAL” – no S.

Let’s list valid words with S in position 2, 3, or 5, avoiding excluded letters:

Excluded letters: L, A, T, E, B, R, I, K

Valid words:
- “CUSPS” – C, U, S, P, S (S in 3,5)
- “FUSIL” – invalid (L)
- “GUSHS” – G, U, S, H, S (S in 3,5)
- “HUSKS” – invalid (K)
- “MUSKY” – invalid (K)
- “NUSKS” – invalid (K)
- “PUSHS” – P, U, S, H, S (S in 3,5)
- “DUSKY” – no S in 2,3,5
- “FUSKY” – no S in 2,3,5
- “GUSKY” – no S in 2,3,5
- “HUSKY” – no S in 2,3,5
- “MUSKY” – invalid (K)
- “NUSKY” – invalid (K)
- “PUSKY” – invalid (K)

Best candidates: CUSPS, GUSHS, PUSHS

Let’s pick “CUSPS” as it tests C, U, P, and S positions.

But we might want to avoid double S. Let’s try S in position 2.

“CUSPS” has S in 3 and 5, but not 2. Let’s try:

“CUSPS” – no S in 2.
“GUSHS” – no S in 2.
“PUSHS” – no S in 2.

We need S in 2, 3, or 5. Let’s try S in position 3.

“FOSSA” – A excluded.
“MOSSY” – Y allowed, but S in 3, Y in 5, tests M, O, S, Y.
“POSSY” – S in 3, tests P, O, S, Y.

“MOSSY” – M, O, S, S, Y: S in 3,5. Valid.

Let’s go with “MOSSY”:
- M, O, S, S, Y: tests M, O, Y, and confirms S in 3 and 5.

But we might want to avoid double S. Let’s try S in position 2.

“CUSPS” – no S in 2.
“GUSHS” – no S in 2.
“PUSHS” – no S in 2.

Actually, none of these have S in position 2. Let’s think differently.

We need a word with S in 2, 3, or 5, and no excluded letters.

Excluded letters: L, A, T, E, B, R, I, K

Valid letters: C, D, F, G, H, M, N, O, P, U, V, W, Y, S

Let’s try S in position 2:
- “CUSPS” – C, U, S, P, S: S in 3,5 (not 2)
- “FUSPS” – F, U, S, P, S: same
- “GUSPS” – G, U, S, P, S: same
- “HUSPS” – H, U, S, P, S: same
- “MUSPS” – M, U, S, P, S: same
- “NUSPS” – N, U, S, P, S: same
- “PUSPS” – P, U, S, P, S: same

None have S in position 2. Let’s try S in position 3.

“CUSPS” – S in 3,5
“FUSPS” – S in 3,5
“GUSPS” – S in 3,5
“HUSPS” – S in 3,5
“MUSPS” – S in 3,5
“NUSPS” – S in 3,5

“WOKEN” – no S.
“YEARN” – no S.
“ZONAL” – no S.

Let’s list valid words with S in position 5:

“CUSPS” – S in 5, but also 3.
“GUSHS” – S in 5, but also 3.
“MOSSY” – S in 3,5.
“NUSKS” – invalid (K).
“PUSKS” – invalid (K).

“CUSPS” – valid, tests C, U, P, S in 3,5.

Let’s go with “CUSPS” as it introduces new letters C, U, P, and tells us about S positions.

But to maximize info, let’s pick “CUSPS”.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: BRISK -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(x) I(x) S(-) K(-)
Guess 3: CUSPS -> FEEDBACK: C(x) U(-) S(-) P(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's parse the new feedback from CUSPS:

C(x) – C is not in the word.  
U(-) – U is in the word but not in position 2.  
S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 3.  
P(x) – P is not in the word.  
S(✓) – S is in the word and in position 5.

So we now know:
- S is in position 5 (last letter).
- Letters not in the word: L, A, T, E, B, R, I, K, C, P.
- U is in the word but not in position 2.
- Remaining usable letters (common ones): D, F, G, H, M, N, O, V, W, Y, S (but S is already fixed at position 5).

We need a 5-letter word ending in S, containing U somewhere except position 2, and using only the remaining letters.

Possible patterns: _ _ _ _ S  
Positions for U: 1, 3, 4 (cannot be 2 or 5).

Let’s brainstorm valid words:
- D, F, G, H, M, N, O, V, W, Y + U + S.

Examples:
- HUMPS – P is excluded.
- FOUND – ends in D, not S.
- MUDSY – ends in Y, not S.
- GONYS – not a valid word.
- VOMUS – not a word.
- HONUS – valid word, H, O, N, U, S. U is in position 4 (allowed), ends in S.

Let’s check HONUS:
- Letters: H, O, N, U, S.
- All letters are allowed (none excluded).
- U is in position 4 (not 2), S in 5 (correct).
- Tests H, O, N.

This seems optimal.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct common letters to test multiple positions. 

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters in English words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s not in position 1).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- The word contains S, but not in the first position.
- The word does NOT contain L, A, T, E.
- We still have four unknown positions (2-5) to fill with letters that haven’t been ruled out.

Good remaining common letters to test: R, I, N, O, U, C, H, M, D, G, B, F, K, P, Y, W, V, X, Z, Q, J.

I want a word that:
- Has S in one of positions 2-5.
- Uses other common letters not yet tested (e.g., R, I, N, O, C, H, etc.).
- Avoids L, A, T, E.

A strong next guess is “SHORN”:
- S is in position 1 again, but we know S isn’t in position 1 from SLATE, so this would violate the feedback. Let me rethink.

Better word: “CRISP” – but C and R haven’t been ruled out, but we want to test more letters.

Another good choice: “DRIPS” – but D, R, I, P, S: S is in position 5 (allowed), and we test D, R, I, P.

Wait, let’s pick a word where S is in position 2-5 and we introduce new common letters.

Good candidate: “SHRUB” – but H, R, U, B are new, and S is in position 1 (no good).

Better: “BRISK” – but B, R, I, S, K: S is in position 4 (allowed), and we test B, R, I, K.

But we already saw in the example that BRISK gives good feedback if the word is BRISK, but we don’t know the word yet.

Let me pick “SHRIN” – but that’s not a valid word.

Valid word: “SHRUB” – S in position 1 (invalid).

Valid word: “CRISP” – C, R, I, S, P: S in position 4 (allowed), tests C, R, I, P.

Another valid word: “CHURN” – C, H, U, R, N: tests C, H, U, R, N, and S is not present (but we know S is in the word, so this is bad).

We must include S somewhere in positions 2-5.

Valid word: “SPURN” – S, P, U, R, N: S in position 1 (invalid).

Valid word: “BRISK” – B, R, I, S, K: S in position 4 (allowed), tests B, R, I, K.

This seems good.

But let me think of a word that introduces more new common letters while keeping S in positions 2-5.

Valid word: “FRISK” – F, R, I, S, K: S in position 4, tests F, R, I, K.

Valid word: “GRISP” – G, R, I, S, P: S in position 4, tests G, R, I, P.

Valid word: “PRISM” – P, R, I, S, M: S in position 4, tests P, R, I, M.

I’ll choose “BRISK” as it tests B, R, I, K and has S in position 4.

- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

Round 2 (BRISK):
- B, R, I, K are NOT in the word.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, B, R, I, K
- Letter S is in the word, but cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
- Therefore S must be in position 2, 3, or 5.

Remaining common letters to test: C, D, F, G, H, M, N, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S in position 2, 3, or 5.
2. Uses only letters from the remaining pool (no L,A,T,E,B,R,I,K).
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Possible positions for S:
- Position 2: _S___
- Position 3: __S__
- Position 5: ____S

Let’s test position 2 with a word like “CLOUD” but that has no S. We need S in position 2.

Candidate words:
- “CUSPS” – C, U, S, P, S: S appears twice (positions 3 and 5), but we only know one S exists. Also uses U, C, P.
- “FUSIL” – but L is excluded.
- “DUSKY” – no S in position 2.
- “MUSKY” – no S in position 2.
- “HUSKS” – S in position 5 (allowed), tests H, U, K (but K is excluded), so bad.
- “NUSKS” – same issue with K.
- “GUSHS” – S in position 5, tests G, U, H.
- “FUSHS” – same as above with F.

Let’s pick “GUSHS”:
- G, U, S, H, S: S appears in positions 3 and 5. Even though we only know one S exists, this is acceptable as it still tells us about positions 3 and 5, and introduces G, U, H.

But a better choice might be “CUSPS”:
- C, U, S, P, S: tests C, U, P, and confirms S in positions 3 and 5.

However, we might want to avoid repeating S too much. Let’s instead choose a word with S in position 3 and other unique letters.

“FOSSA” – but A is excluded.
“MOSSY” – Y is allowed, but A is excluded.
“POSSUM” – too long.
“DUSKY” – no S in position 2.
“MUSKY” – same.

Another approach: S in position 5.
“CLOUD” – no S.
“FLOOD” – no S.
“GROIN” – no S.
“HUMID” – no S.
“JOKER” – no S.
“LOWLY” – no S.
“MONEY” – no S.
“NOVEM” – no S.
“PONCY” – no S.
“QUICK” – no S.
“UNION” – no S.
“VOCAL” – no S.
“WOKEN” – no S.
“YEARN” – no S.
“ZONAL” – no S.

Let’s list valid words with S in position 2, 3, or 5, avoiding excluded letters:

Excluded letters: L, A, T, E, B, R, I, K

Valid words:
- “CUSPS” – C, U, S, P, S (S in 3,5)
- “FUSIL” – invalid (L)
- “GUSHS” – G, U, S, H, S (S in 3,5)
- “HUSKS” – invalid (K)
- “MUSKY” – invalid (K)
- “NUSKS” – invalid (K)
- “PUSHS” – P, U, S, H, S (S in 3,5)
- “DUSKY” – no S in 2,3,5
- “FUSKY” – no S in 2,3,5
- “GUSKY” – no S in 2,3,5
- “HUSKY” – no S in 2,3,5
- “MUSKY” – invalid (K)
- “NUSKY” – invalid (K)
- “PUSKY” – invalid (K)

Best candidates: CUSPS, GUSHS, PUSHS

Let’s pick “CUSPS” as it tests C, U, P, and S positions.

But we might want to avoid double S. Let’s try S in position 2.

“CUSPS” has S in 3 and 5, but not 2. Let’s try:

“CUSPS” – no S in 2.
“GUSHS” – no S in 2.
“PUSHS” – no S in 2.

We need S in 2, 3, or 5. Let’s try S in position 3.

“FOSSA” – A excluded.
“MOSSY” – Y allowed, but S in 3, Y in 5, tests M, O, S, Y.
“POSSY” – S in 3, tests P, O, S, Y.

“MOSSY” – M, O, S, S, Y: S in 3,5. Valid.

Let’s go with “MOSSY”:
- M, O, S, S, Y: tests M, O, Y, and confirms S in 3 and 5.

But we might want to avoid double S. Let’s try S in position 2.

“CUSPS” – no S in 2.
“GUSHS” – no S in 2.
“PUSHS” – no S in 2.

Actually, none of these have S in position 2. Let’s think differently.

We need a word with S in 2, 3, or 5, and no excluded letters.

Excluded letters: L, A, T, E, B, R, I, K

Valid letters: C, D, F, G, H, M, N, O, P, U, V, W, Y, S

Let’s try S in position 2:
- “CUSPS” – C, U, S, P, S: S in 3,5 (not 2)
- “FUSPS” – F, U, S, P, S: same
- “GUSPS” – G, U, S, P, S: same
- “HUSPS” – H, U, S, P, S: same
- “MUSPS” – M, U, S, P, S: same
- “NUSPS” – N, U, S, P, S: same
- “PUSPS” – P, U, S, P, S: same

None have S in position 2. Let’s try S in position 3.

“CUSPS” – S in 3,5
“FUSPS” – S in 3,5
“GUSPS” – S in 3,5
“HUSPS” – S in 3,5
“MUSPS” – S in 3,5
“NUSPS” – S in 3,5
“PUSPS” – S in 3,5

Let’s pick “CUSPS”.

But we might want to avoid double S. Let’s try S in position 5.

“CLOUD” – no S.
“FLOOD” – no S.
“GROIN” – no S.
“HUMID” – no S.
“JOKER” – no S.
“LOWLY” – no S.
“MONEY” – no S.
“NOVEM” – no S.
“PONCY” – no S.
“QUICK” – no S.
“UNION” – no S.
“VOCAL” – no S.
“WOKEN” – no S.
“YEARN” – no S.
“ZONAL” – no S.

Let’s list valid words with S in position 5:

“CUSPS” – S in 5, but also 3.
“GUSHS” – S in 5, but also 3.
“MOSSY” – S in 3,5.
“NUSKS” – invalid (K).
“PUSKS” – invalid (K).

“CUSPS” – valid, tests C, U, P, S in 3,5.

Let’s go with “CUSPS” as it introduces new letters C, U, P, and tells us about S positions.

But to maximize info, let’s pick “CUSPS”.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: BRISK -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(x) I(x) S(-) K(-)
Guess 3: CUSPS -> FEEDBACK: C(x) U(-) S(-) P(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's parse the new feedback from CUSPS:

C(x) – C is not in the word.  
U(-) – U is in the word but not in position 2.  
S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 3.  
P(x) – P is not in the word.  
S(✓) – S is in the word and in position 5.

So we now know:
- S is in position 5 (last letter).
- Letters not in the word: L, A, T, E, B, R, I, K, C, P.
- U is in the word but not in position 2.
- Remaining usable letters (common ones): D, F, G, H, M, N, O, V, W, Y, S (but S is already fixed at position 5).

We need a 5-letter word ending in S, containing U somewhere except position 2, and using only the remaining letters.

Possible patterns: _ _ _ _ S  
Positions for U: 1, 3, 4 (cannot be 2 or 5).

Let’s brainstorm valid words:
- D, F, G, H, M, N, O, V, W, Y + U + S.

Examples:
- HUMPS – P is excluded.
- FOUND – ends in D, not S.
- MUDSY – ends in Y, not S.
- GONYS – not a valid word.
- VOMUS – not a word.
- HONUS – valid word, H, O, N, U, S. U is in position 4 (allowed), ends in S.

Let’s check HONUS:
- Letters: H, O, N, U, S.
- All letters are allowed (none excluded).
- U is in position 4 (not 2), S in 5 (correct).
- Tests H, O, N.

This seems optimal.

Current confirmed facts:
1. The word ends in S (position 5).
2. Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, B, R, I, K, C, P, H, N.
3. Letters known to be in the word: O (position 2), U (somewhere except positions 2, 4, 5).
4. Therefore U must be in position 1 or 3.
5. Remaining usable letters: D, F, G, M, V, W, Y, O, U, S.

Word pattern: _ _ _ _ S
- Position 2 is O.
- U must be in 1 or 3.
- Positions 3 and 4 must be from the remaining usable letters.

Possible patterns:
- U O _ _ S
- _ O U _ S

Let’s explore:
1. U O _ _ S:
   - U, O are fixed.
   - Need two letters from D, F, G, M, V, W, Y for positions 3 and 4.
   - Possible combinations: U O D M S, U O D G S, etc.
   - Valid words: ""UOGMS"" – not valid; ""UODYS"" – not valid.

2. _ O U _ S:
   - Position 1 and 4 need letters from D, F, G, M, V, W, Y.
   - Possible combinations: D O U G S, F O U G S, M O U G S, etc.
   - Valid words: ""DOUGS"" – valid; ""FOUGS"" – not valid; ""MOUGS"" – not valid.

""DOUGS"" fits perfectly:
- D (position 1), O (position 2), U (position 3), G (position 4), S (position 5).
- All letters are allowed.
- U is in position 3 (allowed).
- O is in position 2 (correct).
- Ends with S (correct).

This is our best guess.

From DOUGS we now know:

- U(✓) – U is in position 3 (already known).
- G(-) – G is in the word but not in position 4.
- S(✓) – S is in position 5 (already known).

Confirmed structure so far:
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: U
- Position 5: S
- Therefore the word is of the form: _ O U _ S
- Letters already excluded: L, A, T, E, B, R, I, K, C, P, H, N, D, G (from feedback), plus any others used so far.
- Remaining usable letters for positions 1 and 4: F, M, V, W, Y.

We need a valid 5-letter word matching _ O U _ S using only F, M, V, W, Y in positions 1 and 4.

Possible combinations:
- F O U _ S: F, O, U, _, S → need a letter for position 4 from F, M, V, W, Y that hasn’t been used. F is already used in position 1, so remaining are M, V, W, Y.
  - F O U M S → ""FOUMS"" – not a valid word.

Wait, let’s re-examine the remaining letters and valid words. The only valid English word that fits _ O U _ S with the allowed letters is ""MOUSY"" – but Y is allowed in position 4, and M in position 1.

""MOUSY"" – letters M, O, U, S, Y.
- M is allowed (not excluded).
- O is in position 2 (correct).
- U is in position 3 (correct).
- S is in position 5 (correct).
- Y is allowed in position 4.

Thus, the only valid remaining word is ""MOUSY"".
