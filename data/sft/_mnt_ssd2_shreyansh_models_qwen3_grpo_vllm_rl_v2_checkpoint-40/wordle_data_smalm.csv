### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that has common letters and can help us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word, helping us narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not fourth).
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters not in the word: R, O, E
- Letters in the word but misplaced: A, S
- A cannot be in position 1, S cannot be in position 4.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and S.
2. Does not contain R, O, or E.
3. Places A somewhere other than position 1.
4. Places S somewhere other than position 4.

Let’s try a word like “STAIN”:
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since it was only excluded from position 4).
- T is a new consonant.
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since it was only excluded from position 1).
- I is a new vowel.
- N is a new consonant.

This seems like a good second guess to test new letters while incorporating the known letters A and S.

Current knowledge:

- Pattern: S _ A _ _  (S and A locked in positions 1 and 3)
- Letters known to be in the word:
  – S (position 1)
  – A (position 3)
- Letters known NOT in the word: R, O, E, T, I, N, C, K
- From Guess 3 we also learned: L is in the word but NOT in position 2.

So the word looks like: S _ A _ _ and must contain L somewhere (but not in position 2).

Possible positions for L: 4 or 5.

Let’s list common English words that fit S _ A _ _ and contain L in position 4 or 5:

- S L A B _  → SLAB_ – but we need 5 letters, so SLABS? (plural of slab) – but B and S are allowed.
- S L A P _  → SLAP_ – SLAPS (plural of slap) – but P and S are allowed.
- S L A M _  → SLAM_ – SLAMS (plural of slam) – M is allowed.
- S P A L _  → SPAL_ – SPALD? Not common.
- S H A L _  → SHAL_ – SHALM? Not a word.
- S W A L _  → SWAL_ – SWAL_ doesn’t yield common words.
- S P A L L  – SPALL (a real word meaning a flat surface or a legal term).

Among these, SPALL is a valid 5-letter word that fits the pattern S _ A _ _ and places L in position 4, which is allowed since L was only marked as “wrong position” in SLACK (it was in position 2 then, so position 4 is new).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that has common letters and can help us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word, helping us narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not fourth).
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters not in the word: R, O, E
- Letters in the word but misplaced: A, S
- A cannot be in position 1, S cannot be in position 4.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and S.
2. Does not contain R, O, or E.
3. Places A somewhere other than position 1.
4. Places S somewhere other than position 4.

Let’s try a word like “STAIN”:
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since it was only excluded from position 4).
- T is a new consonant.
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since it was only excluded from position 1).
- I is a new vowel.
- N is a new consonant.

This seems like a good second guess to test new letters while incorporating the known letters A and S.

So the pattern so far is:

We now have four pieces of feedback.

1. Letters known NOT in the word:
   R, O, E, T, I, N, C, K, P

2. Fixed positions:
   - Position 1: S ✓
   - Position 3: A ✓
   - Position 4: L ✓

3. From Guess 4 (SPALL):
   - L in position 5 is in the word but NOT in position 5 (so L must be in position 2 or 4)
   - However, position 4 is already locked as L from Guess 3 (SLACK: L in position 2 was marked “-”, so position 4 is correct for L).

Therefore, the pattern is:
S _ A L _

Letters still allowed (not yet eliminated):
B, D, F, G, H, J, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a common 5-letter word that starts with S, has A in position 3, and L in position 4. The only common English word fitting this exact pattern is:

S H A L _  → “SHAL_” – but we need a 5-letter word.  
“SHAL” is 4 letters, so we need a 5-letter word starting with S, A in 3rd, L in 4th.

Checking possibilities:
- S B A L _  → SBAL_ – no common word
- S D A L _  → SDAL_ – no
- S F A L _  → SFAL_ – no
- S G A L _  → SGAL_ – no
- S H A L _  → SHAL_ – needs 5 letters, so “SHAL” + another letter. “SHALY” is 5 letters but uncommon.
- S M A L _  → SMAL_ – SMALT (a type of glass) – but SMALT is 5 letters and fits S M A L T, but T is already eliminated.
- S W A L _  → SWAL_ – SWAL_ doesn’t yield 5-letter words.

Wait, let’s re-examine the pattern: S _ A L _ (positions 1,3,4 fixed). The only common English word fitting this is:

S H A L _  → “SHAL_” – but we need a 5-letter word. Actually, “SHAL” is 4 letters, so we need a 5-letter word starting with S, A in 3rd, L in 4th. The only common word is:

“SHAL” + a letter, but none fit except “SHALY” (a type of algae) – but it’s uncommon. 

However, another possibility is “SWALE” – but E is eliminated. 

Wait, let’s list all 5-letter words matching S _ A L _:

- S B A L _  – none
- S D A L _  – none
- S F A L _  – none
- S G A L _  – none
- S H A L _  – “SHALY” (valid but uncommon)
- S M A L _  – “SMALT” (valid, but T is eliminated from earlier feedback)
- S W A L _  – “SWAL_” – no common word

But looking back at the feedback, in Guess 4 (SPALL) the second L in position 5 was marked “-” (in word, wrong position). This implies the word has only one L, and it’s already placed at position 4. So the pattern is definitely S _ A L _.

Given that, the only common 5-letter word matching S _ A L _ is “SHALY” (though uncommon) or “SMALT” (but T is eliminated). 

However, recalling the feedback: in Guess 3 (SLACK) the L in position 2 was marked “-”, meaning L is in the word but not in position 2. In Guess 4 (SPALL) the L in position 5 was marked “-”, meaning L is in the word but not in position 5. This confirms L must be in position 4 (since positions 2 and 5 are excluded for L, and position 4 is the only remaining slot for L in the pattern S _ A _ _).

Thus, the word must be S _ A L _. The only common 5-letter word fitting this is “SHALY” (though it’s a type of algae), but since we’re limited to valid English words, and no other common words fit, we must accept “SHALY”.

But let’s double-check: are there any other 5-letter words matching S _ A L _?

- S B A L _  – none
- S D A L _  – none
- S F A L _  – none
- S G A L _  – none
- S H A L _  – “SHALY”
- S M A L _  – “SMALT” (T eliminated)
- S W A L _  – none

Thus, “SHALY” is the only valid option left.

But wait – let’s recall the exact feedback: in Guess 4 (SPALL) the L in position 5 was marked “-”, which means L is in the word but not in position 5. This does not eliminate the possibility of another L, but it’s more likely the word has only one L placed at position 4.

Given that, and no other common 5-letter words fitting S _ A L _, the correct word must be “SHALY”.

However, “SHALY” is a valid 5-letter word (an algae or a variant spelling of shale). Given the constraints, this seems to be the only possible word left.

But let’s consider another angle: the feedback in Guess 4 shows the second L (position 5) is in the word but wrong position, implying the word has two L’s: one in position 4 (confirmed ✓) and another somewhere else. But position 5 is excluded for the second L, and positions 1,3 are already S and A. Thus the second L would have to be in position 2, but in Guess 3 (SLACK) the L in position 2 was marked “-”, meaning L is in the word but not in position 2. This creates a contradiction, implying the word has only one L at position 4.

Therefore, the pattern is definitely S _ A L _ with only one L at position 4. The only common 5-letter word fitting this is “SHALY”.

But let’s check if “SHALY” uses any eliminated letters: H and Y are not in the eliminated list (R,O,E,T,I,N,C,K,P). Thus, “SHALY” is valid.

However, another possible word is “SWALE” – but E is eliminated. 

After careful consideration, the only valid 5-letter word left is “SHALY”.

But wait – let’s list all remaining allowed letters for positions 2 and 5:

Allowed letters (not eliminated): B, D, F, G, H, J, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Possible words:
- S B A L _  – SBAL_ – none
- S D A L _  – SDAL_ – none
- S F A L _  – SFAL_ – none
- S G A L _  – SGAL_ – none
- S H A L _  – SHALY
- S M A L _  – SMALT (T eliminated)
- S W A L _  – SWAL_ – none
- S B A L _  – none
- S H A L _  – SHALY is the only one.

Thus, the correct word must be “SHALY”.

But let’s check another possibility: “SHAL” + a letter. The only 5-letter word is “SHALY”.

Therefore, the next guess is “SHALY”.

However, to be absolutely certain, let’s consider if there’s another word: “SUAL_” – no. 

After exhaustive check, “SHALY” is the only possible word left.

But wait – let’s recall that in Guess 4 (SPALL) the feedback was:
S(✓) P(x) A(✓) L(✓) L(-)

This means:
- Position 1: S ✓
- Position 3: A ✓
- Position 4: L ✓
- Position 5: L is in the word but not in position 5 (so L must be in position 2, but position 2 is currently empty in the pattern S _ A L _). This implies the word has two L’s: one in position 4 and another in position 2.

But in Guess 3 (SLACK) the L in position 2 was marked “-”, meaning L is in the word but not in position 2. This is a contradiction because the feedback now says L is in position 5 but wrong, implying L must be in position 2, which was already marked as wrong.

This suggests the word has only one L at position 4, and the second L in position 5 was marked “-” to indicate that L is not in position 5 (it’s already correctly placed at 4). Thus, the pattern remains S _ A L _ with only one L at position 4.

Given that, the only common 5-letter word left is “SHALY”.

But let’s check another angle: the word might be “SWALE” – but E is eliminated. 

After careful re-evaluation, the only possible word left is “SHALY”.

Therefore, the next guess is:

<guess>SHALY</guess>
</think>

<guess>SHALY</guess>",SHALY,"We now have four pieces of feedback.

1. Letters known NOT in the word:
   R, O, E, T, I, N, C, K, P

2. Fixed positions:
   - Position 1: S ✓
   - Position 3: A ✓
   - Position 4: L ✓

3. From Guess 4 (SPALL):
   - L in position 5 is in the word but NOT in position 5 (so L must be in position 2 or 4)
   - However, position 4 is already locked as L from Guess 3 (SLACK: L in position 2 was marked “-”, so position 4 is correct for L).

Therefore, the pattern is:
S _ A L _

Letters still allowed (not yet eliminated):
B, D, F, G, H, J, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a common 5-letter word that starts with S, has A in position 3, and L in position 4. The only common English word fitting this exact pattern is:

S H A L _  → “SHAL_” – but we need a 5-letter word.  
“SHAL” is 4 letters, so we need a 5-letter word starting with S, A in 3rd, L in 4th.

Checking possibilities:
- S B A L _  → SBAL_ – no common word
- S D A L _  → SDAL_ – no
- S F A L _  → SFAL_ – no
- S G A L _  → SGAL_ – no
- S H A L _  → SHAL_ – needs 5 letters, so “SHAL” + another letter. “SHALY” is 5 letters but uncommon.
- S M A L _  → SMAL_ – SMALT (a type of glass) – but SMALT is 5 letters and fits S M A L T, but T is already eliminated.
- S W A L _  → SWAL_ – SWAL_ doesn’t yield 5-letter words.

Wait, let’s re-examine the pattern: S _ A L _ (positions 1,3,4 fixed). The only common English word fitting this is:

S H A L _  → “SHAL_” – but we need a 5-letter word. Actually, “SHAL” is 4 letters, so we need a 5-letter word starting with S, A in 3rd, L in 4th. The only common word is:

“SHAL” + a letter, but none fit except “SHALY” (a type of algae) – but it’s uncommon. 

However, another possibility is “SWALE” – but E is eliminated. 

Wait, let’s list all 5-letter words matching S _ A L _:

- S B A L _  – none
- S D A L _  – none
- S F A L _  – none
- S G A L _  – none
- S H A L _  – “SHALY” (valid but uncommon)
- S M A L _  – “SMALT” (valid, but T is eliminated from earlier feedback)
- S W A L _  – “SWAL_” – no common word

But looking back at the feedback, in Guess 4 (SPALL) the second L in position 5 was marked “-” (in word, wrong position). This implies the word has only one L, and it’s already placed at position 4. So the pattern is definitely S _ A L _.

Given that, the only common 5-letter word matching S _ A L _ is “SHALY” (though uncommon) or “SMALT” (but T is eliminated). 

However, recalling the feedback: in Guess 3 (SLACK) the L in position 2 was marked “-”, meaning L is in the word but not in position 2. In Guess 4 (SPALL) the L in position 5 was marked “-”, meaning L is in the word but not in position 5. This confirms L must be in position 4 (since positions 2 and 5 are excluded for L, and position 4 is the only remaining slot for L in the pattern S _ A _ _).

Thus, the word must be S _ A L _. The only common 5-letter word fitting this is “SHALY” (though it’s a type of algae), but since we’re limited to valid English words, and no other common words fit, we must accept “SHALY”.

But let’s double-check: are there any other 5-letter words matching S _ A L _?

- S B A L _  – none
- S D A L _  – none
- S F A L _  – none
- S G A L _  – none
- S H A L _  – “SHALY”
- S M A L _  – “SMALT” (T eliminated)
- S W A L _  – none

Thus, “SHALY” is the only valid option left.

But wait – let’s recall the exact feedback: in Guess 4 (SPALL) the L in position 5 was marked “-”, which means L is in the word but not in position 5. This does not eliminate the possibility of another L, but it’s more likely the word has only one L placed at position 4.

Given that, and no other common 5-letter words fitting S _ A L _, the correct word must be “SHALY”.

However, “SHALY” is a valid 5-letter word (an algae or a variant spelling of shale). Given the constraints, this seems to be the only possible word left.

But let’s consider another angle: the feedback in Guess 4 shows the second L (position 5) is in the word but wrong position, implying the word has two L’s: one in position 4 (confirmed ✓) and another somewhere else. But position 5 is excluded for the second L, and positions 1,3 are already S and A. Thus the second L would have to be in position 2, but in Guess 3 (SLACK) the L in position 2 was marked “-”, meaning L is in the word but not in position 2. This creates a contradiction, implying the word has only one L at position 4.

Therefore, the pattern is definitely S _ A L _ with only one L at position 4. The only common 5-letter word fitting this is “SHALY”.

But let’s check if “SHALY” uses any eliminated letters: H and Y are not in the eliminated list (R,O,E,T,I,N,C,K,P). Thus, “SHALY” is valid.

However, another possible word is “SWALE” – but E is eliminated. 

After careful consideration, the only valid 5-letter word left is “SHALY”.

But wait – let’s list all remaining allowed letters for positions 2 and 5:

Allowed letters (not eliminated): B, D, F, G, H, J, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Possible words:
- S B A L _  – SBAL_ – none
- S D A L _  – SDAL_ – none
- S F A L _  – SFAL_ – none
- S G A L _  – SGAL_ – none
- S H A L _  – SHALY
- S M A L _  – SMALT (T eliminated)
- S W A L _  – SWAL_ – none
- S B A L _  – none
- S H A L _  – SHALY is the only one.

Thus, the correct word must be “SHALY”.

But let’s check another possibility: “SHAL” + a letter. The only 5-letter word is “SHALY”.

Therefore, the next guess is “SHALY”.

However, to be absolutely certain, let’s consider if there’s another word: “SUAL_” – no. 

After exhaustive check, “SHALY” is the only possible word left.

But wait – let’s recall that in Guess 4 (SPALL) the feedback was:
S(✓) P(x) A(✓) L(✓) L(-)

This means:
- Position 1: S ✓
- Position 3: A ✓
- Position 4: L ✓
- Position 5: L is in the word but not in position 5 (so L must be in position 2, but position 2 is currently empty in the pattern S _ A L _). This implies the word has two L’s: one in position 4 and another in position 2.

But in Guess 3 (SLACK) the L in position 2 was marked “-”, meaning L is in the word but not in position 2. This is a contradiction because the feedback now says L is in position 5 but wrong, implying L must be in position 2, which was already marked as wrong.

This suggests the word has only one L at position 4, and the second L in position 5 was marked “-” to indicate that L is not in position 5 (it’s already correctly placed at 4). Thus, the pattern remains S _ A L _ with only one L at position 4.

Given that, the only common 5-letter word left is “SHALY”.

But let’s check another angle: the word might be “SWALE” – but E is eliminated. 

After careful re-evaluation, the only possible word left is “SHALY”.

Therefore, the next guess is:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that has common letters and can help us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word, helping us narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not fourth).
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters not in the word: R, O, E
- Letters in the word but misplaced: A, S
- A cannot be in position 1, S cannot be in position 4.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and S.
2. Does not contain R, O, or E.
3. Places A somewhere other than position 1.
4. Places S somewhere other than position 4.

Let’s try a word like “STAIN”:
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since it was only excluded from position 4).
- T is a new consonant.
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since it was only excluded from position 1).
- I is a new vowel.
- N is a new consonant.

This seems like a good second guess to test new letters while incorporating the known letters A and S.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: R, O, E, T, I, N  
2. Letters that ARE in the word and their correct positions:
   - S is in position 1 (✓)
   - A is in position 3 (✓)

So the pattern so far is:
S _ A _ _

We still need to fill positions 2 and 5 with letters that have not been ruled out.  
Available letters (English alphabet minus the six eliminated):  
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We want a common English word that fits S _ A _ _.  
Possible candidates:  
- SCAMP  
- SALAD  
- SAMBA  
- SCARF (but R is out)  
- SHADE (but D and E: E is out)  
- SPASM (but M is allowed)  
- SLACK  
- SWAMP  

Among these, “SLACK” uses common letters and hasn’t used any eliminated letters.  
Let’s go with SLACK.

Current knowledge:

- Pattern: S _ A _ _  (S and A locked in positions 1 and 3)
- Letters known to be in the word:
  – S (position 1)
  – A (position 3)
- Letters known NOT in the word: R, O, E, T, I, N, C, K
- From Guess 3 we also learned: L is in the word but NOT in position 2.

So the word looks like: S _ A _ _ and must contain L somewhere (but not in position 2).

Possible positions for L: 4 or 5.

Let’s list common English words that fit S _ A _ _ and contain L in position 4 or 5:

- S L A B _  → SLAB_ – but we need 5 letters, so SLABS? (plural of slab) – but B and S are allowed.
- S L A P _  → SLAP_ – SLAPS (plural of slap) – but P and S are allowed.
- S L A M _  → SLAM_ – SLAMS (plural of slam) – M is allowed.
- S P A L _  → SPAL_ – SPALD? Not common.
- S H A L _  → SHAL_ – SHALM? Not a word.
- S W A L _  → SWAL_ – SWAL_ doesn’t yield common words.
- S P A L L  – SPALL (a real word meaning a flat surface or a legal term).

Among these, SPALL is a valid 5-letter word that fits the pattern S _ A _ _ and places L in position 4, which is allowed since L was only marked as “wrong position” in SLACK (it was in position 2 then, so position 4 is new).

Let’s try SPALL.

We now have four pieces of feedback.

1. Letters known NOT in the word:
   R, O, E, T, I, N, C, K, P

2. Fixed positions:
   - Position 1: S ✓
   - Position 3: A ✓
   - Position 4: L ✓

3. From Guess 4 (SPALL):
   - L in position 5 is in the word but NOT in position 5 (so L must be in position 2 or 4)
   - However, position 4 is already locked as L from Guess 3 (SLACK: L in position 2 was marked “-”, so position 4 is correct for L).

Therefore, the pattern is:
S _ A L _

Letters still allowed (not yet eliminated):
B, D, F, G, H, J, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a common 5-letter word that starts with S, has A in position 3, and L in position 4. The only common English word fitting this exact pattern is:

S H A L _  → “SHAL_” – but we need a 5-letter word.  
“SHAL” is 4 letters, so we need a 5-letter word starting with S, A in 3rd, L in 4th.

Checking possibilities:
- S B A L _  → SBAL_ – no common word
- S D A L _  → SDAL_ – no
- S F A L _  → SFAL_ – no
- S G A L _  → SGAL_ – no
- S H A L _  → SHAL_ – needs 5 letters, so “SHAL” + another letter. “SHALY” is 5 letters but uncommon.
- S M A L _  → SMAL_ – SMALT (a type of glass) – but SMALT is 5 letters and fits S M A L T, but T is already eliminated.
- S W A L _  → SWAL_ – SWAL_ doesn’t yield 5-letter words.

Wait, let’s re-examine the pattern: S _ A L _ (positions 1,3,4 fixed). The only common English word fitting this is:

S H A L _  → “SHAL_” – but we need a 5-letter word. Actually, “SHAL” is 4 letters, so we need a 5-letter word starting with S, A in 3rd, L in 4th. The only common word is:

“SHAL” + a letter, but none fit except “SHALY” (a type of algae) – but it’s uncommon. 

However, another possibility is “SWALE” – but E is eliminated. 

Wait, let’s list all 5-letter words matching S _ A L _:

- S B A L _  – none
- S D A L _  – none
- S F A L _  – none
- S G A L _  – none
- S H A L _  – “SHALY” (valid but uncommon)
- S M A L _  – “SMALT” (valid, but T is eliminated from earlier feedback)
- S W A L _  – “SWAL_” – no common word

But looking back at the feedback, in Guess 4 (SPALL) the second L in position 5 was marked “-” (in word, wrong position). This implies the word has only one L, and it’s already placed at position 4. So the pattern is definitely S _ A L _.

Given that, the only common 5-letter word matching S _ A L _ is “SHALY” (though uncommon) or “SMALT” (but T is eliminated). 

However, recalling the feedback: in Guess 3 (SLACK) the L in position 2 was marked “-”, meaning L is in the word but not in position 2. In Guess 4 (SPALL) the L in position 5 was marked “-”, meaning L is in the word but not in position 5. This confirms L must be in position 4 (since positions 2 and 5 are excluded for L, and position 4 is the only remaining slot for L in the pattern S _ A _ _).

Thus, the word must be S _ A L _. The only common 5-letter word fitting this is “SHALY” (though it’s a type of algae), but since we’re limited to valid English words, and no other common words fit, we must accept “SHALY”.

But let’s double-check: are there any other 5-letter words matching S _ A L _?

- S B A L _  – none
- S D A L _  – none
- S F A L _  – none
- S G A L _  – none
- S H A L _  – “SHALY”
- S M A L _  – “SMALT” (T eliminated)
- S W A L _  – none

Thus, “SHALY” is the only valid option left.

But wait – let’s recall the exact feedback: in Guess 4 (SPALL) the L in position 5 was marked “-”, which means L is in the word but not in position 5. This does not eliminate the possibility of another L, but it’s more likely the word has only one L placed at position 4.

Given that, and no other common 5-letter words fitting S _ A L _, the correct word must be “SHALY”.

This creates a contradiction, implying the word has only one L at position 4.

But let’s check if “SHALY” uses any eliminated letters: H and Y are not in the eliminated list (R,O,E,T,I,N,C,K,P). Thus, “SHALY” is valid.

However, another possible word is “SWALE” – but E is eliminated. 

After careful consideration, the only valid 5-letter word left is “SHALY”.

But wait – let’s list all remaining allowed letters for positions 2 and 5:

Allowed letters (not eliminated): B, D, F, G, H, J, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Possible words:
- S B A L _  – SBAL_ – none

- S H A L _  – SHALY
- S M A L _  – SMALT (T eliminated)
- S W A L _  – SWAL_ – none
- S B A L _  – none
- S H A L _  – SHALY is the only one.

Thus, the correct word must be “SHALY”.

But let’s check another possibility: “SHAL” + a letter. The only 5-letter word is “SHALY”.

Therefore, the next guess is “SHALY”.

However, to be absolutely certain, let’s consider if there’s another word: “SUAL_” – no. 

After exhaustive check, “SHALY” is the only possible word left.

But wait – let’s recall that in Guess 4 (SPALL) the feedback was:

This means:
- Position 1: S ✓
- Position 3: A ✓
- Position 4: L ✓
- Position 5: L is in the word but not in position 5 (so L must be in position 2, but position 2 is currently empty in the pattern S _ A L _). This implies the word has two L’s: one in position 4 and another in position 2.

But in Guess 3 (SLACK) the L in position 2 was marked “-”, meaning L is in the word but not in position 2. This is a contradiction because the feedback now says L is in position 5 but wrong, implying L must be in position 2, which was already marked as wrong.

From Guess 4 (SPALL):\n   - L in position 5 is in the word but NOT in position 5 (so L must be in position 2 or 4)\n   - However, position 4 is already locked as L from Guess 3 (SLACK: L in position 2 was marked “-”, so position 4 is correct for L).\n\nTherefore, the pattern is:\nS _ A L _\n\nLetters still allowed (not yet eliminated):\nB, D, F, G, H, J, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nWe need a common 5-letter word that starts with S, has A in position 3, and L in position 4. The only common English word fitting this exact pattern is:\n\nS H A L _  → “SHAL_” – but we need a 5-letter word.  \n“SHAL” is 4 letters, so we need a 5-letter word starting with S, A in 3rd, L in 4th.\n\nChecking possibilities:\n- S B A L _  → SBAL_ – no common word\n- S D A L _  → SDAL_ – no\n- S F A L _  → SFAL_ – no\n- S G A L _  → SGAL_ – no\n- S H A L _  → SHAL_ – needs 5 letters, so “SHAL” + another letter. “SHALY” is 5 letters but uncommon.\n- S M A L _  → SMAL_ – SMALT (a type of glass) – but SMALT is 5 letters and fits S M A L T, but T is already eliminated.\n- S W A L _  → SWAL_ – SWAL_ doesn’t yield 5-letter words.\n\nWait, let’s re-examine the pattern: S _ A L _ (positions 1,3,4 fixed). The only common English word fitting this is:\n\nS H A L _  → “SHAL_” – but we need a 5-letter word. Actually, “SHAL” is 4 letters, so we need a 5-letter word starting with S, A in 3rd, L in 4th. The only common word is:\n\n“SHAL” + a letter, but none fit except “SHALY” (a type of algae) – but it’s uncommon. \n\nHowever, another possibility is “SWALE” – but E is eliminated. \n\nWait, let’s list all 5-letter words matching S _ A L _:\n\n- S B A L _  – none\n- S D A L _  – none\n- S F A L _  – none\n- S G A L _  – none\n- S H A L _  – “SHALY” (valid but uncommon)\n- S M A L _  – “SMALT” (valid, but T is eliminated from earlier feedback)\n- S W A L _  – “SWAL_” – no common word\n\nBut looking back at the feedback, in Guess 4 (SPALL) the second L in position 5 was marked “-” (in word, wrong position). This implies the word has only one L, and it’s already placed at position 4. So the pattern is definitely S _ A L _.\n\nGiven that, the only common 5-letter word matching S _ A L _ is “SHALY” (though uncommon) or “SMALT” (but T is eliminated). \n\nHowever, recalling the feedback: in Guess 3 (SLACK) the L in position 2 was marked “-”, meaning L is in the word but not in position 2. In Guess 4 (SPALL) the L in position 5 was marked “-”, meaning L is in the word but not in position 5. This confirms L must be in position 4 (since positions 2 and 5 are excluded for L, and position 4 is the only remaining slot for L in the pattern S _ A _ _).\n\nThus, the word must be S _ A L _. The only common 5-letter word fitting this is “SHALY” (though it’s a type of algae), but since we’re limited to valid English words, and no other common words fit, we must accept “SHALY”.\n\nBut let’s double-check: are there any other 5-letter words matching S _ A L _?\n\n- S B A L _  – none\n- S D A L _  – none\n- S F A L _  – none\n- S G A L _  – none\n- S H A L _  – “SHALY”\n- S M A L _  – “SMALT” (T eliminated)\n- S W A L _  – none\n\nThus, “SHALY” is the only valid option left.\n\nBut wait – let’s recall the exact feedback: in Guess 4 (SPALL) the L in position 5 was marked “-”, which means L is in the word but not in position 5. This does not eliminate the possibility of another L, but it’s more likely the word has only one L placed at position 4.\n\nGiven that, and no other common 5-letter words fitting S _ A L _, the correct word must be “SHALY”.\n\nHowever, “SHALY” is a valid 5-letter word (an algae or a variant spelling of shale). Given the constraints, this seems to be the only possible word left.\n\nBut let’s consider another angle: the feedback in Guess 4 shows the second L (position 5) is in the word but wrong position, implying the word has two L’s: one in position 4 (confirmed ✓) and another somewhere else. But position 5 is excluded for the second L, and positions 1,3 are already S and A. Thus the second L would have to be in position 2, but in Guess 3 (SLACK) the L in position 2 was marked “-”, meaning L is in the word but not in position 2. This creates a contradiction, implying the word has only one L at position 4.\n\nTherefore, the pattern is definitely S _ A L _ with only one L at position 4. The only common 5-letter word fitting this is “SHALY”.\n\nBut let’s check if “SHALY” uses any eliminated letters: H and Y are not in the eliminated list (R,O,E,T,I,N,C,K,P). Thus, “SHALY” is valid.\n\nHowever, another possible word is “SWALE” – but E is eliminated. \n\nAfter careful consideration, the only valid 5-letter word left is “SHALY”.\n\nBut wait – let’s list all remaining allowed letters for positions 2 and 5:\n\nAllowed letters (not eliminated): B, D, F, G, H, J, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nPossible words:\n- S B A L _  – SBAL_ – none\n- S D A L _  – SDAL_ – none\n- S F A L _  – SFAL_ – none\n- S G A L _  – SGAL_ – none\n- S H A L _  – SHALY\n- S M A L _  – SMALT (T eliminated)\n- S W A L _  – SWAL_ – none\n- S B A L _  – none\n- S H A L _  – SHALY is the only one.\n\nThus, the correct word must be “SHALY”.\n\nBut let’s check another possibility: “SHAL” + a letter. The only 5-letter word is “SHALY”.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is “SHALY”.\n\nHowever, to be absolutely certain, let’s consider if there’s another word: “SUAL_” – no. \n\nAfter exhaustive check, “SHALY” is the only possible word left.\n\nBut wait – let’s recall that in Guess 4 (SPALL) the feedback was:\nS(✓) P(x) A(✓) L(✓) L(-)\n\nThis means:\n- Position 1: S ✓\n- Position 3: A ✓\n- Position 4: L ✓\n- Position 5: L is in the word but not in position 5 (so L must be in position 2, but position 2 is currently empty in the pattern S _ A L _). This implies the word has two L’s: one in position 4 and another in position 2.\n\nBut in Guess 3 (SLACK) the L in position 2 was marked “-”, meaning L is in the word but not in position 2. This is a contradiction because the feedback now says L is in position 5 but wrong, implying L must be in position 2, which was already marked as wrong.\n\nThis suggests the word has only one L at position 4, and the second L in position 5 was marked “-” to indicate that L is not in position 5 (it’s already correctly placed at 4). Thus, the pattern remains S _ A L _ with only one L at position 4.\n\nGiven that, the only common 5-letter word left is “SHALY”.\n\nBut let’s check another angle: the word might be “SWALE” – but E is eliminated. \n\nAfter careful re-evaluation, the only possible word left is “SHALY”.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is:\n\n<guess>SHALY</guess>\n\n<guess>SHALY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: STAIN -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) A(✓) I(x) N(x)\nGuess 3: SLACK -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(✓) C(x) K(x)\nGuess 4: SPALL -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) A(✓) L(✓) L(-)\nGuess 5: SHALY -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) A(✓) L(✓) Y(x)\n'}]","<think>
