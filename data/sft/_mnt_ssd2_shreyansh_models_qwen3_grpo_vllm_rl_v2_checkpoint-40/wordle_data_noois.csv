For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting letters include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants (R, S, T, L, N). A good first guess should balance vowels and consonants to test multiple possibilities.

Popular strong starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- ROATE (R, O, A, T, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly effective because:
1. It includes two vowels (A, E) which are very common
2. It has three very common consonants (S, L, T)
3. These letters appear in many 5-letter words
4. It doesn't repeat any letters, maximizing the number of unique letters tested

This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1)
- L, A, T, E are NOT in the word at all

So we know:
1. The word contains an S, but not in the first position.
2. The letters L, A, T, E are eliminated.
3. We still need to test other common consonants and vowels.

Good next candidates should:
- Include S in a different position (2-5)
- Avoid L, A, T, E
- Include other common letters like R, I, N, O, U, C, H, etc.

Possible good guesses:
- SHORN (S in position 1 again - not good, same as SLATE)
- CHINS (S in position 5)
- RINSE (S in position 5)
- SOUND (S in position 1 - not good)
- CRISP (S in position 5)
- BRISK (S in position 4)

""BRISK"" seems good because:
- S is in position 4 (different from position 1)
- Uses B, R, I, K which are common letters

Let’s summarize what we now know after three guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
L, A, T, E, B, R, K, H

Letters that ARE in the word, with their current positional constraints:
- S – must be in the word, and it is confirmed in position 5 (✓).
- I – must be in the word, but not in positions 2 or 3.
- N – must be in the word, but not in position 4.

So the word looks like: _ _ _ _ S  
and must contain both I and N somewhere among the first four letters, with:
- I not in positions 2 or 3 → I can only be in 1 or 4.
- N not in position 4 → N can be in 1, 2, or 3.

Also, we have not yet tested the letters C, D, F, G, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep S fixed in position 5.
2. Place I in position 1 (to test that spot) and N in one of its allowed spots.
3. Use only untested letters for the remaining slots.

Candidate patterns:
- I N _ _ S  (but N can’t be in 4, and we’d need two more letters)
- I _ N _ S
- I _ _ N S  (but N can’t be in 4, so this is invalid)
- _ I N _ S  (but I can’t be in 2, so invalid)
- _ N I _ S
- _ N _ I S  (but I can’t be in 3, so invalid)

The most promising pattern is I _ N _ S, which uses positions 1, 3, and 4 for I, N, and one more letter. We need a common consonant for position 2.

Let’s pick C (common and untested) and form the word “ICONS”.

Check:
- S is fixed in 5 (✓).
- I is in 1 (allowed).
- N is in 3 (allowed).
- C and O are new letters.

This seems optimal.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting letters include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants (R, S, T, L, N). A good first guess should balance vowels and consonants to test multiple possibilities.

Popular strong starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- ROATE (R, O, A, T, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly effective because:
1. It includes two vowels (A, E) which are very common
2. It has three very common consonants (S, L, T)
3. These letters appear in many 5-letter words
4. It doesn't repeat any letters, maximizing the number of unique letters tested

This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1)
- L, A, T, E are NOT in the word at all

So we know:
1. The word contains an S, but not in the first position.
2. The letters L, A, T, E are eliminated.
3. We still need to test other common consonants and vowels.

Good next candidates should:
- Include S in a different position (2-5)
- Avoid L, A, T, E
- Include other common letters like R, I, N, O, U, C, H, etc.

Possible good guesses:
- SHORN (S in position 1 again - not good, same as SLATE)
- CHINS (S in position 5)
- RINSE (S in position 5)
- SOUND (S in position 1 - not good)
- CRISP (S in position 5)
- BRISK (S in position 4)

""BRISK"" seems good because:
- S is in position 4 (different from position 1)
- Uses B, R, I, K which are common letters
- Avoids L, A, T, E
- Good mix of consonants and vowels

   - I is in the word, but NOT in position 3.  

So the remaining letters to test are among the unused common ones: C, D, F, G, H, M, N, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.  
We need a word that:
- Contains S and I in new positions (S ≠ 1,4; I ≠ 3).  
- Uses only letters from the “still possible” set.  

A quick scan of common patterns suggests “SHINS” or “CHINS” or “DINOS”.  
- “SHINS” places S in position 5 and I in position 2; both placements are allowed.

Let’s extract every constraint we have so far.

Letters NOT in the word:
L, A, T, E, B, R, K, H, C

Letters that ARE in the word, with their positions known or restricted:
- S – confirmed in position 5 (✓)
- I – must be in the word, but NOT positions 1, 2, 3 → only possible position left is 4.
- N – must be in the word, but NOT positions 3, 4 → possible positions 1 or 2.
- O – confirmed in position 3 (✓)

So the word structure is:
[1] [2] O [4] S
with:
- I must go in position 4 (only spot left for I)
- N must go in position 1 or 2
- Positions 1 and 2 must be filled from the remaining untested letters: D, F, G, M, P, U, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends in OS (positions 3 and 5 fixed as O and S)
- Has I in position 4
- Has N in position 1 or 2
- Uses only untested letters in the remaining slot

Possible patterns:
N _ O I S  or  _ N O I S

Looking for common English words:
- N O I S is not valid
- D O I S N’t
- G O I S N’t
- M O I S N’t
- P O I S N’t
- F O I S N’t
- V O I S N’t
- W O I S N’t
- Y O I S N’t

Wait – the pattern is really:
[1 or 2] [remaining] O I S

Testing N in position 1:
N _ O I S → N O I S needs a letter in position 2. The only letter we haven’t used and that makes a word is D → N D O I S? Not a word.
N U O I S? Not a word.
N G O I S? Not a word.

Testing N in position 2:
_ N O I S → The first letter must be a consonant we haven’t used. Common ones:
D → D N O I S? Not a word.
F → F N O I S? Not a word.
G → G N O I S? Not a word.
M → M N O I S? Not a word.
P → P N O I S? Not a word.
V → V N O I S? Not a word.
W → W N O I S? Not a word.
Y → Y N O I S? Not a word.

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid English words. Let me reconsider – perhaps I missed another possibility.

Wait, the word must be:
[1 or 2] [remaining] O I S

Looking at valid 5-letter English words ending in “OIS” with N in position 1 or 2:
- N O I S is 4 letters
- Actually, we need a 5-letter word with structure:
  - Position 3: O
  - Position 4: I
  - Position 5: S
  - Position 1 or 2: N
  - The other position must be filled by an untested letter.

Let’s list possible combinations:
- N _ O I S → N D O I S? Not a word.
- _ N O I S → D N O I S? Not a word.
- G N O I S? Not a word.
- M N O I S? Not a word.
- P N O I S? Not a word.
- F N O I S? Not a word.
- V N O I S? Not a word.
- W N O I S? Not a word.
- Y N O I S? Not a word.

None of these seem to form valid English words. This suggests that perhaps my assumption about the positions is too restrictive. Let me re-examine the feedback carefully.

Re-examining Guess 4: ICONS → I(-) C(x) O(✓) N(-) S(✓)

- I is in the word but NOT in position 1 → possible positions 2,3,4,5. But:
  - Position 3 is O (✓), position 5 is S (✓), so I must be in 2 or 4.
- N is in the word but NOT in position 4 → possible positions 1,2,3,5. But:
  - Position 3 is O (✓), position 5 is S (✓), so N must be in 1 or 2.
- O is confirmed in position 3 (✓)
- S is confirmed in position 5 (✓)

So the structure is:
[1 or 2] [I or N] O [I or N] S

With:
- I must be in 2 or 4
- N must be in 1 or 2

Possible combinations:
1. N in 1, I in 2: N I O _ S → Need a letter for position 4, but I is already in 2 and S in 5, so N I O _ S → N I O ? S
   Possible letters for position 4: must be untested and fit a word. Common ones: D, F, G, M, P, U, V, W, Y
   N I O D S? Not a word.
   N I O G S? Not a word.
   N I O M S? Not a word.
   N I O P S? Not a word.
   N I O U S? ""NIous"" – no.
   N I O V S? No.
   N I O W S? No.

This seems problematic – none of these combinations form valid English words. This suggests that perhaps there’s an error in my interpretation.

Wait – let me check the feedback again carefully:
Guess 4: ICONS → I(-) C(x) O(✓) N(-) S(✓)

- I is in the word but NOT in position 1
- C is NOT in the word
- O is in position 3 (✓)
- N is in the word but NOT in position 4
- S is in position 5 (✓)

So the word must be:
- 5 letters
- Ends in OS (positions 3 and 5)
- Contains I and N
- I not in position 1
- N not in position 4
- No C, L, A, T, E, B, R, K, H

Possible positions:
1 2 3 4 5
? ? O ? S

With I and N to place in positions 1,2,4, but:
- I not in 1 → I in 2 or 4
- N not in 4 → N in 1,2,3,5. But 3 is O, 5 is S → N in 1 or 2

So possible:
Case 1: N in 1, I in 2: N I O _ S → Need a letter for position 4, but I is in 2 and S in 5, so N I O ? S
   Possible letters: D, F, G, M, P, U, V, W, Y
   N I O D S? Not a word.
   N I O G S? Not a word.
   N I O M S? Not a word.

   V N O I S? Not a word.
   W N O I S? Not a word.
   Y N O I S? Not a word.

This seems impossible. However, there is actually one valid word that fits all constraints: “NOISY”.

Let me check:
- N in position 1: allowed (N not restricted to 2,3,4,5)
- O in position 3: ✓
- I in position 4: allowed (I not restricted to 2,3,5)
- S in position 5: ✓
- Y is a new letter (not tested before)

“NOISY” is indeed a valid 5-letter English word.

Therefore, the next guess should be NOISY.
</think>

<guess>NOISY</guess>",NOISY,"Let’s extract every constraint we have so far.

Letters NOT in the word:
L, A, T, E, B, R, K, H, C

Letters that ARE in the word, with their positions known or restricted:
- S – confirmed in position 5 (✓)
- I – must be in the word, but NOT positions 1, 2, 3 → only possible position left is 4.
- N – must be in the word, but NOT positions 3, 4 → possible positions 1 or 2.
- O – confirmed in position 3 (✓)

So the word structure is:
[1] [2] O [4] S
with:
- I must go in position 4 (only spot left for I)
- N must go in position 1 or 2
- Positions 1 and 2 must be filled from the remaining untested letters: D, F, G, M, P, U, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends in OS (positions 3 and 5 fixed as O and S)
- Has I in position 4
- Has N in position 1 or 2
- Uses only untested letters in the remaining slot

Possible patterns:
N _ O I S  or  _ N O I S

Looking for common English words:
- N O I S is not valid
- D O I S N’t
- G O I S N’t
- M O I S N’t
- P O I S N’t
- F O I S N’t
- V O I S N’t
- W O I S N’t
- Y O I S N’t

Wait – the pattern is really:
[1 or 2] [remaining] O I S

Testing N in position 1:
N _ O I S → N O I S needs a letter in position 2. The only letter we haven’t used and that makes a word is D → N D O I S? Not a word.
N U O I S? Not a word.
N G O I S? Not a word.

Testing N in position 2:
_ N O I S → The first letter must be a consonant we haven’t used. Common ones:
D → D N O I S? Not a word.
F → F N O I S? Not a word.
G → G N O I S? Not a word.
M → M N O I S? Not a word.
P → P N O I S? Not a word.
V → V N O I S? Not a word.
W → W N O I S? Not a word.
Y → Y N O I S? Not a word.

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid English words. Let me reconsider – perhaps I missed another possibility.

Wait, the word must be:
[1 or 2] [remaining] O I S

Looking at valid 5-letter English words ending in “OIS” with N in position 1 or 2:
- N O I S is 4 letters
- Actually, we need a 5-letter word with structure:
  - Position 3: O
  - Position 4: I
  - Position 5: S
  - Position 1 or 2: N
  - The other position must be filled by an untested letter.

Let’s list possible combinations:
- N _ O I S → N D O I S? Not a word.
- _ N O I S → D N O I S? Not a word.
- G N O I S? Not a word.
- M N O I S? Not a word.
- P N O I S? Not a word.
- F N O I S? Not a word.
- V N O I S? Not a word.
- W N O I S? Not a word.
- Y N O I S? Not a word.

None of these seem to form valid English words. This suggests that perhaps my assumption about the positions is too restrictive. Let me re-examine the feedback carefully.

Re-examining Guess 4: ICONS → I(-) C(x) O(✓) N(-) S(✓)

- I is in the word but NOT in position 1 → possible positions 2,3,4,5. But:
  - Position 3 is O (✓), position 5 is S (✓), so I must be in 2 or 4.
- N is in the word but NOT in position 4 → possible positions 1,2,3,5. But:
  - Position 3 is O (✓), position 5 is S (✓), so N must be in 1 or 2.
- O is confirmed in position 3 (✓)
- S is confirmed in position 5 (✓)

So the structure is:
[1 or 2] [I or N] O [I or N] S

With:
- I must be in 2 or 4
- N must be in 1 or 2

Possible combinations:
1. N in 1, I in 2: N I O _ S → Need a letter for position 4, but I is already in 2 and S in 5, so N I O _ S → N I O ? S
   Possible letters for position 4: must be untested and fit a word. Common ones: D, F, G, M, P, U, V, W, Y

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting letters include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants (R, S, T, L, N). A good first guess should balance vowels and consonants to test multiple possibilities.

Popular strong starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- ROATE (R, O, A, T, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly effective because:
1. It includes two vowels (A, E) which are very common
2. It has three very common consonants (S, L, T)
3. These letters appear in many 5-letter words
4. It doesn't repeat any letters, maximizing the number of unique letters tested

This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1)
- L, A, T, E are NOT in the word at all

So we know:
1. The word contains an S, but not in the first position.
2. The letters L, A, T, E are eliminated.
3. We still need to test other common consonants and vowels.

Good next candidates should:
- Include S in a different position (2-5)
- Avoid L, A, T, E
- Include other common letters like R, I, N, O, U, C, H, etc.

Possible good guesses:
- SHORN (S in position 1 again - not good, same as SLATE)
- CHINS (S in position 5)
- RINSE (S in position 5)
- SOUND (S in position 1 - not good)
- CRISP (S in position 5)
- BRISK (S in position 4)

""BRISK"" seems good because:
- S is in position 4 (different from position 1)
- Uses B, R, I, K which are common letters
- Avoids L, A, T, E
- Good mix of consonants and vowels

From the two previous guesses we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: L, A, T, E, B, R, K  
2. Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions:
   - S is in the word, but NOT in positions 1 or 4.  
   - I is in the word, but NOT in position 3.  

So the remaining letters to test are among the unused common ones: C, D, F, G, H, M, N, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.  
We need a word that:
- Contains S and I in new positions (S ≠ 1,4; I ≠ 3).  
- Uses only letters from the “still possible” set.  

A quick scan of common patterns suggests “SHINS” or “CHINS” or “DINOS”.  
- “SHINS” places S in position 5 and I in position 2; both placements are allowed.  
- It introduces H and N, which are still possible.  

Let’s go with SHINS.

Let’s summarize what we now know after three guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
L, A, T, E, B, R, K, H

Letters that ARE in the word, with their current positional constraints:
- S – must be in the word, and it is confirmed in position 5 (✓).
- I – must be in the word, but not in positions 2 or 3.
- N – must be in the word, but not in position 4.

So the word looks like: _ _ _ _ S  
and must contain both I and N somewhere among the first four letters, with:
- I not in positions 2 or 3 → I can only be in 1 or 4.
- N not in position 4 → N can be in 1, 2, or 3.

Also, we have not yet tested the letters C, D, F, G, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep S fixed in position 5.
2. Place I in position 1 (to test that spot) and N in one of its allowed spots.
3. Use only untested letters for the remaining slots.

Candidate patterns:
- I N _ _ S  (but N can’t be in 4, and we’d need two more letters)
- I _ N _ S
- I _ _ N S  (but N can’t be in 4, so this is invalid)
- _ I N _ S  (but I can’t be in 2, so invalid)
- _ N I _ S
- _ N _ I S  (but I can’t be in 3, so invalid)

The most promising pattern is I _ N _ S, which uses positions 1, 3, and 4 for I, N, and one more letter. We need a common consonant for position 2.

Let’s pick C (common and untested) and form the word “ICONS”.

Check:
- S is fixed in 5 (✓).
- I is in 1 (allowed).
- N is in 3 (allowed).
- C and O are new letters.

This seems optimal.

Let’s extract every constraint we have so far.

Letters NOT in the word:
L, A, T, E, B, R, K, H, C

Letters that ARE in the word, with their positions known or restricted:
- S – confirmed in position 5 (✓)
- I – must be in the word, but NOT positions 1, 2, 3 → only possible position left is 4.
- N – must be in the word, but NOT positions 3, 4 → possible positions 1 or 2.
- O – confirmed in position 3 (✓)

So the word structure is:
[1] [2] O [4] S
with:
- I must go in position 4 (only spot left for I)
- N must go in position 1 or 2
- Positions 1 and 2 must be filled from the remaining untested letters: D, F, G, M, P, U, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends in OS (positions 3 and 5 fixed as O and S)
- Has I in position 4
- Has N in position 1 or 2
- Uses only untested letters in the remaining slot

Possible patterns:
N _ O I S  or  _ N O I S

Looking for common English words:
- N O I S is not valid
- D O I S N’t
- G O I S N’t
- M O I S N’t
- P O I S N’t
- F O I S N’t
- V O I S N’t
- W O I S N’t
- Y O I S N’t

Wait – the pattern is really:
[1 or 2] [remaining] O I S

Testing N in position 1:
N _ O I S → N O I S needs a letter in position 2. The only letter we haven’t used and that makes a word is D → N D O I S? Not a word.
N U O I S? Not a word.
N G O I S? Not a word.

Testing N in position 2:
_ N O I S → The first letter must be a consonant we haven’t used. Common ones:
D → D N O I S? Not a word.
F → F N O I S? Not a word.
G → G N O I S? Not a word.
M → M N O I S? Not a word.
P → P N O I S? Not a word.
V → V N O I S? Not a word.
W → W N O I S? Not a word.
Y → Y N O I S? Not a word.

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid English words. Let me reconsider – perhaps I missed another possibility.

Wait, the word must be:
[1 or 2] [remaining] O I S

Looking at valid 5-letter English words ending in “OIS” with N in position 1 or 2:
- N O I S is 4 letters
- Actually, we need a 5-letter word with structure:
  - Position 3: O
  - Position 4: I
  - Position 5: S
  - Position 1 or 2: N
  - The other position must be filled by an untested letter.

Let’s list possible combinations:
- N _ O I S → N D O I S? Not a word.
- _ N O I S → D N O I S? Not a word.
- G N O I S? Not a word.
- M N O I S? Not a word.
- P N O I S? Not a word.
- F N O I S? Not a word.
- V N O I S? Not a word.
- W N O I S? Not a word.
- Y N O I S? Not a word.

None of these seem to form valid English words. This suggests that perhaps my assumption about the positions is too restrictive. Let me re-examine the feedback carefully.

Re-examining Guess 4: ICONS → I(-) C(x) O(✓) N(-) S(✓)

- I is in the word but NOT in position 1 → possible positions 2,3,4,5. But:
  - Position 3 is O (✓), position 5 is S (✓), so I must be in 2 or 4.
- N is in the word but NOT in position 4 → possible positions 1,2,3,5. But:
  - Position 3 is O (✓), position 5 is S (✓), so N must be in 1 or 2.
- O is confirmed in position 3 (✓)
- S is confirmed in position 5 (✓)

So the structure is:
[1 or 2] [I or N] O [I or N] S

With:
- I must be in 2 or 4
- N must be in 1 or 2

Possible combinations:
1. N in 1, I in 2: N I O _ S → Need a letter for position 4, but I is already in 2 and S in 5, so N I O _ S → N I O ? S
   Possible letters for position 4: must be untested and fit a word. Common ones: D, F, G, M, P, U, V, W, Y

4. N in 2, I in 2 – impossible, both can’t be in 2.

This seems problematic – none of these combinations form valid English words. This suggests that perhaps there’s an error in my interpretation.

Wait – let me check the feedback again carefully:
Guess 4: ICONS → I(-) C(x) O(✓) N(-) S(✓)

- I is in the word but NOT in position 1
- C is NOT in the word
- O is in position 3 (✓)
- N is in the word but NOT in position 4
- S is in position 5 (✓)

So the word must be:
- 5 letters
- Ends in OS (positions 3 and 5)
- Contains I and N
- I not in position 1
- N not in position 4
- No C, L, A, T, E, B, R, K, H

Possible positions:
1 2 3 4 5
? ? O ? S

With I and N to place in positions 1,2,4, but:
- I not in 1 → I in 2 or 4
- N not in 4 → N in 1,2,3,5. But 3 is O, 5 is S → N in 1 or 2

So possible:
Case 1: N in 1, I in 2: N I O _ S → Need a letter for position 4, but I is in 2 and S in 5, so N I O ? S
   Possible letters: D, F, G, M, P, U, V, W, Y
   N I O D S? Not a word.
   N I O G S? Not a word.
   N I O M S? Not a word.
   N I O P S? Not a word.
   N I O U S? Not a word.
   N I O V S? Not a word.
   N I O W S? Not a word.
   N I O Y S? Not a word.

Case 2: N in 1, I in 4: N _ O I S → N _ O I S
   Need a letter for position 2: D, F, G, M, P, U, V, W, Y
   N D O I S? Not a word.
   N F O I S? Not a word.
   N G O I S? Not a word.
   N M O I S? Not a word.
   N P O I S? Not a word.
   N U O I S? Not a word.
   N V O I S? Not a word.
   N W O I S? Not a word.
   N Y O I S? Not a word.

Case 3: N in 2, I in 4: _ N O I S → _ N O I S
   Need a letter for position 1: D, F, G, M, P, U, V, W, Y
   D N O I S? Not a word.
   F N O I S? Not a word.
   G N O I S? Not a word.
   M N O I S? Not a word.
   P N O I S? Not a word.
   U N O I S? Not a word.
   V N O I S? Not a word.
   W N O I S? Not a word.
   Y N O I S? Not a word.

This seems impossible. However, there is actually one valid word that fits all constraints: “NOISY”.

Let me check:
- N in position 1: allowed (N not restricted to 2,3,4,5)
- O in position 3: ✓
- I in position 4: allowed (I not restricted to 2,3,5)
- S in position 5: ✓
- Y is a new letter (not tested before)

“NOISY” is indeed a valid 5-letter English word.

Therefore, the next guess should be NOISY.
