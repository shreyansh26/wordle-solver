For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common vowel)

Both are strong, but I'll go with ""AROSE"" for its vowel coverage.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we now know:
- Letters not in the word: R, O, S
- Letters in the word but misplaced: A (not 1st), E (not 5th)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and E
2. Does not contain R, O, S
3. Has A not in position 1
4. Has E not in position 5

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, etc.

A word like ""EATEN"" comes to mind:
- E (position 1) - allowed since E is only restricted from position 5
- A (position 2) - allowed (not position 1)
- T (position 3) - allowed
- E (position 4) - allowed
- N (position 5) - allowed

But let's check for better coverage. ""LEANT"" would have:
- L, E, A, N, T - but A is in position 3, E in 2 - both allowed, and no R/O/S. This seems good.

However, ""LEANT"" has A in position 3 (allowed) and E in position 2 (allowed). No R, O, or S. This seems like a strong second guess.

But to maximize information, maybe ""EAGLE"" is better:
- E (position 1) - allowed
- A (position 2) - allowed
- G (position 3) - new letter
- L (position 4) - new letter
- E (position 5) - but E is restricted from position 5, so this would violate the feedback.

Thus, ""LEANT"" is a good choice. Another option is ""EARTH"" but it contains R which we know is not in the word.

After considering, ""LEANT"" seems optimal as it introduces new consonants (L, N, T) while respecting the known constraints.

Guess 2: LEANT

Consolidating what we know:

Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, L, N, T  
Letters that ARE in the word, but whose exact positions are still unknown: A, E  

Constraints on positions:
- A is in the word but NOT in position 1 (from AROSE) and NOT in position 3 (from LEANT).  
- E is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from LEANT) and NOT in position 5 (from AROSE).

So the word must contain both A and E, and the remaining three letters must come from the unused alphabet excluding R, O, S, L, N, T. The remaining common consonants are: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A and E exactly once each.
- Uses three other distinct letters from the allowed set.
- Respects the positional bans above.

Let’s list possible positions for A and E that satisfy the bans:

Possible positions for A (cannot be 1 or 3): 2, 4, 5  
Possible positions for E (cannot be 2 or 5): 1, 3, 4  

We can try to place A and E while filling the remaining slots with new letters.

One promising pattern:  
E _ A _ _  (E in 1, A in 3 — but A cannot be in 3) → invalid  
E _ _ A _ (E in 1, A in 4) → valid  
E _ _ _ A (E in 1, A in 5) → valid  

Another pattern:  
_ E _ _ _ (E in 2 — banned) → invalid  
_ _ E _ _ (E in 3) → valid  
_ _ _ E _ (E in 4) → valid  
_ _ _ _ E (E in 5 — banned) → invalid  

Another pattern:  
A _ E _ _ (A in 1 — banned) → invalid  
_ A E _ _ (A in 2, E in 3) → valid  
_ A _ E _ (A in 2, E in 4) → valid  
_ A _ _ E (A in 2, E in 5 — banned) → invalid  
_ _ A E _ (A in 3 — banned) → invalid  
_ _ A _ E (A in 3 — banned) → invalid  
_ _ _ A E (A in 4, E in 5 — banned) → invalid  
_ _ E A _ (E in 3, A in 4) → valid  
_ _ E _ A (E in 3, A in 5) → valid  
_ _ _ E A (E in 4, A in 5) → valid  

So valid placements of A and E are:
- E in 1, A in 4 or 5  
- A in 2, E in 3 or 4  
- A in 4, E in 3 or 4  
- A in 5, E in 3 or 4  

Let’s pick one of these patterns and fill with new allowed letters.  
For example, let’s try:  
E _ _ A _ (E in 1, A in 4)  
The middle two letters must be from {B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y}.  
A common word fitting this is E M B A R, but R is banned.  
Next: E M B A D → ""EMBAD"" is not a valid English word.  
Try E C H A D → ""ECHAD"" is not valid.  
Try E G G A D → invalid (double G and not a word).  
Try E B B A D → invalid.  

Another pattern: _ A E _ _ (A in 2, E in 3)  
Letters left: _ A E _ _  
Possible word: C A E D Y → invalid.  
B A E D Y → invalid.  
M A E D Y → invalid.  

Another pattern: _ _ E A _ (E in 3, A in 4)  
Letters left: _ _ E A _  
Possible word: P I E A N → invalid.  
B I E A N → invalid.  
M I E A N → invalid.  

Another pattern: _ _ _ E A (E in 4, A in 5)  
Letters left: _ _ _ E A  
Possible word: C H I E A → invalid.  
B H I E A → invalid.  
D I V E A → invalid.  

Another pattern: _ A _ E _ (A in 2, E in 4)  
Letters left: _ A _ E _  
Possible word: M A I E T → invalid.  
B A I E T → invalid.  
P A I E T → invalid.  

Another pattern: _ _ A E _ (A in 3 — banned) → invalid  

Another pattern: _ _ _ A E (A in 4, E in 5 — banned) → invalid  

Another pattern: _ _ E _ A (E in 3, A in 5)  
Letters left: _ _ E _ A  
Possible word: C H E W A → valid English word!  
Letters: C, H, E, W, A — none are banned.  
Positions:  
C (1) — allowed  
H (2) — allowed  
E (3) — allowed (E can be in 3)  
W (4) — allowed  
A (5) — allowed (A can be in 5)  

This satisfies all constraints.  
So the next guess is ""CHEWA"".

Guess 1: AROSE

Constraints on positions:
- A is in the word but NOT in position 1 (from AROSE) and NOT in position 3 (from LEANT).

_ E _ _ _ (E in 2 — banned) → invalid  
_ _ E _ _ (E in 3) → valid  
_ _ _ E _ (E in 4) → valid  
_ _ _ _ E (E in 5 — banned) → invalid  

Another pattern:  
A _ E _ _ (A in 1 — banned) → invalid  
_ A E _ _ (A in 2, E in 3) → valid  
_ A _ E _ (A in 2, E in 4) → valid  
_ A _ _ E (A in 2, E in 5 — banned) → invalid  
_ _ A E _ (A in 3 — banned) → invalid  
_ _ A _ E (A in 3 — banned) → invalid  
_ _ _ A E (A in 4, E in 5 — banned) → invalid

_ _ E _ A (E in 3, A in 5) → valid  
_ _ _ E A (E in 4, A in 5) → valid  

So valid placements of A and E are:
- E in 1, A in 4 or 5  
- A in 2, E in 3 or 4  
- A in 4, E in 3 or 4  
- A in 5, E in 3 or 4  

Let’s pick one of these patterns and fill with new allowed letters.  
For example, let’s try:  
E _ _ A _ (E in 1, A in 4)  
The middle two letters must be from {B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y}.  
A common word fitting this is E M B A R, but R is banned.  
Next: E M B A D → ""EMBAD"" is not a valid English word.  
Try E C H A D → ""ECHAD"" is not valid.  
Try E G G A D → invalid (double G and not a word).  
Try E B B A D → invalid.  

Another pattern: _ A E _ _ (A in 2, E in 3)  
Letters left: _ A E _ _  
Possible word: C A E D Y → invalid.  
B A E D Y → invalid.  
M A E D Y → invalid.  

Another pattern: _ _ E A _ (E in 3, A in 4)  
Letters left: _ _ E A _  
Possible word: P I E A N → invalid.  
B I E A N → invalid.  
M I E A N → invalid.  

Another pattern: _ _ _ E A (E in 4, A in 5)  
Letters left: _ _ _ E A  
Possible word: C H I E A → invalid.  
B H I E A → invalid.  
D I V E A → invalid.  

Another pattern: _ A _ E _ (A in 2, E in 4)  
Letters left: _ A _ E _  
Possible word: M A I E T → invalid.  
B A I E T → invalid.  
P A I E T → invalid.  

Another pattern: _ _ A E _ (A in 3 — banned) → invalid  

Another pattern: _ _ _ A E (A in 4, E in 5 — banned) → invalid  

Another pattern: _ _ E _ A (E in 3, A in 5)  
Letters left: _ _ E _ A  
Possible word: C H E W A → valid English word!  
Letters: C, H, E, W, A — none are banned.  
Positions:  
C (1) — allowed  
H (2) — allowed  
E (3) — allowed (E can be in 3)  
W (4) — allowed  
A (5) — allowed (A can be in 5)  

This satisfies all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common vowel)

Both are strong, but I'll go with ""AROSE"" for its vowel coverage.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we now know:
- Letters not in the word: R, O, S
- Letters in the word but misplaced: A (not 1st), E (not 5th)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and E
2. Does not contain R, O, S
3. Has A not in position 1
4. Has E not in position 5

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, etc.

A word like ""EATEN"" comes to mind:
- E (position 1) - allowed since E is only restricted from position 5
- A (position 2) - allowed (not position 1)
- T (position 3) - allowed
- E (position 4) - allowed
- N (position 5) - allowed

But let's check for better coverage. ""LEANT"" would have:
- L, E, A, N, T - but A is in position 3, E in 2 - both allowed, and no R/O/S. This seems good.

However, ""LEANT"" has A in position 3 (allowed) and E in position 2 (allowed). No R, O, or S. This seems like a strong second guess.

But to maximize information, maybe ""EAGLE"" is better:
- E (position 1) - allowed
- A (position 2) - allowed
- G (position 3) - new letter
- L (position 4) - new letter
- E (position 5) - but E is restricted from position 5, so this would violate the feedback.

Thus, ""LEANT"" is a good choice. Another option is ""EARTH"" but it contains R which we know is not in the word.

After considering, ""LEANT"" seems optimal as it introduces new consonants (L, N, T) while respecting the known constraints.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: LEANT -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we now have:

Guess 1: AROSE  
Feedback: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)

Guess 2: LEANT  
Feedback: L(x) E(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)

Consolidating what we know:

Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, L, N, T  
Letters that ARE in the word, but whose exact positions are still unknown: A, E  

Constraints on positions:
- A is in the word but NOT in position 1 (from AROSE) and NOT in position 3 (from LEANT).  
- E is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from LEANT) and NOT in position 5 (from AROSE).

So the word must contain both A and E, and the remaining three letters must come from the unused alphabet excluding R, O, S, L, N, T. The remaining common consonants are: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A and E exactly once each.
- Uses three other distinct letters from the allowed set.
- Respects the positional bans above.

Let’s list possible positions for A and E that satisfy the bans:

Possible positions for A (cannot be 1 or 3): 2, 4, 5  
Possible positions for E (cannot be 2 or 5): 1, 3, 4  

We can try to place A and E while filling the remaining slots with new letters.

One promising pattern:  
E _ A _ _  (E in 1, A in 3 — but A cannot be in 3) → invalid  
E _ _ A _ (E in 1, A in 4) → valid  
E _ _ _ A (E in 1, A in 5) → valid  

Another pattern:  
_ E _ _ _ (E in 2 — banned) → invalid  
_ _ E _ _ (E in 3) → valid  
_ _ _ E _ (E in 4) → valid  
_ _ _ _ E (E in 5 — banned) → invalid  

Another pattern:  
A _ E _ _ (A in 1 — banned) → invalid  
_ A E _ _ (A in 2, E in 3) → valid  
_ A _ E _ (A in 2, E in 4) → valid  
_ A _ _ E (A in 2, E in 5 — banned) → invalid  
_ _ A E _ (A in 3 — banned) → invalid  
_ _ A _ E (A in 3 — banned) → invalid  
_ _ _ A E (A in 4, E in 5 — banned) → invalid  
_ _ E A _ (E in 3, A in 4) → valid  
_ _ E _ A (E in 3, A in 5) → valid  
_ _ _ E A (E in 4, A in 5) → valid  

So valid placements of A and E are:
- E in 1, A in 4 or 5  
- A in 2, E in 3 or 4  
- A in 4, E in 3 or 4  
- A in 5, E in 3 or 4  

Let’s pick one of these patterns and fill with new allowed letters.  
For example, let’s try:  
E _ _ A _ (E in 1, A in 4)  
The middle two letters must be from {B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y}.  
A common word fitting this is E M B A R, but R is banned.  
Next: E M B A D → ""EMBAD"" is not a valid English word.  
Try E C H A D → ""ECHAD"" is not valid.  
Try E G G A D → invalid (double G and not a word).  
Try E B B A D → invalid.  

Another pattern: _ A E _ _ (A in 2, E in 3)  
Letters left: _ A E _ _  
Possible word: C A E D Y → invalid.  
B A E D Y → invalid.  
M A E D Y → invalid.

Letters left: _ _ E A _  
Possible word: P I E A N → invalid.  
B I E A N → invalid.  
M I E A N → invalid.  

Another pattern: _ _ _ E A (E in 4, A in 5)  
Letters left: _ _ _ E A  
Possible word: C H I E A → invalid.  
B H I E A → invalid.  
D I V E A → invalid.  

Another pattern: _ A _ E _ (A in 2, E in 4)  
Letters left: _ A _ E _  
Possible word: M A I E T → invalid.  
B A I E T → invalid.  
P A I E T → invalid.  

Another pattern: _ _ A E _ (A in 3 — banned) → invalid  

Another pattern: _ _ _ A E (A in 4, E in 5 — banned) → invalid  

Another pattern: _ _ E _ A (E in 3, A in 5)  
Letters left: _ _ E _ A  
Possible word: C H E W A → valid English word!  
Letters: C, H, E, W, A — none are banned.  
Positions:  
C (1) — allowed  
H (2) — allowed  
E (3) — allowed (E can be in 3)  
W (4) — allowed  
A (5) — allowed (A can be in 5)  

This satisfies all constraints.  
So the next guess is ""CHEWA"".

From the three guesses we now have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)

   – R, O, S are not in the word.

2. LEANT → L(x) E(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)  
   – L, N, T are not in the word.  
   – E is not in position 2.  
   – A is not in position 3.

3. CHEWA → C(x) H(x) E(-) W(x) A(-)  
   – C, H, W are not in the word.  
   – E is not in position 3.  
   – A is not in position 5.

Letters we know are in the word: A, E  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: C, H, L, N, O, R, S, T, W  

Positions still unknown for A and E:
- A cannot be in positions 1, 3, 5.  
- E cannot be in positions 2, 3, 5.

So possible positions left:
A can only be in position 2 or 4.  
E can only be in position 1 or 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and E exactly once each.  
- Uses three other letters from the remaining allowed set: {B, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, Y}.  
- Respects the positional bans above.

Let’s list the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, Y.

We can try to place A and E together in position 4, since that’s the only position they have in common.

Pattern: _ _ _ A E  – but E is banned from position 5, so this is invalid.  
Pattern: _ _ A E _ – E in 4, A in 3 – but A is banned from 3.  
Pattern: _ A _ E _ – E in 4, A in 2 – this is valid.  
Pattern: A _ _ _ _ – A banned from 1.  
Pattern: _ _ E _ _ – E in 3 banned.  
Pattern: _ E _ _ _ – E in 2 banned.  
Pattern: _ _ _ E _ – E in 4, but A must be in 2 or 4. If A is in 2, then E is in 4. This works.

So the valid placement is:
- A in position 2  
- E in position 4  

The word structure: _ A _ E _

We need to fill positions 1, 3, 5 with allowed letters.  
Let’s pick common remaining letters: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, Y.

A common word fitting this pattern:  
M A I E D – but D is allowed, and none of the letters are banned.  
Check: M, A, I, E, D – all allowed.  
Positions:  
1=M – allowed  
2=A – allowed (A can be in 2)  
3=I – allowed  
4=E – allowed (E can be in 4)  
5=D – allowed  

This satisfies all constraints.

- A cannot be in positions 1, 3, 5.  
- E cannot be in positions 2, 3, 5.

So possible positions left:
A can only be in position 2 or 4.  
E can only be in position 1 or 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and E exactly once each.  
- Uses three other letters from the remaining allowed set: {B, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, Y}.  
- Respects the positional bans above.

Let’s list the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, Y.

We can try to place A and E together in position 4, since that’s the only position they have in common.

Pattern: _ _ _ A E  – but E is banned from position 5, so this is invalid.  
Pattern: _ _ A E _ – E in 4, A in 3 – but A is banned from 3.  
Pattern: _ A _ E _ – E in 4, A in 2 – this is valid.  
Pattern: A _ _ _ _ – A banned from 1.  
Pattern: _ _ E _ _ – E in 3 banned.  
Pattern: _ E _ _ _ – E in 2 banned.  
Pattern: _ _ _ E _ – E in 4, but A must be in 2 or 4. If A is in 2, then E is in 4. This works.

So the valid placement is:
- A in position 2  
- E in position 4  

The word structure: _ A _ E _

We need to fill positions 1, 3, 5 with allowed letters.  
Let’s pick common remaining letters: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, Y.

A common word fitting this pattern:  
M A I E D – but D is allowed, and none of the letters are banned.  
Check: M, A, I, E, D – all allowed.  
Positions:  
1=M – allowed  
2=A – allowed (A can be in 2)  
3=I – allowed  
4=E – allowed (E can be in 4)  
5=D – allowed  

This satisfies all constraints.",Guess 4: MAIED -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(✓) I(x) E(✓) D(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common vowel)

Both are strong, but I'll go with ""AROSE"" for its vowel coverage.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we now know:
- Letters not in the word: R, O, S
- Letters in the word but misplaced: A (not 1st), E (not 5th)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and E
2. Does not contain R, O, S
3. Has A not in position 1
4. Has E not in position 5

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, etc.

A word like ""EATEN"" comes to mind:
- E (position 1) - allowed since E is only restricted from position 5
- A (position 2) - allowed (not position 1)
- T (position 3) - allowed
- E (position 4) - allowed
- N (position 5) - allowed

But let's check for better coverage. ""LEANT"" would have:
- L, E, A, N, T - but A is in position 3, E in 2 - both allowed, and no R/O/S. This seems good.

However, ""LEANT"" has A in position 3 (allowed) and E in position 2 (allowed). No R, O, or S. This seems like a strong second guess.

But to maximize information, maybe ""EAGLE"" is better:
- E (position 1) - allowed
- A (position 2) - allowed
- G (position 3) - new letter
- L (position 4) - new letter
- E (position 5) - but E is restricted from position 5, so this would violate the feedback.

Thus, ""LEANT"" is a good choice. Another option is ""EARTH"" but it contains R which we know is not in the word.

After considering, ""LEANT"" seems optimal as it introduces new consonants (L, N, T) while respecting the known constraints.

Guess 2: LEANT -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we now have:

Guess 1: AROSE  
Feedback: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)

Guess 2: LEANT  
Feedback: L(x) E(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)

Consolidating what we know:

Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, L, N, T  
Letters that ARE in the word, but whose exact positions are still unknown: A, E  

Constraints on positions:
- A is in the word but NOT in position 1 (from AROSE) and NOT in position 3 (from LEANT).  
- E is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from LEANT) and NOT in position 5 (from AROSE).

So the word must contain both A and E, and the remaining three letters must come from the unused alphabet excluding R, O, S, L, N, T. The remaining common consonants are: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A and E exactly once each.
- Uses three other distinct letters from the allowed set.
- Respects the positional bans above.

Let’s list possible positions for A and E that satisfy the bans:

Possible positions for A (cannot be 1 or 3): 2, 4, 5  
Possible positions for E (cannot be 2 or 5): 1, 3, 4  

We can try to place A and E while filling the remaining slots with new letters.

One promising pattern:  
E _ A _ _  (E in 1, A in 3 — but A cannot be in 3) → invalid  
E _ _ A _ (E in 1, A in 4) → valid  
E _ _ _ A (E in 1, A in 5) → valid  

Another pattern:  
_ E _ _ _ (E in 2 — banned) → invalid  
_ _ E _ _ (E in 3) → valid  
_ _ _ E _ (E in 4) → valid  
_ _ _ _ E (E in 5 — banned) → invalid  

Another pattern:  
A _ E _ _ (A in 1 — banned) → invalid  
_ A E _ _ (A in 2, E in 3) → valid  
_ A _ E _ (A in 2, E in 4) → valid  
_ A _ _ E (A in 2, E in 5 — banned) → invalid  
_ _ A E _ (A in 3 — banned) → invalid  
_ _ A _ E (A in 3 — banned) → invalid  
_ _ _ A E (A in 4, E in 5 — banned) → invalid  
_ _ E A _ (E in 3, A in 4) → valid  
_ _ E _ A (E in 3, A in 5) → valid  
_ _ _ E A (E in 4, A in 5) → valid  

So valid placements of A and E are:
- E in 1, A in 4 or 5  
- A in 2, E in 3 or 4  
- A in 4, E in 3 or 4  
- A in 5, E in 3 or 4  

Let’s pick one of these patterns and fill with new allowed letters.  
For example, let’s try:  
E _ _ A _ (E in 1, A in 4)  
The middle two letters must be from {B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y}.  
A common word fitting this is E M B A R, but R is banned.  
Next: E M B A D → ""EMBAD"" is not a valid English word.  
Try E C H A D → ""ECHAD"" is not valid.  
Try E G G A D → invalid (double G and not a word).  
Try E B B A D → invalid.  

Another pattern: _ A E _ _ (A in 2, E in 3)  
Letters left: _ A E _ _  
Possible word: C A E D Y → invalid.  
B A E D Y → invalid.  
M A E D Y → invalid.  

Another pattern: _ _ E A _ (E in 3, A in 4)  
Letters left: _ _ E A _  
Possible word: P I E A N → invalid.  
B I E A N → invalid.  
M I E A N → invalid.  

Another pattern: _ _ _ E A (E in 4, A in 5)  
Letters left: _ _ _ E A  
Possible word: C H I E A → invalid.  
B H I E A → invalid.  
D I V E A → invalid.  

Another pattern: _ A _ E _ (A in 2, E in 4)  
Letters left: _ A _ E _  
Possible word: M A I E T → invalid.  
B A I E T → invalid.  
P A I E T → invalid.  

Another pattern: _ _ A E _ (A in 3 — banned) → invalid  

Another pattern: _ _ _ A E (A in 4, E in 5 — banned) → invalid  

Another pattern: _ _ E _ A (E in 3, A in 5)  
Letters left: _ _ E _ A  
Possible word: C H E W A → valid English word!  
Letters: C, H, E, W, A — none are banned.  
Positions:  
C (1) — allowed  
H (2) — allowed  
E (3) — allowed (E can be in 3)  
W (4) — allowed  
A (5) — allowed (A can be in 5)  

This satisfies all constraints.  
So the next guess is ""CHEWA"".

From the three guesses we now have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)  
   – A, E are in the word but misplaced.  
   – R, O, S are not in the word.

2. LEANT → L(x) E(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)  
   – L, N, T are not in the word.  
   – E is not in position 2.  
   – A is not in position 3.

3. CHEWA → C(x) H(x) E(-) W(x) A(-)  
   – C, H, W are not in the word.  
   – E is not in position 3.  
   – A is not in position 5.

Letters we know are in the word: A, E  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: C, H, L, N, O, R, S, T, W  

Positions still unknown for A and E:
- A cannot be in positions 1, 3, 5.  
- E cannot be in positions 2, 3, 5.

So possible positions left:
A can only be in position 2 or 4.  
E can only be in position 1 or 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and E exactly once each.  
- Uses three other letters from the remaining allowed set: {B, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, Y}.  
- Respects the positional bans above.

Let’s list the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, Y.

We can try to place A and E together in position 4, since that’s the only position they have in common.

Pattern: _ _ _ A E  – but E is banned from position 5, so this is invalid.  
Pattern: _ _ A E _ – E in 4, A in 3 – but A is banned from 3.  
Pattern: _ A _ E _ – E in 4, A in 2 – this is valid.  
Pattern: A _ _ _ _ – A banned from 1.  
Pattern: _ _ E _ _ – E in 3 banned.  
Pattern: _ E _ _ _ – E in 2 banned.  
Pattern: _ _ _ E _ – E in 4, but A must be in 2 or 4. If A is in 2, then E is in 4. This works.

So the valid placement is:
- A in position 2  
- E in position 4  

The word structure: _ A _ E _

We need to fill positions 1, 3, 5 with allowed letters.  
Let’s pick common remaining letters: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, Y.

A common word fitting this pattern:  
M A I E D – but D is allowed, and none of the letters are banned.  
Check: M, A, I, E, D – all allowed.  
Positions:  
1=M – allowed  
2=A – allowed (A can be in 2)  
3=I – allowed  
4=E – allowed (E can be in 4)  
5=D – allowed  

This satisfies all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common vowel)

Both are strong, but I'll go with ""AROSE"" for its vowel coverage.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we now know:
- Letters not in the word: R, O, S
- Letters in the word but misplaced: A (not 1st), E (not 5th)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and E
2. Does not contain R, O, S
3. Has A not in position 1
4. Has E not in position 5

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, etc.

A word like ""EATEN"" comes to mind:
- E (position 1) - allowed since E is only restricted from position 5
- A (position 2) - allowed (not position 1)
- T (position 3) - allowed
- E (position 4) - allowed
- N (position 5) - allowed

But let's check for better coverage. ""LEANT"" would have:
- L, E, A, N, T - but A is in position 3, E in 2 - both allowed, and no R/O/S. This seems good.

However, ""LEANT"" has A in position 3 (allowed) and E in position 2 (allowed). No R, O, or S. This seems like a strong second guess.

But to maximize information, maybe ""EAGLE"" is better:
- E (position 1) - allowed
- A (position 2) - allowed
- G (position 3) - new letter
- L (position 4) - new letter
- E (position 5) - but E is restricted from position 5, so this would violate the feedback.

Thus, ""LEANT"" is a good choice. Another option is ""EARTH"" but it contains R which we know is not in the word.

After considering, ""LEANT"" seems optimal as it introduces new consonants (L, N, T) while respecting the known constraints.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: LEANT -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we now have:

Guess 1: AROSE  
Feedback: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)

Guess 2: LEANT  
Feedback: L(x) E(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)

Consolidating what we know:

Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, L, N, T  
Letters that ARE in the word, but whose exact positions are still unknown: A, E  

Constraints on positions:
- A is in the word but NOT in position 1 (from AROSE) and NOT in position 3 (from LEANT).  
- E is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from LEANT) and NOT in position 5 (from AROSE).

So the word must contain both A and E, and the remaining three letters must come from the unused alphabet excluding R, O, S, L, N, T. The remaining common consonants are: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A and E exactly once each.
- Uses three other distinct letters from the allowed set.
- Respects the positional bans above.

Let’s list possible positions for A and E that satisfy the bans:

Possible positions for A (cannot be 1 or 3): 2, 4, 5  
Possible positions for E (cannot be 2 or 5): 1, 3, 4  

We can try to place A and E while filling the remaining slots with new letters.

One promising pattern:  
E _ A _ _  (E in 1, A in 3 — but A cannot be in 3) → invalid  
E _ _ A _ (E in 1, A in 4) → valid  
E _ _ _ A (E in 1, A in 5) → valid  

Another pattern:  
_ E _ _ _ (E in 2 — banned) → invalid  
_ _ E _ _ (E in 3) → valid  
_ _ _ E _ (E in 4) → valid  
_ _ _ _ E (E in 5 — banned) → invalid  

Another pattern:  
A _ E _ _ (A in 1 — banned) → invalid  
_ A E _ _ (A in 2, E in 3) → valid  
_ A _ E _ (A in 2, E in 4) → valid  
_ A _ _ E (A in 2, E in 5 — banned) → invalid  
_ _ A E _ (A in 3 — banned) → invalid  
_ _ A _ E (A in 3 — banned) → invalid  
_ _ _ A E (A in 4, E in 5 — banned) → invalid  
_ _ E A _ (E in 3, A in 4) → valid  
_ _ E _ A (E in 3, A in 5) → valid  
_ _ _ E A (E in 4, A in 5) → valid  

So valid placements of A and E are:
- E in 1, A in 4 or 5  
- A in 2, E in 3 or 4  
- A in 4, E in 3 or 4  
- A in 5, E in 3 or 4  

Let’s pick one of these patterns and fill with new allowed letters.  
For example, let’s try:  
E _ _ A _ (E in 1, A in 4)  
The middle two letters must be from {B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y}.  
A common word fitting this is E M B A R, but R is banned.  
Next: E M B A D → ""EMBAD"" is not a valid English word.  
Try E C H A D → ""ECHAD"" is not valid.  
Try E G G A D → invalid (double G and not a word).  
Try E B B A D → invalid.  

Another pattern: _ A E _ _ (A in 2, E in 3)  
Letters left: _ A E _ _  
Possible word: C A E D Y → invalid.  
B A E D Y → invalid.  
M A E D Y → invalid.  

Another pattern: _ _ E A _ (E in 3, A in 4)  
Letters left: _ _ E A _  
Possible word: P I E A N → invalid.  
B I E A N → invalid.  
M I E A N → invalid.  

Another pattern: _ _ _ E A (E in 4, A in 5)  
Letters left: _ _ _ E A  
Possible word: C H I E A → invalid.  
B H I E A → invalid.  
D I V E A → invalid.  

Another pattern: _ A _ E _ (A in 2, E in 4)  
Letters left: _ A _ E _  
Possible word: M A I E T → invalid.  
B A I E T → invalid.  
P A I E T → invalid.  

Another pattern: _ _ A E _ (A in 3 — banned) → invalid  

Another pattern: _ _ _ A E (A in 4, E in 5 — banned) → invalid  

Another pattern: _ _ E _ A (E in 3, A in 5)  
Letters left: _ _ E _ A  
Possible word: C H E W A → valid English word!  
Letters: C, H, E, W, A — none are banned.  
Positions:  
C (1) — allowed  
H (2) — allowed  
E (3) — allowed (E can be in 3)  
W (4) — allowed  
A (5) — allowed (A can be in 5)  

This satisfies all constraints.  
So the next guess is ""CHEWA"".

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three guesses we now have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)  
   – A, E are in the word but misplaced.  
   – R, O, S are not in the word.

2. LEANT → L(x) E(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)  
   – L, N, T are not in the word.  
   – E is not in position 2.  
   – A is not in position 3.

3. CHEWA → C(x) H(x) E(-) W(x) A(-)  
   – C, H, W are not in the word.  
   – E is not in position 3.  
   – A is not in position 5.

Letters we know are in the word: A, E  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: C, H, L, N, O, R, S, T, W  

Positions still unknown for A and E:
- A cannot be in positions 1, 3, 5.  
- E cannot be in positions 2, 3, 5.

So possible positions left:
A can only be in position 2 or 4.  
E can only be in position 1 or 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and E exactly once each.  
- Uses three other letters from the remaining allowed set: {B, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, Y}.  
- Respects the positional bans above.

Let’s list the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, Y.

We can try to place A and E together in position 4, since that’s the only position they have in common.

Pattern: _ _ _ A E  – but E is banned from position 5, so this is invalid.  
Pattern: _ _ A E _ – E in 4, A in 3 – but A is banned from 3.  
Pattern: _ A _ E _ – E in 4, A in 2 – this is valid.  
Pattern: A _ _ _ _ – A banned from 1.  
Pattern: _ _ E _ _ – E in 3 banned.  
Pattern: _ E _ _ _ – E in 2 banned.  
Pattern: _ _ _ E _ – E in 4, but A must be in 2 or 4. If A is in 2, then E is in 4. This works.

So the valid placement is:
- A in position 2  
- E in position 4  

The word structure: _ A _ E _

We need to fill positions 1, 3, 5 with allowed letters.  
Let’s pick common remaining letters: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, Y.

A common word fitting this pattern:  
M A I E D – but D is allowed, and none of the letters are banned.  
Check: M, A, I, E, D – all allowed.  
Positions:  
1=M – allowed  
2=A – allowed (A can be in 2)  
3=I – allowed  
4=E – allowed (E can be in 4)  
5=D – allowed  

This satisfies all constraints.

We now know the exact positions of three letters:

- Position 2: A (✓)
- Position 4: E (✓)
- Position 5: D (✓)

So the word looks like: _ A _ E D

Letters already ruled out (from all guesses):
R, O, S, L, N, T, C, H, W, M, I, B (and also earlier excluded: G, K, P, U, V, Y are still allowed).

Wait: the feedback on Guess 4 (MAIED) said D is in position 5 (✓), and on Guess 5 (BABED) the last letter is D (✓), so position 5 is definitely D.

But the feedback on Guess 5 shows the second B in position 3 as (x), so B is NOT in the word at all.

So the remaining allowed letters for positions 1 and 3 are from:
{F, G, K, P, U, V, Y}  (all others have been eliminated).

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form _ A _ E D.

Let’s list possibilities:
