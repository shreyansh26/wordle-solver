### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by covering common letters and patterns. A good strategy is to choose a word with frequently occurring letters and common vowel/consonant patterns. Some popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

After considering these, ""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowels in the target word
2. It has 2 common consonants (R, S) which appear frequently in 5-letter words
3. The letters are all distinct, giving maximum coverage
4. It follows common English word patterns

This should provide good coverage to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct first position (✓).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- O, S, E are not in the word at all (x).

So the pattern so far is:
A _ _ _ _

Letters to avoid: O, S, E  
Letters to use: R (somewhere other than position 2)

I need a word that:
1. Starts with A
2. Contains R but not in position 2
3. Does not contain O, S, or E
4. Uses other common letters to maximize information

Good candidates might be:
- ARISE – but it contains S and E (both ruled out)
- AURORA – contains O twice
- ABRIDG – contains B, R, I, D, G (but G is less common)
- ACRONYM – contains O and Y
- AFRICA – contains C, I, C, A (but C is repeated)

A better choice is ""ABRID"" (though it's not a common word) or ""ABRIG"". A more common word is ""ABRYS"" (but Y is less common). 

Looking at common letters, ""ABRIG"" is plausible but not ideal. Instead, ""ARIA"" is too short. 

A better word is ""ABRID"" (short for abridgment) but it's obscure. 

A more common word is ""ABRIG"" (though it's not standard). 

Actually, ""ARIA"" is 4 letters. 

Let me think of common 5-letter words starting with A, containing R, avoiding O, S, E. 

Possible words:
- ARISE – invalid (S,E)
- AUROR – invalid (O)
- ABRID – valid (but obscure)
- ABRIG – valid (but uncommon)
- AFRIG – invalid (not a word)
- ABRID is acceptable.

But ""ABRID"" is acceptable in Scrabble dictionaries. 

Alternatively, ""ABRYS"" is invalid (Y is not common). 

Another option is ""ABRIG"" which is a valid word (though rare). 

The best common word is ""ABRID"".

But ""ABRID"" is 5 letters, starts with A, contains R not in position 2, and avoids O, S, E. 

Therefore, I'll go with ""ABRID"".

1. Pattern: A _ R _ _  (A fixed in position 1, R fixed in position 3)
2. Letters ruled out entirely: O, S, E, B, I, D
3. Letters still possible: All others except the six above.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with A
- Has R in the third position
- Contains none of O, S, E, B, I, D
- Uses only remaining letters.

Common consonants left: C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, V, W, Y, Z  
Common vowels left: U (since A already used, and E, I, O ruled out)

So the word looks like: A _ R _ _ and the blanks must be filled with letters from the remaining pool.

Possible patterns:
- A U R _ _  (second letter U)
- A _ R U _  (fourth letter U)
- A _ R _ U  (fifth letter U)

Let’s list common 5-letter words fitting A _ R _ _ and avoiding the banned letters:

- AURUM – contains U, M (both allowed)
- ARGUE – contains G, U, E (E banned)
- ARGUE – invalid
- ARGON – contains O (banned)
- ARMY – too short
- AUROR – invalid
- AURUM – valid (A-U-R-U-M)

AURUM is a valid word (Latin for gold) and fits all constraints: starts with A, R in position 3, no banned letters.

Another candidate: AURUM is the only common word fitting the pattern. Let me check:

- A U R _ _ : next letters must be from allowed set. AURUM uses M (allowed) and U (allowed).

Therefore, AURUM is the logical next guess.
