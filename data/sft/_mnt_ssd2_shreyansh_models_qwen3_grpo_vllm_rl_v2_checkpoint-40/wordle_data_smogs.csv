For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best starting words typically use common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Some popular choices include:

- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O)

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. I'll choose a word that uses as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it uses S, L, A, T, E - covering 5 of the most common letters and including two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (S, L, T).

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the correct first position (✓)
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all (x)

So the secret word must be of the form S _ _ _ _ and none of L, A, T, E can appear anywhere in it.  
That leaves us to consider consonants and other vowels that weren’t ruled out: common remaining letters include R, N, I, O, U, C, H, etc.

I need a 5-letter word starting with S, avoiding L, A, T, E.  
Good candidates:  
- SHIRT (but has an I and R, both still possible)  
- SPOOR (but double O might be less common)  
- SNORT (N, O, R, T – but T was already ruled out)  
- SHIRT (S H I R T – but T is out)  
- SINKS (S I N K S – but K and second S are possible)  
- SHINS (S H I N S – but double S and N are possible)  
- SCOOP (S C O O P – but double O and P are possible)

The simplest next guess that avoids all ruled-out letters and keeps the S in place is “SHIRT”, but since T is out, I’ll skip that.  
Instead, I’ll pick “SHINS” – it keeps the S, introduces H, I, N, and another S (which is allowed because the second S could be in a different position). This tests H, I, N while preserving the S in the first spot.

Looking at common words, ""SCOUR"" is a valid word but ends with R. ""SCOWS"" is a valid word (plural of scow) but ends with S. However, ""SCOWS"" uses O, C, W, S which are all allowed.

Another option is ""SCURS"" (plural of scur), but ""SCOWS"" seems more common.

Another option is ""SCUPS"" (but this is not a common word).

""SCOUR"" is S C O U R - but this ends with R, not S.

""SCRUMS"" is S C R U M S - but this ends with S, but uses C, R, U, M which are allowed.

I'll go with ""SCOFFS"" as it tests F which is a common letter.

But we have 5-letter word, so positions 2-4 are 3 letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best starting words typically use common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Some popular choices include:

- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O)

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. I'll choose a word that uses as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it uses S, L, A, T, E - covering 5 of the most common letters and including two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (S, L, T).

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the correct first position (✓)
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all (x)

So the secret word must be of the form S _ _ _ _ and none of L, A, T, E can appear anywhere in it.  
That leaves us to consider consonants and other vowels that weren’t ruled out: common remaining letters include R, N, I, O, U, C, H, etc.

I need a 5-letter word starting with S, avoiding L, A, T, E.  
Good candidates:  
- SHIRT (but has an I and R, both still possible)  
- SPOOR (but double O might be less common)  
- SNORT (N, O, R, T – but T was already ruled out)  
- SHIRT (S H I R T – but T is out)  
- SINKS (S I N K S – but K and second S are possible)  
- SHINS (S H I N S – but double S and N are possible)  
- SCOOP (S C O O P – but double O and P are possible)

The simplest next guess that avoids all ruled-out letters and keeps the S in place is “SHIRT”, but since T is out, I’ll skip that.  
Instead, I’ll pick “SHINS” – it keeps the S, introduces H, I, N, and another S (which is allowed because the second S could be in a different position). This tests H, I, N while preserving the S in the first spot.

Guess 2: SHINS -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) I(x) N(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on SHINS:
- S is still correct in the first position (✓).
- H, I, N are not in the word at all (x).
- The final S is also correct in the fifth position (✓).

So the secret word must be: S _ _ _ S and it cannot contain L, A, T, E, H, I, N.

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I need a 5-letter word that starts and ends with S and uses only the remaining letters in positions 2, 3, 4. Common consonants left include R, O, U, C, K, M, P, etc.

Possible candidates:
- SCORUS (but SCORUS is not a common word)
- SCUPUS (not common)
- SCOOPS (but O is repeated and P is allowed)
- SCOUR (but this ends with R, not S)
- SCOTS (but T is ruled out)
- SCRUMS (but ends with S, but M is allowed)
- SCRUS (not common)
- SCUPS (not common)
- SCORS (not common)
- SCOWS (but W is allowed)
- SCOTS (T is out)
- SCUFFS (but F is allowed)
- SCISS (but I is out)
- SCOTS (T is out)
- SCUP (not 5 letters)
- SCURS (but ends with S, but R is allowed)

Looking at common words, ""SCOUR"" is a valid word but ends with R. ""SCOWS"" is a valid word (plural of scow) but ends with S. However, ""SCOWS"" uses O, C, W, S which are all allowed.

Another option is ""SCURS"" (plural of scur), but ""SCOWS"" seems more common.

But ""SCOWS"" is S C O W S - uses C, O, W which are all allowed.

Another option is ""SCUPS"" (but this is not a common word).

""SCOUR"" is S C O U R - but this ends with R, not S.

""SCRUMS"" is S C R U M S - but this ends with S, but uses C, R, U, M which are allowed.

But ""SCRUMS"" is 6 letters, not 5.

""SCOFFS"" is S C O F F S - but F is allowed.

""SCOFFS"" is a valid word.

""SCOFFS"" uses C, O, F, F, S - all allowed letters.

""SCOFFS"" seems like a good next guess as it tests C, O, F in positions 2,3,4.

But ""SCOWS"" is also valid.

Between ""SCOFFS"" and ""SCOWS"", ""SCOWS"" tests O and W, while ""SCOFFS"" tests F.

I'll go with ""SCOFFS"" as it tests F which is a common letter.

But wait, ""SCOFFS"" is S C O F F S - positions 2-4 are C, O, F.

But we have 5-letter word, so positions 2-4 are 3 letters.

""SCOFFS"" is 6 letters, so this is invalid.

Oops, I need 5-letter words.

Valid 5-letter words starting and ending with S, avoiding L, A, T, E, H, I, N:
- SCOPS (but O is repeated)
- SCOTS (T is out)
- SCOUR (ends with R)
- SCOWS (S C O W S - 5 letters)
- SCURS (S C U R S - 5 letters)
- SCUPS (not common)
- SCUFF (ends with F)
- SCUFF is 5 letters: S C U F F - but ends with F, not S.

Wait, the word must be S _ _ _ S.

So possible 5-letter words:
- SCOWS (S C O W S)
- SCURS (S C U R S)
- SCUPS (S C U P S)
- SCOFF (doesn't end with S)
- SCOFFS (6 letters)
- SCOTS (T is out)
- SCOUR (ends with R)
- SCRUMS (6 letters)
- SCURRS (6 letters)
- SCOWS is the only common 5-letter word starting and ending with S, avoiding the banned letters.

But ""SCOWS"" uses C, O, W in positions 2,3,4.

Another option is ""SCURS"" (S C U R S) - uses C, U, R.

Between these, ""SCOWS"" tests O and W, while ""SCURS"" tests U and R.

I'll choose ""SCURS"" as it tests more common letters (C, U, R).

But ""SCURS"" is a valid word (plural of scurs).

Looking at common words, ""SCOUR"" is a valid word but ends with R. ""SCOWS"" is a valid word (plural of scow) but ends with S. However, ""SCOWS"" uses O, C, W, S which are all allowed.

Another option is ""SCUPS"" (but this is not a common word).

""SCOUR"" is S C O U R - but this ends with R, not S.

""SCRUMS"" is S C R U M S - but this ends with S, but uses C, R, U, M which are allowed.

But ""SCRUMS"" is 6 letters, not 5.

""SCOFFS"" is S C O F F S - but F is allowed.

""SCOFFS"" is a valid word.

""SCOFFS"" uses C, O, F, F, S - all allowed letters.

""SCOFFS"" seems like a good next guess as it tests C, O, F in positions 2,3,4.

I'll go with ""SCOFFS"" as it tests F which is a common letter.

But wait, ""SCOFFS"" is S C O F F S - positions 2-4 are C, O, F.

But we have 5-letter word, so positions 2-4 are 3 letters.

Valid 5-letter words starting and ending with S, avoiding L, A, T, E, H, I, N:

But ""SCOWS"" uses C, O, W in positions 2,3,4.

Another option is ""SCURS"" (S C U R S) - uses C, U, R.

Between these, ""SCOWS"" tests O and W, while ""SCURS"" tests U and R.

I'll choose ""SCURS"" as it tests more common letters (C, U, R).

But ""SCURS"" is a valid word (plural of scurs).

So:

- Forbidden letters so far: L, A, T, E, H, I, N, C, U, R
- Allowed letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word starting and ending with S, using only the allowed letters in positions 2-4.

Possible candidates:
- SPOKS (S P O K S) – but K is allowed
- SPODS (S P O D S) – D is allowed
- SMOKS (S M O K S) – M is allowed
- SPOGS (S P O G S) – G is allowed

- SPOKS, SPODS, SMOKS, SPOGS, SPOWS, SPOOS are all valid 5-letter words

Among these, ""SPOOS"" is the most common word (meaning to inflate or swell), so I'll choose that.

From the latest feedback on SPOOS:
- S(✓) in positions 1 and 5 are correct.
- P is NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word and is in the correct position 3 (✓).
- The second O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the pattern is now: S _ O _ S and the remaining letters must come from the allowed set excluding P.

Forbidden letters accumulated so far:
L, A, T, E, H, I, N, C, U, R, P

Allowed letters left: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the second O must appear somewhere in positions 2 or 4.

We need a 5-letter word of the form S _ O _ S with the second O appearing in position 2 or 4, and using only allowed letters.

Possible words:
- S B O O S (SBOOS) – but B is allowed
- S D O O S (SDOOS) – D is allowed
- S F O O S (SFOOS) – F is allowed
- S G O O S (SGOOS) – G is allowed
- S J O O S (SJOOS) – J is allowed
- S K O O S (SKOOS) – K is allowed
- S M O O S (SMOOS) – M is allowed
- S Q O O S (SQOOS) – Q is allowed
- S V O O S (SVOOS) – V is allowed
- S W O O S (SWOOS) – W is allowed
- S X O O S (SXOOS) – X is allowed
- S Y O O S (SYOOS) – Y is allowed
- S Z O O S (SZOOS) – Z is allowed

The most common English word among these is ""SKOOS"" (a dialectal term for ""to scoot""), but ""SMOOS"" is also valid. However, ""SMOOS"" is not a standard word. The actual standard word is ""SKOOS"".

But ""SKOOS"" is 5 letters: S K O O S.

Let me verify: S K O O S
- S(✓) in positions 1 and 5
- O(✓) in position 3
- Second O is in position 4, which is allowed since it's marked (-) – meaning it's in the word but not in position 4 (wait, no: (-) means it's in the word but in the wrong position. In SPOOS, the second O was in position 4 and was marked (-), so in the secret word, there is an O but not in position 4. Therefore, the second O must be in position 2.)

Therefore, the word must be S O O _ S.

So the pattern is S O O _ S.

Now we need a letter for position 4 from the allowed set: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:
- S O O B S (SOOBS) – but this is not a common word
- S O O D S (SOODS) – not common
- S O O F S (OOFS) – not 5 letters
- S O O G S (OOGS) – not common
- S O O K S (OOKS) – not common
- S O O M S (OOMS) – not common
- S O O V S (OOVS) – not common
- S O O W S (OOWS) – not common
- S O O X S (OOXS) – not common
- S O O Y S (OOYS) – not common
- S O O Z S (OOZS) – not common

The only valid common word seems to be ""SOOBS"" (though it's not standard), but actually ""SOOBS"" is not a recognized English word. Similarly, ""OOKS"" is not standard.

Looking back, perhaps the second O must be in position 2, making the word S O O _ S, but none of these seem valid.

Wait, let's re-examine the feedback on SPOOS:
- S(✓) P(x) O(✓) O(-) S(✓)
This means:
- Position 1: S ✓
- Position 2: P x (not in word)
- Position 3: O ✓ (correct position)
- Position 4: O (-) (in word but wrong position)
- Position 5: S ✓

Therefore, the word has:
- S at 1 and 5
- O at 3
- Exactly one more O somewhere else (since the second O in position 4 is marked as in word but wrong position, implying there's only one O in the word and it's already placed at 3, so this seems contradictory - actually the feedback indicates that there is another O in the word but not in position 4.)

Therefore, the word must have:
- S _ O _ S
- And an additional O somewhere in positions 2 or 4, but not in position 4 (since position 4's O was marked (-), meaning it's in the word but not in position 4). Therefore, the second O must be in position 2.

Thus, the word is S O O _ S.

Now, the missing letter in position 4 must be from allowed letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words S O O _ S:
- S O O B S – not a word
- S O O D S – not a word
- S O O F S – not a word
- S O O G S – not a word
- S O O K S – not a word
- S O O M S – not a word
- S O O V S – not a word
- S O O W S – not a word
- S O O X S – not a word
- S O O Y S – not a word
- S O O Z S – not a word

This suggests that the only possible word fitting S O O _ S from allowed letters is ""SOOBS"", but this is not a standard word. This indicates an error in my reasoning.

Re-evaluating: The feedback shows that there is exactly one O in the word, correctly placed at position 3 (✓). The second O in position 4 was marked (-), meaning it's in the word but in the wrong position, which is impossible because position 3 is already occupied by O. This implies the word has only one O at position 3, and the second O in position 4 is simply not part of the word (x), but the feedback says (-) meaning it's in the word but wrong position. This seems contradictory.

However, upon closer inspection, the feedback format indicates:
- For each letter in the guess, the symbol corresponds to that specific position.
In SPOOS:
- S(✓) – position 1 correct
- P(x) – P not in word
- O(✓) – position 3 correct
- O(-) – the second O is in the word but not in position 4
- S(✓) – position 5 correct

This implies the word has:
- S at 1 and 5
- O at 3
- Another O somewhere else (but not at position 4), which would have to be position 2
Thus, the word must be S O O _ S

But as noted, no standard English word fits S O O _ S except ""SOOBS"", which is not valid. This suggests that the only possible word is ""SOOBS"" despite its rarity, or there may be an error in interpretation.

Given the constraints, the most plausible word is ""SOOBS"", but since it's not valid, I must have made an error. Re-examining allowed letters: we have excluded P, but not others.

Wait, the allowed letters after all exclusions are: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, and the second O must be in position 2.

Thus, the word must be S O O _ S with the fourth letter from the allowed set. The only possible combination is S O O B S (SOOBS), but this is not a valid word.

This indicates that the correct word must be ""SOOBS"" despite its non-standard status, or there's a miscalculation. However, ""SOOBS"" is not recognized.

Rechecking: Perhaps the word is ""SOOBS"" (a variant spelling or dialect), but in standard Wordle, the word would be ""SOOBS"" is invalid. This suggests that the actual word must be ""SOOFS"" (but F is allowed), but ""SOOFS"" is not a word.

Given the constraints, the only possible word is ""SOOBS"", but since it's invalid, I must have misinterpreted. The feedback indicates that the word has an O in position 3 (✓) and the second O in position 4 is marked (-), meaning the word has an O but not in position 4. Therefore, the word must have exactly one O at position 3, and no other O's. Thus, the word is S _ O _ S with no additional O's.

In this case, the second O in position 4 was marked (-) to indicate that O is in the word but not in position 4, but since position 3 is already O, this implies the word has only one O, and the feedback for position 4's O is (-) meaning it's in the word but not in position 4, which is redundant because position 3 is already O.

This suggests that the word is S _ O _ S with no second O, and the feedback for position 4's O was (-) indicating that O is in the word but not in position 4 (which is already satisfied by position 3). Therefore, the word is S _ O _ S with the remaining letters from allowed set: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, possible words:
- S B O _ S – no common word
- S D O _ S – no common word
- S F O _ S – no common word
- S G O _ S – no common word
- S J O _ S – no common word
- S K O _ S – ""SKOOS"" (valid word)
- S M O _ S – no common word
- S Q O _ S – no common word
- S V O _ S – no common word
- S W O _ S – no common word
- S X O _ S – no common word
- S Y O _ S – no common word
- S Z O _ S – no common word

The valid word is ""SKOOS"".

Therefore, the correct next guess is ""SKOOS"".
</think>

Based on the feedback, the word must be S _ O _ S with no additional O's, and the only valid 5-letter word fitting this pattern is ""SKOOS"".

<guess>SKOOS</guess>",SKOOS,"From the latest feedback on SPOOS:
- S(✓) in positions 1 and 5 are correct.
- P is NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word and is in the correct position 3 (✓).

So the pattern is now: S _ O _ S and the remaining letters must come from the allowed set excluding P.

Forbidden letters accumulated so far:
L, A, T, E, H, I, N, C, U, R, P

Allowed letters left: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the second O must appear somewhere in positions 2 or 4.

Therefore, the word must be S O O _ S.

So the pattern is S O O _ S.

Now we need a letter for position 4 from the allowed set: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:
- S O O B S (SOOBS) – but this is not a common word

The only valid common word seems to be ""SOOBS"" (though it's not standard), but actually ""SOOBS"" is not a recognized English word. Similarly, ""OOKS"" is not standard.

This means:
- Position 1: S ✓
- Position 2: P x (not in word)
- Position 3: O ✓ (correct position)
- Position 4: O (-) (in word but wrong position)
- Position 5: S ✓

Therefore, the word has:
- S at 1 and 5

Thus, the word is S O O _ S.

Now, the missing letter in position 4 must be from allowed letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Given the constraints, the most plausible word is ""SOOBS"", but since it's not valid, I must have made an error. Re-examining allowed letters: we have excluded P, but not others.

Wait, the allowed letters after all exclusions are: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, and the second O must be in position 2.

Thus, the word must be S O O _ S with the fourth letter from the allowed set. The only possible combination is S O O B S (SOOBS), but this is not a valid word.

This indicates that the correct word must be ""SOOBS"" despite its non-standard status, or there's a miscalculation. However, ""SOOBS"" is not recognized.

Rechecking: Perhaps the word is ""SOOBS"" (a variant spelling or dialect), but in standard Wordle, the word would be ""SOOBS"" is invalid. This suggests that the actual word must be ""SOOFS"" (but F is allowed), but ""SOOFS"" is not a word.

Given the constraints, the only possible word is ""SOOBS"", but since it's invalid, I must have misinterpreted. The feedback indicates that the word has an O in position 3 (✓) and the second O in position 4 is marked (-), meaning the word has an O but not in position 4. Therefore, the word must have exactly one O at position 3, and no other O's. Thus, the word is S _ O _ S with no additional O's.

In this case, the second O in position 4 was marked (-) to indicate that O is in the word but not in position 4, but since position 3 is already O, this implies the word has only one O, and the feedback for position 4's O is (-) meaning it's in the word but not in position 4, which is redundant because position 3 is already O.

This suggests that the word is S _ O _ S with no second O, and the feedback for position 4's O was (-) indicating that O is in the word but not in position 4 (which is already satisfied by position 3). Therefore, the word is S _ O _ S with the remaining letters from allowed set: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, possible words:
- S B O _ S – no common word
- S D O _ S – no common word
- S F O _ S – no common word
- S G O _ S – no common word
- S J O _ S – no common word
- S K O _ S – ""SKOOS"" (valid word)

- S V O _ S – no common word
- S W O _ S – no common word
- S X O _ S – no common word
- S Y O _ S – no common word
- S Z O _ S – no common word

The valid word is ""SKOOS"".

Therefore, the correct next guess is ""SKOOS"".Based on the feedback, the word must be S _ O _ S with no additional O's, and the only valid 5-letter word fitting this pattern is ""SKOOS"".",Guess 5: SKOOS -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) K(x) O(✓) O(-) S(✓),FAIL

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best starting words typically use common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Some popular choices include:

- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O)

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. I'll choose a word that uses as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it uses S, L, A, T, E - covering 5 of the most common letters and including two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (S, L, T).

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the correct first position (✓)
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all (x)

So the secret word must be of the form S _ _ _ _ and none of L, A, T, E can appear anywhere in it.  
That leaves us to consider consonants and other vowels that weren’t ruled out: common remaining letters include R, N, I, O, U, C, H, etc.

I need a 5-letter word starting with S, avoiding L, A, T, E.  
Good candidates:  
- SHIRT (but has an I and R, both still possible)  
- SPOOR (but double O might be less common)  
- SNORT (N, O, R, T – but T was already ruled out)  
- SHIRT (S H I R T – but T is out)  
- SINKS (S I N K S – but K and second S are possible)  
- SHINS (S H I N S – but double S and N are possible)  
- SCOOP (S C O O P – but double O and P are possible)

The simplest next guess that avoids all ruled-out letters and keeps the S in place is “SHIRT”, but since T is out, I’ll skip that.  
Instead, I’ll pick “SHINS” – it keeps the S, introduces H, I, N, and another S (which is allowed because the second S could be in a different position). This tests H, I, N while preserving the S in the first spot.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SHINS -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) I(x) N(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on SHINS:
- S is still correct in the first position (✓).
- H, I, N are not in the word at all (x).
- The final S is also correct in the fifth position (✓).

So the secret word must be: S _ _ _ S and it cannot contain L, A, T, E, H, I, N.

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I need a 5-letter word that starts and ends with S and uses only the remaining letters in positions 2, 3, 4. Common consonants left include R, O, U, C, K, M, P, etc.

Possible candidates:
- SCORUS (but SCORUS is not a common word)
- SCUPUS (not common)
- SCOOPS (but O is repeated and P is allowed)
- SCOUR (but this ends with R, not S)
- SCOTS (but T is ruled out)
- SCRUMS (but ends with S, but M is allowed)
- SCRUS (not common)
- SCUPS (not common)
- SCORS (not common)
- SCOWS (but W is allowed)
- SCOTS (T is out)
- SCUFFS (but F is allowed)
- SCISS (but I is out)
- SCOTS (T is out)
- SCUP (not 5 letters)
- SCURS (but ends with S, but R is allowed)

Looking at common words, ""SCOUR"" is a valid word but ends with R. ""SCOWS"" is a valid word (plural of scow) but ends with S. However, ""SCOWS"" uses O, C, W, S which are all allowed.

Another option is ""SCURS"" (plural of scur), but ""SCOWS"" seems more common.

But ""SCOWS"" is S C O W S - uses C, O, W which are all allowed.

Another option is ""SCUPS"" (but this is not a common word).

""SCOUR"" is S C O U R - but this ends with R, not S.

""SCRUMS"" is S C R U M S - but this ends with S, but uses C, R, U, M which are allowed.

But ""SCRUMS"" is 6 letters, not 5.

""SCOFFS"" is S C O F F S - but F is allowed.

""SCOFFS"" is a valid word.

""SCOFFS"" uses C, O, F, F, S - all allowed letters.

""SCOFFS"" seems like a good next guess as it tests C, O, F in positions 2,3,4.

But ""SCOWS"" is also valid.

Between ""SCOFFS"" and ""SCOWS"", ""SCOWS"" tests O and W, while ""SCOFFS"" tests F.

I'll go with ""SCOFFS"" as it tests F which is a common letter.

But wait, ""SCOFFS"" is S C O F F S - positions 2-4 are C, O, F.

But we have 5-letter word, so positions 2-4 are 3 letters.

""SCOFFS"" is 6 letters, so this is invalid.

Oops, I need 5-letter words.

Valid 5-letter words starting and ending with S, avoiding L, A, T, E, H, I, N:
- SCOPS (but O is repeated)
- SCOTS (T is out)
- SCOUR (ends with R)
- SCOWS (S C O W S - 5 letters)
- SCURS (S C U R S - 5 letters)
- SCUPS (not common)
- SCUFF (ends with F)
- SCUFF is 5 letters: S C U F F - but ends with F, not S.

Wait, the word must be S _ _ _ S.

So possible 5-letter words:
- SCOWS (S C O W S)
- SCURS (S C U R S)
- SCUPS (S C U P S)
- SCOFF (doesn't end with S)
- SCOFFS (6 letters)
- SCOTS (T is out)
- SCOUR (ends with R)
- SCRUMS (6 letters)
- SCURRS (6 letters)
- SCOWS is the only common 5-letter word starting and ending with S, avoiding the banned letters.

But ""SCOWS"" uses C, O, W in positions 2,3,4.

Another option is ""SCURS"" (S C U R S) - uses C, U, R.

Between these, ""SCOWS"" tests O and W, while ""SCURS"" tests U and R.

I'll choose ""SCURS"" as it tests more common letters (C, U, R).

But ""SCURS"" is a valid word (plural of scurs).

So:

- Allowed letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word starting and ending with S, using only the allowed letters in positions 2-4.

From the latest feedback on SPOOS:
- S(✓) in positions 1 and 5 are correct.
- P is NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word and is in the correct position 3 (✓).
- The second O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the pattern is now: S _ O _ S and the remaining letters must come from the allowed set excluding P.

Forbidden letters accumulated so far:
L, A, T, E, H, I, N, C, U, R, P

Allowed letters left: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the second O must appear somewhere in positions 2 or 4.

We need a 5-letter word of the form S _ O _ S with the second O appearing in position 2 or 4, and using only allowed letters.

Possible words:
- S B O O S (SBOOS) – but B is allowed
- S D O O S (SDOOS) – D is allowed
- S F O O S (SFOOS) – F is allowed
- S G O O S (SGOOS) – G is allowed
- S J O O S (SJOOS) – J is allowed
- S K O O S (SKOOS) – K is allowed
- S M O O S (SMOOS) – M is allowed
- S Q O O S (SQOOS) – Q is allowed
- S V O O S (SVOOS) – V is allowed
- S W O O S (SWOOS) – W is allowed
- S X O O S (SXOOS) – X is allowed
- S Y O O S (SYOOS) – Y is allowed
- S Z O O S (SZOOS) – Z is allowed

The most common English word among these is ""SKOOS"" (a dialectal term for ""to scoot""), but ""SMOOS"" is also valid. However, ""SMOOS"" is not a standard word. The actual standard word is ""SKOOS"".

But ""SKOOS"" is 5 letters: S K O O S.

Let me verify: S K O O S
- S(✓) in positions 1 and 5
- O(✓) in position 3
- Second O is in position 4, which is allowed since it's marked (-) – meaning it's in the word but not in position 4 (wait, no: (-) means it's in the word but in the wrong position. In SPOOS, the second O was in position 4 and was marked (-), so in the secret word, there is an O but not in position 4. Therefore, the second O must be in position 2.)

Therefore, the word must be S O O _ S.

So the pattern is S O O _ S.

Now we need a letter for position 4 from the allowed set: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:
- S O O B S (SOOBS) – but this is not a common word
- S O O D S (SOODS) – not common
- S O O F S (OOFS) – not 5 letters
- S O O G S (OOGS) – not common
- S O O K S (OOKS) – not common
- S O O M S (OOMS) – not common
- S O O V S (OOVS) – not common
- S O O W S (OOWS) – not common
- S O O X S (OOXS) – not common
- S O O Y S (OOYS) – not common
- S O O Z S (OOZS) – not common

The only valid common word seems to be ""SOOBS"" (though it's not standard), but actually ""SOOBS"" is not a recognized English word. Similarly, ""OOKS"" is not standard.

Looking back, perhaps the second O must be in position 2, making the word S O O _ S, but none of these seem valid.

Wait, let's re-examine the feedback on SPOOS:
- S(✓) P(x) O(✓) O(-) S(✓)
This means:
- Position 1: S ✓
- Position 2: P x (not in word)
- Position 3: O ✓ (correct position)
- Position 4: O (-) (in word but wrong position)
- Position 5: S ✓

Therefore, the word has:
- S at 1 and 5
- O at 3
- Exactly one more O somewhere else (since the second O in position 4 is marked as in word but wrong position, implying there's only one O in the word and it's already placed at 3, so this seems contradictory - actually the feedback indicates that there is another O in the word but not in position 4.)

Therefore, the word must have:
- S _ O _ S
- And an additional O somewhere in positions 2 or 4, but not in position 4 (since position 4's O was marked (-), meaning it's in the word but not in position 4). Therefore, the second O must be in position 2.

Thus, the word is S O O _ S.

Now, the missing letter in position 4 must be from allowed letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words S O O _ S:
- S O O B S – not a word
- S O O D S – not a word
- S O O F S – not a word
- S O O G S – not a word
- S O O K S – not a word
- S O O M S – not a word
- S O O V S – not a word
- S O O W S – not a word
- S O O X S – not a word
- S O O Y S – not a word
- S O O Z S – not a word

This suggests that the only possible word fitting S O O _ S from allowed letters is ""SOOBS"", but this is not a standard word. This indicates an error in my reasoning.

Re-evaluating: The feedback shows that there is exactly one O in the word, correctly placed at position 3 (✓). The second O in position 4 was marked (-), meaning it's in the word but in the wrong position, which is impossible because position 3 is already occupied by O. This implies the word has only one O at position 3, and the second O in position 4 is simply not part of the word (x), but the feedback says (-) meaning it's in the word but wrong position. This seems contradictory.

However, upon closer inspection, the feedback format indicates:
- For each letter in the guess, the symbol corresponds to that specific position.
In SPOOS:
- S(✓) – position 1 correct
- P(x) – P not in word
- O(✓) – position 3 correct
- O(-) – the second O is in the word but not in position 4
- S(✓) – position 5 correct

This implies the word has:
- S at 1 and 5
- O at 3
- Another O somewhere else (but not at position 4), which would have to be position 2
Thus, the word must be S O O _ S

But as noted, no standard English word fits S O O _ S except ""SOOBS"", which is not valid. This suggests that the only possible word is ""SOOBS"" despite its rarity, or there may be an error in interpretation.

Given the constraints, the most plausible word is ""SOOBS"", but since it's not valid, I must have made an error. Re-examining allowed letters: we have excluded P, but not others.

Wait, the allowed letters after all exclusions are: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, and the second O must be in position 2.

Thus, the word must be S O O _ S with the fourth letter from the allowed set. The only possible combination is S O O B S (SOOBS), but this is not a valid word.

This indicates that the correct word must be ""SOOBS"" despite its non-standard status, or there's a miscalculation. However, ""SOOBS"" is not recognized.

Rechecking: Perhaps the word is ""SOOBS"" (a variant spelling or dialect), but in standard Wordle, the word would be ""SOOBS"" is invalid. This suggests that the actual word must be ""SOOFS"" (but F is allowed), but ""SOOFS"" is not a word.

Given the constraints, the only possible word is ""SOOBS"", but since it's invalid, I must have misinterpreted. The feedback indicates that the word has an O in position 3 (✓) and the second O in position 4 is marked (-), meaning the word has an O but not in position 4. Therefore, the word must have exactly one O at position 3, and no other O's. Thus, the word is S _ O _ S with no additional O's.

In this case, the second O in position 4 was marked (-) to indicate that O is in the word but not in position 4, but since position 3 is already O, this implies the word has only one O, and the feedback for position 4's O is (-) meaning it's in the word but not in position 4, which is redundant because position 3 is already O.

This suggests that the word is S _ O _ S with no second O, and the feedback for position 4's O was (-) indicating that O is in the word but not in position 4 (which is already satisfied by position 3). Therefore, the word is S _ O _ S with the remaining letters from allowed set: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, possible words:
- S B O _ S – no common word
- S D O _ S – no common word
- S F O _ S – no common word
- S G O _ S – no common word
- S J O _ S – no common word
- S K O _ S – ""SKOOS"" (valid word)
- S M O _ S – no common word
- S Q O _ S – no common word
- S V O _ S – no common word
- S W O _ S – no common word
- S X O _ S – no common word
- S Y O _ S – no common word
- S Z O _ S – no common word

The valid word is ""SKOOS"".

Therefore, the correct next guess is ""SKOOS"".Based on the feedback, the word must be S _ O _ S with no additional O's, and the only valid 5-letter word fitting this pattern is ""SKOOS"".

In SPOOS, the second O was in position 4 and was marked (-), so in the secret word, there is an O but not in position 4. Therefore, the second O must be in position 2.)\n\nTherefore, the word must be S O O _ S.\n\nSo the pattern is S O O _ S.\n\nNow we need a letter for position 4 from the allowed set: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nPossible words:\n- S O O B S (SOOBS) – but this is not a common word\n- S O O D S (SOODS) – not common\n- S O O F S (OOFS) – not 5 letters\n- S O O G S (OOGS) – not common\n- S O O K S (OOKS) – not common\n- S O O M S (OOMS) – not common\n- S O O V S (OOVS) – not common\n- S O O W S (OOWS) – not common\n- S O O X S (OOXS) – not common\n- S O O Y S (OOYS) – not common\n- S O O Z S (OOZS) – not common\n\nThe only valid common word seems to be ""SOOBS"" (though it\'s not standard), but actually ""SOOBS"" is not a recognized English word. Similarly, ""OOKS"" is not standard.\n\nLooking back, perhaps the second O must be in position 2, making the word S O O _ S, but none of these seem valid.\n\nWait, let\'s re-examine the feedback on SPOOS:\n- S(✓) P(x) O(✓) O(-) S(✓)\nThis means:\n- Position 1: S ✓\n- Position 2: P x (not in word)\n- Position 3: O ✓ (correct position)\n- Position 4: O (-) (in word but wrong position)\n- Position 5: S ✓\n\nTherefore, the word has:\n- S at 1 and 5\n- O at 3\n- Exactly one more O somewhere else (since the second O in position 4 is marked as in word but wrong position, implying there\'s only one O in the word and it\'s already placed at 3, so this seems contradictory - actually the feedback indicates that there is another O in the word but not in position 4.)\n\nTherefore, the word must have:\n- S _ O _ S\n- And an additional O somewhere in positions 2 or 4, but not in position 4 (since position 4\'s O was marked (-), meaning it\'s in the word but not in position 4). Therefore, the second O must be in position 2.\n\nThus, the word is S O O _ S.\n\nNow, the missing letter in position 4 must be from allowed letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nLooking for common 5-letter words S O O _ S:\n- S O O B S – not a word\n- S O O D S – not a word\n- S O O F S – not a word\n- S O O G S – not a word\n- S O O K S – not a word\n- S O O M S – not a word\n- S O O V S – not a word\n- S O O W S – not a word\n- S O O X S – not a word\n- S O O Y S – not a word\n- S O O Z S – not a word\n\nThis suggests that the only possible word fitting S O O _ S from allowed letters is ""SOOBS"", but this is not a standard word. This indicates an error in my reasoning.\n\nRe-evaluating: The feedback shows that there is exactly one O in the word, correctly placed at position 3 (✓). The second O in position 4 was marked (-), meaning it\'s in the word but in the wrong position, which is impossible because position 3 is already occupied by O. This implies the word has only one O at position 3, and the second O in position 4 is simply not part of the word (x), but the feedback says (-) meaning it\'s in the word but wrong position. This seems contradictory.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, the feedback format indicates:\n- For each letter in the guess, the symbol corresponds to that specific position.\nIn SPOOS:\n- S(✓) – position 1 correct\n- P(x) – P not in word\n- O(✓) – position 3 correct\n- O(-) – the second O is in the word but not in position 4\n- S(✓) – position 5 correct\n\nThis implies the word has:\n- S at 1 and 5\n- O at 3\n- Another O somewhere else (but not at position 4), which would have to be position 2\nThus, the word must be S O O _ S\n\nBut as noted, no standard English word fits S O O _ S except ""SOOBS"", which is not valid. This suggests that the only possible word is ""SOOBS"" despite its rarity, or there may be an error in interpretation.\n\nGiven the constraints, the most plausible word is ""SOOBS"", but since it\'s not valid, I must have made an error. Re-examining allowed letters: we have excluded P, but not others.\n\nWait, the allowed letters after all exclusions are: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, and the second O must be in position 2.\n\nThus, the word must be S O O _ S with the fourth letter from the allowed set. The only possible combination is S O O B S (SOOBS), but this is not a valid word.\n\nThis indicates that the correct word must be ""SOOBS"" despite its non-standard status, or there\'s a miscalculation. However, ""SOOBS"" is not recognized.\n\nRechecking: Perhaps the word is ""SOOBS"" (a variant spelling or dialect), but in standard Wordle, the word would be ""SOOBS"" is invalid. This suggests that the actual word must be ""SOOFS"" (but F is allowed), but ""SOOFS"" is not a word.\n\nGiven the constraints, the only possible word is ""SOOBS"", but since it\'s invalid, I must have misinterpreted. The feedback indicates that the word has an O in position 3 (✓) and the second O in position 4 is marked (-), meaning the word has an O but not in position 4. Therefore, the word must have exactly one O at position 3, and no other O\'s. Thus, the word is S _ O _ S with no additional O\'s.\n\nIn this case, the second O in position 4 was marked (-) to indicate that O is in the word but not in position 4, but since position 3 is already O, this implies the word has only one O, and the feedback for position 4\'s O is (-) meaning it\'s in the word but not in position 4, which is redundant because position 3 is already O.\n\nThis suggests that the word is S _ O _ S with no second O, and the feedback for position 4\'s O was (-) indicating that O is in the word but not in position 4 (which is already satisfied by position 3). Therefore, the word is S _ O _ S with the remaining letters from allowed set: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nNow, possible words:\n- S B O _ S – no common word\n- S D O _ S – no common word\n- S F O _ S – no common word\n- S G O _ S – no common word\n- S J O _ S – no common word\n- S K O _ S – ""SKOOS"" (valid word)\n- S M O _ S – no common word\n- S Q O _ S – no common word\n- S V O _ S – no common word\n- S W O _ S – no common word\n- S X O _ S – no common word\n- S Y O _ S – no common word\n- S Z O _ S – no common word\n\nThe valid word is ""SKOOS"".\n\nTherefore, the correct next guess is ""SKOOS"".Based on the feedback, the word must be S _ O _ S with no additional O\'s, and the only valid 5-letter word fitting this pattern is ""SKOOS"".\n\n<guess>SKOOS</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: SHINS -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) I(x) N(x) S(✓)\nGuess 3: SCURS -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(x) U(x) R(x) S(✓)\nGuess 4: SPOOS -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) O(✓) O(-) S(✓)\nGuess 5: SKOOS -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) K(x) O(✓) O(-) S(✓)\n'}]","<think>

- S(✓) in positions 1 and 5 are correct.
- K is NOT in the word (x).
- O(✓) in position 3 is correct.
- The second O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the pattern is S _ O _ S and the second O must appear in position 2 or 4, but not in position 4 (since the O in position 4 was marked (-) in both SPOOS and SKOOS, indicating it's in the word but not in position 4).

Therefore, the second O must be in position 2, making the word S O O _ S.

Now, the missing letter in position 4 must be from the allowed set: B, D, F, G, J, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (all other letters have been excluded).

The only valid English word fitting S O O _ S is ""SOOBS"", but it's not recognized. This suggests the word must be ""SOOFS"" (a non-standard variant), but since standard Wordle dictionaries don't include this, I must have missed an earlier exclusion.

Re-examining allowed letters: after excluding L,A,T,E,H,I,N,C,U,R,P,K, the remaining letters for position 4 are B,D,F,G,J,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z. None form a standard word with S O O _ S.

This indicates the word must be ""SOOBS"" despite its non-standard status, as it's the only possible combination. However, since standard Wordle doesn't accept this, I must reconsider.

Upon deeper reflection, the feedback implies the word has exactly one O at position 3, and the second O in positions 2 or 4 is marked (-) to indicate O is in the word but not in those positions, which is impossible because position 3 is already O. This suggests the word has only one O at position 3, and the earlier O marks were indicating that O is in the word (✓) and not in other positions (x).

Re-reading feedback carefully:
- In SPOOS: O(✓) at 3 means O is correct there, and O(-) at 4 means O is in word but not at 4 (redundant, as 3 is already taken).
- In SKOOS: K(x) means K is not in word, and O(-) at 4 again means O is not at 4.

Thus, the word is S _ O _ S with no second O, and the letters for positions 2 and 4 must be from remaining allowed letters: B, D, F, G, J, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
