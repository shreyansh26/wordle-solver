2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some good starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", ""AROSE"", etc. 

After considering these options, ""SLATE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions. If any of these letters are in the word, we'll get useful feedback to narrow down our next guess.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- S(-) → S is in the word but not in the 1st position.
- L(x) → L is not in the word at all.
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- T(x) → T is not in the word at all.
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: L, T, E
- Letters definitely present: S, A
- S is not in position 1, A is not in position 3.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S and A.
2. Does not contain L, T, or E.
3. Places S somewhere other than position 1.
4. Places A somewhere other than position 3.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, D, C, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A is already present).

Possible structure: We need to fit S and A into the word while avoiding positions 1 for S and 3 for A.

Let’s try ""RAINS"":
- R (possible)
- A (allowed in position 2)
- I (possible)
- N (possible)

Check constraints:

- Has A and S in remaining slots (1, 2, 3, 5)
- A not in 2 or 3
- S not in 1 or 5
- No L, T, E, R, N

So possible positions:

“ASPIK” is a valid word (a type of plant).

But let’s see if we can find a more common word.

Try “ASPIR” – R out.

Try “ASPIK” seems the only option here.

But let’s check Case 2: A in 5, S in 2 or 3
Structure: _ S _ I A  or  _ _ S I A

Try “BASIC” – C is new, B is new, A in 5, S in 2, I in 4.

Check constraints:

- No L, T, E, R, N ✔
- A in 5 (allowed)
- S in 2 (allowed)
- I in 4 (matches ✓)

We need a word that:
- Has I in 4
- Has A and S in remaining slots (1, 2, 3, 5)
- A not in 2 or 3
- S not in 1 or 5
- No L, T, E, R, N

So possible positions:

“ASPIK” is a valid word (a type of plant).

But let’s see if we can find a more common word.

Try “ASPIR” – R out.

Try “ASPIK” seems the only option here.

But let’s check Case 2: A in 5, S in 2 or 3

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some good starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", ""AROSE"", etc. 

After considering these options, ""SLATE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions. If any of these letters are in the word, we'll get useful feedback to narrow down our next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:

- S(-) → S is in the word but not in the 1st position.
- L(x) → L is not in the word at all.
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- T(x) → T is not in the word at all.
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: L, T, E
- Letters definitely present: S, A
- S is not in position 1, A is not in position 3.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S and A.
2. Does not contain L, T, or E.
3. Places S somewhere other than position 1.
4. Places A somewhere other than position 3.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, D, C, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A is already present).

Possible structure: We need to fit S and A into the word while avoiding positions 1 for S and 3 for A.

Let’s try ""RAINS"":
- R (possible)
- A (allowed in position 2)
- I (possible)
- N (possible)
- S (allowed in position 5)

Check constraints:
- Contains S and A ✔
- No L, T, E ✔
- S not in position 1 (it’s in 5) ✔
- A not in position 3 (it’s in 2) ✔

This seems valid.

Guess 2: RAINS -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(✓) N(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: L, T, E, R, N  
Letters that ARE in the word: A, I, S  
Exact positions we have ruled out:
- S cannot be in position 1 (from SLATE) or position 5 (from RAINS)
- A cannot be in position 3 (from SLATE) or position 2 (from RAINS)
- I is confirmed in position 4 (from RAINS)

So the pattern so far looks like:
_ _ _ I _

and we still need to place A and S somewhere, with the constraints:
- A must go in position 1, 4, or 5 (but 4 is already I, so 1 or 5)
- S must go in positions 2, 3, or 4 (but 4 is already I, so 2 or 3)

But we also need a fifth letter that hasn’t been ruled out yet. The remaining common consonants are: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, etc.

Let’s try to fit A and S into the remaining slots while introducing a new consonant.

Option 1: A in position 1, S in position 2 or 3, plus one new consonant in the remaining slot.

Try “ACIDS”:
- A in 1 (allowed)
- C (new, allowed)

- D (new, allowed)
- S in 5 (but S cannot be in 5 from RAINS) ❌

Try “ASH” plus two more letters… but we need 5 letters.

- Has I in 4
- Has A and S in remaining slots (1, 2, 3, 5)
- A not in 2 or 3
- S not in 1 or 5
- No L, T, E, R, N

So possible positions:
A can be 1 or 5
S can be 2 or 3

Case 1: A in 1, S in 2 or 3
Word structure: A S _ I _  or  A _ S I _

Try “ASPIR” – R is out.

Try “ASIDE” – E is out.

Try “ASPIK” – K is new, but A in 1, S in 2, I in 4, P and K new.

But K is uncommon, let’s see if it’s valid.

“ASPIK” is a valid word (a type of plant).

But let’s see if we can find a more common word.

Try “ASPIR” – R out.

Try “ASPIK” seems the only option here.

But let’s check Case 2: A in 5, S in 2 or 3
Structure: _ S _ I A  or  _ _ S I A

Try “BASIC” – C is new, B is new, A in 5, S in 2, I in 4.

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: L, T, E, R, N, B

Exact position feedback so far:

- I is in position 4 (from RAINS) and must stay there.
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from RAINS and BASIC).
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (from SLATE, RAINS, BASIC).
- C is in the word but NOT in position 5 (from BASIC).

So the only remaining possible positions are:
- A must be in position 1 (since 2,3,5 are excluded and 4 is I).
- S must be in position 3 (since 1,2,4,5 are excluded).
- C must be in position 1, 2, or 3, but position 1 is already A, so 2 or 3. Position 3 is S, so C must be in position 2.

Thus the word structure is: A C S I _

We need one more letter that hasn't been ruled out yet. The remaining letters (not in {L,T,E,R,N,B}) include D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

The only 5-letter word that fits this pattern is ""ACIS_"" – but we need a valid word. The only common word that fits is ""ACIDS"".
