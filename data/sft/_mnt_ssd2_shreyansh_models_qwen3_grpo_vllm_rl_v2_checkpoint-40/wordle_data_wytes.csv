For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The goal is to maximize information gain by covering frequently used vowels and consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English:
- Most common letters: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C
- Good first guesses often include 2-3 vowels and common consonants

Popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent in English

From the feedback on AROSE:

- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.
- S is not in position 4, and E is not in position 5.

I need a new word that:
1. Uses S and E.
2. Avoids A, R, O.
3. Puts S somewhere other than position 4 and E somewhere other than position 5.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out).

Let me try ""STEIN"":
- S in position 1 (allowed, since S can't be in position 4)
- T, I, N are new letters
- E in position 4 (allowed, since E can't be in position 5)

This covers new letters while respecting the constraints.

Current constraints:

- T cannot be in position 2 (from STEIN).

Let's consolidate what we now know:

Letters NOT in the word (marked “x” at least once):
A, R, O, I, N, L

Letters that ARE in the word (at least one each) and their status:
- S – in the word but wrong positions so far: positions 1, 2, 3, 4 have all been tried (AROSE, STEIN, ESTLY), so S must be in position 5.
- E – in the word but wrong positions so far: positions 1, 3, 5 have all been tried, so E must be in position 2 or 4.
- T – confirmed in position 3 (✓ from ESTLY).
- Y – in the word but wrong position (position 5 in ESTLY), so Y must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. But positions 3 is T, so Y must be in 1, 2, or 4.

So far the word looks like: _ _ T _ _ with:
- S fixed in position 5: _ _ T _ S
- E must be in position 2 or 4
- Y must be in position 1, 2, or 4

Let’s try to place E and Y:

Option 1: E in position 2, Y in position 1 or 4
- Y E T _ S → YET_S → need a valid 5-letter word: YET?S – but “YET” is 3 letters, so “YETES” is invalid (contains E twice, but we don’t know if E is allowed twice). Actually, “YETES” is a valid word (plural of yew-trees), but let’s check constraints: Y E T E S – E appears twice, which is allowed unless we know otherwise. However, we have only one E confirmed so far, so this might be risky.

Option 2: E in position 4, Y in position 1 or 2
- Y _ T E S → Y _ T E S → need a valid word: Y A T E S – but A is forbidden. Y U T E S – “YUTES” is a valid word (plural of yute). Check constraints: Y U T E S – letters are Y, U, T, E, S. None of A, R, O, I, N, L appear. This looks good.

Option 3: E in position 2, Y in position 4 → _ E T Y S – but “ETYS” is not a valid word.

So the best candidate is “YUTES”.

Let me verify:
- Word: YUTES (valid 5-letter word)
- Contains S (position 5), E (position 4), T (position 3) – all required
- No forbidden letters A, R, O, I, N, L
- S is in correct position 5 (since all other positions for S have been ruled out)
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since previous E positions 1,3,5 are ruled out)
- T is in correct position 3
- Y is in position 1 (allowed, since previous Y position 5 is ruled out)

Thus, “YUTES” is the logical next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The goal is to maximize information gain by covering frequently used vowels and consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English:
- Most common letters: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C
- Good first guesses often include 2-3 vowels and common consonants

Popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent in English

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.
- S is not in position 4, and E is not in position 5.

I need a new word that:
1. Uses S and E.
2. Avoids A, R, O.
3. Puts S somewhere other than position 4 and E somewhere other than position 5.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out).

Let me try ""STEIN"":
- S in position 1 (allowed, since S can't be in position 4)
- T, I, N are new letters
- E in position 4 (allowed, since E can't be in position 5)

This covers new letters while respecting the constraints.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, I, N (from the “x” marks).  
Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong positions so far): S, E, T (all marked “-”).

Current constraints:
- Must contain S, E, T.
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (from AROSE and STEIN).
- E cannot be in positions 3 or 5 (from AROSE and STEIN).
- T cannot be in position 2 (from STEIN).
- Cannot contain A, R, O, I, N.

Remaining common letters to try: L, C, D, P, M, U, Y, etc.

Let’s place the known letters:
- S must be in 2, 3, or 5.
- E must be in 1, 2, or 4.
- T must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.

A promising pattern:  
Put S in position 2, E in position 1, and T in position 3 or 4, then fill with allowed consonants.

Try “E” + “S” + “T” + _ + _  
→ “EST__”  
Allowed consonants left: L, C, D, P, M, etc.

“ESTER” contains R (forbidden).  
“ESTOP” contains O (forbidden).  
“ESTLY” uses L and Y (both allowed).  
“ESTLY” is a valid 5-letter word.

Let’s check positions:
- E in 1: allowed (E not forbidden in 1).  
- S in 2: allowed (S not forbidden in 2).  
- T in 3: allowed (T not forbidden in 3).  
- L and Y: new letters, no conflicts.

So “ESTLY” satisfies all constraints.

- S – in the word but wrong positions so far: positions 1, 2, 3, 4 have all been tried (AROSE, STEIN, ESTLY), so S must be in position 5.
- E – in the word but wrong positions so far: positions 1, 3, 5 have all been tried, so E must be in position 2 or 4.
- T – confirmed in position 3 (✓ from ESTLY).
- Y – in the word but wrong position (position 5 in ESTLY), so Y must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. But positions 3 is T, so Y must be in 1, 2, or 4.

So far the word looks like: _ _ T _ _ with:
- S fixed in position 5: _ _ T _ S
- E must be in position 2 or 4
- Y must be in position 1, 2, or 4

Let’s try to place E and Y:

Option 1: E in position 2, Y in position 1 or 4
- Y E T _ S → YET_S → need a valid 5-letter word: YET?S – but “YET” is 3 letters, so “YETES” is invalid (contains E twice, but we don’t know if E is allowed twice). Actually, “YETES” is a valid word (plural of yew-trees), but let’s check constraints: Y E T E S – E appears twice, which is allowed unless we know otherwise. However, we have only one E confirmed so far, so this might be risky.

Option 2: E in position 4, Y in position 1 or 2
- Y _ T E S → Y _ T E S → need a valid word: Y A T E S – but A is forbidden. Y U T E S – “YUTES” is a valid word (plural of yute). Check constraints: Y U T E S – letters are Y, U, T, E, S. None of A, R, O, I, N, L appear. This looks good.

Option 3: E in position 2, Y in position 4 → _ E T Y S – but “ETYS” is not a valid word.

So the best candidate is “YUTES”.

Let me verify:
- Word: YUTES (valid 5-letter word)
- Contains S (position 5), E (position 4), T (position 3) – all required
- No forbidden letters A, R, O, I, N, L
- S is in correct position 5 (since all other positions for S have been ruled out)
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since previous E positions 1,3,5 are ruled out)
- T is in correct position 3
- Y is in position 1 (allowed, since previous Y position 5 is ruled out)

Thus, “YUTES” is the logical next guess.

Looking at the pattern _ T E S, and allowed letters (no A,R,O,I,N,L,U,Y), the only common English word is:

“W” + “T” + “E” + “S” → “WTES” – invalid.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The goal is to maximize information gain by covering frequently used vowels and consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English:
- Most common letters: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C
- Good first guesses often include 2-3 vowels and common consonants

Popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent in English

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|>

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.
- S is not in position 4, and E is not in position 5.

I need a new word that:
1. Uses S and E.
2. Avoids A, R, O.
3. Puts S somewhere other than position 4 and E somewhere other than position 5.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out).

Let me try ""STEIN"":
- S in position 1 (allowed, since S can't be in position 4)
- T, I, N are new letters
- E in position 4 (allowed, since E can't be in position 5)

This covers new letters while respecting the constraints.

Guess 2: STEIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) E(-) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, I, N (from the “x” marks).  
Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong positions so far): S, E, T (all marked “-”).

Current constraints:
- Must contain S, E, T.
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (from AROSE and STEIN).
- E cannot be in positions 3 or 5 (from AROSE and STEIN).
- T cannot be in position 2 (from STEIN).
- Cannot contain A, R, O, I, N.

Remaining common letters to try: L, C, D, P, M, U, Y, etc.

Let’s place the known letters:
- S must be in 2, 3, or 5.
- E must be in 1, 2, or 4.
- T must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.

A promising pattern:  
Put S in position 2, E in position 1, and T in position 3 or 4, then fill with allowed consonants.

Try “E” + “S” + “T” + _ + _  
→ “EST__”  
Allowed consonants left: L, C, D, P, M, etc.

“ESTER” contains R (forbidden).  
“ESTOP” contains O (forbidden).  
“ESTLY” uses L and Y (both allowed).  
“ESTLY” is a valid 5-letter word.

Let’s check positions:
- E in 1: allowed (E not forbidden in 1).  
- S in 2: allowed (S not forbidden in 2).  
- T in 3: allowed (T not forbidden in 3).  
- L and Y: new letters, no conflicts.

So “ESTLY” satisfies all constraints.

Let's consolidate what we now know:

Letters NOT in the word (marked “x” at least once):
A, R, O, I, N, L

Letters that ARE in the word (at least one each) and their status:
- S – in the word but wrong positions so far: positions 1, 2, 3, 4 have all been tried (AROSE, STEIN, ESTLY), so S must be in position 5.
- E – in the word but wrong positions so far: positions 1, 3, 5 have all been tried, so E must be in position 2 or 4.
- T – confirmed in position 3 (✓ from ESTLY).
- Y – in the word but wrong position (position 5 in ESTLY), so Y must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. But positions 3 is T, so Y must be in 1, 2, or 4.

So far the word looks like: _ _ T _ _ with:
- S fixed in position 5: _ _ T _ S
- E must be in position 2 or 4
- Y must be in position 1, 2, or 4

Let’s try to place E and Y:

Option 1: E in position 2, Y in position 1 or 4
- Y E T _ S → YET_S → need a valid 5-letter word: YET?S – but “YET” is 3 letters, so “YETES” is invalid (contains E twice, but we don’t know if E is allowed twice). Actually, “YETES” is a valid word (plural of yew-trees), but let’s check constraints: Y E T E S – E appears twice, which is allowed unless we know otherwise. However, we have only one E confirmed so far, so this might be risky.

Option 2: E in position 4, Y in position 1 or 2
- Y _ T E S → Y _ T E S → need a valid word: Y A T E S – but A is forbidden. Y U T E S – “YUTES” is a valid word (plural of yute). Check constraints: Y U T E S – letters are Y, U, T, E, S. None of A, R, O, I, N, L appear. This looks good.

Option 3: E in position 2, Y in position 4 → _ E T Y S – but “ETYS” is not a valid word.

So the best candidate is “YUTES”.

Let me verify:
- Word: YUTES (valid 5-letter word)
- Contains S (position 5), E (position 4), T (position 3) – all required
- No forbidden letters A, R, O, I, N, L
- S is in correct position 5 (since all other positions for S have been ruled out)
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since previous E positions 1,3,5 are ruled out)
- T is in correct position 3
- Y is in position 1 (allowed, since previous Y position 5 is ruled out)

Thus, “YUTES” is the logical next guess.

Looking for valid 5-letter English words ending in TES with no forbidden letters.

The only standard Scrabble/Wordle word fitting this is “CREST” or “BREST”, but R is ruled out.

Next possible: “DREST” – invalid  
“FREST” – invalid  
“GREST” – invalid  
“KREST” – invalid  
“MREST” – invalid  
“PREST” – R is ruled out  
“VREST” – invalid  

Wait, let’s check “JETES” – invalid  
“ZETES” – invalid  
“XETES” – invalid  

Actually, the only remaining valid word is “METES” (archaic but listed in dictionaries), but it’s rare.

However, “WREST” contains R (forbidden).

Rechecking: we missed “G” + “E” + “T” + “E” + “S” = “GETES” – invalid.

After careful consideration, the only plausible word left is “METES”, but it’s uncommon.

But standard Wordle lists “METES”.

Thus, the correct guess is “METES”.

Constraints check:
- M: allowed  
- E in position 2: allowed (only ruled out in position 2 for E in HETES, but HETES had E in position 2 marked “-”, so E can be in position 2)  
- T in 3, E in 4, S in 5 confirmed.

But wait: in HETES, E in position 2 was marked “-”, meaning E is NOT in position 2. Thus E must be elsewhere, but positions 1,3,5 are taken by other letters. This suggests inconsistency.

Re-evaluate: the word must be _ _ T E S with E only in positions 4 and 5, but 5 is S. Thus E must be in 4, which is already confirmed.

Looking again, the only possible valid word is “BETES” – but B is allowed, and “BETES” is a valid word (plural of bete, a French word for “thicket”), and B hasn’t been ruled out.

Thus, “BETES” is the correct guess.
