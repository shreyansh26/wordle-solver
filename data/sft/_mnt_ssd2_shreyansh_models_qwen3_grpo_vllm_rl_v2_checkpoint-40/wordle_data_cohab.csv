For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. The best opening words typically:
1. Use common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Include common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. Avoid repeating letters
4. Cover different positions

After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", and ""RAISE"", I think ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- It has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are unique
- It covers 5 different positions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. The best opening words typically:
1. Use common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Include common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. Avoid repeating letters
4. Cover different positions

After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", and ""RAISE"", I think ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- It has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are unique
- It covers 5 different positions

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st)
- R(x): R is NOT in the word
- O(-): O is in the word but in the wrong position (not 3rd)
- S(x): S is NOT in the word
- E(x): E is NOT in the word

So we know:
- Letters to exclude: R, S, E
- Letters to keep: A, O (but not in positions 1 or 3 respectively)

Next, I want to:
1. Keep A and O in new positions
2. Introduce new common consonants (T, L, N, etc.)
3. Avoid the excluded letters

A good candidate is ""TOADY"":
- T (new consonant)
- O (known in word, now in 2nd position)
- A (known in word, now in 3rd position)
- D (new consonant)
- Y (new vowel-like consonant)

This tests new positions for A and O while introducing useful new letters.

From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.
   - R, S, E are NOT in the word.

2. TOADY → T(x) O(✓) A(-) D(x) Y(x)
   - O is in position 2 and that is correct.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - T, D, Y are NOT in the word.

So we now know:
- O is in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in positions 1 or 3 (so it must be in 4 or 5).
- Letters definitely excluded so far: R, S, E, T, D, Y.
- Remaining common letters to try: N, L, C, M, P, B, G, H, I, U.

I want a word that:
- Has O in position 2.
- Has A in position 4 or 5.
- Uses new, common letters not yet tested.

A good candidate is ""CONGA"":
- C (new consonant)
- O (must be in position 2)
- N (new consonant)
- G (new consonant)
- A (must be in position 4 or 5; here it's in 4)

Let's check positions:
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- A is in position 4 (new position, allowed)
- C, N, G are new letters.

This should give us good information about A's position and test new consonants.

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (from later feedback).
   - Therefore A must be in position 2.
   - O is in the word but not in positions 2, 3 (from later feedback).
   - Therefore O must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

2. TOADY → T(x) O(✓) A(-) D(x) Y(x)
   - O is in position 2 (✓) – but this contradicts the above conclusion that O cannot be in position 2.

Wait, let's re-examine the feedback carefully:

From Guess 2 (TOADY):
- O(✓) means O is in position 2 and correct.
- A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 3.

From Guess 3 (CONGA):
- A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 5.

From Guess 4 (COBIA):
- B(-) means B is in the word but not in position 3.
- A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 5.

So combining:
- A is in the word but not in positions 1, 3, 5 (from AROSE, TOADY, COBIA).
- Therefore A must be in position 2 or 4.
- O is in position 2 (✓ from TOADY), so A must be in position 4.
- So the word structure is: _ O _ _ A.

Letters excluded so far:
R, S, E, T, D, Y, N, G, I.

Remaining common letters: B, C, F, H, K, L, M, P, U, W.

From Guess 4 (COBIA):
- C(✓) means C is in position 1.
- So word structure is: C O _ _ A.

Now we need to fill positions 3 and 4 with letters not yet used.
Possible letters: B, F, H, K, L, M, P, U, W.

Looking for common words:
C O B _ A → COBRA (but R is excluded)
C O F _ A → COFIA (invalid)
C O H _ A → COHAA (invalid)
C O K _ A → COKIA (invalid)
C O L _ A → COLPA (invalid)
C O M _ A → COMAA (invalid)
C O P _ A → COPRA (R excluded)
C O U _ A → COUAA (invalid)
C O W _ A → COWPA (invalid)

Hmm, none seem valid. Let's try different approach:
From Guess 4, B is in the word but not in position 3. So B could be in position 4.
Then word structure: C O _ B A.

Looking for common words:
C O M B A → COMBA (valid word, but is it English? Maybe)
C O L B A → COLBA (invalid)
C O P B A → COPBA (invalid)

Alternatively, maybe position 3 is F:
C O F _ A → need a letter for position 4, but A is already in 4.

Wait, structure is C O _ _ A with A in position 4:
C O _ A _

And B must be in the word but not in position 3, so B could be in position 3 or 4, but 4 is A, so B must be in position 3.

Thus: C O B A _

Now need a letter for position 5, not yet used: from remaining letters (F, H, K, L, M, P, U, W).

Possible words:
C O B A F → COBAF (invalid)
C O B A H → COBAH (invalid)
C O B A K → COBAK (invalid)
C O B A L → COBAL (invalid)
C O B A M → COBAM (invalid)
C O B A P → COBAP (invalid)
C O B A U → COBAU (invalid)
C O B A W → COBAW (invalid)

This suggests my assumption might be wrong. Let me re-examine:

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
A(-) means A is in word but not position 1.
O(-) means O is in word but not position 3.

From Guess 2 (TOADY):
O(✓) means O is in position 2.
A(-) means A is in word but not position 3.

From Guess 3 (CONGA):
A(-) means A is in word but not position 5.

From Guess 4 (COBIA):
C(✓) means C is in position 1.
O(✓) means O is in position 2 (already known).
B(-) means B is in word but not position 3.
A(-) means A is in word but not position 5.

So:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: O
- A must be in position 3 or 4 (not 1, 2, 5).
- B must be in word but not position 3, so B could be position 4 or 5.
- Letters excluded: R, S, E, T, D, Y, N, G, I.

Possible structures:
1. C O A _ _
   - Then B must be in position 4 or 5.
   - Possible: C O A B _ or C O A _ B.
   - Need letters for remaining positions from: F, H, K, L, M, P, U, W.

   C O A B F → COABF (invalid)
   C O A B H → COABH (invalid)
   C O A B K → COABK (invalid)
   C O A B L → COABL (invalid)
   C O A B M → COABM (invalid)
   C O A B P → COABP (invalid)
   C O A B U → COABU (invalid)
   C O A B W → COABW (invalid)

   C O A _ B → need letter for position 4.
   C O A F B → COAFB (invalid)
   C O A H B → COAHB (invalid)
   C O A K B → COAKB (invalid)

   C O A M B → COAMB (invalid)
   C O A P B → COAPB (invalid)
   C O A U B → COAUB (invalid)
   C O A W B → COAWB (invalid)

2. C O _ A _
   - Then B must be in position 3 or 5 (but not 3 from B(-) in Guess 4).
   - So B must be in position 5.
   - Structure: C O _ A B.
   - Need letter for position 3 from remaining: F, H, K, L, M, P, U, W.

   C O F A B → COFAB (invalid)
   C O H A B → COHAB (valid word!)
   C O K A B → COKAB (invalid)
   C O L A B → COLAB (invalid)
   C O M A B → COMAB (invalid)
   C O P A B → COPAB (invalid)
   C O U A B → COUAB (invalid)
   C O W A B → COWAB (invalid)

""HAB"" is a valid ending, ""COHAB"" is a valid word (though rare, it's listed).

Thus, the most likely word is COHAB.

</think>

From all feedback, the word must be C O _ A B, and the only valid English word fitting is ""COHAB"".

<guess>COHAB</guess>",COHAB,"From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (from later feedback).
   - Therefore A must be in position 2.
   - O is in the word but not in positions 2, 3 (from later feedback).
   - Therefore O must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

2. TOADY → T(x) O(✓) A(-) D(x) Y(x)
   - O is in position 2 (✓) – but this contradicts the above conclusion that O cannot be in position 2.

Wait, let's re-examine the feedback carefully:

From Guess 2 (TOADY):
- O(✓) means O is in position 2 and correct.
- A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 3.

From Guess 3 (CONGA):
- A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 5.

From Guess 4 (COBIA):
- B(-) means B is in the word but not in position 3.
- A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 5.

So combining:
- A is in the word but not in positions 1, 3, 5 (from AROSE, TOADY, COBIA).
- Therefore A must be in position 2 or 4.
- O is in position 2 (✓ from TOADY), so A must be in position 4.
- So the word structure is: _ O _ _ A.

Letters excluded so far:
R, S, E, T, D, Y, N, G, I.

Remaining common letters: B, C, F, H, K, L, M, P, U, W.

From Guess 4 (COBIA):
- C(✓) means C is in position 1.
- So word structure is: C O _ _ A.

Now we need to fill positions 3 and 4 with letters not yet used.
Possible letters: B, F, H, K, L, M, P, U, W.

Looking for common words:
C O B _ A → COBRA (but R is excluded)
C O F _ A → COFIA (invalid)
C O H _ A → COHAA (invalid)
C O K _ A → COKIA (invalid)
C O L _ A → COLPA (invalid)
C O M _ A → COMAA (invalid)
C O P _ A → COPRA (R excluded)
C O U _ A → COUAA (invalid)
C O W _ A → COWPA (invalid)

Hmm, none seem valid. Let's try different approach:
From Guess 4, B is in the word but not in position 3. So B could be in position 4.
Then word structure: C O _ B A.

Looking for common words:
C O M B A → COMBA (valid word, but is it English? Maybe)
C O L B A → COLBA (invalid)
C O P B A → COPBA (invalid)

Alternatively, maybe position 3 is F:
C O F _ A → need a letter for position 4, but A is already in 4.

Wait, structure is C O _ _ A with A in position 4:
C O _ A _

And B must be in the word but not in position 3, so B could be in position 3 or 4, but 4 is A, so B must be in position 3.

Thus: C O B A _

Now need a letter for position 5, not yet used: from remaining letters (F, H, K, L, M, P, U, W).

Possible words:
C O B A F → COBAF (invalid)
C O B A H → COBAH (invalid)
C O B A K → COBAK (invalid)
C O B A L → COBAL (invalid)
C O B A M → COBAM (invalid)
C O B A P → COBAP (invalid)
C O B A U → COBAU (invalid)
C O B A W → COBAW (invalid)

This suggests my assumption might be wrong. Let me re-examine:

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
A(-) means A is in word but not position 1.
O(-) means O is in word but not position 3.

From Guess 2 (TOADY):
O(✓) means O is in position 2.
A(-) means A is in word but not position 3.

From Guess 3 (CONGA):
A(-) means A is in word but not position 5.

From Guess 4 (COBIA):
C(✓) means C is in position 1.
O(✓) means O is in position 2 (already known).
B(-) means B is in word but not position 3.
A(-) means A is in word but not position 5.

So:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: O
- A must be in position 3 or 4 (not 1, 2, 5).
- B must be in word but not position 3, so B could be position 4 or 5.
- Letters excluded: R, S, E, T, D, Y, N, G, I.

Possible structures:
1. C O A _ _
   - Then B must be in position 4 or 5.
   - Possible: C O A B _ or C O A _ B.
   - Need letters for remaining positions from: F, H, K, L, M, P, U, W.

   C O A B F → COABF (invalid)
   C O A B H → COABH (invalid)
   C O A B K → COABK (invalid)
   C O A B L → COABL (invalid)
   C O A B M → COABM (invalid)
   C O A B P → COABP (invalid)
   C O A B U → COABU (invalid)
   C O A B W → COABW (invalid)

   C O A _ B → need letter for position 4.
   C O A F B → COAFB (invalid)
   C O A H B → COAHB (invalid)
   C O A K B → COAKB (invalid)
   C O A L B → COALB (invalid)
   C O A M B → COAMB (invalid)
   C O A P B → COAPB (invalid)
   C O A U B → COAUB (invalid)
   C O A W B → COAWB (invalid)

2. C O _ A _
   - Then B must be in position 3 or 5 (but not 3 from B(-) in Guess 4).
   - So B must be in position 5.
   - Structure: C O _ A B.
   - Need letter for position 3 from remaining: F, H, K, L, M, P, U, W.

   C O F A B → COFAB (invalid)
   C O H A B → COHAB (valid word!)
   C O K A B → COKAB (invalid)
   C O L A B → COLAB (invalid)
   C O M A B → COMAB (invalid)
   C O P A B → COPAB (invalid)
   C O U A B → COUAB (invalid)
   C O W A B → COWAB (invalid)

""HAB"" is a valid ending, ""COHAB"" is a valid word (though rare, it's listed).

Thus, the most likely word is COHAB.From all feedback, the word must be C O _ A B, and the only valid English word fitting is ""COHAB"".",Guess 5: COHAB -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) H(✓) A(✓) B(✓),SUCCESS
