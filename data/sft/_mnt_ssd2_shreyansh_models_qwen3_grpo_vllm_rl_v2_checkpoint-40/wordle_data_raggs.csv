Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A strong opening word should contain several of these high-frequency letters. Some popular choices include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters and gives good coverage across different positions.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word (but in unknown positions):
- S (cannot be in position 1 or 2)
- A (cannot be in position 3 or 4)
- R (cannot be in position 5)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
L, T, E, O, N

So the remaining alphabet that could appear is:  
B C D F G H I J K M P Q U V W X Y Z  
plus the three known letters S, A, R.

We need a 5-letter word that uses only letters from the “allowed” set, contains S, A, R each exactly once, and respects the positional exclusions above.

A good next step is to pick a word that places S, A, R in fresh positions and introduces two new high-frequency consonants that haven’t been ruled out.  
Looking at the still-allowed common letters: C, D, I, K, M, P, U, etc.

Candidate words:
- CRASH – C and H are allowed, but H is low-frequency.
- DISKS – repeats S, which is inefficient.
- PRAYS – Y is allowed; P, R, A, Y, S – all allowed letters, and positions:
  – S in 5 (allowed, since S was only excluded from 1 and 2)
  – A in 3 (allowed, since A was only excluded from 3 and 4 in earlier guesses? Wait no: A was excluded from 3 in SLATE and from 4 in SONAR, so 3 is still excluded. So A cannot be in 3. So PRAYS is invalid.)
- CRISP – repeats P, and we already know P is allowed but we’d rather test new letters.

Better: pick a word that uses S, A, R plus two fresh letters, and places them in allowable spots.

Let’s try:
- S in 3, 4 or 5 (allowed: 3 excluded, 4 excluded, so 5 is allowed for S)
- A in 1, 2 or 5 (allowed: 1, 2, 5)
- R in 1, 2, 3, 4 (allowed: 1 excluded, 2 excluded, 3, 4 allowed)

A good combination is to put S in 5, A in 1, R in 2 or 3, and fill the rest with new letters.

Example: A R _ _ S – but we need 5 letters.

Let’s try “RASPY”:
- R (allowed in 1? No, R was excluded from 5 in SONAR, but that doesn’t exclude 1. Actually R was only excluded from 5, so 1 is allowed.)
- A (allowed in 2? Yes, A was excluded from 3 and 4, so 2 is allowed)
- S (allowed in 5? Yes, S was excluded from 1 and 2, so 5 is allowed)
- P and Y are new allowed letters.

But “RASPY” is 5 letters: R A S P Y → positions 1-5.

Let’s check:
- S is in 3? No, it’s in 5 – allowed.
- A is in 2 – allowed.
- R is in 1 – allowed.
- P and Y are new.

This seems valid.

Another candidate: “SCRAP” – but C is allowed, but P is okay, but A is in 4 which is excluded.

“SKARP” – K is allowed, but A is in 4 excluded.

“PARMS” – A in 2 allowed, R in 1 allowed, S in 5 allowed, P and M new.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A strong opening word should contain several of these high-frequency letters. Some popular choices include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""SONAR"" because:
- S is in position 2 (valid, since position 1 is excluded)
- A is in position 4 (valid, since position 3 is excluded)
- Contains common letters O, N, R
- Doesn't contain L, T, or E

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word (but in unknown positions):
- S (cannot be in position 1 or 2)
- A (cannot be in position 3 or 4)
- R (cannot be in position 5)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
L, T, E, O, N

So the remaining alphabet that could appear is:  
B C D F G H I J K M P Q U V W X Y Z  
plus the three known letters S, A, R.

We need a 5-letter word that uses only letters from the “allowed” set, contains S, A, R each exactly once, and respects the positional exclusions above.

A good next step is to pick a word that places S, A, R in fresh positions and introduces two new high-frequency consonants that haven’t been ruled out.  
Looking at the still-allowed common letters: C, D, I, K, M, P, U, etc.

Candidate words:
- CRASH – C and H are allowed, but H is low-frequency.
- DISKS – repeats S, which is inefficient.
- PRAYS – Y is allowed; P, R, A, Y, S – all allowed letters, and positions:
  – S in 5 (allowed, since S was only excluded from 1 and 2)
  – A in 3 (allowed, since A was only excluded from 3 and 4 in earlier guesses? Wait no: A was excluded from 3 in SLATE and from 4 in SONAR, so 3 is still excluded. So A cannot be in 3. So PRAYS is invalid.)
- CRISP – repeats P, and we already know P is allowed but we’d rather test new letters.

Better: pick a word that uses S, A, R plus two fresh letters, and places them in allowable spots.

Let’s try:
- S in 3, 4 or 5 (allowed: 3 excluded, 4 excluded, so 5 is allowed for S)
- A in 1, 2 or 5 (allowed: 1, 2, 5)
- R in 1, 2, 3, 4 (allowed: 1 excluded, 2 excluded, 3, 4 allowed)

A good combination is to put S in 5, A in 1, R in 2 or 3, and fill the rest with new letters.

Example: A R _ _ S – but we need 5 letters.

Let’s try “RASPY”:
- R (allowed in 1? No, R was excluded from 5 in SONAR, but that doesn’t exclude 1. Actually R was only excluded from 5, so 1 is allowed.)
- A (allowed in 2? Yes, A was excluded from 3 and 4, so 2 is allowed)
- S (allowed in 5? Yes, S was excluded from 1 and 2, so 5 is allowed)
- P and Y are new allowed letters.

But “RASPY” is 5 letters: R A S P Y → positions 1-5.

Let’s check:
- S is in 3? No, it’s in 5 – allowed.
- A is in 2 – allowed.
- R is in 1 – allowed.
- P and Y are new.

This seems valid.

Another candidate: “SCRAP” – but C is allowed, but P is okay, but A is in 4 which is excluded.

“SKARP” – K is allowed, but A is in 4 excluded.

“PARMS” – A in 2 allowed, R in 1 allowed, S in 5 allowed, P and M new.

I’ll go with “PARMS”.

From the three guesses we now have:

Known letters:
- A is in position 2 (✓)
- S is in position 5 (✓)

Known letters that are NOT in their current positions:
- R is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from PARMS feedback: R(-))
- S is NOT in positions 1 or 2 (from SLATE and SONAR)
- A is NOT in positions 3 or 4 (from SLATE and SONAR)

Letters known NOT in the word:
L, T, E, O, N, P, M

So the word looks like: _ A _ _ S with:
- R somewhere (but not position 3)
- No other constraints on remaining positions yet

Still-allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus R.

We need two more letters to fill positions 1 and 3 (position 4 is already determined by position 3 choice).

Since R must appear and can't be in position 3, possible R positions are 1 or 4.

Let's try R in position 1: R A _ _ S
We need two letters for positions 3 and 4 from the allowed set.

Common remaining letters: C, D, I, K, U, etc.

Candidate words:
- R A C K S → RACKS (valid word, uses C and K which are allowed)
- R A I N S → but N is excluded
- R A I D S → valid, uses D and I
- R A C U S → but U is allowed, but RACUS is a word (variant spelling)

Between RACKS and RACUS, RACKS is more common.

Let's check RACKS:
- R in 1: allowed (not excluded)
- A in 2: ✓
- C in 3: allowed
- K in 4: allowed
- S in 5: ✓
- No excluded letters used

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A strong opening word should contain several of these high-frequency letters. Some popular choices include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters and gives good coverage across different positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)

From the feedback on SLATE:

- S(-): the letter S is in the word but not in position 1  
- L(x): L is not in the word at all  
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 3  
- T(x): T is not in the word at all  
- E(x): E is not in the word at all  

So we know:
- The word contains S and A (but not in positions 1 or 3 respectively).
- The word does NOT contain L, T, or E.

We need a new word that:
1. Has S somewhere other than position 1.
2. Has A somewhere other than position 3.
3. Does not contain L, T, or E.

Good remaining high-frequency letters to try: R, O, N, I, C, U, D, etc.

Possible candidates:
- CRASH (but has H, which is less common)
- RADIO (but has D and O, and A is in position 3 which is invalid)
- SONAR (but has O and N, and A is in position 4 which is valid)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A strong opening word should contain several of these high-frequency letters. Some popular choices include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters and gives good coverage across different positions.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:

- S(-): the letter S is in the word but not in position 1  
- L(x): L is not in the word at all  
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 3  
- T(x): T is not in the word at all  
- E(x): E is not in the word at all  

So we know:
- The word contains S and A (but not in positions 1 or 3 respectively).
- The word does NOT contain L, T, or E.

We need a new word that:
1. Has S somewhere other than position 1.
2. Has A somewhere other than position 3.
3. Does not contain L, T, or E.

Good remaining high-frequency letters to try: R, O, N, I, C, U, D, etc.

Possible candidates:
- CRASH (but has H, which is less common)
- RADIO (but has D and O, and A is in position 3 which is invalid)
- SONAR (but has O and N, and A is in position 4 which is valid)
- SCARF (but has F, which is less common)

I'll choose ""SONAR"" because:
- S is in position 2 (valid, since position 1 is excluded)
- A is in position 4 (valid, since position 3 is excluded)
- Contains common letters O, N, R
- Doesn't contain L, T, or E

<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word (but in unknown positions):
- S (cannot be in position 1 or 2)
- A (cannot be in position 3 or 4)
- R (cannot be in position 5)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
L, T, E, O, N

So the remaining alphabet that could appear is:  
B C D F G H I J K M P Q U V W X Y Z  
plus the three known letters S, A, R.

We need a 5-letter word that uses only letters from the “allowed” set, contains S, A, R each exactly once, and respects the positional exclusions above.

A good next step is to pick a word that places S, A, R in fresh positions and introduces two new high-frequency consonants that haven’t been ruled out.  
Looking at the still-allowed common letters: C, D, I, K, M, P, U, etc.

Candidate words:
- CRASH – C and H are allowed, but H is low-frequency.
- DISKS – repeats S, which is inefficient.
- PRAYS – Y is allowed; P, R, A, Y, S – all allowed letters, and positions:
  – S in 5 (allowed, since S was only excluded from 1 and 2)
  – A in 3 (allowed, since A was only excluded from 3 and 4 in earlier guesses? Wait no: A was excluded from 3 in SLATE and from 4 in SONAR, so 3 is still excluded. So A cannot be in 3. So PRAYS is invalid.)
- CRISP – repeats P, and we already know P is allowed but we’d rather test new letters.

Better: pick a word that uses S, A, R plus two fresh letters, and places them in allowable spots.

Let’s try:
- S in 3, 4 or 5 (allowed: 3 excluded, 4 excluded, so 5 is allowed for S)
- A in 1, 2 or 5 (allowed: 1, 2, 5)
- R in 1, 2, 3, 4 (allowed: 1 excluded, 2 excluded, 3, 4 allowed)

A good combination is to put S in 5, A in 1, R in 2 or 3, and fill the rest with new letters.

Example: A R _ _ S – but we need 5 letters.

Let’s try “RASPY”:
- R (allowed in 1? No, R was excluded from 5 in SONAR, but that doesn’t exclude 1. Actually R was only excluded from 5, so 1 is allowed.)
- A (allowed in 2? Yes, A was excluded from 3 and 4, so 2 is allowed)
- S (allowed in 5? Yes, S was excluded from 1 and 2, so 5 is allowed)
- P and Y are new allowed letters.

But “RASPY” is 5 letters: R A S P Y → positions 1-5.

Let’s check:
- S is in 3? No, it’s in 5 – allowed.
- A is in 2 – allowed.
- R is in 1 – allowed.
- P and Y are new.

This seems valid.

Another candidate: “SCRAP” – but C is allowed, but P is okay, but A is in 4 which is excluded.

“SKARP” – K is allowed, but A is in 4 excluded.

“PARMS” – A in 2 allowed, R in 1 allowed, S in 5 allowed, P and M new.

I’ll go with “PARMS”.

From the three guesses we now have:

Known letters:
- A is in position 2 (✓)
- S is in position 5 (✓)

Known letters that are NOT in their current positions:
- R is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from PARMS feedback: R(-))
- S is NOT in positions 1 or 2 (from SLATE and SONAR)
- A is NOT in positions 3 or 4 (from SLATE and SONAR)

Letters known NOT in the word:
L, T, E, O, N, P, M

So the word looks like: _ A _ _ S with:
- R somewhere (but not position 3)
- No other constraints on remaining positions yet

Still-allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus R.

We need two more letters to fill positions 1 and 3 (position 4 is already determined by position 3 choice).

Since R must appear and can't be in position 3, possible R positions are 1 or 4.

Let's try R in position 1: R A _ _ S
We need two letters for positions 3 and 4 from the allowed set.

Common remaining letters: C, D, I, K, U, etc.

Candidate words:
- R A C K S → RACKS (valid word, uses C and K which are allowed)
- R A I N S → but N is excluded
- R A I D S → valid, uses D and I
- R A C U S → but U is allowed, but RACUS is a word (variant spelling)

Between RACKS and RACUS, RACKS is more common.

Let's check RACKS:
- R in 1: allowed (not excluded)
- A in 2: ✓
- C in 3: allowed
- K in 4: allowed
- S in 5: ✓
- No excluded letters used

From the five guesses we now have:

2. A(✓) in position 2  
3. G(✓) in position 3  
4. _ in position 4 (U is excluded)  
5. S(✓) in position 5  

So the word is: R A G _ S

We know:
- Letters NOT in the word: L, T, E, O, N, P, M, C, K, U  
- The only remaining letter to determine is position 4.  
- Still-allowed letters: B, D, F, H, I, J, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form R A G _ S.  
The only common English word that fits is RAGDS (rags), but D is allowed and S is already fixed at the end.  
Another possibility is RAGIS (variant spelling), but RAGIS is not standard.  
The most likely and valid word is RAGDS (rags).  

Let’s verify:
- R A G D S  
- All letters are allowed.  
- Meets all positional constraints.  
- Valid English word (plural of rag).

Thus, the only logical choice is RAGDS.
