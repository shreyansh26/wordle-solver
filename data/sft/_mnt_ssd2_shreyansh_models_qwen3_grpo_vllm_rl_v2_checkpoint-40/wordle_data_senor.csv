For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English

This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and will likely reveal several letters that are in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x).
- R, O, S, E are all in the word but in wrong positions (-).

So the secret word contains the letters R, O, S, E, and one more letter that we haven’t tested yet.  
Since A is out, the remaining vowels we haven’t tried are I and U.  
We also know the consonants we haven’t tried yet include B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next guess should:
1. Include R, O, S, E in new positions.
2. Introduce one new letter (ideally a common one).
3. Avoid A.

One strong candidate is “STORE”:
- It reuses S, T, O, R, E.
- T is a very common consonant we haven’t tried.
- It keeps R, O, S, E but shifts their positions.

Another candidate is “ROSES”:
- Keeps R, O, S, E but repeats S, which wastes a letter.

“STORY” is also good but uses Y instead of T.

I’ll go with “STORE” because it introduces T and shifts all known letters to new positions.

2. STORE → S(✓) T(x) O(-) R(-) E(-)
   - S is in the correct 1st position.
   - T is NOT in the word.
   - O, R, E are still in the word but wrong positions.

So far we know:
- The word starts with S.
- It contains R, O, E somewhere in positions 2-5.
- It does NOT contain A or T.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S.
- Contains R, O, E (each exactly once, since they only appeared once in guesses).
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (so no A, T).

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We have 3 letters to place (R, O, E) in positions 2-5, and one more letter to introduce (must be from remaining pool).

Let’s try to place R, O, E in new positions:

- Position 2: could be R, O, E
- Position 3: could be R, O, E
- Position 4: could be R, O, E
- Position 5: could be R, O, E

We also need one more distinct letter. Common remaining letters: N, L, D, C, etc.

Candidate words:
- S _ R O E → SRO_E → but we need a valid word.
- S O _ R E → SO_RE → possible: SORER (but repeats R), SOPER (but P not ruled out), etc.
- S R _ O E → SR_OE → possible: SRO_E (invalid), etc.
- S _ O R E → S O R E _ → possible: SORER (invalid), SOPER (invalid), etc.

Looking for valid English words:
- SPORE: S(✓), P(new), R, O, E. This fits all constraints: starts with S, contains R, O, E, introduces P (not yet tested), and no A/T.
- SHARE: but A is out.
- SHORE: introduces H (valid), contains R, O, E.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English

This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and will likely reveal several letters that are in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x).
- R, O, S, E are all in the word but in wrong positions (-).

So the secret word contains the letters R, O, S, E, and one more letter that we haven’t tested yet.  
Since A is out, the remaining vowels we haven’t tried are I and U.  
We also know the consonants we haven’t tried yet include B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next guess should:
1. Include R, O, S, E in new positions.
2. Introduce one new letter (ideally a common one).
3. Avoid A.

One strong candidate is “STORE”:
- It reuses S, T, O, R, E.
- T is a very common consonant we haven’t tried.
- It keeps R, O, S, E but shifts their positions.

Another candidate is “ROSES”:
- Keeps R, O, S, E but repeats S, which wastes a letter.

“STORY” is also good but uses Y instead of T.

I’ll go with “STORE” because it introduces T and shifts all known letters to new positions.

Guess 2: STORE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) O(-) R(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(-)
   - Letters in word: R, O, S, E (all wrong positions)
   - A is NOT in the word.

2. STORE → S(✓) T(x) O(-) R(-) E(-)
   - S is in the correct 1st position.
   - T is NOT in the word.
   - O, R, E are still in the word but wrong positions.

So far we know:
- The word starts with S.
- It contains R, O, E somewhere in positions 2-5.
- It does NOT contain A or T.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S.
- Contains R, O, E (each exactly once, since they only appeared once in guesses).
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (so no A, T).

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We have 3 letters to place (R, O, E) in positions 2-5, and one more letter to introduce (must be from remaining pool).

Let’s try to place R, O, E in new positions:

- Position 2: could be R, O, E
- Position 3: could be R, O, E
- Position 4: could be R, O, E
- Position 5: could be R, O, E

We also need one more distinct letter. Common remaining letters: N, L, D, C, etc.

Candidate words:
- S _ R O E → SRO_E → but we need a valid word.
- S O _ R E → SO_RE → possible: SORER (but repeats R), SOPER (but P not ruled out), etc.
- S R _ O E → SR_OE → possible: SRO_E (invalid), etc.
- S _ O R E → S O R E _ → possible: SORER (invalid), SOPER (invalid), etc.

Looking for valid English words:
- SPORE: S(✓), P(new), R, O, E. This fits all constraints: starts with S, contains R, O, E, introduces P (not yet tested), and no A/T.
- SHARE: but A is out.
- SHORE: introduces H (valid), contains R, O, E.

Between SPORE and SHORE:
- SPORE introduces P (common).
- SHORE introduces H (common).

Both are valid, but SPORE seems slightly better as P is a common consonant.

Let’s go with SPORE.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English

This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and will likely reveal several letters that are in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x).
- R, O, S, E are all in the word but in wrong positions (-).

So the secret word contains the letters R, O, S, E, and one more letter that we haven’t tested yet.  
Since A is out, the remaining vowels we haven’t tried are I and U.  
We also know the consonants we haven’t tried yet include B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next guess should:
1. Include R, O, S, E in new positions.
2. Introduce one new letter (ideally a common one).
3. Avoid A.

One strong candidate is “STORE”:
- It reuses S, T, O, R, E.
- T is a very common consonant we haven’t tried.
- It keeps R, O, S, E but shifts their positions.

Another candidate is “ROSES”:
- Keeps R, O, S, E but repeats S, which wastes a letter.

“STORY” is also good but uses Y instead of T.

I’ll go with “STORE” because it introduces T and shifts all known letters to new positions.

Guess 2: STORE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) O(-) R(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(-)
   - Letters in word: R, O, S, E (all wrong positions)
   - A is NOT in the word.

2. STORE → S(✓) T(x) O(-) R(-) E(-)
   - S is in the correct 1st position.
   - T is NOT in the word.
   - O, R, E are still in the word but wrong positions.

So far we know:
- The word starts with S.
- It contains R, O, E somewhere in positions 2-5.
- It does NOT contain A or T.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S.
- Contains R, O, E (each exactly once, since they only appeared once in guesses).
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (so no A, T).

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We have 3 letters to place (R, O, E) in positions 2-5, and one more letter to introduce (must be from remaining pool).

Let’s try to place R, O, E in new positions:

- Position 2: could be R, O, E
- Position 3: could be R, O, E
- Position 4: could be R, O, E
- Position 5: could be R, O, E

We also need one more distinct letter. Common remaining letters: N, L, D, C, etc.

Candidate words:
- S _ R O E → SRO_E → but we need a valid word.
- S O _ R E → SO_RE → possible: SORER (but repeats R), SOPER (but P not ruled out), etc.
- S R _ O E → SR_OE → possible: SRO_E (invalid), etc.
- S _ O R E → S O R E _ → possible: SORER (invalid), SOPER (invalid), etc.

Looking for valid English words:
- SPORE: S(✓), P(new), R, O, E. This fits all constraints: starts with S, contains R, O, E, introduces P (not yet tested), and no A/T.
- SHARE: but A is out.
- SHORE: introduces H (valid), contains R, O, E.

Between SPORE and SHORE:
- SPORE introduces P (common).
- SHORE introduces H (common).

Both are valid, but SPORE seems slightly better as P is a common consonant.

Let’s go with SPORE.

- Position 5: O, R, E or new letter

But since O, R, E must appear once each, they must occupy three of the last four positions, and the fourth position must be a new letter.

Looking for valid English words starting with S, containing O, R, E, and one new letter from remaining pool.

Candidate words:
- S _ O R E → S O R E _ → but we need a letter in position 2. Possible: S O R E _ → but that's 5 letters. Wait, positions are 1-5, so:
  - Position 1: S (fixed)
  - Positions 2-5: must contain O, R, E and one new letter.

Possible structures:
- S _ _ _ _ with O, R, E in three of positions 2-5 and one new letter.

Looking at valid words:
- S O R E _ → but we need a 5-letter word, so S O R E _ is 5 letters only if we have a letter in position 5, but that would repeat E. Not possible.
- S _ O R E → S _ O R E → position 2 must be new letter. Possible: S C O R E (but C is new, and we haven't tried it yet). Let's check:
  - SCORE: S(✓), C(new), O, R, E. This fits all constraints:
    - Starts with S.
    - Contains O, R, E.
    - Introduces C (not yet tested).
    - No A, T, P.

Another candidate: S _ _ O R E → but that would be 6 letters. Not possible.

Another candidate: S _ E R O → but that's not a valid word.

Another candidate: S _ R O E → S _ R O E → position 2 must be new letter. Possible: S C R O E (but not a valid word), S H R O E (not valid), etc.

From the five guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(-)
   - Letters in word: R, O, S, E (wrong positions)
   - A is NOT in the word.

2. STORE → S(✓) T(x) O(-) R(-) E(-)
   - S is correct in position 1.
   - T is NOT in the word.
   - O, R, E are in word but wrong positions.

3. SPORE → S(✓) P(x) O(-) R(-) E(-)
   - S is correct in position 1.
   - P is NOT in the word.
   - O, R, E are in word but wrong positions.

4. SCORE → S(✓) C(x) O(-) R(-) E(-)
   - S is correct in position 1.
   - C is NOT in the word.
   - O, R, E are in word but wrong positions.

5. SHORE → S(✓) H(x) O(-) R(-) E(-)
   - S is correct in position 1.
   - H is NOT in the word.
   - O, R, E are in word but wrong positions.

Current knowledge:
- Word starts with S.
- Contains O, R, E (each exactly once) in positions 2-5.
- Does NOT contain A, T, P, C, H.

Letters left to try: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We have four positions to fill: 2, 3, 4, 5 with O, R, E and one new letter.

Possible placements:
- Position 2: O, R, E or new letter
- Position 3: O, R, E or new letter
- Position 4: O, R, E or new letter
- Position 5: O, R, E or new letter

But since O, R, E must appear once each, they must occupy three of the last four positions, and the fourth position must be a new letter.

Looking for valid English words starting with S, containing O, R, E, and one new letter from remaining pool.

Candidate words:
- S _ O R E → S _ O R E → position 2 must be new letter. Possible: S B O R E (invalid), S D O R E (invalid), S F O R E (invalid), S G O R E (invalid), S I O R E (invalid), S K O R E (invalid), S L O R E (invalid), S M O R E (invalid), S N O R E → SNORE is valid.
- S _ R O E → S _ R O E → position 2 must be new letter. Possible: S B R O E (invalid), etc. No valid words.
- S _ E R O → S _ E R O → position 2 must be new letter. Possible: S N E R O (invalid), etc.

The only valid word fitting all constraints is SNORE.

Let’s verify:
- Starts with S.
- Contains O, R, E.
- Introduces N (not yet tested).
- No A, T, P, C, H.

Therefore, SNORE is the correct next guess.
