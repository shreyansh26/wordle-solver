### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities quickly. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position early on. Let me go with AROSE as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): The letter A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x): These four letters are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
- Does contain A, but A is not in position 1.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A (but not in position 1).
2. Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to test new positions.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already known to be present).

Let me try a word that places A in position 2 and uses other common letters: ""TAINT"" uses T, A, I, N, T. But T is repeated, which might not be optimal.

Another option: ""PAINT"" – P, A, I, N, T. This uses P, I, N, T which are all common and not yet ruled out.

But let me think of a word that uses more unique letters. ""PLANT"" uses P, L, A, N, T. This seems good.

Wait, ""PLANT"" has A in position 3, which is allowed since A just can't be in position 1. This will test P, L, N, T as new letters.

I'll go with PLANT.

Letters that ARE in the word, but in the wrong positions so far:

- T (wrong in position 5)  

So the secret word must:
- Contain A and T exactly once each.  
- Contain A somewhere other than positions 1 or 3.  
- Contain T somewhere other than position 5.  
- Use only letters from the remaining alphabet (no R, O, S, E, P, L, N).

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already present and we’ve ruled out O and E).

A good next guess should test new positions for A and T while introducing other common unused letters.  
Let’s try a word that places A in position 2 and T in position 3, using two fresh consonants: “CATCH” fails (C twice).  
“BATIK” – B, A, T, I, K – uses B, I, K and places A in 2, T in 3. This satisfies all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities quickly. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position early on. Let me go with AROSE as my first guess.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|>

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): The letter A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x): These four letters are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
- Does contain A, but A is not in position 1.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A (but not in position 1).
2. Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to test new positions.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already known to be present).

Let me try a word that places A in position 2 and uses other common letters: ""TAINT"" uses T, A, I, N, T. But T is repeated, which might not be optimal.

Another option: ""PAINT"" – P, A, I, N, T. This uses P, I, N, T which are all common and not yet ruled out.

But let me think of a word that uses more unique letters. ""PLANT"" uses P, L, A, N, T. This seems good.

Wait, ""PLANT"" has A in position 3, which is allowed since A just can't be in position 1. This will test P, L, N, T as new letters.

I'll go with PLANT.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: R, O, S, E, P, L, N  
Letters that ARE in the word, but in the wrong positions so far:  
- A (wrong in positions 1 and 3)  
- T (wrong in position 5)  

So the secret word must:
- Contain A and T exactly once each.  
- Contain A somewhere other than positions 1 or 3.  
- Contain T somewhere other than position 5.  
- Use only letters from the remaining alphabet (no R, O, S, E, P, L, N).

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already present and we’ve ruled out O and E).

A good next guess should test new positions for A and T while introducing other common unused letters.  
Let’s try a word that places A in position 2 and T in position 3, using two fresh consonants: “CATCH” fails (C twice).  
“BATIK” – B, A, T, I, K – uses B, I, K and places A in 2, T in 3. This satisfies all constraints.

Current constraints after four guesses:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:  
R, O, S, E, P, L, N, B, I, K, M

Letters that ARE in the word:  
- U (position 2)  
- T (position 3)  
- A (must appear, but not in positions 1, 2, 3, 4)  
- G (must appear, but position unknown so far)

So the pattern is: _ U T _ _

A must be in position 5 (only remaining spot).  
G must appear somewhere, but positions 1 and 4 are open.  
Remaining unused consonants: C, D, F, H, V, W, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:  
1. Has U in position 2, T in position 3, A in position 5.  
2. Contains G exactly once, not in position 4 (since G(-) in MUTAG means it’s in the word but not in position 4).  
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Thus G must be in position 1, making the pattern: G U T _ A

The missing letter (position 4) must be a consonant not yet used and not ruled out.  
Remaining consonants: C, D, F, H, V, W, Y, Z

Valid 5-letter words fitting GUT_A:  
- GUTTA (but T is already in position 3, and double T might be allowed)  
- GUTIA (I is ruled out)  
- GUTSA (S is ruled out)  
- GUTNA (N is ruled out)  
- GUTCA (C is allowed)  
- GUTDA (D is allowed)  
- GUTFY (Y is allowed)  
- GUTHA (H is allowed)  
- GUTVA (V is allowed)  
- GUTWA (W is allowed)  
- GUTYA (Y is allowed)  
- GUTZA (Z is allowed)

The most common valid word is GUTTA. Let’s check:  
GUTTA: G, U, T, T, A – uses G, U, T, A. T is allowed to appear twice (since T is confirmed in position 3). All letters are allowed.

Therefore, GUTTA is the logical next guess.
