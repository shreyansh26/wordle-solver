For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct, high-frequency letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

Some excellent starting words include:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains five of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage across different positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word has an O in the third position.
- The letters A, R, S, E are eliminated.
- We still need to test other common letters (T, L, N, I, C, U, D, etc.) to narrow down possibilities.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep the known O in position 3.
2. Introduce new common letters not yet tested.
3. Avoid any of the eliminated letters (A, R, S, E).

Possible candidates:
- TOUND (T, O, U, N, D) – but U is less common.
- CLOUD (C, L, O, U, D) – good letters, but U is again less common.
- FOUND (F, O, U, N, D) – F is less common than C or L.
- POINT (P, O, I, N, T) – P is less common than C or L.
- CLOUD is still better, but let's try a word with even more common letters.

Another good option is ""CLOUT"" (C, L, O, U, T), but U is less common. Instead, ""CLOUT"" might not be optimal.

A better choice is ""CLOUD"" (C, L, O, U, D) – C, L, D are all common consonants, and U is a common vowel. However, since we know O is in position 3, let's try ""CLOUD"" as it fits the O in position 3.

Some excellent starting words include:

Wait, ""CLOUD"" has O in position 3, which matches our known information. Let's go with CLOUD.

But actually, let's think of a word with more common letters. ""CLOUT"" is similar. 

Another excellent option is ""CLOUD"" – C, L, O, U, D. 

I'll go with CLOUD as it introduces C, L, U, D, and keeps O in position 3.

From the two pieces of feedback we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)  
   - O is in the correct position (position 3).  
   - A, R, S, E are not in the word at all.

2. CLOUD → C(x) L(✓) O(✓) U(x) D(x)  
   - L is in the correct position (position 2).  
   - O is again confirmed in position 3.  
   - C, U, D are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ L O _ _
- Letters eliminated: A, C, D, E, R, S, U
- Still available common letters: B, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, T, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has L in position 2 and O in position 3.
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Possible candidates:
- BLOKE (B, L, O, K, E) – but E is eliminated.
- BLOOM – M is available, but second O would duplicate and we don’t know if double-O is allowed.
- BLOWN – N is available, W is available.
- FLOCK – C is eliminated.
- GLOOM – G and M are available, but double O again.
- GLOVE – V is available, E is eliminated.
- GLOWS – S is eliminated.
- GLOOM – already considered.
- BLOWN – B, L, O, W, N – all letters are allowed and fit the pattern.

BLOWN seems like the best choice here: it uses fresh common letters (B, W, N) and fits the known L and O positions.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct, high-frequency letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

Some excellent starting words include:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains five of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage across different positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word has an O in the third position.
- The letters A, R, S, E are eliminated.
- We still need to test other common letters (T, L, N, I, C, U, D, etc.) to narrow down possibilities.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep the known O in position 3.
2. Introduce new common letters not yet tested.
3. Avoid any of the eliminated letters (A, R, S, E).

Possible candidates:
- TOUND (T, O, U, N, D) – but U is less common.
- CLOUD (C, L, O, U, D) – good letters, but U is again less common.
- FOUND (F, O, U, N, D) – F is less common than C or L.
- POINT (P, O, I, N, T) – P is less common than C or L.
- CLOUD is still better, but let's try a word with even more common letters.

Another good option is ""CLOUT"" (C, L, O, U, T), but U is less common. Instead, ""CLOUT"" might not be optimal.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct, high-frequency letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

Some excellent starting words include:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains five of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage across different positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word has an O in the third position.
- The letters A, R, S, E are eliminated.
- We still need to test other common letters (T, L, N, I, C, U, D, etc.) to narrow down possibilities.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep the known O in position 3.
2. Introduce new common letters not yet tested.
3. Avoid any of the eliminated letters (A, R, S, E).

Possible candidates:
- TOUND (T, O, U, N, D) – but U is less common.
- CLOUD (C, L, O, U, D) – good letters, but U is again less common.
- FOUND (F, O, U, N, D) – F is less common than C or L.
- POINT (P, O, I, N, T) – P is less common than C or L.
- CLOUD is still better, but let's try a word with even more common letters.

Another good option is ""CLOUT"" (C, L, O, U, T), but U is less common. Instead, ""CLOUT"" might not be optimal.

A better choice is ""CLOUD"" (C, L, O, U, D) – C, L, D are all common consonants, and U is a common vowel. However, since we know O is in position 3, let's try ""CLOUD"" as it fits the O in position 3.

Wait, ""CLOUD"" has O in position 3, which matches our known information. Let's go with CLOUD.

But actually, let's think of a word with more common letters. ""CLOUT"" is similar. 

Another excellent option is ""CLOUD"" – C, L, O, U, D. 

I'll go with CLOUD as it introduces C, L, U, D, and keeps O in position 3.

Guess 2: CLOUD -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(✓) O(✓) U(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two pieces of feedback we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)  
   - O is in the correct position (position 3).  
   - A, R, S, E are not in the word at all.

2. CLOUD → C(x) L(✓) O(✓) U(x) D(x)  
   - L is in the correct position (position 2).  
   - O is again confirmed in position 3.  
   - C, U, D are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ L O _ _
- Letters eliminated: A, C, D, E, R, S, U
- Still available common letters: B, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, T, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has L in position 2 and O in position 3.
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Possible candidates:
- BLOKE (B, L, O, K, E) – but E is eliminated.
- BLOOM – M is available, but second O would duplicate and we don’t know if double-O is allowed.
- BLOWN – N is available, W is available.
- FLOCK – C is eliminated.
- GLOOM – G and M are available, but double O again.
- GLOVE – V is available, E is eliminated.
- GLOWS – S is eliminated.
- GLOOM – already considered.
- BLOWN – B, L, O, W, N – all letters are allowed and fit the pattern.

BLOWN seems like the best choice here: it uses fresh common letters (B, W, N) and fits the known L and O positions.

Current known facts:

1. Pattern: B L O _ _  (positions 1, 2, 3 are fixed)
2. Eliminated letters so far: A, C, D, E, R, S, U, W, N
3. Still-available common letters: F, G, H, I, K, M, P, T, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with B L O
- Ends with two letters that have not been eliminated
- Uses only the allowed letters

Quick scan of possibilities:
- BLOKE – E is eliminated
- BLOOM – second O might be allowed, but we have no evidence of double-O yet
- BLOBS – S is eliminated
- BLOBS – same issue
- BLOCH – H is allowed, C is eliminated
- BLOIT – I and T are allowed
- BLOMP – M and P are allowed
- BLOPY – Y and P are allowed

Among these, ""BLOIT"" uses fresh letters (I, T) and is a valid English word, so it’s the most informative next guess.
