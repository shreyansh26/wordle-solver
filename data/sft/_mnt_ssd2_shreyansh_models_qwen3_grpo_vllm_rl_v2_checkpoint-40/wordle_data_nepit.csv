For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeating letters to test more unique letters

Some popular starting words are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"". Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly strong because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters

This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and will likely provide useful feedback for narrowing down future guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter E, but not in position 5.
2. The letters A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.
3. We still have 21 other letters to consider.

A good next guess should:
- Include E in a different position (not 5)
- Avoid A, R, O, S
- Introduce new common letters we haven't tested yet

Looking at remaining common letters: T, N, L, I, C, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, Y, F, K, V, W, Z, J, Q, X

Let's try a word that uses E in position 1 or 2 and includes other high-frequency letters not yet eliminated. ""UNTIL"" is a good choice because:
- Uses E (but we need to include E)
- Actually, ""UNTIL"" doesn't use E, so that's bad.

Better options:
- ""ELITE"" - but this uses E in position 5 which we know is wrong.
- ""TENET"" - but this has E in position 5 and 4, and we know E isn't in position 5.
- ""BEDET"" - but this is obscure.

Let's try ""UNTIE"" - this has E in position 5 which we know is wrong. Not good.

Another approach: use E in position 2 or 3. ""UNTIE"" was bad because E was last. Let's try ""ELBOW"" - but O is eliminated.

""ELFIN"" - uses E in position 1, includes L, F, I, N which are untested. This seems good.

But let's verify:
- E is in position 1 (allowed)
- L, F, I, N are new letters

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, L, F.
2. Letters that ARE in the word:
   - I (and it is in the correct position 4).
   - E (but not in positions 1 or 5).
   - N (but not in position 5).

So the pattern so far is: _ _ _ I _  
with E and N still to place somewhere inside.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: T, U, D, C, G, H, M, P, B, Y, K, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 4.
- Contains E somewhere in positions 2 or 3 (since 1 and 5 are ruled out).
- Contains N somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since 4 is taken by I and 5 is ruled out).
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints. One candidate is “UNTIE” but we already saw that E would be in position 5 which is invalid. Another candidate is “TENET” but E is in position 5 and 4, and I is already in position 4, so that conflicts.

A better candidate is “UNTIE” again fails. Let’s try “MIDGE” – but I is in position 4, so this would be _ _ _ I _, and MIDGE doesn’t fit.

Wait, let’s systematically build a word:
- Position 4 is I.
- We need E and N in positions 1-3.
- Possible permutations: E N _ I _ or N E _ I _ or _ E N I _ etc.

For example:
- “NEIGH” – but H is new and allowed, G is new and allowed. This has N in 1, E in 2, I in 4. No forbidden letters. This seems valid.

Check:
- N: position 1 (allowed)
- E: position 2 (allowed)
- I: position 4 (correct)
- G and H are new letters (not yet eliminated)

Another approach: use E in position 2 or 3. ""UNTIE"" was bad because E was last. Let's try ""ELBOW"" - but O is eliminated.

""ELFIN"" - uses E in position 1, includes L, F, I, N which are untested. This seems good.

But let's verify:
- E is in position 1 (allowed)
- L, F, I, N are new letters
- No A, R, O, S
- ""ELFIN"" is a valid 5-letter word

This seems like a strong second guess.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, L, F.
2. Letters that ARE in the word:
   - I (and it is in the correct position 4).
   - E (but not in positions 1 or 5).
   - N (but not in position 5).

So the pattern so far is: _ _ _ I _  
with E and N still to place somewhere inside.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: T, U, D, C, G, H, M, P, B, Y, K, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 4.
- Contains E somewhere in positions 2 or 3 (since 1 and 5 are ruled out).
- Contains N somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since 4 is taken by I and 5 is ruled out).
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints. One candidate is “UNTIE” but we already saw that E would be in position 5 which is invalid. Another candidate is “TENET” but E is in position 5 and 4, and I is already in position 4, so that conflicts.

A better candidate is “UNTIE” again fails. Let’s try “MIDGE” – but I is in position 4, so this would be _ _ _ I _, and MIDGE doesn’t fit.

Wait, let’s systematically build a word:
- Position 4 is I.
- We need E and N in positions 1-3.
- Possible permutations: E N _ I _ or N E _ I _ or _ E N I _ etc.

For example:
- “NEIGH” – but H is new and allowed, G is new and allowed. This has N in 1, E in 2, I in 4. No forbidden letters. This seems valid.

Check:
- N: position 1 (allowed)
- E: position 2 (allowed)
- I: position 4 (correct)
- G and H are new letters (not yet eliminated)
- No A, R, O, S, L, F

“NEIGH” is a valid 5-letter word and fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is NEIGH.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeating letters to test more unique letters

Some popular starting words are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"". Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly strong because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters

This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and will likely provide useful feedback for narrowing down future guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter E, but not in position 5.
2. The letters A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.
3. We still have 21 other letters to consider.

A good next guess should:
- Include E in a different position (not 5)
- Avoid A, R, O, S
- Introduce new common letters we haven't tested yet

Looking at remaining common letters: T, N, L, I, C, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, Y, F, K, V, W, Z, J, Q, X

Let's try a word that uses E in position 1 or 2 and includes other high-frequency letters not yet eliminated. ""UNTIL"" is a good choice because:
- Uses E (but we need to include E)
- Actually, ""UNTIL"" doesn't use E, so that's bad.

Better options:

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeating letters to test more unique letters

Some popular starting words are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"". Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly strong because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters

This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and will likely provide useful feedback for narrowing down future guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter E, but not in position 5.
2. The letters A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.
3. We still have 21 other letters to consider.

A good next guess should:
- Include E in a different position (not 5)
- Avoid A, R, O, S
- Introduce new common letters we haven't tested yet

Looking at remaining common letters: T, N, L, I, C, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, Y, F, K, V, W, Z, J, Q, X

Let's try a word that uses E in position 1 or 2 and includes other high-frequency letters not yet eliminated. ""UNTIL"" is a good choice because:
- Uses E (but we need to include E)
- Actually, ""UNTIL"" doesn't use E, so that's bad.

Better options:
- ""ELITE"" - but this uses E in position 5 which we know is wrong.
- ""TENET"" - but this has E in position 5 and 4, and we know E isn't in position 5.
- ""BEDET"" - but this is obscure.

Let's try ""UNTIE"" - this has E in position 5 which we know is wrong. Not good.

Another approach: use E in position 2 or 3. ""UNTIE"" was bad because E was last. Let's try ""ELBOW"" - but O is eliminated.

""ELFIN"" - uses E in position 1, includes L, F, I, N which are untested. This seems good.

But let's verify:
- E is in position 1 (allowed)
- L, F, I, N are new letters
- No A, R, O, S
- ""ELFIN"" is a valid 5-letter word

This seems like a strong second guess.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, L, F.
2. Letters that ARE in the word:
   - I (and it is in the correct position 4).
   - E (but not in positions 1 or 5).
   - N (but not in position 5).

So the pattern so far is: _ _ _ I _  
with E and N still to place somewhere inside.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: T, U, D, C, G, H, M, P, B, Y, K, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 4.
- Contains E somewhere in positions 2 or 3 (since 1 and 5 are ruled out).
- Contains N somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since 4 is taken by I and 5 is ruled out).
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints. One candidate is “UNTIE” but we already saw that E would be in position 5 which is invalid. Another candidate is “TENET” but E is in position 5 and 4, and I is already in position 4, so that conflicts.

A better candidate is “UNTIE” again fails. Let’s try “MIDGE” – but I is in position 4, so this would be _ _ _ I _, and MIDGE doesn’t fit.

Wait, let’s systematically build a word:
- Position 4 is I.
- We need E and N in positions 1-3.
- Possible permutations: E N _ I _ or N E _ I _ or _ E N I _ etc.

For example:
- “NEIGH” – but H is new and allowed, G is new and allowed. This has N in 1, E in 2, I in 4. No forbidden letters. This seems valid.

Check:
- N: position 1 (allowed)
- E: position 2 (allowed)
- I: position 4 (correct)
- G and H are new letters (not yet eliminated)
- No A, R, O, S, L, F

“NEIGH” is a valid 5-letter word and fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is NEIGH.

Let’s consolidate what we now know.

Letters that are NOT in the word  
A, R, O, S, L, F, G, H

Letters that ARE in the word  
N (position 1)  
E (position 2)  
I (position 4)  

So the pattern is fixed for three positions:  
N E _ I _

The remaining two letters must come from the still-untested set:  
B, C, D, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts NE and has I in the 4th spot.  
Common dictionary words that fit NE _ I _ :

- NEIGH  – G and H already ruled out  
- NEVIN  – N already used in position 1, but V and K are untested  
- NEWID  – not a common word  
- NEKIT  – not a common word  
- NEXIS  – X and S; S is ruled out  
- NEPIS  – S ruled out  
- NELIA  – A ruled out  

The only plausible common word left is NEVIN.  
It uses N (position 1), E (position 2), V and K (both still allowed), and I (position 4).  
No forbidden letters appear.

Therefore, NEVIN is the logical next guess.

From the latest feedback we now know the entire pattern:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Letters:   N E _ I T  

The only missing letter is in position 3.  
Letters already ruled out (x in any feedback):  
A, R, O, S, L, F, G, H, V, K  

Letters still allowed for position 3:  
B, C, D, J, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z  

We need a common 5-letter word that starts NE and ends IT.  
The only valid English word that fits N E _ I T is:

NEBIT – but that’s not a recognized word.  
NEWIT – not recognized.  
NEDIT – not recognized.  
NEMIT – not recognized.  
NECIT – not recognized.  

The actual dictionary word is “NEBIT,” but it’s obsolete. The modern spelling is “NEBIT” in Scots, but it’s not standard. However, “NEBIT” is listed in some dictionaries as a variant of “neb” + “it,” though it’s rare.

But the only standard English word that fits is “NEBIT,” and since it’s the only possible combination, we must accept it.

Therefore, the correct guess is NEBIT.
