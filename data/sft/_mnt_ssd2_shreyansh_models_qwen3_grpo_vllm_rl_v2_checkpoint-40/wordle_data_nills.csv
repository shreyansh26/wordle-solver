For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is a popular first choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English
- It doesn't repeat any letters, maximizing information gain

This should give me good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities quickly based on the feedback.

Good vowels left: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

A word like ""STUMP"" fits:
- S is in position 1 (not 5, so possible).
- T, U, M, P are all common letters not yet tested.
- Uses U (a common vowel) and M/P (common consonants).

Another option is ""SLUMP"" but that repeats the S issue. ""STINT"" uses I and N. ""STUMP"" seems slightly better letter distribution.

   Therefore S must be in position 2, 3, or 5.

A good candidate is “SINUS” but it repeats S and has U (invalid).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is a popular first choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English
- It doesn't repeat any letters, maximizing information gain

This should give me good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities quickly based on the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are not in the word at all (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.
- DOES contain S, but not in the 5th position.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Includes S (and not in 5th position).
2. Avoids A, R, O, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

A word like ""STUMP"" fits:
- S is in position 1 (not 5, so possible).
- T, U, M, P are all common letters not yet tested.
- Uses U (a common vowel) and M/P (common consonants).

Another option is ""SLUMP"" but that repeats the S issue. ""STINT"" uses I and N. ""STUMP"" seems slightly better letter distribution.

Guess 2: STUMP -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) U(x) M(x) P(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, U, M, P  
2. Letter S is in the word but has been in the wrong place twice:  
   - In AROSE it was in position 4 → wrong place.  
   - In STUMP it was in position 1 → wrong place.  
   Therefore S must be in position 2, 3, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S (and not in positions 1 or 4).  
- Uses none of the letters A, R, O, E, T, U, M, P.  
- Uses other common letters not yet tested (e.g., N, I, D, L, C, G, H, K, B, F, W, Y, V, X, Z, Q, J).

A good candidate is “SINUS” but it repeats S and has U (invalid).  
Another candidate is “SICKS” but again repeats S and has C/K which may be useful.

A better choice is “SINUS” is invalid due to U and double S.  
Let’s pick “SINUS” → invalid.  
Next, “SICKS” has C/K, but double S is not ideal.

A better word is “SINGH”:
- S in position 1 → but we know S cannot be in 1.  
So move S to position 2: “NISPY” – but Y is uncommon.

Try “SANDY” – but A and D are okay, but A is invalid.

Try “SNUCK” – U is invalid.

Try “SNICK” – C, K, I, N are okay, S in position 1 is invalid.

Move S to position 2: “INSKY” – not a word.

Move S to position 3: “NISPY” – again Y.

Move S to position 5: “NISID” – not a word.

A valid word with S in position 2 is “NISPY” but Y is uncommon.

Another valid word is “SINUS” but U is invalid.

Let’s try “SICKS” – S in position 1 is invalid.

Let’s try “SINGH” – S in position 1 is invalid.

Let’s try “SUNNY” – U is invalid.

Let’s try “SLOSH” – O is invalid.

Let’s try “SHINS” – S in position 5 is possible, and letters H, I, N, S are okay (no forbidden letters).  
SHINS:
- S in position 5 (allowed).  
- H, I, N are new letters.  
- No forbidden letters.

This seems valid.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is a popular first choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English
- It doesn't repeat any letters, maximizing information gain

This should give me good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities quickly based on the feedback.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are not in the word at all (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.
- DOES contain S, but not in the 5th position.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Includes S (and not in 5th position).
2. Avoids A, R, O, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

A word like ""STUMP"" fits:
- S is in position 1 (not 5, so possible).
- T, U, M, P are all common letters not yet tested.
- Uses U (a common vowel) and M/P (common consonants).

Another option is ""SLUMP"" but that repeats the S issue. ""STINT"" uses I and N. ""STUMP"" seems slightly better letter distribution.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STUMP -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) U(x) M(x) P(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, U, M, P  
2. Letter S is in the word but has been in the wrong place twice:  
   - In AROSE it was in position 4 → wrong place.  
   - In STUMP it was in position 1 → wrong place.  
   Therefore S must be in position 2, 3, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S (and not in positions 1 or 4).  
- Uses none of the letters A, R, O, E, T, U, M, P.  
- Uses other common letters not yet tested (e.g., N, I, D, L, C, G, H, K, B, F, W, Y, V, X, Z, Q, J).

A good candidate is “SINUS” but it repeats S and has U (invalid).  
Another candidate is “SICKS” but again repeats S and has C/K which may be useful.

A better choice is “SINUS” is invalid due to U and double S.  
Let’s pick “SINUS” → invalid.  
Next, “SICKS” has C/K, but double S is not ideal.

A better word is “SINGH”:
- S in position 1 → but we know S cannot be in 1.  
So move S to position 2: “NISPY” – but Y is uncommon.

Try “SANDY” – but A and D are okay, but A is invalid.

Try “SNUCK” – U is invalid.

Try “SNICK” – C, K, I, N are okay, S in position 1 is invalid.

Move S to position 2: “INSKY” – not a word.

Move S to position 3: “NISPY” – again Y.

Move S to position 5: “NISID” – not a word.

A valid word with S in position 2 is “NISPY” but Y is uncommon.

Another valid word is “SINUS” but U is invalid.

Let’s try “SICKS” – S in position 1 is invalid.

Let’s try “SINGH” – S in position 1 is invalid.

Let’s try “SUNNY” – U is invalid.

Let’s try “SLOSH” – O is invalid.

Let’s try “SHINS” – S in position 5 is possible, and letters H, I, N, S are okay (no forbidden letters).  
SHINS:
- S in position 5 (allowed).  
- H, I, N are new letters.  
- No forbidden letters.

This seems valid.

<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word (✗): A, R, O, E, T, U, M, P, H  
Letters that ARE in the word (✓ or –):  
- S – must appear at least once, and we now know it is in position 5 (✓).  
- I – in the word but wrong position (–).  
- N – in the word but wrong position (–).

So the secret word looks like: _ _ _ _ S  
and must contain both I and N somewhere in positions 1-4.

Available letters (not yet ruled out):  
B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus I and S (S is fixed at 5).

We need a 5-letter word ending in S that uses I and N exactly once each in the first four positions, and only from the available letters.

Possible patterns:  
- I N _ _ S  
- I _ N _ S  
- I _ _ N S  
- N I _ _ S  
- N _ I _ S  
- N _ _ I S  
- etc.

Let’s list valid English words ending in S that fit:
- INKS – but K is allowed.

- NINOS – O is forbidden.  
- NINAS – A is forbidden.  
- NINIS – not a word.  
- NINIS – not a word.

The only plausible candidate is “INKS”:

- Uses K (new letter, not yet tested).  
- No forbidden letters.
