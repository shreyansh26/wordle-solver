For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'm going to choose ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give me good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A and R are NOT in the word (x).
- O, S, and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A or R.
- Contains O, S, and E, but none of them are in the positions they occupied in AROSE (positions 3, 4, 5 respectively).

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Does not contain A or R.
2. Contains O, S, and E (but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively).

Let me think of possible positions for O, S, and E:
- O was in position 3, so it could be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- S was in position 4, so it could be in 1, 2, 3, or 5.
- E was in position 5, so it could be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.

I also need two more letters (since the word is 5 letters and I already have O, S, E). These two letters should not be A or R, and they should be distinct from O, S, E.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let me try to construct a word:
- O could be in position 1: O _ _ _ _
- S could be in position 2: O S _ _ _
- E could be in position 3: O S E _ _
  - Then I need two more letters for positions 4 and 5, not A or R.
  - Possible: O S E T H -> ""OSET H"" (but ""OSET"" isn't a word)
  - Maybe O S E N T -> ""ONSE T"" (not a word)
  - Maybe O S E L D -> ""OS ELD"" (not a word)
  - Maybe O S E T D -> ""OSET D"" (not a word)

Alternative: O in position 2:
- _ O _ _ _
- S could be in position 1: S O _ _ _
- E could be in position 3: S O E _ _
  - Need two more letters: S O E _ _
  - Maybe S O E T H -> ""SOETH"" (not a word)
  - Maybe S O E L D -> ""SOELD"" (not a word)

Alternative: O in position 4:
- _ _ _ O _
- S could be in position 1: S _ _ O _

  - Maybe S E T O N -> ""SETON"" (valid word)
  - Check letters: S, E, T, O, N - none are A or R, and contains O, S, E in new positions.

I'm going to choose ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give me good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A and R are NOT in the word (x).
- O, S, and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A or R.
- Contains O, S, and E, but none of them are in the positions they occupied in AROSE (positions 3, 4, 5 respectively).

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Does not contain A or R.
2. Contains O, S, and E (but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively).

Let me think of possible positions for O, S, and E:
- O was in position 3, so it could be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- S was in position 4, so it could be in 1, 2, 3, or 5.
- E was in position 5, so it could be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.

I also need two more letters (since the word is 5 letters and I already have O, S, E). These two letters should not be A or R, and they should be distinct from O, S, E.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let me try to construct a word:
- O could be in position 1: O _ _ _ _
- S could be in position 2: O S _ _ _
- E could be in position 3: O S E _ _
  - Then I need two more letters for positions 4 and 5, not A or R.
  - Possible: O S E T H -> ""OSET H"" (but ""OSET"" isn't a word)
  - Maybe O S E N T -> ""ONSE T"" (not a word)
  - Maybe O S E L D -> ""OS ELD"" (not a word)
  - Maybe O S E T D -> ""OSET D"" (not a word)

Alternative: O in position 2:
- _ O _ _ _
- S could be in position 1: S O _ _ _
- E could be in position 3: S O E _ _
  - Need two more letters: S O E _ _
  - Maybe S O E T H -> ""SOETH"" (not a word)
  - Maybe S O E L D -> ""SOELD"" (not a word)

Alternative: O in position 4:
- _ _ _ O _
- S could be in position 1: S _ _ O _
- E could be in position 2: S E _ O _
  - Need two more letters: S E _ O _
  - Maybe S E T O N -> ""SETON"" (valid word)
  - Check letters: S, E, T, O, N - none are A or R, and contains O, S, E in new positions.

This seems like a good candidate.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)  
   – A and R are not in the word.  
   – O, S, E are in the word but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively.

2. SETON → S(✓) E(✓) T(x) O(✓) N(x)  
   – S is in position 1 and is correct.  
   – E is in position 2 and is correct.  
   – O is in position 4 and is correct.  
   – T and N are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: S E _ O _ (positions 1, 2, 4 are locked)
- Letters already confirmed: S, E, O  
- Letters already ruled out: A, R, T, N  
- Still need two more letters for positions 3 and 5, chosen from the remaining alphabet (excluding A, R, T, N, S, E, O).

Remaining consonants/vowels: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want a valid 5-letter English word that fits S E _ O _.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A and R are NOT in the word (x).
- O, S, and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A or R.
- Contains O, S, and E, but none of them are in the positions they occupied in AROSE (positions 3, 4, 5 respectively).

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Does not contain A or R.
2. Contains O, S, and E (but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively).

Let me think of possible positions for O, S, and E:
- O was in position 3, so it could be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- S was in position 4, so it could be in 1, 2, 3, or 5.
- E was in position 5, so it could be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.

I also need two more letters (since the word is 5 letters and I already have O, S, E). These two letters should not be A or R, and they should be distinct from O, S, E.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let me try to construct a word:
- O could be in position 1: O _ _ _ _
- S could be in position 2: O S _ _ _
- E could be in position 3: O S E _ _
  - Then I need two more letters for positions 4 and 5, not A or R.
  - Possible: O S E T H -> ""OSET H"" (but ""OSET"" isn't a word)
  - Maybe O S E N T -> ""ONSE T"" (not a word)
  - Maybe O S E L D -> ""OS ELD"" (not a word)
  - Maybe O S E T D -> ""OSET D"" (not a word)

Alternative: O in position 2:
- _ O _ _ _
- S could be in position 1: S O _ _ _
- E could be in position 3: S O E _ _
  - Need two more letters: S O E _ _
  - Maybe S O E T H -> ""SOETH"" (not a word)
  - Maybe S O E L D -> ""SOELD"" (not a word)

Alternative: O in position 4:
- _ _ _ O _
- S could be in position 1: S _ _ O _
- E could be in position 2: S E _ O _
  - Need two more letters: S E _ O _
  - Maybe S E T O N -> ""SETON"" (valid word)

From the four rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)  
   – A, R not in word.  
   – O, S, E are in word but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively.

2. SETON → S(✓) E(✓) T(x) O(✓) N(x)  
   – S is in position 1 and is correct.  
   – E is in position 2 and is correct.  
   – O is in position 4 and is correct.  
   – T, N are not in the word.

3. SEIZE → S(✓) E(✓) I(x) Z(x) E(-)  
   – S, E already correct.  
   – I, Z are not in the word.  
   – The last E is in position 5 and is marked (-), confirming E is not in position 5 (already known).

4. SEBUM → S(✓) E(✓) B(x) U(x) M(x)  
   – S, E already correct.  
   – B, U, M are not in the word.

Current knowns:
- Word pattern: S E _ O _ (positions 1, 2, 4 locked)
- Letters confirmed: S, E, O  
- Letters ruled out: A, R, T, N, I, Z, B, U, M  
- Still need two letters for positions 3 and 5, chosen from remaining alphabet (excluding S, E, O, A, R, T, N, I, Z, B, U, M).

Remaining possible letters: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that starts with SE and has O in the 4th position: S E _ O _.

Possible candidates:
- SECOP – not a real word  
- SEDOR – contains R (ruled out)  
- SEFOL – not a real word  
- SEGOL – not a real word  
- SEHON – contains N (ruled out)  
- SEJON – not a real word  
- SEKOR – contains R (ruled out)  
- SELL O – not a real word  
- SELOP – not a real word  
- SEPOT – contains T (ruled out)  
- SEPOL – not a real word  
- SEPOS – not a real word  
- SEROP – not a real word  
- SEVOT – contains T (ruled out)  
- SEDOS – not a real word  
- SEFOS – not a real word  
- SEKOS – not a real word  
- SEDOS – not a real word  
- SEDOS – not a real word  

Looking through the remaining letters, the only valid English word that fits S E _ O _ is ""SEJON"" – but that's not a recognized word. 

Wait, let's list all remaining letters: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y.

Valid 5-letter words starting with SE and having O in 4th position:
- SEDOS – not valid  
- SEFOL – not valid  
- SEGOL – not valid  
- SEHON – not valid  
- SEJON – not valid  
- SEKOR – not valid  
- SELL O – not valid

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'm going to choose ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give me good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A and R are NOT in the word (x).
- O, S, and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A or R.
- Contains O, S, and E, but none of them are in the positions they occupied in AROSE (positions 3, 4, 5 respectively).

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Does not contain A or R.
2. Contains O, S, and E (but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively).

Let me think of possible positions for O, S, and E:
- O was in position 3, so it could be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- S was in position 4, so it could be in 1, 2, 3, or 5.
- E was in position 5, so it could be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.

I also need two more letters (since the word is 5 letters and I already have O, S, E). These two letters should not be A or R, and they should be distinct from O, S, E.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let me try to construct a word:
- O could be in position 1: O _ _ _ _
- S could be in position 2: O S _ _ _
- E could be in position 3: O S E _ _
  - Then I need two more letters for positions 4 and 5, not A or R.
  - Possible: O S E T H -> ""OSET H"" (but ""OSET"" isn't a word)
  - Maybe O S E N T -> ""ONSE T"" (not a word)
  - Maybe O S E L D -> ""OS ELD"" (not a word)
  - Maybe O S E T D -> ""OSET D"" (not a word)

Alternative: O in position 2:
- _ O _ _ _
- S could be in position 1: S O _ _ _
- E could be in position 3: S O E _ _
  - Need two more letters: S O E _ _
  - Maybe S O E T H -> ""SOETH"" (not a word)
  - Maybe S O E L D -> ""SOELD"" (not a word)

Alternative: O in position 4:
- _ _ _ O _
- S could be in position 1: S _ _ O _
- E could be in position 2: S E _ O _
  - Need two more letters: S E _ O _
  - Maybe S E T O N -> ""SETON"" (valid word)
  - Check letters: S, E, T, O, N - none are A or R, and contains O, S, E in new positions.

This seems like a good candidate.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: SETON -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) E(✓) T(x) O(✓) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)  
   – A and R are not in the word.  
   – O, S, E are in the word but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively.

2. SETON → S(✓) E(✓) T(x) O(✓) N(x)  
   – S is in position 1 and is correct.  
   – E is in position 2 and is correct.  
   – O is in position 4 and is correct.  
   – T and N are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: S E _ O _ (positions 1, 2, 4 are locked)
- Letters already confirmed: S, E, O  
- Letters already ruled out: A, R, T, N  
- Still need two more letters for positions 3 and 5, chosen from the remaining alphabet (excluding A, R, T, N, S, E, O).

Remaining consonants/vowels: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want a valid 5-letter English word that fits S E _ O _.  
Possible candidates:
- SEBOW – not a real word  
- SECOR – contains R (ruled out)  
- SEDOS – not a real word  
- SEJON – not a real word  
- SELL O – not a real word  
- SEMI O – not a real word  
- SEPOL – not a real word  
- SEPOD – not a real word  
- SEWOP – not a real word  
- SEDOX – not a real word  
- SEDUC – not a real word  
- SEDGY – not a real word  
- SEDAN – N is ruled out  
- SENSE – N is ruled out  
- SEIZE – Z is allowed, but word is 5 letters: SEIZE  
  – Check: S E I Z E – positions 1,2,4 correct; letters S, E, I, Z – none ruled out.  
  – ""SEIZE"" is a valid English word.

Therefore, ""SEIZE"" fits the pattern and constraints.

From the three rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)  
   – A, R not in word.  
   – O, S, E are in word but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively.

2. SETON → S(✓) E(✓) T(x) O(✓) N(x)  
   – S is in position 1 and is correct.  
   – E is in position 2 and is correct.  
   – O is in position 4 and is correct.  
   – T, N are not in the word.

3. SEIZE → S(✓) E(✓) I(x) Z(x) E(-)  
   – S, E already correct.  
   – I, Z are not in the word.  
   – The last E is in position 5 and is marked (-), meaning E is in the word but not in position 5. However, we already know from SETON that E is in position 2, so this simply confirms E is not in position 5 (which we already knew from AROSE).

Current knowns:
- Word pattern: S E _ O _ (positions 1, 2, 4 locked)
- Letters confirmed: S, E, O  
- Letters ruled out: A, R, T, N, I, Z  
- Still need two letters for positions 3 and 5, chosen from remaining alphabet (excluding S, E, O, A, R, T, N, I, Z).

Remaining possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that starts with SE and has O in the 4th position: S E _ O _.

Possible candidates:
- SEBOW – not a real word  
- SECOR – contains R (ruled out)  
- SEDOS – not a real word  
- SEFOL – not a real word  
- SEGOL – not a real word  
- SEHON – contains N (ruled out)  
- SEMIC – not a real word

- SERYO – not a real word  
- SEBOP – not a real word  
- SEBON – contains N (ruled out)  
- SEBOL – not a real word  
- SEBUM – valid word  
  – Check letters: S, E, B, U, M – none of these are ruled out.

Current confirmed facts:
- Word pattern: S E _ O _  (positions 1, 2, 4 are locked)
- Letters confirmed to be in the word: S, E, O
- Letters ruled out so far: A, R, T, N, I, Z, B, U, M
- Still need two distinct letters for positions 3 and 5, chosen from the remaining alphabet excluding S, E, O, A, R, T, N, I, Z, B, U, M.

Remaining candidate letters (in roughly descending frequency): D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y

We need a valid 5-letter English word that starts with ""SE"" and has ""O"" in the 4th position: S E _ O _

Let’s list every valid English word that matches this pattern and contains only the remaining letters:

- S E D O _  → SEDOX (not a word), SEDGY (no), SEDAR (no), SEDAN (N ruled out)  
- S E F O _  → SEFOX (no), SEFOY (no)  
- S E G O _  → SEGOT (no), SEGOU (no)  
- S E H O _  → SEHON (N ruled out)  
- S E J O _  → SEJON (no)  
- S E K O _  → SEKOR (no)  
- S E L O _  → S E L O _  → “SELLO” (no), “SELOP” (no)  
- S E P O _  → SEPOD (no), SEPOL (no)  
- S E Q O _  → SEQOU (no)  
- S E V O _  → SEVOX (no)  
- S E W O _  → SEWOP (no)  
- S E X O _  → SEXON (N ruled out)  
- S E Y O _  → SEYON (no)

The only actual English word left that fits S E _ O _ and uses only the still-allowed letters is “SEWED” (but D is allowed and W is allowed). However, “SEWED” has D in position 5 and W in position 3: S E W O D. Let’s verify:
- Letters: S, E, W, O, D – none of these are ruled out.  
- Word is valid and matches the pattern.

Therefore, the next logical guess is “SEWED”.
