### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and frequently occurring consonants. After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", and ""CRANE"", I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it covers:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities.

- L is not in the word.
- A is not in the word.
- T is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
1. The word starts with S.
2. It contains T and E somewhere, but T is not in position 4 and E is not in position 5.
3. It does not contain L or A.

Possible positions for T and E:
- T could be in positions 2, 3, or 5.
- E could be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

We also need to avoid A and L. Let's think of words starting with S that include T and E but not A or L. Some candidates:
- STONE (but O and N haven't been tested yet)
- STEIN (but I hasn't been tested)
- STEAK (but A is excluded)
- STEPS (but P hasn't been tested)

""STONE"" seems promising because it includes T and E, avoids A and L, and tests new letters O and N. Let's try it.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and frequently occurring consonants. After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", and ""CRANE"", I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it covers:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1.
- L is not in the word.
- A is not in the word.
- T is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
1. The word starts with S.
2. It contains T and E somewhere, but T is not in position 4 and E is not in position 5.
3. It does not contain L or A.

Possible positions for T and E:
- T could be in positions 2, 3, or 5.
- E could be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

We also need to avoid A and L. Let's think of words starting with S that include T and E but not A or L. Some candidates:
- STONE (but O and N haven't been tested yet)
- STEIN (but I hasn't been tested)
- STEAK (but A is excluded)
- STEPS (but P hasn't been tested)

""STONE"" seems promising because it includes T and E, avoids A and L, and tests new letters O and N. Let's try it.

E must be in position 4 (since it can't be in position 5).

Possible candidates:
- STOEM – not a valid word.
- STOEP – not a valid word.
- STOER – archaic spelling of ""stoir"" (Scottish), but not common.
- STOES – plural of ""stoe"" (a Scottish unit), but obscure.
- STOET – not a word.
- STOEP – not a word.

Looking at valid English words: the only common one fitting S T O E _ is **STOKE**, but we just tried that.

From the feedback on STOPE:
- S, T, O are confirmed in positions 1-3.
- P is in the word but not in position 4 (-).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

Current pattern: S T O _ _

We know:
- E must be in position 4 (since it can't be in 5 and positions 1-3 are taken by S, T, O).
- P must be in position 5 (since it can't be in 4 and positions 1-3 are taken).

Thus, the word is S T O E P.

Let me verify:
- STOEP is not a valid English word.
- STOPE is a valid word, but we tried STOPE and P was marked as wrong position.
- STOKE was tried, P wasn't in STOKE.
- STOVE, STONE, SLATE feedback didn't mention P.

Wait, the pattern is S T O _ _ with P and E needing placement. Since P can't be in 4 and E can't be in 5, the only arrangement is S T O E P, but STOEP isn't valid. This suggests an inconsistency.

Re-examining:
- From STOPE feedback: P is in word but not in position 4.
- E is in word but not in position 5.
- Positions 1-3 are S, T, O.
- Thus, E must be in position 4 and P in position 5, forming S T O E P. But STOEP isn't valid.

This implies an error in earlier steps. Let me re-evaluate:
Actually, from STOKE and STOVE feedback, E was marked as wrong position (not 5), but could still be 4. P was introduced in STOPE and marked as wrong position (not 4), so P must be in 5. Thus, the word must be STOEP, but this isn't valid.

This suggests the only possible valid word fitting all constraints is STOKE, but we tried that. Rechecking valid English words, the correct word is likely STOKE, but since K was rejected, the next possible is STOPE, but P was rejected. This indicates the word must be STOES, but S is already in position 1 and E in 4 would make STOES.

Wait, let's list valid words matching S T O E _:
- STOES (valid, plural of stoe)
- STONE (invalid, N rejected)
- STOKE (invalid, K rejected)
- STOPE (invalid, P rejected)
- STOVE (invalid, V rejected)

The only remaining valid word is STOES. Let's try STOES.
