### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words, especially vowels and common consonants. This helps eliminate many possibilities early on.

Commonly recommended starting words include:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- ADIEU
- AUDIO
- RAISE

Looking at these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down the possibilities.

- S: not in the word (x)
- L: not in the word (x)
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)
- T: not in the word (x)
- E: correct position (✓) → last letter is E

So the word ends in E and contains A somewhere, but not in position 3. We also know S, L, and T are not present.

Good next candidates should:
1. Keep E in position 5
2. Include A in a different position (1, 2, or 4)
3. Avoid S, L, T
4. Use new common letters to test

Possible words:
- ARISE (but S is out)
- ANGLE (but L is out)
- AWARE (but W is less common)
- ADOBE (but D is less common)
- ACORN (but N is less common)

A better choice is ""AROSE"" - it includes:
- A in position 1 (new position)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S is out (from SLATE), but we can use S in other words
- E in correct position

Current known information:
- Pattern: A _ O R E (positions 1,3,4,5 are locked)
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, D, C
- We need a single letter for position 2 that is NOT any of S, L, T, D, C.

Possible remaining consonants for position 2: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words matching A _ O R E:
- ABODE – but D is excluded.
- AFORE – F is allowed.
- AGONE – G is allowed.
- ANORE – N is allowed.
- AMORE – M is allowed.
- AVORE – V is allowed.

Among these, “AFORE” is a common English word and uses F, which hasn’t been tested yet.
