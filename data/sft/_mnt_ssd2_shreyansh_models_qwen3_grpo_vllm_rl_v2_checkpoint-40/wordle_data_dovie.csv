### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these letters without repeating any. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters. This will give us information about the presence/absence of these five letters in the secret word.

From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - Word ends with E.
   - Contains O, but not in position 3.

2. TONED → T(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-) D(-)
   - O is now in the correct position (position 2).
   - E is in the word but not in position 5 (contradicts first feedback that E is in position 5).  
     Wait — this must be a typo in the feedback: the symbol “-” means “in the word but wrong position”.  
     So the second feedback says E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.  
     But the first feedback said E(✓) → E is in position 5.  
     These two statements are mutually exclusive.  
     The only way both can be true is if the feedback for TONED is using a different positional index.  
     Re-reading the rules: the feedback symbols are applied to the letters of the guess, not to absolute positions.  
     So for TONED, the feedback is:
        T(x)  → T not in word
        O(✓) → O is correct in position 2
        N(x) → N not in word
        E(-) → E is in word but not in position 4
        D(-) → D is in word but not in position 5

   Now reconcile with first guess:
   - From AROSE: E is in position 5 (✓).
   - From TONED: E is in word but not in position 4 (-).
   These are consistent: E is in position 5, so it’s not in position 4.

So far we know:
- Letters in word: O (position 2), E (position 5), D (somewhere except position 5).
- Letters not in word: A, R, S, T, N.

Word pattern: _ O _ _ E  
D must appear somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Possible letters left: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
We need a valid 5-letter word matching _ O _ _ E with D somewhere and no forbidden letters.

Candidate words:
- BLOKE – contains B, L, K; no forbidden letters, D missing → reject
- DOGGE – invalid (double G, not a common word)
- FOYER – contains F, Y; no D → reject
- GOODE – contains G, D; but D would be in position 4, which is allowed; check if GOODE is valid: yes, “goode” is an archaic spelling of “good”, but more importantly “GOODE” is recognized in Scrabble dictionaries.

But let’s find a more common word.  
“WOODE” is a valid word (variant of “woody”) but contains W, which is allowed.  
Check positions: _ O _ _ E  
D must be in positions 1, 3, or 4.  
“WOODE” has D in position 4 → allowed.

Another candidate: “HOODE” – but H is allowed and it places D in position 4.

“HOODE” is a valid word (archaic for hooded).

But let’s pick a more common word: “WOODE” or “DOPEY” – but DOPEY has Y and D in position 2 which conflicts with O in position 2.  
“DOPEY” is invalid because D would be in position 1, but we need O in position 2.

Correct pattern: _ O _ _ E  
D must be in 1, 3, or 4.

Valid words fitting _ O _ _ E with D in 1, 3, or 4:
- DOLLY – D in 1, L in 3 and 4, but L is repeated → reject
- DOPEY – D in 1, but P and Y are allowed; however E is in position 5, so DOPEY is D O P E Y → E is in position 4, but we know E must be in position 5 → reject
- DOWEL – D in 1, W in 3, E in 5, L in 4 → D O W E L → E is in position 4, but must be in 5 → reject
- DOPER – D in 1, O in 2, P in 3, E in 5, R in 4 → but R is forbidden → reject
- FOGIE – F, G, I; no D → reject
- GLOVE – G, L, V; no D → reject
- JOKER – J, K; R forbidden → reject
- KLOOF – K, L, F; no D → reject
- LODEM – L, D in 2 but O must be in 2 → reject
- MODOC – M, D in 3, O in 2, C in 5 → but C not in position 5 → reject
- MOVED – D in 4, M, O in 2, V, E in 5 → check letters: M, O, V, E, D – all allowed, no forbidden letters.  
  “MOVED” is a valid English word.

So the best next guess is MOVED.

Pattern check:
M _ O V E D – but we need 5 letters.  
Wait: MOVED is 5 letters: M O V E D.  
Positions: 1:M, 2:O (correct), 3:V, 4:E (but E must be in 5) – oops, E is in 4 here, which conflicts with first feedback that E is in position 5.  
So MOVED is invalid.

Next candidate: “WOODE” – W O O D E – double O, but that’s allowed; check positions: W O O D E → O is in 2 (correct), E in 5 (correct), D in 4 (allowed).  
“WOODE” is valid.

Another: “HOODE” – H O O D E → same structure, valid.

But let’s pick a word without double O: “BOGIE” – no D → reject  
“COBIE” – no D → reject  
“FOGIE” – no D → reject  

The simplest valid word with D in position 4 is “WOODE”.

But let’s double-check:  
Word must be _ O _ _ E with D in 1, 3, or 4.  
Valid words:
- D O _ _ E → DOWEL (E in 4 – invalid), DOPEY (E in 4 – invalid)  
- _ O D _ E → B O D E _ – no common word  
- _ O _ D E → B O X D E – invalid  
- _ O _ _ D E – too long  

Actually, the only common word fitting is “WOODE” (D in 4).

Thus, the next guess is W O O D E → but double O may not be optimal.  
Alternative: “PODGE” – P O D G E → positions: P(1), O(2), D(3), G(4), E(5) – perfect:  
- O in 2 (✓)  
- E in 5 (✓)  
- D in 3 (allowed)  
- No forbidden letters (A, R, S, T, N) – correct.  

“PODGE” is a valid 5-letter word.

Therefore, the next guess is PODGE.

Word must be _ O _ _ E with D in 1, 3, or 4.  
Valid words:
- D O _ _ E → DOWEL (E in 4 – invalid), DOPEY (E in 4 – invalid)  
- _ O D _ E → B O D E _ – no common word  
- _ O _ D E → B O X D E – invalid  
- _ O _ _ D E – too long  

Actually, the only common word fitting is “WOODE” (D in 4).

Thus, the next guess is W O O D E → but double O may not be optimal.  
Alternative: “PODGE” – P O D G E → positions: P(1), O(2), D(3), G(4), E(5) – perfect:  
- O in 2 (✓)  
- E in 5 (✓)  
- D in 3 (allowed)  
- No forbidden letters (A, R, S, T, N) – correct.  

“PODGE” is a valid 5-letter word.

Therefore, the next guess is PODGE.",Guess 3: PODGE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) D(-) G(x) E(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these letters without repeating any. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters. This will give us information about the presence/absence of these five letters in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- O: in the word but wrong position (-)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: correct position (✓) → the word ends with E

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains O somewhere, but not in position 3.
3. It does NOT contain A, R, or S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E
- Contains O (not in position 3)
- Avoids A, R, S

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Good candidates: DOPEY (but has Y), MOPEK, COPED, TONED, etc.

""TONED"" fits:
- Ends with E
- Contains O (in position 2, not 3)
- No A, R, S

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: TONED -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-) D(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - Word ends with E.
   - Contains O, but not in position 3.

2. TONED → T(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-) D(-)
   - O is now in the correct position (position 2).
   - E is in the word but not in position 5 (contradicts first feedback that E is in position 5).  
     Wait — this must be a typo in the feedback: the symbol “-” means “in the word but wrong position”.  
     So the second feedback says E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.  
     But the first feedback said E(✓) → E is in position 5.  
     These two statements are mutually exclusive.  
     The only way both can be true is if the feedback for TONED is using a different positional index.  
     Re-reading the rules: the feedback symbols are applied to the letters of the guess, not to absolute positions.  
     So for TONED, the feedback is:
        T(x)  → T not in word
        O(✓) → O is correct in position 2
        N(x) → N not in word
        E(-) → E is in word but not in position 4
        D(-) → D is in word but not in position 5

   Now reconcile with first guess:
   - From AROSE: E is in position 5 (✓).
   - From TONED: E is in word but not in position 4 (-).
   These are consistent: E is in position 5, so it’s not in position 4.

So far we know:
- Letters in word: O (position 2), E (position 5), D (somewhere except position 5).
- Letters not in word: A, R, S, T, N.

Word pattern: _ O _ _ E  
D must appear somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Possible letters left: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
We need a valid 5-letter word matching _ O _ _ E with D somewhere and no forbidden letters.

Candidate words:
- BLOKE – contains B, L, K; no forbidden letters, D missing → reject
- DOGGE – invalid (double G, not a common word)
- FOYER – contains F, Y; no D → reject
- GOODE – contains G, D; but D would be in position 4, which is allowed; check if GOODE is valid: yes, “goode” is an archaic spelling of “good”, but more importantly “GOODE” is recognized in Scrabble dictionaries.

But let’s find a more common word.  
“WOODE” is a valid word (variant of “woody”) but contains W, which is allowed.  
Check positions: _ O _ _ E  
D must be in positions 1, 3, or 4.  
“WOODE” has D in position 4 → allowed.

Another candidate: “HOODE” – but H is allowed and it places D in position 4.

“HOODE” is a valid word (archaic for hooded).

But let’s pick a more common word: “WOODE” or “DOPEY” – but DOPEY has Y and D in position 2 which conflicts with O in position 2.  
“DOPEY” is invalid because D would be in position 1, but we need O in position 2.

Correct pattern: _ O _ _ E  
D must be in 1, 3, or 4.

Valid words fitting _ O _ _ E with D in 1, 3, or 4:
- DOLLY – D in 1, L in 3 and 4, but L is repeated → reject
- DOPEY – D in 1, but P and Y are allowed; however E is in position 5, so DOPEY is D O P E Y → E is in position 4, but we know E must be in position 5 → reject
- DOWEL – D in 1, W in 3, E in 5, L in 4 → D O W E L → E is in position 4, but must be in 5 → reject
- DOPER – D in 1, O in 2, P in 3, E in 5, R in 4 → but R is forbidden → reject
- FOGIE – F, G, I; no D → reject
- GLOVE – G, L, V; no D → reject
- JOKER – J, K; R forbidden → reject
- KLOOF – K, L, F; no D → reject
- LODEM – L, D in 2 but O must be in 2 → reject
- MODOC – M, D in 3, O in 2, C in 5 → but C not in position 5 → reject
- MOVED – D in 4, M, O in 2, V, E in 5 → check letters: M, O, V, E, D – all allowed, no forbidden letters.  
  “MOVED” is a valid English word.

So the best next guess is MOVED.

Pattern check:
M _ O V E D – but we need 5 letters.  
Wait: MOVED is 5 letters: M O V E D.  
Positions: 1:M, 2:O (correct), 3:V, 4:E (but E must be in 5) – oops, E is in 4 here, which conflicts with first feedback that E is in position 5.  
So MOVED is invalid.

Next candidate: “WOODE” – W O O D E – double O, but that’s allowed; check positions: W O O D E → O is in 2 (correct), E in 5 (correct), D in 4 (allowed).  
“WOODE” is valid.

Another: “HOODE” – H O O D E → same structure, valid.

But let’s pick a word without double O: “BOGIE” – no D → reject  
“COBIE” – no D → reject  
“FOGIE” – no D → reject  

The simplest valid word with D in position 4 is “WOODE”.

But let’s double-check:  
Word must be _ O _ _ E with D in 1, 3, or 4.  
Valid words:
- D O _ _ E → DOWEL (E in 4 – invalid), DOPEY (E in 4 – invalid)  
- _ O D _ E → B O D E _ – no common word  
- _ O _ D E → B O X D E – invalid  
- _ O _ _ D E – too long  

Actually, the only common word fitting is “WOODE” (D in 4).

Thus, the next guess is W O O D E → but double O may not be optimal.  
Alternative: “PODGE” – P O D G E → positions: P(1), O(2), D(3), G(4), E(5) – perfect:  
- O in 2 (✓)  
- E in 5 (✓)  
- D in 3 (allowed)  
- No forbidden letters (A, R, S, T, N) – correct.  

“PODGE” is a valid 5-letter word.

Therefore, the next guess is PODGE.

Let's consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Letters in the word (with their positions):
- O is fixed in position 2.
- E is fixed in position 5.

Letters that must appear somewhere else:
- D is in the word but not in positions 3 or 5 (from TONED and PODGE feedback), so D must be in position 1 or 4.

Letters that have been ruled out:
A, R, S, T, N, P, G.

So the word looks like: [D or ?] O [?] [?] E, with D required somewhere.

Possible letters left: B, C, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2
- E in position 5
- D in position 1 or 4
- No forbidden letters

Candidate words:
- D O _ _ E: DOWEL (E in 4 – invalid), DOPEY (E in 4 – invalid)
- _ O _ D E: B O X D E – invalid, no such word
- _ O D _ E: B O D E _ – no valid word
- _ O _ _ D E – too long

Wait, let's think differently: the word must be _ O _ _ E with D in 1 or 4.

Valid words fitting this:
- D O _ _ E: DOWEL (E in 4 – invalid), DOPEY (E in 4 – invalid)
- _ O _ D E: B O X D E – invalid
- _ O D _ E: B O D E _ – invalid
- _ O _ _ D E – invalid length

Actually, let's list all 5-letter words ending in O...E with D in 1 or 4.

Valid words:
- D O B E L – invalid
- D O C E N – invalid
- D O M E S – S is forbidden
- D O M E T – T is forbidden
- D O V E Y – valid, but Y is allowed
- F O D E O – invalid
- H O D E D – invalid
- L O D E R – R is forbidden
- M O D E L – valid, L is allowed
- M O D E S – S is forbidden
- W O D E S – S is forbidden
- Y O D E L – valid, Y is allowed

Between these, the best candidates are:
- D O V E Y
- M O D E L
- Y O D E L

Check constraints:
- D must be in 1 or 4. In DOVEY, D is in 1 – allowed.
- E is in 5 – allowed.
- No forbidden letters.

MODEL has D in 3 – forbidden by feedback (D is not in 3).  
DOVEY: D(1), O(2), V(3), E(4), Y(5) – but E must be in 5 – invalid.  
Wait, DOVEY is D O V E Y: E is in 4 – invalid.

Next: YODEL: Y O D E L – E is in 4 – invalid.

Actually, no valid word fits _ O _ _ E with D in 1 or 4 except:

Looking again: the word must be _ O _ _ E with D in 1 or 4.

Valid words:
- D O _ _ E: DOWEL (E in 4 – invalid)
- _ O _ D E: B O X D E – invalid
- _ O D _ E: B O D E _ – invalid

This suggests we missed a word. Let me think of all 5-letter words ending in O...E with D in 1 or 4.

Valid words:
- D O M E S – S forbidden
- D O C E N – invalid
- D O V E R – R forbidden
- D O M E T – T forbidden
- D O L E D – invalid
- D O L E Y – valid, but E must be in 5 – invalid
- D O B E L – invalid
- F O D E O – invalid
- H O D E D – invalid
- L O D E R – R forbidden
- M O D E L – D in 3 – forbidden
- W O D E R – R forbidden
- Y O D E L – E in 4 – invalid

This is problematic. Let me re-examine the constraints.

Wait, the word must be _ O _ _ E with D in 1 or 4, and no forbidden letters.

Valid words:
- D O _ _ E: DOWEL (E in 4 – invalid)
- _ O _ D E: B O X D E – invalid
- _ O D _ E: B O D E _ – invalid

This implies the only possible placement is D in 1, but then the word would be D O _ _ E with E in 5, so D O _ _ E must have E in 5, making it D O _ _ E with E in 5. The only valid word is D O _ _ E ending in E, but that would require 4th letter to be E, which conflicts.

This suggests the word must be _ O _ D E with E in 5, but that would require D in 4 and E in 5, making it _ O _ D E.

Valid words:
- B O X D E – invalid
- C O V D E – invalid
- F O G D E – invalid
- H O L D E – valid, but H, O, L, D, E – all allowed, no forbidden letters.

""HOLDE"" is not a standard word, but ""HOLDE"" is archaic. The standard word is ""HOLDS"" – but S is forbidden.

Next: ""LODGE"" – L, O, D, G, E – G is forbidden.

""CODDE"" – invalid.

""VOGUE"" – no D.

""WODEE"" – invalid.

This is tricky. Let me list all 5-letter words ending in O...E with D in 1 or 4:

Valid words:
- D O _ _ E: DOWEL (E in 4 – invalid)
- _ O _ D E: B O X D E – invalid
- _ O D _ E: B O D E _ – invalid

This seems impossible. Re-examining the constraints:

From feedback:
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- E is in position 5 (✓)
- D is in word but not in positions 3 or 5 (from TONED and PODGE), so D must be in 1 or 4.

Thus the word must be:
- D O _ _ E (D in 1) or _ O _ D E (D in 4)

For D in 1: D O _ _ E – the only valid word is D O _ _ E with E in 5, so D O _ _ E must have E in 5, making it D O _ _ E with E in 5, which is impossible as it would be D O _ E _.

Wait, this is impossible. The only way this works is if the word is D O _ D E – but that would have D in 1 and 4, which is allowed.

Valid words:
- D O U D E – valid, but U is allowed, D in 1 and 4, E in 5.
- D O N D E – invalid, N is forbidden.

""Doude"" is archaic but valid. The standard word is ""DOUCE"" – but C is allowed.

""DOUCE"" is a valid word (French-derived, accepted in Scrabble).

Thus, the best next guess is DOUCE.

Check:

From all feedback so far:
- O is fixed in position 2.
- E is fixed in position 5.
- D must appear (and can only be in positions 1 or 4).
- Forbidden letters: A, R, S, T, N, P, G.

The only valid word fitting these constraints is DOUCE (D O U C E).

<guess>DOUCE</guess>",DOUCE,"Let's consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Letters in the word (with their positions):
- O is fixed in position 2.
- E is fixed in position 5.

Letters that must appear somewhere else:
- D is in the word but not in positions 3 or 5 (from TONED and PODGE feedback), so D must be in position 1 or 4.

Letters that have been ruled out:
A, R, S, T, N, P, G.

So the word looks like: [D or ?] O [?] [?] E, with D required somewhere.

Possible letters left: B, C, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2
- E in position 5
- D in position 1 or 4
- No forbidden letters

Candidate words:
- D O _ _ E: DOWEL (E in 4 – invalid), DOPEY (E in 4 – invalid)
- _ O _ D E: B O X D E – invalid, no such word
- _ O D _ E: B O D E _ – no valid word
- _ O _ _ D E – too long

Wait, let's think differently: the word must be _ O _ _ E with D in 1 or 4.

Valid words fitting this:
- D O _ _ E: DOWEL (E in 4 – invalid), DOPEY (E in 4 – invalid)
- _ O _ D E: B O X D E – invalid
- _ O D _ E: B O D E _ – invalid
- _ O _ _ D E – invalid length

Actually, let's list all 5-letter words ending in O...E with D in 1 or 4.

Valid words:
- D O B E L – invalid
- D O C E N – invalid
- D O M E S – S is forbidden
- D O M E T – T is forbidden
- D O V E Y – valid, but Y is allowed
- F O D E O – invalid
- H O D E D – invalid
- L O D E R – R is forbidden
- M O D E L – valid, L is allowed
- M O D E S – S is forbidden
- W O D E S – S is forbidden
- Y O D E L – valid, Y is allowed

Between these, the best candidates are:
- D O V E Y
- M O D E L
- Y O D E L

Check constraints:
- D must be in 1 or 4. In DOVEY, D is in 1 – allowed.
- E is in 5 – allowed.
- No forbidden letters.

MODEL has D in 3 – forbidden by feedback (D is not in 3).  
DOVEY: D(1), O(2), V(3), E(4), Y(5) – but E must be in 5 – invalid.  
Wait, DOVEY is D O V E Y: E is in 4 – invalid.

Next: YODEL: Y O D E L – E is in 4 – invalid.

Actually, no valid word fits _ O _ _ E with D in 1 or 4 except:

Looking again: the word must be _ O _ _ E with D in 1 or 4.

Valid words:
- D O _ _ E: DOWEL (E in 4 – invalid)
- _ O _ D E: B O X D E – invalid
- _ O D _ E: B O D E _ – invalid

This suggests we missed a word. Let me think of all 5-letter words ending in O...E with D in 1 or 4.

Valid words:
- D O M E S – S forbidden
- D O C E N – invalid
- D O V E R – R forbidden
- D O M E T – T forbidden
- D O L E D – invalid
- D O L E Y – valid, but E must be in 5 – invalid
- D O B E L – invalid
- F O D E O – invalid
- H O D E D – invalid
- L O D E R – R forbidden
- M O D E L – D in 3 – forbidden
- W O D E R – R forbidden
- Y O D E L – E in 4 – invalid

This is problematic. Let me re-examine the constraints.

Wait, the word must be _ O _ _ E with D in 1 or 4, and no forbidden letters.

Valid words:
- D O _ _ E: DOWEL (E in 4 – invalid)
- _ O _ D E: B O X D E – invalid
- _ O D _ E: B O D E _ – invalid

This implies the only possible placement is D in 1, but then the word would be D O _ _ E with E in 5, so D O _ _ E must have E in 5, making it D O _ _ E with E in 5. The only valid word is D O _ _ E ending in E, but that would require 4th letter to be E, which conflicts.

This suggests the word must be _ O _ D E with E in 5, but that would require D in 4 and E in 5, making it _ O _ D E.

Valid words:
- B O X D E – invalid
- C O V D E – invalid
- F O G D E – invalid
- H O L D E – valid, but H, O, L, D, E – all allowed, no forbidden letters.

""HOLDE"" is not a standard word, but ""HOLDE"" is archaic. The standard word is ""HOLDS"" – but S is forbidden.

Next: ""LODGE"" – L, O, D, G, E – G is forbidden.

""CODDE"" – invalid.

""VOGUE"" – no D.

""WODEE"" – invalid.

This is tricky. Let me list all 5-letter words ending in O...E with D in 1 or 4:

Valid words:
- D O _ _ E: DOWEL (E in 4 – invalid)
- _ O _ D E: B O X D E – invalid
- _ O D _ E: B O D E _ – invalid

This seems impossible. Re-examining the constraints:

From feedback:
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- E is in position 5 (✓)
- D is in word but not in positions 3 or 5 (from TONED and PODGE), so D must be in 1 or 4.

Thus the word must be:
- D O _ _ E (D in 1) or _ O _ D E (D in 4)

For D in 1: D O _ _ E – the only valid word is D O _ _ E with E in 5, so D O _ _ E must have E in 5, making it D O _ _ E with E in 5, which is impossible as it would be D O _ E _.

Wait, this is impossible. The only way this works is if the word is D O _ D E – but that would have D in 1 and 4, which is allowed.

Valid words:
- D O U D E – valid, but U is allowed, D in 1 and 4, E in 5.
- D O N D E – invalid, N is forbidden.
- D O C D E – invalid.

""Doude"" is archaic but valid. The standard word is ""DOUCE"" – but C is allowed.

""DOUCE"" is a valid word (French-derived, accepted in Scrabble).

Thus, the best next guess is DOUCE.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these letters without repeating any. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters. This will give us information about the presence/absence of these five letters in the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- O: in the word but wrong position (-)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: correct position (✓) → the word ends with E

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains O somewhere, but not in position 3.
3. It does NOT contain A, R, or S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E
- Contains O (not in position 3)
- Avoids A, R, S

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Good candidates: DOPEY (but has Y), MOPEK, COPED, TONED, etc.

""TONED"" fits:
- Ends with E
- Contains O (in position 2, not 3)
- No A, R, S

<guess>TONED</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: TONED -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-) D(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - Word ends with E.
   - Contains O, but not in position 3.

2. TONED → T(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-) D(-)
   - O is now in the correct position (position 2).
   - E is in the word but not in position 5 (contradicts first feedback that E is in position 5).  
     Wait — this must be a typo in the feedback: the symbol “-” means “in the word but wrong position”.  
     So the second feedback says E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.  
     But the first feedback said E(✓) → E is in position 5.  
     These two statements are mutually exclusive.  
     The only way both can be true is if the feedback for TONED is using a different positional index.  
     Re-reading the rules: the feedback symbols are applied to the letters of the guess, not to absolute positions.  
     So for TONED, the feedback is:
        T(x)  → T not in word
        O(✓) → O is correct in position 2
        N(x) → N not in word
        E(-) → E is in word but not in position 4
        D(-) → D is in word but not in position 5

   Now reconcile with first guess:
   - From AROSE: E is in position 5 (✓).
   - From TONED: E is in word but not in position 4 (-).
   These are consistent: E is in position 5, so it’s not in position 4.

So far we know:
- Letters in word: O (position 2), E (position 5), D (somewhere except position 5).
- Letters not in word: A, R, S, T, N.

Word pattern: _ O _ _ E  
D must appear somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Possible letters left: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
We need a valid 5-letter word matching _ O _ _ E with D somewhere and no forbidden letters.

Candidate words:
- BLOKE – contains B, L, K; no forbidden letters, D missing → reject
- DOGGE – invalid (double G, not a common word)
- FOYER – contains F, Y; no D → reject
- GOODE – contains G, D; but D would be in position 4, which is allowed; check if GOODE is valid: yes, “goode” is an archaic spelling of “good”, but more importantly “GOODE” is recognized in Scrabble dictionaries.

But let’s find a more common word.  
“WOODE” is a valid word (variant of “woody”) but contains W, which is allowed.  
Check positions: _ O _ _ E  
D must be in positions 1, 3, or 4.  
“WOODE” has D in position 4 → allowed.

Another candidate: “HOODE” – but H is allowed and it places D in position 4.

“HOODE” is a valid word (archaic for hooded).

But let’s pick a more common word: “WOODE” or “DOPEY” – but DOPEY has Y and D in position 2 which conflicts with O in position 2.  
“DOPEY” is invalid because D would be in position 1, but we need O in position 2.

Correct pattern: _ O _ _ E  
D must be in 1, 3, or 4.

Valid words fitting _ O _ _ E with D in 1, 3, or 4:
- DOLLY – D in 1, L in 3 and 4, but L is repeated → reject
- DOPEY – D in 1, but P and Y are allowed; however E is in position 5, so DOPEY is D O P E Y → E is in position 4, but we know E must be in position 5 → reject
- DOWEL – D in 1, W in 3, E in 5, L in 4 → D O W E L → E is in position 4, but must be in 5 → reject
- DOPER – D in 1, O in 2, P in 3, E in 5, R in 4 → but R is forbidden → reject
- FOGIE – F, G, I; no D → reject
- GLOVE – G, L, V; no D → reject
- JOKER – J, K; R forbidden → reject
- KLOOF – K, L, F; no D → reject
- LODEM – L, D in 2 but O must be in 2 → reject
- MODOC – M, D in 3, O in 2, C in 5 → but C not in position 5 → reject
- MOVED – D in 4, M, O in 2, V, E in 5 → check letters: M, O, V, E, D – all allowed, no forbidden letters.  
  “MOVED” is a valid English word.

So the best next guess is MOVED.

Pattern check:
M _ O V E D – but we need 5 letters.  
Wait: MOVED is 5 letters: M O V E D.  
Positions: 1:M, 2:O (correct), 3:V, 4:E (but E must be in 5) – oops, E is in 4 here, which conflicts with first feedback that E is in position 5.  
So MOVED is invalid.

Next candidate: “WOODE” – W O O D E – double O, but that’s allowed; check positions: W O O D E → O is in 2 (correct), E in 5 (correct), D in 4 (allowed).  
“WOODE” is valid.

Another: “HOODE” – H O O D E → same structure, valid.

But let’s pick a word without double O: “BOGIE” – no D → reject  
“COBIE” – no D → reject  
“FOGIE” – no D → reject  

The simplest valid word with D in position 4 is “WOODE”.

But let’s double-check:  
Word must be _ O _ _ E with D in 1, 3, or 4.  
Valid words:
- D O _ _ E → DOWEL (E in 4 – invalid), DOPEY (E in 4 – invalid)  
- _ O D _ E → B O D E _ – no common word  
- _ O _ D E → B O X D E – invalid  
- _ O _ _ D E – too long  

Actually, the only common word fitting is “WOODE” (D in 4).

Thus, the next guess is W O O D E → but double O may not be optimal.  
Alternative: “PODGE” – P O D G E → positions: P(1), O(2), D(3), G(4), E(5) – perfect:  
- O in 2 (✓)  
- E in 5 (✓)  
- D in 3 (allowed)  
- No forbidden letters (A, R, S, T, N) – correct.  

“PODGE” is a valid 5-letter word.

Therefore, the next guess is PODGE.

DOVEY: D(1), O(2), V(3), E(4), Y(5) – but E must be in 5 – invalid.

""VOGUE"" – no D.

This is tricky. Let me list all 5-letter words ending in O...E with D in 1 or 4:

Valid words:
- D O _ _ E: DOWEL (E in 4 – invalid)
- _ O _ D E: B O X D E – invalid
- _ O D _ E: B O D E _ – invalid

This seems impossible. Re-examining the constraints:

From feedback:
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- E is in position 5 (✓)
- D is in word but not in positions 3 or 5 (from TONED and PODGE), so D must be in 1 or 4.

Thus the word must be:
- D O _ _ E (D in 1) or _ O _ D E (D in 4)

For D in 1: D O _ _ E – the only valid word is D O _ _ E with E in 5, so D O _ _ E must have E in 5, making it D O _ _ E with E in 5, which is impossible as it would be D O _ E _.

Wait, this is impossible. The only way this works is if the word is D O _ D E – but that would have D in 1 and 4, which is allowed.

- D O C D E – invalid.

""Doude"" is archaic but valid. The standard word is ""DOUCE"" – but C is allowed.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these letters without repeating any. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters. This will give us information about the presence/absence of these five letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- O: in the word but wrong position (-)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: correct position (✓) → the word ends with E

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains O somewhere, but not in position 3.
3. It does NOT contain A, R, or S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E
- Contains O (not in position 3)
- Avoids A, R, S

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Good candidates: DOPEY (but has Y), MOPEK, COPED, TONED, etc.

""TONED"" fits:
- Ends with E
- Contains O (in position 2, not 3)
- No A, R, S

From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - Word ends with E.
   - Contains O, but not in position 3.

2. TONED → T(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-) D(-)
   - O is now in the correct position (position 2).
   - E is in the word but not in position 5 (contradicts first feedback that E is in position 5).  
     Wait — this must be a typo in the feedback: the symbol “-” means “in the word but wrong position”.  
     So the second feedback says E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.  
     But the first feedback said E(✓) → E is in position 5.  
     These two statements are mutually exclusive.  
     The only way both can be true is if the feedback for TONED is using a different positional index.  
     Re-reading the rules: the feedback symbols are applied to the letters of the guess, not to absolute positions.  
     So for TONED, the feedback is:
        T(x)  → T not in word
        O(✓) → O is correct in position 2
        N(x) → N not in word
        E(-) → E is in word but not in position 4
        D(-) → D is in word but not in position 5

   Now reconcile with first guess:
   - From AROSE: E is in position 5 (✓).
   - From TONED: E is in word but not in position 4 (-).
   These are consistent: E is in position 5, so it’s not in position 4.

So far we know:
- Letters in word: O (position 2), E (position 5), D (somewhere except position 5).
- Letters not in word: A, R, S, T, N.

Word pattern: _ O _ _ E  
D must appear somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Possible letters left: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
We need a valid 5-letter word matching _ O _ _ E with D somewhere and no forbidden letters.

Candidate words:
- BLOKE – contains B, L, K; no forbidden letters, D missing → reject
- DOGGE – invalid (double G, not a common word)
- FOYER – contains F, Y; no D → reject
- GOODE – contains G, D; but D would be in position 4, which is allowed; check if GOODE is valid: yes, “goode” is an archaic spelling of “good”, but more importantly “GOODE” is recognized in Scrabble dictionaries.

But let’s find a more common word.  
“WOODE” is a valid word (variant of “woody”) but contains W, which is allowed.  
Check positions: _ O _ _ E  
D must be in positions 1, 3, or 4.  
“WOODE” has D in position 4 → allowed.

Another candidate: “HOODE” – but H is allowed and it places D in position 4.

“HOODE” is a valid word (archaic for hooded).

But let’s pick a more common word: “WOODE” or “DOPEY” – but DOPEY has Y and D in position 2 which conflicts with O in position 2.  
“DOPEY” is invalid because D would be in position 1, but we need O in position 2.

Correct pattern: _ O _ _ E  
D must be in 1, 3, or 4.

Valid words fitting _ O _ _ E with D in 1, 3, or 4:
- DOLLY – D in 1, L in 3 and 4, but L is repeated → reject
- DOPEY – D in 1, but P and Y are allowed; however E is in position 5, so DOPEY is D O P E Y → E is in position 4, but we know E must be in position 5 → reject
- DOWEL – D in 1, W in 3, E in 5, L in 4 → D O W E L → E is in position 4, but must be in 5 → reject
- DOPER – D in 1, O in 2, P in 3, E in 5, R in 4 → but R is forbidden → reject
- FOGIE – F, G, I; no D → reject
- GLOVE – G, L, V; no D → reject
- JOKER – J, K; R forbidden → reject
- KLOOF – K, L, F; no D → reject
- LODEM – L, D in 2 but O must be in 2 → reject
- MODOC – M, D in 3, O in 2, C in 5 → but C not in position 5 → reject
- MOVED – D in 4, M, O in 2, V, E in 5 → check letters: M, O, V, E, D – all allowed, no forbidden letters.  
  “MOVED” is a valid English word.

So the best next guess is MOVED.

Pattern check:
M _ O V E D – but we need 5 letters.  
Wait: MOVED is 5 letters: M O V E D.  
Positions: 1:M, 2:O (correct), 3:V, 4:E (but E must be in 5) – oops, E is in 4 here, which conflicts with first feedback that E is in position 5.  
So MOVED is invalid.

Next candidate: “WOODE” – W O O D E – double O, but that’s allowed; check positions: W O O D E → O is in 2 (correct), E in 5 (correct), D in 4 (allowed).  
“WOODE” is valid.

Another: “HOODE” – H O O D E → same structure, valid.

But let’s pick a word without double O: “BOGIE” – no D → reject  
“COBIE” – no D → reject  
“FOGIE” – no D → reject  

The simplest valid word with D in position 4 is “WOODE”.

But let’s double-check:  
Word must be _ O _ _ E with D in 1, 3, or 4.  
Valid words:
- D O _ _ E → DOWEL (E in 4 – invalid), DOPEY (E in 4 – invalid)  
- _ O D _ E → B O D E _ – no common word  
- _ O _ D E → B O X D E – invalid  
- _ O _ _ D E – too long  

Actually, the only common word fitting is “WOODE” (D in 4).

Thus, the next guess is W O O D E → but double O may not be optimal.  
Alternative: “PODGE” – P O D G E → positions: P(1), O(2), D(3), G(4), E(5) – perfect:  
- O in 2 (✓)  
- E in 5 (✓)  
- D in 3 (allowed)  
- No forbidden letters (A, R, S, T, N) – correct.  

“PODGE” is a valid 5-letter word.

Therefore, the next guess is PODGE.

Let's consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Letters in the word (with their positions):
- O is fixed in position 2.
- E is fixed in position 5.

Letters that must appear somewhere else:
- D is in the word but not in positions 3 or 5 (from TONED and PODGE feedback), so D must be in position 1 or 4.

Letters that have been ruled out:
A, R, S, T, N, P, G.

So the word looks like: [D or ?] O [?] [?] E, with D required somewhere.

Possible letters left: B, C, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2
- E in position 5
- D in position 1 or 4
- No forbidden letters

Candidate words:
- D O _ _ E: DOWEL (E in 4 – invalid), DOPEY (E in 4 – invalid)
- _ O _ D E: B O X D E – invalid, no such word
- _ O D _ E: B O D E _ – no valid word
- _ O _ _ D E – too long

Wait, let's think differently: the word must be _ O _ _ E with D in 1 or 4.

Valid words fitting this:
- D O _ _ E: DOWEL (E in 4 – invalid), DOPEY (E in 4 – invalid)
- _ O _ D E: B O X D E – invalid
- _ O D _ E: B O D E _ – invalid
- _ O _ _ D E – invalid length

Actually, let's list all 5-letter words ending in O...E with D in 1 or 4.

Valid words:
- D O B E L – invalid
- D O C E N – invalid
- D O M E S – S is forbidden
- D O M E T – T is forbidden
- D O V E Y – valid, but Y is allowed
- F O D E O – invalid
- H O D E D – invalid
- L O D E R – R is forbidden
- M O D E L – valid, L is allowed
- M O D E S – S is forbidden
- W O D E S – S is forbidden
- Y O D E L – valid, Y is allowed

Between these, the best candidates are:
- D O V E Y
- M O D E L
- Y O D E L

Check constraints:
- D must be in 1 or 4. In DOVEY, D is in 1 – allowed.
- E is in 5 – allowed.
- No forbidden letters.

MODEL has D in 3 – forbidden by feedback (D is not in 3).  
DOVEY: D(1), O(2), V(3), E(4), Y(5) – but E must be in 5 – invalid.  
Wait, DOVEY is D O V E Y: E is in 4 – invalid.

Next: YODEL: Y O D E L – E is in 4 – invalid.

Actually, no valid word fits _ O _ _ E with D in 1 or 4 except:

Looking again: the word must be _ O _ _ E with D in 1 or 4.

Valid words:
- D O _ _ E: DOWEL (E in 4 – invalid)
- _ O _ D E: B O X D E – invalid
- _ O D _ E: B O D E _ – invalid

This suggests we missed a word. Let me think of all 5-letter words ending in O...E with D in 1 or 4.

Valid words:
- D O M E S – S forbidden
- D O C E N – invalid
- D O V E R – R forbidden
- D O M E T – T forbidden
- D O L E D – invalid
- D O L E Y – valid, but E must be in 5 – invalid
- D O B E L – invalid
- F O D E O – invalid
- H O D E D – invalid
- L O D E R – R forbidden
- M O D E L – D in 3 – forbidden
- W O D E R – R forbidden
- Y O D E L – E in 4 – invalid

This is problematic. Let me re-examine the constraints.

Wait, the word must be _ O _ _ E with D in 1 or 4, and no forbidden letters.

Valid words:
- D O _ _ E: DOWEL (E in 4 – invalid)
- _ O _ D E: B O X D E – invalid
- _ O D _ E: B O D E _ – invalid

This implies the only possible placement is D in 1, but then the word would be D O _ _ E with E in 5, so D O _ _ E must have E in 5, making it D O _ _ E with E in 5. The only valid word is D O _ _ E ending in E, but that would require 4th letter to be E, which conflicts.

This suggests the word must be _ O _ D E with E in 5, but that would require D in 4 and E in 5, making it _ O _ D E.

Valid words:
- B O X D E – invalid
- C O V D E – invalid
- F O G D E – invalid
- H O L D E – valid, but H, O, L, D, E – all allowed, no forbidden letters.

""HOLDE"" is not a standard word, but ""HOLDE"" is archaic. The standard word is ""HOLDS"" – but S is forbidden.

Next: ""LODGE"" – L, O, D, G, E – G is forbidden.

""CODDE"" – invalid.

""VOGUE"" – no D.

""WODEE"" – invalid.

This is tricky. Let me list all 5-letter words ending in O...E with D in 1 or 4:

Valid words:
- D O _ _ E: DOWEL (E in 4 – invalid)
- _ O _ D E: B O X D E – invalid
- _ O D _ E: B O D E _ – invalid

This seems impossible. Re-examining the constraints:

From feedback:
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- E is in position 5 (✓)
- D is in word but not in positions 3 or 5 (from TONED and PODGE), so D must be in 1 or 4.

Thus the word must be:
- D O _ _ E (D in 1) or _ O _ D E (D in 4)

For D in 1: D O _ _ E – the only valid word is D O _ _ E with E in 5, so D O _ _ E must have E in 5, making it D O _ _ E with E in 5, which is impossible as it would be D O _ E _.

Wait, this is impossible. The only way this works is if the word is D O _ D E – but that would have D in 1 and 4, which is allowed.

Valid words:
- D O U D E – valid, but U is allowed, D in 1 and 4, E in 5.
- D O N D E – invalid, N is forbidden.
- D O C D E – invalid.

""Doude"" is archaic but valid. The standard word is ""DOUCE"" – but C is allowed.

""DOUCE"" is a valid word (French-derived, accepted in Scrabble).

Thus, the best next guess is DOUCE.

Check:
- D in 1 (allowed)
- O in 2 (✓)
- U in 3
- C in 4
- E in 5 (✓)
- No forbidden letters (A, R, S, T, N, P, G) – correct.

<guess>DOUCE</guess>From all feedback so far:
- O is fixed in position 2.
- E is fixed in position 5.
- D must appear (and can only be in positions 1 or 4).
- Forbidden letters: A, R, S, T, N, P, G.

The only valid word fitting these constraints is DOUCE (D O U C E).

Guess 4: DOUCE -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) O(✓) U(x) C(x) E(✓)

<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on DOUCE:
- D(✓) → D is in position 1.
- O(✓) → O is in position 2 (already known).
- U(x) → U is not in the word.
- C(x) → C is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in position 5 (already known).

So the word is now fully determined:
- Position 1: D
- Position 2: O
- Position 5: E
- Positions 3 and 4: must be filled with letters not yet ruled out (no A, R, S, T, N, P, G, U, C).

Allowed letters for positions 3 and 4: B, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form D O _ _ E.

Looking at common words:
- DOBEE – invalid
- DOFIE – invalid
- DOHIE – invalid
- DOILE – invalid
- DOMIE – invalid
- DOVIE – invalid
- DOYIE – invalid
- DOBRE – invalid
- DOFFE – invalid
- DOHAE – invalid
- DOVAE – invalid
- DOYNE – invalid
- DOBIE – invalid
- DOFFE – invalid
- DOVRE – invalid
- DOBRE – invalid
- DOXIE – invalid
- DOZIE – invalid

The only standard word fitting D O _ _ E is DOZE – but it's 4 letters.

Wait, let's list all 5-letter words starting with DO and ending with E:
- DOBYE – archaic
- DOFIE – not standard
- DOGIE – G is forbidden
- DOPEE – P is forbidden
- DOUCE – already guessed
- DOVEY – E must be in 5, so D O V E Y – E is in 4 – invalid
- DOZIE – Z is allowed, but is it a word? ""DOZIE"" is not standard.

Actually, the only valid word is DOBYE (archaic for ""dobby""), but it's obscure.

However, ""DOBE"" is 4 letters. This suggests we missed a word.

Wait, let's think differently: the word is D O _ _ E with letters not in {A,R,S,T,N,P,G,U,C}.

Valid letters: B, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible combinations:
- D O B I E – ""DOBIE"" – not standard
- D O B L E – ""DOBLE"" – not standard
- D O F L E – ""DOFLE"" – invalid
- D O H I E – ""DOHIE"" – invalid
- D O H O E – ""DOHOE"" – invalid
- D O K I E – ""DOKIE"" – invalid
- D O L I E – ""DOLIE"" – invalid
- D O M I E – ""DOMIE"" – invalid
- D O V I E – ""DOVIE"" – invalid
- D O W I E – ""DOWIE"" – not standard
- D O X I E – ""DOXIE"" – invalid
- D O Z I E – ""DOZIE"" – invalid

This is problematic. The only possible word seems to be ""DOBYE"", but it's archaic.

Rechecking constraints: we have D O _ _ E with no A,R,S,T,N,P,G,U,C.

Looking at Scrabble dictionaries, the valid word is ""DOBYE"" (variant of ""dobby""), but it's obscure.

However, ""DOBYE"" is actually a valid Scrabble word.

Thus, the next guess is DOBYE.

But since we've used D, O, E, and need to fill B and Y, which are allowed.

<guess>DOBYE</guess>From the feedback, the word is now:
D(✓) O(✓) _ _ E(✓)

Forbidden letters so far: A, R, S, T, N, P, G, U, C.

The only valid 5-letter word starting with DO and ending with E is ""DOBYE"".

Current constraints after five guesses:

- Allowed letters for positions 3 and 4: F, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form D O _ _ E using only allowed letters.

Scanning the remaining possibilities:
- D O F F E – invalid (not a word)
- D O H I E – invalid

- D O L I E – invalid
- D O M I E – invalid
- D O V I E – invalid

- D O X I E – invalid
- D O Z I E – invalid

The only standard English word that fits D O _ _ E and uses allowed letters is ""DOZIE"" (a colloquial term for ""dodzie"" – though rare), but it's not standard.

Rechecking: the valid Scrabble word is ""DOZIE"", but it's obscure.

However, ""DOZIE"" is recognized in some dictionaries.

Thus, the final guess is DOZIE.

If that fails, we'd have to consider ""DOHIE"" or similar, but they're invalid.

Given constraints, DOZIE is the only possible word left.
