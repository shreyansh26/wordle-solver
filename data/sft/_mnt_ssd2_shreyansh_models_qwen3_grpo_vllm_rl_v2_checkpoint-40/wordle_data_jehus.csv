For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any. 

Some popular choices include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers 5 very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ E _ _ S
- Letters confirmed present: E (pos 2), S (pos 5)
- Letters confirmed absent: L, A, T, P, R, K
- S is already fixed at position 5, so we can ignore the “-” on S in round 1.

Remaining consonants to try: N, D, C, M, B, F, G, H, V, W, Y, etc.

- can fit with the pattern _ E _ _ S

A good candidate is “MEWES” – but that repeats E and isn’t ideal.  
Try “NEONS” – but O is in position 4 and N/E/O/S are all allowed.  
Wait, let’s pick a word that uses new letters.

How about “BESOM”?

- Fits _ E _ _ S pattern with S at the end.

Another candidate: “DESKS” – but K is banned.  
“HEXES” – X is uncommon, but allowed.  
“WESHS” – not a valid word.

“BESOM” seems valid and introduces new letters B, O, M.

But let’s double-check:  
B E S O M → positions 1-5.

Guess 2: PERKS -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(✓) R(x) K(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 – SLATE  
S(-)  → S is in the word, but not in position 1  
L(x), A(x), T(x) → L, A, T are not in the word  
E(-) → E is in the word, but not in position 5  

Round 2 – PERKS  
P(x), R(x), K(x) → P, R, K are not in the word  
E(✓) → E is in position 2  
S(✓) → S is in position 5  

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ E _ _ S
- Letters confirmed present: E (pos 2), S (pos 5)
- Letters confirmed absent: L, A, T, P, R, K
- S is already fixed at position 5, so we can ignore the “-” on S in round 1.

Remaining consonants to try: N, D, C, M, B, F, G, H, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels to try: I, O, U (A is out).

We need three more letters for positions 1, 3, 4 that:
- are not L, A, T, P, R, K  
- can fit with the pattern _ E _ _ S

A good candidate is “MEWES” – but that repeats E and isn’t ideal.  
Try “NEONS” – but O is in position 4 and N/E/O/S are all allowed.  
Wait, let’s pick a word that uses new letters.

How about “BESOM”?  
- B, E, S, O, M – none of the banned letters.  
- Fits _ E _ _ S pattern with S at the end.

Another candidate: “DESKS” – but K is banned.  
“HEXES” – X is uncommon, but allowed.  
“WESHS” – not a valid word.

“BESOM” seems valid and introduces new letters B, O, M.

But let’s double-check:  
B E S O M → positions 1-5.  
We know E is fixed at 2, S at 5, so pattern is B E _ _ S.  
The middle letters 3 & 4 must be from allowed letters.

“BESOM” fits the constraints and is a valid English word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any. 

Some popular choices include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers 5 very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- L is not in the word.
- A is not in the word.
- T is not in the word.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 5).

So we know:
- The word contains S and E, but not L, A, or T.
- S is not in position 1, and E is not in position 5.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S and E.
2. Does not contain L, A, or T.
3. S is not in position 1.
4. E is not in position 5.

Good consonants to try next: R, N, D, C, M, P, H, G, B, F, V, K, W, Y, etc.
Good vowels to try: I, O, U (since A is out).

Let’s try a word like ""SHINE"":
- S in position 1 (but feedback says S is not in position 1, so this is bad).
Next try ""RISEN"":
- S in position 4 (allowed), E in position 5 (but feedback says E is not in position 5, so this is bad).
Next try ""SPICE"":
- S in position 1 (bad), P, I, C, E.
Next try ""CRISP"":
- S in position 4, E is missing.
Next try ""WISPE"":
- Not a valid word.
Next try ""SENIC"":
- S in position 1 (bad).
Next try ""PERKS"":
- S in position 5, E in position 2.
This seems valid:
- Contains S and E.
- Does not contain L, A, or T.
- S is in position 5 (allowed), E is in position 2 (allowed).

""PERKS"" is a valid 5-letter word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any. 

Some popular choices include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers 5 very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- L is not in the word.
- A is not in the word.
- T is not in the word.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 5).

So we know:
- The word contains S and E, but not L, A, or T.
- S is not in position 1, and E is not in position 5.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S and E.
2. Does not contain L, A, or T.
3. S is not in position 1.
4. E is not in position 5.

Good consonants to try next: R, N, D, C, M, P, H, G, B, F, V, K, W, Y, etc.
Good vowels to try: I, O, U (since A is out).

Let’s try a word like ""SHINE"":
- S in position 1 (but feedback says S is not in position 1, so this is bad).
Next try ""RISEN"":
- S in position 4 (allowed), E in position 5 (but feedback says E is not in position 5, so this is bad).
Next try ""SPICE"":
- S in position 1 (bad), P, I, C, E.
Next try ""CRISP"":
- S in position 4, E is missing.
Next try ""WISPE"":
- Not a valid word.
Next try ""SENIC"":
- S in position 1 (bad).
Next try ""PERKS"":
- S in position 5, E in position 2.
This seems valid:
- Contains S and E.
- Does not contain L, A, or T.
- S is in position 5 (allowed), E is in position 2 (allowed).

""PERKS"" is a valid 5-letter word.

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 – SLATE  
S(-)  → S is in the word, but not in position 1  
L(x), A(x), T(x) → L, A, T are not in the word  
E(-) → E is in the word, but not in position 5  

Round 2 – PERKS  
P(x), R(x), K(x) → P, R, K are not in the word  
E(✓) → E is in position 2  
S(✓) → S is in position 5  

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ E _ _ S
- Letters confirmed present: E (pos 2), S (pos 5)
- Letters confirmed absent: L, A, T, P, R, K
- S is already fixed at position 5, so we can ignore the “-” on S in round 1.

Remaining consonants to try: N, D, C, M, B, F, G, H, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels to try: I, O, U (A is out).

We need three more letters for positions 1, 3, 4 that:
- are not L, A, T, P, R, K  
- can fit with the pattern _ E _ _ S

A good candidate is “MEWES” – but that repeats E and isn’t ideal.  
Try “NEONS” – but O is in position 4 and N/E/O/S are all allowed.  
Wait, let’s pick a word that uses new letters.

How about “BESOM”?  
- B, E, S, O, M – none of the banned letters.  
- Fits _ E _ _ S pattern with S at the end.

Another candidate: “DESKS” – but K is banned.  
“HEXES” – X is uncommon, but allowed.  
“WESHS” – not a valid word.

“BESOM” seems valid and introduces new letters B, O, M.

But let’s double-check:  
B E S O M → positions 1-5.  
We know E is fixed at 2, S at 5, so pattern is B E _ _ S.  
The middle letters 3 & 4 must be from allowed letters.

“BESOM” fits the constraints and is a valid English word.

Looking for valid words:
- ""WESHS"" – invalid.
- ""HEXES"" – X is allowed, but is it common? Maybe.
- ""DEWES"" – W is allowed, but ""DEWES"" is valid (plural of dew).
- ""NEVES"" – N, E, V, E, S – V is allowed, but ""NEVES"" is not common.
- ""FENES"" – not a word.
- ""VENES"" – not a word.
- ""HENES"" – not a word.

""HEXES"" seems the most plausible valid word fitting the pattern and using allowed letters (H, E, X, E, S). X is allowed since it hasn't been marked absent.

From the five rounds of feedback we now have the following constraints:

1. Pattern: _ E _ _ S  
   (E is locked in position 2, S is locked in position 5)

2. Letters known to be absent:  
   L, A, T, P, R, K, B, O, M, X, W, N, D

3. Letters still allowed for positions 1, 3, 4:  
   C, F, G, I, U, V, Y, H (H is allowed but cannot be in position 1 because in Guess 4 it showed up as “-” in position 1)

4. Position 1 cannot be H (because H appeared in Guess 4 as “H(-)”).

5. Position 3 and 4 can be any of the remaining allowed letters.

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form  
? E ? ? S  
using only the allowed letters for the three open slots.

Scanning the remaining letters, the only common combinations that form real words are:

- F E I S → too short  
- F E N I S → “FENIS” not valid  
- G E I S → “GEIS” not valid  
- C E I S → “CEIS” not valid  
- V E I S → “VEIS” not valid  
- Y E I S → “YEIS” not valid  

But one clear valid word emerges:  
F E I S → “FEIST” is 5 letters, uses F, E, I, S, and T is already known absent, so that fails.  

Another candidate:  
G E I S → “GEIST” uses G, E, I, S, T again absent.  

Wait—let’s list remaining consonants: C, F, G, V, Y, H (but H can’t start).  

A real word that fits is “FEIST” but T is banned.  

Next: “GEIST” – T banned.  

“CEIST” – T banned.  

“VEIST” – T banned.  

“YEIST” – T banned.  

“FELIS” – L banned.  

“FENIS” – N and I, but N is banned.  

“FEGIS” – G, I, S – but “FEGIS” is not a recognized English word.  

“FEGIS” is not valid.  

“FEGIS” fails.  

Another pattern: positions 3 & 4 could be I and another consonant.  

“FEGIS” fails.  

“FEGIS” fails.  

Realizing the only remaining valid English word that fits the pattern and uses allowed letters is “FEIST” but T is banned.  

We must have missed a word.  

Re-examining the allowed letters: C, F, G, I, U, V, Y.  

A valid word: “FEGIS” is not valid.  

“FEIGS” – uses F, E, I, G, S – “FEIGS” is a valid variant of “feign” in some contexts, but obscure.  

“FEIGS” is acceptable.  

Another candidate: “FEIGS” is 5 letters, uses F, E, I, G, S – none of these letters are banned.  

Therefore, “FEIGS” is a valid next guess.
