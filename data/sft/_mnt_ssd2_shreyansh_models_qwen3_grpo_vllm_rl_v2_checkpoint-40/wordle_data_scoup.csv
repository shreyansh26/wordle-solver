For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, helping narrow down future possibilities. Let me go with AROSE.

Alternative: ""SPOIL"" - but S is first, which is allowed (not in 4th spot). But we don't know about S yet.

Better approach: try to place S in position 1, 2, or 5 (since 3 is O and 4 is excluded).

Or S _ O U _  (U in position 4)
Or S _ O _ U  (U in position 5)

Let's try S _ O U _:
We need a consonant in position 2 and a consonant in position 5.
Possible options: S C O U T, S P O U T, S M O K U (but K and M are allowed), etc.

""SPOUT"" fits:
- S P O U T
- Starts with S, third letter O, contains U in position 4.
- Letters: S, P, O, U, T — none of A, R, E, N, D.
- P and T are unused so far.

Let's try SPOUT.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

1. Positional certainties
   - Position 1: S (✓ from SOUND and SPOUT)
   - Position 3: O (✓ from AROSE and SPOUT)
   - Position 4: U (✓ from SPOUT)

   So the pattern is: S _ O U _

2. Letters we know are NOT in the word
   A, R, E, N, D, T

3. Letters we know are in the word but not yet placed
   - From SOUND: P was marked “-” (wrong position) but P itself is still allowed and must appear somewhere else.
   - From SPOUT: P was in position 2 and marked “-”, so P must appear in position 5 (the only remaining blank).

4. Therefore the word must be
   S _ O U P

5. The blank (position 2) must be a letter we have not ruled out and not yet placed.
   Allowed letters so far (excluding A,R,E,N,D,T,O,S,U,P): B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

6. Common 5-letter words fitting “S _ O U P”:
   - SCOUR (but R is excluded)
   - SHOU_P → no common word
   - STOU_P → T is excluded
   - SP_OUP → already have P in 5
   - The only valid remaining candidate is “SCOUP” (a variant spelling of “scoup” or “scoop” without the second O), but that’s not standard.
   - Re-examining, the only standard English word fitting S _ O U P is “SCOUR” (but R is excluded).

Wait—let’s double-check standard dictionaries. The only standard 5-letter word matching S _ O U P with remaining letters is “SCOUP” (not common), but actually “SCOUR” is invalid due to R. 

However, “SCOUR” is the only dictionary entry, and R is excluded. This implies an inconsistency—likely I missed an alternative placement for P.

Re-examining feedback:
- P was marked “-” in SPOUT (position 2), meaning P is in the word but not in position 2. Remaining possible positions for P: 5 (since 1,3,4 are taken). Therefore P must indeed be in position 5.

Thus the word is S _ O U P, and the only standard English word fitting this with allowed letters is “SCOUR” (but R is excluded). This suggests an error in earlier assumption.

Rechecking: allowed letters for position 2 must exclude A,R,E,N,D,T. From remaining letters, “C” is common and not yet used. “SCOUR” is invalid (R excluded). 

Realisation: there is no standard 5-letter word of the form S _ O U P without using excluded letters. Therefore the only plausible conclusion is that the word is “SCOUP” (an accepted variant), or I missed another candidate.

But standard Wordle accepts “SCOUP” as a valid guess (a historical term). Given constraints, this must be the answer.

Therefore the next (and likely final) guess is SCOUP.
