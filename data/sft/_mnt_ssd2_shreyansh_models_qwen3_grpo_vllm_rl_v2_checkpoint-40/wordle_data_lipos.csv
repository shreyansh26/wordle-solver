### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". These words use frequently occurring letters in English.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes:
- A: very common first letter
- R: common consonant
- O: common vowel
- S: very common letter
- E: most common letter in English

This should give good coverage for the first guess.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, E, U, N, D  
Letters that ARE in the word (but in the wrong positions so far): O, S  

Positions ruled out:
- O cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE) or 2 (from SOUND).
- S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) or 1 (from SOUND).

So the word must contain both O and S, and they must sit in positions other than:
- O: not 2 or 3
- S: not 1 or 4

Common remaining consonants and vowels we haven’t tried: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s place O in position 1 and S in position 3 (both positions are still allowed).  
The remaining three letters must come from the unused pool and form a valid word.

A quick scan of 5-letter words that fit the pattern “OS???” gives “OVOID” (but we already know D is out), “OSTIA” (A is out), “OSTIN” (N is out), “OSTGE” (E is out).  
Next candidate: “OCHOS” – but that repeats O and S too much and isn’t common.

Instead, let’s try “HOTSP” – no, that’s not a word.  
“FOIST” – F, O, I, S, T.  
Check constraints:
- Contains O and S (✓)  
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since we only ruled out 2 and 3, but wait – from SOUND we ruled out position 2 for O. So O can’t be in 2.  
So “FOIST” is invalid.

Next candidate: “POSIT” – P, O, I, S, T.  
O is in position 2 – again ruled out.

Next: “TOSIC” – not a common word.

Let’s try placing O in position 4 and S in position 2.  
Pattern: _ S _ O _.  
A common word fitting this is “SHOCK”:
- S (position 2) – allowed  
- O (position 4) – allowed  
- Letters H, C, K are unused so far.  
Check: S and O are present, no forbidden letters.  
“SHOCK” looks valid.

Therefore, the next guess is SHOCK.

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, E, U, N, D, H, C, K  
Letters that ARE in the word (but still in unknown positions): O, S  

Positions ruled out:
- O cannot be in 2, 3, or 4 (from SOUND and SHOCK)
- S cannot be in 1, 2, 3, or 4 (from SOUND, AROSE, SHOCK)

So:
- O must be in position 1 or 5.
- S must be in position 5 (since 1-4 are all ruled out).

That forces the word pattern: O _ _ _ S, with O in 1 and S in 5.

Letters still allowed (excluding the eliminated ones): B, F, G, I, J, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need three letters for positions 2-4, forming a valid 5-letter word ending in S and starting with O.

Common words fitting “O _ _ _ S”:
- OLIVE – ends in E (eliminated)
- ORBIT – ends in T, but R is eliminated
- OPENS – ends in S, uses P, E, N; E and N are eliminated
- OTTER – ends in R (eliminated)
- OBTUS – not common

- OLDS – too short
- OPIKS – not a word

Wait, let’s list all possible 5-letter words starting with O and ending with S, using only allowed letters:

Allowed letters: B, F, G, I, J, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus O, S)

Possible combinations:
- O B I T S – “OBITS” – valid word (plural of obituary)

- O L I T S – “OLITS” – not a word
- O P B S – too short
- O P I S – too short
- O B T S – too short

“OBITS” is the only common 5-letter word fitting the pattern “O _ _ _ S” using allowed letters.

- Uses B, I, T – none are eliminated

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". These words use frequently occurring letters in English.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes:
- A: very common first letter
- R: common consonant
- O: common vowel
- S: very common letter
- E: most common letter in English

This should give good coverage for the first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains O and S somewhere.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has O and S.
2. Does NOT have A, R, or E.
3. Places O and S in different positions than in AROSE (O was 3rd, S was 4th).

Possible letters left (excluding A, R, E): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try to place O and S in new positions and fill the rest with other common letters. A good candidate is ""SOUND"":
- S is now 1st (was 4th).
- O is now 2nd (was 3rd).
- Uses U, N, D which are common and haven't been ruled out.

Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, E, U, N, D  
Letters that ARE in the word (but in the wrong positions so far): O, S  

Positions ruled out:
- O cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE) or 2 (from SOUND).
- S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) or 1 (from SOUND).

So the word must contain both O and S, and they must sit in positions other than:
- O: not 2 or 3
- S: not 1 or 4

Common remaining consonants and vowels we haven’t tried: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s place O in position 1 and S in position 3 (both positions are still allowed).  
The remaining three letters must come from the unused pool and form a valid word.

A quick scan of 5-letter words that fit the pattern “OS???” gives “OVOID” (but we already know D is out), “OSTIA” (A is out), “OSTIN” (N is out), “OSTGE” (E is out).  
Next candidate: “OCHOS” – but that repeats O and S too much and isn’t common.

Instead, let’s try “HOTSP” – no, that’s not a word.  
“FOIST” – F, O, I, S, T.  
Check constraints:
- Contains O and S (✓)  
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since we only ruled out 2 and 3, but wait – from SOUND we ruled out position 2 for O. So O can’t be in 2.  
So “FOIST” is invalid.

Next candidate: “POSIT” – P, O, I, S, T.  
O is in position 2 – again ruled out.

Next: “TOSIC” – not a common word.

Let’s try placing O in position 4 and S in position 2.  
Pattern: _ S _ O _.  
A common word fitting this is “SHOCK”:
- S (position 2) – allowed  
- O (position 4) – allowed  
- Letters H, C, K are unused so far.  
Check: S and O are present, no forbidden letters.  
“SHOCK” looks valid.

Therefore, the next guess is SHOCK.

So:
- O must be in position 1 or 5.
- S must be in position 5 (since 1-4 are all ruled out).

That forces the word pattern: O _ _ _ S, with O in 1 and S in 5.

Letters still allowed (excluding the eliminated ones): B, F, G, I, J, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need three letters for positions 2-4, forming a valid 5-letter word ending in S and starting with O.

Common words fitting “O _ _ _ S”:

From the latest feedback:

- S is now confirmed in position 5 (✓).
- O is in the word but NOT in position 1 (-).
- B and T are NOT in the word (x).
- I is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).

So far we know:
Letters that must appear: O, S (and S is fixed at position 5).
Letters that must NOT appear: A, R, E, U, N, D, H, C, K, B, T.
Positions ruled out:
- O cannot be in 1, 2, 3, or 4 (from earlier guesses).
- I cannot be in 3.
- S is fixed in 5.

That leaves only position 5 for S, and positions 2, 3, 4 for O and I (but O can’t be in 2,3,4 either from earlier feedback). This seems impossible because O was ruled out of positions 2,3,4 in SOUND and SHOCK, and position 1 is now ruled out in OBITS. This implies O must be in position 5, but position 5 is already taken by S. This suggests an inconsistency, but likely I misread.

Rechecking:
From SOUND: O(-) means O is in word but not in position 2.
From SHOCK: O(-) means O is in word but not in position 3.
From OBITS: O(-) means O is in word but not in position 1.
Thus O can only be in position 4.

Similarly, I(-) from OBITS means I is in word but not in position 3.

So the word must be: _ _ _ O S, with:
- O in 4
- S in 5
- Must contain I somewhere (positions 2 or 3)
- Must not contain any eliminated letters: A, R, E, U, N, D, H, C, K, B, T.

Allowed letters: F, G, I, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus O, S).

We need a 5-letter word ending in OS with O in 4 and I in 2 or 3.

- _ I _ O S

- S is now confirmed in position 5 (✓).
- O is in the word but NOT in position 1 (-).

So far we know:
Letters that must appear: O, S (and S is fixed at position 5).
Letters that must NOT appear: A, R, E, U, N, D, H, C, K, B, T.
Positions ruled out:
- O cannot be in 1, 2, 3, or 4 (from earlier guesses).
- I cannot be in 3.
- S is fixed in 5.

That leaves only position 5 for S, and positions 2, 3, 4 for O and I (but O can’t be in 2,3,4 either from earlier feedback).

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". These words use frequently occurring letters in English.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes:
- A: very common first letter
- R: common consonant
- O: common vowel
- S: very common letter
- E: most common letter in English

This should give good coverage for the first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains O and S somewhere.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has O and S.
2. Does NOT have A, R, or E.
3. Places O and S in different positions than in AROSE (O was 3rd, S was 4th).

Possible letters left (excluding A, R, E): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try to place O and S in new positions and fill the rest with other common letters. A good candidate is ""SOUND"":
- S is now 1st (was 4th).
- O is now 2nd (was 3rd).
- Uses U, N, D which are common and haven't been ruled out.

Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, E, U, N, D  
Letters that ARE in the word (but in the wrong positions so far): O, S  

Positions ruled out:
- O cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE) or 2 (from SOUND).
- S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) or 1 (from SOUND).

So the word must contain both O and S, and they must sit in positions other than:
- O: not 2 or 3
- S: not 1 or 4

Common remaining consonants and vowels we haven’t tried: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s place O in position 1 and S in position 3 (both positions are still allowed).  
The remaining three letters must come from the unused pool and form a valid word.

A quick scan of 5-letter words that fit the pattern “OS???” gives “OVOID” (but we already know D is out), “OSTIA” (A is out), “OSTIN” (N is out), “OSTGE” (E is out).  
Next candidate: “OCHOS” – but that repeats O and S too much and isn’t common.

Instead, let’s try “HOTSP” – no, that’s not a word.  
“FOIST” – F, O, I, S, T.  
Check constraints:
- Contains O and S (✓)  
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since we only ruled out 2 and 3, but wait – from SOUND we ruled out position 2 for O. So O can’t be in 2.  
So “FOIST” is invalid.

Next candidate: “POSIT” – P, O, I, S, T.  
O is in position 2 – again ruled out.

Next: “TOSIC” – not a common word.

Let’s try placing O in position 4 and S in position 2.  
Pattern: _ S _ O _.  
A common word fitting this is “SHOCK”:
- S (position 2) – allowed  
- O (position 4) – allowed  
- Letters H, C, K are unused so far.  
Check: S and O are present, no forbidden letters.  
“SHOCK” looks valid.

Therefore, the next guess is SHOCK.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 3: SHOCK -> FEEDBACK: S(-) H(x) O(-) C(x) K(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, E, U, N, D, H, C, K  
Letters that ARE in the word (but still in unknown positions): O, S  

Positions ruled out:
- O cannot be in 2, 3, or 4 (from SOUND and SHOCK)
- S cannot be in 1, 2, 3, or 4 (from SOUND, AROSE, SHOCK)

So:
- O must be in position 1 or 5.
- S must be in position 5 (since 1-4 are all ruled out).

That forces the word pattern: O _ _ _ S, with O in 1 and S in 5.

Letters still allowed (excluding the eliminated ones): B, F, G, I, J, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need three letters for positions 2-4, forming a valid 5-letter word ending in S and starting with O.

Common words fitting “O _ _ _ S”:
- OLIVE – ends in E (eliminated)
- ORBIT – ends in T, but R is eliminated
- OPENS – ends in S, uses P, E, N; E and N are eliminated
- OTTER – ends in R (eliminated)
- OBTUS – not common
- OPICS – C is eliminated
- OPIUMS – too long
- OXTAL – not common
- OLDS – too short
- OPIKS – not a word
- OPIUM – ends in M, but 5 letters
- OPIST – not a word
- OPIKS – not valid
- OPIST – not valid

Wait, let’s list all possible 5-letter words starting with O and ending with S, using only allowed letters:

Allowed letters: B, F, G, I, J, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus O, S)

Possible combinations:
- O B I T S – “OBITS” – valid word (plural of obituary)
- O P I T S – “OPITS” – not a word
- O L I T S – “OLITS” – not a word
- O P B S – too short
- O P I S – too short
- O B T S – too short
- O P T S – too short

“OBITS” is the only common 5-letter word fitting the pattern “O _ _ _ S” using allowed letters.

Let’s verify:
- Starts with O (position 1) – allowed
- Ends with S (position 5) – allowed
- Uses B, I, T – none are eliminated
- No A, R, E, U, N, D, H, C, K
- O and S are confirmed in the word

Therefore, the next guess is OBITS.

- S is now confirmed in position 5 (✓).
- O is in the word but NOT in position 1 (-).
- B and T are NOT in the word (x).
- I is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).

So far we know:
Letters that must appear: O, S (and S is fixed at position 5).
Letters that must NOT appear: A, R, E, U, N, D, H, C, K, B, T.
Positions ruled out:
- O cannot be in 1, 2, 3, or 4 (from earlier guesses).
- I cannot be in 3.
- S is fixed in 5.

That leaves only position 5 for S, and positions 2, 3, 4 for O and I (but O can’t be in 2,3,4 either from earlier feedback). This seems impossible because O was ruled out of positions 2,3,4 in SOUND and SHOCK, and position 1 is now ruled out in OBITS. This implies O must be in position 5, but position 5 is already taken by S. This suggests an inconsistency, but likely I misread.

Rechecking:
From SOUND: O(-) means O is in word but not in position 2.
From SHOCK: O(-) means O is in word but not in position 3.
From OBITS: O(-) means O is in word but not in position 1.
Thus O can only be in position 4.

Similarly, I(-) from OBITS means I is in word but not in position 3.

So the word must be: _ _ _ O S, with:

This suggests an inconsistency, but likely I misread.\n\nRechecking:\nFrom SOUND: O(-) means O is in word but not in position 2.\nFrom SHOCK: O(-) means O is in word but not in position 3.\nFrom OBITS: O(-) means O is in word but not in position 1.\nThus O can only be in position 4.\n\nSimilarly, I(-) from OBITS means I is in word but not in position 3.\n\nSo the word must be: _ _ _ O S, with:\n- O in 4\n- S in 5\n- Must contain I somewhere (positions 2 or 3)\n- Must not contain any eliminated letters: A, R, E, U, N, D, H, C, K, B, T.\n\nAllowed letters: F, G, I, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus O, S).\n\nWe need a 5-letter word ending in OS with O in 4 and I in 2 or 3.\n\nPossible patterns:\n- _ I _ O S\n- _ _ I O S\n\nLooking for common words:\n- ""F I L O S"" – FILOS (plural of filum) – valid\n- ""P I L O S"" – PILOS (rare)\n- ""V I L O S"" – VILOS (rare)\n- ""M I L O S"" – MILOS (proper noun)\n- ""G I L O S"" – GILOS (rare)\n- ""L I M O S"" – LIMOS (rare)\n- ""P I G O S"" – PIGOS (rare)\n- ""F I G O S"" – FIGOS (rare)\n\nThe most common valid word fitting is FILOS.\n\nLet\'s verify:\n- F, I, L, O, S\n- No eliminated letters\n- O in 4, S in 5\n- I in 2\n\n<guess>FILOS</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)\nGuess 3: SHOCK -> FEEDBACK: S(-) H(x) O(-) C(x) K(x)\nGuess 4: OBITS -> FEEDBACK: O(-) B(x) I(-) T(x) S(✓)\nGuess 5: FILOS -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(✓) L(-) O(✓) S(✓)\n'}]","<think>
From the latest feedback (FILOS):

- F is NOT in the word (x)
- I is in the word and in the correct position 2 (✓)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O is in the word and in the correct position 4 (✓)
- S is in the word and in the correct position 5 (✓)

So the word must be: _ I _ O S, with:
- I fixed in position 2
- O fixed in position 4
- S fixed in position 5
- L must appear somewhere (positions 1 or 3, since 2,4,5 are taken)
- Cannot use any previously eliminated letters: A, R, E, U, N, D, H, C, K, B, T, F

Allowed letters: G, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus I, O, S)

We need a 5-letter word matching: ? I ? O S, with L in either 1 or 3.

Possible patterns:
- L I _ O S
- _ I L O S

Looking for common words:
- L I M O S - LIMOS (valid, plural of limo)
- L I G O S - LIGOS (rare)
- L I P O S - LIPOS (rare)
- _ I L O S - no common words fit this

The most common valid word is LIMOS.

Check constraints:
- L in 1 (allowed)
- I in 2 (✓)
- M in 3 (allowed)
- O in 4 (✓)
- S in 5 (✓)
- No eliminated letters used
