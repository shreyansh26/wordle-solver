For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English words

This gives us good coverage to potentially identify multiple correct letters and their positions, or at least determine which letters are in the word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct position (first letter).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word starts with A.
2. The remaining letters (R, O, S, E) are excluded from the entire word.
3. We still need to find the letters in positions 2-5.

Common 5-letter words starting with A that avoid R, O, S, E include:
- ABIDE (uses B, I, D, E – but E is excluded)
- ABACK (uses B, C, K – but O is excluded, so this is fine)
- AHEAD (uses H, D – but E is excluded)
- AGAVE (uses G, V – but E is not in this word, so this is fine)
- ALIKE (uses L, I, K, E – E excluded)
- ANGST (uses N, G, T – but S is excluded, so this is fine)

""ABACK"" seems good because:
- Starts with A (confirmed correct).
- Uses B, C, K which are common letters not yet tested.
- Avoids all excluded letters (R, O, S, E).

However, ""ABACK"" has two A's, which might not be efficient. A better choice might be ""AGAVE"" – but E is excluded. ""ALIKE"" has E excluded. 

""AHEAD"" uses H, D – but E is excluded. ""ANGST"" uses N, G, T – but S is excluded. 

""ABIDE"" has E excluded. ""ACRID"" has R excluded. 

""AFLAK"" is not a valid word. ""ABASE"" has E excluded. 

""ABACK"" seems the best among options, but let's try ""ALIKE"" – but E is excluded. 

Wait, ""ALIKE"" has E which is excluded. 

""AGLOW"" – uses G, L, O, W – but O is excluded. 

""AMBLE"" – E excluded. 

""AMUCK"" – uses M, U, C, K – none of R, O, S, E. This seems good. 

""AMUCK"" is a valid word meaning to attack suddenly. It uses M, U, C, K – all new letters not yet tested. 

So, ""AMUCK"" is a strong second guess.

- Uses B, C, K which are common letters not yet tested.
- Avoids all excluded letters (R, O, S, E).

However, ""ABACK"" has two A's, which might not be efficient. A better choice might be ""AGAVE"" – but E is excluded. ""ALIKE"" has E excluded. 

""AHEAD"" uses H, D – but E is excluded. ""ANGST"" uses N, G, T – but S is excluded. 

""ABIDE"" has E excluded. ""ACRID"" has R excluded. 

""AFLAK"" is not a valid word. ""ABASE"" has E excluded. 

""ABACK"" seems the best among options, but let's try ""ALIKE"" – but E is excluded. 

Wait, ""ALIKE"" has E which is excluded. 

""AGLOW"" – uses G, L, O, W – but O is excluded. 

""AMBLE"" – E excluded. 

""AMUCK"" – uses M, U, C, K – none of R, O, S, E. This seems good. 

""AMUCK"" is a valid word meaning to attack suddenly. It uses M, U, C, K – all new letters not yet tested. 

So, ""AMUCK"" is a strong second guess.

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   - A is fixed in the first position.  
   - The letters R, O, S, E are completely absent.

2. AMUCK → A(✓) M(x) U(x) C(x) K(x)  
   - Confirms A again in the first position.  
   - Adds M, U, C, K to the list of letters we know are NOT in the word.

So far we have eliminated: R, O, S, E, M, U, C, K.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with A.
- Does NOT contain any of R, O, S, E, M, U, C, K.

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, L, N, P, T, V, W, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: I, Y (since A is already used and E, O, U are out).

Possible patterns: A _ _ _ _

Let’s look for a word that uses fresh letters.  
- A + B, I, D, G, L, N, P, T, V, W, Y, Z.

Some candidates:
- ABDIG (invalid, not a word)
- ABYSS (S is out)
- AVIDD (invalid)
- ABBOT (O is out)
- AGING (G, I, N, G – but N is okay, but double G and I is okay, but let’s check letters: A, G, I, N, G – none are in the banned list. However, “AGING” is a valid word.)
- ANGEL (E is out)
- AWFUL (U is out)
- ABBOT (O is out)
- AFTLY (L, Y are okay – “AFTLY” is archaic but valid)
- ABBOT (O is out)
- ABBOT (O is out)
- ABBOT (O is out)

Let’s try “AGING”:
- A(✓) G I N G – none of the banned letters (R,O,S,E,M,U,C,K) appear.  
- It’s a valid word.

Another candidate: “ABIDE” – but E is banned.  
“ABACK” – C and K are banned.  
“ABASE” – S and E are banned.  
“ABAND” – N, D are okay, but “ABAND” is not a standard word.  
“ABASE” – banned letters.  

“AGING” seems the best available.

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   - A is fixed in position 1.  
   - Letters R, O, S, E are absent.

2. AMUCK → A(✓) M(x) U(x) C(x) K(x)  
   - A is still fixed in position 1.  
   - Additional absent letters: M, U, C, K.

3. AGING → A(✓) G(-) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓)  
   - A is still fixed in position 1.  
   - G is in the word but not in position 2.  
   - I is fixed in position 3.  
   - N is fixed in position 4.  
   - Second G is fixed in position 5.

So the word structure is: A _ I N G, but G cannot be in position 2. However, we know G must be in the word (from G(-)), and the only positions left are 2, 3, 4, 5. But positions 3,4,5 are already determined as I, N, G. Therefore, G must be in position 2. But the feedback said G(-) meaning G is in the word but not in position 2. This seems like a contradiction unless I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, let me re-express the feedback for AGING:

A(✓) – position 1 is A.  
G(-) – G is in the word but not in position 2.  
I(✓) – position 3 is I.  
N(✓) – position 4 is N.  
G(✓) – position 5 is G.

So the word must be A _ I N G, with G in position 5. The letter in position 2 must be such that it's not G (since G(-) in position 2). But we know G is in position 5, so position 2 can be any letter except the banned ones (R,O,S,E,M,U,C,K) and except A,I,N,G.

Banned letters so far: R,O,S,E,M,U,C,K.  
Available letters for position 2: B,D,F,H,J,L,P,T,V,W,Y,Z.

The word must be A _ I N G. Looking for valid 5-letter words fitting this pattern:  
- A B I N G – ""ABING"" is not a standard word.  
- A D I N G – ""ADING"" is not a word.  
- A F I N G – ""AFING"" is not a word.  
- A H I N G – ""AHING"" is not a word.  
- A L I N G – ""ALING"" is not standard.  
- A P I N G – ""APING"" is not standard.  
- A T I N G – ""ATING"" is not standard.  
- A V I N G – ""AVING"" is not standard.  
- A W I N G – ""AWING"" is archaic but valid.  
- A Y I N G – not a word.  
- A Z I N G – not a word.

Wait, the only standard word fitting A _ I N G is ""AGING"", but we already tried that and it gave G(-) for position 2. This suggests ""AGING"" is the word, but the feedback contradicts because G would be in position 5 (✓) and position 2 would have to be G, but G(-) says G is not in position 2. This seems impossible unless there's an error in interpretation.

Re-examining the feedback:  
AGING feedback: A(✓) G(-) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓)  
This means:  
- Position 1: A (✓)  
- Position 2: G is in the word but not here (-)  
- Position 3: I (✓)  
- Position 4: N (✓)  
- Position 5: G (✓)  

Therefore, the word must be A _ I N G with G in position 5 and not in position 2. The only letter left is position 2, which must be a letter not yet used and not banned. The word must be A [letter] I N G. The only valid English word fitting this is ""AWING"" (though archaic), but let's check if there's a more common word.

Actually, the correct word here is ""AWING"" (as in ""to wing it""), but this is very rare. The more common word is ""AGING"", but we've already seen that gives a contradiction. This suggests the word is ""AWING"".

However, let me check if there's another possibility. The letters used so far: A, I, N, G. Banned: R,O,S,E,M,U,C,K. The remaining letters for position 2 are B,D,F,H,J,L,P,T,V,W,Y,Z. None form a valid word A _ I N G except ""AWING"".

Thus, the next guess should be ""AWING"".

Given the constraints:
- Word starts with A, has I in position 3, N in position 4, and G in position 5.
- G is not in position 2.
- Letters not in the word: R, O, S, E, M, U, C, K.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English words

This gives us good coverage to potentially identify multiple correct letters and their positions, or at least determine which letters are in the word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct position (first letter).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word starts with A.
2. The remaining letters (R, O, S, E) are excluded from the entire word.
3. We still need to find the letters in positions 2-5.

Common 5-letter words starting with A that avoid R, O, S, E include:
- ABIDE (uses B, I, D, E – but E is excluded)
- ABACK (uses B, C, K – but O is excluded, so this is fine)
- AHEAD (uses H, D – but E is excluded)
- AGAVE (uses G, V – but E is not in this word, so this is fine)
- ALIKE (uses L, I, K, E – E excluded)
- ANGST (uses N, G, T – but S is excluded, so this is fine)

""ABACK"" seems good because:
- Starts with A (confirmed correct).
- Uses B, C, K which are common letters not yet tested.
- Avoids all excluded letters (R, O, S, E).

However, ""ABACK"" has two A's, which might not be efficient. A better choice might be ""AGAVE"" – but E is excluded. ""ALIKE"" has E excluded. 

""AHEAD"" uses H, D – but E is excluded. ""ANGST"" uses N, G, T – but S is excluded. 

""ABIDE"" has E excluded. ""ACRID"" has R excluded. 

""AFLAK"" is not a valid word. ""ABASE"" has E excluded. 

""ABACK"" seems the best among options, but let's try ""ALIKE"" – but E is excluded. 

Wait, ""ALIKE"" has E which is excluded. 

""AGLOW"" – uses G, L, O, W – but O is excluded. 

""AMBLE"" – E excluded. 

""AMUCK"" – uses M, U, C, K – none of R, O, S, E. This seems good. 

""AMUCK"" is a valid word meaning to attack suddenly. It uses M, U, C, K – all new letters not yet tested. 

So, ""AMUCK"" is a strong second guess.

   - Adds M, U, C, K to the list of letters we know are NOT in the word.

So far we have eliminated: R, O, S, E, M, U, C, K.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with A.
- Does NOT contain any of R, O, S, E, M, U, C, K.

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, L, N, P, T, V, W, Y, Z

- A + B, I, D, G, L, N, P, T, V, W, Y, Z.

Some candidates:
- ABDIG (invalid, not a word)
- ABYSS (S is out)
- AVIDD (invalid)
- ABBOT (O is out)
- AGING (G, I, N, G – but N is okay, but double G and I is okay, but let’s check letters: A, G, I, N, G – none are in the banned list. However, “AGING” is a valid word.)
- ANGEL (E is out)
- AWFUL (U is out)
- ABBOT (O is out)
- AFTLY (L, Y are okay – “AFTLY” is archaic but valid)
- ABBOT (O is out)
- ABBOT (O is out)
- ABBOT (O is out)

Let’s try “AGING”:
- A(✓) G I N G – none of the banned letters (R,O,S,E,M,U,C,K) appear.  
- It’s a valid word.

Another candidate: “ABIDE” – but E is banned.  
“ABACK” – C and K are banned.  
“ABASE” – S and E are banned.  
“ABAND” – N, D are okay, but “ABAND” is not a standard word.  
“ABASE” – banned letters.

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   - A is fixed in position 1.  
   - Letters R, O, S, E are absent.

2. AMUCK → A(✓) M(x) U(x) C(x) K(x)  
   - A is still fixed in position 1.  
   - Additional absent letters: M, U, C, K.

3. AGING → A(✓) G(-) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓)  
   - A is still fixed in position 1.  
   - G is in the word but not in position 2.  
   - I is fixed in position 3.  
   - N is fixed in position 4.  
   - Second G is fixed in position 5.

So the word structure is: A _ I N G, but G cannot be in position 2. However, we know G must be in the word (from G(-)), and the only positions left are 2, 3, 4, 5. But positions 3,4,5 are already determined as I, N, G. Therefore, G must be in position 2. But the feedback said G(-) meaning G is in the word but not in position 2. This seems like a contradiction unless I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, let me re-express the feedback for AGING:

A(✓) – position 1 is A.  
G(-) – G is in the word but not in position 2.  
I(✓) – position 3 is I.  
N(✓) – position 4 is N.  
G(✓) – position 5 is G.

So the word must be A _ I N G, with G in position 5. The letter in position 2 must be such that it's not G (since G(-) in position 2). But we know G is in position 5, so position 2 can be any letter except the banned ones (R,O,S,E,M,U,C,K) and except A,I,N,G.

Banned letters so far: R,O,S,E,M,U,C,K.  
Available letters for position 2: B,D,F,H,J,L,P,T,V,W,Y,Z.

The word must be A _ I N G. Looking for valid 5-letter words fitting this pattern:  
- A B I N G – ""ABING"" is not a standard word.  
- A D I N G – ""ADING"" is not a word.  
- A F I N G – ""AFING"" is not a word.  
- A H I N G – ""AHING"" is not a word.  
- A L I N G – ""ALING"" is not standard.  
- A P I N G – ""APING"" is not standard.  
- A T I N G – ""ATING"" is not standard.  
- A V I N G – ""AVING"" is not standard.  
- A W I N G – ""AWING"" is archaic but valid.  
- A Y I N G – not a word.  
- A Z I N G – not a word.

Wait, the only standard word fitting A _ I N G is ""AGING"", but we already tried that and it gave G(-) for position 2. This suggests ""AGING"" is the word, but the feedback contradicts because G would be in position 5 (✓) and position 2 would have to be G, but G(-) says G is not in position 2. This seems impossible unless there's an error in interpretation.

Re-examining the feedback:  
AGING feedback: A(✓) G(-) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓)  
This means:  
- Position 1: A (✓)  
- Position 2: G is in the word but not here (-)  
- Position 3: I (✓)  
- Position 4: N (✓)  
- Position 5: G (✓)  

Therefore, the word must be A _ I N G with G in position 5 and not in position 2. The only letter left is position 2, which must be a letter not yet used and not banned. The word must be A [letter] I N G. The only valid English word fitting this is ""AWING"" (though archaic), but let's check if there's a more common word.

Actually, the correct word here is ""AWING"" (as in ""to wing it""), but this is very rare. The more common word is ""AGING"", but we've already seen that gives a contradiction. This suggests the word is ""AWING"".

However, let me check if there's another possibility. The letters used so far: A, I, N, G. Banned: R,O,S,E,M,U,C,K. The remaining letters for position 2 are B,D,F,H,J,L,P,T,V,W,Y,Z. None form a valid word A _ I N G except ""AWING"".

Thus, the next guess should be ""AWING"".Given the constraints:
- Word starts with A, has I in position 3, N in position 4, and G in position 5.
- G is not in position 2.
- Letters not in the word: R, O, S, E, M, U, C, K.

The only valid word fitting A _ I N G is ""AWING"".

The only valid English word that fits A _ I N G is “ABING”, but that’s not a recognized word.  
Looking again, the correct and only recognized word fitting A _ I N G is “AGING”, but we’ve already played it and it gave G(-) for position 2. This implies the word must be “AGING”, even though the feedback seems contradictory. However, upon closer inspection, the feedback for AGING indicates G is in position 5 (✓) and not in position 2 (-), which aligns with “AGING” because the first G is in position 1 (but we know position 1 is A), so this is impossible.

Realizing the only possible word left is “ABING” (non-standard) or rechecking valid words, the correct standard word is actually “AGING”, but the feedback suggests a different structure. This indicates the word must be “AGING” despite the apparent contradiction, suggesting an error in earlier interpretation. However, re-examining, the word must be “AWING” but W was ruled out. 

Rechecking valid English words: the only 5-letter word starting with A, having I in position 3, N in 4, and G in 5, with no banned letters in position 2, is “ABING” (non-word). This implies the word is “AGING”, but the feedback must be interpreted differently. 

Upon careful re-interpretation, the word must be “AGING” with the structure A G I N G, but the feedback for AGING shows G(-) in position 2, meaning G is not in position 2, which aligns with G being in position 5. Thus, the word is “AGING”.

But since AWING was played and W was ruled out, and all other possibilities are non-words, the only remaining valid word is “AGING”, so this must be the answer.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English words

This gives us good coverage to potentially identify multiple correct letters and their positions, or at least determine which letters are in the word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct position (first letter).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word starts with A.
2. The remaining letters (R, O, S, E) are excluded from the entire word.
3. We still need to find the letters in positions 2-5.

Common 5-letter words starting with A that avoid R, O, S, E include:
- ABIDE (uses B, I, D, E – but E is excluded)
- ABACK (uses B, C, K – but O is excluded, so this is fine)
- AHEAD (uses H, D – but E is excluded)
- AGAVE (uses G, V – but E is not in this word, so this is fine)
- ALIKE (uses L, I, K, E – E excluded)
- ANGST (uses N, G, T – but S is excluded, so this is fine)

""ABACK"" seems good because:
- Starts with A (confirmed correct).
- Uses B, C, K which are common letters not yet tested.
- Avoids all excluded letters (R, O, S, E).

However, ""ABACK"" has two A's, which might not be efficient. A better choice might be ""AGAVE"" – but E is excluded. ""ALIKE"" has E excluded. 

""AHEAD"" uses H, D – but E is excluded. ""ANGST"" uses N, G, T – but S is excluded. 

""ABIDE"" has E excluded. ""ACRID"" has R excluded. 

""AFLAK"" is not a valid word. ""ABASE"" has E excluded. 

""ABACK"" seems the best among options, but let's try ""ALIKE"" – but E is excluded. 

Wait, ""ALIKE"" has E which is excluded. 

""AGLOW"" – uses G, L, O, W – but O is excluded. 

""AMBLE"" – E excluded. 

""AMUCK"" – uses M, U, C, K – none of R, O, S, E. This seems good. 

""AMUCK"" is a valid word meaning to attack suddenly. It uses M, U, C, K – all new letters not yet tested. 

So, ""AMUCK"" is a strong second guess.

   - A is fixed in the first position.  
   - The letters R, O, S, E are completely absent.

2. AMUCK → A(✓) M(x) U(x) C(x) K(x)  
   - Confirms A again in the first position.  
   - Adds M, U, C, K to the list of letters we know are NOT in the word.

So far we have eliminated: R, O, S, E, M, U, C, K.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with A.
- Does NOT contain any of R, O, S, E, M, U, C, K.

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, L, N, P, T, V, W, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: I, Y (since A is already used and E, O, U are out).

Possible patterns: A _ _ _ _

Let’s look for a word that uses fresh letters.  
- A + B, I, D, G, L, N, P, T, V, W, Y, Z.

Some candidates:
- ABDIG (invalid, not a word)
- ABYSS (S is out)
- AVIDD (invalid)
- ABBOT (O is out)
- AGING (G, I, N, G – but N is okay, but double G and I is okay, but let’s check letters: A, G, I, N, G – none are in the banned list. However, “AGING” is a valid word.)
- ANGEL (E is out)
- AWFUL (U is out)
- ABBOT (O is out)
- AFTLY (L, Y are okay – “AFTLY” is archaic but valid)
- ABBOT (O is out)
- ABBOT (O is out)
- ABBOT (O is out)

Let’s try “AGING”:
- A(✓) G I N G – none of the banned letters (R,O,S,E,M,U,C,K) appear.  
- It’s a valid word.

Another candidate: “ABIDE” – but E is banned.  
“ABACK” – C and K are banned.  
“ABASE” – S and E are banned.  
“ABAND” – N, D are okay, but “ABAND” is not a standard word.  
“ABASE” – banned letters.  

“AGING” seems the best available.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 3: AGING -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) G(-) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓)
<|im_end|>

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   - A is fixed in position 1.  
   - Letters R, O, S, E are absent.

2. AMUCK → A(✓) M(x) U(x) C(x) K(x)  
   - A is still fixed in position 1.  
   - Additional absent letters: M, U, C, K.

3. AGING → A(✓) G(-) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓)  
   - A is still fixed in position 1.  
   - G is in the word but not in position 2.  
   - I is fixed in position 3.  
   - N is fixed in position 4.  
   - Second G is fixed in position 5.

So the word structure is: A _ I N G, but G cannot be in position 2. However, we know G must be in the word (from G(-)), and the only positions left are 2, 3, 4, 5. But positions 3,4,5 are already determined as I, N, G. Therefore, G must be in position 2. But the feedback said G(-) meaning G is in the word but not in position 2. This seems like a contradiction unless I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, let me re-express the feedback for AGING:

A(✓) – position 1 is A.  
G(-) – G is in the word but not in position 2.  
I(✓) – position 3 is I.  
N(✓) – position 4 is N.  
G(✓) – position 5 is G.

So the word must be A _ I N G, with G in position 5. The letter in position 2 must be such that it's not G (since G(-) in position 2). But we know G is in position 5, so position 2 can be any letter except the banned ones (R,O,S,E,M,U,C,K) and except A,I,N,G.

Banned letters so far: R,O,S,E,M,U,C,K.  
Available letters for position 2: B,D,F,H,J,L,P,T,V,W,Y,Z.

The word must be A _ I N G. Looking for valid 5-letter words fitting this pattern:  
- A B I N G – ""ABING"" is not a standard word.  
- A D I N G – ""ADING"" is not a word.  
- A F I N G – ""AFING"" is not a word.  
- A H I N G – ""AHING"" is not a word.  
- A L I N G – ""ALING"" is not standard.  
- A P I N G – ""APING"" is not standard.  
- A T I N G – ""ATING"" is not standard.  
- A V I N G – ""AVING"" is not standard.  
- A W I N G – ""AWING"" is archaic but valid.  
- A Y I N G – not a word.  
- A Z I N G – not a word.

Wait, the only standard word fitting A _ I N G is ""AGING"", but we already tried that and it gave G(-) for position 2. This suggests ""AGING"" is the word, but the feedback contradicts because G would be in position 5 (✓) and position 2 would have to be G, but G(-) says G is not in position 2. This seems impossible unless there's an error in interpretation.

Re-examining the feedback:  
AGING feedback: A(✓) G(-) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓)  
This means:  
- Position 1: A (✓)  
- Position 2: G is in the word but not here (-)  
- Position 3: I (✓)  
- Position 4: N (✓)  
- Position 5: G (✓)  

Therefore, the word must be A _ I N G with G in position 5 and not in position 2. The only letter left is position 2, which must be a letter not yet used and not banned. The word must be A [letter] I N G. The only valid English word fitting this is ""AWING"" (though archaic), but let's check if there's a more common word.

Actually, the correct word here is ""AWING"" (as in ""to wing it""), but this is very rare. The more common word is ""AGING"", but we've already seen that gives a contradiction. This suggests the word is ""AWING"".

However, let me check if there's another possibility. The letters used so far: A, I, N, G. Banned: R,O,S,E,M,U,C,K. The remaining letters for position 2 are B,D,F,H,J,L,P,T,V,W,Y,Z. None form a valid word A _ I N G except ""AWING"".

Thus, the next guess should be ""AWING"".Given the constraints:
- Word starts with A, has I in position 3, N in position 4, and G in position 5.
- G is not in position 2.
- Letters not in the word: R, O, S, E, M, U, C, K.

The only valid word fitting A _ I N G is ""AWING"".

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   - A is fixed in position 1.  
   - Letters R, O, S, E are absent.

2. AMUCK → A(✓) M(x) U(x) C(x) K(x)  
   - Additional absent letters: M, U, C, K.

3. AGING → A(✓) G(-) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓)  
   - G is in the word but not in position 2.  
   - I is fixed in position 3.  
   - N is fixed in position 4.  
   - G is fixed in position 5.

4. AWING → A(✓) W(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓)  
   - W is not in the word.

So the word structure is: A _ I N G, with G in position 5 and not in position 2.  
Letters already fixed: A (pos 1), I (pos 3), N (pos 4), G (pos 5).  
Letters already ruled out: R, O, S, E, M, U, C, K, W.

The only remaining letter for position 2 that hasn’t been used or ruled out is “B”.  
The only valid English word that fits A _ I N G is “ABING”, but that’s not a recognized word.  
Looking again, the correct and only recognized word fitting A _ I N G is “AGING”, but we’ve already played it and it gave G(-) for position 2. This implies the word must be “AGING”, even though the feedback seems contradictory. However, upon closer inspection, the feedback for AGING indicates G is in position 5 (✓) and not in position 2 (-), which aligns with “AGING” because the first G is in position 1 (but we know position 1 is A), so this is impossible.

Realizing the only possible word left is “ABING” (non-standard) or rechecking valid words, the correct standard word is actually “AGING”, but the feedback suggests a different structure. This indicates the word must be “AGING” despite the apparent contradiction, suggesting an error in earlier interpretation. However, re-examining, the word must be “AWING” but W was ruled out. 

Rechecking valid English words: the only 5-letter word starting with A, having I in position 3, N in 4, and G in 5, with no banned letters in position 2, is “ABING” (non-word). This implies the word is “AGING”, but the feedback must be interpreted differently. 

Upon careful re-interpretation, the word must be “AGING” with the structure A G I N G, but the feedback for AGING shows G(-) in position 2, meaning G is not in position 2, which aligns with G being in position 5. Thus, the word is “AGING”.

But since AWING was played and W was ruled out, and all other possibilities are non-words, the only remaining valid word is “AGING”, so this must be the answer.

From all feedback:

- Position 1: A (fixed)
- Position 3: I (fixed)
- Position 4: N (fixed)
- Position 5: G (fixed)
- Position 2: Must be a letter that is NOT G (because G(-) in positions 2 and 5), and NOT any of R,O,S,E,M,U,C,K,W.

Letters already ruled out: R, O, S, E, M, U, C, K, W, and G cannot be in position 2.

The only remaining unused letters that can fit position 2 are: B, D, F, H, J, L, P, T, V, Y, Z.

The only valid English word of the form A _ I N G is “ABING” (not valid) or “AGING” (but G would be in position 5 and 2, which contradicts the feedback). 

However, the correct interpretation is that the word must be A _ I N G with G in position 5, and the letter in position 2 must be one of the remaining unused letters. The only valid word fitting this is “ABING”, but since it’s not recognized, the only possible word left is “AGING”, which suggests the feedback must have been misinterpreted.

Re-examining: The word structure is A _ I N G with G in position 5. The only valid word is “AGING”, but that would place G in position 2 and 5, which contradicts the feedback. This indicates the word must be “ABING”, but it’s invalid.

Realizing the oversight: The correct word is “AGING”, and the feedback for AGING (A(✓) G(-) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓)) means:
- Position 1: A (✓)
- Position 2: G is in the word but not here (-) → G must be elsewhere
- Position 3: I (✓)
- Position 4: N (✓)
- Position 5: G (✓)

Thus, the word is A _ I N G with G in position 5 and not in position 2, confirming the only possible word is “AGING”.

Since we’ve exhausted possibilities, the word must be “AGING”.

<guess>AGING</guess>",AGING,"From all feedback:

- Position 1: A (fixed)
- Position 3: I (fixed)
- Position 4: N (fixed)
- Position 5: G (fixed)
- Position 2: Must be a letter that is NOT G (because G(-) in positions 2 and 5), and NOT any of R,O,S,E,M,U,C,K,W.

Letters already ruled out: R, O, S, E, M, U, C, K, W, and G cannot be in position 2.

The only remaining unused letters that can fit position 2 are: B, D, F, H, J, L, P, T, V, Y, Z.
