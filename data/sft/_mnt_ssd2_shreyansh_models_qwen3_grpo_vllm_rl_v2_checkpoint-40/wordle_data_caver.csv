For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A strong opening word would use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. Some good candidates are:
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)

I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters and gives us good coverage of vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(x): O is NOT in the word
- S(x): S is NOT in the word
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, E (but not in positions 1, 2, 5 respectively)
- Does NOT contain O or S

Letters we know are in the word: A, R, E  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: O, S

We need a 5-letter word that uses A, R, E in different positions than before, and avoids O and S.

Possible positions for A: 2,3,4,5  
Possible positions for R: 1,3,4,5  
Possible positions for E: 1,2,3,4  

Let’s try to place A, R, E in new spots and fill the remaining two slots with other common letters that haven’t been ruled out (e.g., T, L, N, I, C, etc.).

A good candidate is ""RAISE"":
- R in position 1 (was in position 2 before)
- A in position 2 (was in position 1 before)
- I (new letter)
- S (but S was already ruled out in position 4 of AROSE, so S is invalid)
Oops, ""RAISE"" contains S which we know is not in the word.

Next candidate: ""TREAD"":
- T (new letter)
- R in position 2 (was in position 2 before - not allowed, must move)

Let’s try to place A, R, E in new spots and fill the remaining two slots with other common letters that haven’t been ruled out (e.g., T, L, N, I, C, etc.).

A good candidate is ""RAISE"":
- R in position 1 (was in position 2 before)
- A in position 2 (was in position 1 before)
- I (new letter)
- S (but S was already ruled out in position 4 of AROSE, so S is invalid)
Oops, ""RAISE"" contains S which we know is not in the word.

Next candidate: ""TREAD"":
- T (new letter)
- R in position 2 (was in position 2 before - not allowed, must move)
""CREAM"":
- C (new letter)
- R in position 2 (same issue)

""EARLY"":
- E in position 1 (was in position 5 before)
- A in position 2 (was in position 1 before)
- R in position 3 (was in position 2 before)
- L (new letter)
- Y (new letter)
This seems valid: A, R, E are all in new positions, and no O or S.

So ""EARLY"" is a good next guess.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word (and their current status):
- A: in the word, and in the correct position (position 2 in EARLY → so A is in position 2 in the secret word).
- E: in the word but not in positions 1 or 5.
- R: in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- O, S (from AROSE)
- L, Y (from EARLY)

So the secret word looks like: _ A _ _ _
and must contain E and R somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5 (since E can’t be 1 or 5, and R can’t be 2 or 3).

Remaining unused common letters (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- has A in position 2
- contains E and R in positions 3, 4, or 5
- avoids O, S, L, Y

Possible candidates:
- BREAD: A(2) is correct, but D and B are new. R is in position 3 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed). No banned letters.
- CRANE: A(2) correct, R in 3 (allowed), E in 5 (but E can’t be 5 → invalid).

Now we have:

- A is locked in position 2: _ A _ _ _
- E is in the word and is now known to be in position 4: _ A _ E _
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from EARLY and BARED feedback: R was in 3 and got ""-"", so 3 is excluded; also from AROSE, R was in 2 and got ""-"", so 2 is excluded; and from BARED, R was in 3 again and got ""-"", so 5 is excluded as well). Therefore R must be in position 1 or 3, but 3 is excluded, so R must be in position 1.

So the word must be: R A _ E _

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out): C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with RA and has E in position 4. The missing letter (position 3) must be one of the allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- R A C E ?
- R A F E ?
- R A G E ?
- R A H E ?
- R A I E ?
- R A K E ?
- R A M E ?
- R A N E ?
- R A P E ?
- R A T E ?
- R A V E ?
- R A W E ?
- R A Z E ?

Looking for valid English words:
- R A C E ? → RACE? (no common word)
- R A F E ? → RAF? (no)
- R A G E ? → RAGE? (no)
- R A H E ? → RAHE? (no)

- R A T E ? → RATE (valid word)
- R A V E ? → RAVE (valid word)
- R A W E ? → RAW? (no)
- R A Z E ? → RAZE (valid word)

Valid options: RAKE, RAPE, RATE, RAVE, RAZE.

Among these, the most common and likely is ""RAVE"" or ""RATE"". Since we have no info on T or V yet, and these are both strong, but ""RAVE"" is a bit more common as a guess.

But let's check if any of these have disallowed letters. All letters used (R,A,V,E) are allowed so far.

So ""RAVE"" is a good next guess. However, we need a 5-letter word, and ""RAVE"" is only 4 letters. Wait, that's a mistake!

Actually, the structure is R A _ E _, so we need a 5-letter word starting with RA, with E in position 4. The valid words are:
- R A K E ? → RAKE (but RAKE is 4 letters, not 5)
Wait, no: RAKE is 4 letters, but we need 5 letters. So we need a 5-letter word matching R A _ E _.

Looking again:
- R A C E ? → RACE? (no)
- R A F E ? → RAF? (no)
- R A G E ? → RAGE? (no)
- R A H E ? → RAHE? (no)
- R A I E ? → RAIE? (no)

- R A M E ? → RAME? (no)
- R A N E ? → RANE? (no)
- R A P E ? → RAPE (4 letters)
- R A T E ? → RATE (4 letters)
- R A V E ? → RAVE (4 letters)
- R A W E ? → RAW? (no)
- R A Z E ? → RAZE (4 letters)

Hmm, all these are 4-letter words. That suggests I might have made an error in deducing the positions. Let me re-examine the feedback:

From BARED: B(x) A(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(x)

This means:
- A is in position 2 (correct)
- E is in the word and is in position 4 (correct)
- R is in the word but not in position 3 (correct)
- B and D are not in the word (correct)

So the word structure is: _ A _ E _

And R must be in position 1 or 5 (since it can't be 2,3,4).

But from AROSE: R was in position 2 and got ""-"", so R can't be in 2
From EARLY: R was in position 3 and got ""-"", so R can't be in 3
From BARED: R was in position 3 and got ""-"", so R can't be in 3
Also, E is in position 4, so R can't be in 4

Thus R must be in position 1 or 5.

So possible structures:
- R A _ E _
- _ A _ E R

Now looking for 5-letter words:

For R A _ E _:
- R A C E ? → RACE? (no)
- R A F E ? → RAF? (no)
- R A G E ? → RAGE? (no)
- R A H E ? → RAHE? (no)

- R A N E ? → RANE? (no)
- R A P E ? → RAPE (4 letters)
- R A T E ? → RATE (4 letters)
- R A V E ? → RAVE (4 letters)
- R A W E ? → RAW? (no)
- R A Z E ? → RAZE (4 letters)

None of these are 5-letter words starting with RA and having E in position 4.

For _ A _ E R:
- C A R E R → CARER (no)
- F A T E R → FATER (no)
- G A M E R → GAMER (valid word)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A strong opening word would use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. Some good candidates are:
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)

I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters and gives us good coverage of vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(x): O is NOT in the word
- S(x): S is NOT in the word
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, E (but not in positions 1, 2, 5 respectively)
- Does NOT contain O or S

Letters we know are in the word: A, R, E  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: O, S

We need a 5-letter word that uses A, R, E in different positions than before, and avoids O and S.

Possible positions for A: 2,3,4,5  
Possible positions for R: 1,3,4,5  
Possible positions for E: 1,2,3,4  

Let’s try to place A, R, E in new spots and fill the remaining two slots with other common letters that haven’t been ruled out (e.g., T, L, N, I, C, etc.).

A good candidate is ""RAISE"":
- R in position 1 (was in position 2 before)
- A in position 2 (was in position 1 before)
- I (new letter)
- S (but S was already ruled out in position 4 of AROSE, so S is invalid)
Oops, ""RAISE"" contains S which we know is not in the word.

Next candidate: ""TREAD"":
- T (new letter)
- R in position 2 (was in position 2 before - not allowed, must move)
""CREAM"":
- C (new letter)
- R in position 2 (same issue)

""EARLY"":
- E in position 1 (was in position 5 before)
- A in position 2 (was in position 1 before)
- R in position 3 (was in position 2 before)
- L (new letter)
- Y (new letter)
This seems valid: A, R, E are all in new positions, and no O or S.

So ""EARLY"" is a good next guess.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

- R: in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- O, S (from AROSE)

So the secret word looks like: _ A _ _ _
and must contain E and R somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5 (since E can’t be 1 or 5, and R can’t be 2 or 3).

Remaining unused common letters (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- has A in position 2
- contains E and R in positions 3, 4, or 5
- avoids O, S, L, Y

Possible candidates:
- BREAD: A(2) is correct, but D and B are new. R is in position 3 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed). No banned letters.
- CRANE: A(2) correct, R in 3 (allowed), E in 5 (but E can’t be 5 → invalid).
- GRADE: A(2) correct, R in 3 (allowed), E in 5 (invalid).
- BARGE: A(2) correct, R in 3 (allowed), E in 5 (invalid).
- BRAVE: A(2) correct, R in 3 (allowed), E in 5 (invalid).
- CARED: A(2) correct, R in 3 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), D new. Valid.
- BARED: A(2) correct, R in 3 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), D new. Valid.

""BARED"" seems good: A(2) confirmed, B and D new, E in 4, R in 3.

Now we have:

- A is locked in position 2: _ A _ _ _
- E is in the word and is now known to be in position 4: _ A _ E _
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from EARLY and BARED feedback: R was in 3 and got ""-"", so 3 is excluded; also from AROSE, R was in 2 and got ""-"", so 2 is excluded; and from BARED, R was in 3 again and got ""-"", so 5 is excluded as well). Therefore R must be in position 1 or 3, but 3 is excluded, so R must be in position 1.

So the word must be: R A _ E _

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out): C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with RA and has E in position 4. The missing letter (position 3) must be one of the allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- R A C E ?
- R A F E ?
- R A G E ?
- R A H E ?
- R A I E ?
- R A K E ?
- R A M E ?
- R A N E ?
- R A P E ?
- R A T E ?
- R A V E ?
- R A W E ?
- R A Z E ?

Looking for valid English words:
- R A C E ? → RACE? (no common word)
- R A F E ? → RAF? (no)
- R A G E ? → RAGE? (no)
- R A H E ? → RAHE? (no)
- R A I E ? → RAIE? (no)
- R A K E ? → RAKE (valid word)
- R A M E ? → RAME? (no)
- R A N E ? → RANE? (no)
- R A P E ? → RAPE (valid word)
- R A T E ? → RATE (valid word)
- R A V E ? → RAVE (valid word)
- R A W E ? → RAW? (no)
- R A Z E ? → RAZE (valid word)

Valid options: RAKE, RAPE, RATE, RAVE, RAZE.

Among these, the most common and likely is ""RAVE"" or ""RATE"". Since we have no info on T or V yet, and these are both strong, but ""RAVE"" is a bit more common as a guess.

But let's check if any of these have disallowed letters. All letters used (R,A,V,E) are allowed so far.

So ""RAVE"" is a good next guess. However, we need a 5-letter word, and ""RAVE"" is only 4 letters. Wait, that's a mistake!

Actually, the structure is R A _ E _, so we need a 5-letter word starting with RA, with E in position 4. The valid words are:
- R A K E ? → RAKE (but RAKE is 4 letters, not 5)
Wait, no: RAKE is 4 letters, but we need 5 letters. So we need a 5-letter word matching R A _ E _.

Looking again:
- R A C E ? → RACE? (no)
- R A F E ? → RAF? (no)
- R A G E ? → RAGE? (no)
- R A H E ? → RAHE? (no)
- R A I E ? → RAIE? (no)
- R A K E ? → RAKE (4 letters)
- R A M E ? → RAME? (no)
- R A N E ? → RANE? (no)
- R A P E ? → RAPE (4 letters)
- R A T E ? → RATE (4 letters)
- R A V E ? → RAVE (4 letters)
- R A W E ? → RAW? (no)
- R A Z E ? → RAZE (4 letters)

Hmm, all these are 4-letter words. That suggests I might have made an error in deducing the positions. Let me re-examine the feedback:

From BARED: B(x) A(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(x)

This means:
- A is in position 2 (correct)
- E is in the word and is in position 4 (correct)
- R is in the word but not in position 3 (correct)
- B and D are not in the word (correct)

So the word structure is: _ A _ E _

And R must be in position 1 or 5 (since it can't be 2,3,4).

But from AROSE: R was in position 2 and got ""-"", so R can't be in 2
From EARLY: R was in position 3 and got ""-"", so R can't be in 3
From BARED: R was in position 3 and got ""-"", so R can't be in 3
Also, E is in position 4, so R can't be in 4

Thus R must be in position 1 or 5.

So possible structures:
- R A _ E _
- _ A _ E R

Now looking for 5-letter words:

For R A _ E _:
- R A C E ? → RACE? (no)
- R A F E ? → RAF? (no)
- R A G E ? → RAGE? (no)
- R A H E ? → RAHE? (no)
- R A I E ? → RAIE? (no)
- R A K E ? → RAKE (4 letters)
- R A M E ? → RAME? (no)
- R A N E ? → RANE? (no)
- R A P E ? → RAPE (4 letters)
- R A T E ? → RATE (4 letters)
- R A V E ? → RAVE (4 letters)
- R A W E ? → RAW? (no)
- R A Z E ? → RAZE (4 letters)

None of these are 5-letter words starting with RA and having E in position 4.

For _ A _ E R:
- C A R E R → CARER (no)
- F A T E R → FATER (no)
- G A M E R → GAMER (valid word)
- H A V E R → HAVER (valid word)
- I A M E R → IAMER (no)
- K A P E R → KAPER (valid word)
- M A N E R → MANER (no)
- N A V E R → NAVER (no)
- P A P E R → PAPER (valid word)
- T A P E R → TAPER (valid word)
- V A R E R → VARE? (no)
- W A V E R → WAYER (no)
- Z A P E R → ZAPER (no)

Valid 5-letter words: GAMER, HAVER, KAPER, PAPER, TAPER.

Among these, ""PAPER"" is the most common word and uses P (a new letter) and fits all constraints.

Thus, the next guess should be ""PAPER"".
