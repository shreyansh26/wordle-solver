### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)

   – S is present but not in position 4.

2. STUMP → S(-) T(x) U(-) M(x) P(x)  
   – T, M, P are ruled out.  
   – S is present but not in position 1.  
   – U is present but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: S, U  
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, M, P  
- Positions ruled out for S: 1, 4  
- Positions ruled out for U: 3  

Remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: I (since U is already confirmed, and A, E, O are out)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both S and U  
- S is in position 2, 3, or 5  
- U is in position 1, 2, 4, or 5  
- Uses only the allowed letters

A quick scan of common patterns:
- S and U together often form “US” or “SU”, but we can’t use position 3 for U.  
- Let’s try placing S in position 2 and U in position 1: US___  
  Remaining letters (allowed): I, N, D, L, etc.  
  “USIND” isn’t a word, but “USUAL” has an A (ruled out).  
- Try S in position 3 and U in position 1: U S ___  
  “USUAL” again has A.  
- Try S in position 5 and U in position 2: _ U _ _ S  
  Candidate: “BUILD” – but S is last, and we have D, L, I, etc.  
- Try S in position 2 and U in position 4: _ S _ U _  
  Candidate: “DISCU” – but C and D are allowed, but “DISCU” isn’t a common word.  
- Try S in position 3 and U in position 2: _ U S _ _  
  Candidate: “BUSKS” – but K is allowed, B is allowed, S is in 3, U is in 2.  
  However, “BUSKS” has K and S, but we need to check if all letters are allowed.  
  B, U, S, K, S – but we only need one S.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters, maximizing information gain

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
1. Does NOT contain A, R, O, E
2. DOES contain S, but not in position 4 (the last letter)
3. Must be a 5-letter word using the remaining 25 letters minus the 4 ruled out.

I need a new word that:
- Includes S (but not in position 4)
- Avoids A, R, O, E
- Uses common remaining letters to maximize information

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, W, Y
Good remaining vowels: I, U

A strong next guess would be ""STUMP"":
- S is in position 1 (not 4, so possible)
- Uses common letters T, U, M, P
- No A, R, O, E
- Covers new letters efficiently

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – A, R, O, E are ruled out.  
   – S is present but not in position 4.

2. STUMP → S(-) T(x) U(-) M(x) P(x)  
   – T, M, P are ruled out.  
   – S is present but not in position 1.  
   – U is present but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: S, U  
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, M, P  
- Positions ruled out for S: 1, 4  
- Positions ruled out for U: 3  

Remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: I (since U is already confirmed, and A, E, O are out)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both S and U  
- S is in position 2, 3, or 5  
- U is in position 1, 2, 4, or 5  
- Uses only the allowed letters

A quick scan of common patterns:
- S and U together often form “US” or “SU”, but we can’t use position 3 for U.  
- Let’s try placing S in position 2 and U in position 1: US___  
  Remaining letters (allowed): I, N, D, L, etc.  
  “USIND” isn’t a word, but “USUAL” has an A (ruled out).  
- Try S in position 3 and U in position 1: U S ___  
  “USUAL” again has A.  
- Try S in position 5 and U in position 2: _ U _ _ S  
  Candidate: “BUILD” – but S is last, and we have D, L, I, etc.  
- Try S in position 2 and U in position 4: _ S _ U _  
  Candidate: “DISCU” – but C and D are allowed, but “DISCU” isn’t a common word.  
- Try S in position 3 and U in position 2: _ U S _ _  
  Candidate: “BUSKS” – but K is allowed, B is allowed, S is in 3, U is in 2.  
  However, “BUSKS” has K and S, but we need to check if all letters are allowed.  
  B, U, S, K, S – but we only need one S.  

A better common word: “DUSKS”  
- D, U, S, K, S  
- Contains S and U  
- S is in position 3 (allowed)  
- U is in position 2 (allowed)  
- All letters are from the remaining allowed set.

So, “DUSKS” seems valid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters, maximizing information gain

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
1. Does NOT contain A, R, O, E
2. DOES contain S, but not in position 4 (the last letter)
3. Must be a 5-letter word using the remaining 25 letters minus the 4 ruled out.

I need a new word that:
- Includes S (but not in position 4)
- Avoids A, R, O, E
- Uses common remaining letters to maximize information

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, W, Y
Good remaining vowels: I, U

A strong next guess would be ""STUMP"":
- S is in position 1 (not 4, so possible)
- Uses common letters T, U, M, P
- No A, R, O, E
- Covers new letters efficiently

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STUMP -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) U(-) M(x) P(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – A, R, O, E are ruled out.  
   – S is present but not in position 4.

2. STUMP → S(-) T(x) U(-) M(x) P(x)  
   – T, M, P are ruled out.  
   – S is present but not in position 1.  
   – U is present but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: S, U  
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, M, P  
- Positions ruled out for S: 1, 4  
- Positions ruled out for U: 3  

Remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: I (since U is already confirmed, and A, E, O are out)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both S and U  
- S is in position 2, 3, or 5  
- U is in position 1, 2, 4, or 5  
- Uses only the allowed letters

A quick scan of common patterns:
- S and U together often form “US” or “SU”, but we can’t use position 3 for U.  
- Let’s try placing S in position 2 and U in position 1: US___  
  Remaining letters (allowed): I, N, D, L, etc.  
  “USIND” isn’t a word, but “USUAL” has an A (ruled out).  
- Try S in position 3 and U in position 1: U S ___  
  “USUAL” again has A.  
- Try S in position 5 and U in position 2: _ U _ _ S  
  Candidate: “BUILD” – but S is last, and we have D, L, I, etc.  
- Try S in position 2 and U in position 4: _ S _ U _  
  Candidate: “DISCU” – but C and D are allowed, but “DISCU” isn’t a common word.  
- Try S in position 3 and U in position 2: _ U S _ _  
  Candidate: “BUSKS” – but K is allowed, B is allowed, S is in 3, U is in 2.  
  However, “BUSKS” has K and S, but we need to check if all letters are allowed.  
  B, U, S, K, S – but we only need one S.  

A better common word: “DUSKS”  
- D, U, S, K, S  
- Contains S and U  
- S is in position 3 (allowed)  
- U is in position 2 (allowed)  
- All letters are from the remaining allowed set.

So, “DUSKS” seems valid.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STUMP -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) U(-) M(x) P(x)
Guess 3: DUSKS -> FEEDBACK: D(x) U(✓) S(-) K(✓) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on DUSKS:

D(x) – D is NOT in the word.  
U(✓) – U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).  
S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
K(✓) – K is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).  
S(✓) – S is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So the secret word has the pattern:

_ U _ K S

Letters we know are in the word: U, K, S  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, M, P, D  

Remaining letters we can use (not yet ruled out):  
B, C, F, G, H, I, J, L, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has U in position 2  
- Has K in position 4  
- Has S in position 5  
- Has no letters from the forbidden set  
- Has a letter in position 1 and 3 from the remaining allowed letters  

Possible candidates:
- B, C, F, G, H, I, L, N, V, W, Y can go in positions 1 and 3.

Let’s list some possible words fitting _ U _ K S:

- BUCKS – but C is allowed, but we have K in 4 and S in 5.  
- GUCKS – G is allowed, C is allowed.  
- HUCKS – H is allowed, C is allowed.  
- LUCKS – L is allowed, C is allowed.  
- NUCKS – N is allowed, C is allowed.  
- VUCKS – V is allowed, C is allowed.  
- WUCKS – W is allowed, C is allowed.  
- YUCKS – Y is allowed, C is allowed.  

All of these are valid English words.  
Among these, ""L"" is a very common starting letter, so let’s try LUCKS first.
