2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English 5-letter words

This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants might be in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R (-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O (x) – O is not in the word at all.
- S (-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E (x) – E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains R and S somewhere.
- Does NOT contain A, O, E.
- R cannot be in position 2.
- S cannot be in position 4.

I now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses R and S (since they’re confirmed in the word).
2. Avoids A, O, E.
3. Avoids R in position 2 and S in position 4.

Popular consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Let’s try a word that places R and S in new positions and uses other common letters. A good candidate is “STRIP”:
- S in position 1 (allowed, since S was only excluded from position 4).
- T, I, P are common consonants/vowels not yet ruled out.
- R in position 3 (allowed, since R was only excluded from position 2).

This should help narrow down the remaining possibilities.
