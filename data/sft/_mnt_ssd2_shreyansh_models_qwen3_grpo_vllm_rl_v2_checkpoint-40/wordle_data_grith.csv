- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once. Some excellent starting words include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- CRISP
- ADIEU
- AUDIO
- RAISE

These words contain common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's a strong starting word that includes three very common letters (C, R, N) and two common vowels (A, E).

So the word is: _ R I _ _

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once. Some excellent starting words include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- CRISP
- ADIEU
- AUDIO
- RAISE

These words contain common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's a strong starting word that includes three very common letters (C, R, N) and two common vowels (A, E).

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the word is _ R _ _ _
- A, N, E are not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word has R in the second position.
- It does NOT contain C, A, N, E.

We need a 5-letter word with R in the second position, avoiding C, A, N, E. We can try common letters like S, T, L, I, O, U, D, etc.

Good candidates:
- BRIAR (but has A, which is excluded)
- BRIOT (but O and T might be too specific)
- DRIED (but has E, which is excluded)
- FROST (but has O and T, and F is less common)
- GROIN (but has N, which is excluded)
- TROOP (but has O and P)
- GRIOT (but has O)
- FRIJO (but has J and O)

Let me pick ""FRUIT"" – it has R in the second position, uses common letters, and avoids C, A, N, E. Also, U and I are common vowels we haven't tested yet.

Wait, ""FRUIT"" has U and I which are good vowels to test. Let's go with it.

Current constraints:
- Position 2 is R (✓ from both guesses).
- Letters NOT in the word: C, A, N, E, F, U.
- Letters in the word but wrong position: I and T (both marked “-” in FRUIT).

So the word looks like: _ R _ _ _
- It must contain I and T somewhere, but NOT in positions 4 and 5 respectively (since they were marked “-” in FRUIT).
- Available positions for I and T: positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but I cannot be in position 4 and T cannot be in position 5, because those were their positions in FRUIT where they were marked “-”).

Possible placements:
- I could be in position 1, 3, or 5.
- T could be in position 1, 3, or 4.

We also need to avoid the banned letters C, A, N, E, F, U.

Let’s try placing I in position 1 and T in position 4: I R _ T _
The missing letter (position 3) must be a consonant not yet excluded. Common consonants left: S, D, L, G, B, M, P, etc.

Testing “IRIST” – but “IRIST” is not a valid English word.
Testing “IRKOT” – not valid.
Testing “IRLIT” – not valid.
Testing “IRGST” – not valid.

Alternative: place I in position 3 and T in position 1: T R I _ _
The missing letter (position 4 or 5) must be a consonant. Let’s try “TRIAD” – but A is banned.
“TRIED” – E is banned.
“TRIPE” – E is banned.
“TRIPS” – S is allowed. “TRIPS” is a valid word.

Check constraints:
- _ R I P S
- Contains I and T (T in position 1, I in position 3) – positions are different from FRUIT, so this satisfies the “-” feedback.
- No banned letters.
- Valid 5-letter word.

- ""M R I T _"" – nothing
- ""V R I T _"" – nothing

Wait, maybe T is in position 5:
_ R I _ T
Valid words:
- ""B R I D T"" – invalid
- ""B R I G T"" – invalid
- ""B R I K T"" – invalid
- ""B R I L T"" – invalid
- ""B R I M T"" – invalid
- ""B R I V T"" – invalid
- ""D R I B T"" – invalid
- ""D R I L T"" – invalid
- ""D R I M T"" – invalid

- ""V R I D T"" – invalid
- ""V R I G T"" – invalid
- ""V R I L T"" – invalid
- ""V R I M T"" – invalid
- ""V R I V T"" – invalid

This seems problematic. Maybe I missed a word. Let me think of 5-letter words with R in position 2 and I in position 3:
Common words: ""B R I D G"", ""C R I M E"", ""D R I V E"", ""F R I E D"", ""G R I P E"", ""H A R I C"", ""L A R I S"", ""M A R I N"", ""P R I Z E"", ""S P R I N"", ""T R I P S"", ""V I R G I"", ""W A R P A"", ""Y A R D S""

From these, filtering:
- Must have R in position 2 and I in position 3.
- Must not contain banned letters: C, A, N, E, F, U, P, S.

Looking at valid words:
- ""B R I D G"" – has A? No, but ""BRIDG"" is not valid.
- ""D R I V E"" – has E, banned.
- ""G R I P E"" – has P and E, banned.
- ""H A R I C"" – has A and C, banned.
- ""L A R I S"" – has A and S, banned.
- ""M A R I N"" – has A and N, banned.
- ""P R I Z E"" – has P and E, banned.
- ""S P R I N"" – has S and P, banned.
- ""T R I P S"" – has P and S, banned.
- ""V I R G I"" – has V, I, R, G, I – positions: V(1), I(2), R(3), G(4), I(5) – doesn't fit R in position 2.
- ""W A R P A"" – has A and P, banned.
- ""Y A R D S"" – has A and S, banned.

This is tricky. Let me reconsider the constraints:
- Pattern: _ R I _ _
- Must contain T (but T not in position 1)
- Must not contain C, A, N, E, F, U, P, S
- T must be in position 4 or 5.

Possible words:
- ""B R I T _"" – but needs 5 letters. ""BRITH"" invalid.
- ""D R I T _"" – ""DRIT_"" invalid
- ""G R I T _"" – ""GRITs"" invalid
- ""H R I T _"" – invalid
- ""L R I T _"" – invalid
- ""M R I T _"" – invalid
- ""V R I T _"" – invalid
- ""_ R I _ T"" – ""B R I D T"" invalid, ""D R I B T"" invalid, etc.

I think the only plausible word fitting these constraints is ""GRIT"" but it's 4 letters. Maybe ""GRITS"" but S is banned. 

Wait, let me check ""WRITH"" – but H is allowed. ""WRITH"" is a valid word meaning to twist. Let's check:
- W R I T H
- Pattern: W(1), R(2), I(3), T(4), H(5)
- R is in position 2 (✓)
- I is in position 3 (✓)
- T is in position 4 (different from position 1 in TRIPS, so satisfies T(-))
- No banned letters (C, A, N, E, F, U, P, S are absent)
- Valid 5-letter word.

This seems to fit all constraints.

For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once. Some excellent starting words include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- CRISP
- ADIEU
- AUDIO
- RAISE

These words contain common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's a strong starting word that includes three very common letters (C, R, N) and two common vowels (A, E).

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the word is _ R _ _ _
- A, N, E are not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word has R in the second position.
- It does NOT contain C, A, N, E.

We need a 5-letter word with R in the second position, avoiding C, A, N, E. We can try common letters like S, T, L, I, O, U, D, etc.

Good candidates:
- BRIAR (but has A, which is excluded)
- BRIOT (but O and T might be too specific)
- DRIED (but has E, which is excluded)
- FROST (but has O and T, and F is less common)
- GROIN (but has N, which is excluded)
- TROOP (but has O and P)
- GRIOT (but has O)
- FRIJO (but has J and O)

Let me pick ""FRUIT"" – it has R in the second position, uses common letters, and avoids C, A, N, E. Also, U and I are common vowels we haven't tested yet.

Wait, ""FRUIT"" has U and I which are good vowels to test. Let's go with it.

Current constraints:
- Position 2 is R (✓ from both guesses).
- Letters NOT in the word: C, A, N, E, F, U.
- Letters in the word but wrong position: I and T (both marked “-” in FRUIT).

So the word looks like: _ R _ _ _
- It must contain I and T somewhere, but NOT in positions 4 and 5 respectively (since they were marked “-” in FRUIT).
- Available positions for I and T: positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but I cannot be in position 4 and T cannot be in position 5, because those were their positions in FRUIT where they were marked “-”).

Possible placements:
- I could be in position 1, 3, or 5.
- T could be in position 1, 3, or 4.

We also need to avoid the banned letters C, A, N, E, F, U.

Let’s try placing I in position 1 and T in position 4: I R _ T _
The missing letter (position 3) must be a consonant not yet excluded. Common consonants left: S, D, L, G, B, M, P, etc.

Testing “IRIST” – but “IRIST” is not a valid English word.
Testing “IRKOT” – not valid.
Testing “IRLIT” – not valid.
Testing “IRGST” – not valid.

Alternative: place I in position 3 and T in position 1: T R I _ _
The missing letter (position 4 or 5) must be a consonant. Let’s try “TRIAD” – but A is banned.
“TRIED” – E is banned.
“TRIPE” – E is banned.
“TRIPS” – S is allowed. “TRIPS” is a valid word.

Check constraints:
- _ R I P S
- Contains I and T (T in position 1, I in position 3) – positions are different from FRUIT, so this satisfies the “-” feedback.
- No banned letters.
- Valid 5-letter word.

This seems like a good next guess.

Current knowledge:

1. Pattern: _ R I _ _  (R in position 2, I in position 3)
2. Letters NOT in the word: C, A, N, E, F, U, P, S
3. Letters in the word but wrong position:
   - T (from TRIPS feedback: T(-) means T is in the word but not in position 1)
   - (from TRUIT feedback: I(-) was actually a typo; the correct feedback shows I(✓) now, so I is correctly placed in position 3)

So the word is: _ R I _ _
- It must contain T somewhere in positions 4 or 5 (since T cannot be in position 1)
- It must not contain C, A, N, E, F, U, P, S

Possible letters left (excluding banned ones): B, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus T.

We need to place T in position 4 or 5 and choose the remaining letter from the allowed set.

Let's consider:
- Position 4: T → _ R I T _
- Position 5: T → _ R I _ T

Looking at common words:
- ""B R I T _"" → ""BRITH"" is not valid, ""BRITs"" has S which is banned.
- ""D R I T _"" → ""DRIT_"" nothing common.
- ""G R I T _"" → ""GRITs"" has S banned.
- ""H R I T _"" → nothing.
- ""L R I T _"" → nothing.
- ""M R I T _"" → nothing.
- ""O R I T _"" → ""ORBIT"" has B which is allowed, but V is allowed. ""ORBIT"" is valid.
- ""V R I T _"" → nothing.
- ""W R I T _"" → ""WRITH"" is not valid.
- ""T R I _ T"" → ""TRI_T"" but T is already in position 1 which is banned.

Wait, T must be in position 4 or 5, and we have:
- Position 1: must be a consonant not yet banned.
- Position 4 or 5: T.

Let's try ""GRIT_"" but we need 5 letters. ""GRITS"" has S banned.
""GRIT"" is 4 letters.

Looking at valid 5-letter words with pattern _ R I T _:
- ""BRITH"" – invalid
- ""CRITH"" – invalid (C banned)
- ""DRITH"" – invalid
- ""FRITH"" – invalid (F banned)
- ""GRITH"" – invalid
- ""PRITH"" – invalid (P banned)
- ""TRITH"" – invalid (T in position 1 is banned)

Next, pattern _ R I _ T:
- ""BRIFT"" – invalid (F banned)
- ""DRIFT"" – invalid (F banned)
- ""GRIFT"" – invalid (F banned)
- ""WRITH"" – invalid
- ""PRITH"" – invalid (P banned)
- ""TRIPT"" – invalid (P banned)

Hmm, let's think differently. Maybe T is in position 4:
So word is _ R I T _
We need a valid word ending with T but 5 letters. Common words:
- ""B R I T _"" – nothing
- ""D R I T _"" – nothing
- ""G R I T _"" – ""GRITs"" invalid
- ""H R I T _"" – nothing
- ""L R I T _"" – nothing
- ""M R I T _"" – nothing
- ""V R I T _"" – nothing

Wait, maybe T is in position 5:
_ R I _ T
Valid words:
- ""B R I D T"" – invalid
- ""B R I G T"" – invalid
- ""B R I K T"" – invalid
- ""B R I L T"" – invalid
- ""B R I M T"" – invalid
- ""B R I V T"" – invalid
- ""D R I B T"" – invalid
- ""D R I L T"" – invalid
- ""D R I M T"" – invalid
- ""G R I B T"" – invalid
- ""G R I D T"" – invalid
- ""G R I L T"" – invalid
- ""G R I M T"" – invalid
- ""G R I V T"" – invalid
- ""M R I D T"" – invalid
- ""M R I G T"" – invalid
- ""M R I L T"" – invalid
- ""M R I V T"" – invalid
- ""V R I D T"" – invalid
- ""V R I G T"" – invalid
- ""V R I L T"" – invalid
- ""V R I M T"" – invalid
- ""V R I V T"" – invalid

This seems problematic. Maybe I missed a word. Let me think of 5-letter words with R in position 2 and I in position 3:
Common words: ""B R I D G"", ""C R I M E"", ""D R I V E"", ""F R I E D"", ""G R I P E"", ""H A R I C"", ""L A R I S"", ""M A R I N"", ""P R I Z E"", ""S P R I N"", ""T R I P S"", ""V I R G I"", ""W A R P A"", ""Y A R D S""

From these, filtering:
- Must have R in position 2 and I in position 3.
- Must not contain banned letters: C, A, N, E, F, U, P, S.

Looking at valid words:
- ""B R I D G"" – has A? No, but ""BRIDG"" is not valid.
- ""D R I V E"" – has E, banned.
- ""G R I P E"" – has P and E, banned.
- ""H A R I C"" – has A and C, banned.
- ""L A R I S"" – has A and S, banned.
- ""M A R I N"" – has A and N, banned.
- ""P R I Z E"" – has P and E, banned.
- ""S P R I N"" – has S and P, banned.
- ""T R I P S"" – has P and S, banned.
- ""V I R G I"" – has V, I, R, G, I – positions: V(1), I(2), R(3), G(4), I(5) – doesn't fit R in position 2.
- ""W A R P A"" – has A and P, banned.
- ""Y A R D S"" – has A and S, banned.

This is tricky. Let me reconsider the constraints:
- Pattern: _ R I _ _
- Must contain T (but T not in position 1)
- Must not contain C, A, N, E, F, U, P, S
- T must be in position 4 or 5.

Possible words:
- ""B R I T _"" – but needs 5 letters. ""BRITH"" invalid.
- ""D R I T _"" – ""DRIT_"" invalid
- ""G R I T _"" – ""GRITs"" invalid
- ""H R I T _"" – invalid
- ""L R I T _"" – invalid
- ""M R I T _"" – invalid
- ""V R I T _"" – invalid
- ""_ R I _ T"" – ""B R I D T"" invalid, ""D R I B T"" invalid, etc.

I think the only plausible word fitting these constraints is ""GRIT"" but it's 4 letters. Maybe ""GRITS"" but S is banned. 

Wait, let me check ""WRITH"" – but H is allowed. ""WRITH"" is a valid word meaning to twist. Let's check:
- W R I T H
- Pattern: W(1), R(2), I(3), T(4), H(5)
- R is in position 2 (✓)
- I is in position 3 (✓)
- T is in position 4 (different from position 1 in TRIPS, so satisfies T(-))
- No banned letters (C, A, N, E, F, U, P, S are absent)
- Valid 5-letter word.

This seems to fit all constraints.

From the latest feedback (WRITH → W(x) R(✓) I(✓) T(✓) H(✓)) we now know:

- Pattern: _ R I T H  (R in 2, I in 3, T in 4, H in 5)
- First letter is NOT W (and also not C, F, P, S from earlier bans).

Letters still allowed for position 1: any consonant except C, F, P, S, W, plus vowels O, U, Y (but U is banned from Guess 2), so possible letters are: B, D, G, J, K, L, M, N, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form ? R I T H.

Common English words ending in “RITH”:
- B R I T H  → “BIRTH” (valid)
- G R I T H  → “GIRTH” (valid)
- N R I T H  → not a word
- O R I T H  → not a word
- D R I T H  → not a word
- M R I T H  → not a word
- L R I T H  → not a word
- V R I T H  → not a word
- Y R I T H  → not a word

Between “BIRTH” and “GIRTH”, both fit all constraints. Since we have only one remaining guess, we’ll test one of them.

Let’s choose “BIRTH” first.

   - However, Guess 5 now tells us R is NOT in position 3 (it's in position 2) and I is NOT in position 2 (it's in position 3). These do not conflict with the previous placements; they simply confirm the positions we already deduced.

3. Therefore, the pattern remains: _ R I T H.

4. We have only one position left to determine: the first letter. From previous exclusions, the first letter cannot be C, F, P, S, W, B. Valid remaining letters for position 1 are: D, G, J, K, L, M, N, Q, V, X, Y, Z.
