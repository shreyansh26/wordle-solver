For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AUDIO"". These words cover frequently used letters and vowels. 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it includes:
- Three vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters
- Good letter distribution across positions

This should give us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- O, S, E are not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word contains R but not in position 2.
2. The word does NOT contain A, O, S, E.
3. Therefore the remaining letters must come from the other 21 letters of the alphabet, excluding A, O, S, E.

We still have no information about consonants like T, N, L, C, D, etc., or vowels I, U. A good next guess would cover new common letters while placing R in different positions.

Possible good candidates:
- TRICK (T, R, I, C, K) - but R is in position 2 again, which we know is wrong.
- CRIMP (C, R, I, M, P) - R in position 2 again, same issue.
- BRICK (B, R, I, C, K) - R in position 2 again.
- DRIFT (D, R, I, F, T) - R in position 2 again.

Instead, we need to move R to different positions. Let's try:
- TRULY (T, R, U, L, Y) - R in position 2, still bad.
- URINE (U, R, I, N, E) - E is excluded, so no.
- URINE is invalid due to E.

Better approach: pick a word where R is not in position 2. Let's try ""FRUIT"":
- F, R, U, I, T
- R is in position 2, which we know is wrong.

Next try ""RIGHT"":
- R is in position 1 (new position), and we get new letters G, H, T, plus vowel I.

This seems good:
- R in position 1 (new)
- Tests letters G, H, T, I
- No A, O, S, E

So I'll go with RIGHT.

- R is still “-” (in the word but wrong spot).  
- I is now ✓ in position 2.  
- G, H, T are not in the word.

So we now know:
- I is fixed in position 2.  
- R must appear somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5.

- Allowed letters still include common ones like R, I (already placed), N, D, L, C, M, P, U, Y, etc.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AUDIO"". These words cover frequently used letters and vowels. 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it includes:
- Three vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters
- Good letter distribution across positions

This should give us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- O, S, E are not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word contains R but not in position 2.
2. The word does NOT contain A, O, S, E.
3. Therefore the remaining letters must come from the other 21 letters of the alphabet, excluding A, O, S, E.

We still have no information about consonants like T, N, L, C, D, etc., or vowels I, U. A good next guess would cover new common letters while placing R in different positions.

Possible good candidates:
- TRICK (T, R, I, C, K) - but R is in position 2 again, which we know is wrong.
- CRIMP (C, R, I, M, P) - R in position 2 again, same issue.
- BRICK (B, R, I, C, K) - R in position 2 again.
- DRIFT (D, R, I, F, T) - R in position 2 again.

Instead, we need to move R to different positions. Let's try:
- TRULY (T, R, U, L, Y) - R in position 2, still bad.
- URINE (U, R, I, N, E) - E is excluded, so no.
- URINE is invalid due to E.

Better approach: pick a word where R is not in position 2. Let's try ""FRUIT"":
- F, R, U, I, T
- R is in position 2, which we know is wrong.

Next try ""RIGHT"":
- R is in position 1 (new position), and we get new letters G, H, T, plus vowel I.

This seems good:
- R in position 1 (new)
- Tests letters G, H, T, I
- No A, O, S, E

So I'll go with RIGHT.

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - Letters known NOT in the word: A, O, S, E
   - Letter R is in the word, but NOT in position 2.

2. RIGHT → R(-) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(x)
   - Letters known NOT in the word: G, H, T (in addition to A, O, S, E)
   - Letter I is in the word and is in position 2 (✓).
   - Letter R is in the word but NOT in position 1.

So far:
- Positions we know:
  - Position 2 = I
- Letters known to be in the word: R, I
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, O, S, E, G, H, T
- Remaining letters to test: B, C, D, F, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 2
- Contains R somewhere (but not position 1 or 2)
- Uses only letters from the remaining pool

Possible positions for R: 3, 4, or 5.

Let's brainstorm words:
- _ I _ _ _
- R must be in 3, 4, or 5.

Examples:
- BIRCH → contains C and H, but H is excluded.
- FIRMD → contains D and M, but D is allowed.
- VIRAL → contains A, excluded.
- WIRY_ → needs a 5th letter, Y is allowed.
- FRIAR → A excluded.
- BRIAR → A excluded.
- CRIER → R in position 3, E excluded.
- TRIER → T excluded.
- WIRER → E excluded.
- DIRTY → T excluded.
- FIRER → E excluded.
- PRICK → C, K allowed.
- PRIM_ → needs a letter, R is allowed in position 3.
- PRIMR → not a word.
- PRINS → S excluded.
- PRINK → K allowed, N allowed.

PRINK seems valid:
- P I N K R
- I in position 2 (✓)
- R in position 5 (new position)
- Letters P, N, K are all allowed (not in excluded list)
- Word is valid 5-letter word.

Another option is BRISK, but S is excluded.
Another is CRIMP, but P is allowed, but R is in position 3.

Between PRINK and CRIMP, PRINK tests more new letters (P, N, K) while keeping R in a new position (5).

So I'll go with PRINK.

Let's summarize what we now know after four guesses:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - Letters NOT in word: A, O, S, E
   - R is in word, but NOT in position 2.

2. RIGHT → R(-) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(x)
   - Additional letters NOT in word: G, H, T
   - I is in position 2 (✓).

3. PRINK → P(x) R(-) I(-) N(x) K(x)
   - Additional letters NOT in word: P, N, K
   - R is in word, but NOT in position 3 (because it got ""-"" here).
   - I is in word, but NOT in position 3 (because it got ""-"" here).

So far:
- Positions we know:
  - Position 2 = I (✓ from RIGHT)
- Letters known to be in the word: R, I
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, O, S, E, G, H, T, P, N, K
- Remaining letters to test: B, C, D, F, J, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 2
- Contains R somewhere (positions allowed: 3, 4, 5)
- Uses only remaining letters (no A, O, S, E, G, H, T, P, N, K)

Let's think of possible words:
- _ I _ _ _
- R must be in 3, 4, or 5.
- Available letters: B, C, D, F, J, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Possible candidates:
- BIRCH → C and H, but H is excluded.
- CIRCA → A excluded.
- DIRTY → T excluded.
- FIRER → E excluded.
- VIRUS → U allowed, S excluded.
- WIRY_ → Y allowed, but needs 5th letter.
- FIVER → E excluded.
- CIVIL → L allowed, but V is allowed.
- CIVIL: C I V I L → I appears twice, but we only know one I is correct (position 2). The other I would get ""-"" if it's in word, but we don't know if there are two I's. However, this is risky.

Better approach: ensure only one I and R in allowed positions.

Consider:
- FIVER → E excluded.
- CIRCA → A excluded.
- VIRAL → A excluded.
- CIVIL → possible, but double I.
- BIVVY → V allowed, but double V and Y.
- DILLY → L allowed, Y allowed, but double L.
- R must be in 3,4,5.

Let's try:
- BIRCH → invalid (H).
- CIRCA → invalid (A).
- DILLY → R not included.
- FIVEL → L allowed, but E excluded.
- VIRUS → S excluded.
- WIRY_ → needs 5th letter, but only Y left.
- CIVIL → C I V I L → R not included.
- BIVVY → R not included.
- FIVER → E excluded.
- CIRCA → A excluded.

Hmm, struggling to find words with remaining letters. Let's try:
- BURIN → N excluded.
- CURIO → O excluded.
- FUROR → O excluded.
- LURID → D allowed, L allowed, R in 4, I in 2.
  - LURID: L U R I D
  - I is in position 4, but we know I must be in position 2. So this is invalid.

Another candidate:
- VIRGO → O excluded.
- FIVTH → T excluded.
- CIVVY → V allowed, Y allowed, but double V.

Wait, let's think differently: position 2 is I, R must be in 3,4,5, and use remaining letters.

Possible words:
- BIRCH → invalid (H).
- CIRCA → invalid (A).
- DILLY → no R.
- FIVEL → no R.
- LURID → I not in position 2.
- MIRZA → Z allowed, but A excluded.
- MIRZA → invalid (A).
- VIRUS → S excluded.
- WIRY_ → needs 5th letter, but only Y left, and R must be in 3,4,5.

Let's try:
- BIRCH → invalid.
- CIRCA → invalid.
- DILLY → no R.
- FIVEL → no R.
- LURID → invalid (I position).
- MIRZA → invalid (A).
- VIRUS → invalid (S).

This is tough. Maybe:
- CIVIL → no R.
- BIVVY → no R.

Let's try:
- FIVER → invalid (E).
- CIRCA → invalid (A).
- VIRAL → invalid (A).

Wait, let's list remaining letters: B, C, D, F, J, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need:
- Position 2: I
- R in 3,4, or 5
- Other letters from remaining list.

Possible word: B I R D Y
- B, I, R, D, Y
- I in 2, R in 3, D and Y allowed.
- BIRDY is a valid word (though rare, it's a 5-letter word).

Another: C I R C L → invalid (not a word).
F I R M Y → FIRMY is not a word.
L I R C H → LIRCH is not a word.

BIRDY seems the closest valid word with remaining letters.

But let's check:
- B I R D Y
- B: allowed
- I: position 2 (✓)
- R: position 3 (allowed, since we only know R not in 1,2,3? Wait, from PRINK R got ""-"" in position 3, so R cannot be in 3 either. So R must be in 4 or 5.

Ah! From PRINK, R got ""-"" in position 3, so R is NOT in 3. So R must be in 4 or 5.

So we need:
- Position 2: I
- R in 4 or 5
- Other letters from remaining list.

Let's try:
- B I _ R _
- Possible: B I L R Y → BILRY is not a word.
- B I V R Y → BIVRY is not a word.
- C I V R Y → CIVRY is not a word.
- F I V R Y → FIVRY is not a word.
- L I V R Y → LIVRY is a valid word (means livery or a type of clothing).

LIVRY:
- L I V R Y
- I in position 2 (✓)
- R in position 4 (allowed)
- L, V, Y are all allowed (not in excluded list)
- LIVRY is a valid 5-letter word.

This seems to fit all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AUDIO"". These words cover frequently used letters and vowels. 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it includes:
- Three vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters
- Good letter distribution across positions

This should give us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- O, S, E are not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word contains R but not in position 2.
2. The word does NOT contain A, O, S, E.
3. Therefore the remaining letters must come from the other 21 letters of the alphabet, excluding A, O, S, E.

We still have no information about consonants like T, N, L, C, D, etc., or vowels I, U. A good next guess would cover new common letters while placing R in different positions.

Possible good candidates:
- TRICK (T, R, I, C, K) - but R is in position 2 again, which we know is wrong.
- CRIMP (C, R, I, M, P) - R in position 2 again, same issue.
- BRICK (B, R, I, C, K) - R in position 2 again.
- DRIFT (D, R, I, F, T) - R in position 2 again.

Instead, we need to move R to different positions. Let's try:
- TRULY (T, R, U, L, Y) - R in position 2, still bad.
- URINE (U, R, I, N, E) - E is excluded, so no.
- URINE is invalid due to E.

Better approach: pick a word where R is not in position 2. Let's try ""FRUIT"":
- F, R, U, I, T
- R is in position 2, which we know is wrong.

Next try ""RIGHT"":
- R is in position 1 (new position), and we get new letters G, H, T, plus vowel I.

This seems good:
- R in position 1 (new)
- Tests letters G, H, T, I
- No A, O, S, E

So I'll go with RIGHT.

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - Letters known NOT in the word: A, O, S, E
   - Letter R is in the word, but NOT in position 2.

2. RIGHT → R(-) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(x)
   - Letters known NOT in the word: G, H, T (in addition to A, O, S, E)
   - Letter I is in the word and is in position 2 (✓).
   - Letter R is in the word but NOT in position 1.

So far:
- Positions we know:
  - Position 2 = I
- Letters known to be in the word: R, I
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, O, S, E, G, H, T
- Remaining letters to test: B, C, D, F, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 2
- Contains R somewhere (but not position 1 or 2)
- Uses only letters from the remaining pool

Possible positions for R: 3, 4, or 5.

Let's brainstorm words:
- _ I _ _ _
- R must be in 3, 4, or 5.

Examples:
- BIRCH → contains C and H, but H is excluded.
- FIRMD → contains D and M, but D is allowed.
- VIRAL → contains A, excluded.
- WIRY_ → needs a 5th letter, Y is allowed.
- FRIAR → A excluded.
- BRIAR → A excluded.
- CRIER → R in position 3, E excluded.
- TRIER → T excluded.
- WIRER → E excluded.
- DIRTY → T excluded.
- FIRER → E excluded.
- PRICK → C, K allowed.
- PRIM_ → needs a letter, R is allowed in position 3.
- PRIMR → not a word.
- PRINS → S excluded.
- PRINK → K allowed, N allowed.

PRINK seems valid:
- P I N K R
- I in position 2 (✓)
- R in position 5 (new position)
- Letters P, N, K are all allowed (not in excluded list)
- Word is valid 5-letter word.

Another option is BRISK, but S is excluded.
Another is CRIMP, but P is allowed, but R is in position 3.

Between PRINK and CRIMP, PRINK tests more new letters (P, N, K) while keeping R in a new position (5).

So I'll go with PRINK.

- MIRZA → invalid (A).
- VIRUS → S excluded.
- WIRY_ → needs 5th letter, but only Y left, and R must be in 3,4,5.

Let's try:
- BIRCH → invalid.
- CIRCA → invalid.
- DILLY → no R.
- FIVEL → no R.
- LURID → invalid (I position).
- MIRZA → invalid (A).
- VIRUS → invalid (S).

This is tough. Maybe:
- CIVIL → no R.
- BIVVY → no R.

Let's try:
- FIVER → invalid (E).
- CIRCA → invalid (A).
- VIRAL → invalid (A).

Wait, let's list remaining letters: B, C, D, F, J, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need:
- Position 2: I
- R in 3,4, or 5
- Other letters from remaining list.

Possible word: B I R D Y
- B, I, R, D, Y
- I in 2, R in 3, D and Y allowed.
- BIRDY is a valid word (though rare, it's a 5-letter word).

Another: C I R C L → invalid (not a word).
F I R M Y → FIRMY is not a word.
L I R C H → LIRCH is not a word.

BIRDY seems the closest valid word with remaining letters.

But let's check:
- B I R D Y
- B: allowed
- I: position 2 (✓)
- R: position 3 (allowed, since we only know R not in 1,2,3? Wait, from PRINK R got ""-"" in position 3, so R cannot be in 3 either. So R must be in 4 or 5.

Ah! From PRINK, R got ""-"" in position 3, so R is NOT in 3. So R must be in 4 or 5.

So we need:
- Position 2: I
- R in 4 or 5
- Other letters from remaining list.

Let's try:
- B I _ R _
- Possible: B I L R Y → BILRY is not a word.
- B I V R Y → BIVRY is not a word.
- C I V R Y → CIVRY is not a word.
- F I V R Y → FIVRY is not a word.
- L I V R Y → LIVRY is a valid word (means livery or a type of clothing).

LIVRY:
- L I V R Y
- I in position 2 (✓)
- R in position 4 (allowed)
- L, V, Y are all allowed (not in excluded list)
- LIVRY is a valid 5-letter word.

This seems to fit all constraints.
