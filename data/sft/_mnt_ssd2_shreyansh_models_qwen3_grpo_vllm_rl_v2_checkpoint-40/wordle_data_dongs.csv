### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to use a word with distinct, high-frequency letters to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

Common good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and common consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.

- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.

So we know:
- Letters to exclude: A, R, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:

2. Does not contain A, R, or E.
3. Places O somewhere other than position 3.

Possible letters left (excluding A, R, E): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I’ll look for a word that uses O and S plus other common consonants/vowels. Let’s try ""POINT"":
- P, O, I, N, T – none are excluded except O and S must be present. This lacks S, so it’s invalid.

Next, ""SPOON"":
- S, P, O, O, N – has O twice and S once. O is in positions 3 and 4, which violates the O(-) feedback (O is in word but not in position 3). Also, S is in position 1, which is allowed.

""STOIC"":
- S, T, O, I, C – O is in position 3, which is forbidden.

""SONIC"":
- S, O, N, I, C – O is in position 2, which is allowed. S is in position 1, allowed. No A, R, E. This looks good.

Let me verify:
- Contains S and O.
- S not in position 4 (it’s in 1) – OK.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters to exclude: A, R, E.
- Letters to include: O, S.
- O cannot be in position 3.
- S cannot be in position 4.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both O and S.
2. Does not contain A, R, or E.
3. Places O somewhere other than position 3.
4. Places S somewhere other than position 4.

Possible letters left (excluding A, R, E): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I’ll look for a word that uses O and S plus other common consonants/vowels. Let’s try ""POINT"":
- P, O, I, N, T – none are excluded except O and S must be present. This lacks S, so it’s invalid.

Next, ""SPOON"":
- S, P, O, O, N – has O twice and S once. O is in positions 3 and 4, which violates the O(-) feedback (O is in word but not in position 3). Also, S is in position 1, which is allowed.

""STOIC"":
- S, T, O, I, C – O is in position 3, which is forbidden.

""SONIC"":
- S, O, N, I, C – O is in position 2, which is allowed. S is in position 1, allowed. No A, R, E. This looks good.

Let me verify:
- Contains S and O.
- S not in position 4 (it’s in 1) – OK.
- O not in position 3 (it’s in 2) – OK.
- No A, R, E – OK.

I’ll go with SONIC.

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 (AROSE):
- A, R, E are NOT in the word.
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

Round 2 (SONIC):
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- O is in the word AND in position 2 (✓).
- N is in the word AND in position 3 (✓).
- I and C are NOT in the word.

Current constraints:
1. Letters known to be in the word: O, S, N.
2. Known positions:
   - O must be in position 2 (from SONIC feedback).
   - N must be in position 3 (from SONIC feedback).
3. Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, E, I, C.
4. Additional positional constraints:
   - S cannot be in position 1 (from SONIC) or position 4 (from AROSE).
   - Therefore S must be in position 3 or 5. But position 3 is already N, so S must be in position 5.
5. Position 1 and 4 are still open, but cannot be any of A, R, E, I, C.
6. Position 4 cannot be S (already handled) or any of A, R, E, I, C.

Possible letters left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Current pattern:
- Position 1: ?
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: N
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: S

We need two more letters from the allowed set for positions 1 and 4.

Let's think of common 5-letter words matching this pattern: ?ON?S

Possible candidates:
- BONDS
- DONGS
- FONDS
- HONDS
- LONDS
- MONGS
- PONDS
- TONDS
- WONDS

Among these, ""BONDS"" seems like a valid English word.

Check:
- B: allowed (not in excluded list)
- O: correct position 2
- N: correct position 3
- D: allowed
- S: correct position 5
- No A, R, E, I, C
- S is in position 5 (allowed, since it cannot be 1 or 4)
- O is in position 2 (required)
- N is in position 3 (required)

This fits all constraints.Based on the feedback, we now know:
- O must be in position 2
- N must be in position 3
- S must be in position 5 (since it can't be in positions 1 or 4)
- The letters A, R, E, I, C are not in the word

The pattern is: _ O N _ S

A valid word fitting this is BONDS.

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)

2. SONIC → S(-) O(✓) N(✓) I(x) C(x)  
   – O is in position 2.  
   – N is in position 3.  
   – S is in the word but not in position 1.

3. BONDS → B(x) O(✓) N(✓) D(-) S(✓)  
   – O is in position 2 (already known).  
   – N is in position 3 (already known).  
   – S is in position 5 (✓).  
   – D is in the word but not in position 4.  
   – B is not in the word.

Current constraints:
- Word pattern: _ O N _ S  
- Letters known to be in the word: O, N, S, D  
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, E, I, C, B  
- D must be in position 1 or 4 (but not 4, because D(-) in BONDS), so D must be in position 1.

Thus the word must be: D O N _ S

The only common 5-letter word fitting this pattern is ""DONOS"" (but that’s not a valid English word) or ""DONES"" (but E is excluded).  
Actually, the only valid English word matching D O N _ S is ""DONUT"" (but T hasn’t been confirmed).  
Wait, let’s list possible letters for position 4: allowed letters are any not excluded (not A, R, E, I, C, B, and already used O, N, S, D). So possible letters: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for real words:  
- DONGS – but G is allowed.  
- DONKS – but K is allowed.  
- DONUT – T is allowed.  
- DONBS – B is excluded.  
- DONES – E is excluded.  
- DONOS – O is already used in position 2.  

The most common valid word is ""DONUT"". Let’s check:  
D(1) O(2) N(3) U(4) T(5)  
- D is in position 1 (allowed).  
- O, N, S are in their required positions.  
- U and T are new letters; we haven’t ruled them out.  
- No excluded letters are used.  

Therefore, the next logical guess is DONUT.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to use a word with distinct, high-frequency letters to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

Common good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

Actually, the only valid English word matching D O N _ S is ""DONUT"" (but T hasn’t been confirmed).  
Wait, let’s list possible letters for position 4: allowed letters are any not excluded (not A, R, E, I, C, B, and already used O, N, S, D). So possible letters: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for real words:  
- DONGS – but G is allowed.  
- DONKS – but K is allowed.  
- DONUT – T is allowed.  
- DONBS – B is excluded.  
- DONES – E is excluded.  
- DONOS – O is already used in position 2.  

The most common valid word is ""DONUT"". Let’s check:  
D(1) O(2) N(3) U(4) T(5)  
- D is in position 1 (allowed).  
- O, N, S are in their required positions.  
- U and T are new letters; we haven’t ruled them out.  
- No excluded letters are used.  

Therefore, the next logical guess is DONUT.
