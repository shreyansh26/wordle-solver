- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate many possibilities early on. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""RAISE,"" or ""AROSE."" 

""SLATE"" is particularly strong because:
- S is very common in English words
- L is also common
- A and E are the two most frequent letters in English
- T is extremely common
- This combination covers 5 distinct letters, giving maximum information

This should provide good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down the possibilities significantly for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1, so it must be in positions 2-5).
- L is not in the word at all.
- A is not in the word at all.
- T is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5, so it must be in positions 1-4).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E.
- Does not contain L, A, T.
- S is not in position 1, E is not in position 5.

Good next steps:
1. Try to place S in positions 2-5.
2. Try to place E in positions 1-4.
3. Use other common letters not yet tested (like R, N, I, O, etc.).

A word that fits these constraints and introduces new common letters is ""SHINE"":
- S in position 1 (but we know S can't be in position 1 - this seems bad)
Wait, S can't be in position 1, so let's avoid that.

Better word: ""RISEN"" - but this has S in position 4 and E in position 2, which fits the constraints, but also uses R, I, N which are good letters to test.

Another option: ""SENOR"" - but this might be less common.

Best choice: ""RISEN"" - it places S in position 4 (allowed), E in position 2 (allowed), and introduces R, I, N which are common and untested.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate many possibilities early on. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""RAISE,"" or ""AROSE."" 

""SLATE"" is particularly strong because:
- S is very common in English words
- L is also common
- A and E are the two most frequent letters in English
- T is extremely common
- This combination covers 5 distinct letters, giving maximum information

This should provide good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down the possibilities significantly for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1, so it must be in positions 2-5).
- L is not in the word at all.
- A is not in the word at all.
- T is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5, so it must be in positions 1-4).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E.
- Does not contain L, A, T.
- S is not in position 1, E is not in position 5.

Good next steps:
1. Try to place S in positions 2-5.
2. Try to place E in positions 1-4.
3. Use other common letters not yet tested (like R, N, I, O, etc.).

A word that fits these constraints and introduces new common letters is ""SHINE"":
- S in position 1 (but we know S can't be in position 1 - this seems bad)
Wait, S can't be in position 1, so let's avoid that.

Better word: ""RISEN"" - but this has S in position 4 and E in position 2, which fits the constraints, but also uses R, I, N which are good letters to test.

Another option: ""SENOR"" - but this might be less common.

Best choice: ""RISEN"" - it places S in position 4 (allowed), E in position 2 (allowed), and introduces R, I, N which are common and untested.

From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - L, A, T are NOT in the word.
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

2. RISEN → R(x) I(✓) S(-) E(✓) N(x)
   - R and N are NOT in the word.
   - I is in the word AND in position 2.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - E is in the word AND in position 4.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: S, E, I
- Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, R, N
- Positions:
  - I is in position 2.
  - E is in position 4.
  - S must be in position 5 (since it can't be in 1 or 3, and positions 2 and 4 are taken by I and E).

Thus the word structure is: _ I _ E S

We need a 5-letter word matching this pattern, using only letters not yet ruled out (no L, A, T, R, N). Common remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:
- D I C E S
- F I V E S
- M I C E S
- P I V E S
- W I D E S

Checking these:
- DICES: valid word, uses D, C (both allowed).
- FIVES: uses F, V (both allowed).
- MICES: ""mices"" is plural of mouse, valid.
- PIVES: not a common word.
- WIDES: valid.

""DICES"" seems like the strongest common word to test next.

- M I K E S – but this would be ""MIKES"" which is plural of mike, but K is already in position 3 so this would conflict (would need K in position 3 and E in position 4, which matches, but ""MIKES"" is actually M I K E S – so this would be valid).

Wait, ""MIKES"" has structure M I K E S, which fits _ I K E S exactly.  
Let me check if M has been ruled out – no, M hasn't appeared in any guess yet.

Thus ""MIKES"" is a valid candidate.

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
   - S is in the word, not position 1.
   - L, A, T are not in the word.
   - E is in the word, not position 5.

2. RISEN → R(x) I(✓) S(-) E(✓) N(x)
   - R, N are not in the word.
   - I is in position 2.
   - S is in the word, not position 3.
   - E is in position 4.

3. DICES → D(x) I(✓) C(x) E(✓) S(✓)
   - D, C are not in the word.
   - I is in position 2.
   - E is in position 4.
   - S is in position 5.

4. BIKES → B(x) I(✓) K(✓) E(✓) S(✓)
   - B is not in the word.
   - I is in position 2.
   - K is in the word, position 3.
   - E is in position 4.
   - S is in position 5.

So the word structure is now: _ I K E S

Only the first letter remains unknown.  
Letters not yet ruled out for that first position: any letter not previously excluded (L, A, T, R, N, D, C, B).  
Common remaining letters: F, G, H, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for 5-letter words ending in IKES:
- F I K E S → ""FIKES"" – not a valid English word.
- G I K E S → ""GIKES"" – not valid.
- H I K E S → ""HIKES"" – valid word.
- M I K E S – but this would be ""MIKES"" which is plural of mike, but K is already in position 3 so this would conflict (would need K in position 3 and E in position 4, which matches, but ""MIKES"" is actually M I K E S – so this would be valid).

Wait, ""MIKES"" has structure M I K E S, which fits _ I K E S exactly.  
Let me check if M has been ruled out – no, M hasn't appeared in any guess yet.

Thus ""MIKES"" is a valid candidate.  
Another candidate is ""HIKES"".

Between these, ""HIKES"" is more common, but both fit.  
Let's choose ""HIKES"" first.",Guess 5: HIKES -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) I(✓) K(✓) E(✓) S(✓),SUCCESS
