For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible without repeating letters. 

Common strong starting words include:
- AROSE
- SLATE
- CRANE
- STARE
- ARISE

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains A, R, O, S, and E - five of the most common letters, all in different positions. This gives us the best chance to identify which of these highly frequent letters are in the secret word and their correct positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(-)  → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, E.
- Does NOT contain O or S.
- A is not in position 1, R is not in position 2, E is not in position 5.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses A, R, E in different positions than before.
- Avoids O and S.
- Uses two new letters (since we only know about A, R, E so far).

Good candidates:
- R and E must be placed in positions they weren’t in before (R not in pos 2, E not in pos 5).
- A must be placed in positions 2-5 (not 1).
- We need two new letters that are common and haven’t been tested yet (e.g., T, L, N, I, D).

A strong next guess is “R” + “A” + “E” + two new letters. Trying “RAISE” won’t work because it reuses S. Trying “TREAD” reuses D and T hasn’t been tested, but we already know A and E are in the word. A better choice is “TREAD” but we don’t know about T or D yet. 

A better approach is to use a word that shifts A, R, E to new positions and introduces new common letters. “EARLY” uses E in pos 1 (new), A in pos 2 (new), R in pos 3 (new), and introduces L and Y. However, Y is less common. 

Another good option is “TAPER”: T (new), A (moved to pos 2), P (new), E (moved to pos 4), R (moved to pos 5). This introduces T and P, both common, and shifts all known letters to new positions.

But let’s prioritize introducing more common letters. “ARISE” reuses S (invalid). “REACT” is good: R (moved to pos 1), E (moved to pos 2), A (moved to pos 3), C (new), T (new). This introduces C and T, both common, and shifts R, E, A to new positions.

However, R was in pos 2 before, and now it’s in pos 1 – allowed. E was in pos 5 before, now pos 2 – allowed. A was in pos 1 before, now pos 3 – allowed. This seems optimal.

Final choice: REACT.

From both guesses we now know:

Letters that ARE in the word (but whose positions are still unknown):
- A (from both guesses, it was marked “-” twice, so it is in the word but not in positions 1 or 3)

- E (marked “-” twice: not in positions 5 or 2)

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
- O, S (from guess 1)
- C, T (from guess 2)

So the hidden word contains A, R, E and two other letters that have not yet been tried.  
Positions ruled out so far:
- A: not 1, not 3 → must be in 2, 4, or 5
- R: not 1, not 2 → must be in 3, 4, or 5
- E: not 2, not 5 → must be in 1, 3, or 4

We still need to test several common unused letters: D, L, N, I, G, B, M, etc.  
A good next guess should:
1. Place A, R, E in still-allowed positions.
2. Introduce two new common letters.

Candidate word: “DRAIN”
- D (new), R (allowed in pos 2), A (allowed in pos 3), I (new), N (new).
But R cannot be in pos 2 (from guess 1), so discard.

Candidate word: “EARLY”
- E (pos 1) allowed, A (pos 2) allowed, R (pos 3) allowed, L (new), Y (new).
This satisfies all positional constraints and introduces two new letters.

- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, E.
- Does NOT contain O or S.
- A is not in position 1, R is not in position 2, E is not in position 5.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses A, R, E in different positions than before.
- Avoids O and S.
- Uses two new letters (since we only know about A, R, E so far).

Good candidates:
- R and E must be placed in positions they weren’t in before (R not in pos 2, E not in pos 5).
- A must be placed in positions 2-5 (not 1).
- We need two new letters that are common and haven’t been tested yet (e.g., T, L, N, I, D).

A strong next guess is “R” + “A” + “E” + two new letters. Trying “RAISE” won’t work because it reuses S. Trying “TREAD” reuses D and T hasn’t been tested, but we already know A and E are in the word. A better choice is “TREAD” but we don’t know about T or D yet. 

A better approach is to use a word that shifts A, R, E to new positions and introduces new common letters. “EARLY” uses E in pos 1 (new), A in pos 2 (new), R in pos 3 (new), and introduces L and Y. However, Y is less common. 

Another good option is “TAPER”: T (new), A (moved to pos 2), P (new), E (moved to pos 4), R (moved to pos 5). This introduces T and P, both common, and shifts all known letters to new positions.

But let’s prioritize introducing more common letters. “ARISE” reuses S (invalid). “REACT” is good: R (moved to pos 1), E (moved to pos 2), A (moved to pos 3), C (new), T (new). This introduces C and T, both common, and shifts R, E, A to new positions.

However, R was in pos 2 before, and now it’s in pos 1 – allowed. E was in pos 5 before, now pos 2 – allowed. A was in pos 1 before, now pos 3 – allowed. This seems optimal.

Final choice: REACT.

From both guesses we now know:

Letters that ARE in the word (but whose positions are still unknown):
- A (from both guesses, it was marked “-” twice, so it is in the word but not in positions 1 or 3)
- R (marked “-” twice: not in positions 2 or 1)
- E (marked “-” twice: not in positions 5 or 2)

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
- O, S (from guess 1)
- C, T (from guess 2)

So the hidden word contains A, R, E and two other letters that have not yet been tried.  
Positions ruled out so far:
- A: not 1, not 3 → must be in 2, 4, or 5
- R: not 1, not 2 → must be in 3, 4, or 5
- E: not 2, not 5 → must be in 1, 3, or 4

We still need to test several common unused letters: D, L, N, I, G, B, M, etc.  
A good next guess should:
1. Place A, R, E in still-allowed positions.
2. Introduce two new common letters.

Candidate word: “DRAIN”
- D (new), R (allowed in pos 2), A (allowed in pos 3), I (new), N (new).
But R cannot be in pos 2 (from guess 1), so discard.

Candidate word: “GRAIN”
- G (new), R (allowed in pos 2) … again R in pos 2 is disallowed.

Candidate word: “RANGE”
- R (pos 1) … disallowed (R cannot be in pos 1).

Candidate word: “EARLY”
- E (pos 1) allowed, A (pos 2) allowed, R (pos 3) allowed, L (new), Y (new).
This satisfies all positional constraints and introduces two new letters.

So I choose EARLY.

From the three guesses we now have:

Letters known to be in the word and their positions:
- A is in position 2 (✓ from EARLY).

Letters known to be in the word but not yet positioned:
- E (must be in 1, 3, or 4, but not 2 or 5)
- R (must be in 3, 4, or 5, but not 1 or 2)

Letters known NOT in the word:
- O, S, C, T, L, Y

So the hidden word looks like: _ A _ _ _
and must contain both E and R somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5.

We still need two more letters (since the word is 5 letters and we already know A, E, R are present).  The only letters we haven’t ruled out from the common set are: D, N, G, B, M, I, F, H, K, U, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep A in position 2.
2. Place E and R in still-allowed positions (3, 4, or 5).
3. Introduce two new common letters.

Possible patterns:
- _ A E R _
- _ A R E _
- _ A _ E R
- _ A _ R E

Let’s try a word that covers these constraints and introduces common new letters.  “D A R E N” would be ideal, but N is allowed and D is new.  However, “DAREN” isn’t a valid English word.

Next option: “B A R E D” – valid word, places R in 3, E in 4, and introduces B and D.
- B (new), A (fixed in 2), R (allowed in 3), E (allowed in 4), D (new).

This satisfies every constraint so far.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible without repeating letters. 

Common strong starting words include:
- AROSE
- SLATE
- CRANE
- STARE
- ARISE

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains A, R, O, S, and E - five of the most common letters, all in different positions. This gives us the best chance to identify which of these highly frequent letters are in the secret word and their correct positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(-)  → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, E.
- Does NOT contain O or S.
- A is not in position 1, R is not in position 2, E is not in position 5.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses A, R, E in different positions than before.
- Avoids O and S.
- Uses two new letters (since we only know about A, R, E so far).

Good candidates:
- R and E must be placed in positions they weren’t in before (R not in pos 2, E not in pos 5).
- A must be placed in positions 2-5 (not 1).
- We need two new letters that are common and haven’t been tested yet (e.g., T, L, N, I, D).

A strong next guess is “R” + “A” + “E” + two new letters. Trying “RAISE” won’t work because it reuses S. Trying “TREAD” reuses D and T hasn’t been tested, but we already know A and E are in the word. A better choice is “TREAD” but we don’t know about T or D yet. 

A better approach is to use a word that shifts A, R, E to new positions and introduces new common letters. “EARLY” uses E in pos 1 (new), A in pos 2 (new), R in pos 3 (new), and introduces L and Y. However, Y is less common. 

Another good option is “TAPER”: T (new), A (moved to pos 2), P (new), E (moved to pos 4), R (moved to pos 5). This introduces T and P, both common, and shifts all known letters to new positions.

But let’s prioritize introducing more common letters. “ARISE” reuses S (invalid). “REACT” is good: R (moved to pos 1), E (moved to pos 2), A (moved to pos 3), C (new), T (new). This introduces C and T, both common, and shifts R, E, A to new positions.

However, R was in pos 2 before, and now it’s in pos 1 – allowed. E was in pos 5 before, now pos 2 – allowed. A was in pos 1 before, now pos 3 – allowed. This seems optimal.

Final choice: REACT.

From both guesses we now know:

Letters that ARE in the word (but whose positions are still unknown):
- A (from both guesses, it was marked “-” twice, so it is in the word but not in positions 1 or 3)
- R (marked “-” twice: not in positions 2 or 1)
- E (marked “-” twice: not in positions 5 or 2)

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
- O, S (from guess 1)
- C, T (from guess 2)

So the hidden word contains A, R, E and two other letters that have not yet been tried.  
Positions ruled out so far:
- A: not 1, not 3 → must be in 2, 4, or 5
- R: not 1, not 2 → must be in 3, 4, or 5
- E: not 2, not 5 → must be in 1, 3, or 4

We still need to test several common unused letters: D, L, N, I, G, B, M, etc.  
A good next guess should:
1. Place A, R, E in still-allowed positions.
2. Introduce two new common letters.

Candidate word: “DRAIN”
- D (new), R (allowed in pos 2), A (allowed in pos 3), I (new), N (new).
But R cannot be in pos 2 (from guess 1), so discard.

Candidate word: “GRAIN”

Candidate word: “RANGE”
- R (pos 1) … disallowed (R cannot be in pos 1).

Candidate word: “EARLY”
- E (pos 1) allowed, A (pos 2) allowed, R (pos 3) allowed, L (new), Y (new).
This satisfies all positional constraints and introduces two new letters.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible without repeating letters. 

Common strong starting words include:
- AROSE
- SLATE
- CRANE
- STARE
- ARISE

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains A, R, O, S, and E - five of the most common letters, all in different positions. This gives us the best chance to identify which of these highly frequent letters are in the secret word and their correct positions.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(-)  → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, E.
- Does NOT contain O or S.
- A is not in position 1, R is not in position 2, E is not in position 5.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses A, R, E in different positions than before.
- Avoids O and S.
- Uses two new letters (since we only know about A, R, E so far).

Good candidates:
- R and E must be placed in positions they weren’t in before (R not in pos 2, E not in pos 5).
- A must be placed in positions 2-5 (not 1).
- We need two new letters that are common and haven’t been tested yet (e.g., T, L, N, I, D).

A strong next guess is “R” + “A” + “E” + two new letters. Trying “RAISE” won’t work because it reuses S. Trying “TREAD” reuses D and T hasn’t been tested, but we already know A and E are in the word. A better choice is “TREAD” but we don’t know about T or D yet. 

A better approach is to use a word that shifts A, R, E to new positions and introduces new common letters. “EARLY” uses E in pos 1 (new), A in pos 2 (new), R in pos 3 (new), and introduces L and Y. However, Y is less common. 

Another good option is “TAPER”: T (new), A (moved to pos 2), P (new), E (moved to pos 4), R (moved to pos 5). This introduces T and P, both common, and shifts all known letters to new positions.

But let’s prioritize introducing more common letters. “ARISE” reuses S (invalid). “REACT” is good: R (moved to pos 1), E (moved to pos 2), A (moved to pos 3), C (new), T (new). This introduces C and T, both common, and shifts R, E, A to new positions.

However, R was in pos 2 before, and now it’s in pos 1 – allowed. E was in pos 5 before, now pos 2 – allowed. A was in pos 1 before, now pos 3 – allowed. This seems optimal.

Final choice: REACT.

Guess 2: REACT -> FEEDBACK: R(-) E(-) A(-) C(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From both guesses we now know:

Letters that ARE in the word (but whose positions are still unknown):
- A (from both guesses, it was marked “-” twice, so it is in the word but not in positions 1 or 3)
- R (marked “-” twice: not in positions 2 or 1)
- E (marked “-” twice: not in positions 5 or 2)

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
- O, S (from guess 1)
- C, T (from guess 2)

So the hidden word contains A, R, E and two other letters that have not yet been tried.  
Positions ruled out so far:
- A: not 1, not 3 → must be in 2, 4, or 5
- R: not 1, not 2 → must be in 3, 4, or 5
- E: not 2, not 5 → must be in 1, 3, or 4

We still need to test several common unused letters: D, L, N, I, G, B, M, etc.  
A good next guess should:
1. Place A, R, E in still-allowed positions.
2. Introduce two new common letters.

Candidate word: “DRAIN”
- D (new), R (allowed in pos 2), A (allowed in pos 3), I (new), N (new).
But R cannot be in pos 2 (from guess 1), so discard.

Candidate word: “GRAIN”
- G (new), R (allowed in pos 2) … again R in pos 2 is disallowed.

Candidate word: “RANGE”
- R (pos 1) … disallowed (R cannot be in pos 1).

Candidate word: “EARLY”
- E (pos 1) allowed, A (pos 2) allowed, R (pos 3) allowed, L (new), Y (new).
This satisfies all positional constraints and introduces two new letters.

So I choose EARLY.

Guess 3: EARLY -> FEEDBACK: E(-) A(✓) R(-) L(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three guesses we now have:

Letters known to be in the word and their positions:
- A is in position 2 (✓ from EARLY).

Letters known to be in the word but not yet positioned:
- E (must be in 1, 3, or 4, but not 2 or 5)
- R (must be in 3, 4, or 5, but not 1 or 2)

Letters known NOT in the word:
- O, S, C, T, L, Y

So the hidden word looks like: _ A _ _ _
and must contain both E and R somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5.

We still need two more letters (since the word is 5 letters and we already know A, E, R are present).  The only letters we haven’t ruled out from the common set are: D, N, G, B, M, I, F, H, K, U, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep A in position 2.
2. Place E and R in still-allowed positions (3, 4, or 5).
3. Introduce two new common letters.

Possible patterns:
- _ A E R _
- _ A R E _
- _ A _ E R
- _ A _ R E

Let’s try a word that covers these constraints and introduces common new letters.  “D A R E N” would be ideal, but N is allowed and D is new.  However, “DAREN” isn’t a valid English word.

Next option: “B A R E D” – valid word, places R in 3, E in 4, and introduces B and D.
- B (new), A (fixed in 2), R (allowed in 3), E (allowed in 4), D (new).

This satisfies every constraint so far.

From the latest feedback (FAKER → F(x) A(✓) K(✓) E(✓) R(✓)) we now know:

- Positions 2, 3, 4, 5 are locked in as A-K-E-R.
- Position 1 must be a letter that is NOT F (since F got “x”) and has not yet been eliminated by any previous feedback.

Letters already ruled out across all guesses:  
O, S, C, T, L, Y, B, D, F

The only common, unused letter left for the first slot is “N”.

Therefore the secret word must be N A K E R → “NAKER”.
