For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it covers common letters and provides good coverage. However, ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of 'O' which is very common in English words.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear in the secret word at all.  
That means I must avoid every one of those letters for the next guess.  
To maximize information, I want a word that:
- is 5 letters long  
- uses none of A, R, O, S, E  
- contains common remaining consonants and vowels (I, U, T, N, L, C, etc.)  

A strong candidate is “UNTIL”:  
- U and I cover two remaining vowels.  
- N, T, L cover common consonants not yet ruled out.  
- No forbidden letters (A, R, O, S, E) appear.  

Other possibilities like “INPUT”, “UNITY”, or “UNTIL” all fit, but “UNTIL” gives good coverage of frequent consonants.

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → all letters (A, R, O, S, E) are NOT in the word.
2. UNTIL → U, T, L are NOT in the word, but N and I ARE in the word (wrong positions).

So far we know:
- The word contains N and I, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L.

Remaining common letters that have not been ruled out:
Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y
Vowels: I (already confirmed), Y (sometimes used as vowel)

Since we have two confirmed letters (N and I), we need to place them in new positions and fill the rest with still-allowed letters. A good strategy is to pick a word that:
- Uses N and I in new positions.
- Uses other common remaining letters to maximize information.

Possible candidates:
- ""CHINK"" – but K is allowed, but we already ruled out C and H? Wait, no, C and H haven't been tested yet. But we have I and N to place.
- ""MINCY"" – uses M, I, N, C, Y. Positions: I in 2, N in 3. But we know I is not in position 4 (from UNTIL feedback), but this would put I in position 2 which is new.
- ""PINNY"" – but double N might not be optimal.

From the three guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A, R, O, S, E are all absent.
2. UNTIL → U, T, L are absent; N and I are present but in wrong positions.
3. MINKY → M, K are absent; I is now in the correct position (position 2); N is still present but still in the wrong position.

So far we know:
- Letters confirmed in the word: I (fixed at position 2), N (somewhere else).
- Letters confirmed absent: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, M, K.
- Remaining untested common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, P, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 2.
- Contains N somewhere (but not in position 3, since that was the position in MINKY where it was marked wrong).
- Uses only letters from the remaining pool (no A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, M, K).

Possible positions for N: 1, 4, or 5 (since it was wrong in position 3 in MINKY).

Let’s look for a word with I in position 2 and N in one of the other positions, using remaining letters.

Candidate words:
- ""BINGO"" – but O is ruled out.
- ""DINGY"" – D, I, N, G, Y. I is in position 2, N in position 3 (but we know N was wrong in position 3 in MINKY). So N would be in the same wrong spot again – not allowed.
- ""PINKY"" – P, I, N, K, Y. But K is ruled out.
- ""WINCH"" – W, I, N, C, H. I is in position 2, N in position 3 (again the same wrong spot as before – position 3). Not allowed.
- ""FINGY"" – F, I, N, G, Y. N in position 3 again. Not allowed.
- ""HINNY"" – H, I, N, N, Y. N appears twice, but we don’t know if N appears twice. Also N in position 3 again. Not ideal.
- ""PINGY"" – P, I, N, G, Y. N in position 3 again. Not allowed.
- ""VINYL"" – but L is ruled out.
- ""DINGO"" – O ruled out.
- ""WINCH"" already considered.
- ""FINGY"" already considered.

Alternative approach: move N to position 4 or 5.

Looking for words with I in position 2, N in position 4 or 5, using remaining letters.

Possible:
- ""BINGO"" – O ruled out.
- ""CINCH"" – C, I, N, C, H. I in position 2, N in position 3 (still wrong spot). Not allowed.
- ""DINGY"" – N in position 3 (wrong spot). Not allowed.
- ""FINGY"" – N in position 3. Not allowed.
- ""HINNY"" – N in position 3 and 4. Not ideal.
- ""PINGY"" – N in position 3. Not allowed.
- ""WINDY"" – W, I, N, D, Y. I in position 2, N in position 3 (still wrong spot). Not allowed.

Hmm, seems like most common words place N in position 3 when I is fixed in position 2. Let me think differently – maybe N is in position 4 or 5.

Looking for words with I in position 2, N in position 4 or 5.

Possible:
- ""FIBNY"" – but B, F, N, Y – not a valid word.
- ""DINER"" – E and R ruled out.
- ""VINYL"" – L ruled out.
- ""WINCH"" – N in position 3 (already saw this).
- ""HINNY"" – N in position 3 and 4.
- ""PINKY"" – K ruled out.
- ""DINGY"" – N in position 3.

Actually, ""DINGY"" has N in position 3, which we know is wrong from MINKY feedback. So we need to avoid N in position 3.

Let me try ""HINNY"" – even though N is in position 3 and 4, maybe the first N is in position 1. But the word is H-I-N-N-Y, so positions are:
1: H
2: I (correct)
3: N (wrong position)
4: N (could be correct or not)
5: Y (correct)

But N was marked wrong in position 3 in MINKY, so position 3 is definitely wrong for N. Thus, HINNY has N in position 3 (wrong) and 4 (possible). Not ideal.

Another candidate: ""FIBNY"" – but not a valid word.

""WINCH"" – W, I, N, C, H. N is in position 3 (wrong). Not allowed.

""VINDY"" – V, I, N, D, Y. N in position 3 (wrong). Not allowed.

""FINCH"" – F, I, N, C, H. N in position 3 (wrong). Not allowed.

""GIMNY"" – G, I, M, N, Y. M is ruled out.

""BINCH"" – B, I, N, C, H. N in position 3 (wrong). Not allowed.

""PINCH"" – P, I, N, C, H. N in position 3 (wrong). Not allowed.

""WINCH"" – same issue.

""MINCY"" – M ruled out.

""DINGY"" – N in position 3.

This seems tricky. Maybe N is in position 4 or 5.

Looking for words with I in position 2, N in position 4 or 5, using remaining letters.

Possible:
- ""FIBNY"" – invalid.
- ""VINNY"" – N in position 4 and 5, but V, I, N, N, Y. I in position 2. This seems possible. Let me check if VINNY is a valid word – yes, it is (though rare).

But VINNY is informal. 

Another: ""DINNY"" – D, I, N, N, Y. Valid word, but N in position 3 again.

""WINDY"" – W, I, N, D, Y. N in position 3 (wrong).

""FINNY"" – F, I, N, N, Y. N in position 3 and 4. Position 3 is wrong, but position 4 is new.

This might be the best option. FINNY has:
- I in position 2 (correct)
- N in position 3 (we know this is wrong from MINKY, but it also has N in position 4)
- Uses F, N, Y which are allowed.

But since N must be somewhere else, maybe position 4 is the correct spot. FINNY has N in position 3 (wrong) and 4 (possible). This might still be useful to test N in position 4.

Alternatively, ""DINGY"" has N in position 3 (wrong), but position 4 is G (allowed).

Another word: ""HINNY"" – H, I, N, N, Y. N in position 3 (wrong) and 4 (possible).

Between FINNY and HINNY, FINNY seems slightly better.

But let me think of another: ""PINGY"" – P, I, N, G, Y. N in position 3 (wrong).

""WINCH"" – N in position 3 (wrong).

""DINGY"" – N in position 3 (wrong).

This seems to be a pattern. Maybe N is in position 1 or 4 or 5.

Looking for words with I in position 2, N in position 1, 4, or 5.

Possible:
- ""NINNY"" – N, I, N, N, Y. I in position 2. N in position 1 and 3,4,5. This is valid but has N in position 1 (new) and 3 (wrong), 4 (possible), 5 (possible).

But N in position 1 is new.

Another: ""VINNY"" – V, I, N, N, Y. N in position 3 (wrong) and 4 (possible).

""WINNY"" – W, I, N, N, Y. Same as VINNY with W.

""FINNY"" – F, I, N, N, Y. Same with F.

""NINNY"" – N, I, N, N, Y. N in position 1 (new) and 3,4,5. Position 3 is wrong, but positions 1,4,5 are new.

This seems the best option to test N in position 1 and see if N appears twice.

Thus, I'll go with ""NINNY"".

Based on the feedback so far:
- I is locked in position 2.
- N is in the word but not in positions 3 (from MINKY) or 2 (from UNTIL).
- Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, P, V, W, Y (plus the confirmed I and N).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it covers common letters and provides good coverage. However, ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of 'O' which is very common in English words.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear in the secret word at all.  
That means I must avoid every one of those letters for the next guess.  
To maximize information, I want a word that:
- is 5 letters long  
- uses none of A, R, O, S, E  
- contains common remaining consonants and vowels (I, U, T, N, L, C, etc.)  

A strong candidate is “UNTIL”:  
- U and I cover two remaining vowels.  
- N, T, L cover common consonants not yet ruled out.  
- No forbidden letters (A, R, O, S, E) appear.  

Other possibilities like “INPUT”, “UNITY”, or “UNTIL” all fit, but “UNTIL” gives good coverage of frequent consonants.

So far we know:
- The word contains N and I, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L.

Remaining common letters that have not been ruled out:
Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y
Vowels: I (already confirmed), Y (sometimes used as vowel)

Since we have two confirmed letters (N and I), we need to place them in new positions and fill the rest with still-allowed letters. A good strategy is to pick a word that:
- Uses N and I in new positions.
- Uses other common remaining letters to maximize information.

Possible candidates:
- ""CHINK"" – but K is allowed, but we already ruled out C and H? Wait, no, C and H haven't been tested yet. But we have I and N to place.
- ""MINCY"" – uses M, I, N, C, Y. Positions: I in 2, N in 3. But we know I is not in position 4 (from UNTIL feedback), but this would put I in position 2 which is new.

- ""FIBNY"" – but B, F, N, Y – not a valid word.
- ""DINER"" – E and R ruled out.
- ""VINYL"" – L ruled out.
- ""WINCH"" – N in position 3 (already saw this).
- ""HINNY"" – N in position 3 and 4.
- ""PINKY"" – K ruled out.
- ""DINGY"" – N in position 3.

Actually, ""DINGY"" has N in position 3, which we know is wrong from MINKY feedback. So we need to avoid N in position 3.

Let me try ""HINNY"" – even though N is in position 3 and 4, maybe the first N is in position 1. But the word is H-I-N-N-Y, so positions are:
1: H
2: I (correct)
3: N (wrong position)
4: N (could be correct or not)
5: Y (correct)

But N was marked wrong in position 3 in MINKY, so position 3 is definitely wrong for N. Thus, HINNY has N in position 3 (wrong) and 4 (possible). Not ideal.

Another candidate: ""FIBNY"" – but not a valid word.

""WINCH"" – W, I, N, C, H. N is in position 3 (wrong). Not allowed.

""VINDY"" – V, I, N, D, Y. N in position 3 (wrong). Not allowed.

""FINCH"" – F, I, N, C, H. N in position 3 (wrong). Not allowed.

""GIMNY"" – G, I, M, N, Y. M is ruled out.

""BINCH"" – B, I, N, C, H. N in position 3 (wrong). Not allowed.

""PINCH"" – P, I, N, C, H. N in position 3 (wrong). Not allowed.

""WINCH"" – same issue.

""MINCY"" – M ruled out.

""DINGY"" – N in position 3.

This seems tricky. Maybe N is in position 4 or 5.

Looking for words with I in position 2, N in position 4 or 5, using remaining letters.

Possible:
- ""FIBNY"" – invalid.
- ""VINNY"" – N in position 4 and 5, but V, I, N, N, Y. I in position 2. This seems possible. Let me check if VINNY is a valid word – yes, it is (though rare).

But VINNY is informal. 

Another: ""DINNY"" – D, I, N, N, Y. Valid word, but N in position 3 again.

""WINDY"" – W, I, N, D, Y. N in position 3 (wrong).

""FINNY"" – F, I, N, N, Y. N in position 3 and 4. Position 3 is wrong, but position 4 is new.

This might be the best option. FINNY has:
- I in position 2 (correct)
- N in position 3 (we know this is wrong from MINKY, but it also has N in position 4)
- Uses F, N, Y which are allowed.

But since N must be somewhere else, maybe position 4 is the correct spot. FINNY has N in position 3 (wrong) and 4 (possible). This might still be useful to test N in position 4.

Alternatively, ""DINGY"" has N in position 3 (wrong), but position 4 is G (allowed).

Another word: ""HINNY"" – H, I, N, N, Y. N in position 3 (wrong) and 4 (possible).

Between FINNY and HINNY, FINNY seems slightly better.

But let me think of another: ""PINGY"" – P, I, N, G, Y. N in position 3 (wrong).

""WINCH"" – N in position 3 (wrong).

""DINGY"" – N in position 3 (wrong).

This seems to be a pattern. Maybe N is in position 1 or 4 or 5.

Looking for words with I in position 2, N in position 1, 4, or 5.

Possible:
- ""NINNY"" – N, I, N, N, Y. I in position 2. N in position 1 and 3,4,5. This is valid but has N in position 1 (new) and 3 (wrong), 4 (possible), 5 (possible).

But N in position 1 is new.

Another: ""VINNY"" – V, I, N, N, Y. N in position 3 (wrong) and 4 (possible).

""WINNY"" – W, I, N, N, Y. Same as VINNY with W.

""FINNY"" – F, I, N, N, Y. Same with F.

""NINNY"" – N, I, N, N, Y. N in position 1 (new) and 3,4,5. Position 3 is wrong, but positions 1,4,5 are new.

This seems the best option to test N in position 1 and see if N appears twice.

Thus, I'll go with ""NINNY"".Based on the feedback so far:
- I is locked in position 2.
- N is in the word but not in positions 3 (from MINKY) or 2 (from UNTIL).
- Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, P, V, W, Y (plus the confirmed I and N).

The word ""NINNY"" places N in position 1 (new), keeps I in position 2 (correct), and tests N again in positions 4 and 5 while using only allowed letters.

From the four guesses we now know:

1. Letters that are **not** in the word:  
   A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, M, K, N (except where N is confirmed).

2. Letters that **are** in the word and their exact positions:  
   - Position 1: N (✓)  
   - Position 2: I (✓)  
   - Position 5: Y (✓)

3. Remaining letters still allowed (have never been guessed):  
   B, C, D, F, G, H, P, V, W, plus the already-placed N, I, Y.

4. The word pattern so far:  
   N I _ _ Y

5. From Guess 4 (NINNY) we also learned that N appears **only once** in the word (because the second N in position 3 was marked “-” = wrong position, and the third N in position 4 was also marked “-”). Therefore the word contains exactly one N, and it is correctly placed at position 1.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with N I
- Ends with Y
- Uses only the still-allowed letters for the 3rd and 4th positions (B, C, D, F, G, H, P, V, W)
- Is a valid English word

Possible candidates:
- N I B B Y  → “NIBBY” – valid
- N I C C Y  → “NICCY” – uncommon, but valid
- N I D D Y  → “NIDDY” – rare
- N I F F Y  → “NIFFY” – rare
- N I G G Y  → “NIGGY” – slang, probably not allowed
- N I P P Y  → “NIPPY” – uncommon
- N I V V Y  → “NIVVY” – rare
- N I W W Y  → “NIWWY” – invalid

Among these, “NIBBY” is the most common English word that fits the pattern and uses only allowed letters.

Hence, the next logical guess is “NIBBY”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it covers common letters and provides good coverage. However, ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of 'O' which is very common in English words.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear in the secret word at all.  
That means I must avoid every one of those letters for the next guess.  
To maximize information, I want a word that:
- is 5 letters long  
- uses none of A, R, O, S, E  
- contains common remaining consonants and vowels (I, U, T, N, L, C, etc.)  

A strong candidate is “UNTIL”:  
- U and I cover two remaining vowels.  
- N, T, L cover common consonants not yet ruled out.  
- No forbidden letters (A, R, O, S, E) appear.  

Other possibilities like “INPUT”, “UNITY”, or “UNTIL” all fit, but “UNTIL” gives good coverage of frequent consonants.

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → all letters (A, R, O, S, E) are NOT in the word.
2. UNTIL → U, T, L are NOT in the word, but N and I ARE in the word (wrong positions).

So far we know:
- The word contains N and I, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L.

Remaining common letters that have not been ruled out:
Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y
Vowels: I (already confirmed), Y (sometimes used as vowel)

Since we have two confirmed letters (N and I), we need to place them in new positions and fill the rest with still-allowed letters. A good strategy is to pick a word that:
- Uses N and I in new positions.
- Uses other common remaining letters to maximize information.

Possible candidates:
- ""CHINK"" – but K is allowed, but we already ruled out C and H? Wait, no, C and H haven't been tested yet. But we have I and N to place.
- ""MINCY"" – uses M, I, N, C, Y. Positions: I in 2, N in 3. But we know I is not in position 4 (from UNTIL feedback), but this would put I in position 2 which is new.
- ""PINNY"" – but double N might not be optimal.
- ""MINKY"" – uses M, I, N, K, Y. I in position 2, N in position 3. This seems good.

Let's go with ""MINKY"" as it uses two confirmed letters (I and N) in new positions and introduces three new common letters (M, K, Y) that haven't been tested yet.

Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) L(x)
Guess 3: MINKY -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(✓) N(-) K(x) Y(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A, R, O, S, E are all absent.
2. UNTIL → U, T, L are absent; N and I are present but in wrong positions.
3. MINKY → M, K are absent; I is now in the correct position (position 2); N is still present but still in the wrong position.

So far we know:
- Letters confirmed in the word: I (fixed at position 2), N (somewhere else).
- Letters confirmed absent: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, M, K.
- Remaining untested common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, P, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 2.
- Contains N somewhere (but not in position 3, since that was the position in MINKY where it was marked wrong).
- Uses only letters from the remaining pool (no A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, M, K).

Possible positions for N: 1, 4, or 5 (since it was wrong in position 3 in MINKY).

Let’s look for a word with I in position 2 and N in one of the other positions, using remaining letters.

Candidate words:
- ""BINGO"" – but O is ruled out.
- ""DINGY"" – D, I, N, G, Y. I is in position 2, N in position 3 (but we know N was wrong in position 3 in MINKY). So N would be in the same wrong spot again – not allowed.
- ""PINKY"" – P, I, N, K, Y. But K is ruled out.
- ""WINCH"" – W, I, N, C, H. I is in position 2, N in position 3 (again the same wrong spot as before – position 3). Not allowed.
- ""FINGY"" – F, I, N, G, Y. N in position 3 again. Not allowed.
- ""HINNY"" – H, I, N, N, Y. N appears twice, but we don’t know if N appears twice. Also N in position 3 again. Not ideal.
- ""PINGY"" – P, I, N, G, Y. N in position 3 again. Not allowed.
- ""VINYL"" – but L is ruled out.
- ""DINGO"" – O ruled out.
- ""WINCH"" already considered.
- ""FINGY"" already considered.

Alternative approach: move N to position 4 or 5.

Looking for words with I in position 2, N in position 4 or 5, using remaining letters.

Possible:
- ""BINGO"" – O ruled out.
- ""CINCH"" – C, I, N, C, H. I in position 2, N in position 3 (still wrong spot). Not allowed.
- ""DINGY"" – N in position 3 (wrong spot). Not allowed.
- ""FINGY"" – N in position 3. Not allowed.
- ""HINNY"" – N in position 3 and 4. Not ideal.
- ""PINGY"" – N in position 3. Not allowed.
- ""WINDY"" – W, I, N, D, Y. I in position 2, N in position 3 (still wrong spot). Not allowed.

Hmm, seems like most common words place N in position 3 when I is fixed in position 2. Let me think differently – maybe N is in position 4 or 5.

Looking for words with I in position 2, N in position 4 or 5.

Possible:
- ""FIBNY"" – but B, F, N, Y – not a valid word.
- ""DINER"" – E and R ruled out.
- ""VINYL"" – L ruled out.
- ""WINCH"" – N in position 3 (already saw this).
- ""HINNY"" – N in position 3 and 4.
- ""PINKY"" – K ruled out.
- ""DINGY"" – N in position 3.

Actually, ""DINGY"" has N in position 3, which we know is wrong from MINKY feedback. So we need to avoid N in position 3.

Let me try ""HINNY"" – even though N is in position 3 and 4, maybe the first N is in position 1. But the word is H-I-N-N-Y, so positions are:
1: H
2: I (correct)
3: N (wrong position)
4: N (could be correct or not)
5: Y (correct)

But N was marked wrong in position 3 in MINKY, so position 3 is definitely wrong for N. Thus, HINNY has N in position 3 (wrong) and 4 (possible). Not ideal.

Another candidate: ""FIBNY"" – but not a valid word.

""WINCH"" – W, I, N, C, H. N is in position 3 (wrong). Not allowed.

""VINDY"" – V, I, N, D, Y. N in position 3 (wrong). Not allowed.

""FINCH"" – F, I, N, C, H. N in position 3 (wrong). Not allowed.

""GIMNY"" – G, I, M, N, Y. M is ruled out.

""BINCH"" – B, I, N, C, H. N in position 3 (wrong). Not allowed.

""PINCH"" – P, I, N, C, H. N in position 3 (wrong). Not allowed.

""WINCH"" – same issue.

""MINCY"" – M ruled out.

""DINGY"" – N in position 3.

This seems tricky. Maybe N is in position 4 or 5.

Looking for words with I in position 2, N in position 4 or 5, using remaining letters.

Possible:
- ""FIBNY"" – invalid.
- ""VINNY"" – N in position 4 and 5, but V, I, N, N, Y. I in position 2. This seems possible. Let me check if VINNY is a valid word – yes, it is (though rare).

But VINNY is informal. 

Another: ""DINNY"" – D, I, N, N, Y. Valid word, but N in position 3 again.

""WINDY"" – W, I, N, D, Y. N in position 3 (wrong).

""FINNY"" – F, I, N, N, Y. N in position 3 and 4. Position 3 is wrong, but position 4 is new.

This might be the best option. FINNY has:
- I in position 2 (correct)
- N in position 3 (we know this is wrong from MINKY, but it also has N in position 4)
- Uses F, N, Y which are allowed.

But since N must be somewhere else, maybe position 4 is the correct spot. FINNY has N in position 3 (wrong) and 4 (possible). This might still be useful to test N in position 4.

Alternatively, ""DINGY"" has N in position 3 (wrong), but position 4 is G (allowed).

Another word: ""HINNY"" – H, I, N, N, Y. N in position 3 (wrong) and 4 (possible).

Between FINNY and HINNY, FINNY seems slightly better.

But let me think of another: ""PINGY"" – P, I, N, G, Y. N in position 3 (wrong).

""WINCH"" – N in position 3 (wrong).

""DINGY"" – N in position 3 (wrong).

This seems to be a pattern. Maybe N is in position 1 or 4 or 5.

Looking for words with I in position 2, N in position 1, 4, or 5.

Possible:
- ""NINNY"" – N, I, N, N, Y. I in position 2. N in position 1 and 3,4,5. This is valid but has N in position 1 (new) and 3 (wrong), 4 (possible), 5 (possible).

But N in position 1 is new.

Another: ""VINNY"" – V, I, N, N, Y. N in position 3 (wrong) and 4 (possible).

""WINNY"" – W, I, N, N, Y. Same as VINNY with W.

""FINNY"" – F, I, N, N, Y. Same with F.

""NINNY"" – N, I, N, N, Y. N in position 1 (new) and 3,4,5. Position 3 is wrong, but positions 1,4,5 are new.

This seems the best option to test N in position 1 and see if N appears twice.

Thus, I'll go with ""NINNY"".Based on the feedback so far:
- I is locked in position 2.
- N is in the word but not in positions 3 (from MINKY) or 2 (from UNTIL).
- Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, P, V, W, Y (plus the confirmed I and N).

The word ""NINNY"" places N in position 1 (new), keeps I in position 2 (correct), and tests N again in positions 4 and 5 while using only allowed letters.

From the four guesses we now know:

1. Letters that are **not** in the word:  
   A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, M, K, N (except where N is confirmed).

2. Letters that **are** in the word and their exact positions:  
   - Position 1: N (✓)  
   - Position 2: I (✓)  
   - Position 5: Y (✓)

3. Remaining letters still allowed (have never been guessed):  
   B, C, D, F, G, H, P, V, W, plus the already-placed N, I, Y.

4. The word pattern so far:  
   N I _ _ Y

5. From Guess 4 (NINNY) we also learned that N appears **only once** in the word (because the second N in position 3 was marked “-” = wrong position, and the third N in position 4 was also marked “-”). Therefore the word contains exactly one N, and it is correctly placed at position 1.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with N I
- Ends with Y
- Uses only the still-allowed letters for the 3rd and 4th positions (B, C, D, F, G, H, P, V, W)
- Is a valid English word

Possible candidates:
- N I B B Y  → “NIBBY” – valid
- N I C C Y  → “NICCY” – uncommon, but valid
- N I D D Y  → “NIDDY” – rare
- N I F F Y  → “NIFFY” – rare
- N I G G Y  → “NIGGY” – slang, probably not allowed
- N I P P Y  → “NIPPY” – uncommon
- N I V V Y  → “NIVVY” – rare
- N I W W Y  → “NIWWY” – invalid

Among these, “NIBBY” is the most common English word that fits the pattern and uses only allowed letters.

Hence, the next logical guess is “NIBBY”.

- N I D _ Y → NID_Y  
- N I F _ Y → NIF_Y  
- N I G _ Y → NIG_Y  
- N I H _ Y → N IH_Y  
- N I P _ Y → NIP_Y  
- N I V _ Y → NIV_Y  
- N I W _ Y → NIW_Y  

Scanning valid English words:
- NIC_Y  → NICCY (valid but uncommon)  
- NID_Y  → No common word  
- NIF_Y  → NIFFY (rare)  
- NIG_Y  → NIGY (invalid)  
- N IH_Y → NINHY (invalid)  
- NIP_Y  → NINPY (invalid)  
- NIV_Y  → NIVVY (invalid)  
- NIW_Y  → NIWWY (invalid)  

The only common English word left is “NICCY” (meaning “nervous or fidgety”). Although it’s not the most common word, it’s the only valid candidate that fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess must be “NICCY”.

- Pattern: N I _ _ Y  
- Letters confirmed in exact positions: N (1), I (2), Y (5)  
- Letters ruled out entirely: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, M, K, B  
- Still-allowed letters for positions 3 & 4: C, D, F, G, H, P, V, W  

We need a 5-letter word that starts with “NI”, ends with “Y”, and uses only the remaining letters in positions 3 and 4.
