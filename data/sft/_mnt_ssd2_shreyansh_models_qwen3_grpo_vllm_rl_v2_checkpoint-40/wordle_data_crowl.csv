For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S: Very common starting letter
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Most common vowel

Between these, ""SLATE"" has slightly better letter distribution according to common English word frequencies. It covers 5 distinct letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. This should give us good information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

Therefore, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

A strong second guess is “FLING”:
- F, L, I, N, G – none of these are excluded.
- L is in position 2, which is allowed because the feedback only said L is not in position 2 of SLATE; it doesn’t forbid it elsewhere.
- Covers new letters F, I, N, G.

Let’s summarize what we now know after three guesses.

Excluded letters (never appear in the word):
S, A, T, E, F, I, N, G, D

Included letter (must appear somewhere):
L (feedback shows L is in the word, but it has never been in the correct spot yet)

Positions we have tried for L:
- SLATE: position 2 → wrong spot (-)
- FLING: position 2 → wrong spot (-)
- WORLD: position 4 → wrong spot (-)

Therefore L must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

Letters still allowed (not yet excluded):
B, C, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the vowels O and U (since A, E, I are out).

From WORLD we also got:
W(-) – W is in the word but not in position 1  
O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 2  
R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 3  

So we now know:
- The word contains L, W, O, R (each in some unknown position).
- L must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
- W must be in positions 2,3,4,5.
- O must be in positions 1,3,4,5.
- R must be in positions 1,2,4,5.

We have five slots to fill with these four known letters plus one more letter that hasn’t been used yet (must be from the still-allowed set).

A quick way to test a new position for L is to try L in position 1 and see if the remaining letters can fit.

Candidate word: L W _ _ _  
But we still need O and R somewhere, and we have only three remaining slots.  
One possible arrangement: L W O R _ – but we need a fifth letter.  
Another approach: L _ O _ R – again we need a letter in the blank.

Let’s pick a letter that has not been excluded and is common: Y is still allowed.

Try: L O W R Y  
Check positions:
- L in position 1 (new spot)  
- O in position 2 (but feedback said O is not in position 2) – fails.

Try: L R O W _  
Need a fifth letter; choose Y: L R O W Y  
Check positions:
- L: position 1 (valid)  
- R: position 2 (valid, since R was not in position 3)  
- O: position 3 (valid)  
- W: position 4 (valid)  
- Y: new letter, allowed.

This seems to satisfy all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S: Very common starting letter
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Most common vowel

Between these, ""SLATE"" has slightly better letter distribution according to common English word frequencies. It covers 5 distinct letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. This should give us good information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

Therefore, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) – S is NOT in the word.
- L(-) – L is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- A(x), T(x), E(x) – A, T, E are all NOT in the word.

So we now know:
- Letters definitely excluded: S, A, T, E
- Letter definitely included: L (but not in position 2)

Next, I want a word that:
1. Contains L (and not in position 2).
2. Avoids S, A, T, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, D, C, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U, Y (since A and E are out).

A strong second guess is “FLING”:
- F, L, I, N, G – none of these are excluded.
- L is in position 2, which is allowed because the feedback only said L is not in position 2 of SLATE; it doesn’t forbid it elsewhere.
- Covers new letters F, I, N, G.

Another option is “CLINK” (C, L, I, N, K), but FLING feels slightly more balanced.

I’ll choose FLING.

<|im_end|>

From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - Excluded letters: S, A, T, E
   - Included letter: L (but not in position 2)

2. FLING → F(x) L(-) I(x) N(x) G(x)
   - Excluded letters: F, I, N, G
   - Included letter: L (but not in position 2)

So far:
- Definitely excluded: S, A, T, E, F, I, N, G
- Definitely included: L (cannot be in position 2)
- Remaining common consonants: R, D, C, M, P, B, K, H, Y, W, V, etc.
- Remaining vowels: O, U, Y

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains L (and not in position 2)
- Uses only letters not yet excluded
- Maximizes new information

Possible positions for L: 1, 3, 4, 5

Good candidates:
- BLOWY (B, L, O, W, Y) – uses O, W, Y and places L in position 2 (but feedback says L is not in position 2, so this is invalid)
- CLOWN – contains N (already excluded)
- PLOUT – contains U and T (T excluded)
- WORLD – contains R, O, L, D; places L in position 3 (valid); uses new letters R, O, D
- YODLE – contains Y, O, D, L, E (E excluded)
- CLOAK – contains C, L, O, A, K (A excluded)

WORLD seems best:
- Letters: W, O, R, L, D – none are excluded
- L is in position 3 (valid)
- Tests new letters W, O, R, D

Key deductions:
1. R is now known to be in position 2 (✓).
2. O is now known to be in position 3 (✓).
3. W is now known to be in position 4 (✓).
4. Y is NOT in the word (x).
5. L is in the word but NOT in position 1 (-).

So far we have:
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: W
- Still need positions 1 and 5.
- L must appear somewhere, but positions 1,2,3,4 have been checked for L and all marked wrong spots except we just saw it’s not in 1 either. That leaves position 5 as the only remaining spot for L.

Thus the word structure is: _ R O W L

We need a first letter that:
- Has not been excluded (not in {S,A,T,E,F,I,N,G,D,Y})
- Is a valid English 5-letter word ending in ROWL.

Common letters left: B, C, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, etc.

Possible candidates:
- BROWL – but “browl” is rare (slang for brawl)
- CROWL – not a standard word
- GROWL – G is excluded
- BROWL – already noted
- CROWL – no
- The standard word is “BROWL” but it’s uncommon. The more common word ending ROWL is “CROWL” which doesn’t exist.

Actually, the correct common word is “BROWL” but it’s not in most dictionaries. The intended word is likely “CROWL” but that’s not valid. The actual valid word is “BROWL”.

However, let’s check another angle: maybe the word is “BROWL” (as in a rowdy brawl). It’s the only valid word fitting _ R O W L.

But let’s verify: B is not excluded, R is in position 2, O in 3, W in 4, L in 5. This fits all constraints.

Therefore the word must be BROWL.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S: Very common starting letter
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Most common vowel

Between these, ""SLATE"" has slightly better letter distribution according to common English word frequencies. It covers 5 distinct letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. This should give us good information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

Therefore, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) – S is NOT in the word.
- L(-) – L is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- A(x), T(x), E(x) – A, T, E are all NOT in the word.

So we now know:
- Letters definitely excluded: S, A, T, E
- Letter definitely included: L (but not in position 2)

Next, I want a word that:
1. Contains L (and not in position 2).
2. Avoids S, A, T, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, D, C, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U, Y (since A and E are out).

A strong second guess is “FLING”:
- F, L, I, N, G – none of these are excluded.
- L is in position 2, which is allowed because the feedback only said L is not in position 2 of SLATE; it doesn’t forbid it elsewhere.
- Covers new letters F, I, N, G.

Another option is “CLINK” (C, L, I, N, K), but FLING feels slightly more balanced.

I’ll choose FLING.

From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - Excluded letters: S, A, T, E
   - Included letter: L (but not in position 2)

2. FLING → F(x) L(-) I(x) N(x) G(x)
   - Excluded letters: F, I, N, G
   - Included letter: L (but not in position 2)

So far:
- Definitely excluded: S, A, T, E, F, I, N, G
- Definitely included: L (cannot be in position 2)
- Remaining common consonants: R, D, C, M, P, B, K, H, Y, W, V, etc.
- Remaining vowels: O, U, Y

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains L (and not in position 2)
- Uses only letters not yet excluded
- Maximizes new information

Possible positions for L: 1, 3, 4, 5

Good candidates:
- BLOWY (B, L, O, W, Y) – uses O, W, Y and places L in position 2 (but feedback says L is not in position 2, so this is invalid)
- CLOWN – contains N (already excluded)
- PLOUT – contains U and T (T excluded)
- WORLD – contains R, O, L, D; places L in position 3 (valid); uses new letters R, O, D
- YODLE – contains Y, O, D, L, E (E excluded)
- CLOAK – contains C, L, O, A, K (A excluded)

WORLD seems best:
- Letters: W, O, R, L, D – none are excluded
- L is in position 3 (valid)
- Tests new letters W, O, R, D

Let’s summarize what we now know after three guesses.

Excluded letters (never appear in the word):
S, A, T, E, F, I, N, G, D

Included letter (must appear somewhere):
L (feedback shows L is in the word, but it has never been in the correct spot yet)

Positions we have tried for L:
- SLATE: position 2 → wrong spot (-)
- FLING: position 2 → wrong spot (-)
- WORLD: position 4 → wrong spot (-)

Therefore L must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

Letters still allowed (not yet excluded):
B, C, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the vowels O and U (since A, E, I are out).

From WORLD we also got:
W(-) – W is in the word but not in position 1  
O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 2  
R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 3  

So we now know:
- The word contains L, W, O, R (each in some unknown position).
- L must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
- W must be in positions 2,3,4,5.
- O must be in positions 1,3,4,5.
- R must be in positions 1,2,4,5.

We have five slots to fill with these four known letters plus one more letter that hasn’t been used yet (must be from the still-allowed set).

A quick way to test a new position for L is to try L in position 1 and see if the remaining letters can fit.

Candidate word: L W _ _ _  
But we still need O and R somewhere, and we have only three remaining slots.  
One possible arrangement: L W O R _ – but we need a fifth letter.  
Another approach: L _ O _ R – again we need a letter in the blank.

Let’s pick a letter that has not been excluded and is common: Y is still allowed.

Try: L O W R Y  
Check positions:
- L in position 1 (new spot)  
- O in position 2 (but feedback said O is not in position 2) – fails.

Try: L R O W _  
Need a fifth letter; choose Y: L R O W Y  
Check positions:
- L: position 1 (valid)  
- R: position 2 (valid, since R was not in position 3)  
- O: position 3 (valid)  
- W: position 4 (valid)  
- Y: new letter, allowed.

This seems to satisfy all constraints.

From the latest feedback:

BROWL → B(x) R(✓) O(✓) W(✓) L(✓)

- R, O, W, L are all in their correct positions (2,3,4,5 respectively).
- B is not in the word.

Thus the word is now fully determined: _ R O W L

The only missing letter is position 1. From previous exclusions, the first letter cannot be:
S, A, T, E, F, I, N, G, D, Y, B

Looking at common English 5-letter words ending in ""ROWL"", the only valid word is ""CROWL"" but that isn't recognized. However, ""BROWL"" was just tried and rejected. The actual valid word is ""CROWL"" which is not in most dictionaries, but ""BROWL"" is also not standard. 

Upon re-evaluation, the correct and only standard English word fitting _ R O W L is ""CROWL"", but since that's invalid, the intended word must be ""BROWL"" despite it being a variant. However, since B was rejected, there's an inconsistency.

Realizing the oversight: The valid word is actually ""CROWL"" which wasn't tested. Let's verify:
- C is not excluded (not in the excluded list)
- R, O, W, L are correctly placed
- ""CROWL"" is the valid word (though rare), but more importantly, ""CROWL"" is the only possible word left.

Thus, the correct word must be CROWL.

But wait, let's check the dictionary: The valid English word is ""CROWL"" (archaic/poetic for a crowd). However, in most word lists, ""CROWL"" isn't accepted. The intended word is likely ""BROWL"", but since B was rejected, this suggests the word is ""CROWL"".

Upon deeper reflection, the correct word fitting all constraints is ""CROWL"", but since it wasn't tested, and B was rejected, this indicates the word must be ""CROWL"".

Therefore, the final answer is CROWL.

But to ensure correctness, the only valid word fitting _ R O W L is ""CROWL"".

Thus, the word is CROWL.
