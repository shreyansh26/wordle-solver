For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

Some popular starting words include:
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (contains A, R, O, S, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid word. This should give us good coverage of frequent letters in the English language.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (1st letter) is not in the word at all (x).
- R (2nd letter) is in the word and in the correct position (✓). So the word is _ R _ _ _.
- O (3rd letter) is not in the word (x).
- S (4th letter) is in the word but in the wrong position (-). So S appears somewhere else in the word (positions 1,3,5).
- E (5th letter) is not in the word (x).

Letters we know are in the word: R (position 2), S (somewhere else).
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, O, E.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- R in position 2.
- S somewhere else (positions 1,3,5).
- No A, O, E.

Possible patterns:
- S R _ _ _ (but S was in position 4 before, so this is possible)
- _ R S _ _
- _ R _ S _
- _ R _ _ S

Let's think of words fitting these patterns, avoiding A, O, E.
For _ R S _ _, possible words: BRISE, CRISE, DRISE, FRISE, PRISE, TRISE
For _ R _ S _, possible words: BURST, DURST, FURST, etc. (but must avoid A,O,E)
For _ R _ _ S, possible words: BURKS, CURDS, DRIPS, etc.

A good next guess would be ""BRISE"" (B R I S E), but E is excluded. So ""BRISE"" is invalid.
""BRISE"" has E which is excluded.

Next option: ""BURST"" (B U R S T) - this has R in position 3, but we know R must be in position 2. So this is invalid.

Next option: ""FRISK"" (F R I S K) - R is in position 2 (correct), S is in position 4 (but was in position 4 before and marked wrong position, so S must be elsewhere). So this is invalid because S is in position 4 again.

Next option: ""CRISP"" (C R I S P) - R in position 2 (correct), S in position 4 (same as before, which was wrong position). Invalid.

Next option: ""DRIPS"" (D R I P S) - R in position 2 (correct), S in position 5 (new position). This seems valid as it doesn't contain A, O, E.

""DRIPS"" fits:
- R in position 2 (✓)
- S in position 5 (new position)
- No A, O, E
- Uses common letters D, R, I, P, S

This seems like a good next guess.
