For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S: Very common starting letter
- L: Common consonant
- A: Most common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Most common letter in English

This combination gives me good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are all NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
So the secret word contains the letter E but NOT in the 5th position, and it definitely does NOT contain S, L, A, or T.

My next guess should:
1. Keep the letter E (but not in the 5th spot).
2. Avoid S, L, A, T entirely.
3. Introduce new common consonants and vowels to test.

Good letters to try next: R, N, I, O, U, C, H, etc.

Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, R, O  
Letters that ARE in the word: E (but not in position 4 or 5), N (and it is in position 4).

So far:
- Position 4 is N (✓).

- We still need to test other common letters (especially vowels and consonants we haven’t tried).

Good remaining common letters: I, U, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

A word that uses E in one of the first three positions, includes N in position 4, and introduces new common letters is “MONEY”:
- M, O, N, E, Y.
- However, O is already ruled out (x in CRONE), so MONEY is invalid.

Next option: “HONEY”
- H, O, N, E, Y → O is ruled out again.

Next: “PENNY”

We still need to test common remaining consonants and vowels:  
D, G, H, I, K, M, P, W, Y, etc.  

We want a 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ E _ N _ and only uses letters not yet ruled out.

Looking for real words that fit _ E _ N _ and avoid all banned letters:  
- ""WEDGE"" – but D is okay, G is okay, W is okay, but it would place E in position 2 (✓), N is missing.  
- ""HEDGE"" – same issue, N missing.  
- ""M E N _ _"" – but N is already in position 4, so MEN_ _ would require N in 3, which conflicts.  

Wait, we need _ E _ N _ exactly.  

Valid words fitting this pattern:

Another possibility: ""P E N E E"" – but that's not a word.

I think the best available word that fits _ E _ N _ and avoids all banned letters is ""W E I N E"", even if it's uncommon.  

However, let me double-check:  
Banned letters: S, L, A, T, C, R, O, V, U

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S: Very common starting letter
- L: Common consonant
- A: Most common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Most common letter in English

This combination gives me good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are all NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
So the secret word contains the letter E but NOT in the 5th position, and it definitely does NOT contain S, L, A, or T.

My next guess should:
1. Keep the letter E (but not in the 5th spot).
2. Avoid S, L, A, T entirely.
3. Introduce new common consonants and vowels to test.

Good letters to try next: R, N, I, O, U, C, H, etc.

A balanced word that meets these criteria is “CRONE”:
- C, R, O, N are new letters.
- E is reused but placed in position 4 (not 5).

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, R, O  
Letters that ARE in the word: E (but not in position 4 or 5), N (and it is in position 4).

So far:
- Position 4 is N (✓).
- E must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3.
- We still need to test other common letters (especially vowels and consonants we haven’t tried).

Good remaining common letters: I, U, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

A word that uses E in one of the first three positions, includes N in position 4, and introduces new common letters is “MONEY”:
- M, O, N, E, Y.
- However, O is already ruled out (x in CRONE), so MONEY is invalid.

Next option: “HONEY”
- H, O, N, E, Y → O is ruled out again.

Next: “PENNY”
- P, E, N, N, Y → N is already in position 4, and we don’t know if N repeats. Also Y is less common.

Next: “WOKEN”
- W, O, K, E, N → O is ruled out.

Next: “UPSET”
- U, P, S, E, T → S, T ruled out.

Next: “GUIDE”
- G, U, I, D, E → all new letters except E, and N is missing (must be in position 4).

We need a word with:
- N in position 4
- E in position 1, 2, or 3
- No S, L, A, T, C, R, O

A valid word: “INLET” → but T is ruled out.

Another: “UNFED” → D is okay, but N must be in position 4.

“HUNGE” → N is in position 4, E in 5 (but E can’t be in 5). Invalid.

“PENGO” → O ruled out.

“BENCH” → N in 4, E in 2, C ruled out.

“MENDE” → not a common word.

“VENUE” → N in 4, E in 2, U and V new.

Let’s use “VENUE”:
- V, E, N, U, E → N in 4, E in 2, and introduces V, U.

But double E is okay; the main thing is N in 4 and E in 2/3.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S: Very common starting letter
- L: Common consonant
- A: Most common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Most common letter in English

This combination gives me good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are all NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
So the secret word contains the letter E but NOT in the 5th position, and it definitely does NOT contain S, L, A, or T.

My next guess should:
1. Keep the letter E (but not in the 5th spot).
2. Avoid S, L, A, T entirely.
3. Introduce new common consonants and vowels to test.

Good letters to try next: R, N, I, O, U, C, H, etc.

A balanced word that meets these criteria is “CRONE”:
- C, R, O, N are new letters.
- E is reused but placed in position 4 (not 5).

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, R, O  
Letters that ARE in the word: E (but not in position 4 or 5), N (and it is in position 4).

So far:
- Position 4 is N (✓).
- E must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3.
- We still need to test other common letters (especially vowels and consonants we haven’t tried).

Good remaining common letters: I, U, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

A word that uses E in one of the first three positions, includes N in position 4, and introduces new common letters is “MONEY”:
- M, O, N, E, Y.
- However, O is already ruled out (x in CRONE), so MONEY is invalid.

Next option: “HONEY”
- H, O, N, E, Y → O is ruled out again.

Next: “PENNY”
- P, E, N, N, Y → N is already in position 4, and we don’t know if N repeats. Also Y is less common.

Next: “WOKEN”
- W, O, K, E, N → O is ruled out.

Next: “UPSET”
- U, P, S, E, T → S, T ruled out.

Next: “GUIDE”
- G, U, I, D, E → all new letters except E, and N is missing (must be in position 4).

We need a word with:
- N in position 4
- E in position 1, 2, or 3
- No S, L, A, T, C, R, O

A valid word: “INLET” → but T is ruled out.

Another: “UNFED” → D is okay, but N must be in position 4.

“HUNGE” → N is in position 4, E in 5 (but E can’t be in 5). Invalid.

“PENGO” → O ruled out.

“BENCH” → N in 4, E in 2, C ruled out.

“MENDE” → not a common word.

“VENUE” → N in 4, E in 2, U and V new.

Let’s use “VENUE”:
- V, E, N, U, E → N in 4, E in 2, and introduces V, U.

But double E is okay; the main thing is N in 4 and E in 2/3.

From the three rounds of feedback we now have:

Letters that are NOT in the word:  
S, L, A, T, C, R, O, V, U  

Letters that ARE in the word:  
E (must be in position 2, because it was ✓ there)  
N (must be in position 4, because it was ✓ there)  

So the pattern so far is:  
_ E _ N _  

We still need to test common remaining consonants and vowels:  
D, G, H, I, K, M, P, W, Y, etc.  

We want a 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ E _ N _ and only uses letters not yet ruled out.

Possible candidates:  
- M E D N E (invalid, not a word)  
- P E D N E (invalid)  
- H E I N E (invalid)  
- W E I N E (invalid)  
- D E E N _ (invalid)  
- G E I N E (invalid)  
- M E I N E (invalid)  
- H E I N E (invalid)  
- P E I N E (invalid)  
- W E I N E (invalid)  

Looking for real words that fit _ E _ N _ and avoid all banned letters:  
- ""WEDGE"" – but D is okay, G is okay, W is okay, but it would place E in position 2 (✓), N is missing.  
- ""HEDGE"" – same issue, N missing.  
- ""M E N _ _"" – but N is already in position 4, so MEN_ _ would require N in 3, which conflicts.  

Wait, we need _ E _ N _ exactly.  

Valid words fitting this pattern:  
- ""W E I N E"" – but U is already ruled out, and ""WEINE"" is not a common English word.  
- ""H E I N E"" – not a word.  
- ""P E I N E"" – not a word.  
- ""D E E N E"" – not a word.  
- ""G E I N E"" – not a word.  

Let me think differently: perhaps ""WEDGE"" is actually _ E _ N _?  
No, ""WEDGE"" is W E D G E – positions 2 and 5 are E, but N is missing.  

Another approach: list all 5-letter words with pattern _ E _ N _ and check against banned letters.  

Possible candidates:  
- ""W E I N E"" – not valid.  
- ""H E I N E"" – not valid.  
- ""M E I N E"" – not valid.  
- ""P E I N E"" – not valid.  
- ""D E E N E"" – not valid.  

Wait, ""W E I N E"" is actually a word (a type of wine), but it's uncommon.  

Another: ""B E I N E"" – B is not ruled out, but ""BEINE"" is not standard.  

""F E I N E"" – F is not ruled out, ""FEINE"" is not standard.  

""G E I N E"" – not standard.  

""K E I N E"" – not standard.  

""L E I N E"" – L is ruled out.  

""M E I N E"" – not standard.  

""N E I N E"" – N is in position 4, but this would have N in 1 and 4, which might be possible.  

""NEINE"" is not a standard word.  

""P E I N E"" – not standard.  

""Q E I N E"" – Q is not ruled out, but ""QEINE"" is not a word.  

""R E I N E"" – R is ruled out.  

""S E I N E"" – S is ruled out.  

""T E I N E"" – T is ruled out.  

""V E I N E"" – V is ruled out.  

""W E I N E"" – as above.  

""X E I N E"" – X is not ruled out, but ""XEINE"" is not a word.  

""Y E I N E"" – Y is not ruled out, ""YEINE"" is not a word.  

""Z E I N E"" – Z is not ruled out, ""ZEINE"" is not a word.  

Hmm, seems like the only possible word is ""W E I N E"", but it's uncommon.  

Let me try ""D E N E E"" – but that's D E N E E, which is not standard.  

Wait, ""W E I N E"" is actually recognized as a variant spelling of ""wined"" in some contexts, but it's obscure.  

Another possibility: ""P E N E E"" – but that's not a word.  

Let me try ""H E N D E"" – but N is in position 3 here, conflicting with position 4.  

I think the best available word that fits _ E _ N _ and avoids all banned letters is ""W E I N E"", even if it's uncommon.  

However, let me double-check:  
Banned letters: S, L, A, T, C, R, O, V, U  
Allowed letters: B, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, W, Y, etc.  

""W E I N E"" uses W, E, I, N, E – all allowed, and fits _ E _ N _ (positions 2 and 4).  

Therefore, I'll proceed with ""WEINE"" as the next guess.

Let's summarize what we know after five guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x):
S, L, A, T, C, R, O, V, U, W, I, D, G

Letters that ARE in the word:
E (must be in position 2, because it was ✓ there in every guess)
N (must be in position 4, because it was ✓ there in guesses 2 and 5)

So the pattern is: _ E _ N _

We need a 5-letter word that fits this pattern and only uses letters that have NOT been marked x.

Allowed letters left (besides E and N already placed):
B, F, H, K, M, P, Y, plus any others not in the x list.

We need to fill positions 1, 3, 5 with these allowed letters, making sure we don't repeat any x letters.

Possible candidates:
- B E F N E  (BEFNE – not a word)
- B E H N E  (BEHNE – not a word)
- B E K N E  (BEKNE – not a word)
- B E M N E  (BEMNE – not a word)

- Y E M N E  (YEMNE – not a word)
- Y E P N E  (YEPNE – not a word)
- Y E Y N E  (YENYE – not a word)

Hmm, none of these combinations seem to form valid English words. This suggests we might need to consider that the letter E could appear more than once in the word, even though it's already confirmed in position 2. Let me check if any valid words fit _ E _ N _ using the remaining letters.

Valid 5-letter words fitting _ E _ N _:
- BENCH – but C and H are allowed? C is ruled out (x), so no.
- M E N D E – not a word.
- P E N N E – but N is already in position 4, and this would have N in 3 and 4, which might be possible, but is PENNE a valid word? It's a type of pasta, so yes.
- F E N C E – but C is ruled out.
- H E N C E – C ruled out.
- W E N C E – W and C ruled out.
- V E N D E – V ruled out.
- L E N S E – L and S ruled out.
- T E N T E – T ruled out.
- S E N S E – S ruled out.
- R E N T E – R ruled out.

From this, ""PENNE"" seems to be the only valid word left that fits the pattern and uses allowed letters (P, E, N, N, E). Although N is already confirmed in position 4, having N in position 3 is possible unless the word doesn't have repeated letters. The feedback has never indicated that letters are unique, so repetition is allowed.

Therefore, PENNE is the best next guess.
