For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me gather information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants. 

Some common letters in English are: A, E, T, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U, M, W, F, G, Y, P, B.

I'll choose a word that uses several of these. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English 5-letter words

- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.

- A is in position 2 (not 1).
- O is not used, but we can test another vowel (I) and consonants T, N.
- However, this might not test O in a new position.

""COAST"" uses S (invalid).
""COBIA"" uses B (not super common).

""PLANT"" uses P, L, N, T and has A in position 2, but no O.

""TONAL"" has O in position 2 (new), A in position 4 (new), and introduces T, N, L.

Structure: _ _ N O A

Valid word: “PHENO” – but E is forbidden.

“MONDO” – but O is in position 4 (allowed), but D is okay.

Wait, let’s try “CANON” – but N is already in position 3, and we can’t have two N’s unless it’s allowed (but we don’t know if N repeats).

Better: “HONDA” – but D and H are okay, and A is in position 5 (allowed), O in position 2 is forbidden (from tonal feedback), so O can’t be in 2.

Check constraints:
- N is in position 3: ✓.
- A is in position 2 (not 1 or 4): ✓.
- O is not in this word – but we know O must be in the word. So “PANIC” is invalid because it lacks O.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me gather information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants. 

Some common letters in English are: A, E, T, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U, M, W, F, G, Y, P, B.

I'll choose a word that uses several of these. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English 5-letter words

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word contains A and O, but not R, S, or E.
2. A is not in position 1.
3. O is not in position 3.

Next, I want to:
- Keep A and O in new positions.
- Avoid R, S, E.
- Introduce new common letters (T, I, N, L, C, U, etc.).

A good candidate is ""TAINT"":
- T, I, N are new letters.
- A is in position 2 (not 1).
- O is not used, but we can test another vowel (I) and consonants T, N.
- However, this might not test O in a new position.

Better: ""COAT"" is only 4 letters. Need 5.

""COAST"" uses S (invalid).
""COBIA"" uses B (not super common).
""COATL"" is not a valid word.

""PLANT"" uses P, L, N, T and has A in position 2, but no O.

""TONAL"" has O in position 2 (new), A in position 4 (new), and introduces T, N, L.

""TONAL"" seems good:
- T, O, N, A, L.
- O not in position 3 (good, now in 2).
- A not in position 1 (good, now in 4).
- No R, S, E.
- Common letters T, N, L.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.
   - R, S, E are not in the word.

2. tonal → T(x) O(-) N(✓) A(-) L(x)
   - N is in position 3 and is correct.
   - O is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A is in the word but not in position 4.
   - T and L are not in the word.

Current constraints:
- Letters known to be in the word: A, O, N (and N is fixed in position 3).
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, S, E, T, L.
- Positions:
  - Position 3: N (fixed).
  - A is not in position 1 or 4.
  - O is not in position 2 or 3.

Possible positions for A: 2, 3, 5. But 3 is N, so A must be in 2 or 5.
Possible positions for O: 1, 4, 5 (cannot be 2 or 3).

Let’s try a word that:
- Keeps N in position 3.
- Places A in position 2 (since it can’t be 1 or 4).
- Places O in position 1 (since it can’t be 2 or 3).
- Uses new common letters for positions 4 and 5, avoiding forbidden letters (R,S,E,T,L).

Candidate: O A N _ _

Letters left to try: C, D, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Good consonants to test: C, D, G, H, M, P.

Let’s try “OAN” + “CH” → “OANCH” – but “OANCH” is not a valid word.

Try “OAN” + “IM” → “OANIM” – invalid.

Try “OAN” + “GO” → “OANGO” – invalid.

Instead, let’s try placing O in position 4 and A in position 5.

Structure: _ _ N O A

Valid word: “PHENO” – but E is forbidden.

“MONDO” – but O is in position 4 (allowed), but D is okay.

Wait, let’s try “CANON” – but N is already in position 3, and we can’t have two N’s unless it’s allowed (but we don’t know if N repeats).

Better: “HONDA” – but D and H are okay, and A is in position 5 (allowed), O in position 2 is forbidden (from tonal feedback), so O can’t be in 2.

Let’s try O in position 1, A in position 2, N in 3, and new letters for 4-5.

“O A N _ _”

Valid word: “OAN” + “IM” → “OANIM” – invalid.

“OAN” + “GO” → “OANGO” – invalid.

“OAN” + “CH” → “OANCH” – invalid.

Alternative: O in position 4, A in position 2, N in 3.

Structure: _ A N O _

Valid word: “P A N O ?” – “PANOR” – invalid (R forbidden).

“P A N O ?” – “PANIC” – C is okay, but A is in 2 (allowed), O in 4 (allowed), I in 5 (new), C in 5 (new).

But we need 5 letters, so “PANIC” fits: P A N I C.

Check constraints:
- N is in position 3: ✓.
- A is in position 2 (not 1 or 4): ✓.
- O is not in this word – but we know O must be in the word. So “PANIC” is invalid because it lacks O.

We must include O, A, N.

Let’s try O in position 5, A in position 2, N in 3.

Structure: _ A N _ O

Valid word: “C A N D O” – “CANDO” – not common.

“B A N K O” – B, K okay, but “BANKO” is not standard.

“M A N G O” – M, G okay, and “MANGO” is valid.

Check constraints:
- M, A, N, G, O.
- N is in position 3: ✓.
- A is in position 2 (not 1 or 4): ✓.
- O is in position 5 (not 2 or 3): ✓.
- No R, S, E, T, L: ✓.

Perfect.

“P A N O ?” – “PANIC” – C is okay, but A is in 2 (allowed), O in 4 (allowed), I in 5 (new), C in 5 (new).

But we need 5 letters, so “PANIC” fits: P A N I C.

Check constraints:
- N is in position 3: ✓.
- A is in position 2 (not 1 or 4): ✓.
- O is not in this word – but we know O must be in the word. So “PANIC” is invalid because it lacks O.

We must include O, A, N.

Let’s try O in position 5, A in position 2, N in 3.

Structure: _ A N _ O

Valid word: “C A N D O” – “CANDO” – not common.

“B A N K O” – B, K okay, but “BANKO” is not standard.

“M A N G O” – M, G okay, and “MANGO” is valid.

Check constraints:
- M, A, N, G, O.
- N is in position 3: ✓.
- A is in position 2 (not 1 or 4): ✓.
- O is in position 5 (not 2 or 3): ✓.
- No R, S, E, T, L: ✓.

Perfect.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: tonal -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(-) N(✓) A(-) L(x)
Guess 3: mango -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(✓) N(✓) G(x) O(✓)

<|im_start|>assistant
From the latest feedback:

- M(x) → M is not in the word.
- A(✓) → A is in position 2 and is correct.
- N(✓) → N is in position 3 and is correct.
- G(x) → G is not in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in position 5 and is correct.

So the word has the fixed pattern:
_ A N _ O

Letters already ruled out: R, S, E, T, L, M, G.

Remaining unused common consonants: B, C, D, F, H, K, P, U, V, W, Y.

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 4, avoiding all forbidden letters.

Let’s list valid 5-letter words matching the pattern _ A N _ O:

- B A N A O – invalid (A already used in position 2).
- B A N D O – “BANDO” – not standard.
- B A N K O – “BANKO” – not standard.
- C A N C O – “CANCE” – invalid (E ruled out).
- C A N D O – “CANDO” – not standard.
- C A N H O – not a word.
- F A N G O – G ruled out.
- H A N D O – “MANDO” – no.
- P A N D O – “PANDO” – no.
- P A N I O – not a word.
- P A N D O – again, no.
- V A N E O – E ruled out.
- W A N D O – “WANDO” – no.
- Y A N C O – no.

Wait, let’s think of real words:

- “C A N A D O” – too long.
- “P A N D A” – ends wrong.
- “B A N J O” – J is unused, but “BANJO” is valid.

Check “BANJO”:
- B A N J O.
- Pattern _ A N _ O: yes, fits B A N J O.
- Letters: B, A, N, J, O.
- All letters are allowed (B, J not ruled out).
- It’s a valid English word.

Therefore, the next guess is “BANJO”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me gather information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants. 

Some common letters in English are: A, E, T, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U, M, W, F, G, Y, P, B.

I'll choose a word that uses several of these. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English 5-letter words

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word contains A and O, but not R, S, or E.
2. A is not in position 1.
3. O is not in position 3.

Next, I want to:
- Keep A and O in new positions.
- Avoid R, S, E.
- Introduce new common letters (T, I, N, L, C, U, etc.).

A good candidate is ""TAINT"":
- T, I, N are new letters.
- A is in position 2 (not 1).
- O is not used, but we can test another vowel (I) and consonants T, N.
- However, this might not test O in a new position.

Better: ""COAT"" is only 4 letters. Need 5.

""COAST"" uses S (invalid).
""COBIA"" uses B (not super common).
""COATL"" is not a valid word.

""PLANT"" uses P, L, N, T and has A in position 2, but no O.

""TONAL"" has O in position 2 (new), A in position 4 (new), and introduces T, N, L.

""TONAL"" seems good:
- T, O, N, A, L.
- O not in position 3 (good, now in 2).
- A not in position 1 (good, now in 4).
- No R, S, E.
- Common letters T, N, L.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.
   - R, S, E are not in the word.

2. tonal → T(x) O(-) N(✓) A(-) L(x)
   - N is in position 3 and is correct.
   - O is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A is in the word but not in position 4.
   - T and L are not in the word.

Current constraints:
- Letters known to be in the word: A, O, N (and N is fixed in position 3).
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, S, E, T, L.
- Positions:
  - Position 3: N (fixed).
  - A is not in position 1 or 4.
  - O is not in position 2 or 3.

Possible positions for A: 2, 3, 5. But 3 is N, so A must be in 2 or 5.
Possible positions for O: 1, 4, 5 (cannot be 2 or 3).

Let’s try a word that:
- Keeps N in position 3.
- Places A in position 2 (since it can’t be 1 or 4).
- Places O in position 1 (since it can’t be 2 or 3).
- Uses new common letters for positions 4 and 5, avoiding forbidden letters (R,S,E,T,L).

Candidate: O A N _ _

Letters left to try: C, D, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Good consonants to test: C, D, G, H, M, P.

Let’s try “OAN” + “CH” → “OANCH” – but “OANCH” is not a valid word.

Try “OAN” + “IM” → “OANIM” – invalid.

Try “OAN” + “GO” → “OANGO” – invalid.

Instead, let’s try placing O in position 4 and A in position 5.

Structure: _ _ N O A

Valid word: “PHENO” – but E is forbidden.

“MONDO” – but O is in position 4 (allowed), but D is okay.

Wait, let’s try “CANON” – but N is already in position 3, and we can’t have two N’s unless it’s allowed (but we don’t know if N repeats).

Better: “HONDA” – but D and H are okay, and A is in position 5 (allowed), O in position 2 is forbidden (from tonal feedback), so O can’t be in 2.

Let’s try O in position 1, A in position 2, N in 3, and new letters for 4-5.

“O A N _ _”

Valid word: “OAN” + “IM” → “OANIM” – invalid.

“OAN” + “GO” → “OANGO” – invalid.

“OAN” + “CH” → “OANCH” – invalid.

Alternative: O in position 4, A in position 2, N in 3.

Structure: _ A N O _

Valid word: “P A N O ?” – “PANOR” – invalid (R forbidden).

“P A N O ?” – “PANIC” – C is okay, but A is in 2 (allowed), O in 4 (allowed), I in 5 (new), C in 5 (new).

But we need 5 letters, so “PANIC” fits: P A N I C.

Check constraints:
- N is in position 3: ✓.
- A is in position 2 (not 1 or 4): ✓.
- O is not in this word – but we know O must be in the word. So “PANIC” is invalid because it lacks O.

We must include O, A, N.

Let’s try O in position 5, A in position 2, N in 3.

Structure: _ A N _ O

Valid word: “C A N D O” – “CANDO” – not common.

“B A N K O” – B, K okay, but “BANKO” is not standard.

“M A N G O” – M, G okay, and “MANGO” is valid.

Check constraints:
- M, A, N, G, O.
- N is in position 3: ✓.
- A is in position 2 (not 1 or 4): ✓.
- O is in position 5 (not 2 or 3): ✓.
- No R, S, E, T, L: ✓.

Perfect.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: tonal -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(-) N(✓) A(-) L(x)
Guess 3: mango -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(✓) N(✓) G(x) O(✓)

From the latest feedback:

- M(x) → M is not in the word.
- A(✓) → A is in position 2 and is correct.
- N(✓) → N is in position 3 and is correct.
- G(x) → G is not in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in position 5 and is correct.

So the word has the fixed pattern:
_ A N _ O

Letters already ruled out: R, S, E, T, L, M, G.

Remaining unused common consonants: B, C, D, F, H, K, P, U, V, W, Y.

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 4, avoiding all forbidden letters.

Let’s list valid 5-letter words matching the pattern _ A N _ O:

- B A N A O – invalid (A already used in position 2).
- B A N D O – “BANDO” – not standard.
- B A N K O – “BANKO” – not standard.
- C A N C O – “CANCE” – invalid (E ruled out).
- C A N D O – “CANDO” – not standard.
- C A N H O – not a word.
- F A N G O – G ruled out.
- H A N D O – “MANDO” – no.
- P A N D O – “PANDO” – no.
- P A N I O – not a word.
- P A N D O – again, no.
- V A N E O – E ruled out.
- W A N D O – “WANDO” – no.
- Y A N C O – no.

Wait, let’s think of real words:

- “C A N A D O” – too long.
- “P A N D A” – ends wrong.
- “B A N J O” – J is unused, but “BANJO” is valid.

Check “BANJO”:
- B A N J O.
- Pattern _ A N _ O: yes, fits B A N J O.
- Letters: B, A, N, J, O.
- All letters are allowed (B, J not ruled out).
- It’s a valid English word.

Therefore, the next guess is “BANJO”.

Wait, let’s think of words ending in “…ANO”:

Actually, the word “CANNO” is not valid, but “CANON” has N twice. Let’s check:

“CANON”:
- C A N O N
- Pattern: _ A N _ O – yes, C A N O N
- Letters: C, A, N, O, N
- N is allowed to repeat? We don’t have info against it.
- C is allowed (not ruled out).
- A, N, O are already confirmed.
- “CANON” is a valid word.

Let’s try “CANON”.
