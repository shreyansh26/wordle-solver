For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use vowels and frequently occurring consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is a popular first choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and will likely reveal several letters that are in the word.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - also a good mix of common letters. However, I think AROSE is slightly better because it includes O which is very common in 5-letter words.

I'll go with AROSE as my first guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use vowels and frequently occurring consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is a popular first choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and will likely reveal several letters that are in the word.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - also a good mix of common letters. However, I think AROSE is slightly better because it includes O which is very common in 5-letter words.

I'll go with AROSE as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R(x): R is NOT in the word at all.
- O(x): O is NOT in the word at all.
- S(-): S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 4).
- E(-): E is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 5).

So the secret word:
- Contains A, S, E (but none of them are in their original positions).
- Does NOT contain R or O.

Next guess should:
1. Keep A, S, E (but place them in new positions).
2. Avoid R and O.
3. Introduce new common letters to test.

Possible positions for A, S, E:
- A can't be 1st → possible positions 2,3,4,5
- S can't be 4th → possible positions 1,2,3,5
- E can't be 5th → possible positions 1,2,3,4

Good new letters to test: T, N, L, I, C, etc.

A word that fits: ""STEAL""
- S in position 1 (new position)
- T (new letter)
- E in position 3 (new position)
- A in position 4 (new position)
- L (new letter)

This tests S, E, A in new spots and adds T and L.

What we know so far  
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, S, E (each has appeared with “-”, meaning they exist but are in wrong positions).  
- Letters that are NOT in the word: R, O, T, L.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, S, E exactly once each.
2. Does NOT contain R, O, T, L.
3. Places A, S, E in positions different from their previous guesses.

- A was 1st (AROSE) and 4th (STEAL) → cannot be 1 or 4.  
- S was 4th (AROSE) and 1st (STEAL) → cannot be 1 or 4.  
- E was 3rd (AROSE) and 3rd (STEAL) → cannot be 3.

Remaining common letters to test: I, N, C, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

A good candidate that satisfies all constraints:
- Uses A, S, E in allowed positions.
- Adds new common letters.

Let’s try “CANES”:
- C (new), A (allowed positions 2,3,5), N (new), E (allowed positions 1,2,4,5), S (allowed positions 2,3,5).

Check positions:
- A is 2nd (allowed).

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use vowels and frequently occurring consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is a popular first choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and will likely reveal several letters that are in the word.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - also a good mix of common letters. However, I think AROSE is slightly better because it includes O which is very common in 5-letter words.

I'll go with AROSE as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R(x): R is NOT in the word at all.
- O(x): O is NOT in the word at all.
- S(-): S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 4).
- E(-): E is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 5).

So the secret word:
- Contains A, S, E (but none of them are in their original positions).
- Does NOT contain R or O.

Next guess should:
1. Keep A, S, E (but place them in new positions).
2. Avoid R and O.
3. Introduce new common letters to test.

Possible positions for A, S, E:
- A can't be 1st → possible positions 2,3,4,5
- S can't be 4th → possible positions 1,2,3,5
- E can't be 5th → possible positions 1,2,3,4

Good new letters to test: T, N, L, I, C, etc.

A word that fits: ""STEAL""
- S in position 1 (new position)
- T (new letter)
- E in position 3 (new position)
- A in position 4 (new position)
- L (new letter)

This tests S, E, A in new spots and adds T and L.

Guess 2: STEAL -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) E(-) A(-) L(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: A R O S E  
Feedback: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)

Guess 2: S T E A L  
Feedback: S(-) T(x) E(-) A(-) L(x)

What we know so far  
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, S, E (each has appeared with “-”, meaning they exist but are in wrong positions).  
- Letters that are NOT in the word: R, O, T, L.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, S, E exactly once each.
2. Does NOT contain R, O, T, L.
3. Places A, S, E in positions different from their previous guesses.

Positions ruled out:
- A was 1st (AROSE) and 4th (STEAL) → cannot be 1 or 4.  
- S was 4th (AROSE) and 1st (STEAL) → cannot be 1 or 4.  
- E was 3rd (AROSE) and 3rd (STEAL) → cannot be 3.

Remaining common letters to test: I, N, C, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

A good candidate that satisfies all constraints:
- Uses A, S, E in allowed positions.
- Adds new common letters.

Let’s try “CANES”:
- C (new), A (allowed positions 2,3,5), N (new), E (allowed positions 1,2,4,5), S (allowed positions 2,3,5).

Check positions:
- A is 2nd (allowed).  
- E is 4th (allowed).  
- S is 5th (allowed).  

No disallowed letters (R,O,T,L) are used.

From the new feedback on CANES:

- N(-) → N is in the word but not in position 3.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 4.
- S(✓) → S is in the word and is in position 5.

So far we know:
Letters that are in the word: A, S, E (and now N).
Letters that are NOT in the word: R, O, T, L, C.

Positions locked:
- S is fixed at position 5.

Positions ruled out for the others:
- A cannot be 1, 2, 4 (from AROSE, STEAL, CANES).
- E cannot be 3, 4 (from AROSE, STEAL, CANES).
- N cannot be 3 (from CANES).

Remaining positions for A, E, N: 2, 3, 4 (but with exclusions above).

Possible placements:
- A can only be 2 or 3 or 5, but 5 is S, so 2 or 3.
- E can only be 2 (since 1,3,4 are excluded by earlier feedback).
- N can be 1, 2, 4, but 5 is S.

Let’s list possible words:
Since E cannot be 3 or 4, and must appear once, the only viable spot for E is position 2.  
Then A and N must occupy positions 1, 3, 4 (but A cannot be 4).  
Also, we need two new letters (since we already have A, S, E, N).  
Available common letters: D, I, M, P, U, B, G, H, etc.

Try “HEAPS”:
- H (new), E (position 2), A (position 3), P (new), S (position 5).
Check constraints:
- Contains A, S, E, N? No N → invalid.

Try “PEANS”:
- P (new), E (position 2), A (position 3), N (position 4), S (position 5).
Check:
- Contains A, S, E, N → yes.
- Letters used: P, E, A, N, S → no forbidden letters.
- Positions:
  - A is 3 (allowed, not excluded).
  - E is 2 (allowed).
  - N is 4 (allowed).
  - S is 5 (fixed).
  - P is new.

This fits all constraints.
