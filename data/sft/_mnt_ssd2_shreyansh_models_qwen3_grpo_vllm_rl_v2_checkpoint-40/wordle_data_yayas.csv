### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. Some popular choices include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage across different letter positions.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: R, O, E, L, N, T  
2. Letters that ARE in the word: A, S  
   - A is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 3.  
   - S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4.  

So the hidden word:
- contains both A and S exactly once each  
- excludes R, O, E, L, N, T  
- A cannot be in slot 1 or 3  
- S cannot be in slot 1 or 4  

Remaining common consonants that have not been ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y  
Vowels still possible: I, U (A is already known to appear)

Let’s look for a 5-letter word that uses A and S in allowed positions and only the still-possible letters.

Candidate positions for A: 2, 4, 5  
Candidate positions for S: 2, 3, 5  

A quick scan yields “S” in position 2 and “A” in position 4 as a promising pattern, e.g.,  
S _ A _ _  

Filling the blanks with common remaining letters that haven’t been eliminated and don’t repeat:  
S I A C K  → “SIACK” is not a valid English word.  
S P A C K  → “SPACK” is not valid.  
S W A I R  → “SWAIR” is not valid and contains R (eliminated).  

Try swapping positions:  
A S _ _ _  → but A cannot be first.  

Another pattern: _ A _ S _  
C A R S E → invalid (R, E).  

Eventually we land on:  
C A P S I  → “CAPSI” is not valid.  
B A S I C  → “BASIC” uses B, A, S, I, C — all still allowed letters, and satisfies:  
- A in position 2 (allowed)  
- S in position 3 (allowed)  
- letters B, I, C have not been ruled out.

Therefore, “BASIC” is a valid and informative next guess.

Therefore, “BASIC” is a valid and informative next guess.

From the three rounds we now have:

Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E, L, N, T, B, I, C  
Letters definitely IN the word: A, S  

Positions we have learned so far:
- A is in the word and is in position 2 (from BASIC: A(✓)).
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from AROSE: S(-) at pos 4; SLANT: S(-) at pos 1; BASIC: S(-) at pos 3).  
  Therefore S must be in position 5.

So the hidden word looks like: _ A _ _ S, with the constraints:
- Only letters not yet ruled out are allowed: A, S, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y (and A, S already placed).
- No repeats of letters already excluded.

We need three more distinct letters (positions 1, 3, 4) chosen from the still-allowed set.

A quick check of common English words fitting _ A _ _ S:
- DASHS – invalid (double S, not common)
- HAMPS – not a word
- GAVES – contains E (ruled out)
- PAPAS – contains P twice (allowed, but still a guess)
- DAWNS – contains N (ruled out)
- MAMAS – contains M twice
- FUMES – contains E
- KAPUS – not a word
- WAFER – contains E
- HAKKS – not a word
- VAPID – ends in D, not S
- PAPAS – already noted
- DAKIS – not a word
- GAVAS – not common
- MAMAS – already noted
- PAPAS – already noted

A valid word that fits is “PAPAS” (though it repeats P), but we can do better with a word that introduces new letters without repeats.

Another candidate: “HAKKS” – not valid.

Wait, let’s list all valid 5-letter words ending in S with A in position 2 and no banned letters:
- DASHS – invalid
- HAMPS – invalid
- PAPAS – valid, but repeats P
- MAMAS – repeats M
- KAPUS – invalid
- GAVAS – invalid
- FUMES – invalid
- VAPID – ends in D
- WAFER – ends in R (invalid)
- DAWNS – invalid
- MAMAS – already noted

Actually, “PAPAS” is the only common word fitting _ A _ _ S with allowed letters. However, we can also consider “HAKKS” if we allow less common words, but it’s not valid.

Rechecking: we have letters D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y available.

A valid word: “HAKKS” – not valid.

Another valid word: “GAVAS” – not valid.

Another: “VAMPS” – contains M, P, V – all allowed, and is a valid word.

Let’s check “VAMPS”:
- V A M P S
- A is in position 2 (✓)
- S is in position 5 (✓)
- Letters V, M, P are all still allowed (not ruled out)
- No banned letters
- No repeats of already excluded letters

Therefore, “VAMPS” is a valid and informative next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. Some popular choices include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage across different letter positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains A and S, but not R, O, or E.
- A is not in position 1, and S is not in position 4.

Letters to include: A, S
Letters to exclude: R, O, E
Positions to avoid: A≠1, S≠4

Common 5-letter words with A and S but without R, O, E:
- SLANT (but has N and T, which weren't tested yet)
- STAND (but has N and D)
- SALTY (but has L, T, Y)
- SWASH (but has W and H)
- STASH (but has T, H)

Looking for a word that places A and S in new positions and introduces new common letters (like T, N, L, I):
- SLANT: S(1) L(2) A(3) N(4) T(5) - A is in position 3 (allowed), S is in position 1 (allowed), introduces L, N, T.
- STAND: S(1) T(2) A(3) N(4) D(5) - same idea.

I'll choose SLANT as it tests new positions for A and S and introduces L, N, T.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: R, O, E, L, N, T  
2. Letters that ARE in the word: A, S  
   - A is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 3.  
   - S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4.  

So the hidden word:
- contains both A and S exactly once each  
- excludes R, O, E, L, N, T  
- A cannot be in slot 1 or 3  
- S cannot be in slot 1 or 4  

Remaining common consonants that have not been ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y  
Vowels still possible: I, U (A is already known to appear)

Let’s look for a 5-letter word that uses A and S in allowed positions and only the still-possible letters.

Candidate positions for A: 2, 4, 5  
Candidate positions for S: 2, 3, 5  

A quick scan yields “S” in position 2 and “A” in position 4 as a promising pattern, e.g.,  
S _ A _ _  

Filling the blanks with common remaining letters that haven’t been eliminated and don’t repeat:  
S I A C K  → “SIACK” is not a valid English word.  
S P A C K  → “SPACK” is not valid.  
S W A I R  → “SWAIR” is not valid and contains R (eliminated).  

Try swapping positions:  
A S _ _ _  → but A cannot be first.  

Another pattern: _ A _ S _  
C A R S E → invalid (R, E).  

Eventually we land on:  
C A P S I  → “CAPSI” is not valid.  
B A S I C  → “BASIC” uses B, A, S, I, C — all still allowed letters, and satisfies:  
- A in position 2 (allowed)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. Some popular choices include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage across different letter positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains A and S, but not R, O, or E.
- A is not in position 1, and S is not in position 4.

Letters to include: A, S
Letters to exclude: R, O, E
Positions to avoid: A≠1, S≠4

Common 5-letter words with A and S but without R, O, E:
- SLANT (but has N and T, which weren't tested yet)
- STAND (but has N and D)
- SALTY (but has L, T, Y)
- SWASH (but has W and H)
- STASH (but has T, H)

Looking for a word that places A and S in new positions and introduces new common letters (like T, N, L, I):
- SLANT: S(1) L(2) A(3) N(4) T(5) - A is in position 3 (allowed), S is in position 1 (allowed), introduces L, N, T.
- STAND: S(1) T(2) A(3) N(4) D(5) - same idea.

I'll choose SLANT as it tests new positions for A and S and introduces L, N, T.

Guess 2: SLANT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(x)

<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: R, O, E, L, N, T  
2. Letters that ARE in the word: A, S  
   - A is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 3.  
   - S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4.  

So the hidden word:
- contains both A and S exactly once each  
- excludes R, O, E, L, N, T  
- A cannot be in slot 1 or 3  
- S cannot be in slot 1 or 4  

Remaining common consonants that have not been ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y  
Vowels still possible: I, U (A is already known to appear)

Let’s look for a 5-letter word that uses A and S in allowed positions and only the still-possible letters.

Candidate positions for A: 2, 4, 5  
Candidate positions for S: 2, 3, 5  

A quick scan yields “S” in position 2 and “A” in position 4 as a promising pattern, e.g.,  
S _ A _ _  

Filling the blanks with common remaining letters that haven’t been eliminated and don’t repeat:  
S I A C K  → “SIACK” is not a valid English word.  
S P A C K  → “SPACK” is not valid.  
S W A I R  → “SWAIR” is not valid and contains R (eliminated).  

Try swapping positions:  
A S _ _ _  → but A cannot be first.  

Another pattern: _ A _ S _  
C A R S E → invalid (R, E).  

Eventually we land on:  
C A P S I  → “CAPSI” is not valid.  
B A S I C  → “BASIC” uses B, A, S, I, C — all still allowed letters, and satisfies:  
- A in position 2 (allowed)  
- S in position 3 (allowed)  
- letters B, I, C have not been ruled out.

Therefore, “BASIC” is a valid and informative next guess.

From the three rounds we now have:

Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E, L, N, T, B, I, C  
Letters definitely IN the word: A, S  

Positions we have learned so far:
- A is in the word and is in position 2 (from BASIC: A(✓)).
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from AROSE: S(-) at pos 4; SLANT: S(-) at pos 1; BASIC: S(-) at pos 3).  
  Therefore S must be in position 5.

So the hidden word looks like: _ A _ _ S, with the constraints:
- Only letters not yet ruled out are allowed: A, S, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y (and A, S already placed).
- No repeats of letters already excluded.

We need three more distinct letters (positions 1, 3, 4) chosen from the still-allowed set.

A quick check of common English words fitting _ A _ _ S:
- DASHS – invalid (double S, not common)
- HAMPS – not a word
- GAVES – contains E (ruled out)
- PAPAS – contains P twice (allowed, but still a guess)
- DAWNS – contains N (ruled out)
- MAMAS – contains M twice
- FUMES – contains E
- KAPUS – not a word
- WAFER – contains E
- HAKKS – not a word
- VAPID – ends in D, not S
- PAPAS – already noted
- DAKIS – not a word
- GAVAS – not common
- MAMAS – already noted
- PAPAS – already noted

A valid word that fits is “PAPAS” (though it repeats P), but we can do better with a word that introduces new letters without repeats.

Another candidate: “HAKKS” – not valid.

Wait, let’s list all valid 5-letter words ending in S with A in position 2 and no banned letters:
- DASHS – invalid
- HAMPS – invalid
- PAPAS – valid, but repeats P
- MAMAS – repeats M
- KAPUS – invalid
- GAVAS – invalid
- FUMES – invalid
- VAPID – ends in D
- WAFER – ends in R (invalid)
- DAWNS – invalid
- MAMAS – already noted

Actually, “PAPAS” is the only common word fitting _ A _ _ S with allowed letters. However, we can also consider “HAKKS” if we allow less common words, but it’s not valid.

Rechecking: we have letters D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y available.

A valid word: “HAKKS” – not valid.

Another valid word: “GAVAS” – not valid.

Another: “VAMPS” – contains M, P, V – all allowed, and is a valid word.

Let’s check “VAMPS”:
- V A M P S
- A is in position 2 (✓)
- S is in position 5 (✓)
- Letters V, M, P are all still allowed (not ruled out)
- No banned letters
- No repeats of already excluded letters

Therefore, “VAMPS” is a valid and informative next guess.

We now have five rounds of feedback and have locked in:

- Pattern: _ A _ _ S  
- Positions 2 = A, 5 = S are fixed.  
- Letters ruled out so far: R, O, E, L, N, T, B, I, C, V, M, P, D, W, G  
- Still-allowed letters for positions 1, 3, 4: F, H, K, U, Y  

We need a 5-letter English word that:
1. Has A in position 2 and S in position 5.  
2. Uses only the letters F, H, K, U, Y in positions 1, 3, 4.  
3. Is a valid English word.

Let’s list all possible combinations of the remaining letters in the three open slots:

Positions: 1   3   4  
Letters:   F/H/K/U/Y  F/H/K/U/Y  F/H/K/U/Y  

We need to pick one letter for each position (can repeat unless the word forbids it) and check if the resulting word is valid.

Candidate words:
- F A H U S → FAHUS (not a valid word)  
- F A H K S → FAHKS (invalid)  
- F A K H S → FAHKS (invalid)

     - Y A H K S → YAHKS (invalid)  
     - Y A K F S → YAKFS (invalid)  
     - Y A K H S → YAKHS (invalid)  

None of these combinations form a valid English word. This suggests we may have missed a letter or need to reconsider. However, we have exhausted all combinations with the remaining letters.

Upon reflection, the only valid English word that fits the pattern _ A _ _ S and uses the remaining letters is:

- H A U K S → HAUKS (valid, though rare; plural of hawk)

Let’s verify:
- H A U K S  
- A in position 2 (✓)  
- S in position 5 (✓)  
- Letters H, U, K have not been ruled out.

Therefore, HAUKS is the correct next guess.
