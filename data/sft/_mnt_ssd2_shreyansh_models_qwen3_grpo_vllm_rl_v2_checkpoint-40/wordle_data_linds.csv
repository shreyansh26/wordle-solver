For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in 5-letter English words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these common letters as possible without repeating any. 

Looking at these letters, a strong candidate is ""AROSE"" because it contains A, R, O, S, and E - five very common letters that appear frequently in English words. This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down the possibilities.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in 5-letter English words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these common letters as possible without repeating any. 

Looking at these letters, a strong candidate is ""AROSE"" because it contains A, R, O, S, and E - five very common letters that appear frequently in English words. This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down the possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter S, but NOT in the 4th position (since S was in position 4 in AROSE and marked wrong position).
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S (and S cannot be in position 4).
2. Avoids A, R, O, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters: T, L, N, I, D, U, C, M, P, Y, etc.

A strong candidate is ""SUNTIL"" but that has 6 letters. A valid 5-letter word is ""SUNNY"" but it has two N's and Y. Another is ""STING"" - but it has A,R,O,E excluded and S not in 4th. Wait, STING has S in 1st, T, I, N, G. None of A,R,O,E. S is in 1st (not 4th), so this is valid.

But let's think of better coverage. ""STUMP"" - S, T, U, M, P. All good letters, no A,R,O,E, S not in 4th. Or ""SLANT"" - but has A. ""SLUMP"" - has U, L, M, P. 

""STUMP"" seems good - S, T, U, M, P. All new letters, S in 1st (not 4th), no forbidden letters.

From the two guesses we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, U, M, P.
2. Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: S (from both guesses, but never in position 1 or 4).

So the word contains S somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5.

Remaining common letters not yet tried: D, L, N, I, C, G, H, K, Y, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S exactly once, in position 2, 3, or 5.
- Uses only letters from the remaining pool (no A, R, O, E, T, U, M, P).

A good candidate is ""SINUS"" but it has two S's, which is inefficient. Instead, ""SINUS"" is out.

Better: ""SING"" is 4 letters. Need 5.

Consider ""SINDH"" – but H hasn't been tested and it's a proper noun.

""SNICK"" – has C, N, I, K. All allowed letters, S in position 1 (forbidden) – no.

""SNIFF"" – S in 1 (forbidden) – no.

""SLING"" – S in 1 (forbidden) – no.

""SWISH"" – too long.

""WISPS"" – S in 5, which is allowed. Letters: W, I, S, P, S – but P is forbidden and two S's.

""DISKS"" – S in 5, letters D, I, S, K, S – two S's.

""VISIT"" – T is forbidden.

""SYNCH"" – C, H, S, Y, N – all allowed. S in position 3 – allowed.

""SYNCH"" is a valid 5-letter word (short for synchronize or synchro). It uses S in position 3, and introduces Y, N, C, H – all new and allowed.

Therefore, ""SYNCH"" is a strong next guess.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in 5-letter English words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these common letters as possible without repeating any. 

Looking at these letters, a strong candidate is ""AROSE"" because it contains A, R, O, S, and E - five very common letters that appear frequently in English words. This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down the possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter S, but NOT in the 4th position (since S was in position 4 in AROSE and marked wrong position).
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S (and S cannot be in position 4).
2. Avoids A, R, O, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters: T, L, N, I, D, U, C, M, P, Y, etc.

A strong candidate is ""SUNTIL"" but that has 6 letters. A valid 5-letter word is ""SUNNY"" but it has two N's and Y. Another is ""STING"" - but it has A,R,O,E excluded and S not in 4th. Wait, STING has S in 1st, T, I, N, G. None of A,R,O,E. S is in 1st (not 4th), so this is valid.

But let's think of better coverage. ""STUMP"" - S, T, U, M, P. All good letters, no A,R,O,E, S not in 4th. Or ""SLANT"" - but has A. ""SLUMP"" - has U, L, M, P. 

""STUMP"" seems good - S, T, U, M, P. All new letters, S in 1st (not 4th), no forbidden letters.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STUMP -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) U(x) M(x) P(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, U, M, P.
2. Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: S (from both guesses, but never in position 1 or 4).

So the word contains S somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5.

Remaining common letters not yet tried: D, L, N, I, C, G, H, K, Y, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S exactly once, in position 2, 3, or 5.
- Uses only letters from the remaining pool (no A, R, O, E, T, U, M, P).

A good candidate is ""SINUS"" but it has two S's, which is inefficient. Instead, ""SINUS"" is out.

Better: ""SING"" is 4 letters. Need 5.

Consider ""SINDH"" – but H hasn't been tested and it's a proper noun.

""SNICK"" – has C, N, I, K. All allowed letters, S in position 1 (forbidden) – no.

""SNIFF"" – S in 1 (forbidden) – no.

""SLING"" – S in 1 (forbidden) – no.

""SWISH"" – too long.

""WISPS"" – S in 5, which is allowed. Letters: W, I, S, P, S – but P is forbidden and two S's.

""DISKS"" – S in 5, letters D, I, S, K, S – two S's.

""VISIT"" – T is forbidden.

""SYNCH"" – C, H, S, Y, N – all allowed. S in position 3 – allowed.

""SYNCH"" is a valid 5-letter word (short for synchronize or synchro). It uses S in position 3, and introduces Y, N, C, H – all new and allowed.

Therefore, ""SYNCH"" is a strong next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Current known facts:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, U, M, P, Y, C, H.
- Letters known to be in the word: S, N.
- S must be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (cannot be 1 or 4).
- N is in position 3 (✓).

So the word pattern is: _ _ N _ _ with S somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5. But position 3 is already N, so S must be in position 2 or 5.

Possible patterns:
1. _ S N _ _
2. _ _ N _ S

Letters still allowed: D, L, I, G, K, B, F, V, W, etc. (all letters not yet ruled out).

We need a valid 5-letter word fitting one of these patterns. Let's think of possibilities:

Pattern 1: _ S N _ _
- SNIDE: but I and D are allowed, E is forbidden.
- SNUGS: G allowed, U and G allowed, but U is forbidden.
- SNIPS: P is forbidden.
- SNACK: C and K allowed, but C is forbidden.
- SNICK: C is forbidden.

Pattern 2: _ _ N _ S
- WINDS: W, I, N, D, S – all allowed letters, fits _ _ N _ S.
- BINGO: O is forbidden.
- FISTS: T is forbidden.
- DINGO: O is forbidden.
- LINDS: not a valid word.
- WINDS is valid and fits perfectly.

Therefore, ""WINDS"" is a strong next guess.

Guess 4: WINDS -> FEEDBACK: W(x) I(✓) N(✓) D(✓) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on WINDS we now know:

- W is NOT in the word (x).
- I is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → position 2.
- N is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → position 3.
- D is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → position 4.
- S is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → position 5.

So the word pattern is: _ I N D S.

The only letter left is the first letter. From previous feedback, the letters that are NOT in the word are: A, R, O, E, T, U, M, P, Y, C, H, W. The remaining letters that can be in position 1 are: B, F, G, K, L, V, etc.

Looking for 5-letter words that fit the pattern _ I N D S, the most common one is ""BINDS"" (but B is allowed). However, ""BINDS"" is a valid word and fits the pattern. Let's check if B has been ruled out - it hasn't been used or mentioned, so it's possible.

Therefore, the secret word is likely ""BINDS"".
