### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these as possible without repeating letters. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us 5 distinct letters that are all high-frequency in 5-letter words. This should provide good coverage for the first guess to help narrow down possibilities.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E somewhere, but NOT in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S and E in different positions than 4 and 5.
2. Avoids A, R, O entirely.
3. Uses other common letters not yet ruled out.

Letters I can use: S, E, T, N, I, L, C, D, P, U, Y, etc. (excluding A, R, O).

Good candidates:
- STEIN: Uses S (position 1), E (position 2), and common letters T, I, N.
- SPEND: Uses S (position 1), E (position 2), and common letters P, N, D.
- SENT/SLEET: Uses S and E, but SENT is only 4 letters, and SLEET has E in position 5 (same as before), which is invalid.

STEIN seems like a strong choice as it introduces new common letters T, I, N while repositioning S and E.

From all feedback so far:

   – C, L, P are out.  
   – S is now fixed in position 5.  
   – E is not in position 1.

Known facts:
- Word ends in S (position 5).  
- Letters still allowed: D, G, H, U, Y, M, B, F, K, V, W, plus the remaining vowel U.  
- E is somewhere in positions 2 or 4 (cannot be 1, 3, 5).  
- S is in position 5.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ S, with E in 2 or 4, and no A, R, O, T, I, N, C, L, P.

Possible letters for the remaining three positions: D, G, H, U, Y, M, B, F, K, V, W, U.

  Candidate: H U M E S → HUMES (valid)  
  Candidate: B U D E S → Budes (valid, but rare)  
  Candidate: G U D E S → Gudes (valid, but rare)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these as possible without repeating letters. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us 5 distinct letters that are all high-frequency in 5-letter words. This should provide good coverage for the first guess to help narrow down possibilities.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E somewhere, but NOT in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S and E in different positions than 4 and 5.
2. Avoids A, R, O entirely.
3. Uses other common letters not yet ruled out.

Letters I can use: S, E, T, N, I, L, C, D, P, U, Y, etc. (excluding A, R, O).

Good candidates:
- STEIN: Uses S (position 1), E (position 2), and common letters T, I, N.
- SPEND: Uses S (position 1), E (position 2), and common letters P, N, D.
- SENT/SLEET: Uses S and E, but SENT is only 4 letters, and SLEET has E in position 5 (same as before), which is invalid.

STEIN seems like a strong choice as it introduces new common letters T, I, N while repositioning S and E.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STEIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) E(-) I(x) N(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - A, R, O are out.
   - S is somewhere, but not in position 4.
   - E is somewhere, but not in position 5.

2. STEIN → S(-) T(x) E(-) I(x) N(x)
   - T, I, N are out.
   - S is not in position 1.
   - E is not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: S, E
- Letters definitely out: A, R, O, T, I, N
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
- E cannot be in positions 3 or 5.

Remaining common consonants: D, L, C, P, U, Y, M, H, G, B, F, K, V, W
Remaining vowels: U (since A, O, I, E are accounted for)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S and E
- Uses none of A, R, O, T, I, N
- S must be in positions 2, 3, or 5
- E must be in positions 1, 2, or 4

Let’s look for a word that fits:
- E can be first, second, or fourth
- S can be second, third, or fifth
- Other letters must come from the remaining pool

Candidate words:
- ESDY → has an S and E, but S is in position 3 (allowed), E in position 1 (allowed). Uses D, Y (both still possible).
- SPUME → S in 1 (invalid, already ruled out), so skip.
- DUSEL → S in 3 (ok), E in 4 (ok), uses D, U, L (all still possible).
- ECLPS → S in 5 (ok), E in 1 (ok), uses C, L, P (all still possible).

ECLPS looks good: C, L, P are all still possible, and it places S in position 5 (allowed) and E in position 1 (allowed).

- Letters still allowed: D, G, H, U, Y, M, B, F, K, V, W, plus the remaining vowel U.  
- E is somewhere in positions 2 or 4 (cannot be 1, 3, 5).  
- S is in position 5.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ S, with E in 2 or 4, and no A, R, O, T, I, N, C, L, P.

Possible letters for the remaining three positions: D, G, H, U, Y, M, B, F, K, V, W, U.

Let’s try:
- E in position 2: _ E _ _ S  
  Candidate: D E _ _ S → DEGS? (invalid)  
  B E _ _ S → BEGS? (invalid)  
  M E _ _ S → MEWS? (invalid)  
  H E _ _ S → HEWS? (invalid)  
  G E _ _ S → GEWS? (invalid)

- E in position 4: _ _ _ E S  
  Candidate: D U M E S → DEMES (valid word, but rare)  
  Candidate: H U M E S → HUMES (valid)  
  Candidate: B U D E S → Budes (valid, but rare)  
  Candidate: G U D E S → Gudes (valid, but rare)

Among these, HUMES is a common enough word and fits all constraints:
- Ends in S (position 5).  
- Contains E in position 4 (allowed).  
- Uses letters not yet ruled out: H, U, M, E, S.  
- No forbidden letters.

So I’ll guess HUMES.

We still need to place H and U in the remaining three positions (1, 2, 3, 4), plus one more letter that must be from the still-allowed letters: D, G, K, Y, B, F, V, W, etc.

Wait, let’s try placing E in position 2 and see if we can form a word.

None of these are valid 5-letter words.

Hudes is actually a valid 5-letter word (plural of dude).

Check constraints:
- Hudes:  
  – Ends in S (✓)  
  – E in position 4 (allowed)  
  – H in position 1 (allowed, since H was marked “-” in position 1 in HUMES)  
  – U in position 2 (allowed, since U was marked “-” in position 2 in HUMES)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these as possible without repeating letters. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us 5 distinct letters that are all high-frequency in 5-letter words. This should provide good coverage for the first guess to help narrow down possibilities.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E somewhere, but NOT in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S and E in different positions than 4 and 5.
2. Avoids A, R, O entirely.
3. Uses other common letters not yet ruled out.

Letters I can use: S, E, T, N, I, L, C, D, P, U, Y, etc. (excluding A, R, O).

Good candidates:
- STEIN: Uses S (position 1), E (position 2), and common letters T, I, N.
- SPEND: Uses S (position 1), E (position 2), and common letters P, N, D.
- SENT/SLEET: Uses S and E, but SENT is only 4 letters, and SLEET has E in position 5 (same as before), which is invalid.

STEIN seems like a strong choice as it introduces new common letters T, I, N while repositioning S and E.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STEIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) E(-) I(x) N(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - A, R, O are out.
   - S is somewhere, but not in position 4.
   - E is somewhere, but not in position 5.

2. STEIN → S(-) T(x) E(-) I(x) N(x)
   - T, I, N are out.
   - S is not in position 1.
   - E is not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: S, E
- Letters definitely out: A, R, O, T, I, N
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
- E cannot be in positions 3 or 5.

Remaining common consonants: D, L, C, P, U, Y, M, H, G, B, F, K, V, W
Remaining vowels: U (since A, O, I, E are accounted for)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S and E
- Uses none of A, R, O, T, I, N
- S must be in positions 2, 3, or 5
- E must be in positions 1, 2, or 4

Let’s look for a word that fits:
- E can be first, second, or fourth
- S can be second, third, or fifth
- Other letters must come from the remaining pool

Candidate words:
- ESDY → has an S and E, but S is in position 3 (allowed), E in position 1 (allowed). Uses D, Y (both still possible).
- SPUME → S in 1 (invalid, already ruled out), so skip.
- DUSEL → S in 3 (ok), E in 4 (ok), uses D, U, L (all still possible).
- ECLPS → S in 5 (ok), E in 1 (ok), uses C, L, P (all still possible).

ECLPS looks good: C, L, P are all still possible, and it places S in position 5 (allowed) and E in position 1 (allowed).

Guess 3: ECLPS -> FEEDBACK: E(-) C(x) L(x) P(x) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   – A, R, O are out.  
   – S is in the word, but not in position 4.  
   – E is in the word, but not in position 5.

2. STEIN → S(-) T(x) E(-) I(x) N(x)
   – T, I, N are out.  
   – S is not in position 1.  
   – E is not in position 3.

3. ECLPS → E(-) C(x) L(x) P(x) S(✓)
   – C, L, P are out.  
   – S is now fixed in position 5.  
   – E is not in position 1.

Known facts:
- Word ends in S (position 5).  
- Letters still allowed: D, G, H, U, Y, M, B, F, K, V, W, plus the remaining vowel U.  
- E is somewhere in positions 2 or 4 (cannot be 1, 3, 5).  
- S is in position 5.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ S, with E in 2 or 4, and no A, R, O, T, I, N, C, L, P.

Possible letters for the remaining three positions: D, G, H, U, Y, M, B, F, K, V, W, U.

Let’s try:
- E in position 2: _ E _ _ S  
  Candidate: D E _ _ S → DEGS? (invalid)  
  B E _ _ S → BEGS? (invalid)  
  M E _ _ S → MEWS? (invalid)  
  H E _ _ S → HEWS? (invalid)  
  G E _ _ S → GEWS? (invalid)

- E in position 4: _ _ _ E S  
  Candidate: D U M E S → DEMES (valid word, but rare)  
  Candidate: H U M E S → HUMES (valid)  
  Candidate: B U D E S → Budes (valid, but rare)  
  Candidate: G U D E S → Gudes (valid, but rare)

Among these, HUMES is a common enough word and fits all constraints:
- Ends in S (position 5).  
- Contains E in position 4 (allowed).  
- Uses letters not yet ruled out: H, U, M, E, S.  
- No forbidden letters.

So I’ll guess HUMES.

So current constraints:
- Word ends with S (position 5).  
- Letters in the word: S, E, H, U.  
- Letters ruled out: A, R, O, T, I, N, C, L, P, M.  
- Positions known:

  – H must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4 (cannot be 5, already S).  
  – U must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4 (cannot be 5, already S).

Possible positions:
- If E is in 2: _ E _ _ S  
- If E is in 4: _ _ _ E S  

We still need to place H and U in the remaining three positions (1, 2, 3, 4), plus one more letter that must be from the still-allowed letters: D, G, K, Y, B, F, V, W, etc.

     – _ E H U S → D E H U S (DEHUS – invalid)  
   – No valid 5-letter words here.

Wait, let’s try placing E in position 2 and see if we can form a word.

Pattern: _ E _ _ S  
We have H and U left to place in 1, 3, 4.  
Need a 5-letter word:  
- _ E _ _ S  
- with H, U, and one more allowed letter (D, G, K, Y, B, F, V, W).  

Possible word:  
- D E H U S → DEHUS (invalid)  
- D E U H S → DEUHS (invalid)  
- D E _ U S → D E G U S (DEGUS – invalid)  
- D E _ H U → D E G H U (DEGHS – invalid)  
- U E D H S → UEDHS (invalid)  
- U E H D S → UEHD S (invalid)  

None of these are valid 5-letter words.

Let’s try E in position 4:  
Pattern: _ _ _ E S  
We have H and U to place in 1, 2, 3.  
Need a 5-letter word:  
- H U _ E S → H U D E S (Hudes – plural of dude, valid)  
- U H D E S (invalid)  
- H _ U E S → H D U E S (invalid)  
- U _ H E S → U D H E S (invalid)  

Hudes is actually a valid 5-letter word (plural of dude).

Check constraints:
- Hudes:  
  – Ends in S (✓)  
  – E in position 4 (allowed)  
  – H in position 1 (allowed, since H was marked “-” in position 1 in HUMES)  
  – U in position 2 (allowed, since U was marked “-” in position 2 in HUMES)  
  – D is a new allowed letter.  
  – No forbidden letters.

Therefore, Hudes satisfies all current constraints.
