For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another strong option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- R(x) – R is NOT in the word.

- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 4th).

So the secret word contains the letters O, S, and E, but none of A or R. The O, S, and E must appear somewhere in the 1st, 2nd, or 4th/5th positions (since they were marked wrong-position).

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses O, S, and E exactly once each (they were only marked “in word” once).
- Does NOT use A or R.
- Places O, S, E in different positions from their original spots.

A good candidate is “HOUSE”:
- Uses O, S, E.
- Places O in the 2nd position (was 3rd).
- Places S in the 3rd position (was 4th).
- Places E in the 5th position (was 5th) – this would actually keep E in the same position, which is invalid since it was marked wrong-position.

- Uses O, S, E.
- Places O in 1st (was 3rd), S in 2nd (was 4th), E in 4th (was 5th).

Let me double-check:
- O is now in 1st (was 3rd) – ok.

- Places E in the 5th position (was 5th) – this would actually keep E in the same position, which is invalid since it was marked wrong-position.

Next candidate: “POSED”
- Uses O, S, E.
- Places O in 1st (was 3rd), S in 2nd (was 4th), E in 4th (was 5th).
- Does not use A or R.
This seems valid.

Let me double-check:
- O is now in 1st (was 3rd) – ok.
- S is now in 2nd (was 4th) – ok.
- E is now in 4th (was 5th) – ok.
- No A or R – ok.

“POSED” is a valid guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: POSED -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on POSED:
- P(x) – P is NOT in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word AND in the correct position (now 2nd).
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (was 3rd).
- E(✓) – E is in the word AND in the correct position (now 4th).
- D(x) – D is NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: O (2nd), E (4th), S (somewhere else).
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, P, D.
- S must be in the 1st, 3rd, or 5th position (it was 3rd in POSED and now needs to move).

Also, we still have to place the letters O, S, E somewhere in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th. We know:
- 2nd = O
- 4th = E

So the word looks like: _ O _ E _ with S somewhere else.

Possible positions for S: 1st, 3rd, or 5th.

Let’s try a word that:
- Keeps O in 2nd and E in 4th.
- Moves S to 1st position.
- Uses new letters for the remaining spots (avoiding A, R, P, D).

A good candidate is “SOBER”:
- S in 1st (was 3rd in POSED, so valid).
- O in 2nd (matches ✓).
- B and R: but R was already ruled out in Guess 1 (AROSE), so SOBER is invalid because of R.

Next candidate: “SLOPE”:
- S in 1st.
- L and P: but P was ruled out, so invalid.

Next: “SMOKE”:
- S in 1st.
- M, K new letters.
- O and E already placed.

This seems valid:
- S in 1st (was 3rd before).
- O in 2nd (✓).
- M new.
- K new.
- E in 4th (✓).

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

Letters we have ruled out: A, R, P, D, M  
Letters we know are in the word: O, S, E, K  
Correct positions we have learned:  
- O is NOT in position 3 (from AROSE) and NOT in position 2 (from POSED) – wait, POSED said O(✓) which means O is in the correct position, so O is definitely in position 2.  
- E is NOT in position 5 (from AROSE) and NOT in position 4 (from POSED) – but POSED said E(✓), so E is definitely in position 4.  
- S is NOT in position 3 (from POSED) and NOT in position 1 (from SMOKE), so S must be in position 5.  
- K is in the word but in the wrong position (from SMOKE), so K is somewhere else.

So far the word looks like:  
_ O _ E S  

And we still have to place K somewhere in the remaining slots 1 or 3 (since 5 is taken by S).

Letters we can still use: any consonant or vowel except A, R, P, D, M.

Let’s try a word that fits:  
K O _ E S  

The blank must be a letter not yet used and not in {A, R, P, D, M}.  
A common letter that fits is “L”, giving “K O L E S”.  
But “KOLES” is not a valid English word.  
Next, “K O N E S” gives “KONES” – also invalid.  
“K O B E S” gives “KOBE S” – invalid.  

Let’s flip: _ O K E S  
Then the first letter must be a valid consonant not yet used.  
“W” gives “W O K E S” – invalid.  
“F” gives “F O K E S” – invalid.  
“H” gives “H O K E S” – invalid.

“H” gives “H O S E K” – invalid.  
“W” gives “W O S E K” – invalid.  
“F” gives “F O S E K” – invalid.

“L” gives “K O L E S” – invalid.  
“N” gives “K O N E S” – invalid.  
“G” gives “K O G E S” – invalid.

“H” gives “H O K E S” – invalid.  
“W” gives “W O K E S” – invalid.  
“F” gives “F O K E S” – invalid.  

Wait, we missed one more possibility: the word could have extra consonants.  
But we know from feedback that S, K, and O/E placements are limited.  
Let me list valid 5-letter words matching “_ O _ E S” with K somewhere and no A, R, P, D, M.

Valid English word: “WOKES” – but W is allowed.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another strong option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- R(x) – R is NOT in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 3rd).
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 4th).
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 5th).

So the secret word contains the letters O, S, and E, but none of A or R. The O, S, and E must appear somewhere in the 1st, 2nd, or 4th/5th positions (since they were marked wrong-position).

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses O, S, and E exactly once each (they were only marked “in word” once).
- Does NOT use A or R.
- Places O, S, E in different positions from their original spots.

A good candidate is “HOUSE”:
- Uses O, S, E.
- Places O in the 2nd position (was 3rd).
- Places S in the 3rd position (was 4th).
- Places E in the 5th position (was 5th) – this would actually keep E in the same position, which is invalid since it was marked wrong-position.

Next candidate: “POSED”
- Uses O, S, E.

- O is now in 1st (was 3rd) – ok.
- S is now in 2nd (was 4th) – ok.
- E is now in 4th (was 5th) – ok.
- No A or R – ok.

- E(✓) – E is in the word AND in the correct position (now 4th).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another strong option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- R(x) – R is NOT in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 3rd).
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 4th).
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 5th).

So the secret word contains the letters O, S, and E, but none of A or R. The O, S, and E must appear somewhere in the 1st, 2nd, or 4th/5th positions (since they were marked wrong-position).

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses O, S, and E exactly once each (they were only marked “in word” once).
- Does NOT use A or R.
- Places O, S, E in different positions from their original spots.

A good candidate is “HOUSE”:
- Uses O, S, E.
- Places O in the 2nd position (was 3rd).
- Places S in the 3rd position (was 4th).
- Places E in the 5th position (was 5th) – this would actually keep E in the same position, which is invalid since it was marked wrong-position.

Next candidate: “POSED”
- Uses O, S, E.
- Places O in 1st (was 3rd), S in 2nd (was 4th), E in 4th (was 5th).
- Does not use A or R.
This seems valid.

Let me double-check:
- O is now in 1st (was 3rd) – ok.
- S is now in 2nd (was 4th) – ok.
- E is now in 4th (was 5th) – ok.
- No A or R – ok.

“POSED” is a valid guess.

<guess>POSED</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: POSED -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on POSED:
- P(x) – P is NOT in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word AND in the correct position (now 2nd).
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (was 3rd).
- E(✓) – E is in the word AND in the correct position (now 4th).
- D(x) – D is NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: O (2nd), E (4th), S (somewhere else).
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, P, D.
- S must be in the 1st, 3rd, or 5th position (it was 3rd in POSED and now needs to move).

Also, we still have to place the letters O, S, E somewhere in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th. We know:
- 2nd = O
- 4th = E

So the word looks like: _ O _ E _ with S somewhere else.

Possible positions for S: 1st, 3rd, or 5th.

Let’s try a word that:
- Keeps O in 2nd and E in 4th.
- Moves S to 1st position.
- Uses new letters for the remaining spots (avoiding A, R, P, D).

A good candidate is “SOBER”:
- S in 1st (was 3rd in POSED, so valid).
- O in 2nd (matches ✓).
- B and R: but R was already ruled out in Guess 1 (AROSE), so SOBER is invalid because of R.

Next candidate: “SLOPE”:
- S in 1st.
- L and P: but P was ruled out, so invalid.

Next: “SMOKE”:
- S in 1st.
- M, K new letters.
- O and E already placed.

This seems valid:
- S in 1st (was 3rd before).
- O in 2nd (✓).
- M new.
- K new.
- E in 4th (✓).

No conflicts with previous feedback.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: POSED -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) D(x)
Guess 3: SMOKE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) M(x) O(-) K(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

Letters we have ruled out: A, R, P, D, M  
Letters we know are in the word: O, S, E, K  
Correct positions we have learned:  
- O is NOT in position 3 (from AROSE) and NOT in position 2 (from POSED) – wait, POSED said O(✓) which means O is in the correct position, so O is definitely in position 2.  
- E is NOT in position 5 (from AROSE) and NOT in position 4 (from POSED) – but POSED said E(✓), so E is definitely in position 4.  
- S is NOT in position 3 (from POSED) and NOT in position 1 (from SMOKE), so S must be in position 5.  
- K is in the word but in the wrong position (from SMOKE), so K is somewhere else.

So far the word looks like:  
_ O _ E S  

And we still have to place K somewhere in the remaining slots 1 or 3 (since 5 is taken by S).

Letters we can still use: any consonant or vowel except A, R, P, D, M.

Let’s try a word that fits:  
K O _ E S  

The blank must be a letter not yet used and not in {A, R, P, D, M}.  
A common letter that fits is “L”, giving “K O L E S”.  
But “KOLES” is not a valid English word.  
Next, “K O N E S” gives “KONES” – also invalid.  
“K O B E S” gives “KOBE S” – invalid.  

Let’s flip: _ O K E S  
Then the first letter must be a valid consonant not yet used.  
“W” gives “W O K E S” – invalid.  
“F” gives “F O K E S” – invalid.  
“H” gives “H O K E S” – invalid.  

Wait, we can also try S in position 3 instead of 5. That would give:  
_ O S E K  

Now the first letter must be valid.  
“H” gives “H O S E K” – invalid.  
“W” gives “W O S E K” – invalid.  
“F” gives “F O S E K” – invalid.  

Let’s try K in position 1:  
K O _ E S  
Need a valid letter for the 3rd spot.  
“L” gives “K O L E S” – invalid.  
“N” gives “K O N E S” – invalid.  
“G” gives “K O G E S” – invalid.  

Let’s try K in position 3:  
_ O K E S  
Need a valid first-letter consonant.  
“H” gives “H O K E S” – invalid.  
“W” gives “W O K E S” – invalid.  
“F” gives “F O K E S” – invalid.  

Wait, we missed one more possibility: the word could have extra consonants.  
But we know from feedback that S, K, and O/E placements are limited.  
Let me list valid 5-letter words matching “_ O _ E S” with K somewhere and no A, R, P, D, M.

Valid English word: “WOKES” – but W is allowed.  
Check positions:  
W O K E S  
- 1st = W (new letter, allowed)  
- 2nd = O (✓)  
- 3rd = K (was wrong position in SMOKE, now correct)  
- 4th = E (✓)  
- 5th = S (was wrong position in POSED, now correct)  

All constraints satisfied.

This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.\n\nAnother strong option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.\n- R(x) – R is NOT in the word.\n- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 3rd).\n- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 4th).\n- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 5th).\n\nSo the secret word contains the letters O, S, and E, but none of A or R.

From the feedback on JOKES:
- J(x) – J is NOT in the word.
- O(✓) – O is correct in position 2.
- K(✓) – K is correct in position 3.
- E(✓) – E is correct in position 4.
- S(✓) – S is correct in position 5.

So the word is now fully known:
- Position 1: must be a letter not yet ruled out and not A, R, P, D, M, W, J, S, E, O, K.
- Positions 2-5 are locked as O K E S.

Letters still unused and allowed for position 1: B, C, F, G, H, L, N, T, V, Y, Z (and a few others).

Looking at the pattern _ O K E S, the only common English word is “TOKES”, but T has not been ruled out yet.

Let me verify:
- T is not in the banned list.
- TOKES matches the pattern _ O K E S.
- All letters are consistent with prior feedback.

Therefore, the secret word must be TOKES.
