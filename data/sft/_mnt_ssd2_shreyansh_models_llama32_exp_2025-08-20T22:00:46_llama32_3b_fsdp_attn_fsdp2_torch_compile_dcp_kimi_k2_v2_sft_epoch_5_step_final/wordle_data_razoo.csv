For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word.

Another excellent candidate is ""SLATE"" which also covers common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" for this first attempt to maximize vowel coverage early on.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
- E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word contains A, R, and O somewhere, but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 respectively, and it definitely lacks S and E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses A, R, and O exactly once each (since they only appeared once in AROSE).
- Places them in positions different from their positions in AROSE.
- Avoids S and E entirely.
- Uses only remaining letters (no S, E, or the eliminated letters).

Possible positions for A, R, O: A ≠ 1, R ≠ 2, O ≠ 3.

Let’s try a word that shifts those letters to new spots and fills the remaining two slots with other common letters that haven’t been ruled out. A good candidate is “RATIO”:
- R is now in position 1 (allowed, since R only couldn’t be in position 2).
- A is now in position 2 (allowed, since A only couldn’t be in position 1).
- T and I are new letters that haven’t been tested yet and are common.
- O is now in position 4 (allowed, since O only couldn’t be in position 3).

This should give us useful information about T and I while ensuring A, R, and O are placed safely.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word and their exact positions: R (1), A (2), O (5).
- Letters eliminated so far: S, E, T, I.

We still need to determine positions 3 and 4. The remaining letters must be chosen from the alphabet excluding S, E, T, I. We have already used A, R, O, so we need three new letters for positions 3 and 4.

A good strategy is to pick common consonants or vowels that haven’t been ruled out. Possible candidates for positions 3 and 4: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, U, Y, etc.

Let’s try a word that fills positions 3 and 4 with common remaining letters. A good candidate is “RADIO”:
- R (1), A (2), D (3), I (4), O (5). But I was already ruled out in position 4, so that’s invalid.

Next candidate: “RACON” – but C and N are okay, but O is already in position 5, so this would be R A C O N, but we need position 4 to be a consonant and position 3 to be a consonant/vowel. This might not fit our known positions.

Wait, our known positions are:
- Position 1: R
- Position 2: A
- Position 5: O

So the word looks like: R A _ _ O

We need to fill positions 3 and 4 with letters not yet eliminated (excluding S, E, T, I). Good candidates: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, U, Y.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word.

Another excellent candidate is ""SLATE"" which also covers common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" for this first attempt to maximize vowel coverage early on.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
- E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word contains A, R, and O somewhere, but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 respectively, and it definitely lacks S and E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses A, R, and O exactly once each (since they only appeared once in AROSE).
- Places them in positions different from their positions in AROSE.
- Avoids S and E entirely.
- Uses only remaining letters (no S, E, or the eliminated letters).

Possible positions for A, R, O: A ≠ 1, R ≠ 2, O ≠ 3.

Let’s try a word that shifts those letters to new spots and fills the remaining two slots with other common letters that haven’t been ruled out. A good candidate is “RATIO”:
- R is now in position 1 (allowed, since R only couldn’t be in position 2).
- A is now in position 2 (allowed, since A only couldn’t be in position 1).
- T and I are new letters that haven’t been tested yet and are common.
- O is now in position 4 (allowed, since O only couldn’t be in position 3).

This should give us useful information about T and I while ensuring A, R, and O are placed safely.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RATIO -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on RATIO:
- R(✓) – R is in the word and is now in the correct position (position 1).
- A(✓) – A is in the word and is now in the correct position (position 2).
- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- I(x) – I is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and is now in the correct position (position 5).

So far we know:
- Letters in the word and their exact positions: R (1), A (2), O (5).
- Letters eliminated so far: S, E, T, I.

We still need to determine positions 3 and 4. The remaining letters must be chosen from the alphabet excluding S, E, T, I. We have already used A, R, O, so we need three new letters for positions 3 and 4.

A good strategy is to pick common consonants or vowels that haven’t been ruled out. Possible candidates for positions 3 and 4: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, U, Y, etc.

Let’s try a word that fills positions 3 and 4 with common remaining letters. A good candidate is “RADIO”:
- R (1), A (2), D (3), I (4), O (5). But I was already ruled out in position 4, so that’s invalid.

Next candidate: “RACON” – but C and N are okay, but O is already in position 5, so this would be R A C O N, but we need position 4 to be a consonant and position 3 to be a consonant/vowel. This might not fit our known positions.

Wait, our known positions are:
- Position 1: R
- Position 2: A
- Position 5: O

So the word looks like: R A _ _ O

We need to fill positions 3 and 4 with letters not yet eliminated (excluding S, E, T, I). Good candidates: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, U, Y.

Let’s try “RADIO” – but I is eliminated. Not good.

Try “RACON” – but O is already in position 5, and this would place O in position 4, which conflicts.

Let’s try “RALLY”:
- R A L L Y – but we need position 5 to be O, not Y. This doesn’t fit.

Wait, our position 5 is definitely O, so the word must be R A _ _ O.

Let’s list possible words matching R A _ _ O:
- RATIO (but T and I are eliminated)
- RADIO (I eliminated)
- RACON (doesn’t end with O)
- RALLO (doesn’t seem valid)
- RAZOR (but Z and R are okay, but R is already in position 1, and we can reuse letters? Yes, but we need to check if R is allowed in position 4. No feedback yet on R in position 4, but it’s allowed unless we know otherwise.)

Actually, let’s think systematically. We have R A _ _ O. Positions 3 and 4 need to be filled with letters not in {S, E, T, I}.

Common letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, U, Y.

Let’s try “RACON” – but this doesn’t end with O.

“RAGGY” – no, doesn’t fit.

“RALLY” – ends with Y, not O.

“RATIO” – already tried, T and I eliminated.

“RACON” – not valid.

“RACID” – I eliminated.

“RADON” – fits! R A D O N:
- Position 3: D
- Position 4: N
- Letters used: D, N (both new and common)
- No S, E, T, I used.
- R, A, O positions match.

This seems valid. Let’s go with RADON.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
- E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word contains A, R, and O somewhere, but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 respectively, and it definitely lacks S and E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses A, R, and O exactly once each (since they only appeared once in AROSE).

- T and I are new letters that haven’t been tested yet and are common.
- O is now in position 4 (allowed, since O only couldn’t be in position 3).

We still need to determine positions 3 and 4. The remaining letters must be chosen from the alphabet excluding S, E, T, I. We have already used A, R, O, so we need three new letters for positions 3 and 4.

A good strategy is to pick common consonants or vowels that haven’t been ruled out. Possible candidates for positions 3 and 4: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, U, Y, etc.

Let’s try a word that fills positions 3 and 4 with common remaining letters. A good candidate is “RADIO”:

Wait, our known positions are:
- Position 1: R
- Position 2: A
- Position 5: O

So the word looks like: R A _ _ O

We need to fill positions 3 and 4 with letters not yet eliminated (excluding S, E, T, I). Good candidates: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, U, Y.

Wait, our position 5 is definitely O, so the word must be R A _ _ O.

Let’s list possible words matching R A _ _ O:
- RATIO (but T and I are eliminated)
- RADIO (I eliminated)
- RACON (doesn’t end with O)
- RALLO (doesn’t seem valid)
- RAZOR (but Z and R are okay, but R is already in position 1, and we can reuse letters? Yes, but we need to check if R is allowed in position 4. No feedback yet on R in position 4, but it’s allowed unless we know otherwise.)

Actually, let’s think systematically. We have R A _ _ O. Positions 3 and 4 need to be filled with letters not in {S, E, T, I}.

Common letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, U, Y.

Let’s try “RACON” – but this doesn’t end with O.

“RAGGY” – no, doesn’t fit.

“RALLY” – ends with Y, not O.

“RATIO” – already tried, T and I eliminated.

“RACON” – not valid.

“RACID” – I eliminated.

“RADON” – fits! R A D O N:

From the feedback on RAZOR:
- R(✓) – R is correct in position 1.
- A(✓) – A is correct in position 2.
- Z(✓) – Z is correct in position 3.
- O(✓) – O is correct in position 5.
- R(-) – R is in the word but NOT in position 4.

However, we already have R in position 1, so the word must be R A Z _ O, and the fourth letter cannot be R (since R is already in position 1 and the feedback says R(-) in position 4, meaning R is not in position 4). This implies the word is R A Z _ O, and the missing letter (position 4) cannot be R, S, E, T, I, D, N.

Looking at the pattern R A Z _ O, the only common English word is RAZOR, which we've already tried and failed on (because the fourth letter R was marked as - instead of ✓). This suggests the actual word is not RAZOR.

Let me reconsider the possible letters for position 4. From the eliminated list: S, E, T, I, D, N, and we've already used A, R, O, Z. So remaining possible letters for position 4 are: B, C, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, Y.

Looking for valid 5-letter English words of the form R A Z _ O:
- RAZGO – not a word.
- RAZBO – not a word.
- RAZCO – not a word.
- RAZFO – not a word.
- RAZHO – not a word.
- RAZLO – not a word.
- RAZMO – not a word.
- RAZPO – not a word.
- RAZUO – not a word.
- RAZYO – not a word.

Wait, let me think differently. The word must be R A Z _ O, and the fourth letter cannot be R, S, E, T, I, D, N. The only plausible English word is RAZOR, but we already tried it and were told R(-) in position 4, meaning R is not in position 4. Since R is already in position 1, this seems impossible – meaning I must have missed a word.

Actually, the word ""RATIO"" was already tried and T and I were eliminated. ""RADON"" tried D and N. ""RAZOR"" tried Z in position 3 and R in position 4 (but R is already in position 1, so this is consistent).

Let me check if there are other possibilities. Another word could be ""RACON"" – but that doesn't fit. ""RAGGY"" – no. ""RALLY"" – no. ""RAPID"" – I eliminated. ""RAJON"" – N eliminated. ""RATIO"" – T and I eliminated.

This seems problematic. But looking back, the word must be R A Z _ O. The only valid English word fitting this is RAZOR, but the feedback says R(-) in position 4, which is impossible unless the word is RAZOR. This suggests the word is indeed RAZOR, and the feedback interpretation might allow R in position 4, but since R is already in position 1, this implies the word is RAZOR.

However, the feedback on RAZOR was R(✓) for positions 1,2,3,5 and R(-) for position 4, which is standard. This means the word is RAZOR. Let me proceed with that.

But wait, the word must be R A Z O R, but this would have R in position 4, and the feedback says R(-) in position 4, meaning R is not in position 4. Since R is already in position 1, this is impossible. This suggests the word is not RAZOR.

I must have made an error. Let me re-examine the feedback:

Looking back at the feedback on RAZOR:
- R(✓) for positions 1,2,3,5: R A Z _ O
- R(-) for position 4: there is no position 4 in RAZOR, so this makes sense – the word is R A Z _ O, and the fourth letter is not R.

Thus, the word must be R A Z _ O, and the only valid English word is RAZOR. Since RAZOR was our only remaining candidate, this must be the word.

But the feedback on RAZOR was R(✓) for positions 1,2,3,5 and R(-) for position 4, which is standard. This means the word is RAZOR.

Therefore, the correct word is RAZOR.

- R is correctly placed in position 1
- A is correctly placed in position 2
- O is correctly placed in position 5
- Z is correctly placed in position 3

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word.

Another excellent candidate is ""SLATE"" which also covers common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" for this first attempt to maximize vowel coverage early on.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
- E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word contains A, R, and O somewhere, but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 respectively, and it definitely lacks S and E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses A, R, and O exactly once each (since they only appeared once in AROSE).
- Places them in positions different from their positions in AROSE.
- Avoids S and E entirely.
- Uses only remaining letters (no S, E, or the eliminated letters).

Possible positions for A, R, O: A ≠ 1, R ≠ 2, O ≠ 3.

Let’s try a word that shifts those letters to new spots and fills the remaining two slots with other common letters that haven’t been ruled out. A good candidate is “RATIO”:
- R is now in position 1 (allowed, since R only couldn’t be in position 2).
- A is now in position 2 (allowed, since A only couldn’t be in position 1).
- T and I are new letters that haven’t been tested yet and are common.
- O is now in position 4 (allowed, since O only couldn’t be in position 3).

This should give us useful information about T and I while ensuring A, R, and O are placed safely.

<guess>RATIO</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RATIO -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on RATIO:
- R(✓) – R is in the word and is now in the correct position (position 1).
- A(✓) – A is in the word and is now in the correct position (position 2).
- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- I(x) – I is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and is now in the correct position (position 5).

So far we know:
- Letters in the word and their exact positions: R (1), A (2), O (5).
- Letters eliminated so far: S, E, T, I.

We still need to determine positions 3 and 4. The remaining letters must be chosen from the alphabet excluding S, E, T, I. We have already used A, R, O, so we need three new letters for positions 3 and 4.

A good strategy is to pick common consonants or vowels that haven’t been ruled out. Possible candidates for positions 3 and 4: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, U, Y, etc.

Let’s try a word that fills positions 3 and 4 with common remaining letters. A good candidate is “RADIO”:
- R (1), A (2), D (3), I (4), O (5). But I was already ruled out in position 4, so that’s invalid.

Next candidate: “RACON” – but C and N are okay, but O is already in position 5, so this would be R A C O N, but we need position 4 to be a consonant and position 3 to be a consonant/vowel. This might not fit our known positions.

Wait, our known positions are:
- Position 1: R
- Position 2: A
- Position 5: O

So the word looks like: R A _ _ O

We need to fill positions 3 and 4 with letters not yet eliminated (excluding S, E, T, I). Good candidates: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, U, Y.

Let’s try “RADIO” – but I is eliminated. Not good.

Try “RACON” – but O is already in position 5, and this would place O in position 4, which conflicts.

Let’s try “RALLY”:
- R A L L Y – but we need position 5 to be O, not Y. This doesn’t fit.

Wait, our position 5 is definitely O, so the word must be R A _ _ O.

Let’s list possible words matching R A _ _ O:
- RATIO (but T and I are eliminated)
- RADIO (I eliminated)
- RACON (doesn’t end with O)
- RALLO (doesn’t seem valid)
- RAZOR (but Z and R are okay, but R is already in position 1, and we can reuse letters? Yes, but we need to check if R is allowed in position 4. No feedback yet on R in position 4, but it’s allowed unless we know otherwise.)

Actually, let’s think systematically. We have R A _ _ O. Positions 3 and 4 need to be filled with letters not in {S, E, T, I}.

Common letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, U, Y.

Let’s try “RACON” – but this doesn’t end with O.

“RAGGY” – no, doesn’t fit.

“RALLY” – ends with Y, not O.

“RATIO” – already tried, T and I eliminated.

“RACON” – not valid.

“RACID” – I eliminated.

“RADON” – fits! R A D O N:
- Position 3: D
- Position 4: N
- Letters used: D, N (both new and common)
- No S, E, T, I used.
- R, A, O positions match.

This seems valid. Let’s go with RADON.

<guess>RADON</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 3: RADON -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) D(x) O(✓) N(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the latest feedback on RADON:
- R(✓) – R is correct in position 1.
- A(✓) – A is correct in position 2.
- D(x) – D is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is correct in position 5.
- N(x) – N is not in the word.

So the word is now fully determined except for positions 3 and 4. The letters we know are NOT in the word are: S, E, T, I, D, N.

We have:
R A _ _ O

Letters left to try for positions 3 and 4 (excluding the eliminated ones): B, C, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form R A _ _ O. Let’s list possibilities:
- RACON – not valid (doesn’t end with O)
- RAGGY – no
- RALLY – no
- RAPID – I eliminated
- RAZOR – Z and R are okay, but R is already in position 1, and we can’t reuse it in position 4? No restriction yet, but R is already placed in position 1, so position 4 can be any letter except eliminated ones. RAZOR is R A Z O R, but this would have R in position 4, which is allowed (no feedback against it). However, R is already in position 1, and there’s no rule against having R twice. But let’s check if RAZOR is valid – yes, it’s a word.

Another candidate: RATIO – but T is eliminated.
RACON – invalid.
RAGGO – no.
RABOT – T eliminated.
RATIO – T eliminated.
RACON – invalid.

The only valid word seems to be RAZOR. Let’s verify:
- R A Z O R
- Z and R are new (not eliminated).
- No S, E, T, I, D, N.
- Matches R A _ _ O.

This seems to be the only valid word fitting the pattern. Let’s go with RAZOR.

<guess>RAZOR</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RATIO -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(✓)
Guess 3: RADON -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) D(x) O(✓) N(x)
Guess 4: RAZOR -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) Z(✓) O(✓) R(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on RAZOR:
- R(✓) – R is correct in position 1.
- A(✓) – A is correct in position 2.
- Z(✓) – Z is correct in position 3.
- O(✓) – O is correct in position 5.
- R(-) – R is in the word but NOT in position 4.

However, we already have R in position 1, so the word must be R A Z _ O, and the fourth letter cannot be R (since R is already in position 1 and the feedback says R(-) in position 4, meaning R is not in position 4). This implies the word is R A Z _ O, and the missing letter (position 4) cannot be R, S, E, T, I, D, N.

Looking at the pattern R A Z _ O, the only common English word is RAZOR, which we've already tried and failed on (because the fourth letter R was marked as - instead of ✓). This suggests the actual word is not RAZOR.

Let me reconsider the possible letters for position 4. From the eliminated list: S, E, T, I, D, N, and we've already used A, R, O, Z. So remaining possible letters for position 4 are: B, C, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, Y.

Looking for valid 5-letter English words of the form R A Z _ O:
- RAZGO – not a word.
- RAZBO – not a word.
- RAZCO – not a word.
- RAZFO – not a word.
- RAZHO – not a word.
- RAZLO – not a word.
- RAZMO – not a word.
- RAZPO – not a word.
- RAZUO – not a word.
- RAZYO – not a word.

Wait, let me think differently. The word must be R A Z _ O, and the fourth letter cannot be R, S, E, T, I, D, N. The only plausible English word is RAZOR, but we already tried it and were told R(-) in position 4, meaning R is not in position 4. Since R is already in position 1, this seems impossible – meaning I must have missed a word.

Actually, the word ""RATIO"" was already tried and T and I were eliminated. ""RADON"" tried D and N. ""RAZOR"" tried Z in position 3 and R in position 4 (but R is already in position 1, so this is consistent).

Let me check if there are other possibilities. Another word could be ""RACON"" – but that doesn't fit. ""RAGGY"" – no. ""RALLY"" – no. ""RAPID"" – I eliminated. ""RAJON"" – N eliminated. ""RATIO"" – T and I eliminated.

This seems problematic. But looking back, the word must be R A Z _ O. The only valid English word fitting this is RAZOR, but the feedback says R(-) in position 4, which is impossible unless the word is RAZOR. This suggests the word is indeed RAZOR, and the feedback interpretation might allow R in position 4, but since R is already in position 1, this implies the word is RAZOR.

However, the feedback on RAZOR was R(✓) for positions 1,2,3,5 and R(-) for position 4, which is standard. This means the word is RAZOR. Let me proceed with that.

But wait, the word must be R A Z O R, but this would have R in position 4, and the feedback says R(-) in position 4, meaning R is not in position 4. Since R is already in position 1, this is impossible. This suggests the word is not RAZOR.

I must have made an error. Let me re-examine the feedback:

Looking back at the feedback on RAZOR:
- R(✓) for positions 1,2,3,5: R A Z _ O
- R(-) for position 4: there is no position 4 in RAZOR, so this makes sense – the word is R A Z _ O, and the fourth letter is not R.

Thus, the word must be R A Z _ O, and the only valid English word is RAZOR. Since RAZOR was our only remaining candidate, this must be the word.

But the feedback on RAZOR was R(✓) for positions 1,2,3,5 and R(-) for position 4, which is standard. This means the word is RAZOR.

Therefore, the correct word is RAZOR.Based on the feedback, we now know:
- R is correctly placed in position 1
- A is correctly placed in position 2
- O is correctly placed in position 5
- Z is correctly placed in position 3
- The only remaining unknown is position 4, which cannot be R (since R is already in position 1 and the feedback shows R(-) in position 4), nor any of the previously eliminated letters (S, E, T, I, D, N)

The only valid 5-letter English word that fits the pattern R A Z _ O is RAZOR.
