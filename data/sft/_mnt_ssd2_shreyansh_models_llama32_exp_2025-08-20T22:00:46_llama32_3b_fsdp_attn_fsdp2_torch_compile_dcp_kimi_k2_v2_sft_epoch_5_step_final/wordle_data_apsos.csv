For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another strong option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct first position (✓)
- R is not in the word at all (x)
- O is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- S is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- E is not in the word at all (x)

So we know:
1. The word starts with A
2. It contains O and S, but O is not in position 3 and S is not in position 4
3. It does NOT contain R or E

Good next letters to test would be common consonants and vowels not yet ruled out. Since we've eliminated R and E, we might want to test other vowels (I, U) and common consonants (T, N, L, etc.).

A strong second guess would be something like ""ADIOS"" - it keeps the A we know is correct, and tests D, I, O, S. The O is in position 3 here, but we know from feedback that O can't be in position 3, so this would actually be bad. Let me think of a better option.

Better options might be:
- ""ALOES"" - but this has E which we know is out
- ""ASIDE"" - has E which is out
- ""ATOLL"" - but starts with T instead of A
- ""ABIOS"" - starts with A, has I and B

Actually, let me think more systematically. We need:
- A _ _ _ _
- Must contain O and S
- O cannot be in position 3
- S cannot be in position 4
- No R, no E

Possible structures:
- A S _ O _ (S in 2, O in 4)
- A _ S O _ (S in 3, O in 4)
- A _ _ S O (S in 4 - but this is invalid since S can't be in 4)
- A _ O S _ (O in 3 - invalid)
- A O _ S _ (O in 2, S in 4 - invalid)
- A _ _ _ O (no S)
- A S _ _ O (S in 2, O in 5)

Looking at common words:
- ""ASIDE"" has E which is out
- ""ALOUD"" has no S
- ""ABASE"" has E which is out
- ""ACORN"" has R which is out
- ""ADIOS"" has S in 4 which is invalid
- ""AGIOS"" has S in 4 invalid
- ""AMOS"" is 4 letters
- ""ABASE"" is invalid
- ""ACORN"" is invalid
- ""ADIEU"" has no S

Let me try ""ABIOS"" - starts with A, has B, I, O, S. O is in position 3 which we know is invalid, so this is bad.

""ALOUD"" has no S.

""ASIDE"" has E.

""ASSIST"" has S in 1 and 4 - but S can't be in 4.

""ATOLL"" has O in 3 invalid.

""AMONG"" has O in 3 invalid.

""AGONY"" has O in 3 invalid.

""ACORN"" has R invalid.

""ADORN"" has R invalid.

""ABOVE"" has E invalid.

""ABUSE"" has E invalid.

""ADIOS"" has S in 4 invalid.

""AGIOS"" has S in 4 invalid.

""ALOUD"" has no S.

""AMOUR"" has R invalid (but R isn't in AROSE, so maybe?)

Wait, let me re-examine AROSE feedback:
- A(✓) - correct in position 1
- R(x) - not in word
- O(-) - in word but not position 3
- S(-) - in word but not position 4
- E(x) - not in word

So we have:
A _ _ _ _
with O and S somewhere, but:
- O not in 3
- S not in 4

Possible positions for O: 2, 4, 5
Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5

Let me try ""ABOOS"" - but has two O's which might not be ideal.
- ""ABOOS"" - A B O O S. O is in 3 which is invalid
- ""ABSON"" - A B S O N. S is in 3, O in 4. This seems valid.

""ABSON"" uses:
- A(✓) known correct
- B new letter
- S in 3 (allowed)
- O in 4 (allowed)
- N new letter

This seems like a good second guess to test new letters and reposition O and S.

Another option could be ""ABOAT"" - but T isn't super common.

""ABSON"" seems best.

Alternatively ""ACORN"" is invalid (R out), ""ADORN"" (R out), ""AGORN"" (R out)

""ABSON"" it is then.
</think>

Based on the feedback that A is correct in position 1, and O and S are in the word but in wrong positions (while R and E are not in the word), I'll try a word that repositions O and S and tests new common letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another strong option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct first position (✓)
- R is not in the word at all (x)
- O is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- S is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- E is not in the word at all (x)

So we know:
1. The word starts with A
2. It contains O and S, but O is not in position 3 and S is not in position 4
3. It does NOT contain R or E

Good next letters to test would be common consonants and vowels not yet ruled out. Since we've eliminated R and E, we might want to test other vowels (I, U) and common consonants (T, N, L, etc.).

A strong second guess would be something like ""ADIOS"" - it keeps the A we know is correct, and tests D, I, O, S. The O is in position 3 here, but we know from feedback that O can't be in position 3, so this would actually be bad. Let me think of a better option.

Better options might be:
- ""ALOES"" - but this has E which we know is out
- ""ASIDE"" - has E which is out
- ""ATOLL"" - but starts with T instead of A
- ""ABIOS"" - starts with A, has I and B

Actually, let me think more systematically. We need:
- A _ _ _ _
- Must contain O and S
- O cannot be in position 3
- S cannot be in position 4
- No R, no E

Possible structures:
- A S _ O _ (S in 2, O in 4)
- A _ S O _ (S in 3, O in 4)
- A _ _ S O (S in 4 - but this is invalid since S can't be in 4)
- A _ O S _ (O in 3 - invalid)
- A O _ S _ (O in 2, S in 4 - invalid)
- A _ _ _ O (no S)
- A S _ _ O (S in 2, O in 5)

Looking at common words:
- ""ASIDE"" has E which is out
- ""ALOUD"" has no S
- ""ABASE"" has E which is out
- ""ACORN"" has R which is out
- ""ADIOS"" has S in 4 which is invalid
- ""AGIOS"" has S in 4 invalid
- ""AMOS"" is 4 letters
- ""ABASE"" is invalid
- ""ACORN"" is invalid
- ""ADIEU"" has no S

Let me try ""ABIOS"" - starts with A, has B, I, O, S. O is in position 3 which we know is invalid, so this is bad.

""ALOUD"" has no S.

""ASIDE"" has E.

""ASSIST"" has S in 1 and 4 - but S can't be in 4.

""ATOLL"" has O in 3 invalid.

""AMONG"" has O in 3 invalid.

""AGONY"" has O in 3 invalid.

""ACORN"" has R invalid.

""ADORN"" has R invalid.

""ABOVE"" has E invalid.

""ABUSE"" has E invalid.

""ADIOS"" has S in 4 invalid.

""AGIOS"" has S in 4 invalid.

""ALOUD"" has no S.

""AMOUR"" has R invalid (but R isn't in AROSE, so maybe?)

Wait, let me re-examine AROSE feedback:
- A(✓) - correct in position 1
- R(x) - not in word
- O(-) - in word but not position 3
- S(-) - in word but not position 4
- E(x) - not in word

So we have:
A _ _ _ _
with O and S somewhere, but:
- O not in 3
- S not in 4

Possible positions for O: 2, 4, 5
Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5

Let me try ""ABOOS"" - but has two O's which might not be ideal.
- ""ABOOS"" - A B O O S. O is in 3 which is invalid
- ""ABSON"" - A B S O N. S is in 3, O in 4. This seems valid.

""ABSON"" uses:
- A(✓) known correct
- B new letter
- S in 3 (allowed)
- O in 4 (allowed)
- N new letter

This seems like a good second guess to test new letters and reposition O and S.

Another option could be ""ABOAT"" - but T isn't super common.

""ABSON"" seems best.

Alternatively ""ACORN"" is invalid (R out), ""ADORN"" (R out), ""AGORN"" (R out)

""ABSON"" it is then.Based on the feedback that A is correct in position 1, and O and S are in the word but in wrong positions (while R and E are not in the word), I'll try a word that repositions O and S and tests new common letters.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. A is fixed in position 1: A _ _ _ _
2. S is in the word and is in position 3: A _ S _ _
3. O is in the word and is in position 4: A _ S O _
4. B and N are not in the word.
5. R, E are not in the word (from Guess 1).
6. Letters already confirmed: A, S, O.
7. Letters already ruled out: B, E, N, R.

We still need letters 2 and 5.  
Common remaining consonants: T, L, D, C, M, P, etc.  
Common remaining vowels: I, U.

Possible second-word forms: A _ S O _  
We can now guess a word that fills in those blanks:  
“ABASE” – but B is out; “ACORN” – R is out; “ADIOS” – I and D are both still possible.  
“ADIOS”” uses I (vowel) and D (consonant), neither of which has been ruled out yet.

So “ADIOS” is a valid next guess.

From all feedback so far:

1. A is locked in position 1: A _ _ _ _
2. S is in position 3: A _ S _ _
3. O is in position 4: A _ S O _
4. Letters ruled out: B, D, E, I, N, R
5. Still need letters 2 and 5.

Possible consonants left: C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, W, Y
Possible vowels left: U (since A, O are used and E, I are out)

The pattern is A _ S O _ with letters 2 and 5 to be filled.
Let’s list plausible endings:
- A F S O _ → AFOS_ (no common word)
- A C S O _ → ACOS_ (ACORN doesn’t fit, ACOS doesn’t extend)
- A G S O _ → AGOS_ (no)
- A H S O _ → AHOS_ (no)
- A L S O _ → ALOS_ (no)
- A M S O _ → AMOS_ (AMOS is 4 letters)
- A T S O _ → ATOS_ (no)
- A C S O T → ACOST (not a word)
- A C S O N → ACSON (not a word)
- A C S O K → AC Sok (not a word)
- A L S O M → ALSAM (not a word)
- A L S O T → ALSON (not a word)
- A L S O D → ALSDO (not a word)
- A L S O G → ALSOG (not a word)
- A L S O H → ALSOH (not a word)
- A L S O L → ALSEL (not a word)
- A L S O Y → ALSOY (not a word)
- A L S O F → ALSOF (not a word)
- A L S O C → ALSOC (not a word)
- A L S O P → ALSOP (not a word)
- A L S O B → ALSOB (not a word)
- A L S O M → ALSAM (not a word)
- A L S O G → ALSOG (not a word)

Wait, let me think differently. The pattern is A _ S O _. We need valid 5-letter words starting with A, having S in 3, O in 4, and ending with two allowed letters.

Real words fitting A _ S O _:
- ALOES – but E is out
- AFOUL – but F, U, L are still possible: A F U L? No, that’s 5 letters but A F U L doesn’t fit the pattern.
- AMISS – but S is already in 3 and we have S in 3, so double S is unlikely.
- ALOOF – but F is allowed, L is allowed, O is already placed.
- ALOOF – A L O O F. This has O in 3 which we know is invalid (from Guess 1: O(-) in AROSE means O is not in position 3). So ALOOF is invalid because O appears in position 3.

Next:
- AFOOT – but O is in 4, not 3
- ALOOF – invalid O position
- ALOES – invalid E
- ALOUT – U is allowed, T is allowed
- ALOUT – A L O U T. This fits:
  - A(✓) in 1
  - L new letter
  - O(✓) in 4
  - S(✓) in 3
  - U new vowel (only vowel left is U)
  - T new consonant

“ALOUT” isn’t a word, but “ALOUT” is. However, “ALOUT” is archaic; “ALLOT” has L twice but fits the pattern: A L O T. Wait, that’s 4 letters.

Actually, let me list all 5-letter words matching A _ S O _ and check:

- AFOOT – O in 3 invalid
- ALOOF – O in 3 invalid
- ALOES – E invalid
- ALOUT – 5 letters? A L O U T. Yes, this fits: A(✓) in 1, L new, O(✓) in 4, S(✓) in 3, U new, T new.

Another: AHOOT – no O in 4
AFOOT – no O in 4
AMOOT – no O in 4
APOOT – no O in 4

“ALOUT” isn’t valid.

“ALOUT” seems the only valid 5-letter word left matching the pattern.

But “ALOUT” is obscure. Maybe I missed?

Wait, let me think of “ALOUD” – but D is out.

“ALOOF” – invalid O position.

“ALOS_” – S already in 3.

“ALOUT” appears to be the only valid choice left.

But let me double-check: A L O U T
- A(✓) in 1
- L new
- O(✓) in 4
- S(✓) in 3
- U new vowel (only vowel left is U)
- T new consonant

This seems valid.

Therefore, next guess: ALOUT.

4. Letters ruled out: B, D, E, I, N, R
5. Still need letters 2 and 5.

Possible consonants left: C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, W, Y
Possible vowels left: U (since A, O are used and E, I are out)

The pattern is A _ S O _ with letters 2 and 5 to be filled.
Let’s list plausible endings:
- A F S O _ → AFOS_ (no common word)
- A C S O _ → ACOS_ (ACORN doesn’t fit, ACOS doesn’t extend)
- A G S O _ → AGOS_ (no)
- A H S O _ → AHOS_ (no)
- A L S O _ → ALOS_ (no)
- A M S O _ → AMOS_ (AMOS is 4 letters)
- A T S O _ → ATOS_ (no)
- A C S O T → ACOST (not a word)
- A C S O N → ACSON (not a word)
- A C S O K → AC Sok (not a word)
- A L S O M → ALSAM (not a word)
- A L S O T → ALSON (not a word)
- A L S O D → ALSDO (not a word)
- A L S O G → ALSOG (not a word)
- A L S O H → ALSOH (not a word)
- A L S O L → ALSEL (not a word)
- A L S O Y → ALSOY (not a word)
- A L S O F → ALSOF (not a word)
- A L S O C → ALSOC (not a word)
- A L S O P → ALSOP (not a word)
- A L S O B → ALSOB (not a word)
- A L S O M → ALSAM (not a word)
- A L S O G → ALSOG (not a word)

Wait, let me think differently. The pattern is A _ S O _. We need valid 5-letter words starting with A, having S in 3, O in 4, and ending with two allowed letters.

Real words fitting A _ S O _:
- ALOES – but E is out
- AFOUL – but F, U, L are still possible: A F U L? No, that’s 5 letters but A F U L doesn’t fit the pattern.
- AMISS – but S is already in 3 and we have S in 3, so double S is unlikely.
- ALOOF – but F is allowed, L is allowed, O is already placed.
- ALOOF – A L O O F. This has O in 3 which we know is invalid (from Guess 1: O(-) in AROSE means O is not in position 3). So ALOOF is invalid because O appears in position 3.

Next:
- AFOOT – but O is in 4, not 3
- ALOOF – invalid O position
- ALOES – invalid E
- ALOUT – U is allowed, T is allowed
- ALOUT – A L O U T. This fits:
  - A(✓) in 1
  - L new letter
  - O(✓) in 4
  - S(✓) in 3
  - U new vowel (only vowel left is U)
  - T new consonant

“ALOUT” isn’t a word, but “ALOUT” is. However, “ALOUT” is archaic; “ALLOT” has L twice but fits the pattern: A L O T. Wait, that’s 4 letters.

Actually, let me list all 5-letter words matching A _ S O _ and check:

- AFOOT – O in 3 invalid
- ALOOF – O in 3 invalid
- ALOES – E invalid
- ALOUT – 5 letters? A L O U T. Yes, this fits: A(✓) in 1, L new, O(✓) in 4, S(✓) in 3, U new, T new.

Another: AHOOT – no O in 4
AFOOT – no O in 4
AMOOT – no O in 4
APOOT – no O in 4

“ALOUT” isn’t valid.

“ALOUT” seems the only valid 5-letter word left matching the pattern.

But “ALOUT” is obscure. Maybe I missed?

Wait, let me think of “ALOUD” – but D is out.

“ALOOF” – invalid O position.

“ALOS_” – S already in 3.

“ALOUT” appears to be the only valid choice left.

But let me double-check: A L O U T
- A(✓) in 1
- L new
- O(✓) in 4
- S(✓) in 3
- U new vowel (only vowel left is U)
- T new consonant

This seems valid.

Therefore, next guess: ALOUT.",Guess 4: ALOUT -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(x) O(-) U(x) T(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another strong option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct first position (✓)
- R is not in the word at all (x)
- O is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- S is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- E is not in the word at all (x)

So we know:
1. The word starts with A
2. It contains O and S, but O is not in position 3 and S is not in position 4
3. It does NOT contain R or E

Good next letters to test would be common consonants and vowels not yet ruled out. Since we've eliminated R and E, we might want to test other vowels (I, U) and common consonants (T, N, L, etc.).

A strong second guess would be something like ""ADIOS"" - it keeps the A we know is correct, and tests D, I, O, S. The O is in position 3 here, but we know from feedback that O can't be in position 3, so this would actually be bad. Let me think of a better option.

Better options might be:
- ""ALOES"" - but this has E which we know is out
- ""ASIDE"" - has E which is out
- ""ATOLL"" - but starts with T instead of A
- ""ABIOS"" - starts with A, has I and B

Actually, let me think more systematically. We need:
- A _ _ _ _
- Must contain O and S
- O cannot be in position 3
- S cannot be in position 4
- No R, no E

Possible structures:
- A S _ O _ (S in 2, O in 4)
- A _ S O _ (S in 3, O in 4)
- A _ _ S O (S in 4 - but this is invalid since S can't be in 4)
- A _ O S _ (O in 3 - invalid)
- A O _ S _ (O in 2, S in 4 - invalid)
- A _ _ _ O (no S)
- A S _ _ O (S in 2, O in 5)

Looking at common words:
- ""ASIDE"" has E which is out
- ""ALOUD"" has no S
- ""ABASE"" has E which is out
- ""ACORN"" has R which is out
- ""ADIOS"" has S in 4 which is invalid
- ""AGIOS"" has S in 4 invalid
- ""AMOS"" is 4 letters
- ""ABASE"" is invalid
- ""ACORN"" is invalid
- ""ADIEU"" has no S

Let me try ""ABIOS"" - starts with A, has B, I, O, S. O is in position 3 which we know is invalid, so this is bad.

""ALOUD"" has no S.

""ASIDE"" has E.

""ASSIST"" has S in 1 and 4 - but S can't be in 4.

""ATOLL"" has O in 3 invalid.

""AMONG"" has O in 3 invalid.

""AGONY"" has O in 3 invalid.

""ACORN"" has R invalid.

""ADORN"" has R invalid.

""ABOVE"" has E invalid.

""ABUSE"" has E invalid.

""ADIOS"" has S in 4 invalid.

""AGIOS"" has S in 4 invalid.

""ALOUD"" has no S.

""AMOUR"" has R invalid (but R isn't in AROSE, so maybe?)

Wait, let me re-examine AROSE feedback:
- A(✓) - correct in position 1
- R(x) - not in word
- O(-) - in word but not position 3
- S(-) - in word but not position 4
- E(x) - not in word

So we have:
A _ _ _ _
with O and S somewhere, but:
- O not in 3
- S not in 4

Possible positions for O: 2, 4, 5
Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5

Let me try ""ABOOS"" - but has two O's which might not be ideal.
- ""ABOOS"" - A B O O S. O is in 3 which is invalid
- ""ABSON"" - A B S O N. S is in 3, O in 4. This seems valid.

""ABSON"" uses:
- A(✓) known correct
- B new letter
- S in 3 (allowed)
- O in 4 (allowed)
- N new letter

This seems like a good second guess to test new letters and reposition O and S.

Another option could be ""ABOAT"" - but T isn't super common.

""ABSON"" seems best.

Alternatively ""ACORN"" is invalid (R out), ""ADORN"" (R out), ""AGORN"" (R out)

""ABSON"" it is then.Based on the feedback that A is correct in position 1, and O and S are in the word but in wrong positions (while R and E are not in the word), I'll try a word that repositions O and S and tests new common letters.

<guess>ABSON</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: ABSON -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) B(x) S(✓) O(✓) N(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. A is fixed in position 1: A _ _ _ _
2. S is in the word and is in position 3: A _ S _ _
3. O is in the word and is in position 4: A _ S O _
4. B and N are not in the word.
5. R, E are not in the word (from Guess 1).
6. Letters already confirmed: A, S, O.
7. Letters already ruled out: B, E, N, R.

We still need letters 2 and 5.  
Common remaining consonants: T, L, D, C, M, P, etc.  
Common remaining vowels: I, U.

Possible second-word forms: A _ S O _  
We can now guess a word that fills in those blanks:  
“ABASE” – but B is out; “ACORN” – R is out; “ADIOS” – I and D are both still possible.  
“ADIOS”” uses I (vowel) and D (consonant), neither of which has been ruled out yet.

So “ADIOS” is a valid next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: ABSON -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) B(x) S(✓) O(✓) N(x)
Guess 3: ADIOS -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) D(x) I(x) O(✓) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From all feedback so far:

1. A is locked in position 1: A _ _ _ _
2. S is in position 3: A _ S _ _
3. O is in position 4: A _ S O _
4. Letters ruled out: B, D, E, I, N, R
5. Still need letters 2 and 5.

Possible consonants left: C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, W, Y
Possible vowels left: U (since A, O are used and E, I are out)

The pattern is A _ S O _ with letters 2 and 5 to be filled.
Let’s list plausible endings:

Let’s update what we now know after four guesses.

1. A is locked in position 1: A _ _ _ _
2. S is in position 3: A _ S _ _
3. O is in the word but NOT in position 4 (from Guess 4 feedback: O(-) in ALOUT).  
   Yet in Guess 2 we thought O was in position 4 (✓ in ABSON).  
   This is a contradiction!  
   The only way both can be true is if the feedback for Guess 4 was mis-recorded.  
   Assuming the ABSON feedback (O(✓) in position 4) stands, we must treat O as definitely in position 4.

Therefore the pattern is:
A _ S O _

Letters already ruled out:
B, D, E, I, L, N, R, T, U

Letters still allowed: C, F, G, H, K, M, P, W, Y plus any other consonants/vowels not yet excluded.

We need a 5-letter word of the form A _ S O _ using only allowed letters.

Real words fitting this pattern:
- AFOOT – O in 4, S in 3, but T is out
- AGROS – R out
- AMEOS – E out
- APSES – S in 3 but second S is invalid (no info on double S, but let’s check others)
- ALOES – E out
- AFOUL – U out, F, L, U out
- AHOOT – O in 3 invalid
- AFOOT – O in 3 invalid
- AHOOT – invalid O position
- AGONY – N out
- ALOOF – O in 3 invalid
- AMISS – S in 3 but double S issue
- AFOUL – U out
- AHOOT – invalid O position

Looking more carefully, the only common 5-letter word matching A _ S O _ with allowed letters seems to be:

AFOOT – but has T (out)
AHOOT – has H, O in 3 invalid
AGROS – R out
AMSES – S in 3 but second S is invalid
APSES – same issue

Actually, let me check “AMISS” – but S is in 3, O in 4, but it’s A M I S S. We have no info on I, but let’s see:

A M I S S:
- A(✓) in 1
- M new
- I new (possible)
- S in 3 (✓)
- S in 5 (possible, no info against it)

But we have no contradiction preventing double S.  
“AMISS” is a valid 5-letter word.

Another candidate: “ACROS” – but R out.
“ACORN” – R out.
“ACOST” – T out.
“AGAST” – T out.
“AGONY” – N out.
“AGLOW” – W allowed, L out
“AGREE” – E out
“AGUES” – E out

“AMISS” seems the only plausible remaining word.

Therefore, next guess: AMISS.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another strong option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct first position (✓)
- R is not in the word at all (x)
- O is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- S is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- E is not in the word at all (x)

So we know:
1. The word starts with A
2. It contains O and S, but O is not in position 3 and S is not in position 4
3. It does NOT contain R or E

Good next letters to test would be common consonants and vowels not yet ruled out. Since we've eliminated R and E, we might want to test other vowels (I, U) and common consonants (T, N, L, etc.).

A strong second guess would be something like ""ADIOS"" - it keeps the A we know is correct, and tests D, I, O, S. The O is in position 3 here, but we know from feedback that O can't be in position 3, so this would actually be bad. Let me think of a better option.

Better options might be:
- ""ALOES"" - but this has E which we know is out
- ""ASIDE"" - has E which is out
- ""ATOLL"" - but starts with T instead of A
- ""ABIOS"" - starts with A, has I and B

Actually, let me think more systematically. We need:
- A _ _ _ _
- Must contain O and S
- O cannot be in position 3
- S cannot be in position 4
- No R, no E

Possible structures:
- A S _ O _ (S in 2, O in 4)
- A _ S O _ (S in 3, O in 4)
- A _ _ S O (S in 4 - but this is invalid since S can't be in 4)
- A _ O S _ (O in 3 - invalid)
- A O _ S _ (O in 2, S in 4 - invalid)
- A _ _ _ O (no S)
- A S _ _ O (S in 2, O in 5)

Looking at common words:
- ""ASIDE"" has E which is out
- ""ALOUD"" has no S
- ""ABASE"" has E which is out
- ""ACORN"" has R which is out
- ""ADIOS"" has S in 4 which is invalid
- ""AGIOS"" has S in 4 invalid
- ""AMOS"" is 4 letters
- ""ABASE"" is invalid
- ""ACORN"" is invalid
- ""ADIEU"" has no S

Let me try ""ABIOS"" - starts with A, has B, I, O, S. O is in position 3 which we know is invalid, so this is bad.

""ALOUD"" has no S.

""ASIDE"" has E.

""ASSIST"" has S in 1 and 4 - but S can't be in 4.

""ATOLL"" has O in 3 invalid.

""AMONG"" has O in 3 invalid.

""AGONY"" has O in 3 invalid.

""ACORN"" has R invalid.

""ADORN"" has R invalid.

""ABOVE"" has E invalid.

""ABUSE"" has E invalid.

""ADIOS"" has S in 4 invalid.

""AGIOS"" has S in 4 invalid.

""ALOUD"" has no S.

""AMOUR"" has R invalid (but R isn't in AROSE, so maybe?)

Wait, let me re-examine AROSE feedback:
- A(✓) - correct in position 1
- R(x) - not in word
- O(-) - in word but not position 3
- S(-) - in word but not position 4
- E(x) - not in word

So we have:
A _ _ _ _
with O and S somewhere, but:
- O not in 3
- S not in 4

Possible positions for O: 2, 4, 5
Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5

Let me try ""ABOOS"" - but has two O's which might not be ideal.
- ""ABOOS"" - A B O O S. O is in 3 which is invalid
- ""ABSON"" - A B S O N. S is in 3, O in 4. This seems valid.

""ABSON"" uses:
- A(✓) known correct
- B new letter
- S in 3 (allowed)
- O in 4 (allowed)
- N new letter

This seems like a good second guess to test new letters and reposition O and S.

Another option could be ""ABOAT"" - but T isn't super common.

""ABSON"" seems best.

Alternatively ""ACORN"" is invalid (R out), ""ADORN"" (R out), ""AGORN"" (R out)

""ABSON"" it is then.Based on the feedback that A is correct in position 1, and O and S are in the word but in wrong positions (while R and E are not in the word), I'll try a word that repositions O and S and tests new common letters.

<guess>ABSON</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: ABSON -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) B(x) S(✓) O(✓) N(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. A is fixed in position 1: A _ _ _ _
2. S is in the word and is in position 3: A _ S _ _
3. O is in the word and is in position 4: A _ S O _
4. B and N are not in the word.
5. R, E are not in the word (from Guess 1).
6. Letters already confirmed: A, S, O.
7. Letters already ruled out: B, E, N, R.

We still need letters 2 and 5.  
Common remaining consonants: T, L, D, C, M, P, etc.  
Common remaining vowels: I, U.

Possible second-word forms: A _ S O _  
We can now guess a word that fills in those blanks:  
“ABASE” – but B is out; “ACORN” – R is out; “ADIOS” – I and D are both still possible.  
“ADIOS”” uses I (vowel) and D (consonant), neither of which has been ruled out yet.

So “ADIOS” is a valid next guess.

<guess>ADIOS</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: ABSON -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) B(x) S(✓) O(✓) N(x)
Guess 3: ADIOS -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) D(x) I(x) O(✓) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From all feedback so far:

1. A is locked in position 1: A _ _ _ _
2. S is in position 3: A _ S _ _
3. O is in position 4: A _ S O _
4. Letters ruled out: B, D, E, I, N, R
5. Still need letters 2 and 5.

Possible consonants left: C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, W, Y
Possible vowels left: U (since A, O are used and E, I are out)

The pattern is A _ S O _ with letters 2 and 5 to be filled.
Let’s list plausible endings:
- A F S O _ → AFOS_ (no common word)
- A C S O _ → ACOS_ (ACORN doesn’t fit, ACOS doesn’t extend)
- A G S O _ → AGOS_ (no)
- A H S O _ → AHOS_ (no)
- A L S O _ → ALOS_ (no)
- A M S O _ → AMOS_ (AMOS is 4 letters)
- A T S O _ → ATOS_ (no)
- A C S O T → ACOST (not a word)
- A C S O N → ACSON (not a word)
- A C S O K → AC Sok (not a word)
- A L S O M → ALSAM (not a word)
- A L S O T → ALSON (not a word)
- A L S O D → ALSDO (not a word)
- A L S O G → ALSOG (not a word)
- A L S O H → ALSOH (not a word)
- A L S O L → ALSEL (not a word)
- A L S O Y → ALSOY (not a word)
- A L S O F → ALSOF (not a word)
- A L S O C → ALSOC (not a word)
- A L S O P → ALSOP (not a word)
- A L S O B → ALSOB (not a word)
- A L S O M → ALSAM (not a word)
- A L S O G → ALSOG (not a word)

Wait, let me think differently. The pattern is A _ S O _. We need valid 5-letter words starting with A, having S in 3, O in 4, and ending with two allowed letters.

Real words fitting A _ S O _:
- ALOES – but E is out
- AFOUL – but F, U, L are still possible: A F U L? No, that’s 5 letters but A F U L doesn’t fit the pattern.
- AMISS – but S is already in 3 and we have S in 3, so double S is unlikely.
- ALOOF – but F is allowed, L is allowed, O is already placed.
- ALOOF – A L O O F. This has O in 3 which we know is invalid (from Guess 1: O(-) in AROSE means O is not in position 3). So ALOOF is invalid because O appears in position 3.

Next:
- AFOOT – but O is in 4, not 3
- ALOOF – invalid O position
- ALOES – invalid E
- ALOUT – U is allowed, T is allowed
- ALOUT – A L O U T. This fits:
  - A(✓) in 1
  - L new letter
  - O(✓) in 4
  - S(✓) in 3
  - U new vowel (only vowel left is U)
  - T new consonant

“ALOUT” isn’t a word, but “ALOUT” is. However, “ALOUT” is archaic; “ALLOT” has L twice but fits the pattern: A L O T. Wait, that’s 4 letters.

Actually, let me list all 5-letter words matching A _ S O _ and check:

- AFOOT – O in 3 invalid
- ALOOF – O in 3 invalid
- ALOES – E invalid
- ALOUT – 5 letters? A L O U T. Yes, this fits: A(✓) in 1, L new, O(✓) in 4, S(✓) in 3, U new, T new.

Another: AHOOT – no O in 4
AFOOT – no O in 4
AMOOT – no O in 4
APOOT – no O in 4

“ALOUT” isn’t valid.

“ALOUT” seems the only valid 5-letter word left matching the pattern.

But “ALOUT” is obscure. Maybe I missed?

Wait, let me think of “ALOUD” – but D is out.

“ALOOF” – invalid O position.

“ALOS_” – S already in 3.

“ALOUT” appears to be the only valid choice left.

But let me double-check: A L O U T
- A(✓) in 1
- L new
- O(✓) in 4
- S(✓) in 3
- U new vowel (only vowel left is U)
- T new consonant

This seems valid.

Therefore, next guess: ALOUT.

<guess>ALOUT</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Guess 3: ADIOS -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) D(x) I(x) O(✓) S(✓)
Guess 4: ALOUT -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(x) O(-) U(x) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let’s update what we now know after four guesses.

1. A is locked in position 1: A _ _ _ _
2. S is in position 3: A _ S _ _
3. O is in the word but NOT in position 4 (from Guess 4 feedback: O(-) in ALOUT).  
   Yet in Guess 2 we thought O was in position 4 (✓ in ABSON).  
   This is a contradiction!  
   The only way both can be true is if the feedback for Guess 4 was mis-recorded.  
   Assuming the ABSON feedback (O(✓) in position 4) stands, we must treat O as definitely in position 4.

Therefore the pattern is:
A _ S O _

Letters already ruled out:
B, D, E, I, L, N, R, T, U

Letters still allowed: C, F, G, H, K, M, P, W, Y plus any other consonants/vowels not yet excluded.

We need a 5-letter word of the form A _ S O _ using only allowed letters.

Real words fitting this pattern:
- AFOOT – O in 4, S in 3, but T is out
- AGROS – R out
- AMEOS – E out
- APSES – S in 3 but second S is invalid (no info on double S, but let’s check others)
- ALOES – E out
- AFOUL – U out, F, L, U out
- AHOOT – O in 3 invalid
- AFOOT – O in 3 invalid
- AHOOT – invalid O position
- AGONY – N out
- ALOOF – O in 3 invalid
- AMISS – S in 3 but double S issue
- AFOUL – U out
- AHOOT – invalid O position

Looking more carefully, the only common 5-letter word matching A _ S O _ with allowed letters seems to be:

AFOOT – but has T (out)
AHOOT – has H, O in 3 invalid
AGROS – R out
AMSES – S in 3 but second S is invalid
APSES – same issue

Actually, let me check “AMISS” – but S is in 3, O in 4, but it’s A M I S S. We have no info on I, but let’s see:

A M I S S:
- A(✓) in 1
- M new
- I new (possible)
- S in 3 (✓)
- S in 5 (possible, no info against it)

But we have no contradiction preventing double S.  
“AMISS” is a valid 5-letter word.

Another candidate: “ACROS” – but R out.
“ACORN” – R out.
“ACOST” – T out.
“AGAST” – T out.
“AGONY” – N out.
“AGLOW” – W allowed, L out
“AGREE” – E out
“AGUES” – E out

“AMISS” seems the only plausible remaining word.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.\n\nAnother strong option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A is in the correct first position (✓)\n- R is not in the word at all (x)\n- O is in the word but not in position 3 (-)\n- S is in the word but not in position 4 (-)\n- E is not in the word at all (x)\n\nSo we know:\n1. The word starts with A\n2. It contains O and S, but O is not in position 3 and S is not in position 4\n3. It does NOT contain R or E\n\nGood next letters to test would be common consonants and vowels not yet ruled out. Since we\'ve eliminated R and E, we might want to test other vowels (I, U) and common consonants (T, N, L, etc.).\n\nA strong second guess would be something like ""ADIOS"" - it keeps the A we know is correct, and tests D, I, O, S. The O is in position 3 here, but we know from feedback that O can\'t be in position 3, so this would actually be bad. Let me think of a better option.\n\nBetter options might be:\n- ""ALOES"" - but this has E which we know is out\n- ""ASIDE"" - has E which is out\n- ""ATOLL"" - but starts with T instead of A\n- ""ABIOS"" - starts with A, has I and B\n\nActually, let me think more systematically.

Let’s update the state after five guesses.

Known facts:
1. A is fixed in position 1: A _ _ _ _
2. S is in the word and must appear in position 3 (from Guess 2: S(✓) in ABSON)  
   → contradiction with Guess 5 feedback (S(-) in AMISS)  
   Therefore the S(✓) from ABSON stands: S is in position 3 and remains so.

3. O is in the word and must be in position 4 (from Guess 2: O(✓) in ABSON)  
   → contradiction with Guess 4 feedback (O(-) in ALOUT)  
   Therefore the O(✓) from ABSON stands: O is in position 4 and remains so.

4. Letters definitely out: B, D, E, I, L, N, R, T, U, M  
   (from all feedback: B, D, E, I, L, N, R, T, U, M are all marked x or ✓ for other letters)

5. Pattern so far: A _ S O _

6. Still need letters 2 and 5 from the remaining alphabet:
   Remaining consonants: C, F, G, H, K, P, W, Y  
   Remaining vowels: none (A, O used, E, I, U out)

Hence the second and fifth letters must be chosen from {C, F, G, H, K, P, W, Y}.  
We need a valid 5-letter word of the form A ? S O ?

Scanning the dictionary list of A _ S O _:

- AFOOT – T out
- AGROS – R out  
- AMOS – too short
- AHOOT – O in 3 invalid
- AFOUL – U, L out
- APSES – second S invalid (no info preventing double S, but let’s see others)
- AFOOT – T out
- AGLOW – L out
- AGREE – E out
- AGUSH – H allowed, but second S invalid
- AGUES – E out
- AGOST – T out
- AGONY – N out
- AGREE – E out
- AGLOW – L out
- AGUSH – valid 5-letter word: A G S H

Check letters: G and H are still allowed.

Thus “AGUSH” fits the pattern A _ S O _ and only uses allowed letters.

Therefore, next guess: AGUSH.
