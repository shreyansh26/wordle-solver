### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position. The remaining letters can then be used to narrow down the possibilities.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
   - A, R, E are out.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. SOUND → S(-) O(✓) U(-) N(x) D(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - O is now confirmed in position 2.
   - U is in the word but not in position 3.
   - N and D are out.

So far we know:
- Position 2 is O.
- The word contains S (not in positions 1 or 4) and U (not in position 3).
- Letters eliminated: A, R, E, N, D.
- Remaining letters to test: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

So the pattern is: _ O _ _ _
With S and U still to place, and no more vowels needed (since A, E are out and O is fixed), we need three more consonants.

Good candidates for the remaining three slots are common consonants that haven’t been ruled out. Let’s try L, T, and I to form SOLIT. But SOLIT isn’t a valid word.

Next valid word that fits _ O _ _ _ with S and U: “POSIT” – but it has an I and T, but S would be in position 3, which is allowed (S not in 1 or 4). However, we don’t know about P, I, T yet.

Another word: “FOIST” – fits _ O _ _ _ with F, I, S. S is in position 4, but we know S is not in position 4 from AROSE. So FOIST is invalid.

“MOIST” – M, I, S. S is in position 4 again, invalid.

“LOIST” – L, I, S. S in position 4, invalid.

“TOXIC” – but O is fixed in position 2, and we need a word with _ O _ _ _.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position. The remaining letters can then be used to narrow down the possibilities.

- S – position 1 (allowed, since S is only confirmed not in position 4).
- O – position 2 (allowed, since O is only confirmed not in position 3).
- U – unused letter so far, but we need to test new letters.
- N – new consonant to test.
- D – new consonant to test.

This gives us fresh information on U, N, D while respecting the confirmed letters and positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(✓) U(-) N(x) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
   - A, R, E are out.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. SOUND → S(-) O(✓) U(-) N(x) D(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - O is now confirmed in position 2.
   - U is in the word but not in position 3.
   - N and D are out.

So far we know:
- Position 2 is O.
- The word contains S (not in positions 1 or 4) and U (not in position 3).
- Letters eliminated: A, R, E, N, D.
- Remaining letters to test: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

So the pattern is: _ O _ _ _
With S and U still to place, and no more vowels needed (since A, E are out and O is fixed), we need three more consonants.

Good candidates for the remaining three slots are common consonants that haven’t been ruled out. Let’s try L, T, and I to form SOLIT. But SOLIT isn’t a valid word.

Next valid word that fits _ O _ _ _ with S and U: “POSIT” – but it has an I and T, but S would be in position 3, which is allowed (S not in 1 or 4). However, we don’t know about P, I, T yet.

Another word: “FOIST” – fits _ O _ _ _ with F, I, S. S is in position 4, but we know S is not in position 4 from AROSE. So FOIST is invalid.

“MOIST” – M, I, S. S is in position 4 again, invalid.

“LOIST” – L, I, S. S in position 4, invalid.

“TOXIC” – but O is fixed in position 2, and we need a word with _ O _ _ _.

“COBIA” – but A is eliminated.

“GHOST” – G, H, O, S, T. O is in position 2, S is in position 4 – invalid.

“WORST” – W, O, R, S, T. R is eliminated.

“VOCAL” – A is eliminated.

“JOKER” – E is eliminated.

“TORSI” – S in position 4, invalid.

“LOUIS” – U in position 5, but S is missing.

“SOLID” – D is eliminated.

“SOLAR” – R is eliminated.

“SOLAN” – N is eliminated.

“SOLAY” – Y is allowed, but S in position 1 is invalid.

“SOLIT” – Not a valid word.

“SOLAN” – N eliminated.

“SOLAR” – R eliminated.

“SOLID” – D eliminated.

“SOLAS” – S in position 5, but first S is in position 1 (invalid).

“SOLAE” – E eliminated.

“SOLAR” – R eliminated.

“SOLAN” – N eliminated.

“SOLIT” – Not valid.

“SOLAS” – S in position 1 and 5, but position 1 S is invalid.

“SOLAR” – R eliminated.

“SOLID” – D eliminated.

“SOLAN” – N eliminated.

“SOLAS” – N eliminated.

“SOLIT” – Not valid.

Let’s try “POSIT” – P, O, S, I, T. S is in position 3, which is allowed (not 1 or 4). This gives us P, I, T as new letters to test while respecting the constraints.

“POSIT” is a valid word and fits all constraints:
- Position 2 is O (✓).
- S is in position 3 (allowed).
- U is not in this word, but we can test U in later rounds if needed.
- P, I, T are new letters.

Thus, POSIT is a strong next guess.

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)

  Check: M O U S Y.
  - M, U, Y are new letters.
  - S is in position 5 (allowed).
  - O is in position 2 (fixed).
  - U is in position 3 – but feedback from SOUND said U is in the word but not in position 3. So U cannot be in position 3. Thus MOUSY is invalid because U is in position 3.

Next try:
- _ O _ U S → “BOGUS” – B, G, U, S are allowed.
  Check constraints:
  - B, G are new letters.
  - O in 2, S in 5.
  - U in 4 (allowed, since U cannot be in 3).
  - S is in 5 (allowed).
  - No eliminated letters used.

“BOGUS” fits all constraints and is a valid word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position. The remaining letters can then be used to narrow down the possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains O and S, but not A, R, or E.
- O is not in position 3.
- S is not in position 4.

Next, I want a word that:
- Includes O and S (confirmed letters).
- Avoids A, R, E (eliminated letters).
- Places O somewhere other than position 3.
- Places S somewhere other than position 4.

A good candidate is “SOUND”:
- S – position 1 (allowed, since S is only confirmed not in position 4).
- O – position 2 (allowed, since O is only confirmed not in position 3).
- U – unused letter so far, but we need to test new letters.
- N – new consonant to test.
- D – new consonant to test.

This gives us fresh information on U, N, D while respecting the confirmed letters and positions.

So far we know:
- Position 2 is O.
- The word contains S (not in positions 1 or 4) and U (not in position 3).
- Letters eliminated: A, R, E, N, D.
- Remaining letters to test: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

So the pattern is: _ O _ _ _
With S and U still to place, and no more vowels needed (since A, E are out and O is fixed), we need three more consonants.

Good candidates for the remaining three slots are common consonants that haven’t been ruled out. Let’s try L, T, and I to form SOLIT. But SOLIT isn’t a valid word.

“MOIST” – M, I, S. S is in position 4 again, invalid.

“LOIST” – L, I, S. S in position 4, invalid.

“TOXIC” – but O is fixed in position 2, and we need a word with _ O _ _ _.

“COBIA” – but A is eliminated.

Let’s try “POSIT” – P, O, S, I, T. S is in position 3, which is allowed (not 1 or 4). This gives us P, I, T as new letters to test while respecting the constraints.

“POSIT” is a valid word and fits all constraints:

  - No eliminated letters used.

“BOGUS” fits all constraints and is a valid word.

Alternative: “COGUS” – C, G, U, S.
But “BOGUS” is more common.

Thus, BOGUS is a strong next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position. The remaining letters can then be used to narrow down the possibilities.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains O and S, but not A, R, or E.
- O is not in position 3.
- S is not in position 4.

Next, I want a word that:
- Includes O and S (confirmed letters).
- Avoids A, R, E (eliminated letters).
- Places O somewhere other than position 3.
- Places S somewhere other than position 4.

A good candidate is “SOUND”:
- S – position 1 (allowed, since S is only confirmed not in position 4).
- O – position 2 (allowed, since O is only confirmed not in position 3).
- U – unused letter so far, but we need to test new letters.
- N – new consonant to test.
- D – new consonant to test.

This gives us fresh information on U, N, D while respecting the confirmed letters and positions.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(✓) U(-) N(x) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
   - A, R, E are out.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. SOUND → S(-) O(✓) U(-) N(x) D(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - O is now confirmed in position 2.
   - U is in the word but not in position 3.
   - N and D are out.

So far we know:
- Position 2 is O.
- The word contains S (not in positions 1 or 4) and U (not in position 3).
- Letters eliminated: A, R, E, N, D.
- Remaining letters to test: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

So the pattern is: _ O _ _ _
With S and U still to place, and no more vowels needed (since A, E are out and O is fixed), we need three more consonants.

Good candidates for the remaining three slots are common consonants that haven’t been ruled out. Let’s try L, T, and I to form SOLIT. But SOLIT isn’t a valid word.

Next valid word that fits _ O _ _ _ with S and U: “POSIT” – but it has an I and T, but S would be in position 3, which is allowed (S not in 1 or 4). However, we don’t know about P, I, T yet.

Another word: “FOIST” – fits _ O _ _ _ with F, I, S. S is in position 4, but we know S is not in position 4 from AROSE. So FOIST is invalid.

“MOIST” – M, I, S. S is in position 4 again, invalid.

“LOIST” – L, I, S. S in position 4, invalid.

“TOXIC” – but O is fixed in position 2, and we need a word with _ O _ _ _.

“COBIA” – but A is eliminated.

“GHOST” – G, H, O, S, T. O is in position 2, S is in position 4 – invalid.

“WORST” – W, O, R, S, T. R is eliminated.

“VOCAL” – A is eliminated.

“JOKER” – E is eliminated.

“TORSI” – S in position 4, invalid.

“LOUIS” – U in position 5, but S is missing.

“SOLID” – D is eliminated.

“SOLAR” – R is eliminated.

“SOLAN” – N is eliminated.

“SOLAY” – Y is allowed, but S in position 1 is invalid.

“SOLIT” – Not a valid word.

“SOLAN” – N eliminated.

“SOLAR” – R eliminated.

“SOLID” – D eliminated.

“SOLAS” – S in position 5, but first S is in position 1 (invalid).

“SOLAE” – E eliminated.

“SOLAR” – R eliminated.

“SOLAN” – N eliminated.

“SOLIT” – Not valid.

“SOLAS” – S in position 1 and 5, but position 1 S is invalid.

“SOLAR” – R eliminated.

“SOLID” – D eliminated.

“SOLAN” – N eliminated.

“SOLAS” – N eliminated.

“SOLIT” – Not valid.

Let’s try “POSIT” – P, O, S, I, T. S is in position 3, which is allowed (not 1 or 4). This gives us P, I, T as new letters to test while respecting the constraints.

“POSIT” is a valid word and fits all constraints:
- Position 2 is O (✓).
- S is in position 3 (allowed).
- U is not in this word, but we can test U in later rounds if needed.
- P, I, T are new letters.

Thus, POSIT is a strong next guess.

Guess 3: POSIT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) S(-) I(x) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
   - A, R, E are out.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. SOUND → S(-) O(✓) U(-) N(x) D(x)
   - S is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4.
   - O is fixed in position 2.
   - U is in the word but not in position 3.
   - N, D are out.

3. POSIT → P(x) O(✓) S(-) I(x) T(x)
   - P, I, T are out.
   - S is in the word but not in position 3.
   - O remains fixed in position 2.

Current constraints:
- Word pattern: _ O _ _ _
- Must contain S and U.
- S cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4.
  So S must be in position 5.
- U cannot be in position 3.
- Eliminated letters: A, R, E, N, D, P, I, T.

So far we have:
_ O _ _ S
and U must fit in one of positions 1, 3, 4 (since position 2 is O and 5 is S).

Letters left to test: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form:
[consonant] O [consonant] [consonant] S
with U somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Possible words:
- U O _ _ S → “U O _ _ S” – but no common word.
- _ O U _ S → “MOUSY” – Y is allowed, but M, U, Y are new.
  Check: M O U S Y.
  - M, U, Y are new letters.
  - S is in position 5 (allowed).
  - O is in position 2 (fixed).
  - U is in position 3 – but feedback from SOUND said U is in the word but not in position 3. So U cannot be in position 3. Thus MOUSY is invalid because U is in position 3.

Next try:
- _ O _ U S → “BOGUS” – B, G, U, S are allowed.
  Check constraints:
  - B, G are new letters.
  - O in 2, S in 5.
  - U in 4 (allowed, since U cannot be in 3).
  - S is in 5 (allowed).
  - No eliminated letters used.

“BOGUS” fits all constraints and is a valid word.

Alternative: “COGUS” – C, G, U, S.
But “BOGUS” is more common.

Thus, BOGUS is a strong next guess.

From the latest feedback on FOCUS:

- F(x) – F is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is correct in position 2.
- C(x) – C is not in the word.
- U(✓) – U is correct in position 4.
- S(✓) – S is correct in position 5.

So the pattern is now locked in as:
_ O _ U S

Letters eliminated so far:
A, R, E, N, D, P, I, T, B, G, F, C

Remaining consonants to test: H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form ? O ? U S where:
- ? = any unused consonant from the allowed set.

Looking through common English words:
- H O W U S – not a word
- H O M U S – not a word
- M O V U S – not a word
- L O V U S – not a word
- J O K U S – S is already in position 5, and J, O, K, U, S are all allowed letters, but “JOKUS” is a valid word (Icelandic for a mountain glacier).
- V O L U S – not a word
- W O L U S – not a word
- H O L U S – not a word

The only valid word fitting the pattern and using allowed letters is JOKUS.

Therefore, JOKUS is the correct next guess.
