### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us maximum information about letter presence in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.

- O(x) – O is NOT in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So we know:
- Letters to keep: R, S, E (they appear in the secret word, but not in the positions tried).
- Letters to avoid in the next guess: A, O.
- Positions to avoid for R, S, E:
  – R cannot be in position 2.
  – S cannot be in position 4.
  – E cannot be in position 5.

A good next guess should:
1. Re-use R, S, E in new positions.
2. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tested yet.
3. Avoid A and O.

Candidate words:
- “TRIES” – uses T (new), I (new), E (repositioned), S (repositioned), R (repositioned).
- “STERN” – uses S, T, E, R, N (but N hasn’t been tested yet).
- “REINS” – uses R, E, I, N, S (but S would be in position 5, which is allowed).

“TRIES” looks good because it moves all known letters (R, E, S) to new positions and adds T and I, which are common and haven’t been tested.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)

   - R is in the word, but not in position 2.
   - S is in the word, but not in position 4.
   - E is in the word, but not in position 5.

2. TRIES → T(x) R(-) I(x) E(-) S(-)
   - T and I are not in the word.
   - R is still not in position 2 (confirmed).
   - E is still not in position 5 (confirmed).
   - S is still not in position 4 (confirmed).

Known letters that must appear: R, S, E  
Known letters that must NOT appear: A, O, T, I  
Positions we now know to avoid:
- R ≠ 2
- S ≠ 4
- E ≠ 5

We need a 5-letter word that contains R, S, E once each, excludes A, O, T, I, and respects the positional exclusions.

Let’s look for a word with:
- R somewhere other than position 2
- S somewhere other than position 4
- E somewhere other than position 5

Possible remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Possible vowels: only E is confirmed; others could be U, Y

Candidate words:
- “SNEER” – has S, N, E, E, R → but E appears twice, and we don’t know if double-E is allowed. Also, R is in position 5 here, which is allowed but let’s check others.
- “CREST” – has C, R, E, S, T → but T is excluded.
- “DRESS” – has D, R, E, S, S → double S; S is allowed but position 4 is excluded for S, so okay.
- “PRESS” – P, R, E, S, S → double S again.
- “BURNS” – B, U, R, N, S → R in position 3 (allowed), S in position 5 (allowed), E missing → not ideal.
- “SHEER” – S, H, E, E, R → double E again.
- “PERCH” – P, E, R, C, H → misses S.
- “FRESH” – F, R, E, S, H → R in position 2 (disallowed).
- “DRESS” already considered.

A better choice might be “DRESS” even with double S, because:
- Contains R (position 2 is forbidden, but here R is in position 2 – oops, forbidden).
Wait, in “DRESS” R is in position 2, which is forbidden.

Next candidate: “SHEET” – S, H, E, E, T → T excluded.

“SWEER” – S, W, E, E, R → double E again.

“SPEAR” – P is new, but S is in position 1 (allowed), E in position 3 (allowed), R in position 4 (allowed). Letters: S, P, E, A, R → but A is excluded.

“SHER” – too short.

“SHELF” – misses E.

“CREST” – T excluded.

“PRESS” – double S, but S in position 4 is forbidden.

“DUNCE” – misses S.

“SURGE” – misses E.

“FURER” – misses S.

“HUMPS” – misses E.

“BURNS” – B, U, R, N, S → R in position 3 (allowed), S in position 5 (allowed), E missing → not ideal.

“CURER” – C, U, R, E, R → double R, but R is allowed once. R in position 3 (allowed), E in position 4 (allowed), S missing → not ideal.

“NERVE” – N, E, R, V, E → double E.

“VERGE” – misses S.

“WORSE” – O excluded.

“HORSE” – O excluded.

“FUROR” – O excluded.

“CURVY” – misses E.

“SURGE” – misses E.

“PERKY” – misses E.

“FRESH” – R in position 2 (forbidden).

“CREST” – T excluded.

“DRESS” – R in position 2 (forbidden).

“SHEET” – R in position 2 (forbidden).

“SWEER” – R in position 5 (allowed), E in position 3 (allowed), S in position 1 (allowed). Letters: S, W, E, E, R → double E is acceptable since we don’t know if double-E is allowed, but let’s avoid it for now.

“SHEER” – double E.

“SPEAR” – A excluded.

“SHELF” – misses E.

“SHRED” – D is new, R in position 3 (allowed), E in position 2 (allowed), S in position 1 (allowed). Letters: S, H, R, E, D → no A, O, T, I. This looks good.

Let’s choose “SHRED”.

Check:

1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us maximum information about letter presence in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- O(x) – O is NOT in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters to keep: R, S, E (they appear in the secret word, but not in the positions tried).
- Letters to avoid in the next guess: A, O.
- Positions to avoid for R, S, E:
  – R cannot be in position 2.
  – S cannot be in position 4.
  – E cannot be in position 5.

A good next guess should:
1. Re-use R, S, E in new positions.
2. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tested yet.
3. Avoid A and O.

Candidate words:
- “TRIES” – uses T (new), I (new), E (repositioned), S (repositioned), R (repositioned).
- “STERN” – uses S, T, E, R, N (but N hasn’t been tested yet).
- “REINS” – uses R, E, I, N, S (but S would be in position 5, which is allowed).

“TRIES” looks good because it moves all known letters (R, E, S) to new positions and adds T and I, which are common and haven’t been tested.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: TRIES -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) I(x) E(-) S(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - A and O are not in the word at all.
   - R is in the word, but not in position 2.
   - S is in the word, but not in position 4.
   - E is in the word, but not in position 5.

2. TRIES → T(x) R(-) I(x) E(-) S(-)
   - T and I are not in the word.
   - R is still not in position 2 (confirmed).
   - E is still not in position 5 (confirmed).
   - S is still not in position 4 (confirmed).

Known letters that must appear: R, S, E  
Known letters that must NOT appear: A, O, T, I  
Positions we now know to avoid:
- R ≠ 2
- S ≠ 4
- E ≠ 5

We need a 5-letter word that contains R, S, E once each, excludes A, O, T, I, and respects the positional exclusions.

Let’s look for a word with:
- R somewhere other than position 2
- S somewhere other than position 4
- E somewhere other than position 5

Possible remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Possible vowels: only E is confirmed; others could be U, Y

Candidate words:
- “SNEER” – has S, N, E, E, R → but E appears twice, and we don’t know if double-E is allowed. Also, R is in position 5 here, which is allowed but let’s check others.
- “CREST” – has C, R, E, S, T → but T is excluded.
- “DRESS” – has D, R, E, S, S → double S; S is allowed but position 4 is excluded for S, so okay.
- “PRESS” – P, R, E, S, S → double S again.
- “BURNS” – B, U, R, N, S → R in position 3 (allowed), S in position 5 (allowed), E missing → not ideal.
- “SHEER” – S, H, E, E, R → double E again.
- “PERCH” – P, E, R, C, H → misses S.
- “FRESH” – F, R, E, S, H → R in position 2 (disallowed).
- “DRESS” already considered.

A better choice might be “DRESS” even with double S, because:
- Contains R (position 2 is forbidden, but here R is in position 2 – oops, forbidden).
Wait, in “DRESS” R is in position 2, which is forbidden.

Next candidate: “SHEET” – S, H, E, E, T → T excluded.

“SWEER” – S, W, E, E, R → double E again.

“SPEAR” – P is new, but S is in position 1 (allowed), E in position 3 (allowed), R in position 4 (allowed). Letters: S, P, E, A, R → but A is excluded.

“SHER” – too short.

“SHELF” – misses E.

“CREST” – T excluded.

“PRESS” – double S, but S in position 4 is forbidden.

“DUNCE” – misses S.

“SURGE” – misses E.

“FURER” – misses S.

“HUMPS” – misses E.

“BURNS” – B, U, R, N, S → R in position 3 (allowed), S in position 5 (allowed), E missing → not ideal.

“CURER” – C, U, R, E, R → double R, but R is allowed once. R in position 3 (allowed), E in position 4 (allowed), S missing → not ideal.

“NERVE” – N, E, R, V, E → double E.

“VERGE” – misses S.

“WORSE” – O excluded.

“HORSE” – O excluded.

“FUROR” – O excluded.

“CURVY” – misses E.

“SURGE” – misses E.

“PERKY” – misses E.

“FRESH” – R in position 2 (forbidden).

“CREST” – T excluded.

“DRESS” – R in position 2 (forbidden).

“SHEET” – R in position 2 (forbidden).

“SWEER” – R in position 5 (allowed), E in position 3 (allowed), S in position 1 (allowed). Letters: S, W, E, E, R → double E is acceptable since we don’t know if double-E is allowed, but let’s avoid it for now.

“SHEER” – double E.

“SPEAR” – A excluded.

“SHELF” – misses E.

“SHRED” – D is new, R in position 3 (allowed), E in position 2 (allowed), S in position 1 (allowed). Letters: S, H, R, E, D → no A, O, T, I. This looks good.

Let’s choose “SHRED”.

Check:
- S in position 1 (allowed)
- H (new)
- R in position 3 (allowed)
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- D (new)
No forbidden letters.

This seems optimal.

From the new feedback on SHRED:

- R(✓) – R is in the word and in the correct position 3.
- E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- D(x) – D is NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Word structure: S _ R _ _
- Letters that must appear: S, R, E
- Letters that must NOT appear: A, O, T, I, H, D
- E cannot be in position 4 (from SHRED) or 5 (from earlier rounds).

Possible remaining letters (excluding the banned ones):
Vowels: only E is confirmed; U, Y could be possible.
Consonants: B, C, F, G, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to fill positions 2 and 5 with letters from the allowed set, such that E is used once and not in positions 4 or 5. Since position 3 is R, E must be in position 2 or 5, but:
- Position 5 is allowed for E (only position 4 and 5 were excluded for E in earlier guesses, but wait: in AROSE E was excluded from position 5, and in TRIES E was excluded from position 5. In SHRED E was excluded from position 4. So E can be in position 2 or 5.)

But in SHRED, E was in position 4 (excluded), so E cannot be in position 4. From earlier:
- In AROSE E was in position 5 (excluded)
- In TRIES E was in position 4 (excluded)
- In SHRED E was in position 4 (excluded)

So E is excluded from positions 4 and 5. Therefore E must be in position 2.

Thus the word structure is: S E R _ _

Now we need to fill position 5 with a letter that:
- Is not any of A, O, T, I, H, D
- Is not S, R, E (already used)
- Is not any of the letters we haven't used yet (B, C, F, G, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)

Common letters left: B, C, F, G, K, L, M, N, P, U, Y

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form S E R _ _.

Possible words:
- SERFS
- SERRA (invalid, A excluded)
- SERGE (but G is allowed)
- SERFS – S E R F S – but S is already in position 1, and can't be in position 5 (no restriction yet), but double S is possible.
- SWORD (but O is excluded)
- SHERS – H excluded
- SKEET – T excluded
- SNEER – N, E, E, R – double E
- SPERM – M allowed, P allowed, but M and P not tested yet.
- SERFS – F and S are allowed.

Let's check SERFS:
- S E R F S
- Position 2: E (allowed, since E must be in position 2)
- Position 3: R (correct)
- Position 4: F (new, allowed)
- Position 5: S (allowed, S can be in position 5)
- No banned letters.

This seems valid.

Another option: SERGE:

Another: SERPS – but P and S allowed, but S in position 5 is allowed, but double S.

Another: SWORD – O excluded.

Another: SNAKY – misses E.

Another: SNEER – E in position 2 and 4, but 4 is excluded for E.

Another: SKEER – K, E, E, R – double E.

Another: SPERM – E in position 2, R in 3, M and P new.

SPERM seems valid:
- S P E R M
- S in 1 (correct), E in 2 (allowed), R in 3 (correct), P and M new and allowed.

Let's choose SPERM.

We need to fill positions 2 and 5 with letters from the allowed set, such that E is used once and not in positions 4 or 5. Since position 3 is R, E must be in position 2 or 5, but:
- Position 5 is allowed for E (only position 4 and 5 were excluded for E in earlier guesses, but wait: in AROSE E was excluded from position 5, and in TRIES E was excluded from position 5. In SHRED E was excluded from position 4. So E can be in position 2 or 5.)

But in SHRED, E was in position 4 (excluded), so E cannot be in position 4. From earlier:
- In AROSE E was in position 5 (excluded)
- In TRIES E was in position 4 (excluded)
- In SHRED E was in position 4 (excluded)

So E is excluded from positions 4 and 5. Therefore E must be in position 2.

Thus the word structure is: S E R _ _

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us maximum information about letter presence in the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- O(x) – O is NOT in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters to keep: R, S, E (they appear in the secret word, but not in the positions tried).
- Letters to avoid in the next guess: A, O.
- Positions to avoid for R, S, E:
  – R cannot be in position 2.
  – S cannot be in position 4.
  – E cannot be in position 5.

A good next guess should:
1. Re-use R, S, E in new positions.
2. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tested yet.
3. Avoid A and O.

Candidate words:
- “TRIES” – uses T (new), I (new), E (repositioned), S (repositioned), R (repositioned).
- “STERN” – uses S, T, E, R, N (but N hasn’t been tested yet).
- “REINS” – uses R, E, I, N, S (but S would be in position 5, which is allowed).

“TRIES” looks good because it moves all known letters (R, E, S) to new positions and adds T and I, which are common and haven’t been tested.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: TRIES -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) I(x) E(-) S(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - A and O are not in the word at all.
   - R is in the word, but not in position 2.
   - S is in the word, but not in position 4.
   - E is in the word, but not in position 5.

2. TRIES → T(x) R(-) I(x) E(-) S(-)
   - T and I are not in the word.
   - R is still not in position 2 (confirmed).
   - E is still not in position 5 (confirmed).
   - S is still not in position 4 (confirmed).

Known letters that must appear: R, S, E  
Known letters that must NOT appear: A, O, T, I  
Positions we now know to avoid:
- R ≠ 2
- S ≠ 4
- E ≠ 5

We need a 5-letter word that contains R, S, E once each, excludes A, O, T, I, and respects the positional exclusions.

Let’s look for a word with:
- R somewhere other than position 2
- S somewhere other than position 4
- E somewhere other than position 5

Possible remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Possible vowels: only E is confirmed; others could be U, Y

Candidate words:
- “SNEER” – has S, N, E, E, R → but E appears twice, and we don’t know if double-E is allowed. Also, R is in position 5 here, which is allowed but let’s check others.
- “CREST” – has C, R, E, S, T → but T is excluded.
- “DRESS” – has D, R, E, S, S → double S; S is allowed but position 4 is excluded for S, so okay.
- “PRESS” – P, R, E, S, S → double S again.
- “BURNS” – B, U, R, N, S → R in position 3 (allowed), S in position 5 (allowed), E missing → not ideal.
- “SHEER” – S, H, E, E, R → double E again.
- “PERCH” – P, E, R, C, H → misses S.
- “FRESH” – F, R, E, S, H → R in position 2 (disallowed).
- “DRESS” already considered.

A better choice might be “DRESS” even with double S, because:
- Contains R (position 2 is forbidden, but here R is in position 2 – oops, forbidden).
Wait, in “DRESS” R is in position 2, which is forbidden.

Next candidate: “SHEET” – S, H, E, E, T → T excluded.

“SWEER” – S, W, E, E, R → double E again.

“SPEAR” – P is new, but S is in position 1 (allowed), E in position 3 (allowed), R in position 4 (allowed). Letters: S, P, E, A, R → but A is excluded.

“SHER” – too short.

“SHELF” – misses E.

“CREST” – T excluded.

“PRESS” – double S, but S in position 4 is forbidden.

“DUNCE” – misses S.

“SURGE” – misses E.

“FURER” – misses S.

“HUMPS” – misses E.

“BURNS” – B, U, R, N, S → R in position 3 (allowed), S in position 5 (allowed), E missing → not ideal.

“CURER” – C, U, R, E, R → double R, but R is allowed once. R in position 3 (allowed), E in position 4 (allowed), S missing → not ideal.

“NERVE” – N, E, R, V, E → double E.

“VERGE” – misses S.

“WORSE” – O excluded.

“HORSE” – O excluded.

“FUROR” – O excluded.

“CURVY” – misses E.

“SURGE” – misses E.

“PERKY” – misses E.

“FRESH” – R in position 2 (forbidden).

“CREST” – T excluded.

“DRESS” – R in position 2 (forbidden).

“SHEET” – R in position 2 (forbidden).

“SWEER” – R in position 5 (allowed), E in position 3 (allowed), S in position 1 (allowed). Letters: S, W, E, E, R → double E is acceptable since we don’t know if double-E is allowed, but let’s avoid it for now.

“SHEER” – double E.

“SPEAR” – A excluded.

“SHELF” – misses E.

“SHRED” – D is new, R in position 3 (allowed), E in position 2 (allowed), S in position 1 (allowed). Letters: S, H, R, E, D → no A, O, T, I. This looks good.

Let’s choose “SHRED”.

Check:
- S in position 1 (allowed)
- H (new)
- R in position 3 (allowed)
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- D (new)
No forbidden letters.

This seems optimal.

<guess>SHRED</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: TRIES -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) I(x) E(-) S(-)
Guess 3: SHRED -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) R(✓) E(-) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on SHRED:
- S(✓) – S is in the word and in the correct position 1.
- H(x) – H is NOT in the word.
- R(✓) – R is in the word and in the correct position 3.
- E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- D(x) – D is NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Word structure: S _ R _ _
- Letters that must appear: S, R, E
- Letters that must NOT appear: A, O, T, I, H, D
- E cannot be in position 4 (from SHRED) or 5 (from earlier rounds).

Possible remaining letters (excluding the banned ones):
Vowels: only E is confirmed; U, Y could be possible.
Consonants: B, C, F, G, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to fill positions 2 and 5 with letters from the allowed set, such that E is used once and not in positions 4 or 5. Since position 3 is R, E must be in position 2 or 5, but:
- Position 5 is allowed for E (only position 4 and 5 were excluded for E in earlier guesses, but wait: in AROSE E was excluded from position 5, and in TRIES E was excluded from position 5. In SHRED E was excluded from position 4. So E can be in position 2 or 5.)

But in SHRED, E was in position 4 (excluded), so E cannot be in position 4. From earlier:
- In AROSE E was in position 5 (excluded)
- In TRIES E was in position 4 (excluded)
- In SHRED E was in position 4 (excluded)

So E is excluded from positions 4 and 5. Therefore E must be in position 2.

Thus the word structure is: S E R _ _

Now we need to fill position 5 with a letter that:
- Is not any of A, O, T, I, H, D
- Is not S, R, E (already used)
- Is not any of the letters we haven't used yet (B, C, F, G, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)

Common letters left: B, C, F, G, K, L, M, N, P, U, Y

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form S E R _ _.

Possible words:
- SERFS
- SERRA (invalid, A excluded)
- SERGE (but G is allowed)
- SERFS – S E R F S – but S is already in position 1, and can't be in position 5 (no restriction yet), but double S is possible.
- SWORD (but O is excluded)
- SHERS – H excluded
- SKEET – T excluded
- SNEER – N, E, E, R – double E
- SPERM – M allowed, P allowed, but M and P not tested yet.
- SERFS – F and S are allowed.

Let's check SERFS:
- S E R F S
- Position 2: E (allowed, since E must be in position 2)
- Position 3: R (correct)
- Position 4: F (new, allowed)
- Position 5: S (allowed, S can be in position 5)
- No banned letters.

This seems valid.

Another option: SERGE:
- S E R G E
- G is allowed, E in position 2 and 5 – but E can't be in 5 (from AROSE and TRIES). So invalid.

Another: SERPS – but P and S allowed, but S in position 5 is allowed, but double S.

Another: SWORD – O excluded.

Another: SNAKY – misses E.

Another: SNEER – E in position 2 and 4, but 4 is excluded for E.

Another: SKEER – K, E, E, R – double E.

Another: SPERM – E in position 2, R in 3, M and P new.

SPERM seems valid:
- S P E R M
- S in 1 (correct), E in 2 (allowed), R in 3 (correct), P and M new and allowed.

Let's choose SPERM.

Check:
- S (position 1 ✓), E (position 2), R (position 3 ✓), P and M not yet excluded.

- SERGE (but G is allowed, E would be in position 5 which is allowed)
- SERB (too short)
- SERNY (not common)
- SERFS is a valid word meaning ""one who makes shoes"".

Let's check SERFS:
- S E R F S
- F is allowed, S is allowed (and already in position 1, so position 5 is allowed for S).
- No banned letters.

This seems the best choice.",Guess 5: SERFS -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) E(✓) R(✓) F(x) S(-),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us maximum information about letter presence in the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- O(x) – O is NOT in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters to keep: R, S, E (they appear in the secret word, but not in the positions tried).
- Letters to avoid in the next guess: A, O.
- Positions to avoid for R, S, E:
  – R cannot be in position 2.
  – S cannot be in position 4.
  – E cannot be in position 5.

A good next guess should:
1. Re-use R, S, E in new positions.
2. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tested yet.
3. Avoid A and O.

Candidate words:
- “TRIES” – uses T (new), I (new), E (repositioned), S (repositioned), R (repositioned).
- “STERN” – uses S, T, E, R, N (but N hasn’t been tested yet).
- “REINS” – uses R, E, I, N, S (but S would be in position 5, which is allowed).

“TRIES” looks good because it moves all known letters (R, E, S) to new positions and adds T and I, which are common and haven’t been tested.

<guess>TRIES</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: TRIES -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) I(x) E(-) S(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - A and O are not in the word at all.
   - R is in the word, but not in position 2.
   - S is in the word, but not in position 4.
   - E is in the word, but not in position 5.

2. TRIES → T(x) R(-) I(x) E(-) S(-)
   - T and I are not in the word.
   - R is still not in position 2 (confirmed).
   - E is still not in position 5 (confirmed).
   - S is still not in position 4 (confirmed).

Known letters that must appear: R, S, E  
Known letters that must NOT appear: A, O, T, I  
Positions we now know to avoid:
- R ≠ 2
- S ≠ 4
- E ≠ 5

We need a 5-letter word that contains R, S, E once each, excludes A, O, T, I, and respects the positional exclusions.

Let’s look for a word with:
- R somewhere other than position 2
- S somewhere other than position 4
- E somewhere other than position 5

Possible remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Possible vowels: only E is confirmed; others could be U, Y

Candidate words:
- “SNEER” – has S, N, E, E, R → but E appears twice, and we don’t know if double-E is allowed. Also, R is in position 5 here, which is allowed but let’s check others.
- “CREST” – has C, R, E, S, T → but T is excluded.
- “DRESS” – has D, R, E, S, S → double S; S is allowed but position 4 is excluded for S, so okay.
- “PRESS” – P, R, E, S, S → double S again.
- “BURNS” – B, U, R, N, S → R in position 3 (allowed), S in position 5 (allowed), E missing → not ideal.
- “SHEER” – S, H, E, E, R → double E again.
- “PERCH” – P, E, R, C, H → misses S.
- “FRESH” – F, R, E, S, H → R in position 2 (disallowed).
- “DRESS” already considered.

A better choice might be “DRESS” even with double S, because:
- Contains R (position 2 is forbidden, but here R is in position 2 – oops, forbidden).
Wait, in “DRESS” R is in position 2, which is forbidden.

Next candidate: “SHEET” – S, H, E, E, T → T excluded.

“SWEER” – S, W, E, E, R → double E again.

“SPEAR” – P is new, but S is in position 1 (allowed), E in position 3 (allowed), R in position 4 (allowed). Letters: S, P, E, A, R → but A is excluded.

“SHER” – too short.

“SHELF” – misses E.

“CREST” – T excluded.

“PRESS” – double S, but S in position 4 is forbidden.

“DUNCE” – misses S.

“SURGE” – misses E.

“FURER” – misses S.

“HUMPS” – misses E.

“BURNS” – B, U, R, N, S → R in position 3 (allowed), S in position 5 (allowed), E missing → not ideal.

“CURER” – C, U, R, E, R → double R, but R is allowed once. R in position 3 (allowed), E in position 4 (allowed), S missing → not ideal.

“NERVE” – N, E, R, V, E → double E.

“VERGE” – misses S.

“WORSE” – O excluded.

“HORSE” – O excluded.

“FUROR” – O excluded.

“CURVY” – misses E.

“SURGE” – misses E.

“PERKY” – misses E.

“FRESH” – R in position 2 (forbidden).

“CREST” – T excluded.

“DRESS” – R in position 2 (forbidden).

“SHEET” – R in position 2 (forbidden).

“SWEER” – R in position 5 (allowed), E in position 3 (allowed), S in position 1 (allowed). Letters: S, W, E, E, R → double E is acceptable since we don’t know if double-E is allowed, but let’s avoid it for now.

“SHEER” – double E.

“SPEAR” – A excluded.

“SHELF” – misses E.

“SHRED” – D is new, R in position 3 (allowed), E in position 2 (allowed), S in position 1 (allowed). Letters: S, H, R, E, D → no A, O, T, I. This looks good.

Let’s choose “SHRED”.

Check:
- S in position 1 (allowed)
- H (new)
- R in position 3 (allowed)
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- D (new)
No forbidden letters.

This seems optimal.

<guess>SHRED</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: TRIES -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) I(x) E(-) S(-)
Guess 3: SHRED -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) R(✓) E(-) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on SHRED:
- S(✓) – S is in the word and in the correct position 1.
- H(x) – H is NOT in the word.
- R(✓) – R is in the word and in the correct position 3.
- E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- D(x) – D is NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Word structure: S _ R _ _
- Letters that must appear: S, R, E
- Letters that must NOT appear: A, O, T, I, H, D
- E cannot be in position 4 (from SHRED) or 5 (from earlier rounds).

Possible remaining letters (excluding the banned ones):
Vowels: only E is confirmed; U, Y could be possible.
Consonants: B, C, F, G, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to fill positions 2 and 5 with letters from the allowed set, such that E is used once and not in positions 4 or 5. Since position 3 is R, E must be in position 2 or 5, but:
- Position 5 is allowed for E (only position 4 and 5 were excluded for E in earlier guesses, but wait: in AROSE E was excluded from position 5, and in TRIES E was excluded from position 5. In SHRED E was excluded from position 4. So E can be in position 2 or 5.)

But in SHRED, E was in position 4 (excluded), so E cannot be in position 4. From earlier:
- In AROSE E was in position 5 (excluded)
- In TRIES E was in position 4 (excluded)
- In SHRED E was in position 4 (excluded)

So E is excluded from positions 4 and 5. Therefore E must be in position 2.

Thus the word structure is: S E R _ _

Now we need to fill position 5 with a letter that:
- Is not any of A, O, T, I, H, D
- Is not S, R, E (already used)
- Is not any of the letters we haven't used yet (B, C, F, G, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)

Common letters left: B, C, F, G, K, L, M, N, P, U, Y

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form S E R _ _.

Possible words:
- SERFS
- SERRA (invalid, A excluded)
- SERGE (but G is allowed)
- SERFS – S E R F S – but S is already in position 1, and can't be in position 5 (no restriction yet), but double S is possible.
- SWORD (but O is excluded)
- SHERS – H excluded
- SKEET – T excluded
- SNEER – N, E, E, R – double E
- SPERM – M allowed, P allowed, but M and P not tested yet.
- SERFS – F and S are allowed.

Let's check SERFS:
- S E R F S
- Position 2: E (allowed, since E must be in position 2)
- Position 3: R (correct)
- Position 4: F (new, allowed)
- Position 5: S (allowed, S can be in position 5)
- No banned letters.

This seems valid.

Another option: SERGE:
- S E R G E
- G is allowed, E in position 2 and 5 – but E can't be in 5 (from AROSE and TRIES). So invalid.

Another: SERPS – but P and S allowed, but S in position 5 is allowed, but double S.

Another: SWORD – O excluded.

Another: SNAKY – misses E.

Another: SNEER – E in position 2 and 4, but 4 is excluded for E.

Another: SKEER – K, E, E, R – double E.

Another: SPERM – E in position 2, R in 3, M and P new.

SPERM seems valid:
- S P E R M
- S in 1 (correct), E in 2 (allowed), R in 3 (correct), P and M new and allowed.

Let's choose SPERM.

Check:
- S (position 1 ✓), E (position 2), R (position 3 ✓), P and M not yet excluded.

<guess>SPERM</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: TRIES -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) I(x) E(-) S(-)
Guess 3: SHRED -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) R(✓) E(-) D(x)
Guess 4: SPERM -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) E(-) R(✓) M(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the latest feedback on SPERM:
- S(✓) – S is correct in position 1.
- P(x) – P is NOT in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 3 (since R is correct in position 3).
- R(✓) – R is correct in position 3.
- M(x) – M is NOT in the word.

So far we have:
- Word structure: S _ R _ _
- Letters that must appear: S, R, E
- Letters that must NOT appear: A, O, T, I, H, D, P, M
- E must be in position 2 (since positions 3 and 4 are taken by R and another unknown letter, and it cannot be in 4 or 5).

Thus the word is: S E R _ _

We need a 5-letter word of the form S E R _ _ using only allowed letters.

Allowed letters (excluding the banned ones):
B, C, F, G, K, L, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to fill positions 4 and 5 with these letters, and position 5 is especially important to determine.

Possible words:
- SERFS
- SERRA (invalid, A excluded)
- SERGE (but G is allowed, and E would be in position 5, which is allowed since E only cannot be in 4 or 5 from previous feedback, but in SHRED E was in position 4 and excluded from 5, and in SPERM E was in position 3 and excluded from 4. Wait, let's clarify:

From SHRED: E was in position 4 → excluded
From TRIES: E was in position 4 → excluded
From AROSE: E was in position 5 → excluded
From SPERM: E was in position 3 → excluded from 4 (no, wait, in SPERM E was in position 3, but that doesn't exclude 4, only 4 was excluded in SHRED and AROSE/TRIES. Wait, let's re-examine:

Actually, from all feedback:
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from SHRED and AROSE/TRIES).
- Therefore E must be in position 2.

Thus the word is S E R _ _.

We need to fill positions 4 and 5 with allowed letters: B, C, F, G, K, L, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common words:
- SERFS
- SERGE (but G is allowed, E would be in position 5 which is allowed)
- SERB (too short)
- SERNY (not common)
- SERFS is a valid word meaning ""one who makes shoes"".

Let's check SERFS:
- S E R F S
- F is allowed, S is allowed (and already in position 1, so position 5 is allowed for S).
- No banned letters.

This seems the best choice.

From the latest feedback on SERFS:
- S(✓) – S is correct in position 1.
- E(✓) – E is correct in position 2.
- R(✓) – R is correct in position 3.
- F(x) – F is NOT in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 5 (since only one S is marked ✓ in position 1, and the second S is marked -).

So:
- Word structure: S E R _ _
- Letters that must appear: S, E, R
- Letters that must NOT appear: A, O, T, I, H, D, P, M, F
- S must be in position 1 (fixed)
- E is confirmed in position 2 (fixed)
- R is confirmed in position 3 (fixed)
- Position 4 and 5 must be filled with allowed letters, and there must be only one S in the word (since only one S is marked ✓ in position 1).

Allowed letters left: B, C, G, K, L, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word of the form S E R _ _ with:
- Position 4 and 5 filled from the allowed letters
- The second S must be absent (since only one S is ✓ in position 1)

Possible words:
- S E R _ _ with S in position 1, E in 2, R in 3, and two other allowed letters in 4 and 5.

Looking at common words:
- SERGE (but G is allowed, E would be in position 5 which is allowed)
- SERB (too short)
- SERNY (not common)
- S LATER (but T is excluded)
- S NARE (but A is excluded)
- S CREE (but C and E are allowed, but E is already in position 2)
- S WORE (but O is excluded)
- S CROW (but O is excluded)

Actually, let's think systematically:
We have S E R _ _ with:
- Position 4 and 5 to fill
- Allowed letters: B, C, G, K, L, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
- And the second S must not appear (only once S is ✓ in position 1)

Possible combinations:
- S E R B _
- S E R C _
- S E R G _
- S E R K _
- S E R L _
- S E R N _
- S E R Q _
- S E R U _
- S E R V _
- S E R W _
- S E R Y _

Looking for common words:
- SERGE (but G is allowed, E would be in position 5 which is allowed)
- SERB (too short)
- SERNY (not common)
- SERKS (too short)
- SERBS (too long)
- SERGE is actually 5 letters: S E R G E – but E is in position 2 and 5 is allowed for E? Wait, E is confirmed in position 2, but can it be in 5? From AROSE and TRIES, E was in position 5 (excluded), and in SHRED E was in position 4 (excluded), and in SPERM E was in position 3 (excluded). So E cannot be in 4 or 5. Thus E must be in position 2 (confirmed), and position 5 must be filled by another letter.

Thus the word is S E R _ _ with E only in position 2.

Possible words:
- S E R G E (but E in 5 is excluded)
- S E R B _ (but need a 5th letter)
- S E R C _ (but need a 5th letter)
- S E R K _ (but need a 5th letter)
- S E R L _ (but need a 5th letter)
- S E R N _ (but need a 5th letter)
- S E R B U (but U is allowed)
- S E R C U
- S E R G U
- S E R K U
- S E R L U
- S E R N U

Looking for actual 5-letter words:
- S E R G E – invalid (E in 5 excluded)
- S E R B U – not a word
- S E R C U – not a word
- S E R K U – not a word
- S E R L U – not a word
- S E R N U – not a word

Actually, let's think differently: the word must be S E R _ _ with E only in position 2. So positions 4 and 5 must be filled from allowed letters, and the second S must not appear (only one S is ✓ in position 1).

Looking at allowed letters: B, C, G, K, L, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Possible combinations:
- S E R B N (but N is allowed)
- S E R C K (but K is allowed)
- S E R G E (invalid)
- S E R L K (not a word)
- S E R N B (not a word)
- S E R B U (not a word)
- S E R C U (not a word)

Wait, let's list actual 5-letter words starting with SER:
- SERGE (valid, means ""to serve"")
- SERFS (but F is excluded)
- SERB (too short)
- SERNY (not common)
- SERPS (P is excluded)
- SERKS (K is allowed, but S is already in position 1, and we have only one S ✓ in position 1, so second S in position 5 is invalid as it would imply two S's, but the feedback only shows one S ✓ in position 1. However, the second S in position 5 is marked - (meaning S is in the word but not in position 5), which makes sense. So S is only in position 1, and there's only one S.

Thus the word is SERGE.

Check:
- S E R G E
- S in 1 (✓), E in 2 (✓), R in 3 (✓), G and E are allowed, and E is in position 2 (confirmed).
