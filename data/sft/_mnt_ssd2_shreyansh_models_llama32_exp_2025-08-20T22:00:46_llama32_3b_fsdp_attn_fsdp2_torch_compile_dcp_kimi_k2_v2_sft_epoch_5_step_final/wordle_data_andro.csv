### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"", which also covers common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" for this first attempt to maximize vowel coverage early on.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct first position (✓)
- R is in the word but wrong position (-)
- O is in the word but wrong position (-)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word starts with A
2. It contains R and O, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively
3. It does NOT contain S or E

Good next letters to test are common consonants and remaining vowels (I, U, Y). Since R and O must appear later, I'll try placing R in position 3 and O in position 4 to maximize information gain. The word ""AROUND"" uses common letters and tests new positions for R and O while introducing U, N, D.

However, let me reconsider - R is currently in position 2 (wrong), so trying it in position 3 is okay, but O is currently in position 3 (wrong), so trying it in position 4 is also okay. But ""AROUND"" might be too many new letters. Instead, let's try ""ARIA"" - but that's 5 letters and has A already in position 1. 

Better would be ""ARIA"" no, since we need to test R and O in new positions. Let's try ""ABORT"" - but T is less common. 

Actually, let's try ""ABRIO"" - but that's not a valid word. 

Let me think of valid words starting with A, containing R and O, without S or E. 

Possible words:
- AROCK (but has C and K)
- AROUND (valid, uses U, N, D)
- AROSE (already tried)
- AORTA (but has A twice)
- AROGE (but has E)

""AROUND"" seems best - it uses U, N, D as new letters, and positions R and O differently from before.

The previous attempt “AROUND” was rejected because it was not exactly five letters (it had spaces).  
We are told:

- A is fixed in position 1.  
- R and O must appear somewhere in the remaining four positions (they are “in the word but wrong place”).  
- S and E are not in the word at all.  

So we need a word that:
1. Starts with A.  
2. Contains both R and O in any of positions 2–5 (but not their previous spots: R not 2, O not 3).  
3. Uses only letters we have not ruled out (no S, no E).  

Good candidates that fit:
- AROCK (but has C and K – acceptable)  
- AROGE (but has E – invalid)  
- AROTH (but has T – acceptable)  
- AROMO (but has O twice – acceptable)  
- AROPA (but has P – acceptable)

Among these, “AROCK” uses common consonants C and K and keeps both R and O in new positions (R in 3, O in 4). It is a valid 5-letter word and gives us fresh information.

Let’s go with AROCK.

Let’s list possible positions for R and O:

R can be in 4 or 5  
O can be in 2, 4, or 5, and cannot coincide with R’s positions.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"", which also covers common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" for this first attempt to maximize vowel coverage early on.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct first position (✓)
- R is in the word but wrong position (-)
- O is in the word but wrong position (-)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word starts with A
2. It contains R and O, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively
3. It does NOT contain S or E

Good next letters to test are common consonants and remaining vowels (I, U, Y). Since R and O must appear later, I'll try placing R in position 3 and O in position 4 to maximize information gain. The word ""AROUND"" uses common letters and tests new positions for R and O while introducing U, N, D.

However, let me reconsider - R is currently in position 2 (wrong), so trying it in position 3 is okay, but O is currently in position 3 (wrong), so trying it in position 4 is also okay. But ""AROUND"" might be too many new letters. Instead, let's try ""ARIA"" - but that's 5 letters and has A already in position 1. 

Better would be ""ARIA"" no, since we need to test R and O in new positions. Let's try ""ABORT"" - but T is less common. 

Actually, let's try ""ABRIO"" - but that's not a valid word. 

Let me think of valid words starting with A, containing R and O, without S or E. 

Possible words:
- AROCK (but has C and K)
- AROUND (valid, uses U, N, D)
- AROSE (already tried)
- AORTA (but has A twice)
- AROGE (but has E)

""AROUND"" seems best - it uses U, N, D as new letters, and positions R and O differently from before.

<guess>AROUND</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: AROUND -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The previous attempt “AROUND” was rejected because it was not exactly five letters (it had spaces).  
We are told:

- A is fixed in position 1.  
- R and O must appear somewhere in the remaining four positions (they are “in the word but wrong place”).  
- S and E are not in the word at all.  

So we need a word that:
1. Starts with A.  
2. Contains both R and O in any of positions 2–5 (but not their previous spots: R not 2, O not 3).  
3. Uses only letters we have not ruled out (no S, no E).  

Good candidates that fit:
- AROCK (but has C and K – acceptable)  
- AROGE (but has E – invalid)  
- AROTH (but has T – acceptable)  
- AROMO (but has O twice – acceptable)  
- AROPA (but has P – acceptable)

Among these, “AROCK” uses common consonants C and K and keeps both R and O in new positions (R in 3, O in 4). It is a valid 5-letter word and gives us fresh information.

Let’s go with AROCK.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after four guesses.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"", which also covers common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" for this first attempt to maximize vowel coverage early on.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct first position (✓)
- R is in the word but wrong position (-)
- O is in the word but wrong position (-)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word starts with A
2. It contains R and O, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively
3. It does NOT contain S or E

Good next letters to test are common consonants and remaining vowels (I, U, Y). Since R and O must appear later, I'll try placing R in position 3 and O in position 4 to maximize information gain. The word ""AROUND"" uses common letters and tests new positions for R and O while introducing U, N, D.

However, let me reconsider - R is currently in position 2 (wrong), so trying it in position 3 is okay, but O is currently in position 3 (wrong), so trying it in position 4 is also okay. But ""AROUND"" might be too many new letters. Instead, let's try ""ARIA"" - but that's 5 letters and has A already in position 1. 

Better would be ""ARIA"" no, since we need to test R and O in new positions. Let's try ""ABORT"" - but T is less common. 

Actually, let's try ""ABRIO"" - but that's not a valid word. 

Let me think of valid words starting with A, containing R and O, without S or E. 

Possible words:
- AROCK (but has C and K)
- AROUND (valid, uses U, N, D)
- AROSE (already tried)
- AORTA (but has A twice)
- AROGE (but has E)

""AROUND"" seems best - it uses U, N, D as new letters, and positions R and O differently from before.

<guess>AROUND</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: AROUND -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The previous attempt “AROUND” was rejected because it was not exactly five letters (it had spaces).  
We are told:

- A is fixed in position 1.  
- R and O must appear somewhere in the remaining four positions (they are “in the word but wrong place”).  
- S and E are not in the word at all.  

So we need a word that:
1. Starts with A.  
2. Contains both R and O in any of positions 2–5 (but not their previous spots: R not 2, O not 3).  
3. Uses only letters we have not ruled out (no S, no E).  

Good candidates that fit:
- AROCK (but has C and K – acceptable)  
- AROGE (but has E – invalid)  
- AROTH (but has T – acceptable)  
- AROMO (but has O twice – acceptable)  
- AROPA (but has P – acceptable)

Among these, “AROCK” uses common consonants C and K and keeps both R and O in new positions (R in 3, O in 4). It is a valid 5-letter word and gives us fresh information.

Let’s go with AROCK.

<guess>AROCK</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: AROUND -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 3: AROCK -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(-) O(-) C(x) K(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the three guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   – A is locked in position 1.
   – R and O are somewhere in the word, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
   – S and E are not in the word.

2. AROUND → rejected (not exactly five letters).

3. AROCK → A(✓) R(-) O(-) C(x) K(x)
   – Still A(✓) in position 1.
   – R is now in position 2 (still wrong), O in position 3 (still wrong).
   – C and K are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word starts with A.
- Must contain R and O.
- R is NOT in positions 2 or 3 (so R ∈ {4, 5}).
- O is NOT in position 3 (so O ∈ {2, 4, 5}).
- Letters ruled out so far: S, E, C, K.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Starts with A.
- Uses R and O in allowed positions.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Let’s list possible positions for R and O:

R can be in 4 or 5  
O can be in 2, 4, or 5, and cannot coincide with R’s positions.

Try cases:

Case 1: R in 4, O in 2  
   Pattern: A O _ R _  
   Fill blanks with remaining allowed letters (no S, E, C, K).  
   Good candidate: A O U R ? – but we need 5 letters.  
   Try A O U R N → “AOURN” – not valid.  
   Try A O U R D → “AOURD” – not valid.  
   Try A O U R T → “AOURT” – not valid.  
   Try A O U R L → “AOURL” – not valid.  
   Try A O U R Y → “AOURY” – not valid.  

Case 2: R in 5, O in 2  
   Pattern: A O _ _ R  
   Fill blanks with allowed letters.  
   Try A O U N R – not valid.  
   Try A O U G R – “AUGUR” – not valid.  
   Try A O U D R – “AUDR?” – no.  
   Try A O U B R – “AUBR?” – no.  
   Try A O U M R – “AUMR?” – no.  
   Try A O U L R – “AULR?” – no.  

Case 3: R in 5, O in 4  
   Pattern: A _ _ O R  
   Fill blanks with allowed letters.  
   Try A U O M R – “AUMOR” – not valid.  
   Try A U O N R – “AUNOR” – not valid.  
   Try A U O D R – “AUDOR” – no.  
   Try A U O G R – “AUGOR” – no.  
   Try A U O L R – “AULOR” – no.  
   Try A U O T R – “AUTOR” – yes! “AUTOR” is a valid 5-letter word.

Case 4: R in 5, O in 2  
   Pattern: A O _ _ R  
   Try A O U G R – “AUGAR” – no (repeats A).  
   Try A O U N R – “AUNAR” – no.  
   Try A O U L R – “AULAR” – no.  

“AUTOR” fits perfectly:
- Starts with A.
- R is in position 5 (allowed).
- O is in position 4 (allowed).
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (U, T, O, R).

Known facts
1. Word must start with A.
2. The word contains both R and O.
3. R is NOT in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from AROSE, AROCK, AUTOR).

   Re-checking:

   - AROCK: R in 2 (-)
   - AUTOR: R in 5 (-)
   ⇒ R is NOT in 2 or 5.
   ⇒ R ∈ {3,4}

   But in AROSE, O was in 3 (-) and R was in 2 (-), so R ≠ 2, O ≠ 3.

   So R can be in 3 or 4.
   O can be in 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants.

This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.\n\nAnother strong candidate is ""SLATE"", which also covers common letters.
