### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a classic strong opener.

2. Does not contain R or O.
3. Avoids the disallowed positions for A, S, E.

Possible candidates: 
- “SAINT” – contains S, A, E but also has I and N, which could help narrow things down.
- “STEAK” – has S, T, E, A, K.
- “SEATS” – has S, E, A, T, S (double S).

Let me pick “SAINT” because it places S in position 1 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed), and E in position 3 (allowed), while introducing new letters I and N that could provide additional information.

2. SAINT → S(-) A(-) I(x) N(x) T(-)
   - S, A, T, E are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 5 respectively.
   - I and N are not in the word.

Known facts so far:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, S, E, T
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, O, I, N
- Position restrictions:
  – A cannot be in position 1 or 2 (from AROSE and SAINT).
  – S cannot be in position 1 or 4 (from AROSE and SAINT).
  – E cannot be in position 3 or 5 (from AROSE and SAINT).
  – T cannot be in position 5 (from SAINT).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A, S, E, T exactly once each (since SAINT already shows A, S, T, E and T is shown only once).
- Does not contain R, O, I, N.
- Respects the positional bans above.

Let’s list possible positions for each letter:
A: allowed in 3, 4, 5
S: allowed in 2, 3, 5
E: allowed in 1, 2, 4
T: allowed in 1, 2, 3, 4

We need one more letter (since we have 4 known letters). We can choose a new letter that hasn’t been ruled out yet (not R, O, I, N). Good candidates: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Try to place the letters:
- Put T in position 1 (allowed).
- Put E in position 2 (allowed).
- Put A in position 3 (allowed).
- Put S in position 5 (allowed).
- Need one more letter in position 4. Choose C (common and not ruled out).

Word: T E A S C → TEASC (invalid, not a word).
Reverse: T E A S _ → TEAS_ (need a 5th letter). TEASE (has E twice, but E is allowed once). TEASE is valid.

Check TEASE:
- Contains T, E, A, S, E – but E is repeated. We don’t know if letters can repeat, but up to now no repeats have been hinted. Since I and N repeats weren’t allowed, let’s assume no repeats for now.

Instead, try T in 1, E in 2, A in 3, S in 5, and choose a new letter for 4: T E A _ S. Valid word: TEAS_ – but we need a 5-letter word. Try T E A L S – TEALS (invalid). T E A M S – TEAMS (valid word).

Check TEAMS:
- Letters: T, E, A, M, S – all allowed (M not ruled out yet).
- Positions:
  – T in 1: allowed (T banned only in 5).
  – E in 2: allowed (E banned only in 3 and 5).
  – A in 3: allowed (A banned only in 1 and 2).
  – M in 4: allowed (M not yet used or ruled out).
  – S in 5: allowed (S banned only in 1 and 4).

TEAMS satisfies all constraints.

Alternative check:
Another candidate: T E S A _ – but need a 5-letter word. TESLA (invalid, has L and repeats A). TESLA is invalid.

So TEAMS seems safe.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a classic strong opener.

- Positions these letters cannot occupy: A ≠ 1, S ≠ 4, E ≠ 5.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, S, and E.
2. Does not contain R or O.
3. Avoids the disallowed positions for A, S, E.

Possible candidates: 
- “SAINT” – contains S, A, E but also has I and N, which could help narrow things down.
- “STEAK” – has S, T, E, A, K.
- “SEATS” – has S, E, A, T, S (double S).

Let me pick “SAINT” because it places S in position 1 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed), and E in position 3 (allowed), while introducing new letters I and N that could provide additional information.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: SAINT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) A(-) I(x) N(x) T(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - A, S, E are in the word but not in positions 1, 4, 5 respectively.
   - R and O are not in the word.

2. SAINT → S(-) A(-) I(x) N(x) T(-)
   - S, A, T, E are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 5 respectively.
   - I and N are not in the word.

Known facts so far:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, S, E, T
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, O, I, N
- Position restrictions:
  – A cannot be in position 1 or 2 (from AROSE and SAINT).
  – S cannot be in position 1 or 4 (from AROSE and SAINT).
  – E cannot be in position 3 or 5 (from AROSE and SAINT).
  – T cannot be in position 5 (from SAINT).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A, S, E, T exactly once each (since SAINT already shows A, S, T, E and T is shown only once).
- Does not contain R, O, I, N.
- Respects the positional bans above.

Let’s list possible positions for each letter:
A: allowed in 3, 4, 5
S: allowed in 2, 3, 5
E: allowed in 1, 2, 4
T: allowed in 1, 2, 3, 4

We need one more letter (since we have 4 known letters). We can choose a new letter that hasn’t been ruled out yet (not R, O, I, N). Good candidates: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Try to place the letters:
- Put T in position 1 (allowed).
- Put E in position 2 (allowed).
- Put A in position 3 (allowed).
- Put S in position 5 (allowed).
- Need one more letter in position 4. Choose C (common and not ruled out).

Word: T E A S C → TEASC (invalid, not a word).
Reverse: T E A S _ → TEAS_ (need a 5th letter). TEASE (has E twice, but E is allowed once). TEASE is valid.

Check TEASE:
- Contains T, E, A, S, E – but E is repeated. We don’t know if letters can repeat, but up to now no repeats have been hinted. Since I and N repeats weren’t allowed, let’s assume no repeats for now.

Instead, try T in 1, E in 2, A in 3, S in 5, and choose a new letter for 4: T E A _ S. Valid word: TEAS_ – but we need a 5-letter word. Try T E A L S – TEALS (invalid). T E A M S – TEAMS (valid word).

Check TEAMS:
- Letters: T, E, A, M, S – all allowed (M not ruled out yet).
- Positions:
  – T in 1: allowed (T banned only in 5).
  – E in 2: allowed (E banned only in 3 and 5).
  – A in 3: allowed (A banned only in 1 and 2).
  – M in 4: allowed (M not yet used or ruled out).
  – S in 5: allowed (S banned only in 1 and 4).

TEAMS satisfies all constraints.

Alternative check:
Another candidate: T E S A _ – but need a 5-letter word. TESLA (invalid, has L and repeats A). TESLA is invalid.

So TEAMS seems safe.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a classic strong opener.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) – O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters definitely not in the word: R, O

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a classic strong opener.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) – O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters definitely not in the word: R, O
- Letters that are in the word (somewhere): A, S, E
- Positions these letters cannot occupy: A ≠ 1, S ≠ 4, E ≠ 5.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, S, and E.
2. Does not contain R or O.
3. Avoids the disallowed positions for A, S, E.

Possible candidates: 
- “SAINT” – contains S, A, E but also has I and N, which could help narrow things down.
- “STEAK” – has S, T, E, A, K.
- “SEATS” – has S, E, A, T, S (double S).

Let me pick “SAINT” because it places S in position 1 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed), and E in position 3 (allowed), while introducing new letters I and N that could provide additional information.

<guess>SAINT</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: SAINT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) A(-) I(x) N(x) T(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - A, S, E are in the word but not in positions 1, 4, 5 respectively.
   - R and O are not in the word.

2. SAINT → S(-) A(-) I(x) N(x) T(-)
   - S, A, T, E are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 5 respectively.
   - I and N are not in the word.

Known facts so far:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, S, E, T
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, O, I, N
- Position restrictions:
  – A cannot be in position 1 or 2 (from AROSE and SAINT).
  – S cannot be in position 1 or 4 (from AROSE and SAINT).
  – E cannot be in position 3 or 5 (from AROSE and SAINT).
  – T cannot be in position 5 (from SAINT).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A, S, E, T exactly once each (since SAINT already shows A, S, T, E and T is shown only once).
- Does not contain R, O, I, N.
- Respects the positional bans above.

Let’s list possible positions for each letter:
A: allowed in 3, 4, 5
S: allowed in 2, 3, 5
E: allowed in 1, 2, 4
T: allowed in 1, 2, 3, 4

We need one more letter (since we have 4 known letters). We can choose a new letter that hasn’t been ruled out yet (not R, O, I, N). Good candidates: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Try to place the letters:
- Put T in position 1 (allowed).
- Put E in position 2 (allowed).
- Put A in position 3 (allowed).
- Put S in position 5 (allowed).
- Need one more letter in position 4. Choose C (common and not ruled out).

Word: T E A S C → TEASC (invalid, not a word).
Reverse: T E A S _ → TEAS_ (need a 5th letter). TEASE (has E twice, but E is allowed once). TEASE is valid.

Check TEASE:
- Contains T, E, A, S, E – but E is repeated. We don’t know if letters can repeat, but up to now no repeats have been hinted. Since I and N repeats weren’t allowed, let’s assume no repeats for now.

Instead, try T in 1, E in 2, A in 3, S in 5, and choose a new letter for 4: T E A _ S. Valid word: TEAS_ – but we need a 5-letter word. Try T E A L S – TEALS (invalid). T E A M S – TEAMS (valid word).

Check TEAMS:
- Letters: T, E, A, M, S – all allowed (M not ruled out yet).
- Positions:
  – T in 1: allowed (T banned only in 5).
  – E in 2: allowed (E banned only in 3 and 5).
  – A in 3: allowed (A banned only in 1 and 2).
  – M in 4: allowed (M not yet used or ruled out).
  – S in 5: allowed (S banned only in 1 and 4).

TEAMS satisfies all constraints.

Alternative check:
Another candidate: T E S A _ – but need a 5-letter word. TESLA (invalid, has L and repeats A). TESLA is invalid.

So TEAMS seems safe.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)

Guess 3: TEAMS -> FEEDBACK: T(-) E(✓) A(✓) M(x) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on TEAMS:
- T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 1.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in the correct position 2.
- A(✓) – A is in the word and in the correct position 3.
- M(x) – M is not in the word.
- S(✓) – S is in the word and in the correct position 5.

So we now know:
- Exact pattern so far: _ E A _ S
- Letters definitely in the word: E, A, S, T
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, O, I, N, M
- T must be in the word but not in position 1 (from TEAMS feedback). The only remaining positions for T are 4 (since 2,3,5 are taken by E,A,S).

Thus the word must be: _ E A T S

The only missing letter is position 1. It must be a consonant not yet ruled out (cannot be R,O,I,N,M). Common choices: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, P, U, V, W, Y.

Looking for 5-letter words matching ?EATS:
- BEATS – valid word, B not ruled out.
- FEATS – valid word, F not ruled out.
- LEATS – valid word, L not ruled out.
- PEATS – valid word, P not ruled out.

All these fit. Choose one: BEATS is a common word and uses B (not yet excluded).
