### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but not in the 4th position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S somewhere other than position 4.
2. Avoids A, R, O, E entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels not yet ruled out.

Good remaining vowels: I, U
Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, K, W, Y, V, etc.

I'll try a word with S, plus common letters like T, I, N, L. A good candidate is ""STING"":
- S is in position 1 (not 4, so valid for feedback)
- Uses T, I, N, G (none ruled out)
- Avoids all excluded letters (A, R, O, E)

- Contains G somewhere other than position 5.  
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E, T, I, N.  
- Still need four more letters, none of which can be A, R, O, E, T, I, N.

Remaining common consonants: D, L, C, P, M, H, B, F, K, W, Y, V, etc.
