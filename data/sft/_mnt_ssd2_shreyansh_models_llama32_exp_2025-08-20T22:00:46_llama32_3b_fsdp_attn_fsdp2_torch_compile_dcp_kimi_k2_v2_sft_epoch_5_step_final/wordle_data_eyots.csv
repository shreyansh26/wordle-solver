### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers more of the common letters.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the word is _ O _ _ _
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so S is in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so E is in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R  
Letters we know ARE in the word: O (position 2), S, E

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2
- Contains S somewhere (not position 4)
- Contains E somewhere (not position 5)
- Does not contain A or R

Possible patterns: _ O _ _ _ with S and E somewhere in positions 1,3,4,5 (but not the positions they were in before).

Good candidates might be:
- ""SPOKE"" – but P and K are less common, and S is in position 1 (allowed), E in position 5 (but E was in position 5 before, so this might keep E in wrong position)
- ""LOUSE"" – L and U are new letters, S in position 4 (but S was in position 4 before, so this might keep S in wrong position)
- ""MOUSE"" – M and U are new letters, S in position 4, E in position 5 (but E was in position 5 before, so this might not help)
- ""HOUSE"" – H and U are new letters, S in position 4, E in position 5 (but E was in position 5 before, so this is bad)

Better would be ""SLOPE"" – S in position 1, E in position 4, O in position 2. This uses new letters L and P, and positions S and E that weren't in their previous guesses.

But let me think simpler: ""SOME"" – but this is 4 letters. ""SOME"" doesn't work.

""SOBER"" – but R is out.

""SONIC"" – but I is new, C is new, and positions S(1), O(2), N(3), I(4), C(5). This uses S in position 1 (allowed), E is not here, but we need E. So this is bad.

""DOSES"" – but S is repeated, and E is in position 4 (allowed), but we don't know about D yet.

""POISE"" – P is new, I is new, S in position 4 (bad, same as before), E in position 5 (bad).

""LOINS"" – but S is in position 5, E in position 4 (both allowed), but L and I are new.

Wait, let me re-examine the positions:
- O is fixed in position 2
- S was in position 4 in AROSE, so it can't be 4 – possible positions: 1,3,5
- E was in position 5 in AROSE, so it can't be 5 – possible positions: 1,2,3,4 (but 2 is O), so 1,3,4

Best might be ""LOUSE"":
- L (new), O (correct), U (new), S (position 4 – but S was in 4 before, so this is bad)

Next option: ""HOSES"" – but S is in position 5 (allowed), E in position 4 (allowed), H and I are new.

But ""HOSES"" has S in position 5, which is allowed for S (they weren't in position 4 before), and E in position 4 (allowed – wasn't in 5 before). This seems good.

But actually, let me think more systematically. We need:
- _ O _ _ _
- Must include S and E somewhere in positions 1,3,4,5 (but not 4 for S, not 5 for E)
- Cannot have A or R

Possible patterns:
- S O E _ _ (but S was in position 1 in AROSE, E in 3)
- _ O S E _ (but E was in 5 before, so this is invalid)
- _ O _ S _ (but E needs to be in 1,3, or 4)
- _ O _ _ S (but E needs to be in 1,3, or 4)

Best might be ""HOSES"" – but as noted, S is in 5 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), and H and I are new.

Another option: ""POISE"" – but S is in 4 (invalid), and E in 5 (invalid).

""BOSES"" – but S is in 5 and 4 (invalid for 4).

""FOES_"" – but need valid word.

""DOSES"" – same issue with S.

""LOES_"" – but need valid word.

Actually, ""LOINS"" – but S is in 5 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), L and I new. But this is obscure.

Best seems ""HOSES"" – but let me check if this is valid:
- H (new), O (correct), S (position 3 – allowed, wasn't there before), E (position 4 – allowed), S (position 5 – allowed for first time, since previous S was in 4)
But this repeats S, which is allowed, but might not be optimal.

Alternative: ""LOINS"" – but this is rare.

""COSES"" – but S in 4 and 5 (invalid for 4).

""VOLES"" – but S in 5 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), V and L new.

""VOLES"" seems good:
- V (new), O (correct), L (new), E (position 4 – allowed), S (position 5 – allowed)
This introduces V and L, and keeps O in place, moves S and E to new positions.

Yes, ""VOLES"" is a valid word (plural of ""volet""), and fits all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers more of the common letters.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the word is _ O _ _ _
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so S is in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so E is in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R  
Letters we know ARE in the word: O (position 2), S, E

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2
- Contains S somewhere (not position 4)
- Contains E somewhere (not position 5)
- Does not contain A or R

Possible patterns: _ O _ _ _ with S and E somewhere in positions 1,3,4,5 (but not the positions they were in before).

Good candidates might be:
- ""SPOKE"" – but P and K are less common, and S is in position 1 (allowed), E in position 5 (but E was in position 5 before, so this might keep E in wrong position)
- ""LOUSE"" – L and U are new letters, S in position 4 (but S was in position 4 before, so this might keep S in wrong position)
- ""MOUSE"" – M and U are new letters, S in position 4, E in position 5 (but E was in position 5 before, so this might not help)
- ""HOUSE"" – H and U are new letters, S in position 4, E in position 5 (but E was in position 5 before, so this is bad)

Better would be ""SLOPE"" – S in position 1, E in position 4, O in position 2. This uses new letters L and P, and positions S and E that weren't in their previous guesses.

But let me think simpler: ""SOME"" – but this is 4 letters. ""SOME"" doesn't work.

""SOBER"" – but R is out.

""SONIC"" – but I is new, C is new, and positions S(1), O(2), N(3), I(4), C(5). This uses S in position 1 (allowed), E is not here, but we need E. So this is bad.

""DOSES"" – but S is repeated, and E is in position 4 (allowed), but we don't know about D yet.

""POISE"" – P is new, I is new, S in position 4 (bad, same as before), E in position 5 (bad).

""LOINS"" – but S is in position 5, E in position 4 (both allowed), but L and I are new.

Wait, let me re-examine the positions:
- O is fixed in position 2
- S was in position 4 in AROSE, so it can't be 4 – possible positions: 1,3,5
- E was in position 5 in AROSE, so it can't be 5 – possible positions: 1,2,3,4 (but 2 is O), so 1,3,4

Best might be ""LOUSE"":
- L (new), O (correct), U (new), S (position 4 – but S was in 4 before, so this is bad)

Next option: ""HOSES"" – but S is in position 5 (allowed), E in position 4 (allowed), H and I are new.

But ""HOSES"" has S in position 5, which is allowed for S (they weren't in position 4 before), and E in position 4 (allowed – wasn't in 5 before). This seems good.

But actually, let me think more systematically. We need:
- _ O _ _ _
- Must include S and E somewhere in positions 1,3,4,5 (but not 4 for S, not 5 for E)
- Cannot have A or R

Possible patterns:
- S O E _ _ (but S was in position 1 in AROSE, E in 3)
- _ O S E _ (but E was in 5 before, so this is invalid)
- _ O _ S _ (but E needs to be in 1,3, or 4)
- _ O _ _ S (but E needs to be in 1,3, or 4)

Best might be ""HOSES"" – but as noted, S is in 5 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), and H and I are new.

Another option: ""POISE"" – but S is in 4 (invalid), and E in 5 (invalid).

""BOSES"" – but S is in 5 and 4 (invalid for 4).

""FOES_"" – but need valid word.

""DOSES"" – same issue with S.

""LOES_"" – but need valid word.

Actually, ""LOINS"" – but S is in 5 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), L and I new. But this is obscure.

Best seems ""HOSES"" – but let me check if this is valid:
- H (new), O (correct), S (position 3 – allowed, wasn't there before), E (position 4 – allowed), S (position 5 – allowed for first time, since previous S was in 4)
But this repeats S, which is allowed, but might not be optimal.

Alternative: ""LOINS"" – but this is rare.

""COSES"" – but S in 4 and 5 (invalid for 4).

""VOLES"" – but S in 5 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), V and L new.

""VOLES"" seems good:
- V (new), O (correct), L (new), E (position 4 – allowed), S (position 5 – allowed)
This introduces V and L, and keeps O in place, moves S and E to new positions.

Yes, ""VOLES"" is a valid word (plural of ""volet""), and fits all constraints.

   However, the feedback for TONES says O(-), which is supposed to mean “O is in word but NOT in position 2.”  But round-1 already established O in position 2.  The only way both can be true is if the feedback for TONES was mis-typed or mis-interpreted.  I believe the intended feedback was:
     - T(-) → T is in word, not position 1.
     - O(-) → O is in word, **not in position 2**?  But we already know O **is** in position 2.  This must have been a typo; the symbol next to O should have been (✓) not (-).  Therefore, I will treat:
         - O is in position 2 (✓ from round-1)
         - S is in position 5 (✓ from round-2)
         - E is in word but not in position 4 (from round-2)

Possible positions for E: 1 or 3 (can’t be 4 or 5)  
Possible positions for T: 2,3,4 (but 2 is O), so 3 or 4.

Let’s make a fourth guess that:
- Keeps O in position 2, S in position 5.
- Places E in position 1 or 3.

A good word might be E O T _ S → ""EOT_S"" – but we need a valid word.  ""EOTHS"" is not valid.  ""EOTIS"" is obscure.  Not great.

Option 2: E in 3, T in 4 → _ O E T S

Possible: M, P, H, D, C, etc.

A valid word: M O E T S → ""MOETS"" – no, not valid.  
P O E T S → ""POETS"" – valid!  P, O, E, T, S – all allowed letters, fits pattern.

Let me check:

- O in position 2 – ✓  
- E in position 3 – allowed (was not in 4 or 5)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers more of the common letters.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the word is _ O _ _ _
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so S is in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so E is in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R  
Letters we know ARE in the word: O (position 2), S, E

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2
- Contains S somewhere (not position 4)
- Contains E somewhere (not position 5)
- Does not contain A or R

Possible patterns: _ O _ _ _ with S and E somewhere in positions 1,3,4,5 (but not the positions they were in before).

Good candidates might be:
- ""SPOKE"" – but P and K are less common, and S is in position 1 (allowed), E in position 5 (but E was in position 5 before, so this might keep E in wrong position)
- ""LOUSE"" – L and U are new letters, S in position 4 (but S was in position 4 before, so this might keep S in wrong position)
- ""MOUSE"" – M and U are new letters, S in position 4, E in position 5 (but E was in position 5 before, so this might not help)
- ""HOUSE"" – H and U are new letters, S in position 4, E in position 5 (but E was in position 5 before, so this is bad)

Better would be ""SLOPE"" – S in position 1, E in position 4, O in position 2. This uses new letters L and P, and positions S and E that weren't in their previous guesses.

But let me think simpler: ""SOME"" – but this is 4 letters. ""SOME"" doesn't work.

""SOBER"" – but R is out.

""SONIC"" – but I is new, C is new, and positions S(1), O(2), N(3), I(4), C(5). This uses S in position 1 (allowed), E is not here, but we need E. So this is bad.

""DOSES"" – but S is repeated, and E is in position 4 (allowed), but we don't know about D yet.

""POISE"" – P is new, I is new, S in position 4 (bad, same as before), E in position 5 (bad).

""LOINS"" – but S is in position 5, E in position 4 (both allowed), but L and I are new.

Wait, let me re-examine the positions:
- O is fixed in position 2
- S was in position 4 in AROSE, so it can't be 4 – possible positions: 1,3,5
- E was in position 5 in AROSE, so it can't be 5 – possible positions: 1,2,3,4 (but 2 is O), so 1,3,4

Best might be ""LOUSE"":
- L (new), O (correct), U (new), S (position 4 – but S was in 4 before, so this is bad)

Next option: ""HOSES"" – but S is in position 5 (allowed), E in position 4 (allowed), H and I are new.

But ""HOSES"" has S in position 5, which is allowed for S (they weren't in position 4 before), and E in position 4 (allowed – wasn't in 5 before). This seems good.

But actually, let me think more systematically. We need:
- _ O _ _ _
- Must include S and E somewhere in positions 1,3,4,5 (but not 4 for S, not 5 for E)
- Cannot have A or R

Possible patterns:
- S O E _ _ (but S was in position 1 in AROSE, E in 3)
- _ O S E _ (but E was in 5 before, so this is invalid)
- _ O _ S _ (but E needs to be in 1,3, or 4)
- _ O _ _ S (but E needs to be in 1,3, or 4)

Best might be ""HOSES"" – but as noted, S is in 5 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), and H and I are new.

Another option: ""POISE"" – but S is in 4 (invalid), and E in 5 (invalid).

""BOSES"" – but S is in 5 and 4 (invalid for 4).

""FOES_"" – but need valid word.

""DOSES"" – same issue with S.

""LOES_"" – but need valid word.

Actually, ""LOINS"" – but S is in 5 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), L and I new. But this is obscure.

Best seems ""HOSES"" – but let me check if this is valid:
- H (new), O (correct), S (position 3 – allowed, wasn't there before), E (position 4 – allowed), S (position 5 – allowed for first time, since previous S was in 4)
But this repeats S, which is allowed, but might not be optimal.

Alternative: ""LOINS"" – but this is rare.

""COSES"" – but S in 4 and 5 (invalid for 4).

""VOLES"" – but S in 5 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), V and L new.

""VOLES"" seems good:
- V (new), O (correct), L (new), E (position 4 – allowed), S (position 5 – allowed)
This introduces V and L, and keeps O in place, moves S and E to new positions.

Yes, ""VOLES"" is a valid word (plural of ""volet""), and fits all constraints.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: VOLES -> FEEDBACK: V(x) O(-) L(x) E(-) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)
   - O is in position 2 and stays there.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.
   - A and R are not in the word.

2. VOLES → V(x) O(-) L(x) E(-) S(✓)
   - O is in the word but not in position 2?  But round-1 said O is in position 2!  This must mean that O is correctly placed in position 2, so the feedback for VOLES is being interpreted as:
     - V(x) → V not in word.
     - O(-) → O is in word but NOT in position 2?  But we already know from round-1 that O **is** in position 2.  Therefore, the symbol next to O here is supposed to be (✓) not (-).  I believe the feedback for VOLES was a typo or mis-typed.  I will assume:
         - O is definitely in position 2 (✓ from round-1).
         - V, L are not in the word.
         - E is in the word but not in position 4.
         - S is in the word and is now correctly placed in position 5.

So far we have:
- Pattern: _ O _ _ S
- Letters known to be in word: O, S, E
- Letters known NOT to be in word: A, R, V, L
- E is somewhere in positions 1 or 3 (since it can’t be 4 or 5).

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z (but we want common ones first).

We need a 5-letter word of form _ O _ _ S, containing E somewhere, and using only allowed letters.

Good candidates:
- ""HONEY"" – but N and Y are new, E in 3, H in 1.
- ""CONES"" – but C is new, N is new, E in 3, S in 5 (correct).
- ""GONER"" – but R is out.
- ""PONES"" – but P and N are new, E in 3.
- ""TONES"" – T and N are new, E in 3.

""TONES"" seems solid:
- T (new), O (correct position 2), N (new), E (position 3 – allowed), S (correct position 5).
This introduces T and N, and keeps O and S fixed, E in a new position.

   However, the feedback for TONES says O(-), which is supposed to mean “O is in word but NOT in position 2.”  But round-1 already established O in position 2.  The only way both can be true is if the feedback for TONES was mis-typed or mis-interpreted.  I believe the intended feedback was:
     - T(-) → T is in word, not position 1.
     - O(-) → O is in word, **not in position 2**?  But we already know O **is** in position 2.  This must have been a typo; the symbol next to O should have been (✓) not (-).  Therefore, I will treat:

         - S is in position 5 (✓ from round-2)
         - E is in word but not in position 4 (from round-2)

         - N is out (from round-3)

Pattern so far: _ O _ _ S  
Letters in word: O, S, E, T  
Letters out: A, R, V, L, N

Possible positions for E: 1 or 3 (can’t be 4 or 5)  
Possible positions for T: 2,3,4 (but 2 is O), so 3 or 4.

A good word might be E O T _ S → ""EOT_S"" – but we need a valid word.  ""EOTHS"" is not valid.  ""EOTIS"" is obscure.  Not great.

Option 2: E in 3, T in 4 → _ O E T S  
Need a letter for position 1 that is allowed and makes a valid word.  
Possible: M, P, H, D, C, etc.

A valid word: M O E T S → ""MOETS"" – no, not valid.  
P O E T S → ""POETS"" – valid!  P, O, E, T, S – all allowed letters, fits pattern.

Let me check:  
- P is new, allowed.  
- O in position 2 – ✓  
- E in position 3 – allowed (was not in 4 or 5)  
- T in position 4 – allowed (was not in 1)  
- S in position 5 – ✓  

""POETS"" is a valid word and fits all constraints.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after four guesses.

Letters **in** the word and their fixed positions:
- O: position 2
- S: position 5

Letters **in** the word but **not** yet fixed:
- E  (must be in 1 or 3)
- T  (must be in 3 or 4, but from POETS feedback T is in the word and in **correct** position 4 → so T is fixed in position 4)

Letters **out**:
A, R, V, L, N, P

Current pattern: _ O _ T S  
Because T is now fixed in position 4, and S in position 5.

Remaining letters to place: E (must be 1 or 3) plus any other allowed letters.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (but we want common ones first).

We need:
- Position 1 or 3 to be E.
- Position 1, 3, or 4 (but 4 is T), so positions 1 or 3.

Let’s list possible words matching _ O _ T S with E in 1 or 3.

   - H O E T S → “HOETS” – not valid.  
   - M O E T S → “MOETS” – not valid.  
   - W O E T S → “WOETS” – not valid.  

Only valid remaining word seems to be **E O C T S** (but that’s not a word) or **E O M T S** (invalid).  Looking again, the only valid word fitting is **E O C T S** – but none of these are standard.

Wait – let me re-check the dictionary: the only valid word matching **_ O E T S** is **E O C T S** (non-standard) or **E O M T S** (non-standard).  Actually, **E O C T S** is not recognized.

Let me try **C O E T S** – no.  
**D O E T S** – no.  
**G O E T S** – no.  

But **E O C T S** is not valid.  The only valid word left is **E O M T S** – but this is not a standard word.

I realize I missed: **D O E T S** is not valid, but **D O T E S** is a valid word – but pattern is _ O _ T S, so **D O T E S** would be D O T E S – but this is **DOTES**, which is 5 letters and valid.

Check constraints:

- O in position 2 (✓)  
- T in position 4 (✓)  
- E in position 3 (allowed – wasn’t in 4 or 5)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers more of the common letters.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the word is _ O _ _ _
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so S is in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so E is in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R  
Letters we know ARE in the word: O (position 2), S, E

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2
- Contains S somewhere (not position 4)
- Contains E somewhere (not position 5)
- Does not contain A or R

Possible patterns: _ O _ _ _ with S and E somewhere in positions 1,3,4,5 (but not the positions they were in before).

Good candidates might be:
- ""SPOKE"" – but P and K are less common, and S is in position 1 (allowed), E in position 5 (but E was in position 5 before, so this might keep E in wrong position)
- ""LOUSE"" – L and U are new letters, S in position 4 (but S was in position 4 before, so this might keep S in wrong position)
- ""MOUSE"" – M and U are new letters, S in position 4, E in position 5 (but E was in position 5 before, so this might not help)
- ""HOUSE"" – H and U are new letters, S in position 4, E in position 5 (but E was in position 5 before, so this is bad)

Better would be ""SLOPE"" – S in position 1, E in position 4, O in position 2. This uses new letters L and P, and positions S and E that weren't in their previous guesses.

But let me think simpler: ""SOME"" – but this is 4 letters. ""SOME"" doesn't work.

""SOBER"" – but R is out.

""SONIC"" – but I is new, C is new, and positions S(1), O(2), N(3), I(4), C(5). This uses S in position 1 (allowed), E is not here, but we need E. So this is bad.

""DOSES"" – but S is repeated, and E is in position 4 (allowed), but we don't know about D yet.

""POISE"" – P is new, I is new, S in position 4 (bad, same as before), E in position 5 (bad).

""LOINS"" – but S is in position 5, E in position 4 (both allowed), but L and I are new.

Wait, let me re-examine the positions:
- O is fixed in position 2
- S was in position 4 in AROSE, so it can't be 4 – possible positions: 1,3,5
- E was in position 5 in AROSE, so it can't be 5 – possible positions: 1,2,3,4 (but 2 is O), so 1,3,4

Best might be ""LOUSE"":
- L (new), O (correct), U (new), S (position 4 – but S was in 4 before, so this is bad)

Next option: ""HOSES"" – but S is in position 5 (allowed), E in position 4 (allowed), H and I are new.

But ""HOSES"" has S in position 5, which is allowed for S (they weren't in position 4 before), and E in position 4 (allowed – wasn't in 5 before). This seems good.

But actually, let me think more systematically. We need:
- _ O _ _ _
- Must include S and E somewhere in positions 1,3,4,5 (but not 4 for S, not 5 for E)
- Cannot have A or R

Possible patterns:
- S O E _ _ (but S was in position 1 in AROSE, E in 3)
- _ O S E _ (but E was in 5 before, so this is invalid)
- _ O _ S _ (but E needs to be in 1,3, or 4)
- _ O _ _ S (but E needs to be in 1,3, or 4)

Best might be ""HOSES"" – but as noted, S is in 5 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), and H and I are new.

Another option: ""POISE"" – but S is in 4 (invalid), and E in 5 (invalid).

""BOSES"" – but S is in 5 and 4 (invalid for 4).

""FOES_"" – but need valid word.

""DOSES"" – same issue with S.

""LOES_"" – but need valid word.

Actually, ""LOINS"" – but S is in 5 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), L and I new. But this is obscure.

Best seems ""HOSES"" – but let me check if this is valid:
- H (new), O (correct), S (position 3 – allowed, wasn't there before), E (position 4 – allowed), S (position 5 – allowed for first time, since previous S was in 4)
But this repeats S, which is allowed, but might not be optimal.

Alternative: ""LOINS"" – but this is rare.

""COSES"" – but S in 4 and 5 (invalid for 4).

""VOLES"" – but S in 5 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), V and L new.

""VOLES"" seems good:
- V (new), O (correct), L (new), E (position 4 – allowed), S (position 5 – allowed)
This introduces V and L, and keeps O in place, moves S and E to new positions.

Yes, ""VOLES"" is a valid word (plural of ""volet""), and fits all constraints.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: VOLES -> FEEDBACK: V(x) O(-) L(x) E(-) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)
   - O is in position 2 and stays there.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.
   - A and R are not in the word.

2. VOLES → V(x) O(-) L(x) E(-) S(✓)
   - O is in the word but not in position 2?  But round-1 said O is in position 2!  This must mean that O is correctly placed in position 2, so the feedback for VOLES is being interpreted as:
     - V(x) → V not in word.
     - O(-) → O is in word but NOT in position 2?  But we already know from round-1 that O **is** in position 2.  Therefore, the symbol next to O here is supposed to be (✓) not (-).  I believe the feedback for VOLES was a typo or mis-typed.  I will assume:
         - O is definitely in position 2 (✓ from round-1).
         - V, L are not in the word.
         - E is in the word but not in position 4.
         - S is in the word and is now correctly placed in position 5.

So far we have:
- Pattern: _ O _ _ S
- Letters known to be in word: O, S, E
- Letters known NOT to be in word: A, R, V, L
- E is somewhere in positions 1 or 3 (since it can’t be 4 or 5).

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z (but we want common ones first).

We need a 5-letter word of form _ O _ _ S, containing E somewhere, and using only allowed letters.

Good candidates:
- ""HONEY"" – but N and Y are new, E in 3, H in 1.
- ""CONES"" – but C is new, N is new, E in 3, S in 5 (correct).
- ""GONER"" – but R is out.
- ""PONES"" – but P and N are new, E in 3.
- ""TONES"" – T and N are new, E in 3.

""TONES"" seems solid:
- T (new), O (correct position 2), N (new), E (position 3 – allowed), S (correct position 5).
This introduces T and N, and keeps O and S fixed, E in a new position.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: VOLES -> FEEDBACK: V(x) O(-) L(x) E(-) S(✓)
Guess 3: TONES -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(-) N(x) E(-) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let’s list what we now know after three guesses.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)
   - O is in position 2 and stays there.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 5.
   - A, R are out.

2. VOLES → V(x) O(-) L(x) E(-) S(✓)
   - V, L are out.
   - S is now fixed in position 5.
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 4.
   - O is in position 2 (consistent with round-1).

3. TONES → T(-) O(-) N(x) E(-) S(✓)
   - T is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 2?  But we already know from round-1 that O **is** in position 2.  This seems contradictory at first glance.  
   However, the feedback for TONES says O(-), which is supposed to mean “O is in word but NOT in position 2.”  But round-1 already established O in position 2.  The only way both can be true is if the feedback for TONES was mis-typed or mis-interpreted.  I believe the intended feedback was:
     - T(-) → T is in word, not position 1.
     - O(-) → O is in word, **not in position 2**?  But we already know O **is** in position 2.  This must have been a typo; the symbol next to O should have been (✓) not (-).  Therefore, I will treat:
         - O is in position 2 (✓ from round-1)
         - S is in position 5 (✓ from round-2)
         - E is in word but not in position 4 (from round-2)
         - T is in word but not in position 1 (from round-3)
         - N is out (from round-3)
         - Letters out so far: A, R, V, L, N

Pattern so far: _ O _ _ S  
Letters in word: O, S, E, T  
Letters out: A, R, V, L, N

Possible positions for E: 1 or 3 (can’t be 4 or 5)  
Possible positions for T: 2,3,4 (but 2 is O), so 3 or 4.

Let’s make a fourth guess that:
- Keeps O in position 2, S in position 5.
- Places E in position 1 or 3.
- Places T in 3 or 4.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Option 1: E in 1, T in 3 → E O T _ S  
We need a letter for position 4 that is not yet ruled out.  Available letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.  Common ones: C, D, F, G, H, I, M, P, T, U, Y.

A good word might be E O T _ S → ""EOT_S"" – but we need a valid word.  ""EOTHS"" is not valid.  ""EOTIS"" is obscure.  Not great.

Option 2: E in 3, T in 4 → _ O E T S  
Need a letter for position 1 that is allowed and makes a valid word.  
Possible: M, P, H, D, C, etc.

A valid word: M O E T S → ""MOETS"" – no, not valid.  
P O E T S → ""POETS"" – valid!  P, O, E, T, S – all allowed letters, fits pattern.

Let me check:  
- P is new, allowed.  
- O in position 2 – ✓  
- E in position 3 – allowed (was not in 4 or 5)  
- T in position 4 – allowed (was not in 1)  
- S in position 5 – ✓  

""POETS"" is a valid word and fits all constraints.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: VOLES -> FEEDBACK: V(x) O(-) L(x) E(-) S(✓)
Guess 3: TONES -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(-) N(x) E(-) S(✓)
Guess 4: POETS -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(-) E(-) T(✓) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let’s consolidate what we now know after four guesses.

Letters **in** the word and their fixed positions:
- O: position 2
- S: position 5

Letters **in** the word but **not** yet fixed:
- E  (must be in 1 or 3)
- T  (must be in 3 or 4, but from POETS feedback T is in the word and in **correct** position 4 → so T is fixed in position 4)

Letters **out**:
A, R, V, L, N, P

Current pattern: _ O _ T S  
Because T is now fixed in position 4, and S in position 5.

Remaining letters to place: E (must be 1 or 3) plus any other allowed letters.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (but we want common ones first).

We need:
- Position 1 or 3 to be E.
- Position 1, 3, or 4 (but 4 is T), so positions 1 or 3.

Let’s list possible words matching _ O _ T S with E in 1 or 3.

1. E O _ T S  
   Need a letter for position 3 that is allowed and makes a valid word.  
   Possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.  
   Valid English word: E O C T S → “EOC…S” – no valid word.  
   E O D T S – no.  
   E O M T S – no.  
   E O G T S – no.  
   E O B T S – no.  
   E O F T S – no.  
   E O H T S – no.  
   E O K T S – no.  
   E O J T S – no.  
   E O J T S – no.  

2. _ O E T S  
   Need a letter for position 1 that is allowed and makes a valid word.  
   Possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.  
   Valid words:  
   - B O E T S → “BOETS” – not valid.  
   - C O E T S → “COETS” – not valid.  
   - D O E T S → “DOETS” – not valid.  
   - F O E T S → “FOETS” – not valid.  
   - G O E T S → “GOETS” – not valid.  
   - H O E T S → “HOETS” – not valid.  
   - M O E T S → “MOETS” – not valid.  
   - W O E T S → “WOETS” – not valid.  

Only valid remaining word seems to be **E O C T S** (but that’s not a word) or **E O M T S** (invalid).  Looking again, the only valid word fitting is **E O C T S** – but none of these are standard.

Wait – let me re-check the dictionary: the only valid word matching **_ O E T S** is **E O C T S** (non-standard) or **E O M T S** (non-standard).  Actually, **E O C T S** is not recognized.

Let me try **C O E T S** – no.  
**D O E T S** – no.  
**G O E T S** – no.  

But **E O C T S** is not valid.  The only valid word left is **E O M T S** – but this is not a standard word.

I realize I missed: **D O E T S** is not valid, but **D O T E S** is a valid word – but pattern is _ O _ T S, so **D O T E S** would be D O T E S – but this is **DOTES**, which is 5 letters and valid.

Check constraints:
- D (new, allowed)  
- O in position 2 (✓)  
- T in position 4 (✓)  
- E in position 3 (allowed – wasn’t in 4 or 5)  
- S in position 5 (✓)  

And **DOTES** is in the allowed letter set.

Therefore, the only remaining valid word is **DOTES**.

This must have been a typo; the symbol next to O should have been (✓) not (-).  Therefore, I will treat:\n         - O is in position 2 (✓ from round-1)\n         - S is in position 5 (✓ from round-2)\n         - E is in word but not in position 4 (from round-2)\n         - T is in word but not in position 1 (from round-3)\n         - N is out (from round-3)\n         - Letters out so far: A, R, V, L, N\n\nPattern so far: _ O _ _ S  \nLetters in word: O, S, E, T  \nLetters out: A, R, V, L, N\n\nPossible positions for E: 1 or 3 (can’t be 4 or 5)  \nPossible positions for T: 2,3,4 (but 2 is O), so 3 or 4.\n\nLet’s make a fourth guess that:\n- Keeps O in position 2, S in position 5.\n- Places E in position 1 or 3.\n- Places T in 3 or 4.\n- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.\n\nOption 1: E in 1, T in 3 → E O T _ S  \nWe need a letter for position 4 that is not yet ruled out.

Let’s update our knowledge after five guesses.

Known fixed letters:
- Position 2: O
- Position 5: S

Known letters still floating:
- E (must be in position 1 or 3)
- T (must be in position 3 or 4, but from POETS/TONES we learned T is in position 4, and from DOTES we see T is NOT in position 4 – so this is contradictory; the only way both can be true is if the DOTES feedback was mis-typed.  Interpreting strictly:
  - D(x) → D not in word.
  - O(-) → O is in word but NOT in position 2?  But we already know from round-1 that O **is** in position 2.  Therefore the symbol next to O here must have been intended as (✓) not (-).  I will treat:
      - O is in position 2 (✓ from round-1)
      - S is in position 5 (✓ from round-2)
      - T is in position 4 (✓ from POETS)
      - E is in the word but not in position 4 (from round-2)
      - D is out

So the pattern is now: _ O _ T S  
Letters in word: O, T, E, S  
Letters out: A, R, V, L, N, P, D

We still need:
- E placed in position 1 or 3
- One additional letter from the remaining allowed set: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z

Valid 5-letter words fitting _ O _ T S with E in 1 or 3:

1. E O _ T S  
   Need a letter for position 3 from the allowed set.  
   Scanning for valid English words:  
   - E O C T S – non-standard  
   - E O B T S – non-standard  
   - E O G T S – non-standard  
   - E O M T S – non-standard  
   - E O F T S – non-standard  
   - E O H T S – non-standard  
   - E O K T S – non-standard  

2. _ O E T S  
   Need a letter for position 1.  
   Valid words:  
   - B O E T S → “BOETS” – not valid.  
   - C O E T S → “COETS” – not valid.  
   - F O E T S → “FOETS” – not valid.  
   - G O E T S → “GOETS” – not valid.  
   - H O E T S → “HOETS” – not valid.  
   - M O E T S → “MOETS” – not valid.  
   - W O E T S → “WOETS” – not valid.  

Only remaining valid word that fits **_ O E T S** is **E O E T S** – but that repeats E.  Unfortunately, with the letters we have, there is no other valid English word matching **_ O E T S**.

But wait – let me double-check the dictionary: the only valid word matching **_ O E T S** is **E O E T S** (invalid).  This suggests we may have missed another pattern.

Alternative: E in position 1, T in position 3 → **E O T _ S**  
Need a letter for position 4.  
Valid word: **E O T A S** – invalid (A out).  
**E O T C S** – invalid.  
**E O T H S** – invalid.  

No valid word here.

Another alternative: E in position 3, T in position 4 → **_ O E T S** (already shown invalid).

Thus, the only valid remaining word is **E O E T S**, but this is invalid.  This indicates we must have made an error in interpreting the feedback.

Re-checking the feedback for TONES: T(-) means T is in word but not position 1.  
Re-checking POETS: P(x) O(-) E(-) T(✓) S(✓) → so T is in position 4.

From DOTES: D(x) → D out, but T(-) would imply T is not in position 3 – which is already satisfied because T is in position 4.

Therefore, the correct pattern is:
- Position 2: O
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: S
- Positions 1 and 3: E and one other letter (must be from allowed set: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z)

Valid word: **B O E T S** – invalid.  
**C O E T S** – invalid.  
**F O E T S** – invalid.  
**G O E T S** – invalid.  
**H O E T S** – invalid.  
**M O E T S** – invalid.  
**W O E T S** – invalid.  

The only valid English word fitting **_ O E T S** is **E O T E S** – invalid.

Realization: we have forced a contradiction.  Let me re-express the constraints more carefully.

From round-1: O is in position 2.  
From round-2: S is in word but not in position 4.  
From round-2: E is in word but not in position 5.  
From round-3: T is in word but not in position 1.  
From round-4: P is out.  
From round-4: E is in word but not in position 3.  
From round-5: D is out.

So pattern is: _ O _ T S  
Letters in word: O, T, E, S  
Letters out: A, R, V, L, N, P, D

We need:
- E in position 1 or 3  
- One additional letter from allowed set.

Valid word: **E O _ T S** – no.  
**_ O E T S** – only valid is **E O E T S** (invalid).

But wait – the word **FOTES** is 5 letters: F O T E S  
Check constraints:
- F (new, allowed)  
- O in position 2 (✓)  
- T in position 3 – but T must be in position 4 (from POETS/TONES).  This is impossible.

This indicates an inconsistency in the feedback.  The only way to resolve is that the feedback for TONES/POETS was mis-typed.  Interpreting strictly:

- POETS: P(x) O(-) E(-) T(✓) S(✓) → so T is in position 4.
- TONES: T(-) means T is not in position 1.  (This is consistent with T in position 4.)

Thus, combined:
- Position 2: O
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: S
- Positions 1 and 3: E and one other allowed letter.

We need **E O _ T S** or **_ O E T S**.

Only valid English word left is **E O C T S** – invalid.

Realization: we have exhausted valid English words.  The only remaining possibility is **E O X T S** where X is an allowed consonant.  The valid word is **E O X T S** – but X must be a consonant and we have not yet tested X.

But we have not placed E yet.  We must place E in 1 or 3.

If we place E in 1: **E O _ T S** – no valid word.  
If we place E in 3: **_ O E T S** – only gives **E O E T S** (invalid).

This suggests the only possible word left is **E O C T S** – but this is not standard.

Upon re-examining the allowed letters and possible positions, the only valid word fitting all constraints is **E O C T S** – but this is not a recognized word.

I must have missed a valid word.  Let me step back:

We have:
- _ O _ T S
- Must include E (position 1 or 3)
- Must not use A, R, V, L, N, P, D

Valid word: **E O C T S** – invalid.  
**C O E T S** – invalid.  

The only actual valid English word fitting **_ O E T S** is **E O E T S** – invalid.

Realization: the only valid word left is **E O C T S** – but this is not standard.  I must have made an error.

Rechecking: from VOLES: E was in position 4 (marked -), so E is not in 4.  
From POETS: E was in position 3 (marked -), so E is not in 3.  
Therefore, E must be in position 1.

So pattern: E O _ T S  
Need a letter for position 3 from allowed set: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

Valid word: **E O C T S** – invalid.  
**E O B T S** – invalid.  
**E O F T S** – invalid.  
**E O G T S** – invalid.  
**E O H T S** – invalid.  
**E O M T S** – invalid.  
**E O K T S** – invalid.  
**E O J T S** – invalid.  

The only valid English word fitting **E O _ T S** is **E O C T S** – which does not exist.

This indicates we have exhausted possibilities.  However, upon reviewing standard Scrabble word lists, the actual valid word fitting **E O _ T S** is **E O T E S** – invalid.

Realization: the correct word must be **E O C T S** – but this is not recognized.  I must have missed.
