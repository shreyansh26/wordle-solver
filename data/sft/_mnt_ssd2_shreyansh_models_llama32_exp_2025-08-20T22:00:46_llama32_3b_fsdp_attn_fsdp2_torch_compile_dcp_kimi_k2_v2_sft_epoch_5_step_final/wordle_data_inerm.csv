1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, while maximizing the information we gain from the feedback.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" which covers very common letters including S, L, A, T, E. These letters appear in many 5-letter words, so this is also a strong first guess.

Between these options, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes the letter L which is also quite common and appears in many positions across different words.

- Uses E in position 4 (not 5, so it satisfies the feedback).
- Avoids S, L, A, T.
- Introduces C, R, O, N, which are all common and haven't been tested yet.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, while maximizing the information we gain from the feedback.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" which covers very common letters including S, L, A, T, E. These letters appear in many 5-letter words, so this is also a strong first guess.

Between these options, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes the letter L which is also quite common and appears in many positions across different words.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E, but NOT in the 5th position.
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T at all.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses E somewhere except the last slot.
2. Avoids S, L, A, T.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants to try: R, N, C, H, M, D, G, B, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U.

A strong next guess would be ""CRONE"":
- Uses E in position 4 (not 5, so it satisfies the feedback).
- Avoids S, L, A, T.
- Introduces C, R, O, N, which are all common and haven't been tested yet.

Guess 2: CRONE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) O(x) N(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 (SLATE):
- S, L, A, T are out.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Round 2 (CRONE):
- C, O are out.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (confirms round-1).

Known letters so far:
- E: present, possible positions 1-4
- R: present, possible positions 1,3,4,5 (not 2)
- N: present, possible positions 1,2,3,5 (not 4)

Letters definitely absent: S, L, A, T, C, O

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains E, R, N
- Places them in positions allowed by the feedback
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no S,L,A,T,C,O)

Let’s try to put E in position 3, R in position 1, N in position 2, and pick a consonant for the last slot that hasn’t been used yet and is common.  
A good candidate is “NERVE”:
- N in position 1 (allowed)
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- R in position 3 (allowed)
- V is a new consonant not yet tested.
- E in position 5 is forbidden (from SLATE), so “NERVE” is invalid because it ends in E.

Next option: “REIGN”
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- I (new vowel)
- G (new consonant)
- N in position 5 (allowed)

This satisfies all constraints.

2. Places each of E,R,I,N in positions allowed by the feedback.
3. Adds one new consonant (must be from the unused alphabet excluding the ruled-out set).

Unused consonants (common ones): B, D, F, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

A quick scan for common patterns:
- “INERT” uses I,N,E,R,T – but T is ruled out.
- “NERVE” – V is new, but E in position 5 is ruled out.
- “RINSE” – S is ruled out.
- “DINER” – D is new, E is in position 4 (allowed), R is in position 2 (forbidden by CRONE feedback).
- “HINNY” – two Ns, but N already confirmed and we don’t know if duplicates are allowed, plus Y is uncommon.
- “PREEN” – E in position 5 ruled out.
- “URINE” – U is new, I in position 2 (allowed), N in position 3 (allowed), E in position 4 (allowed), R in position 5 (allowed).

“URINE” satisfies:
- U (new)
- R in position 5 (allowed)
- I in position 2 (allowed)
- N in position 3 (allowed)
- E in position 4 (allowed)

Letters confirmed to be in the word (-):
- E – must appear somewhere in positions 1-3 (cannot be 4 or 5)
- R – must appear somewhere in positions 1,3,4,5 (cannot be 2)
- I – must appear somewhere in positions 1,2,3,5 (cannot be 4)
- N – must appear somewhere in positions 1,2,3,5 (cannot be 4)

Positions still available for each:
E: 1,2,3
R: 1,3,4,5
I: 1,2,3,5
N: 1,2,3,5

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses only letters from the confirmed-in-word set (E,R,I,N plus any untested consonants).
2. Places each of E,R,I,N in positions allowed by the feedback.
3. Adds one new consonant (must be from the unused set: B, D, F, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y).

Looking for common patterns with the remaining letters:

Possible candidates:
- “NERDY” – D is new, but N is in position 1 (allowed), E in 2 (allowed), R in 3 (allowed), I in 4 (forbidden by URINE feedback – I cannot be in 4).
- “FIRED” – F is new, but R is in 3 (allowed), I is in 2 (allowed), E in 1 (allowed), D is new.
- “HINNY” – two Ns, but Y is uncommon and duplicates not guaranteed.
- “MIRTH” – T is ruled out.
- “PREEN” – E in 5 ruled out.
- “WIRER” – R in 3 (allowed), I in 2 (allowed), E in 4 (forbidden), W is new.

The best simple candidate is “FIRED”:
- F (new)
- I in 2 (allowed)
- R in 3 (allowed)
- E in 1 (allowed)
- D (new)

It uses every required letter in allowed positions and introduces two new consonants (F, D) to test.",Guess 5: FIRED -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(-) R(-) E(-) D(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, while maximizing the information we gain from the feedback.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" which covers very common letters including S, L, A, T, E. These letters appear in many 5-letter words, so this is also a strong first guess.

Between these options, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes the letter L which is also quite common and appears in many positions across different words.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E, but NOT in the 5th position.
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T at all.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses E somewhere except the last slot.
2. Avoids S, L, A, T.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants to try: R, N, C, H, M, D, G, B, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U.

A strong next guess would be ""CRONE"":
- Uses E in position 4 (not 5, so it satisfies the feedback).
- Avoids S, L, A, T.
- Introduces C, R, O, N, which are all common and haven't been tested yet.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: CRONE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) O(x) N(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 (SLATE):
- S, L, A, T are out.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Round 2 (CRONE):
- C, O are out.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (confirms round-1).

Known letters so far:
- E: present, possible positions 1-4
- R: present, possible positions 1,3,4,5 (not 2)
- N: present, possible positions 1,2,3,5 (not 4)

Letters definitely absent: S, L, A, T, C, O

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains E, R, N
- Places them in positions allowed by the feedback
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no S,L,A,T,C,O)

Let’s try to put E in position 3, R in position 1, N in position 2, and pick a consonant for the last slot that hasn’t been used yet and is common.  
A good candidate is “NERVE”:
- N in position 1 (allowed)
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- R in position 3 (allowed)
- V is a new consonant not yet tested.
- E in position 5 is forbidden (from SLATE), so “NERVE” is invalid because it ends in E.

Next option: “REIGN”
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- I (new vowel)
- G (new consonant)
- N in position 5 (allowed)

This satisfies all constraints.

Guess 3: REIGN -> FEEDBACK: R(-) E(-) I(-) G(x) N(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let’s consolidate what we now know.

Letters ruled out (x in any position):
S, L, A, T, C, O, G

Letters confirmed to be in the word (-):
- E – must appear somewhere in positions 1-4 (cannot be 5)
- R – must appear somewhere in positions 1,3,4,5 (cannot be 2)
- I – must appear somewhere in positions 1,2,3,5 (cannot be 4)
- N – must appear somewhere in positions 1,2,3,5 (cannot be 4)

Positions still available for each:
E: 1,2,3,4
R: 1,3,4,5
I: 1,2,3,5
N: 1,2,3,5

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses only letters from the “confirmed in word” set (E,R,I,N plus any untested consonants).
2. Places each of E,R,I,N in positions allowed by the feedback.
3. Adds one new consonant (must be from the unused alphabet excluding the ruled-out set).

Unused consonants (common ones): B, D, F, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

A quick scan for common patterns:
- “INERT” uses I,N,E,R,T – but T is ruled out.
- “NERVE” – V is new, but E in position 5 is ruled out.
- “RINSE” – S is ruled out.
- “DINER” – D is new, E is in position 4 (allowed), R is in position 2 (forbidden by CRONE feedback).
- “HINNY” – two Ns, but N already confirmed and we don’t know if duplicates are allowed, plus Y is uncommon.
- “PREEN” – E in position 5 ruled out.
- “URINE” – U is new, I in position 2 (allowed), N in position 3 (allowed), E in position 4 (allowed), R in position 5 (allowed).

“URINE” satisfies:
- U (new)
- R in position 5 (allowed)
- I in position 2 (allowed)
- N in position 3 (allowed)
- E in position 4 (allowed)

No conflicts with any prior feedback.

Let’s update the state after the fourth guess URINE.

Letters ruled out (x in any position):

Letters confirmed to be in the word (-):
- E – must appear somewhere in positions 1-3 (cannot be 4 or 5)
- R – must appear somewhere in positions 1,3,4,5 (cannot be 2)
- I – must appear somewhere in positions 1,2,3,5 (cannot be 4)
- N – must appear somewhere in positions 1,2,3,5 (cannot be 4)

Positions still available for each:
E: 1,2,3
R: 1,3,4,5
I: 1,2,3,5
N: 1,2,3,5

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses only letters from the confirmed-in-word set (E,R,I,N plus any untested consonants).
2. Places each of E,R,I,N in positions allowed by the feedback.
3. Adds one new consonant (must be from the unused set: B, D, F, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y).

Looking for common patterns with the remaining letters:

Possible candidates:
- “NERDY” – D is new, but N is in position 1 (allowed), E in 2 (allowed), R in 3 (allowed), I in 4 (forbidden by URINE feedback – I cannot be in 4).
- “FIRED” – F is new, but R is in 3 (allowed), I is in 2 (allowed), E in 1 (allowed), D is new.
- “HINNY” – two Ns, but Y is uncommon and duplicates not guaranteed.
- “MIRTH” – T is ruled out.
- “PREEN” – E in 5 ruled out.
- “WIRER” – R in 3 (allowed), I in 2 (allowed), E in 4 (forbidden), W is new.

The best simple candidate is “FIRED”:
- F (new)
- I in 2 (allowed)
- R in 3 (allowed)
- E in 1 (allowed)
- D (new)

It uses every required letter in allowed positions and introduces two new consonants (F, D) to test.
