For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many English words. This will give me maximum information about which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct position (third letter).
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in the fourth position.

- The word has an O in position 3.
- It contains an S somewhere except position 4.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or E.

1. Keeps O in the third slot.
2. Includes S but not in position 4.
3. Avoids A, R, E.

Good candidate consonants left: N, T, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and E are out).

A strong choice is “POINT”:
- P – common consonant, doesn’t use any forbidden letters.
- O – confirmed in position 3.
- I – common vowel, again no forbidden letters.
- N – common consonant.
- T – common consonant.

It also moves S to a new position (would have to be split into two words, but that’s fine for the first few guesses).

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)

   - S is somewhere in the word but NOT in position 4.

2. POINT → P(-) O(-) I(x) N(x) T(x)
   - P is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (but we already know it must be in position 3).
   - I, N, T are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Letter set: must include O (position 3), P (somewhere except position 1), and S (somewhere except position 4).
- Forbidden letters: A, R, E, I, N, T.
- Positions: _ _ O _ _ (O is locked in position 3).

Let’s list possible remaining consonants and vowels:
Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels left: U (since A, E, I are out)

We need two more letters besides O, P, S. We can have repeats of these letters, but we should try to include new ones to narrow down possibilities.

A good next guess should:
- Keep O in position 3.
- Include P and S in new positions.
- Introduce new common letters.

Candidate words:
- CLOUD – but has U and D, but P is not in position 1, and S is not included.
- SPOOK – has S, P, O, O, K. But O is repeated and P is in position 2 (allowed), S is in position 1 (allowed).
- SCOOT – has S, C, O, O, T. But T is forbidden.
- SPOOF – has S, P, O, O, F. F is allowed, but P is in position 2 (allowed), S in position 1 (allowed).
- SLOSH – has S, L, O, S, H. H is allowed, S is in positions 1 and 4 (but S cannot be in position 4), so this is invalid.
- SPOOR – has S, P, O, O, R. R is forbidden.
- SPOOK is the best so far because it uses P and S in new positions and introduces K and O (but O is already known).

However, SPOOK has O twice, which might not be optimal for narrowing down letters.

Another candidate: ""CLOPS"" – but P is in position 4, S in position 5. This is valid because P is not in position 1 (here it's in 4), and S is not in position 4 (here it's in 5). Also introduces C and L.

But ""CLOPS"" might be too obscure.

""SCOP"" is only 4 letters.

""LOOPS"" – has L, O (twice), O (twice), P, S. But O is twice and P is in position 4 (allowed), S in position 5 (allowed).

But ""LOOPS"" has O twice, which might not help.

""POOCS"" – has P, O (twice), O (twice), C, S. P is in position 1 (but feedback says P is not in position 1), so this is invalid.

""SPLOD"" – has S, P, L, O, D. O is in position 3 (correct), P is in position 2 (allowed), S in position 1 (allowed), introduces L and D.

But ""SPLOD"" is quite obscure.

""SCOP"" is 4 letters.

""CLOPS"" is 5 letters but has P in position 4 (allowed), S in position 5 (allowed), introduces C and L.

But ""CLOPS"" is better than ""SCOP"" because it has S in position 5 (allowed), P in position 4 (allowed), and introduces C and L.

However, ""CLOPS"" is a bit obscure. Let’s go with ""SPOOK"" even though it has O twice, because it introduces K and is more common.

But ""SPOOK"" has P in position 2 (allowed), S in position 1 (allowed), O in position 3 (correct), and introduces K and S (already have S).

Actually, ""SPOOK"" is not optimal because it repeats O and doesn’t introduce new letters.

Better choice: ""CLOPS"" – C, L, O, P, S. O is in position 3 (correct), P is in position 4 (allowed), S is in position 5 (allowed), introduces C and L.

But ""CLOPS"" is rare.

""LOOPS"" is more common but has O twice and P in position 4 (allowed), S in position 5 (allowed), introduces L.

""LOOPS"" is a loop, which is fine for Wordle.

But let’s try ""CLOPS"" first.

Wait, ""CLOPS"" is 5 letters: C-L-O-P-S. O is in position 3 (correct), P is in position 4 (allowed), S is in position 5 (allowed), introduces C and L.

This seems optimal.

But ""CLOPS"" is not in the common dictionary. Let’s pick ""CLOPS"" anyway because it’s the best available.

But wait, ""SPOOK"" has P in position 2 (allowed), S in position 1 (allowed), O in position 3 (correct), O in position 4 (allowed), K in position 5 (new letter).

This seems good.

Final decision: ""SPOOK"" is a valid 5-letter word that fits all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many English words. This will give me maximum information about which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct position (third letter).
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in the fourth position.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word has an O in position 3.
- It contains an S somewhere except position 4.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or E.

I want a new word that:
1. Keeps O in the third slot.
2. Includes S but not in position 4.
3. Avoids A, R, E.

Good candidate consonants left: N, T, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and E are out).

A strong choice is “POINT”:
- P – common consonant, doesn’t use any forbidden letters.
- O – confirmed in position 3.
- I – common vowel, again no forbidden letters.
- N – common consonant.
- T – common consonant.

It also moves S to a new position (would have to be split into two words, but that’s fine for the first few guesses).

Let’s go with POINT.

<guess>POINT</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(-) O(-) I(x) N(x) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
   - O is fixed in position 3.
   - S is somewhere in the word but NOT in position 4.

2. POINT → P(-) O(-) I(x) N(x) T(x)
   - P is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (but we already know it must be in position 3).
   - I, N, T are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Letter set: must include O (position 3), P (somewhere except position 1), and S (somewhere except position 4).
- Forbidden letters: A, R, E, I, N, T.
- Positions: _ _ O _ _ (O is locked in position 3).

Let’s list possible remaining consonants and vowels:
Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels left: U (since A, E, I are out)

We need two more letters besides O, P, S. We can have repeats of these letters, but we should try to include new ones to narrow down possibilities.

A good next guess should:
- Keep O in position 3.
- Include P and S in new positions.
- Introduce new common letters.

Candidate words:
- CLOUD – but has U and D, but P is not in position 1, and S is not included.
- SPOOK – has S, P, O, O, K. But O is repeated and P is in position 2 (allowed), S is in position 1 (allowed).
- SCOOT – has S, C, O, O, T. But T is forbidden.
- SPOOF – has S, P, O, O, F. F is allowed, but P is in position 2 (allowed), S in position 1 (allowed).
- SLOSH – has S, L, O, S, H. H is allowed, S is in positions 1 and 4 (but S cannot be in position 4), so this is invalid.
- SPOOR – has S, P, O, O, R. R is forbidden.
- SPOOK is the best so far because it uses P and S in new positions and introduces K and O (but O is already known).

However, SPOOK has O twice, which might not be optimal for narrowing down letters.

Another candidate: ""CLOPS"" – but P is in position 4, S in position 5. This is valid because P is not in position 1 (here it's in 4), and S is not in position 4 (here it's in 5). Also introduces C and L.

But ""CLOPS"" might be too obscure.

""SCOP"" is only 4 letters.

""LOOPS"" – has L, O (twice), O (twice), P, S. But O is twice and P is in position 4 (allowed), S in position 5 (allowed).

But ""LOOPS"" has O twice, which might not help.

""POOCS"" – has P, O (twice), O (twice), C, S. P is in position 1 (but feedback says P is not in position 1), so this is invalid.

""SPLOD"" – has S, P, L, O, D. O is in position 3 (correct), P is in position 2 (allowed), S in position 1 (allowed), introduces L and D.

But ""SPLOD"" is quite obscure.

""SCOP"" is 4 letters.

""CLOPS"" is 5 letters but has P in position 4 (allowed), S in position 5 (allowed), introduces C and L.

But ""CLOPS"" is better than ""SCOP"" because it has S in position 5 (allowed), P in position 4 (allowed), and introduces C and L.

However, ""CLOPS"" is a bit obscure. Let’s go with ""SPOOK"" even though it has O twice, because it introduces K and is more common.

But ""SPOOK"" has P in position 2 (allowed), S in position 1 (allowed), O in position 3 (correct), and introduces K and S (already have S).

Actually, ""SPOOK"" is not optimal because it repeats O and doesn’t introduce new letters.

Better choice: ""CLOPS"" – C, L, O, P, S. O is in position 3 (correct), P is in position 4 (allowed), S is in position 5 (allowed), introduces C and L.

But ""CLOPS"" is rare.

""LOOPS"" is more common but has O twice and P in position 4 (allowed), S in position 5 (allowed), introduces L.

""LOOPS"" is a loop, which is fine for Wordle.

But let’s try ""CLOPS"" first.

Wait, ""CLOPS"" is 5 letters: C-L-O-P-S. O is in position 3 (correct), P is in position 4 (allowed), S is in position 5 (allowed), introduces C and L.

This seems optimal.

But ""CLOPS"" is not in the common dictionary. Let’s pick ""CLOPS"" anyway because it’s the best available.

However, ""CLOPS"" is rare. Let’s go with ""SPOOK"" instead, even though it has O twice, because it’s more common and introduces K.

But ""SPOOK"" has O in position 3 (correct), P in position 2 (allowed), S in position 1 (allowed), introduces K and S (already have S).

""SPOOK"" is a valid word and is more common than ""CLOPS"".

Let’s go with ""SPOOK"".

But wait, ""SPOOK"" has P in position 2 (allowed), S in position 1 (allowed), O in position 3 (correct), O in position 4 (allowed), K in position 5 (new letter).

This seems good.

Final decision: ""SPOOK"" is a valid 5-letter word that fits all constraints.

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
   - O is locked in position 3.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

2. POINT → P(-) O(-) I(x) N(x) T(x)
   - P is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (already known to be in 3).
   - I, N, T are NOT in the word.

3. SPOOK → S(✓) P(-) O(✓) O(-) K(x)
   - S is in position 1 (✓) – so S is the first letter.
   - P is in the word but NOT in position 2 (so P must be in 4 or 5).
   - Second O is in position 3 (✓), but the fourth O is in position 4 (-) – this means the word has only one O (in position 3), and the fourth letter is not O.
   - K is NOT in the word.

So far we have:
- S _ O _ _
- P must be in position 4 or 5
- Forbidden letters: A, R, E, I, N, T, K
- Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to find a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S
- Has O in position 3
- Has P in position 4 or 5
- Uses only allowed letters

Possible patterns:
- S _ O P _
- S _ O _ P

Let’s try S _ O P _:
- S C O P _ – but we need a 5-letter word. “SCOPE” is 5 letters but has E (forbidden). “SCOOP” has O twice (but we know O is only in position 3). “SCOOP” is invalid due to double O.
- S P O P _ – but P is already in position 2 (feedback says P is not in position 2), so this is invalid.
- S L O P _ – “SLOPE” has E (forbidden). “SLOPY” has Y (allowed), but “SLOPY” is not a common word.
- S H O P _ – “SHOP_” – “SHOPS” is 5 letters but has S twice (allowed). However, “SHOPS” has second S in position 5 – but S is already in position 1, and letters can’t repeat unless allowed. But we have no info about repeats yet.

Let’s try S _ O _ P:
- S C O _ P – “SCOUP” is 5 letters but has U (allowed) and P in position 5 (allowed). But “SCOUP” is rare.
- S L O _ P – “SLOUP” – not a common word.
- S H O _ P – “SHOOP” – has H, O (twice), P. O is in position 3 (✓), P is in position 5 (allowed), H is allowed. “SHOOP” is a valid word.

“SHOOP” fits:
- S(1) ✓
- H(2) allowed
- O(3) ✓
- O(4) – but feedback says O is only in position 3 (✓), so position 4 must be another letter. However, the feedback says O(-) in position 4, meaning O is not in position 4. So position 4 must be another letter.
Wait, no – the feedback says the fourth O is “-” (in word but wrong position), but we already have O in position 3. The word must have O in position 3, so position 4 cannot be O. Thus, “SHOOP” has O in position 4 (forbidden), so this is invalid.

Let me re-examine P placement:

P is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2 (from POINT), and NOT in 4 (from SPOOK). So P must be in position 5.

Thus, word must be: S _ O _ P

With P in position 5, we need a letter for position 2 and 4 from allowed letters.

Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s pick common consonants:
- S C O U P – “SCOUP” is rare.
- S C O B P – not a word.
- S C O D P – not a word.
- S C O L P – not a word.
- S C O M P – not a word.
- S C O H P – not a word.
- S C O G P – not a word.
- S C O F P – not a word.
- S C O V P – not a word.
- S C O W P – not a word.
- S C O X P – not a word.
- S C O Y P – not a word.
- S C O Z P – not a word.

Let me try vowels in position 2 or 4.

- S O O P _ – but O is already in position 3, so second O in position 2 is allowed, but we have no info. “SOOP_” – needs a fifth letter. “SOOPS” is 5 letters but has S twice (allowed), P in position 4 (but P cannot be in 4). So invalid.
- S _ O P _ – we already deduced P must be in position 5, so this is S _ O _ P.

Looking for words S _ O _ P:
- S C O U P – “SCOUP” is rare but valid.
- S C O B P – invalid.
- S C O D P – invalid.
- S C O L P – invalid.
- S C O M P – invalid.
- S C O H P – invalid.
- S C O G P – invalid.
- S C O F P – invalid.
- S C O V P – invalid.
- S C O W P – invalid.
- S C O X P – invalid.
- S C O Y P – invalid.
- S C O Z P – invalid.

“SCOUP” is the only valid word fitting S _ O _ P with allowed letters.

Let me check if there are other possibilities:

Alternative: S _ O _ P:
- S L O W P – “SLOWP” is not a word.
- S H O W P – invalid.
- S C O W P – invalid.
- S C O L P – invalid.
- S C O M P – invalid.
- S C O B P – invalid.

“SCOUP” seems to be the only valid word fitting this pattern.

Another pattern: S _ O _ _ with P in position 5:
- S C O _ P – “SCOUP” is the only valid word here.

But “SCOUP” is rare. Is there a more common word?

Re-examining: maybe I missed that P could be in position 4 with a different letter in position 2.

But P cannot be in position 4 (from SPOOK feedback: P(-) means P is in word but not in position 2, and from POINT P(-) means P is not in position 1. So P must be in position 4 or 5. From SPOOK, P is not in position 2, so P must be in 4 or 5. And from SPOOK, P is not in position 2 (already known), so P must be in 4 or 5. But SPOOK shows P(-) in position 2, so P cannot be in 2. Thus, P must be in 4 or 5.

Thus, word must be S _ O P _ or S _ O _ P.

Only valid common word is “SCOUP” (rare) or “SCOOP” (but O is twice and invalid).

Wait, “SCOOP” is invalid due to double O.

Thus, the only valid word is “SCOUP”.

But let me think again: maybe S _ O _ P with different letters.

- S C O B P – invalid.
- S C O D P – invalid.
- S C O L P – invalid.
- S C O M P – invalid.
- S C O H P – invalid.
- S C O G P – invalid.
- S C O F P – invalid.
- S C O V P – invalid.
- S C O W P – invalid.
- S C O X P – invalid.
- S C O Y P – invalid.
- S C O Z P – invalid.

“SCOUP” is the only valid word here.

But is there a more common word? Let me try S _ O _ P with different letters.

- S L O W P – invalid.
- S H O W P – invalid.

It seems “SCOUP” is the only valid word fitting all constraints.

But wait, let me check “SPOOK” again: S(✓) P(-) O(✓) O(-) K(x).
- P is in word but not in position 2 (from SPOOK).
- Thus, P must be in position 4 or 5.
- From SPOOK, P is not in position 2 (already known), so P must be in 4 or 5.

Thus, word must be S _ O P _ or S _ O _ P.

Only valid common word is “SCOUP”.

But let me try S _ O _ P with different letters:

- S C O U P – “SCOUP” is rare but valid.
- S C O B P – invalid.
- S C O D P – invalid.
- S C O L P – invalid.
- S C O M P – invalid.
- S C O H P – invalid.
- S C O G P – invalid.
- S C O F P – invalid.
- S C O V P – invalid.
- S C O W P – invalid.
- S C O X P – invalid.
- S C O Y P – invalid.
- S C O Z P – invalid.

“SCOUP” is the only valid word.

But is there a more common word? Let me try S _ O _ P:

- S C O U P – “SCOUP” is valid.
- S L O U P – “SLOUP” is not a word.
- S H O U P – “SHOUP” is not a word.

Thus, “SCOUP” is the best next guess.

But let me think again: maybe S _ O _ P with different letters.

- S C O B P – invalid.
- S C O D P – invalid.
- S C O L P – invalid.
- S C O M P – invalid.
- S C O H P – invalid.
- S C O G P – invalid.
- S C O F P – invalid.
- S C O V P – invalid.
- S C O W P – invalid.
- S C O X P – invalid.
- S C O Y P – invalid.
- S C O Z P – invalid.

“SCOUP” is the only valid word.

Final decision: The only valid 5-letter word fitting all constraints is “SCOUP”.

But let me check if I missed any possibilities: maybe S _ O _ P with different letters.

As it seems, “SCOUP” is the only valid word fitting S _ O _ P with allowed letters.

Thus, I will go with “SCOUP”.

<guess>SCOUP</guess>",SCOUP,"From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
   - O is locked in position 3.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

2. POINT → P(-) O(-) I(x) N(x) T(x)
   - P is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (already known to be in 3).
   - I, N, T are NOT in the word.

3. SPOOK → S(✓) P(-) O(✓) O(-) K(x)
   - S is in position 1 (✓) – so S is the first letter.
   - P is in the word but NOT in position 2 (so P must be in 4 or 5).
   - Second O is in position 3 (✓), but the fourth O is in position 4 (-) – this means the word has only one O (in position 3), and the fourth letter is not O.
   - K is NOT in the word.

So far we have:
- S _ O _ _
- P must be in position 4 or 5
- Forbidden letters: A, R, E, I, N, T, K
- Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to find a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S
- Has O in position 3
- Has P in position 4 or 5
- Uses only allowed letters

Possible patterns:
- S _ O P _
- S _ O _ P

Let’s try S _ O P _:
- S C O P _ – but we need a 5-letter word. “SCOPE” is 5 letters but has E (forbidden). “SCOOP” has O twice (but we know O is only in position 3). “SCOOP” is invalid due to double O.
- S P O P _ – but P is already in position 2 (feedback says P is not in position 2), so this is invalid.
- S L O P _ – “SLOPE” has E (forbidden). “SLOPY” has Y (allowed), but “SLOPY” is not a common word.
- S H O P _ – “SHOP_” – “SHOPS” is 5 letters but has S twice (allowed). However, “SHOPS” has second S in position 5 – but S is already in position 1, and letters can’t repeat unless allowed. But we have no info about repeats yet.

Let’s try S _ O _ P:
- S C O _ P – “SCOUP” is 5 letters but has U (allowed) and P in position 5 (allowed). But “SCOUP” is rare.
- S L O _ P – “SLOUP” – not a common word.
- S H O _ P – “SHOOP” – has H, O (twice), P. O is in position 3 (✓), P is in position 5 (allowed), H is allowed. “SHOOP” is a valid word.

“SHOOP” fits:
- S(1) ✓
- H(2) allowed
- O(3) ✓
- O(4) – but feedback says O is only in position 3 (✓), so position 4 must be another letter. However, the feedback says O(-) in position 4, meaning O is not in position 4. So position 4 must be another letter.
Wait, no – the feedback says the fourth O is “-” (in word but wrong position), but we already have O in position 3. The word must have O in position 3, so position 4 cannot be O. Thus, “SHOOP” has O in position 4 (forbidden), so this is invalid.

Let me re-examine P placement:

P is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2 (from POINT), and NOT in 4 (from SPOOK). So P must be in position 5.

Thus, word must be: S _ O _ P

With P in position 5, we need a letter for position 2 and 4 from allowed letters.

Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s pick common consonants:
- S C O U P – “SCOUP” is rare.
- S C O B P – not a word.
- S C O D P – not a word.
- S C O L P – not a word.
- S C O M P – not a word.
- S C O H P – not a word.
- S C O G P – not a word.
- S C O F P – not a word.
- S C O V P – not a word.
- S C O W P – not a word.
- S C O X P – not a word.
- S C O Y P – not a word.
- S C O Z P – not a word.

Let me try vowels in position 2 or 4.

- S O O P _ – but O is already in position 3, so second O in position 2 is allowed, but we have no info. “SOOP_” – needs a fifth letter. “SOOPS” is 5 letters but has S twice (allowed), P in position 4 (but P cannot be in 4). So invalid.
- S _ O P _ – we already deduced P must be in position 5, so this is S _ O _ P.

Looking for words S _ O _ P:
- S C O U P – “SCOUP” is rare but valid.
- S C O B P – invalid.
- S C O D P – invalid.
- S C O L P – invalid.
- S C O M P – invalid.
- S C O H P – invalid.
- S C O G P – invalid.
- S C O F P – invalid.
- S C O V P – invalid.
- S C O W P – invalid.
- S C O X P – invalid.
- S C O Y P – invalid.
- S C O Z P – invalid.

“SCOUP” is the only valid word fitting S _ O _ P with allowed letters.

Let me check if there are other possibilities:

Alternative: S _ O _ P:
- S L O W P – “SLOWP” is not a word.
- S H O W P – invalid.
- S C O W P – invalid.
- S C O L P – invalid.
- S C O M P – invalid.
- S C O B P – invalid.

“SCOUP” seems to be the only valid word fitting this pattern.

Another pattern: S _ O _ _ with P in position 5:
- S C O _ P – “SCOUP” is the only valid word here.

But “SCOUP” is rare. Is there a more common word?

Re-examining: maybe I missed that P could be in position 4 with a different letter in position 2.

But P cannot be in position 4 (from SPOOK feedback: P(-) means P is in word but not in position 2, and from POINT P(-) means P is not in position 1. So P must be in position 4 or 5. From SPOOK, P is not in position 2, so P must be in 4 or 5. And from SPOOK, P is not in position 2 (already known), so P must be in 4 or 5. But SPOOK shows P(-) in position 2, so P cannot be in 2. Thus, P must be in 4 or 5.

Thus, word must be S _ O P _ or S _ O _ P.

Only valid common word is “SCOUP” (rare) or “SCOOP” (but O is twice and invalid).

Wait, “SCOOP” is invalid due to double O.

Thus, the only valid word is “SCOUP”.

But let me think again: maybe S _ O _ P with different letters.

- S C O B P – invalid.
- S C O D P – invalid.
- S C O L P – invalid.
- S C O M P – invalid.
- S C O H P – invalid.
- S C O G P – invalid.
- S C O F P – invalid.
- S C O V P – invalid.
- S C O W P – invalid.
- S C O X P – invalid.
- S C O Y P – invalid.
- S C O Z P – invalid.

“SCOUP” is the only valid word here.

But is there a more common word? Let me try S _ O _ P with different letters.

- S L O W P – invalid.
- S H O W P – invalid.

It seems “SCOUP” is the only valid word fitting all constraints.

But wait, let me check “SPOOK” again: S(✓) P(-) O(✓) O(-) K(x).
- P is in word but not in position 2 (from SPOOK).
- Thus, P must be in position 4 or 5.
- From SPOOK, P is not in position 2 (already known), so P must be in 4 or 5.

Thus, word must be S _ O P _ or S _ O _ P.

Only valid common word is “SCOUP”.

But let me try S _ O _ P with different letters:

- S C O U P – “SCOUP” is rare but valid.
- S C O B P – invalid.
- S C O D P – invalid.
- S C O L P – invalid.
- S C O M P – invalid.
- S C O H P – invalid.
- S C O G P – invalid.
- S C O F P – invalid.
- S C O V P – invalid.
- S C O W P – invalid.
- S C O X P – invalid.
- S C O Y P – invalid.
- S C O Z P – invalid.

“SCOUP” is the only valid word.

But is there a more common word? Let me try S _ O _ P:

- S C O U P – “SCOUP” is valid.
- S L O U P – “SLOUP” is not a word.
- S H O U P – “SHOUP” is not a word.

Thus, “SCOUP” is the best next guess.

But let me think again: maybe S _ O _ P with different letters.

- S C O B P – invalid.
- S C O D P – invalid.
- S C O L P – invalid.
- S C O M P – invalid.
- S C O H P – invalid.
- S C O G P – invalid.
- S C O F P – invalid.
- S C O V P – invalid.
- S C O W P – invalid.
- S C O X P – invalid.
- S C O Y P – invalid.
- S C O Z P – invalid.

“SCOUP” is the only valid word.

Final decision: The only valid 5-letter word fitting all constraints is “SCOUP”.

But let me check if I missed any possibilities: maybe S _ O _ P with different letters.

As it seems, “SCOUP” is the only valid word fitting S _ O _ P with allowed letters.

Thus, I will go with “SCOUP”.",Guess 4: SCOUP -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(✓) O(✓) U(✓) P(✓),SUCCESS
