From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct first position (✓)
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all (x)

So the secret word starts with A and does not contain R, O, S, or E.

Next, I want to use a word that starts with A and avoids those five letters. Good consonants left to try include T, N, L, C, D, etc. and the remaining vowels are I and U.

A strong second guess would be something like ""ADMIT"" or ""ALBUM"", but I'll pick ""ADMIT"" since it uses common letters and covers several new consonants (D, M, T) while keeping the vowel I.

However, looking at the feedback system, it mentions that letters can be in the word but in the wrong position (like in AROSE where A was correct but R wasn't). Since A is locked in first position, I'll try a word that keeps A in the first spot and introduces new letters not yet tested.

Actually, a better choice might be ""ALBUM"" - it has A in the first position and uses new letters L, B, U, M that haven't been ruled out.

But let me think simpler: ""ANTIC"" uses A (locked first), N, T, I, C. Or ""ABIDE"" uses A, B, I, D, E (but E is ruled out). 

I think ""ABIDE"" is a good option since it introduces B, I, D - all new letters not tested yet. And B is a common consonant.

Wait, but E is ruled out entirely, so ""ABIDE"" has E which is invalid.

Let me pick ""ALBUM"" instead - it uses A (locked first), L, B, U, M. None of these letters have been ruled out yet.

- A + C, I, N, T: ACTIN (real word, but ACTIN uses N which is still possible)
- A + C, I, N, T: ACIDY (not a word)
- A + C, I, N, T: ACORN (but O, R, N are still possible? Wait, R is ruled out entirely)

Let me think of real words starting with A that avoid all the ruled-out letters.

Possible words:
- ACTIN (uses C, I, N, T - all still possible)
- ACIDY (but ""ACIDY"" is rare)
- ANGEL (but E, L are ruled out)
- APHID (but P, H, I, D - all still possible)
- ATOMIC (but O, M are ruled out)

""ACTIN"" seems like the best choice here - it uses common letters and covers four new letters (C, I, N, T) while keeping A in place.

But let me double-check:
- A is confirmed first letter
- C, I, N, T are not yet ruled out
- ACTIN is a valid English word

So ACTIN it is.

From the new feedback on ACTIN:
- A is still correct in position 1 (✓)
- C and T are NOT in the word (x)
- I is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so I must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so N must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5

Letters now known to be absent: R, O, S, E, L, B, U, M, C, T  
Letters known to be present: A (fixed at position 1), I, N

We need a 5-letter word starting with A, containing both I and N, and avoiding all the ruled-out letters. We also know I is NOT in position 4 (since it was marked wrong-position in ACTIN), and N is NOT in position 5 (since it was marked wrong-position in ACTIN).

Remaining possible letters (excluding the ruled-out set): A, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
But we already know A, I, N are in the word; the other two letters must come from the remaining set.

Let’s look for real English words that fit:
- A _ I N _ : “ABIN” is 4 letters; no 5-letter word
- A _ _ I N : “APHIN” (not a word), “APIN” (not a word)
- A _ N I _ : “ADNIA” (not a word), “AFINA” (not a word)
- A N _ I _ : “ANDIA” (not a word), “ANGEL” (but L is ruled out)
- A _ _ N I : “APAND” (not a word), “ASHNI” (not a word)
- A _ I N _ : “ACIDY” (but C, D, Y are still possible? Wait, D is still possible, but Y is still possible)

Actually, “ACIDY” uses C, D, Y – but C is ruled out (x in ACTIN), so no.

Another approach: list all 5-letter words starting with A, containing I and N, and avoid C, T, L, B, O, S, E, R, U, M.

Possible candidates:
- A F I N _ : “AFIN_” – nothing
- A D I N _ : “ADIN_” – “ADINA” (not a word), “ADIND” (not a word)
- A N I _ _ : “ANIXY” (no), “ANVIL” (L is out)
- A _ N I _ : “ASHNI” (not a word), “ASPIC” (C, P, I – but C is out)
- A _ I N _ : “ABIN_” – nothing (B is out), “ACIDY” – C is out
- A F I N _ : “AFIN_” – nothing

Wait, let me think differently: the word must be A _ _ _ _, with I and N somewhere in positions 2-5, and no ruled-out letters.

Possible words:
- A F I N D – but D is still possible (not ruled out), and “AFIND” is not a word
- A N I D A – but A is already in position 1, and “ANIDA” is not a word
- A N I X Y – “ANIXY” is not a word
- A N I M A – “ANIM A” is not a word
- A N I D A – same as above
- A N I S H – S is out
- A N I K E – E is out
- A N I T A – T is out
- A N I D A – not a word

Hmm, let me check “ANVIL” – but L is out.

Another candidate: “APHID” – but D is possible, and it’s a word. Let me check:
- A P H I D
- Letters: A (✓), P, H, I, D
- P, H, D are still possible (not ruled out)
- I is in the word (must be in positions 2-5)
- N is in the word (must be in positions 2-5)

But we have no info yet that N is in the word – the feedback on ACTIN only said N is in the word but wrong position (position 5), so N could be in 2,3,4.

“APHID” has N in position 4, which is allowed. And I is in position 3, also allowed.

So “APHID” seems valid:
- A (✓) first
- P, H, D are new letters not yet tested
- I is in the word (position 3)
- N is in the word (position 4)

Let me verify:
- A P H I D
- No C, T, L, B, O, S, E, R, U, M
- Starts with A, has I and N
- I is not in position 4 (it’s in 3) – ok
- N is not in position 5 (it’s in 4) – ok

This seems like the best next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers more of the common vowels and consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct first position (✓)
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all (x)

So the secret word starts with A and does not contain R, O, S, or E.

Next, I want to use a word that starts with A and avoids those five letters. Good consonants left to try include T, N, L, C, D, etc. and the remaining vowels are I and U.

A strong second guess would be something like ""ADMIT"" or ""ALBUM"", but I'll pick ""ADMIT"" since it uses common letters and covers several new consonants (D, M, T) while keeping the vowel I.

However, looking at the feedback system, it mentions that letters can be in the word but in the wrong position (like in AROSE where A was correct but R wasn't). Since A is locked in first position, I'll try a word that keeps A in the first spot and introduces new letters not yet tested.

Actually, a better choice might be ""ALBUM"" - it has A in the first position and uses new letters L, B, U, M that haven't been ruled out.

But let me think simpler: ""ANTIC"" uses A (locked first), N, T, I, C. Or ""ABIDE"" uses A, B, I, D, E (but E is ruled out). 

I think ""ABIDE"" is a good option since it introduces B, I, D - all new letters not tested yet. And B is a common consonant.

Wait, but E is ruled out entirely, so ""ABIDE"" has E which is invalid.

Let me pick ""ALBUM"" instead - it uses A (locked first), L, B, U, M. None of these letters have been ruled out yet.

Guess 2: ALBUM -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(x) B(x) U(x) M(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

So far we know:
- First letter is A (✓ in both guesses)
- Letters NOT in the word at all: R, O, S, E, L, B, U, M

That leaves the remaining letters: A (already fixed in position 1), C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We still need to determine the second, third, fourth, and fifth letters. To maximize information, I want to pick a word that uses several new, common consonants and vowels not yet ruled out.

Good candidates:
- A + C, I, N, T: ACINT (not a real word)
- A + C, I, N, T: ACTIN (real word, but ACTIN uses N which is still possible)
- A + C, I, N, T: ACIDY (not a word)
- A + C, I, N, T: ACORN (but O, R, N are still possible? Wait, R is ruled out entirely)

Let me think of real words starting with A that avoid all the ruled-out letters.

Possible words:
- ACTIN (uses C, I, N, T - all still possible)
- ACIDY (but ""ACIDY"" is rare)
- ANGEL (but E, L are ruled out)
- APHID (but P, H, I, D - all still possible)

- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, L, B, U, M, C, T, P, H, D.
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: I and N.

Remaining alphabet letters that have never been guessed (and are not ruled out):
A (fixed first), C, D, F, G, I, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word starting with A, containing both I and N, and using only the still-allowed letters.

Possible positions for I and N:
- They must appear somewhere in positions 2–5.
- They are NOT allowed in positions 4 or 5 (because in ACTIN they were marked wrong-position at 4, and in APHID they were marked wrong-position at 4 again – but wait, APHID had I at 4 and N at 5, so I is NOT allowed at 4, but N is NOT allowed at 5. So possible positions:
  – I can be 2 or 3 or 5
  – N can be 2, 3, or 4

Let’s list real 5-letter words starting with A, containing I and N, and avoiding all ruled-out letters:

- A F I N _ – nothing
- A N I _ _ – “ANVIL” (L out), “ANXIE” (not a word), “ANKLE” (K, L, E out), “ANGEL” (L, E out), “ANGIN” (not a word)

- A _ _ N I – “AFNIA” (not a word), “AGNIA” (not a word), “AVNIA” (not a word)

Looking more carefully, the only common English word that fits is “ANGEL”, but it has E and L which are ruled out.

Another candidate: “ANGIN” – not a word.

Wait, let me check “AGING”:
- A G I N G
- Letters: A (✓), G, I, N, G
- G is still allowed (never tested)
- I is in the word (position 3)
- N is in the word (position 4)

“AGING” is a valid 5-letter word, fits all constraints.

Let me verify:
- A(✓) first
- G, I, N, G – G is still allowed
- I is in the word (position 3) – ok
- N is in the word (position 4) – ok

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers more of the common vowels and consonants.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct first position (✓)
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all (x)

So the secret word starts with A and does not contain R, O, S, or E.

Next, I want to use a word that starts with A and avoids those five letters. Good consonants left to try include T, N, L, C, D, etc. and the remaining vowels are I and U.

A strong second guess would be something like ""ADMIT"" or ""ALBUM"", but I'll pick ""ADMIT"" since it uses common letters and covers several new consonants (D, M, T) while keeping the vowel I.

However, looking at the feedback system, it mentions that letters can be in the word but in the wrong position (like in AROSE where A was correct but R wasn't). Since A is locked in first position, I'll try a word that keeps A in the first spot and introduces new letters not yet tested.

Actually, a better choice might be ""ALBUM"" - it has A in the first position and uses new letters L, B, U, M that haven't been ruled out.

But let me think simpler: ""ANTIC"" uses A (locked first), N, T, I, C. Or ""ABIDE"" uses A, B, I, D, E (but E is ruled out). 

I think ""ABIDE"" is a good option since it introduces B, I, D - all new letters not tested yet. And B is a common consonant.

Wait, but E is ruled out entirely, so ""ABIDE"" has E which is invalid.

Let me pick ""ALBUM"" instead - it uses A (locked first), L, B, U, M. None of these letters have been ruled out yet.

<guess>ALBUM</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Guess 2: ALBUM -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(x) B(x) U(x) M(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

So far we know:
- First letter is A (✓ in both guesses)
- Letters NOT in the word at all: R, O, S, E, L, B, U, M

That leaves the remaining letters: A (already fixed in position 1), C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We still need to determine the second, third, fourth, and fifth letters. To maximize information, I want to pick a word that uses several new, common consonants and vowels not yet ruled out.

Good candidates:
- A + C, I, N, T: ACINT (not a real word)
- A + C, I, N, T: ACTIN (real word, but ACTIN uses N which is still possible)
- A + C, I, N, T: ACIDY (not a word)
- A + C, I, N, T: ACORN (but O, R, N are still possible? Wait, R is ruled out entirely)

Let me think of real words starting with A that avoid all the ruled-out letters.

Possible words:
- ACTIN (uses C, I, N, T - all still possible)
- ACIDY (but ""ACIDY"" is rare)
- ANGEL (but E, L are ruled out)
- APHID (but P, H, I, D - all still possible)
- ATOMIC (but O, M are ruled out)

""ACTIN"" seems like the best choice here - it uses common letters and covers four new letters (C, I, N, T) while keeping A in place.

But let me double-check:
- A is confirmed first letter
- C, I, N, T are not yet ruled out
- ACTIN is a valid English word

So ACTIN it is.

Guess 3: ACTIN -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) C(x) T(x) I(-) N(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on ACTIN:
- A is still correct in position 1 (✓)
- C and T are NOT in the word (x)
- I is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so I must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so N must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5

Letters now known to be absent: R, O, S, E, L, B, U, M, C, T  
Letters known to be present: A (fixed at position 1), I, N

We need a 5-letter word starting with A, containing both I and N, and avoiding all the ruled-out letters. We also know I is NOT in position 4 (since it was marked wrong-position in ACTIN), and N is NOT in position 5 (since it was marked wrong-position in ACTIN).

Remaining possible letters (excluding the ruled-out set): A, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
But we already know A, I, N are in the word; the other two letters must come from the remaining set.

Let’s look for real English words that fit:
- A _ I N _ : “ABIN” is 4 letters; no 5-letter word
- A _ _ I N : “APHIN” (not a word), “APIN” (not a word)
- A _ N I _ : “ADNIA” (not a word), “AFINA” (not a word)
- A N _ I _ : “ANDIA” (not a word), “ANGEL” (but L is ruled out)
- A _ _ N I : “APAND” (not a word), “ASHNI” (not a word)
- A _ I N _ : “ACIDY” (but C, D, Y are still possible? Wait, D is still possible, but Y is still possible)

Actually, “ACIDY” uses C, D, Y – but C is ruled out (x in ACTIN), so no.

Another approach: list all 5-letter words starting with A, containing I and N, and avoid C, T, L, B, O, S, E, R, U, M.

Possible candidates:
- A F I N _ : “AFIN_” – nothing
- A D I N _ : “ADIN_” – “ADINA” (not a word), “ADIND” (not a word)
- A N I _ _ : “ANIXY” (no), “ANVIL” (L is out)
- A _ N I _ : “ASHNI” (not a word), “ASPIC” (C, P, I – but C is out)
- A _ I N _ : “ABIN_” – nothing (B is out), “ACIDY” – C is out
- A F I N _ : “AFIN_” – nothing

Wait, let me think differently: the word must be A _ _ _ _, with I and N somewhere in positions 2-5, and no ruled-out letters.

Possible words:
- A F I N D – but D is still possible (not ruled out), and “AFIND” is not a word
- A N I D A – but A is already in position 1, and “ANIDA” is not a word
- A N I X Y – “ANIXY” is not a word
- A N I M A – “ANIM A” is not a word
- A N I D A – same as above
- A N I S H – S is out
- A N I K E – E is out
- A N I T A – T is out
- A N I D A – not a word

Hmm, let me check “ANVIL” – but L is out.

Another candidate: “APHID” – but D is possible, and it’s a word. Let me check:
- A P H I D
- Letters: A (✓), P, H, I, D
- P, H, D are still possible (not ruled out)
- I is in the word (must be in positions 2-5)
- N is in the word (must be in positions 2-5)

But we have no info yet that N is in the word – the feedback on ACTIN only said N is in the word but wrong position (position 5), so N could be in 2,3,4.

“APHID” has N in position 4, which is allowed. And I is in position 3, also allowed.

So “APHID” seems valid:
- A (✓) first
- P, H, D are new letters not yet tested
- I is in the word (position 3)
- N is in the word (position 4)

Let me verify:
- A P H I D
- No C, T, L, B, O, S, E, R, U, M
- Starts with A, has I and N
- I is not in position 4 (it’s in 3) – ok
- N is not in position 5 (it’s in 4) – ok

This seems like the best next guess.

- First letter is A (✓ in every guess).
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, L, B, U, M, C, T, P, H, D.
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: I and N.

Remaining alphabet letters that have never been guessed (and are not ruled out):
A (fixed first), C, D, F, G, I, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word starting with A, containing both I and N, and using only the still-allowed letters.

Possible positions for I and N:
- They must appear somewhere in positions 2–5.
- They are NOT allowed in positions 4 or 5 (because in ACTIN they were marked wrong-position at 4, and in APHID they were marked wrong-position at 4 again – but wait, APHID had I at 4 and N at 5, so I is NOT allowed at 4, but N is NOT allowed at 5. So possible positions:
  – I can be 2 or 3 or 5
  – N can be 2, 3, or 4

Let’s list real 5-letter words starting with A, containing I and N, and avoiding all ruled-out letters:

- A F I N _ – nothing
- A N I _ _ – “ANVIL” (L out), “ANXIE” (not a word), “ANKLE” (K, L, E out), “ANGEL” (L, E out), “ANGIN” (not a word)
- A _ I N _ – “AFIN_” – nothing
- A _ N I _ – “ADINA” (not a word), “AFINA” (not a word), “AGING” (G, I, N, G – but G is allowed), “ALING” (L out), “AMING” (M out)
- A N _ _ I – “ANXIE” (not a word), “ANKIE” (not a word)
- A _ N _ I – “AFNIA” (not a word), “AGNIA” (not a word), “AVNIA” (not a word)
- A _ _ N I – “AFNIA” (not a word), “AGNIA” (not a word), “AVNIA” (not a word)

Looking more carefully, the only common English word that fits is “ANGEL”, but it has E and L which are ruled out.

Another candidate: “ANGIN” – not a word.

Wait, let me check “AGING”:
- A G I N G
- Letters: A (✓), G, I, N, G
- G is still allowed (never tested)
- I is in the word (position 3)
- N is in the word (position 4)
- No ruled-out letters

“AGING” is a valid 5-letter word, fits all constraints.

Let me verify:
- A(✓) first
- G, I, N, G – G is still allowed
- I is in the word (position 3) – ok
- N is in the word (position 4) – ok
- No letters from the ruled-out set appear.

So “AGING” is the best next guess.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants.

This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.\n\nAnother good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers more of the common vowels and consonants.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A is in the correct first position (✓)\n- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all (x)\n\nSo the secret word starts with A and does not contain R, O, S, or E.\n\nNext, I want to use a word that starts with A and avoids those five letters.

Ruled-out letters so far: R, O, S, E, L, B, U, M, C, T, P, H, D, G (for position 2), etc.

Looking again: the only possible letter for position 2 is ""F"" to form ""AFING"" – but that's not a word.

Wait, let me check ""ANING"" – but that's not a word.

This is tricky. The only possible word seems to be ""AGING"" with G in position 5, but we already had G in position 5 confirmed as G(✓), so position 2 G would have been marked as wrong-position if G was indeed in the word (since G is in the word but wrong-position in AGING means G must be elsewhere).

But looking back: in AGING, G was in position 2 and marked (-), meaning G is in the word but not in position 2. Therefore, G must be in position 3 or 4, but positions 3 and 4 are already taken by I and N respectively. This implies G must be in position 2, but we just had G in position 2 marked (-), so G cannot be in position 2. This seems impossible.

Wait, let me re-examine the feedback: in AGING:
- G(-) means G is in the word but not in position 2
- Position 2 is the only unknown
- Since I is in position 3 and N is in position 4, G must be in position 2, but that contradicts G(-) in AGING.

This suggests an inconsistency, but likely I misread. Let me rephrase:

In AGING:
- G(-) means G is in the word but NOT in position 2
- So G must be in position 3 or 4
- But positions 3 and 4 are already taken by I and N
- Therefore, G must be in position 2, but this contradicts G(-) in AGING.

This indicates an error in my reasoning. Let me re-examine:

From AGING feedback:
- A(✓) position 1
- G(-) – G is in the word but NOT in position 2
- I(✓) position 3
- N(✓) position 4

Thus the word is A _ I N G with G in position 5 confirmed, and G must be in position 2 (since G is in the word but not in position 2 – but position 2 is the only remaining slot! This implies no valid word, but that can't be right.

Realizing the only possible word is ""AGING"" with G in position 5, and G must be in position 2 (since position 5 is taken by G and we have no other G elsewhere). But APHID had G not tested, and we haven't tested G in any other position. 

Given the constraints, the only valid word is ""AGING"" with G in position 5, and position 2 being a letter not yet ruled out (but all letters have been ruled out). This suggests the word must be ""AGING"" with G in position 5, and position 2 being a letter not yet used.

But looking back, the only valid English word matching A _ I N G is ""AGING"". Let me check if there are others: ""AING_"" – no. 

Therefore, the word must be ""AGING"".
