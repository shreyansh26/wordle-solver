For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- A, E (common vowels)
- R, S (common consonants)
- O (another common vowel)

This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the right or wrong positions, which will help narrow down the possibilities for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- E is in the correct position (position 5).
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and contains none of A, R, O, S.  
That means we need a 5-letter word ending in E, with no A, R, O, S.  
Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, etc.  
Good vowels left to try: I, U (since A and O are out).

A balanced second guess might use T, I, N, L, or C.  
A common word that fits: ""TINLE"" is not valid, but ""UNTIE"" is 5 letters ending in E, uses U, N, T, I, E.  
However, ""UNTIE"" has I and U, which are good to test.  
Another option: ""ELITE"" uses L, I, T, E, but E is already known at position 5.  
""INLET"" uses I, N, L, E, T – all new letters, ends in E.  

Let's go with ""INLET"" because it tests I, N, L, E, T, none of which have been ruled out yet.

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)

3. CHIDE → C(x) H(x) I(-) D(x) E(✓)  
   – C, H, D are out.  
   – I is in the word but NOT in position 3.

So we know:
- Word ends in E (position 5).  
- Word contains I, but I can’t be in positions 1 or 3.  
- Word doesn’t contain A, R, O, S, N, L, T, C, H, D.

Available letters (besides E at position 5):  
Vowels: I, U

I must appear in position 2 or 4.  
Let’s look for 5-letter words ending in E with I in position 2 or 4 and no forbidden consonants.

Possible patterns:  
- _ I _ _ E (I in position 2)  
- _ _ _ I E (I in position 4)  

Forbidden consonants are broad; let’s pick B, F, G, K, M, P, V, W, Y.

Good candidates:  
- “MIDGE” – but D and G are still allowed? D is out (from CHIDE feedback), G is still in.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- A, E (common vowels)
- R, S (common consonants)
- O (another common vowel)

This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the right or wrong positions, which will help narrow down the possibilities for subsequent guesses.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- E is in the correct position (position 5).
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and contains none of A, R, O, S.  
That means we need a 5-letter word ending in E, with no A, R, O, S.  
Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, etc.  
Good vowels left to try: I, U (since A and O are out).

A balanced second guess might use T, I, N, L, or C.  
A common word that fits: ""TINLE"" is not valid, but ""UNTIE"" is 5 letters ending in E, uses U, N, T, I, E.  
However, ""UNTIE"" has I and U, which are good to test.  
Another option: ""ELITE"" uses L, I, T, E, but E is already known at position 5.  
""INLET"" uses I, N, L, E, T – all new letters, ends in E.  

Let's go with ""INLET"" because it tests I, N, L, E, T, none of which have been ruled out yet.

Guess 2: INLET -> FEEDBACK: I(-) N(x) L(x) E(-) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)  
   – E is fixed in position 5.  
   – A, R, O, S are completely out.

2. INLET → I(-) N(x) L(x) E(-) T(x)  
   – I is in the word but not in position 1.  
   – N, L, T are not in the word at all.  
   – E is in the word but not in position 4 (we already know it must be in position 5).

So far we know:
- Word ends in E (position 5).  
- Word contains I, but I is NOT in position 1.  
- Word does NOT contain A, R, O, S, N, L, T.

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out)

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, with I somewhere in positions 2-4, and none of the forbidden letters.  
Good candidates:  
- “CHIDE” – but D is okay, C, H, I, D, E.  
- “MIDGE” – M, I, D, G, E.  
- “WIDGE” – W, I, D, G, E.  
- “GIMLET” – but L is out.

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)  
   – E is fixed in position 5.  
   – A, R, O, S are out.

2. INLET → I(-) N(x) L(x) E(-) T(x)  
   – I is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
   – N, L, T are out.

3. CHIDE → C(x) H(x) I(-) D(x) E(✓)  
   – C, H, D are out.  
   – I is in the word but NOT in position 3.

4. PIQUE → P(x) I(✓) Q(x) U(x) E(✓)  
   – I is now confirmed in position 2.  
   – P, Q, U are out.

Current knowledge:
- Word pattern: _ I _ _ E  
- Letters used so far that are out: A, R, O, S, N, L, T, C, H, D, P, Q, U  
- Remaining consonants: B, F, G, J, K, M, V, W, X, Y, Z  
- Remaining vowels: I (already in position 2), E (position 5) – no other vowels needed.

We need three more letters for positions 1, 3, 4 that are not yet ruled out.  
Good candidates: B, F, G, K, M, V, W, Y.

Possible words:  
- B I _ _ E  
- F I _ _ E  
- G I _ _ E  
- K I _ _ E  
- M I _ _ E  
- V I _ _ E  
- W I _ _ E  
- Y I _ _ E  

Looking for valid 5-letter words:  
- “BINGE” – N is out.  
- “FINGE” – N is out.  
- “GIMLE” – L is out.  
- “KIMME” – not valid.  
- “MIDGE” – D is out.  
- “WIMPY” – ends in Y.  
- “VIXEN” – N is out.  
- “FUGIE” – not valid.  
- “BUDGE” – D is out.  
- “WIPER” – R is out.  

Actually, let’s list valid words fitting _ I _ _ E with remaining letters:

Possible letters for positions 1,3,4: B, F, G, J, K, M, V, W, X, Y, Z (and I, E are already used).

Valid words:  
- “BINGE” – N out.

- “FUGIE” – not valid.  

Wait, let’s check “WIMPY” – but it ends in Y, not E.  

Another valid word: “FUGIE” – no.  

Let’s try “GIMEL” – L is out.  

Next: “MIDGE” – D is out.  

Another systematic approach: list all 5-letter words ending in E with I in position 2, avoiding all banned letters.

Valid words left:  
- “BINGE” – N out.  
- “FINGE” – N out.  
- “WIMPY” – ends in Y.  
- “FUGIE” – not valid.  
- “GIMEL” – L out.  
- “KIMME” – not valid.  

Actually, let’s check dictionary for valid words:  
“BINGE” – not valid.  
“FINGE” – not valid.  
“WIMPY” – not valid.  

Let me re-examine allowed letters.  

Allowed letters for positions 1,3,4: B, F, G, J, K, M, V, W, X, Y, Z (and I, E are used).

Valid words:  
- “BINGE” – N out.  
- “FINGE” – N out.  
- “WIMPY” – ends in Y.  

Wait, let’s try “WIMPY” – but it’s not a valid word ending in E.  

Another valid word: “FUGIE” – no.  

Let me list all possible combinations:

For position 1: B, F, G, J, K, M, V, W, X, Y, Z  
For position 3: same list  
For position 4: same list  

But we have only 3 letters to fill: _ I _ _ E.

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- A, E (common vowels)
- R, S (common consonants)
- O (another common vowel)

This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the right or wrong positions, which will help narrow down the possibilities for subsequent guesses.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- E is in the correct position (position 5).
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and contains none of A, R, O, S.  
That means we need a 5-letter word ending in E, with no A, R, O, S.  
Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, etc.  
Good vowels left to try: I, U (since A and O are out).

A balanced second guess might use T, I, N, L, or C.  
A common word that fits: ""TINLE"" is not valid, but ""UNTIE"" is 5 letters ending in E, uses U, N, T, I, E.  
However, ""UNTIE"" has I and U, which are good to test.  
Another option: ""ELITE"" uses L, I, T, E, but E is already known at position 5.  
""INLET"" uses I, N, L, E, T – all new letters, ends in E.  

Let's go with ""INLET"" because it tests I, N, L, E, T, none of which have been ruled out yet.

<guess>INLET</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: INLET -> FEEDBACK: I(-) N(x) L(x) E(-) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)  
   – E is fixed in position 5.  
   – A, R, O, S are completely out.

2. INLET → I(-) N(x) L(x) E(-) T(x)  
   – I is in the word but not in position 1.  
   – N, L, T are not in the word at all.  
   – E is in the word but not in position 4 (we already know it must be in position 5).

So far we know:
- Word ends in E (position 5).  
- Word contains I, but I is NOT in position 1.  
- Word does NOT contain A, R, O, S, N, L, T.

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out)

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, with I somewhere in positions 2-4, and none of the forbidden letters.  
Good candidates:  
- “CHIDE” – but D is okay, C, H, I, D, E.  
- “MIDGE” – M, I, D, G, E.  
- “WIDGE” – W, I, D, G, E.  
- “GIMLET” – but L is out.  
- “PIVET” – T is out.  

Let’s pick “CHIDE” because C, H, I, D are all still possible, and it satisfies all constraints.

<guess>CHIDE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: INLET -> FEEDBACK: I(-) N(x) L(x) E(-) T(x)
Guess 3: CHIDE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) I(-) D(x) E(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)  
   – E is locked in position 5.  
   – A, R, O, S are out.

2. INLET → I(-) N(x) L(x) E(-) T(x)  
   – I is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
   – N, L, T are out.

3. CHIDE → C(x) H(x) I(-) D(x) E(✓)  
   – C, H, D are out.  
   – I is in the word but NOT in position 3.

So we know:
- Word ends in E (position 5).  
- Word contains I, but I can’t be in positions 1 or 3.  
- Word doesn’t contain A, R, O, S, N, L, T, C, H, D.

Available letters (besides E at position 5):  
Vowels: I, U  
Consonants: B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

I must appear in position 2 or 4.  
Let’s look for 5-letter words ending in E with I in position 2 or 4 and no forbidden consonants.

Possible patterns:  
- _ I _ _ E (I in position 2)  
- _ _ _ I E (I in position 4)  

Forbidden consonants are broad; let’s pick B, F, G, K, M, P, V, W, Y.

Good candidates:  
- “MIDGE” – but D and G are still allowed? D is out (from CHIDE feedback), G is still in.  
- “WIMPE” – not a valid word.  
- “GIMPE” – not valid.  
- “PIVOT” – O and T are out.  
- “BINKY” – N is out.  
- “FUMIE” – not a word.  
- “WIPER” – R is out.  
- “VIXEN” – N is out.  
- “PIVOT” – O and T are out.  
- “BUDGE” – D is out.  
- “FUGUE” – U is allowed, but is it common?  
- “GUMIE” – not a word.  
- “MIDGE” – D is out.  
- “WIMPY” – M, P, Y are allowed, I in position 2.  
- “BUMPY” – not ending in E.  
- “FUMPY” – not valid.  

A valid word with I in position 4:  
- “GUMIE” – no.  
- “FUGIE” – no.  

Wait, let’s systematically list 5-letter words ending in E with I in position 2 or 4 and no forbidden consonants.

Valid words:  
- “MIDGE” – D is out.  
- “WIMPE” – not valid.  
- “FUGUE” – valid, but U is allowed.  
- “PIQUE” – Q is allowed, but U is allowed.  
- “BUILT” – ends in T, out.  
- “GUILT” – ends in T, out.  
- “FUMIE” – not a word.  
- “WIPER” – R out.  
- “VIXEN” – N out.  

Actually, let’s try “FUGUE” – it has:  
F (allowed), U (allowed), G (allowed), E (position 5), I (position 4).  
No forbidden letters, I in position 4.  

But is “FUGUE” a common word? It’s a musical term, but less common.  

Another valid word: “WIMPY” – but ends in Y, not E.  

Let’s pick “MIDGE” – but D is out.  

Next: “GIMEL” – ends in L, out.  

Another approach: list 5-letter words ending in E with I in position 2 or 4, no forbidden consonants.

Valid words:  
- “FUGIE” – no.  
- “PIQUE” – Q is allowed, U is allowed, I is in position 4.  
  Letters: P, I, Q, U, E – none are forbidden, I is in position 4.  

“PIQUE” is a valid word, fits all constraints.

Let’s go with PIQUE.

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)  
   – E is fixed in position 5.  
   – A, R, O, S are out.

2. INLET → I(-) N(x) L(x) E(-) T(x)  
   – I is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
   – N, L, T are out.

3. CHIDE → C(x) H(x) I(-) D(x) E(✓)  
   – C, H, D are out.  
   – I is in the word but NOT in position 3.

4. PIQUE → P(x) I(✓) Q(x) U(x) E(✓)  
   – I is now confirmed in position 2.  
   – P, Q, U are out.

So the pattern is: _ I _ _ E  
Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, S, N, L, T, C, H, D, P, Q, U.

Available letters: B, F, G, J, K, M, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus I and E already placed).

We need 5-letter words matching _ I _ _ E with no forbidden letters.

Possible words:  
- B I _ _ E → “BIGIE” (not valid), “BILGE” (L out), “BINGE” (N out)  
- F I _ _ E → “FIFTE” (invalid), “FILME” (L, M ok but L out)

- Other: “FUGIE” (invalid), “JIFFE” (invalid), “KITHE” (invalid)  

Valid remaining word: “MIDGE” – but D is out.  
“WIMPY” – ends in Y.
