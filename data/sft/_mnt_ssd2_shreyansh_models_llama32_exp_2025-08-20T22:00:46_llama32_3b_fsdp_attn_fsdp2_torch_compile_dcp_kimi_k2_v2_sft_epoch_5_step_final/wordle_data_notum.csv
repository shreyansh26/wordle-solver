For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, E are NOT in the word (x).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains T somewhere (but not in position 4).
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses T (but not in position 4).
2. Avoids S, L, A, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to keep narrowing down possibilities.

Good consonants left to try: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, etc.
Good vowels left to try: I, O, U.

A strong next guess would be ""TRICK"" because:
- T is used in position 1 (different from position 4 in SLATE).
- Uses I and C (common letters) and K.
- Avoids all excluded letters (S, L, A, E).

Another option could be ""TROOP"" but ""TRICK"" seems slightly better for testing C and K.

Let’s summarize what we now know after three guesses.

Letters ruled out completely (x in any position):
S, L, A, E, R, I, C, K

Letters that are in the word but whose positions are still unknown (-):
- T: not in positions 1, 4, 5 (from SLATE and MOUNT feedback)
- U: not in position 3 (from MOUNT feedback)
- N: not in position 4 (from MOUNT feedback)

Correct positions discovered:
- O is in position 2 (✓ from MOUNT)

So the word looks like: _ O _ _ _

Letters still possible (not yet ruled out):
Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels: none left (A, E, I already out; O is fixed in position 2)

Thus the word is _ O _ _ _ with T, U, N still to place (and they must go in positions they haven’t occupied yet).

From MOUNT feedback:
- T was in position 5 → wrong place
- U was in position 3 → wrong place
- N was in position 4 → wrong place

So:
- T can be in positions 2 or 3
- U can be in positions 1, 4, 5
- N can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (but 2 is O), so positions 1, 3, 5

We need a word that:
- Has O in position 2
- Uses T, U, N in allowed positions
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out

Let’s try to place T, U, N:

Option 1:
- T in 2: but then U and N must fit in 1,3,5 with constraints
  - U can’t be in 3 (already was in 3 in MOUNT, so invalid)
  - N can’t be in 4 (already was in 4 in MOUNT, so invalid)

Option 2:
- T in 3:
  - U can be in 1,4,5
  - N can be in 1,5 (since 2,3 are taken by O and T)

Let’s try:
- T in 3
- U in 1
- N in 5
  Word: U O T _ N → but we need 5 letters: U O T _ N → U O T A N? But A is out. U O T I N? I is out. U O T Y N? Y is possible. So U O T Y N is a valid word (though rare). But let’s check better options.

Better: T in 3, U in 4:
- _ O T U _
- Need N in 1 or 5
  - N O T U _ → N is in 1, O in 2, T in 3, U in 4 → N O T U _ needs a 5th letter. N O T U N? But N is already used. N O T U Y? Not a word. N O T U X? Not a word. N O T U Z? Not a word.

  Actually: N O T U X is not valid. Let’s try N in 1, T in 3, U in 5:
  N O T _ U → need a consonant in 4. N O T D U? Not valid. N O T F U? Not valid. N O T G U? Not valid. N O T H U? Not valid. N O T M U? Not valid. N O T P U? Not valid. N O T V U? Not valid. N O T W U? Not valid. N O T Y U? Not valid. N O T Z U? Not valid.

  Hmm, maybe U in 1, T in 3, N in 5:
  U O T _ N → U O T A N – A is out. U O T I N – I is out. U O T Y N – as above, Y is possible but rare word.

  Let’s try U in 5, T in 3, N in 1:
  N O T _ U → N O T A U – A out. N O T I U – I out. N O T Y U – Y is possible and forms N O T Y U, which is a valid word (though slang).

  Another option: T in 3, U in 1, N in 5:
  U O T _ N → U O T A N – invalid. U O T I N – invalid. U O T Y N – valid word.

  Between N O T Y U and U O T Y N, both are rare. Let’s try N in 5, T in 3, U in 1:
  U O T _ N → U O T A N – invalid. U O T I N – invalid. U O T Y N – valid.

  Actually, U O T Y N is a valid word (slang for “you’re not funny”).

  But let’s pick a more standard word: T in 3, U in 4, N in 1:
  N O T U _ → N O T U N – invalid. N O T U M – M is possible. N O T U M is a valid word (though rare).

  The best standard word seems to be N O T U M (not perfect), or N O T Y U. Let’s go with N O T Y U as it’s more common.

  Wait, N O T Y U has O in 2? No, O is fixed in 2, so N O T Y U has O in 2? No, that’s not right.

  Let me re-express:
  Word pattern: _ O _ _ _
  We have T, U, N to place in positions 1,3,4,5 with constraints:
  - T cannot be in 1,4,5 → must be in 2 or 3
  - U cannot be in 3 → can be 1,4,5
  - N cannot be in 4 → can be 1,3,5

  Let’s list possible positions for T, U, N:

  Case 1: T in 2
    Then word: _ O T _ _
    U and N must fit in 1,4,5 with:
    - U not in 3 (already)
    - N not in 4
    So:
    - U can be 1,4,5
    - N can be 1,5 (since 3 is T)
    Possible combinations:
    - U in 1, N in 5 → U O T _ N → need letter in 4. U O T A N – A out. U O T I N – I out. U O T Y N – valid word.
    - U in 4, N in 1 → N O T U _ → N O T U N – invalid. N O T U M – valid (as in N O T U M bursary).
    - U in 5, N in 1 → N O T _ U → N O T A U – invalid. N O T I U – invalid. N O T Y U – valid.

  Case 2: T in 3
    Then word: _ O T _ _
    U and N must fit in 1,4,5 with:
    - U not in 3 (already)
    - N not in 4
    So:
    - U can be 1,4,5
    - N can be 1,5
    Possible combinations:
    - U in 1, N in 5 → U O T _ N → U O T A N – invalid. U O T I N – invalid. U O T Y N – valid word.
    - U in 4, N in 1 → N O T U _ → N O T U N – invalid. N O T U M – valid.
    - U in 5, N in 1 → N O T _ U → N O T A U – invalid. N O T I U – invalid. N O T Y U – valid.

  The most common valid word here is N O T Y U (slang). Let’s pick the standard word N O T U M (bursary) for clarity.

  So I will guess NOTUM.

  Wait, NOTUM is 5 letters: N O T U M. Let me verify:
  - N: position 1 – allowed (was in 4 in MOUNT, now 1)
  - O: position 2 – correct ✓
  - T: position 3 – allowed (was in 1,4,5; 3 is new)
  - U: position 4 – allowed (was in 3; 4 is new)
  - M: position 5 – allowed (was in 1; 5 is new)

  NOTUM is valid.

  Alternative: U O T Y N (slang), but NOTUM is better.

  Final check: NOTUM uses only allowed letters and positions.

  So I will guess NOTUM.
