### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: S, E, T, I
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, N

Also, the positions we can rule out for each of those four letters:
- S: cannot be in positions 1 or 4
- E: cannot be in positions 3 or 5
- T: cannot be in position 2
- I: cannot be in position 4

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S, E, T, I exactly once each (since STEIN already shows T and I in wrong positions, and we have no info of duplicates)
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, N
- S is in positions 2, 3, or 5
- E is in positions 1, 2, or 4
- T is in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5
- I is in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints. A quick mental scan:

- Position 1 candidates: E, S, T, I
- Position 2 candidates: T, I, S, E, I
- Position 3 candidates: T, I, E, S, I
- Position 4 candidates: E, S, T, I

- ""E"" + ""T"" + ""I"" + ""S"" + ? : ETIS? (not a word)
- ""S"" + ""E"" + ""T"" + ""I"" + ? : SEIT? (not a word)
- ""I"" + ""S"" + ""E"" + ""T"" + ? : ISLET (not a word)
- ""T"" + ""I"" + ""S"" + ""E"" + ? : TISLE (not a word)

Hmm, none of these are valid. Let me rethink.

We need a real 5-letter word that uses S, E, T, I plus one more letter (which must be from the remaining unused letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Looking at common letters left: L, C, D, H, M, U, Y, etc.

Try ""LITSE"" – but that’s not a word.

Try ""LITES"" – again not a word.

Try ""CISTE"" – not a word.

Try ""MISTE"" – not a word.

Try ""DITES"" – not a word.

Wait, let’s look for actual words:

- ""STEIN"" already used.
- ""TISUE"" – valid word (tissue).
   - Contains T, I, S, U, E.
   - Check positions:
     - T in 1: allowed (was in 2 before, now 1)

     - S in 3: allowed (was in 1 and 4 before, now 3)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

- S is not in position 4 (was in position 4 in AROSE).
- E is not in position 5 (was in position 5 in AROSE).

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both S and E.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, or O.
3. S is not in position 4.
4. E is not in position 5.

Looking at common letters that remain: T, I, N, L, U, C, Y, D, H, M, etc.

A good candidate would be ""STEIN"" - it has S and E, and uses common consonants T, I, N. 
Check positions:
- S is in position 1 (not 4) - valid.
- E is in position 3 (not 5) - valid.
- No A, R, or O - valid.

Other options like ""SEWER"" or ""STEPS"" could also work, but ""STEIN"" uses unique letters that haven't been ruled out yet.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STEIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) E(-) I(-) N(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - Letters not in the word: A, R, O
   - Letters in the word but wrong position: S (not pos 4), E (not pos 5)

2. STEIN → S(-) T(-) E(-) I(-) N(x)
   - Additional letters not in the word: N
   - Letters in the word but wrong position: S (not pos 1), T (not pos 2), E (not pos 3), I (not pos 4)

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: S, E, T, I
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, N

Also, the positions we can rule out for each of those four letters:
- S: cannot be in positions 1 or 4
- E: cannot be in positions 3 or 5
- T: cannot be in position 2
- I: cannot be in position 4

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S, E, T, I exactly once each (since STEIN already shows T and I in wrong positions, and we have no info of duplicates)
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, N
- S is in positions 2, 3, or 5
- E is in positions 1, 2, or 4
- T is in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5
- I is in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints. A quick mental scan:

- Position 1 candidates: E, S, T, I
- Position 2 candidates: T, I, S, E, I
- Position 3 candidates: T, I, E, S, I
- Position 4 candidates: E, S, T, I
- Position 5 candidates: S, I, T, E, I

Trying to combine them into valid words:

- ""T"" + ""E"" + ""S"" + ""I"" + ? : TEIS? (not a word)
- ""E"" + ""T"" + ""I"" + ""S"" + ? : ETIS? (not a word)
- ""S"" + ""E"" + ""T"" + ""I"" + ? : SEIT? (not a word)
- ""I"" + ""S"" + ""E"" + ""T"" + ? : ISLET (not a word)
- ""T"" + ""I"" + ""S"" + ""E"" + ? : TISLE (not a word)

Hmm, none of these are valid. Let me rethink.

We need a real 5-letter word that uses S, E, T, I plus one more letter (which must be from the remaining unused letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Looking at common letters left: L, C, D, H, M, U, Y, etc.

Try ""LITSE"" – but that’s not a word.

Try ""LITES"" – again not a word.

Try ""CISTE"" – not a word.

Try ""MISTE"" – not a word.

Try ""DITES"" – not a word.

Wait, let’s look for actual words:

- ""STEIN"" already used.
- ""TISUE"" – valid word (tissue).
   - Contains T, I, S, U, E.
   - Check positions:
     - T in 1: allowed (was in 2 before, now 1)
     - I in 2: allowed (was in 4 before, now 2)
     - S in 3: allowed (was in 1 and 4 before, now 3)
     - E in 4: allowed (was in 3 and 5 before, now 4)
     - U is new, allowed
   - No A, R, O, N.

This fits all constraints.

Another candidate could be ""TISUE"" or ""TISIC"" (but TISIC isn’t a valid word), so ""TISUE"" is the best choice.

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

Letters that are **in** the word and their positional constraints  
- T is correct in position 1 (✓)  
- I is in the word but **not** in position 2 (-)  
- S is in the word but **not** in position 3 (-)  
- E is in the word but **not** in position 5 (-)  

Letters **not** in the word  
A, R, O, N, U  

So the secret word looks like: T _ _ _ _ and must contain I, S, E exactly once each, with the additional constraints:

- S ≠ position 3  
- E ≠ position 5  
- I ≠ position 2  

We still need one more letter (from the remaining unused: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Let’s map possible positions:

Position 1: T (fixed)  
Position 2: cannot be I or any of S, E, T (T is already fixed)  
Position 3: cannot be S or any of I, E, T (T is fixed)  
Position 4: free except for the “not O, N, U” rule  
Position 5: cannot be E or any of I, S, T (T is fixed)

So:

- If position 2 = I, then 4 and 5 must hold S and E (in valid positions)  
- If position 2 = S, then 4 and 5 must hold I and E (in valid positions)  
- If position 2 = E, then 4 and 5 must hold I and S (in valid positions)  

Valid positions so far:

S: allowed in 2, 4, 5 (but not 1,3,4,5) – wait, S was already ruled out of 1 (AROSE) and 3 (TISUE), so S ∈ {2,4,5}  
E: allowed in 1,2,4 (not 3,5) – so E ∈ {1,2,4}  
I: allowed in 1,3,5 (not 2,4) – so I ∈ {1,3,5}

Let’s list valid placements:

Case 1: position 2 = I  
   T I _ _ _  
   Then 4 and 5 must hold S and E in some order.  
   - 4S,5E → T I _ 4S 5E – but E is banned from 5 → fail  
   - 4E,5S → T I _ 4E 5S – E is allowed in 4, S in 5 – this works!  
   So candidate: T I _ 4E 5S → “TI _ PE S” – need a letter for position 3 that is unused and valid.  
   Remaining common consonants: L, C, D, H, M, etc.  
   “TILPE” is not a word. “TIMES” is a word!  

Case 2: position 2 = S  
   T S _ _ _  
   Then 4 and 5 must hold I and E in some order.  
   - 4I,5E → T S _ 4I 5E – E banned from 5 → fail  
   - 4E,5I → T S _ 4E 5I – E in 4, I in 5 – this works!  
   So candidate: T S _ 4E 5I → “TS _ E I S” – need a letter for position 3.  
   “TSLIE” is not a word. “TSI” is only 3 letters.  
   Actually, “TS” + a letter + “E I S” – no common word.

Case 3: position 2 = E  
   T E _ _ _  
   Then 4 and 5 must hold I and S in some order.  
   - 4S,5I → T E _ 4S 5I – E in 2 is allowed, I in 5 is allowed, S in 4 is allowed – this works!  
   So candidate: T E _ 4S 5I → “TE _ S I” – need a letter for position 3.  
   “TELIS” is not a word. “TEMPI” is invalid.  
   “TESLA” has A (invalid).  
   “TESSY” – has S twice (possible but unlikely).

“TIMES” is the only valid English word that fits all constraints so far.

Let’s verify:  
- T in 1: ✓  
- I in 3: allowed (was in 2 before, now 3)  
- M is new and allowed  
- E in 4: allowed (was in 3,5 before, now 4)  
- S in 5: allowed (was in 1,4 before, now 5)  

All constraints satisfied.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word contains S and E, but:
- S is not in position 4 (was in position 4 in AROSE).
- E is not in position 5 (was in position 5 in AROSE).

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both S and E.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, or O.
3. S is not in position 4.
4. E is not in position 5.

Looking at common letters that remain: T, I, N, L, U, C, Y, D, H, M, etc.

A good candidate would be ""STEIN"" - it has S and E, and uses common consonants T, I, N. 
Check positions:
- S is in position 1 (not 4) - valid.
- E is in position 3 (not 5) - valid.
- No A, R, or O - valid.

Other options like ""SEWER"" or ""STEPS"" could also work, but ""STEIN"" uses unique letters that haven't been ruled out yet.

Guess 2: STEIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) E(-) I(-) N(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - Letters not in the word: A, R, O
   - Letters in the word but wrong position: S (not pos 4), E (not pos 5)

2. STEIN → S(-) T(-) E(-) I(-) N(x)
   - Additional letters not in the word: N
   - Letters in the word but wrong position: S (not pos 1), T (not pos 2), E (not pos 3), I (not pos 4)

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: S, E, T, I
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, N

Also, the positions we can rule out for each of those four letters:
- S: cannot be in positions 1 or 4
- E: cannot be in positions 3 or 5
- T: cannot be in position 2
- I: cannot be in position 4

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S, E, T, I exactly once each (since STEIN already shows T and I in wrong positions, and we have no info of duplicates)
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, N
- S is in positions 2, 3, or 5
- E is in positions 1, 2, or 4
- T is in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5
- I is in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints. A quick mental scan:

- Position 1 candidates: E, S, T, I
- Position 2 candidates: T, I, S, E, I
- Position 3 candidates: T, I, E, S, I
- Position 4 candidates: E, S, T, I
- Position 5 candidates: S, I, T, E, I

Trying to combine them into valid words:

- ""T"" + ""E"" + ""S"" + ""I"" + ? : TEIS? (not a word)
- ""E"" + ""T"" + ""I"" + ""S"" + ? : ETIS? (not a word)
- ""S"" + ""E"" + ""T"" + ""I"" + ? : SEIT? (not a word)
- ""I"" + ""S"" + ""E"" + ""T"" + ? : ISLET (not a word)
- ""T"" + ""I"" + ""S"" + ""E"" + ? : TISLE (not a word)

Hmm, none of these are valid. Let me rethink.

We need a real 5-letter word that uses S, E, T, I plus one more letter (which must be from the remaining unused letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Looking at common letters left: L, C, D, H, M, U, Y, etc.

Try ""LITSE"" – but that’s not a word.

Try ""LITES"" – again not a word.

Try ""CISTE"" – not a word.

Try ""MISTE"" – not a word.

Try ""DITES"" – not a word.

Wait, let’s look for actual words:

- ""STEIN"" already used.
- ""TISUE"" – valid word (tissue).
   - Contains T, I, S, U, E.
   - Check positions:
     - T in 1: allowed (was in 2 before, now 1)
     - I in 2: allowed (was in 4 before, now 2)
     - S in 3: allowed (was in 1 and 4 before, now 3)
     - E in 4: allowed (was in 3 and 5 before, now 4)
     - U is new, allowed
   - No A, R, O, N.

This fits all constraints.

Another candidate could be ""TISUE"" or ""TISIC"" (but TISIC isn’t a valid word), so ""TISUE"" is the best choice.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STEIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) E(-) I(-) N(x)
Guess 3: TISUE -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) I(-) S(-) U(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

Letters that are **in** the word and their positional constraints  
- T is correct in position 1 (✓)  
- I is in the word but **not** in position 2 (-)  
- S is in the word but **not** in position 3 (-)  
- E is in the word but **not** in position 5 (-)  

Letters **not** in the word  
A, R, O, N, U  

So the secret word looks like: T _ _ _ _ and must contain I, S, E exactly once each, with the additional constraints:

- S ≠ position 3  
- E ≠ position 5  
- I ≠ position 2  

We still need one more letter (from the remaining unused: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Let’s map possible positions:

Position 1: T (fixed)  
Position 2: cannot be I or any of S, E, T (T is already fixed)  
Position 3: cannot be S or any of I, E, T (T is fixed)  
Position 4: free except for the “not O, N, U” rule  
Position 5: cannot be E or any of I, S, T (T is fixed)

So:

- If position 2 = I, then 4 and 5 must hold S and E (in valid positions)  
- If position 2 = S, then 4 and 5 must hold I and E (in valid positions)  
- If position 2 = E, then 4 and 5 must hold I and S (in valid positions)  

Valid positions so far:

S: allowed in 2, 4, 5 (but not 1,3,4,5) – wait, S was already ruled out of 1 (AROSE) and 3 (TISUE), so S ∈ {2,4,5}  
E: allowed in 1,2,4 (not 3,5) – so E ∈ {1,2,4}  
I: allowed in 1,3,5 (not 2,4) – so I ∈ {1,3,5}

Let’s list valid placements:

Case 1: position 2 = I  
   T I _ _ _  
   Then 4 and 5 must hold S and E in some order.  
   - 4S,5E → T I _ 4S 5E – but E is banned from 5 → fail  
   - 4E,5S → T I _ 4E 5S – E is allowed in 4, S in 5 – this works!  
   So candidate: T I _ 4E 5S → “TI _ PE S” – need a letter for position 3 that is unused and valid.  
   Remaining common consonants: L, C, D, H, M, etc.  
   “TILPE” is not a word. “TIMES” is a word!  

Case 2: position 2 = S  
   T S _ _ _  
   Then 4 and 5 must hold I and E in some order.  
   - 4I,5E → T S _ 4I 5E – E banned from 5 → fail  
   - 4E,5I → T S _ 4E 5I – E in 4, I in 5 – this works!  
   So candidate: T S _ 4E 5I → “TS _ E I S” – need a letter for position 3.  
   “TSLIE” is not a word. “TSI” is only 3 letters.  
   Actually, “TS” + a letter + “E I S” – no common word.

Case 3: position 2 = E  
   T E _ _ _  
   Then 4 and 5 must hold I and S in some order.  
   - 4S,5I → T E _ 4S 5I – E in 2 is allowed, I in 5 is allowed, S in 4 is allowed – this works!  
   So candidate: T E _ 4S 5I → “TE _ S I” – need a letter for position 3.  
   “TELIS” is not a word. “TEMPI” is invalid.  
   “TESLA” has A (invalid).  
   “TESSY” – has S twice (possible but unlikely).

“TIMES” is the only valid English word that fits all constraints so far.

Let’s verify:  
- T in 1: ✓  
- I in 3: allowed (was in 2 before, now 3)  
- M is new and allowed  
- E in 4: allowed (was in 3,5 before, now 4)  
- S in 5: allowed (was in 1,4 before, now 5)  

All constraints satisfied.

Let’s update what we now know after four guesses.

Known letters and positions  
- T is fixed in position 1 (✓).  
- S is fixed in position 5 (✓).  

Letters that are in the word but whose positions are still unknown  
- I (was in wrong positions 2, 3, 4) – must be in position 2 or 3 (since 1,4,5 are taken by T and S).  
- E (was in wrong positions 3, 5) – must be in position 2 or 4.  

Letters that are NOT in the word  
A, R, O, N, U, M.

So the pattern so far is:

T _ _ _ S

with the remaining letters {I, E} to be placed in positions 2, 3, 4.

Possible placements of I and E:

1. I in 2, E in 4 → T I _ E S  
   Need a letter for position 3 that is unused and valid.  
   Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z.  
   “T I B E S” → “TIBES” is not a word.  
   “T I C E S” → “TICES” is not a word.  
   “T I D E S” → “TIDES” is a valid word!

2. I in 3, E in 2 → T E I _ S

   “TEI _ S” → “TEILS” is not a word.  
   “TEI _ S” → “TEIPS” (not a word).  

3. I in 4, E in 2 → T E _ I S  
   “TE _ I S” → “TELIS” (not a word).  
   “TEBIS” (not a word).  

4. I in 2, E in 3 → but E is banned from 3 (TIMES feedback).  

Thus the only valid candidate that fits all constraints is “TIDES”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word contains S and E, but:
- S is not in position 4 (was in position 4 in AROSE).
- E is not in position 5 (was in position 5 in AROSE).

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both S and E.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, or O.
3. S is not in position 4.
4. E is not in position 5.

Looking at common letters that remain: T, I, N, L, U, C, Y, D, H, M, etc.

A good candidate would be ""STEIN"" - it has S and E, and uses common consonants T, I, N. 
Check positions:
- S is in position 1 (not 4) - valid.
- E is in position 3 (not 5) - valid.
- No A, R, or O - valid.

Other options like ""SEWER"" or ""STEPS"" could also work, but ""STEIN"" uses unique letters that haven't been ruled out yet.

   - Letters in the word but wrong position: S (not pos 4), E (not pos 5)

2. STEIN → S(-) T(-) E(-) I(-) N(x)
   - Additional letters not in the word: N
   - Letters in the word but wrong position: S (not pos 1), T (not pos 2), E (not pos 3), I (not pos 4)

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: S, E, T, I
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, N

Also, the positions we can rule out for each of those four letters:
- S: cannot be in positions 1 or 4
- E: cannot be in positions 3 or 5
- T: cannot be in position 2
- I: cannot be in position 4

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S, E, T, I exactly once each (since STEIN already shows T and I in wrong positions, and we have no info of duplicates)
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, N
- S is in positions 2, 3, or 5
- E is in positions 1, 2, or 4
- T is in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5
- I is in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints. A quick mental scan:

- Position 1 candidates: E, S, T, I
- Position 2 candidates: T, I, S, E, I
- Position 3 candidates: T, I, E, S, I
- Position 4 candidates: E, S, T, I
- Position 5 candidates: S, I, T, E, I

Trying to combine them into valid words:

- ""T"" + ""E"" + ""S"" + ""I"" + ? : TEIS? (not a word)
- ""E"" + ""T"" + ""I"" + ""S"" + ? : ETIS? (not a word)
- ""S"" + ""E"" + ""T"" + ""I"" + ? : SEIT? (not a word)
- ""I"" + ""S"" + ""E"" + ""T"" + ? : ISLET (not a word)
- ""T"" + ""I"" + ""S"" + ""E"" + ? : TISLE (not a word)

Hmm, none of these are valid. Let me rethink.

We need a real 5-letter word that uses S, E, T, I plus one more letter (which must be from the remaining unused letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Looking at common letters left: L, C, D, H, M, U, Y, etc.

Try ""LITSE"" – but that’s not a word.

Try ""LITES"" – again not a word.

Try ""CISTE"" – not a word.

Try ""MISTE"" – not a word.

Try ""DITES"" – not a word.

Wait, let’s look for actual words:

- ""STEIN"" already used.
- ""TISUE"" – valid word (tissue).
   - Contains T, I, S, U, E.
   - Check positions:
     - T in 1: allowed (was in 2 before, now 1)
     - I in 2: allowed (was in 4 before, now 2)
     - S in 3: allowed (was in 1 and 4 before, now 3)
     - E in 4: allowed (was in 3 and 5 before, now 4)
     - U is new, allowed
   - No A, R, O, N.

This fits all constraints.

Another candidate could be ""TISUE"" or ""TISIC"" (but TISIC isn’t a valid word), so ""TISUE"" is the best choice.

<guess>TISUE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STEIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) E(-) I(-) N(x)
Guess 3: TISUE -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) I(-) S(-) U(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

Letters that are **in** the word and their positional constraints  
- T is correct in position 1 (✓)  
- I is in the word but **not** in position 2 (-)  
- S is in the word but **not** in position 3 (-)  
- E is in the word but **not** in position 5 (-)  

Letters **not** in the word  
A, R, O, N, U  

So the secret word looks like: T _ _ _ _ and must contain I, S, E exactly once each, with the additional constraints:

- S ≠ position 3  
- E ≠ position 5  
- I ≠ position 2  

We still need one more letter (from the remaining unused: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Let’s map possible positions:

Position 1: T (fixed)  
Position 2: cannot be I or any of S, E, T (T is already fixed)  
Position 3: cannot be S or any of I, E, T (T is fixed)  
Position 4: free except for the “not O, N, U” rule  
Position 5: cannot be E or any of I, S, T (T is fixed)

So:

- If position 2 = I, then 4 and 5 must hold S and E (in valid positions)  
- If position 2 = S, then 4 and 5 must hold I and E (in valid positions)  
- If position 2 = E, then 4 and 5 must hold I and S (in valid positions)  

Valid positions so far:

S: allowed in 2, 4, 5 (but not 1,3,4,5) – wait, S was already ruled out of 1 (AROSE) and 3 (TISUE), so S ∈ {2,4,5}  
E: allowed in 1,2,4 (not 3,5) – so E ∈ {1,2,4}  
I: allowed in 1,3,5 (not 2,4) – so I ∈ {1,3,5}

Let’s list valid placements:

Case 1: position 2 = I  
   T I _ _ _  
   Then 4 and 5 must hold S and E in some order.  
   - 4S,5E → T I _ 4S 5E – but E is banned from 5 → fail  
   - 4E,5S → T I _ 4E 5S – E is allowed in 4, S in 5 – this works!  
   So candidate: T I _ 4E 5S → “TI _ PE S” – need a letter for position 3 that is unused and valid.  
   Remaining common consonants: L, C, D, H, M, etc.  
   “TILPE” is not a word. “TIMES” is a word!  

Case 2: position 2 = S  
   T S _ _ _  
   Then 4 and 5 must hold I and E in some order.  
   - 4I,5E → T S _ 4I 5E – E banned from 5 → fail  
   - 4E,5I → T S _ 4E 5I – E in 4, I in 5 – this works!  
   So candidate: T S _ 4E 5I → “TS _ E I S” – need a letter for position 3.  
   “TSLIE” is not a word. “TSI” is only 3 letters.  
   Actually, “TS” + a letter + “E I S” – no common word.

Case 3: position 2 = E  
   T E _ _ _  
   Then 4 and 5 must hold I and S in some order.  
   - 4S,5I → T E _ 4S 5I – E in 2 is allowed, I in 5 is allowed, S in 4 is allowed – this works!  
   So candidate: T E _ 4S 5I → “TE _ S I” – need a letter for position 3.  
   “TELIS” is not a word. “TEMPI” is invalid.  
   “TESLA” has A (invalid).  
   “TESSY” – has S twice (possible but unlikely).

“TIMES” is the only valid English word that fits all constraints so far.

Let’s verify:  
- T in 1: ✓  
- I in 3: allowed (was in 2 before, now 3)  
- M is new and allowed  
- E in 4: allowed (was in 3,5 before, now 4)  
- S in 5: allowed (was in 1,4 before, now 5)  

All constraints satisfied.

Guess 4: TIMES -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) I(-) M(x) E(-) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let’s update what we now know after four guesses.

Known letters and positions  
- T is fixed in position 1 (✓).  
- S is fixed in position 5 (✓).  

Letters that are in the word but whose positions are still unknown  
- I (was in wrong positions 2, 3, 4) – must be in position 2 or 3 (since 1,4,5 are taken by T and S).  
- E (was in wrong positions 3, 5) – must be in position 2 or 4.  

Letters that are NOT in the word  
A, R, O, N, U, M.

So the pattern so far is:

T _ _ _ S

with the remaining letters {I, E} to be placed in positions 2, 3, 4.

Possible placements of I and E:

1. I in 2, E in 4 → T I _ E S  
   Need a letter for position 3 that is unused and valid.  
   Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z.  
   “T I B E S” → “TIBES” is not a word.  
   “T I C E S” → “TICES” is not a word.  
   “T I D E S” → “TIDES” is a valid word!

2. I in 3, E in 2 → T E I _ S  
   Need a letter for position 4.  
   “TEI _ S” – possible: “TEILS” (but L is allowed).  
   “TEI _ S” → “TEILS” is not a word.  
   “TEI _ S” → “TEIPS” (not a word).  

3. I in 4, E in 2 → T E _ I S  
   “TE _ I S” → “TELIS” (not a word).  
   “TEBIS” (not a word).  

4. I in 2, E in 3 → but E is banned from 3 (TIMES feedback).  

Thus the only valid candidate that fits all constraints is “TIDES”.

Check:  
- T in 1: ✓  
- I in 3: allowed (was in 2,3,4 before; 3 is new)  
- D is new and allowed  
- E in 4: allowed (was in 3,5 before; 4 is new)  
- S in 5: ✓  

All constraints satisfied.

  “T I C E S” → “TICES” – not a valid word
  “T I F E S” → “TIFES” – not a word
  “T I G E S” → “TIGES” – not a word
  “T I H E S” → “TIHES” – not a word
  “T I K E S” → “TIKES” – not a word
  “T I L E S” → “TILES” – valid word!

- I in 3, E in 2 → T E I _ S
  Need a letter for position 4.
  “TEI _ S” → “TEILS” – not a word
  “TEI _ S” → “TEIPS” – not a word

- I in 4, E in 2 → T E _ I S
  “TE _ I S” → “TELIS” – not a word

Thus the only valid candidate that fits all constraints is “TILES”.

Check:
- T in 1: ✓
- I in 3: allowed (was in 2,4 before; 3 is new)
- L is new and allowed
- E in 4: allowed (was in 3,5 before; 4 is new)
- S in 5: ✓

<guess>TILES</guess>",TILES,"Current fixed information:
- Position 1: T (✓)
- Position 5: S (✓)

Letters that must appear somewhere in the remaining four slots (positions 2,3,4) but whose exact spots are still unknown:
- I (was wrong in positions 2,3,4 so far → only position 1 and 5 are taken, so I must be in position 2 or 3)
- E (was wrong in positions 3,5 so far → positions 1 and 5 are taken, so E must be in position 2 or 4)

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
A, R, O, N, U, M, D

So the pattern is:
T _ _ _ S
with I and E occupying positions 2 and/or 4.

Possible combinations:
- I in 2, E in 4 → T I _ E S
  Need a letter for position 3 that is not yet ruled out.
