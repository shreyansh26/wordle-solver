### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

- R is NOT in the word (x)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

Also, none of O, S, E are in their guessed positions (positions 3,4,5 respectively).

To maximize new information, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Keeps O, S, E but moves them to new positions.
2. Introduces new common letters that haven’t been tested yet.

Letters we know are present: O, S, E

New common letters to test: T, N, I, L, C, D, U, etc.

A good candidate is “STONE”:

- N is new
- E moves from position 5 to 4

This tests three of the known letters in new spots plus two new letters (T, N).

- From Guess 2: O is not in position 3 (again), S not in 1, E not in 5 (again), T not in 2

So the secret word must contain all four of O, S, E, T (each exactly once) and one additional letter that hasn’t been tried yet.

The only way to arrange these five letters is to have one of them appear twice, but we already know N is out (from Guess 2) and A, R are out (from Guess 1). The remaining common letters that haven’t been tested yet are: I, L, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

- O in position 2 (was in 3, now 2)
- I (new letter)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these as possible without repeating letters. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us 5 distinct letters that are likely to appear in many words, providing good coverage for the first guess.

Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word contains the letters O, S, E (each once only) but none of A or R.  
Also, none of O, S, E are in their guessed positions (positions 3,4,5 respectively).

To maximize new information, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Keeps O, S, E but moves them to new positions.
2. Introduces new common letters that haven’t been tested yet.

Letters we know are present: O, S, E  
Letters we know are absent: A, R  

New common letters to test: T, N, I, L, C, D, U, etc.

A good candidate is “STONE”:
- S moves from position 4 to 1
- T is new
- O moves from position 3 to 2
- N is new
- E moves from position 5 to 4

This tests three of the known letters in new spots plus two new letters (T, N).

The only way to arrange these five letters is to have one of them appear twice, but we already know N is out (from Guess 2) and A, R are out (from Guess 1). The remaining common letters that haven’t been tested yet are: I, L, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

Let’s try to place the letters so that each of O, S, E, T appears once and a new letter appears once. A good candidate is “TOILE”:
- T in position 1 (new spot, never tried)
- O in position 2 (was in 3, now 2)
- I (new letter)
- L (new letter)
- E in position 5 (was in 5, now 5) — oops, that’s the same spot, so this is invalid.

Next candidate: “TOSIE”
- T in 1 (new)
- O in 2 (new)
- S in 3 (was in 1, now 3)
- I (new)
- E in 5 (was in 5, now 5) — again the same spot, invalid.

Next: “TOSES” — invalid (S repeats).

Next: “TWEET” — invalid (T and E repeat).

Next: “TOILE” already failed.

Next: “STOPE” — uses S, T, O, E, P. Let’s check positions:
- S in 1 (was in 1, now 1 — same spot, invalid).

Next: “PESTO” — P, E, S, T, O. Positions:
- P (new)
- E in 2 (was in 5, now 2 — ok)
- S in 3 (was in 1, now 3 — ok)
- T in 4 (was in 2, now 4 — ok)
- O in 5 (was in 3, now 5 — ok)

This places each of the known letters in a new spot and introduces P, which has not been tried yet. It is a valid permutation of the letters we know must be present.

From all feedback so far:

Letters known to be in the word (exactly once each):
- O, S, E, T

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
- A, R, N, P

Positions ruled out for each of O, S, E, T by the three guesses:

O: not 3 (from AROSE), not 3 (from STONE), not 5 (from PESTO) → possible positions 1, 2, 4
S: not 1 (from STONE), not 3 (from PESTO) → possible positions 2, 4, 5
E: not 5 (from AROSE), not 5 (from STONE), not 2 (from PESTO) → possible positions 1, 3, 4
T: not 2 (from STONE), not 4 (from PESTO) → possible positions 1, 3, 5

We need a 5-letter word that contains O, S, E, T plus one more letter (must be a new, untried consonant). The only common remaining letters not yet used are: I, L, C, D, U, M, etc.

Let’s try to place the letters systematically. 

Try position 1 with T: T _ _ _ _
Then E must be in 3 or 4, S in 2, 4, or 5, O in 2 or 4.

Possible word: T E S O _ → but we need 5 letters, so T E S O ? must be a consonant. “TESOR” is not a word. “TESLA” has A (out). “TESKO” has K (new). “TESKO” is not a word.

Try position 1 with O: O _ _ _ _
Then E must be in 1, 3, or 4. S in 2, 4, or 5. T in 3 or 5.

Let’s list permutations of O, S, E, T plus one new letter, keeping positions constraints.

After checking, the only valid permutation that forms a real 5-letter word with the new letter I (common and untried) is:

O S E T I → “OSETI” – invalid (not a word)

O T E S _ → “OTEST?” – no

S O E T _ → “SOET?” – no

E O S T _ → “EOST?” – no

T O S E _ → “TOSED” – valid word!

Check positions:
T (position 1) – allowed (was not ruled out)
O (position 2) – allowed (was not ruled out)
S (position 3) – allowed (was not ruled out)
E (position 4) – allowed (was not ruled out)
D (new letter) – allowed

So “TOSED” is a valid candidate.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these as possible without repeating letters. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us 5 distinct letters that are likely to appear in many words, providing good coverage for the first guess.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word contains the letters O, S, E (each once only) but none of A or R.  
Also, none of O, S, E are in their guessed positions (positions 3,4,5 respectively).

To maximize new information, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Keeps O, S, E but moves them to new positions.
2. Introduces new common letters that haven’t been tested yet.

Letters we know are present: O, S, E  
Letters we know are absent: A, R  

New common letters to test: T, N, I, L, C, D, U, etc.

A good candidate is “STONE”:
- S moves from position 4 to 1
- T is new
- O moves from position 3 to 2
- N is new
- E moves from position 5 to 4

This tests three of the known letters in new spots plus two new letters (T, N).

Guess 2: STONE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) O(-) N(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STONE → S(-) T(-) O(-) N(x) E(-)

What we now know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, N
- Letters that ARE in the word (but so far in the wrong places): O, S, E, T
- From Guess 1: O is not in position 3, S not in 4, E not in 5
- From Guess 2: O is not in position 3 (again), S not in 1, E not in 5 (again), T not in 2

So the secret word must contain all four of O, S, E, T (each exactly once) and one additional letter that hasn’t been tried yet.

The only way to arrange these five letters is to have one of them appear twice, but we already know N is out (from Guess 2) and A, R are out (from Guess 1). The remaining common letters that haven’t been tested yet are: I, L, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

Let’s try to place the letters so that each of O, S, E, T appears once and a new letter appears once. A good candidate is “TOILE”:
- T in position 1 (new spot, never tried)
- O in position 2 (was in 3, now 2)
- I (new letter)
- L (new letter)
- E in position 5 (was in 5, now 5) — oops, that’s the same spot, so this is invalid.

Next candidate: “TOSIE”
- T in 1 (new)
- O in 2 (new)
- S in 3 (was in 1, now 3)
- I (new)
- E in 5 (was in 5, now 5) — again the same spot, invalid.

Next: “TOSES” — invalid (S repeats).

Next: “TWEET” — invalid (T and E repeat).

Next: “TOILE” already failed.

Next: “STOPE” — uses S, T, O, E, P. Let’s check positions:
- S in 1 (was in 1, now 1 — same spot, invalid).

Next: “PESTO” — P, E, S, T, O. Positions:
- P (new)
- E in 2 (was in 5, now 2 — ok)
- S in 3 (was in 1, now 3 — ok)
- T in 4 (was in 2, now 4 — ok)
- O in 5 (was in 3, now 5 — ok)

This places each of the known letters in a new spot and introduces P, which has not been tried yet. It is a valid permutation of the letters we know must be present.

From all feedback so far:

Letters known to be in the word (exactly once each):
- O, S, E, T

Letters known NOT to be in the word:

Positions ruled out for each of O, S, E, T by the three guesses:

O: not 3 (from AROSE), not 3 (from STONE), not 5 (from PESTO) → possible positions 1, 2, 4
S: not 1 (from STONE), not 3 (from PESTO) → possible positions 2, 4, 5
E: not 5 (from AROSE), not 5 (from STONE), not 2 (from PESTO) → possible positions 1, 3, 4
T: not 2 (from STONE), not 4 (from PESTO) → possible positions 1, 3, 5

We need a 5-letter word that contains O, S, E, T plus one more letter (must be a new, untried consonant). The only common remaining letters not yet used are: I, L, C, D, U, M, etc.

Let’s try to place the letters systematically. 

Try position 1 with T: T _ _ _ _
Then E must be in 3 or 4, S in 2, 4, or 5, O in 2 or 4.

Possible word: T E S O _ → but we need 5 letters, so T E S O ? must be a consonant. “TESOR” is not a word. “TESLA” has A (out). “TESKO” has K (new). “TESKO” is not a word.

Try position 1 with O: O _ _ _ _
Then E must be in 1, 3, or 4. S in 2, 4, or 5. T in 3 or 5.

Let’s list permutations of O, S, E, T plus one new letter, keeping positions constraints.

After checking, the only valid permutation that forms a real 5-letter word with the new letter I (common and untried) is:

O S E T I → “OSETI” – invalid (not a word)

O T E S _ → “OTEST?” – no

S O E T _ → “SOET?” – no

E O S T _ → “EOST?” – no

T O S E _ → “TOSED” – valid word!

Check positions:
T (position 1) – allowed (was not ruled out)
O (position 2) – allowed (was not ruled out)
S (position 3) – allowed (was not ruled out)
E (position 4) – allowed (was not ruled out)
D (new letter) – allowed

So “TOSED” is a valid candidate.

E(✓)  → E is correct in position 4

Letters already ruled out: A, R, N, P, D

Letters already confirmed: T, O, E in their exact positions
Letters still floating: S (must appear once, not in position 3)

Where can S go?
- Position 3 is forbidden for S (from PESTO feedback)
- Position 1 is taken by T
- Position 2 is taken by O
- Position 4 is taken by E
- Therefore S must be in position 5

So the word must be: T O _ E S

The blank (position 3) must be a new letter that has not yet been tried and is not A, R, N, P, D, S (since S is already used in 5).

Common remaining letters: I, L, C, U, M, G, etc.

A valid 5-letter word matching T O _ E S is “TOGES” – but G is not ruled out yet.

However, “TOGES” is not an English word. The only valid English word fitting this pattern is “TOLES”.

Check letters:
- T, O, E, S all in correct positions as per feedback
- L is new and not yet tried.

Thus, “TOLES” is the logical next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these as possible without repeating letters. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us 5 distinct letters that are likely to appear in many words, providing good coverage for the first guess.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word contains the letters O, S, E (each once only) but none of A or R.  
Also, none of O, S, E are in their guessed positions (positions 3,4,5 respectively).

To maximize new information, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Keeps O, S, E but moves them to new positions.
2. Introduces new common letters that haven’t been tested yet.

Letters we know are present: O, S, E  
Letters we know are absent: A, R  

New common letters to test: T, N, I, L, C, D, U, etc.

A good candidate is “STONE”:
- S moves from position 4 to 1
- T is new
- O moves from position 3 to 2
- N is new
- E moves from position 5 to 4

This tests three of the known letters in new spots plus two new letters (T, N).

<guess>STONE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STONE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) O(-) N(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STONE → S(-) T(-) O(-) N(x) E(-)

What we now know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, N
- Letters that ARE in the word (but so far in the wrong places): O, S, E, T
- From Guess 1: O is not in position 3, S not in 4, E not in 5
- From Guess 2: O is not in position 3 (again), S not in 1, E not in 5 (again), T not in 2

So the secret word must contain all four of O, S, E, T (each exactly once) and one additional letter that hasn’t been tried yet.

The only way to arrange these five letters is to have one of them appear twice, but we already know N is out (from Guess 2) and A, R are out (from Guess 1). The remaining common letters that haven’t been tested yet are: I, L, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

Let’s try to place the letters so that each of O, S, E, T appears once and a new letter appears once. A good candidate is “TOILE”:
- T in position 1 (new spot, never tried)
- O in position 2 (was in 3, now 2)
- I (new letter)
- L (new letter)
- E in position 5 (was in 5, now 5) — oops, that’s the same spot, so this is invalid.

Next candidate: “TOSIE”
- T in 1 (new)
- O in 2 (new)
- S in 3 (was in 1, now 3)
- I (new)
- E in 5 (was in 5, now 5) — again the same spot, invalid.

Next: “TOSES” — invalid (S repeats).

Next: “TWEET” — invalid (T and E repeat).

Next: “TOILE” already failed.

Next: “STOPE” — uses S, T, O, E, P. Let’s check positions:
- S in 1 (was in 1, now 1 — same spot, invalid).

Next: “PESTO” — P, E, S, T, O. Positions:
- P (new)
- E in 2 (was in 5, now 2 — ok)
- S in 3 (was in 1, now 3 — ok)
- T in 4 (was in 2, now 4 — ok)
- O in 5 (was in 3, now 5 — ok)

This places each of the known letters in a new spot and introduces P, which has not been tried yet. It is a valid permutation of the letters we know must be present.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STONE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) O(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 3: PESTO -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(-) S(-) T(-) O(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From all feedback so far:

Letters known to be in the word (exactly once each):
- O, S, E, T

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
- A, R, N, P

Positions ruled out for each of O, S, E, T by the three guesses:

O: not 3 (from AROSE), not 3 (from STONE), not 5 (from PESTO) → possible positions 1, 2, 4
S: not 1 (from STONE), not 3 (from PESTO) → possible positions 2, 4, 5
E: not 5 (from AROSE), not 5 (from STONE), not 2 (from PESTO) → possible positions 1, 3, 4
T: not 2 (from STONE), not 4 (from PESTO) → possible positions 1, 3, 5

We need a 5-letter word that contains O, S, E, T plus one more letter (must be a new, untried consonant). The only common remaining letters not yet used are: I, L, C, D, U, M, etc.

Let’s try to place the letters systematically. 

Try position 1 with T: T _ _ _ _
Then E must be in 3 or 4, S in 2, 4, or 5, O in 2 or 4.

Possible word: T E S O _ → but we need 5 letters, so T E S O ? must be a consonant. “TESOR” is not a word. “TESLA” has A (out). “TESKO” has K (new). “TESKO” is not a word.

Try position 1 with O: O _ _ _ _
Then E must be in 1, 3, or 4. S in 2, 4, or 5. T in 3 or 5.

Let’s list permutations of O, S, E, T plus one new letter, keeping positions constraints.

After checking, the only valid permutation that forms a real 5-letter word with the new letter I (common and untried) is:

O S E T I → “OSETI” – invalid (not a word)

O T E S _ → “OTEST?” – no

S O E T _ → “SOET?” – no

E O S T _ → “EOST?” – no

T O S E _ → “TOSED” – valid word!

Check positions:
T (position 1) – allowed (was not ruled out)
O (position 2) – allowed (was not ruled out)
S (position 3) – allowed (was not ruled out)
E (position 4) – allowed (was not ruled out)
D (new letter) – allowed

So “TOSED” is a valid candidate.

Guess 4: TOSED -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on TOSED:

T(✓)  → T is correct in position 1  
O(✓)  → O is correct in position 2  
S(-)  → S is in the word but not in position 3  
E(✓)  → E is correct in position 4  
D(x)  → D is not in the word  

So far we know the secret word looks like: T O _ E _

Letters still required:
- S (must appear once, not in position 3)
- one more letter that has not yet been tried (and it cannot be A, R, N, P, D)

Letters already ruled out: A, R, N, P, D

Letters already confirmed: T, O, E in their exact positions
Letters still floating: S (must appear once, not in position 3)

Where can S go?
- Position 3 is forbidden for S (from PESTO feedback)
- Position 1 is taken by T
- Position 2 is taken by O
- Position 4 is taken by E
- Therefore S must be in position 5

So the word must be: T O _ E S

The blank (position 3) must be a new letter that has not yet been tried and is not A, R, N, P, D, S (since S is already used in 5).

Common remaining letters: I, L, C, U, M, G, etc.

A valid 5-letter word matching T O _ E S is “TOGES” – but G is not ruled out yet.

However, “TOGES” is not an English word. The only valid English word fitting this pattern is “TOLES”.

Check letters:
- T, O, E, S all in correct positions as per feedback
- L is new and not yet tried.

Thus, “TOLES” is the logical next guess.

From the feedback on TOLES:
- T(✓) – position 1 correct
- O(✓) – position 2 correct
- L(x) – L is NOT in the word
- E(✓) – position 4 correct
- S(✓) – position 5 correct

So the word is now fully determined:
T O _ E S

The only blank is position 3.  
Letters already ruled out: A, R, N, P, D, L  
Letters already confirmed in other positions: T, O, E, S  

Remaining common letters not yet tried for position 3: I, C, U, M, G, etc.

The only valid English word matching T O _ E S is “TOIES” (if we allow I), “TOCES” (but C is common), “TOMES” (but M is common), etc.

Among these, “TOIES” is a real word (though uncommon), but the most common and likely intended word is “TOCES” (C is a common consonant).

Therefore, the secret word must be “TOCES”.
