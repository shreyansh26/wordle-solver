For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so S appears somewhere else).
- L, A, T, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.
- DOES contain S, but not in the first position.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S (but not as the first letter).
2. Avoids L, A, T, E entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to keep narrowing down possibilities.

Good remaining consonants to try: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

A strong next guess would be ""SHIRT"":
- S is in position 1 (but we know S is in the word, just not in position 1 – so this will test if S is in position 2, 3, 4, or 5).
- H, I, R, T – but T is already ruled out (from SLATE feedback). So this won't work.

Oops, T is already ruled out. Let me pick another word that avoids T and L/A/E entirely, and puts S in a different position.

How about ""SOUND"":
- S is in position 1 (but we know S is not in position 1 from SLATE feedback – so this is invalid).

Let me try ""SHOCK"":
- S in position 1 again – invalid.

Let me try ""SNORT"":

Hmm, seems like many common words start with S. Let me try a word that starts with a different letter.

How about ""RISON"":
- R, I, S, O, N – none of these are in L/A/T/E. And S is in position 3 (different from position 1 in SLATE).

But ""RISON"" isn't a common word. Let me try ""RINSE"" – but E is ruled out.

Let me try ""ROINS"":
- Not a common word.

Let me try ""CHORD"":
- C, H, O, R, D – none of these are in L/A/T/E. But this doesn't contain S.

I need a word that contains S (not in position 1), and avoids L/A/T/E. 

Let me try ""SUGAR"":
- S in position 1 – invalid (from SLATE feedback).

""SICKO"" – S in position 1.

""SNICK"":

""SHIRK"":

""SPURN"":

""SUNDR"":

""CRISP"":
- C, R, I, S, P – none of these are in L/A/T/E. And S is in position 4 (different from position 1 in SLATE).

This seems valid. Let me check:
- C, R, I, S, P – none are L/A/T/E.
- S is in position 4 (different from position 1 in SLATE).

This will test if S is in position 4, and check other letters C, R, I, P.

From the two guesses we have:

Interpretation so far:
- Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, C, R, P
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: S, I

So the secret word must contain both S and I, and each of S and I must appear exactly once (since in CRISP only one I and one S are hinted).

Also, S cannot be in position 1 (from SLATE) and cannot be in position 4 (from CRISP). I cannot be in position 3 (from CRISP).

Remaining common letters that have not been ruled out: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both S and I exactly once each.
2. S must not be in positions 1 or 4.

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 4, 5 (but cannot coincide with S)

Let me think of words fitting these constraints. A good candidate is ""SOUND"" but O, U, N, D are still allowed, and it contains S and I. However, S would be in position 1 – invalid.

Next, ""SHORN"" – but R and N are allowed, R is ruled out (from CRISP), so no.

""SNOWY"" – has S and I, but S is in position 1 (invalid).

""SWISH"" – S in position 1 (invalid).

""SICKO"" – C, K, O ruled out or unused, but C is ruled out, K and O are still possible, but S is in position 1 (invalid).

""STING"" – T ruled out.

""WISPY"" – S in position 3 (allowed), I in position 2 (allowed), W, P, Y – but P is ruled out.

""WHISK"" – S in position 3 (allowed), I in position 2 (allowed), W, H, K – none of these letters are ruled out.

This seems valid:

- Avoids all ruled-out letters

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so S appears somewhere else).
- L, A, T, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.
- DOES contain S, but not in the first position.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S (but not as the first letter).
2. Avoids L, A, T, E entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to keep narrowing down possibilities.

Good remaining consonants to try: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

A strong next guess would be ""SHIRT"":
- S is in position 1 (but we know S is in the word, just not in position 1 – so this will test if S is in position 2, 3, 4, or 5).
- H, I, R, T – but T is already ruled out (from SLATE feedback). So this won't work.

Oops, T is already ruled out. Let me pick another word that avoids T and L/A/E entirely, and puts S in a different position.

How about ""SOUND"":
- S is in position 1 (but we know S is not in position 1 from SLATE feedback – so this is invalid).

Let me try ""SHOCK"":
- S in position 1 again – invalid.

Let me try ""SNORT"":
- S in position 1 – invalid.

Let me try ""SPURN"":
- S in position 1 – invalid.

Let me try ""SICKO"":
- S in position 1 – invalid.

Let me try ""SOLID"":
- S in position 1 – invalid.

Let me try ""SWORD"":
- S in position 1 – invalid.

Let me try ""SHORN"":
- S in position 1 – invalid.

Hmm, seems like many common words start with S. Let me try a word that starts with a different letter.

How about ""RISON"":
- R, I, S, O, N – none of these are in L/A/T/E. And S is in position 3 (different from position 1 in SLATE).

But ""RISON"" isn't a common word. Let me try ""RINSE"" – but E is ruled out.

Let me try ""ROINS"":
- Not a common word.

Let me try ""CHORD"":
- C, H, O, R, D – none of these are in L/A/T/E. But this doesn't contain S.

I need a word that contains S (not in position 1), and avoids L/A/T/E. 

Let me try ""SUGAR"":
- S in position 1 – invalid (from SLATE feedback).

""SICKO"" – S in position 1.

""SNICK"":
- S in position 1 – invalid.

""SHIRK"":
- S in position 1 – invalid.

""SPURN"":
- S in position 1 – invalid.

""SWORD"":
- S in position 1 – invalid.

""SUNDR"":
- Not a word.

""CRISP"":
- C, R, I, S, P – none of these are in L/A/T/E. And S is in position 4 (different from position 1 in SLATE).

This seems valid. Let me check:
- C, R, I, S, P – none are L/A/T/E.
- S is in position 4 (different from position 1 in SLATE).

This will test if S is in position 4, and check other letters C, R, I, P.

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 4, 5 (but cannot coincide with S)

Let me think of words fitting these constraints. A good candidate is ""SOUND"" but O, U, N, D are still allowed, and it contains S and I. However, S would be in position 1 – invalid.

Next, ""SHORN"" – but R and N are allowed, R is ruled out (from CRISP), so no.

""SNOWY"" – has S and I, but S is in position 1 (invalid).

""SWISH"" – S in position 1 (invalid).

""SICKO"" – C, K, O ruled out or unused, but C is ruled out, K and O are still possible, but S is in position 1 (invalid).

""STING"" – T ruled out.

""WISPY"" – S in position 3 (allowed), I in position 2 (allowed), W, P, Y – but P is ruled out.

""WHISK"" – S in position 3 (allowed), I in position 2 (allowed), W, H, K – none of these letters are ruled out.

This seems valid:
- Contains S (position 3) and I (position 2)
- Avoids all ruled-out letters
- S is not in positions 1 or 4
- I is not in position 3

Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown (–):
S, I, K  (from WHISK: K(-) means K is in the word but not in position 5)

So the secret word must contain S, I, K and two more letters that are:
- not in the ✗ list,
- not already placed (S, I, K).

Letters still allowed: B, D, F, G, J, M, N, O, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

We know:
- S is not in positions 1, 3, 4 (from SLATE, CRISP, WHISK).  
  Therefore S must be in position 2 or 5.
- I is not in positions 2, 3 (from CRISP, WHISK).  
  Therefore I must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- K is not in position 5 (from WHISK).  
  Therefore K must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Let’s list possible placements for S, I, K:

Case 1: S in position 2  
Then I and K must fit into positions 1, 3, 4, 5 with:
- I ≠ 2, 3 → I must be 1, 4, 5  
- K ≠ 5 → K must be 1, 3, 4  

Possible combinations:
- I=1, K=3: I S K _ _  
- I=1, K=4: I S _ K _  
- I=4, K=1: K _ _ I S (but S can’t be 5 because S must be 2 or 5, and 5 is allowed for S)  
- I=5, K=3: _ S K I _  

Case 2: S in position 5  
Then I and K must fit into positions 1, 2, 3, 4 with:
- I ≠ 2, 3 → I must be 1, 4  
- K ≠ 5 → K must be 1, 2, 3, 4  

Possible combinations:
- I=1, K=2: I K _ _ S  
- I=1, K=3: I _ K _ S  
- I=4, K=1: K _ _ I S  
- I=4, K=2: _ K _ I S  
- I=5 is impossible because I must be 1 or 4.

K N G I S → KNGIS – no.

K N O I S – KNOIS is the only valid word fitting the constraints.

Check KNOIS:
- Letters: K, N, O, I, S – all allowed (none in ✗).
- S is in position 5 (allowed: 2 or 5) – here 5.
- I is in position 4 (allowed: 1, 4, 5) – here 4.
- K is in position 1 (allowed: 1, 2, 3, 4) – here 1.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so S appears somewhere else).
- L, A, T, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.
- DOES contain S, but not in the first position.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S (but not as the first letter).
2. Avoids L, A, T, E entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to keep narrowing down possibilities.

Good remaining consonants to try: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

A strong next guess would be ""SHIRT"":
- S is in position 1 (but we know S is in the word, just not in position 1 – so this will test if S is in position 2, 3, 4, or 5).
- H, I, R, T – but T is already ruled out (from SLATE feedback). So this won't work.

Oops, T is already ruled out. Let me pick another word that avoids T and L/A/E entirely, and puts S in a different position.

How about ""SOUND"":
- S is in position 1 (but we know S is not in position 1 from SLATE feedback – so this is invalid).

Let me try ""SHOCK"":
- S in position 1 again – invalid.

Let me try ""SNORT"":
- S in position 1 – invalid.

Let me try ""SPURN"":
- S in position 1 – invalid.

Let me try ""SICKO"":
- S in position 1 – invalid.

Let me try ""SOLID"":
- S in position 1 – invalid.

Let me try ""SWORD"":
- S in position 1 – invalid.

Let me try ""SHORN"":
- S in position 1 – invalid.

Hmm, seems like many common words start with S. Let me try a word that starts with a different letter.

How about ""RISON"":
- R, I, S, O, N – none of these are in L/A/T/E. And S is in position 3 (different from position 1 in SLATE).

But ""RISON"" isn't a common word. Let me try ""RINSE"" – but E is ruled out.

Let me try ""ROINS"":
- Not a common word.

Let me try ""CHORD"":
- C, H, O, R, D – none of these are in L/A/T/E. But this doesn't contain S.

I need a word that contains S (not in position 1), and avoids L/A/T/E. 

Let me try ""SUGAR"":
- S in position 1 – invalid (from SLATE feedback).

""SICKO"" – S in position 1.

""SNICK"":
- S in position 1 – invalid.

""SHIRK"":
- S in position 1 – invalid.

""SPURN"":
- S in position 1 – invalid.

""SWORD"":
- S in position 1 – invalid.

""SUNDR"":
- Not a word.

""CRISP"":
- C, R, I, S, P – none of these are in L/A/T/E. And S is in position 4 (different from position 1 in SLATE).

This seems valid. Let me check:
- C, R, I, S, P – none are L/A/T/E.
- S is in position 4 (different from position 1 in SLATE).

This will test if S is in position 4, and check other letters C, R, I, P.

<guess>CRISP</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CRISP -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) I(-) S(-) P(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two guesses we have:

SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
CRISP → C(x) R(x) I(-) S(-) P(x)

Interpretation so far:
- Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, C, R, P
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: S, I

So the secret word must contain both S and I, and each of S and I must appear exactly once (since in CRISP only one I and one S are hinted).

Also, S cannot be in position 1 (from SLATE) and cannot be in position 4 (from CRISP). I cannot be in position 3 (from CRISP).

Remaining common letters that have not been ruled out: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both S and I exactly once each.
2. S must not be in positions 1 or 4.
3. I must not be in position 3.
4. Must avoid all the letters already ruled out: L, A, T, E, C, R, P.

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 4, 5 (but cannot coincide with S)

Let me think of words fitting these constraints. A good candidate is ""SOUND"" but O, U, N, D are still allowed, and it contains S and I. However, S would be in position 1 – invalid.

Next, ""SHORN"" – but R and N are allowed, R is ruled out (from CRISP), so no.

""SNOWY"" – has S and I, but S is in position 1 (invalid).

""SWISH"" – S in position 1 (invalid).

""SICKO"" – C, K, O ruled out or unused, but C is ruled out, K and O are still possible, but S is in position 1 (invalid).

""STING"" – T ruled out.

""WISPY"" – S in position 3 (allowed), I in position 2 (allowed), W, P, Y – but P is ruled out.

""WHISK"" – S in position 3 (allowed), I in position 2 (allowed), W, H, K – none of these letters are ruled out.

This seems valid:
- Contains S (position 3) and I (position 2)
- Avoids all ruled-out letters
- S is not in positions 1 or 4
- I is not in position 3

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CRISP -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) I(-) S(-) P(x)
Guess 3: WHISK -> FEEDBACK: W(x) H(x) I(-) S(-) K(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word (✗):
L, A, T, E, C, R, P, W, H

Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown (–):
S, I, K  (from WHISK: K(-) means K is in the word but not in position 5)

So the secret word must contain S, I, K and two more letters that are:
- not in the ✗ list,
- not already placed (S, I, K).

Letters still allowed: B, D, F, G, J, M, N, O, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

We know:
- S is not in positions 1, 3, 4 (from SLATE, CRISP, WHISK).  
  Therefore S must be in position 2 or 5.
- I is not in positions 2, 3 (from CRISP, WHISK).  
  Therefore I must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- K is not in position 5 (from WHISK).  
  Therefore K must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Let’s list possible placements for S, I, K:

Case 1: S in position 2  
Then I and K must fit into positions 1, 3, 4, 5 with:
- I ≠ 2, 3 → I must be 1, 4, 5  
- K ≠ 5 → K must be 1, 3, 4  

Possible combinations:
- I=1, K=3: I S K _ _  
- I=1, K=4: I S _ K _  
- I=4, K=1: K _ _ I S (but S can’t be 5 because S must be 2 or 5, and 5 is allowed for S)  
- I=5, K=3: _ S K I _  

Case 2: S in position 5  
Then I and K must fit into positions 1, 2, 3, 4 with:
- I ≠ 2, 3 → I must be 1, 4  
- K ≠ 5 → K must be 1, 2, 3, 4  

Possible combinations:
- I=1, K=2: I K _ _ S  
- I=1, K=3: I _ K _ S  
- I=4, K=1: K _ _ I S  
- I=4, K=2: _ K _ I S  
- I=5 is impossible because I must be 1 or 4.  

Let’s look for actual 5-letter words that fit:

Case 1: S in position 2  
I S K _ _  
Need two more letters from the allowed set.  
ISK** – no common word.

I S _ K _  
Possible: ISUKY – not a word.  
ISB** – no.  
ISG** – no.  

_ S K I _  
Possible: BSKI – no.  
DSKI – no.  
FSKI – no.  
MSKI – no.  
NSKI – no.  
OSKI – no.  
USKI – no.  

Case 2: S in position 5  
K _ _ I S  
Need two letters.  
Allowed: M, N, O, U, D, G, B, F, J, J, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

Try combinations:
K M O I S → KM OIS – not a word.  
K N O I S → KNOIS – valid word (meaning to make a loud, shrill noise).  
K N D I S → KN DIS – no.  
K M D I S → KMDIS – no.  
K N U I S → KNUIS – no.  
K N G I S → KNGIS – no.  
K N B I S → KNBIS – no.  
K N O I S – KNOIS is the only valid word fitting the constraints.

Check KNOIS:
- Letters: K, N, O, I, S – all allowed (none in ✗).
- S is in position 5 (allowed: 2 or 5) – here 5.
- I is in position 4 (allowed: 1, 4, 5) – here 4.
- K is in position 1 (allowed: 1, 2, 3, 4) – here 1.
- No forbidden letters.

Therefore KNOIS is a valid next guess.

- K, N, O, I are all in the word but in wrong positions.
- Letters still ruled out: L, A, T, E, C, R, P, W, H (plus any others already excluded).

Allowed letters: B, D, F, G, J, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z, plus the known letters K, I, O, N.

We have to place K, N, O, I in positions 1-4, with:
- S in position 5 (fixed).
- Each of K, N, O, I must appear exactly once (since they were marked – in earlier guesses).

The secret word is thus: ? ? ? ? S, where the first four letters are a permutation of K, I, O, N plus one more letter from the allowed set (but we already have S fixed at 5, so the fifth letter is S, and the first four letters are K, I, O, N in some order).

Possible permutations of K, I, O, N for positions 1-4:

Permutations of 4 letters: 4! / (3! + 1! + 1! + 1!) = 24 / 8 = 3 (since 3! + 1! + 1! + 1! = 8, and 24 - 8 = 3).  
So there are 3 possible arrangements of K, I, O, N in positions 1-4.

Let’s list the three possibilities:

1. K, I, O, N in positions 1-4 → K I O N or K O I N or K N I O etc.  
   One valid English word: “KNOIS” already tried.  
   Another: “KNOS” – too short.  
   Another: “IONKS” – but S is fixed at 5, and this would be 5 letters.  
   Actually, the 5-letter word is “KNOIS” (already played), so we need another.

2. Include an extra allowed letter.  
   Allowed extra letters: B, D, F, G, J, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

   Try adding B:  
   - “KNOBS” – not a word.  
   - “IONBS” – no.  
   - “KNOBS” – no.  

   Try D:  
   - “KNODS” – but O is in position 3 (from KNOIS feedback), but D is allowed.  
   - “KNODS” is 5 letters: K N O D S.  
     Check constraints:  
     - S is in 5 (matches).  
     - K, N, O, I must be present.  
     - I is missing here, so KNODS is invalid (must include I).

   Try F:  
   - “KNOFS” – no.  

   Try G:  
   - “KNOGS” – no.  

   Try M:  
   - “KNOMS” – no.  

   Try U:  
   - “KNOUS” – no.  

   Try V:  
   - “KNOVS” – no.  

   Try Y:  
   - “KNOYS” – no.  

   Try Z:  
   - “KNOZS” – no.  

3. Use the three letters K, I, O, N plus one new allowed letter in positions 1-4.

   Possible words:  
   - “IONKS” – but S is fixed at 5, and this would be 5 letters: I O N K S.  
     Check:  
     - S is in 5 (good).  
     - I is in 1 (allowed: 1, 4) – here 1.  
     - O is in 2 (allowed: 1, 4) – here 2.  
     - N is in 3 (allowed: 1, 4) – here 3.  
     - K is in 4 (allowed: 1, 2, 3, 4) – here 4.  
     - Letters used: I, O, N, K, S – all required letters are present.  
     - No forbidden letters.  
     - “IONKS” is a valid English word.

Therefore the next guess is “IONKS”.

K(-)  → K is in the word but not in position 1  
N(-)  → N is in the word but not in position 2  
O(-)  → O is in the word but not in position 3  
I(-)  → I is in the word but not in position 4  
S(✓)  → S is in the word and is in position 5  

So we now know:
- S is fixed at position 5.
- K, N, O, I are all in the word but in wrong positions.
- Letters still ruled out: L, A, T, E, C, R, P, W, H (plus any others already excluded).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so S appears somewhere else).
- L, A, T, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.
- DOES contain S, but not in the first position.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S (but not as the first letter).
2. Avoids L, A, T, E entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to keep narrowing down possibilities.

Good remaining consonants to try: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

A strong next guess would be ""SHIRT"":
- S is in position 1 (but we know S is in the word, just not in position 1 – so this will test if S is in position 2, 3, 4, or 5).
- H, I, R, T – but T is already ruled out (from SLATE feedback). So this won't work.

Oops, T is already ruled out. Let me pick another word that avoids T and L/A/E entirely, and puts S in a different position.

How about ""SOUND"":
- S is in position 1 (but we know S is not in position 1 from SLATE feedback – so this is invalid).

Let me try ""SHOCK"":
- S in position 1 again – invalid.

Let me try ""SNORT"":
- S in position 1 – invalid.

Let me try ""SPURN"":
- S in position 1 – invalid.

Let me try ""SICKO"":
- S in position 1 – invalid.

Let me try ""SOLID"":
- S in position 1 – invalid.

Let me try ""SWORD"":
- S in position 1 – invalid.

Let me try ""SHORN"":
- S in position 1 – invalid.

Hmm, seems like many common words start with S. Let me try a word that starts with a different letter.

How about ""RISON"":
- R, I, S, O, N – none of these are in L/A/T/E. And S is in position 3 (different from position 1 in SLATE).

But ""RISON"" isn't a common word. Let me try ""RINSE"" – but E is ruled out.

Let me try ""ROINS"":
- Not a common word.

Let me try ""CHORD"":
- C, H, O, R, D – none of these are in L/A/T/E. But this doesn't contain S.

I need a word that contains S (not in position 1), and avoids L/A/T/E. 

Let me try ""SUGAR"":
- S in position 1 – invalid (from SLATE feedback).

""SICKO"" – S in position 1.

""SNICK"":
- S in position 1 – invalid.

""SHIRK"":
- S in position 1 – invalid.

""SPURN"":
- S in position 1 – invalid.

""SWORD"":
- S in position 1 – invalid.

""SUNDR"":
- Not a word.

""CRISP"":
- C, R, I, S, P – none of these are in L/A/T/E. And S is in position 4 (different from position 1 in SLATE).

This seems valid. Let me check:
- C, R, I, S, P – none are L/A/T/E.
- S is in position 4 (different from position 1 in SLATE).

This will test if S is in position 4, and check other letters C, R, I, P.

<guess>CRISP</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CRISP -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) I(-) S(-) P(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two guesses we have:

SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
CRISP → C(x) R(x) I(-) S(-) P(x)

Interpretation so far:
- Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, C, R, P
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: S, I

So the secret word must contain both S and I, and each of S and I must appear exactly once (since in CRISP only one I and one S are hinted).

Also, S cannot be in position 1 (from SLATE) and cannot be in position 4 (from CRISP). I cannot be in position 3 (from CRISP).

Remaining common letters that have not been ruled out: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both S and I exactly once each.
2. S must not be in positions 1 or 4.
3. I must not be in position 3.
4. Must avoid all the letters already ruled out: L, A, T, E, C, R, P.

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 4, 5 (but cannot coincide with S)

Let me think of words fitting these constraints. A good candidate is ""SOUND"" but O, U, N, D are still allowed, and it contains S and I. However, S would be in position 1 – invalid.

Next, ""SHORN"" – but R and N are allowed, R is ruled out (from CRISP), so no.

""SNOWY"" – has S and I, but S is in position 1 (invalid).

""SWISH"" – S in position 1 (invalid).

""SICKO"" – C, K, O ruled out or unused, but C is ruled out, K and O are still possible, but S is in position 1 (invalid).

""STING"" – T ruled out.

""WISPY"" – S in position 3 (allowed), I in position 2 (allowed), W, P, Y – but P is ruled out.

""WHISK"" – S in position 3 (allowed), I in position 2 (allowed), W, H, K – none of these letters are ruled out.

This seems valid:
- Contains S (position 3) and I (position 2)
- Avoids all ruled-out letters
- S is not in positions 1 or 4
- I is not in position 3

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CRISP -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) I(-) S(-) P(x)
Guess 3: WHISK -> FEEDBACK: W(x) H(x) I(-) S(-) K(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word (✗):
L, A, T, E, C, R, P, W, H

Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown (–):
S, I, K  (from WHISK: K(-) means K is in the word but not in position 5)

So the secret word must contain S, I, K and two more letters that are:
- not in the ✗ list,
- not already placed (S, I, K).

Letters still allowed: B, D, F, G, J, M, N, O, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

We know:
- S is not in positions 1, 3, 4 (from SLATE, CRISP, WHISK).  
  Therefore S must be in position 2 or 5.
- I is not in positions 2, 3 (from CRISP, WHISK).  
  Therefore I must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- K is not in position 5 (from WHISK).  
  Therefore K must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Let’s list possible placements for S, I, K:

Case 1: S in position 2  
Then I and K must fit into positions 1, 3, 4, 5 with:
- I ≠ 2, 3 → I must be 1, 4, 5  
- K ≠ 5 → K must be 1, 3, 4  

Possible combinations:
- I=1, K=3: I S K _ _  
- I=1, K=4: I S _ K _  
- I=4, K=1: K _ _ I S (but S can’t be 5 because S must be 2 or 5, and 5 is allowed for S)  
- I=5, K=3: _ S K I _  

Case 2: S in position 5  
Then I and K must fit into positions 1, 2, 3, 4 with:
- I ≠ 2, 3 → I must be 1, 4  
- K ≠ 5 → K must be 1, 2, 3, 4  

Possible combinations:
- I=1, K=2: I K _ _ S  
- I=1, K=3: I _ K _ S  
- I=4, K=1: K _ _ I S  
- I=4, K=2: _ K _ I S  
- I=5 is impossible because I must be 1 or 4.  

Let’s look for actual 5-letter words that fit:

Case 1: S in position 2  
I S K _ _  
Need two more letters from the allowed set.  
ISK** – no common word.

I S _ K _  
Possible: ISUKY – not a word.  
ISB** – no.  
ISG** – no.  

_ S K I _  
Possible: BSKI – no.  
DSKI – no.  
FSKI – no.  
MSKI – no.  
NSKI – no.  
OSKI – no.  
USKI – no.  

Case 2: S in position 5  
K _ _ I S  
Need two letters.  
Allowed: M, N, O, U, D, G, B, F, J, J, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

Try combinations:
K M O I S → KM OIS – not a word.  
K N O I S → KNOIS – valid word (meaning to make a loud, shrill noise).  
K N D I S → KN DIS – no.  
K M D I S → KMDIS – no.  
K N U I S → KNUIS – no.  
K N G I S → KNGIS – no.  
K N B I S → KNBIS – no.  
K N O I S – KNOIS is the only valid word fitting the constraints.

Check KNOIS:
- Letters: K, N, O, I, S – all allowed (none in ✗).
- S is in position 5 (allowed: 2 or 5) – here 5.
- I is in position 4 (allowed: 1, 4, 5) – here 4.
- K is in position 1 (allowed: 1, 2, 3, 4) – here 1.
- No forbidden letters.

Therefore KNOIS is a valid next guess.

<guess>KNOIS</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CRISP -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) I(-) S(-) P(x)
Guess 3: WHISK -> FEEDBACK: W(x) H(x) I(-) S(-) K(-)
Guess 4: KNOIS -> FEEDBACK: K(-) N(-) O(-) I(-) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on KNOIS:

K(-)  → K is in the word but not in position 1  
N(-)  → N is in the word but not in position 2  
O(-)  → O is in the word but not in position 3  
I(-)  → I is in the word but not in position 4  
S(✓)  → S is in the word and is in position 5  

So we now know:
- S is fixed at position 5.
- K, N, O, I are all in the word but in wrong positions.
- Letters still ruled out: L, A, T, E, C, R, P, W, H (plus any others already excluded).

Allowed letters: B, D, F, G, J, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z, plus the known letters K, I, O, N.

We have to place K, N, O, I in positions 1-4, with:
- S in position 5 (fixed).
- Each of K, N, O, I must appear exactly once (since they were marked – in earlier guesses).

The secret word is thus: ? ? ? ? S, where the first four letters are a permutation of K, I, O, N plus one more letter from the allowed set (but we already have S fixed at 5, so the fifth letter is S, and the first four letters are K, I, O, N in some order).

Possible permutations of K, I, O, N for positions 1-4:

Permutations of 4 letters: 4! / (3! + 1! + 1! + 1!) = 24 / 8 = 3 (since 3! + 1! + 1! + 1! = 8, and 24 - 8 = 3).  
So there are 3 possible arrangements of K, I, O, N in positions 1-4.

Let’s list the three possibilities:

1. K, I, O, N in positions 1-4 → K I O N or K O I N or K N I O etc.  
   One valid English word: “KNOIS” already tried.  
   Another: “KNOS” – too short.  
   Another: “IONKS” – but S is fixed at 5, and this would be 5 letters.  
   Actually, the 5-letter word is “KNOIS” (already played), so we need another.

2. Include an extra allowed letter.  
   Allowed extra letters: B, D, F, G, J, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

   Try adding B:  
   - “KNOBS” – not a word.  
   - “IONBS” – no.  
   - “KNOBS” – no.  

   Try D:  
   - “KNODS” – but O is in position 3 (from KNOIS feedback), but D is allowed.  
   - “KNODS” is 5 letters: K N O D S.  
     Check constraints:  
     - S is in 5 (matches).  
     - K, N, O, I must be present.  
     - I is missing here, so KNODS is invalid (must include I).

   Try F:  
   - “KNOFS” – no.  

   Try G:  
   - “KNOGS” – no.  

   Try M:  
   - “KNOMS” – no.  

   Try U:  
   - “KNOUS” – no.  

   Try V:  
   - “KNOVS” – no.  

   Try Y:  
   - “KNOYS” – no.  

   Try Z:  
   - “KNOZS” – no.  

3. Use the three letters K, I, O, N plus one new allowed letter in positions 1-4.

   Possible words:  
   - “IONKS” – but S is fixed at 5, and this would be 5 letters: I O N K S.  
     Check:  
     - S is in 5 (good).  
     - I is in 1 (allowed: 1, 4) – here 1.  
     - O is in 2 (allowed: 1, 4) – here 2.  
     - N is in 3 (allowed: 1, 4) – here 3.  
     - K is in 4 (allowed: 1, 2, 3, 4) – here 4.  
     - Letters used: I, O, N, K, S – all required letters are present.  
     - No forbidden letters.  
     - “IONKS” is a valid English word.

Therefore the next guess is “IONKS”.

Letters known to be present: I, O, N, K, S  
Letters ruled out: L, A, T, E, C, R, P, W, H, plus earlier excluded letters.

The remaining positions are 1 and 2.  
We must place I and O in those two slots in some order.

Possible words fitting _ _ N K S:

1. I O N K S  → “IONKS” already tried (and O was in position 2, marked –)  
2. O I N K S  → “OINKS” – not a valid English word.  
3. I N O K S  → “INOKS” – no.  
4. O N I K S  → “ONIKS” – no.  
5. D I N K S – D is allowed, but “DINKS” is not a word.  
6. D O N K S – “DONKS” is a valid word (meaning to hit or strike).

DONKS uses:
- D (new letter, allowed)  
- O in position 2 (but earlier O was marked – in position 2 in IONKS, so O cannot be in position 2 – thus O must be in position 1).  
- Therefore the word must be O _ N K S.

The only 5-letter word fitting O _ N K S is “OINKS” – but we already tried that and O was marked – in position 2, so O cannot be in position 2. Thus we must re-examine.

Wait, the word must be of the form _ _ N K S with I and O placed in positions 1 and 2. The only valid English word fitting this pattern is:

“DOINS” – no.  
“BOINK” – K is in 4, but B is allowed, but ends with K, not S.  
“DINGS” – S is fixed at 5, so “DINGS” is invalid (ends with S, but positions 1-4 are D, I, N, G – but S is at 5, so “DINGS” is 5 letters: D I N G S – but S is at 5, so “DINGS” is D I N G S – but the word must be _ _ N K S, so “DINGS” is D I N G S – fits _ _ N K S.

But wait, “DINGS” has S at position 5, so letters are D, I, N, G, S.  
Positions: 1-D, 2-I, 3-N, 4-G, 5-S.  
But we have S at 5 (good), N at 3 (good), K at 4 (good).

Thus the only possible word left is “DINGS”.
