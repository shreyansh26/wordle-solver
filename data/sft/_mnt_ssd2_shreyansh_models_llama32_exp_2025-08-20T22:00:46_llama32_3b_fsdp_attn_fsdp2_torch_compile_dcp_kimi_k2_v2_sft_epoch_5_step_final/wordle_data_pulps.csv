- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word.

Another excellent candidate is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a classic opening guess that has proven effective.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but not in the 4th position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S somewhere other than position 4.
2. Avoids A, R, O, E entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels not yet ruled out.

Good remaining vowels: I, U
Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, K, Y, W, V, etc.

I'll try a word with S, plus other common letters like T, I, N, L. A good candidate is ""STING"":
- S is in position 1 (not 4, so valid for feedback)
- Uses T, I, N, G which haven't been ruled out

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word (x):
A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G, M, K, Y

Letters that ARE in the word:
- U is in position 2 (✓).  
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from the feedback).  
  Therefore S must be in position 5.

So the secret word has the pattern:
_ U _ _ S

Remaining unused common letters (not yet ruled out):
B, C, D, F, H, J, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need three letters for positions 1, 3, 4 that are from the remaining pool.  
I’ll choose a word that uses common consonants and keeps the pattern _ U _ _ S.

A good candidate is “DUMPY” but Y is already ruled out.  
Next: “HUMPS” – but T is ruled out and we already know S is at the end.  
“LUNGS” – N and G are ruled out.  
“FUSIL” – I and L are allowed, but I is ruled out.  
“BULKS” – K is ruled out.  
“FUSKS” – K is ruled out.  
“PUSHS” – H and P are still allowed.  
“PUSHS” → P, U, S, H, S.  
But S is already fixed at position 5, so the last S would be duplicate and still valid.  
However, we only need one S at the end.  
Let’s try “PUSH” plus one more letter.  
Actually, we need a 5-letter word ending in S with U in position 2.  
A clean candidate is “FUSIL” but I is out.  
“DUSKY” – K and Y are out.  
“BUSKS” – K is out.  
“FUSKS” – K is out.  
“PUFFS” – F is allowed, but we need U in position 2.  
“PUFFS” has U in position 2 and uses P, F, F, S.  
But we don’t know about F yet.  
Let’s try “PUFFS”.  
Wait, that’s 5 letters: P U F F S.  
Positions: 1=P, 2=U, 3=F, 4=F, 5=S.  
This fits _ U _ _ S and only uses letters not yet ruled out (P, F, S).  
Let me verify: P, U, F, F, S. None of these are in the “not in word” list.  
So “PUFFS” is valid.

Another option is “DUFFS” (D, U, F, F, S) but D hasn’t been ruled out yet.  
Between “PUFFS” and “DUFFS”, both are equally valid.  
I’ll go with “DUFFS” because D is a common consonant we haven’t tested yet.

But wait, “DUFFS” has S in position 5, which is correct.  
However, “DUFFS” uses F twice.  
Let me pick a word with distinct letters.  
“CUPID” – I and D are out.  
“FUSIL” – I is out.  
“HUSKS” – K, S. K is out.  
“BUSHY” – Y is out.  
“BULKS” – K is out.  
“FUSKS” – K is out.  
“PUFFS” seems the best with distinct letters P and F.

Thus, the next guess is “PUFFS”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word.

Another excellent candidate is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a classic opening guess that has proven effective.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but not in the 4th position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S somewhere other than position 4.
2. Avoids A, R, O, E entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels not yet ruled out.

Good remaining vowels: I, U
Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, K, Y, W, V, etc.

I'll try a word with S, plus other common letters like T, I, N, L. A good candidate is ""STING"":
- S is in position 1 (not 4, so valid for feedback)
- Uses T, I, N, G which haven't been ruled out
- Avoids all excluded letters (A, R, O, E)

Guess 2: STING -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(x) N(x) G(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   - A, R, O, E are out.  
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. STING → S(-) T(x) I(x) N(x) G(x)  
   - S is still in the word but not in position 1.  
   - T, I, N, G are out.

So far we know:
- S must be in position 2, 3, or 5.  
- The remaining letters that have NOT been ruled out include:  
  B, C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus S).

We still need three more letters.  
I’ll pick a word that:
- Places S in position 3 (middle).  
- Uses other common, still-possible consonants and vowels (U is a vowel still allowed).  
- Avoids every letter already ruled out.

A good candidate is “MUSKY”:
- S is in position 3.  
- M, U, K, Y have not been ruled out.  
- All letters are distinct, giving maximum information.

If this fails, we’ll know more about M, U, K, Y.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word.

Another excellent candidate is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a classic opening guess that has proven effective.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but not in the 4th position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S somewhere other than position 4.
2. Avoids A, R, O, E entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels not yet ruled out.

Good remaining vowels: I, U
Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, K, Y, W, V, etc.

I'll try a word with S, plus other common letters like T, I, N, L. A good candidate is ""STING"":
- S is in position 1 (not 4, so valid for feedback)
- Uses T, I, N, G which haven't been ruled out
- Avoids all excluded letters (A, R, O, E)

<guess>STING</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STING -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(x) N(x) G(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   - A, R, O, E are out.  
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. STING → S(-) T(x) I(x) N(x) G(x)  
   - S is still in the word but not in position 1.  
   - T, I, N, G are out.

So far we know:
- S must be in position 2, 3, or 5.  
- The remaining letters that have NOT been ruled out include:  
  B, C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus S).

We still need three more letters.  
I’ll pick a word that:
- Places S in position 3 (middle).  
- Uses other common, still-possible consonants and vowels (U is a vowel still allowed).  
- Avoids every letter already ruled out.

A good candidate is “MUSKY”:
- S is in position 3.  
- M, U, K, Y have not been ruled out.  
- All letters are distinct, giving maximum information.

If this fails, we’ll know more about M, U, K, Y.

<guess>MUSKY</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STING -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(x) N(x) G(x)
Guess 3: MUSKY -> FEEDBACK: M(x) U(✓) S(-) K(x) Y(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word (x):
A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G, M, K, Y

Letters that ARE in the word:
- U is in position 2 (✓).  
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from the feedback).  
  Therefore S must be in position 5.

So the secret word has the pattern:
_ U _ _ S

Remaining unused common letters (not yet ruled out):
B, C, D, F, H, J, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need three letters for positions 1, 3, 4 that are from the remaining pool.  
I’ll choose a word that uses common consonants and keeps the pattern _ U _ _ S.

A good candidate is “DUMPY” but Y is already ruled out.  
Next: “HUMPS” – but T is ruled out and we already know S is at the end.  
“LUNGS” – N and G are ruled out.  
“FUSIL” – I and L are allowed, but I is ruled out.  
“BULKS” – K is ruled out.  
“FUSKS” – K is ruled out.  
“PUSHS” – H and P are still allowed.  
“PUSHS” → P, U, S, H, S.  
But S is already fixed at position 5, so the last S would be duplicate and still valid.  
However, we only need one S at the end.  
Let’s try “PUSH” plus one more letter.  
Actually, we need a 5-letter word ending in S with U in position 2.  
A clean candidate is “FUSIL” but I is out.  
“DUSKY” – K and Y are out.  
“BUSKS” – K is out.  
“FUSKS” – K is out.  
“PUFFS” – F is allowed, but we need U in position 2.  
“PUFFS” has U in position 2 and uses P, F, F, S.  
But we don’t know about F yet.  
Let’s try “PUFFS”.  
Wait, that’s 5 letters: P U F F S.  
Positions: 1=P, 2=U, 3=F, 4=F, 5=S.  
This fits _ U _ _ S and only uses letters not yet ruled out (P, F, S).  
Let me verify: P, U, F, F, S. None of these are in the “not in word” list.  
So “PUFFS” is valid.

Another option is “DUFFS” (D, U, F, F, S) but D hasn’t been ruled out yet.  
Between “PUFFS” and “DUFFS”, both are equally valid.  
I’ll go with “DUFFS” because D is a common consonant we haven’t tested yet.

But wait, “DUFFS” has S in position 5, which is correct.  
However, “DUFFS” uses F twice.  
Let me pick a word with distinct letters.  
“CUPID” – I and D are out.  
“FUSIL” – I is out.  
“HUSKS” – K, S. K is out.  
“BUSHY” – Y is out.  
“BULKS” – K is out.  
“FUSKS” – K is out.  
“PUFFS” seems the best with distinct letters P and F.

Thus, the next guess is “PUFFS”.

From the latest feedback on PURPS:
- P (pos 1) ✓
- U (pos 2) ✓
- R (pos 3) x → R is NOT in the word.
- P (pos 4) ✓ → the word has P in both positions 1 and 4.
- S (pos 5) ✓

So the secret word must be:
P U _ P S

We already know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G, M, K, Y, F, R
- Remaining candidate letters for position 3: B, C, D, H, J, L, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form P U _ P S.

Looking at the pattern:
- Position 3 must form a valid word when combined with P U and P S.

Possible words:
- P U B P S → “PUBPS” – not a valid English word.
- P U C P S → “PUCPS” – not valid.
- P U D P S → “PUDPS” – not valid.
- P U H P S → “PUHPS” – not valid.
- P U L P S → “PULPS” – not valid.
- P U C K S – K is out.
- P U B Y S – Y is out.
- P U D D Y S – Y is out.
- P U C C S – not valid.
- P U B B S – not valid.

The only valid English word fitting P U _ P S is “PUPYS” but Y is out.  
After scanning, the only valid word left is “PUPPS” – but double P might be expected, and it’s not common.

However, there’s another valid word: “PUDGY” but G and Y are out.

Wait, let’s re-examine the allowed letters more carefully.  
The feedback on PURPS ruled out R, but P itself is allowed to repeat (since we only know R is out, not P).

Actually, the word “PUPPS” is valid (though uncommon).  
But we can also consider “PUDGY” – but G and Y are out.

Upon deeper reflection, the only common 5-letter word fitting P U _ P S is “PUPPS”.  
Let me check if there are others: “PUBPS”, “PUDPS”, etc., are not words.

Therefore, the next logical guess is PUPPS.

But since PUPPS is the only valid form and we have P U _ P S, we must have a letter in position 3 that forms a valid word.  
After careful consideration, the only valid English word left is PUPPS.

However, before finalizing, let me double-check:  
Is there another word? Yes, “PUDGY” isn’t valid.  
“PULPS” isn’t.  
“PUCKS” – K out.  
“PUDDY” – Y out.  
“PUFFS” – F out.  
“PUGGS” – G out.  
“PULLS” – L is still allowed.  
“PULLS” is a valid word: P U L L S.  
But L hasn’t been ruled out, and we have P U _ P S.

Thus, the correct word must be PULLS.

Let me verify:
- P U L L S:
  - P (1) ✓ already match  
  - U (2) ✓ already match  
  - L (3) – not ruled out.  
  - L (4) – not ruled out.  
  - S (5) ✓ already match.  
  - No disallowed letters appear.

Therefore, the sixth and final guess is PULLS.
