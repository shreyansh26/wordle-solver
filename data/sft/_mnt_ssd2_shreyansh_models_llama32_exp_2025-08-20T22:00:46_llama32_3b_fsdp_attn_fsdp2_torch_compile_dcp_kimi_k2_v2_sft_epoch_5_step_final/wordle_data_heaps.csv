For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers slightly more common letters. I need to make sure it's a valid 5-letter word, which ""AROSE"" is.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, S, E (but in different positions than in AROSE).
- Does NOT contain R or O.

I need a new 5-letter word that uses A, S, E in positions different from their positions in AROSE, and avoids R and O entirely. 

Positions in AROSE:
1: A (-)
2: R (x)

I'll try a word that shifts those letters to new positions and fills the remaining spots with other common letters that haven't been ruled out. A good candidate is ""EASEL"" - it uses E, A, S in new positions and introduces L and E for new letters. However, EASEL uses E in position 1 which was not ruled out, but we need to ensure we're not using R or O.

Another option is ""SABLE"" - but this uses S in position 1 which was not ruled out, but we need to ensure we're not using R or O. However, SABLE uses B which hasn't been tested yet.

A better option might be ""STEAK"" - but this uses S in position 1 (ok), T (new), E in position 3 (was position 5), A in position 2 (was position 1), and K (new). This seems valid as it shifts all required letters to new positions and introduces new letters.

But let me think of a word that uses all three - A, S, E - in positions not yet ruled out. ""PEASE"" - but this uses P and E twice which might not be optimal.

Actually, ""SPEAK"" would be good - S in position 1 (not ruled out), P (new), E in position 3 (was 5), A in position 2 (was 1), and K (new). This covers all required letters in new positions.

But ""SPEAK"" might be too many new letters. Let's go with ""STEAK"" as it covers S, E, A in new positions and introduces T and K.

   - T and K are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, S, E.
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, O, T, K.
- Positions ruled out for each of A, S, E:
  – A cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
  – S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
  – E cannot be in positions 3 or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, S, E exactly once each.
- Does NOT contain R, O, T, K.
- Positions of A, S, E must respect the “cannot” rules above.

Remaining common consonants that haven’t been ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try to spread A, S, E into allowed positions:
- A can be in 2, 3, or 5.
- S can be in 2, 3, or 5.
- E can be in 1, 2, or 4.

A promising pattern is: E in 1, S in 2, A in 3 or 5, and two more consonants in the remaining slots.

Trying “EASEL” – but L is allowed, yet E is in 1 (ok), A in 3 (ok), S in 2 (ok), and we need one more consonant; EASEL has L but also an E in position 5 which is ruled out.

Next candidate: “BASEL” – but B is allowed, A in 2 (ok), S in 3 (ok), E in 4 (ok), L in 5 (ok). This respects all constraints: contains A, S, E; avoids R, O, T, K; positions of A, S, E are allowed.

Let me verify:
- BASEL: B A S E L
  – A is in position 2 (allowed: 2, 3, 5).
  – S is in position 3 (allowed: 2, 3, 5).

1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers slightly more common letters. I need to make sure it's a valid 5-letter word, which ""AROSE"" is.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, S, E (but in different positions than in AROSE).
- Does NOT contain R or O.

I need a new 5-letter word that uses A, S, E in positions different from their positions in AROSE, and avoids R and O entirely. 

Positions in AROSE:
1: A (-)
2: R (x)
3: O (x)
4: S (-)
5: E (-)

I'll try a word that shifts those letters to new positions and fills the remaining spots with other common letters that haven't been ruled out. A good candidate is ""EASEL"" - it uses E, A, S in new positions and introduces L and E for new letters. However, EASEL uses E in position 1 which was not ruled out, but we need to ensure we're not using R or O.

Another option is ""SABLE"" - but this uses S in position 1 which was not ruled out, but we need to ensure we're not using R or O. However, SABLE uses B which hasn't been tested yet.

A better option might be ""STEAK"" - but this uses S in position 1 (ok), T (new), E in position 3 (was position 5), A in position 2 (was position 1), and K (new). This seems valid as it shifts all required letters to new positions and introduces new letters.

But let me think of a word that uses all three - A, S, E - in positions not yet ruled out. ""PEASE"" - but this uses P and E twice which might not be optimal.

Actually, ""SPEAK"" would be good - S in position 1 (not ruled out), P (new), E in position 3 (was 5), A in position 2 (was 1), and K (new). This covers all required letters in new positions.

But ""SPEAK"" might be too many new letters. Let's go with ""STEAK"" as it covers S, E, A in new positions and introduces T and K.

Guess 2: STEAK -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) E(-) A(-) K(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - A is in the word, not in position 1.
   - R and O are not in the word at all.
   - S is in the word, not in position 4.
   - E is in the word, not in position 5.

2. STEAK → S(-) T(x) E(-) A(-) K(x)
   - S is in the word, not in position 1.
   - T and K are not in the word at all.
   - E is in the word, not in position 3.
   - A is in the word, not in position 4.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, S, E.
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, O, T, K.
- Positions ruled out for each of A, S, E:
  – A cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
  – S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
  – E cannot be in positions 3 or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, S, E exactly once each.
- Does NOT contain R, O, T, K.
- Positions of A, S, E must respect the “cannot” rules above.

Remaining common consonants that haven’t been ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try to spread A, S, E into allowed positions:
- A can be in 2, 3, or 5.
- S can be in 2, 3, or 5.
- E can be in 1, 2, or 4.

A promising pattern is: E in 1, S in 2, A in 3 or 5, and two more consonants in the remaining slots.

Trying “EASEL” – but L is allowed, yet E is in 1 (ok), A in 3 (ok), S in 2 (ok), and we need one more consonant; EASEL has L but also an E in position 5 which is ruled out.

Next candidate: “BASEL” – but B is allowed, A in 2 (ok), S in 3 (ok), E in 4 (ok), L in 5 (ok). This respects all constraints: contains A, S, E; avoids R, O, T, K; positions of A, S, E are allowed.

Let me verify:
- BASEL: B A S E L
  – A is in position 2 (allowed: 2, 3, 5).
  – S is in position 3 (allowed: 2, 3, 5).
  – E is in position 4 (allowed: 1, 2, 4).
  – Letters B, L are new and allowed.
  – No R, O, T, K.

This looks solid.

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   – A, S, E are in the word but in wrong positions.
   – R, O are not in the word.

2. STEAK → S(-) T(x) E(-) A(-) K(x)

3. BASEL → B(x) A(-) S(-) E(-) L(x)
   – A, S, E are in the word but in wrong positions.
   – B, L are not in the word.

So we now know:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, S, E.
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, O, T, K, B, L.
- Additional position constraints:
  – A cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4.
  – S cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4.
  – E cannot be in positions 3, 4, 5.

Therefore:
- A can only be in position 3 or 5.
- S can only be in position 3 or 5.
- E can only be in position 1 or 2.

We must place one A, one S, and one E in positions 1, 2, 3, 5, with the restrictions above.

Remaining consonants we haven’t ruled out: C, D, F, G, H, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try to construct a word:
- If E is in position 1, then S and A must fit into 3 and 5 (or 5 and 3) without violating their restrictions.
  – E _ _ _ _
  – S must be in 3 or 5; if 5, then A must be in 3 → E _ S _ A (but then A is in 5 which is allowed).
  – Valid word: E D S N A → “EDSNA” is invalid (not a real word).
  – Try E D S A _ → “EDSA_” – no valid word.
  – Try E N S A _ → “ENSAX” – no.
  – Try E N S _ A → “ENSA_” – nothing.

- If E is in position 2, then:
  – _ E _ _ _
  – A must be in 3 or 5.
  – S must be in 3 or 5.
  – Let’s try A in 3 and S in 5: _ E A _ S → “HEAPS” – H, P are allowed, and it’s a valid word.

Let’s check “HEAPS”:
- Letters: H, E, A, P, S.
- Contains A, S, E.
- No R, O, T, K, B, L.
- Positions:
  – E is in 2 (allowed: 1 or 2).
  – A is in 3 (allowed: 3 or 5).
  – S is in 5 (allowed: 3 or 5).

This fits all constraints.
