### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

From the feedback so far:

- A, R, O, S, E, U, T are all ruled out (marked “x”).
- N and I are in the word but in the wrong positions (marked “-”).
- Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So we know:
- The word ends with Y.
- It contains N and I, but N is not in position 2 and I is not in position 3.
- The remaining letters must come from the unused alphabet excluding A, R, O, S, E, U, T.

Let’s list the remaining consonants and vowels:
Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z
Vowels left: I (already known), plus others like Y (already placed), but we still need to place I somewhere else if needed.

We know positions 1-4 cannot contain A, R, O, S, E, U, T, and must include N and I somewhere.

A good next guess would place N and I in new positions while testing other common consonants. Let’s try “BLINY”:
- B: new consonant
- L: new consonant
- I: known vowel, now in position 3
- N: known letter, now in position 4
- Y: known to be in position 5

This tests new positions for I and N while introducing B and L.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means we need a completely new set of letters.  
I want a word that still uses common consonants and vowels so I can quickly narrow down possibilities.  
A good next choice is “UNITY”: it contains three vowels (U, I, Y) and two common consonants (N, T) that haven’t been ruled out.  
This will give us fresh information about a new batch of letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: UNITY -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) I(-) T(x) Y(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback so far:

- A, R, O, S, E, U, T are all ruled out (marked “x”).
- N and I are in the word but in the wrong positions (marked “-”).
- Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So we know:
- The word ends with Y.
- It contains N and I, but N is not in position 2 and I is not in position 3.
- The remaining letters must come from the unused alphabet excluding A, R, O, S, E, U, T.

Let’s list the remaining consonants and vowels:
Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z
Vowels left: I (already known), plus others like Y (already placed), but we still need to place I somewhere else if needed.

We know positions 1-4 cannot contain A, R, O, S, E, U, T, and must include N and I somewhere.

A good next guess would place N and I in new positions while testing other common consonants. Let’s try “BLINY”:
- B: new consonant
- L: new consonant
- I: known vowel, now in position 3
- N: known letter, now in position 4
- Y: known to be in position 5

This tests new positions for I and N while introducing B and L.

Guess 3: BLINY -> FEEDBACK: B(-) L(x) I(-) N(-) Y(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Current constraints:

1. Word ends with Y (position 5).
2. Contains N and I, but:
   - N is NOT in positions 2 or 4.
   - I is NOT in positions 3.
3. Letters ruled out so far: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L.
4. Letters still available: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus I and N.

We have:
- _ _ _ _ Y
- Must include I and N somewhere in positions 1-4, but:
  - I cannot be in position 3.
  - N cannot be in position 2 or 4.

Possible positions for I: 1, 2, or 4.
Possible positions for N: 1, 3, or 5 (but 5 is Y, so 1 or 3).

Let’s test placing N in position 1 and I in position 3: N _ I _ Y → but I cannot be in position 3, so this fails.

Test placing N in position 1 and I in position 2: N I _ _ Y → valid.
Test placing N in position 3 and I in position 1: I _ N _ Y → valid.

We need to choose a word that fits one of these patterns, uses only allowed letters, and tests new consonants. Let’s try “INNY”:
- I in position 1 (valid, since I can be anywhere except 3)
- N in position 2 (invalid, N cannot be in 2)
So “INNY” fails.

Try “CHINK”:
- C, H, K are new consonants.
- I in position 2 (valid).
- N in position 3 (valid).
- K in position 4, Y in 5.
But “CHINK” uses K, which is fine.

Another candidate: “PINNY”:
- P: new.
- I in position 2 (valid).
- N in position 3 (valid).
- N in position 4 (invalid, N cannot be in 4).
So “PINNY” fails.

- W: new.
- I in position 2 (valid).
- M: new.
- P: new.
- Y in 5 (correct).
But this lacks N, which we know must be in the word.

We must include N. So let’s try “DINGY”:
- D: new.
- I in position 2 (valid).
- N in position 3 (valid).
- G: new.
- Y in 5 (correct).
This fits all constraints: includes N and I, avoids ruled-out letters, and tests D, G.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means we need a completely new set of letters.  
I want a word that still uses common consonants and vowels so I can quickly narrow down possibilities.  
A good next choice is “UNITY”: it contains three vowels (U, I, Y) and two common consonants (N, T) that haven’t been ruled out.  
This will give us fresh information about a new batch of letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: UNITY -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) I(-) T(x) Y(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback so far:

- A, R, O, S, E, U, T are all ruled out (marked “x”).
- N and I are in the word but in the wrong positions (marked “-”).
- Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So we know:
- The word ends with Y.
- It contains N and I, but N is not in position 2 and I is not in position 3.
- The remaining letters must come from the unused alphabet excluding A, R, O, S, E, U, T.

Let’s list the remaining consonants and vowels:
Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z
Vowels left: I (already known), plus others like Y (already placed), but we still need to place I somewhere else if needed.

We know positions 1-4 cannot contain A, R, O, S, E, U, T, and must include N and I somewhere.

A good next guess would place N and I in new positions while testing other common consonants. Let’s try “BLINY”:
- B: new consonant
- L: new consonant
- I: known vowel, now in position 3
- N: known letter, now in position 4
- Y: known to be in position 5

This tests new positions for I and N while introducing B and L.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)

Guess 3: BLINY -> FEEDBACK: B(-) L(x) I(-) N(-) Y(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Current constraints:

1. Word ends with Y (position 5).
2. Contains N and I, but:
   - N is NOT in positions 2 or 4.
   - I is NOT in positions 3.
3. Letters ruled out so far: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L.
4. Letters still available: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus I and N.

We have:
- _ _ _ _ Y
- Must include I and N somewhere in positions 1-4, but:
  - I cannot be in position 3.
  - N cannot be in position 2 or 4.

Possible positions for I: 1, 2, or 4.
Possible positions for N: 1, 3, or 5 (but 5 is Y, so 1 or 3).

Let’s test placing N in position 1 and I in position 3: N _ I _ Y → but I cannot be in position 3, so this fails.

Test placing N in position 1 and I in position 2: N I _ _ Y → valid.
Test placing N in position 3 and I in position 1: I _ N _ Y → valid.

We need to choose a word that fits one of these patterns, uses only allowed letters, and tests new consonants. Let’s try “INNY”:
- I in position 1 (valid, since I can be anywhere except 3)
- N in position 2 (invalid, N cannot be in 2)
So “INNY” fails.

Try “CHINK”:
- C, H, K are new consonants.
- I in position 2 (valid).
- N in position 3 (valid).
- K in position 4, Y in 5.
But “CHINK” uses K, which is fine.

Another candidate: “PINNY”:
- P: new.
- I in position 2 (valid).
- N in position 3 (valid).
- N in position 4 (invalid, N cannot be in 4).
So “PINNY” fails.

Try “WIMPY”:
- W: new.
- I in position 2 (valid).
- M: new.
- P: new.
- Y in 5 (correct).
But this lacks N, which we know must be in the word.

We must include N. So let’s try “DINGY”:
- D: new.
- I in position 2 (valid).
- N in position 3 (valid).
- G: new.
- Y in 5 (correct).
This fits all constraints: includes N and I, avoids ruled-out letters, and tests D, G.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: UNITY -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) I(-) T(x) Y(✓)
Guess 3: BLINY -> FEEDBACK: B(-) L(x) I(-) N(-) Y(✓)
Guess 4: DINGY -> FEEDBACK: D(x) I(✓) N(-) G(x) Y(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the latest feedback:

- D is out (position 1).
- I is in position 2 and correct (✓).
- N is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- G is out (position 4).
- Y is correct in position 5.

So the pattern is now:
- Position 2: I
- Position 5: Y
- N must be in position 1 or 4 (cannot be 2,3,4,5)
- Positions 1,3,4 must use letters not yet ruled out (no A,R,O,S,E,U,T,L,D,G)

Available letters: B, C, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus N and the already fixed I and Y.

N must sit in position 1 or 4.

Option 1: N _ I _ Y
Option 2: _ _ I _ Y, but then N would have to be in position 4.

So possible patterns:
- N _ I _ Y
- _ _ I N Y

Let’s explore Option 1: N _ I _ Y
We need a consonant for position 3 that hasn’t been ruled out and isn’t already used in another position.
Available consonants: B, C, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Common consonants in this range: C, F, H, K, M, P, V, W.
Let’s pick H for position 3: N H I _ Y → need a consonant for position 4.
From remaining letters, let’s try M: N H I M Y → but M is available, so “NHIMY” isn’t a valid word.

Try C: N H I C Y → “NHIC” isn’t valid.

Try P: N H I P Y → “NHIPY” – no.

Try B: N H I B Y – “NHIBY” – no.

Try K: N H I K Y – “NHIKY” – no.

Let’s try Option 2: _ _ I N Y
Need consonants for positions 1 and 3.
Let’s try C and K:
- C in position 1
- K in position 3

Word: C K I N Y → “CKINY” – no.

Try M and K:
- M in position 1
- K in position 3
Word: M K I N Y – “MKINY” – no.

Try F and K:
- F in position 1
- K in position 3
Word: F K I N Y – “FKINY” – no.

Try B and K:
- B in position 1
- K in position 3
Word: B K I N Y – “BKINY” – no.

Try V and K:
- V in position 1
- K in position 3
Word: V K I N Y – “VKINY” – no.

Hmm, maybe we need a vowel in position 3 instead of consonant?
Wait, we already have I and Y, and N must be in 1 or 4.
So if N is in 1: N _ I _ Y
But then position 3 is I, which is fine.

Let’s try N I in positions 1 and 3:
Word: N I _ _ Y
Need consonants for positions 3 and 4.
Let’s try C and K:
N I C K Y – “NICKY” – valid word!

Let me check:
- N in 1 (allowed, since N can be in 1 or 4)
- I in 2 (correct)
- C in 3 (new, not ruled out)
- K in 4 (new, not ruled out)
- Y in 5 (correct)

“NICKY” fits all constraints.

Wait, let’s list real English words that fit N I _ _ Y:

- NINNY – but N is already in position 1 and we can’t have two N’s (would need two N’s, but we only have one N confirmed so far).
- NICKY – already tried, C and K ruled out.
- NIFTY – doesn’t end with Y.
- NIMBY – doesn’t fit.
- NIPSY – doesn’t fit.
- NIGMA – but A is ruled out.
- NINNY – valid word, uses N twice (position 1 and 3), ends with Y.

Check constraints:
- N is allowed to appear twice.
- Letters used: N (position 1 confirmed), I (position 2 confirmed), N (position 3), Y (position 5), and no C/K.
- All letters used are allowed (N, I, Y are confirmed; N is allowed twice).

So “NINNY” fits the pattern N I _ _ Y and only uses allowed letters.

Alternative check:
We haven’t used B, F, H, M, P, V, W yet. Let’s see if any of these form valid words:
- B: N I B _ Y – no common word
- F: N I F _ Y – no common word
- H: N I H _ Y – no common word
- M: N I M _ Y – “NIMMY” (invalid)
- P: N I P _ Y – no common word
- V: N I V _ Y – no common word
- W: N I W _ Y – no common word

- Letters used: N (position 1 confirmed), I (position 2 confirmed), N (position 3), Y (position 5), and no C/K.
- All letters used are allowed (N, I, Y are confirmed; N is allowed twice).

So “NINNY” fits the pattern N I _ _ Y and only uses allowed letters.

Alternative check:
We haven’t used B, F, H, M, P, V, W yet. Let’s see if any of these form valid words:
- B: N I B _ Y – no common word
- F: N I F _ Y – no common word
- H: N I H _ Y – no common word
- M: N I M _ Y – “NIMMY” (invalid)
- P: N I P _ Y – no common word
- V: N I V _ Y – no common word
- W: N I W _ Y – no common word

""NINNY"" seems the most plausible real word left.",Guess 6: NINNY -> FEEDBACK: N(✓) I(✓) N(-) N(-) Y(✓),FAIL
