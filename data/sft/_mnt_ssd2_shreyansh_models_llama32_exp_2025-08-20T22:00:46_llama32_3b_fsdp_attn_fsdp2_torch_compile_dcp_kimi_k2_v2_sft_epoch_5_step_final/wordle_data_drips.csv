For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers slightly more common letters. I need to make sure it's a valid 5-letter word, which ""AROSE"" is.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- R is in the word and in the correct 2nd position.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so S is not in position 4).
- A, O, E are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- _ R _ _ _
- S is somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 5.
- Letters to avoid: A, O, E.

I want a word that:
1. Keeps R in position 2.
2. Includes S but not in position 4.
3. Uses new common letters to test.

Good candidates: D R I S _ , F R I S _ , C R I S _ , etc.  
""DRIPS"" is a valid 5-letter word, keeps R in position 2, and S in position 5 (a new position to test). It also introduces new letters D, I, P.
