1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, while maximizing the information we gain from the feedback.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" which covers very common letters including S, L, A, T, E. This is also highly effective at testing multiple frequent letters at once.

- Letters definitely IN the word: E, O, N.
- E cannot be in position 5.

Remaining vowels: I, U (since A is out and we already have O, E).

Let’s try to construct a word that satisfies these constraints. A good candidate is “DOING”:
- D, I, G are new letters.
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since it can’t be in 3).
- N is in position 3 (allowed, since it can’t be in 4).
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since it can’t be in 5).
- I is a new vowel.

Checking: “DOING” is a valid 5-letter word, contains E, O, N, and only uses allowed letters.

Alternative quick check: “PONED” is invalid (not a word). “GONER” is valid but uses R (already excluded). “HONEY” is valid and uses H, O, N, E, Y. However, it uses Y, which is less common. “MONEY” is also valid but uses M, O, N, E, Y. Between “DOING” and “MONEY”, “DOING” tests D, I, G – all new and common.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, while maximizing the information we gain from the feedback.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" which covers very common letters including S, L, A, T, E. This is also highly effective at testing multiple frequent letters at once.

Between these two, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess because it tests the letters S, L, A, T, E - all of which are very common in English words, and it has a good mix of vowels and consonants. This should give us valuable information about which of these common letters are in the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E, but NOT in the 5th position.
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T at all.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses E somewhere except the last slot.
2. Avoids S, L, A, T.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants to test: R, N, C, H, M, D, G, B, F, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels to test: I, O, U.

A strong next guess would be ""CRONE"":
- C, R, O, N are all new letters not yet tested.
- E is moved to the 4th position (safe since it can't be last).
- If any of C, R, O, N are present, we'll get good information; if they're not, we'll know to avoid them.

Guess 2: CRONE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) O(-) N(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 – SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are not in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

Round 2 – CRONE:
- C, R are not in the word (x).
- O is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (-).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

Known facts so far:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, R.
- Letters definitely IN the word: E, O, N.
- E cannot be in position 5.
- O cannot be in position 3.
- N cannot be in position 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains E, O, N (each once).
2. Places E somewhere other than position 5.
3. Places O somewhere other than position 3.
4. Places N somewhere other than position 4.
5. Uses only letters from the remaining pool (avoid S, L, A, T, C, R).

Remaining common consonants: D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: I, U (since A is out and we already have O, E).

Let’s try to construct a word that satisfies these constraints. A good candidate is “DOING”:
- D, I, G are new letters.
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since it can’t be in 3).
- N is in position 3 (allowed, since it can’t be in 4).
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since it can’t be in 5).
- I is a new vowel.

Checking: “DOING” is a valid 5-letter word, contains E, O, N, and only uses allowed letters.

Alternative quick check: “PONED” is invalid (not a word). “GONER” is valid but uses R (already excluded). “HONEY” is valid and uses H, O, N, E, Y. However, it uses Y, which is less common. “MONEY” is also valid but uses M, O, N, E, Y. Between “DOING” and “MONEY”, “DOING” tests D, I, G – all new and common.

So I’ll go with “DOING”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, while maximizing the information we gain from the feedback.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" which covers very common letters including S, L, A, T, E. This is also highly effective at testing multiple frequent letters at once.

Between these two, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess because it tests the letters S, L, A, T, E - all of which are very common in English words, and it has a good mix of vowels and consonants. This should give us valuable information about which of these common letters are in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E, but NOT in the 5th position.
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T at all.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses E somewhere except the last slot.
2. Avoids S, L, A, T.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants to test: R, N, C, H, M, D, G, B, F, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels to test: I, O, U.

A strong next guess would be ""CRONE"":
- C, R, O, N are all new letters not yet tested.
- E is moved to the 4th position (safe since it can't be last).
- If any of C, R, O, N are present, we'll get good information; if they're not, we'll know to avoid them.

""CRONE"" is a valid 5-letter word that meets all constraints.

- Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, R.
- Letters definitely IN the word: E, O, N.
- E cannot be in position 5.
- O cannot be in position 3.
- N cannot be in position 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains E, O, N (each once).
2. Places E somewhere other than position 5.
3. Places O somewhere other than position 3.
4. Places N somewhere other than position 4.
5. Uses only letters from the remaining pool (avoid S, L, A, T, C, R).

Remaining common consonants: D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: I, U (since A is out and we already have O, E).

Let’s try to construct a word that satisfies these constraints. A good candidate is “DOING”:
- D, I, G are new letters.
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since it can’t be in 3).
- N is in position 3 (allowed, since it can’t be in 4).
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since it can’t be in 5).
- I is a new vowel.

Checking: “DOING” is a valid 5-letter word, contains E, O, N, and only uses allowed letters.

Alternative quick check: “PONED” is invalid (not a word). “GONER” is valid but uses R (already excluded). “HONEY” is valid and uses H, O, N, E, Y. However, it uses Y, which is less common. “MONEY” is also valid but uses M, O, N, E, Y. Between “DOING” and “MONEY”, “DOING” tests D, I, G – all new and common.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, while maximizing the information we gain from the feedback.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" which covers very common letters including S, L, A, T, E. This is also highly effective at testing multiple frequent letters at once.

Between these two, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess because it tests the letters S, L, A, T, E - all of which are very common in English words, and it has a good mix of vowels and consonants. This should give us valuable information about which of these common letters are in the secret word.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E, but NOT in the 5th position.
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T at all.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses E somewhere except the last slot.
2. Avoids S, L, A, T.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants to test: R, N, C, H, M, D, G, B, F, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels to test: I, O, U.

A strong next guess would be ""CRONE"":
- C, R, O, N are all new letters not yet tested.
- E is moved to the 4th position (safe since it can't be last).
- If any of C, R, O, N are present, we'll get good information; if they're not, we'll know to avoid them.

""CRONE"" is a valid 5-letter word that meets all constraints.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: CRONE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) O(-) N(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 – SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are not in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

Round 2 – CRONE:
- C, R are not in the word (x).
- O is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (-).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

Known facts so far:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, R.
- Letters definitely IN the word: E, O, N.
- E cannot be in position 5.
- O cannot be in position 3.
- N cannot be in position 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains E, O, N (each once).
2. Places E somewhere other than position 5.
3. Places O somewhere other than position 3.
4. Places N somewhere other than position 4.
5. Uses only letters from the remaining pool (avoid S, L, A, T, C, R).

Remaining common consonants: D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: I, U (since A is out and we already have O, E).

Let’s try to construct a word that satisfies these constraints. A good candidate is “DOING”:
- D, I, G are new letters.
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since it can’t be in 3).
- N is in position 3 (allowed, since it can’t be in 4).
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since it can’t be in 5).
- I is a new vowel.

Checking: “DOING” is a valid 5-letter word, contains E, O, N, and only uses allowed letters.

Alternative quick check: “PONED” is invalid (not a word). “GONER” is valid but uses R (already excluded). “HONEY” is valid and uses H, O, N, E, Y. However, it uses Y, which is less common. “MONEY” is also valid but uses M, O, N, E, Y. Between “DOING” and “MONEY”, “DOING” tests D, I, G – all new and common.

So I’ll go with “DOING”.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 3: DOING -> FEEDBACK: D(x) O(✓) I(x) N(-) G(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From all feedback so far:

1. Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, R, D, I, G.
2. Letters definitely IN the word: O (now known to be in position 2), E, N.
3. Positions already fixed:
   - Position 2 = O
4. Positions still unknown: 1, 3, 4, 5.
5. Constraints on the remaining letters:
   - E must appear somewhere (not position 5).
   - N must appear somewhere (not position 4).

So the word looks like: _ O _ _ _
with the set {E, N} among the blanks.

Valid letters left to try (common ones): B, F, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

I need a real 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2.
- Contains E and N somewhere in the remaining slots.
- Uses only allowed letters.

Candidate words:
- BONEY  – B, O, N, E, Y  (B, Y unused so far)
- MONEY  – M, O, N, E, Y  (M, Y unused)
- HONEY  – H, O, N, E, Y  (H, Y unused)
- PONED  – P, O, N, E, D  – D is already excluded
- FOYER  – uses R (excluded)

Among these, “MONEY” looks good: M and Y are new and common, N and E are placed in allowable positions, and O is locked in position 2.

Let me verify:
- MONEY: M(1) O(2) N(3) E(4) Y(5)
- Constraints:
  – O is in position 2 (matches ✓)
  – E is in position 4 (not 5, matches (-) from earlier)
  – N is in position 3 (not 4, matches (-) from earlier)
  – Letters M, Y are new and allowed
  – No excluded letters (S, L, A, T, C, R, D, I, G) are used

Therefore, MONEY is a strong next guess.

Guess 4: MONEY -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓) Y(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the latest feedback:

So we now know the exact word:

We now know the exact pattern: _ O N E Y

Letters locked in place:

- Position 5: Y

Letters already ruled out for position 1: S, L, A, T, C, R, D, I, G, M, H

Valid 5-letter words that start with an unused, common consonant:
- BONEY  – B is allowed
- PONEY  – P is allowed
- WONEY  – W is allowed
- FONEY  – F is allowed (though “foney” is uncommon)
- KONEY  – K is allowed
- VONEY  – V is allowed
- ZONEY  – Z is allowed (though rare)

Among these, “BONEY” is the most common English word. Since B is still allowed, BONEY is the only logical remaining candidate.
