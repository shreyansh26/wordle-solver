### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I. 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains several common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and can help eliminate or confirm many letters at once. Another good option is ""CRANE"" or ""RAISE"". 

I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it includes R, A, I, S, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give me good information about which letters are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R(x) – R is NOT in the word.
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- I(x) – I is NOT in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (was position 4).
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (was position 5).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E.
- Does NOT contain R, A, or I.
- The S is NOT in position 4, and the E is NOT in position 5.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S and E (both must appear once).
2. Does NOT use R, A, or I.
3. Puts S somewhere other than position 4.
4. Puts E somewhere other than position 5.

Common letters left to try: T, O, N, L, C, U, D, etc.

A good candidate is ""STONE"":
- Uses S and E.
- Uses T, O, N (none of R, A, I).
- S is in position 1 (not 4) – valid.
- E is in position 5 (but feedback says E is NOT in position 5). So ""STONE"" is invalid.

Next candidate: ""SENTO"":
- Uses S, E, N, T, O.
- S is in position 1 (valid).
- E is in position 2 (valid – wasn't in position 5).
- Does not use R, A, I.
- All letters are unique, maximizing information.

Another candidate: ""SHEET"":
- Uses S, E, H, E, T.
- S in position 1 (valid).
- E in positions 2 and 4 (valid – wasn't in position 5).
- Does not use R, A, I.
- But ""SHEET"" has two E's; we only know one E exists. Still, it's valid to guess words with repeated letters, and it tests H which is common.

Another option: ""SLEPT"":
- Uses S, L, E, P, T.
- S in position 1 (valid).
- E in position 3 (valid).
- Uses new letters L, P, T.
- Does not use R, A, I.

""SLEPT"" seems good – common letters, tests new positions for S and E, and introduces L, P, T.

But let's also consider ""SPOKE"":
- Uses S, P, O, K, E.
- S in position 1 (valid).
- E in position 5 (invalid – feedback says E is NOT in position 5). So ""SPOKE"" is out.

""SNEEK"":
- Uses S, N, E, E, K.
- S in position 1 (valid).
- E in positions 3 and 4 (valid).
- Uses N, K (new letters).
- Does not use R, A, I.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
   - R, A, I are not in the word at all.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. SLEPT → S(-) L(✓) E(-) P(x) T(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - L is in the word and in position 2.
   - E is in the word but not in position 3.
   - P and T are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ L _ _ _
- Must contain S (not in pos 1 or 4) and E (not in pos 3 or 5).
- Must not contain R, A, I, P, T.

Possible positions for S: 3, 5  
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 4 (but position 2 is L, so 1 or 4)

Let’s list 5-letter words that fit _ L _ _ _ and contain both S and E, with no R, A, I, P, T.

Candidates:
- GLYPH – no E, no S → invalid
- BLOKE – has B, L, O, K, E → but S is missing
- SLOPE – has S, L, O, P, E → but P is invalid
- SLEEK – has S, L, E, E, K → two E’s, but we only know one E exists; still valid, tests K
- SLEEP – has S, L, E, E, P → P is invalid
- SLEDGE – D is okay, but G is okay; has S, L, E, D, G → tests D, G
- SWEET – T is invalid
- SLEPT already tried
- SKEEL – K, E, L; but L is fixed at pos 2, so K would be pos 3, E pos 4 → but we don’t know if K is allowed yet

Best simple candidate: SLEEK (only uses S and E, L is fixed, K is new)
But SLEEK has two E’s – possible but uncertain.

Another candidate: SLEDGE (S, L, E, D, G) – all new letters, fits constraints.

Let’s pick SLEDGE.

Check constraints:
- S in position 1 – wait, feedback says S is not in position 1 (from SLEPT). So SLEDGE is invalid.

Re-evaluate: S must be in 3 or 5, E in 1 or 4.

Case 1: S in 3, E in 1 → E L S _ _
   Candidate: ELSIE – but I is invalid
   Candidate: ELSIN – but I is invalid
   Candidate: ELSIE – invalid I

Case 2: S in 5, E in 1 or 4 → E L _ _ S or _ L _ E S
   Candidate: ELBOW – but O, B, W allowed
   Candidate: ELDER – but R is invalid

But ""FLUES"" has U and F – okay to test.

However, ""FLUES"" might be too obscure.

 simpler: ""BLEED"" – but D, B, L, E, E → but L must be in 2, and BLEED has L in 3 → invalid.

Another simple: ""SLEEK"" – but has two E’s.

Best simple valid word: ""SLEEK"" or ""SLEDGE"" already ruled out.

Re-examine: _ L _ _ _ with S in 3 or 5, E in 1 or 4.

If S is in 3, E must be in 1 or 4:
- E L S _ _ → ELS... need valid word: ELSIE (invalid I), ELSAN (A invalid), ELBOW (but W is allowed)
- _ L S E _ → _ L S E _ → BLASE (A invalid), CLASE (A invalid), FLUES (U, F allowed)

Actually, ""FLUES"" is valid (plural of fuze), but rare.

Better: ""ELBOW"" – but O, B, W allowed, L in 2 (✓), E in 1 (allowed), S in 3 (allowed), O, B, W new.

But ""ELBOW"" has S in 3 (allowed), E in 1 (allowed), L in 2 (✓), B, O, W new.

This seems solid.

Let’s lock it in: ELBOW.

Check constraints:
- L is in 2 (✓ from SLEPT)
- E is in 1 (allowed)
- S is in 3 (allowed)
- No R, A, I, P, T
- Uses new letters B, O, W.

Perfect.

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 20 Aug 2025

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I. 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains several common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and can help eliminate or confirm many letters at once. Another good option is ""CRANE"" or ""RAISE"". 

I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it includes R, A, I, S, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give me good information about which letters are present in the secret word.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R(x) – R is NOT in the word.
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- I(x) – I is NOT in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (was position 4).
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (was position 5).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E.
- Does NOT contain R, A, or I.
- The S is NOT in position 4, and the E is NOT in position 5.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S and E (both must appear once).
2. Does NOT use R, A, or I.
3. Puts S somewhere other than position 4.
4. Puts E somewhere other than position 5.

Common letters left to try: T, O, N, L, C, U, D, etc.

A good candidate is ""STONE"":
- Uses S and E.
- Uses T, O, N (none of R, A, I).
- S is in position 1 (not 4) – valid.
- E is in position 5 (but feedback says E is NOT in position 5). So ""STONE"" is invalid.

Next candidate: ""SENTO"":
- Uses S, E, N, T, O.
- S is in position 1 (valid).
- E is in position 2 (valid – wasn't in position 5).
- Does not use R, A, I.
- All letters are unique, maximizing information.

Another candidate: ""SHEET"":
- Uses S, E, H, E, T.
- S in position 1 (valid).
- E in positions 2 and 4 (valid – wasn't in position 5).
- Does not use R, A, I.
- But ""SHEET"" has two E's; we only know one E exists. Still, it's valid to guess words with repeated letters, and it tests H which is common.

Another option: ""SLEPT"":
- Uses S, L, E, P, T.
- S in position 1 (valid).
- E in position 3 (valid).
- Uses new letters L, P, T.
- Does not use R, A, I.

""SLEPT"" seems good – common letters, tests new positions for S and E, and introduces L, P, T.

But let's also consider ""SPOKE"":
- Uses S, P, O, K, E.
- S in position 1 (valid).
- E in position 5 (invalid – feedback says E is NOT in position 5). So ""SPOKE"" is out.

""SNEEK"":
- Uses S, N, E, E, K.
- S in position 1 (valid).
- E in positions 3 and 4 (valid).
- Uses N, K (new letters).
- Does not use R, A, I.

Between ""SLEPT"" and ""SNEEK"", ""SLEPT"" is more common and tests more frequent letters (T vs N, K).

I'll go with ""SLEPT"".

<guess>SLEPT</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: SLEPT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(✓) E(-) P(x) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
   - R, A, I are not in the word at all.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. SLEPT → S(-) L(✓) E(-) P(x) T(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - L is in the word and in position 2.
   - E is in the word but not in position 3.
   - P and T are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ L _ _ _
- Must contain S (not in pos 1 or 4) and E (not in pos 3 or 5).
- Must not contain R, A, I, P, T.

Possible positions for S: 3, 5  
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 4 (but position 2 is L, so 1 or 4)

Let’s list 5-letter words that fit _ L _ _ _ and contain both S and E, with no R, A, I, P, T.

Candidates:
- GLYPH – no E, no S → invalid
- BLOKE – has B, L, O, K, E → but S is missing
- SLOPE – has S, L, O, P, E → but P is invalid
- SLEEK – has S, L, E, E, K → two E’s, but we only know one E exists; still valid, tests K
- SLEEP – has S, L, E, E, P → P is invalid
- SLEDGE – D is okay, but G is okay; has S, L, E, D, G → tests D, G
- SWEET – T is invalid
- SLEPT already tried
- SKEEL – K, E, L; but L is fixed at pos 2, so K would be pos 3, E pos 4 → but we don’t know if K is allowed yet

Best simple candidate: SLEEK (only uses S and E, L is fixed, K is new)
But SLEEK has two E’s – possible but uncertain.

Another candidate: SLEDGE (S, L, E, D, G) – all new letters, fits constraints.

Let’s pick SLEDGE.

Check constraints:
- S in position 1 – wait, feedback says S is not in position 1 (from SLEPT). So SLEDGE is invalid.

Re-evaluate: S must be in 3 or 5, E in 1 or 4.

Case 1: S in 3, E in 1 → E L S _ _
   Candidate: ELSIE – but I is invalid
   Candidate: ELSIN – but I is invalid
   Candidate: ELSIE – invalid I

Case 2: S in 5, E in 1 or 4 → E L _ _ S or _ L _ E S
   Candidate: ELBOW – but O, B, W allowed
   Candidate: ELDER – but R is invalid
   Candidate: ELECS – but C, S allowed
   Candidate: ELECS – but S is in 5 (ok), E in 1 (ok), L in 2 (✓), C and S new letters.

But ELECS has S in 5 (valid), E in 1 (valid), L in 2 (✓), C and S new.

Another candidate: BELLS – but S in 5 (ok), E in 2 (but L must be in 2) → invalid.

Best fit so far: ELECS.

Let’s verify:
- E in 1 (allowed), L in 2 (✓), E in 3 (but we know E is not in 3 from SLEPT feedback) → invalid.

Next candidate: ELSIE – but I is invalid.

Next: S in 3, E in 4 → _ L S E _
   Candidate: BLASE – but A is invalid
   Candidate: CLASE – but A is invalid
   Candidate: FLUES – but U, F new, but S in 3 (ok), E in 4 (ok), L in 2 (✓), U, F new.

But ""FLUES"" has U and F – okay to test.

However, ""FLUES"" might be too obscure.

 simpler: ""BLEED"" – but D, B, L, E, E → but L must be in 2, and BLEED has L in 3 → invalid.

Another simple: ""SLEEK"" – but has two E’s.

Best simple valid word: ""SLEEK"" or ""SLEDGE"" already ruled out.

Re-examine: _ L _ _ _ with S in 3 or 5, E in 1 or 4.

If S is in 3, E must be in 1 or 4:
- E L S _ _ → ELS... need valid word: ELSIE (invalid I), ELSAN (A invalid), ELBOW (but W is allowed)
- _ L S E _ → _ L S E _ → BLASE (A invalid), CLASE (A invalid), FLUES (U, F allowed)

Actually, ""FLUES"" is valid (plural of fuze), but rare.

Better: ""ELBOW"" – but O, B, W allowed, L in 2 (✓), E in 1 (allowed), S in 3 (allowed), O, B, W new.

But ""ELBOW"" has S in 3 (allowed), E in 1 (allowed), L in 2 (✓), B, O, W new.

This seems solid.

Let’s lock it in: ELBOW.

Check constraints:
- L is in 2 (✓ from SLEPT)
- E is in 1 (allowed)
- S is in 3 (allowed)
- No R, A, I, P, T
- Uses new letters B, O, W.

Perfect.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I. 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains several common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and can help eliminate or confirm many letters at once. Another good option is ""CRANE"" or ""RAISE"". 

I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it includes R, A, I, S, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give me good information about which letters are present in the secret word.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R(x) – R is NOT in the word.
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- I(x) – I is NOT in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (was position 4).
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (was position 5).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E.
- Does NOT contain R, A, or I.
- The S is NOT in position 4, and the E is NOT in position 5.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S and E (both must appear once).
2. Does NOT use R, A, or I.
3. Puts S somewhere other than position 4.
4. Puts E somewhere other than position 5.

Common letters left to try: T, O, N, L, C, U, D, etc.

A good candidate is ""STONE"":
- Uses S and E.
- Uses T, O, N (none of R, A, I).
- S is in position 1 (not 4) – valid.
- E is in position 5 (but feedback says E is NOT in position 5). So ""STONE"" is invalid.

Next candidate: ""SENTO"":
- Uses S, E, N, T, O.
- S is in position 1 (valid).
- E is in position 2 (valid – wasn't in position 5).
- Does not use R, A, I.
- All letters are unique, maximizing information.

Another candidate: ""SHEET"":
- Uses S, E, H, E, T.
- S in position 1 (valid).
- E in positions 2 and 4 (valid – wasn't in position 5).
- Does not use R, A, I.
- But ""SHEET"" has two E's; we only know one E exists. Still, it's valid to guess words with repeated letters, and it tests H which is common.

Another option: ""SLEPT"":
- Uses S, L, E, P, T.
- S in position 1 (valid).
- E in position 3 (valid).
- Uses new letters L, P, T.
- Does not use R, A, I.

""SLEPT"" seems good – common letters, tests new positions for S and E, and introduces L, P, T.

But let's also consider ""SPOKE"":
- Uses S, P, O, K, E.
- S in position 1 (valid).
- E in position 5 (invalid – feedback says E is NOT in position 5). So ""SPOKE"" is out.

""SNEEK"":
- Uses S, N, E, E, K.
- S in position 1 (valid).
- E in positions 3 and 4 (valid).
- Uses N, K (new letters).
- Does not use R, A, I.

Between ""SLEPT"" and ""SNEEK"", ""SLEPT"" is more common and tests more frequent letters (T vs N, K).

I'll go with ""SLEPT"".

<guess>SLEPT</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: SLEPT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(✓) E(-) P(x) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
   - R, A, I are not in the word at all.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. SLEPT → S(-) L(✓) E(-) P(x) T(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - L is in the word and in position 2.
   - E is in the word but not in position 3.
   - P and T are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ L _ _ _
- Must contain S (not in pos 1 or 4) and E (not in pos 3 or 5).
- Must not contain R, A, I, P, T.

Possible positions for S: 3, 5  
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 4 (but position 2 is L, so 1 or 4)

Let’s list 5-letter words that fit _ L _ _ _ and contain both S and E, with no R, A, I, P, T.

Candidates:
- GLYPH – no E, no S → invalid
- BLOKE – has B, L, O, K, E → but S is missing
- SLOPE – has S, L, O, P, E → but P is invalid
- SLEEK – has S, L, E, E, K → two E’s, but we only know one E exists; still valid, tests K
- SLEEP – has S, L, E, E, P → P is invalid
- SLEDGE – D is okay, but G is okay; has S, L, E, D, G → tests D, G
- SWEET – T is invalid
- SLEPT already tried
- SKEEL – K, E, L; but L is fixed at pos 2, so K would be pos 3, E pos 4 → but we don’t know if K is allowed yet

Best simple candidate: SLEEK (only uses S and E, L is fixed, K is new)
But SLEEK has two E’s – possible but uncertain.

Another candidate: SLEDGE (S, L, E, D, G) – all new letters, fits constraints.

Let’s pick SLEDGE.

Check constraints:
- S in position 1 – wait, feedback says S is not in position 1 (from SLEPT). So SLEDGE is invalid.

Re-evaluate: S must be in 3 or 5, E in 1 or 4.

Case 1: S in 3, E in 1 → E L S _ _
   Candidate: ELSIE – but I is invalid
   Candidate: ELSIN – but I is invalid
   Candidate: ELSIE – invalid I

Case 2: S in 5, E in 1 or 4 → E L _ _ S or _ L _ E S
   Candidate: ELBOW – but O, B, W allowed
   Candidate: ELDER – but R is invalid
   Candidate: ELECS – but C, S allowed
   Candidate: ELECS – but S is in 5 (ok), E in 1 (ok), L in 2 (✓), C and S new letters.

But ELECS has S in 5 (valid), E in 1 (valid), L in 2 (✓), C and S new.

Another candidate: BELLS – but S in 5 (ok), E in 2 (but L must be in 2) → invalid.

Best fit so far: ELECS.

Let’s verify:
- E in 1 (allowed), L in 2 (✓), E in 3 (but we know E is not in 3 from SLEPT feedback) → invalid.

Next candidate: ELSIE – but I is invalid.

Next: S in 3, E in 4 → _ L S E _
   Candidate: BLASE – but A is invalid
   Candidate: CLASE – but A is invalid
   Candidate: FLUES – but U, F new, but S in 3 (ok), E in 4 (ok), L in 2 (✓), U, F new.

But ""FLUES"" has U and F – okay to test.

However, ""FLUES"" might be too obscure.

 simpler: ""BLEED"" – but D, B, L, E, E → but L must be in 2, and BLEED has L in 3 → invalid.

Another simple: ""SLEEK"" – but has two E’s.

Best simple valid word: ""SLEEK"" or ""SLEDGE"" already ruled out.

Re-examine: _ L _ _ _ with S in 3 or 5, E in 1 or 4.

If S is in 3, E must be in 1 or 4:
- E L S _ _ → ELS... need valid word: ELSIE (invalid I), ELSAN (A invalid), ELBOW (but W is allowed)
- _ L S E _ → _ L S E _ → BLASE (A invalid), CLASE (A invalid), FLUES (U, F allowed)

Actually, ""FLUES"" is valid (plural of fuze), but rare.

Better: ""ELBOW"" – but O, B, W allowed, L in 2 (✓), E in 1 (allowed), S in 3 (allowed), O, B, W new.

But ""ELBOW"" has S in 3 (allowed), E in 1 (allowed), L in 2 (✓), B, O, W new.

This seems solid.

Let’s lock it in: ELBOW.

Check constraints:
- L is in 2 (✓ from SLEPT)
- E is in 1 (allowed)
- S is in 3 (allowed)
- No R, A, I, P, T
- Uses new letters B, O, W.

Perfect.

From the latest feedback on CLUES:
- C(x) – C is NOT in the word.
- L(✓) – L is in position 2 (already known).
- U(x) – U is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in position 4 (now fixed).
- S(✓) – S is in position 5 (now fixed).

So the word pattern is now:
_ L _ E S

Letters we have ruled out completely so far:
R, A, I, P, T, B, W, C, U

Letters we still know nothing about in the two blank positions (positions 1 and 3):
From the English alphabet, the letters not yet tested (and not ruled out) include: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, V, Y, Z.

We also have to consider that some letters may have been implicitly confirmed: for example, the fact that S and E are in the word and placed correctly implies that the remaining letters must be from the allowed set.

Looking for common 5-letter words matching _ L _ E S with letters only from the allowed set:

Possible first letters (position 1):
D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, V, Y, Z

Possible third letters (position 3):
From the above list, common consonants that pair well with L and make a valid word:

- D and G: D L G E S → ""DLGES"" – not a word
- F and G: F L G E S → ""FLGES"" – not a word
- H and G: H L G E S → ""HLGES"" – not a word
- N and G: N L G E S → ""NLGES"" – not a word
- M and G: M L G E S → ""MLGES"" – not a word
- N and D: N L D E S → ""NLDES"" – not a word
- O and G: O L G E S → ""OLGES"" – not a word
- V and G: V L G E S → ""VLGES"" – not a word
- Y and G: Y L G E S → ""YLGES"" – not a word
- D and O: D L O E S → ""DLOES"" – not a word
- F and O: F L O E S → ""FLOES"" – archaic but valid (plural of ""flos"" – a botanical term)

But ""FLOES"" uses O in position 3, which has not been ruled out.

Wait, let's list actual dictionary words:

- ""FLUES"" – invalid (U ruled out)
- ""FLIES"" – I is ruled out
- ""FLOES"" – valid (botany term)
- ""GLOES"" – not common
- ""SLOES"" – S already used in 5
- ""DLOES"" – not a word

The only common valid word left is ""FLOES"".

Check constraints:
- Pattern: _ L O E S
- Letters used: F, L, O, E, S
- All letters are from the allowed set (F, L, O, E, S – none of the banned letters)
- L in 2 (✓), O is new, E in 4 (✓), S in 5 (✓)

Therefore, ""FLOES"" is the logical next guess.
