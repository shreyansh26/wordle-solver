For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

But “SOUND” has S in 1 and O in 3, no forbidden letters.  

Let me go with “SOUND” as it’s common and fits the constraints.

<guess>SOUND</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
   - O is fixed in position 3.
   - S is somewhere in the word but not position 4.
   - A, R, E are not in the word.

2. SOUND → S(✓) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)
   - S is now fixed in position 1.
   - O is in the word but not in position 2 (which we already knew it was in position 3).
   - U, N, D are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: S _ O _ _
- Letters not in the word: A, R, E, U, N, D
- S is locked in position 1.
- O is locked in position 3.

Remaining vowels to consider: I, Y (A, E, U already out).
Remaining common consonants: B, C, F, G, H, L, M, P, T, W, etc.

We need to fill positions 2 and 5 with letters not yet eliminated. Let’s look for common 5-letter words that fit S _ O _ _ and use letters from the allowed set.

Possible candidates:
- S P O I L → uses P, I, L (all allowed)
- S C O P E → but E is not allowed
- S H O R T → but R is not allowed
- S L O P Y → uses L, P, Y (all allowed)
- S C O W N → but N is not allowed

Between ""SPOIL"" and ""SLOPY"", both are valid. ""SPOIL"" uses P and I, which are common. Let’s go with that.

Check letters: S, P, O, I, L – none are in the forbidden list (A, R, E, U, N, D).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word has an O in the 3rd position.
- It contains an S somewhere except position 4.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or E.

I need a 5-letter word with O in the 3rd position, S somewhere else, and avoiding A, R, E.  
Good consonants left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.  
Vowels left: I, U (since A and E are out, and O is already placed).

A promising pattern: _ _ O _ _ with S somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 5.

Let me pick a word that fits: “CLOUD” doesn’t work (no S). “SPOIL” has S in 1 and O in 3, but I needs to check for A, R, E: S, P, O, I, L – none are A, R, E.  
Another candidate: “STOIC” – but S is in 1, O in 3, but C is allowed. However, I needs to ensure no A, R, E: S, T, O, I, C – all allowed.  
But “STOIC” might be too obscure. A more common word: “SLOTH” – but H is allowed.  
Another common word: “SOUND” – but U is allowed, N, D – all allowed.  
But “SOUND” has S in 1 and O in 3, no forbidden letters.  

Let me go with “SOUND” as it’s common and fits the constraints.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
   - O is fixed in position 3.
   - S is somewhere in the word but not position 4.
   - A, R, E are not in the word.

2. SOUND → S(✓) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)
   - S is now fixed in position 1.
   - O is in the word but not in position 2 (which we already knew it was in position 3).
   - U, N, D are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: S _ O _ _
- Letters not in the word: A, R, E, U, N, D
- S is locked in position 1.
- O is locked in position 3.

Remaining vowels to consider: I, Y (A, E, U already out).

- S C O P E → but E is not allowed
- S H O R T → but R is not allowed
- S L O P Y → uses L, P, Y (all allowed)
- S C O W N → but N is not allowed

Between ""SPOIL"" and ""SLOPY"", both are valid. ""SPOIL"" uses P and I, which are common. Let’s go with that.

Check letters: S, P, O, I, L – none are in the forbidden list (A, R, E, U, N, D).

""SHOCK"" fits perfectly:

Current confirmed facts:

   Remaining consonants: B, F, G, M, T, W (and a few rarer ones)

4. We need two more letters for positions 2 and 5, chosen only from the allowed set.

5. Use the dictionary word list to find the first valid candidate that fits S _ O _ _ and uses only allowed letters.

Scanning the dictionary for S _ O _ _ words that avoid all banned letters:

- S B O _ _ → SBOD_?  No standard word.
- S F O _ _ → SFOOT?  Not a word.
- S G O _ _ → SGOD_?  No.
- S M O _ _ → SMOKE?  But K is banned, and M, O, K, E are in play.  Wait, E is banned, K is banned.  SMOKE has K, which is banned → discard.

- S T O O G S → double S.
- S T O O M S → double S.

None of these are standard 5-letter words.  Let me rethink.

Wait—let’s list every remaining consonant:  
B, F, G, M, T, W, plus Y.

We need a valid English word of the form S ? O ? ? using only those letters.

Try every combination:

- S B O G G → no
- S B O G Y → no
- S B O M B → no
- S B O M Y → no
- S B O T T → no
- S B O T Y → no

- S T O G Y → no
- S T O B B → no
- S T O B Y → no
- S T O W Y → no
- S T O M S → double S, but S is already in position 1, and we don’t know if S repeats.  The feedback never said S doesn’t repeat, only that S is in position 1.  So possible.
- S T O O M → but O is already in position 3, so O in position 2 would conflict (feedback showed O in position 2 is wrong in SOUND, but that was before we locked S in position 1—wait, let’s re-examine feedback carefully).

Re-examining feedback:

- SOUND: S(✓) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x) → O is in word but NOT in position 2.  
  This overrides the earlier AROSE feedback that said O was in position 3 (✓).  The two ✓ marks must have been mis-flagged; in fact, the feedback system only shows ✓ for position 3 in AROSE.  In SOUND the O in position 2 got (-), meaning O is in the word but not in position 2.  Therefore O can be in position 2, 4, or 5, but position 3 is confirmed by AROSE as ✓, so position 3 is definitely O.  Thus the pattern is indeed S _ O _ _ (position 3 is fixed as O).

So:

- Pattern: S _ O _ _
- Letters banned: A, R, E, U, N, D, P, I, L, H, C, K
- Allowed letters: B, F, G, M, T, W, Y

Now find 5-letter words S ? O ? ? using only those letters.

Valid words found:
- S B O O T → no
- S B O O M → no

- S B O O N → N is banned
- S F O O N → N banned
- S T O O N → N banned
- S M O O N → N banned
- S G O O N → N banned

None of these are standard words.  Let me check double-S words:  
- S T O O S → has S in 1 and 5, but S is allowed to repeat?  The feedback never said S can’t repeat.  Let’s check:  
  S T O O S → letters: S, T, O, O, S.  All letters allowed (T is allowed, O is allowed, S is allowed).  This is a valid word.

Therefore the next logical guess is STOOS.

But wait—let me double-check:  
STOOS:  
S T O O S  
- S(1) ✓ already known  
- T(2) allowed  
- O(3) ✓ already known from AROSE  
- O(4) allowed (only that O is not in position 2 from SOUND; position 3 is already taken by O, so position 4 is fine)  
- S(5) allowed  

No forbidden letters.  STOOS is a valid 5-letter English word.

So I will guess STOOS.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word has an O in the 3rd position.
- It contains an S somewhere except position 4.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or E.

I need a 5-letter word with O in the 3rd position, S somewhere else, and avoiding A, R, E.  
Good consonants left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.  
Vowels left: I, U (since A and E are out, and O is already placed).

A promising pattern: _ _ O _ _ with S somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 5.

Let me pick a word that fits: “CLOUD” doesn’t work (no S). “SPOIL” has S in 1 and O in 3, but I needs to check for A, R, E: S, P, O, I, L – none are A, R, E.  
Another candidate: “STOIC” – but S is in 1, O in 3, but C is allowed. However, I needs to ensure no A, R, E: S, T, O, I, C – all allowed.  
But “STOIC” might be too obscure. A more common word: “SLOTH” – but H is allowed.  
Another common word: “SOUND” – but U is allowed, N, D – all allowed.  
But “SOUND” has S in 1 and O in 3, no forbidden letters.  

Let me go with “SOUND” as it’s common and fits the constraints.

<guess>SOUND</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
   - O is fixed in position 3.
   - S is somewhere in the word but not position 4.
   - A, R, E are not in the word.

2. SOUND → S(✓) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)
   - S is now fixed in position 1.
   - O is in the word but not in position 2 (which we already knew it was in position 3).
   - U, N, D are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: S _ O _ _
- Letters not in the word: A, R, E, U, N, D
- S is locked in position 1.
- O is locked in position 3.

Remaining vowels to consider: I, Y (A, E, U already out).
Remaining common consonants: B, C, F, G, H, L, M, P, T, W, etc.

We need to fill positions 2 and 5 with letters not yet eliminated. Let’s look for common 5-letter words that fit S _ O _ _ and use letters from the allowed set.

Possible candidates:
- S P O I L → uses P, I, L (all allowed)
- S C O P E → but E is not allowed
- S H O R T → but R is not allowed
- S L O P Y → uses L, P, Y (all allowed)
- S C O W N → but N is not allowed

Between ""SPOIL"" and ""SLOPY"", both are valid. ""SPOIL"" uses P and I, which are common. Let’s go with that.

Check letters: S, P, O, I, L – none are in the forbidden list (A, R, E, U, N, D).

Guess 3: SPOIL -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) O(✓) I(x) L(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Current constraints:

1. Pattern: S _ O _ _
2. Letters **not** in the word: A, R, E, U, N, D, P, I, L
3. S is locked in position 1 (✓).
4. O is locked in position 3 (✓).

Remaining vowels: Y (A, E, U, I already out; O is used).
Remaining common consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, T, W, etc.

We need to fill positions 2 and 5 with letters not yet eliminated. Let’s look for 5-letter words that fit S _ O _ _ and use allowed letters.

Possible letters for positions 2 and 5:
- Position 2: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, T, W, Y
- Position 5: same list, but must also avoid any letter that could form a valid word when combined with S, O, etc.

Let’s brainstorm some actual words:

- S B O _ _ → no common words
- S C O _ _ → SCOFF? (no), SCONE? (E is out), SCOUR? (U is out), SCOWS? (double S), SCOCK? (I is out), SCOFF? (not a word)
- S F O _ _ → SFOOT? (no), SFOUL? (U is out), SFOGE? (E is out)
- S G O _ _ → SGOFF? (no), SGOL_? (no), SGOT_? (T is allowed)
- S H O _ _ → SHOCK? (C, K allowed), SHOGI? (I is out), SHOWN? (N is out), SHOGI? (I is out)
- S M O _ _ → SMOCK? (no), SMOG? (only 4 letters), SMOKE? (K, E – E is out)
- S T O _ _ → STOCK? (C, K allowed), STOMP? (P is out), STONE? (E, N out), STOWS? (double S)
- S W O _ _ → SWOFF? (no), SWOON? (N is out), SWOOP? (P is out)
- S C O W S → uses C, W, S (but S is already in position 1, and double S is unlikely)
- S H O C K → SHOCK? (H, C, K allowed)

""SHOCK"" fits perfectly:
- S(1) ✓, H(2) allowed, O(3) ✓, C(4) allowed, K(5) allowed
- No forbidden letters (A, R, E, U, N, D, P, I, L are all absent)
- All letters are valid and common

Let’s go with SHOCK.

Guess 4: SHOCK -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) O(✓) C(x) K(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Current confirmed facts:

1. Pattern so far: S _ O _ _
2. Letters **not** in the word (from all feedback):  
   A, R, E, U, N, D, P, I, L, H, C, K  
   (twelve letters eliminated so far)

3. Remaining vowels: Y (only single-letter vowel left)  
   Remaining consonants: B, F, G, M, T, W (and a few rarer ones)

4. We need two more letters for positions 2 and 5, chosen only from the allowed set.

5. Use the dictionary word list to find the first valid candidate that fits S _ O _ _ and uses only allowed letters.

Scanning the dictionary for S _ O _ _ words that avoid all banned letters:

- S B O _ _ → SBOD_?  No standard word.
- S F O _ _ → SFOOT?  Not a word.
- S G O _ _ → SGOD_?  No.
- S M O _ _ → SMOKE?  But K is banned, and M, O, K, E are in play.  Wait, E is banned, K is banned.  SMOKE has K, which is banned → discard.
- S B O G G → no.
- S T O W Y → STOWY?  Not a word.
- S T O O T → double O, but T is allowed.  STOOT?  Not a word.
- S T O O N → N is banned.
- S T O O P → P is banned.
- S T O O M → STOOM?  Not a word.
- S T O O S → S is already in position 1, and double S is unlikely.
- S T O O D → D is banned.
- S T O O G → STOOG?  Not a word.
- S T O O B → STOOB?  Not a word.
- S T O O F → STOOF?  Not a word.
- S T O O W → STOW?  Only 4 letters.
- S T O O M S → again double S.
- S T O O T S → double S.
- S T O O B S → double S.
- S T O O G S → double S.
- S T O O M S → double S.

None of these are standard 5-letter words.  Let me rethink.

Wait—let’s list every remaining consonant:  
B, F, G, M, T, W, plus Y.

We need a valid English word of the form S ? O ? ? using only those letters.

Try every combination:

- S B O G G → no
- S B O G Y → no
- S B O M B → no
- S B O M Y → no
- S B O T T → no
- S B O T Y → no
- S F O G G → no
- S F O G Y → no
- S F O M B → no
- S F O M Y → no
- S F O T T → no
- S F O T Y → no
- S G O M M → no
- S G O M Y → no
- S G O T T → no
- S G O T Y → no
- S M O T T → no
- S M O T Y → no
- S M O B B → no
- S M O B Y → no
- S M O G G → no
- S M O G Y → no
- S M O W Y → no
- S T O M M → no
- S T O M Y → no
- S T O G G → no
- S T O G Y → no
- S T O B B → no
- S T O B Y → no
- S T O W Y → no
- S T O M S → double S, but S is already in position 1, and we don’t know if S repeats.  The feedback never said S doesn’t repeat, only that S is in position 1.  So possible.
- S T O O M → but O is already in position 3, so O in position 2 would conflict (feedback showed O in position 2 is wrong in SOUND, but that was before we locked S in position 1—wait, let’s re-examine feedback carefully).

Re-examining feedback:

- SOUND: S(✓) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x) → O is in word but NOT in position 2.  
  This overrides the earlier AROSE feedback that said O was in position 3 (✓).  The two ✓ marks must have been mis-flagged; in fact, the feedback system only shows ✓ for position 3 in AROSE.  In SOUND the O in position 2 got (-), meaning O is in the word but not in position 2.  Therefore O can be in position 2, 4, or 5, but position 3 is confirmed by AROSE as ✓, so position 3 is definitely O.  Thus the pattern is indeed S _ O _ _ (position 3 is fixed as O).

So:

- Pattern: S _ O _ _
- Letters banned: A, R, E, U, N, D, P, I, L, H, C, K
- Allowed letters: B, F, G, M, T, W, Y

Now find 5-letter words S ? O ? ? using only those letters.

Valid words found:
- S B O O T → no
- S B O O M → no
- S F O O T → no
- S G O O M → no
- S M O O T → no
- S T O O M → no
- S T O O B → no
- S T O O G → no
- S T O O Y → no
- S W O O M → no
- S B O O N → N is banned
- S F O O N → N banned
- S T O O N → N banned
- S M O O N → N banned
- S G O O N → N banned

None of these are standard words.  Let me check double-S words:  
- S T O O S → has S in 1 and 5, but S is allowed to repeat?  The feedback never said S can’t repeat.  Let’s check:  
  S T O O S → letters: S, T, O, O, S.  All letters allowed (T is allowed, O is allowed, S is allowed).  This is a valid word.

Therefore the next logical guess is STOOS.

But wait—let me double-check:  
STOOS:  
S T O O S  
- S(1) ✓ already known  
- T(2) allowed  
- O(3) ✓ already known from AROSE  
- O(4) allowed (only that O is not in position 2 from SOUND; position 3 is already taken by O, so position 4 is fine)  
- S(5) allowed  

No forbidden letters.  STOOS is a valid 5-letter English word.

So I will guess STOOS.
