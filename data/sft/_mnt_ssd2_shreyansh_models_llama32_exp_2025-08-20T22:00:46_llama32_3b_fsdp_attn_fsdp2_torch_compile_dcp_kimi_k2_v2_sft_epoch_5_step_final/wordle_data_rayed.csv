### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters to maximize information gain. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This will give us good coverage of vowels and common consonants.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters in the word (and their forbidden positions):
- R is correct in position 1 (R✓).
- A is somewhere in positions 2-5 (A- in both guesses).
- E is somewhere in positions 2-4 (E- in both guesses).

Letters not in the word at all:
- O, S, C, T.

So the pattern so far is:
R _ _ _ _   (R fixed at 1)
with A and E still to place (and no O, S, C, T).

Remaining common consonants to try: N, L, D, G, B, M, P, etc.
Vowels left: I, U (but we already have A and E).

I’ll place A and E in positions 3 and 4 (both are still possible) and fill the last slot with a new common consonant that hasn’t been ruled out.

Candidate: R A E N D → “RAEND” is not a valid word.
Candidate: R E A N D → “REAND” is not valid.
Candidate: R A N E D → “RANED” is not valid.
Candidate: R E D A N → “REDAN” is not valid.

Let’s try a different set of consonants: R A I N D → “RAIND” – no.
R E I N D → “REIND” – no.
R A N E D – again invalid.

How about R E L A N → “RELAN” – no.
R A N E R – double R, but R is already fixed at 1, so invalid.

A valid word that fits R _ _ _ _ and uses A, E, plus new consonants N and D is “RENAL”.

Check:
- R at 1: ✓

Check constraints:
- R at 1: ✓

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters to maximize information gain. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This will give us good coverage of vowels and common consonants.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1  
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2  
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all  
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all  
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5  

So we know:
- The word contains A, R, E (but not O or S)  
- A is not first, R is not second, E is not last  
- We still have no information about positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 except those of A, R, E  

Next, I’ll pick a word that keeps A, R, E while trying new common consonants and avoiding O and S. Good candidates are letters like T, N, L, C, D, etc.  

A strong choice is “REACT”:
- It keeps R, E, A  
- Moves A to position 2 (allowed)  
- Moves R to position 1 (allowed)  
- Moves E to position 3 (allowed)  
- Adds new common consonants C and T  
- Avoids O and S entirely

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: REACT -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(-) A(-) C(x) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters in the word (and their forbidden positions):
- R is correct in position 1 (R✓).
- A is somewhere in positions 2-5 (A- in both guesses).
- E is somewhere in positions 2-4 (E- in both guesses).

Letters not in the word at all:
- O, S, C, T.

So the pattern so far is:
R _ _ _ _   (R fixed at 1)
with A and E still to place (and no O, S, C, T).

Remaining common consonants to try: N, L, D, G, B, M, P, etc.
Vowels left: I, U (but we already have A and E).

I’ll place A and E in positions 3 and 4 (both are still possible) and fill the last slot with a new common consonant that hasn’t been ruled out.

Candidate: R A E N D → “RAEND” is not a valid word.
Candidate: R E A N D → “REAND” is not valid.
Candidate: R A N E D → “RANED” is not valid.
Candidate: R E D A N → “REDAN” is not valid.

Let’s try a different set of consonants: R A I N D → “RAIND” – no.
R E I N D → “REIND” – no.
R A N E D – again invalid.

How about R E L A N → “RELAN” – no.
R A N E R – double R, but R is already fixed at 1, so invalid.

A valid word that fits R _ _ _ _ and uses A, E, plus new consonants N and D is “RENAL”.

Check:
- R at 1: ✓
- E at 2: still possible (only forbidden at 2 was in REACT, but that was before we locked R at 1; actually in REACT E was at 2 and was only marked “-”, so E can be at 2, 3, 4)
- N: new letter
- A: must be in 2,3,4,5
- L: new letter

“RENAL” is a real word and satisfies all constraints.

Forbidden letters: O, S, C, T, N, L.

So the pattern is:
R _ _ _ _ with A and E still to place, and no O, S, C, T, N, L.

Possible positions for A and E:
- A can be 2,3,4,5
- E can be 2,3,4

Let’s try to place A and E while introducing new common consonants. Good unused consonants left: D, G, B, M, P, F, H, K, etc.

How about R E A D Y → “READY” – valid word, uses A, E, R, and new letters D, Y.

Check constraints:
- R at 1: ✓
- E at 2: allowed (only forbidden at 2 in REACT, but we now know that was before fixing R; actually in RENAL E was at 2 and was “-”, so E can be at 2, 3, 4)
- A at 3: allowed (was “-” in both REACT and RENAL, so 3 is new)
- D and Y are new letters.

This fits all constraints.

From all feedback so far:

Fixed letter: R at position 1 (R✓).

Letters that must appear somewhere (but positions unknown):
- A  (was ""-"" in every guess so far)
- E  (was ""-"" in every guess so far)
- D  (was ""D-"" in READY, so D is in the word but not at position 4)
- Y  (was ""Y-"" in READY, so Y is in the word but not at position 5)

Forbidden letters: O, S, C, T, N, L.

Current pattern: R _ _ _ _

A and E must still be placed, and they can’t go where we’ve already tried:
- A can’t be 1, 2, 3 (from REACT and RENAL/READY) → so A must be at 4 or 5.
- E can’t be 2 or 5 (from REACT and RENAL/READY) → so E must be at 2, 3, or 4.

But A and E can’t both be at 4 or 5 simultaneously (since they must each occupy distinct positions).

Let’s list valid placements for A and E:

Case 1: A at 4
Then E must be at 2 or 3.
- If E at 2: R E _ A _
- If E at 3: R _ E A _

Case 2: A at 5
Then E must be at 2, 3, or 4.
- E at 2: R E _ _ A
- E at 3: R _ E _ A
- E at 4: R _ _ E A (but then D and Y must fit somewhere, and we have only 3 remaining slots)

The READY feedback told us D is in the word but not at 4, and Y is in the word but not at 5. So in Case 2-E at 4, we’d need D and Y in positions 2 and 3, but that would put Y at 5, which is forbidden. So E at 4 is impossible.

Thus the only viable case is Case 1 with E at 2 or 3.

Sub-case 1.2: E at 2
Then A must be at 5 (since A can’t be at 3 if E is at 2).
So pattern: R E _ A _

Sub-case 1.3: E at 3
Then A must be at 5 (same reason).
So pattern: R _ E A _

We need to fill the two blank spots with letters we haven’t used yet (from the common remaining letters: B, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, etc.) while ensuring D and Y are placed appropriately.

Let’s try Sub-case 1.2: R E _ A _
We need a consonant at position 3 and 5.
Good consonants left: B, F, G, H, K, M, P.

Try REBAG – but G is okay, B is okay, but is “REBAG” valid? No, it’s not a common word.

Try REHAB – valid word, uses H and B.
Check constraints:
- R at 1: ✓
- E at 2: allowed
- H, B new letters
- A at 4: allowed (was ""-"" in all positions tried so far)
- D is not used here, but we know D must be in the word somewhere. So we need to place D in one of the remaining positions (2,3,4,5) but position 2 is E, 4 is A, 5 is free. So D must be at 3 or 5.

But in READY, D was at 4 and marked “-” (in word but wrong spot), so D must be at 3 or 5. In REHAB, D is not used, so this doesn’t satisfy the D requirement.

Wait, we must include D somewhere. Let’s revise: place D at 3 or 5, and put other letters accordingly.

Revised pattern: R E D A _  (D at 3)
But then we need a 5th letter; we’ve used R, E, D, A. We need one more consonant. Is “REDA?” no.

Better: R E D A M – “RE DAM” – not valid.

How about R E D G E – invalid.

Let’s try D at 5: R E _ A D
Need a consonant at 3. Valid word: R E B A D – “REBAD” no.
R E G A D – “REGAD” no.

Sub-case 1.3: R _ E A _
Need letters at 2 and 5.
Valid word: R I E A D – but D is at 5, which is allowed (D was “-” at 4, so 5 is fine). Also I is new.

Check: R I E A D
- R at 1: ✓
- I new letter
- E at 3: allowed
- A at 4: allowed
- D at 5: allowed (D was “-” at 4, so 5 is fine)

This satisfies all constraints: includes D, uses new letters, keeps A and E placements minimal.

<guess>RIEAD</guess>
</think>

<guess>RIEAD</guess>",RIEAD,"From all feedback so far:

Fixed letter: R at position 1 (R✓).

Letters that must appear somewhere (but positions unknown):
- A  (was ""-"" in every guess so far)
- E  (was ""-"" in every guess so far)
- D  (was ""D-"" in READY, so D is in the word but not at position 4)
- Y  (was ""Y-"" in READY, so Y is in the word but not at position 5)

Forbidden letters: O, S, C, T, N, L.

Current pattern: R _ _ _ _

A and E must still be placed, and they can’t go where we’ve already tried:
- A can’t be 1, 2, 3 (from REACT and RENAL/READY) → so A must be at 4 or 5.
- E can’t be 2 or 5 (from REACT and RENAL/READY) → so E must be at 2, 3, or 4.

But A and E can’t both be at 4 or 5 simultaneously (since they must each occupy distinct positions).

Let’s list valid placements for A and E:

Case 1: A at 4
Then E must be at 2 or 3.
- If E at 2: R E _ A _
- If E at 3: R _ E A _

Case 2: A at 5
Then E must be at 2, 3, or 4.
- E at 2: R E _ _ A
- E at 3: R _ E _ A
- E at 4: R _ _ E A (but then D and Y must fit somewhere, and we have only 3 remaining slots)

The READY feedback told us D is in the word but not at 4, and Y is in the word but not at 5. So in Case 2-E at 4, we’d need D and Y in positions 2 and 3, but that would put Y at 5, which is forbidden. So E at 4 is impossible.

Thus the only viable case is Case 1 with E at 2 or 3.

Sub-case 1.2: E at 2
Then A must be at 5 (since A can’t be at 3 if E is at 2).
So pattern: R E _ A _

Sub-case 1.3: E at 3
Then A must be at 5 (same reason).
So pattern: R _ E A _

We need to fill the two blank spots with letters we haven’t used yet (from the common remaining letters: B, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, etc.) while ensuring D and Y are placed appropriately.

Let’s try Sub-case 1.2: R E _ A _
We need a consonant at position 3 and 5.
Good consonants left: B, F, G, H, K, M, P.

Try REBAG – but G is okay, B is okay, but is “REBAG” valid? No, it’s not a common word.

Try REHAB – valid word, uses H and B.
Check constraints:
- R at 1: ✓
- E at 2: allowed
- H, B new letters
- A at 4: allowed (was ""-"" in all positions tried so far)
- D is not used here, but we know D must be in the word somewhere. So we need to place D in one of the remaining positions (2,3,4,5) but position 2 is E, 4 is A, 5 is free. So D must be at 3 or 5.

But in READY, D was at 4 and marked “-” (in word but wrong spot), so D must be at 3 or 5. In REHAB, D is not used, so this doesn’t satisfy the D requirement.

Wait, we must include D somewhere. Let’s revise: place D at 3 or 5, and put other letters accordingly.

Revised pattern: R E D A _  (D at 3)
But then we need a 5th letter; we’ve used R, E, D, A. We need one more consonant. Is “REDA?” no.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters to maximize information gain. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This will give us good coverage of vowels and common consonants.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1  
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2  
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all  
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all  
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5  

So we know:
- The word contains A, R, E (but not O or S)  
- A is not first, R is not second, E is not last  
- We still have no information about positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 except those of A, R, E  

Next, I’ll pick a word that keeps A, R, E while trying new common consonants and avoiding O and S. Good candidates are letters like T, N, L, C, D, etc.  

A strong choice is “REACT”:
- It keeps R, E, A  
- Moves A to position 2 (allowed)  
- Moves R to position 1 (allowed)  
- Moves E to position 3 (allowed)  
- Adds new common consonants C and T  
- Avoids O and S entirely

<guess>REACT</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: REACT -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(-) A(-) C(x) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters in the word (and their forbidden positions):
- R is correct in position 1 (R✓).
- A is somewhere in positions 2-5 (A- in both guesses).
- E is somewhere in positions 2-4 (E- in both guesses).

Letters not in the word at all:
- O, S, C, T.

So the pattern so far is:
R _ _ _ _   (R fixed at 1)
with A and E still to place (and no O, S, C, T).

Remaining common consonants to try: N, L, D, G, B, M, P, etc.
Vowels left: I, U (but we already have A and E).

I’ll place A and E in positions 3 and 4 (both are still possible) and fill the last slot with a new common consonant that hasn’t been ruled out.

Candidate: R A E N D → “RAEND” is not a valid word.
Candidate: R E A N D → “REAND” is not valid.
Candidate: R A N E D → “RANED” is not valid.
Candidate: R E D A N → “REDAN” is not valid.

Let’s try a different set of consonants: R A I N D → “RAIND” – no.
R E I N D → “REIND” – no.
R A N E D – again invalid.

How about R E L A N → “RELAN” – no.
R A N E R – double R, but R is already fixed at 1, so invalid.

A valid word that fits R _ _ _ _ and uses A, E, plus new consonants N and D is “RENAL”.

Check:
- R at 1: ✓
- E at 2: still possible (only forbidden at 2 was in REACT, but that was before we locked R at 1; actually in REACT E was at 2 and was only marked “-”, so E can be at 2, 3, 4)
- N: new letter
- A: must be in 2,3,4,5
- L: new letter

“RENAL” is a real word and satisfies all constraints.

<guess>RENAL</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: REACT -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(-) A(-) C(x) T(x)
Guess 3: RENAL -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(-) N(x) A(-) L(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From all feedback so far:

Known letters and positions:
- R is fixed at position 1 (R✓).

Known letters still to place:
- A must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (it was “-” in all guesses so far).
- E must be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (it was “-” in both REACT and RENAL).

Forbidden letters: O, S, C, T, N, L.

So the pattern is:
R _ _ _ _ with A and E still to place, and no O, S, C, T, N, L.

Possible positions for A and E:
- A can be 2,3,4,5
- E can be 2,3,4

Let’s try to place A and E while introducing new common consonants. Good unused consonants left: D, G, B, M, P, F, H, K, etc.

Let’s try:
R E A D _ → but we need 5 letters.
R E A D _ → “READ” needs a 5th letter.

How about R E A D Y → “READY” – valid word, uses A, E, R, and new letters D, Y.

Check constraints:
- R at 1: ✓
- E at 2: allowed (only forbidden at 2 in REACT, but we now know that was before fixing R; actually in RENAL E was at 2 and was “-”, so E can be at 2, 3, 4)
- A at 3: allowed (was “-” in both REACT and RENAL, so 3 is new)
- D and Y are new letters.

This fits all constraints.

Letters that must appear somewhere (but positions unknown):

- Y  (was ""Y-"" in READY, so Y is in the word but not at position 5)

Forbidden letters: O, S, C, T, N, L.

Current pattern: R _ _ _ _

A and E must still be placed, and they can’t go where we’ve already tried:
- A can’t be 1, 2, 3 (from REACT and RENAL/READY) → so A must be at 4 or 5.
- E can’t be 2 or 5 (from REACT and RENAL/READY) → so E must be at 2, 3, or 4.

But A and E can’t both be at 4 or 5 simultaneously (since they must each occupy distinct positions).

Let’s list valid placements for A and E:

Case 1: A at 4
Then E must be at 2 or 3.
- If E at 2: R E _ A _
- If E at 3: R _ E A _

Case 2: A at 5
Then E must be at 2, 3, or 4.
- E at 2: R E _ _ A
- E at 3: R _ E _ A
- E at 4: R _ _ E A (but then D and Y must fit somewhere, and we have only 3 remaining slots)

The READY feedback told us D is in the word but not at 4, and Y is in the word but not at 5. So in Case 2-E at 4, we’d need D and Y in positions 2 and 3, but that would put Y at 5, which is forbidden. So E at 4 is impossible.

Thus the only viable case is Case 1 with E at 2 or 3.

Sub-case 1.2: E at 2
Then A must be at 5 (since A can’t be at 3 if E is at 2).
So pattern: R E _ A _

Sub-case 1.3: E at 3
Then A must be at 5 (same reason).
So pattern: R _ E A _

We need to fill the two blank spots with letters we haven’t used yet (from the common remaining letters: B, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, etc.) while ensuring D and Y are placed appropriately.

We need a consonant at position 3 and 5.
Good consonants left: B, F, G, H, K, M, P.

Try REBAG – but G is okay, B is okay, but is “REBAG” valid? No, it’s not a common word.

Wait, let’s check dictionary for 5-letter words ending in “RAD” with R at 1 and D at 5.

“RADAR” – but we already have D at 5, so no.

“RADIX” – X is allowed, but I is forbidden.

“RADIO” – O is forbidden.

“RADGE” – G is allowed, but “RADGE” is rare.

“RADID” – I is forbidden.

“RADUM” – U is allowed, but “RADUM” is not common.

“RADON” – O and N are forbidden.

“RADAR” – already ruled out.

The only remaining valid English word that fits R A E _ D or R E A _ D is “REAUD” (invalid), “REBAD” (invalid), “RECAD” (C forbidden), “REDAD” (invalid), “REHAB” (B is allowed, H is allowed).
