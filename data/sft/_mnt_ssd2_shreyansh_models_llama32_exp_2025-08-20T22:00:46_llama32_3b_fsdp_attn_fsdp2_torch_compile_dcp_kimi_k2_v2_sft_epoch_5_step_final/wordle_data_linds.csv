### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word.

Another excellent candidate is ""SLATE"" which has:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common ending letter)
- E (most common vowel)

Between these two, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common vowels and consonants efficiently.

Check positions:

Current confirmed facts:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, G, C, H  
Letters definitely IN the word: S, I, N

From SINCH feedback:
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (so S ∈ {2,3,5})
- I is in position 2 (✓) – so I is fixed at position 2
- N is in position 3 (✓) – so N is fixed at position 3
- C and H are not in the word.

So the known pattern so far: _ I N _ _

Remaining letters to fill positions 1, 4, 5 must come from letters not yet eliminated.  
Allowed letters now include: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus S which we know is in the word but not yet placed).

We also know S must appear somewhere, and the only open positions are 1, 4, 5.

To maximize information, I want to test S in one of those positions and throw in two fresh consonants for the others.  
Let’s try placing S in position 4 and test two new consonants in positions 1 and 5.

Candidate words:
- DINSY – but Y is sometimes a vowel, not sure.
- MINUS – uses M and U, but M is okay.
- WISPS – but P and W are okay, and S in position 4 is new.

Actually, let’s go with a word that puts S in position 5 and uses two new common consonants in positions 1 and 4.  
That gives: _ I N _ S

Good common letters: D and L.

DINLS?  Not a word.  
DINBS?  Not a word.  
LINDS?  Valid word (a type of fish).  Let me check letters: L, I, N, D, S – all allowed.

So: L I N D S → but wait, I is fixed at 2, N at 3, so the pattern is _ I N _ S.  
Thus the first letter must be one of the remaining allowed letters, and the last letter must also be one of the remaining allowed letters.

Let me choose a word that puts S in position 5 and tests two new letters in positions 1 and 4.  
A good word is: F I N D S – but that’s not a valid English word.

Another option: M I N C S – but C is already eliminated.

Let me pick a valid word that fits _ I N _ S.  
The word “LINKS” is invalid (K is okay, but S is already known to be in the word).

Actually, the word “WINDS” fits the pattern _ I N _ S.  
Letters: W, I, N, D, S. All allowed letters. S is in position 5 here.

So: W I N D S → check constraints:
- W – new letter
- I – fixed at 2 (✓)
- N – fixed at 3 (✓)
- D – new letter
- S – must be in the word, and here it’s in position 5 (allowed because earlier feedback said S is not in position 1 or 4)

This seems optimal.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word.

Another excellent candidate is ""SLATE"" which has:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common ending letter)
- E (most common vowel)

Between these two, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common vowels and consonants efficiently.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we now know:
- The word contains S, but S is NOT in position 4.
- The letters A, R, O, E are definitely not in the word.

I want a new guess that:
1. Keeps S but moves it to a different position (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).
2. Uses only letters that have not been eliminated (so avoid A, R, O, E).
3. Uses common remaining consonants and vowels to maximize information gain.

Good candidate letters to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, N, P, T, U, Y, etc.

A strong choice is ""STING"":
- S is moved to position 1 (was position 4).
- Uses T, I, N, G which are all still possible.
- Uses common letters and has a good vowel/consonant mix.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STING -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(-) N(-) G(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, G  
2. Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: S, I, N

From Guess 1: S is in the word but **not** in position 4.  
From Guess 2: S is in the word but **not** in position 1, I is in the word but **not** in position 3, N is in the word but **not** in position 4.

So we must place:
- S somewhere other than 1 or 4  
- I somewhere other than 3  
- N somewhere other than 4  

We have three letters confirmed (S, I, N) and we need two more letters that have not been eliminated.  Remaining common letters include: B, C, D, F, H, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

A good next word would use all three of S, I, N plus two fresh letters, while respecting the positional restrictions.  “SINUS” is invalid (double S).  “SINCH” uses C and H which are still allowed.  Let’s try that.

Check positions:
- S (position 1) – allowed because S can be in positions 2, 3, 5 (not 1 or 4)  
- I (position 2) – allowed because I can be in positions 1, 4, 5 (not 3)  
- N (position 3) – allowed because N can be in positions 1, 2, 5 (not 3 or 4)  
- U and C are new letters.

This satisfies all constraints.

Current confirmed facts:

From SINCH feedback:
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (so S ∈ {2,3,5})
- I is in position 2 (✓) – so I is fixed at position 2
- N is in position 3 (✓) – so N is fixed at position 3
- C and H are not in the word.

So the known pattern so far: _ I N _ _

Remaining letters to fill positions 1, 4, 5 must come from letters not yet eliminated.  
Allowed letters now include: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus S which we know is in the word but not yet placed).

That gives: _ I N _ S

Good common letters: D and L.

DINLS?  Not a word.  
DINBS?  Not a word.  
LINDS?  Valid word (a type of fish).  Let me check letters: L, I, N, D, S – all allowed.

So: L I N D S → but wait, I is fixed at 2, N at 3, so the pattern is _ I N _ S.  
Thus the first letter must be one of the remaining allowed letters, and the last letter must also be one of the remaining allowed letters.

Let me choose a word that puts S in position 5 and tests two new letters in positions 1 and 4.  
A good word is: F I N D S – but that’s not a valid English word.

Another option: M I N C S – but C is already eliminated.

Let me pick a valid word that fits _ I N _ S.  
The word “LINKS” is invalid (K is okay, but S is already known to be in the word).

Actually, the word “WINDS” fits the pattern _ I N _ S.  
Letters: W, I, N, D, S. All allowed letters. S is in position 5 here.

So: W I N D S → check constraints:
- W – new letter

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word.

Another excellent candidate is ""SLATE"" which has:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common ending letter)
- E (most common vowel)

Between these two, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common vowels and consonants efficiently.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we now know:
- The word contains S, but S is NOT in position 4.
- The letters A, R, O, E are definitely not in the word.

I want a new guess that:
1. Keeps S but moves it to a different position (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).
2. Uses only letters that have not been eliminated (so avoid A, R, O, E).
3. Uses common remaining consonants and vowels to maximize information gain.

Good candidate letters to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, N, P, T, U, Y, etc.

A strong choice is ""STING"":
- S is moved to position 1 (was position 4).
- Uses T, I, N, G which are all still possible.
- Uses common letters and has a good vowel/consonant mix.

<guess>STING</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STING -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(-) N(-) G(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, G  
2. Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: S, I, N

From Guess 1: S is in the word but **not** in position 4.  
From Guess 2: S is in the word but **not** in position 1, I is in the word but **not** in position 3, N is in the word but **not** in position 4.

So we must place:
- S somewhere other than 1 or 4  
- I somewhere other than 3  
- N somewhere other than 4  

We have three letters confirmed (S, I, N) and we need two more letters that have not been eliminated.  Remaining common letters include: B, C, D, F, H, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

A good next word would use all three of S, I, N plus two fresh letters, while respecting the positional restrictions.  “SINUS” is invalid (double S).  “SINCH” uses C and H which are still allowed.  Let’s try that.

Check positions:
- S (position 1) – allowed because S can be in positions 2, 3, 5 (not 1 or 4)  
- I (position 2) – allowed because I can be in positions 1, 4, 5 (not 3)  
- N (position 3) – allowed because N can be in positions 1, 2, 5 (not 3 or 4)  
- U and C are new letters.

This satisfies all constraints.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STING -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(-) N(-) G(x)
Guess 3: SINCH -> FEEDBACK: S(-) I(✓) N(✓) C(x) H(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Current confirmed facts:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, G, C, H  
Letters definitely IN the word: S, I, N

From SINCH feedback:
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (so S ∈ {2,3,5})
- I is in position 2 (✓) – so I is fixed at position 2
- N is in position 3 (✓) – so N is fixed at position 3
- C and H are not in the word.

So the known pattern so far: _ I N _ _

Remaining letters to fill positions 1, 4, 5 must come from letters not yet eliminated.  
Allowed letters now include: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus S which we know is in the word but not yet placed).

We also know S must appear somewhere, and the only open positions are 1, 4, 5.

To maximize information, I want to test S in one of those positions and throw in two fresh consonants for the others.  
Let’s try placing S in position 4 and test two new consonants in positions 1 and 5.

Candidate words:
- DINSY – but Y is sometimes a vowel, not sure.
- MINUS – uses M and U, but M is okay.
- WISPS – but P and W are okay, and S in position 4 is new.

Actually, let’s go with a word that puts S in position 5 and uses two new common consonants in positions 1 and 4.  
That gives: _ I N _ S

Good common letters: D and L.

DINLS?  Not a word.  
DINBS?  Not a word.  
LINDS?  Valid word (a type of fish).  Let me check letters: L, I, N, D, S – all allowed.

So: L I N D S → but wait, I is fixed at 2, N at 3, so the pattern is _ I N _ S.  
Thus the first letter must be one of the remaining allowed letters, and the last letter must also be one of the remaining allowed letters.

Let me choose a word that puts S in position 5 and tests two new letters in positions 1 and 4.  
A good word is: F I N D S – but that’s not a valid English word.

Another option: M I N C S – but C is already eliminated.

Let me pick a valid word that fits _ I N _ S.  
The word “LINKS” is invalid (K is okay, but S is already known to be in the word).

Actually, the word “WINDS” fits the pattern _ I N _ S.  
Letters: W, I, N, D, S. All allowed letters. S is in position 5 here.

So: W I N D S → check constraints:
- W – new letter
- I – fixed at 2 (✓)
- N – fixed at 3 (✓)
- D – new letter
- S – must be in the word, and here it’s in position 5 (allowed because earlier feedback said S is not in position 1 or 4)

This seems optimal.

We now have the pattern _ I N D S and have discovered that every common consonant we try in the first position (W, B, etc.) is rejected.  
Letters already eliminated for position 1: A, R, O, E, T, G, C, H, W, B.

Still allowed for position 1: D, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z, etc.  
But D is already in position 4, so it can’t repeat in position 1 (would contradict single-letter usage unless the word has two D’s).

Instead, let’s look for a valid English word of the form ?INDS where ? is not yet ruled out.  
The only common 5-letter word that fits _ I N D S and hasn’t been tried is “FINDS”.  
F is still allowed (never eliminated), and it doesn’t conflict with any prior feedback.

So the final choice is:  
Pattern: _ I N D S  
Best valid word: FINDS
