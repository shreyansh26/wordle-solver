### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- A, E (common vowels)
- R, S (common consonants)
- O (another common vowel)

This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the right or wrong positions, which will help narrow down the possibilities for subsequent guesses.

   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3 (confirms round-1).
   - I is in the word but not in position 4.

Letters we know are in the word: O, S, I  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, E, T, C  

Positions we know:
- O ≠ 3
- S ≠ 1 & ≠ 4
- I ≠ 4

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses O, S, I exactly once each.
- Places them in positions allowed by the constraints above.
- Uses only letters from the remaining pool (can’t use A, R, E, T, C).

Remaining common consonants: N, D, L, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.  
Remaining vowels: U (since A, E are out, and we already have O, I).

Let’s try to place the letters:
- O can be in positions 2, 4, or 5.
- S can be in positions 2, 3, or 5.
- I can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

One word that satisfies these constraints is “SOUND”:
- S in position 1 → but S is forbidden in position 1 (from STOIC feedback). So SOUND is invalid.

Next candidate: “DOING”
- D, O, I, N, G → all letters allowed.
- Positions:
  - O in 2 (allowed)
  - I in 3 (allowed)
  - S is missing → DOING doesn’t have S, so it’s invalid.

Next: “SOLID”
- S, O, L, I, D → all allowed letters.
- Positions:
  - S in 1 → invalid (S cannot be in 1).

Next: “BLISS”
- B, L, I, S, S → has S twice, but we only know one S exists. Still, it’s valid to guess words with repeated letters; the extra S will just get an “x”.

But to maximize uniqueness, let’s try “SPOIL”:
- S, P, O, I, L → all allowed.
- Positions:
  - S in 1 → invalid (S cannot be in 1).

Next: “LOINS”
- L, O, I, N, S → all allowed.
- Positions:
  - O in 2 (allowed)
  - I in 3 (allowed)
  - S in 5 (allowed)
This seems valid.

Let me check LOINS against all constraints:
- Contains O, S, I → yes.
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- O is in position 2 (allowed).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

- R, S (common consonants)
- O (another common vowel)

This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the right or wrong positions, which will help narrow down the possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Remaining common consonants: N, D, L, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.  
Remaining vowels: U (since A, E are out, and we already have O, I).

Let’s try to place the letters:
- O can be in positions 2, 4, or 5.
- S can be in positions 2, 3, or 5.
- I can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

One word that satisfies these constraints is “SOUND”:
- S in position 1 → but S is forbidden in position 1 (from STOIC feedback). So SOUND is invalid.

Next candidate: “DOING”
- D, O, I, N, G → all letters allowed.
- Positions:
  - O in 2 (allowed)
  - I in 3 (allowed)
  - S is missing → DOING doesn’t have S, so it’s invalid.

Next: “SOLID”
- S, O, L, I, D → all allowed letters.
- Positions:
  - S in 1 → invalid (S cannot be in 1).

Next: “BLISS”
- B, L, I, S, S → has S twice, but we only know one S exists. Still, it’s valid to guess words with repeated letters; the extra S will just get an “x”.

But to maximize uniqueness, let’s try “SPOIL”:
- S, P, O, I, L → all allowed.
- Positions:
  - S in 1 → invalid (S cannot be in 1).

Next: “LOINS”
- L, O, I, N, S → all allowed.
- Positions:
  - O in 2 (allowed)
  - I in 3 (allowed)
  - S in 5 (allowed)
This seems valid.

Let me check LOINS against all constraints:
- Contains O, S, I → yes.
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- O is in position 2 (allowed).
- I is in position 3 (allowed).
- Letters L, N are new and allowed.
- No forbidden letters (A, R, E, T, C) are used.

Therefore, LOINS is a valid next guess.

From the new feedback on LOINS:
- L and N are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).
- I is in the word AND in the correct position (✓) → so I is in position 3.
- S is in the word and IN the correct position (✓) → so S is in position 5.

Current known facts:
- Letters in the word: O, I, S (with I fixed at 3 and S fixed at 5).
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, E, T, C, L, N.
- Positions:
  1: not S, T, A, R, E, L, N, C
  2: not O, A, R, E, T, C, L, N
  3: must be I (✓)
  4: ?
  5: must be S (✓)

So the pattern is: _ _ I _ S

Remaining letters we can use: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus O, which we know is in the word but not in position 2).

We still need to place O somewhere. O can be in positions 1, 4 (it cannot be in 2 or 3 or 5).

Let’s list possible 5-letter words matching _ _ I _ S with O in 1 or 4, and using only allowed letters:

Possible words:
- O _ I _ S → O, _, I, _, S
  - OPIKS → invalid (K is allowed, but word not common)
  - OPENS → invalid (N is out)
  - OMIKS → invalid
- _ _ I O S → _, _, I, O, S
  - BRIOS → invalid (R is out)
  - CHIOS → invalid (C is out)
  - DIOGS → invalid (G is allowed, but word not common)
  - FRIOS → invalid (R is out)
  - GRIOS → invalid (R is out)
  - HUMPS → invalid (T is out, but H, U, M, P, S are allowed, but word not matching)
  - KILOS → invalid (L is out)
  - MIMES → invalid (E is out)
  - PIVOTS → invalid (T is out)
  - WISPS → invalid (T is out)
  - VIGIL → invalid (L is out)

Looking at common words, one that fits is “PIKES” but E is out. Another is “WISPS” but T is out. A valid word with O in position 4 is “HUMPS” but it doesn’t fit the pattern.

Wait, let’s systematically list 5-letter words with O in 1 or 4, I in 3, S in 5:

- O _ I _ S → O, _, I, _, S
  - O, P, I, K, S → “OPIKS” – not a common word.
  - O, V, I, D, S → “OVIDS” – not common.
  - O, B, I, D, S → “OBIDS” – not common.

- _ _ I O S → _, _, I, O, S
  - B, I, O, S → “BIOS” – not 5 letters.
  - D, I, O, S → “DIOS” – not common.
  - F, I, O, S → “FIOS” – not common.
  - G, I, O, S → “GIOS” – not common.
  - H, I, O, S → “HIOS” – not common.
  - K, I, O, S → “KIOS” – not common.
  - M, I, O, S → “MIOS” – not common.
  - P, I, O, S → “PIOS” – not common.
  - V, I, O, S → “VIOS” – not common.
  - W, I, O, S → “WIOS” – not common.

Hmm, none of these are common words. Maybe I missed some letters.

Let me re-examine allowed letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus O, I, S).

A common word fitting _ _ I _ S with O in position 4 is “VOGUS” – but G and U are allowed, but this isn’t a common word.

Wait, let’s try “DOING” again? But we already ruled that out.

Another approach: list all 5-letter words ending in “IS” with I in 3 and S in 5, and containing O somewhere else.

Valid candidates:
- “VOGUS” – not common.
- “BOGUS” – not common.
- “DOGIS” – not common.
- “FOGIS” – not common.

Wait, let me think of “POSIX” – but X is allowed, but this is uncommon.

Actually, a common word fitting _ _ I _ S with O in position 4 is “HUMPS” – but it’s 5 letters: H, U, M, P, T, but T is out. So no.

Another: “GUMPS” – G, U, M, P, S – but S is in 5, I is in 3 – fits pattern: G U I O S – but O would be in 4, which is allowed.

GUMPS is a valid word and uses allowed letters (G, U, M, P, S).

Let me check constraints:
- Letters: G, U, M, P, S
- S is in 5 (✓)
- I is in 3 (✓)
- O is in 4 (allowed, since O was wrong only in 2 and 3, and 4 is new)
- No forbidden letters (A, R, E, T, C, L, N) are used.

GUMPS seems valid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- A, E (common vowels)
- R, S (common consonants)
- O (another common vowel)

This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the right or wrong positions, which will help narrow down the possibilities for subsequent guesses.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains O and S somewhere, but NOT in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes O and S (but O not in position 3, S not in position 4).
2. Excludes A, R, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good candidate letters to try next: T, N, I, L, U, C, D, M, P, etc.

A strong next guess would be ""STOIC"":
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since S was wrong only in position 4).
- T, I, C are new letters to test.
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since O was wrong only in position 3).
- Does not use any excluded letters (A, R, E).

Guess 2: STOIC -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(-) I(-) C(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
   - A, R, E are out.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. STOIC → S(-) T(x) O(-) I(-) C(x)
   - T, C are out.
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3 (confirms round-1).
   - I is in the word but not in position 4.

Letters we know are in the word: O, S, I  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, E, T, C  

Positions we know:
- O ≠ 3
- S ≠ 1 & ≠ 4
- I ≠ 4

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses O, S, I exactly once each.
- Places them in positions allowed by the constraints above.
- Uses only letters from the remaining pool (can’t use A, R, E, T, C).

Remaining common consonants: N, D, L, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.  
Remaining vowels: U (since A, E are out, and we already have O, I).

Let’s try to place the letters:
- O can be in positions 2, 4, or 5.
- S can be in positions 2, 3, or 5.
- I can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

One word that satisfies these constraints is “SOUND”:
- S in position 1 → but S is forbidden in position 1 (from STOIC feedback). So SOUND is invalid.

Next candidate: “DOING”
- D, O, I, N, G → all letters allowed.
- Positions:
  - O in 2 (allowed)
  - I in 3 (allowed)
  - S is missing → DOING doesn’t have S, so it’s invalid.

Next: “SOLID”
- S, O, L, I, D → all allowed letters.
- Positions:
  - S in 1 → invalid (S cannot be in 1).

Next: “BLISS”
- B, L, I, S, S → has S twice, but we only know one S exists. Still, it’s valid to guess words with repeated letters; the extra S will just get an “x”.

But to maximize uniqueness, let’s try “SPOIL”:
- S, P, O, I, L → all allowed.
- Positions:
  - S in 1 → invalid (S cannot be in 1).

Next: “LOINS”
- L, O, I, N, S → all allowed.
- Positions:
  - O in 2 (allowed)
  - I in 3 (allowed)
  - S in 5 (allowed)
This seems valid.

Let me check LOINS against all constraints:
- Contains O, S, I → yes.
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- O is in position 2 (allowed).
- I is in position 3 (allowed).
- Letters L, N are new and allowed.
- No forbidden letters (A, R, E, T, C) are used.

Therefore, LOINS is a valid next guess.

Guess 3: LOINS -> FEEDBACK: L(x) O(-) I(✓) N(x) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on LOINS:
- L and N are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).
- I is in the word AND in the correct position (✓) → so I is in position 3.
- S is in the word and IN the correct position (✓) → so S is in position 5.

Current known facts:
- Letters in the word: O, I, S (with I fixed at 3 and S fixed at 5).
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, E, T, C, L, N.
- Positions:
  1: not S, T, A, R, E, L, N, C
  2: not O, A, R, E, T, C, L, N
  3: must be I (✓)
  4: ?
  5: must be S (✓)

So the pattern is: _ _ I _ S

Remaining letters we can use: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus O, which we know is in the word but not in position 2).

We still need to place O somewhere. O can be in positions 1, 4 (it cannot be in 2 or 3 or 5).

Let’s list possible 5-letter words matching _ _ I _ S with O in 1 or 4, and using only allowed letters:

Possible words:
- O _ I _ S → O, _, I, _, S
  - OPIKS → invalid (K is allowed, but word not common)
  - OPENS → invalid (N is out)
  - OMIKS → invalid
- _ _ I O S → _, _, I, O, S
  - BRIOS → invalid (R is out)
  - CHIOS → invalid (C is out)
  - DIOGS → invalid (G is allowed, but word not common)
  - FRIOS → invalid (R is out)
  - GRIOS → invalid (R is out)
  - HUMPS → invalid (T is out, but H, U, M, P, S are allowed, but word not matching)
  - KILOS → invalid (L is out)
  - MIMES → invalid (E is out)
  - PIVOTS → invalid (T is out)
  - WISPS → invalid (T is out)
  - VIGIL → invalid (L is out)

Looking at common words, one that fits is “PIKES” but E is out. Another is “WISPS” but T is out. A valid word with O in position 4 is “HUMPS” but it doesn’t fit the pattern.

Wait, let’s systematically list 5-letter words with O in 1 or 4, I in 3, S in 5:

- O _ I _ S → O, _, I, _, S
  - O, P, I, K, S → “OPIKS” – not a common word.
  - O, V, I, D, S → “OVIDS” – not common.
  - O, B, I, D, S → “OBIDS” – not common.

- _ _ I O S → _, _, I, O, S
  - B, I, O, S → “BIOS” – not 5 letters.
  - D, I, O, S → “DIOS” – not common.
  - F, I, O, S → “FIOS” – not common.
  - G, I, O, S → “GIOS” – not common.
  - H, I, O, S → “HIOS” – not common.
  - K, I, O, S → “KIOS” – not common.
  - M, I, O, S → “MIOS” – not common.
  - P, I, O, S → “PIOS” – not common.
  - V, I, O, S → “VIOS” – not common.
  - W, I, O, S → “WIOS” – not common.

Hmm, none of these are common words. Maybe I missed some letters.

Let me re-examine allowed letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus O, I, S).

A common word fitting _ _ I _ S with O in position 4 is “VOGUS” – but G and U are allowed, but this isn’t a common word.

Wait, let’s try “DOING” again? But we already ruled that out.

Another approach: list all 5-letter words ending in “IS” with I in 3 and S in 5, and containing O somewhere else.

Valid candidates:
- “VOGUS” – not common.
- “BOGUS” – not common.
- “DOGIS” – not common.
- “FOGIS” – not common.

Wait, let me think of “POSIX” – but X is allowed, but this is uncommon.

Actually, a common word fitting _ _ I _ S with O in position 4 is “HUMPS” – but it’s 5 letters: H, U, M, P, T, but T is out. So no.

Another: “GUMPS” – G, U, M, P, S – but S is in 5, I is in 3 – fits pattern: G U I O S – but O would be in 4, which is allowed.

GUMPS is a valid word and uses allowed letters (G, U, M, P, S).

Let me check constraints:
- Letters: G, U, M, P, S
- S is in 5 (✓)
- I is in 3 (✓)
- O is in 4 (allowed, since O was wrong only in 2 and 3, and 4 is new)
- No forbidden letters (A, R, E, T, C, L, N) are used.

GUMPS seems valid.

From the new feedback on GUMPS:
- G, U, P are NOT in the word (x).
- M is in the word but in the WRONG position (-) → so M is somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 3.
- S is confirmed in position 5 (✓).

Current confirmed facts:
- Word pattern: _ _ I _ S  (I in 3, S in 5)
- Letters in the word: O, I, S, M (M is new, but not in 3)
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, E, T, C, L, N, G, U, P

Thus the word must be of the form:
- Position 1: one of O, M, W, D, F, H, J, K, V, Y, Z
- Position 2: one of O, M, W, D, F, H, J, K, V, Y, Z
- Position 3: I (fixed)
- Position 4: one of O, M, W, D, F, H, J, K, V, Y, Z
- Position 5: S (fixed)

And the letter M must appear exactly once, in positions 1, 2, or 4 (since it was marked wrong in position 3).

We need a common 5-letter word matching the pattern above with M included exactly once and no forbidden letters.

Possible candidates:
- M _ I _ S → M, _, I, _, S
  - M, I, C, S → C is out.
  - M, I, D, S → “MIDIS” – not a word.
  - M, I, N, S → N is out.
  - M, I, S, S → invalid (S already used once).
  - M, O, I, D, S → “MOIDS” – not a word.
  - M, O, I, L, S → L is out.

- _ M I _ S → _ M I _ S
  - B, M, I, D, S → “BMIDS” – not a word.
  - D, M, I, B, S → “DMIBS” – not a word.
  - F, M, I, D, S → “FMIDS” – not a word.
  - H, M, I, D, S → “HMIDS” – not a word.
  - V, M, I, D, S → “VMIDS” – not a word.

- _ _ I M S → _ _ I M S
  - B, I, M, S → “BIMPS” – not a word.
  - D, I, M, S → “DIMPS” – not a word.
  - F, I, M, S → “FIMPS” – not a word.
  - H, I, M, S → “HIMPS” – not a word.
  - K, I, M, S → “KIMPS” – not a word.
  - V, I, M, S → “VIMPS” – not a word.

Wait, let me try “WHIMS”:
- W, H, I, M, S
- I is in 3 (✓), S is in 5 (✓), M is in 4 (allowed), O is not present here, but we know O must be in the word. So WHIMS is invalid because it lacks O.

Next: “WOIMS” – not a word.
“HOIMS” – not a word.
“VOGUS” – already ruled out.

Let me try “DOIMS” – but D, O, I, M, S:
- D is allowed.
- O is allowed and must be in position 2 (since it was wrong in 2 before, but that was before we locked I and S).
 Wait, O was wrong in positions 2 and 3, but 3 is I, so O can be in 1 or 4.

In “DOIMS”:
- D, O, I, M, S
- O is in 2 – but O was wrong in 2 before (from LOINS feedback), so O cannot be in 2. Thus DOIMS is invalid.

Next: “MOIST” – but T is out.
“HOIST” – T is out.

Let me try “VOGUS” – but G is out.

Wait, let me list all possible letters left:
Allowed letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, M, O, W, Y, Z (plus I, S)

We need a word of the form:
- Position 1: one of B, D, F, H, J, K, W, Y, Z
- Position 2: one of B, D, F, H, J, K, W, Y, Z
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: one of O, M, W, D, F, H, J, K, V, Y, Z
- Position 5: S

And M must appear exactly once, in positions 1, 2, or 4.

Let’s try “BOMIS” – but not a word.
“DOWIS” – not a word.
“FOMIS” – not a word.
“HOMIS” – not a word.
“JOWIS” – not a word.
“KOMIS” – not a word.
“WOMIS” – not a word.
“YOWIS” – not a word.
“ZOWIS” – not a word.

Wait, let me think of “WIMPS” – but W, I, M, P, S – P is out.

Another approach: list all 5-letter words ending in “IS” with I in 3, S in 5, and containing O and M.

Valid candidates:
- “MOIST” – T is out.
- “WOIST” – T is out.
- “DOING” – N is out.
- “BOINK” – K is allowed, but doesn’t fit pattern.
- “VOGUS” – G is out.

Let me try “DOUGH” – but G, H are allowed, but it’s 5 letters: D, O, U, G, H – but U is out.

Another: “HUMPS” – T is out.

Wait, let me systematically list possible words with pattern _ _ I _ S, containing O and M, no forbidden letters.

The only possible pattern is:
- Position 1: O or M or W or D or F or H or J or K or Y or Z
- Position 2: O or M or W or D or F or H or J or K or Y or Z
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: O or M
- Position 5: S

Let’s try:
- Position 1: O
- Position 2: M
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: S – but S is already in 5, so invalid.
- Position 1: M
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: S – same issue.

We need O and M both present, but S is already in 5.

Thus the only possible placement is:
- Position 1: O or M
- Position 2: O or M
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: O or M
- Position 5: S

Let’s try “OMICS” – but C is out.

Wait, let me think of “WOIST” – but T is out.

Another: “DOING” – N is out.

Let me try “VOGUS” – G is out.

I’m stuck on common words. Let me think of “JOWIS” – not a word.

Let me try “KIMOS” – but S is in 5, so K, I, M, O, S:
- S is in 5 (✓)
- I is in 3 (✓)
- O is in 4 (allowed)
- M is in 2 (allowed)
- K is allowed.

“KIMOS” is a valid word (though rare), but let’s try “KIMOS”.

Check constraints:
- K, I, M, O, S
- S is in 5 (✓)
- I is in 3 (✓)
- O is in 4 (allowed)
- M is in 2 (allowed)
- No forbidden letters (A, R, E, T, C, L, N, G, U, P) are used.

Thus KIMOS is a valid guess.

But wait, is KIMOS a common word? It’s a variant spelling of “KIOSK” but not common.

This suggests we might need O twice, but LOINS already showed O was in the word once. However, the feedback didn’t indicate how many O’s are allowed. Since LOINS only showed one O, and we haven’t seen another O since, we can assume one O is present.

Thus the word must be:
- Position 1: one of B, D, F, H, J, K, W, Y, Z
- Position 2: one of B, D, F, H, J, K, W, Y, Z
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: O (since we know one O is present, and S is in 5)
- Position 5: S

Thus the pattern is: _ _ I O S

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 20 Aug 2025

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- A, E (common vowels)
- R, S (common consonants)
- O (another common vowel)

This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the right or wrong positions, which will help narrow down the possibilities for subsequent guesses.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains O and S somewhere, but NOT in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes O and S (but O not in position 3, S not in position 4).
2. Excludes A, R, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good candidate letters to try next: T, N, I, L, U, C, D, M, P, etc.

A strong next guess would be ""STOIC"":
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since S was wrong only in position 4).
- T, I, C are new letters to test.
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since O was wrong only in position 3).
- Does not use any excluded letters (A, R, E).

<guess>STOIC</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STOIC -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(-) I(-) C(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
   - A, R, E are out.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. STOIC → S(-) T(x) O(-) I(-) C(x)
   - T, C are out.
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3 (confirms round-1).
   - I is in the word but not in position 4.

Letters we know are in the word: O, S, I  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, E, T, C  

Positions we know:
- O ≠ 3
- S ≠ 1 & ≠ 4
- I ≠ 4

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses O, S, I exactly once each.
- Places them in positions allowed by the constraints above.
- Uses only letters from the remaining pool (can’t use A, R, E, T, C).

Remaining common consonants: N, D, L, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.  
Remaining vowels: U (since A, E are out, and we already have O, I).

Let’s try to place the letters:
- O can be in positions 2, 4, or 5.
- S can be in positions 2, 3, or 5.
- I can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

One word that satisfies these constraints is “SOUND”:
- S in position 1 → but S is forbidden in position 1 (from STOIC feedback). So SOUND is invalid.

Next candidate: “DOING”
- D, O, I, N, G → all letters allowed.
- Positions:
  - O in 2 (allowed)
  - I in 3 (allowed)
  - S is missing → DOING doesn’t have S, so it’s invalid.

Next: “SOLID”
- S, O, L, I, D → all allowed letters.
- Positions:
  - S in 1 → invalid (S cannot be in 1).

Next: “BLISS”
- B, L, I, S, S → has S twice, but we only know one S exists. Still, it’s valid to guess words with repeated letters; the extra S will just get an “x”.

But to maximize uniqueness, let’s try “SPOIL”:
- S, P, O, I, L → all allowed.
- Positions:
  - S in 1 → invalid (S cannot be in 1).

Next: “LOINS”
- L, O, I, N, S → all allowed.
- Positions:
  - O in 2 (allowed)
  - I in 3 (allowed)
  - S in 5 (allowed)
This seems valid.

Let me check LOINS against all constraints:
- Contains O, S, I → yes.
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- O is in position 2 (allowed).
- I is in position 3 (allowed).
- Letters L, N are new and allowed.
- No forbidden letters (A, R, E, T, C) are used.

Therefore, LOINS is a valid next guess.

<guess>LOINS</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STOIC -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(-) I(-) C(x)
Guess 3: LOINS -> FEEDBACK: L(x) O(-) I(✓) N(x) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on LOINS:
- L and N are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).
- I is in the word AND in the correct position (✓) → so I is in position 3.
- S is in the word and IN the correct position (✓) → so S is in position 5.

Current known facts:
- Letters in the word: O, I, S (with I fixed at 3 and S fixed at 5).
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, E, T, C, L, N.
- Positions:
  1: not S, T, A, R, E, L, N, C
  2: not O, A, R, E, T, C, L, N
  3: must be I (✓)
  4: ?
  5: must be S (✓)

So the pattern is: _ _ I _ S

Remaining letters we can use: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus O, which we know is in the word but not in position 2).

We still need to place O somewhere. O can be in positions 1, 4 (it cannot be in 2 or 3 or 5).

Let’s list possible 5-letter words matching _ _ I _ S with O in 1 or 4, and using only allowed letters:

Possible words:
- O _ I _ S → O, _, I, _, S
  - OPIKS → invalid (K is allowed, but word not common)
  - OPENS → invalid (N is out)
  - OMIKS → invalid
- _ _ I O S → _, _, I, O, S
  - BRIOS → invalid (R is out)
  - CHIOS → invalid (C is out)
  - DIOGS → invalid (G is allowed, but word not common)
  - FRIOS → invalid (R is out)
  - GRIOS → invalid (R is out)
  - HUMPS → invalid (T is out, but H, U, M, P, S are allowed, but word not matching)
  - KILOS → invalid (L is out)
  - MIMES → invalid (E is out)
  - PIVOTS → invalid (T is out)
  - WISPS → invalid (T is out)
  - VIGIL → invalid (L is out)

Looking at common words, one that fits is “PIKES” but E is out. Another is “WISPS” but T is out. A valid word with O in position 4 is “HUMPS” but it doesn’t fit the pattern.

Wait, let’s systematically list 5-letter words with O in 1 or 4, I in 3, S in 5:

- O _ I _ S → O, _, I, _, S
  - O, P, I, K, S → “OPIKS” – not a common word.
  - O, V, I, D, S → “OVIDS” – not common.
  - O, B, I, D, S → “OBIDS” – not common.

- _ _ I O S → _, _, I, O, S
  - B, I, O, S → “BIOS” – not 5 letters.
  - D, I, O, S → “DIOS” – not common.
  - F, I, O, S → “FIOS” – not common.
  - G, I, O, S → “GIOS” – not common.
  - H, I, O, S → “HIOS” – not common.
  - K, I, O, S → “KIOS” – not common.
  - M, I, O, S → “MIOS” – not common.
  - P, I, O, S → “PIOS” – not common.
  - V, I, O, S → “VIOS” – not common.
  - W, I, O, S → “WIOS” – not common.

Hmm, none of these are common words. Maybe I missed some letters.

Let me re-examine allowed letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus O, I, S).

A common word fitting _ _ I _ S with O in position 4 is “VOGUS” – but G and U are allowed, but this isn’t a common word.

Wait, let’s try “DOING” again? But we already ruled that out.

Another approach: list all 5-letter words ending in “IS” with I in 3 and S in 5, and containing O somewhere else.

Valid candidates:
- “VOGUS” – not common.
- “BOGUS” – not common.
- “DOGIS” – not common.
- “FOGIS” – not common.

Wait, let me think of “POSIX” – but X is allowed, but this is uncommon.

Actually, a common word fitting _ _ I _ S with O in position 4 is “HUMPS” – but it’s 5 letters: H, U, M, P, T, but T is out. So no.

Another: “GUMPS” – G, U, M, P, S – but S is in 5, I is in 3 – fits pattern: G U I O S – but O would be in 4, which is allowed.

GUMPS is a valid word and uses allowed letters (G, U, M, P, S).

Let me check constraints:
- Letters: G, U, M, P, S
- S is in 5 (✓)
- I is in 3 (✓)
- O is in 4 (allowed, since O was wrong only in 2 and 3, and 4 is new)
- No forbidden letters (A, R, E, T, C, L, N) are used.

GUMPS seems valid.
