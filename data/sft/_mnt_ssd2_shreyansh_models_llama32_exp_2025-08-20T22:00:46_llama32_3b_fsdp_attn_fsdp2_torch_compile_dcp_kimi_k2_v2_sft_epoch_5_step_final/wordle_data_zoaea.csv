### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word, whether they're in the correct position or just present in the word.

- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.

1. Contains A, O, E (each exactly once, since no repeats indicated).
2. Does NOT contain R or S.
3. Places A, O, E in positions they haven’t been ruled out for.

Let’s try a word that shifts A, O, E to new positions and fills the remaining two slots with other common letters that haven’t been eliminated (e.g., T, N, L, I, etc.).

A good candidate is “OCEAN”:
- O is now in position 1 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of position 3).
- C and N are new letters.
- E is now in position 4 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of position 5).
- A is now in position 5 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of position 1).

Summary of constraints so far:

- Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, S, C, N.
- Positional exclusions:
  – A ≠ 1, 4
  – O ≠ 1, 3
  – E ≠ 3, 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A, O, E once each.
- Does NOT use R, S, C, N.
- Places A, O, E only in positions they are allowed for.

Let’s list possible positions for each of A, O, E:
A: allowed in 2, 3, 5
O: allowed in 2, 4, 5
E: allowed in 1, 2, 4

To cover all three letters, one common pattern is to place them in positions 2, 4, 5 and fill the remaining two slots with other allowed letters (e.g., T, L, I, D, M, etc.) that haven’t been ruled out.

Let’s try:
- Position 1: E (allowed)
- Position 2: A (allowed)
- Position 3: O (allowed)
- Positions 4 & 5: need two new letters. Good candidates: T and I (both still allowed).

Word formed: E A O T I → “EATOI” is not a valid English word.

Next try:
- Position 1: O (allowed)
- Position 2: E (allowed)
- Position 3: A (allowed)
- Positions 4 & 5: need two new letters. Good candidates: T and I.

Word formed: O E A T I → “O E A T I” → “OATI” is not valid.

Next try:

- Position 2: O (allowed)
- Position 3: A (allowed)
- Positions 4 & 5: need two new letters. Good candidates: T and I.

Word formed: E O A T I → “EOATI” is not valid.

Let’s try a known valid 5-letter word that satisfies the constraints:
“TOADY” – but Y is less common and we’ve already ruled out many consonants.

“LEAPT” – contains R (already ruled out).

“BEACH” – contains C (ruled out).

“PEACH” – contains C (ruled out).

“MEANT” – contains N (ruled out).

“DEATH” – contains H (still allowed) and is a valid word.

Check constraints for DEATH:
- Letters: D, E, A, T, H
- Contains A, E, T (but T isn’t ruled out yet) – but we need A, O, E. So DEATH is invalid because it lacks O.

We must include all three of A, O, E.

Let’s try “OCEAN” again as it was suggested, but it was already used in OCEAN.

Wait, we can use “OCEAN” twice? No, feedback indicates each letter only once.

Another approach: place A, O, E in positions 2, 4, 5 and fill 1,3 with new letters.

- Contains A, O, E.
- Positions:
  – O is in 1 – but feedback says O is not in 1 (from OCEAN). So OATIE is invalid.

We need O ≠ 1, A ≠ 1,4, E ≠ 3,5.

Try “TALON” – contains N (ruled out).

Try “TALKE” – contains K (allowed) but E is in 5 – which is ruled out.

Try “TALOE” – contains O in 3 (ruled out).

Try “PATIO” – contains P (allowed) and I (allowed), but O is in 2 (allowed), A in 3 (allowed), E in 5 (ruled out).

Try “PATIO” – E in 5 is invalid.

Try “OATEN” – N is invalid.

Try “OATIE” – O in 1 is invalid.

Try “EATOP” – contains P (allowed), E in 1 (allowed), A in 2 (allowed), T in 3 (allowed), O in 4 (allowed). This is valid.

EATOP:
- E (position 1) – allowed (E ≠ 3,5)
- A (position 2) – allowed (A ≠ 1,4)
- T (position 3) – new letter, allowed

We need O ≠ 1, A ≠ 1,4, E ≠ 3,5.

Try “TALON” – contains N (ruled out).

Try “TALKE” – contains K (allowed) but E is in 5 – which is ruled out.

Try “TALOE” – contains O in 3 (ruled out).

Try “PATIO” – contains P (allowed) and I (allowed), but O is in 2 (allowed), A in 3 (allowed), E in 5 (ruled out).

Try “PATIO” – E in 5 is invalid.

Try “OATEN” – N is invalid.

Try “OATIE” – O in 1 is invalid.

Try “EATOP” – contains P (allowed), E in 1 (allowed), A in 2 (allowed), T in 3 (allowed), O in 4 (allowed). This is valid.

EATOP:
- E (position 1) – allowed (E ≠ 3,5)
- A (position 2) – allowed (A ≠ 1,4)
- T (position 3) – new letter, allowed
- O (position 4) – allowed (O ≠ 1,3)
- P – new letter, allowed

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word, whether they're in the correct position or just present in the word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, S
- Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong positions): A, O, E
- Positions these letters cannot occupy: A ≠ 1, O ≠ 3, E ≠ 5.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, O, E (each exactly once, since no repeats indicated).
2. Does NOT contain R or S.
3. Places A, O, E in positions they haven’t been ruled out for.

Let’s try a word that shifts A, O, E to new positions and fills the remaining two slots with other common letters that haven’t been eliminated (e.g., T, N, L, I, etc.).

A good candidate is “OCEAN”:
- O is now in position 1 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of position 3).
- C and N are new letters.
- E is now in position 4 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of position 5).
- A is now in position 5 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of position 1).

This placement satisfies all constraints.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: OCEAN -> FEEDBACK: O(-) C(x) E(-) A(-) N(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
   - A, O, E are in the word but not in positions 1, 3, 5 respectively.
   - R and S are not in the word.

2. OCEAN → O(-) C(x) E(-) A(-) N(x)
   - O is not in position 1.
   - E is not in position 3.
   - A is not in position 4.
   - C and N are not in the word.

Summary of constraints so far:
- Letters known to be in the word: A, O, E (each exactly once).
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, S, C, N.
- Positional exclusions:
  – A ≠ 1, 4
  – O ≠ 1, 3
  – E ≠ 3, 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A, O, E once each.
- Does NOT use R, S, C, N.
- Places A, O, E only in positions they are allowed for.

Let’s list possible positions for each of A, O, E:
A: allowed in 2, 3, 5
O: allowed in 2, 4, 5
E: allowed in 1, 2, 4

To cover all three letters, one common pattern is to place them in positions 2, 4, 5 and fill the remaining two slots with other allowed letters (e.g., T, L, I, D, M, etc.) that haven’t been ruled out.

Let’s try:
- Position 1: E (allowed)
- Position 2: A (allowed)
- Position 3: O (allowed)
- Positions 4 & 5: need two new letters. Good candidates: T and I (both still allowed).

Word formed: E A O T I → “EATOI” is not a valid English word.

Next try:
- Position 1: O (allowed)
- Position 2: E (allowed)
- Position 3: A (allowed)
- Positions 4 & 5: need two new letters. Good candidates: T and I.

Word formed: O E A T I → “O E A T I” → “OATI” is not valid.

Next try:
- Position 1: E (allowed)
- Position 2: O (allowed)
- Position 3: A (allowed)
- Positions 4 & 5: need two new letters. Good candidates: T and I.

Word formed: E O A T I → “EOATI” is not valid.

Let’s try a known valid 5-letter word that satisfies the constraints:
“TOADY” – but Y is less common and we’ve already ruled out many consonants.

“LEAPT” – contains R (already ruled out).

“BEACH” – contains C (ruled out).

“PEACH” – contains C (ruled out).

“MEANT” – contains N (ruled out).

“DEATH” – contains H (still allowed) and is a valid word.

Check constraints for DEATH:
- Letters: D, E, A, T, H
- Contains A, E, T (but T isn’t ruled out yet) – but we need A, O, E. So DEATH is invalid because it lacks O.

We must include all three of A, O, E.

Let’s try “OCEAN” again as it was suggested, but it was already used in OCEAN.

Wait, we can use “OCEAN” twice? No, feedback indicates each letter only once.

Another approach: place A, O, E in positions 2, 4, 5 and fill 1,3 with new letters.

Let’s try:
- Position 1: T (allowed)
- Position 2: A (allowed)
- Position 3: O (allowed)
- Position 4: E (allowed)
- Position 5: T (allowed)

Word: T A O E T → “TAOET” – not valid.

Try:
- Position 1: T
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: E

Word: T O A T E → “TOATE” – not valid.

Try “OATEN” – contains N (ruled out).

Try “OATIE” – contains I (allowed) and is a valid word.

Check OATIE:
- Letters: O, A, T, I, E
- Contains A, O, E.
- Positions:
  – O is in 1 – but feedback says O is not in 1 (from OCEAN). So OATIE is invalid.

We need O ≠ 1, A ≠ 1,4, E ≠ 3,5.

Try “TALON” – contains N (ruled out).

Try “TALKE” – contains K (allowed) but E is in 5 – which is ruled out.

Try “TALOE” – contains O in 3 (ruled out).

Try “PATIO” – contains P (allowed) and I (allowed), but O is in 2 (allowed), A in 3 (allowed), E in 5 (ruled out).

Try “PATIO” – E in 5 is invalid.

Try “OATEN” – N is invalid.

Try “OATIE” – O in 1 is invalid.

Try “EATOP” – contains P (allowed), E in 1 (allowed), A in 2 (allowed), T in 3 (allowed), O in 4 (allowed). This is valid.

EATOP:
- E (position 1) – allowed (E ≠ 3,5)
- A (position 2) – allowed (A ≠ 1,4)
- T (position 3) – new letter, allowed
- O (position 4) – allowed (O ≠ 1,3)
- P – new letter, allowed

This satisfies all constraints.

Let’s use EATOP.

Let’s consolidate all the constraints we now have:

Letters known to be in the word:
- A, O, E (each exactly once)

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
- R, S, C, N, T, P

Positional exclusions:
- A: cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4
- O: cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4
- E: cannot be in positions 3, 5

Therefore:
- A must be in position 3 or 5
- O must be in position 2 or 5
- E must be in position 1, 2 or 4

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, O, E each once.
2. Does NOT contain R, S, C, N, T, P.
3. Places A, O, E only in allowed positions.

Let’s list the remaining possible positions for each:

A: 3 or 5
O: 2 or 5
E: 1, 2, 4

We need to place A, O, E without overlap and fill the remaining two slots with letters not yet ruled out (allowed: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Let’s try to place A, O, E:

Case 1: A is in 3
- O must be in 2 or 5
- E must be in 1 or 4

Subcase 1a: O in 2, E in 1
Word structure: E O A _ _
Positions left: 4, 5
Need two new letters, but we only have one slot left! That’s impossible – we need 5 letters. So this can’t work.

Subcase 1b: O in 2, E in 4
Word structure: _ O A E _
Positions left: 1, 5
We need one more letter. Possible word: “DOAE_” – but that’s not valid.

Subcase 1c: O in 5, E in 1
Word structure: E _ A _ O
Positions left: 2, 4
Need two letters. Possible word: E D A V O – not valid.

Subcase 1d: A in 5, O in 2, E in 4
Word structure: _ O _ E A
Positions left: 1, 3
Need two letters. Possible word: B O D E A – not valid.

Case 2: A is in 5
- O must be in 2 or 5 (but 5 is taken by A), so O in 2
- E must be in 1 or 4
- O in 2, A in 5, E in 1 or 4:
  – E O _ _ A: E in 1 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed), A in 5 (allowed)
  – _ O E _ A: E in 3 (ruled out) – invalid

  – E O _ _ A: valid
  – _ O _ E A: E in 4 (allowed), but then O is in 2 (allowed), A in 5 (allowed)

So possible patterns:
1. E O _ _ A
2. _ O _ E A

Let’s explore pattern 1: E O _ _ A
Need two letters for positions 3 and 4 from remaining allowed letters (B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Try E O B L A – not a word.
E O D I A – not a word.
E O M I A – not a word.
E O L I A – not a word.

Try pattern 2: _ O _ E A
Need letters for positions 1 and 3.
Let’s pick common letters: D, L, M, B, G, H, I, K, etc.

Try D O L E A – not a word.
B O L E A – not a word.
M O D E A – not a word.
H O L E A – not a word.

Wait, let’s list known valid 5-letter words that contain A, O, E and avoid the forbidden letters.

Valid English words containing A, O, E and avoiding R,S,C,N,T,P:
- OATEN – N is invalid
- OATIE – I is allowed, but O in 1 (invalid), A in 2 (invalid), E in 5 (invalid)
- EATEN – N is invalid
- EAGER – R is invalid
- BOGIE – contains B, I, G, but lacks O
- DOLEA – contains D, L, E, A, O – but A is in 3 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed)
  - D O L E A
  - Check constraints:
    – Contains A, O, E – yes
    – No R,S,C,N,T,P – yes
    – Positions:
      – A is in 3 (allowed)
      – O is in 2 (allowed)
      – E is in 4 (allowed)
    – Letters D, L are new and allowed

DOLEA is a valid English word.

Another candidate: “MOLEA” – but M, L, E, A, O
Check constraints:
- M, L allowed
- A in 3 (allowed)
- O in 5 (allowed)
- E in 4 (allowed)
- No forbidden letters

MOLEA is also valid.

Between DOLEA and MOLEA, both fit. Let’s pick one.

I’ll choose “DOLEA” as it’s a known word and covers all constraints.

Check:
- D O L E A
- Contains A, O, E
- No R,S,C,N,T,P
- A in 3 (allowed)
- O in 2 (allowed)
- E in 4 (allowed)

This is safe.

  – _ O _ E A: E in 4 (allowed), but then O is in 2 (allowed), A in 5 (allowed)

So possible patterns:
1. E O _ _ A
2. _ O _ E A

Let’s explore pattern 1: E O _ _ A
Need two letters for positions 3 and 4 from remaining allowed letters (B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Try E O B L A – not a word.
E O D I A – not a word.
E O M I A – not a word.
E O L I A – not a word.

Try pattern 2: _ O _ E A
Need letters for positions 1 and 3.
Let’s pick common letters: D, L, M, B, G, H, I, K, etc.

Try D O L E A – not a word.
B O L E A – not a word.
M O D E A – not a word.
H O L E A – not a word.

Wait, let’s list known valid 5-letter words that contain A, O, E and avoid the forbidden letters.

Valid English words containing A, O, E and avoiding R,S,C,N,T,P:
- OATEN – N is invalid
- OATIE – I is allowed, but O in 1 (invalid), A in 2 (invalid), E in 5 (invalid)
- EATEN – N is invalid
- EAGER – R is invalid
- BOGIE – contains B, I, G, but lacks O
- DOLEA – contains D, L, E, A, O – but A is in 3 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed)
  - D O L E A
  - Check constraints:
    – Contains A, O, E – yes
    – No R,S,C,N,T,P – yes
    – Positions:
      – A is in 3 (allowed)
      – O is in 2 (allowed)
      – E is in 4 (allowed)
    – Letters D, L are new and allowed

DOLEA is a valid English word.

Another candidate: “MOLEA” – but M, L, E, A, O
Check constraints:
- M, L allowed
- A in 3 (allowed)
- O in 5 (allowed)
- E in 4 (allowed)
- No forbidden letters

MOLEA is also valid.

Between DOLEA and MOLEA, both fit. Let’s pick one.

I’ll choose “DOLEA” as it’s a known word and covers all constraints.

Check:
- D O L E A
- Contains A, O, E
- No R,S,C,N,T,P
- A in 3 (allowed)
- O in 2 (allowed)
- E in 4 (allowed)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word, whether they're in the correct position or just present in the word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, S
- Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong positions): A, O, E
- Positions these letters cannot occupy: A ≠ 1, O ≠ 3, E ≠ 5.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, O, E (each exactly once, since no repeats indicated).
2. Does NOT contain R or S.
3. Places A, O, E in positions they haven’t been ruled out for.

Let’s try a word that shifts A, O, E to new positions and fills the remaining two slots with other common letters that haven’t been eliminated (e.g., T, N, L, I, etc.).

A good candidate is “OCEAN”:
- O is now in position 1 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of position 3).
- C and N are new letters.
- E is now in position 4 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of position 5).
- A is now in position 5 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of position 1).

This placement satisfies all constraints.

<guess>OCEAN</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: OCEAN -> FEEDBACK: O(-) C(x) E(-) A(-) N(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
   - A, O, E are in the word but not in positions 1, 3, 5 respectively.
   - R and S are not in the word.

2. OCEAN → O(-) C(x) E(-) A(-) N(x)
   - O is not in position 1.
   - E is not in position 3.
   - A is not in position 4.
   - C and N are not in the word.

Summary of constraints so far:
- Letters known to be in the word: A, O, E (each exactly once).
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, S, C, N.
- Positional exclusions:
  – A ≠ 1, 4
  – O ≠ 1, 3
  – E ≠ 3, 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A, O, E once each.
- Does NOT use R, S, C, N.
- Places A, O, E only in positions they are allowed for.

Let’s list possible positions for each of A, O, E:
A: allowed in 2, 3, 5
O: allowed in 2, 4, 5
E: allowed in 1, 2, 4

To cover all three letters, one common pattern is to place them in positions 2, 4, 5 and fill the remaining two slots with other allowed letters (e.g., T, L, I, D, M, etc.) that haven’t been ruled out.

Let’s try:
- Position 1: E (allowed)
- Position 2: A (allowed)
- Position 3: O (allowed)
- Positions 4 & 5: need two new letters. Good candidates: T and I (both still allowed).

Word formed: E A O T I → “EATOI” is not a valid English word.

Next try:
- Position 1: O (allowed)
- Position 2: E (allowed)
- Position 3: A (allowed)
- Positions 4 & 5: need two new letters. Good candidates: T and I.

Word formed: O E A T I → “O E A T I” → “OATI” is not valid.

Next try:
- Position 1: E (allowed)
- Position 2: O (allowed)
- Position 3: A (allowed)
- Positions 4 & 5: need two new letters. Good candidates: T and I.

Word formed: E O A T I → “EOATI” is not valid.

Let’s try a known valid 5-letter word that satisfies the constraints:
“TOADY” – but Y is less common and we’ve already ruled out many consonants.

“LEAPT” – contains R (already ruled out).

“BEACH” – contains C (ruled out).

“PEACH” – contains C (ruled out).

“MEANT” – contains N (ruled out).

“DEATH” – contains H (still allowed) and is a valid word.

Check constraints for DEATH:
- Letters: D, E, A, T, H
- Contains A, E, T (but T isn’t ruled out yet) – but we need A, O, E. So DEATH is invalid because it lacks O.

We must include all three of A, O, E.

Let’s try “OCEAN” again as it was suggested, but it was already used in OCEAN.

Wait, we can use “OCEAN” twice? No, feedback indicates each letter only once.

Another approach: place A, O, E in positions 2, 4, 5 and fill 1,3 with new letters.

Let’s try:
- Position 1: T (allowed)
- Position 2: A (allowed)
- Position 3: O (allowed)
- Position 4: E (allowed)
- Position 5: T (allowed)

Word: T A O E T → “TAOET” – not valid.

Try:
- Position 1: T
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: E

Word: T O A T E → “TOATE” – not valid.

Try “OATEN” – contains N (ruled out).

Try “OATIE” – contains I (allowed) and is a valid word.

Check OATIE:
- Letters: O, A, T, I, E
- Contains A, O, E.
- Positions:
  – O is in 1 – but feedback says O is not in 1 (from OCEAN). So OATIE is invalid.

We need O ≠ 1, A ≠ 1,4, E ≠ 3,5.

Try “TALON” – contains N (ruled out).

Try “TALKE” – contains K (allowed) but E is in 5 – which is ruled out.

Try “TALOE” – contains O in 3 (ruled out).

Try “PATIO” – contains P (allowed) and I (allowed), but O is in 2 (allowed), A in 3 (allowed), E in 5 (ruled out).

Try “PATIO” – E in 5 is invalid.

Try “OATEN” – N is invalid.

Try “OATIE” – O in 1 is invalid.

Try “EATOP” – contains P (allowed), E in 1 (allowed), A in 2 (allowed), T in 3 (allowed), O in 4 (allowed). This is valid.

EATOP:
- E (position 1) – allowed (E ≠ 3,5)
- A (position 2) – allowed (A ≠ 1,4)
- T (position 3) – new letter, allowed
- O (position 4) – allowed (O ≠ 1,3)
- P – new letter, allowed

This satisfies all constraints.

Let’s use EATOP.

<guess>EATOP</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: OCEAN -> FEEDBACK: O(-) C(x) E(-) A(-) N(x)
Guess 3: EATOP -> FEEDBACK: E(-) A(-) T(x) O(-) P(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let’s consolidate all the constraints we now have:

Letters known to be in the word:
- A, O, E (each exactly once)

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
- R, S, C, N, T, P

Positional exclusions:
- A: cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4
- O: cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4
- E: cannot be in positions 3, 5

Therefore:
- A must be in position 3 or 5
- O must be in position 2 or 5
- E must be in position 1, 2 or 4

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, O, E each once.
2. Does NOT contain R, S, C, N, T, P.
3. Places A, O, E only in allowed positions.

Let’s list the remaining possible positions for each:

A: 3 or 5
O: 2 or 5
E: 1, 2, 4

We need to place A, O, E without overlap and fill the remaining two slots with letters not yet ruled out (allowed: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Let’s try to place A, O, E:

Case 1: A is in 3
- O must be in 2 or 5
- E must be in 1 or 4

Subcase 1a: O in 2, E in 1
Word structure: E O A _ _
Positions left: 4, 5
Need two new letters, but we only have one slot left! That’s impossible – we need 5 letters. So this can’t work.

Subcase 1b: O in 2, E in 4
Word structure: _ O A E _
Positions left: 1, 5
We need one more letter. Possible word: “DOAE_” – but that’s not valid.

Subcase 1c: O in 5, E in 1
Word structure: E _ A _ O
Positions left: 2, 4
Need two letters. Possible word: E D A V O – not valid.

Subcase 1d: A in 5, O in 2, E in 4
Word structure: _ O _ E A
Positions left: 1, 3
Need two letters. Possible word: B O D E A – not valid.

Case 2: A is in 5
- O must be in 2 or 5 (but 5 is taken by A), so O in 2
- E must be in 1 or 4
- O in 2, A in 5, E in 1 or 4:
  – E O _ _ A: E in 1 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed), A in 5 (allowed)
  – _ O E _ A: E in 3 (ruled out) – invalid

  – E O _ _ A: valid
  – _ O _ E A: E in 4 (allowed), but then O is in 2 (allowed), A in 5 (allowed)

So possible patterns:
1. E O _ _ A
2. _ O _ E A

Let’s explore pattern 1: E O _ _ A
Need two letters for positions 3 and 4 from remaining allowed letters (B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Try E O B L A – not a word.
E O D I A – not a word.
E O M I A – not a word.
E O L I A – not a word.

Try pattern 2: _ O _ E A
Need letters for positions 1 and 3.
Let’s pick common letters: D, L, M, B, G, H, I, K, etc.

Try D O L E A – not a word.
B O L E A – not a word.
M O D E A – not a word.
H O L E A – not a word.

Wait, let’s list known valid 5-letter words that contain A, O, E and avoid the forbidden letters.

Valid English words containing A, O, E and avoiding R,S,C,N,T,P:
- OATEN – N is invalid
- OATIE – I is allowed, but O in 1 (invalid), A in 2 (invalid), E in 5 (invalid)
- EATEN – N is invalid
- EAGER – R is invalid
- BOGIE – contains B, I, G, but lacks O
- DOLEA – contains D, L, E, A, O – but A is in 3 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed)
  - D O L E A
  - Check constraints:
    – Contains A, O, E – yes
    – No R,S,C,N,T,P – yes
    – Positions:
      – A is in 3 (allowed)
      – O is in 2 (allowed)
      – E is in 4 (allowed)
    – Letters D, L are new and allowed

DOLEA is a valid English word.

Another candidate: “MOLEA” – but M, L, E, A, O
Check constraints:
- M, L allowed
- A in 3 (allowed)
- O in 5 (allowed)
- E in 4 (allowed)
- No forbidden letters

MOLEA is also valid.

Between DOLEA and MOLEA, both fit. Let’s pick one.

I’ll choose “DOLEA” as it’s a known word and covers all constraints.

Check:
- D O L E A
- Contains A, O, E
- No R,S,C,N,T,P
- A in 3 (allowed)
- O in 2 (allowed)
- E in 4 (allowed)

This is safe.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word, whether they're in the correct position or just present in the word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, S
- Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong positions): A, O, E
- Positions these letters cannot occupy: A ≠ 1, O ≠ 3, E ≠ 5.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, O, E (each exactly once, since no repeats indicated).
2. Does NOT contain R or S.
3. Places A, O, E in positions they haven’t been ruled out for.

Let’s try a word that shifts A, O, E to new positions and fills the remaining two slots with other common letters that haven’t been eliminated (e.g., T, N, L, I, etc.).

A good candidate is “OCEAN”:
- O is now in position 1 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of position 3).
- C and N are new letters.
- E is now in position 4 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of position 5).
- A is now in position 5 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of position 1).

This placement satisfies all constraints.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: OCEAN -> FEEDBACK: O(-) C(x) E(-) A(-) N(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
   - A, O, E are in the word but not in positions 1, 3, 5 respectively.
   - R and S are not in the word.

2. OCEAN → O(-) C(x) E(-) A(-) N(x)
   - O is not in position 1.
   - E is not in position 3.
   - A is not in position 4.
   - C and N are not in the word.

Summary of constraints so far:
- Letters known to be in the word: A, O, E (each exactly once).
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, S, C, N.
- Positional exclusions:
  – A ≠ 1, 4
  – O ≠ 1, 3
  – E ≠ 3, 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A, O, E once each.
- Does NOT use R, S, C, N.
- Places A, O, E only in positions they are allowed for.

Let’s list possible positions for each of A, O, E:
A: allowed in 2, 3, 5
O: allowed in 2, 4, 5
E: allowed in 1, 2, 4

To cover all three letters, one common pattern is to place them in positions 2, 4, 5 and fill the remaining two slots with other allowed letters (e.g., T, L, I, D, M, etc.) that haven’t been ruled out.

Let’s try:
- Position 1: E (allowed)
- Position 2: A (allowed)
- Position 3: O (allowed)
- Positions 4 & 5: need two new letters. Good candidates: T and I (both still allowed).

Word formed: E A O T I → “EATOI” is not a valid English word.

Next try:
- Position 1: O (allowed)
- Position 2: E (allowed)
- Position 3: A (allowed)
- Positions 4 & 5: need two new letters. Good candidates: T and I.

Word formed: O E A T I → “O E A T I” → “OATI” is not valid.

Next try:
- Position 1: E (allowed)
- Position 2: O (allowed)
- Position 3: A (allowed)
- Positions 4 & 5: need two new letters. Good candidates: T and I.

Word formed: E O A T I → “EOATI” is not valid.

Let’s try a known valid 5-letter word that satisfies the constraints:
“TOADY” – but Y is less common and we’ve already ruled out many consonants.

“LEAPT” – contains R (already ruled out).

“BEACH” – contains C (ruled out).

“PEACH” – contains C (ruled out).

“MEANT” – contains N (ruled out).

“DEATH” – contains H (still allowed) and is a valid word.

Check constraints for DEATH:
- Letters: D, E, A, T, H
- Contains A, E, T (but T isn’t ruled out yet) – but we need A, O, E. So DEATH is invalid because it lacks O.

We must include all three of A, O, E.

Let’s try “OCEAN” again as it was suggested, but it was already used in OCEAN.

Wait, we can use “OCEAN” twice? No, feedback indicates each letter only once.

Another approach: place A, O, E in positions 2, 4, 5 and fill 1,3 with new letters.

Let’s try:
- Position 1: T (allowed)
- Position 2: A (allowed)
- Position 3: O (allowed)
- Position 4: E (allowed)
- Position 5: T (allowed)

Word: T A O E T → “TAOET” – not valid.

Try:
- Position 1: T
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: E

Word: T O A T E → “TOATE” – not valid.

Try “OATEN” – contains N (ruled out).

Try “OATIE” – contains I (allowed) and is a valid word.

Check OATIE:
- Letters: O, A, T, I, E
- Contains A, O, E.
- Positions:
  – O is in 1 – but feedback says O is not in 1 (from OCEAN). So OATIE is invalid.

We need O ≠ 1, A ≠ 1,4, E ≠ 3,5.

Try “TALON” – contains N (ruled out).

Try “TALKE” – contains K (allowed) but E is in 5 – which is ruled out.

Try “TALOE” – contains O in 3 (ruled out).

Try “PATIO” – contains P (allowed) and I (allowed), but O is in 2 (allowed), A in 3 (allowed), E in 5 (ruled out).

Try “PATIO” – E in 5 is invalid.

Try “OATEN” – N is invalid.

Try “OATIE” – O in 1 is invalid.

Try “EATOP” – contains P (allowed), E in 1 (allowed), A in 2 (allowed), T in 3 (allowed), O in 4 (allowed). This is valid.

EATOP:
- E (position 1) – allowed (E ≠ 3,5)
- A (position 2) – allowed (A ≠ 1,4)
- T (position 3) – new letter, allowed
- O (position 4) – allowed (O ≠ 1,3)
- P – new letter, allowed

This satisfies all constraints.

Let’s use EATOP.

<guess>EATOP</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: OCEAN -> FEEDBACK: O(-) C(x) E(-) A(-) N(x)
Guess 3: EATOP -> FEEDBACK: E(-) A(-) T(x) O(-) P(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let’s consolidate all the constraints we now have:

Letters known to be in the word:
- A, O, E (each exactly once)

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
- R, S, C, N, T, P

Positional exclusions:
- A: cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4
- O: cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4
- E: cannot be in positions 3, 5

Therefore:
- A must be in position 3 or 5
- O must be in position 2 or 5
- E must be in position 1, 2 or 4

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, O, E each once.
2. Does NOT contain R, S, C, N, T, P.
3. Places A, O, E only in allowed positions.

Let’s list the remaining possible positions for each:

A: 3 or 5
O: 2 or 5
E: 1, 2, 4

We need to place A, O, E without overlap and fill the remaining two slots with letters not yet ruled out (allowed: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Let’s try to place A, O, E:

Case 1: A is in 3
- O must be in 2 or 5
- E must be in 1 or 4

Subcase 1a: O in 2, E in 1
Word structure: E O A _ _
Positions left: 4, 5
Need two new letters, but we only have one slot left! That’s impossible – we need 5 letters. So this can’t work.

Subcase 1b: O in 2, E in 4
Word structure: _ O A E _
Positions left: 1, 5
We need one more letter. Possible word: “DOAE_” – but that’s not valid.

Subcase 1c: O in 5, E in 1
Word structure: E _ A _ O
Positions left: 2, 4
Need two letters. Possible word: E D A V O – not valid.

Subcase 1d: A in 5, O in 2, E in 4
Word structure: _ O _ E A
Positions left: 1, 3
Need two letters. Possible word: B O D E A – not valid.

Case 2: A is in 5
- O must be in 2 or 5 (but 5 is taken by A), so O in 2
- E must be in 1 or 4
- O in 2, A in 5, E in 1 or 4:
  – E O _ _ A: E in 1 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed), A in 5 (allowed)
  – _ O E _ A: E in 3 (ruled out) – invalid

  – E O _ _ A: valid
  – _ O _ E A: E in 4 (allowed), but then O is in 2 (allowed), A in 5 (allowed)

So possible patterns:
1. E O _ _ A
2. _ O _ E A

Let’s explore pattern 1: E O _ _ A
Need two letters for positions 3 and 4 from remaining allowed letters (B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Try E O B L A – not a word.
E O D I A – not a word.
E O M I A – not a word.
E O L I A – not a word.

Try pattern 2: _ O _ E A
Need letters for positions 1 and 3.
Let’s pick common letters: D, L, M, B, G, H, I, K, etc.

Try D O L E A – not a word.
B O L E A – not a word.
M O D E A – not a word.
H O L E A – not a word.

Wait, let’s list known valid 5-letter words that contain A, O, E and avoid the forbidden letters.

Valid English words containing A, O, E and avoiding R,S,C,N,T,P:
- OATEN – N is invalid
- OATIE – I is allowed, but O in 1 (invalid), A in 2 (invalid), E in 5 (invalid)
- EATEN – N is invalid
- EAGER – R is invalid
- BOGIE – contains B, I, G, but lacks O
- DOLEA – contains D, L, E, A, O – but A is in 3 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed)
  - D O L E A
  - Check constraints:
    – Contains A, O, E – yes
    – No R,S,C,N,T,P – yes
    – Positions:
      – A is in 3 (allowed)
      – O is in 2 (allowed)
      – E is in 4 (allowed)
    – Letters D, L are new and allowed

DOLEA is a valid English word.

Another candidate: “MOLEA” – but M, L, E, A, O
Check constraints:
- M, L allowed
- A in 3 (allowed)
- O in 5 (allowed)
- E in 4 (allowed)
- No forbidden letters

MOLEA is also valid.

Between DOLEA and MOLEA, both fit. Let’s pick one.

I’ll choose “DOLEA” as it’s a known word and covers all constraints.

Check:
- D O L E A
- Contains A, O, E
- No R,S,C,N,T,P
- A in 3 (allowed)
- O in 2 (allowed)
- E in 4 (allowed)

This is safe.

<guess>DOLEA</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: OCEAN -> FEEDBACK: O(-) C(x) E(-) A(-) N(x)
Guess 3: EATOP -> FEEDBACK: E(-) A(-) T(x) O(-) P(x)
Guess 4: DOLEA -> FEEDBACK: D(x) O(✓) L(x) E(✓) A(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on DOLEA:

D(x)  – D is not in the word.  
O(✓)  – O is in position 2.  
L(x)  – L is not in the word.  
E(✓)  – E is in position 4.  
A(✓)  – A is in position 5.

So we now know the exact positions for three letters:

_  O  _  E  A

Only positions 1 and 3 are unknown.  
Forbidden letters so far: R, S, C, N, T, P, D, L.  
Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has structure: ? O ? E A
- Uses only allowed letters for the blanks.

Common English words fitting ? O ? E A:
- BOGIE  (B, I, G allowed)
- COGIE  (C is forbidden)
- FOGIE  (F, I, G allowed)
- GOGIE  (G, I, G allowed)
- HOGIE  (H, I, G allowed)
- MOGIE  (M, I, G allowed)
- WOGIE  (W, I, G allowed)

Among these, “BOGIE” is a common word and uses B, I, G – all still allowed.

Check constraints:
- B, I, G not yet ruled out.  
- Structure matches _ O _ E A.

Therefore, BOGIE is a valid next guess.
