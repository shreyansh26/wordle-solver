For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains the most common letters in English (A, R, O, S, E) and covers three vowels and two common consonants. This will give us good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1, so it must be in positions 2-5).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in position 1.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A somewhere in positions 2-5.
2. Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels to try: I, U (since A is already confirmed, and O, E are ruled out).

A strong next guess would be a word that introduces several new common letters while placing A in a new position. ""PLANT"" is a good candidate:
- P, L, N, T are common consonants not yet tested.
- A is placed in position 2 (new position).
- No R, O, S, E are used.

This will give us information on P, L, N, T, and confirm the position of A.

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

2. PLANT → P(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)
   - P, N, T are not in the word.
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, P, N, T
- Letters that ARE in the word: A (must be in positions 2, 4, or 5), L (must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5)
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels.

Remaining common letters to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A (positions 2, 4, or 5)
- Contains L (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5)
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E, P, N, T
- Uses other new letters to maximize information.

Let’s try a word that places A in position 4 and L in position 1, and introduces new common consonants and a vowel. A good candidate is ""BALDY"":

- B: new consonant
- A: known to be in word, now in position 2 (but we know A can be in 2, 4, or 5; this is just an initial test)
- L: known to be in word, now in position 1 (valid per feedback)
- D, Y: new consonants

However, this might not be optimal because A is not in its allowed positions (we know A is not in 1 or 3, but this word puts it in 2 which is allowed until we learn more). The key is to ensure A is in a valid position.

Let me reconsider. A better approach is to ensure A is in a valid allowed position (2, 4, or 5) and L is in a valid allowed position (1, 3, 4, or 5).

Let’s try ""GLAND"":
- G: new
- L: in position 2 (but L cannot be in 2 per feedback from PLANT; L was in 2 and marked ""-"")
- So L cannot be in 2. Thus, let’s avoid L in 2.

Try ""LADY"":
- L: position 1 (valid)
- A: position 2 (valid, allowed)
- D, Y: new

This seems good. But let me think of a word that also tests other common letters.

""LUMBA"" is invalid (B is not in the correct position). 

""ALBUM"":
- A: position 1 (invalid, A cannot be in 1)
  
""VALID"":
- V: new
- A: position 2 (valid)
- L: position 3 (valid)
- I, D: new

This looks solid. A is in position 2 (allowed), L is in position 3 (allowed), and we test new letters V, I, D.

Thus, ""VALID"" is a strong next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

- Contains A (positions 2, 4, or 5)
- Contains L (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5)
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E, P, N, T
- Uses other new letters to maximize information.

Let’s try a word that places A in position 4 and L in position 1, and introduces new common consonants and a vowel. A good candidate is ""BALDY"":

- B: new consonant
- A: known to be in word, now in position 2 (but we know A can be in 2, 4, or 5; this is just an initial test)
- L: known to be in word, now in position 1 (valid per feedback)
- D, Y: new consonants

However, this might not be optimal because A is not in its allowed positions (we know A is not in 1 or 3, but this word puts it in 2 which is allowed until we learn more). The key is to ensure A is in a valid position.

Let me reconsider. A better approach is to ensure A is in a valid allowed position (2, 4, or 5) and L is in a valid allowed position (1, 3, 4, or 5).

Let’s try ""GLAND"":
- G: new
- L: in position 2 (but L cannot be in 2 per feedback from PLANT; L was in 2 and marked ""-"")
- So L cannot be in 2. Thus, let’s avoid L in 2.

Try ""LADY"":
- L: position 1 (valid)
- A: position 2 (valid, allowed)
- D, Y: new

This seems good. But let me think of a word that also tests other common letters.

""LUMBA"" is invalid (B is not in the correct position). 

""ALBUM"":
- A: position 1 (invalid, A cannot be in 1)
  
""VALID"":
- V: new
- A: position 2 (valid)
- L: position 3 (valid)
- I, D: new

This looks solid. A is in position 2 (allowed), L is in position 3 (allowed), and we test new letters V, I, D.

Thus, ""VALID"" is a strong next guess.

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   – A is in the word, but not in position 1.
   – R, O, S, E are not in the word.

2. PLANT → P(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)
   – P, N, T are not in the word.
   – L is in the word but not in position 2.
   – A is in the word but not in position 3.

3. VALID → V(x) A(✓) L(-) I(x) D(x)
   – V, I, D are not in the word.
   – A is now fixed in position 2 (A ✓).
   – L is in the word but not in position 3.

So we now know:
- Word pattern: _ A _ _ _
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, P, N, T, V, I, D
- Letters confirmed in word: A (position 2), L (somewhere else: positions 1, 4, or 5)
- Remaining common letters to test: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, U, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2.
- Has L in position 1, 4, or 5.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Candidate letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, U, W, Y (plus L and A already placed).

A good next word is ""CABLE"":
- C: new
- A: position 2 (known correct)
- B: new
- L: position 4 (valid, since L cannot be in 2 or 3)
- E: but E is ruled out (from AROSE feedback) – so CABLE is invalid.

- A: position 2
- D: but D is ruled out – invalid.

Next try ""GAMBY"":
- G: new
- A: position 2

- But L must be included – so GAMBY is invalid (no L).

We must include L. Let’s try ""LUMPY"":

Try ""HALVE"":

- F: new
- A: position 2

- O: but O is ruled out – invalid.

Try ""LUMBA"" – invalid (B is not correct).

Try ""LUMPS"" – invalid (P is ruled out).

Try ""LAMBY"":
- L: position 1
- A: position 2
- M: new
- B: new
- Y: new
- But we need to include L in 1, 4, or 5 – LAMBY has L in 1, A in 2, M in 3, B in 4, Y in 5. This seems valid.

Wait, let’s list valid positions for A and L:
- A must be in positions 2, 4, or 5 (from AROSE and PLANT/VALID).
- L must be in positions 1, 4, or 5 (from PLANT and VALID).

A good word would place A in 2 and L in 1, 4, or 5, while testing new letters.

Try ""LACED"" – invalid (E is ruled out).

Try ""LUMBA"" – invalid (O is ruled out).

Try ""LAMBY"" – valid:
- L: position 1 (valid)
- A: position 2 (valid)
- M: new
- B: new
- Y: new

This seems the best available option.

Another option is ""CAMEL"":
- C: new
- A: position 2
- M: new
- E: but E is ruled out – invalid.

Another option is ""GAMMA"":
- G: new
- A: position 2
- M: new
- M: new
- A: position 5 (valid)
- But L must be included – GAMMA does not include L.

We must include L. Thus, ""LAMBY"" is the most plausible next guess.

But let me think of a word that places A in 2 and L in 4 or 5, and uses new letters.

Try ""CABAL"":
- C: new
- A: position 2
- B: new
- A: position 4 (valid)
- L: position 5 (valid)

This seems better: CABAL includes L in 5, A in 2, and tests C, B.

Let me verify:
- CABAL: C A B A L
- Letters: C, A, B, A, L
- Ruled out letters: R, O, S, E, P, N, T, V, I, D – none of these are used.
- A is in position 2 (✓)
- L is in position 5 (valid)
- B is new, C is new.

This seems optimal.

Thus, the next guess is CABAL.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains the most common letters in English (A, R, O, S, E) and covers three vowels and two common consonants. This will give us good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1, so it must be in positions 2-5).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in position 1.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A somewhere in positions 2-5.
2. Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels to try: I, U (since A is already confirmed, and O, E are ruled out).

A strong next guess would be a word that introduces several new common letters while placing A in a new position. ""PLANT"" is a good candidate:
- P, L, N, T are common consonants not yet tested.
- A is placed in position 2 (new position).
- No R, O, S, E are used.

This will give us information on P, L, N, T, and confirm the position of A.

<guess>PLANT</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Guess 2: PLANT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

2. PLANT → P(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)
   - P, N, T are not in the word.
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, P, N, T
- Letters that ARE in the word: A (must be in positions 2, 4, or 5), L (must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5)
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels.

Remaining common letters to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A (positions 2, 4, or 5)
- Contains L (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5)
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E, P, N, T
- Uses other new letters to maximize information.

Let’s try a word that places A in position 4 and L in position 1, and introduces new common consonants and a vowel. A good candidate is ""BALDY"":

- B: new consonant
- A: known to be in word, now in position 2 (but we know A can be in 2, 4, or 5; this is just an initial test)
- L: known to be in word, now in position 1 (valid per feedback)
- D, Y: new consonants

However, this might not be optimal because A is not in its allowed positions (we know A is not in 1 or 3, but this word puts it in 2 which is allowed until we learn more). The key is to ensure A is in a valid position.

Let me reconsider. A better approach is to ensure A is in a valid allowed position (2, 4, or 5) and L is in a valid allowed position (1, 3, 4, or 5).

Let’s try ""GLAND"":
- G: new
- L: in position 2 (but L cannot be in 2 per feedback from PLANT; L was in 2 and marked ""-"")
- So L cannot be in 2. Thus, let’s avoid L in 2.

Try ""LADY"":
- L: position 1 (valid)
- A: position 2 (valid, allowed)
- D, Y: new

This seems good. But let me think of a word that also tests other common letters.

""LUMBA"" is invalid (B is not in the correct position). 

""ALBUM"":
- A: position 1 (invalid, A cannot be in 1)
  
""VALID"":
- V: new
- A: position 2 (valid)
- L: position 3 (valid)
- I, D: new

This looks solid. A is in position 2 (allowed), L is in position 3 (allowed), and we test new letters V, I, D.

Thus, ""VALID"" is a strong next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLANT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)
Guess 3: VALID -> FEEDBACK: V(x) A(✓) L(-) I(x) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   – A is in the word, but not in position 1.
   – R, O, S, E are not in the word.

2. PLANT → P(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)
   – P, N, T are not in the word.
   – L is in the word but not in position 2.
   – A is in the word but not in position 3.

3. VALID → V(x) A(✓) L(-) I(x) D(x)
   – V, I, D are not in the word.
   – A is now fixed in position 2 (A ✓).
   – L is in the word but not in position 3.

So we now know:
- Word pattern: _ A _ _ _
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, P, N, T, V, I, D
- Letters confirmed in word: A (position 2), L (somewhere else: positions 1, 4, or 5)
- Remaining common letters to test: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, U, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2.
- Has L in position 1, 4, or 5.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Candidate letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, U, W, Y (plus L and A already placed).

A good next word is ""CABLE"":
- C: new
- A: position 2 (known correct)
- B: new
- L: position 4 (valid, since L cannot be in 2 or 3)
- E: but E is ruled out (from AROSE feedback) – so CABLE is invalid.

Next try ""MADLY"":
- M: new
- A: position 2
- D: but D is ruled out – invalid.

Next try ""HABIT"":
- H: new
- A: position 2
- B: new
- I: but I is ruled out – invalid.

Next try ""GAMBY"":
- G: new
- A: position 2
- M: new
- B: new
- Y: new
- But L must be included – so GAMBY is invalid (no L).

We must include L. Let’s try ""LUMPY"":
- L: position 1 (valid)
- U: new
- M: new
- P: but P is ruled out – invalid.

Try ""LACED"":
- L: position 1
- A: position 2
- C: new
- E: but E is ruled out – invalid.

Try ""LAMPS"":
- L: position 1
- A: position 2
- M: new
- P: but P is ruled out – invalid.

Try ""HALVE"":
- H: new
- A: position 2
- L: position 3 – but L cannot be in 3 (from VALID feedback L was in 3 and marked ""-""). So HALVE is invalid.

Try ""GALAX"":
- G: new
- A: position 2
- L: position 3 – again invalid (L cannot be in 3).

Try ""FALLY"":
- F: new
- A: position 2
- L: position 3 – again invalid.

Try ""CLAMP"":
- C: new
- A: position 2
- L: position 3 – again invalid.

We need L in position 1, 4, or 5. Let’s try ""LUMBA"" – but B is not in the correct position.

Try ""LUMPS"":
- L: position 1
- U: new
- M: new
- P: but P is ruled out – invalid.

Try ""LUMEN"":
- L: position 1
- U: new
- M: new
- E: but E is ruled out – invalid.

Try ""LUMBO"":
- L: position 1
- U: new
- M: new
- B: new
- O: but O is ruled out – invalid.

Try ""LUMBA"" – invalid (B is not correct).

Try ""LUMPS"" – invalid (P is ruled out).

Try ""LAMBY"":
- L: position 1
- A: position 2
- M: new
- B: new
- Y: new
- But we need to include L in 1, 4, or 5 – LAMBY has L in 1, A in 2, M in 3, B in 4, Y in 5. This seems valid.

Wait, let’s list valid positions for A and L:
- A must be in positions 2, 4, or 5 (from AROSE and PLANT/VALID).
- L must be in positions 1, 4, or 5 (from PLANT and VALID).

A good word would place A in 2 and L in 1, 4, or 5, while testing new letters.

Try ""LACED"" – invalid (E is ruled out).

Try ""LUMBA"" – invalid (O is ruled out).

Try ""LAMBY"" – valid:
- L: position 1 (valid)
- A: position 2 (valid)
- M: new
- B: new
- Y: new

This seems the best available option.

Another option is ""CAMEL"":
- C: new
- A: position 2
- M: new
- E: but E is ruled out – invalid.

Another option is ""GAMMA"":
- G: new
- A: position 2
- M: new
- M: new
- A: position 5 (valid)
- But L must be included – GAMMA does not include L.

We must include L. Thus, ""LAMBY"" is the most plausible next guess.

But let me think of a word that places A in 2 and L in 4 or 5, and uses new letters.

Try ""CABAL"":
- C: new
- A: position 2
- B: new
- A: position 4 (valid)
- L: position 5 (valid)

This seems better: CABAL includes L in 5, A in 2, and tests C, B.

Let me verify:
- CABAL: C A B A L
- Letters: C, A, B, A, L
- Ruled out letters: R, O, S, E, P, N, T, V, I, D – none of these are used.
- A is in position 2 (✓)
- L is in position 5 (valid)
- B is new, C is new.

This seems optimal.

Thus, the next guess is CABAL.

Let’s consolidate what we now know.

Letters NOT in the word (✗):
R, O, S, E, P, N, T, V, I, D, C, B

Letters that ARE in the word (–):
A (must appear at least once, and is now fixed in position 2 from VALID feedback)
L (must appear at least once, and is not in positions 2, 3, 5; so L must be in position 1 or 4)

Current word skeleton (underscore = unknown):
_ A _ _ _

From feedback:
- A is locked in position 2.
- L must be in position 1 or 4.
- Remaining letters to test (not yet ruled out): F, G, H, K, M, U, W, Y, plus a second A or L.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A in position 2.
2. Has L in position 1 or 4.
3. Uses only letters not on the ✗ list.
4. Maximizes new-letter coverage.

Option 1: L in position 1 → L A _ _ _
   Candidate: LAMMY → uses M, Y (both still valid)
   Candidate: LAGUM → uses G, U (but U might be better tested later)

Option 2: L in position 4 → _ A _ L _
   Candidate: FABLE → but B is ✗
   Candidate: GABLE → B is ✗
   Candidate: HABLE → not a valid word
   Candidate: MANGY → but N is ✗
   Candidate: GUMMY → but M is ok, Y is ok, but no L

Let’s pick LAMMY for Option 1. It places L in 1, A in 2, and tests M and Y (both still allowed).

Check letters:
LAMMY → L A M Y
- L: position 1 (valid)
- A: position 2 (fixed)
- M: new
- Y: new
- All letters are still allowed.

This seems the best next exploratory guess.
