- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers more of the common letters.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Pattern: _ R _ _ E  
   (R is in position 2, E is in position 5)

2. Letters already ruled out:  
   A, O, S, B, I

3. Letter D is in the word but **not** in position 4 (because D(-) in BRIDE).

Therefore D must be in position 1 or 3.

Possible candidates that satisfy:
- D in position 1 or 3
- R in position 2, E in position 5
- No A, O, S, B, I
- Only remaining letters: C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s list 5-letter words fitting _ R _ _ E with D in position 1 or 3 and no forbidden letters.

D _ _ _ E   → DR _ _ E   (but DRAMA failed, DRIFT failed, DRONE failed)  
_ R D _ E   → _ R D _ E   (e.g., FRDGE? invalid, GRDGE? invalid, PRDGE? invalid)

So the only viable pattern is _ R D _ E.

Searching my mental lexicon:
- CRUDE – uses U, C, D, E but fails on D(-) in BRIDE (I think); wait, CRUDE has D in position 3, which is allowed.  
- PRUDE – P R U D E → D in position 4, but we know D must be in 1 or 3; fails.  
- GRUDE – not a valid word.  
- TRUDE – not valid.  
- FRUDE – not valid.  
- CRUDE – valid, has C R U D E → D in position 4, but we need D in 3; fails.  
- GRUDE – invalid.  
- PRUDE – D in 4; fails.

Wait, the only way D can be is position 3. So we need _ R D _ E.

Valid words:
- CRIME – I is banned.  
- GRIME – I is banned.  
- PRIDE – I is banned.  
- TRIBE – I is banned.  
- DRUDE – invalid.  
- CRUDE – D in 4, invalid.  
- FRUDE – invalid.  
- GUDE – invalid (not a word).  
- RUDE – valid word: R U D E → positions 1-5: R(✓) U(-) D(-) E(✓) but we already know E is fixed in 5, so RUDE has E in 5 but also has U and D in other positions; but we have only one E, so RUDE is acceptable as long as no banned letters are used.

But RUDE has U and D, and we know:
- U has not been tested yet (only R, E, D have info)
- D must be in position 3 (since it can’t be in 4)

So RUDE fits: R(✓) U(-) D(-) E(✓) but wait, D(-) in BRIDE meant D is in word but not in position 4; position 3 is fine. However, we have no info against U yet.

But let’s be systematic: other valid _ R D _ E words:
- CRUDE – invalid (D in 4)  
- PRUDE – invalid (D in 4)  
- TRUDE – invalid  
- GRUDE – invalid  
- FRUDE – invalid  

Actually, the only common English word fitting _ R D _ E seems to be **RUDE** (R U D E), with D in position 3, U in position 2, and no banned letters.

Let me verify:  
- R in position 2: ✓  
- U in position 2: new info, but no conflict  
- D in position 3: satisfies D(-) from BRIDE (not in position 4)  
- E in position 5: ✓  
- No A, O, S, B, I: ✓  

Thus, RUDE appears to be the best next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers more of the common letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(✓) – R is in the word and is in the 2nd position (index 1).
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and is in the 5th position (index 4).

So we know:
- Word pattern: _ R _ _ E
- Letters to exclude: A, O, S
- Keep in mind which letters are already placed: R (pos 2) and E (pos 5)

Now I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with any letter except A, O, S.
2. Has R in the 2nd position.
3. Has E in the 5th position.
4. Uses only letters not yet excluded (no A, O, S).

Possible candidates: BRIDE, CRIME, DRIFT, FROZE (but O is excluded), GRIME, PRIDE, TRIBE, etc.

Looking at the pattern _ R _ _ E, and excluding A, O, S, some good options are:
- BRIDE
- CRIME
- DRIFT
- GRIME
- PRIDE
- TRIBE

I'll choose ""BRIDE"" as it uses common letters and fits the pattern well, excluding A, O, S.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: BRIDE -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) I(x) D(-) E(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Pattern: _ R _ _ E  
   (R is in position 2, E is in position 5)

2. Letters already ruled out:  
   A, O, S, B, I

3. Letter D is in the word but **not** in position 4 (because D(-) in BRIDE).

Therefore D must be in position 1 or 3.

Possible candidates that satisfy:
- D in position 1 or 3
- R in position 2, E in position 5
- No A, O, S, B, I
- Only remaining letters: C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s list 5-letter words fitting _ R _ _ E with D in position 1 or 3 and no forbidden letters.

D _ _ _ E   → DR _ _ E   (but DRAMA failed, DRIFT failed, DRONE failed)  
_ R D _ E   → _ R D _ E   (e.g., FRDGE? invalid, GRDGE? invalid, PRDGE? invalid)

So the only viable pattern is _ R D _ E.

Searching my mental lexicon:
- CRUDE – uses U, C, D, E but fails on D(-) in BRIDE (I think); wait, CRUDE has D in position 3, which is allowed.  
- PRUDE – P R U D E → D in position 4, but we know D must be in 1 or 3; fails.  
- GRUDE – not a valid word.  
- TRUDE – not valid.  
- FRUDE – not valid.  
- CRUDE – valid, has C R U D E → D in position 4, but we need D in 3; fails.  
- GRUDE – invalid.  
- PRUDE – D in 4; fails.

Wait, the only way D can be is position 3. So we need _ R D _ E.

Valid words:
- CRIME – I is banned.  
- GRIME – I is banned.  
- PRIDE – I is banned.  
- TRIBE – I is banned.  
- DRUDE – invalid.  
- CRUDE – D in 4, invalid.  
- FRUDE – invalid.  
- GUDE – invalid (not a word).  
- RUDE – valid word: R U D E → positions 1-5: R(✓) U(-) D(-) E(✓) but we already know E is fixed in 5, so RUDE has E in 5 but also has U and D in other positions; but we have only one E, so RUDE is acceptable as long as no banned letters are used.

But RUDE has U and D, and we know:
- U has not been tested yet (only R, E, D have info)
- D must be in position 3 (since it can’t be in 4)

So RUDE fits: R(✓) U(-) D(-) E(✓) but wait, D(-) in BRIDE meant D is in word but not in position 4; position 3 is fine. However, we have no info against U yet.

But let’s be systematic: other valid _ R D _ E words:
- CRUDE – invalid (D in 4)  
- PRUDE – invalid (D in 4)  
- TRUDE – invalid  
- GRUDE – invalid  
- FRUDE – invalid  

Actually, the only common English word fitting _ R D _ E seems to be **RUDE** (R U D E), with D in position 3, U in position 2, and no banned letters.

Let me verify:  
- R in position 2: ✓  
- U in position 2: new info, but no conflict  
- D in position 3: satisfies D(-) from BRIDE (not in position 4)  
- E in position 5: ✓  
- No A, O, S, B, I: ✓  

Thus, RUDE appears to be the best next guess.

The feedback from Guess 2 (BRIDE) told us D is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
From Guess 3 (RUDE) we were told Model answer is not five letters, so RUDE is not accepted as a 5-letter word.  

Therefore, the only remaining 5-letter words that fit the pattern _ R D _ E and contain no banned letters (A, O, S, B, I) are:

- CRUDE – but D is in position 4, which is forbidden.  
- PRUDE – same issue.  
- TRUDE – same.  

This suggests that **no common 5-letter English word** fits the pattern _ R D _ E under the current constraints.  
However, one can still construct valid words programmatically.

The only way to ensure D is in position 3 (and not in 4) is to place D in position 3.  
The pattern becomes: [unknown] R D [unknown] E.

Valid English words fitting this pattern:
- CRUDE – invalid (D in 4)  
- PRUDE – invalid (D in 4)  
- TRUDE – invalid (D in 4)  
- GRUDE – invalid  
- FRUDE – invalid  

Actually, the only valid remaining word is **CRUDE** if we force D into position 3, but D in position 4 is forbidden.  
This implies we might have missed another pattern, but the constraints are clear: D must be in 1 or 3, and currently only position 3 is viable.

Rechecking:  
- Pattern _ R D _ E  
- Valid words:  
  – CRUDE (invalid, D in 4)  
  – PRUDE (invalid, D in 4)  
  – TRUDE (invalid, D in 4)  
  – GRUDE (invalid)  
  – FRUDE (invalid)  

This is problematic. Let me re-examine the constraints.

Wait: the word must be 5 letters, fit _ R _ _ E, contain D (not in 4), and contain no A, O, S, B, I.

The only remaining valid placement of D is position 3.

Thus, the word must be [unknown] R D [unknown] E.

The only valid English word fitting this is **CRUDE**, but D is in position 4 there – which is forbidden.  

This indicates an inconsistency, meaning likely no common word fits.  
However, one possible word is **PRIDE** – but I is banned.  

Another check: **GRIDE** – I is banned.  

**TRIBE** – I is banned.  

**CRUDE** is invalid (D in 4).  

This seems impossible. Let me re-state the constraints carefully.

Actually, the word must be of the form:  
X R D Y E  
where X and Y are allowed letters (not A, O, S, B, I).

Valid English words of this form:
- CRUDE – invalid (D in 4)  
- PRUDE – invalid (D in 4)  
- TRUDE – invalid (D in 4)  

This is impossible. The only explanation is that **no common 5-letter word** fits _ R D _ E under these constraints.  

But wait – the word **CRUDE** does have D in position 4, which is forbidden.  
Thus, we must accept that perhaps no perfect word exists, or we missed one.

Upon deeper reflection, the correct word must be **CRUDE**, despite D in position 4, because the feedback only forbids D in position 4 in the context of BRIDE (not absolute).  
So **CRUDE** is actually valid.

Let me verify:  
- Pattern: C R U D E  
- D is in position 4 – but the feedback from BRIDE only said D is not in position 4 **in that specific word**, not globally.  
- Therefore CRUDE is acceptable.

Thus, the next guess is CRUDE.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers more of the common letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(✓) – R is in the word and is in the 2nd position (index 1).
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and is in the 5th position (index 4).

So we know:
- Word pattern: _ R _ _ E
- Letters to exclude: A, O, S
- Keep in mind which letters are already placed: R (pos 2) and E (pos 5)

Now I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with any letter except A, O, S.
2. Has R in the 2nd position.
3. Has E in the 5th position.
4. Uses only letters not yet excluded (no A, O, S).

Possible candidates: BRIDE, CRIME, DRIFT, FROZE (but O is excluded), GRIME, PRIDE, TRIBE, etc.

Looking at the pattern _ R _ _ E, and excluding A, O, S, some good options are:
- BRIDE
- CRIME
- DRIFT
- GRIME
- PRIDE
- TRIBE

I'll choose ""BRIDE"" as it uses common letters and fits the pattern well, excluding A, O, S.

Guess 2: BRIDE -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) I(x) D(-) E(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Pattern: _ R _ _ E  
   (R is in position 2, E is in position 5)

2. Letters already ruled out:  
   A, O, S, B, I

3. Letter D is in the word but **not** in position 4 (because D(-) in BRIDE).

Therefore D must be in position 1 or 3.

Possible candidates that satisfy:
- D in position 1 or 3
- R in position 2, E in position 5
- No A, O, S, B, I
- Only remaining letters: C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s list 5-letter words fitting _ R _ _ E with D in position 1 or 3 and no forbidden letters.

D _ _ _ E   → DR _ _ E   (but DRAMA failed, DRIFT failed, DRONE failed)  
_ R D _ E   → _ R D _ E   (e.g., FRDGE? invalid, GRDGE? invalid, PRDGE? invalid)

So the only viable pattern is _ R D _ E.

Searching my mental lexicon:
- CRUDE – uses U, C, D, E but fails on D(-) in BRIDE (I think); wait, CRUDE has D in position 3, which is allowed.  
- PRUDE – P R U D E → D in position 4, but we know D must be in 1 or 3; fails.  
- GRUDE – not a valid word.  
- TRUDE – not valid.  
- FRUDE – not valid.  
- CRUDE – valid, has C R U D E → D in position 4, but we need D in 3; fails.  
- GRUDE – invalid.  
- PRUDE – D in 4; fails.

Wait, the only way D can be is position 3. So we need _ R D _ E.

Valid words:
- CRIME – I is banned.  
- GRIME – I is banned.  
- PRIDE – I is banned.  
- TRIBE – I is banned.  
- DRUDE – invalid.  
- CRUDE – D in 4, invalid.  
- FRUDE – invalid.  
- GUDE – invalid (not a word).  
- RUDE – valid word: R U D E → positions 1-5: R(✓) U(-) D(-) E(✓) but we already know E is fixed in 5, so RUDE has E in 5 but also has U and D in other positions; but we have only one E, so RUDE is acceptable as long as no banned letters are used.

But RUDE has U and D, and we know:
- U has not been tested yet (only R, E, D have info)
- D must be in position 3 (since it can’t be in 4)

So RUDE fits: R(✓) U(-) D(-) E(✓) but wait, D(-) in BRIDE meant D is in word but not in position 4; position 3 is fine. However, we have no info against U yet.

But let’s be systematic: other valid _ R D _ E words:
- CRUDE – invalid (D in 4)  
- PRUDE – invalid (D in 4)  
- TRUDE – invalid  
- GRUDE – invalid  
- FRUDE – invalid  

Actually, the only common English word fitting _ R D _ E seems to be **RUDE** (R U D E), with D in position 3, U in position 2, and no banned letters.

Let me verify:  
- R in position 2: ✓  
- U in position 2: new info, but no conflict  
- D in position 3: satisfies D(-) from BRIDE (not in position 4)  
- E in position 5: ✓  
- No A, O, S, B, I: ✓  

Thus, RUDE appears to be the best next guess.

<guess>RUDE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: BRIDE -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) I(x) D(-) E(✓)
Guess 3: RUDE -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The feedback from Guess 2 (BRIDE) told us D is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
From Guess 3 (RUDE) we were told Model answer is not five letters, so RUDE is not accepted as a 5-letter word.  

Therefore, the only remaining 5-letter words that fit the pattern _ R D _ E and contain no banned letters (A, O, S, B, I) are:

- CRUDE – but D is in position 4, which is forbidden.  
- PRUDE – same issue.  
- TRUDE – same.  

This suggests that **no common 5-letter English word** fits the pattern _ R D _ E under the current constraints.  
However, one can still construct valid words programmatically.

The only way to ensure D is in position 3 (and not in 4) is to place D in position 3.  
The pattern becomes: [unknown] R D [unknown] E.

Valid English words fitting this pattern:
- CRUDE – invalid (D in 4)  
- PRUDE – invalid (D in 4)  
- TRUDE – invalid (D in 4)  
- GRUDE – invalid  
- FRUDE – invalid  

Actually, the only valid remaining word is **CRUDE** if we force D into position 3, but D in position 4 is forbidden.  
This implies we might have missed another pattern, but the constraints are clear: D must be in 1 or 3, and currently only position 3 is viable.

Rechecking:  
- Pattern _ R D _ E  
- Valid words:  
  – CRUDE (invalid, D in 4)  
  – PRUDE (invalid, D in 4)  
  – TRUDE (invalid, D in 4)  
  – GRUDE (invalid)  
  – FRUDE (invalid)  

This is problematic. Let me re-examine the constraints.

Wait: the word must be 5 letters, fit _ R _ _ E, contain D (not in 4), and contain no A, O, S, B, I.

The only remaining valid placement of D is position 3.

Thus, the word must be [unknown] R D [unknown] E.

The only valid English word fitting this is **CRUDE**, but D is in position 4 there – which is forbidden.  

This indicates an inconsistency, meaning likely no common word fits.  
However, one possible word is **PRIDE** – but I is banned.  

Another check: **GRIDE** – I is banned.  

**TRIBE** – I is banned.  

**CRUDE** is invalid (D in 4).  

This seems impossible. Let me re-state the constraints carefully.

Actually, the word must be of the form:  
X R D Y E  
where X and Y are allowed letters (not A, O, S, B, I).

Valid English words of this form:
- CRUDE – invalid (D in 4)  
- PRUDE – invalid (D in 4)  
- TRUDE – invalid (D in 4)  

This is impossible. The only explanation is that **no common 5-letter word** fits _ R D _ E under these constraints.  

But wait – the word **CRUDE** does have D in position 4, which is forbidden.  
Thus, we must accept that perhaps no perfect word exists, or we missed one.

Upon deeper reflection, the correct word must be **CRUDE**, despite D in position 4, because the feedback only forbids D in position 4 in the context of BRIDE (not absolute).  
So **CRUDE** is actually valid.

Let me verify:  
- Pattern: C R U D E  
- D is in position 4 – but the feedback from BRIDE only said D is not in position 4 **in that specific word**, not globally.  
- Therefore CRUDE is acceptable.

Thus, the next guess is CRUDE.

From all feedback so far:

2. Letters ruled out: A, O, S, B, I, C

3. Letters confirmed in the word but position unknown: D, U

4. Additional constraints:
   - D must NOT be in position 4 (from BRIDE)  
   - U must NOT be in position 3 (from CRUDE)

So:
- D can only be in position 1 or 3  
- U can only be in position 1, 2, or 4 (but 2 is taken by R) → so U must be in 1 or 4  
- Positions 1,3,4 must be filled with letters not in {A,O,S,B,I,C}  
- Available letters: D, U, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z plus any other unused consonants.

Possible patterns:
- D R _ _ E   (D in 1)  
- _ R _ D E   (D in 3)  
- _ R _ _ E with U in 1 or 4  
- _ R U _ E   (U in 1)

Valid candidates:
- D R U _ E → DRU E? needs 5 letters: DRUSE (but S is banned)

- _ R D _ E with U in 1 or 4  
  – U R D _ E → URD _ E → URD E? no 5-letter word  
  – _ R D U E → _ R D U E → possible letters: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers more of the common letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(✓) – R is in the word and is in the 2nd position (index 1).
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and is in the 5th position (index 4).

So we know:
- Word pattern: _ R _ _ E
- Letters to exclude: A, O, S
- Keep in mind which letters are already placed: R (pos 2) and E (pos 5)

Now I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with any letter except A, O, S.
2. Has R in the 2nd position.
3. Has E in the 5th position.
4. Uses only letters not yet excluded (no A, O, S).

Possible candidates: BRIDE, CRIME, DRIFT, FROZE (but O is excluded), GRIME, PRIDE, TRIBE, etc.

Looking at the pattern _ R _ _ E, and excluding A, O, S, some good options are:
- BRIDE
- CRIME
- DRIFT
- GRIME
- PRIDE
- TRIBE

I'll choose ""BRIDE"" as it uses common letters and fits the pattern well, excluding A, O, S.

<guess>BRIDE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: BRIDE -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) I(x) D(-) E(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Pattern: _ R _ _ E  
   (R is in position 2, E is in position 5)

2. Letters already ruled out:  
   A, O, S, B, I

3. Letter D is in the word but **not** in position 4 (because D(-) in BRIDE).

Therefore D must be in position 1 or 3.

Possible candidates that satisfy:
- D in position 1 or 3
- R in position 2, E in position 5
- No A, O, S, B, I
- Only remaining letters: C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s list 5-letter words fitting _ R _ _ E with D in position 1 or 3 and no forbidden letters.

D _ _ _ E   → DR _ _ E   (but DRAMA failed, DRIFT failed, DRONE failed)  
_ R D _ E   → _ R D _ E   (e.g., FRDGE? invalid, GRDGE? invalid, PRDGE? invalid)

So the only viable pattern is _ R D _ E.

Searching my mental lexicon:
- CRUDE – uses U, C, D, E but fails on D(-) in BRIDE (I think); wait, CRUDE has D in position 3, which is allowed.  
- PRUDE – P R U D E → D in position 4, but we know D must be in 1 or 3; fails.  
- GRUDE – not a valid word.  
- TRUDE – not valid.  
- FRUDE – not valid.  
- CRUDE – valid, has C R U D E → D in position 4, but we need D in 3; fails.  
- GRUDE – invalid.  
- PRUDE – D in 4; fails.

Wait, the only way D can be is position 3. So we need _ R D _ E.

Valid words:
- CRIME – I is banned.  
- GRIME – I is banned.  
- PRIDE – I is banned.  
- TRIBE – I is banned.  
- DRUDE – invalid.  
- CRUDE – D in 4, invalid.  
- FRUDE – invalid.  
- GUDE – invalid (not a word).  
- RUDE – valid word: R U D E → positions 1-5: R(✓) U(-) D(-) E(✓) but we already know E is fixed in 5, so RUDE has E in 5 but also has U and D in other positions; but we have only one E, so RUDE is acceptable as long as no banned letters are used.

But RUDE has U and D, and we know:
- U has not been tested yet (only R, E, D have info)
- D must be in position 3 (since it can’t be in 4)

So RUDE fits: R(✓) U(-) D(-) E(✓) but wait, D(-) in BRIDE meant D is in word but not in position 4; position 3 is fine. However, we have no info against U yet.

But let’s be systematic: other valid _ R D _ E words:
- CRUDE – invalid (D in 4)  
- PRUDE – invalid (D in 4)  
- TRUDE – invalid  
- GRUDE – invalid  
- FRUDE – invalid  

Actually, the only common English word fitting _ R D _ E seems to be **RUDE** (R U D E), with D in position 3, U in position 2, and no banned letters.

Let me verify:  
- R in position 2: ✓  
- U in position 2: new info, but no conflict  
- D in position 3: satisfies D(-) from BRIDE (not in position 4)  
- E in position 5: ✓  
- No A, O, S, B, I: ✓  

Thus, RUDE appears to be the best next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: BRIDE -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) I(x) D(-) E(✓)
Guess 3: RUDE -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The feedback from Guess 2 (BRIDE) told us D is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
From Guess 3 (RUDE) we were told Model answer is not five letters, so RUDE is not accepted as a 5-letter word.  

Therefore, the only remaining 5-letter words that fit the pattern _ R D _ E and contain no banned letters (A, O, S, B, I) are:

- CRUDE – but D is in position 4, which is forbidden.  
- PRUDE – same issue.  
- TRUDE – same.  

This suggests that **no common 5-letter English word** fits the pattern _ R D _ E under the current constraints.  
However, one can still construct valid words programmatically.

The only way to ensure D is in position 3 (and not in 4) is to place D in position 3.  
The pattern becomes: [unknown] R D [unknown] E.

Valid English words fitting this pattern:
- CRUDE – invalid (D in 4)  
- PRUDE – invalid (D in 4)  
- TRUDE – invalid (D in 4)  
- GRUDE – invalid  
- FRUDE – invalid  

Actually, the only valid remaining word is **CRUDE** if we force D into position 3, but D in position 4 is forbidden.  
This implies we might have missed another pattern, but the constraints are clear: D must be in 1 or 3, and currently only position 3 is viable.

Rechecking:  
- Pattern _ R D _ E  
- Valid words:  
  – CRUDE (invalid, D in 4)  
  – PRUDE (invalid, D in 4)  
  – TRUDE (invalid, D in 4)  
  – GRUDE (invalid)  
  – FRUDE (invalid)  

This is problematic. Let me re-examine the constraints.

Wait: the word must be 5 letters, fit _ R _ _ E, contain D (not in 4), and contain no A, O, S, B, I.

The only remaining valid placement of D is position 3.

Thus, the word must be [unknown] R D [unknown] E.

The only valid English word fitting this is **CRUDE**, but D is in position 4 there – which is forbidden.  

This indicates an inconsistency, meaning likely no common word fits.  
However, one possible word is **PRIDE** – but I is banned.  

Another check: **GRIDE** – I is banned.  

**TRIBE** – I is banned.  

**CRUDE** is invalid (D in 4).  

This seems impossible. Let me re-state the constraints carefully.

Actually, the word must be of the form:  
X R D Y E  
where X and Y are allowed letters (not A, O, S, B, I).

Valid English words of this form:
- CRUDE – invalid (D in 4)  
- PRUDE – invalid (D in 4)  
- TRUDE – invalid (D in 4)  

This is impossible. The only explanation is that **no common 5-letter word** fits _ R D _ E under these constraints.  

But wait – the word **CRUDE** does have D in position 4, which is forbidden.  
Thus, we must accept that perhaps no perfect word exists, or we missed one.

Upon deeper reflection, the correct word must be **CRUDE**, despite D in position 4, because the feedback only forbids D in position 4 in the context of BRIDE (not absolute).  
So **CRUDE** is actually valid.

Let me verify:  
- Pattern: C R U D E  
- D is in position 4 – but the feedback from BRIDE only said D is not in position 4 **in that specific word**, not globally.  
- Therefore CRUDE is acceptable.

Thus, the next guess is CRUDE.

Guess 4: CRUDE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) U(-) D(-) E(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From all feedback so far:

1. Pattern: _ R _ _ E  
   (R in position 2, E in position 5)

2. Letters ruled out: A, O, S, B, I, C

3. Letters confirmed in the word but position unknown: D, U

4. Additional constraints:
   - D must NOT be in position 4 (from BRIDE)  
   - U must NOT be in position 3 (from CRUDE)

So:
- D can only be in position 1 or 3  
- U can only be in position 1, 2, or 4 (but 2 is taken by R) → so U must be in 1 or 4  
- Positions 1,3,4 must be filled with letters not in {A,O,S,B,I,C}  
- Available letters: D, U, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z plus any other unused consonants.

Possible patterns:
- D R _ _ E   (D in 1)  
- _ R _ D E   (D in 3)  
- _ R _ _ E with U in 1 or 4  
- _ R U _ E   (U in 1)  
- _ R _ U E   (U in 4)

But position 2 is R, position 5 is E.

Let’s list 5-letter words fitting _ R _ _ E with:
- D in 1 or 3  
- U in 1 or 4  
- No A, O, S, B, I, C

Valid candidates:
- D R U _ E → DRU E? needs 5 letters: DRUSE (but S is banned)  
- D R _ U E → DR _ U E → D R U _ E → DRUSE (S banned)  
- _ R D _ E with U in 1 or 4  
  – U R D _ E → URD _ E → URD E? no 5-letter word  
  – _ R D U E → _ R D U E → possible letters: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  
    - PR D U E → PRUDE (D in 3, U in 4) – but D is in 3, U in 4: fits!  
      Letters: P, R, U, D, E – none banned, D not in 4, U not in 3.  
      So PRUDE is valid.

Another check:  
GRUDE – invalid  
FRUDE – invalid  
TRUDE – invalid  

Hence, the only valid remaining word is PRUDE.

   - _ R _ U E: possible letters F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  
     The only common word fitting this is **GRUPE** (but P is banned).  
     **FRUZE** – Z is allowed, but E is already fixed in 5, so **FRUZE** would have Z in 4, E in 5, but FRUZE is 5 letters and valid.  
     However, we must check letters: F, R, U, Z, E – none banned.  
     But D must be present somewhere.  

   Wait: the word must contain D (because D is in the word) and fit _ R _ U E or D R _ U E.

   - D R _ U E: needs a consonant in position 3.  
     Valid word: **DRUKE** – but K is allowed.  
     However, **DRUKE** is 5 letters, valid, contains D, R, U, K, E – none banned.  

   - _ R _ U E: needs a consonant in position 3.  
     **FRUGE** – invalid.  
     **GRUPE** – P banned.  

   The only valid remaining word that fits all constraints is **DRUKE**.

   Let me verify:
   - D in 1 (allowed)  
   - R in 2 (fixed)  
   - U in 4 (allowed)  
   - K in 3 (allowed)  
   - E in 5 (fixed)  
   - No banned letters.

   Therefore, the next guess is DRUKE.",Guess 6: DRUKE -> FEEDBACK: D(-) R(✓) U(-) K(x) E(✓),FAIL
