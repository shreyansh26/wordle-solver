For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

- It contains the letter O, but O is not in the 3rd position.
- Letters A, R, S are excluded entirely.

2. Include O in a different position (not 3).
3. Introduce new common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out.

A strong candidate is “TONER”:
- T – new consonant.
- O – known to be in the word, now in position 2.
- N – new consonant.
- E – kept in position 5.
- R – already ruled out, so this is bad. Let’s avoid R.

“OLIVE” has O in position 2 and introduces L, I, V.

4. Therefore the remaining alphabet still usable for the other four positions is:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in position 5.

So we know:
- The word ends in E.
- It contains the letter O, but O is not in the 3rd position.
- Letters A, R, S are excluded entirely.
- We have not yet tested T, N, I, L, C, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep E in position 5.
2. Include O in a different position (not 3).
3. Introduce new common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out.

A strong candidate is “TONER”:
- T – new consonant.
- O – known to be in the word, now in position 2.
- N – new consonant.
- E – kept in position 5.
- R – already ruled out, so this is bad. Let’s avoid R.

Better candidate: “TONER” has R, so skip.
“OLIVE” has O in position 2 and introduces L, I, V.
“OLIVE” it is.

Check: O is now in position 2 (not 3), E is in position 5, and we’ve added L, I, V.

Guess 2: OLIVE -> FEEDBACK: O(-) L(x) I(-) V(x) E(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Position 5 is E (✓ from both guesses).
2. The word contains O and I (both are in the word but not yet in the correct place).
3. Letters that have been ruled out entirely: A, R, S, L, V.
4. Positions that have been ruled out so far:
   - O cannot be in position 1 or 3.
   - I cannot be in position 3.

Letters still untested that are common: T, N, C, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, K, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends in E.
- Contains both O and I.
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, L, V.
- Has O in positions 2, 4, or 5 (but 5 is already E, so 2 or 4).
- Has I somewhere other than position 3.

Let’s try a word that places O in position 2 and I in position 4: “DOING” – but G is untested and N is good.  
However, “DOING” has I in position 4 and O in position 2, and all letters are still allowed.

But “DOING” is a valid 5-letter word, uses allowed letters, and tests new consonants D and N.

Another candidate: “POINT” – but it has I in position 2 and O in position 4, and tests P, N, T.

“POINT” uses P, N, T – all new and common.

Let’s go with POINT.

Check:
- P – new
- O – known, now in position 2 (allowed)
- I – known, now in position 4 (allowed)
- N – new
- T – new
- Ends in E (✓)
- No ruled-out letters (A, R, S, L, V are avoided)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in position 5.

So we know:
- The word ends in E.
- It contains the letter O, but O is not in the 3rd position.
- Letters A, R, S are excluded entirely.
- We have not yet tested T, N, I, L, C, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep E in position 5.
2. Include O in a different position (not 3).
3. Introduce new common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out.

A strong candidate is “TONER”:
- T – new consonant.
- O – known to be in the word, now in position 2.
- N – new consonant.
- E – kept in position 5.
- R – already ruled out, so this is bad. Let’s avoid R.

Better candidate: “TONER” has R, so skip.
“OLIVE” has O in position 2 and introduces L, I, V.
“OLIVE” it is.

Check: O is now in position 2 (not 3), E is in position 5, and we’ve added L, I, V.

<guess>OLIVE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: OLIVE -> FEEDBACK: O(-) L(x) I(-) V(x) E(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Position 5 is E (✓ from both guesses).
2. The word contains O and I (both are in the word but not yet in the correct place).
3. Letters that have been ruled out entirely: A, R, S, L, V.
4. Positions that have been ruled out so far:
   - O cannot be in position 1 or 3.
   - I cannot be in position 3.

Letters still untested that are common: T, N, C, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, K, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends in E.
- Contains both O and I.
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, L, V.
- Has O in positions 2, 4, or 5 (but 5 is already E, so 2 or 4).
- Has I somewhere other than position 3.

Let’s try a word that places O in position 2 and I in position 4: “DOING” – but G is untested and N is good.  
However, “DOING” has I in position 4 and O in position 2, and all letters are still allowed.

But “DOING” is a valid 5-letter word, uses allowed letters, and tests new consonants D and N.

Another candidate: “POINT” – but it has I in position 2 and O in position 4, and tests P, N, T.

“POINT” uses P, N, T – all new and common.

Let’s go with POINT.

Check:
- P – new
- O – known, now in position 2 (allowed)
- I – known, now in position 4 (allowed)
- N – new
- T – new
- Ends in E (✓)
- No ruled-out letters (A, R, S, L, V are avoided)

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: OLIVE -> FEEDBACK: O(-) L(x) I(-) V(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(-) N(x) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From all feedback so far:

1. Position 5 is E (✓).
2. The word contains O (now fixed in position 2) and I (still somewhere else).
3. Letters ruled out: A, R, S, L, V, P, N, T.
4. Therefore the remaining alphabet still usable for the other four positions is:
   B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

We have:
- Position 2 = O
- Position 5 = E
- The word must contain I somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (cannot be 2 or 5).

Let’s look for a word that fits the pattern:
  _  O  _  _  E
with I in one of the blanks, and uses only still-allowed letters.

Candidate letters in the blanks: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

A good choice is “COBIE” – but COBIE isn’t a recognized English word.

Next candidate: “DOING” – but G is allowed, N is not (already ruled out).

Try “BOGIE” – B, O, G, I, E – all letters allowed, Bogie is a valid word.

But let’s see if we can do better – more common word.

How about “MOXIE” – but X is allowed, M is allowed, O is fixed, I is required, E is fixed.  
“MOXIE” is a valid word and uses M, X, I, E, O.

But let’s check the letters:
M – new, O – fixed, X – new, I – required, E – fixed.
No ruled-out letters.

“MOXIE” seems like a strong fourth guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: OLIVE -> FEEDBACK: O(-) L(x) I(-) V(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(-) N(x) T(x)
Guess 4: MOXIE -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) X(x) I(✓) E(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the latest feedback:

- Position 2 = O (✓)
- Position 4 = I (✓)
- Position 5 = E (✓)
- Letters ruled out so far: A, R, S, L, V, P, N, T, M, X.

The pattern is now:
_  O  _  I  E

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits this pattern and uses only still-allowed letters for the two blanks (positions 1 and 3).

Allowed letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, W, Y, Z.

Let’s list common English words matching _O_I_E:
- BOGIE – B and G are allowed, but is Bogie a valid word? Yes, it’s a colloquial term for “bogie” or “boggie”.
- COGIE – not a word.
- DOGIE – not a word.
- FOGIE – not a word.
- HOGIE – not a word.
- JOKIE – not a word.
- KOGIE – not a word.
- WOOIE – not a word.
- COGIE – not a word.

The only common valid word left is BOGIE.

Let’s verify:
B – allowed
O – fixed
G – allowed
I – fixed
E – fixed

No ruled-out letters. BOGIE fits the pattern perfectly.

Therefore, the next guess should be BOGIE.
