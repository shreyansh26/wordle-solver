### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, while also covering many potential letters in the word.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A, R, O, E are out.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. SLUMP → S(-) L(-) U(x) M(x) P(x)
   - U, M, P are out.
   - S is still not in position 1 (it’s already known not in 4).
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, U, M, P.
- Letters definitely IN the word: S and L.
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
- L cannot be in position 2.

Remaining common letters to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, N, T, Y, etc.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both S and L (with the positional constraints above).
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.
- Tries fresh letters to gain new information.

Candidate words that come to mind:
- “STING” – but it has an I and N, and fits S not in 1 or 4, L not in 2.
- “SNAIL” – but L would be in position 5, which is allowed, but we already know L is in the word; we need to test new positions for L.
- “SWISH” – but W and H are untested, and S would be in position 1 (forbidden).
- “SLICK” – L in position 2 is forbidden.
- “STYL” – too short.
- “BLISS” – S repeats and L is in position 2 (forbidden).
- “TILDE” – E is forbidden.
- “SHILK” – K is uncommon, but H and I are new.

“STING” looks good:
- S in position 1 is forbidden, but we can test it in position 2.
- L is in position 3, which is allowed (we only know L is not in position 2).
- T, I, N, G are all new letters.

But let’s check if S in position 2 is allowed – it isn’t (we know S can’t be in 1 or 4). So S in position 2 is fine.

Thus, “STING” is a valid next guess.

Alternative: “SHILK” – but K is less common, and we want to test more likely letters.

Going with “STING”.

But wait – in “STING”, S is in position 1, which is forbidden (feedback says S is not in position 1). So S cannot be in position 1, and must be in 2,3, or 5.

Similarly, L cannot be in position 2; it can be in 1,3,4,5.

Let me try “SHILK” – no, that’s not a valid word.

Let me think of words with S not in 1 or 4, and L not in 2.

Valid options:
- “BLISS” – L in 2 is forbidden.
- “CLIPS” – P is out.
- “FLISK” – K is uncommon.
- “GLINT” – N is new, T is new, I is new; S is in 5 (allowed), L is in 2 (forbidden).
- “SLINK” – K is new, S is in 1 (forbidden).
- “SNILT” – N, I, L, T are new; S in 1 (forbidden).
- “SHILT” – H, I, L, T are new; S in 1 (forbidden).

Hmm, many common words have flawed positional constraints.

Let me try “SHILK” – not a word.

Another approach: pick a word with S in 3 or 5, and L in 1,3,4,5, but not 2.

“SHILK” isn’t valid.

“STINK” – K is new, S in 2 (allowed), L in 3 (allowed); T, I, N are new.

Yes! “STINK” satisfies:
- S not in 1 or 4 (it’s in 2).
- L not in 2 (it’s in 3).
- Letters S, T, I, N, K have not been eliminated.

That seems safe.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, while also covering many potential letters in the word.

- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
- L cannot be in position 2.

Remaining common letters to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, N, T, Y, etc.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both S and L (with the positional constraints above).
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.
- Tries fresh letters to gain new information.

Candidate words that come to mind:
- “STING” – but it has an I and N, and fits S not in 1 or 4, L not in 2.
- “SNAIL” – but L would be in position 5, which is allowed, but we already know L is in the word; we need to test new positions for L.
- “SWISH” – but W and H are untested, and S would be in position 1 (forbidden).
- “SLICK” – L in position 2 is forbidden.
- “STYL” – too short.
- “BLISS” – S repeats and L is in position 2 (forbidden).
- “TILDE” – E is forbidden.
- “SHILK” – K is uncommon, but H and I are new.

“STING” looks good:
- S in position 1 is forbidden, but we can test it in position 2.
- L is in position 3, which is allowed (we only know L is not in position 2).
- T, I, N, G are all new letters.

But let’s check if S in position 2 is allowed – it isn’t (we know S can’t be in 1 or 4). So S in position 2 is fine.

Thus, “STING” is a valid next guess.

Going with “STING”.

But wait – in “STING”, S is in position 1, which is forbidden (feedback says S is not in position 1). So S cannot be in position 1, and must be in 2,3, or 5.

Similarly, L cannot be in position 2; it can be in 1,3,4,5.

Let me try “SHILK” – no, that’s not a valid word.

Let me think of words with S not in 1 or 4, and L not in 2.

Valid options:
- “BLISS” – L in 2 is forbidden.
- “CLIPS” – P is out.
- “FLISK” – K is uncommon.
- “GLINT” – N is new, T is new, I is new; S is in 5 (allowed), L is in 2 (forbidden).

- “SNILT” – N, I, L, T are new; S in 1 (forbidden).
- “SHILT” – H, I, L, T are new; S in 1 (forbidden).

Hmm, many common words have flawed positional constraints.

Let me try “SHILK” – not a word.

Another approach: pick a word with S in 3 or 5, and L in 1,3,4,5, but not 2.

“SHILK” isn’t valid.

“STINK” – K is new, S in 2 (allowed), L in 3 (allowed); T, I, N are new.

Yes! “STINK” satisfies:

- L not in 2 (it’s in 3).
- Letters S, T, I, N, K have not been eliminated.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, while also covering many potential letters in the word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but not in the 4th position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S somewhere other than position 4.
2. Avoids A, R, O, E entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels not yet eliminated.

Good remaining letters to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, N, T, U, Y, etc.

A good candidate word would be ""SLUMP"":
- Contains S in position 1 (not position 4, so it satisfies the feedback).
- Uses U, M, P which are not eliminated.
- Uses L which is also not eliminated.
- Avoids all eliminated letters (A, R, O, E).

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)

   - S is still not in position 1 (it’s already known not in 4).

So far we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, U, M, P.
- Letters definitely IN the word: S and L.
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
- L cannot be in position 2.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both S and L (with the positional constraints above).
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.
- Tries fresh letters to gain new information.

Candidate words that come to mind:
- “STING” – but it has an I and N, and fits S not in 1 or 4, L not in 2.
- “SNAIL” – but L would be in position 5, which is allowed, but we already know L is in the word; we need to test new positions for L.
- “SWISH” – but W and H are untested, and S would be in position 1 (forbidden).
- “SLICK” – L in position 2 is forbidden.
- “STYL” – too short.
- “BLISS” – S repeats and L is in position 2 (forbidden).
- “TILDE” – E is forbidden.
- “SHILK” – K is uncommon, but H and I are new.

“STING” looks good:
- S in position 1 is forbidden, but we can test it in position 2.
- L is in position 3, which is allowed (we only know L is not in position 2).
- T, I, N, G are all new letters.

But let’s check if S in position 2 is allowed – it isn’t (we know S can’t be in 1 or 4). So S in position 2 is fine.

Thus, “STING” is a valid next guess.

Alternative: “SHILK” – but K is less common, and we want to test more likely letters.

Going with “STING”.

But wait – in “STING”, S is in position 1, which is forbidden (feedback says S is not in position 1). So S cannot be in position 1, and must be in 2,3, or 5.

Similarly, L cannot be in position 2; it can be in 1,3,4,5.

Let me try “SHILK” – no, that’s not a valid word.

Let me think of words with S not in 1 or 4, and L not in 2.

Valid options:
- “BLISS” – L in 2 is forbidden.

- “SNILT” – N, I, L, T are new; S in 1 (forbidden).
- “SHILT” – H, I, L, T are new; S in 1 (forbidden).

Hmm, many common words have flawed positional constraints.

Let me try “SHILK” – not a word.

Another approach: pick a word with S in 3 or 5, and L in 1,3,4,5, but not 2.

“SHILK” isn’t valid.

“STINK” – K is new, S in 2 (allowed), L in 3 (allowed); T, I, N are new.

Yes! “STINK” satisfies:
- S not in 1 or 4 (it’s in 2).
- L not in 2 (it’s in 3).
- Letters S, T, I, N, K have not been eliminated.

That seems safe.

Try “LISON” – O, N are out.

Try “LISKY” – K is out.

Try “LISSE” – E is out.

Try “LISIA” – A is out.

Hmm, many combinations give invalid or obscure words.

Let me try S in 3, L in 1, I in 2:
L I S _ _

Need two more letters. Common: B, C, D, F, G, H, Y, W, V.

“LISES” – E is out.
“LISSY” – Y is fine, but “LISSY” isn’t a word.
“LISSA” – A is out.

Try “LISSY” – not valid.

Try “LISSA” – A is out.

Try “LISSY” – no.

Try “LISSY” – no.

Let me try S in 5, L in 3, I in 1:
I _ L _ S

Fill with common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, Y, W, V.

“ILYSS” – not a word.
“ICHLS” – not a word.
“IDLSH” – not a word.

Try “ILYSS” – no.

Try “ILYSS” – no.

Let me try S in 5, L in 1, I in 4:
L _ _ I S

Fill: L I _ I S – but I is in 4, so L I _ I S.

“LI_DIS” – “LI_DIS” isn’t a word.

Try “LILIS” – but L is in 1 (allowed), I is in 2 (allowed), L is in 3 (allowed), I is in 4 (allowed), S is in 5 (allowed).

“LILIS” is a valid word (a plant). It satisfies:
- S is in 5 (allowed).
- L is in 1 (allowed).
- I is in 2 (allowed).
- Letters L, I, S have not been exhausted.

Another candidate: “LILTS” – T is out.

Another: “LILAC” – A is out.

Another: “LILTH” – H is new, but “LILTH” is obscure.

“LILIS” is the clearest valid word that fits all constraints.

So I will go with “LILIS”.

From the new feedback on LILIS:

- L(-)  → L is in the word but not in position 1.

- I(-)  → I is in the word but not in position 4 (we already know it’s in 2, so this is consistent).
- S(✓)  → S is correct in position 5.

So the secret word has the pattern:

_  I  L  _  S

Letters already confirmed: I (pos 2), L (pos 3), S (pos 5).

Letters still needed: positions 1 and 4.

From earlier eliminations, forbidden letters include: A, R, O, E, U, M, P, T, N, K.

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, W, Y, V, etc.

We need two distinct letters from that set, one for position 1 and one for position 4, forming a valid English word.

Candidate words matching _ I L _ S:

- B I L B S – not a word.

Real English words that fit _ I L _ S:

Check constraints:
- B is new, allowed.
- I in 2 (✓), L in 3 (✓), L in 4 (allowed), S in 5 (✓).

So “BILLS” satisfies every constraint.

Other possibilities exist (C, D, F, G, H, W, Y, V could all generate words), but “BILLS” is the most common and fits perfectly.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, while also covering many potential letters in the word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but not in the 4th position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S somewhere other than position 4.
2. Avoids A, R, O, E entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels not yet eliminated.

Good remaining letters to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, N, T, U, Y, etc.

A good candidate word would be ""SLUMP"":
- Contains S in position 1 (not position 4, so it satisfies the feedback).
- Uses U, M, P which are not eliminated.
- Uses L which is also not eliminated.
- Avoids all eliminated letters (A, R, O, E).

Guess 2: SLUMP -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(-) U(x) M(x) P(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A, R, O, E are out.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. SLUMP → S(-) L(-) U(x) M(x) P(x)
   - U, M, P are out.
   - S is still not in position 1 (it’s already known not in 4).
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, U, M, P.
- Letters definitely IN the word: S and L.
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
- L cannot be in position 2.

Remaining common letters to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, N, T, Y, etc.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both S and L (with the positional constraints above).
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.
- Tries fresh letters to gain new information.

Candidate words that come to mind:
- “STING” – but it has an I and N, and fits S not in 1 or 4, L not in 2.
- “SNAIL” – but L would be in position 5, which is allowed, but we already know L is in the word; we need to test new positions for L.
- “SWISH” – but W and H are untested, and S would be in position 1 (forbidden).
- “SLICK” – L in position 2 is forbidden.
- “STYL” – too short.
- “BLISS” – S repeats and L is in position 2 (forbidden).
- “TILDE” – E is forbidden.
- “SHILK” – K is uncommon, but H and I are new.

“STING” looks good:
- S in position 1 is forbidden, but we can test it in position 2.
- L is in position 3, which is allowed (we only know L is not in position 2).
- T, I, N, G are all new letters.

But let’s check if S in position 2 is allowed – it isn’t (we know S can’t be in 1 or 4). So S in position 2 is fine.

Thus, “STING” is a valid next guess.

Alternative: “SHILK” – but K is less common, and we want to test more likely letters.

Going with “STING”.

But wait – in “STING”, S is in position 1, which is forbidden (feedback says S is not in position 1). So S cannot be in position 1, and must be in 2,3, or 5.

Similarly, L cannot be in position 2; it can be in 1,3,4,5.

Let me try “SHILK” – no, that’s not a valid word.

Let me think of words with S not in 1 or 4, and L not in 2.

Valid options:
- “BLISS” – L in 2 is forbidden.
- “CLIPS” – P is out.
- “FLISK” – K is uncommon.
- “GLINT” – N is new, T is new, I is new; S is in 5 (allowed), L is in 2 (forbidden).
- “SLINK” – K is new, S is in 1 (forbidden).
- “SNILT” – N, I, L, T are new; S in 1 (forbidden).
- “SHILT” – H, I, L, T are new; S in 1 (forbidden).

Hmm, many common words have flawed positional constraints.

Let me try “SHILK” – not a word.

Another approach: pick a word with S in 3 or 5, and L in 1,3,4,5, but not 2.

“SHILK” isn’t valid.

“STINK” – K is new, S in 2 (allowed), L in 3 (allowed); T, I, N are new.

Yes! “STINK” satisfies:
- S not in 1 or 4 (it’s in 2).
- L not in 2 (it’s in 3).
- Letters S, T, I, N, K have not been eliminated.

That seems safe.

Guess 3: STINK -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(-) N(x) K(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From all feedback so far:

Eliminated letters: A, R, O, E, U, M, P, T, N, K  
Confirmed letters: S and L (both in wrong positions)

Position constraints:
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
- L cannot be in positions 2.

Also, from Guess 3:
- I is in the word but not in position 3.

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, S, L, I, Y, W, V, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S, L, and I.
2. S is in positions 2, 3, or 5.
3. L is in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
4. I is not in position 3.
5. Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Let’s list possible positions for S, L, I:

Possible positions:
S: 2, 3, 5
L: 1, 3, 4, 5
I: 1, 2, 4, 5 (cannot be 3)

We need to place S, L, I and two other fresh consonants.

Try to put S in 2, L in 1, I in 4:
L S _ I _

Fill blanks with new common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, Y, W, V.

“LISBS” – invalid (B is fine, but “LISBS” isn’t a word).
“LISCH” – “LISCH” isn’t valid.
“LISBY” – not a word.

Try “LISPS” – P is out.

Try “LISER” – E, R are out.

Try “LISON” – O, N are out.

Try “LISKY” – K is out.

Try “LISSE” – E is out.

Try “LISIA” – A is out.

Hmm, many combinations give invalid or obscure words.

Let me try S in 3, L in 1, I in 2:

Try “LISSA” – A is out.

Try “LISSY” – no.

Try “LISSY” – no.

Let me try S in 5, L in 3, I in 1:
I _ L _ S

Fill with common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, Y, W, V.

“ILYSS” – not a word.
“ICHLS” – not a word.
“IDLSH” – not a word.

Try “ILYSS” – no.

Try “ILYSS” – no.

Let me try S in 5, L in 1, I in 4:
L _ _ I S

Fill: L I _ I S – but I is in 4, so L I _ I S.

“LI_DIS” – “LI_DIS” isn’t a word.

Try “LILIS” – but L is in 1 (allowed), I is in 2 (allowed), L is in 3 (allowed), I is in 4 (allowed), S is in 5 (allowed).

“LILIS” is a valid word (a plant). It satisfies:
- S is in 5 (allowed).
- L is in 1 (allowed).
- I is in 2 (allowed).
- Letters L, I, S have not been exhausted.

Another candidate: “LILTS” – T is out.

Another: “LILAC” – A is out.

Another: “LILTH” – H is new, but “LILTH” is obscure.

“LILIS” is the clearest valid word that fits all constraints.

So I will go with “LILIS”.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SLUMP -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(-) U(x) M(x) P(x)
Guess 3: STINK -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(-) N(x) K(x)
Guess 4: LILIS -> FEEDBACK: L(-) I(✓) L(✓) I(-) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on LILIS:

- L(-)  → L is in the word but not in position 1.
- I(✓)  → I is correct in position 2.
- L(✓)  → L is correct in position 3.
- I(-)  → I is in the word but not in position 4 (we already know it’s in 2, so this is consistent).
- S(✓)  → S is correct in position 5.

So the secret word has the pattern:

_  I  L  _  S

Letters already confirmed: I (pos 2), L (pos 3), S (pos 5).

Letters still needed: positions 1 and 4.

From earlier eliminations, forbidden letters include: A, R, O, E, U, M, P, T, N, K.

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, W, Y, V, etc.

We need two distinct letters from that set, one for position 1 and one for position 4, forming a valid English word.

Candidate words matching _ I L _ S:

- B I L B S – not a word.
- C I L C S – not a word.
- D I L D S – not a word.
- F I L F S – not a word.
- G I L G S – not a word.
- H I L H S – not a word.
- W I L W S – not a word.
- Y I L Y S – not a word.
- V I L V S – not a word.

Real English words that fit _ I L _ S:

- B I L L S – but we already have L in position 3, so pos 4 would need L again (double L), and the word would be B I L L S.  “BILLS” is a valid word.

Check constraints:
- B is new, allowed.
- I in 2 (✓), L in 3 (✓), L in 4 (allowed), S in 5 (✓).
- No forbidden letters.

So “BILLS” satisfies every constraint.

Other possibilities exist (C, D, F, G, H, W, Y, V could all generate words), but “BILLS” is the most common and fits perfectly.
