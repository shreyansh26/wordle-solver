### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position. Other good options might be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"", but ""AROSE"" seems like a solid first choice.

Summary of what we know so far:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, C, H

Letters that ARE in the word (positions unknown):
I, N, K  (from CHINK feedback: I(-), N(-), K(-))

So the secret word must contain the letters I, N, K each exactly once and two other letters from the still-unused letters: B, D, F, G, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Also:
- I cannot be in position 4 (from UNTIL) and cannot be in position 3 (from CHINK).
- N cannot be in position 2 (from UNTIL) and cannot be in position 4 (from CHINK).
- K cannot be in position 5 (from CHINK).

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses I, N, K exactly once each.
2. Adds two new letters from the remaining pool.
3. Respects the positional restrictions above.

Good remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try to place I, N, K while satisfying the restrictions.

Possible placements (before computing an actual word):
- I can be in positions 1, 2, 5 (not 3 or 4)
- N can be in positions 1, 3, 5 (not 2 or 4)
- K can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (not 5)

Trying to put them together while respecting these:

Option 1: I in 1, N in 3, K in 2 → I K N _ _
   Need two more letters from remaining pool.  
   Candidate: I K N _ _ → “INKY” (but Y is allowed, K is used, I is used, N is used, Y is new).  
   However, we need 5 letters. “INKY” is 4 letters + 1Y, so no.

Option 2: I in 5, N in 1, K in 2 → N K _ _ I  
   Need two letters: “NBKI” – not valid.  
   “NICKI” – invalid.  
   “NIMBI” – invalid.

Option 3: I in 2, N in 1, K in 4 → N I _ K _  
   “NIMIK” – invalid.

Option 4: I in 5, N in 3, K in 1 → K _ N _ I  
   “KINBI” – invalid.

Option 5: I in 2, N in 5, K in 3 → _ I K _ N  
   “M I K _ N” → “MIKAN” – not a word.  
   “P I K _ N” → “PIKAN” – not a word.

Option 6: I in 1, N in 5, K in 3 → I _ K _ N  
   “I M K _ N” → “IMKAN” – invalid.

Option 7: I in 5, N in 1, K in 2 → same as Option 2.

Option 8: I in 5, N in 3, K in 1 → same as Option 4.

Option 9: I in 3, N in 1, K in 2 → same as CHINK (but we already played it and got feedback).

Option 10: I in 3, N in 5, K in 4 → same as CHINK.

From these, the only valid 5-letter words I can form that use I, N, K plus two new letters from the remaining pool are very rare. Let me instead pick a word that uses I, N, K plus one new letter, and check positions.

A concrete valid word: “MINKY”
- Letters: M, I, N, K, Y  
- All letters are either confirmed (I, N, K) or new (M, Y).  
- Positions:  
  – I is in position 2 (allowed)  
  – N is in position 3 (allowed)  
  – K is in position 4 (allowed)  
- No disallowed letters are used.

Therefore, “MINKY” is a legal next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position. Other good options might be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"", but ""AROSE"" seems like a solid first choice.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a large chunk of common 5-letter words.  
I need a fresh set of high-frequency letters that weren’t used yet.  
Good candidates that are still common and unused:  
- U, I, T, N, L, C, H, D, M, Y, etc.  

Combining them into common 5-letter words gives options like:
- UNTIL
- CHIMP
- MOUNT
- YOUTH
- COUNT

“COUNT” uses C, O, U, N, T.  
Since O was already ruled out, I’ll swap to a word without O, UNTIL uses U, N, T, I, L—all still possible.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) L(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ none of A, R, O, S, E appear anywhere in the word.

2. UNTIL → U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) L(x)  
   ⇒  
   - U, T, L are not in the word at all.  
   - N is in the word but not in position 2.  
   - I is in the word but not in position 4.

So the remaining letters we haven’t tried yet that are still possible include: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the confirmed letters N and I (whose exact positions are still unknown).

I want a word that:
- Uses N and I (both must appear).  
- Places N somewhere other than position 2.  
- Places I somewhere other than position 4.  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

A straightforward choice is “CHINK”:
- C, H, K are still possible.  
- N is in position 3 (allowed).  
- I is in position 2 (allowed).  
- No disallowed letters are used.

From the new feedback on MINKY:

- I is now ✓ in position 2  
- N is now ✓ in position 3  
- K is in the word but not in position 4 (so K must be in 1 or 5)  
- Y is ✓ in position 5  
- M is not in the word at all (x)

So the pattern so far is:

_ I N _ Y  
with K somewhere in 1 or 5, and the remaining two letters drawn from the still-unused set: B, D, F, G, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

If K is in position 1:

K I N _ Y  
The fourth letter must be one of the remaining letters.  
A quick check of valid English 5-letter words gives “KINCY” (invalid), “KINNY” (invalid), “KINGY” (valid).

If K is in position 5:

_ I N K Y  
The first letter must be one of the remaining letters.  
Possible words: “PINNY” (invalid), “DINGY” (valid).

So the two possible candidate words are “KINGY” (K in 1) and “DINGY” (K in 5).

“DINGY” fits all constraints:
- D, I, N, G, Y  
- I in 2, N in 3, Y in 5 ✓  
- K is not used (we already know K must appear; the word must contain K)  
Wait, “DINGY” does NOT contain K, so it’s invalid.

“KINGY” contains K in position 1, I in 2, N in 3, G in 4, Y in 5.  
This satisfies:
- K is in the word (position 1)  
- I in 2, N in 3, Y in 5 ✓  
- No disallowed letters (A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, C, H, M are all excluded)  
- All letters are allowed.

Therefore, “KINGY” is the next logical guess.
