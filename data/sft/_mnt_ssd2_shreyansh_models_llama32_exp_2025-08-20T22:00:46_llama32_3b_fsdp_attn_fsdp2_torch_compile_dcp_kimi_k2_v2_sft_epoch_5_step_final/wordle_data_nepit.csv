1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains the most common vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word.

Another consideration is that I want to avoid repeating letters in the first guess to maximize the information gained. The word ""AROSE"" fits this well with no repeated letters.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:

- Does NOT contain A, R, O, or S.

3. Uses common remaining consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and O are out).

- Uses E in the 4th position (not 5th), satisfying the feedback.
- Avoids A, R, O, S.
- Introduces new letters U, N, T, I to test.

- N – known to be in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from UNTIE and TENIC feedback)

Letters confirmed NOT in the word:
A, R, O, S, U, C

So the pattern so far is:

Remaining letters we still need to place:
- N must go in position 1 or 5 (since it can’t be 2 or 3)
- T must go in position 2, 4, or 5 (but 2 is already E, 4 is I), so T must be in position 5
- That leaves position 1 or 3 for N, but N can’t be in 3 (from TENIC feedback), so N must be in position 1

Thus the only possible arrangement is:
N E _ I T

The blank (position 3) must be a letter that hasn’t been ruled out yet and is different from the already-used letters. Available consonants (not yet ruled out) include D, L, M, P, Y, etc.

Looking at common 5-letter words matching “NEIT?” we find “NEITH” (a variant spelling) but more likely “NEIGH”. However, G hasn’t been tested yet and is common.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains the most common vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word.

Another consideration is that I want to avoid repeating letters in the first guess to maximize the information gained. The word ""AROSE"" fits this well with no repeated letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are all NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E, but not in the 5th position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, or S.

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses E somewhere except the last slot.
2. Avoids A, R, O, S entirely.
3. Uses common remaining consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and O are out).

A strong second guess that fits these constraints is ""UNTIE"":
- Uses E in the 4th position (not 5th), satisfying the feedback.
- Avoids A, R, O, S.
- Introduces new letters U, N, T, I to test.

Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) T(-) I(✓) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. UNTIE → U(x) N(-) T(-) I(✓) E(-)
   - U is not in the word.
   - N is in the word but not in position 2.
   - T is in the word but not in position 3.
   - I is in the word and is in position 4 (✓).
   - E is in the word but not in position 5 (confirms round-1).

Known facts so far:
- Word has the pattern: _ _ _ I _
- Must contain: E, N, T
- Must NOT contain: A, R, O, S, U
- E cannot be in position 5
- N cannot be in position 2
- T cannot be in position 3

Remaining common consonants to test: C, D, L, M, P, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: only E and I are confirmed/used so far; Y can act as a vowel.

Let’s try a word that places E in position 1, N in position 3, T in position 2, and uses fresh consonants for positions 3 and 5. A good candidate is “TENIC”.

Check:
- T in position 1: allowed (no restriction yet).
- E in position 2: allowed.
- N in position 3: allowed (only restriction is N≠2).
- I in position 4: matches ✓.
- C in position 5: new letter.
- Final letter: C is unused so far and is common.

“TENIC” satisfies all constraints.

Let’s update our knowledge after the four guesses.

Confirmed letters and positions:
- N is in position 1 (✓)
- E is in position 2 (✓)

Confirmed letters (but wrong positions):
- I: was ✓ in UNTIE but now shows (-) in NEIGH, so I must appear but NOT in position 4
- T: was allowed in position 5 but now shows (-) in NEIGH, so T must appear but NOT in position 5

Confirmed letters NOT in the word:
A, R, O, S, U, C, G, H

So the pattern so far is:
N E _ _ _

Remaining constraints:
- I must appear somewhere in positions 3 or 5 (since it can’t be 4)
- T must appear somewhere in positions 3 or 5 (since it can’t be 5)
- The remaining blank (position 3 or 5) must be filled with a letter not yet ruled out. Available consonants include D, L, M, P, Y, etc.

Possible arrangements:
1. N E I _ T  → but then I is in position 3 and T in 5, but T can’t be in 5 (from NEIGH feedback)
2. N E _ I T  → but T is in 5 which is disallowed
3. N E T _ I  → T in 3, I in 5. This satisfies all constraints:
   - N in 1 ✓
   - E in 2 ✓
   - T in 3 (allowed)
   - I in 5 (allowed)
   - No disallowed letters used

Therefore the only possible word is N E T _ I, with the blank in position 3.

But we need to check if “NET” plus a letter is valid. Actually, the pattern is N E T _ I, so the blank is position 4.

Looking at valid 5-letter words starting with “NET” and ending with “I”:
- N E T A I → A is ruled out
- N E T E I → E is already used in position 2
- N E T I I → I already in position 5
- N E T S I → S is ruled out
- N E T L I → “NETLI” is not a word
- N E T C I → C is ruled out
- N E T D I → “NETDI” is not a word
- N E T M I → “NETMI” is not a word
- N E T P I → “NETPI” is not a word
- N E T Y I → “NETYI” is not a word

Wait, let’s re-examine the constraints more carefully.

From NEIGH feedback:
- N(✓) E(✓) I(-) G(x) H(x) implies:
   - N and E are correctly placed in positions 1 and 2
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 4 (so must be in 3 or 5)
   - G and H are not in the word

So the pattern is N E _ _ _, and we must place I and T in positions 3 or 5, plus one more letter.

Valid 5-letter words fitting N E _ _ _ with I and T in 3/5:
- N E W I T → W is allowed, and this fits all constraints:
   - N in 1 ✓
   - E in 2 ✓
   - W new letter
   - I in 5 (allowed)
   - T in 3 (allowed)

Let’s verify:
- N:1 ✓
- E:2 ✓
- W: new letter, not ruled out
- I:5 allowed
- T:3 allowed

This satisfies all constraints.

   - E in 2 ✓
   - T in 3 (allowed)
   - I in 5 (allowed)
   - No disallowed letters used

Therefore the only possible word is N E T _ I, with the blank in position 3.

But we need to check if “NET” plus a letter is valid. Actually, the pattern is N E T _ I, so the blank is position 4.

Looking at valid 5-letter words starting with “NET” and ending with “I”:
- N E T A I → A is ruled out
- N E T E I → E is already used in position 2
- N E T I I → I already in position 5
- N E T S I → S is ruled out
- N E T L I → “NETLI” is not a word
- N E T C I → C is ruled out
- N E T D I → “NETDI” is not a word
- N E T M I → “NETMI” is not a word
- N E T P I → “NETPI” is not a word
- N E T Y I → “NETYI” is not a word

Wait, let’s re-examine the constraints more carefully.

From NEIGH feedback:
- N(✓) E(✓) I(-) G(x) H(x) implies:
   - N and E are correctly placed in positions 1 and 2
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 4 (so must be in 3 or 5)
   - G and H are not in the word

So the pattern is N E _ _ _, and we must place I and T in positions 3 or 5, plus one more letter.

Valid 5-letter words fitting N E _ _ _ with I and T in 3/5:
- N E W I T → W is allowed, and this fits all constraints:
   - N in 1 ✓
   - E in 2 ✓
   - W new letter
   - I in 5 (allowed)
   - T in 3 (allowed)

Let’s verify:
- N:1 ✓
- E:2 ✓
- W: new letter, not ruled out
- I:5 allowed
- T:3 allowed

This satisfies all constraints.",Guess 5: NEWIT -> FEEDBACK: N(✓) E(✓) W(x) I(✓) T(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains the most common vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word.

Another consideration is that I want to avoid repeating letters in the first guess to maximize the information gained. The word ""AROSE"" fits this well with no repeated letters.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are all NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E, but not in the 5th position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, or S.

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses E somewhere except the last slot.
2. Avoids A, R, O, S entirely.
3. Uses common remaining consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and O are out).

A strong second guess that fits these constraints is ""UNTIE"":
- Uses E in the 4th position (not 5th), satisfying the feedback.
- Avoids A, R, O, S.
- Introduces new letters U, N, T, I to test.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) T(-) I(✓) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. UNTIE → U(x) N(-) T(-) I(✓) E(-)
   - U is not in the word.
   - N is in the word but not in position 2.
   - T is in the word but not in position 3.
   - I is in the word and is in position 4 (✓).
   - E is in the word but not in position 5 (confirms round-1).

Known facts so far:
- Word has the pattern: _ _ _ I _
- Must contain: E, N, T
- Must NOT contain: A, R, O, S, U
- E cannot be in position 5
- N cannot be in position 2
- T cannot be in position 3

Remaining common consonants to test: C, D, L, M, P, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: only E and I are confirmed/used so far; Y can act as a vowel.

Let’s try a word that places E in position 1, N in position 3, T in position 2, and uses fresh consonants for positions 3 and 5. A good candidate is “TENIC”.

Check:
- T in position 1: allowed (no restriction yet).
- E in position 2: allowed.
- N in position 3: allowed (only restriction is N≠2).
- I in position 4: matches ✓.
- C in position 5: new letter.
- Final letter: C is unused so far and is common.

“TENIC” satisfies all constraints.

<guess>TENIC</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) T(-) I(✓) E(-)
Guess 3: TENIC -> FEEDBACK: T(-) E(✓) N(-) I(✓) C(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

Letters confirmed to be in the word:
- E – now known to be in position 2 (from TENIC feedback: E(✓))
- I – known to be in position 4 (from UNTIE feedback: I(✓))
- N – known to be in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from UNTIE and TENIC feedback)
- T – known to be in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 3 (from UNTIE and TENIC feedback)

Letters confirmed NOT in the word:
A, R, O, S, U, C

So the pattern so far is:
_ E _ I _

Remaining letters we still need to place:
- N must go in position 1 or 5 (since it can’t be 2 or 3)
- T must go in position 2, 4, or 5 (but 2 is already E, 4 is I), so T must be in position 5
- That leaves position 1 or 3 for N, but N can’t be in 3 (from TENIC feedback), so N must be in position 1

Thus the only possible arrangement is:
N E _ I T

The blank (position 3) must be a letter that hasn’t been ruled out yet and is different from the already-used letters. Available consonants (not yet ruled out) include D, L, M, P, Y, etc.

Looking at common 5-letter words matching “NEIT?” we find “NEITH” (a variant spelling) but more likely “NEIGH”. However, G hasn’t been tested yet and is common.

But let’s double-check:
- N in 1: allowed
- E in 2: matches ✓
- _ in 3: must be a new letter not yet ruled out
- I in 4: matches ✓
- T in 5: allowed

Thus the word must be NEIGH.

But wait, let’s verify:
- N: position 1 – allowed
- E: position 2 – matches ✓
- G: new letter, not ruled out
- H: new letter, not ruled out
- I: position 4 – matches ✓
- T: position 5 – allowed

So the only possible word is NEIGH.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) T(-) I(✓) E(-)
Guess 3: TENIC -> FEEDBACK: T(-) E(✓) N(-) I(✓) C(x)
Guess 4: NEIGH -> FEEDBACK: N(✓) E(✓) I(-) G(x) H(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let’s update our knowledge after the four guesses.

Confirmed letters and positions:
- N is in position 1 (✓)
- E is in position 2 (✓)

Confirmed letters (but wrong positions):
- I: was ✓ in UNTIE but now shows (-) in NEIGH, so I must appear but NOT in position 4
- T: was allowed in position 5 but now shows (-) in NEIGH, so T must appear but NOT in position 5

Confirmed letters NOT in the word:
A, R, O, S, U, C, G, H

So the pattern so far is:
N E _ _ _

Remaining constraints:
- I must appear somewhere in positions 3 or 5 (since it can’t be 4)
- T must appear somewhere in positions 3 or 5 (since it can’t be 5)
- The remaining blank (position 3 or 5) must be filled with a letter not yet ruled out. Available consonants include D, L, M, P, Y, etc.

Possible arrangements:
1. N E I _ T  → but then I is in position 3 and T in 5, but T can’t be in 5 (from NEIGH feedback)
2. N E _ I T  → but T is in 5 which is disallowed
3. N E T _ I  → T in 3, I in 5. This satisfies all constraints:
   - N in 1 ✓
   - E in 2 ✓
   - T in 3 (allowed)
   - I in 5 (allowed)
   - No disallowed letters used

Therefore the only possible word is N E T _ I, with the blank in position 3.

But we need to check if “NET” plus a letter is valid. Actually, the pattern is N E T _ I, so the blank is position 4.

Looking at valid 5-letter words starting with “NET” and ending with “I”:
- N E T A I → A is ruled out
- N E T E I → E is already used in position 2
- N E T I I → I already in position 5
- N E T S I → S is ruled out
- N E T L I → “NETLI” is not a word
- N E T C I → C is ruled out
- N E T D I → “NETDI” is not a word
- N E T M I → “NETMI” is not a word
- N E T P I → “NETPI” is not a word
- N E T Y I → “NETYI” is not a word

Wait, let’s re-examine the constraints more carefully.

From NEIGH feedback:
- N(✓) E(✓) I(-) G(x) H(x) implies:
   - N and E are correctly placed in positions 1 and 2
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 4 (so must be in 3 or 5)
   - G and H are not in the word

So the pattern is N E _ _ _, and we must place I and T in positions 3 or 5, plus one more letter.

Valid 5-letter words fitting N E _ _ _ with I and T in 3/5:
- N E W I T → W is allowed, and this fits all constraints:
   - N in 1 ✓
   - E in 2 ✓
   - W new letter
   - I in 5 (allowed)
   - T in 3 (allowed)

Let’s verify:
- N:1 ✓
- E:2 ✓
- W: new letter, not ruled out
- I:5 allowed
- T:3 allowed

This satisfies all constraints.
