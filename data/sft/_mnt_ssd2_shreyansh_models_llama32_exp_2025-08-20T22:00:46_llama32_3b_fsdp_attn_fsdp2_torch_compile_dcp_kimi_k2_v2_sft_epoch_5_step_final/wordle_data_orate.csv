For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel in English)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters that might be in the secret word, whether they're in the correct position or just present in the word.

Other good alternatives could be ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"", but I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a well-balanced starting word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S and L are NOT in the word (x).
- A, T, and E are in the word and in the correct positions (✓).

So the secret word has the pattern:
_ _ A T E

We know:
- The first letter is NOT S (and likely not L, since L is also wrong).
- The second letter is NOT any of S, L, A, T, E (since A and T are already placed).
- The third letter is A (fixed).
- The fourth letter is T (fixed).
- The fifth letter is E (fixed).

So the word is really: [unknown][unknown]ATE

I need a 5-letter word that ends in ""ATE"" and doesn't contain S or L. Common words that fit: CRATE, BRATE, GRATE, FRAME, etc.

Let me think of possible first letters that haven't been ruled out:
- C, B, G, F, P, R, etc.

""CRATE"" is a good candidate because:
- It uses C (not ruled out yet)
- R (not ruled out yet)
- A, T, E are already confirmed in their positions.

Other possibilities like ""BRATE"" or ""GRATE"" would also work, but ""CRATE"" is a common word and uses different letters.

I'll go with CRATE.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel in English)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters that might be in the secret word, whether they're in the correct position or just present in the word.

Other good alternatives could be ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"", but I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a well-balanced starting word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S and L are NOT in the word (x).
- A, T, and E are in the word and in the correct positions (✓).

So the secret word has the pattern:
_ _ A T E

We know:
- The first letter is NOT S (and likely not L, since L is also wrong).
- The second letter is NOT any of S, L, A, T, E (since A and T are already placed).
- The third letter is A (fixed).
- The fourth letter is T (fixed).
- The fifth letter is E (fixed).

So the word is really: [unknown][unknown]ATE

I need a 5-letter word that ends in ""ATE"" and doesn't contain S or L. Common words that fit: CRATE, BRATE, GRATE, FRAME, etc.

Let me think of possible first letters that haven't been ruled out:
- C, B, G, F, P, R, etc.

""CRATE"" is a good candidate because:
- It uses C (not ruled out yet)
- R (not ruled out yet)
- A, T, E are already confirmed in their positions.

Other possibilities like ""BRATE"" or ""GRATE"" would also work, but ""CRATE"" is a common word and uses different letters.

I'll go with CRATE.

Guess 2: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Current confirmed information:
- Pattern: _ R A T E
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, C
- Letters already placed: R (2nd), A (3rd), T (4th), E (5th)

We need a 5-letter word that matches _ R A T E and doesn't use S, L, or C.

Possible first letters (not yet ruled out): B, D, F, G, P, V, W, etc.

Common words ending in ""RATE"":
- BRATE (but L is already out, and BRATE doesn't use L)
- GRATE (but G is possible)
- FRAME (but F is possible)
- CRATE (already tried, C is out)
- PRATE (but P is possible)

Looking at the pattern _ R A T E, the most common word that fits is ""BRATE"" (B-R-A-T-E). Since B hasn't been ruled out and we haven't tested it yet, it's a strong candidate.

Other possibilities like ""GRATE"" or ""PRATE"" could also work, but ""BRATE"" is a common word and uses B, which hasn't been eliminated.

I'll go with BRATE.

Among these, “GRATE” uses a new letter G for the first position and fits the pattern perfectly. Since G hasn’t been marked “x” yet, it remains the most plausible candidate.

“FRAME” uses F, which has not appeared in any previous guess, and is a common word. Since the pattern is _ R A T E, “FRAME” would be F-R-A-M-E, but that doesn’t match _ R A T E. Wait, I made a mistake: the pattern is _ R A T E, so the first letter must be followed by R, A, T, E. Therefore, the word must be [first letter] R A T E.

Looking at the remaining common words: FRAME would be F-R-A-M-E, which doesn’t fit (_ R A T E). So FRAME is invalid. The only valid candidate left seems to be “PRATE” (P-R-A-T-E), but we haven’t tested P yet.

Wait, let me list all valid 5-letter words matching _ R A T E:
- BRATE – B out
- CRATE – C out
- GRATE – G out

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S and L are NOT in the word (x).
- A, T, and E are in the word and in the correct positions (✓).

So the secret word has the pattern:
_ _ A T E

We know:
- The first letter is NOT S (and likely not L, since L is also wrong).
- The second letter is NOT any of S, L, A, T, E (since A and T are already placed).
- The third letter is A (fixed).
- The fourth letter is T (fixed).
- The fifth letter is E (fixed).

So the word is really: [unknown][unknown]ATE

I need a 5-letter word that ends in ""ATE"" and doesn't contain S or L. Common words that fit: CRATE, BRATE, GRATE, FRAME, etc.

Let me think of possible first letters that haven't been ruled out:
- C, B, G, F, P, R, etc.

""CRATE"" is a good candidate because:
- It uses C (not ruled out yet)
- R (not ruled out yet)
- A, T, E are already confirmed in their positions.

Other possibilities like ""BRATE"" or ""GRATE"" would also work, but ""CRATE"" is a common word and uses different letters.

I'll go with CRATE.

Guess 2: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Current confirmed information:
- Pattern: _ R A T E
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, C
- Letters already placed: R (2nd), A (3rd), T (4th), E (5th)

We need a 5-letter word that matches _ R A T E and doesn't use S, L, or C.

Possible first letters (not yet ruled out): B, D, F, G, P, V, W, etc.

Common words ending in ""RATE"":
- BRATE (but L is already out, and BRATE doesn't use L)
- GRATE (but G is possible)
- FRAME (but F is possible)
- CRATE (already tried, C is out)
- PRATE (but P is possible)

Looking at the pattern _ R A T E, the most common word that fits is ""BRATE"" (B-R-A-T-E). Since B hasn't been ruled out and we haven't tested it yet, it's a strong candidate.

Other possibilities like ""GRATE"" or ""PRATE"" could also work, but ""BRATE"" is a common word and uses B, which hasn't been eliminated.

I'll go with BRATE.

Guess 3: BRATE -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We now know the exact pattern: _ R A T E  
Letters confirmed NOT in the word: S, L, C, B  
Letters already correctly placed: R (2nd), A (3rd), T (4th), E (5th)

The missing first letter must be:
- not S, L, C, or B  
- and not yet tested by the other known letters (R, A, T, E)

Quick scan of common English 5-letter words ending in “RATE”:
- GRATE (G not yet ruled out)  
- FRAME (F not yet ruled out)  
- PRATE (P not yet ruled out)  
- BRATE (already tried; B is out)  
- CRATE (C out)  
- SLATE (S, L out)

Among these, “GRATE” uses a new letter G for the first position and fits the pattern perfectly. Since G hasn’t been marked “x” yet, it remains the most plausible candidate.

We have the fixed pattern _ R A T E and we have eliminated S, L, C, B, G from the first position.

Still open for the first letter: D, F, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Among common English 5-letter words ending in “RATE”, the next most likely candidates are:
- FRAME (F not yet ruled out)
- PRATE (P not yet ruled out)
- BRATE (already tried; B is out)
- CRATE (C out)
- SLATE (S, L out)

“FRAME” uses F, which has not appeared in any previous guess, and is a common word. Since the pattern is _ R A T E, “FRAME” would be F-R-A-M-E, but that doesn’t match _ R A T E. Wait, I made a mistake: the pattern is _ R A T E, so the first letter must be followed by R, A, T, E. Therefore, the word must be [first letter] R A T E.

Looking at the remaining common words: FRAME would be F-R-A-M-E, which doesn’t fit (_ R A T E). So FRAME is invalid. The only valid candidate left seems to be “PRATE” (P-R-A-T-E), but we haven’t tested P yet.

Wait, let me list all valid 5-letter words matching _ R A T E:
- BRATE – B out
- CRATE – C out
- GRATE – G out
- SLATE – S, L out
- FRAME – doesn’t fit _ R A T E
- PRATE – P is still allowed
- TRATE – not a valid word
- DRATE – not a valid word
- FRATE – not a valid word
- IRATE – not a valid word
- ORATE – O is possible but hasn’t been tested
- URATE – not a valid word
- WRATE – not a valid word
- YRATE – not a valid word

The only valid word left seems to be “PRATE”. Let me verify: P has not been used or ruled out yet, and the word PRATE is valid.

So the next logical guess is PRATE.
