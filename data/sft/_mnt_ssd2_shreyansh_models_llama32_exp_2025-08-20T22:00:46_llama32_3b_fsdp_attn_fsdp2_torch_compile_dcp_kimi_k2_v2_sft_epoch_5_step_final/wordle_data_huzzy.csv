3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use several of these letters to help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

Some popular and effective first guesses include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes C, R, A, N, E - covering 5 of the most common letters and potentially giving us good feedback on multiple letters.

All five letters in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) are marked “x”, meaning none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
Therefore, the remaining alphabet still contains all other letters.

The letters O, U, T, L, S, I, M, P, D, G, B, F, H, K, Y, W, V, Z, X, Q, J are still untouched.

A good choice would use five fresh, high-frequency letters from outside {C, R, A, N, E}.  
Among those, “SLOTH” is attractive: S, L, O, T, H are all new and fairly common.  
Another option is “PLUMB” (P, L, U, M, B), but “SLOTH” feels slightly more balanced.

So far we know:

- Letters completely absent from the word: C, R, A, N, E, S, L, O, T
- Letter present but in the wrong position: H (it is somewhere in the word, but not in position 5)

That leaves the following available letters:
B, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We also know the word is 5 letters long and contains the letter H somewhere other than the last position.

A good next guess should:
1. Use H in a different position (to narrow down where H can be)
2. Include several of the still-untested, common letters
3. Not use any of the already-eliminated letters

Common, still-untested letters: I, D, G, M, B, F, K, U, Y

Let’s try a word that places H in position 2 and uses four of those letters: B, I, D, G.

One such word is “BIGHD” (B-I-G-H-D), but that isn’t a valid English word.  
Another possibility: “DINGY” – valid, uses D, I, N, G, Y.  However N was already eliminated in Guess 1.  
“MIGHT” – uses M, I, G, H, T.  T is eliminated.  
“FUMED” – uses F, U, M, E, D.  E is eliminated.  

Let’s try “DINGY” even though N was eliminated; the word is valid and uses fresh letters; N is not in it.  Wait – “DINGY” has N in the second position, which would be a repeat of N.  That’s not allowed because N was already ruled out.

Let’s pick “MIGHT” instead: M, I, G, H, T.  T is eliminated, so that’s out.

Another candidate: “FUMED” – invalid because E is out.

“WINDY” – uses W, I, N, D, Y.  N is eliminated.

“PUDGY” – uses P, U, D, G, Y.  All letters are still allowed.

But let’s try “HUMID” – H, U, M, I, D.  All letters are still allowed and H is in position 1 (new position).

Actually, “HUMID” is a good choice: H in position 1, U, M, I, D all fresh and common.

But to maximize coverage, let’s use “DINGY” even though N is eliminated – it’s a valid word and uses D, I, N, G, Y.  Wait, N is invalid.  

Let’s go with “HUMID”.

Let’s try a word that places H in position 2 and uses four of those letters: B, I, D, G.

One such word is “BIGHD” (B-I-G-H-D), but that isn’t a valid English word.  
Another possibility: “DINGY” – valid, uses D, I, N, G, Y.  However N was already eliminated in Guess 1.  
“MIGHT” – uses M, I, G, H, T.  T is eliminated.  
“FUMED” – uses F, U, M, E, D.  E is eliminated.  

Let’s try “DINGY” even though N was eliminated; the word is valid and uses fresh letters; N is not in it.  Wait – “DINGY” has N in the second position, which would be a repeat of N.  That’s not allowed because N was already ruled out.

Let’s pick “MIGHT” instead: M, I, G, H, T.  T is eliminated, so that’s out.

Another candidate: “FUMED” – invalid because E is out.

“WINDY” – uses W, I, N, D, Y.  N is eliminated.

“PUDGY” – uses P, U, D, G, Y.  All letters are still allowed.

But let’s try “HUMID” – H, U, M, I, D.  All letters are still allowed and H is in position 1 (new position).

Actually, “HUMID” is a good choice: H in position 1, U, M, I, D all fresh and common.

But to maximize coverage, let’s use “DINGY” even though N is eliminated – it’s a valid word and uses D, I, N, G, Y.  Wait, N is invalid.  

Let’s go with “HUMID”.

Alternatively, “FUMED” is invalid (E).  

Another valid word: “PUDGY” – uses P, U, D, G, Y.

I’ll choose “HUMID”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use several of these letters to help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

Some popular and effective first guesses include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes C, R, A, N, E - covering 5 of the most common letters and potentially giving us good feedback on multiple letters.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

All five letters in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) are marked “x”, meaning none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
Therefore, the remaining alphabet still contains all other letters.  
To maximize information on the next guess, I should pick a word that uses entirely different letters, particularly common ones that were not in CRANE.  
The letters O, U, T, L, S, I, M, P, D, G, B, F, H, K, Y, W, V, Z, X, Q, J are still untouched.

A good choice would use five fresh, high-frequency letters from outside {C, R, A, N, E}.  
Among those, “SLOTH” is attractive: S, L, O, T, H are all new and fairly common.  
Another option is “PLUMB” (P, L, U, M, B), but “SLOTH” feels slightly more balanced.  
I’ll go with “SLOTH”.

So far we know:

- Letters completely absent from the word: C, R, A, N, E, S, L, O, T
- Letter present but in the wrong position: H (it is somewhere in the word, but not in position 5)

That leaves the following available letters:
B, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We also know the word is 5 letters long and contains the letter H somewhere other than the last position.

A good next guess should:
1. Use H in a different position (to narrow down where H can be)
2. Include several of the still-untested, common letters
3. Not use any of the already-eliminated letters

Common, still-untested letters: I, D, G, M, B, F, K, U, Y

Let’s try a word that places H in position 2 and uses four of those letters: B, I, D, G.

One such word is “BIGHD” (B-I-G-H-D), but that isn’t a valid English word.  
Another possibility: “DINGY” – valid, uses D, I, N, G, Y.  However N was already eliminated in Guess 1.  
“MIGHT” – uses M, I, G, H, T.  T is eliminated.  
“FUMED” – uses F, U, M, E, D.  E is eliminated.  

Let’s try “DINGY” even though N was eliminated; the word is valid and uses fresh letters; N is not in it.  Wait – “DINGY” has N in the second position, which would be a repeat of N.  That’s not allowed because N was already ruled out.

Let’s pick “MIGHT” instead: M, I, G, H, T.  T is eliminated, so that’s out.

Another candidate: “FUMED” – invalid because E is out.

“WINDY” – uses W, I, N, D, Y.  N is eliminated.

“PUDGY” – uses P, U, D, G, Y.  All letters are still allowed.

But let’s try “HUMID” – H, U, M, I, D.  All letters are still allowed and H is in position 1 (new position).

Actually, “HUMID” is a good choice: H in position 1, U, M, I, D all fresh and common.

But to maximize coverage, let’s use “DINGY” even though N is eliminated – it’s a valid word and uses D, I, N, G, Y.  Wait, N is invalid.  

Let’s go with “HUMID”.

Alternatively, “FUMED” is invalid (E).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use several of these letters to help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

Some popular and effective first guesses include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes C, R, A, N, E - covering 5 of the most common letters and potentially giving us good feedback on multiple letters.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

All five letters in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) are marked “x”, meaning none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
Therefore, the remaining alphabet still contains all other letters.  
To maximize information on the next guess, I should pick a word that uses entirely different letters, particularly common ones that were not in CRANE.  
The letters O, U, T, L, S, I, M, P, D, G, B, F, H, K, Y, W, V, Z, X, Q, J are still untouched.

A good choice would use five fresh, high-frequency letters from outside {C, R, A, N, E}.  
Among those, “SLOTH” is attractive: S, L, O, T, H are all new and fairly common.  
Another option is “PLUMB” (P, L, U, M, B), but “SLOTH” feels slightly more balanced.  
I’ll go with “SLOTH”.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: SLOTH -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) O(x) T(x) H(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

So far we know:

- Letters completely absent from the word: C, R, A, N, E, S, L, O, T
- Letter present but in the wrong position: H (it is somewhere in the word, but not in position 5)

That leaves the following available letters:
B, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We also know the word is 5 letters long and contains the letter H somewhere other than the last position.

A good next guess should:
1. Use H in a different position (to narrow down where H can be)
2. Include several of the still-untested, common letters
3. Not use any of the already-eliminated letters

Common, still-untested letters: I, D, G, M, B, F, K, U, Y

Let’s try a word that places H in position 2 and uses four of those letters: B, I, D, G.

One such word is “BIGHD” (B-I-G-H-D), but that isn’t a valid English word.  
Another possibility: “DINGY” – valid, uses D, I, N, G, Y.  However N was already eliminated in Guess 1.  
“MIGHT” – uses M, I, G, H, T.  T is eliminated.  
“FUMED” – uses F, U, M, E, D.  E is eliminated.  

Let’s try “DINGY” even though N was eliminated; the word is valid and uses fresh letters; N is not in it.  Wait – “DINGY” has N in the second position, which would be a repeat of N.  That’s not allowed because N was already ruled out.

Let’s pick “MIGHT” instead: M, I, G, H, T.  T is eliminated, so that’s out.

Another candidate: “FUMED” – invalid because E is out.

“WINDY” – uses W, I, N, D, Y.  N is eliminated.

“PUDGY” – uses P, U, D, G, Y.  All letters are still allowed.

But let’s try “HUMID” – H, U, M, I, D.  All letters are still allowed and H is in position 1 (new position).

Actually, “HUMID” is a good choice: H in position 1, U, M, I, D all fresh and common.

But to maximize coverage, let’s use “DINGY” even though N is eliminated – it’s a valid word and uses D, I, N, G, Y.  Wait, N is invalid.  

Let’s go with “HUMID”.

Alternatively, “FUMED” is invalid (E).  

Another valid word: “PUDGY” – uses P, U, D, G, Y.

I’ll choose “HUMID”.

Guess 3: HUMID -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) U(✓) M(x) I(x) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

What we now know:

1. Letters completely absent from the word: C, R, A, N, E, S, L, O, T, M, I, D  
2. Letters confirmed to be present:
   - H – now known to be in position 1 (✓)  
   - U – somewhere in the word (✓)  
3. Remaining alphabet (besides H and U):
   B, F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  

We still need four more letters.  
We know U is somewhere in the word, so we must place U in positions 2-5 and fill the remaining slots with the still-allowed letters above.  
To maximize information, we should test several new letters at once.  

A good candidate is “HUBBY”:
- H is fixed in position 1.  
- U is in position 2 (a new location).  
- B, Y are fresh letters.  
- The second B and Y would give us feedback on those letters as well as confirming U’s position.  

“HUBBY” is a valid English word and fits all constraints.

   - Position 5: Y (✓)  
3. So far the word looks like: H U _ _ Y  

Letters still allowed (from the remaining alphabet):  
F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  

We need two more letters for positions 3 and 4.  
We want to test as many new, common letters as possible in one guess.  
Among the allowed letters, F, G, K, P are the most frequent.

Looking for 5-letter English words that fit the pattern H U _ _ Y and use only the allowed letters in the blanks.
