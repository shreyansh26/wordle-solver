### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers slightly more common letters. I need to make sure it's a valid 5-letter word, which ""AROSE"" is.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains O and S, but not A, R, or E.
- O is not in the 3rd position.
- S is not in the 4th position.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both O and S.
2. Does not contain A, R, or E.
3. Places O somewhere other than position 3.
4. Places S somewhere other than position 4.

Common letters left to try: T, I, N, L, U, C, D, M, P, Y, etc.

A good candidate is “STOIC”:
- Contains S and O.
- Does not contain A, R, or E.
- S is in position 1 (allowed), T is new, O is in position 3 (but feedback says O is not in position 3, so this violates the feedback). Oops, that won’t work.

Next candidate: “SOUND”:
- Contains S and O.
- Does not contain A, R, or E.
- S is in position 1, O in position 2 – both allowed.
This works.

Another candidate: “SNOUT”:
- Also valid, but SOUND seems slightly more common.

I’ll go with SOUND.

Let’s consolidate what we now know.

Known facts
1. Word pattern: _ O _ _ _  (O is locked in position 2).
2. Letters that are definitely in the word: S, N, D  (each appears once).
3. Letters that are definitely out: A, R, E, U, M, L, Y.
4. Additional positional restrictions:
   – S cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4 (from AROSE and MOLDY feedback).
   – D cannot be in positions 4, 5 (from MOLDY feedback).
   – N cannot be in position 4 (from SOUND feedback).

So the five positions look like:
1 2 3 4 5
? O ? ? ?

with the set {S, N, D} among positions 1, 3, 5.

Possible assignments (without repetition):
- S can only be in 3 or 5.
- D can only be in 1, 3.
- N can be in 1, 3, 5.

We need one more letter that is not in {A, R, E, U, M, L, Y}.  
Available letters: C, F, G, H, I, K, P, T, V, W, X, Z.

Let’s try to make valid 5-letter words meeting all these constraints.

Try slotting S, N, D:
- If S is in 3, then D must be in 1 or 5, and N must be in 1 or 5.
  - If D is in 1, N cannot also be in 1, so N must be in 5.
    Word form: D O S _ N → need a consonant for position 4 that is allowed and not yet excluded.
    Valid candidate: D O S I N → “DOSIN” – not a real English word.

  - If D is in 5, then N must be in 1 or 3.
    - N O _ _ D → need a consonant for position 3 and 4.
      - N O C H D – invalid.
      - N O P I D – “N O P I D” – not a word.

    - _ O N _ D → need letters for positions 1 and 4.
      - C O N I D – “CONID” – invalid.
      - P O N C D – “PONCD” – invalid.

- If S is in 5, then D must be in 1 or 3, and N must be in 1 or 3 (but can’t repeat).

  - D O _ _ S
    Need consonants for positions 3 and 4.
    - D O C K S – “DOCKS” – valid English word.
      Check constraints:
        – O in 2 ✓
        – Contains S, N, D ✓
        – S not in 1,2,4 ✓ (it’s in 5)
        – D not in 4,5 ✓ (it’s in 1)
        – N is missing – but we know N must be present, so “DOCKS” is invalid (only 4 letters + S).

  - D O N _ S
    Need consonant for position 4.
    - D O N T S – “DONTS” – valid English word.
      Check constraints:
        – O in 2 ✓

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers slightly more common letters. I need to make sure it's a valid 5-letter word, which ""AROSE"" is.

   – D cannot be in positions 4, 5 (from MOLDY feedback).
   – N cannot be in position 4 (from SOUND feedback).

So the five positions look like:
1 2 3 4 5
? O ? ? ?

with the set {S, N, D} among positions 1, 3, 5.

Possible assignments (without repetition):
- S can only be in 3 or 5.
- D can only be in 1, 3.
- N can be in 1, 3, 5.

We need one more letter that is not in {A, R, E, U, M, L, Y}.  
Available letters: C, F, G, H, I, K, P, T, V, W, X, Z.

Let’s try to make valid 5-letter words meeting all these constraints.

Try slotting S, N, D:
- If S is in 3, then D must be in 1 or 5, and N must be in 1 or 5.
  - If D is in 1, N cannot also be in 1, so N must be in 5.
    Word form: D O S _ N → need a consonant for position 4 that is allowed and not yet excluded.
    Valid candidate: D O S I N → “DOSIN” – not a real English word.

  - If D is in 5, then N must be in 1 or 3.
    - N O _ _ D → need a consonant for position 3 and 4.
      - N O C H D – invalid.
      - N O P I D – “N O P I D” – not a word.

    - _ O N _ D → need letters for positions 1 and 4.
      - C O N I D – “CONID” – invalid.
      - P O N C D – “PONCD” – invalid.

- If S is in 5, then D must be in 1 or 3, and N must be in 1 or 3 (but can’t repeat).

  - D O _ _ S
    Need consonants for positions 3 and 4.
    - D O C K S – “DOCKS” – valid English word.
      Check constraints:
        – O in 2 ✓
        – Contains S, N, D ✓
        – S not in 1,2,4 ✓ (it’s in 5)
        – D not in 4,5 ✓ (it’s in 1)
        – N is missing – but we know N must be present, so “DOCKS” is invalid (only 4 letters + S).

  - D O N _ S
    Need consonant for position 4.
    - D O N T S – “DONTS” – valid English word.
      Check constraints:
        – O in 2 ✓
        – Contains S, N, D ✓
        – S in 5 (allowed) ✓
        – D in 1 (allowed) ✓
        – N in 3 (allowed) ✓
        – No forbidden letters ✓

“DONTS” satisfies every rule.
