### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains the most common vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants (R, S). This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word.

Another strong option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers slightly more common letters. I need to make sure it's a valid 5-letter word, which ""AROSE"" is.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O is in the word and in the correct (3rd) position (✓)
- S is in the word and in the correct (4th) position (✓)
- E is in the word and in the correct (5th) position (✓)

So the secret word has the pattern: _ _ O S E

The letter R must appear somewhere in the first two positions (since it can't be in the 2nd position to be correct, and the 3rd is already O).

Possible patterns:
- R _ O S E
- _ R O S E

Looking at common 5-letter words ending in OSE, the ROSE pattern is very common. Let me think of words that fit _ _ O S E with an R in the first position: ROOSE is a word (but has two O's, which might be allowed), and RODEO is not valid. ROUSE is a valid word.

Another possibility is that the first letter is a consonant other than R. Looking at the second position: common letters after R in this context are hard to think of.

Let me try ROUSE:
- R in 1st position (possible since R must be somewhere)
- O in 3rd (correct)
- S in 4th (correct)
- E in 5th (correct)
- U in 2nd (new letter to test)

This seems like a good second guess to test the letter R in position 1 and introduce the new letter U.

Common letters that fit: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, W, etc.

Possible candidates:
- R B O S E → “ROOSE” (but we already saw it has two O’s; the feedback never ruled out double-O, so it’s allowed)
- R C O S E → “RCOSE” – not a valid word
- R D O S E → “RDOSE” – invalid

- R H O S E → “RHOSE” – invalid

- R P O S E → “RPOSE” – invalid
- R T O S E → “RTOSE” – invalid
