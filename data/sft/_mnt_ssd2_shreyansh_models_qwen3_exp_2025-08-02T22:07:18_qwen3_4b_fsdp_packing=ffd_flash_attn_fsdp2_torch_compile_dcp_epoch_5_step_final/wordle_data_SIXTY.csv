### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses some of these high-frequency letters in different positions to help narrow down possibilities quickly. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters and tests vowels in multiple positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all **not** in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the **wrong position** (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter S, but not in position 4.
- Does **not** contain A, R, O, E.

Since we eliminated A, R, O, E, we need to focus on other common letters. High-frequency consonants left include T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc. I’ll pick a word that:
- Uses S in a different position (not 4th).
- Avoids A, R, O, E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is “UNTIL”:
- S is not used, but this allows testing new letters.
- Actually, let me revise: I must use S somewhere else.  
A better choice is “SPLIT”:
- S is in position 1 (new position).
- P, L, I, T are common letters not yet tested.

- Letters definitely used: S, T, I

Remaining high-frequency letters not yet tested include N, C, D, M, H, U, Y, etc.  
We also need to place I somewhere other than position 5 (positions 2 or 3 are open).

A good candidate would use I in position 2 or 3 and introduce new common consonants.  
Let’s try “S C I T _” or “S _ I T _” and check validity.

“SKINT” is invalid (N ruled out isn’t a concern here, but K hasn’t been tested yet).  
“SIGHT” uses G and H, both untested.  
“SMITH” uses M and H.

Let’s pick SMITH:

From the feedback so far:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. splti → S(✓) P(x) L(x) T(✓) I(-)  
   – S is confirmed in position 1.  
   – T is confirmed in position 4.  
   – I is in the word but not in position 5.

3. smith → S(✓) M(x) I(-) T(✓) H(x)  
   – S still in position 1, T still in position 4.  
   – M and H are not in the word.  
   – I is in the word but not in position 3 (since it shows “-” again).

So the pattern is now:  
S _ _ T _  
and the letters we know are in the word: S, T, I  
Letters ruled out: A, R, O, E, P, L, M, H

I must place I in either position 2 or position 5 (since position 3 is ruled out by the latest feedback).  
Position 5 is still open, so let’s try putting I in position 2 and see what fills position 3.

That gives us:  
S I _ T _

Now we need a consonant for position 3 that hasn’t been ruled out and is common.  
Remaining common consonants: N, C, D, G, K, U, Y, etc.

Let’s try “SKINT” – but K hasn’t been tested yet and N is still possible.  
“SKINT” would place I in position 3, but the latest feedback says I is not in position 3.  
So that’s invalid.

Next, try “SIXTY” – but X is less common and Y is a vowel/consonant hybrid.  
“SIXTY” places I in position 2, which is allowed.

Check validity:  
S(✓) I(-) X(?) T(✓) Y(?) – but we need to ensure all letters are valid (not ruled out).  
X and Y haven’t been ruled out yet.

But “SIXTY” is a valid word.  
However, we know T is in position 4, so “SIXTY” would be S I X T Y, which fits the pattern S _ _ T _ with I in position 2.

But wait – the feedback from smith showed I in position 3 gave “-”, so I cannot be in position 3, but can be in position 2 or 5.  
Thus, “SIXTY” with I in position 2 is acceptable.

Another candidate: “SITTY” – but duplicate T is allowed, but T is already fixed in position 4.  
“SITTY” would be S I T T Y, but T is already in position 4, so duplicate T in position 3 is possible, but we’d have to check if Y is valid.  
However, “SITTY” is a valid word, but it uses T twice, which might not be efficient.

A better candidate is “SIXTY” as it introduces new letters.

But let’s verify:  
Letters used so far: S, T, I  
Letters ruled out: A, R, O, E, P, L, M, H  
X and Y are still possible.

Thus, “SIXTY” is valid and fits the pattern.

However, let’s also consider “SQUID” – but Q is less common and U is a vowel.  
“SQUID” would be S Q U I T, but I must be in position 2 or 5, and T is in position 4, so this doesn’t fit.

Another candidate: “SNIKT” – invalid word.

“SKINT” – already ruled out because I would be in position 3.

“SIXTY” seems the best.

But wait – “SIXTY” has I in position 2, which is allowed.  
So the guess is:  
S I X T Y

But let’s check if X and Y are ruled out – they are not.  
Thus, “SIXTY” is valid.

However, another valid word is “SIXTY” or “SQUID” – but “SQUID” doesn’t fit the pattern.

Another option: “SUDTY” – invalid word.

“SIXTY” seems to be the only valid word fitting S I _ T _ with common letters.

Thus, the next guess is “SIXTY”.

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
