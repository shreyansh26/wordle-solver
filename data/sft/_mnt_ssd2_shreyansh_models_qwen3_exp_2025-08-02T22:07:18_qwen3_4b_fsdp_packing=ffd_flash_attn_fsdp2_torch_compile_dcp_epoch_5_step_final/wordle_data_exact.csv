For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, etc. 

A popular and effective first guess is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S: Common consonant
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Common vowel

This combination gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word (x)

- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so T exists somewhere else

From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(-) E(-)
   - A is fixed in position 3.
   - T and E are both in the word but not in their guessed positions (T≠4, E≠5).
   - No S or L.

2. BEATY → B(x) E(-) A(✓) T(-) Y(x)
   - B and Y are not in the word.
   - E is still in the word but not in position 2 (so E must be in position 4).
   - T is still in the word but not in position 4 (so T must be in position 1 or 5).

Current constraints:
- Word pattern: _ _ A E _  (since E must be in position 4 and A in 3)
- T must be in position 1 or 5.
- Letters not allowed: S, L, B, Y.
- We still need two more distinct letters (one before A and one after E).

Let’s try placing T in position 1: T _ A E _
Then the last letter (position 5) must be a new letter not yet used (not S, L, B, Y, etc.).
A good candidate is “T R A E N” but “TRAEN” isn’t a valid word.
Next: T _ A E _ → “T R A E D” → “TRAE D” isn’t valid either.
Try T _ A E _ → “T R A E N” invalid.
Try T _ A E _ → “T R A E K” invalid.
Try T _ A E _ → “T R A E M” invalid.
Try T _ A E _ → “T R A E L” but L is excluded.
Try T _ A E _ → “T R A E S” but S is excluded.
Try T _ A E _ → “T R A E N” invalid.
Try T _ A E _ → “T R A E D” invalid.
Try T _ A E _ → “T R A E M” invalid.
Try T _ A E _ → “T R A E N” invalid.

Let’s try T in position 5: _ _ A E T
Now we need two new letters for positions 1 and 2, not S, L, B, Y.
Common letters left: R, N, C, D, etc.
Try “C R A E T” → “CRAET” invalid.
Try “D R A E T” → “DRAET” invalid.
Try “F R A E T” → “FRAET” invalid.
Try “N R A E T” → “NRAET” invalid.
Try “C A R E T” but A is in position 3.
Wait, pattern is _ _ A E T.

Let’s try “C A R E T” but A is fixed at 3, so positions:
1: C
2: A? No, A is at 3.
Wait, pattern is [1][2]A[E][5], with T at 5.
So: _ _ A E T.

Try “C A R E T” no, A is at 3, so:
1: C
2: R
3: A
4: E
5: T → “C R A E T” invalid.

Try “P R A E T” invalid.
Try “D R A E T” invalid.
Try “F R A E T” invalid.
Try “N A R E T” but A is at 3, so:
1: N
2: A? No, A is at 3.
Wait, positions:
1: ?
2: ?
3: A
4: E
5: T

So word is _ _ A E T.
Try “C A R E T” no, A is at 3.
Try “P A R E T” no.
Try “D A R E T” no.
Try “F A R E T” no.
Try “C O A E T” invalid.
Try “C H A E T” invalid.
Try “C R A E T” invalid.
Try “C L A E T” but L is excluded.
Try “C K A E T” invalid.
Try “C R A E T” invalid.

Let’s try a different approach. Maybe E is not in position 4? But from BEATY feedback, E is in the word but not in position 2, and from SLATE it’s not in position 5. So E must be in position 4. So pattern is _ _ A E _.

T must be in position 1 or 5.

Let’s try T in position 5: _ _ A E T
Need valid 5-letter words fitting this.

Possible words:
- “C A R E T” no, A is at 3.
- “P A R E T” no.
- “D A R E T” no.
- “F A R E T” no.
- “C O A E T” invalid.
- “C H A E T” invalid.
- “C R A E T” invalid.
- “C L A E T” L excluded.
- “C K A E T” invalid.
- “P R A E T” invalid.
- “N A R E T” invalid.
- “D R A E T” invalid.
- “F R A E T” invalid.
- “C R A E T” invalid.

Wait, is there any valid word _ _ A E T?
Yes: “C A R E T” is invalid, but “C R A E T” is invalid.
Actually, “C R A E T” is not a word.
Let me think differently: “C A R E T” is valid but A is at 2, not 3.
We need A at 3, E at 4, T at 5: _ _ A E T.

Valid word: “C A R E T” no, A is at 2.
Actually, “C A R E T” is invalid because A is at 2, and we need A at 3.
Wait, let me list possible words ending in “_ A E T”.

Valid words:
- “C A R E T” no, A at 2.
- “P A R E T” no.
- “D A R E T” no.
- “F A R E T” no.
- “C O A E T” invalid.
- “C H A E T” invalid.
- “C R A E T” invalid.
- “C L A E T” L excluded.
- “C K A E T” invalid.
- “P R A E T” invalid.
- “N A R E T” invalid.
- “D R A E T” invalid.
- “F R A E T” invalid.
- “C R A E T” invalid.

Hmm, seems like there are no common English words fitting _ _ A E T. Maybe T is in position 1.

Pattern: T _ A E _
Need valid 5-letter words: T ? A E ?
Possible words:
- T R A E N invalid.
- T R A E D invalid.
- T R A E K invalid.
- T R A E M invalid.
- T R A E S invalid (S excluded).

- T R A E N invalid.
- T R A E P invalid.
- T R A E V invalid.
- T R A E W invalid.
- T R A E X invalid.
- T R A E Z invalid.

Wait, let me think of actual words:
- T R A E N → not valid.
- T R A E D → not valid.
- T R A E S → not valid (S excluded).
- T R A E L → not valid (L excluded).
- T R A E M → not valid.

- T R A E J → not valid.
- T R A E V → not valid.
- T R A E W → not valid.
- T R A E X → not valid.
- T R A E Z → not valid.

This is tricky. Maybe the pattern is not T _ A E _ but _ _ A E _ with T in 5, but we saw no valid words. Maybe I missed something.

Let me try T in position 1 with different letters:
T _ A E _
Possible valid words:
- T R A E N → not valid.
- T R A E D → not valid.
- T R A E K → not valid.
- T R A E M → not valid.
- T R A E S → not valid (S excluded).
- T R A E L → not valid (L excluded).
- T R A E P → not valid.
- T R A E C → not valid.
- T R A E G → not valid.
- T R A E B → not valid (B excluded).
- T R A E F → not valid.
- T R A E H → not valid.
- T R A E J → not valid.
- T R A E V → not valid.
- T R A E W → not valid.
- T R A E X → not valid.
- T R A E Z → not valid.

I’m having trouble finding valid words. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me list possible letters for positions 1,2,5 with constraints:
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: E
- T must be in 1 or 5
- No S, L, B, Y
- Need two new letters.

Try T in position 1: T ? A E ?
Possible valid words:
- T R A E N → not valid.
- T R A E D → not valid.
- T R A E K → not valid.
- T R A E M → not valid.
- T R A E S → not valid (S excluded).
- T R A E L → not valid (L excluded).
- T R A E P → not valid.
- T R A E C → not valid.
- T R A E G → not valid.
- T R A E B → not valid (B excluded).

- T R A E J → not valid.
- T R A E V → not valid.
- T R A E W → not valid.
- T R A E X → not valid.
- T R A E Z → not valid.

Let me try T in position 5: ? ? A E T
Possible valid words:
- C A R E T → A is at 2, not 3.

- F R A E T → invalid.

Actually, there are very few English words with this exact pattern. One valid word is “C A R E T” but A is at 2, not 3. Another is “P A R E T” but A is at 2. It seems like there are no common words fitting _ _ A E T. 

Maybe I made an error in assuming E must be at 4. Let me re-examine the constraints:

From SLATE: E is in word but not at 5.
From BEATY: E is in word but not at 2.
So E must be at 1, 3, or 4.
But A is fixed at 3, so E must be at 1 or 4.
If E is at 1, pattern: E _ A _ _
From BEATY, T is in word but not at 4.
From SLATE, T is in word but not at 4.
So T could be at 1, 2, or 5.
But E is at 1, so T could be at 2 or 5.
Let’s explore E at 1:
E _ A _ _
T must be at 2 or 5.
Try T at 2: E T A _ _
Need a letter at 4 and 5, not S, L, B, Y.
Possible valid words:
- E T A N D → “ETAND” invalid.
- E T A N E → “ETANE” invalid.
- E T A R E → “ETARE” invalid.
- E T A M E → “ETAME” invalid.

- E T A Z E → invalid.

Try T at 5: E _ A _ T
Need letter at 2 and 4, not S, L, B, Y.
Possible valid words:

- E N A C T → “ENACT” valid.

“ENACT”:
- E at 1 (possible)
- N new
- A at 3 (correct)
- C new
- T at 5 (possible)

This fits all constraints:
- Contains A at 3 (✓)
- Contains T at 5 (was at 4 before, now at 5)
- Contains E at 1 (was at 5 and 2 before)
- No S, L, B, Y
- Valid 5-letter word.

Let’s use ENACT.
</think>

From the feedback:
- A is locked in position 3.
- T and E are both in the word but not in their previous positions.
- Letters S, L, B, Y are eliminated.

Re-evaluating positions:
- E cannot be at 2 or 5, and A is at 3, so E must be at 1 or 4.
- T cannot be at 4, so it must be at 1, 2, or 5.
- Trying E at 1 and T at 5 gives the pattern: E _ A _ T.
- The valid word fitting this is ENACT.

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(-) E(-)
   - A is fixed in position 3.
   - T and E are both in the word but not in their guessed positions (T≠4, E≠5).
   - No S or L.

2. BEATY → B(x) E(-) A(✓) T(-) Y(x)
   - B and Y are not in the word.
   - E is still in the word but not in position 2 (so E must be in position 4).
   - T is still in the word but not in position 4 (so T must be in position 1 or 5).

Current constraints:
- Word pattern: _ _ A E _  (since E must be in position 4 and A in 3)
- T must be in position 1 or 5.
- Letters not allowed: S, L, B, Y.
- We still need two more distinct letters (one before A and one after E).

Let’s try placing T in position 1: T _ A E _
Then the last letter (position 5) must be a new letter not yet used (not S, L, B, Y, etc.).
A good candidate is “T R A E N” but “TRAEN” isn’t a valid word.
Next: T _ A E _ → “T R A E D” → “TRAE D” isn’t valid either.
Try T _ A E _ → “T R A E N” invalid.
Try T _ A E _ → “T R A E K” invalid.
Try T _ A E _ → “T R A E M” invalid.

Try T _ A E _ → “T R A E D” invalid.
Try T _ A E _ → “T R A E M” invalid.
Try T _ A E _ → “T R A E N” invalid.

Let’s try T in position 5: _ _ A E T
Now we need two new letters for positions 1 and 2, not S, L, B, Y.
Common letters left: R, N, C, D, etc.
Try “C R A E T” → “CRAET” invalid.
Try “D R A E T” → “DRAET” invalid.
Try “F R A E T” → “FRAET” invalid.
Try “N R A E T” → “NRAET” invalid.
Try “C A R E T” but A is in position 3.
Wait, pattern is _ _ A E T.

Let’s try “C A R E T” but A is fixed at 3, so positions:
1: C
2: A? No, A is at 3.
Wait, pattern is [1][2]A[E][5], with T at 5.
So: _ _ A E T.

Try “C A R E T” no, A is at 3, so:
1: C
2: R
3: A

5: T → “C R A E T” invalid.

Try “P R A E T” invalid.
Try “D R A E T” invalid.

Wait, positions:

Try “C L A E T” but L is excluded.
Try “C K A E T” invalid.
Try “C R A E T” invalid.

Let’s try a different approach. Maybe E is not in position 4? But from BEATY feedback, E is in the word but not in position 2, and from SLATE it’s not in position 5. So E must be in position 4. So pattern is _ _ A E _.

T must be in position 1 or 5.

Let’s try T in position 5: _ _ A E T
Need valid 5-letter words fitting this.

Possible words:

Wait, is there any valid word _ _ A E T?
Yes: “C A R E T” is invalid, but “C R A E T” is invalid.
Actually, “C R A E T” is not a word.
Let me think differently: “C A R E T” is valid but A is at 2, not 3.
We need A at 3, E at 4, T at 5: _ _ A E T.

Valid word: “C A R E T” no, A is at 2.
Actually, “C A R E T” is invalid because A is at 2, and we need A at 3.
Wait, let me list possible words ending in “_ A E T”.

Valid words:

This is tricky. Maybe the pattern is not T _ A E _ but _ _ A E _ with T in 5, but we saw no valid words. Maybe I missed something.

Let me try T in position 1 with different letters:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, etc. 

A popular and effective first guess is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S: Common consonant
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Common vowel

This combination gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word (x)
- L is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the word is _ _ A _ _
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so T exists somewhere else
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so E exists somewhere else

We now know:
- Must contain A in position 3.
- Must contain T and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- Cannot contain S or L.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 3
- T somewhere not position 4
- E somewhere not position 5
- No S or L

Possible positions:
- T could be in 1, 2, or 5
- E could be in 1, 2, or 4

Let’s try a word that fits these constraints and tests new common letters. A good candidate is ""BEATY"":
- B: new consonant
- E: in position 2 (was in 5, now tested in 2)
- A: correct position 3
- T: in position 4 (was in 5, now tested in 4)
- Y: new letter

This tests B, Y, and repositions E and T to see where they fit.

From the two guesses we have:

   - No S or L.

2. BEATY → B(x) E(-) A(✓) T(-) Y(x)
   - B and Y are not in the word.
   - E is still in the word but not in position 2 (so E must be in position 4).
   - T is still in the word but not in position 4 (so T must be in position 1 or 5).

Current constraints:
- Word pattern: _ _ A E _  (since E must be in position 4 and A in 3)
- T must be in position 1 or 5.
- Letters not allowed: S, L, B, Y.
- We still need two more distinct letters (one before A and one after E).

Let’s try placing T in position 1: T _ A E _
Then the last letter (position 5) must be a new letter not yet used (not S, L, B, Y, etc.).
A good candidate is “T R A E N” but “TRAEN” isn’t a valid word.

Let’s try a different approach. Maybe E is not in position 4? But from BEATY feedback, E is in the word but not in position 2, and from SLATE it’s not in position 5. So E must be in position 4. So pattern is _ _ A E _.

T must be in position 1 or 5.

Wait, let me think of actual words:
- T R A E N → not valid.
- T R A E D → not valid.
- T R A E S → not valid (S excluded).
- T R A E L → not valid (L excluded).
- T R A E M → not valid.

- T R A E J → not valid.
- T R A E V → not valid.
- T R A E W → not valid.
- T R A E X → not valid.
- T R A E Z → not valid.

This is tricky. Maybe the pattern is not T _ A E _ but _ _ A E _ with T in 5, but we saw no valid words. Maybe I missed something.

Let me try T in position 1 with different letters:
T _ A E _
Possible valid words:
- T R A E N → not valid.
- T R A E D → not valid.
- T R A E K → not valid.
- T R A E M → not valid.
- T R A E S → not valid (S excluded).
- T R A E L → not valid (L excluded).
- T R A E P → not valid.
- T R A E C → not valid.
- T R A E G → not valid.
- T R A E B → not valid (B excluded).

- T R A E J → not valid.
- T R A E V → not valid.
- T R A E W → not valid.
- T R A E X → not valid.
- T R A E Z → not valid.

I’m having trouble finding valid words. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me list possible letters for positions 1,2,5 with constraints:
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: E
- T must be in 1 or 5
- No S, L, B, Y
- Need two new letters.

Try T in position 1: T ? A E ?
Possible valid words:
- T R A E N → not valid.
- T R A E D → not valid.
- T R A E K → not valid.
- T R A E M → not valid.
- T R A E S → not valid (S excluded).
- T R A E L → not valid (L excluded).
- T R A E P → not valid.
- T R A E C → not valid.
- T R A E G → not valid.
- T R A E B → not valid (B excluded).
- T R A E F → not valid.
- T R A E H → not valid.
- T R A E J → not valid.
- T R A E V → not valid.
- T R A E W → not valid.
- T R A E X → not valid.
- T R A E Z → not valid.

Let me try T in position 5: ? ? A E T
Possible valid words:
- C A R E T → A is at 2, not 3.
- P A R E T → A is at 2.
- D A R E T → A is at 2.
- F A R E T → A is at 2.
- C O A E T → invalid.
- C H A E T → invalid.
- C R A E T → invalid.
- N A R E T → invalid.
- D R A E T → invalid.
- F R A E T → invalid.
- C R A E T → invalid.

Wait, let me think of actual words with A at 3, E at 4, T at 5: _ _ A E T
Valid words:
- C A R E T → A at 2.
- P A R E T → A at 2.
- D A R E T → A at 2.
- F A R E T → A at 2.
- C O A E T → invalid.
- C H A E T → invalid.
- C R A E T → invalid.
- N A R E T → invalid.
- D R A E T → invalid.
- F R A E T → invalid.

Actually, there are very few English words with this exact pattern. One valid word is “C A R E T” but A is at 2, not 3. Another is “P A R E T” but A is at 2. It seems like there are no common words fitting _ _ A E T. 

Maybe I made an error in assuming E must be at 4. Let me re-examine the constraints:

From SLATE: E is in word but not at 5.
From BEATY: E is in word but not at 2.
So E must be at 1, 3, or 4.
But A is fixed at 3, so E must be at 1 or 4.
If E is at 1, pattern: E _ A _ _
From BEATY, T is in word but not at 4.
From SLATE, T is in word but not at 4.
So T could be at 1, 2, or 5.
But E is at 1, so T could be at 2 or 5.
Let’s explore E at 1:
E _ A _ _
T must be at 2 or 5.
Try T at 2: E T A _ _
Need a letter at 4 and 5, not S, L, B, Y.
Possible valid words:
- E T A N D → “ETAND” invalid.
- E T A N E → “ETANE” invalid.
- E T A R E → “ETARE” invalid.
- E T A M E → “ETAME” invalid.
- E T A R T → “ETART” invalid.
- E T A N T → “ETANT” invalid.
- E T A R E → invalid.
- E T A P E → “ETAPE” invalid.
- E T A V E → invalid.
- E T A W E → invalid.
- E T A X E → invalid.
- E T A Z E → invalid.

Try T at 5: E _ A _ T
Need letter at 2 and 4, not S, L, B, Y.
Possible valid words:
- E R A N T → “ERANT” invalid.
- E R A C T → “ERACT” invalid.
- E R A D T → “ERADT” invalid.
- E R A M T → “ERAMT” invalid.
- E R A P T → “ERAPT” invalid.
- E R A V T → invalid.
- E R A W T → invalid.
- E R A X T → invalid.
- E R A Z T → invalid.
- E N A R T → invalid.
- E N A C T → “ENACT” valid.

“ENACT”:
- E at 1 (possible)
- N new
- A at 3 (correct)
- C new
- T at 5 (possible)

This fits all constraints:
- Contains A at 3 (✓)
- Contains T at 5 (was at 4 before, now at 5)
- Contains E at 1 (was at 5 and 2 before)
- No S, L, B, Y
- Valid 5-letter word.

Let’s use ENACT.From the feedback:
- A is locked in position 3.
- T and E are both in the word but not in their previous positions.
- Letters S, L, B, Y are eliminated.

Re-evaluating positions:
- E cannot be at 2 or 5, and A is at 3, so E must be at 1 or 4.
- T cannot be at 4, so it must be at 1, 2, or 5.
- Trying E at 1 and T at 5 gives the pattern: E _ A _ T.
- The valid word fitting this is ENACT.
