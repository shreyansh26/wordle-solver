1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in 5-letter words. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S: Very common starting letter
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Most common vowel

This combination gives us good coverage of frequent letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

Let’s summarize what we now know from all feedback.

Letters we have tried and their status:
- S, L, T, R, N, P, H are NOT in the word (x feedback).
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still being pinned down:
  – E is in the word and is already confirmed in position 2 (✓).
  – A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (- feedback).
  – C is in the word but NOT in position 1 or 4 (- feedback).

So far the word skeleton looks like:
_ E _ _ _

and we know the remaining letters must include both A and C somewhere, with:
- A ≠ 3 (but 3 is already E, so A can be in 1, 4, or 5)
- C ≠ 1 or 4

Letters still available (not yet ruled out):
A, C, E (already placed), plus any other consonants not yet tried: B, D, F, G, K, M, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a word that:
1. Has E in position 2.
2. Contains both A and C somewhere else (positions not yet ruled out).
3. Uses only letters that have not been marked x so far.
4. Does not reuse any of S, L, T, R, N, P, H.

Let’s list possible positions for A and C:
- A could be 1, 4, or 5.
- C could be 2, 3, or 5 (but 2 is E, so 3 or 5).

Let’s try to construct a valid word:
- If C is in 3, then A could be 1, 4, or 5.
  – C E A _ _  (but A is allowed in 3? No, A cannot be in 3 because it was marked - in guess 1 where A was in 3.)
  – C E _ A _  – possible, e.g., ""CEBAS"" but S is x.
  – C E _ _ A – possible, e.g., ""CEBDA"" but B and D are fine, and A is allowed in 5.
  – C E A _ _ – but A would be in 2, which is E, so invalid.

- If C is in 5, then A could be 1 or 4.
  – A E _ _ C – possible, e.g., ""AEBIC"" but I is new and allowed.
  – _ E A _ C – possible, e.g., ""B E A C D"" but need valid word.

Let’s pick a word that fits these constraints and uses new consonants to maximize information. A good candidate is ""B E A C D"" but ""BEACD"" is not a valid word. 

Another candidate: ""C E B A D"" – but C is in 1, which was ruled out (- in guess 2).

Next candidate: ""D E C A Y"" – but Y is allowed, and:
- D, E, C, A, Y – all letters not yet ruled out.
- E is in position 2 (✓).
- C is in 3 (allowed, since C was only ruled out of 1 and 4).
- A is in 4 (allowed, since A was only ruled out of 3).
- New letters D and Y are introduced.

""DECAY"" is a valid English word and fits all constraints.

So my next guess is ""DECAY"".
