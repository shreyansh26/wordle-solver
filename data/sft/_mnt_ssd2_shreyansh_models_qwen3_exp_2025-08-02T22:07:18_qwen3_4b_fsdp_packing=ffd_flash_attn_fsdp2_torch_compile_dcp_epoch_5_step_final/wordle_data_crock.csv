For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several letters at once. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. 

The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a good first guess because it contains:
- Common vowels: A, O, E
- Common consonants: R, S

This gives us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities based on the feedback.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A is not in the word (x).
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → R is the second letter.
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → O is the third letter.
- S is not in the word (x).
- E is not in the word (x).

So the secret word has the pattern: _ R O _ _

We now want a guess that:
1. Keeps R in position 2 and O in position 3.
2. Introduces new letters that haven’t been tried yet.
3. Uses common letters to maximize information.

Good letters to try next: T, N, L, I, U, D, H, etc.

A strong candidate is “TRIO_” but we need a 5-letter word. “TRION” isn’t valid. Instead, “TROOP” uses O twice but P hasn’t been tried. However, “TROOP” repeats O in position 4, which might not be optimal.

Another candidate is “CROON” but N is repeated.

A better choice is “DROOL” but L is repeated.

The word “GROIN” uses G, I, N – all new letters.

But the simplest and most informative word that fits _ R O _ _ and introduces new common consonants is “TRAIN”. However, A and I are both new vowels, but A was already ruled out (x in arose), so “TRAIN” is invalid because A is not in the word.

Next best: “CROAK” – but K hasn’t been tried, A is already out.

“FROST” – S is out.

“BROTH” – H is new.

“PROWL” – P, W, L are new.

“TROOP” – repeats O, P is new.

“DROOL” – repeats O, L is new.

“GROIN” – G, I, N are new.

The most balanced guess seems “GROIN” as it introduces three new letters (G, I, N) while keeping R and O fixed.

But let me double-check: GROIN is a valid 5-letter word meaning the groin area.

So the guess is: G R O I N

“DROOL” – repeats O, L is new.

“GROIN” – G, I, N are new.

The most balanced guess seems “GROIN” as it introduces three new letters (G, I, N) while keeping R and O fixed.

But let me double-check: GROIN is a valid 5-letter word meaning the groin area.

So the guess is: G R O I N

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: groin -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) O(✓) I(x) N(x)

From the two previous guesses:

1. arose → A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ pattern _ R O _ _ ; letters **not** in the word: A, S, E

2. groin → G(x) R(✓) O(✓) I(x) N(x)  
   ⇒ pattern _ R O _ _ ; additional letters **not** in the word: G, I, N

Letters we now know are in the word and in their fixed positions:  
- 2nd letter = R  
- 3rd letter = O  

Letters we know are **not** in the word:  
A, E, S, G, I, N

Remaining unused common consonants: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: U (since A, E, I, O are ruled out)

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ R O _ _ that uses only the remaining letters.

Good candidates that fit _ R O _ _ and use only allowed letters:  
- B R O W N → uses B, W, N (but N is already out)  
- C R O W D → uses C, W, D  
- D R O P S → S is out  
- F R O N T → N is out  
- P R O U D → uses P, U, D  
- T R O U P → uses T, U, P  
- C R O CK → C, K are allowed  
- P R O CK → P, C, K are allowed  

Among these, **TROOP** is invalid (O repeated and P already allowed, but O is allowed to repeat? Wait, the feedback never said O doesn’t appear elsewhere, only that it’s correct in position 3. So O could appear again. However, N is out, so TROOP is invalid because O is in position 4 and N is in position 5, but N is out. Actually TROOP is T R O O P, and N is not in it, so TROOP is valid except N is not used. But we need to check if P is allowed – yes, P hasn’t been ruled out.

But **TROOP** uses O twice, which might not be the best for testing new letters. A better choice is **CROWD** (C, W, D are new), or **PROUD** (P, U, D are new).

Another good candidate is **TROUD** – but TROUD is not a valid English word. **TROOP** is valid, but has repeated O. **CROWD** is valid and introduces C, W, D.

So the best next guess is **CROWD**.

From the three guesses so far:

2. groin → G(x) R(✓) O(✓) I(x) N(x)

Remaining vowels: U (all others are ruled out)

We need a valid 5-letter word starting with C R O and ending with two letters from the remaining set. Possible endings:

- C R O U _ : U is allowed, need a 5th letter not ruled out.  
  - C R O U K → “CROUK” – not valid

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several letters at once. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. 

The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a good first guess because it contains:
- Common vowels: A, O, E
- Common consonants: R, S

This gives us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities based on the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A is not in the word (x).
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → R is the second letter.
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → O is the third letter.
- S is not in the word (x).
- E is not in the word (x).

So the secret word has the pattern: _ R O _ _

We now want a guess that:
1. Keeps R in position 2 and O in position 3.
2. Introduces new letters that haven’t been tried yet.
3. Uses common letters to maximize information.

Good letters to try next: T, N, L, I, U, D, H, etc.

A strong candidate is “TRIO_” but we need a 5-letter word. “TRION” isn’t valid. Instead, “TROOP” uses O twice but P hasn’t been tried. However, “TROOP” repeats O in position 4, which might not be optimal.

Another candidate is “CROON” but N is repeated.

A better choice is “DROOL” but L is repeated.

The word “GROIN” uses G, I, N – all new letters.

But the simplest and most informative word that fits _ R O _ _ and introduces new common consonants is “TRAIN”. However, A and I are both new vowels, but A was already ruled out (x in arose), so “TRAIN” is invalid because A is not in the word.

Next best: “CROAK” – but K hasn’t been tried, A is already out.

“FROST” – S is out.

“BROTH” – H is new.

“PROWL” – P, W, L are new.

“TROOP” – repeats O, P is new.

“DROOL” – repeats O, L is new.

“GROIN” – G, I, N are new.

The most balanced guess seems “GROIN” as it introduces three new letters (G, I, N) while keeping R and O fixed.

But let me double-check: GROIN is a valid 5-letter word meaning the groin area.

So the guess is: G R O I N

- T R O U P → uses T, U, P  
- C R O CK → C, K are allowed  
- P R O CK → P, C, K are allowed  

Among these, **TROOP** is invalid (O repeated and P already allowed, but O is allowed to repeat? Wait, the feedback never said O doesn’t appear elsewhere, only that it’s correct in position 3.

Actually TROOP is T R O O P, and N is not in it, so TROOP is valid except N is not used. But we need to check if P is allowed – yes, P hasn’t been ruled out.

But **TROOP** uses O twice, which might not be the best for testing new letters. A better choice is **CROWD** (C, W, D are new), or **PROUD** (P, U, D are new).

Another good candidate is **TROUD** – but TROUD is not a valid English word. **TROOP** is valid, but has repeated O. **CROWD** is valid and introduces C, W, D.

We now know the word starts with C R O and must end with two letters that have not yet been ruled out.

Letters already excluded:  
A, E, S, G, I, N, W, D, F, T

Remaining consonants: B, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowel: U

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form C R O _ _ using only the remaining letters.

Possible endings:
- C R O U B → “CROUB” – not valid  
- C R O U K → “CROUK” – not valid  
- C R O U L → “CROUL” – not valid  
- C R O U M → “CROUM” – not valid  
- C R O U P → “CROUP” – not valid  
- C R O U V → “CROUV” – not valid  
- C R O U Y → “CROUY” – not valid  

Looking at consonant pairs:
- C R O B L → “CROBL” – not valid  
- C R O K E → E is out  
- C R O L L → “CROLL” – but L is allowed, yet the word would be C R O L L, which is valid.

Wait, let’s list all valid English words starting with CRO:

Common ones: CROAK, CROON, CROP, CROPS, CRORE, CROAK, CROON, CROWE, CROWD, CROWE, CROCK, CROFT, CROWN, CROWE, etc.

From these, filter by our constraints:
- Must have C R O _ _ (exactly 5 letters).  
- Must not contain any excluded letters (A, E, S, G, I, N, W, D, F, T).

Valid candidates:
- CROON – O and N are allowed? N is excluded.  
- CROAK – A and K: A is excluded.  
- CRORE – E and R: E excluded.  
- CROON – N excluded.  
- CROCK – C is already used, but C is allowed to repeat? The secret word could have repeated letters, but we have no evidence C repeats yet. Also, K is allowed.  
- CROON – N excluded.  
- CROCK – valid, letters C, R, O, C, K. C is already in position 1, so this would be C R O C K. All letters are allowed (C is allowed to appear again, as no feedback said letters can’t repeat). K hasn’t been tested.  

Another candidate: CROON – but N is excluded.  
CROCK seems the only plausible 5-letter word left that starts with CRO and uses allowed letters.

Let’s verify CROCK:
- C R O C K  
Letters: C, R, O, C, K  
None of these are on the banned list (even though C repeats, the feedback never indicated no repeats, so it’s possible).

Thus, the next logical guess is **CROCK**.
