1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. Among these, words like ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", or ""STARE"" are good options because they contain multiple vowels and common consonants. 

After considering these options, ""RAISE"" seems like a strong first guess because it includes:
- R (very common consonant)
- A and I (common vowels)
- S and E (very common letters)

This combination should help me quickly identify which of these common letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (it can’t be in position 1).
- A, I, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains R but not in position 1.
- Does NOT contain A, I, S, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has R somewhere other than the first position.
- Avoids A, I, S, E entirely.

Common letters still available include T, N, O, L, U, D, M, P, C, Y, etc.  
I’ll pick a word that uses R in a different position and avoids the eliminated letters.  
A good candidate is “TRUCK”:
- T, R, U, C, K are all still possible.
- R is in position 2, satisfying the “wrong position” clue.

From the feedback so far:

- Pattern: _ R O N G
- Letters not in the word (from all guesses): A, I, S, E, T, U, C, K, P

All letters in PRONG (P, R, O, N, G) are now confirmed to be in the word and in the correct positions, except P which is not in the word at all. Therefore the secret word must be:

R O N G _  → but PRONG shows P(x) so the first letter is NOT P, but we already know the pattern is _ R O N G. Wait, no: the feedback for PRONG was P(x) R(✓) O(✓) N(✓) G(✓). This means:

- Position 1: P is NOT in the word.
- Position 2: R is correct (✓)
- Position 3: O is correct (✓)
- Position 4: N is correct (✓)
- Position 5: G is correct (✓)

So the pattern is: [unknown] R O N G, and the first letter is NOT P.

But the secret word is 5 letters and the pattern shown by PRONG is _ R O N G, implying the word is of the form ? R O N G. However, this would make the word 5 letters only if the first letter is present. But the feedback shows that R, O, N, G are all in their correct positions (2-5), and P is not in position 1.

This suggests the word is _ R O N G, i.e., the first letter is unknown, and the last four letters are R, O, N, G in positions 2-5 respectively. But this would make the word 5 letters: [letter1] R O N G.

But looking at the feedback again: PRONG → P(x) R(✓) O(✓) N(✓) G(✓). This means:

- The word has R in position 2
- The word has O in position 3
- The word has N in position 4
- The word has G in position 5
- The word does NOT have P in position 1

So the pattern is: [letter1] R O N G, where letter1 is not P.

But we need to find letter1. From previous guesses, eliminated letters are: A, I, S, E, T, U, C, K, P. So letter1 can be any letter not in that list, and not G, R, O, N (since those are already placed in positions 2-5).

Common remaining letters: B, D, F, H, L, M, Y, etc.

Looking for 5-letter words ending with RONG (but that would be 6 letters). Wait, no: the pattern is [letter1] R O N G, i.e., the word is letter1 followed by R, O, N, G. But that would be 5 letters: [letter1] R O N G.

But the only 5-letter words that fit this pattern are:

B R O N G → ""BRONG"" (valid word, though rare)
D R O N G → ""DRONG"" (valid, but also rare)
F R O N G → ""FRONG"" (valid)
H R O N G → ""HRONG"" (not a standard word)
L R O N G → ""LRONG"" (invalid)
M R O N G → ""MRONG"" (invalid)
Y R O N G → ""YRONG"" (invalid)

Among these, ""BRONG"", ""DRONG"", and ""FRONG"" are valid English words (though ""BRONG"" and ""DRONG"" are more slang/obscure). ""FRONG"" is also valid.

But looking at standard 5-letter words, the most common one fitting _ R O N G is ""BRONG"" (as in ""brong"" slang for ""bruh""), but this might be too obscure.

However, the feedback shows that all of R, O, N, G are in their correct positions, and P is not in position 1. Therefore the word must be [letter1] R O N G, with letter1 not P.

Given the constraints and common remaining letters, the most likely word is ""BRONG"".

But let me double-check: are there any other 5-letter words ending with RONG? No, the standard endings are like .rong in some dialects, but the only valid ones are the three mentioned.

Given that, I'll proceed with ""BRONG"" as the next logical guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. Among these, words like ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", or ""STARE"" are good options because they contain multiple vowels and common consonants. 

After considering these options, ""RAISE"" seems like a strong first guess because it includes:
- R (very common consonant)
- A and I (common vowels)
- S and E (very common letters)

This combination should help me quickly identify which of these common letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (it can’t be in position 1).
- A, I, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains R but not in position 1.
- Does NOT contain A, I, S, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has R somewhere other than the first position.
- Avoids A, I, S, E entirely.

Common letters still available include T, N, O, L, U, D, M, P, C, Y, etc.  
I’ll pick a word that uses R in a different position and avoids the eliminated letters.  
A good candidate is “TRUCK”:
- T, R, U, C, K are all still possible.
- R is in position 2, satisfying the “wrong position” clue.

Let’s try it.

From the two guesses we have:

1. RAISE → R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)

   - A, I, S, E are not in the word.

2. TRUCK → T(x) R(✓) U(x) C(x) K(x)
   - R is in the correct position (position 2).
   - T, U, C, K are not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word is of the form _ R _ _ _
- Letters not in the word: A, I, S, E, T, U, C, K
- Still available letters (among common ones): B, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, O, P, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with R fixed in position 2 and avoiding all the eliminated letters.

Possible candidates:

- G R _ _ _
- H R _ _ _
- L R _ _ _
- M R _ _ _

- P R _ _ _
- Y R _ _ _

""GRIND"" uses G, R, I, N, D – but I is eliminated. ""DRONE"" uses D, R, O, N, E – but E is eliminated. ""PRONG"" uses P, R, O, N, G – all still possible.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. Among these, words like ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", or ""STARE"" are good options because they contain multiple vowels and common consonants. 

After considering these options, ""RAISE"" seems like a strong first guess because it includes:
- R (very common consonant)
- A and I (common vowels)
- S and E (very common letters)

This combination should help me quickly identify which of these common letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (it can’t be in position 1).
- A, I, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains R but not in position 1.
- Does NOT contain A, I, S, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has R somewhere other than the first position.
- Avoids A, I, S, E entirely.

Common letters still available include T, N, O, L, U, D, M, P, C, Y, etc.  
I’ll pick a word that uses R in a different position and avoids the eliminated letters.  
A good candidate is “TRUCK”:
- T, R, U, C, K are all still possible.
- R is in position 2, satisfying the “wrong position” clue.

Let’s try it.

Guess 2: TRUCK -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) U(x) C(x) K(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. RAISE → R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
   - R is in the word but not in position 1.
   - A, I, S, E are not in the word.

2. TRUCK → T(x) R(✓) U(x) C(x) K(x)
   - R is in the correct position (position 2).
   - T, U, C, K are not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word is of the form _ R _ _ _
- Letters not in the word: A, I, S, E, T, U, C, K
- Still available letters (among common ones): B, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, O, P, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with R fixed in position 2 and avoiding all the eliminated letters.

Possible candidates:
- B R _ _ _
- D R _ _ _
- F R _ _ _
- G R _ _ _
- H R _ _ _
- L R _ _ _
- M R _ _ _
- N R _ _ _
- O R _ _ _
- P R _ _ _
- Y R _ _ _

Let’s pick one that uses common remaining letters. ""BRAND"" is out (A, N, D are okay, but A is eliminated). ""FROND"" uses F, R, O, N, D – all still possible. ""GRIND"" uses G, R, I, N, D – but I is eliminated. ""DRONE"" uses D, R, O, N, E – but E is eliminated. ""PRONG"" uses P, R, O, N, G – all still possible. 

I’ll go with ""PRONG"" as it uses several common remaining letters and keeps R in the correct position.

Guess 3: PRONG -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) O(✓) N(✓) G(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

- Pattern: _ R O N G
- Letters not in the word (from all guesses): A, I, S, E, T, U, C, K, P

All letters in PRONG (P, R, O, N, G) are now confirmed to be in the word and in the correct positions, except P which is not in the word at all. Therefore the secret word must be:

R O N G _  → but PRONG shows P(x) so the first letter is NOT P, but we already know the pattern is _ R O N G. Wait, no: the feedback for PRONG was P(x) R(✓) O(✓) N(✓) G(✓). This means:

- Position 1: P is NOT in the word.
- Position 2: R is correct (✓)
- Position 3: O is correct (✓)
- Position 4: N is correct (✓)
- Position 5: G is correct (✓)

So the pattern is: [unknown] R O N G, and the first letter is NOT P.

But the secret word is 5 letters and the pattern shown by PRONG is _ R O N G, implying the word is of the form ? R O N G. However, this would make the word 5 letters only if the first letter is present. But the feedback shows that R, O, N, G are all in their correct positions (2-5), and P is not in position 1.

This suggests the word is _ R O N G, i.e., the first letter is unknown, and the last four letters are R, O, N, G in positions 2-5 respectively. But this would make the word 5 letters: [letter1] R O N G.

But looking at the feedback again: PRONG → P(x) R(✓) O(✓) N(✓) G(✓). This means:

- The word has R in position 2
- The word has O in position 3
- The word has N in position 4
- The word has G in position 5
- The word does NOT have P in position 1

So the pattern is: [letter1] R O N G, where letter1 is not P.

But we need to find letter1. From previous guesses, eliminated letters are: A, I, S, E, T, U, C, K, P. So letter1 can be any letter not in that list, and not G, R, O, N (since those are already placed in positions 2-5).

Common remaining letters: B, D, F, H, L, M, Y, etc.

Looking for 5-letter words ending with RONG (but that would be 6 letters). Wait, no: the pattern is [letter1] R O N G, i.e., the word is letter1 followed by R, O, N, G. But that would be 5 letters: [letter1] R O N G.

But the only 5-letter words that fit this pattern are:

B R O N G → ""BRONG"" (valid word, though rare)
D R O N G → ""DRONG"" (valid, but also rare)
F R O N G → ""FRONG"" (valid)
H R O N G → ""HRONG"" (not a standard word)
L R O N G → ""LRONG"" (invalid)
M R O N G → ""MRONG"" (invalid)
Y R O N G → ""YRONG"" (invalid)

Among these, ""BRONG"", ""DRONG"", and ""FRONG"" are valid English words (though ""BRONG"" and ""DRONG"" are more slang/obscure). ""FRONG"" is also valid.

But looking at standard 5-letter words, the most common one fitting _ R O N G is ""BRONG"" (as in ""brong"" slang for ""bruh""), but this might be too obscure.

However, the feedback shows that all of R, O, N, G are in their correct positions, and P is not in position 1. Therefore the word must be [letter1] R O N G, with letter1 not P.

Given the constraints and common remaining letters, the most likely word is ""BRONG"".

But let me double-check: are there any other 5-letter words ending with RONG? No, the standard endings are like .rong in some dialects, but the only valid ones are the three mentioned.

Given that, I'll proceed with ""BRONG"" as the next logical guess.

We now know the pattern is _ R O N G with R, O, N, G locked in positions 2-5.  
Letters already ruled out include: A, I, S, E, T, U, C, K, P, B, F.

Still-valid consonants for position 1 (among common ones): D, H, L, M, Y, etc.

The only remaining standard 5-letter English word that fits ? R O N G is:

- D R O N G → “DRONG” (a valid word, though it appears mainly in slang/dialect)

All other single-consonant first-letter possibilities either aren’t words or have already been eliminated.

Therefore the only remaining logical guess is DRONG.
