### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll pick a word that uses some of these high-frequency letters in different positions to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Let me try a word like ""UNTIE"" but that has U and T plus I and E. But E must stay at the end, so ""UNTIE"" is invalid. Instead, I can try ""TINIE"" but that has I in the 2nd position and E in the 5th. However, ""TINIE"" might not be a valid word. 

Another option is ""CHIME"" - C, H, I, M, E. This uses common letters, keeps E at the end, and moves I to the 3rd position (but we know I is not in the 3rd position from the first guess), so this is invalid.

Next, ""DINER"" - but R is ruled out. ""LINER"" - R is ruled out. ""PINE"" is 4 letters. ""THINE"" - but H is okay, N is okay, I is moved to 2nd position, E stays. THINE is a valid word.

From the two guesses so far we know:

1. The word ends with E (E is in position 5 and marked ✓ both times).
2. The letter I is in the word but is NOT in position 3 (from RAISE) and NOT in position 3 again (from THINE), so I must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5. But 5 is already E, so I is in 1, 2, or 4.
3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: R, A, S, T, H, N.
4. Letters that are still possible: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus I and E).

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that contains I in position 1, 2, or 4 and does not contain any of the ruled-out letters.

Let’s look for common patterns:
- I _ _ _ E (I in position 1)
- _ I _ _ E (I in position 2)
- _ _ _ I E (I in position 4)

Common letters remaining: C, L, M, O, U, D, Y, etc.

Possible candidates:
- ""CIVIE"" – but V and C are okay, but ""CIVIE"" is not a standard word.
- ""DULIE"" – not a word.
- ""MULIE"" – not standard.
- ""LUMIE"" – not standard.
- ""CUBIE"" – not standard.
- ""DUBIE"" – not standard.
- ""MIDGE"" – contains D, G, but G is okay, but we need I in word, and it has I in position 2: M I D G E. But G is okay, D is okay, but we ruled out N, not G. MIDGE is a word, but let me check: M, I, D, G, E – none are ruled out except G is allowed. Wait, we haven't ruled out G. Actually, we only ruled out R, A, S, T, H, N. So G is allowed.

""MIDGE"" is a valid word, ends with E, has I in position 2, and none of the ruled-out letters. This seems good.

Another option: ""CIVIE"" is not valid, but ""CIVID"" is not valid. ""MIDGE"" seems the best.

Let me confirm: M, I, D, G, E – none are in the forbidden list (R, A, S, T, H, N). I is in position 2, which is allowed.

From the two guesses so far we know:

1. The word ends with E (E is in position 5 and marked ✓ both times).
2. The letter I is in the word but is NOT in position 3 (from RAISE) and NOT in position 3 again (from THINE), so I must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5. But 5 is already E, so I is in 1, 2, or 4.
3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: R, A, S, T, H, N.
4. Letters that are still possible: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus I and E).

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that contains I in position 1, 2, or 4 and does not contain any of the ruled-out letters.

Let’s look for common patterns:
- I _ _ _ E (I in position 1)
- _ I _ _ E (I in position 2)
- _ _ _ I E (I in position 4)

Common letters remaining: C, L, M, O, U, D, Y, etc.

Possible candidates:
- ""CIVIE"" – but V and C are okay, but ""CIVIE"" is not a standard word.
- ""DULIE"" – not a word.
- ""MULIE"" – not standard.
- ""LUMIE"" – not standard.
- ""CUBIE"" – not standard.
- ""DUBIE"" – not standard.
- ""MIDGE"" – contains D, G, but G is okay, but we need I in word, and it has I in position 2: M I D G E. But G is okay, D is okay, but we ruled out N, not G. MIDGE is a word, but let me check: M, I, D, G, E – none are ruled out except G is allowed. Wait, we haven't ruled out G. Actually, we only ruled out R, A, S, T, H, N. So G is allowed.

""MIDGE"" is a valid word, ends with E, has I in position 2, and none of the ruled-out letters. This seems good.

Another option: ""CIVIE"" is not valid, but ""CIVID"" is not valid. ""MIDGE"" seems the best.

Let me confirm: M, I, D, G, E – none are in the forbidden list (R, A, S, T, H, N). I is in position 2, which is allowed.

So, guess ""MIDGE"".

From the new feedback on MIDGE:
- M is NOT in the word (x)
- I is in the correct position (✓) – so I must be in position 2
- D is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- G is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the correct position (✓) – already known to be position 5

So now we know:
1. Word pattern: _ I _ _ E
2. Letters NOT in the word: R, A, S, T, H, N, M, G
3. Letter D is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from MIDGE). So D must be in position 1 or 4.
4. Remaining possible letters (not yet ruled out): B, C, F, J, K, L, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus D and I, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 2 and E in position 5
- Contains D in position 1 or 4
- Uses only allowed letters

Possible patterns:
- D I _ _ E (D in position 1)
- _ I _ D E (D in position 4)

Let's look for common words fitting these patterns with allowed letters.

Pattern 1: D I _ _ E
- DIARE – but A is ruled out
- DIBLE – B, L allowed, but ""DIBLE"" is not standard
- DIPER – P, R allowed but R is ruled out
- DIVER – V, R allowed but R is ruled out
- DIZZE – Z allowed, but double Z is unlikely

Pattern 2: _ I _ D E
- C I D E – too short
- F I D E – too short
- P I D E – too short
- V I D E – too short
- F I X D E – not valid
- C I D E – no
- L I D E – no
- B I D E – no
- K I D E – no
- C I D E – no
- F I D E – no
- W I D E – but we need 5 letters ending in E

Wait, let me think of 5-letter words ending in DE or IE... Actually we need _ I _ D E.

Looking for valid words:
- ""BIODE"" – B, O, D allowed, but is it a word? ""Bio..."" no
- ""CIODE"" – not a word
- ""FIODE"" – not a word
- ""LIODE"" – not a word
- ""PIODE"" – not a word
- ""VIODE"" – not a word
- ""WIODE"" – not a word
- ""DIODE"" – D, O, D allowed, but is it a word? ""Diode"" is a word (electronics term), but usually spelled ""diode"" (D-I-O-D-E). Let me check: D-I-O-D-E – fits _ I _ D E pattern with O in position 3. Letters: D, I, O, D, E. None are in the forbidden list. This seems valid.

So ""DIODE"" is a possible word fitting all constraints.

Another check:
- ""FIODE"" – not a word
- ""LIODE"" – not a word
- ""BIODE"" – not standard
- ""CIODE"" – not a word
- ""KIODE"" – not a word
- ""JIODE"" – not a word
- ""XIODE"" – not a word
- ""YIODE"" – not a word
- ""ZIODE"" – not a word

Thus, ""DIODE"" appears to be the only valid word fitting the pattern and constraints.

Let me verify:
- D in position 1: allowed (not ruled out)
- I in position 2: correct (✓)
- O in position 3: allowed (not ruled out)
- D in position 4: allowed (not ruled out, and since it was in position 3 in MIDGE, this is a new position)
- E in position 5: correct (✓)

This seems correct.
