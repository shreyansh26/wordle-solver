### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language. This helps maximize the chance of getting some feedback (either ✓ or -) to narrow down possibilities.

Common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use some of these letters. 

Popular first guesses include words like:
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose CRANE as it covers several very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

All five letters in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) are **not in the secret word**.  
That means I can completely ignore those letters and focus on the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet.

Since the first guess gave no hits, I want a word that:
- Uses entirely different letters (none of C,R,A,N,E)
- Contains common letters still available (e.g., S, T, L, O, I, U, D, M, P, etc.)
- Is a valid 5-letter English word

Good candidates:
- STOUT (S, T, O, U, T)
- DOUBT (D, O, U, B, T)
- PLUMB (P, L, U, M, B)
- SLUMP (S, L, U, M, P)

I’ll pick STOUT because it uses very common letters (S, T, O, U) plus a repeat T, giving good coverage.

So far we know:

- Letters **not in the word**: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, U
- Letter **in the word but in the wrong place**: O (from STOUT: O appeared as “-”)

Therefore the secret word:
- Must contain the letter O
- Must not contain C, R, A, N, E, S, T, U
- The O cannot be in position 3 (because that’s where it was in STOUT)

Available letters (excluding the known negatives):  
B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus O.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Includes O (not in position 3)
- Uses only the allowed letters
- Has no repeats of any excluded letter

Some candidate words:
- FLOKI – but U is excluded, so no.
- GLOBI – uses G, L, O, B, I. O is in position 3 → invalid (because O was in position 3 in STOUT and marked “-”, so it can’t be in position 3 again).
- MOLLY – uses M, O, L, L, Y → repeats L, and L is allowed, but position 3 is O again → invalid.
- BLOOM – uses B, L, O, O, M → repeats O → invalid.
- WIMPY – no O → invalid.
- VOGUE – uses V, O, G, U, E → U and E excluded → invalid.
- PLOUGH – uses P, L, O, U, G, H → U excluded → invalid.
- FOGGY – uses F, O, G, G, Y → repeats G → invalid.
- DOLLY – uses D, O, L, L, Y → repeats L → invalid.
- KNOBS – uses K, N, O, B, S → N and S excluded → invalid.
- JOCKY – uses J, O, C, K, Y → C excluded → invalid.
- LOPPY – uses L, O, P, P, Y → repeats P → invalid.
- MIDGE – uses M, I, D, G, E → E excluded → invalid.
- VOGUE – already checked.
- BLOKE – uses B, L, O, K, E → E excluded → invalid.

- WOMAN – uses W, O, M, A, N → A and N excluded → invalid.
- PLOMP – uses P, L, O, M, P → repeats P → invalid.
- BOBBY – uses B, O, B, B, Y → repeats B → invalid.
- GUMMY – uses G, U, M, M, Y → U excluded → invalid.
- VOGUE – again, U and E excluded.

Let me look for words where O is not in position 3.

Good candidates:
- BOBBY – but O is in position 2, and B repeats → but the word must be valid and use allowed letters. BOBBY is valid, but has repeated B. Is that allowed? The rules don’t forbid repeats, so it’s possible.
- FOGIE – uses F, O, G, I, E → E excluded → invalid.
- JOCKO – uses J, O, C, K, O → C and repeats O → invalid.
- MOKED – uses M, O, K, E, D → E excluded → invalid.
- POKER – uses P, O, K, E, R → E and R excluded → invalid.
- WOMAN – already invalid.

- BOOGE – again E excluded.
- DOOGY – uses D, O, O, G, Y → repeats O → invalid.
- FOGGY – uses F, O, G, G, Y → repeats G → invalid.
- JOGGY – uses J, O, G, G, Y → repeats G → invalid.

- VOOFY – uses V, O, O, F, Y → repeats O → invalid.
- BOOFY – uses B, O, O, F, Y → repeats O → invalid.
- GOOFY – again repeats O.

Let me try to find a word with O not in position 3, no excluded letters.

Looking at remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:
- BLOKI – but I is allowed, K is allowed, but U is excluded, so no U → this is valid. B, L, O, K, I. O is in position 3 → invalid (because in STOUT, O was in position 3 and marked “-”, so O cannot be in position 3).
- BLOKI – invalid position for O.
- FLIKI – no O → invalid.
- FLOKI – no U, but O in position 3 → invalid.
- GLOBI – O in position 3 → invalid.
- HOMMY – no O → invalid.
- JOKIM – no O → invalid.
- KLOOF – uses K, L, O, O, F → repeats O → invalid.
- LIMPY – no O → invalid.
- MOLLY – O in position 2, but L repeats → but the word must be valid. MOLLY is valid, but has two L’s. Is that allowed? The rules don’t forbid repeats, so it’s possible. O is in position 2 → allowed.
- PLOMP – O in position 3 → invalid.
- PLOMY – no, O in position 3 → invalid.
- VOGUE – invalid letters.
- WOMMY – no O → invalid.

MOLLY seems valid: M, O, L, L, Y. Letters used are all allowed (M, O, L, Y), O is in position 2 (not 3), no excluded letters. Repeats L are allowed.

Another candidate: LIMBO – uses L, I, M, B, O. O is in position 5 → allowed. Letters are all allowed.
- LIMBO: L, I, M, B, O. No excluded letters, O is in position 5.

Between MOLLY and LIMBO, both seem valid. LIMBO has more unique letters, so it might be better for information.

Let me check LIMBO:
- Letters: L, I, M, B, O
- None are in the excluded list (C,R,A,N,E,S,T,U)
- O is in position 5 (not 3), so it satisfies the feedback.

Therefore, LIMBO is a good next guess.

Let me try to find a word with O not in position 3, no excluded letters.

Looking at remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:
- BLOKI – but I is allowed, K is allowed, but U is excluded, so no U → this is valid. B, L, O, K, I. O is in position 3 → invalid (because in STOUT, O was in position 3 and marked “-”, so O cannot be in position 3).
- BLOKI – invalid position for O.
- FLIKI – no O → invalid.
- FLOKI – no U, but O in position 3 → invalid.
- GLOBI – O in position 3 → invalid.
- HOMMY – no O → invalid.
- JOKIM – no O → invalid.
- KLOOF – uses K, L, O, O, F → repeats O → invalid.
- LIMPY – no O → invalid.
- MOLLY – O in position 2, but L repeats → but the word must be valid. MOLLY is valid, but has two L’s. Is that allowed? The rules don’t forbid repeats, so it’s possible. O is in position 2 → allowed.
- PLOMP – O in position 3 → invalid.
- PLOMY – no, O in position 3 → invalid.
- VOGUE – invalid letters.
- WOMMY – no O → invalid.

MOLLY seems valid: M, O, L, L, Y. Letters used are all allowed (M, O, L, Y), O is in position 2 (not 3), no excluded letters. Repeats L are allowed.

Another candidate: LIMBO – uses L, I, M, B, O. O is in position 5 → allowed. Letters are all allowed.
- LIMBO: L, I, M, B, O. No excluded letters, O is in position 5.

Between MOLLY and LIMBO, both seem valid. LIMBO has more unique letters, so it might be better for information.

Let me check LIMBO:
- Letters: L, I, M, B, O
- None are in the excluded list (C,R,A,N,E,S,T,U)
- O is in position 5 (not 3), so it satisfies the feedback.

Therefore, LIMBO is a good next guess.",Guess 3: LIMBO -> FEEDBACK: L(x) I(x) M(x) B(x) O(-),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language. This helps maximize the chance of getting some feedback (either ✓ or -) to narrow down possibilities.

Common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use some of these letters. 

Popular first guesses include words like:
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose CRANE as it covers several very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) are **not in the secret word**.  
That means I can completely ignore those letters and focus on the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet.

Since the first guess gave no hits, I want a word that:
- Uses entirely different letters (none of C,R,A,N,E)
- Contains common letters still available (e.g., S, T, L, O, I, U, D, M, P, etc.)
- Is a valid 5-letter English word

Good candidates:
- STOUT (S, T, O, U, T)
- DOUBT (D, O, U, B, T)
- PLUMB (P, L, U, M, B)
- SLUMP (S, L, U, M, P)

I’ll pick STOUT because it uses very common letters (S, T, O, U) plus a repeat T, giving good coverage.

So far we know:

- Letters **not in the word**: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, U
- Letter **in the word but in the wrong place**: O (from STOUT: O appeared as “-”)

Therefore the secret word:
- Must contain the letter O
- Must not contain C, R, A, N, E, S, T, U
- The O cannot be in position 3 (because that’s where it was in STOUT)

Available letters (excluding the known negatives):  
B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus O.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Includes O (not in position 3)
- Uses only the allowed letters
- Has no repeats of any excluded letter

Some candidate words:
- FLOKI – but U is excluded, so no.
- GLOBI – uses G, L, O, B, I. O is in position 3 → invalid (because O was in position 3 in STOUT and marked “-”, so it can’t be in position 3 again).
- MOLLY – uses M, O, L, L, Y → repeats L, and L is allowed, but position 3 is O again → invalid.
- BLOOM – uses B, L, O, O, M → repeats O → invalid.
- WIMPY – no O → invalid.
- VOGUE – uses V, O, G, U, E → U and E excluded → invalid.
- PLOUGH – uses P, L, O, U, G, H → U excluded → invalid.
- FOGGY – uses F, O, G, G, Y → repeats G → invalid.
- DOLLY – uses D, O, L, L, Y → repeats L → invalid.
- KNOBS – uses K, N, O, B, S → N and S excluded → invalid.
- JOCKY – uses J, O, C, K, Y → C excluded → invalid.
- LOPPY – uses L, O, P, P, Y → repeats P → invalid.
- MIDGE – uses M, I, D, G, E → E excluded → invalid.
- VOGUE – already checked.
- BLOKE – uses B, L, O, K, E → E excluded → invalid.
- FOLLY – uses F, O, L, L, Y → repeats L → invalid.
- GLOOM – uses G, L, O, O, M → repeats O → invalid.
- HOMER – uses H, O, M, E, R → E and R excluded → invalid.
- WOMAN – uses W, O, M, A, N → A and N excluded → invalid.
- PLOMP – uses P, L, O, M, P → repeats P → invalid.
- BOBBY – uses B, O, B, B, Y → repeats B → invalid.
- GUMMY – uses G, U, M, M, Y → U excluded → invalid.
- VOGUE – again, U and E excluded.

Let me look for words where O is not in position 3.

Good candidates:
- BOBBY – but O is in position 2, and B repeats → but the word must be valid and use allowed letters. BOBBY is valid, but has repeated B. Is that allowed? The rules don’t forbid repeats, so it’s possible.
- FOGIE – uses F, O, G, I, E → E excluded → invalid.
- JOCKO – uses J, O, C, K, O → C and repeats O → invalid.
- MOKED – uses M, O, K, E, D → E excluded → invalid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language. This helps maximize the chance of getting some feedback (either ✓ or -) to narrow down possibilities.

Common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use some of these letters. 

Popular first guesses include words like:
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose CRANE as it covers several very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) are **not in the secret word**.  
That means I can completely ignore those letters and focus on the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet.

Since the first guess gave no hits, I want a word that:
- Uses entirely different letters (none of C,R,A,N,E)
- Contains common letters still available (e.g., S, T, L, O, I, U, D, M, P, etc.)
- Is a valid 5-letter English word

Good candidates:
- STOUT (S, T, O, U, T)
- DOUBT (D, O, U, B, T)
- PLUMB (P, L, U, M, B)
- SLUMP (S, L, U, M, P)

I’ll pick STOUT because it uses very common letters (S, T, O, U) plus a repeat T, giving good coverage.

Guess 2: STOUT -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(-) U(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
So far we know:

- Letters **not in the word**: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, U
- Letter **in the word but in the wrong place**: O (from STOUT: O appeared as “-”)

Therefore the secret word:
- Must contain the letter O
- Must not contain C, R, A, N, E, S, T, U
- The O cannot be in position 3 (because that’s where it was in STOUT)

Available letters (excluding the known negatives):  
B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus O.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Includes O (not in position 3)
- Uses only the allowed letters
- Has no repeats of any excluded letter

Some candidate words:
- FLOKI – but U is excluded, so no.
- GLOBI – uses G, L, O, B, I. O is in position 3 → invalid (because O was in position 3 in STOUT and marked “-”, so it can’t be in position 3 again).
- MOLLY – uses M, O, L, L, Y → repeats L, and L is allowed, but position 3 is O again → invalid.
- BLOOM – uses B, L, O, O, M → repeats O → invalid.
- WIMPY – no O → invalid.
- VOGUE – uses V, O, G, U, E → U and E excluded → invalid.
- PLOUGH – uses P, L, O, U, G, H → U excluded → invalid.
- FOGGY – uses F, O, G, G, Y → repeats G → invalid.
- DOLLY – uses D, O, L, L, Y → repeats L → invalid.
- KNOBS – uses K, N, O, B, S → N and S excluded → invalid.
- JOCKY – uses J, O, C, K, Y → C excluded → invalid.
- LOPPY – uses L, O, P, P, Y → repeats P → invalid.
- MIDGE – uses M, I, D, G, E → E excluded → invalid.
- VOGUE – already checked.
- BLOKE – uses B, L, O, K, E → E excluded → invalid.
- FOLLY – uses F, O, L, L, Y → repeats L → invalid.
- GLOOM – uses G, L, O, O, M → repeats O → invalid.
- HOMER – uses H, O, M, E, R → E and R excluded → invalid.
- WOMAN – uses W, O, M, A, N → A and N excluded → invalid.
- PLOMP – uses P, L, O, M, P → repeats P → invalid.
- BOBBY – uses B, O, B, B, Y → repeats B → invalid.
- GUMMY – uses G, U, M, M, Y → U excluded → invalid.
- VOGUE – again, U and E excluded.

Let me look for words where O is not in position 3.

Good candidates:
- BOBBY – but O is in position 2, and B repeats → but the word must be valid and use allowed letters. BOBBY is valid, but has repeated B. Is that allowed? The rules don’t forbid repeats, so it’s possible.
- FOGIE – uses F, O, G, I, E → E excluded → invalid.
- JOCKO – uses J, O, C, K, O → C and repeats O → invalid.
- MOKED – uses M, O, K, E, D → E excluded → invalid.
- POKER – uses P, O, K, E, R → E and R excluded → invalid.
- WOMAN – already invalid.
- BOOGE – uses B, O, O, G, E → E excluded → invalid.
- DOOGE – uses D, O, O, G, E → E excluded → invalid.
- FOGEY – uses F, O, G, E, Y → E excluded → invalid.
- JOGEY – uses J, O, G, E, Y → E excluded → invalid.
- POGEY – uses P, O, G, E, Y → E excluded → invalid.
- VOGEY – uses V, O, G, E, Y → E excluded → invalid.
- BOOGE – again E excluded.
- DOOGY – uses D, O, O, G, Y → repeats O → invalid.
- FOGGY – uses F, O, G, G, Y → repeats G → invalid.
- JOGGY – uses J, O, G, G, Y → repeats G → invalid.
- MOGGY – uses M, O, G, G, Y → repeats G → invalid.
- POGGY – uses P, O, G, G, Y → repeats G → invalid.
- VOGGY – uses V, O, G, G, Y → repeats G → invalid.
- BOGGY – uses B, O, G, G, Y → repeats G → invalid.
- DOGGY – uses D, O, G, G, Y → repeats G → invalid.
- GOOFY – uses G, O, O, F, Y → repeats O → invalid.
- JOOFY – uses J, O, O, F, Y → repeats O → invalid.
- MOOFY – uses M, O, O, F, Y → repeats O → invalid.
- POOFY – uses P, O, O, F, Y → repeats O → invalid.
- VOOFY – uses V, O, O, F, Y → repeats O → invalid.
- BOOFY – uses B, O, O, F, Y → repeats O → invalid.
- GOOFY – again repeats O.

Let me try to find a word with O not in position 3, no excluded letters.

Looking at remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:
- BLOKI – but I is allowed, K is allowed, but U is excluded, so no U → this is valid. B, L, O, K, I. O is in position 3 → invalid (because in STOUT, O was in position 3 and marked “-”, so O cannot be in position 3).
- BLOKI – invalid position for O.
- FLIKI – no O → invalid.
- FLOKI – no U, but O in position 3 → invalid.
- GLOBI – O in position 3 → invalid.
- HOMMY – no O → invalid.
- JOKIM – no O → invalid.
- KLOOF – uses K, L, O, O, F → repeats O → invalid.
- LIMPY – no O → invalid.
- MOLLY – O in position 2, but L repeats → but the word must be valid. MOLLY is valid, but has two L’s. Is that allowed? The rules don’t forbid repeats, so it’s possible. O is in position 2 → allowed.
- PLOMP – O in position 3 → invalid.
- PLOMY – no, O in position 3 → invalid.
- VOGUE – invalid letters.
- WOMMY – no O → invalid.

MOLLY seems valid: M, O, L, L, Y. Letters used are all allowed (M, O, L, Y), O is in position 2 (not 3), no excluded letters. Repeats L are allowed.

Another candidate: LIMBO – uses L, I, M, B, O. O is in position 5 → allowed. Letters are all allowed.
- LIMBO: L, I, M, B, O. No excluded letters, O is in position 5.

Between MOLLY and LIMBO, both seem valid. LIMBO has more unique letters, so it might be better for information.

Let me check LIMBO:
- Letters: L, I, M, B, O
- None are in the excluded list (C,R,A,N,E,S,T,U)
- O is in position 5 (not 3), so it satisfies the feedback.

Therefore, LIMBO is a good next guess.

We now know:

- Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, U, L, I, M, B  
- Letter O is in the word, but it cannot be in positions 3 or 5 (it was “-” in both STOUT and LIMBO).

So O must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

Available letters (from the full alphabet minus the excluded ones):
D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the required O.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
1. Contains exactly one O (no repeats).
2. Places O in position 1, 2, or 4.
3. Uses only the allowed letters.

Candidate words satisfying these constraints:
- DOGMY – invalid (DOGMY not a word).
- FOGGY – repeats G and Y, and G is allowed but double G not helpful.
- JOKPY – not a word.
- KOPHY – not a word.
- POKED – uses P, O, K, E, D → E excluded → invalid.
- VOGUE – uses U and V, but U excluded → invalid.
- WOKEN – uses W, O, K, E, N → E and N excluded → invalid.
- YOKED – uses Y, O, K, E, D → E excluded → invalid.
- ZOGGY – repeats G → invalid.
- DOUGH – uses D, O, U, G, H → U excluded → invalid.
- FOULY – uses U → invalid.
- GODLY – uses G, O, D, L, Y → L excluded → invalid.
- JOKED – uses J, O, K, E, D → E excluded → invalid.
- KOPHY – not a word.
- PODGY – uses P, O, D, G, Y → all allowed, O in position 2.
- VOGUE – U excluded.
- WODGE – uses W, O, D, G, E → E excluded → invalid.
- YOKED – E excluded.
- ZONKY – uses Z, O, N, K, Y → N excluded → invalid.

Valid word found: PODGY
- Letters: P, O, D, G, Y – all allowed.
- O is in position 2 (allowed positions: 1,2,4).
- No repeats of any excluded letter.

This seems the best next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language. This helps maximize the chance of getting some feedback (either ✓ or -) to narrow down possibilities.

Common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use some of these letters. 

Popular first guesses include words like:
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose CRANE as it covers several very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) are **not in the secret word**.  
That means I can completely ignore those letters and focus on the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet.

Since the first guess gave no hits, I want a word that:
- Uses entirely different letters (none of C,R,A,N,E)
- Contains common letters still available (e.g., S, T, L, O, I, U, D, M, P, etc.)
- Is a valid 5-letter English word

Good candidates:
- STOUT (S, T, O, U, T)
- DOUBT (D, O, U, B, T)
- PLUMB (P, L, U, M, B)
- SLUMP (S, L, U, M, P)

I’ll pick STOUT because it uses very common letters (S, T, O, U) plus a repeat T, giving good coverage.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
So far we know:

- Letters **not in the word**: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, U
- Letter **in the word but in the wrong place**: O (from STOUT: O appeared as “-”)

Therefore the secret word:
- Must contain the letter O
- Must not contain C, R, A, N, E, S, T, U
- The O cannot be in position 3 (because that’s where it was in STOUT)

Available letters (excluding the known negatives):  
B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus O.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Includes O (not in position 3)
- Uses only the allowed letters
- Has no repeats of any excluded letter

Some candidate words:
- FLOKI – but U is excluded, so no.
- GLOBI – uses G, L, O, B, I. O is in position 3 → invalid (because O was in position 3 in STOUT and marked “-”, so it can’t be in position 3 again).
- MOLLY – uses M, O, L, L, Y → repeats L, and L is allowed, but position 3 is O again → invalid.
- BLOOM – uses B, L, O, O, M → repeats O → invalid.
- WIMPY – no O → invalid.
- VOGUE – uses V, O, G, U, E → U and E excluded → invalid.
- PLOUGH – uses P, L, O, U, G, H → U excluded → invalid.
- FOGGY – uses F, O, G, G, Y → repeats G → invalid.
- DOLLY – uses D, O, L, L, Y → repeats L → invalid.
- KNOBS – uses K, N, O, B, S → N and S excluded → invalid.
- JOCKY – uses J, O, C, K, Y → C excluded → invalid.
- LOPPY – uses L, O, P, P, Y → repeats P → invalid.
- MIDGE – uses M, I, D, G, E → E excluded → invalid.
- VOGUE – already checked.
- BLOKE – uses B, L, O, K, E → E excluded → invalid.
- FOLLY – uses F, O, L, L, Y → repeats L → invalid.
- GLOOM – uses G, L, O, O, M → repeats O → invalid.
- HOMER – uses H, O, M, E, R → E and R excluded → invalid.
- WOMAN – uses W, O, M, A, N → A and N excluded → invalid.
- PLOMP – uses P, L, O, M, P → repeats P → invalid.
- BOBBY – uses B, O, B, B, Y → repeats B → invalid.
- GUMMY – uses G, U, M, M, Y → U excluded → invalid.
- VOGUE – again, U and E excluded.

Let me look for words where O is not in position 3.

Good candidates:
- BOBBY – but O is in position 2, and B repeats → but the word must be valid and use allowed letters. BOBBY is valid, but has repeated B. Is that allowed? The rules don’t forbid repeats, so it’s possible.
- FOGIE – uses F, O, G, I, E → E excluded → invalid.
- JOCKO – uses J, O, C, K, O → C and repeats O → invalid.
- MOKED – uses M, O, K, E, D → E excluded → invalid.
- POKER – uses P, O, K, E, R → E and R excluded → invalid.
- WOMAN – already invalid.
- BOOGE – uses B, O, O, G, E → E excluded → invalid.
- DOOGE – uses D, O, O, G, E → E excluded → invalid.
- FOGEY – uses F, O, G, E, Y → E excluded → invalid.
- JOGEY – uses J, O, G, E, Y → E excluded → invalid.
- POGEY – uses P, O, G, E, Y → E excluded → invalid.
- VOGEY – uses V, O, G, E, Y → E excluded → invalid.
- BOOGE – again E excluded.
- DOOGY – uses D, O, O, G, Y → repeats O → invalid.
- FOGGY – uses F, O, G, G, Y → repeats G → invalid.
- JOGGY – uses J, O, G, G, Y → repeats G → invalid.
- MOGGY – uses M, O, G, G, Y → repeats G → invalid.
- POGGY – uses P, O, G, G, Y → repeats G → invalid.
- VOGGY – uses V, O, G, G, Y → repeats G → invalid.
- BOGGY – uses B, O, G, G, Y → repeats G → invalid.
- DOGGY – uses D, O, G, G, Y → repeats G → invalid.
- GOOFY – uses G, O, O, F, Y → repeats O → invalid.
- JOOFY – uses J, O, O, F, Y → repeats O → invalid.
- MOOFY – uses M, O, O, F, Y → repeats O → invalid.
- POOFY – uses P, O, O, F, Y → repeats O → invalid.
- VOOFY – uses V, O, O, F, Y → repeats O → invalid.
- BOOFY – uses B, O, O, F, Y → repeats O → invalid.
- GOOFY – again repeats O.

Let me try to find a word with O not in position 3, no excluded letters.

Looking at remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:
- BLOKI – but I is allowed, K is allowed, but U is excluded, so no U → this is valid. B, L, O, K, I. O is in position 3 → invalid (because in STOUT, O was in position 3 and marked “-”, so O cannot be in position 3).
- BLOKI – invalid position for O.
- FLIKI – no O → invalid.
- FLOKI – no U, but O in position 3 → invalid.
- GLOBI – O in position 3 → invalid.
- HOMMY – no O → invalid.
- JOKIM – no O → invalid.
- KLOOF – uses K, L, O, O, F → repeats O → invalid.
- LIMPY – no O → invalid.
- MOLLY – O in position 2, but L repeats → but the word must be valid. MOLLY is valid, but has two L’s. Is that allowed? The rules don’t forbid repeats, so it’s possible. O is in position 2 → allowed.
- PLOMP – O in position 3 → invalid.
- PLOMY – no, O in position 3 → invalid.
- VOGUE – invalid letters.
- WOMMY – no O → invalid.

MOLLY seems valid: M, O, L, L, Y. Letters used are all allowed (M, O, L, Y), O is in position 2 (not 3), no excluded letters. Repeats L are allowed.

Another candidate: LIMBO – uses L, I, M, B, O. O is in position 5 → allowed. Letters are all allowed.
- LIMBO: L, I, M, B, O. No excluded letters, O is in position 5.

Between MOLLY and LIMBO, both seem valid. LIMBO has more unique letters, so it might be better for information.

Let me check LIMBO:
- Letters: L, I, M, B, O
- None are in the excluded list (C,R,A,N,E,S,T,U)
- O is in position 5 (not 3), so it satisfies the feedback.

Therefore, LIMBO is a good next guess.

We now know:

- Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, U, L, I, M, B  
- Letter O is in the word, but it cannot be in positions 3 or 5 (it was “-” in both STOUT and LIMBO).

So O must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

Available letters (from the full alphabet minus the excluded ones):
D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the required O.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
1. Contains exactly one O (no repeats).
2. Places O in position 1, 2, or 4.
3. Uses only the allowed letters.

Candidate words satisfying these constraints:
- DOGMY – invalid (DOGMY not a word).
- FOGGY – repeats G and Y, and G is allowed but double G not helpful.
- JOKPY – not a word.
- KOPHY – not a word.
- POKED – uses P, O, K, E, D → E excluded → invalid.
- VOGUE – uses U and V, but U excluded → invalid.
- WOKEN – uses W, O, K, E, N → E and N excluded → invalid.
- YOKED – uses Y, O, K, E, D → E excluded → invalid.
- ZOGGY – repeats G → invalid.
- DOUGH – uses D, O, U, G, H → U excluded → invalid.
- FOULY – uses U → invalid.
- GODLY – uses G, O, D, L, Y → L excluded → invalid.
- JOKED – uses J, O, K, E, D → E excluded → invalid.
- KOPHY – not a word.
- PODGY – uses P, O, D, G, Y → all allowed, O in position 2.
- VOGUE – U excluded.
- WODGE – uses W, O, D, G, E → E excluded → invalid.
- YOKED – E excluded.
- ZONKY – uses Z, O, N, K, Y → N excluded → invalid.

Valid word found: PODGY
- Letters: P, O, D, G, Y – all allowed.
- O is in position 2 (allowed positions: 1,2,4).
- No repeats of any excluded letter.

This seems the best next guess.

O is in position 2 → allowed.\n- PLOMP – O in position 3 → invalid.\n- PLOMY – no, O in position 3 → invalid.\n- VOGUE – invalid letters.\n- WOMMY – no O → invalid.\n\nMOLLY seems valid: M, O, L, L, Y.

Letters are all allowed.\n- LIMBO: L, I, M, B, O. No excluded letters, O is in position 5.\n\nBetween MOLLY and LIMBO, both seem valid.

What we now know for certain:

1. Positions:
   - Position 2: O (✓)
   - Position 4: D (✓)
   - Position 5: Y (✓)
   So the pattern is: _ O _ D Y

2. Letters NOT in the word (from all previous x’s):
   C, R, A, N, E, S, T, U, L, I, M, B, P, G, K

3. Letter D is in the word but NOT in position 3 (because in KODDY it was in position 4 and marked ✓, so the earlier D in position 3 must have been wrong).  
   Therefore D must appear exactly once, and it is in position 4.

4. Available letters (the rest of the alphabet minus the excluded ones):
   D is already placed at position 4.  
   Remaining unused letters: D (but only once), F, H, J, Q, V, W, X, Z.

5. We need a valid 5-letter word matching: _ O _ D Y.

Candidate words:
- F O _ D Y → FODY? Not a valid word.
- H O _ D Y → HODY? Not valid.
- J O _ D Y → JODY? Valid (short for JD or a name).
- V O _ D Y → VODY? Not valid.
- W O _ D Y → WODY? Not valid.
- X O _ D Y → XODY? Not valid.
- Z O _ D Y → ZODY? Valid (a name or slang).

Between JODY and ZODY:
- JODY: J is allowed, O and D positions correct, Y at end correct. Word is valid.
- ZODY: Z is allowed, O and D positions correct, Y at end correct. Word is valid.

Both fit, but JODY is more common. Let’s choose JODY.
