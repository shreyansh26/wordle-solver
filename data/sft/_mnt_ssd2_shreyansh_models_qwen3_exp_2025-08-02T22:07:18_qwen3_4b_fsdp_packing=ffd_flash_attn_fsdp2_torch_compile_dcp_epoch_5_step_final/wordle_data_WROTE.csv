For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, U, I. A good starting word should use some of these letters while avoiding duplicates to test as many letters as possible. 

Popular strong starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers S, L, A, T, E - five very common letters in different positions.

From the feedback:
- T is in the word and in the correct 4th position.
- E is in the word and in the correct 5th position.
- S, L, A are NOT in the word.

So far we know the secret word looks like: _ _ _ T E

Letters we can rule out entirely: S, L, A.

We want a word that:
1. Ends in TE (fourth letter T, fifth letter E)
2. Does NOT contain S, L, A
3. Uses new common letters we haven't tried yet

Common letters we haven't tried: R, O, N, I, C, H, U, D, M, P, etc.

Good candidates:
- CRUTE (but U is less common)
- DRUTE (D, R, U, T, E - but T is already known in position 4)
- PRUTE (P, R, U, T, E)
- TRITE (but T is already in position 4, so duplicate T)
- GRITE (G, R, I, T, E)

""CRUTE"" is a valid word meaning a small surgical instrument, but it's less common. ""PRUTE"" is also valid but rarer. ""GRITE"" is valid but G is less common. 

A better choice is ""DRUTE"" - D, R, U, T, E - but I'm not sure if that's the most common word. 

Another approach: use common consonants and vowels we haven't tried yet. 

""CRITE"" is valid but uses I which we haven't tried. 

Actually, ""CRITE"" is valid (archaic plural of critique), but better is ""CRUTE"". 

But let me think of more common words ending in TE with T in 4th position: ""CRATE"", ""GRATE"", ""PRATE"", ""TRATE"" (invalid), ""DRATE"" (invalid), ""FRATE"" (invalid).

""GRATE"" is valid and uses G, R, A, T, E - but A is already ruled out. 

""CRATE"" is valid and uses C, R, A, T, E - but A is ruled out. 

""PRATE"" is valid and uses P, R, A, T, E - but A is ruled out. 

""TRITE"" is invalid because T is already in position 4. 

""FRITE"" is invalid. 

""ORITE"" is valid (a type of rock), uses O, R, I, T, E - but O and I are new letters. 

""ORITE"" seems like a good choice as it introduces O and R while fitting the pattern.

But let me reconsider: we need to maximize new information. 

Letters we've used: S, L, A, T, E
Letters we know nothing about: R, O, N, I, C, H, U, D, M, P, etc.

A better word might be ""CRONE"" but it doesn't fit T in position 4. 

Wait, the pattern is _ _ _ T E, so the word must be 5 letters ending with TE, with T in 4th position. 

Valid words ending with TE with T in 4th position:
- CRUTE
- PRUTE
- ORITE
- GRITE
- DRITE (invalid)
- FRITE (invalid)

Among these, ""ORITE"" is the most common word I can think of. 

But let me think if there's a more common word. 

Another valid word is ""CRATE"" but A is ruled out. 

""GRATE"" has A ruled out. 

""PRATE"" has A ruled out. 

""CRUTE"" is valid but less common. 

""PRUTE"" is valid but rare. 

""ORITE"" seems the best as it introduces O and R. 

But actually, ""TRITE"" is invalid due to duplicate T. 

Another valid word is ""CRITE"" but it's archaic. 

""FRITE"" is invalid. 

""DRI TE"" is invalid. 

So the best valid and common word seems to be ""ORITE"". 

But wait, is ""ORITE"" common? Maybe ""CRUTE"" is better. 

Alternatively, ""GRITE"" is valid but G is less common. 

After reconsidering, ""CRUTE"" is actually a valid and reasonably common word in medical contexts. 

But to maximize common letters, perhaps ""GRIME"" but it doesn't fit the TE ending. 

I think ""ORITE"" is the best choice here as it fits the pattern and introduces new common letters O and R. 

But let me double-check: the pattern is _ _ _ T E, so the word must be 5 letters ending with TE, with T in 4th position. 

Valid words:
- CRUTE
- PRUTE
- ORITE
- GRITE
- DRITE (invalid)
- FRITE (invalid)

Among these, ""CRUTE"" is the most common word I can think of. 

So I'll go with ""CRUTE"".
</think>

Based on the feedback:
- The word ends with ""TE"" (T in 4th, E in 5th)
- Letters S, L, A are not in the word

I'll try a word that fits this pattern and introduces new common letters.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, U, I.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, U, I. A good starting word should use some of these letters while avoiding duplicates to test as many letters as possible. 

Popular strong starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers S, L, A, T, E - five very common letters in different positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- T is in the word and in the correct 4th position.
- E is in the word and in the correct 5th position.
- S, L, A are NOT in the word.

So far we know the secret word looks like: _ _ _ T E

Letters we can rule out entirely: S, L, A.

We want a word that:
1. Ends in TE (fourth letter T, fifth letter E)
2. Does NOT contain S, L, A
3. Uses new common letters we haven't tried yet

Common letters we haven't tried: R, O, N, I, C, H, U, D, M, P, etc.

Good candidates:
- CRUTE (but U is less common)
- DRUTE (D, R, U, T, E - but T is already known in position 4)
- PRUTE (P, R, U, T, E)
- TRITE (but T is already in position 4, so duplicate T)
- GRITE (G, R, I, T, E)

""CRUTE"" is a valid word meaning a small surgical instrument, but it's less common. ""PRUTE"" is also valid but rarer. ""GRITE"" is valid but G is less common. 

A better choice is ""DRUTE"" - D, R, U, T, E - but I'm not sure if that's the most common word. 

Another approach: use common consonants and vowels we haven't tried yet. 

""CRITE"" is valid but uses I which we haven't tried. 

Actually, ""CRITE"" is valid (archaic plural of critique), but better is ""CRUTE"". 

But let me think of more common words ending in TE with T in 4th position: ""CRATE"", ""GRATE"", ""PRATE"", ""TRATE"" (invalid), ""DRATE"" (invalid), ""FRATE"" (invalid).

""GRATE"" is valid and uses G, R, A, T, E - but A is already ruled out. 

""CRATE"" is valid and uses C, R, A, T, E - but A is ruled out. 

""PRATE"" is valid and uses P, R, A, T, E - but A is ruled out. 

""TRITE"" is invalid because T is already in position 4. 

""FRITE"" is invalid. 

""ORITE"" is valid (a type of rock), uses O, R, I, T, E - but O and I are new letters. 

""ORITE"" seems like a good choice as it introduces O and R while fitting the pattern.

But let me reconsider: we need to maximize new information. 

Letters we've used: S, L, A, T, E
Letters we know nothing about: R, O, N, I, C, H, U, D, M, P, etc.

A better word might be ""CRONE"" but it doesn't fit T in position 4. 

Wait, the pattern is _ _ _ T E, so the word must be 5 letters ending with TE, with T in 4th position. 

Valid words ending with TE with T in 4th position:
- CRUTE
- PRUTE
- ORITE
- GRITE
- DRITE (invalid)
- FRITE (invalid)

Among these, ""ORITE"" is the most common word I can think of. 

But let me think if there's a more common word. 

Another valid word is ""CRATE"" but A is ruled out. 

""GRATE"" has A ruled out. 

""PRATE"" has A ruled out. 

""CRUTE"" is valid but less common. 

""PRUTE"" is valid but rare. 

""ORITE"" seems the best as it introduces O and R. 

But actually, ""TRITE"" is invalid due to duplicate T. 

Another valid word is ""CRITE"" but it's archaic. 

""FRITE"" is invalid. 

""DRI TE"" is invalid. 

So the best valid and common word seems to be ""ORITE"". 

But wait, is ""ORITE"" common? Maybe ""CRUTE"" is better. 

Alternatively, ""GRITE"" is valid but G is less common. 

After reconsidering, ""CRUTE"" is actually a valid and reasonably common word in medical contexts. 

But to maximize common letters, perhaps ""GRIME"" but it doesn't fit the TE ending. 

I think ""ORITE"" is the best choice here as it fits the pattern and introduces new common letters O and R. 

But let me double-check: the pattern is _ _ _ T E, so the word must be 5 letters ending with TE, with T in 4th position. 

Valid words:
- CRUTE
- PRUTE
- ORITE
- GRITE
- DRITE (invalid)
- FRITE (invalid)

Among these, ""CRUTE"" is the most common word I can think of. 

So I'll go with ""CRUTE"".Based on the feedback:
- The word ends with ""TE"" (T in 4th, E in 5th)
- Letters S, L, A are not in the word

I'll try a word that fits this pattern and introduces new common letters.

- Positions: 1=G, 2=R, 3=I, 4=T, 5=E.

  (R is locked in position 2, T in 4, E in 5)

- Letters ruled out: S, L, A, C, U, G, I  
- Still allowed and already confirmed: R, T, E  
- Remaining untested common letters: B, D, F, H, K, M, N, O, P, V, W, Y

We need a word of the form: ? R ? T E  
Available letters for positions 1 and 3 (from remaining set).

Let’s list valid English words fitting ? R ? T E:

- B R O T E → “BROTE” – not a valid word  
- B R A T E – A ruled out  
- B R I T E – I ruled out  
- B R U T E – U ruled out  
- C R O T E – C ruled out  
- D R O T E – not a word  
- D R I T E – I ruled out  
- F R O T E – not a word  
- H R O T E – not a word  
- M R O T E – not a word  
- N R O T E – not a word  
- O R ? T E – O can’t be in position 1 because we need a letter in position 1, and O is only possible in 3  
- P R O T E – fits: P, R, O, T, E – none of the ruled-out letters appear  
- V R O T E – not a word  
- W R O T E – valid word  
- Y R O T E – not a word  

So two valid candidates:  
1. P R O T E → “PROTE” (valid, short for protein)  
2. W R O T E → “WRITE” (valid, past of write) – but W is in position 1 and E in 5, fits.

Between them, “WRITE” is more common and uses O, which we haven’t tested yet.  
“PROTE” is also valid but slightly less common.

I’ll choose “WRITE”.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, U, I. A good starting word should use some of these letters while avoiding duplicates to test as many letters as possible. 

Popular strong starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers S, L, A, T, E - five very common letters in different positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- T is in the word and in the correct 4th position.
- E is in the word and in the correct 5th position.
- S, L, A are NOT in the word.

So far we know the secret word looks like: _ _ _ T E

Letters we can rule out entirely: S, L, A.

We want a word that:
1. Ends in TE (fourth letter T, fifth letter E)
2. Does NOT contain S, L, A
3. Uses new common letters we haven't tried yet

Common letters we haven't tried: R, O, N, I, C, H, U, D, M, P, etc.

Good candidates:
- CRUTE (but U is less common)
- DRUTE (D, R, U, T, E - but T is already known in position 4)
- PRUTE (P, R, U, T, E)
- TRITE (but T is already in position 4, so duplicate T)
- GRITE (G, R, I, T, E)

""CRUTE"" is a valid word meaning a small surgical instrument, but it's less common. ""PRUTE"" is also valid but rarer. ""GRITE"" is valid but G is less common. 

A better choice is ""DRUTE"" - D, R, U, T, E - but I'm not sure if that's the most common word. 

Another approach: use common consonants and vowels we haven't tried yet. 

""CRITE"" is valid but uses I which we haven't tried. 

Actually, ""CRITE"" is valid (archaic plural of critique), but better is ""CRUTE"". 

But let me think of more common words ending in TE with T in 4th position: ""CRATE"", ""GRATE"", ""PRATE"", ""TRATE"" (invalid), ""DRATE"" (invalid), ""FRATE"" (invalid).

""GRATE"" is valid and uses G, R, A, T, E - but A is already ruled out. 

""CRATE"" is valid and uses C, R, A, T, E - but A is ruled out. 

""PRATE"" is valid and uses P, R, A, T, E - but A is ruled out. 

""TRITE"" is invalid because T is already in position 4. 

""FRITE"" is invalid. 

""ORITE"" is valid (a type of rock), uses O, R, I, T, E - but O and I are new letters. 

""ORITE"" seems like a good choice as it introduces O and R while fitting the pattern.

But let me reconsider: we need to maximize new information. 

Letters we've used: S, L, A, T, E
Letters we know nothing about: R, O, N, I, C, H, U, D, M, P, etc.

A better word might be ""CRONE"" but it doesn't fit T in position 4. 

Wait, the pattern is _ _ _ T E, so the word must be 5 letters ending with TE, with T in 4th position. 

Valid words ending with TE with T in 4th position:
- CRUTE
- PRUTE
- ORITE
- GRITE
- DRITE (invalid)
- FRITE (invalid)

Among these, ""ORITE"" is the most common word I can think of. 

But let me think if there's a more common word. 

Another valid word is ""CRATE"" but A is ruled out. 

""GRATE"" has A ruled out. 

""PRATE"" has A ruled out. 

""CRUTE"" is valid but less common. 

""PRUTE"" is valid but rare. 

""ORITE"" seems the best as it introduces O and R. 

But actually, ""TRITE"" is invalid due to duplicate T. 

Another valid word is ""CRITE"" but it's archaic. 

""FRITE"" is invalid. 

""DRI TE"" is invalid. 

So the best valid and common word seems to be ""ORITE"". 

But wait, is ""ORITE"" common? Maybe ""CRUTE"" is better. 

Alternatively, ""GRITE"" is valid but G is less common. 

After reconsidering, ""CRUTE"" is actually a valid and reasonably common word in medical contexts. 

But to maximize common letters, perhaps ""GRIME"" but it doesn't fit the TE ending. 

I think ""ORITE"" is the best choice here as it fits the pattern and introduces new common letters O and R. 

But let me double-check: the pattern is _ _ _ T E, so the word must be 5 letters ending with TE, with T in 4th position. 

Valid words:
- CRUTE
- PRUTE
- ORITE
- GRITE
- DRITE (invalid)
- FRITE (invalid)

Among these, ""CRUTE"" is the most common word I can think of. 

So I'll go with ""CRUTE"".Based on the feedback:
- The word ends with ""TE"" (T in 4th, E in 5th)
- Letters S, L, A are not in the word

I'll try a word that fits this pattern and introduces new common letters.

From the new feedback:

- Pattern so far: _ R _ T E  
  (R is in the 2nd position, T in 4th, E in 5th)

- Letters ruled out again: S, L, A, C, U  
- Letters still allowed and already confirmed: R, T, E  
- New letters we haven’t tested yet: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has R in position 2.
2. Has T in position 4.
3. Has E in position 5.
4. Does not contain S, L, A, C, U.
5. Uses only remaining allowed letters.

Possible skeletons: _ R _ T E

Common letters left to try: N, I, O, D, M, G, H, K, B, F, P, etc.

Let’s brainstorm words fitting _ R _ T E:
- BRIBE → has B twice, but I is allowed; however B is in position 1 and 4, but T is already in 4, so invalid.
- DRITE → I is allowed, D and I are new. ""Drite"" is a valid word (variant of ""dryte"", archaic).
- FRIZE → doesn’t fit pattern.
- GRIME → pattern _ R _ T E: G R I T E → ""GRITE"" — valid word.
- PRIZE → doesn’t fit pattern.
- TRITE → invalid (T already in position 4).
- BRUTE → B, R, U, T, E — but U is ruled out.
- CRATE → C is ruled out.
- GRATE → A is ruled out.
- PRATE → A is ruled out.

""GRITE"" fits all criteria:
- G, R, I, T, E — none of the ruled-out letters (S, L, A, C, U) appear.
- Positions: 1=G, 2=R, 3=I, 4=T, 5=E.

Let’s also quickly check ""BRITE"" — B, R, I, T, E — also fits, but ""GRITE"" uses I and G, both untested.

Both are valid, but ""GRITE"" is more common (short for ""grit and steel"" in some contexts).

I’ll go with ""GRITE"".

- B R O T E → “BROTE” – not a valid word

From the new feedback:

- Pattern locked in: W R _ T E  
  (positions 1=R, 2=R, 4=T, 5=E are confirmed)

- Letters ruled out again: S, L, A, C, U, G, I, plus the already-ruled-out letters from before.

- Letters still allowed and already confirmed: W, R, T, E  
- Letters we have not yet tested that are legal in the blank (position 3):  
  B, D, F, H, K, M, N, O, P, V, Y (and any others not yet ruled out).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with WR
2. Has _ in position 3 (must be one of the allowed letters above)
3. Ends with TE
4. Contains no ruled-out letters.

Valid English words fitting WR?TE:

- WR BTE – invalid  
- WR DTE – invalid  
- WR FTE – invalid  
- WR HTE – invalid  
- WR KTE – invalid  
- WR MTE – invalid  
- WR NTE – invalid  
- WR OTE – invalid  
- WR PTE – invalid  
- WR VTE – invalid  
- WRYTE – invalid (Y is allowed, but WRYTE isn’t a word)

Wait—let’s double-check the dictionary.  
The only common English word that starts with WR and ends with TE is “WRITE”, but I is already ruled out, and W, R, T, E are confirmed.  
However, “WRITE” is actually a valid variant spelling of “write” in some dialects/Scots, and it doesn’t contain any ruled-out letters except I in position 3, which was already ruled out in Guess 4.

Looking deeper, the next candidate is “WRONG” but that doesn’t end with TE.  
Another candidate: “WRATH” – ends with TH, not TE.  
“WRAP” – wrong length and ending.  
“WRIGE” – invalid.  
“WRINE” – invalid.  
“WRITH” – ends with TH.  
“WRONG” – already noted.

In fact, the only remaining valid 5-letter word that starts with WR and ends with TE is “WRITE”, but I is already ruled out.  
This suggests we need to check if there are any other words we might have missed.

Upon re-examining, the word “WRITE” is indeed the only valid candidate fitting WR _ TE.  
Since I is ruled out, and all other letters in position 3 are either ruled out or don’t form a valid word, the only remaining possibility is:

- WR O T E – but “WROTE” is an archaic spelling of “wrote”, and O has not been ruled out yet.

Let’s verify “WROTE”:
- Letters: W, R, O, T, E – none of the ruled-out letters appear.  
- It fits the pattern WR O TE.  
- It is a valid English word, albeit archaic.

Therefore, the correct next guess is “WROTE”.
