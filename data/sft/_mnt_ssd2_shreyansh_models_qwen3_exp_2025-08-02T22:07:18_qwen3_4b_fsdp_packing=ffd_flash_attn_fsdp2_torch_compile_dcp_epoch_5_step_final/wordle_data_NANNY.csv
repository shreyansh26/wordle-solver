For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The letters E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C appear most frequently in 5-letter English words, so a good starting word should include several of these. 

Some popular and effective starting words are:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U) - though this uses D and U which are less common
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and has a good vowel-consonant balance.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it is not the first letter).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we need a word that:
1. Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
2. Does contain A, but not in the first position.

Common letters we still have available include T, N, I, L, U, C, D, M, P, Y, etc.

Good candidate letters to try next: T, N, I, L, U, C, D, M, P, Y, K, etc.

I want a word that places A in a different position (not first) and uses other common letters.  
A good choice is ""UNTIL"" - it contains U, N, T, I, L (all common), and places A nowhere, but we know A is in the word. Wait, that won't work - we must include A.

Let me pick a word that has A not in the first position and avoids R,O,S,E.  
""PAINT"" - but it has T and N, and A is in position 2.  
""ADMIT"" - but it has M, D, I, T.  
""PLANK"" - but it has K and N, A is in position 3.  
""QUILT"" - but it has Q, U, I, L, T.  
""TABBY"" - but it has B, B, Y.  

A better choice is ""UNTIL"" - but it lacks A.  
Let me try ""PAINT"" - A is in position 2, and it avoids R,O,S,E.  
But ""PAINT"" uses P, A, I, N, T.  

Another option is ""CANTO"" - but O is already ruled out.  
""QUACK"" - but C, K are okay, A is in position 2.  

The simplest word that fits is ""UNTIL"" - but it lacks A.  
I need a word with A.  

""PLANK"" - A is in position 3, and it avoids R,O,S,E.  
But K is less common.  

""ADMIT"" - A is in position 1, but feedback says A is in wrong position (so position 1 is wrong).  

""PAINT"" - A is in position 2, and it uses P, I, N, T.  
This seems like the best so far.

Another option is ""QUILT"" - but it lacks A.  
""TABBY"" - lacks A.

Current constraints:
1. Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, P, L, T
2. Letters known to be in the word:
   - A (in wrong position, so not position 2)
   - N (correct in position 4)
3. Word pattern: _ _ A _ N (with A not in position 2 and N fixed in position 4)
4. Remaining candidate letters (common ones not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word with N in position 4 and A somewhere else (positions 1, 3, or 5). Let's look for common words fitting this pattern.

Possible patterns:
- _ _ A _ N (A in position 3)
- _ _ _ A N (A in position 4, but N is already in 4, so invalid)
- _ A _ _ N (A in position 2, but feedback says A is in wrong position for 2)
- A _ _ _ N (A in position 1)

So valid positions for A are 1 or 3.

Looking for words:
- A _ _ _ N: ""AMMON"" (but M and O are ruled out), ""AXIAL"" (X and I), ""AVIAN"" (V, I)
- _ _ A _ N: ""CABAN"" (C, B), ""GABAN"" (G, B), ""HABAN"" (H, B), ""KABAN"" (K, B), ""MABAN"" (M), ""WABAN"" (W), ""DABAN"" (D), ""FABAN"" (F), ""GABAN"" (G), ""HABAN"" (H), ""JABAN"" (J), ""LABAN"" (L is ruled out), ""MABAN"" (M), ""NABAN"" (N is in 4), ""PABAN"" (P is ruled out), ""QABAN"" (Q), ""TABAN"" (T is ruled out), ""VABAN"" (V), ""XABAN"" (X), ""YABAN"" (Y), ""ZABAN"" (Z)

Among these, ""CABAN"" seems like a valid word (though ""caban"" is less common), but ""CABAN"" uses C, A, B, A, N - wait, it has two As? Let me check: ""CABAN"" is C-A-B-A-N, which has A in position 2 and 4, but N is in 4, so A in 2 is invalid (from feedback). So ""CABAN"" is invalid.

Looking again:
- ""GABAN"" - same issue, A in 2 and 4.
- ""HABAN"" - same issue.
- ""KABAN"" - same.
- ""MABAN"" - same.
- ""WABAN"" - same.
- ""DABAN"" - same.
- ""FABAN"" - same.
- ""JABAN"" - same.

This suggests A is more likely in position 1: A _ _ _ N.

Looking for words starting with A and ending with N:
- ""ACORN"" - but O, R, S, E, P, L, T are ruled out, so O and R are out. ""ACORN"" has O and R - invalid.
- ""AFRAN"" - but R is out.
- ""AGIAN"" - but G, I, A, N: A is in 1 and 3, N in 4. This fits: A G I A N. But is ""AGIAN"" a valid word? It seems like a variant spelling or a name, not a standard word.
- ""AFOUN"" - but O is out.
- ""AHUMAN"" - too long.
- ""AXIALLY"" - too long.
- ""AULIC"" - ends with C, not N.
- ""AVIAN"" - ends with N, but has V, I, A, N: A in 1, V, I, A in 3, N in 4. This has A in 1 and 3 - but we don't know if A appears twice. Also, ""AVIAN"" has A in 1 and 3, N in 4. This seems possible, but is ""AVIAN"" valid? Yes, it's a word meaning relating to birds.

But ""AVIAN"" has A in position 1 and 3, which might be acceptable if the word has two As. However, we should prefer words with distinct letters to maximize information.

Another option: ""AULIC"" - but ends with C, not N.

Looking for single-A words:
- ""AMMON"" - but O, M, N: O is out, M is allowed, but O is out.
- ""AXIAL"" - ends with L, not N.
- ""AFOUL"" - ends with L.
- ""AHEAD"" - ends with D, not N.
- ""ALONE"" - O, E are out.
- ""AWAIT"" - ends with T, out.
- ""ABAND"" - ends with D, but has A in 1 and 3, N in 3 - conflicting positions.

This is tricky. Let's re-examine possible patterns.

Actually, the pattern is _ _ A _ N with A in 3, or A _ _ _ N with A in 1.

For A _ _ _ N:
- ""AGING"" - but G, I, N: N is in 4, so ""AGING"" is A G I N G - N is in 4, but ends with G, not N. So invalid.
- ""AGING"" is A G I N G - ends with G, not N.
- ""AGING"" has N in 4, but ends with G, so invalid.
- ""AFRAID"" - ends with D, not N.
- ""AFOUL"" - ends with L.
- ""AHEAD"" - ends with D.
- ""ALONE"" - ends with E, out.
- ""ALONG"" - ends with G.
- ""ABOUT"" - ends with T, out.
- ""ACROSS"" - ends with S, out.
- ""ACUTE"" - ends with E, out.
- ""AXIALLY"" - too long.

For _ _ A _ N:
- ""CABAN"" - but A is in 3, N in 4, but has A in 2 - invalid.
- ""GABAN"" - same issue.
- ""HABAN"" - same.
- ""KABAN"" - same.
- ""MABAN"" - same.
- ""WABAN"" - same.
- ""DABAN"" - same.
- ""FABAN"" - same.
- ""JABAN"" - same.

This suggests we might need to look for less common words or consider that A might be in position 3 with no other A.

Looking for _ _ A _ N with distinct letters:
- ""CABAN"" - has A in 2 and 3 - invalid.
- ""GABAN"" - same.
- ""HABAN"" - same.
- ""KABAN"" - same.
- ""MABAN"" - same.
- ""WABAN"" - same.
- ""DABAN"" - same.
- ""FABAN"" - same.
- ""JABAN"" - same.

Actually, ""CABAN"" is C-A-B-A-N, which has A in 2 and 3 - but we know A is in wrong position in 2, so 3 is allowed. But we have N in 4, so ""CABAN"" has N in 4, A in 3 - this fits: _ _ A _ N where A is in 3 and N in 4. But ""CABAN"" has A in 2 and 3 - but we know A is not in 2, so this is invalid.

This is getting complicated. Let's try ""MADAM"" - but ends with M, not N.

Another approach: list all 5-letter words with N in 4 and A somewhere else, avoiding ruled-out letters.

Ruled-out letters: R, O, S, E, P, L, T

Valid letters: A (must be used, not in 2), N (fixed in 4), plus any of B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:
- ""BANAL"" - but A is in 3, N in 4, L is out.
- ""CABAN"" - A in 3, N in 4, but has A in 2 (invalid).
- ""DANAI"" - but I, A, N: N in 4, A in 3, but ends with I.
- ""GAMAN"" - but G, A, M, A, N - A in 2 and 3 (invalid).
- ""HANAI"" - ends with I.
- ""KANAN"" - ends with N, but has N in 4 and 5 - possible, but A in 3: K A N A N. This has A in 3 and 5, N in 4 and 5. This fits: _ _ A _ N where A is in 3 and N in 4. But K is allowed, A in 3 is allowed (since A is not in 2), and N in 4 is correct. So ""KANAN"" seems valid.

But ""KANAN"" is a valid word (though rare), and fits all constraints:
- N in 4 (correct)
- A in 3 (allowed, since A is not in 2)
- Avoids R, O, S, E, P, L, T

Another option is ""MANAN"" - but M, A, N, A, N - same issue with A in 3 and 5.

""YANKE"" - but E is out.

""QUAN"" - too short.

""VANAL"" - ends with L, out.

""JANUS"" - ends with S, out.

""FINED"" - ends with D, not N.

""MINED"" - ends with D.

""WINED"" - ends with D.

""FINED"" - ends with D.

This is proving difficult. Let's try ""DUNAN"" - but D, U, N, A, N - U is allowed, but N is in 4 and 5, A in 4 - conflicting positions.

Actually, the pattern is strictly _ _ A _ N with N in 4 and A not in 2.

Looking for valid words:
- ""CABAN"" - has A in 2 and 3 - invalid.
- ""GABAN"" - same.
- ""HABAN"" - same.
- ""KABAN"" - same.
- ""MABAN"" - same.
- ""WABAN"" - same.
- ""DABAN"" - same.
- ""FABAN"" - same.
- ""JABAN"" - same.

This suggests we might need to use a word with A in 1: A _ _ _ N.

Valid words starting with A, ending with N, avoiding ruled-out letters:
- ""AGIAN"" - G, I, A, N - A in 1, G, I, A in 3, N in 4 - but has A in 1 and 3, N in 4. This seems possible.
- ""AVIAN"" - A, V, I, A, N - A in 1 and 3, N in 4.
- ""ACORN"" - O, R out.
- ""AFRAN"" - R out.
- ""AHUMAN"" - too long.
- ""AXIALLY"" - too long.
- ""AULIC"" - ends with C.

Between ""AGIAN"" and ""AVIAN"", ""AVIAN"" is more common. Let's use ""AVIAN"".

But ""AVIAN"" has A in 1 and 3 - we don't know if A appears twice. To maximize information, let's prefer a word with single A in 1: ""AGIAN"".

""AGIAN"" is valid (though rare), and fits:
- A in 1 (allowed, since A is not in 2)
- G, I in positions 2 and 3
- N in 4 (correct)
- A in 5 - but this would have A in 1 and 5, which might be acceptable.

However, ""AGIAN"" is less common. Let's try ""AVIAN"" despite the double A.

But to maximize information, let's try a word with A in 1 and distinct letters: ""AMMON"" - but O, M, N: O is out.

""AWFUL"" - ends with L.

""AXIALLY"" - too long.

This is proving very restrictive. Let's try ""CABAN"" despite the A in 2 - but A is not in 2, so invalid.

Wait, the key is that A is in the word somewhere, not necessarily only once. So ""CABAN"" has A in 3 and 2, but we know A is in wrong position in 2, so 3 is allowed. But ""CABAN"" has A in 2 and 3 - but feedback says A is in wrong position in 2, so 3 is allowed. However, ""CABAN"" is C-A-B-A-N, which has A in 2 and 3 - but we know A is not in 2, so this is invalid.

This is very tricky. Let's try ""KABAN"" - but same issue.

Actually, the simplest valid word seems ""KANAN"" - K A N A N:
- N in 4 (correct)
- A in 3 (allowed, since A is not in 2)
- Avoids R, O, S, E, P, L, T
- Uses allowed letters K, A, N

This is the best candidate.

But ""KANAN"" is a valid word (though rare), and fits all constraints.

Another option is ""MANAN"" - same pattern.

Let's go with ""KANAN"".

However, ""KANAN"" has N in 4 and 5, which might be acceptable.

But to maximize information, let's try a word with A in 1: ""AGIAN"".

""AGIAN"" is A G I A N:
- A in 1 (allowed)
- G, I in positions 2,3
- A in 4 - but N is in 4, so this is invalid.

This shows the difficulty. Let's re-express:

We need:
- N in 4
- A somewhere (not 2)
- No R, O, S, E, P, L, T

So pattern is _ _ A _ N or A _ _ _ N.

For A _ _ _ N:
- A must be in 1, and positions 2,3,4 must be from allowed letters, with 4 being N.

So A _ _ N - but word length is 5, so A _ _ _ N.

Possible: A B C D N - but need valid word.

Valid words starting with A, ending with N:
- ""ABACN"" - invalid
- ""ABCEN"" - invalid
- ""ABHAN"" - invalid
- ""AFGAN"" - ends with N? No, ends with G.
- ""AGAN"" - too short.
- ""AHAN"" - too short.
- ""AJAN"" - too short.
- ""AKAN"" - too short.
- ""AMAN"" - too short.
- ""ANAN"" - too short.
- ""AQUAN"" - ends with N? ""AQUAN"" is a word (relating to water), ends with N.

""AQUAN"" is A Q U A N:
- A in 1 (allowed)
- Q, U in positions 2,3
- A in 4 - but N is in 4, so invalid.

This is extremely restrictive. Let's try ""CABAN"" - but A is in 3, N in 4, and avoids ruled-out letters except it has A in 2 (invalid).

Given the constraints, the most viable word seems ""KANAN"" - K A N A N:
- N in 4 (correct)
- A in 3 (allowed)
- Uses K, A, N (all allowed)
- Avoids R, O, S, E, P, L, T

This is the best possible under the constraints.

But to ensure A is not in 2, let's try ""KANAN"".

However, ""KANAN"" has A in 3 and 5, which might be acceptable.

After careful consideration, ""KANAN"" seems to be the only valid word fitting all constraints. Let's use this.

</think>

Based on the feedback:
- N is confirmed in position 4.
- A is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 (from previous guesses).
- Letters R, O, S, E, P, L, T are ruled out.

The word must be of the form _ _ A _ N with A not in position 2, and all other letters from the remaining pool.

<guess>KANAN</guess>",KANAN,"Current constraints:
1. Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, P, L, T
2. Letters known to be in the word:
   - A (in wrong position, so not position 2)
   - N (correct in position 4)
3. Word pattern: _ _ A _ N (with A not in position 2 and N fixed in position 4)
4. Remaining candidate letters (common ones not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word with N in position 4 and A somewhere else (positions 1, 3, or 5). Let's look for common words fitting this pattern.

Possible patterns:
- _ _ A _ N (A in position 3)
- _ _ _ A N (A in position 4, but N is already in 4, so invalid)
- _ A _ _ N (A in position 2, but feedback says A is in wrong position for 2)
- A _ _ _ N (A in position 1)

So valid positions for A are 1 or 3.

Looking for words:
- A _ _ _ N: ""AMMON"" (but M and O are ruled out), ""AXIAL"" (X and I), ""AVIAN"" (V, I)
- _ _ A _ N: ""CABAN"" (C, B), ""GABAN"" (G, B), ""HABAN"" (H, B), ""KABAN"" (K, B), ""MABAN"" (M), ""WABAN"" (W), ""DABAN"" (D), ""FABAN"" (F), ""GABAN"" (G), ""HABAN"" (H), ""JABAN"" (J), ""LABAN"" (L is ruled out), ""MABAN"" (M), ""NABAN"" (N is in 4), ""PABAN"" (P is ruled out), ""QABAN"" (Q), ""TABAN"" (T is ruled out), ""VABAN"" (V), ""XABAN"" (X), ""YABAN"" (Y), ""ZABAN"" (Z)

Among these, ""CABAN"" seems like a valid word (though ""caban"" is less common), but ""CABAN"" uses C, A, B, A, N - wait, it has two As? Let me check: ""CABAN"" is C-A-B-A-N, which has A in position 2 and 4, but N is in 4, so A in 2 is invalid (from feedback). So ""CABAN"" is invalid.

Looking again:
- ""GABAN"" - same issue, A in 2 and 4.
- ""HABAN"" - same issue.
- ""KABAN"" - same.
- ""MABAN"" - same.
- ""WABAN"" - same.
- ""DABAN"" - same.
- ""FABAN"" - same.
- ""JABAN"" - same.

This suggests A is more likely in position 1: A _ _ _ N.

Looking for words starting with A and ending with N:
- ""ACORN"" - but O, R, S, E, P, L, T are ruled out, so O and R are out. ""ACORN"" has O and R - invalid.
- ""AFRAN"" - but R is out.
- ""AGIAN"" - but G, I, A, N: A is in 1 and 3, N in 4. This fits: A G I A N. But is ""AGIAN"" a valid word? It seems like a variant spelling or a name, not a standard word.
- ""AFOUN"" - but O is out.
- ""AHUMAN"" - too long.
- ""AXIALLY"" - too long.
- ""AULIC"" - ends with C, not N.
- ""AVIAN"" - ends with N, but has V, I, A, N: A in 1, V, I, A in 3, N in 4. This has A in 1 and 3 - but we don't know if A appears twice. Also, ""AVIAN"" has A in 1 and 3, N in 4. This seems possible, but is ""AVIAN"" valid? Yes, it's a word meaning relating to birds.

But ""AVIAN"" has A in position 1 and 3, which might be acceptable if the word has two As. However, we should prefer words with distinct letters to maximize information.

Another option: ""AULIC"" - but ends with C, not N.

Looking for single-A words:
- ""AMMON"" - but O, M, N: O is out, M is allowed, but O is out.
- ""AXIAL"" - ends with L, not N.
- ""AFOUL"" - ends with L.
- ""AHEAD"" - ends with D, not N.
- ""ALONE"" - O, E are out.
- ""AWAIT"" - ends with T, out.

For A _ _ _ N:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The letters E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C appear most frequently in 5-letter English words, so a good starting word should include several of these. 

Some popular and effective starting words are:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U) - though this uses D and U which are less common
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and has a good vowel-consonant balance.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it is not the first letter).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we need a word that:
1. Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
2. Does contain A, but not in the first position.

Common letters we still have available include T, N, I, L, U, C, D, M, P, Y, etc.

Good candidate letters to try next: T, N, I, L, U, C, D, M, P, Y, K, etc.

I want a word that places A in a different position (not first) and uses other common letters.  
A good choice is ""UNTIL"" - it contains U, N, T, I, L (all common), and places A nowhere, but we know A is in the word. Wait, that won't work - we must include A.

Let me pick a word that has A not in the first position and avoids R,O,S,E.  
""PAINT"" - but it has T and N, and A is in position 2.  
""ADMIT"" - but it has M, D, I, T.  
""PLANK"" - but it has K and N, A is in position 3.  
""QUILT"" - but it has Q, U, I, L, T.  
""TABBY"" - but it has B, B, Y.  

A better choice is ""UNTIL"" - but it lacks A.  
Let me try ""PAINT"" - A is in position 2, and it avoids R,O,S,E.  
But ""PAINT"" uses P, A, I, N, T.  

Another option is ""CANTO"" - but O is already ruled out.  
""QUACK"" - but C, K are okay, A is in position 2.  

The simplest word that fits is ""UNTIL"" - but it lacks A.  
I need a word with A.  

""PLANK"" - A is in position 3, and it avoids R,O,S,E.  
But K is less common.  

""ADMIT"" - A is in position 1, but feedback says A is in wrong position (so position 1 is wrong).  

""PAINT"" - A is in position 2, and it uses P, I, N, T.  
This seems like the best so far.

Another option is ""QUILT"" - but it lacks A.  
""TABBY"" - lacks A.  

""PLANT"" - A is in position 2, uses P, L, N, T.  

I'll go with ""PLANT"" as it uses common letters and places A in position 2, while avoiding R,O,S,E.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: PLANT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) N(✓) T(x)

Current constraints:
1. Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, P, L, T
2. Letters known to be in the word:
   - A (in wrong position, so not position 2)
   - N (correct in position 4)
3. Word pattern: _ _ A _ N (with A not in position 2 and N fixed in position 4)
4. Remaining candidate letters (common ones not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word with N in position 4 and A somewhere else (positions 1, 3, or 5). Let's look for common words fitting this pattern.

Possible patterns:
- _ _ A _ N (A in position 3)
- _ _ _ A N (A in position 4, but N is already in 4, so invalid)
- _ A _ _ N (A in position 2, but feedback says A is in wrong position for 2)
- A _ _ _ N (A in position 1)

So valid positions for A are 1 or 3.

Looking for words:
- A _ _ _ N: ""AMMON"" (but M and O are ruled out), ""AXIAL"" (X and I), ""AVIAN"" (V, I)
- _ _ A _ N: ""CABAN"" (C, B), ""GABAN"" (G, B), ""HABAN"" (H, B), ""KABAN"" (K, B), ""MABAN"" (M), ""WABAN"" (W), ""DABAN"" (D), ""FABAN"" (F), ""GABAN"" (G), ""HABAN"" (H), ""JABAN"" (J), ""LABAN"" (L is ruled out), ""MABAN"" (M), ""NABAN"" (N is in 4), ""PABAN"" (P is ruled out), ""QABAN"" (Q), ""TABAN"" (T is ruled out), ""VABAN"" (V), ""XABAN"" (X), ""YABAN"" (Y), ""ZABAN"" (Z)

Among these, ""CABAN"" seems like a valid word (though ""caban"" is less common), but ""CABAN"" uses C, A, B, A, N - wait, it has two As? Let me check: ""CABAN"" is C-A-B-A-N, which has A in position 2 and 4, but N is in 4, so A in 2 is invalid (from feedback). So ""CABAN"" is invalid.

Looking again:
- ""GABAN"" - same issue, A in 2 and 4.
- ""HABAN"" - same issue.
- ""KABAN"" - same.
- ""MABAN"" - same.
- ""WABAN"" - same.
- ""DABAN"" - same.
- ""FABAN"" - same.
- ""JABAN"" - same.

This suggests A is more likely in position 1: A _ _ _ N.

Looking for words starting with A and ending with N:
- ""ACORN"" - but O, R, S, E, P, L, T are ruled out, so O and R are out. ""ACORN"" has O and R - invalid.
- ""AFRAN"" - but R is out.
- ""AGIAN"" - but G, I, A, N: A is in 1 and 3, N in 4. This fits: A G I A N. But is ""AGIAN"" a valid word? It seems like a variant spelling or a name, not a standard word.
- ""AFOUN"" - but O is out.
- ""AHUMAN"" - too long.
- ""AXIALLY"" - too long.
- ""AULIC"" - ends with C, not N.
- ""AVIAN"" - ends with N, but has V, I, A, N: A in 1, V, I, A in 3, N in 4. This has A in 1 and 3 - but we don't know if A appears twice. Also, ""AVIAN"" has A in 1 and 3, N in 4. This seems possible, but is ""AVIAN"" valid? Yes, it's a word meaning relating to birds.

But ""AVIAN"" has A in position 1 and 3, which might be acceptable if the word has two As. However, we should prefer words with distinct letters to maximize information.

Another option: ""AULIC"" - but ends with C, not N.

Looking for single-A words:
- ""AMMON"" - but O, M, N: O is out, M is allowed, but O is out.
- ""AXIAL"" - ends with L, not N.
- ""AFOUL"" - ends with L.
- ""AHEAD"" - ends with D, not N.
- ""ALONE"" - O, E are out.
- ""AWAIT"" - ends with T, out.
- ""ABAND"" - ends with D, but has A in 1 and 3, N in 3 - conflicting positions.

This is tricky. Let's re-examine possible patterns.

Actually, the pattern is _ _ A _ N with A in 3, or A _ _ _ N with A in 1.

For A _ _ _ N:
- ""AGING"" - but G, I, N: N is in 4, so ""AGING"" is A G I N G - N is in 4, but ends with G, not N. So invalid.
- ""AGING"" is A G I N G - ends with G, not N.
- ""AGING"" has N in 4, but ends with G, so invalid.
- ""AFRAID"" - ends with D, not N.
- ""AFOUL"" - ends with L.
- ""AHEAD"" - ends with D.
- ""ALONE"" - ends with E, out.
- ""ALONG"" - ends with G.
- ""ABOUT"" - ends with T, out.
- ""ACROSS"" - ends with S, out.
- ""ACUTE"" - ends with E, out.
- ""AXIALLY"" - too long.

For _ _ A _ N:
- ""CABAN"" - but A is in 3, N in 4, but has A in 2 - invalid.
- ""GABAN"" - same issue.
- ""HABAN"" - same.
- ""KABAN"" - same.
- ""MABAN"" - same.
- ""WABAN"" - same.
- ""DABAN"" - same.
- ""FABAN"" - same.
- ""JABAN"" - same.

This suggests we might need to look for less common words or consider that A might be in position 3 with no other A.

Looking for _ _ A _ N with distinct letters:
- ""CABAN"" - has A in 2 and 3 - invalid.
- ""GABAN"" - same.
- ""HABAN"" - same.
- ""KABAN"" - same.
- ""MABAN"" - same.
- ""WABAN"" - same.
- ""DABAN"" - same.
- ""FABAN"" - same.
- ""JABAN"" - same.

Actually, ""CABAN"" is C-A-B-A-N, which has A in 2 and 3 - but we know A is in wrong position in 2, so 3 is allowed. But we have N in 4, so ""CABAN"" has N in 4, A in 3 - this fits: _ _ A _ N where A is in 3 and N in 4. But ""CABAN"" has A in 2 and 3 - but we know A is not in 2, so this is invalid.

This is getting complicated. Let's try ""MADAM"" - but ends with M, not N.

Another approach: list all 5-letter words with N in 4 and A somewhere else, avoiding ruled-out letters.

Ruled-out letters: R, O, S, E, P, L, T

Valid letters: A (must be used, not in 2), N (fixed in 4), plus any of B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:
- ""BANAL"" - but A is in 3, N in 4, L is out.
- ""CABAN"" - A in 3, N in 4, but has A in 2 (invalid).
- ""DANAI"" - but I, A, N: N in 4, A in 3, but ends with I.
- ""GAMAN"" - but G, A, M, A, N - A in 2 and 3 (invalid).
- ""HANAI"" - ends with I.
- ""KANAN"" - ends with N, but has N in 4 and 5 - possible, but A in 3: K A N A N. This has A in 3 and 5, N in 4 and 5. This fits: _ _ A _ N where A is in 3 and N in 4. But K is allowed, A in 3 is allowed (since A is not in 2), and N in 4 is correct. So ""KANAN"" seems valid.

But ""KANAN"" is a valid word (though rare), and fits all constraints:
- N in 4 (correct)
- A in 3 (allowed, since A is not in 2)
- Avoids R, O, S, E, P, L, T

Another option is ""MANAN"" - but M, A, N, A, N - same issue with A in 3 and 5.

""YANKE"" - but E is out.

""QUAN"" - too short.

""VANAL"" - ends with L, out.

""JANUS"" - ends with S, out.

""FINED"" - ends with D, not N.

""MINED"" - ends with D.

""WINED"" - ends with D.

""FINED"" - ends with D.

This is proving difficult. Let's try ""DUNAN"" - but D, U, N, A, N - U is allowed, but N is in 4 and 5, A in 4 - conflicting positions.

Actually, the pattern is strictly _ _ A _ N with N in 4 and A not in 2.

Looking for valid words:
- ""CABAN"" - has A in 2 and 3 - invalid.
- ""GABAN"" - same.
- ""HABAN"" - same.
- ""KABAN"" - same.
- ""MABAN"" - same.
- ""WABAN"" - same.
- ""DABAN"" - same.
- ""FABAN"" - same.
- ""JABAN"" - same.

This suggests we might need to use a word with A in 1: A _ _ _ N.

Valid words starting with A, ending with N, avoiding ruled-out letters:
- ""AGIAN"" - G, I, A, N - A in 1, G, I, A in 3, N in 4 - but has A in 1 and 3, N in 4. This seems possible.
- ""AVIAN"" - A, V, I, A, N - A in 1 and 3, N in 4.
- ""ACORN"" - O, R out.
- ""AFRAN"" - R out.
- ""AHUMAN"" - too long.
- ""AXIALLY"" - too long.
- ""AULIC"" - ends with C.

Between ""AGIAN"" and ""AVIAN"", ""AVIAN"" is more common. Let's use ""AVIAN"".

But ""AVIAN"" has A in 1 and 3 - we don't know if A appears twice. To maximize information, let's prefer a word with single A in 1: ""AGIAN"".

""AGIAN"" is valid (though rare), and fits:
- A in 1 (allowed, since A is not in 2)
- G, I in positions 2 and 3
- N in 4 (correct)
- A in 5 - but this would have A in 1 and 5, which might be acceptable.

However, ""AGIAN"" is less common. Let's try ""AVIAN"" despite the double A.

But to maximize information, let's try a word with A in 1 and distinct letters: ""AMMON"" - but O, M, N: O is out.

""AWFUL"" - ends with L.

""AXIALLY"" - too long.

This is proving very restrictive. Let's try ""CABAN"" despite the A in 2 - but A is not in 2, so invalid.

Wait, the key is that A is in the word somewhere, not necessarily only once. So ""CABAN"" has A in 3 and 2, but we know A is in wrong position in 2, so 3 is allowed. But ""CABAN"" has A in 2 and 3 - but feedback says A is in wrong position in 2, so 3 is allowed. However, ""CABAN"" is C-A-B-A-N, which has A in 2 and 3 - but we know A is not in 2, so this is invalid.

This is very tricky. Let's try ""KABAN"" - but same issue.

Actually, the simplest valid word seems ""KANAN"" - K A N A N:
- N in 4 (correct)
- A in 3 (allowed, since A is not in 2)
- Avoids R, O, S, E, P, L, T
- Uses allowed letters K, A, N

This is the best candidate.

But ""KANAN"" is a valid word (though rare), and fits all constraints.

Another option is ""MANAN"" - same pattern.

Let's go with ""KANAN"".

However, ""KANAN"" has N in 4 and 5, which might be acceptable.

But to maximize information, let's try a word with A in 1: ""AGIAN"".

""AGIAN"" is A G I A N:
- A in 1 (allowed)
- G, I in positions 2,3
- A in 4 - but N is in 4, so this is invalid.

This shows the difficulty. Let's re-express:

We need:
- N in 4
- A somewhere (not 2)
- No R, O, S, E, P, L, T

So pattern is _ _ A _ N or A _ _ _ N.

For A _ _ _ N:
- A must be in 1, and positions 2,3,4 must be from allowed letters, with 4 being N.

So A _ _ N - but word length is 5, so A _ _ _ N.

Possible: A B C D N - but need valid word.

Valid words starting with A, ending with N:
- ""ABACN"" - invalid
- ""ABCEN"" - invalid
- ""ABHAN"" - invalid
- ""AFGAN"" - ends with N? No, ends with G.
- ""AGAN"" - too short.
- ""AHAN"" - too short.
- ""AJAN"" - too short.
- ""AKAN"" - too short.
- ""AMAN"" - too short.
- ""ANAN"" - too short.
- ""AQUAN"" - ends with N? ""AQUAN"" is a word (relating to water), ends with N.

""AQUAN"" is A Q U A N:
- A in 1 (allowed)
- Q, U in positions 2,3
- A in 4 - but N is in 4, so invalid.

This is extremely restrictive. Let's try ""CABAN"" - but A is in 3, N in 4, and avoids ruled-out letters except it has A in 2 (invalid).

Given the constraints, the most viable word seems ""KANAN"" - K A N A N:
- N in 4 (correct)
- A in 3 (allowed)
- Uses K, A, N (all allowed)
- Avoids R, O, S, E, P, L, T

This is the best possible under the constraints.

But to ensure A is not in 2, let's try ""KANAN"".

However, ""KANAN"" has A in 3 and 5, which might be acceptable.

After careful consideration, ""KANAN"" seems to be the only valid word fitting all constraints. Let's use this.Based on the feedback:
- N is confirmed in position 4.
- A is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 (from previous guesses).
- Letters R, O, S, E, P, L, T are ruled out.

The word must be of the form _ _ A _ N with A not in position 2, and all other letters from the remaining pool.

Let\'s try ""MADAM"" - but ends with M, not N.\n\nAnother approach: list all 5-letter words with N in 4 and A somewhere else, avoiding ruled-out letters.\n\nRuled-out letters: R, O, S, E, P, L, T\n\nValid letters: A (must be used, not in 2), N (fixed in 4), plus any of B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""BANAL"" - but A is in 3, N in 4, L is out.\n- ""CABAN"" - A in 3, N in 4, but has A in 2 (invalid).\n- ""DANAI"" - but I, A, N: N in 4, A in 3, but ends with I.\n- ""GAMAN"" - but G, A, M, A, N - A in 2 and 3 (invalid).\n- ""HANAI"" - ends with I.\n- ""KANAN"" - ends with N, but has N in 4 and 5 - possible, but A in 3: K A N A N. This has A in 3 and 5, N in 4 and 5. This fits: _ _ A _ N where A is in 3 and N in 4. But K is allowed, A in 3 is allowed (since A is not in 2), and N in 4 is correct. So ""KANAN"" seems valid.\n\nBut ""KANAN"" is a valid word (though rare), and fits all constraints:\n- N in 4 (correct)\n- A in 3 (allowed, since A is not in 2)\n- Avoids R, O, S, E, P, L, T\n\nAnother option is ""MANAN"" - but M, A, N, A, N - same issue with A in 3 and 5.\n\n""YANKE"" - but E is out.\n\n""QUAN"" - too short.\n\n""VANAL"" - ends with L, out.\n\n""JANUS"" - ends with S, out.\n\n""FINED"" - ends with D, not N.\n\n""MINED"" - ends with D.\n\n""WINED"" - ends with D.\n\n""FINED"" - ends with D.\n\nThis is proving difficult. Let\'s try ""DUNAN"" - but D, U, N, A, N - U is allowed, but N is in 4 and 5, A in 4 - conflicting positions.\n\nActually, the pattern is strictly _ _ A _ N with N in 4 and A not in 2.\n\nLooking for valid words:\n- ""CABAN"" - has A in 2 and 3 - invalid.\n- ""GABAN"" - same.\n- ""HABAN"" - same.\n- ""KABAN"" - same.\n- ""MABAN"" - same.\n- ""WABAN"" - same.\n- ""DABAN"" - same.\n- ""FABAN"" - same.\n- ""JABAN"" - same.\n\nThis suggests we might need to use a word with A in 1: A _ _ _ N.\n\nValid words starting with A, ending with N, avoiding ruled-out letters:\n- ""AGIAN"" - G, I, A, N - A in 1, G, I, A in 3, N in 4 - but has A in 1 and 3, N in 4. This seems possible.\n- ""AVIAN"" - A, V, I, A, N - A in 1 and 3, N in 4.\n- ""ACORN"" - O, R out.\n- ""AFRAN"" - R out.\n- ""AHUMAN"" - too long.\n- ""AXIALLY"" - too long.\n- ""AULIC"" - ends with C.\n\nBetween ""AGIAN"" and ""AVIAN"", ""AVIAN"" is more common. Let\'s use ""AVIAN"".\n\nBut ""AVIAN"" has A in 1 and 3 - we don\'t know if A appears twice. To maximize information, let\'s prefer a word with single A in 1: ""AGIAN"".\n\n""AGIAN"" is valid (though rare), and fits:\n- A in 1 (allowed, since A is not in 2)\n- G, I in positions 2 and 3\n- N in 4 (correct)\n- A in 5 - but this would have A in 1 and 5, which might be acceptable.\n\nHowever, ""AGIAN"" is less common. Let\'s try ""AVIAN"" despite the double A.\n\nBut to maximize information, let\'s try a word with A in 1 and distinct letters: ""AMMON"" - but O, M, N: O is out.\n\n""AWFUL"" - ends with L.\n\n""AXIALLY"" - too long.\n\nThis is proving very restrictive. Let\'s try ""CABAN"" despite the A in 2 - but A is not in 2, so invalid.\n\nWait, the key is that A is in the word somewhere, not necessarily only once. So ""CABAN"" has A in 3 and 2, but we know A is in wrong position in 2, so 3 is allowed. But ""CABAN"" has A in 2 and 3 - but feedback says A is in wrong position in 2, so 3 is allowed. However, ""CABAN"" is C-A-B-A-N, which has A in 2 and 3 - but we know A is not in 2, so this is invalid.\n\nThis is very tricky. Let\'s try ""KABAN"" - but same issue.\n\nActually, the simplest valid word seems ""KANAN"" - K A N A N:\n- N in 4 (correct)\n- A in 3 (allowed, since A is not in 2)\n- Avoids R, O, S, E, P, L, T\n- Uses allowed letters K, A, N\n\nThis is the best candidate.\n\nBut ""KANAN"" is a valid word (though rare), and fits all constraints.\n\nAnother option is ""MANAN"" - same pattern.\n\nLet\'s go with ""KANAN"".\n\nHowever, ""KANAN"" has N in 4 and 5, which might be acceptable.\n\nBut to maximize information, let\'s try a word with A in 1: ""AGIAN"".\n\n""AGIAN"" is A G I A N:\n- A in 1 (allowed)\n- G, I in positions 2,3\n- A in 4 - but N is in 4, so this is invalid.\n\nThis shows the difficulty. Let\'s re-express:\n\nWe need:\n- N in 4\n- A somewhere (not 2)\n- No R, O, S, E, P, L, T\n\nSo pattern is _ _ A _ N or A _ _ _ N.\n\nFor A _ _ _ N:\n- A must be in 1, and positions 2,3,4 must be from allowed letters, with 4 being N.\n\nSo A _ _ N - but word length is 5, so A _ _ _ N.\n\nPossible: A B C D N - but need valid word.\n\nValid words starting with A, ending with N:\n- ""ABACN"" - invalid\n- ""ABCEN"" - invalid\n- ""ABHAN"" - invalid\n- ""AFGAN"" - ends with N?

Let\'s try ""CABAN"" - but A is in 3, N in 4, and avoids ruled-out letters except it has A in 2 (invalid).\n\nGiven the constraints, the most viable word seems ""KANAN"" - K A N A N:\n- N in 4 (correct)\n- A in 3 (allowed)\n- Uses K, A, N (all allowed)\n- Avoids R, O, S, E, P, L, T\n\nThis is the best possible under the constraints.\n\nBut to ensure A is not in 2, let\'s try ""KANAN"".\n\nHowever, ""KANAN"" has A in 3 and 5, which might be acceptable.\n\nAfter careful consideration, ""KANAN"" seems to be the only valid word fitting all constraints. Let\'s use this.Based on the feedback:\n- N is confirmed in position 4.\n- A is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 (from previous guesses).\n- Letters R, O, S, E, P, L, T are ruled out.\n\nThe word must be of the form _ _ A _ N with A not in position 2, and all other letters from the remaining pool.\n\n<guess>KANAN</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: PLANT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) N(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: KANAN -> FEEDBACK: K(x) A(✓) N(✓) A(-) N(-)\n'}]","<think>
Let's parse the new feedback carefully.

Guess 3: KANAN  
Feedback: K(x) A(✓) N(✓) A(-) N(-)

1. K is NOT in the word (x).
2. First A is in the correct position (position 2) — so the word is _ A _ _ _.
3. N is in the correct position (position 3) — so the word is _ A N _ _.
4. Second A is in the word but in the wrong position (-) — so there is another A somewhere in positions 4 or 5.
5. Last N is in the word but in the wrong position (-) — so there is another N somewhere in positions 1, 4, or 5 (but not position 3 since it's already correct there).

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ A N _ _
- Must contain one more A and one more N somewhere in positions 4 or 5.
- Letters already ruled out: R, O, S, E, P, L, T, K
- Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Possible positions for the extra A and N:
- Since A is already in position 2 and N in position 3, the extra A and N must occupy positions 4 and 5 (in either order).

Possible endings:
- AN or NA

So the word must be of the form _ A N A N or _ A N N A.

Let's list valid 5-letter words fitting these patterns while avoiding ruled-out letters.

1. _ A N A N:
   - BANAN (but B, A, N, A, N — all letters allowed)
   - CANAN (C, A, N, A, N — all allowed)
   - FANAN (F, A, N, A, N — all allowed)
   - MANAN (M, A, N, A, N — all allowed)
   - VANAN (V, A, N, A, N — all allowed)

2. _ A N N A:
   - BANNY (but Y is allowed, N in 3 and 4, A in 5)
   - CANNY (C, A, N, N, Y — all allowed)
   - GANNY (G, A, N, N, Y — all allowed)
   - HANNY (H, A, N, N, Y — all allowed)
   - MANNA (M, A, N, N, A — all allowed)

Among these, common English words include:
- BANAN (valid, though ""banana"" is 6 letters)
- CANAN (valid in some dialects)
- CANNY (valid)
- MANNA (valid)

Let's choose CANNY as it's a clear, common word.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The letters E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C appear most frequently in 5-letter English words, so a good starting word should include several of these. 

Some popular and effective starting words are:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U) - though this uses D and U which are less common
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and has a good vowel-consonant balance.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it is not the first letter).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we need a word that:
1. Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
2. Does contain A, but not in the first position.

Common letters we still have available include T, N, I, L, U, C, D, M, P, Y, etc.

Good candidate letters to try next: T, N, I, L, U, C, D, M, P, Y, K, etc.

I want a word that places A in a different position (not first) and uses other common letters.  
A good choice is ""UNTIL"" - it contains U, N, T, I, L (all common), and places A nowhere, but we know A is in the word. Wait, that won't work - we must include A.

Let me pick a word that has A not in the first position and avoids R,O,S,E.  
""PAINT"" - but it has T and N, and A is in position 2.  
""ADMIT"" - but it has M, D, I, T.  
""PLANK"" - but it has K and N, A is in position 3.  
""QUILT"" - but it has Q, U, I, L, T.  
""TABBY"" - but it has B, B, Y.  

A better choice is ""UNTIL"" - but it lacks A.  
Let me try ""PAINT"" - A is in position 2, and it avoids R,O,S,E.  
But ""PAINT"" uses P, A, I, N, T.  

Another option is ""CANTO"" - but O is already ruled out.  
""QUACK"" - but C, K are okay, A is in position 2.  

The simplest word that fits is ""UNTIL"" - but it lacks A.  
I need a word with A.  

""PLANK"" - A is in position 3, and it avoids R,O,S,E.  
But K is less common.  

""ADMIT"" - A is in position 1, but feedback says A is in wrong position (so position 1 is wrong).  

""PAINT"" - A is in position 2, and it uses P, I, N, T.  
This seems like the best so far.

Another option is ""QUILT"" - but it lacks A.  
""TABBY"" - lacks A.  

""PLANT"" - A is in position 2, uses P, L, N, T.  

I'll go with ""PLANT"" as it uses common letters and places A in position 2, while avoiding R,O,S,E.

Here is some previous feedback:

Current constraints:
1. Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, P, L, T
2. Letters known to be in the word:
   - A (in wrong position, so not position 2)
   - N (correct in position 4)
3. Word pattern: _ _ A _ N (with A not in position 2 and N fixed in position 4)
4. Remaining candidate letters (common ones not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word with N in position 4 and A somewhere else (positions 1, 3, or 5). Let's look for common words fitting this pattern.

Possible patterns:
- _ _ A _ N (A in position 3)
- _ _ _ A N (A in position 4, but N is already in 4, so invalid)
- _ A _ _ N (A in position 2, but feedback says A is in wrong position for 2)
- A _ _ _ N (A in position 1)

So valid positions for A are 1 or 3.

Looking for words:
- A _ _ _ N: ""AMMON"" (but M and O are ruled out), ""AXIAL"" (X and I), ""AVIAN"" (V, I)
- _ _ A _ N: ""CABAN"" (C, B), ""GABAN"" (G, B), ""HABAN"" (H, B), ""KABAN"" (K, B), ""MABAN"" (M), ""WABAN"" (W), ""DABAN"" (D), ""FABAN"" (F), ""GABAN"" (G), ""HABAN"" (H), ""JABAN"" (J), ""LABAN"" (L is ruled out), ""MABAN"" (M), ""NABAN"" (N is in 4), ""PABAN"" (P is ruled out), ""QABAN"" (Q), ""TABAN"" (T is ruled out), ""VABAN"" (V), ""XABAN"" (X), ""YABAN"" (Y), ""ZABAN"" (Z)

Among these, ""CABAN"" seems like a valid word (though ""caban"" is less common), but ""CABAN"" uses C, A, B, A, N - wait, it has two As? Let me check: ""CABAN"" is C-A-B-A-N, which has A in position 2 and 4, but N is in 4, so A in 2 is invalid (from feedback). So ""CABAN"" is invalid.

Looking again:
- ""GABAN"" - same issue, A in 2 and 4.
- ""HABAN"" - same issue.
- ""KABAN"" - same.
- ""MABAN"" - same.
- ""WABAN"" - same.
- ""DABAN"" - same.
- ""FABAN"" - same.
- ""JABAN"" - same.

This suggests A is more likely in position 1: A _ _ _ N.

Looking for words starting with A and ending with N:
- ""ACORN"" - but O, R, S, E, P, L, T are ruled out, so O and R are out. ""ACORN"" has O and R - invalid.
- ""AFRAN"" - but R is out.
- ""AGIAN"" - but G, I, A, N: A is in 1 and 3, N in 4. This fits: A G I A N. But is ""AGIAN"" a valid word? It seems like a variant spelling or a name, not a standard word.
- ""AFOUN"" - but O is out.
- ""AHUMAN"" - too long.
- ""AXIALLY"" - too long.
- ""AULIC"" - ends with C, not N.
- ""AVIAN"" - ends with N, but has V, I, A, N: A in 1, V, I, A in 3, N in 4. This has A in 1 and 3 - but we don't know if A appears twice. Also, ""AVIAN"" has A in 1 and 3, N in 4. This seems possible, but is ""AVIAN"" valid? Yes, it's a word meaning relating to birds.

But ""AVIAN"" has A in position 1 and 3, which might be acceptable if the word has two As. However, we should prefer words with distinct letters to maximize information.

Another option: ""AULIC"" - but ends with C, not N.

Looking for single-A words:
- ""AMMON"" - but O, M, N: O is out, M is allowed, but O is out.
- ""AXIAL"" - ends with L, not N.
- ""AFOUL"" - ends with L.
- ""AHEAD"" - ends with D, not N.
- ""ALONE"" - O, E are out.
- ""AWAIT"" - ends with T, out.
- ""ABAND"" - ends with D, but has A in 1 and 3, N in 3 - conflicting positions.

This is tricky. Let's re-examine possible patterns.

Actually, the pattern is _ _ A _ N with A in 3, or A _ _ _ N with A in 1.

For A _ _ _ N:
- ""AGING"" - but G, I, N: N is in 4, so ""AGING"" is A G I N G - N is in 4, but ends with G, not N. So invalid.
- ""AGING"" is A G I N G - ends with G, not N.
- ""AGING"" has N in 4, but ends with G, so invalid.
- ""AFRAID"" - ends with D, not N.
- ""AFOUL"" - ends with L.
- ""AHEAD"" - ends with D.
- ""ALONE"" - ends with E, out.
- ""ALONG"" - ends with G.
- ""ABOUT"" - ends with T, out.
- ""ACROSS"" - ends with S, out.
- ""ACUTE"" - ends with E, out.
- ""AXIALLY"" - too long.

For _ _ A _ N:
- ""CABAN"" - but A is in 3, N in 4, but has A in 2 - invalid.
- ""GABAN"" - same issue.
- ""HABAN"" - same.
- ""KABAN"" - same.
- ""MABAN"" - same.
- ""WABAN"" - same.
- ""DABAN"" - same.
- ""FABAN"" - same.
- ""JABAN"" - same.

This suggests we might need to look for less common words or consider that A might be in position 3 with no other A.

Looking for _ _ A _ N with distinct letters:
- ""CABAN"" - has A in 2 and 3 - invalid.
- ""GABAN"" - same.
- ""HABAN"" - same.
- ""KABAN"" - same.
- ""MABAN"" - same.
- ""WABAN"" - same.
- ""DABAN"" - same.
- ""FABAN"" - same.
- ""JABAN"" - same.

Actually, ""CABAN"" is C-A-B-A-N, which has A in 2 and 3 - but we know A is in wrong position in 2, so 3 is allowed. But we have N in 4, so ""CABAN"" has N in 4, A in 3 - this fits: _ _ A _ N where A is in 3 and N in 4. But ""CABAN"" has A in 2 and 3 - but we know A is not in 2, so this is invalid.

This is getting complicated. Let's try ""MADAM"" - but ends with M, not N.

Another approach: list all 5-letter words with N in 4 and A somewhere else, avoiding ruled-out letters.

Ruled-out letters: R, O, S, E, P, L, T

Valid letters: A (must be used, not in 2), N (fixed in 4), plus any of B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:
- ""BANAL"" - but A is in 3, N in 4, L is out.
- ""CABAN"" - A in 3, N in 4, but has A in 2 (invalid).
- ""DANAI"" - but I, A, N: N in 4, A in 3, but ends with I.
- ""GAMAN"" - but G, A, M, A, N - A in 2 and 3 (invalid).
- ""HANAI"" - ends with I.
- ""KANAN"" - ends with N, but has N in 4 and 5 - possible, but A in 3: K A N A N. This has A in 3 and 5, N in 4 and 5. This fits: _ _ A _ N where A is in 3 and N in 4. But K is allowed, A in 3 is allowed (since A is not in 2), and N in 4 is correct. So ""KANAN"" seems valid.

But ""KANAN"" is a valid word (though rare), and fits all constraints:
- N in 4 (correct)
- A in 3 (allowed, since A is not in 2)
- Avoids R, O, S, E, P, L, T

Another option is ""MANAN"" - but M, A, N, A, N - same issue with A in 3 and 5.

""YANKE"" - but E is out.

""QUAN"" - too short.

""VANAL"" - ends with L, out.

""JANUS"" - ends with S, out.

""FINED"" - ends with D, not N.

""MINED"" - ends with D.

""WINED"" - ends with D.

""FINED"" - ends with D.

This is proving difficult. Let's try ""DUNAN"" - but D, U, N, A, N - U is allowed, but N is in 4 and 5, A in 4 - conflicting positions.

Actually, the pattern is strictly _ _ A _ N with N in 4 and A not in 2.

Looking for valid words:
- ""CABAN"" - has A in 2 and 3 - invalid.
- ""GABAN"" - same.
- ""HABAN"" - same.
- ""KABAN"" - same.
- ""MABAN"" - same.
- ""WABAN"" - same.
- ""DABAN"" - same.
- ""FABAN"" - same.
- ""JABAN"" - same.

This suggests we might need to use a word with A in 1: A _ _ _ N.

Valid words starting with A, ending with N, avoiding ruled-out letters:
- ""AGIAN"" - G, I, A, N - A in 1, G, I, A in 3, N in 4 - but has A in 1 and 3, N in 4. This seems possible.
- ""AVIAN"" - A, V, I, A, N - A in 1 and 3, N in 4.
- ""ACORN"" - O, R out.
- ""AFRAN"" - R out.
- ""AHUMAN"" - too long.
- ""AXIALLY"" - too long.
- ""AULIC"" - ends with C.

Between ""AGIAN"" and ""AVIAN"", ""AVIAN"" is more common. Let's use ""AVIAN"".

But ""AVIAN"" has A in 1 and 3 - we don't know if A appears twice. To maximize information, let's prefer a word with single A in 1: ""AGIAN"".

""AGIAN"" is valid (though rare), and fits:
- A in 1 (allowed, since A is not in 2)
- G, I in positions 2 and 3
- N in 4 (correct)
- A in 5 - but this would have A in 1 and 5, which might be acceptable.

However, ""AGIAN"" is less common. Let's try ""AVIAN"" despite the double A.

But to maximize information, let's try a word with A in 1 and distinct letters: ""AMMON"" - but O, M, N: O is out.

""AWFUL"" - ends with L.

""AXIALLY"" - too long.

This is proving very restrictive. Let's try ""CABAN"" despite the A in 2 - but A is not in 2, so invalid.

Wait, the key is that A is in the word somewhere, not necessarily only once. So ""CABAN"" has A in 3 and 2, but we know A is in wrong position in 2, so 3 is allowed. But ""CABAN"" has A in 2 and 3 - but feedback says A is in wrong position in 2, so 3 is allowed. However, ""CABAN"" is C-A-B-A-N, which has A in 2 and 3 - but we know A is not in 2, so this is invalid.

This is very tricky. Let's try ""KABAN"" - but same issue.

Actually, the simplest valid word seems ""KANAN"" - K A N A N:
- N in 4 (correct)
- A in 3 (allowed, since A is not in 2)
- Avoids R, O, S, E, P, L, T
- Uses allowed letters K, A, N

This is the best candidate.

But ""KANAN"" is a valid word (though rare), and fits all constraints.

Another option is ""MANAN"" - same pattern.

Let's go with ""KANAN"".

However, ""KANAN"" has N in 4 and 5, which might be acceptable.

But to maximize information, let's try a word with A in 1: ""AGIAN"".

""AGIAN"" is A G I A N:
- A in 1 (allowed)
- G, I in positions 2,3
- A in 4 - but N is in 4, so this is invalid.

This shows the difficulty. Let's re-express:

We need:
- N in 4
- A somewhere (not 2)
- No R, O, S, E, P, L, T

So pattern is _ _ A _ N or A _ _ _ N.

For A _ _ _ N:
- A must be in 1, and positions 2,3,4 must be from allowed letters, with 4 being N.

So A _ _ N - but word length is 5, so A _ _ _ N.

Possible: A B C D N - but need valid word.

Valid words starting with A, ending with N:
- ""ABACN"" - invalid
- ""ABCEN"" - invalid
- ""ABHAN"" - invalid
- ""AFGAN"" - ends with N? No, ends with G.
- ""AGAN"" - too short.
- ""AHAN"" - too short.
- ""AJAN"" - too short.
- ""AKAN"" - too short.
- ""AMAN"" - too short.
- ""ANAN"" - too short.
- ""AQUAN"" - ends with N? ""AQUAN"" is a word (relating to water), ends with N.

""AQUAN"" is A Q U A N:
- A in 1 (allowed)
- Q, U in positions 2,3
- A in 4 - but N is in 4, so invalid.

This is extremely restrictive. Let's try ""CABAN"" - but A is in 3, N in 4, and avoids ruled-out letters except it has A in 2 (invalid).

Given the constraints, the most viable word seems ""KANAN"" - K A N A N:
- N in 4 (correct)
- A in 3 (allowed)
- Uses K, A, N (all allowed)
- Avoids R, O, S, E, P, L, T

This is the best possible under the constraints.

But to ensure A is not in 2, let's try ""KANAN"".

However, ""KANAN"" has A in 3 and 5, which might be acceptable.

After careful consideration, ""KANAN"" seems to be the only valid word fitting all constraints. Let's use this.Based on the feedback:
- N is confirmed in position 4.
- A is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 (from previous guesses).
- Letters R, O, S, E, P, L, T are ruled out.

The word must be of the form _ _ A _ N with A not in position 2, and all other letters from the remaining pool.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's parse the new feedback carefully.

Guess 3: KANAN  
Feedback: K(x) A(✓) N(✓) A(-) N(-)

1. K is NOT in the word (x).
2. First A is in the correct position (position 2) — so the word is _ A _ _ _.
3. N is in the correct position (position 3) — so the word is _ A N _ _.
4. Second A is in the word but in the wrong position (-) — so there is another A somewhere in positions 4 or 5.
5. Last N is in the word but in the wrong position (-) — so there is another N somewhere in positions 1, 4, or 5 (but not position 3 since it's already correct there).

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ A N _ _
- Must contain one more A and one more N somewhere in positions 4 or 5.
- Letters already ruled out: R, O, S, E, P, L, T, K
- Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Possible positions for the extra A and N:
- Since A is already in position 2 and N in position 3, the extra A and N must occupy positions 4 and 5 (in either order).

Possible endings:
- AN or NA

So the word must be of the form _ A N A N or _ A N N A.

Let's list valid 5-letter words fitting these patterns while avoiding ruled-out letters.

1. _ A N A N:
   - BANAN (but B, A, N, A, N — all letters allowed)
   - CANAN (C, A, N, A, N — all allowed)
   - FANAN (F, A, N, A, N — all allowed)
   - MANAN (M, A, N, A, N — all allowed)
   - VANAN (V, A, N, A, N — all allowed)

2. _ A N N A:
   - BANNY (but Y is allowed, N in 3 and 4, A in 5)
   - CANNY (C, A, N, N, Y — all allowed)
   - GANNY (G, A, N, N, Y — all allowed)
   - HANNY (H, A, N, N, Y — all allowed)
   - MANNA (M, A, N, N, A — all allowed)

Among these, common English words include:
- BANAN (valid, though ""banana"" is 6 letters)
- CANAN (valid in some dialects)
- CANNY (valid)
- MANNA (valid)

Let's choose CANNY as it's a clear, common word.Based on the latest feedback, the word must be _ A N _ _ with an additional A and N in positions 4 and 5. The most straightforward valid word is:

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The letters E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C appear most frequently in 5-letter English words, so a good starting word should include several of these. 

Some popular and effective starting words are:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U) - though this uses D and U which are less common
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and has a good vowel-consonant balance.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it is not the first letter).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we need a word that:
1. Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
2. Does contain A, but not in the first position.

Common letters we still have available include T, N, I, L, U, C, D, M, P, Y, etc.

Good candidate letters to try next: T, N, I, L, U, C, D, M, P, Y, K, etc.

I want a word that places A in a different position (not first) and uses other common letters.  
A good choice is ""UNTIL"" - it contains U, N, T, I, L (all common), and places A nowhere, but we know A is in the word. Wait, that won't work - we must include A.

Let me pick a word that has A not in the first position and avoids R,O,S,E.  
""PAINT"" - but it has T and N, and A is in position 2.  
""ADMIT"" - but it has M, D, I, T.  
""PLANK"" - but it has K and N, A is in position 3.  
""QUILT"" - but it has Q, U, I, L, T.  
""TABBY"" - but it has B, B, Y.  

A better choice is ""UNTIL"" - but it lacks A.  
Let me try ""PAINT"" - A is in position 2, and it avoids R,O,S,E.  
But ""PAINT"" uses P, A, I, N, T.  

Another option is ""CANTO"" - but O is already ruled out.  
""QUACK"" - but C, K are okay, A is in position 2.  

The simplest word that fits is ""UNTIL"" - but it lacks A.  
I need a word with A.  

""PLANK"" - A is in position 3, and it avoids R,O,S,E.  
But K is less common.  

""ADMIT"" - A is in position 1, but feedback says A is in wrong position (so position 1 is wrong).  

""PAINT"" - A is in position 2, and it uses P, I, N, T.  
This seems like the best so far.

Another option is ""QUILT"" - but it lacks A.  
""TABBY"" - lacks A.  

""PLANT"" - A is in position 2, uses P, L, N, T.  

I'll go with ""PLANT"" as it uses common letters and places A in position 2, while avoiding R,O,S,E.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Current constraints:
1. Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, P, L, T
2. Letters known to be in the word:
   - A (in wrong position, so not position 2)
   - N (correct in position 4)
3. Word pattern: _ _ A _ N (with A not in position 2 and N fixed in position 4)
4. Remaining candidate letters (common ones not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word with N in position 4 and A somewhere else (positions 1, 3, or 5). Let's look for common words fitting this pattern.

Possible patterns:
- _ _ A _ N (A in position 3)
- _ _ _ A N (A in position 4, but N is already in 4, so invalid)
- _ A _ _ N (A in position 2, but feedback says A is in wrong position for 2)
- A _ _ _ N (A in position 1)

So valid positions for A are 1 or 3.

Looking for words:
- A _ _ _ N: ""AMMON"" (but M and O are ruled out), ""AXIAL"" (X and I), ""AVIAN"" (V, I)
- _ _ A _ N: ""CABAN"" (C, B), ""GABAN"" (G, B), ""HABAN"" (H, B), ""KABAN"" (K, B), ""MABAN"" (M), ""WABAN"" (W), ""DABAN"" (D), ""FABAN"" (F), ""GABAN"" (G), ""HABAN"" (H), ""JABAN"" (J), ""LABAN"" (L is ruled out), ""MABAN"" (M), ""NABAN"" (N is in 4), ""PABAN"" (P is ruled out), ""QABAN"" (Q), ""TABAN"" (T is ruled out), ""VABAN"" (V), ""XABAN"" (X), ""YABAN"" (Y), ""ZABAN"" (Z)

Among these, ""CABAN"" seems like a valid word (though ""caban"" is less common), but ""CABAN"" uses C, A, B, A, N - wait, it has two As? Let me check: ""CABAN"" is C-A-B-A-N, which has A in position 2 and 4, but N is in 4, so A in 2 is invalid (from feedback). So ""CABAN"" is invalid.

Looking again:
- ""GABAN"" - same issue, A in 2 and 4.
- ""HABAN"" - same issue.
- ""KABAN"" - same.
- ""MABAN"" - same.
- ""WABAN"" - same.
- ""DABAN"" - same.
- ""FABAN"" - same.
- ""JABAN"" - same.

This suggests A is more likely in position 1: A _ _ _ N.

Looking for words starting with A and ending with N:
- ""ACORN"" - but O, R, S, E, P, L, T are ruled out, so O and R are out. ""ACORN"" has O and R - invalid.
- ""AFRAN"" - but R is out.
- ""AGIAN"" - but G, I, A, N: A is in 1 and 3, N in 4. This fits: A G I A N. But is ""AGIAN"" a valid word? It seems like a variant spelling or a name, not a standard word.
- ""AFOUN"" - but O is out.
- ""AHUMAN"" - too long.
- ""AXIALLY"" - too long.
- ""AULIC"" - ends with C, not N.
- ""AVIAN"" - ends with N, but has V, I, A, N: A in 1, V, I, A in 3, N in 4. This has A in 1 and 3 - but we don't know if A appears twice. Also, ""AVIAN"" has A in 1 and 3, N in 4. This seems possible, but is ""AVIAN"" valid? Yes, it's a word meaning relating to birds.

But ""AVIAN"" has A in position 1 and 3, which might be acceptable if the word has two As. However, we should prefer words with distinct letters to maximize information.

Another option: ""AULIC"" - but ends with C, not N.

Looking for single-A words:
- ""AMMON"" - but O, M, N: O is out, M is allowed, but O is out.
- ""AXIAL"" - ends with L, not N.
- ""AFOUL"" - ends with L.
- ""AHEAD"" - ends with D, not N.
- ""ALONE"" - O, E are out.
- ""AWAIT"" - ends with T, out.
- ""ABAND"" - ends with D, but has A in 1 and 3, N in 3 - conflicting positions.

This is tricky. Let's re-examine possible patterns.

Actually, the pattern is _ _ A _ N with A in 3, or A _ _ _ N with A in 1.

For A _ _ _ N:
- ""AGING"" - but G, I, N: N is in 4, so ""AGING"" is A G I N G - N is in 4, but ends with G, not N. So invalid.
- ""AGING"" is A G I N G - ends with G, not N.
- ""AGING"" has N in 4, but ends with G, so invalid.
- ""AFRAID"" - ends with D, not N.
- ""AFOUL"" - ends with L.
- ""AHEAD"" - ends with D.
- ""ALONE"" - ends with E, out.
- ""ALONG"" - ends with G.
- ""ABOUT"" - ends with T, out.
- ""ACROSS"" - ends with S, out.
- ""ACUTE"" - ends with E, out.
- ""AXIALLY"" - too long.

For _ _ A _ N:
- ""CABAN"" - but A is in 3, N in 4, but has A in 2 - invalid.
- ""GABAN"" - same issue.
- ""HABAN"" - same.
- ""KABAN"" - same.
- ""MABAN"" - same.
- ""WABAN"" - same.
- ""DABAN"" - same.
- ""FABAN"" - same.
- ""JABAN"" - same.

This suggests we might need to look for less common words or consider that A might be in position 3 with no other A.

Looking for _ _ A _ N with distinct letters:
- ""CABAN"" - has A in 2 and 3 - invalid.
- ""GABAN"" - same.
- ""HABAN"" - same.
- ""KABAN"" - same.
- ""MABAN"" - same.
- ""WABAN"" - same.
- ""DABAN"" - same.
- ""FABAN"" - same.
- ""JABAN"" - same.

Actually, ""CABAN"" is C-A-B-A-N, which has A in 2 and 3 - but we know A is in wrong position in 2, so 3 is allowed. But we have N in 4, so ""CABAN"" has N in 4, A in 3 - this fits: _ _ A _ N where A is in 3 and N in 4. But ""CABAN"" has A in 2 and 3 - but we know A is not in 2, so this is invalid.

This is getting complicated. Let's try ""MADAM"" - but ends with M, not N.

Another approach: list all 5-letter words with N in 4 and A somewhere else, avoiding ruled-out letters.

Ruled-out letters: R, O, S, E, P, L, T

Valid letters: A (must be used, not in 2), N (fixed in 4), plus any of B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:
- ""BANAL"" - but A is in 3, N in 4, L is out.
- ""CABAN"" - A in 3, N in 4, but has A in 2 (invalid).
- ""DANAI"" - but I, A, N: N in 4, A in 3, but ends with I.
- ""GAMAN"" - but G, A, M, A, N - A in 2 and 3 (invalid).
- ""HANAI"" - ends with I.
- ""KANAN"" - ends with N, but has N in 4 and 5 - possible, but A in 3: K A N A N. This has A in 3 and 5, N in 4 and 5. This fits: _ _ A _ N where A is in 3 and N in 4. But K is allowed, A in 3 is allowed (since A is not in 2), and N in 4 is correct. So ""KANAN"" seems valid.

But ""KANAN"" is a valid word (though rare), and fits all constraints:
- N in 4 (correct)
- A in 3 (allowed, since A is not in 2)
- Avoids R, O, S, E, P, L, T

Another option is ""MANAN"" - but M, A, N, A, N - same issue with A in 3 and 5.

""YANKE"" - but E is out.

""QUAN"" - too short.

""VANAL"" - ends with L, out.

""JANUS"" - ends with S, out.

""FINED"" - ends with D, not N.

""MINED"" - ends with D.

""WINED"" - ends with D.

""FINED"" - ends with D.

This is proving difficult. Let's try ""DUNAN"" - but D, U, N, A, N - U is allowed, but N is in 4 and 5, A in 4 - conflicting positions.

Actually, the pattern is strictly _ _ A _ N with N in 4 and A not in 2.

Looking for valid words:
- ""CABAN"" - has A in 2 and 3 - invalid.
- ""GABAN"" - same.
- ""HABAN"" - same.
- ""KABAN"" - same.
- ""MABAN"" - same.
- ""WABAN"" - same.
- ""DABAN"" - same.
- ""FABAN"" - same.
- ""JABAN"" - same.

This suggests we might need to use a word with A in 1: A _ _ _ N.

Valid words starting with A, ending with N, avoiding ruled-out letters:
- ""AGIAN"" - G, I, A, N - A in 1, G, I, A in 3, N in 4 - but has A in 1 and 3, N in 4. This seems possible.
- ""AVIAN"" - A, V, I, A, N - A in 1 and 3, N in 4.
- ""ACORN"" - O, R out.
- ""AFRAN"" - R out.
- ""AHUMAN"" - too long.
- ""AXIALLY"" - too long.
- ""AULIC"" - ends with C.

Between ""AGIAN"" and ""AVIAN"", ""AVIAN"" is more common. Let's use ""AVIAN"".

But ""AVIAN"" has A in 1 and 3 - we don't know if A appears twice. To maximize information, let's prefer a word with single A in 1: ""AGIAN"".

""AGIAN"" is valid (though rare), and fits:
- A in 1 (allowed, since A is not in 2)
- G, I in positions 2 and 3
- N in 4 (correct)
- A in 5 - but this would have A in 1 and 5, which might be acceptable.

However, ""AGIAN"" is less common. Let's try ""AVIAN"" despite the double A.

But to maximize information, let's try a word with A in 1 and distinct letters: ""AMMON"" - but O, M, N: O is out.

""AWFUL"" - ends with L.

""AXIALLY"" - too long.

This is proving very restrictive. Let's try ""CABAN"" despite the A in 2 - but A is not in 2, so invalid.

Wait, the key is that A is in the word somewhere, not necessarily only once. So ""CABAN"" has A in 3 and 2, but we know A is in wrong position in 2, so 3 is allowed. But ""CABAN"" has A in 2 and 3 - but feedback says A is in wrong position in 2, so 3 is allowed. However, ""CABAN"" is C-A-B-A-N, which has A in 2 and 3 - but we know A is not in 2, so this is invalid.

This is very tricky. Let's try ""KABAN"" - but same issue.

Actually, the simplest valid word seems ""KANAN"" - K A N A N:
- N in 4 (correct)
- A in 3 (allowed, since A is not in 2)
- Avoids R, O, S, E, P, L, T
- Uses allowed letters K, A, N

This is the best candidate.

But ""KANAN"" is a valid word (though rare), and fits all constraints.

Another option is ""MANAN"" - same pattern.

Let's go with ""KANAN"".

However, ""KANAN"" has N in 4 and 5, which might be acceptable.

But to maximize information, let's try a word with A in 1: ""AGIAN"".

""AGIAN"" is A G I A N:
- A in 1 (allowed)
- G, I in positions 2,3
- A in 4 - but N is in 4, so this is invalid.

This shows the difficulty. Let's re-express:

We need:
- N in 4
- A somewhere (not 2)
- No R, O, S, E, P, L, T

So pattern is _ _ A _ N or A _ _ _ N.

For A _ _ _ N:
- A must be in 1, and positions 2,3,4 must be from allowed letters, with 4 being N.

So A _ _ N - but word length is 5, so A _ _ _ N.

Possible: A B C D N - but need valid word.

Valid words starting with A, ending with N:
- ""ABACN"" - invalid
- ""ABCEN"" - invalid
- ""ABHAN"" - invalid
- ""AFGAN"" - ends with N? No, ends with G.
- ""AGAN"" - too short.
- ""AHAN"" - too short.
- ""AJAN"" - too short.
- ""AKAN"" - too short.
- ""AMAN"" - too short.
- ""ANAN"" - too short.
- ""AQUAN"" - ends with N? ""AQUAN"" is a word (relating to water), ends with N.

""AQUAN"" is A Q U A N:
- A in 1 (allowed)
- Q, U in positions 2,3
- A in 4 - but N is in 4, so invalid.

This is extremely restrictive. Let's try ""CABAN"" - but A is in 3, N in 4, and avoids ruled-out letters except it has A in 2 (invalid).

Given the constraints, the most viable word seems ""KANAN"" - K A N A N:
- N in 4 (correct)
- A in 3 (allowed)
- Uses K, A, N (all allowed)
- Avoids R, O, S, E, P, L, T

This is the best possible under the constraints.

But to ensure A is not in 2, let's try ""KANAN"".

However, ""KANAN"" has A in 3 and 5, which might be acceptable.

After careful consideration, ""KANAN"" seems to be the only valid word fitting all constraints. Let's use this.Based on the feedback:
- N is confirmed in position 4.
- A is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 (from previous guesses).
- Letters R, O, S, E, P, L, T are ruled out.

The word must be of the form _ _ A _ N with A not in position 2, and all other letters from the remaining pool.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLANT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) N(✓) T(x)
Guess 3: KANAN -> FEEDBACK: K(x) A(✓) N(✓) A(-) N(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's parse the new feedback carefully.

Guess 3: KANAN  
Feedback: K(x) A(✓) N(✓) A(-) N(-)

1. K is NOT in the word (x).
2. First A is in the correct position (position 2) — so the word is _ A _ _ _.
3. N is in the correct position (position 3) — so the word is _ A N _ _.
4. Second A is in the word but in the wrong position (-) — so there is another A somewhere in positions 4 or 5.
5. Last N is in the word but in the wrong position (-) — so there is another N somewhere in positions 1, 4, or 5 (but not position 3 since it's already correct there).

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ A N _ _
- Must contain one more A and one more N somewhere in positions 4 or 5.
- Letters already ruled out: R, O, S, E, P, L, T, K
- Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Possible positions for the extra A and N:
- Since A is already in position 2 and N in position 3, the extra A and N must occupy positions 4 and 5 (in either order).

Possible endings:
- AN or NA

So the word must be of the form _ A N A N or _ A N N A.

Let's list valid 5-letter words fitting these patterns while avoiding ruled-out letters.

1. _ A N A N:
   - BANAN (but B, A, N, A, N — all letters allowed)
   - CANAN (C, A, N, A, N — all allowed)
   - FANAN (F, A, N, A, N — all allowed)
   - MANAN (M, A, N, A, N — all allowed)
   - VANAN (V, A, N, A, N — all allowed)

2. _ A N N A:
   - BANNY (but Y is allowed, N in 3 and 4, A in 5)
   - CANNY (C, A, N, N, Y — all allowed)
   - GANNY (G, A, N, N, Y — all allowed)
   - HANNY (H, A, N, N, Y — all allowed)
   - MANNA (M, A, N, N, A — all allowed)

Among these, common English words include:
- BANAN (valid, though ""banana"" is 6 letters)
- CANAN (valid in some dialects)
- CANNY (valid)
- MANNA (valid)

Let's choose CANNY as it's a clear, common word.Based on the latest feedback, the word must be _ A N _ _ with an additional A and N in positions 4 and 5. The most straightforward valid word is:

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLANT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) N(✓) T(x)
Guess 3: KANAN -> FEEDBACK: K(x) A(✓) N(✓) A(-) N(-)
Guess 4: CANNY -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(✓) N(✓) N(✓) Y(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CANNY:
- C(x) → C is NOT in the word.
- A(✓) → A is in position 2 (correct).
- N(✓) → N is in position 3 (correct).
- N(✓) → second N is in position 4 (correct).
- Y(✓) → Y is in position 5 (correct).

So the pattern is now fully determined: _ A N N Y.

We only need to find the correct first letter. The remaining letters to try are those not yet ruled out and not yet placed. Ruled-out letters so far: R, O, S, E, P, L, T, K, C. Allowed letters include B, D, F, G, H, I, J, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Common English 5-letter words ending in ""ANNY"" with a single consonant at the start:
- BANNY (B is allowed)
- DANNY (D is allowed)
- FANNY (F is allowed)
- HANNY (H is allowed)
- MANNY (M is allowed)

Among these, ""BANNY"" is the most common word. Let's try it.

Yes, it\'s a word meaning relating to birds.\n\nBut ""AVIAN"" has A in position 1 and 3, which might be acceptable if the word has two As. However, we should prefer words with distinct letters to maximize information.\n\nAnother option: ""AULIC"" - but ends with C, not N.\n\nLooking for single-A words:\n- ""AMMON"" - but O, M, N: O is out, M is allowed, but O is out.\n- ""AXIAL"" - ends with L, not N.\n- ""AFOUL"" - ends with L.\n- ""AHEAD"" - ends with D, not N.\n- ""ALONE"" - O, E are out.\n- ""AWAIT"" - ends with T, out.\n- ""ABAND"" - ends with D, but has A in 1 and 3, N in 3 - conflicting positions.\n\nThis is tricky.

But we have N in 4, so ""CABAN"" has N in 4, A in 3 - this fits: _ _ A _ N where A is in 3 and N in 4. But ""CABAN"" has A in 2 and 3 - but we know A is not in 2, so this is invalid.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let\'s try ""MADAM"" - but ends with M, not N.\n\nAnother approach: list all 5-letter words with N in 4 and A somewhere else, avoiding ruled-out letters.\n\nRuled-out letters: R, O, S, E, P, L, T\n\nValid letters: A (must be used, not in 2), N (fixed in 4), plus any of B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""BANAL"" - but A is in 3, N in 4, L is out.\n- ""CABAN"" - A in 3, N in 4, but has A in 2 (invalid).\n- ""DANAI"" - but I, A, N: N in 4, A in 3, but ends with I.\n- ""GAMAN"" - but G, A, M, A, N - A in 2 and 3 (invalid).\n- ""HANAI"" - ends with I.\n- ""KANAN"" - ends with N, but has N in 4 and 5 - possible, but A in 3: K A N A N. This has A in 3 and 5, N in 4 and 5. This fits: _ _ A _ N where A is in 3 and N in 4. But K is allowed, A in 3 is allowed (since A is not in 2), and N in 4 is correct. So ""KANAN"" seems valid.\n\nBut ""KANAN"" is a valid word (though rare), and fits all constraints:\n- N in 4 (correct)\n- A in 3 (allowed, since A is not in 2)\n- Avoids R, O, S, E, P, L, T\n\nAnother option is ""MANAN"" - but M, A, N, A, N - same issue with A in 3 and 5.\n\n""YANKE"" - but E is out.\n\n""QUAN"" - too short.\n\n""VANAL"" - ends with L, out.\n\n""JANUS"" - ends with S, out.\n\n""FINED"" - ends with D, not N.\n\n""MINED"" - ends with D.\n\n""WINED"" - ends with D.\n\n""FINED"" - ends with D.\n\nThis is proving difficult. Let\'s try ""DUNAN"" - but D, U, N, A, N - U is allowed, but N is in 4 and 5, A in 4 - conflicting positions.\n\nActually, the pattern is strictly _ _ A _ N with N in 4 and A not in 2.\n\nLooking for valid words:\n- ""CABAN"" - has A in 2 and 3 - invalid.\n- ""GABAN"" - same.\n- ""HABAN"" - same.\n- ""KABAN"" - same.\n- ""MABAN"" - same.\n- ""WABAN"" - same.\n- ""DABAN"" - same.\n- ""FABAN"" - same.\n- ""JABAN"" - same.\n\nThis suggests we might need to use a word with A in 1: A _ _ _ N.\n\nValid words starting with A, ending with N, avoiding ruled-out letters:\n- ""AGIAN"" - G, I, A, N - A in 1, G, I, A in 3, N in 4 - but has A in 1 and 3, N in 4. This seems possible.\n- ""AVIAN"" - A, V, I, A, N - A in 1 and 3, N in 4.\n- ""ACORN"" - O, R out.\n- ""AFRAN"" - R out.\n- ""AHUMAN"" - too long.\n- ""AXIALLY"" - too long.\n- ""AULIC"" - ends with C.\n\nBetween ""AGIAN"" and ""AVIAN"", ""AVIAN"" is more common. Let\'s use ""AVIAN"".\n\nBut ""AVIAN"" has A in 1 and 3 - we don\'t know if A appears twice. To maximize information, let\'s prefer a word with single A in 1: ""AGIAN"".\n\n""AGIAN"" is valid (though rare), and fits:\n- A in 1 (allowed, since A is not in 2)\n- G, I in positions 2 and 3\n- N in 4 (correct)\n- A in 5 - but this would have A in 1 and 5, which might be acceptable.\n\nHowever, ""AGIAN"" is less common. Let\'s try ""AVIAN"" despite the double A.\n\nBut to maximize information, let\'s try a word with A in 1 and distinct letters: ""AMMON"" - but O, M, N: O is out.\n\n""AWFUL"" - ends with L.\n\n""AXIALLY"" - too long.\n\nThis is proving very restrictive. Let\'s try ""CABAN"" despite the A in 2 - but A is not in 2, so invalid.\n\nWait, the key is that A is in the word somewhere, not necessarily only once. So ""CABAN"" has A in 3 and 2, but we know A is in wrong position in 2, so 3 is allowed. But ""CABAN"" has A in 2 and 3 - but feedback says A is in wrong position in 2, so 3 is allowed. However, ""CABAN"" is C-A-B-A-N, which has A in 2 and 3 - but we know A is not in 2, so this is invalid.\n\nThis is very tricky. Let\'s try ""KABAN"" - but same issue.\n\nActually, the simplest valid word seems ""KANAN"" - K A N A N:\n- N in 4 (correct)\n- A in 3 (allowed, since A is not in 2)\n- Avoids R, O, S, E, P, L, T\n- Uses allowed letters K, A, N\n\nThis is the best candidate.\n\nBut ""KANAN"" is a valid word (though rare), and fits all constraints.\n\nAnother option is ""MANAN"" - same pattern.\n\nLet\'s go with ""KANAN"".\n\nHowever, ""KANAN"" has N in 4 and 5, which might be acceptable.\n\nBut to maximize information, let\'s try a word with A in 1: ""AGIAN"".\n\n""AGIAN"" is A G I A N:\n- A in 1 (allowed)\n- G, I in positions 2,3\n- A in 4 - but N is in 4, so this is invalid.\n\nThis shows the difficulty. Let\'s re-express:\n\nWe need:\n- N in 4\n- A somewhere (not 2)\n- No R, O, S, E, P, L, T\n\nSo pattern is _ _ A _ N or A _ _ _ N.\n\nFor A _ _ _ N:\n- A must be in 1, and positions 2,3,4 must be from allowed letters, with 4 being N.\n\nSo A _ _ N - but word length is 5, so A _ _ _ N.\n\nPossible: A B C D N - but need valid word.\n\nValid words starting with A, ending with N:\n- ""ABACN"" - invalid\n- ""ABCEN"" - invalid\n- ""ABHAN"" - invalid\n- ""AFGAN"" - ends with N? No, ends with G.\n- ""AGAN"" - too short.\n- ""AHAN"" - too short.\n- ""AJAN"" - too short.\n- ""AKAN"" - too short.\n- ""AMAN"" - too short.\n- ""ANAN"" - too short.\n- ""AQUAN"" - ends with N? ""AQUAN"" is a word (relating to water), ends with N.\n\n""AQUAN"" is A Q U A N:\n- A in 1 (allowed)\n- Q, U in positions 2,3\n- A in 4 - but N is in 4, so invalid.\n\nThis is extremely restrictive. Let\'s try ""CABAN"" - but A is in 3, N in 4, and avoids ruled-out letters except it has A in 2 (invalid).\n\nGiven the constraints, the most viable word seems ""KANAN"" - K A N A N:\n- N in 4 (correct)\n- A in 3 (allowed)\n- Uses K, A, N (all allowed)\n- Avoids R, O, S, E, P, L, T\n\nThis is the best possible under the constraints.\n\nBut to ensure A is not in 2, let\'s try ""KANAN"".\n\nHowever, ""KANAN"" has A in 3 and 5, which might be acceptable.\n\nAfter careful consideration, ""KANAN"" seems to be the only valid word fitting all constraints. Let\'s use this.Based on the feedback:\n- N is confirmed in position 4.\n- A is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 (from previous guesses).\n- Letters R, O, S, E, P, L, T are ruled out.\n\nThe word must be of the form _ _ A _ N with A not in position 2, and all other letters from the remaining pool.\n\n<guess>KANAN</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: PLANT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) N(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: KANAN -> FEEDBACK: K(x) A(✓) N(✓) A(-) N(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Let\'s parse the new feedback carefully.\n\nGuess 3: KANAN  \nFeedback: K(x) A(✓) N(✓) A(-) N(-)\n\n1.
