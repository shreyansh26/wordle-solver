### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several letters at once. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give us good information about which letters are present in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in position 1 (it’s somewhere else).
- R is NOT in the word.
- O is NOT in the word.
- S is NOT in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (it’s somewhere else).

So we know:
- Letters to keep: A, E
- Letters to avoid: R, O, S
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels.

A good next guess would use the confirmed letters A and E, and introduce new common consonants and vowels. Let’s try “TALKE”:
- T: new consonant, hasn’t been tested.
- A: confirmed in word, not in position 2 (from AROSE feedback A(-) means it’s not in position 1, so position 2 is possible).
- L: new consonant.
- K: new consonant.
- E: confirmed in word, not in position 5 (so position 4 is possible).

This should help us narrow down positions for A and E while testing new letters.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

How about “CABIN”? Contains A and E? No E. “CAMEO”? Contains O (already ruled out). “HABIT”? No E. “MAFIA”? No E. “PAINS”? Contains S (ruled out). “PEACH”? Contains A and E, uses P, C, H.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several letters at once. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give us good information about which letters are present in the secret word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in position 1 (it’s somewhere else).
- R is NOT in the word.
- O is NOT in the word.
- S is NOT in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (it’s somewhere else).

So we know:
- Letters to keep: A, E
- Letters to avoid: R, O, S
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels.

A good next guess would use the confirmed letters A and E, and introduce new common consonants and vowels. Let’s try “TALKE”:
- T: new consonant, hasn’t been tested.
- A: confirmed in word, not in position 2 (from AROSE feedback A(-) means it’s not in position 1, so position 2 is possible).
- L: new consonant.
- K: new consonant.
- E: confirmed in word, not in position 5 (so position 4 is possible).

This should help us narrow down positions for A and E while testing new letters.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a word that:
- Contains A and E.
- Doesn’t use R, O, S, T, L, K.
- A cannot be in position 1 or 2.
- E cannot be in position 4 or 5.

Let’s try a word like “CANE” but it’s 4 letters. Need 5 letters.

How about “CABIN”? Contains A and E? No E. “CAMEO”? Contains O (already ruled out). “HABIT”? No E. “MAFIA”? No E. “PAINS”? Contains S (ruled out). “PEACH”? Contains A and E, uses P, C, H.

Check positions:
- P: new
- E: position 2 (allowed, since E is only ruled out for 4,5)
- A: position 3 (allowed, since A is only ruled out for 1,2)

- A must be in position 5 (only remaining spot).
- Need two new letters for positions 1 and 3 from remaining pool.

Remaining possible letters (not yet ruled out): B, F, G, I, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try a word that fits _ E _ C A with new letters. A good candidate is “M E _ C A”. The missing letter in position 3 must be a consonant not yet used. Let’s try “M E B C A” – but “MEBCA” isn’t a valid word. Next: “M E F C A” – also invalid. How about “V E R C A”? R is ruled out. “M E R C A” – R ruled out. “M E G C A” – not a word. “B E G C A” – not a word. “F E G C A” – not a word. “W E G C A” – not a word. “Y E G C A” – not a word.

Wait, let’s think of valid 5-letter words that fit _ E _ C A. Some possibilities:
- BEGUM – but U and M are possible, and B is possible. Let’s check: B E G U M – but C is in position 4, so this doesn’t fit _ E _ C A.
- How about “B E G C A”? Not a valid word.
- “F E G C A”? Not valid.
- “M E G C A”? Not valid.
- “V E R C A”? R ruled out.
- “W E G C A”? Not valid.
- “M E T C A”? T ruled out.
- “B E T C A”? T ruled out.
- “F E T C A”? T ruled out.

Hmm, let’s list valid 5-letter words with pattern _ E _ C A:
- “BENCH” – H ruled out.
- “MECCA” – fits! M, E, C, C, A. But C is already in position 4, so this would have C in position 3 as well, but our feedback shows C is in position 4 only. However, MECCA has C twice, which might be allowed since letters can repeat unless ruled out. But we haven’t seen any rules against repeated letters.

Wait, MECCA is a valid word: M E C C A. Let’s check:
- M: new, allowed.
- E: position 2 (✓).
- C: position 3 – but we know C is in position 4 (✓). So this would have C in both 3 and 4, which might not match the secret word structure unless it’s allowed. The feedback doesn’t prohibit repeated letters, so MECCA could be possible.

Another candidate: “KECCA”? K ruled out.
“FECCA”? Not a word.
“GECCA”? Not a word.
“YECCA”? Not a word.

MECCA seems the best fit among valid words.

Let me verify:
- MECCA: M E C C A
- Positions:
  1. M – new, allowed.
  2. E – in correct position (✓).
  3. C – word has C here, but our feedback only confirms C in position 4. This might not match.
  
Actually, the secret word could have C in both positions 3 and 4, as the feedback doesn’t prevent duplicates. MECCA is a valid word and fits the _ E _ C A pattern with the known letters.

Therefore, I’ll guess MECCA.

- “MECCA” – fits! M, E, C, C, A. But C is already in position 4, so this would have C in position 3 as well, but our feedback shows C is in position 4 only. However, MECCA has C twice, which might be allowed since letters can repeat unless ruled out. But we haven’t seen any rules against repeated letters.

Wait, MECCA is a valid word: M E C C A. Let’s check:
- M: new, allowed.
- E: position 2 (✓).
- C: position 3 – but we know C is in position 4 (✓). So this would have C in both 3 and 4, which might not match the secret word structure unless it’s allowed. The feedback doesn’t prohibit repeated letters, so MECCA could be possible.

Another candidate: “KECCA”? K ruled out.
“FECCA”? Not a word.
“GECCA”? Not a word.
“YECCA”? Not a word.

MECCA seems the best fit among valid words.

Let me verify:
- MECCA: M E C C A
- Positions:
  1. M – new, allowed.
  2. E – in correct position (✓).
  3. C – word has C here, but our feedback only confirms C in position 4. This might not match.
  
Actually, the secret word could have C in both positions 3 and 4, as the feedback doesn’t prevent duplicates. MECCA is a valid word and fits the _ E _ C A pattern with the known letters.

Therefore, I’ll guess MECCA.",Guess 5: MECCA -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) E(✓) C(✓) C(✓) A(✓),SUCCESS
