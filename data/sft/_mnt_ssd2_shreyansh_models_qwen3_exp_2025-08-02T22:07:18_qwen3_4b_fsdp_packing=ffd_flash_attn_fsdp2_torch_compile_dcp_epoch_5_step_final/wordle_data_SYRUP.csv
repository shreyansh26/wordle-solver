For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several letters at once. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should cover several of these. 

Some popular starting words are:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (another common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but not in the 1st position (-)
- A, I, E are not in the word at all (x)
- S is in the word but not in the 4th position (-)

So we know:
- The word contains R and S, but not A, I, E.
- R is not in position 1, S is not in position 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R and S
2. Does not contain A, I, E
3. R not in position 1, S not in position 4

Good letters to try next: T, N, L, C, D, U, O, etc.

Let’s try to pick a word that places R and S in new positions and uses other common letters.

Candidate words:
- STORM: contains S and R, but has A (no), I (no), E (no) – but O and T are new. However, A is in RAISE feedback as x, so A is excluded. STORM has no A, I, E – good. Also, S is in position 1 (new), R in 2 (new). This seems good.
- ROUND: has R and S? No S. Not good.
- CRUST: has R and S, no A/I/E. R in 2, S in 4 (but S cannot be in 4 from feedback). So CRUST is bad because S is in 4th position.
- SPORT: has R and S, no A/I/E. S in 1, R in 3. This seems good too.

Between STORM and SPORT:
- STORM: S in 1, R in 2
- SPORT: S in 1, R in 3

Both are valid. STORM uses O and T, SPORT uses P and T. Let’s pick STORM as it introduces O and T, which are common.

But wait: in RAISE, E was in position 5, and feedback said E is not in word (x). So position 5 is safe for E, but E is not in word. So STORM has no A/I/E, good.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should cover several of these. 

Some popular starting words are:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (another common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but not in the 1st position (-)
- A, I, E are not in the word at all (x)
- S is in the word but not in the 4th position (-)

So we know:
- The word contains R and S, but not A, I, E.
- R is not in position 1, S is not in position 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R and S
2. Does not contain A, I, E
3. R not in position 1, S not in position 4

Good letters to try next: T, N, L, C, D, U, O, etc.

Let’s try to pick a word that places R and S in new positions and uses other common letters.

Candidate words:
- STORM: contains S and R, but has A (no), I (no), E (no) – but O and T are new. However, A is in RAISE feedback as x, so A is excluded. STORM has no A, I, E – good. Also, S is in position 1 (new), R in 2 (new). This seems good.
- ROUND: has R and S? No S. Not good.
- CRUST: has R and S, no A/I/E. R in 2, S in 4 (but S cannot be in 4 from feedback). So CRUST is bad because S is in 4th position.
- SPORT: has R and S, no A/I/E. S in 1, R in 3. This seems good too.

Between STORM and SPORT:
- STORM: S in 1, R in 2
- SPORT: S in 1, R in 3

Both are valid. STORM uses O and T, SPORT uses P and T. Let’s pick STORM as it introduces O and T, which are common.

But wait: in RAISE, E was in position 5, and feedback said E is not in word (x). So position 5 is safe for E, but E is not in word. So STORM has no A/I/E, good.

Final choice: STORM

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STORM -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 – RAISE  
R(-)  A(x)  I(x)  S(-)  E(x)

Round 2 – STORM  
S(✓)  T(x)  O(x)  R(-)  M(x)

What we now know:

1. S is in the word and is in the correct position (position 1).
2. R is in the word but NOT in position 1 or 4.
3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, I, E, T, O, M.
4. Therefore the remaining letters must come from the unused alphabet excluding those six.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S (because S is confirmed in position 1).
- Contains R somewhere other than positions 1 or 4.
- Contains no A, I, E, T, O, M.

Good remaining consonants: N, L, D, C, H, G, B, F, K, P, U, Y, W, etc.
Good remaining vowels: U (since A, E, I, O are excluded).

Candidate structure: S _ _ _ _
We need to place R somewhere in positions 2, 3 or 5 (since 1 and 4 are excluded).

Let’s list possible patterns:
- S R _ _ _
- S _ R _ _
- S _ _ _ R

We’ll look for common words that fit these patterns and use only the allowed letters.

Examples:
- S R _ _ _ : “SURGE” has U (allowed), R in 2, but G and E: E is excluded. “SUPER” has E (excluded). “SHRUB” has H, R in 3, U, B. No excluded letters. “SHRUB” is valid.
- S _ R _ _ : “SUGAR” has A (excluded). “SURPR” not valid. “SPRUG” not a word.
- S _ _ _ R : “SNUGR” not valid. “SWUGR” not valid. “SPRUR” not valid.

The best candidate seems “SHRUB”:
- S in position 1 (confirmed).
- R in position 3 (allowed).
- Letters used: S, H, R, U, B – none of which are excluded.
- It’s a valid English word.

Let’s verify:
- S(✓) in position 1.
- R in position 3 (allowed, since feedback only said R not in 1 or 4).
- No A, I, E, T, O, M.

Therefore, “SHRUB” is a strong next guess.

From the feedback so far:

Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): C, D, F, G, K, L, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible combinations for positions 2 and 5:

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several letters at once. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should cover several of these. 

Some popular starting words are:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (another common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but not in the 1st position (-)
- A, I, E are not in the word at all (x)
- S is in the word but not in the 4th position (-)

So we know:
- The word contains R and S, but not A, I, E.
- R is not in position 1, S is not in position 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R and S
2. Does not contain A, I, E
3. R not in position 1, S not in position 4

Good letters to try next: T, N, L, C, D, U, O, etc.

Let’s try to pick a word that places R and S in new positions and uses other common letters.

Candidate words:
- STORM: contains S and R, but has A (no), I (no), E (no) – but O and T are new. However, A is in RAISE feedback as x, so A is excluded. STORM has no A, I, E – good. Also, S is in position 1 (new), R in 2 (new). This seems good.
- ROUND: has R and S? No S. Not good.
- CRUST: has R and S, no A/I/E. R in 2, S in 4 (but S cannot be in 4 from feedback). So CRUST is bad because S is in 4th position.
- SPORT: has R and S, no A/I/E. S in 1, R in 3. This seems good too.

Between STORM and SPORT:
- STORM: S in 1, R in 2
- SPORT: S in 1, R in 3

Both are valid. STORM uses O and T, SPORT uses P and T. Let’s pick STORM as it introduces O and T, which are common.

But wait: in RAISE, E was in position 5, and feedback said E is not in word (x). So position 5 is safe for E, but E is not in word. So STORM has no A/I/E, good.

Final choice: STORM

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STORM -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 – RAISE  
R(-)  A(x)  I(x)  S(-)  E(x)

Round 2 – STORM  
S(✓)  T(x)  O(x)  R(-)  M(x)

What we now know:

1. S is in the word and is in the correct position (position 1).
2. R is in the word but NOT in position 1 or 4.
3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, I, E, T, O, M.
4. Therefore the remaining letters must come from the unused alphabet excluding those six.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S (because S is confirmed in position 1).
- Contains R somewhere other than positions 1 or 4.
- Contains no A, I, E, T, O, M.

Good remaining consonants: N, L, D, C, H, G, B, F, K, P, U, Y, W, etc.
Good remaining vowels: U (since A, E, I, O are excluded).

Candidate structure: S _ _ _ _
We need to place R somewhere in positions 2, 3 or 5 (since 1 and 4 are excluded).

Let’s list possible patterns:
- S R _ _ _
- S _ R _ _
- S _ _ _ R

We’ll look for common words that fit these patterns and use only the allowed letters.

Examples:
- S R _ _ _ : “SURGE” has U (allowed), R in 2, but G and E: E is excluded. “SUPER” has E (excluded). “SHRUB” has H, R in 3, U, B. No excluded letters. “SHRUB” is valid.
- S _ R _ _ : “SUGAR” has A (excluded). “SURPR” not valid. “SPRUG” not a word.
- S _ _ _ R : “SNUGR” not valid. “SWUGR” not valid. “SPRUR” not valid.

The best candidate seems “SHRUB”:
- S in position 1 (confirmed).
- R in position 3 (allowed).
- Letters used: S, H, R, U, B – none of which are excluded.
- It’s a valid English word.

Let’s verify:
- S(✓) in position 1.
- R in position 3 (allowed, since feedback only said R not in 1 or 4).
- No A, I, E, T, O, M.

Therefore, “SHRUB” is a strong next guess.

4. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, I, E, T, O, M, H, B.
5. Therefore the word has the pattern: S _ R U _

We still need to determine the second and fifth letters.  
Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): C, D, F, G, K, L, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible combinations for positions 2 and 5:
- Position 2: any allowed consonant or vowel (but U is already in 4, so vowels left: none, since A, E, I, O are out and U is used).
- Position 5: any allowed consonant.

Looking at common English words that fit S _ R U _:

- SCRUB – but B is out.
- SPRUG – not a valid word.
- STRUM – M is out.
- SPURS – S is already used in position 1, and duplicate S may or may not be allowed (but word is valid).
- SWIRU – not a word.
- SGRUs – not a word.
- SCURF – F is allowed, but is SCURF a word? It’s obscure.
- SQUIR – not a word.
- SNUFF – F is allowed, but H is out, so N in 2 and F in 5: S N R U F – “SNRUF” not a word.
- SKRUG – not a word.
- SLURP – P is allowed, and SLURP is a valid word.

SLURP fits:
- S(✓) _ R U P(✓)
- Letters used: S, L, R, U, P – none of which are excluded.
- It’s a valid English word.

From the latest feedback on SCRUP:

Position 1: S(✓) – locked in place.  
Position 2: C(x) – C is NOT in the word.  
Position 3: R(✓) – R is correctly placed here.  
Position 4: U(✓) – U is correctly placed here.  
Position 5: P(✓) – P is locked in place.

So the pattern is now:

S _ R U P

We only need to determine the second letter.  
Letters already ruled out entirely: A, I, E, T, O, M, H, B, L, C.  
Letters still allowed in position 2: D, F, G, K, N, V, W, Y, etc.

The only common 5-letter English word that fits S _ R U P is:

S N R U P   →   SNRUP is not valid.  
Wait… let me double-check:  
SCRUP – ruled out (C).  
SFRUP – not a word.  
SGRUP – not a word.  
SKRUP – not a word.  
SNRUP – not a word.  
SPRUP – not a word.  
SWRUP – not a word.  
SYRUP – valid word!

SYRUP fits the pattern S _ R U P with Y in position 2, and Y has not been excluded.  
Therefore, SYRUP must be the secret word.
