### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains common letters: S, L, A, T, E. These letters cover several frequent consonants and two common vowels. This should give me good information about which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That means I should completely avoid those letters and look for a word that uses entirely different characters.  
A good second-guess strategy is still to use common consonants and vowels that weren’t tried yet.  
The remaining common letters include R, I, N, C, O, U, M, P, etc.  
A balanced word that uses none of the eliminated letters is “CRIMP” (C, R, I, M, P).  
It contains:
- C and R (common consonants)
- I (common vowel)
- M and P (other frequent consonants)

This should give fresh coverage of the alphabet while avoiding the five already ruled out.

We now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, M, P  
- Letter I is in the word and is in position 3 (I✓).

So the pattern so far is:
_ _ I _ _

We still need to test other common vowels (O, U) and consonants that haven’t been ruled out (N, D, G, H, K, B, F, etc.).

A good next guess should:
1. Keep I in position 3.
2. Use new consonants and vowels.
3. Avoid all previously eliminated letters.

A strong candidate is “DINER”:
- D, N, E, R have not been eliminated yet (E was eliminated in guess 1, so we must avoid E).
Wait, E was already eliminated (from guess 1), so DINER is invalid.

Next candidate: “HINKY” – but Y is less common and K is untested.
Better candidate: “BINGO” – but G and O are new, and B is new.
But I is already in position 3, so “BINGO” would place I in position 2, which is wrong.

Next: “WINKY” – W, N, K, Y are new, but Y is less common.
Better: “FUNKY” – F, U, N, K, Y. U is a new vowel, others are new consonants.

But let’s try a more balanced word: “HOUND” – but D is new, O, U, N are new, H is new. However, I must be in position 3, so this is invalid.

Realizing that I must be in position 3, let’s construct a word around that:
_ _ I _ _

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s pick a word that uses common letters in these positions. A good choice is “DINGO”:
- D, N, G, O are new.
- I is correctly in position 3.

This seems optimal.

Keep I in position 3.\n2. Use new consonants and vowels.\n3. Avoid all previously eliminated letters.\n\nA strong candidate is “DINER”:\n- D, N, E, R have not been eliminated yet (E was eliminated in guess 1, so we must avoid E).\nWait, E was already eliminated (from guess 1), so DINER is invalid.\n\nNext candidate: “HINKY” – but Y is less common and K is untested.\nBetter candidate: “BINGO” – but G and O are new, and B is new.\nBut I is already in position 3, so “BINGO” would place I in position 2, which is wrong.\n\nNext: “WINKY” – W, N, K, Y are new, but Y is less common.\nBetter: “FUNKY” – F, U, N, K, Y. U is a new vowel, others are new consonants.\n\nBut let’s try a more balanced word: “HOUND” – but D is new, O, U, N are new, H is new. However, I must be in position 3, so this is invalid.\n\nRealizing that I must be in position 3, let’s construct a word around that:\n_ _ I _ _\n\nCommon letters left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nLet’s pick a word that uses common letters in these positions. A good choice is “DINGO”:\n- D, N, G, O are new.\n- I is correctly in position 3.\n\nThis seems optimal.\n\n<guess>DINGO</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: CRIMP -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) I(✓) M(x) P(x)\nGuess 3: DINGO -> FEEDBACK: D(x) I(-) N(-) G(x) O(x)\n'}]","<think>
The feedback from the three guesses so far:

- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, M, P, D, G, O  
- Letter I is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from DINGO feedback: I(-)).
- Letters N and I are in the word but in wrong positions (from DINGO feedback: N(-) and I(-)).
  Actually, re-reading the feedback:  
  D(x) I(-) N(-) G(x) O(x)  
  This means:
  – I is in the word, but NOT in position 2.
  – N is in the word, but NOT in position 3.
  – D, G, O are not in the word.

We know:
- I is somewhere else (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5).
- N is somewhere else (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- Remaining unused common letters: B, F, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both I and N.
2. Places I not in position 2.
3. Places N not in position 3.
4. Uses only letters that haven’t been eliminated.

A good candidate is “UNIFY”:
- U, F, Y are new letters.
- I is in position 3 (not 2), N is in position 2 (not 3).
- All letters are unused so far.

Let’s check:
- U – unused
- N – in word, position 2 (allowed)
- I – in word, position 3 (allowed)
- F – unused
- Y – unused

This seems like a strong next guess.
