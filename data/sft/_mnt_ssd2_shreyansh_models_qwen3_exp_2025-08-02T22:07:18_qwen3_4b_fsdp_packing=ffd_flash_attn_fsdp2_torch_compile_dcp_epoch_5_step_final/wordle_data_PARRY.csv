### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, U, and I. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common)
- A (most common letter)
- T (common)
- E (most common letter)

This gives us a good spread of vowels and consonants to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are not in the word at all (x)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- contains A (but not in position 3)
- does NOT contain S, L, T, E

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. has A somewhere other than the third position
2. does not use S, L, T, E

Good remaining consonants to try: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F, K, etc.
Good vowels to try: I, O, U (since A is already confirmed and E is out)

A good second guess should introduce new common letters while respecting the constraints. ""CHARD"" is a good choice because:
- C, H, R, D are new letters
- A is used in a different position (position 2)
- Avoids all eliminated letters (S, L, T, E)

This should give us more information about which of C, H, R, D are present and where A can go.

Let’s summarize the constraints so far.

Letters we now know are NOT in the word (x):
S, L, T, E, C, H, D, B, I, N

Letters we know ARE in the word:
- R – must be in position 4 (from CHARD feedback: R✓ in 4th spot)
- A – must be somewhere, but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (from SLATE and CHARD).  
  Therefore A must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

So the word pattern is:  
[1] [2] [3] R [5]  
with A in 1, 2, or 5 and the remaining two slots filled from the still-allowed letters.

Still-allowed consonants (common ones): M, P, F, K, V, W, G, Y, etc.  
Still-allowed vowels (since A, I, E are ruled out): O, U.

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits:
- R in position 4.
- A in 1, 2, or 5.
- Uses only letters not yet excluded.

A good candidate is “GAROT” – but O and T are already excluded (T from SLATE, O from BRAIN).  
Try “FARMY” – but Y is allowed, M is allowed, but we don’t know F or M yet.  
A safer choice is “MARRY” – but double R and Y issues.  
Better: “PAPAW” – but W is allowed, P is allowed, but double A and we don’t know if double letters are possible.  
Another candidate: “FARMY” – but again, F and M are untested.

A simple, valid word that fits is “FARMY” – but let’s pick one with distinct new letters: “PARKY” – but K and Y are new, P is new, A is in position 2, R in 4, K in 5.  
However, “PARKY” has K in 5, Y in 5 – but we need 5 distinct positions.

Actually, let’s try “FARMY” – but again, F and M are new.

A better fit is “GAROT” – but O and T are excluded.  
Next: “WARTY” – but T is excluded.  
Next: “VAPOR” – but O and P are new, A in 2, R in 4, V in 1, O in 3. But O is allowed, V is allowed.  
But O is allowed, V is allowed, and this word is valid.

But we need to avoid O if possible? No, O wasn’t excluded.  
But we know A must be in 1, 2, or 5.  
Let’s try “VAPOR” – A is in 2, R in 4, V in 1, O in 3, P in 5.  
But we don’t know if O is allowed – but it wasn’t excluded.  
But we have no info against O.

A safer choice is “FARMY” – but again, F and M are new.

Actually, let’s try “PAPAW” – but double A is possible, but we don’t know.  
Better: “VAPID” – but D is excluded.

Let’s try “FARMY” – but again, F and M are new.

A better candidate is “VAPOR” – but O is allowed, V is allowed, P is allowed.

But let’s try “WARMY” – W, M, Y are new, A in 2, R in 4.

But we have no info against W, M, Y.

Actually, let’s try “VAPOR” – valid word, uses new letters V, O, P, A in 2, R in 4.

But we have no info against O.  
However, we know A must be in 1, 2, or 5.  
Let’s try “VAPOR” – A is in 2, which is allowed.

But we have no info against O, so this is acceptable.

Another candidate: “WARMY” – W, M, Y are new, A in 2, R in 4.

Between these, “VAPOR” seems reasonable.

But let’s pick “FARMY” – F, M, Y are new, A in 2, R in 4.

Actually, let’s pick “WARMY” – W, M, Y are new, A in 2, R in 4.

But “WARMY” is not a common word.  
A better common word is “VAPOR”.

Let’s go with “VAPOR”.

- Word pattern: _ _ _ R _ (R is fixed in 4th position).
- A must appear in 1, 2, or 5 (cannot be 3 or 4).
- Letters definitely absent: S, L, T, E, C, H, D, B, I, N.

A valid word that fits these rules is “VAPOR”:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, U, and I. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common)
- A (most common letter)
- T (common)
- E (most common letter)

This gives us a good spread of vowels and consonants to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are not in the word at all (x)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- contains A (but not in position 3)
- does NOT contain S, L, T, E

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. has A somewhere other than the third position
2. does not use S, L, T, E

Good remaining consonants to try: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F, K, etc.
Good vowels to try: I, O, U (since A is already confirmed and E is out)

A good second guess should introduce new common letters while respecting the constraints. ""CHARD"" is a good choice because:
- C, H, R, D are new letters
- A is used in a different position (position 2)
- Avoids all eliminated letters (S, L, T, E)

This should give us more information about which of C, H, R, D are present and where A can go.

Let’s re-express everything we now know.

Letters definitely NOT in the word (x):
S, L, T, E, C, H, D, B, I, N, V, O

Letters definitely IN the word:
- R – must be in position 4 (from CHARD feedback: R✓ in 4th spot)
- A – must be somewhere, and now we see it is in position 2 (A✓).  
  Therefore A is fixed in position 2.

So the word pattern is: _ A _ R _ 

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out) to fill positions 1, 3, 5:
Consonants: F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels: none left except possibly U (since A is already used)

We also know from Guess 4 (VAPOR) that:
- P is in the word but not in position 3 (P-).  
  Therefore P must be in position 1 or 5.

Let’s list possible consonants for each slot:

Position 1: could be P, F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z  
Position 3: could be any allowed consonant except P (since P is not in 3)  
Position 5: could be P (since P could be in 5) or any other allowed consonant

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits _ A _ R _ with P in 1 or 5.

Possible candidates:
- P A _ R _ → PAR_ _ → “PARSE” but E is out, “PARTY” but T is out, “PARKS” but S, K, T are out.
- _ A _ R P → _ A _ R P → “FARPS” – invalid, “GARPS” – invalid, “JARPS” – invalid, “MARPS” – invalid, “PARMS” – S is out, “WARPS” – S is out, “YARPS” – invalid.

Wait, let’s think of actual words:
- _ A _ R P → “FARMP” – invalid, “GARMP” – invalid, “JARMP” – invalid, “MARCP” – invalid, “PARCH” – H is out, “PARDY” – D is out, “PARAP” – invalid, “WARMY” – M is allowed, Y is allowed, but 4th letter must be R, so “WARMY” would be W A R M Y – but 4th letter is M, not R.  
Wait, pattern is _ A _ R _ so:
- W A R M Y – 4th letter is M, not R.  
We need 4th letter R.

So valid pattern: _ A _ R _ with P in 1 or 5.

Real words that fit:
- P A R K _ – but K is allowed, and P is in 1, R in 4, A in 2, K in 3, so “PARK_” – but 5th letter must be consonant not yet used.  
“PARKY” – Y is allowed, K is allowed.  
Check letters: P, A, R, K, Y. None are excluded except possibly Y – but Y is allowed.  
“PARKY” is a valid word.

Let’s verify:
- P is allowed (not excluded), A is in 2 (✓), R is in 4 (✓ from CHARD), K is allowed, Y is allowed.  
- No excluded letters.

Another candidate: “FARMP” – invalid.  
“GARMP” – invalid.  
“JARMP” – invalid.  
“MARCP” – invalid.  
“WARMP” – invalid.  
“YARMP” – invalid.  
So “PARKY” seems the best.

But let’s check if P is allowed in position 1 – yes, P is not excluded.  
And K and Y are not excluded.  
Thus “PARKY” fits all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, U, and I. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common)
- A (most common letter)
- T (common)
- E (most common letter)

This gives us a good spread of vowels and consonants to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are not in the word at all (x)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- contains A (but not in position 3)
- does NOT contain S, L, T, E

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. has A somewhere other than the third position
2. does not use S, L, T, E

Good remaining consonants to try: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F, K, etc.
Good vowels to try: I, O, U (since A is already confirmed and E is out)

A good second guess should introduce new common letters while respecting the constraints. ""CHARD"" is a good choice because:
- C, H, R, D are new letters
- A is used in a different position (position 2)
- Avoids all eliminated letters (S, L, T, E)

This should give us more information about which of C, H, R, D are present and where A can go.

Current constraints:
- A is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 (from both guesses).
- R is in the word and in the correct 4th position.
- Letters definitely absent: S, L, T, E, C, H, D.

So the word looks like: _ _ _ R _ with A somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 5.

Remaining common consonants to try: N, M, P, B, G, F, K, V, W, Y.
Remaining vowels to try: I, O, U.

We need a word that:
- has R in position 4.
- has A not in positions 3 or 4 (so A could be 1, 2, or 5).
- avoids all excluded letters (S, L, T, E, C, H, D).

A good candidate is ""BRAIN"":
- B, I, N are new letters.
- A is in position 2 (valid since it's not 3 or 4).
- R is in position 4 (matches ✓).
- Uses common letters to test new possibilities.

Let’s summarize the constraints so far.

Letters we now know are NOT in the word (x):
S, L, T, E, C, H, D, B, I, N

Letters we know ARE in the word:
- R – must be in position 4 (from CHARD feedback: R✓ in 4th spot)
- A – must be somewhere, but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (from SLATE and CHARD).  
  Therefore A must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

So the word pattern is:  
[1] [2] [3] R [5]  
with A in 1, 2, or 5 and the remaining two slots filled from the still-allowed letters.

Still-allowed consonants (common ones): M, P, F, K, V, W, G, Y, etc.  
Still-allowed vowels (since A, I, E are ruled out): O, U.

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits:
- R in position 4.
- A in 1, 2, or 5.
- Uses only letters not yet excluded.

A good candidate is “GAROT” – but O and T are already excluded (T from SLATE, O from BRAIN).  
Try “FARMY” – but Y is allowed, M is allowed, but we don’t know F or M yet.  
A safer choice is “MARRY” – but double R and Y issues.  
Better: “PAPAW” – but W is allowed, P is allowed, but double A and we don’t know if double letters are possible.  
Another candidate: “FARMY” – but again, F and M are untested.

A simple, valid word that fits is “FARMY” – but let’s pick one with distinct new letters: “PARKY” – but K and Y are new, P is new, A is in position 2, R in 4, K in 5.  
However, “PARKY” has K in 5, Y in 5 – but we need 5 distinct positions.

Actually, let’s try “FARMY” – but again, F and M are new.

A better fit is “GAROT” – but O and T are excluded.  
Next: “WARTY” – but T is excluded.  
Next: “VAPOR” – but O and P are new, A in 2, R in 4, V in 1, O in 3. But O is allowed, V is allowed.  
But O is allowed, V is allowed, and this word is valid.

But we need to avoid O if possible? No, O wasn’t excluded.  
But we know A must be in 1, 2, or 5.  
Let’s try “VAPOR” – A is in 2, R in 4, V in 1, O in 3, P in 5.  
But we don’t know if O is allowed – but it wasn’t excluded.  
But we have no info against O.

A safer choice is “FARMY” – but again, F and M are new.

Actually, let’s try “PAPAW” – but double A is possible, but we don’t know.  
Better: “VAPID” – but D is excluded.

Let’s try “FARMY” – but again, F and M are new.

A better candidate is “VAPOR” – but O is allowed, V is allowed, P is allowed.

But let’s try “WARMY” – W, M, Y are new, A in 2, R in 4.

But we have no info against W, M, Y.

Actually, let’s try “VAPOR” – valid word, uses new letters V, O, P, A in 2, R in 4.

But we have no info against O.  
However, we know A must be in 1, 2, or 5.  
Let’s try “VAPOR” – A is in 2, which is allowed.

But we have no info against O, so this is acceptable.

Another candidate: “WARMY” – W, M, Y are new, A in 2, R in 4.

Between these, “VAPOR” seems reasonable.

But let’s pick “FARMY” – F, M, Y are new, A in 2, R in 4.

Actually, let’s pick “WARMY” – W, M, Y are new, A in 2, R in 4.

But “WARMY” is not a common word.  
A better common word is “VAPOR”.

Let’s go with “VAPOR”.Current constraints:
- Word pattern: _ _ _ R _ (R is fixed in 4th position).
- A must appear in 1, 2, or 5 (cannot be 3 or 4).
- Letters definitely absent: S, L, T, E, C, H, D, B, I, N.

A valid word that fits these rules is “VAPOR”:
- V, O, P are new letters.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- R is in position 4 (matches ✓).

Let’s re-express everything we now know.

Letters definitely NOT in the word (x):
S, L, T, E, C, H, D, B, I, N, V, O

Letters definitely IN the word:
- R – must be in position 4 (from CHARD feedback: R✓ in 4th spot)
- A – must be somewhere, and now we see it is in position 2 (A✓).  
  Therefore A is fixed in position 2.

So the word pattern is: _ A _ R _ 

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out) to fill positions 1, 3, 5:
Consonants: F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels: none left except possibly U (since A is already used)

We also know from Guess 4 (VAPOR) that:
- P is in the word but not in position 3 (P-).  
  Therefore P must be in position 1 or 5.

Let’s list possible consonants for each slot:

Position 1: could be P, F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z  
Position 3: could be any allowed consonant except P (since P is not in 3)  
Position 5: could be P (since P could be in 5) or any other allowed consonant

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits _ A _ R _ with P in 1 or 5.

Possible candidates:
- P A _ R _ → PAR_ _ → “PARSE” but E is out, “PARTY” but T is out, “PARKS” but S, K, T are out.
- _ A _ R P → _ A _ R P → “FARPS” – invalid, “GARPS” – invalid, “JARPS” – invalid, “MARPS” – invalid, “PARMS” – S is out, “WARPS” – S is out, “YARPS” – invalid.

Wait, let’s think of actual words:
- _ A _ R P → “FARMP” – invalid, “GARMP” – invalid, “JARMP” – invalid, “MARCP” – invalid, “PARCH” – H is out, “PARDY” – D is out, “PARAP” – invalid, “WARMY” – M is allowed, Y is allowed, but 4th letter must be R, so “WARMY” would be W A R M Y – but 4th letter is M, not R.  
Wait, pattern is _ A _ R _ so:
- W A R M Y – 4th letter is M, not R.  
We need 4th letter R.

So valid pattern: _ A _ R _ with P in 1 or 5.

Real words that fit:
- P A R K _ – but K is allowed, and P is in 1, R in 4, A in 2, K in 3, so “PARK_” – but 5th letter must be consonant not yet used.  
“PARKY” – Y is allowed, K is allowed.  
Check letters: P, A, R, K, Y. None are excluded except possibly Y – but Y is allowed.  
“PARKY” is a valid word.

Let’s verify:
- P is allowed (not excluded), A is in 2 (✓), R is in 4 (✓ from CHARD), K is allowed, Y is allowed.  
- No excluded letters.

Another candidate: “FARMP” – invalid.  
“GARMP” – invalid.  
“JARMP” – invalid.  
“MARCP” – invalid.  
“WARMP” – invalid.  
“YARMP” – invalid.  
So “PARKY” seems the best.

But let’s check if P is allowed in position 1 – yes, P is not excluded.  
And K and Y are not excluded.  
Thus “PARKY” fits all constraints.

We now have the following confirmed information:

1. Pattern: P A R _ Y  (positions 1, 2, 3, 5 are fixed)
2. Letter K is NOT in the word (x on PARKY).
3. All previously excluded letters remain excluded.

So the only unknown is the 4th letter (position 4), which must be:
- A consonant that has not yet been ruled out.
- A letter that forms a valid 5-letter word with the fixed sequence PAR-Y.

Letters still allowed (not yet excluded):
Consonants: F, G, J, M, Q, U, W, X, Z  
Vowels: none left (A is already used in position 2, and E, I, O are out).

Valid English 5-letter words that start with “PAR” and end with “Y”:
- PARTY (T is out, so invalid)
- PARCY (invalid, not common)
- PARRY (invalid, second R would duplicate but is okay; however, Y is already at 5, so this would be P A R R Y – but we know R is already in position 3, so double R is possible unless ruled out otherwise. However, no info rules out double R.)
- PARRY is actually valid, but let’s check letters: P, A, R, R, Y. All are allowed (R is allowed twice), and no excluded letters.

Is there any other? “PARSY” uses S (out). “PARMY” uses M (allowed) but not a common word. “PARFY” – F is allowed but not a word.

The only valid common word fitting is PARRY.

Let’s verify:
P(✓) A(✓) R(✓) R(?) Y(✓)  
R is allowed to appear again (no info says it can’t). Thus PARRY is the only logical guess.
