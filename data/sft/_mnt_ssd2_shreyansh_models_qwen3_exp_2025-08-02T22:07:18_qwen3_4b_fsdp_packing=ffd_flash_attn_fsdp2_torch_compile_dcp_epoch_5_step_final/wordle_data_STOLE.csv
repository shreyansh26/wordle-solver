### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most useful information possible. The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"" are popular choices for this reason.

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" covers S, L, A, T, E
- ""CRANE"" covers C, R, A, N, E
- ""ADIEU"" covers A, D, I, E, U

""SLATE"" seems particularly good because S and T are very common starting letters, and A and E are the most frequent vowels. L and N are also quite common. This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 → S _ _ _ _
- E is correct in position 5 → S _ _ _ E
- L is in the word but wrong position → L must be in positions 2, 3, or 4
- T is in the word but wrong position → T must be in positions 2, 3, or 4
- A is not in the word at all

So the pattern is:
S _ _ _ E with L and T somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4, and no A.

We need to try a word that keeps S and E fixed, places L and T in new positions, and introduces new common letters to test.

Good candidates:
- S L T _ E → SLT_E (but needs a valid word)
- S T _ L E → STELE (not a common word)
- S _ L T E → S LTE (not valid)
- S T L _ E → STLE_ (invalid)

Looking at valid words:
- S L I T E → SLITE (not a word)
- S T E L E → STELE (not common)
- S P L T E → SPLIT E (invalid)
- S C O T E → SCOTE (invalid)
- S H O T E → SHOTE (invalid)
- S L O T E → SLOTE (invalid)

STERE:

- T is in position 2 (was position 4 before, so new position)
- E is already confirmed
- R is new letter to test

This seems like a good next guess as it keeps S and E, moves T to position 2, and introduces R.

Round 2: STERE → S✓ T✓ E- R× E✓

What we now know for sure:

1. Fixed letters:  
   - S is first letter (position 1)  
   - E is last letter (position 5)  
   - T is second letter (position 2)  

   Pattern so far: S T _ _ E

2. Letters that are **not** in the word at all:  
   A, R

3. Letters that are in the word but in the **wrong** positions:  
   - L is in the word but **not** in position 2 (from SLATE).  
   - E was marked “-” in position 3 of STERE, meaning E is in the word but **not** in position 3. We already know E is fixed at position 5, so this simply confirms E is present and already locked.

4. Therefore the word must be of the form:  
   S T _ _ E  
   with the remaining two letters chosen from the unused common letters (excluding A and R).

Common unused letters (among those not yet tried): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know L must appear somewhere in the word (from feedback L-). Since L cannot be in position 2 (where T is), the only remaining possibility is position 3 or 4.

So possible patterns:  
- S T L _ E  
- S T _ L E

ST _ LE:

- STALE – invalid (A is excluded)  
- STULE – invalid  
- STYLE – valid (a line or mark on a surface)  

Between STILE and STYLE, both fit the constraints.  
STILE uses I and L; STYLE uses Y and L.  
We have not yet tested I or Y, so either is acceptable.

- ""SLATE"" covers S, L, A, T, E

- L is in the word but wrong position → L must be in positions 2, 3, or 4
- T is in the word but wrong position → T must be in positions 2, 3, or 4
- A is not in the word at all

So the pattern is:
S _ _ _ E with L and T somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4, and no A.

We need to try a word that keeps S and E fixed, places L and T in new positions, and introduces new common letters to test.

Good candidates:
- S L T _ E → SLT_E (but needs a valid word)
- S T _ L E → STELE (not a common word)
- S _ L T E → S LTE (not valid)
- S T L _ E → STLE_ (invalid)

Looking at valid words:
- S L I T E → SLITE (not a word)
- S T E L E → STELE (not common)
- S P L T E → SPLIT E (invalid)
- S C O T E → SCOTE (invalid)
- S H O T E → SHOTE (invalid)
- S L O T E → SLOTE (invalid)
- S P E L T → SPELT (invalid)
- S P I L T → SPI RT E (invalid)
- S P I T E → SPI TE (invalid)
- S P U T E → SPU TE (invalid)
- S T E L L → STELL (invalid)
- S T E L V → STELV (invalid)
- S T E L E → STELE (invalid)
- S T E P E → STEPE (invalid)
- S T E R E → STERE (valid word)

STERE:
- S _ _ _ E
- T is in position 2 (was position 4 before, so new position)
- E is already confirmed
- R is new letter to test
- R is new letter to test

This seems like a good next guess as it keeps S and E, moves T to position 2, and introduces R.

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: SLATE → S✓ L- A× T- E✓  
Round 2: STERE → S✓ T✓ E- R× E✓

What we now know for sure:

1. Fixed letters:  
   - S is first letter (position 1)  
   - E is last letter (position 5)  
   - T is second letter (position 2)  

   Pattern so far: S T _ _ E

2. Letters that are **not** in the word at all:  
   A, R

3. Letters that are in the word but in the **wrong** positions:  
   - L is in the word but **not** in position 2 (from SLATE).  
   - E was marked “-” in position 3 of STERE, meaning E is in the word but **not** in position 3. We already know E is fixed at position 5, so this simply confirms E is present and already locked.

4. Therefore the word must be of the form:  
   S T _ _ E  
   with the remaining two letters chosen from the unused common letters (excluding A and R).

Common unused letters (among those not yet tried): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know L must appear somewhere in the word (from feedback L-). Since L cannot be in position 2 (where T is), the only remaining possibility is position 3 or 4.

So possible patterns:  
- S T L _ E  
- S T _ L E  

Let’s list valid 5-letter words that fit these patterns:

STL _ E:  
- STLKE – invalid  
- STLME – invalid  
- STLPE – invalid  
- STLSE – invalid  

ST _ LE:  
- STILE – valid (a stone or wooden step)  
- STALE – invalid (A is excluded)  
- STULE – invalid  
- STYLE – valid (a line or mark on a surface)  

Between STILE and STYLE, both fit the constraints.  
STILE uses I and L; STYLE uses Y and L.  
We have not yet tested I or Y, so either is acceptable.

Let’s pick STILE to test I.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most useful information possible. The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"" are popular choices for this reason.

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" covers S, L, A, T, E
- ""CRANE"" covers C, R, A, N, E
- ""ADIEU"" covers A, D, I, E, U

""SLATE"" seems particularly good because S and T are very common starting letters, and A and E are the most frequent vowels. L and N are also quite common. This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(x) T(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 → S _ _ _ _
- E is correct in position 5 → S _ _ _ E
- L is in the word but wrong position → L must be in positions 2, 3, or 4
- T is in the word but wrong position → T must be in positions 2, 3, or 4
- A is not in the word at all

So the pattern is:
S _ _ _ E with L and T somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4, and no A.

We need to try a word that keeps S and E fixed, places L and T in new positions, and introduces new common letters to test.

Good candidates:
- S L T _ E → SLT_E (but needs a valid word)
- S T _ L E → STELE (not a common word)
- S _ L T E → S LTE (not valid)
- S T L _ E → STLE_ (invalid)

Looking at valid words:
- S L I T E → SLITE (not a word)
- S T E L E → STELE (not common)
- S P L T E → SPLIT E (invalid)
- S C O T E → SCOTE (invalid)
- S H O T E → SHOTE (invalid)
- S L O T E → SLOTE (invalid)
- S P E L T → SPELT (invalid)
- S P I L T → SPI RT E (invalid)
- S P I T E → SPI TE (invalid)
- S P U T E → SPU TE (invalid)
- S T E L L → STELL (invalid)
- S T E L V → STELV (invalid)
- S T E L E → STELE (invalid)
- S T E P E → STEPE (invalid)
- S T E R E → STERE (valid word)

STERE:
- S _ _ _ E
- T is in position 2 (was position 4 before, so new position)
- E is already confirmed
- R is new letter to test
- R is new letter to test

This seems like a good next guess as it keeps S and E, moves T to position 2, and introduces R.

From the two rounds of feedback:

   - E is last letter (position 5)  
   - T is second letter (position 2)  

   Pattern so far: S T _ _ E

2. Letters that are **not** in the word at all:

3. Letters that are in the word but in the **wrong** positions:  
   - L is in the word but **not** in position 2 (from SLATE).  
   - E was marked “-” in position 3 of STERE, meaning E is in the word but **not** in position 3. We already know E is fixed at position 5, so this simply confirms E is present and already locked.

4. Therefore the word must be of the form:  
   S T _ _ E  
   with the remaining two letters chosen from the unused common letters (excluding A and R).

Common unused letters (among those not yet tried): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know L must appear somewhere in the word (from feedback L-). Since L cannot be in position 2 (where T is), the only remaining possibility is position 3 or 4.

We now know the exact pattern:

S T _ L E

and we have discovered that the letters **A, R, I, Y** are **not** in the word.  
The only unknown is the third letter (position 3).  
Letters already confirmed present and already placed: S, T, L, E.  
Letters still available from the standard alphabet (excluding A, R, I, Y):

B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a common 5-letter English word that matches S T ? L E.
