For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The classic starting word ""SLATE"" is popular for this reason, as it covers common consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E). However, another strong choice is ""AROSE"" because it contains all five of the most common letters in English words (A, R, O, S, E) and gives excellent coverage for vowel and consonant positions. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides a broad initial scan of the alphabet.

Let me also consider that sometimes starting with a word like ""CRANE"" or ""ADIEU"" can be effective, but these are less balanced. ""AROSE"" seems like the best compromise between common letters and positional variety.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- R is in the correct position (second letter).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A, O, S are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Contains the letter E somewhere except position 5.
- Does NOT contain A, O, S.

I need a word that:
1. Has R in position 2.
2. Has E somewhere else (positions 1, 3, 4).
3. Avoids A, O, S.
4. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, V, W, Y, Z
Good vowels left: E (already confirmed), I, U (since A and O are out)

Let me think of words fitting _ R _ _ _:
- B R E E D (but has two E's, might not help)
- C R E E K

- G R E E N
- P R I Z E
- T R I C E
- D R I V E
- H U R E D (not valid)

""TRIED"" seems valid and uses common letters. It has R in position 2, E in position 4, and avoids A, O, S. The consonants T and D are common and will give good info.

Another candidate is ""PRIED"" (but P is less common). ""TRIED"" seems better.

From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - R is fixed in position 2.
   - E is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5.
   - A, O, S are absent.

   - R is again confirmed in position 2.
   - T is in the word but not in position 1.
   - I and D are absent.
   - E is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5 (so E must be in position 1 or 3).

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Must contain: T, E
- Must not contain: A, O, S, I, D
- E must be in position 1 or 3.

Possible patterns:
- E R _ _ _  (if E is in position 1)
- _ R E _ _  (if E is in position 3)

Let's explore both.

Case 1: E R _ _ _

   Possible consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, Z
   Possible vowels left: none (since A, O, I are out and E is used)
   Need to place T somewhere in positions 3,4,5.
   Example words:
   - ERGOT (but G is ok, but O is forbidden - wait O is out, so this is invalid)
   - ERECT (C is ok, but we have to check letters)
   - EMBER (but B is ok, but M is ok)
   - ERBET (but B and T are ok, but E is already used twice which is possible)
   However, we need to make sure all letters are allowed.

Wait, ERECT uses C which is allowed, but has C and R and E and T. But R is already in position 2.

But ERECT has E R C T - but that's 4 letters. Wait, ERECT is 5 letters: E R C T ? No, ERECT is E R C T ? No, ERECT is E R C T ? Actually ERECT is E-R-C-T, but that's 4 letters. I need 5 letters.

Let me think of valid 5-letter words starting with E R _ _ _:
- ERECT (but that's E R C T, missing a letter)
Wait, ERECT is 5 letters: E R C T ? No, ERECT is E-R-C-T, but that's 4 letters. Actually ERECT is 5 letters: E R C T ? No, ERECT is E R C T ? Wait, no - ERECT is E R C T ? No, ERECT is E R C T ? Actually ERECT is 5 letters: E R C T ? No, ERECT is E-R-C-T, which is 4 letters. I'm confused.

Let me list valid 5-letter words with pattern E R _ _ _:
- ERECT (but that's 4 letters)
- ERIED (but I is forbidden)
- ERUPT (U is allowed, P is allowed, T is required)
- ERGOT (O is forbidden)
- ERASE (A is forbidden)
- ERUPT seems valid: E R U P T
   Letters: E, R, U, P, T
   - Contains T and E
   - R is in position 2
   - E is in position 1 (allowed)
   - U, P are new letters to test
   - Avoids forbidden letters: A, O, S, I, D

This seems like a good next guess.

Case 2: _ R E _ _
   Then we need T somewhere in positions 1,4,5, and avoid forbidden letters.
   Possible words:
   - T R E A T (but A is forbidden)
   - T R E N D (D is forbidden)
   - T R E K S (S is forbidden)
   - T R E E T (but E is already used in position 3, and we can have duplicates)
   - T R E N T (N is allowed, T is allowed)
   - T R E N T: T R E N T
      Letters: T, R, E, N, T
      - Contains T and E
      - R in position 2
      - E in position 3 (allowed)
      - T in position 1 and 5
      - Avoids forbidden letters
   This is also valid.

Between ERUPT and TREN T, which gives more new letters? ERUPT introduces U and P; T R E N T introduces N.

I'll choose ERUPT to test more new consonants.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The classic starting word ""SLATE"" is popular for this reason, as it covers common consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E). However, another strong choice is ""AROSE"" because it contains all five of the most common letters in English words (A, R, O, S, E) and gives excellent coverage for vowel and consonant positions. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides a broad initial scan of the alphabet.

Let me also consider that sometimes starting with a word like ""CRANE"" or ""ADIEU"" can be effective, but these are less balanced. ""AROSE"" seems like the best compromise between common letters and positional variety.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(-)

<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- R is in the correct position (second letter).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A, O, S are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Contains the letter E somewhere except position 5.
- Does NOT contain A, O, S.

I need a word that:
1. Has R in position 2.
2. Has E somewhere else (positions 1, 3, 4).
3. Avoids A, O, S.
4. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, V, W, Y, Z
Good vowels left: E (already confirmed), I, U (since A and O are out)

Let me think of words fitting _ R _ _ _:
- B R E E D (but has two E's, might not help)
- C R E E K
- F R E E D
- G R E E N
- P R I Z E
- T R I C E
- D R I V E
- H U R E D (not valid)
- C R I D E (not valid)
- T R I E D

""TRIED"" seems valid and uses common letters. It has R in position 2, E in position 4, and avoids A, O, S. The consonants T and D are common and will give good info.

Another candidate is ""PRIED"" (but P is less common). ""TRIED"" seems better.

Guess 2: TRIED -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(✓) I(x) E(-) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - R is fixed in position 2.
   - E is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5.
   - A, O, S are absent.

2. TRIED → T(-) R(✓) I(x) E(-) D(x)
   - R is again confirmed in position 2.
   - T is in the word but not in position 1.
   - I and D are absent.
   - E is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5 (so E must be in position 1 or 3).

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Must contain: T, E
- Must not contain: A, O, S, I, D
- E must be in position 1 or 3.

Possible patterns:
- E R _ _ _  (if E is in position 1)
- _ R E _ _  (if E is in position 3)

Let's explore both.

Case 1: E R _ _ _
   Remaining letters to find (positions 3,4,5) must include T and avoid forbidden letters.
   Possible consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, Z
   Possible vowels left: none (since A, O, I are out and E is used)
   Need to place T somewhere in positions 3,4,5.
   Example words:
   - ERGOT (but G is ok, but O is forbidden - wait O is out, so this is invalid)
   - ERECT (C is ok, but we have to check letters)
   - EMBER (but B is ok, but M is ok)
   - ERBET (but B and T are ok, but E is already used twice which is possible)
   However, we need to make sure all letters are allowed.

Wait, ERECT uses C which is allowed, but has C and R and E and T. But R is already in position 2.

But ERECT has E R C T - but that's 4 letters. Wait, ERECT is 5 letters: E R C T ? No, ERECT is E R C T ? No, ERECT is E R C T ? Actually ERECT is E-R-C-T, but that's 4 letters. I need 5 letters.

Let me think of valid 5-letter words starting with E R _ _ _:
- ERECT (but that's E R C T, missing a letter)
Wait, ERECT is 5 letters: E R C T ? No, ERECT is E-R-C-T, but that's 4 letters. Actually ERECT is 5 letters: E R C T ? No, ERECT is E R C T ? Wait, no - ERECT is E R C T ? No, ERECT is E R C T ? Actually ERECT is 5 letters: E R C T ? No, ERECT is E-R-C-T, which is 4 letters. I'm confused.

Let me list valid 5-letter words with pattern E R _ _ _:
- ERECT (but that's 4 letters)
- ERIED (but I is forbidden)
- ERUPT (U is allowed, P is allowed, T is required)
- ERGOT (O is forbidden)
- ERASE (A is forbidden)
- ERUPT seems valid: E R U P T
   Letters: E, R, U, P, T
   - Contains T and E
   - R is in position 2
   - E is in position 1 (allowed)
   - U, P are new letters to test
   - Avoids forbidden letters: A, O, S, I, D

This seems like a good next guess.

Case 2: _ R E _ _
   Then we need T somewhere in positions 1,4,5, and avoid forbidden letters.
   Possible words:
   - T R E A T (but A is forbidden)
   - T R E N D (D is forbidden)
   - T R E K S (S is forbidden)
   - T R E E T (but E is already used in position 3, and we can have duplicates)
   - T R E N T (N is allowed, T is allowed)
   - T R E N T: T R E N T
      Letters: T, R, E, N, T
      - Contains T and E
      - R in position 2
      - E in position 3 (allowed)
      - T in position 1 and 5
      - Avoids forbidden letters
   This is also valid.

Between ERUPT and TREN T, which gives more new letters? ERUPT introduces U and P; T R E N T introduces N.

- U and P are NOT in the word.

- ERIED (but I is forbidden)
- ERUPT (U is allowed, P is allowed, T is required)
- ERGOT (O is forbidden)
- ERASE (A is forbidden)
- ERUPT seems valid: E R U P T
   Letters: E, R, U, P, T
   - Contains T and E
   - R is in position 2
   - E is in position 1 (allowed)
   - U, P are new letters to test
   - Avoids forbidden letters: A, O, S, I, D

This seems like a good next guess.

Case 2: _ R E _ _
   Then we need T somewhere in positions 1,4,5, and avoid forbidden letters.
   Possible words:
   - T R E A T (but A is forbidden)
   - T R E N D (D is forbidden)
   - T R E K S (S is forbidden)
   - T R E E T (but E is already used in position 3, and we can have duplicates)
   - T R E N T (N is allowed, T is allowed)
   - T R E N T: T R E N T
      Letters: T, R, E, N, T
      - Contains T and E
      - R in position 2
      - E in position 3 (allowed)
      - T in position 1 and 5
      - Avoids forbidden letters
   This is also valid.

Between ERUPT and TREN T, which gives more new letters? ERUPT introduces U and P; T R E N T introduces N.

I'll choose ERUPT to test more new consonants.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the new feedback on ERUPT:
- E is now confirmed in position 1.
- R is confirmed in position 2.
- T is confirmed in position 5.
- U and P are NOT in the word.

So the pattern is now: E R _ _ T

We still need to find the letters in positions 3 and 4.  
Known constraints:
- Letters already ruled out: A, O, S, I, D, U, P  
- Letters still allowed: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, V, W, Y, Z plus the remaining vowel Y (sometimes used as vowel).

We also know from earlier that E is already used in position 1, so duplicates are allowed (e.g., E R E _ T).

Let’s list valid 5-letter words matching E R _ _ T:
- ERECT – but C is allowed, but we’d have E R E C T. However, C is allowed and we haven’t tested it yet.
- EREWT – not a valid word.
- ERGOT – O is out.
- ERGOT is invalid (O out).
- ERNE T – N is allowed, E is used.
- ERNET – N is allowed.
- ERKET – K is allowed.
- ERLET – L is allowed.
- ERMET – M is allowed.
- ERWET – W is allowed.
- ERZET – Z is allowed.

Among these, ERECT uses C and E (reusing E) and is a valid word.  
Another candidate is ERENT (but that’s not a common word).  
ERLET (E R E L T) is valid but less common.

The most common and informative choice is ERECT, as it tests the new consonant C.

So the next guess is ERECT.

- C is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).
- R is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).
- The second E is NOT in the word (x).

So the current pattern is:
E _ _ _ T
with letters C and R somewhere in positions 2,3,4, but NOT in the positions just tested.

We also know:
- Letters already ruled out: A, O, S, I, D, U, P, and now the second E is out.
- Remaining consonants to test: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, V, W, Y, Z
- Remaining vowel to test: none, since A, O, I, E are ruled out or confirmed.

We need to place C and R in positions 2,3,4 without repeating their previous positions (C not in 2, R not in 3).

Possible positions:
- C can be in 3 or 4
- R can be in 2 or 4

Let’s list valid combinations:
1. E R _ C T – but R would be in position 2 (allowed), C in 4 (allowed). Word: ERECT (but we already tried ECRET and it was marked “-” for C in position 2, but this is C in 4 which is new. However, ERECT is the same as ECRET except the order of C and R. Since ECRET was tried and gave “-” for C in position 2 and “-” for R in position 3, we can try ERECT now because it places C in 4 and R in 2, which weren’t tested before.)
2. E _ R C T – C in 4, R in 3 (but R was in 3 in ECRET and got “-”, so this is invalid)
3. E C R _ T – C in 2 (invalid, since C was in 2 in ECRET and got “-”)

Thus, the only valid new placement is E R _ C T, which is ERECT.

But wait, we just tried ECRET (E C R E T) and got “-” for C in position 2 and “-” for R in position 3. Now we need to test C in position 4 and R in position 2 with the pattern E R _ C T, which is ERECT.

However, ERECT is a valid word and hasn’t been tried yet in this exact pattern. Therefore, ERECT is the logical next guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- R is in the correct position (second letter).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A, O, S are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Contains the letter E somewhere except position 5.
- Does NOT contain A, O, S.

I need a word that:
1. Has R in position 2.
2. Has E somewhere else (positions 1, 3, 4).
3. Avoids A, O, S.
4. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, V, W, Y, Z
Good vowels left: E (already confirmed), I, U (since A and O are out)

Let me think of words fitting _ R _ _ _:
- B R E E D (but has two E's, might not help)
- C R E E K
- F R E E D
- G R E E N
- P R I Z E
- T R I C E
- D R I V E
- H U R E D (not valid)
- C R I D E (not valid)
- T R I E D

""TRIED"" seems valid and uses common letters. It has R in position 2, E in position 4, and avoids A, O, S. The consonants T and D are common and will give good info.

Another candidate is ""PRIED"" (but P is less common). ""TRIED"" seems better.

Guess 2: TRIED -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(✓) I(x) E(-) D(x)

From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - R is fixed in position 2.
   - E is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5.
   - A, O, S are absent.

2. TRIED → T(-) R(✓) I(x) E(-) D(x)
   - R is again confirmed in position 2.
   - T is in the word but not in position 1.
   - I and D are absent.
   - E is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5 (so E must be in position 1 or 3).

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Must contain: T, E
- Must not contain: A, O, S, I, D
- E must be in position 1 or 3.

Possible patterns:
- E R _ _ _  (if E is in position 1)
- _ R E _ _  (if E is in position 3)

Let's explore both.

Case 1: E R _ _ _
   Remaining letters to find (positions 3,4,5) must include T and avoid forbidden letters.
   Possible consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, Z
   Possible vowels left: none (since A, O, I are out and E is used)
   Need to place T somewhere in positions 3,4,5.
   Example words:
   - ERGOT (but G is ok, but O is forbidden - wait O is out, so this is invalid)
   - ERECT (C is ok, but we have to check letters)
   - EMBER (but B is ok, but M is ok)
   - ERBET (but B and T are ok, but E is already used twice which is possible)
   However, we need to make sure all letters are allowed.

Wait, ERECT uses C which is allowed, but has C and R and E and T. But R is already in position 2.

But ERECT has E R C T - but that's 4 letters. Wait, ERECT is 5 letters: E R C T ? No, ERECT is E R C T ? No, ERECT is E R C T ? Actually ERECT is E-R-C-T, but that's 4 letters. I need 5 letters.

Let me think of valid 5-letter words starting with E R _ _ _:
- ERECT (but that's E R C T, missing a letter)
Wait, ERECT is 5 letters: E R C T ? No, ERECT is E-R-C-T, but that's 4 letters. Actually ERECT is 5 letters: E R C T ? No, ERECT is E R C T ? Wait, no - ERECT is E R C T ? No, ERECT is E R C T ? Actually ERECT is 5 letters: E R C T ? No, ERECT is E-R-C-T, which is 4 letters. I'm confused.

Let me list valid 5-letter words with pattern E R _ _ _:
- ERECT (but that's 4 letters)
- ERIED (but I is forbidden)
- ERUPT (U is allowed, P is allowed, T is required)
- ERGOT (O is forbidden)
- ERASE (A is forbidden)
- ERUPT seems valid: E R U P T
   Letters: E, R, U, P, T
   - Contains T and E
   - R is in position 2
   - E is in position 1 (allowed)
   - U, P are new letters to test
   - Avoids forbidden letters: A, O, S, I, D

This seems like a good next guess.

Case 2: _ R E _ _
   Then we need T somewhere in positions 1,4,5, and avoid forbidden letters.
   Possible words:
   - T R E A T (but A is forbidden)
   - T R E N D (D is forbidden)
   - T R E K S (S is forbidden)
   - T R E E T (but E is already used in position 3, and we can have duplicates)
   - T R E N T (N is allowed, T is allowed)
   - T R E N T: T R E N T
      Letters: T, R, E, N, T
      - Contains T and E
      - R in position 2
      - E in position 3 (allowed)
      - T in position 1 and 5
      - Avoids forbidden letters
   This is also valid.

Between ERUPT and TREN T, which gives more new letters? ERUPT introduces U and P; T R E N T introduces N.

I'll choose ERUPT to test more new consonants.

From the new feedback on ERUPT:
- E is now confirmed in position 1.
- R is confirmed in position 2.
- T is confirmed in position 5.
- U and P are NOT in the word.

So the pattern is now: E R _ _ T

We still need to find the letters in positions 3 and 4.  
Known constraints:
- Letters already ruled out: A, O, S, I, D, U, P  
- Letters still allowed: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, V, W, Y, Z plus the remaining vowel Y (sometimes used as vowel).

We also know from earlier that E is already used in position 1, so duplicates are allowed (e.g., E R E _ T).

Let’s list valid 5-letter words matching E R _ _ T:
- ERECT – but C is allowed, but we’d have E R E C T. However, C is allowed and we haven’t tested it yet.
- EREWT – not a valid word.
- ERGOT – O is out.
- ERGOT is invalid (O out).
- ERNE T – N is allowed, E is used.
- ERNET – N is allowed.
- ERKET – K is allowed.
- ERLET – L is allowed.
- ERMET – M is allowed.
- ERWET – W is allowed.
- ERZET – Z is allowed.

Among these, ERECT uses C and E (reusing E) and is a valid word.  
Another candidate is ERENT (but that’s not a common word).  
ERLET (E R E L T) is valid but less common.

The most common and informative choice is ERECT, as it tests the new consonant C.

So the next guess is ERECT.

From the latest feedback on ECRET:
- E is now confirmed in position 1 (✓).
- T is confirmed in position 5 (✓).
- C is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).
- R is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).
- The second E is NOT in the word (x).

So the current pattern is:
E _ _ _ T
with letters C and R somewhere in positions 2,3,4, but NOT in the positions just tested.

We also know:
- Letters already ruled out: A, O, S, I, D, U, P, and now the second E is out.
- Remaining consonants to test: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, V, W, Y, Z
- Remaining vowel to test: none, since A, O, I, E are ruled out or confirmed.

We need to place C and R in positions 2,3,4 without repeating their previous positions (C not in 2, R not in 3).

Possible positions:
- C can be in 3 or 4
- R can be in 2 or 4

Let’s list valid combinations:
1. E R _ C T – but R would be in position 2 (allowed), C in 4 (allowed). Word: ERECT (but we already tried ECRET and it was marked “-” for C in position 2, but this is C in 4 which is new. However, ERECT is the same as ECRET except the order of C and R. Since ECRET was tried and gave “-” for C in position 2 and “-” for R in position 3, we can try ERECT now because it places C in 4 and R in 2, which weren’t tested before.)
2. E _ R C T – C in 4, R in 3 (but R was in 3 in ECRET and got “-”, so this is invalid)
3. E C R _ T – C in 2 (invalid, since C was in 2 in ECRET and got “-”)

Thus, the only valid new placement is E R _ C T, which is ERECT.

But wait, we just tried ECRET (E C R E T) and got “-” for C in position 2 and “-” for R in position 3. Now we need to test C in position 4 and R in position 2 with the pattern E R _ C T, which is ERECT.

However, ERECT is a valid word and hasn’t been tried yet in this exact pattern. Therefore, ERECT is the logical next guess.

We also know every other letter we’ve tried so far is ruled out except R, C, E, T.  
The only remaining slots are positions 2,3,4 and we must use C and R plus one more consonant that hasn’t been tested yet.

Letters still available (not yet ruled out): B, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, V, W, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word of the form E _ _ _ T that contains both C and R exactly once each (since we’ve only seen one instance of each so far) and no other letters already ruled out.

Possible valid placements:
- C must be in 3 or 4
