### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. 

The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- C, R (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)
- N (another common consonant)

This gives us a good spread of letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words, which should provide useful feedback regardless of the secret word.

Looking at the pattern C A _ E R:
- C A K E R (valid word)
- C A M E R (valid word - but M is less common)
- C A P E R (valid word)

Among these, ""CAKER"" seems like a strong candidate as K is a common letter. However, let's verify if this fits all constraints:
- C(✓) in position 1
- A(✓) in position 2
- K is new, but allowed
- E(✓) in position 4

   - position 4 is already E, so R must be in position 5
- T and N are out
- Letters not yet used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Putting it together:
C A _ E R

We need a valid 5-letter word that matches C A _ E R. The only common word that fits is ""CAKER"" or ""CAMER"" (but M is possible). However, ""CAKER"" uses K which hasn't been ruled out yet. Let's check if there are any other possibilities.

Looking at the pattern C A _ E R:
- C A K E R (valid word)
- C A M E R (valid word - but M is less common)
- C A P E R (valid word)

Among these, ""CAKER"" seems like a strong candidate as K is a common letter. However, let's verify if this fits all constraints:
- C(✓) in position 1
- A(✓) in position 2
- K is new, but allowed
- E(✓) in position 4
- R(✓) in position 5 (which hasn't been ruled out yet)

Thus, the most logical next guess is C A K E R.

From the three rounds of feedback we now have:

1. C(✓) in position 1
2. A(✓) in position 2
3. E(✓) in position 4
4. R(✓) in position 5
5. K(x) → K is NOT in the word
6. T(x) and N(x) already ruled out earlier

So the pattern is now fully determined except for position 3:
C A _ E R

Letters already excluded: N, T, K
Letters still allowed for position 3: all others except those three.

Common 5-letter words that fit C A _ E R:
- C A M E R
- C A P E R
- C A R E R (but R is already in position 5, so this would have two R's; the feedback allows repeated letters since we only know single appearances so far)
- C A S E R
- C A V E R
- C A L E R (but L is allowed)

Among these, ""CAPER"" and ""CAMER"" are both valid. ""CAPER"" is more common, so I'll go with that.
