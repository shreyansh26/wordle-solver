### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (common vowel)

This gives me a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- L(x) → L is not in the word.
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- T(x) → T is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in the 5th position.

So far we know:
- The word ends with E.
- It contains A somewhere other than position 3.
- It does NOT contain S, L, or T.

We need a new word that:
- Ends with E.
- Contains A (not in position 3).
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (so no S, L, T).

A good next guess would be one that introduces new common consonants while respecting these constraints. The word ""CRANE"" is often useful, but C and N are still possibilities. However, let's try ""CRANE"" first to see if we can get more information.

Wait, let me reconsider. Since we know A is in the word but not in position 3, and E is in position 5, maybe ""CRANE"" is too similar in structure. Instead, let's try a word like ""CHARE"" - but H and R are still possible. Alternatively, ""GRAPE"" - but G and P are new.

Actually, let's try ""CHARE"":
- C (new)
- H (new)
- A (known to be in word, position 2 here instead of 3)
- R (new)
- E (known in position 5)

But ""CHARE"" isn't a valid 5-letter word. Let me pick a valid one like ""CHORE"":
- C (new)
- H (new)
- O (new)
- R (new)
- E (known in position 5)

This introduces 4 new letters (C, H, O, R) while keeping E in position 5. This seems like a good way to gather more information.

A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:\n- S (common consonant)\n- L (common consonant)\n- A (common vowel)\n- T (common consonant)\n- E (common vowel)\n\nThis gives me a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.\n\n<guess>SLATE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on SLATE:\n- S(x) → S is not in the word.\n- L(x) → L is not in the word.\n- A(-) → A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.\n- T(x) → T is not in the word.\n- E(✓) → E is in the word and in the 5th position.\n\nSo far we know:\n- The word ends with E.\n- It contains A somewhere other than position 3.\n- It does NOT contain S, L, or T.\n\nWe need a new word that:\n- Ends with E.\n- Contains A (not in position 3).\n- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (so no S, L, T).\n\nA good next guess would be one that introduces new common consonants while respecting these constraints.

Since we know A is in the word but not in position 3, and E is in position 5, maybe ""CRANE"" is too similar in structure. Instead, let\'s try a word like ""CHARE"" - but H and R are still possible. Alternatively, ""GRAPE"" - but G and P are new.\n\nActually, let\'s try ""CHARE"":\n- C (new)\n- H (new)\n- A (known to be in word, position 2 here instead of 3)\n- R (new)\n- E (known in position 5)\n\nBut ""CHARE"" isn\'t a valid 5-letter word.

Let’s summarize everything we now know from the three guesses:

1. Position 5 is definitely E (from every guess).
2. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:  
   S, L, T, C, H, O, R, D  
3. Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still uncertain:  
   A, E, I, M  
   - M is confirmed in position 1 (✓ in MEDIA).
   - E must appear somewhere other than position 2 (since it was “-” in MEDIA, meaning it’s in the word but not in position 2).
   - A must appear somewhere other than positions 3 or 4 (it was “-” in both SLATE and MEDIA).
   - I must appear somewhere other than position 4 (it was “-” in MEDIA).

So the current pattern is:
M _ _ _ E  
with A, I, and possibly others still to place, and the remaining slots (2,3,4) must include at least A and I (and possibly one more new letter).

Letters still available (not yet ruled out):  
B, F, G, J, K, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus repeats if needed.

We need a word that:
- starts with M,
- ends with E,
- contains both A and I in positions other than:
   – A not in 3 or 4  
   – I not in 4  
- uses only letters from the allowed set.

A quick scan of common 5-letter words gives “MIAAE” (invalid), “MABIE” (invalid), etc.  
A valid word that fits is “MABIE” but that’s uncommon.  
Another valid, common word is “MAIZE” but it ends with E, starts with M, and places A in 2 and I in 3 – both positions are still allowed.

Let’s test MAIZE:
- M ✓ (already known in pos 1)  
- A in pos 2 (allowed, since A must be in 1, 2, or 4 and we know it’s not in 3 or 4 from MEDIA) – wait, MEDIA had A in 4 and it was “-”, so A is NOT in 4.  
So A must be in position 2.  
Thus MAIZE places A in 2 and I in 3 – both positions are still allowed.

Therefore MAIZE is a valid next guess.
