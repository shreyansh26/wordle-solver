For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word that covers several of these common vowels and consonants. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
This should help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- S is in the correct position (5th letter).
- R, O, and E are all in the word but in the wrong positions.
- A is not in the word at all.

So far we know:
1. The word ends in S.
2. It contains R, O, E somewhere among positions 1-4.
3. It does NOT contain A.

I need a word that:
- Ends in S
- Contains R, O, E (but not in the same positions as AROSE)
- Does not contain A

Let me think of words that fit this pattern. Since R, O, E must appear elsewhere, I can try to rearrange them with other common consonants. A good candidate is ""TROES"" but that seems unlikely. Another is ""ORDER"" but that ends in R, not S. 

""ROTES"" comes to mind: it has R, O, E, and ends in S. Checking positions:
- R would be in position 1 (was position 2 in AROSE) - new position.
- O would be position 2 (was position 3) - new position.
- E would be position 4 (was position 5) - new position.
- T is a new consonant.

This seems like a strong next guess as it reuses R, O, E in different spots while introducing T.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after the two guesses.

1. Word structure: _ _ _ _ S  (S is fixed in 5th position).
2. Letters that MUST appear somewhere in positions 1-4: R, O, E.
3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, T.
4. Positions that have been ruled out so far:
   - R cannot be in position 2 (from arose) or position 1 (from rotes).
   - O cannot be in position 3 (from arose) or position 2 (from rotes).
   - E cannot be in position 5 (from arose) or position 4 (from rotes).

So:
- R is allowed in positions 3 or 4.
- O is allowed in positions 1, 4.
- E is allowed in positions 1, 2, 3.

We need a 5-letter word ending in S that contains R, O, E exactly once each, and no A or T.

Let’s list possible patterns that satisfy these constraints and look for common words.

One promising pattern is: E _ R O S
- E in position 1 (allowed).
- R in position 3 (allowed).
- O in position 4 (allowed).
- S in position 5 (fixed).
The missing second letter must be a consonant that hasn’t been ruled out (no A, T). Common choices: D, N, L, etc.

The word “ERROS” fits this pattern:
- E R R O S – but it repeats R, which we don’t know is invalid, yet we want to avoid repeats for maximum info. So skip.

Another pattern: O _ E R S
- O in position 1 (allowed).
- E in position 3 (allowed).
- R in position 4 (allowed).
The second letter must be a new consonant.

A valid word here is “OVERS”:
- O(1), V(2), E(3), R(4), S(5).
Letters: O, V, E, R, S – none of A, T, and uses required letters without repeats.

From the three rounds of feedback we now have:

1. S is fixed in position 5.
2. Letters that MUST appear in the word (each exactly once): R, O, E, S.
3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, T, V.
4. Position exclusions so far:
   - R cannot be in 1, 2, 3, 4 (because in each of the three guesses it has been marked “-” in a different position).
   - O cannot be in 2, 3, 4, 5 (because it has been marked “-” in positions 3, 2, 1 respectively).
   - E cannot be in 3, 4, 5 (because it has been marked “-” in positions 5, 4, 3 respectively).

But wait: the word is only 5 letters long and we already know it contains R, O, E, S exactly once each, plus one more letter. That extra letter must be a consonant we haven’t tried yet (cannot be A, T, V).

Let’s tabulate the only possible positions for each required letter:

R: cannot be in 1,2,3,4 → must be in position 5.  
But position 5 is already fixed as S. This is impossible.  
Therefore, our earlier assumption that each of R, O, E appears exactly once is wrong.  

Re-reading the feedback carefully:  
- “R(-)” means R is in the word but not in that position.  
- “O(-)” means O is in the word but not in that position.  
- “E(-)” means E is in the word but not in that position.  
- “S(✓)” means S is in the correct position (position 5).  

So the word contains R, O, E, S (each at least once) and possibly duplicates, but we must not assume duplicates unless forced. However, the word is 5 letters and we have four distinct letters already, so one of them must appear twice.

Looking at the exclusions:

R has been tried in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 → must appear in position 5.  
But position 5 is S. Therefore R cannot appear at all, which contradicts the feedback.  

This means our only resolution is that one of the letters R, O, E must appear twice. The only way this can happen without contradicting the feedback is if the duplicate letter is the one whose position has been ruled out most severely.

Let’s count how many positions each letter has been ruled out of:

- R: positions 1, 2, 3, 4 → must be in 5, but 5 is S → R cannot appear → contradiction.  
- O: positions 2, 3, 4, 5 → must be in 1.  
- E: positions 3, 4, 5 → must be in 1 or 2.

The only letter that can still be placed without contradiction is O, which must be in position 1. E must then be in 2 or 3, and R must somehow avoid positions 1-4 (but cannot be in 5 because 5 is S). This seems impossible unless we allow duplicates.

The only letter that can logically duplicate is S, but S is already fixed in position 5. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that one of R, O, E appears twice, and the extra letter is a new consonant.

Given the constraints, the only viable word structure is:

O _ _ _ S (because O must be in position 1)

With R and E placed in remaining positions and one new consonant.

Possible placements:

O E R _ S → but then where does the new consonant go?  
O _ E R S → but R must not be in 4 (from arose) or 1 (from rotes) or 5 (from overs) → R must be in 2 or 3.  
O _ R E S → E would be in 4, which has been ruled out.  
O R E _ S → but R would be in 2 (allowed), E in 3 (allowed), and the blank would be a new consonant.

Let’s test “ORERS” – but that repeats R.  
“OZERS” – Z is new, but not common.  
“OXERS” – X is new.  
“ONERS” – N is new.  

The most common word fitting O _ R E S is “ONERS” but that’s not a standard word.  

Another structure: O _ _ R S – but R must be in 2 or 3.  

Let’s try O B E R S – B is new.  

But the only standard word that fits O _ _ R S and uses E without contradiction is “OBEAR” but that doesn’t end in S.

Re-evaluate: the feedback shows S is correct in position 5, and R, O, E are all in the word but their exact positions are being narrowed down. The word must contain R, O, E, S and one more consonant, with no A, T, V.

The only remaining possibility is that the word is “ORDER” but that ends in R, not S.  

Wait – let’s list all 5-letter words ending in S that contain R, O, E and one other consonant (not A, T, V).  

Possible candidates:  
- “OZONE” – ends in E, not S.  
- “ROSES” – has S twice, but we don’t know if S can repeat.  
- “ROSES” – R O S E S → contains R, O, E, S and repeats S. This fits the constraints:  
   - S is in position 5 (correct).  
   - R is in position 1 (allowed, since in previous guesses it was marked “-” in positions 2,3,4).  
   - O is in position 2 (allowed, since it was marked “-” in positions 3,2,1 – wait, in overs it was position 1 marked “-”, so O cannot be in 1. So O cannot be in 1,2,3,5 – must be in 4.  

This is getting complex. Let’s use the elimination method:

Current constraints:
- Word ends in S (position 5).
- Must contain R, O, E (each at least once).
- Cannot contain A, T, V.
- Position exclusions:
   - R cannot be in 1,2,3,4 → must be in 5 → but 5 is S → R cannot appear → contradiction.  

This implies our only resolution is that one of R, O, E must appear twice. The only letter that has not been ruled out of every position is E, which must be in 1 or 2.  

Let’s assume E is the one that appears twice. Then the word would be something like E E R O S, but that’s not a word.  

Next, assume O is the one that appears twice. Then the word would be O O R E S – not valid.  

Finally, assume R is the one that appears twice. Then the word would be R O S E R – but ends in R, not S.  

This suggests the only possible word is “ROSES” despite the S repeating, because:
- S is fixed in position 5.  
- R must be in position 1 (only remaining spot).  
- O must be in position 3 (since 1,2,5 are ruled out).  
- E must be in position 4 (since 3,5 are ruled out).  
- The second S in position 4 is allowed because S can repeat.  

Thus, the word must be “ROSES”.

But let’s verify:
- R is in position 1 (allowed, since previous “-” were in 2,3,4).  
- O is in position 3 (allowed, since previous “-” were in 3,2,1 – wait, in arose O was in 3 marked “-”, so O cannot be in 3. Contradiction again.  

This is very tight. The only remaining word that fits all constraints is “OZONE” but it ends in E, not S.  

Realizing the only possible structure is O _ _ _ S with R and E placed such that:
- O is in 1 (must be, since it has been ruled out of 2,3,4,5).  
- R must be in 2 or 3 (cannot be 1,4,5).  
- E must be in remaining spot.  

Possible words:
- O R E _ S – but need a consonant.  
- O R E N S – “ORENS” – not a word.  
- O R E D S – “ORED S” – not valid.  
- O R E K S – “OREKS” – not valid.  

The only standard word fitting is “OBESE” but it lacks R.  

Re-examining: the feedback shows S is correct in 5, and R, O, E are all in the word but their positions are being tested. The word must be a permutation of R, O, E, S plus one consonant, ending in S.  

The only valid word I can find is “ROSES” despite the S repeat, because:
- S is fixed in 5.  
- R must be in 1 (only spot left).  
- O must be in 3 (but was “-” in 3 in arose – cannot be).  

This is impossible. Therefore, the only remaining word is “OZONE” but it ends in E.  

Realizing the only possible word left is “ROSES” even with the S repeat, because all other positions are ruled out. Thus, the feedback must indicate “ROSES”.

But to be precise, the word must be “ROSES”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word that covers several of these common vowels and consonants. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
This should help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- S is in the correct position (5th letter).
- R, O, and E are all in the word but in the wrong positions.
- A is not in the word at all.

So far we know:
1. The word ends in S.
2. It contains R, O, E somewhere among positions 1-4.
3. It does NOT contain A.

I need a word that:
- Ends in S
- Contains R, O, E (but not in the same positions as AROSE)
- Does not contain A

Let me think of words that fit this pattern. Since R, O, E must appear elsewhere, I can try to rearrange them with other common consonants. A good candidate is ""TROES"" but that seems unlikely. Another is ""ORDER"" but that ends in R, not S. 

""ROTES"" comes to mind: it has R, O, E, and ends in S. Checking positions:
- R would be in position 1 (was position 2 in AROSE) - new position.
- O would be position 2 (was position 3) - new position.
- E would be position 4 (was position 5) - new position.
- T is a new consonant.

This seems like a strong next guess as it reuses R, O, E in different spots while introducing T.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after the two guesses.

1. Word structure: _ _ _ _ S  (S is fixed in 5th position).
2. Letters that MUST appear somewhere in positions 1-4: R, O, E.
3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, T.
4. Positions that have been ruled out so far:
   - R cannot be in position 2 (from arose) or position 1 (from rotes).
   - O cannot be in position 3 (from arose) or position 2 (from rotes).
   - E cannot be in position 5 (from arose) or position 4 (from rotes).

So:
- R is allowed in positions 3 or 4.
- O is allowed in positions 1, 4.
- E is allowed in positions 1, 2, 3.

We need a 5-letter word ending in S that contains R, O, E exactly once each, and no A or T.

Let’s list possible patterns that satisfy these constraints and look for common words.

One promising pattern is: E _ R O S
- E in position 1 (allowed).
- R in position 3 (allowed).
- O in position 4 (allowed).
- S in position 5 (fixed).
The missing second letter must be a consonant that hasn’t been ruled out (no A, T). Common choices: D, N, L, etc.

The word “ERROS” fits this pattern:
- E R R O S – but it repeats R, which we don’t know is invalid, yet we want to avoid repeats for maximum info. So skip.

Another pattern: O _ E R S
- O in position 1 (allowed).
- E in position 3 (allowed).
- R in position 4 (allowed).
The second letter must be a new consonant.

A valid word here is “OVERS”:
- O(1), V(2), E(3), R(4), S(5).
Letters: O, V, E, R, S – none of A, T, and uses required letters without repeats.

This seems like the best next guess.

1. S is fixed in position 5.
2. Letters that MUST appear in the word (each exactly once): R, O, E, S.
3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, T, V.
4. Position exclusions so far:
   - R cannot be in 1, 2, 3, 4 (because in each of the three guesses it has been marked “-” in a different position).
   - O cannot be in 2, 3, 4, 5 (because it has been marked “-” in positions 3, 2, 1 respectively).
   - E cannot be in 3, 4, 5 (because it has been marked “-” in positions 5, 4, 3 respectively).

But wait: the word is only 5 letters long and we already know it contains R, O, E, S exactly once each, plus one more letter. That extra letter must be a consonant we haven’t tried yet (cannot be A, T, V).

Let’s tabulate the only possible positions for each required letter:

R: cannot be in 1,2,3,4 → must be in position 5.  
But position 5 is already fixed as S. This is impossible.  
Therefore, our earlier assumption that each of R, O, E appears exactly once is wrong.  

Re-reading the feedback carefully:  
- “R(-)” means R is in the word but not in that position.  
- “O(-)” means O is in the word but not in that position.  
- “E(-)” means E is in the word but not in that position.  
- “S(✓)” means S is in the correct position (position 5).  

So the word contains R, O, E, S (each at least once) and possibly duplicates, but we must not assume duplicates unless forced. However, the word is 5 letters and we have four distinct letters already, so one of them must appear twice.

Looking at the exclusions:

R has been tried in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 → must appear in position 5.  
But position 5 is S. Therefore R cannot appear at all, which contradicts the feedback.  

This means our only resolution is that one of the letters R, O, E must appear twice. The only way this can happen without contradicting the feedback is if the duplicate letter is the one whose position has been ruled out most severely.

Let’s count how many positions each letter has been ruled out of:

- R: positions 1, 2, 3, 4 → must be in 5, but 5 is S → R cannot appear → contradiction.  
- O: positions 2, 3, 4, 5 → must be in 1.  
- E: positions 3, 4, 5 → must be in 1 or 2.

The only letter that can still be placed without contradiction is O, which must be in position 1. E must then be in 2 or 3, and R must somehow avoid positions 1-4 (but cannot be in 5 because 5 is S). This seems impossible unless we allow duplicates.

The only letter that can logically duplicate is S, but S is already fixed in position 5. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that one of R, O, E appears twice, and the extra letter is a new consonant.

Given the constraints, the only viable word structure is:

O _ _ _ S (because O must be in position 1)

With R and E placed in remaining positions and one new consonant.

Possible placements:

O E R _ S → but then where does the new consonant go?  
O _ E R S → but R must not be in 4 (from arose) or 1 (from rotes) or 5 (from overs) → R must be in 2 or 3.  
O _ R E S → E would be in 4, which has been ruled out.  
O R E _ S → but R would be in 2 (allowed), E in 3 (allowed), and the blank would be a new consonant.

Let’s test “ORERS” – but that repeats R.  
“OZERS” – Z is new, but not common.  
“OXERS” – X is new.  
“ONERS” – N is new.  

The most common word fitting O _ R E S is “ONERS” but that’s not a standard word.  

Another structure: O _ _ R S – but R must be in 2 or 3.  

Let’s try O B E R S – B is new.  

But the only standard word that fits O _ _ R S and uses E without contradiction is “OBEAR” but that doesn’t end in S.

Re-evaluate: the feedback shows S is correct in position 5, and R, O, E are all in the word but their exact positions are being narrowed down. The word must contain R, O, E, S and one more consonant, with no A, T, V.

The only remaining possibility is that the word is “ORDER” but that ends in R, not S.  

Wait – let’s list all 5-letter words ending in S that contain R, O, E and one other consonant (not A, T, V).  

Possible candidates:  
- “OZONE” – ends in E, not S.  
- “ROSES” – has S twice, but we don’t know if S can repeat.  
- “ROSES” – R O S E S → contains R, O, E, S and repeats S. This fits the constraints:  
   - S is in position 5 (correct).  
   - R is in position 1 (allowed, since in previous guesses it was marked “-” in positions 2,3,4).  
   - O is in position 2 (allowed, since it was marked “-” in positions 3,2,1 – wait, in overs it was position 1 marked “-”, so O cannot be in 1. So O cannot be in 1,2,3,5 – must be in 4.  

This is getting complex. Let’s use the elimination method:

Current constraints:
- Word ends in S (position 5).
- Must contain R, O, E (each at least once).
- Cannot contain A, T, V.
- Position exclusions:
   - R cannot be in 1,2,3,4 → must be in 5 → but 5 is S → R cannot appear → contradiction.  

This implies our only resolution is that one of R, O, E must appear twice. The only letter that has not been ruled out of every position is E, which must be in 1 or 2.  

Let’s assume E is the one that appears twice. Then the word would be something like E E R O S, but that’s not a word.  

Next, assume O is the one that appears twice. Then the word would be O O R E S – not valid.  

Finally, assume R is the one that appears twice. Then the word would be R O S E R – but ends in R, not S.  

This suggests the only possible word is “ROSES” despite the S repeating, because:
- S is fixed in position 5.  
- R must be in position 1 (only remaining spot).  
- O must be in position 3 (since 1,2,5 are ruled out).  
- E must be in position 4 (since 3,5 are ruled out).  
- The second S in position 4 is allowed because S can repeat.  

Thus, the word must be “ROSES”.

But let’s verify:
- R is in position 1 (allowed, since previous “-” were in 2,3,4).  
- O is in position 3 (allowed, since previous “-” were in 3,2,1 – wait, in arose O was in 3 marked “-”, so O cannot be in 3. Contradiction again.  

This is very tight. The only remaining word that fits all constraints is “OZONE” but it ends in E, not S.  

Realizing the only possible structure is O _ _ _ S with R and E placed such that:
- O is in 1 (must be, since it has been ruled out of 2,3,4,5).  
- R must be in 2 or 3 (cannot be 1,4,5).  
- E must be in remaining spot.  

Possible words:
- O R E _ S – but need a consonant.  
- O R E N S – “ORENS” – not a word.  
- O R E D S – “ORED S” – not valid.  
- O R E K S – “OREKS” – not valid.  

The only standard word fitting is “OBESE” but it lacks R.  

Re-examining: the feedback shows S is correct in 5, and R, O, E are all in the word but their positions are being tested. The word must be a permutation of R, O, E, S plus one consonant, ending in S.  

The only valid word I can find is “ROSES” despite the S repeat, because:
- S is fixed in 5.  
- R must be in 1 (only spot left).  
- O must be in 3 (but was “-” in 3 in arose – cannot be).  

This is impossible. Therefore, the only remaining word is “OZONE” but it ends in E.  

Realizing the only possible word left is “ROSES” even with the S repeat, because all other positions are ruled out. Thus, the feedback must indicate “ROSES”.

But to be precise, the word must be “ROSES”.After carefully analyzing all feedback, the only 5-letter word that fits every constraint is:

Let’s carefully re-examine every clue so far.

Known facts
1. The secret word is 5 letters long and ends with S (position 5 is S).
2. Letters that are definitely in the word: R, O, E, S (S already fixed in position 5).
3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, T, V.
4. Each of R, O, E has been marked “-” in multiple positions, meaning none of those positions can hold that letter.

Position exclusions so far
R cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (because it has been marked “-” in each of those positions in different guesses).  
O cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  
E cannot be in positions 3, 4, 5.

This is impossible unless we allow one of R, O, E to appear twice. The only way this can work is if one of those letters appears once and another appears twice, because we have 5 slots and already have S fixed in slot 5.

Let’s list the only possible distributions:
- One letter appears twice, the others once each, plus S.
- The duplicated letter must be the only one whose positions haven’t been completely ruled out.

Looking at the exclusions:
- R has been excluded from every position (1-5) → cannot be the duplicate.
- O has been excluded from every position (1-5) → cannot be the duplicate.
- E has been excluded from positions 3-5 → must still be in position 1 or 2.

Therefore, E must be the letter that appears twice, and it must occupy both position 1 and either 2 or 3. The only remaining consonant we haven’t tried that isn’t A, T, or V is N, D, L, C, etc.

Possible patterns:
E E R O S  – invalid (not a word)
E R E O S  – invalid
E O E R S  – invalid
E E O R S  – invalid
E N E R S – invalid
E D E R S – invalid
E L E R S – invalid
E R E N S – invalid

The only standard English word that fits the pattern of containing R, O, E, S with E appearing twice and ending in S is:

E E R O S  – not valid  
E R O E S  – not valid  
E O R E S  – not valid  

After exhaustively checking, the only valid 5-letter word that satisfies all constraints is:

E R O E S  – not valid  
Realizing the only possible word left is “OZONE” but it ends in E, not S.  

Upon re-examining, the only valid word that fits is “ROSES” but it was already guessed.  

However, the feedback from Guess 4 (ROSES) shows:
R(-) O(-) S(-) E(-) S(-)

This indicates S cannot be in position 3 (because it was marked “-” there). We already know S is fixed in position 5, so this doesn’t add new info beyond confirming S is in position 5.

Reconstructing the only possible remaining word:
- Position 5: S (fixed)
- E must appear twice and must be in position 1 or 2.
- R and O must appear once each and must be placed in positions not yet excluded.

The only valid placement is:
Position 1: E  
Position 2: R  
Position 3: O  
Position 4: E  
Position 5: S  

This gives the word E R O E S – but this is not a valid English word.

Realizing the only valid word left is “ROSES” and it was already guessed, the only remaining possibility is that the word is “ROSES” despite the S repeat, because all other positions are ruled out.  

Thus, the correct word must be:

<guess>roses</guess>

After re-evaluating all feedback, the only 5-letter word that satisfies every constraint is:

R cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (because it has been marked “-” in each of those positions in different guesses).  
O cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  
E cannot be in positions 3, 4, 5.

Therefore, E must be the letter that appears twice, and it must occupy both position 1 and either 2 or 3. The only remaining consonant we haven’t tried that isn’t A, T, or V is N, D, L, C, etc.

E E R O S  – invalid (not a word)
E R E O S  – invalid
E O E R S  – invalid
E E O R S  – invalid
E N E R S – invalid
E D E R S – invalid
E L E R S – invalid
E R E N S – invalid

The only standard English word that fits the pattern of containing R, O, E, S with E appearing twice and ending in S is:

E E R O S  – not valid  
E R O E S  – not valid  
E O R E S  – not valid  

After exhaustively checking, the only valid 5-letter word that satisfies all constraints is:

E R O E S  – not valid  
Realizing the only possible word left is “OZONE” but it ends in E, not S.  

Upon re-examining, the only valid word that fits is “ROSES” but it was already guessed.  

However, the feedback from Guess 4 (ROSES) shows:
R(-) O(-) S(-) E(-) S(-)

This indicates S cannot be in position 3 (because it was marked “-” there). We already know S is fixed in position 5, so this doesn’t add new info beyond confirming S is in position 5.

Reconstructing the only possible remaining word:
- Position 5: S (fixed)
- E must appear twice and must be in position 1 or 2.
- R and O must appear once each and must be placed in positions not yet excluded.

The only valid placement is:
Position 1: E  
Position 2: R  
Position 3: O  
Position 4: E  
Position 5: S  

This gives the word E R O E S – but this is not a valid English word.

Realizing the only valid word left is “ROSES” and it was already guessed, the only remaining possibility is that the word is “ROSES” despite the S repeat, because all other positions are ruled out.  

Thus, the correct word must be:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word that covers several of these common vowels and consonants. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
This should help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- S is in the correct position (5th letter).
- R, O, and E are all in the word but in the wrong positions.
- A is not in the word at all.

So far we know:
1. The word ends in S.
2. It contains R, O, E somewhere among positions 1-4.
3. It does NOT contain A.

I need a word that:
- Ends in S
- Contains R, O, E (but not in the same positions as AROSE)
- Does not contain A

Let me think of words that fit this pattern. Since R, O, E must appear elsewhere, I can try to rearrange them with other common consonants. A good candidate is ""TROES"" but that seems unlikely. Another is ""ORDER"" but that ends in R, not S. 

""ROTES"" comes to mind: it has R, O, E, and ends in S. Checking positions:
- R would be in position 1 (was position 2 in AROSE) - new position.
- O would be position 2 (was position 3) - new position.
- E would be position 4 (was position 5) - new position.
- T is a new consonant.

This seems like a strong next guess as it reuses R, O, E in different spots while introducing T.

Guess 2: rotes -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) T(x) E(-) S(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s consolidate what we now know after the two guesses.

1. Word structure: _ _ _ _ S  (S is fixed in 5th position).
2. Letters that MUST appear somewhere in positions 1-4: R, O, E.
3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, T.
4. Positions that have been ruled out so far:
   - R cannot be in position 2 (from arose) or position 1 (from rotes).
   - O cannot be in position 3 (from arose) or position 2 (from rotes).
   - E cannot be in position 5 (from arose) or position 4 (from rotes).

So:
- R is allowed in positions 3 or 4.
- O is allowed in positions 1, 4.
- E is allowed in positions 1, 2, 3.

We need a 5-letter word ending in S that contains R, O, E exactly once each, and no A or T.

Let’s list possible patterns that satisfy these constraints and look for common words.

One promising pattern is: E _ R O S
- E in position 1 (allowed).
- R in position 3 (allowed).
- O in position 4 (allowed).
- S in position 5 (fixed).
The missing second letter must be a consonant that hasn’t been ruled out (no A, T). Common choices: D, N, L, etc.

The word “ERROS” fits this pattern:
- E R R O S – but it repeats R, which we don’t know is invalid, yet we want to avoid repeats for maximum info. So skip.

Another pattern: O _ E R S
- O in position 1 (allowed).
- E in position 3 (allowed).
- R in position 4 (allowed).
The second letter must be a new consonant.

A valid word here is “OVERS”:
- O(1), V(2), E(3), R(4), S(5).
Letters: O, V, E, R, S – none of A, T, and uses required letters without repeats.

This seems like the best next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(✓) E(-)
Guess 2: rotes -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) T(x) E(-) S(-)
Guess 3: overs -> FEEDBACK: O(-) V(-) E(-) R(-) S(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three rounds of feedback we now have:

1. S is fixed in position 5.
2. Letters that MUST appear in the word (each exactly once): R, O, E, S.
3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, T, V.
4. Position exclusions so far:
   - R cannot be in 1, 2, 3, 4 (because in each of the three guesses it has been marked “-” in a different position).
   - O cannot be in 2, 3, 4, 5 (because it has been marked “-” in positions 3, 2, 1 respectively).
   - E cannot be in 3, 4, 5 (because it has been marked “-” in positions 5, 4, 3 respectively).

But wait: the word is only 5 letters long and we already know it contains R, O, E, S exactly once each, plus one more letter. That extra letter must be a consonant we haven’t tried yet (cannot be A, T, V).

Let’s tabulate the only possible positions for each required letter:

R: cannot be in 1,2,3,4 → must be in position 5.  
But position 5 is already fixed as S. This is impossible.  
Therefore, our earlier assumption that each of R, O, E appears exactly once is wrong.  

Re-reading the feedback carefully:  
- “R(-)” means R is in the word but not in that position.  
- “O(-)” means O is in the word but not in that position.  
- “E(-)” means E is in the word but not in that position.  
- “S(✓)” means S is in the correct position (position 5).  

So the word contains R, O, E, S (each at least once) and possibly duplicates, but we must not assume duplicates unless forced. However, the word is 5 letters and we have four distinct letters already, so one of them must appear twice.

Looking at the exclusions:

R has been tried in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 → must appear in position 5.  
But position 5 is S. Therefore R cannot appear at all, which contradicts the feedback.  

This means our only resolution is that one of the letters R, O, E must appear twice. The only way this can happen without contradicting the feedback is if the duplicate letter is the one whose position has been ruled out most severely.

Let’s count how many positions each letter has been ruled out of:

- R: positions 1, 2, 3, 4 → must be in 5, but 5 is S → R cannot appear → contradiction.  
- O: positions 2, 3, 4, 5 → must be in 1.  
- E: positions 3, 4, 5 → must be in 1 or 2.

The only letter that can still be placed without contradiction is O, which must be in position 1. E must then be in 2 or 3, and R must somehow avoid positions 1-4 (but cannot be in 5 because 5 is S). This seems impossible unless we allow duplicates.

The only letter that can logically duplicate is S, but S is already fixed in position 5. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that one of R, O, E appears twice, and the extra letter is a new consonant.

Given the constraints, the only viable word structure is:

O _ _ _ S (because O must be in position 1)

With R and E placed in remaining positions and one new consonant.

Possible placements:

O E R _ S → but then where does the new consonant go?  
O _ E R S → but R must not be in 4 (from arose) or 1 (from rotes) or 5 (from overs) → R must be in 2 or 3.  
O _ R E S → E would be in 4, which has been ruled out.  
O R E _ S → but R would be in 2 (allowed), E in 3 (allowed), and the blank would be a new consonant.

Let’s test “ORERS” – but that repeats R.  
“OZERS” – Z is new, but not common.  
“OXERS” – X is new.  
“ONERS” – N is new.  

The most common word fitting O _ R E S is “ONERS” but that’s not a standard word.  

Another structure: O _ _ R S – but R must be in 2 or 3.  

Let’s try O B E R S – B is new.  

But the only standard word that fits O _ _ R S and uses E without contradiction is “OBEAR” but that doesn’t end in S.

Re-evaluate: the feedback shows S is correct in position 5, and R, O, E are all in the word but their exact positions are being narrowed down. The word must contain R, O, E, S and one more consonant, with no A, T, V.

The only remaining possibility is that the word is “ORDER” but that ends in R, not S.  

Wait – let’s list all 5-letter words ending in S that contain R, O, E and one other consonant (not A, T, V).  

Possible candidates:  
- “OZONE” – ends in E, not S.  
- “ROSES” – has S twice, but we don’t know if S can repeat.  
- “ROSES” – R O S E S → contains R, O, E, S and repeats S. This fits the constraints:  
   - S is in position 5 (correct).  
   - R is in position 1 (allowed, since in previous guesses it was marked “-” in positions 2,3,4).  
   - O is in position 2 (allowed, since it was marked “-” in positions 3,2,1 – wait, in overs it was position 1 marked “-”, so O cannot be in 1. So O cannot be in 1,2,3,5 – must be in 4.  

This is getting complex. Let’s use the elimination method:

Current constraints:
- Word ends in S (position 5).
- Must contain R, O, E (each at least once).
- Cannot contain A, T, V.
- Position exclusions:
   - R cannot be in 1,2,3,4 → must be in 5 → but 5 is S → R cannot appear → contradiction.  

This implies our only resolution is that one of R, O, E must appear twice. The only letter that has not been ruled out of every position is E, which must be in 1 or 2.  

Let’s assume E is the one that appears twice. Then the word would be something like E E R O S, but that’s not a word.  

Next, assume O is the one that appears twice. Then the word would be O O R E S – not valid.  

Finally, assume R is the one that appears twice. Then the word would be R O S E R – but ends in R, not S.  

This suggests the only possible word is “ROSES” despite the S repeating, because:
- S is fixed in position 5.  
- R must be in position 1 (only remaining spot).  
- O must be in position 3 (since 1,2,5 are ruled out).  
- E must be in position 4 (since 3,5 are ruled out).  
- The second S in position 4 is allowed because S can repeat.  

Thus, the word must be “ROSES”.

But let’s verify:
- R is in position 1 (allowed, since previous “-” were in 2,3,4).  
- O is in position 3 (allowed, since previous “-” were in 3,2,1 – wait, in arose O was in 3 marked “-”, so O cannot be in 3. Contradiction again.  

This is very tight. The only remaining word that fits all constraints is “OZONE” but it ends in E, not S.  

Realizing the only possible structure is O _ _ _ S with R and E placed such that:
- O is in 1 (must be, since it has been ruled out of 2,3,4,5).  
- R must be in 2 or 3 (cannot be 1,4,5).  
- E must be in remaining spot.  

Possible words:
- O R E _ S – but need a consonant.  
- O R E N S – “ORENS” – not a word.  
- O R E D S – “ORED S” – not valid.  
- O R E K S – “OREKS” – not valid.  

The only standard word fitting is “OBESE” but it lacks R.  

Re-examining: the feedback shows S is correct in 5, and R, O, E are all in the word but their positions are being tested. The word must be a permutation of R, O, E, S plus one consonant, ending in S.  

The only valid word I can find is “ROSES” despite the S repeat, because:
- S is fixed in 5.  
- R must be in 1 (only spot left).  
- O must be in 3 (but was “-” in 3 in arose – cannot be).  

This is impossible. Therefore, the only remaining word is “OZONE” but it ends in E.  

Realizing the only possible word left is “ROSES” even with the S repeat, because all other positions are ruled out. Thus, the feedback must indicate “ROSES”.

But to be precise, the word must be “ROSES”.After carefully analyzing all feedback, the only 5-letter word that fits every constraint is:

<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s carefully re-examine every clue so far.

Known facts
1. The secret word is 5 letters long and ends with S (position 5 is S).
2. Letters that are definitely in the word: R, O, E, S (S already fixed in position 5).
3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, T, V.
4. Each of R, O, E has been marked “-” in multiple positions, meaning none of those positions can hold that letter.

Position exclusions so far
R cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (because it has been marked “-” in each of those positions in different guesses).  
O cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  
E cannot be in positions 3, 4, 5.

This is impossible unless we allow one of R, O, E to appear twice. The only way this can work is if one of those letters appears once and another appears twice, because we have 5 slots and already have S fixed in slot 5.

Let’s list the only possible distributions:
- One letter appears twice, the others once each, plus S.
- The duplicated letter must be the only one whose positions haven’t been completely ruled out.

Looking at the exclusions:
- R has been excluded from every position (1-5) → cannot be the duplicate.
- O has been excluded from every position (1-5) → cannot be the duplicate.
- E has been excluded from positions 3-5 → must still be in position 1 or 2.

Therefore, E must be the letter that appears twice, and it must occupy both position 1 and either 2 or 3. The only remaining consonant we haven’t tried that isn’t A, T, or V is N, D, L, C, etc.

Possible patterns:
E E R O S  – invalid (not a word)
E R E O S  – invalid
E O E R S  – invalid
E E O R S  – invalid
E N E R S – invalid
E D E R S – invalid
E L E R S – invalid
E R E N S – invalid

The only standard English word that fits the pattern of containing R, O, E, S with E appearing twice and ending in S is:

E E R O S  – not valid  
E R O E S  – not valid  
E O R E S  – not valid  

After exhaustively checking, the only valid 5-letter word that satisfies all constraints is:

E R O E S  – not valid  
Realizing the only possible word left is “OZONE” but it ends in E, not S.  

Upon re-examining, the only valid word that fits is “ROSES” but it was already guessed.  

However, the feedback from Guess 4 (ROSES) shows:
R(-) O(-) S(-) E(-) S(-)

This indicates S cannot be in position 3 (because it was marked “-” there). We already know S is fixed in position 5, so this doesn’t add new info beyond confirming S is in position 5.

Reconstructing the only possible remaining word:
- Position 5: S (fixed)
- E must appear twice and must be in position 1 or 2.
- R and O must appear once each and must be placed in positions not yet excluded.

The only valid placement is:
Position 1: E  
Position 2: R  
Position 3: O  
Position 4: E  
Position 5: S  

This gives the word E R O E S – but this is not a valid English word.

Realizing the only valid word left is “ROSES” and it was already guessed, the only remaining possibility is that the word is “ROSES” despite the S repeat, because all other positions are ruled out.  

Thus, the correct word must be:

However, the word is 5 letters and we have four distinct letters already, so one of them must appear twice.\n\nLooking at the exclusions:\n\nR has been tried in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 → must appear in position 5.  \nBut position 5 is S. Therefore R cannot appear at all, which contradicts the feedback.  \n\nThis means our only resolution is that one of the letters R, O, E must appear twice. The only way this can happen without contradicting the feedback is if the duplicate letter is the one whose position has been ruled out most severely.\n\nLet’s count how many positions each letter has been ruled out of:\n\n- R: positions 1, 2, 3, 4 → must be in 5, but 5 is S → R cannot appear → contradiction.  \n- O: positions 2, 3, 4, 5 → must be in 1.  \n- E: positions 3, 4, 5 → must be in 1 or 2.\n\nThe only letter that can still be placed without contradiction is O, which must be in position 1. E must then be in 2 or 3, and R must somehow avoid positions 1-4 (but cannot be in 5 because 5 is S). This seems impossible unless we allow duplicates.\n\nThe only letter that can logically duplicate is S, but S is already fixed in position 5. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that one of R, O, E appears twice, and the extra letter is a new consonant.\n\nGiven the constraints, the only viable word structure is:\n\nO _ _ _ S (because O must be in position 1)\n\nWith R and E placed in remaining positions and one new consonant.\n\nPossible placements:\n\nO E R _ S → but then where does the new consonant go?  \nO _ E R S → but R must not be in 4 (from arose) or 1 (from rotes) or 5 (from overs) → R must be in 2 or 3.  \nO _ R E S → E would be in 4, which has been ruled out.  \nO R E _ S → but R would be in 2 (allowed), E in 3 (allowed), and the blank would be a new consonant.\n\nLet’s test “ORERS” – but that repeats R.  \n“OZERS” – Z is new, but not common.  \n“OXERS” – X is new.  \n“ONERS” – N is new.  \n\nThe most common word fitting O _ R E S is “ONERS” but that’s not a standard word.  \n\nAnother structure: O _ _ R S – but R must be in 2 or 3.  \n\nLet’s try O B E R S – B is new.  \n\nBut the only standard word that fits O _ _ R S and uses E without contradiction is “OBEAR” but that doesn’t end in S.\n\nRe-evaluate: the feedback shows S is correct in position 5, and R, O, E are all in the word but their exact positions are being narrowed down. The word must contain R, O, E, S and one more consonant, with no A, T, V.\n\nThe only remaining possibility is that the word is “ORDER” but that ends in R, not S.  \n\nWait – let’s list all 5-letter words ending in S that contain R, O, E and one other consonant (not A, T, V).  \n\nPossible candidates:  \n- “OZONE” – ends in E, not S.  \n- “ROSES” – has S twice, but we don’t know if S can repeat.  \n- “ROSES” – R O S E S → contains R, O, E, S and repeats S. This fits the constraints:  \n   - S is in position 5 (correct).  \n   - R is in position 1 (allowed, since in previous guesses it was marked “-” in positions 2,3,4).  \n   - O is in position 2 (allowed, since it was marked “-” in positions 3,2,1 – wait, in overs it was position 1 marked “-”, so O cannot be in 1. So O cannot be in 1,2,3,5 – must be in 4.  \n\nThis is getting complex. Let’s use the elimination method:\n\nCurrent constraints:\n- Word ends in S (position 5).\n- Must contain R, O, E (each at least once).\n- Cannot contain A, T, V.\n- Position exclusions:\n   - R cannot be in 1,2,3,4 → must be in 5 → but 5 is S → R cannot appear → contradiction.  \n\nThis implies our only resolution is that one of R, O, E must appear twice. The only letter that has not been ruled out of every position is E, which must be in 1 or 2.  \n\nLet’s assume E is the one that appears twice. Then the word would be something like E E R O S, but that’s not a word.  \n\nNext, assume O is the one that appears twice. Then the word would be O O R E S – not valid.  \n\nFinally, assume R is the one that appears twice. Then the word would be R O S E R – but ends in R, not S.  \n\nThis suggests the only possible word is “ROSES” despite the S repeating, because:\n- S is fixed in position 5.  \n- R must be in position 1 (only remaining spot).  \n- O must be in position 3 (since 1,2,5 are ruled out).  \n- E must be in position 4 (since 3,5 are ruled out).  \n- The second S in position 4 is allowed because S can repeat.  \n\nThus, the word must be “ROSES”.\n\nBut let’s verify:\n- R is in position 1 (allowed, since previous “-” were in 2,3,4).  \n- O is in position 3 (allowed, since previous “-” were in 3,2,1 – wait, in arose O was in 3 marked “-”, so O cannot be in 3. Contradiction again.  \n\nThis is very tight. The only remaining word that fits all constraints is “OZONE” but it ends in E, not S.  \n\nRealizing the only possible structure is O _ _ _ S with R and E placed such that:\n- O is in 1 (must be, since it has been ruled out of 2,3,4,5).  \n- R must be in 2 or 3 (cannot be 1,4,5).  \n- E must be in remaining spot.  \n\nPossible words:\n- O R E _ S – but need a consonant.  \n- O R E N S – “ORENS” – not a word.  \n- O R E D S – “ORED S” – not valid.  \n- O R E K S – “OREKS” – not valid.  \n\nThe only standard word fitting is “OBESE” but it lacks R.  \n\nRe-examining: the feedback shows S is correct in 5, and R, O, E are all in the word but their positions are being tested. The word must be a permutation of R, O, E, S plus one consonant, ending in S.  \n\nThe only valid word I can find is “ROSES” despite the S repeat, because:\n- S is fixed in 5.  \n- R must be in 1 (only spot left).  \n- O must be in 3 (but was “-” in 3 in arose – cannot be).  \n\nThis is impossible. Therefore, the only remaining word is “OZONE” but it ends in E.  \n\nRealizing the only possible word left is “ROSES” even with the S repeat, because all other positions are ruled out. Thus, the feedback must indicate “ROSES”.\n\nBut to be precise, the word must be “ROSES”.After carefully analyzing all feedback, the only 5-letter word that fits every constraint is:\n\n<guess>roses</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(✓) E(-)\nGuess 2: rotes -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) T(x) E(-) S(-)\nGuess 3: overs -> FEEDBACK: O(-) V(-) E(-) R(-) S(-)\nGuess 4: roses -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) S(-) E(-) S(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Let’s carefully re-examine every clue so far.\n\nKnown facts\n1.

All previous feedback shows the same pattern:

- Position 5 is definitely S (✓ in arose, and repeated in rotes and roses).
- Letters R, O, E are all present but have been marked “-” in every position tried so far.
- Letters A, T, V are out.
- No consonant other than these four has appeared in the feedback.

The only way this can continue is if one of R, O, E appears twice, and the other two appear once each, plus the single S in position 5.

Let’s list every position and what can or cannot sit there:

1. Cannot be A, T, V, R (from arose), O (from rotes), E (from rotes)  
   → Allowed: any consonant except A, T, V, R, O, E (e.g. N, D, L, C, etc.)

2. Cannot be A, T, V, R (from arose), O (from rotes), E (from rotes)  
   → Same allowed set.

3. Cannot be A, T, V, R (from arose), O (from rotes), E (from rotes)  
   → Same allowed set.

4. Cannot be A, T, V, R (from rotes), O (from rotes), E (from rotes)  
   → Same allowed set.

5. Must be S.

We know R, O, E must all appear once each plus one duplicate among them, and the duplicate must fill the remaining slot. The only remaining consonants we haven’t tried that are legal are N, D, L, C, etc.

The only valid English word that fits:

- Ends with S (position 5).
- Contains R, O, E with one duplicate.
- Uses only allowed consonants elsewhere.

The only such word is:

C O R E S → C O R E S  
Check positions:
1. C – allowed.  
2. O – allowed (not yet excluded from position 2).  
3. R – allowed (not yet excluded from position 3).  
4. E – allowed (not yet excluded from position 4).  
5. S – fixed.

All letters used are legal, and every required letter (R, O, E, S) appears. The duplicate is E (position 4), which hasn’t been ruled out of appearing twice.
