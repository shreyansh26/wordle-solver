For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in 5-letter words. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which vowels are present and their positions, as well as whether R or S are in the word.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" which covers common letters but has slightly less common vowels (only A and E). Between these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides a better mix of common letters.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is NOT in the word (x).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- O is NOT in the word (x).
- S is NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: A, O, S.
- Letters present somewhere: R, E.
- R is not in position 2, E is not in position 5.

I need a 5-letter word that contains both R and E (but not in positions 2 or 5 respectively), and does NOT contain A, O, or S.

Let me think of a word that uses these letters in new positions. The word ""Tiger"" comes to mind:
- T is a new consonant.
- I is a new vowel.
- G is a new consonant.
- R is now in position 4 (was in position 2 before).
- E is now in position 5 (was in position 5 before, but feedback said E is in the word but wrong position, so position 5 is wrong for E, meaning E cannot be in position 5. So ""tiger"" is invalid because E is in position 5).

Next, ""Rider"":
- R is in position 1 (was in 2 before, so this is new).
- I is a new vowel.
- D is a new consonant.
- E is in position 4 (was in 5 before, so this is new).
- R is in position 3 (but we already have R in position 1, and letters can repeat, but we don't know if R appears more than once. However, the feedback didn't say R only appears once, so this is acceptable).

But ""rider"" has R twice, which might not be necessary. Let me think of a word with R and E in new positions, avoiding A, O, S.

""TREND"" - but S is not allowed, and N/D are new letters. But E is in position 2, R in position 1 - this could work:
- T is new.
- R is in position 1 (was in 2 before).
- E is in position 2 (was in 5 before).
- N is new.
- D is new.

This seems valid as it tests new positions for R and E, and introduces new letters T, N, D.

However, I want to maximize information with one guess. Another option is ""ENTRY"":
- E in position 1 (was in 5 before, so new).
- N is new.
- T is new.
- R is in position 4 (was in 2 before, so new).
- Y is new.

This tests E in position 1 and R in position 4, plus new letters N, T, Y.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in 5-letter words. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which vowels are present and their positions, as well as whether R or S are in the word.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" which covers common letters but has slightly less common vowels (only A and E). Between these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides a better mix of common letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is NOT in the word (x).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- O is NOT in the word (x).
- S is NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: A, O, S.
- Letters present somewhere: R, E.
- R is not in position 2, E is not in position 5.

I need a 5-letter word that contains both R and E (but not in positions 2 or 5 respectively), and does NOT contain A, O, or S.

Let me think of a word that uses these letters in new positions. The word ""Tiger"" comes to mind:
- T is a new consonant.
- I is a new vowel.
- G is a new consonant.
- R is now in position 4 (was in position 2 before).
- E is now in position 5 (was in position 5 before, but feedback said E is in the word but wrong position, so position 5 is wrong for E, meaning E cannot be in position 5. So ""tiger"" is invalid because E is in position 5).

Next, ""Rider"":
- R is in position 1 (was in 2 before, so this is new).
- I is a new vowel.
- D is a new consonant.
- E is in position 4 (was in 5 before, so this is new).
- R is in position 3 (but we already have R in position 1, and letters can repeat, but we don't know if R appears more than once. However, the feedback didn't say R only appears once, so this is acceptable).

But ""rider"" has R twice, which might not be necessary. Let me think of a word with R and E in new positions, avoiding A, O, S.

""TREND"" - but S is not allowed, and N/D are new letters. But E is in position 2, R in position 1 - this could work:
- T is new.
- R is in position 1 (was in 2 before).
- E is in position 2 (was in 5 before).
- N is new.
- D is new.

This seems valid as it tests new positions for R and E, and introduces new letters T, N, D.

However, I want to maximize information with one guess. Another option is ""ENTRY"":
- E in position 1 (was in 5 before, so new).
- N is new.
- T is new.
- R is in position 4 (was in 2 before, so new).
- Y is new.

This tests E in position 1 and R in position 4, plus new letters N, T, Y.

Between ""trend"" and ""entry"", ""entry"" seems better as it covers more new letters. I'll go with ""entry"".

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on ""entry"":
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
- N is in the correct position (position 2).  
- T is NOT in the word (x).  
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
- Y is NOT in the word (x).

So far we know:
- Letters definitely absent: A, O, S, T, Y.  
- Letters definitely present: N (locked in position 2), R, E.  
- Positions that are wrong for each:
  – E cannot be in position 1 or 5.  
  – R cannot be in position 2 or 4.  
  – N is fixed in position 2.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- N in position 2.  
- Both R and E somewhere else (positions 3 or 4 for E; positions 1, 3 or 5 for R).  
- No A, O, S, T, Y.

Good candidates:
- “INNER” – but we already know N is in position 2, and we don’t know if I is present.  
- “PERON” – but P and O are still possible (though O is ruled out).  
- “FERN” – too short.  
- “REND” – but D is new and E is in position 2 (which we know is wrong for E).  
- “CREEK” – but K is new and E is in position 2 (invalid).  
- “DINNER” – too long.  
- “PENRO” – invalid (O).  
- “GENRE” – but G is new, E is in position 5 (which is invalid).  
- “CRANE” – but A is ruled out.  
- “BRINE” – I is new, B is new, but E is in position 5 (invalid).  
- “PRUNE” – U is new, P is new, but E is in position 5 (invalid).  
- “CHORE” – O and H are new, but O is invalid.  
- “DUNER” – D and U are new, E is in position 4 (valid), R is in position 5 (valid), N is fixed in position 2.

“DUNER” fits all constraints:
- N in position 2 (✓).  
- E in position 4 (valid, since E cannot be in 1 or 5).  
- R in position 5 (valid, since R cannot be in 2 or 4).  
- New letters D and U for maximum information.  

Let’s use “DUNER”.

The feedback from ""duner"" tells us:

- D is NOT in the word (x).
- U is NOT in the word (x).
- N is in the correct position (position 3) – but we already knew N is in position 2 from the second guess. Wait, that’s a contradiction. Let me re-read carefully.

Actually, the feedback is:

- D(x) → D is NOT in the word.
- U(x) → U is NOT in the word.
- N(✓) → N is in the correct position. From the second guess we had N in position 2, so this confirms N is in position 2.
- E(✓) → E is in the correct position. From the second guess E was in position 1, but the feedback said E(-) meaning it was in the word but wrong position. Now in ""duner"" E is in position 4 and feedback is E(✓), so E is in position 4.
- R(✓) → R is in the correct position. From the second guess R was in position 4, but feedback was R(-) meaning wrong position. Now in ""duner"" R is in position 5 and feedback is R(✓), so R is in position 5.

So now we know the pattern is: _ N _ E R

Letters definitely absent so far: A, O, S, T, Y, D, U.

We need a 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ N _ E R and uses no forbidden letters.

Possible letters left: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (excluding the used and banned ones).

Possible words:
- B N E E R – no, only one E.
- C N E E R – same.
- F N E E R – same.
- G N E E R – same.
- H N E E R – same.
- I N E E R – same.
- K N E E R – same.
- L N E E R – same.
- M N E E R – same.
- P N E E R – same.
- V N E E R – same.
- W N E E R – same.
- Z N E E R – same.

Wait, the word must be _ N _ E R with a single E in position 4. The third letter must be a consonant that hasn't been used or banned.

Looking at common 5-letter words ending in ""NER"":
- C N E E R – no.
- B N E E R – no.
- F N E E R – no.
- H N E E R – no.
- L N E E R – no.
- M N E E R – no.
- P N E E R – no.
- V N E E R – no.
- W N E E R – no.

Actually, common words ending in ""NER"" with N in position 2 and E in position 4 are rare. Let me think differently.

The pattern is: _ N _ E R

Possible words:
- B N E E R – doesn't exist.
- C N E E R – doesn't exist.
- F N E E R – doesn't exist.
- G N E E R – doesn't exist.
- H N E E R – doesn't exist.
- I N E E R – doesn't exist.
- K N E E R – doesn't exist.
- L N E E R – doesn't exist.
- M N E E R – doesn't exist.
- P N E E R – doesn't exist.
- S N E E R – but S is banned.
- T N E E R – T is banned.
- V N E E R – doesn't exist.
- W N E E R – doesn't exist.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me list possible consonants for position 1 and 3, avoiding banned letters.

Banned letters: A, O, S, T, Y, D, U.

Possible position 1: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Possible position 3: same, but not E (already in position 4).

Possible words:
- B N I E R – ""b n i e r"" – no such word.
- C N I E R – ""c n i e r"" – no.
- F N I E R – no.
- G N I E R – no.
- H N I E R – no.
- K N I E R – no.
- L N I E R – no.
- M N I E R – no.
- P N I E R – no.
- V N I E R – no.
- W N I E R – no.

Wait, let me try with different vowels in position 3.

But position 3 must be a consonant (since vowels are A, E, I, O, U and E is already in position 4, others are banned).

Actually, the word must be _ N _ E R with a consonant in position 3.

Looking up valid 5-letter words matching this pattern:

- B N E E R – invalid.
- C N E E R – invalid.
- F N E E R – invalid.
- G N E E R – invalid.
- H N E E R – invalid.
- K N E E R – invalid.
- L N E E R – invalid.
- M N E E R – invalid.
- P N E E R – invalid.
- V N E E R – invalid.
- W N E E R – invalid.

This seems impossible. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the feedback.

Re-reading the feedback for ""duner"":
- D(x) – D not in word.
- U(x) – U not in word.
- N(✓) – N is in the correct position. From ""entry"" we had N in position 2, so N is in position 2.
- E(✓) – E is in the correct position. From ""entry"" E was in position 1 (but feedback was E(-)), so in ""duner"" E is in position 4 and is correct there. So E is in position 4.
- R(✓) – R is in the correct position. From ""entry"" R was in position 4 (but feedback was R(-)), so in ""duner"" R is in position 5 and is correct there. So R is in position 5.

Thus the pattern is: _ N _ E R

Looking for valid words with this pattern:

- B N E E R – invalid.
- C N E E R – invalid.
- F N E E R – invalid.
- G N E E R – invalid.
- H N E E R – invalid.
- K N E E R – invalid.
- L N E E R – invalid.
- M N E E R – invalid.
- P N E E R – invalid.
- V N E E R – invalid.
- W N E E R – invalid.

This seems impossible. Let me check if any words fit _ N _ E R:

Actually, the word ""INNER"" fits _ N _ E R:
- I N N E R – but N is in position 2 and 3, which might not be the case.

But we know N is only in position 2 (from ""entry"" feedback N(✓) in position 2), so ""INNER"" would have N in position 3 as well, which might not conflict but seems unlikely.

Another word: ""PENNE"" – but E is in position 4, N in position 2, but PENNE has N in position 3 and 4, and E in 5, which doesn't fit.

Wait, let me think of common words ending in ""NER"" with N in position 2:

- C N E R – too short.
- B N E R – too short.
- G N E R – too short.

Actually, the pattern _ N _ E R is quite restrictive. Let me try:

- B N I E R – no.
- C N I E R – no.
- F N I E R – no.
- H N I E R – no.
- K N I E R – no.
- L N I E R – no.
- M N I E R – no.
- P N I E R – no.
- V N I E R – no.
- W N I E R – no.

This seems impossible. Maybe I misread the feedback.

Looking back at ""duner"" feedback:
- D(x) – D not in word.
- U(x) – U not in word.
- N(✓) – N is in the correct position. From ""entry"" N was in position 2, so N is in position 2.
- E(✓) – E is in the correct position. From ""entry"" E was in position 1 (but feedback E(-)), so in ""duner"" E is in position 4 and is correct, so E is in position 4.
- R(✓) – R is in the correct position. From ""entry"" R was in position 4 (but feedback R(-)), so in ""duner"" R is in position 5 and is correct, so R is in position 5.

Thus the pattern is: _ N _ E R

Looking this up, valid 5-letter words with this pattern are rare. One possible word is ""P N E E R"" – but that's not a word.

Actually, the word ""INNER"" has I in position 1, N in position 2, N in position 3, E in position 4, R in position 5. This fits _ N _ E R with the third letter also N. 

But we know N is in position 2 (from ""entry""), and ""INNER"" has N in position 3 as well. This doesn't conflict with the feedback, as the feedback only says N is in position 2, not necessarily unique.

So ""INNER"" is a valid candidate.

Other possibilities:
- ""T N E E R"" – but T is banned.
- ""S N E E R"" – but S is banned.
- ""C N E E R"" – invalid.
- ""G N E E R"" – invalid.

Thus, the most likely word is ""INNER"".

But let me double-check:
- I – new letter.
- N – correct position 2.
- N – possible duplicate.
- E – correct position 4.
- R – correct position 5.

This seems valid.
</think>

From the feedback:
- Pattern is _ N _ E R
- Valid word fitting this is ""INNER"".

Possible position 3: same, but not E (already in position 4).

Possible words:
- B N I E R – ""b n i e r"" – no such word.
- C N I E R – ""c n i e r"" – no.
- F N I E R – no.
- G N I E R – no.
- H N I E R – no.
- K N I E R – no.
- L N I E R – no.
- M N I E R – no.
- P N I E R – no.
- V N I E R – no.
- W N I E R – no.

Wait, let me try with different vowels in position 3.

But position 3 must be a consonant (since vowels are A, E, I, O, U and E is already in position 4, others are banned).

Actually, the word must be _ N _ E R with a consonant in position 3.

Looking up valid 5-letter words matching this pattern:

- B N E E R – invalid.
- C N E E R – invalid.
- F N E E R – invalid.
- G N E E R – invalid.
- H N E E R – invalid.
- K N E E R – invalid.
- L N E E R – invalid.
- M N E E R – invalid.
- P N E E R – invalid.
- V N E E R – invalid.
- W N E E R – invalid.

This seems impossible. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the feedback.

Re-reading the feedback for ""duner"":
- D(x) – D not in word.
- U(x) – U not in word.
- N(✓) – N is in the correct position. From ""entry"" we had N in position 2, so N is in position 2.
- E(✓) – E is in the correct position. From ""entry"" E was in position 1 (but feedback was E(-)), so in ""duner"" E is in position 4 and is correct there. So E is in position 4.
- R(✓) – R is in the correct position. From ""entry"" R was in position 4 (but feedback was R(-)), so in ""duner"" R is in position 5 and is correct there. So R is in position 5.

Thus the pattern is: _ N _ E R

Looking for valid words with this pattern:

- B N E E R – invalid.
- C N E E R – invalid.
- F N E E R – invalid.
- G N E E R – invalid.
- H N E E R – invalid.
- K N E E R – invalid.
- L N E E R – invalid.
- M N E E R – invalid.
- P N E E R – invalid.
- V N E E R – invalid.
- W N E E R – invalid.

This seems impossible. Let me check if any words fit _ N _ E R:

Actually, the word ""INNER"" fits _ N _ E R:
- I N N E R – but N is in position 2 and 3, which might not be the case.

But we know N is only in position 2 (from ""entry"" feedback N(✓) in position 2), so ""INNER"" would have N in position 3 as well, which might not conflict but seems unlikely.

Another word: ""PENNE"" – but E is in position 4, N in position 2, but PENNE has N in position 3 and 4, and E in 5, which doesn't fit.

Wait, let me think of common words ending in ""NER"" with N in position 2:

- C N E R – too short.
- B N E R – too short.
- G N E R – too short.

Actually, the pattern _ N _ E R is quite restrictive. Let me try:

- B N I E R – no.
- C N I E R – no.
- F N I E R – no.
- H N I E R – no.
- K N I E R – no.
- L N I E R – no.
- M N I E R – no.
- P N I E R – no.
- V N I E R – no.
- W N I E R – no.

This seems impossible. Maybe I misread the feedback.

Looking back at ""duner"" feedback:
- D(x) – D not in word.
- U(x) – U not in word.
- N(✓) – N is in the correct position. From ""entry"" N was in position 2, so N is in position 2.
- E(✓) – E is in the correct position. From ""entry"" E was in position 1 (but feedback E(-)), so in ""duner"" E is in position 4 and is correct, so E is in position 4.
- R(✓) – R is in the correct position. From ""entry"" R was in position 4 (but feedback R(-)), so in ""duner"" R is in position 5 and is correct, so R is in position 5.

Thus the pattern is: _ N _ E R

Looking this up, valid 5-letter words with this pattern are rare. One possible word is ""P N E E R"" – but that's not a word.

Actually, the word ""INNER"" has I in position 1, N in position 2, N in position 3, E in position 4, R in position 5. This fits _ N _ E R with the third letter also N. 

But we know N is in position 2 (from ""entry""), and ""INNER"" has N in position 3 as well. This doesn't conflict with the feedback, as the feedback only says N is in position 2, not necessarily unique.

So ""INNER"" is a valid candidate.

Other possibilities:
- ""T N E E R"" – but T is banned.
- ""S N E E R"" – but S is banned.
- ""C N E E R"" – invalid.
- ""G N E E R"" – invalid.

Thus, the most likely word is ""INNER"".

But let me double-check:
- I – new letter.
- N – correct position 2.
- N – possible duplicate.
- E – correct position 4.
- R – correct position 5.

This seems valid.From the feedback:
- Pattern is _ N _ E R
- Valid word fitting this is ""INNER"".",Guess 4: inner -> FEEDBACK: I(✓) N(✓) N(✓) E(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
