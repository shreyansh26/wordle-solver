### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use some of these letters. 

Looking at these letters, ""SLATE"" is an excellent choice because it contains S, L, A, T, and E - all very common letters, and covers vowels (A, E) and several consonants (S, L, T). This should give us good information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- T is in the correct position (✓) — so the word is _ _ _ T _
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word ends with T
- It contains A somewhere NOT in position 3
- It does NOT contain S, L, or E

We need a 5-letter word ending in T that includes A somewhere else. Common consonants we haven’t tried yet: R, N, D, C, M, P, etc. Let’s pick a word that uses fresh common letters while respecting the constraints.

A good candidate is ""CRANK"":
- Ends with T (✓)
- Contains A (in position 3, but we know A isn’t in position 3, so this might be risky)
Wait, no — A is in position 3 in CRANK, and we know A isn’t in position 3 (from SLATE feedback), so CRANK is invalid.

Let’s try ""RANCH"" — but it doesn’t end with T.

Next candidate: ""CHANT"" — ends with T, has A in position 2. This seems safe:
- C, H, A, N, T
- A is in position 2 (not 3), so this fits the constraints
- Uses new letters C, H, N

From the new feedback on CHANT:
- C(x), H(x), N(x) — none of these letters are in the word.

The feedback on CHANT says T is in the wrong position (-) at position 5, which is consistent because T is indeed in position 4, not 5. So word pattern: _ _ _ T _.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, E, C, H, N
- Letters in the word: A (not in positions 2 or 3), T (fixed at position 4)
- Remaining positions 1, 2, 5 to fill with letters not yet ruled out.

We need a word ending in T, containing A, with A not in position 2 or 3, and avoiding S, L, E, C, H, N.

Let’s try “GRAFT”:
- G, R, A, F, T
- A is in position 3 → but SLATE said A is not in position 3. So GRAFT is invalid.

Next: “WRATH” — W, R, A, T, H. H is already out.

“BRAID” — doesn’t end in T.

“FRATE” — ends in E, which is out.

“PLATE” — ends in E, out.

Wait, we need A not in positions 2 or 3, and T in position 4, and word ends in T? No, word ends in T is confirmed by SLATE (T at position 4 is ✓). So word is _ _ _ T _.

So A must be in position 1 or 5.

Let’s try A in position 1: A _ _ T _

Possible letters left: R, D, M, P, G, B, F, K, V, W, Y, I, O, U.

Try “ARGOT” — A, R, G, O, T. A is in position 1, T in 5. But SLATE said T is in position 4. So ARGOT is invalid (T at 5).

“ABORT” — A, B, O, R, T. T at 5 — invalid.

“AVERT” — A, V, E, R, T. E is out.

“AWARD” — ends in D.

“AWFUL” — ends in L, out.

“AXIAL” — ends in L, out.

“APORT” — not a word.

“ABORT” — ends in T, but T at 5.

“ABUZZ” — ends in Z.

Let’s try A in position 5: _ _ _ T A.

We need a word ending in TA, with T in position 4.

Valid 5-letter words ending in TA with T in 4th:
- BUILT? No, ends in T.
- CHART? No.
- FROST? No.
- GRANT? No.
- HEART? No.
- LEANT? No.
- PLANT? No.
- SHALT? No.

- PLANT? No.
- SHALT? No.
- SKINT? No.
- STINT? No.
- SWUNG? No.
- VITAL? Ends in L.
- WRATH? Ends in H.

Hmm, seems rare. Let me think differently.

We need _ _ _ T _ with A not in 2 or 3, and avoiding S, L, E, C, H, N.

Try “RAZOR” — ends in R.

“PATIO” — ends in O.

“VIRGA” — ends in A, but T must be in 4.

Wait, word must be _ _ _ T _.

Let’s try “DRAFT” — A in 3, invalid.

“GRAFT” — A in 3, invalid.

“MAJOR” — no A.

“PATIO” — ends in O.

“VIRGA” — ends in A, but T must be in 4.

Wait, let me list possible letters left:
Positions: 1,2,3,4,5
4 is T (fixed)
A must be in 1 or 5
Avoid: S, L, E, C, H, N
Letters left: R, D, M, P, G, B, F, K, V, W, Y, I, O, U, etc.

Try A in 1: A _ _ T _
Need 2,3 letters from remaining, avoiding the banned letters.

Possible combinations:
A R I T ? — but must be 5 letters.

A R I T Y — ARITY? Not a word.

A R O T ? — AROTY? No.

A M I T ? — AMITY? Ends in Y.

AMBIT — T at 5, invalid.

A R I T A — ARITA? No.

A R I T U — ARITU? No.

A V I T A — AVITA? No.

A R I T O — ARITO? No.

A R I T D — ARITD? No.

A R I T K — ARITK? No.

A R I T V — ARITV? No.

A R I T G — ARITG? No.

A R I T B — ARITB? No.

A R I T F — ARITF? No.

A R I T W — ARITW? No.

A R I T Y — AMITY ends in Y, but we need A at 1, T at 4, so AMITY is A M I T Y — T is at 4, Y at 5. This fits:
A M I T Y — but does it have A in 1, T in 4, and avoid banned letters?

AMITY:
- A, M, I, T, Y
- A at 1 (valid)
- T at 4 (✓)
- Letters used: A, M, I, T, Y — none are banned (S, L, E, C, H, N are banned, and these are all new or allowed)
- A is not in 2 or 3 (it's in 1), so this fits.

Let me check if AMITY is a valid word: yes, it is.

So AMITY is a valid guess.

Common letters left: R, D, M, P, G, B, F, K, V, W, Y, etc. plus vowels I, O, U.

We need a word ending in T, containing A, with A not in position 2 or 3, and avoiding S, L, E, C, H, N.

Let’s try “GRAFT”:
- G, R, A, F, T
- A is in position 3 → but SLATE said A is not in position 3. So GRAFT is invalid.

Next: “WRATH” — W, R, A, T, H. H is already out.

“BRAID” — doesn’t end in T.

“FRATE” — ends in E, which is out.

“PLATE” — ends in E, out.

“GRATE” — ends in E, out.

“DRAFT” — A is in position 3 → invalid.

“GAULT” — ends in T, A in position 2 → invalid (A can’t be in 2).

“GOURD” — ends in D, no A.

“VIRGA” — ends in A, but we need A somewhere not in 2 or 3, and word must end in T.

Wait, we need A not in positions 2 or 3, and T in position 4, and word ends in T? No, word ends in T is confirmed by SLATE (T at position 4 is ✓). So word is _ _ _ T _.

So A must be in position 1 or 5.

Let’s try A in position 1: A _ _ T _

Possible letters left: R, D, M, P, G, B, F, K, V, W, Y, I, O, U.

Try “ARGOT” — A, R, G, O, T. A is in position 1, T in 5. But SLATE said T is in position 4. So ARGOT is invalid (T at 5).

“ABORT” — A, B, O, R, T. T at 5 — invalid.

“AVERT” — A, V, E, R, T. E is out.

“AWARD” — ends in D.

“AZURE” — ends in E.

“AXIOM” — ends in M.

“AMBIT” — ends in T, A in position 1.

AMBIT:
- A, M, B, I, T
- A in position 1 (valid, not 2 or 3)
- T in position 5 — but SLATE said T is in position 4. So AMBIT is invalid (T at 5).

“ADMIT” — ends in T, A in position 1.

ADMIT:
- A, D, M, I, T
- A at 1 (valid)
- T at 5 — but SLATE said T is at 4. So ADMIT is invalid.

“ABHOR” — ends in R.

“ABIDE” — ends in E.

“AXIALLY” — too long.

“AXIOM” — ends in M.

“AZURE” — ends in E.

“AZOTH” — ends in H.

Let’s try A in position 5: _ _ _ T A.

We need a word ending in TA, with T in position 4.

Valid 5-letter words ending in TA with T in 4th:
- BUILT? No, ends in T.
- CHART? No.

- PLANT? No.
- SHALT? No.
- SKINT? No.

- HEART? No.
- LEANT? No.
- PLANT? No.

- WRATH? Ends in H.

Hmm, seems rare. Let me think differently.

We need _ _ _ T _ with A not in 2 or 3, and avoiding S, L, E, C, H, N.

Try “RAZOR” — ends in R.

“PATIO” — ends in O.

“VIRGA” — ends in A, but T must be in 4.

Wait, word must be _ _ _ T _.

Let’s try “DRAFT” — A in 3, invalid.

“GRAFT” — A in 3, invalid.

“MAJOR” — no A.

“PATIO” — ends in O.

“VIRGA” — ends in A, but T must be in 4.

Wait, let me list possible letters left:
Positions: 1,2,3,4,5
4 is T (fixed)
A must be in 1 or 5
Avoid: S, L, E, C, H, N
Letters left: R, D, M, P, G, B, F, K, V, W, Y, I, O, U, etc.

Try A in 1: A _ _ T _
Need 2,3 letters from remaining, avoiding the banned letters.

Possible combinations:
A R I T ? — but must be 5 letters.

A R I T Y — ARITY? Not a word.

A R O T ? — AROTY? No.

A M I T ? — AMITY? Ends in Y.

AMBIT — T at 5, invalid.

A R I T A — ARITA? No.

A R I T B — ARITB? No.

A R I T F — ARITF? No.

A R I T W — ARITW? No.

A R I T Y — AMITY ends in Y, but we need A at 1, T at 4, so AMITY is A M I T Y — T is at 4, Y at 5. This fits:
A M I T Y — but does it have A in 1, T in 4, and avoid banned letters?

AMITY:
- A, M, I, T, Y
- A at 1 (valid)
- T at 4 (✓)
- Letters used: A, M, I, T, Y — none are banned (S, L, E, C, H, N are banned, and these are all new or allowed)
- A is not in 2 or 3 (it's in 1), so this fits.

Let me check if AMITY is a valid word: yes, it is.

So AMITY is a valid guess.",Guess 3: AMITY -> FEEDBACK: A(-) M(x) I(x) T(✓) Y(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use some of these letters. 

Looking at these letters, ""SLATE"" is an excellent choice because it contains S, L, A, T, and E - all very common letters, and covers vowels (A, E) and several consonants (S, L, T). This should give us good information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- T is in the correct position (✓) — so the word is _ _ _ T _
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word ends with T
- It contains A somewhere NOT in position 3
- It does NOT contain S, L, or E

We need a 5-letter word ending in T that includes A somewhere else. Common consonants we haven’t tried yet: R, N, D, C, M, P, etc. Let’s pick a word that uses fresh common letters while respecting the constraints.

A good candidate is ""CRANK"":
- Ends with T (✓)
- Contains A (in position 3, but we know A isn’t in position 3, so this might be risky)
Wait, no — A is in position 3 in CRANK, and we know A isn’t in position 3 (from SLATE feedback), so CRANK is invalid.

Let’s try ""RANCH"" — but it doesn’t end with T.

Next candidate: ""CHANT"" — ends with T, has A in position 2. This seems safe:
- C, H, A, N, T
- A is in position 2 (not 3), so this fits the constraints
- Uses new letters C, H, N

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: CHANT -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) A(-) N(x) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on CHANT:
- C(x), H(x), N(x) — none of these letters are in the word.
- A(-) — A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (as before) and NOT in position 2 (now).
- T(-) — T is in the word but NOT in position 5 (we only know it’s in position 5 from SLATE, so this contradicts unless… wait, no: SLATE said T is in the correct position (✓) at position 4, so the word is _ _ _ T _. The feedback on CHANT says T is in the wrong position (-) at position 5, which is consistent because T is indeed in position 4, not 5. So word pattern: _ _ _ T _.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, E, C, H, N
- Letters in the word: A (not in positions 2 or 3), T (fixed at position 4)
- Remaining positions 1, 2, 5 to fill with letters not yet ruled out.

Common letters left: R, D, M, P, G, B, F, K, V, W, Y, etc. plus vowels I, O, U.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use some of these letters. 

Looking at these letters, ""SLATE"" is an excellent choice because it contains S, L, A, T, and E - all very common letters, and covers vowels (A, E) and several consonants (S, L, T). This should give us good information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- T is in the correct position (✓) — so the word is _ _ _ T _
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word ends with T
- It contains A somewhere NOT in position 3
- It does NOT contain S, L, or E

We need a 5-letter word ending in T that includes A somewhere else. Common consonants we haven’t tried yet: R, N, D, C, M, P, etc. Let’s pick a word that uses fresh common letters while respecting the constraints.

A good candidate is ""CRANK"":
- Ends with T (✓)
- Contains A (in position 3, but we know A isn’t in position 3, so this might be risky)
Wait, no — A is in position 3 in CRANK, and we know A isn’t in position 3 (from SLATE feedback), so CRANK is invalid.

Let’s try ""RANCH"" — but it doesn’t end with T.

Next candidate: ""CHANT"" — ends with T, has A in position 2. This seems safe:
- C, H, A, N, T
- A is in position 2 (not 3), so this fits the constraints
- Uses new letters C, H, N

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: CHANT -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) A(-) N(x) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on CHANT:
- C(x), H(x), N(x) — none of these letters are in the word.
- A(-) — A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (as before) and NOT in position 2 (now).
- T(-) — T is in the word but NOT in position 5 (we only know it’s in position 5 from SLATE, so this contradicts unless… wait, no: SLATE said T is in the correct position (✓) at position 4, so the word is _ _ _ T _. The feedback on CHANT says T is in the wrong position (-) at position 5, which is consistent because T is indeed in position 4, not 5. So word pattern: _ _ _ T _.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, E, C, H, N
- Letters in the word: A (not in positions 2 or 3), T (fixed at position 4)
- Remaining positions 1, 2, 5 to fill with letters not yet ruled out.

Common letters left: R, D, M, P, G, B, F, K, V, W, Y, etc. plus vowels I, O, U.

We need a word ending in T, containing A, with A not in position 2 or 3, and avoiding S, L, E, C, H, N.

Let’s try “GRAFT”:
- G, R, A, F, T
- A is in position 3 → but SLATE said A is not in position 3. So GRAFT is invalid.

Next: “WRATH” — W, R, A, T, H. H is already out.

“BRAID” — doesn’t end in T.

“FRATE” — ends in E, which is out.

“PLATE” — ends in E, out.

“GRATE” — ends in E, out.

“DRAFT” — A is in position 3 → invalid.

“GAULT” — ends in T, A in position 2 → invalid (A can’t be in 2).

“TAPIR” — ends in R.

“GADID” — ends in D.

“PAGOD” — ends in D.

“VIRGA” — ends in A, but we need A somewhere not in 2 or 3, and word must end in T.

Wait, we need A not in positions 2 or 3, and T in position 4, and word ends in T? No, word ends in T is confirmed by SLATE (T at position 4 is ✓). So word is _ _ _ T _.

So A must be in position 1 or 5.

Let’s try A in position 1: A _ _ T _

Possible letters left: R, D, M, P, G, B, F, K, V, W, Y, I, O, U.

Try “ARGOT” — A, R, G, O, T. A is in position 1, T in 5. But SLATE said T is in position 4. So ARGOT is invalid (T at 5).

“ABORT” — A, B, O, R, T. T at 5 — invalid.

“AVERT” — A, V, E, R, T. E is out.

“AWARD” — ends in D.

“AZURE” — ends in E.

AMBIT:
- A, M, B, I, T
- A in position 1 (valid, not 2 or 3)
- T in position 5 — but SLATE said T is in position 4. So AMBIT is invalid (T at 5).

“AFRIT” — not a valid word.

“AWFUL” — ends in L, out.

“AXIAL” — ends in L, out.

“APORT” — not a word.

“ADMIT” — ends in T, A in position 1.

ADMIT:
- A, D, M, I, T
- A at 1 (valid)
- T at 5 — but SLATE said T is at 4. So ADMIT is invalid.

“ABHOR” — ends in R.

“ABIDE” — ends in E.

“ABORT” — ends in T, but T at 5.

“ABUZZ” — ends in Z.

“ADMON” — ends in N.

“ANVIL” — ends in L.

“ARBIT” — ends in T, A at 1.

ARBIT:
- A, R, B, I, T
- A at 1 (valid)
- T at 5 — but SLATE said T is at 4. So ARBIT is invalid.

“ARBOR” — ends in R.

“ARGON” — ends in N.

“ARGOT” — ends in T, but T at 5.

“ARMOR” — ends in R.

“ARTIC” — ends in C.

“ARSON” — ends in N.

“ASIDE” — ends in E.

“ASMAN” — ends in N.

“ASTON” — ends in N.

“ATTIC” — ends in C.

“ATTIR” — not a word.

“AWARD” — ends in D.

“AWFUL” — ends in L.

“AXIALLY” — too long.

“AXIOM” — ends in M.

“AZURE” — ends in E.

“AZOTH” — ends in H.

Let’s try A in position 5: _ _ _ T A.

We need a word ending in TA, with T in position 4.

Valid 5-letter words ending in TA with T in 4th:
- BUILT? No, ends in T.
- CHART? No.
- FROST? No.
- GRANT? No.
- HEART? No.
- LEANT? No.
- PLANT? No.
- SHALT? No.
- SKINT? No.
- STINT? No.
- SWUNG? No.
- VITAL? Ends in L.

- CHART? No.
- FROST? No.
- GRANT? No.
- HEART? No.
- LEANT? No.
- PLANT? No.
- SHALT? No.
- SKINT? No.
- STINT? No.
- SWUNG? No.
- VITAL? Ends in L.
- WRATH? Ends in H.

Hmm, seems rare. Let me think differently.

We need _ _ _ T _ with A not in 2 or 3, and avoiding S, L, E, C, H, N.

Try “RAZOR” — ends in R.

“PATIO” — ends in O.

“VIRGA” — ends in A, but T must be in 4.

Wait, word must be _ _ _ T _.

Let’s try “DRAFT” — A in 3, invalid.

“GRAFT” — A in 3, invalid.

“MAJOR” — no A.

“PATIO” — ends in O.

“VIRGA” — ends in A, but T must be in 4.

Wait, let me list possible letters left:
Positions: 1,2,3,4,5
4 is T (fixed)
A must be in 1 or 5
Avoid: S, L, E, C, H, N
Letters left: R, D, M, P, G, B, F, K, V, W, Y, I, O, U, etc.

Try A in 1: A _ _ T _
Need 2,3 letters from remaining, avoiding the banned letters.

Possible combinations:
A R I T ? — but must be 5 letters.

A R I T Y — ARITY? Not a word.

A R O T ? — AROTY? No.

A M I T ? — AMITY? Ends in Y.

AMBIT — T at 5, invalid.

A R I T A — ARITA? No.

A R I T U — ARITU? No.

A R I T G — ARITG? No.

A R I T B — ARITB? No.

A R I T F — ARITF? No.

A R I T W — ARITW? No.

A R I T Y — AMITY ends in Y, but we need A at 1, T at 4, so AMITY is A M I T Y — T is at 4, Y at 5. This fits:
A M I T Y — but does it have A in 1, T in 4, and avoid banned letters?

AMITY:
- A, M, I, T, Y
- A at 1 (valid)
- T at 4 (✓)
- Letters used: A, M, I, T, Y — none are banned (S, L, E, C, H, N are banned, and these are all new or allowed)
- A is not in 2 or 3 (it's in 1), so this fits.

Let me check if AMITY is a valid word: yes, it is.

- A(-) — A is in the word but NOT in position 1 (and we already knew it’s not in 2, 3, or 5 from earlier guesses).
- M(x), I(x) — neither M nor I are in the word.
- T(✓) — T is in position 4 (✓) — so word is _ _ _ T _
- Y(✓) — Y is in position 5 (✓) — so word is _ _ _ T Y

So we now know the exact pattern: _ _ _ T Y

Letters we now know are NOT in the word (from all feedback):
S, L, E, C, H, N, M, I

Letters still allowed (among common ones):
R, D, G, B, F, K, V, W, U, O, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in “_ _ _ T Y” with:
- A somewhere in positions 2 or 3 (since A is in the word but never yet in 1, 2, 3, or 5 — wait, that leaves only position 4, but 4 is T. This seems impossible…)

Hold on — let’s re-examine the A placement:
- SLATE: A(-) in position 3 → A not in 3
- CHANT: A(-) in position 3 → same
- AMITY: A(-) in position 1 → A not in 1
We also know from AMITY that A is in the word, so A must be in position 2 or 4 or 5. But:
- 4 is T
- 5 is Y
Thus, A must be in position 2.

So the pattern is now: _ A _ T Y

Letters still allowed: R, D, G, B, F, K, V, W, U, O, etc. (excluding banned ones)

We need a 5-letter word matching “_ A _ T Y” with no banned letters.

Common words fitting this:
- B A R T Y — BARTY? Not standard.
- D A R T Y — DARTY? Not standard.
- F A R T Y — FARLY? No.
- G A R T Y — GARTY? Not standard.
- P A R T Y — PARTY? Yes, PARTY is a valid word.

Check PARTY:
- P, A, R, T, Y
- A in position 2 (✓)
- T in 4 (✓)
- Y in 5 (✓)
- Letters used: P, A, R, T, Y — none are banned (S, L, E, C, H, N, M, I are banned, and PARTY avoids them all).

Thus, PARTY is a valid and logical next guess.

So the exact pattern is now: _ A _ T Y

Letters we know are NOT in the word (after all guesses):
S, L, E, C, H, N, M, I, P, R

Letters still allowed (common ones):
B, D, F, G, K, V, W, U, O, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that fits: _ A _ T Y, uses only allowed letters, and contains A in position 2, T in 4, Y in 5.

Possible middle letters (position 3) from allowed letters: B, D, F, G, K, V, W, U, O.

Possible first letters (position 1) from allowed letters: B, D, F, G, K, V, W, U, O.

Let’s list valid words fitting _ A _ T Y:
- B A D T Y – BADTY? Not a word.
- B A F T Y – BAFty? No.

- F A U T Y – FAuty? No.
- G A U T Y – GAuty? No.
- V A U T Y – VAudy? No.
- W A U T Y – WAudy? No.

Wait, let’s double-check common dictionary entries for “_ a _ t y”:
- B A S T Y – BASTY? Not standard.
- B A L T Y – BALTY? No (L banned).
- D A L T Y – DALTY? No (L banned).
- F A L T Y – FALTY? No (L banned).
- G A L T Y – GALTY? No (L banned).
- V A L T Y – VALLY? No (L banned), and ends in Y but L is banned.
- W A L T Y – WALTZ? No, ends in Z.

Actually, a valid word is:
- B A S T Y – BASTY? Not in standard Scrabble.
- D A S T Y – DASTY? Not standard.
- F A S T Y – FASTY? No.
- G A S T Y – GASTY? No.
- V A S T Y – VASTY? No.
- W A S T Y – WASTY? Yes, WASTY is a valid word (though rare).

WASTY:
- W, A, S, T, Y
- A in 2, T in 4, Y in 5.
- S is banned (from SLATE: S(x)), so WASTY is invalid.

Next candidate:
- B A N T Y – BANTY? No (N banned).
- D A N T Y – DANTY? No (N banned).
- G A N T Y – GANTY? No (N banned).

Another valid word:
- B A V T Y – BAVTY? No.
- D A V T Y – DAVTY? No.
- G A V T Y – GAVTY? No.
- V A G T Y – VAGTY? No.

Wait, let’s check:
- B A L T Y – BALTY? No (L banned).
- B A D T Y – BADTY? No.
- D A B T Y – DABTY? No.

Actually, the only remaining plausible word is:
- B A U T Y – Bauty? No (needs ‘e’).
- D A U T Y – DAuty? No.
- G A U T Y – GAuty? No.
- V A U T Y – VAudy? No.
- W A U T Y – WAudy? No.

Hmm, seems no common word. Let me re-examine allowed letters.

Allowed letters for positions 1 and 3: B, D, F, G, K, V, W, U, O.

Valid word:
- B A O T Y – BAOty? No.
- D A O T Y – DAOty? No.
- F A O T Y – FAOty? No.
- V A O T Y – VAOty? No.

Wait, let’s check:

- D A F T Y – DAFty? No.
- G A F T Y – GAFty? No.
- V A F T Y – VAFty? No.
- W A F T Y – WAFty? No.

Another approach: check dictionary for “a _ t y” but we need “_ a _ t y”.

Valid word found:
- B A G T Y – BAGTY? No.
- D A G T Y – DAGTY? No.
- V A G T Y – VAGTY? No.

Actually, the word “BAITY” exists but I is banned.

Next candidate:
- B A K T Y – BAKTY? No.
- D A K T Y – DAKTY? No.
- V A K T Y – VAKTY? No.

Seems the only remaining valid word is:
- B A V T Y – BAVTY? No.
- D A V T Y – DAVTY? No.
- G A V T Y – GAVTY? No.
- V A G T Y – VAGTY? No.

I realize I may have missed “BAWTY” but W is allowed:
- B A W T Y – BAWTY? Yes, BAWTY is a valid word (archaic form of “bawd” or “bawdy”, but acceptable in Scrabble).

BAWTY:
- B, A, W, T, Y
- A in 2, T in 4, Y in 5.
- Letters used: B, A, W, T, Y — none are banned (S, L, E, C, H, N, M, I, P, R are banned, and BAWTY avoids them).

Thus, BAWTY is the logical next guess.

</think>

The pattern is now _ A _ T Y with A in position 2, T in 4, and Y in 5. The only remaining valid word using allowed letters is:

<guess>BAWTY</guess>",BAWTY,"From the latest feedback on PARTY:
- P(x) – P is NOT in the word.

- D A S T Y – DASTY? Not standard.
- F A S T Y – FASTY? No.
- G A S T Y – GASTY? No.
- V A S T Y – VASTY? No.
- W A S T Y – WASTY? Yes, WASTY is a valid word (though rare).

WASTY:
- W, A, S, T, Y
- A in 2, T in 4, Y in 5.
- S is banned (from SLATE: S(x)), so WASTY is invalid.

Next candidate:
- B A N T Y – BANTY? No (N banned).
- D A N T Y – DANTY? No (N banned).
- G A N T Y – GANTY? No (N banned).

Another valid word:
- B A V T Y – BAVTY? No.
- D A V T Y – DAVTY? No.
- G A V T Y – GAVTY? No.
- V A G T Y – VAGTY? No.

Wait, let’s check:
- B A L T Y – BALTY? No (L banned).
- B A D T Y – BADTY? No.
- D A B T Y – DABTY? No.

Actually, the only remaining plausible word is:
- B A U T Y – Bauty? No (needs ‘e’).
- D A U T Y – DAuty? No.
- G A U T Y – GAuty? No.
- V A U T Y – VAudy? No.
- W A U T Y – WAudy? No.

Hmm, seems no common word. Let me re-examine allowed letters.

Allowed letters for positions 1 and 3: B, D, F, G, K, V, W, U, O.

Valid word:
- B A O T Y – BAOty? No.
- D A O T Y – DAOty? No.
- F A O T Y – FAOty? No.
- V A O T Y – VAOty? No.

Wait, let’s check:
- B A F T Y – BAFty? No.
- D A F T Y – DAFty? No.
- G A F T Y – GAFty? No.
- V A F T Y – VAFty? No.
- W A F T Y – WAFty? No.

Another approach: check dictionary for “a _ t y” but we need “_ a _ t y”.

Valid word found:
- B A G T Y – BAGTY? No.
- D A G T Y – DAGTY? No.
- V A G T Y – VAGTY? No.

Actually, the word “BAITY” exists but I is banned.

Next candidate:
- B A K T Y – BAKTY? No.
- D A K T Y – DAKTY? No.
- V A K T Y – VAKTY? No.

Seems the only remaining valid word is:
- B A V T Y – BAVTY? No.
- D A V T Y – DAVTY? No.
- G A V T Y – GAVTY? No.
- V A G T Y – VAGTY? No.

I realize I may have missed “BAWTY” but W is allowed:
- B A W T Y – BAWTY? Yes, BAWTY is a valid word (archaic form of “bawd” or “bawdy”, but acceptable in Scrabble).

BAWTY:
- B, A, W, T, Y
- A in 2, T in 4, Y in 5.
- Letters used: B, A, W, T, Y — none are banned (S, L, E, C, H, N, M, I, P, R are banned, and BAWTY avoids them).

Thus, BAWTY is the logical next guess.The pattern is now _ A _ T Y with A in position 2, T in 4, and Y in 5. The only remaining valid word using allowed letters is:",Guess 5: BAWTY -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) W(x) T(✓) Y(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use some of these letters. 

Looking at these letters, ""SLATE"" is an excellent choice because it contains S, L, A, T, and E - all very common letters, and covers vowels (A, E) and several consonants (S, L, T). This should give us good information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- T is in the correct position (✓) — so the word is _ _ _ T _
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word ends with T
- It contains A somewhere NOT in position 3
- It does NOT contain S, L, or E

We need a 5-letter word ending in T that includes A somewhere else. Common consonants we haven’t tried yet: R, N, D, C, M, P, etc. Let’s pick a word that uses fresh common letters while respecting the constraints.

A good candidate is ""CRANK"":
- Ends with T (✓)
- Contains A (in position 3, but we know A isn’t in position 3, so this might be risky)
Wait, no — A is in position 3 in CRANK, and we know A isn’t in position 3 (from SLATE feedback), so CRANK is invalid.

Let’s try ""RANCH"" — but it doesn’t end with T.

Next candidate: ""CHANT"" — ends with T, has A in position 2. This seems safe:
- C, H, A, N, T
- A is in position 2 (not 3), so this fits the constraints
- Uses new letters C, H, N

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: CHANT -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) A(-) N(x) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on CHANT:
- C(x), H(x), N(x) — none of these letters are in the word.
- A(-) — A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (as before) and NOT in position 2 (now).
- T(-) — T is in the word but NOT in position 5 (we only know it’s in position 5 from SLATE, so this contradicts unless… wait, no: SLATE said T is in the correct position (✓) at position 4, so the word is _ _ _ T _. The feedback on CHANT says T is in the wrong position (-) at position 5, which is consistent because T is indeed in position 4, not 5. So word pattern: _ _ _ T _.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, E, C, H, N
- Letters in the word: A (not in positions 2 or 3), T (fixed at position 4)
- Remaining positions 1, 2, 5 to fill with letters not yet ruled out.

Common letters left: R, D, M, P, G, B, F, K, V, W, Y, etc. plus vowels I, O, U.

We need a word ending in T, containing A, with A not in position 2 or 3, and avoiding S, L, E, C, H, N.

Let’s try “GRAFT”:
- G, R, A, F, T
- A is in position 3 → but SLATE said A is not in position 3. So GRAFT is invalid.

Next: “WRATH” — W, R, A, T, H. H is already out.

“BRAID” — doesn’t end in T.

“FRATE” — ends in E, which is out.

“PLATE” — ends in E, out.

“GRATE” — ends in E, out.

“DRAFT” — A is in position 3 → invalid.

“GAULT” — ends in T, A in position 2 → invalid (A can’t be in 2).

“GOURD” — ends in D, no A.

“MAJOR” — no A.

“VITAL” — ends in L, out, and L is out.

“WRATH” — H is out.

“PATIO” — ends in O.

“VAPID” — ends in D.

“TRAMP” — ends in P.

“VIRAL” — ends in L, out.

“RADIX” — ends in X.

“TAPIR” — ends in R.

“GADID” — ends in D.

“PAGOD” — ends in D.

“VIRGA” — ends in A, but we need A somewhere not in 2 or 3, and word must end in T.

Wait, we need A not in positions 2 or 3, and T in position 4, and word ends in T? No, word ends in T is confirmed by SLATE (T at position 4 is ✓). So word is _ _ _ T _.

So A must be in position 1 or 5.

Let’s try A in position 1: A _ _ T _

Possible letters left: R, D, M, P, G, B, F, K, V, W, Y, I, O, U.

Try “ARGOT” — A, R, G, O, T. A is in position 1, T in 5. But SLATE said T is in position 4. So ARGOT is invalid (T at 5).

“ABORT” — A, B, O, R, T. T at 5 — invalid.

“AVERT” — A, V, E, R, T. E is out.

“AWARD” — ends in D.

“AZURE” — ends in E.

“AXIOM” — ends in M.

“AGAVE” — ends in E.

“AMBIT” — ends in T, A in position 1.

AMBIT:
- A, M, B, I, T
- A in position 1 (valid, not 2 or 3)
- T in position 5 — but SLATE said T is in position 4. So AMBIT is invalid (T at 5).

“AFRIT” — not a valid word.

“AVANT” — ends in N, out.

“AWFUL” — ends in L, out.

“AXIAL” — ends in L, out.

“APORT” — not a word.

“AVION” — ends in N.

“AGLET” — ends in T, A in position 1.

AGLET:
- A, G, L, E, T. L and E are out.

“ADMIT” — ends in T, A in position 1.

ADMIT:
- A, D, M, I, T
- A at 1 (valid)
- T at 5 — but SLATE said T is at 4. So ADMIT is invalid.

“ABHOR” — ends in R.

“ABIDE” — ends in E.

“ABORT” — ends in T, but T at 5.

“ABUZZ” — ends in Z.

“ADMON” — ends in N.

“ADMIT” — T at 5.

“AFRAID” — ends in D.

“AGAVE” — ends in E.

“AGGRA” — ends in A.

“AGILE” — ends in E.

“ALIBI” — ends in I.

“ALLOY” — ends in Y.

“AMBIT” — T at 5.

“AMPLY” — ends in Y.

“ANGRY” — ends in Y.

“ANTIC” — ends in C, out.

“ANVIL” — ends in L.

“ARBIT” — ends in T, A at 1.

ARBIT:
- A, R, B, I, T
- A at 1 (valid)
- T at 5 — but SLATE said T is at 4. So ARBIT is invalid.

“ARBOR” — ends in R.

“ARGON” — ends in N.

“ARGOT” — ends in T, but T at 5.

“ARMOR” — ends in R.

“ARTIC” — ends in C.

“ARSON” — ends in N.

“ASIDE” — ends in E.

“ASMAN” — ends in N.

“ASTON” — ends in N.

“ATTIC” — ends in C.

“ATTIR” — not a word.

“ATTUN” — ends in N.

“AVANT” — ends in N.

“AVISO” — ends in O.

“AVOID” — ends in D.

“AWARD” — ends in D.

“AWFUL” — ends in L.

“AXIALLY” — too long.

“AXIOM” — ends in M.

“AZURE” — ends in E.

“AZOTH” — ends in H.

Let’s try A in position 5: _ _ _ T A.

We need a word ending in TA, with T in position 4.

Valid 5-letter words ending in TA with T in 4th:
- BUILT? No, ends in T.
- CHART? No.
- FROST? No.
- GRANT? No.
- HEART? No.
- LEANT? No.
- PLANT? No.
- SHALT? No.
- SKINT? No.
- STINT? No.
- SWUNG? No.
- VITAL? Ends in L.
- WRATH? Ends in H.

Actually, common words ending in TA with T in 4th:
- BUILT? No, ends in T.
- CHART? No.
- FROST? No.
- GRANT? No.
- HEART? No.
- LEANT? No.
- PLANT? No.
- SHALT? No.
- SKINT? No.
- STINT? No.
- SWUNG? No.
- VITAL? Ends in L.
- WRATH? Ends in H.

Hmm, seems rare. Let me think differently.

We need _ _ _ T _ with A not in 2 or 3, and avoiding S, L, E, C, H, N.

Try “RAZOR” — ends in R.

“PATIO” — ends in O.

“VIRGA” — ends in A, but T must be in 4.

Wait, word must be _ _ _ T _.

Let’s try “DRAFT” — A in 3, invalid.

“GRAFT” — A in 3, invalid.

“MAJOR” — no A.

“PATIO” — ends in O.

“VIRGA” — ends in A, but T must be in 4.

Wait, let me list possible letters left:
Positions: 1,2,3,4,5
4 is T (fixed)
A must be in 1 or 5
Avoid: S, L, E, C, H, N
Letters left: R, D, M, P, G, B, F, K, V, W, Y, I, O, U, etc.

Try A in 1: A _ _ T _
Need 2,3 letters from remaining, avoiding the banned letters.

Possible combinations:
A R I T ? — but must be 5 letters.

A R I T Y — ARITY? Not a word.

A R O T ? — AROTY? No.

A M I T ? — AMITY? Ends in Y.

AMBIT — T at 5, invalid.

A R I T A — ARITA? No.

A R I T U — ARITU? No.

A V I T A — AVITA? No.

A R I T O — ARITO? No.

A R I T D — ARITD? No.

A R I T K — ARITK? No.

A R I T V — ARITV? No.

A R I T G — ARITG? No.

A R I T B — ARITB? No.

A R I T F — ARITF? No.

A R I T W — ARITW? No.

A R I T Y — AMITY ends in Y, but we need A at 1, T at 4, so AMITY is A M I T Y — T is at 4, Y at 5. This fits:
A M I T Y — but does it have A in 1, T in 4, and avoid banned letters?

AMITY:
- A, M, I, T, Y
- A at 1 (valid)
- T at 4 (✓)
- Letters used: A, M, I, T, Y — none are banned (S, L, E, C, H, N are banned, and these are all new or allowed)
- A is not in 2 or 3 (it's in 1), so this fits.

Let me check if AMITY is a valid word: yes, it is.

So AMITY is a valid guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: CHANT -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) A(-) N(x) T(-)
Guess 3: AMITY -> FEEDBACK: A(-) M(x) I(x) T(✓) Y(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on AMITY:
- A(-) — A is in the word but NOT in position 1 (and we already knew it’s not in 2, 3, or 5 from earlier guesses).
- M(x), I(x) — neither M nor I are in the word.
- T(✓) — T is in position 4 (✓) — so word is _ _ _ T _
- Y(✓) — Y is in position 5 (✓) — so word is _ _ _ T Y

So we now know the exact pattern: _ _ _ T Y

Letters we now know are NOT in the word (from all feedback):
S, L, E, C, H, N, M, I

Letters still allowed (among common ones):
R, D, G, B, F, K, V, W, U, O, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in “_ _ _ T Y” with:
- A somewhere in positions 2 or 3 (since A is in the word but never yet in 1, 2, 3, or 5 — wait, that leaves only position 4, but 4 is T. This seems impossible…)

Hold on — let’s re-examine the A placement:
- SLATE: A(-) in position 3 → A not in 3
- CHANT: A(-) in position 3 → same
- AMITY: A(-) in position 1 → A not in 1
We also know from AMITY that A is in the word, so A must be in position 2 or 4 or 5. But:
- 4 is T
- 5 is Y
Thus, A must be in position 2.

So the pattern is now: _ A _ T Y

Letters still allowed: R, D, G, B, F, K, V, W, U, O, etc. (excluding banned ones)

We need a 5-letter word matching “_ A _ T Y” with no banned letters.

Common words fitting this:
- B A R T Y — BARTY? Not standard.
- D A R T Y — DARTY? Not standard.
- F A R T Y — FARLY? No.
- G A R T Y — GARTY? Not standard.
- P A R T Y — PARTY? Yes, PARTY is a valid word.

Check PARTY:
- P, A, R, T, Y
- A in position 2 (✓)
- T in 4 (✓)
- Y in 5 (✓)
- Letters used: P, A, R, T, Y — none are banned (S, L, E, C, H, N, M, I are banned, and PARTY avoids them all).

Thus, PARTY is a valid and logical next guess.

- R(x) – R is NOT in the word.
- T(✓) – T is in position 4 (✓).
- Y(✓) – Y is in position 5 (✓).

So the exact pattern is now: _ A _ T Y

Letters we know are NOT in the word (after all guesses):
S, L, E, C, H, N, M, I, P, R

Letters still allowed (common ones):
B, D, F, G, K, V, W, U, O, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that fits: _ A _ T Y, uses only allowed letters, and contains A in position 2, T in 4, Y in 5.

Possible middle letters (position 3) from allowed letters: B, D, F, G, K, V, W, U, O.

Possible first letters (position 1) from allowed letters: B, D, F, G, K, V, W, U, O.

Let’s list valid words fitting _ A _ T Y:
- B A D T Y – BADTY? Not a word.
- B A F T Y – BAFty? No.
- B A G T Y – BAGTY? No.
- B A V T Y – BAVTY? No.

- B A L T Y – BALTY? No (L banned).
- D A L T Y – DALTY? No (L banned).
- F A L T Y – FALTY? No (L banned).
- G A L T Y – GALTY? No (L banned).
- V A L T Y – VALLY? No (L banned), and ends in Y but L is banned.
- W A L T Y – WALTZ? No, ends in Z.

Actually, a valid word is:

- D A S T Y – DASTY? Not standard.
- F A S T Y – FASTY? No.
- G A S T Y – GASTY? No.
- V A S T Y – VASTY? No.
- W A S T Y – WASTY? Yes, WASTY is a valid word (though rare).

WASTY:
- W, A, S, T, Y
- A in 2, T in 4, Y in 5.
- S is banned (from SLATE: S(x)), so WASTY is invalid.

Next candidate:
- B A N T Y – BANTY? No (N banned).

<guess>DAFTY</guess>",Guess 6: DAFTY -> FEEDBACK: D(x) A(✓) F(x) T(✓) Y(✓),FAIL
