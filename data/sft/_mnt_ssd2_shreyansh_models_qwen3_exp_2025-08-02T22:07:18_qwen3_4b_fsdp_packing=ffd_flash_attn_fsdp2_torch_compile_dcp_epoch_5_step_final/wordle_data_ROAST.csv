### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently appearing letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities efficiently.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons, but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a slightly better letter distribution.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- S is in the correct position (5th letter).
- A, R, O are in the word but in the wrong positions.

So far we know:
- Word ends with S.
- Contains A, R, O somewhere among positions 1-4.
- Does NOT contain E.

We need a 5-letter word ending in S that uses A, R, O in some order in the first four positions, and does not contain E.

Possible candidates:
- ROAST (but has T, which isn't confirmed yet)
- COARS (but has C, unconfirmed)
- GLOAT (but has L and T)
- RADIO (but ends with O, not S)

A good next guess should test new common letters while fitting the constraints. ""RAO"" plus new consonants:

- ""RAO"" + ""T"" = RAOTS (invalid)
- ""RAO"" + ""N"" = RAON? (invalid)
- ""RAO"" + ""D"" = RAOD? (invalid)

Instead, let's try ""ROAST"" - it has R, O, A in positions 2,3,4 and S in 5, plus T. This tests T as a new consonant.

""ROAST"" seems like the best next guess.
