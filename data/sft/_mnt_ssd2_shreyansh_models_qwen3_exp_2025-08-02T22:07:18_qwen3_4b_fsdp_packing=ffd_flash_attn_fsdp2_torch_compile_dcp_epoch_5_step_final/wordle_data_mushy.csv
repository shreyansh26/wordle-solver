### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Better choices: use S plus consonants and the remaining vowels (I, U, Y). ""STUNS"" has S in position 1 and 4, but position 4 is forbidden for S. ""SPUNK"" uses S in position 1, P, U, N, K—avoiding forbidden letters. That seems good.

Summary of constraints:
- Letters that must appear: S (not in position 1 or 4), U (not in position 3).  
- Letters that must NOT appear: A, R, O, E, L, N, G.

Remaining common consonants and vowels: B, C, D, F, H, I, K, M, P, T, V, W, Y.  
We need a 5-letter word that:
- contains S and U,  
- places S not in positions 1 or 4,  
- places U not in position 3,  
- avoids all forbidden letters.

A quick scan of common words gives “SUCKY”:
- S is in position 1 → forbidden (from feedback).  
“STUBS”:
- S in positions 1 and 4 → both forbidden.  
“SUBSY”:
- S in positions 1 and 4 → again forbidden.  
“SPUDS”:

“SWISH”:

- E is forbidden.  
“STUBB”:
- S in position 1 → forbidden.  
“STUBS” already checked.

Let’s look for a word with S not in 1 or 4, and U not in 3.  
“PUSSY”:
- S in positions 2 and 3, U in position 2.  
   – Contains P, U, S, S, Y.  
   – S not in 1 or 4.  
   – U not in 3.  
   – No forbidden letters.  
   – Valid 5-letter word.

“PUSSY” fits all constraints.

Another candidate: “BUSHY”:
- S in position 2, U in position 2.  
   – Also valid, but Y is less common.  
“PUSSY” seems better.

Let’s go with “PUSSY”.

From the new feedback on ""puddy"":
- U is correct in position 2 (✓).
- Y is correct in position 5 (✓).
- P, D, D are NOT in the word (x).

Current constraints:
1. Must have U in position 2 and Y in position 5.
2. Must contain S (from earlier feedback), but S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
3. Must not contain A, R, O, E, L, N, G, P, D.

So the pattern so far is: _ U _ _ Y, with S somewhere in positions 3 or 5 (but 5 is already Y), so S must be in position 3.

Thus the word must be: _ U S _ Y.

Remaining letters to choose from (excluding all forbidden letters): B, C, F, H, I, K, M, T, V, W, Z.

We need two different consonants for positions 1 and 4. Common combinations:

Possible words:
- B U S B Y (but B is repeated, and ""busby"" is not common)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses some of these high-frequency letters in different positions to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A, R, O, E are **not** in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the **wrong position** (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter S (but not in position 4).
- Does **not** contain A, R, O, E.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has S in a position other than 4.
2. Does not have A, R, O, E.

I’ll pick a word with common consonants and the known S, avoiding the eliminated vowels. ""SHOUT"" uses S in position 1, and the other letters (H, U, O, T) avoid the forbidden letters. However, ""SHOUT"" has O, which is eliminated. Let me rethink.

Better choices: use S plus consonants and the remaining vowels (I, U, Y). ""STUNS"" has S in position 1 and 4, but position 4 is forbidden for S. ""SPUNK"" uses S in position 1, P, U, N, K—avoiding forbidden letters. That seems good.

But let me double-check: ""SPUNK"" has S in position 1 (allowed), and no A, R, O, E. Perfect.

Alternatively, ""SLUNG"" has S in position 1, L, U, N, G—also valid. I'll go with ""SLUNG"".

<|im_end|>

From the two guesses we have:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – S is in the word but not in position 4.  
   – A, R, O, E are NOT in the word.

2. slung → S(-) L(x) U(-) N(x) G(x)  
   – S is still in the word but not in position 1.  
   – L, N, G are NOT in the word.  
   – U is in the word but not in position 3.

Summary of constraints:
- Letters that must appear: S (not in position 1 or 4), U (not in position 3).  
- Letters that must NOT appear: A, R, O, E, L, N, G.

Remaining common consonants and vowels: B, C, D, F, H, I, K, M, P, T, V, W, Y.  
We need a 5-letter word that:
- contains S and U,  
- places S not in positions 1 or 4,  
- places U not in position 3,  
- avoids all forbidden letters.

A quick scan of common words gives “SUCKY”:
- S is in position 1 → forbidden (from feedback).  
“STUBS”:
- S in positions 1 and 4 → both forbidden.  
“SUBSY”:
- S in positions 1 and 4 → again forbidden.  
“SPUDS”:
- S in positions 1 and 4 → same issue.  
“SWISH”:
- Contains H, I, W, S, H.  
   – S is in position 4 → forbidden.  
“SWUM” is only 4 letters.  
“SUPPS”:
- S in positions 1 and 5. Position 1 forbidden.  
“STUPS”:
- S in positions 1 and 4 → forbidden.  
“SUSHY”:
- S in position 1 → forbidden.  
“SUKKI”:
- S in position 1 → forbidden.  
“STUPE”:
- E is forbidden.  
“STUBB”:
- S in position 1 → forbidden.  
“STUBS” already checked.

Let’s look for a word with S not in 1 or 4, and U not in 3.  
“PUSSY”:
- S in positions 2 and 3, U in position 2.  
   – Contains P, U, S, S, Y.  
   – S not in 1 or 4.  
   – U not in 3.  
   – No forbidden letters.  
   – Valid 5-letter word.

“PUSSY” fits all constraints.

Another candidate: “BUSHY”:
- S in position 2, U in position 2.  
   – Also valid, but Y is less common.  
“PUSSY” seems better.

Let’s go with “PUSSY”.

From the latest feedback on ""husky"":
- U is correct in position 2 (✓) — already known.
- S is correct in position 3 (✓) — so S must be in position 3.
- Y is correct in position 5 (✓) — already known.
- H is in the word but not in position 1 (-).
- K is NOT in the word (x).

So the pattern is now: _ U S _ Y, with H somewhere in the word but not in position 1, and K excluded.

Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, E, L, N, G, P, D, K.

Letters already used in correct positions: U (pos 2), S (pos 3), Y (pos 5).

We need:
- H must appear somewhere, but not in position 1.
- Positions 1 and 4 must be filled with letters not yet ruled out and not already used.

Possible letters left: B, C, F, I, J, M, T, V, W, Z (plus H and S, U, Y already placed).

Since H must appear and cannot be in position 1, it must be in position 4.

Thus the word must be: _ U S H Y.

The only common 5-letter word that fits this pattern is ""mushy"" (M-U-S-H-Y).

Let's verify:
- M is not forbidden.
- U, S, H, Y are in the correct positions.
- No forbidden letters are used.

Therefore, the next guess is ""mushy"".
