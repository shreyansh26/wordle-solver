### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common consonants like S, T, N, R and vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices. A word like ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), covering 5 distinct letters. This gives us the best chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word and getting useful feedback.

Let’s summarize what we now know after the two guesses.

Letters we have tried and their statuses:
A, S – not in the word (✗)
R – in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 (–)
O – in the word but not in position 2 (–)
U, T – not in the word (✗)
E – in the word but not in positions 4 or 5 (–)

So far the confirmed letters are R, O, E.  
Positions still open for them:  
R: 3, 4, 5  
O: 1, 3, 4, 5  
E: 1, 2, 3  

We need a 5-letter word that contains R, O, E and avoids A, S, U, T.  
To gain maximum new information, we’ll place R, O, E in fresh spots and introduce two new, unused consonants.  
A good candidate is “ORDER”:
- It uses the confirmed letters R, O, E.
- R is in position 3 (new), O in 2 (new), E in 4 (new).
- Introduces D and another R (but the second R is redundant; however, it still tests new positions for R and O).
- Avoids all forbidden letters.

This should reveal more about allowable positions for R, O, E.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.

- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: A, S.
- Letters definitely present: R, O, E.
- Their positions to avoid: R≠2, O≠3, E≠5.

We need a 5-letter word that contains R, O, E and does not contain A or S. To maximize new information, pick a word that places R, O, E in new positions and introduces two new consonants.

A good candidate is “ROUTE”:
- It contains R, O, E.
- R is in position 1 (new), O in 2 (new), E in 4 (new).
- Introduces U and T, two new letters.
- Avoids A and S.

This should efficiently test new positions for the known letters and reveal more about the secret word.

Letters we have tried and their statuses:

R – in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 (–)
O – in the word but not in position 2 (–)
U, T – not in the word (✗)

Positions still open for them:  
R: 3, 4, 5  
O: 1, 3, 4, 5  
E: 1, 2, 3  

We need a 5-letter word that contains R, O, E and avoids A, S, U, T.  
To gain maximum new information, we’ll place R, O, E in fresh spots and introduce two new, unused consonants.  
A good candidate is “ORDER”:
- It uses the confirmed letters R, O, E.
- R is in position 3 (new), O in 2 (new), E in 4 (new).
- Introduces D and another R (but the second R is redundant; however, it still tests new positions for R and O).
- Avoids all forbidden letters.

This should reveal more about allowable positions for R, O, E.

- O G H E R – G and H are allowed.
- O P E R ? – but we need 5 letters and position 3 must be filled.

- O M B E R – valid word, uses M and B.
- O P E R ? – no valid word ending like that.

- O B E R ? – “ober” is 4 letters.

A good candidate is “ROUTE”:
- It contains R, O, E.
- R is in position 1 (new), O in 2 (new), E in 4 (new).
- Introduces U and T, two new letters.
- Avoids A and S.

This should efficiently test new positions for the known letters and reveal more about the secret word.

Let’s summarize what we now know after the two guesses.

Letters we have tried and their statuses:
A, S – not in the word (✗)
R – in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 (–)
O – in the word but not in position 2 (–)
U, T – not in the word (✗)
E – in the word but not in positions 4 or 5 (–)

So far the confirmed letters are R, O, E.  
Positions still open for them:  
R: 3, 4, 5  
O: 1, 3, 4, 5  
E: 1, 2, 3  

We need a 5-letter word that contains R, O, E and avoids A, S, U, T.  
To gain maximum new information, we’ll place R, O, E in fresh spots and introduce two new, unused consonants.  
A good candidate is “ORDER”:
- It uses the confirmed letters R, O, E.
- R is in position 3 (new), O in 2 (new), E in 4 (new).
- Introduces D and another R (but the second R is redundant; however, it still tests new positions for R and O).
- Avoids all forbidden letters.

This should reveal more about allowable positions for R, O, E.

Guess 3: order -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) R(-) D(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s digest the latest feedback on “order”:
- O(✓) → O is in position 1 and is correct.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- D(x) → D is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in position 4 and is correct.
- R(✓) → R is in position 5 and is correct.

So we now know the secret word has the pattern:
O _ _ E R

Letters still confirmed present: R (now fixed at 5), O (fixed at 1), E (fixed at 4).  
Letters ruled out: A, S, U, T, D.  
We need a 5-letter word that starts with O, ends with ER, contains no A, S, U, T, D, and uses only the remaining letters.

Possible middle letters (positions 2 and 3) must be from unused letters that are not A, S, U, T, D.  
Common consonants still available: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc.  
Common vowels still available: I, (since A is out, and O and E are already placed).

Let’s try “OVERT” – but T is already ruled out.  
Next, “OILER” – uses I and L, both allowed.  
Check: O I L E R – letters are O, I, L, E, R.  
- O is correct at 1.  
- I and L are new.  
- E is correct at 4.  
- R is correct at 5.  
- No ruled-out letters (A, S, U, T, D) are used.  

“OILER” fits perfectly.

Guess 3: order -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) R(-) D(x) E(✓) R(✓)

From the feedback on “oiler”:
- O(✓) – already correct in position 1.
- I(x) – I is not in the word.
- L(x) – L is not in the word.
- E(✓) – already correct in position 4.
- R(✓) – already correct in position 5.

So the secret word has the fixed pattern:
O _ _ E R

Letters we now know are NOT in the word:
A, S, U, T, D, I, L

Letters still available (among the remaining alphabet) for positions 2 and 3:
B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with O.
2. Ends with ER.
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.
4. Has its second and third letters from the still-allowed set.

Let’s list some possibilities:
- O B E R ? – but we need 5 letters, and position 3 is before E.
- O C H E R – uses C and H, both allowed.
- O M B E R – uses M and B, both allowed.
- O N E E R – but E is already in position 4; we can’t reuse it in position 3 (since each letter in the word is counted only once per occurrence).
- O G H E R – G and H are allowed.
- O P E R ? – but we need 5 letters and position 3 must be filled.

Looking at valid 5-letter words fitting O _ _ E R:
- O C H E R – valid word, uses C and H.
- O M B E R – valid word, uses M and B.
- O P E R ? – no valid word ending like that.
- O N E E R – invalid because it repeats E in position 3, but position 4 already has E; this would imply two E’s, which is possible, but we have no info against it. However, “oneer” isn’t a valid word.
- O G H E R – “ghcer” isn’t a word.
- O B E R ? – “ober” is 4 letters.

Between the valid options, “o_ch_er” and “o_m_b_er”, both fit. Let’s pick “o_ch_er” (O C H E R) because C and H are common letters and haven’t been tested yet.

Check:
- O(✓) in position 1.
- C – new, allowed.
- H – new, allowed.
- E(✓) in position 4.
- R(✓) in position 5.

No ruled-out letters used.
