For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The best starting words often include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" covers S, L, A, T, E - good coverage of common letters.
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E - similar coverage.
- ""RAISE"" has R, A, I, S, E - includes three vowels (A, I, E) and common consonants.

""RAISE"" seems particularly good because it includes:
- R (very common starting letter)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (another common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common ending letter)

This gives us a good mix to identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R: not in the word (x)
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)
- I: correct position (✓) — so I is the third letter
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: correct position (✓) — so E is the fifth letter

Known so far:
- Pattern: _ _ I _ E
- Letters in the word somewhere (but not in those positions): A
- Letters ruled out: R, S

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has I in position 3
2. Has E in position 5
3. Contains A somewhere else (not in position 2)
4. Does not contain R or S

Possible positions for A: 1, 3, or 4 (but 3 is already I, so 1 or 4)
Possible consonants left to try: common ones like T, N, L, C, D, M, etc.

Let’s try a word that fits _ A I _ E or _ _ I A E. A good candidate is ""TALKE"":
- T: new letter
- A: in word, now in position 2 (which was marked wrong before, so this is a test)
- I: correct position
- K: new letter
- E: correct position

But ""TALKE"" isn’t a valid word. Next candidate: ""CAINE"" (variant spelling of ""waine"", but not common). Better: ""GNAIE"" — no. How about ""VIANE"" — no.

Wait, let’s think of common words with _ _ I _ E. ""CHIME"" comes to mind, but it has H, not A. ""F I E N E"" — no. ""L I A N E"" — no.

Another approach: since A must appear somewhere, and positions 3 and 5 are fixed, try A in position 1 or 4.

Word with A in position 1: A _ I _ E. Common word: ""AGILE"" — but has G, L, not sure. ""ANIME"" — has M. ""ALIEN"" — has L, N.

""ALIEN"" seems valid:
- A in position 1 (new position for A)
- L: new letter
- I: correct
- E: correct
- N: new letter

But does ""ALIEN"" contain A somewhere? Yes, in position 1. And it doesn’t contain R or S. This seems valid.

However, ""ALIEN"" has A in position 1, which is new. Let me check if this is the best next guess.

Another candidate: ""AURIE"" — but has R (ruled out). ""ACUTE"" — has U, C, T, but E is correct, but A is in position 1. But ""ACUTE"" has U in position 2, but we know A must be in the word.

Wait, the feedback says A is in the word but wrong position (position 2 in RAISE). So A could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5. But 3 is I, 5 is E, so A must be in 1 or 4.

Let’s try ""AURIE"" — but R is out. ""ACUTE"" — no R or S, and A is in position 1. This seems valid.

But ""ALIEN"" seems more straightforward. Let me go with ""ALIEN"" as it’s a common word and tests A in position 1.

Wait, but in RAISE, A was in position 2 and marked as wrong position. So A could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5. But 3 is I, 5 is E, so A is in 1 or 4.

Let me try ""AURIE"" — but R is out. ""ACUTE"" — no R or S, A in position 1. This seems valid.

Actually, ""ALIEN"" is valid and fits all constraints. Let me confirm:
- A in position 1 (new position)
- L: new
- I: correct
- E: correct
- N: new
No R or S, and it’s a valid word.

So I’ll go with ""ALIEN"".

Let's digest the new feedback on ALIEN:

A(✓) – the A is now in the correct position (position 1).
L(x) – L is NOT in the word.
I(✓) – I is confirmed in position 3.
E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (it was marked ✓ in position 5 last time, so this must be an error or miscommunication; the feedback system only shows ✓ for correct position, and -/x for elsewhere). Actually, the feedback says E(-), meaning E is in the word but in the wrong position. But we already know from RAISE that E is in position 5 (✓). This seems contradictory. Wait, re-reading the feedback:

Guess 2: ALIEN -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(x) I(✓) E(-) N(-)

This implies:
- E is in the word but not in position 4 (it was in position 5 in the previous guess and marked ✓, so this must mean E is indeed in position 5 and the feedback here is indicating E is NOT in position 4, which is redundant since it's already confirmed in 5). This is a bit confusing, but the key takeaway is that E is confirmed in position 5 (from RAISE) and in ALIEN it's in position 4 but marked -, so E must be in position 5 and the feedback here is just re-affirming that.

Similarly, N(-) means N is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we have:
- Position 1: A (✓)
- Position 3: I (✓)
- Position 5: E (from RAISE ✓)
- Letters in word somewhere: N (from N(-) in ALIEN)
- Letters ruled out: R, S, L

We need a 5-letter word with pattern: A _ I _ E, and it must contain N somewhere (but N cannot be in position 5 because it was marked - there, so N must be in position 2 or 4).

Possible positions for N: 2 or 4.

Looking at common words:
- A N I _ E: ""ANIME"" – but M and U are not tested yet, and we know E is in position 5.
- A _ I N E: ""ADINE"" – but D is untested.
- ""AUDIO"" – but O is untested and U is untested, but we know E is in 5.
- ""ACINE"" – not a valid word.

Wait, let's think of valid words with A _ I _ E:
- ""ANIME"" – A N I M E – but M is untested, and N is in position 2 (which is allowed).
- ""ADINE"" – A D I N E – N in position 4 (allowed).
- ""ALONE"" – but L is ruled out.
- ""APODE"" – not valid.
- ""AFOIE"" – not valid.

""ANIME"" seems valid and fits all constraints:
- A(✓) in 1
- N in 2 (not ruled out)
- I(✓) in 3
- M untested
- E(✓) in 5

But we also know from ALIEN that N is in the word (N(-)), so ""ANIME"" includes N in position 2, which is allowed.

However, ""ANIME"" has M which hasn't been tested yet. Let's see if there's a better word that tests more common letters.

Another candidate: ""ADINE"" – A D I N E
- D is a common consonant not yet tested.
- N is in position 4 (allowed).

Between ""ANIME"" and ""ADINE"", ""ADINE"" uses D which is very common, so I'll go with that.

But wait, let me double-check:
- A _ I _ E with N in 2 or 4.
- ""ADINE"" – A D I N E – valid word.
- ""ANIME"" – A N I M E – valid word.

Both fit, but ""ADINE"" tests D which is more common than M. So I'll choose ""ADINE"".

However, upon reflection, ""ANIME"" is actually more common and uses M which is highly probable given the context. Let me go with ""ANIME"".

But let me re-examine the constraints:
- Must have A _ I _ E
- Must contain N (but not in position 5)
- Cannot contain R, S, L

""ANIME"" – A N I M E:
- N is in position 2 (allowed)
- M is untested
- All other letters are in correct positions or allowed.

This seems optimal.

Final choice: ""ANIME""
</think>

Based on the feedback:
- A is confirmed in position 1
- I is confirmed in position 3
- E is confirmed in position 5
- N is in the word but not in position 5 (so it must be in position 2 or 4)
- Letters ruled out: R, S, L

The word must be of the form A _ I _ E with N in position 2 or 4. The most straightforward common word fitting this is ""ANIME"".
