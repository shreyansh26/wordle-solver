For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, etc. A popular and effective first guess is ""SLATE"" because it covers:
- S: Very common starting letter
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Most common letter in English

This gives us a good spread of letters to work with and should provide helpful feedback for narrowing down possibilities.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: S, T, Y  
Letters that ARE in the word: E, A, L, R  
Exact positions ruled out so far  
- E cannot be in position 1 (from EARLY) or 5 (from SLATE)  
- A cannot be in position 2 (from EARLY) or 3 (from SLATE)  
- L cannot be in position 2 (from SLATE) or 4 (from EARLY)  
- R is correctly placed in position 3 (✓)

So the pattern so far is:  
_ _ R _ _

and the remaining letters to place are E, A, L, plus one more letter that must come from the unused consonants (since we still have one blank).

Possible positions for the letters we have:
E: allowed in positions 2, 3, 4 (but 3 is R, so 2 or 4)  
A: allowed in positions 1, 4, 5 (but 5 is still open)  
L: allowed in positions 1, 3, 5 (but 3 is R, so 1 or 5)

Let’s try to assemble a valid word that fits:

If we place E in position 2 and L in position 1, we get:
L E R _ _

We still need two more letters, but we already have L, E, R. The remaining two positions must be filled with letters that are still unused and valid. However, we only have one more letter (A) that we know must be in the word. This suggests we need to place A somewhere.

Looking at the positions:
- A cannot be in 2 or 3, so it could go in 4 or 5.
- If we place A in 4, we get: L E R A _
- The last letter must be a consonant we haven’t used yet. From the remaining consonants, D, G, M, N, P, etc. are still possible. However, we know L must be in the word and we’ve placed L in position 1, so this is valid.

But we need to check if L E R A _ is a valid word. The closest valid word is ""LERAS"" but that’s not a common word. Instead, let’s try:

Place A in position 5: _ _ R _ A  
We know E must be in the word and cannot be in 2 or 5, so E could be in 4.  
Then we have: _ _ R E A  
We know L must be in the word and cannot be in 2 or 4, so L could be in 1 or 5. 5 is A, so L must be in 1:  
L _ R E A  
The missing letter is in position 2. This must be a consonant we haven’t used yet. From the feedback, unused consonants include D, G, M, N, P, etc. The valid word that fits is ""LARGE"" but G is unused and fits.

Let’s go with ""LARGE"":
- L is in position 1 (allowed)
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since it was only disallowed in 3 and 2? Wait, A was marked wrong in position 2 (from EARLY) so A cannot be in 2. So ""LARGE"" is invalid because A is in 2.

Let’s try another arrangement:
Place L in position 5: _ _ R _ L  
E must be in 2 or 4.  
A must be in 1, 4, or 5 (but 5 is L), so A could be in 1 or 4.  
Let’s try A in 1: A _ R _ L  
E must go in 2 or 4. 2 is open, so E in 2: A E R _ L  
The missing letter is in position 4. It must be a consonant we haven’t used yet. From the feedback, unused consonants include D, G, M, N, P, etc. The valid word is ""AERIL"" but that’s not common. Instead, let’s try A in 4 and E in 2:

_ E R A L  
We need a consonant in position 1. Unused consonants: D, G, M, N, P, etc. The valid word is ""DERAL"" but that’s not common. Instead, let’s try ""PERAL"" but P is unused and valid.

But ""PERAL"" is valid, but let’s see if it fits:
P E R A L  
- P is new, allowed  
- E is in position 2 (allowed)  
- R is in 3 (matches ✓)  
- A is in 4 (allowed)  
- L is in 5 (allowed)  

This seems perfect. However, we need to check if this uses only the letters we know must be in the word (E, A, R, L) plus one new consonant. This is acceptable because we still have one blank.

But ""PERAL"" is a valid word. However, let’s see if there’s a more common word. Another candidate is ""CERAL"" but C is unused and might be too obscure.

Instead, let’s try ""MERAL"" but M is unused. The most straightforward valid word fitting the constraints is ""LARGE"" but as noted, A is in position 2 which was disallowed.

Let’s try a different approach: list possible positions for E, A, L.

We need a word with pattern: [consonant] [consonant] R [position for E or A or L] [position for remaining letters]

Given the constraints:
- E can be 2 or 4  
- A can be 1 or 4 or 5  
- L can be 1 or 5  

Let’s try placing A in 1, E in 2, L in 5:  
A E R _ L  
The missing letter is in position 4. It must be a consonant we haven’t used yet. The valid word is ""AERIL"" but that’s not common. Instead, let’s try ""AEROL"" but that’s also obscure.

Let’s try A in 1, L in 5, E in 4:  
A _ R E L  
The missing letter is in position 2. It must be a consonant. The valid word is ""AEREL"" but that’s not valid. Instead, let’s try ""AERAL"" which is not valid.

Let’s try L in 1, A in 4, E in 2:  
L E R A _  
The missing letter is in position 5. It must be a consonant. The valid word is ""LERAS"" but that’s not common.

Let’s try L in 1, E in 4, A in 5:  
L _ R E A  
The missing letter is in position 2. It must be a consonant. The valid word is ""LIGEA"" but that’s not valid.

Let’s try L in 5, A in 1, E in 2:  
A E R _ L  
The missing letter is in position 4. The valid word is ""AERIL"" but not common.

Let’s try L in 5, A in 4, E in 2:  
_ E R A L  
The missing letter is in position 1. It must be a consonant. The valid word is ""TERAL"" but T was already ruled out (from SLATE: T(x)).

Unused consonants include D, G, M, N, P, etc. The valid word is ""DERAL"" but that’s not common. The most common valid word fitting is ""LARGE"" but A is in position 2 which was disallowed.

Wait, let’s re-examine the constraints for A:
From SLATE: A was in position 3 → marked wrong, so A cannot be in 3.  
From EARLY: A was in position 2 → marked wrong, so A cannot be in 2.  
So A can be in 1, 4, or 5.

Similarly, E:
From SLATE: E was in 5 → marked wrong, so E cannot be 5.  
From EARLY: E was in 1 → marked wrong, so E cannot be 1.  
So E can be in 2 or 4.

L:
From SLATE: L was in 2 → marked wrong, so L cannot be 2.  
From EARLY: L was in 4 → marked wrong, so L cannot be 4.  
So L can be in 1 or 5.

R is fixed in position 3.

So possible patterns:
1) A in 1, E in 2: A E R _ _  
   L must be in 5: A E R _ L  
   Position 4 must be a consonant we haven’t used. Valid word: ""AERIL"" – not common.

2) A in 1, E in 4: A _ R E _  
   L must be in 5: A _ R E L  
   Position 2 must be a consonant we haven’t used. Valid word: ""AEREL"" – not valid.

3) A in 4, E in 2: _ E R A _  
   L must be in 1 or 5.  
   - L in 1: L E R A _ → position 5 must be consonant. Valid word: ""LERAS"" – not common.  
   - L in 5: _ E R A L → position 1 must be consonant. Valid word: ""TERAL"" – T is out.

4) A in 5, E in 2: _ E R _ A  
   L must be in 1: L E R _ A  
   Position 4 must be a consonant we haven’t used. Valid word: ""LIGRA"" – not valid.

5) A in 5, E in 4: _ _ R A A – invalid (double A).

6) A in 1, E in 2, L in 5: A E R _ L – already considered.

Let’s try a different consonant set. The missing letter must be from unused consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for valid 5-letter words that fit:
- Pattern: _ _ R _ _ with letters E, A, L already placed.

One valid word is ""CERAL"" but C is unused and it’s obscure.

Another is ""BERAL"" – B is unused, valid word.

Let’s try ""BERAL"":
B E R A L  
Check constraints:
- B is new consonant, allowed.  
- E is in position 2 (allowed)  
- R is in 3 (matches ✓)  
- A is in 4 (allowed)  
- L is in 5 (allowed)  

This fits all constraints and is a valid word.

Thus, the next guess is ""BERAL"".
</think>

Based on the feedback from the first two guesses, I now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, T, Y
- Letters that ARE in the word: E, A, L, R
- R is correctly placed in position 3
- E cannot be in positions 1 or 5
- A cannot be in positions 2 or 3
- L cannot be in positions 2 or 4

The most recent valid arrangement that satisfies all these constraints is ""B E R A L"". 

<guess>BERAL</guess>",BERAL,"From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: S, T, Y  
Letters that ARE in the word: E, A, L, R  
Exact positions ruled out so far  
- E cannot be in position 1 (from EARLY) or 5 (from SLATE)  
- A cannot be in position 2 (from EARLY) or 3 (from SLATE)  
- L cannot be in position 2 (from SLATE) or 4 (from EARLY)  
- R is correctly placed in position 3 (✓)

So the pattern so far is:  
_ _ R _ _

and the remaining letters to place are E, A, L, plus one more letter that must come from the unused consonants (since we still have one blank).

Possible positions for the letters we have:
E: allowed in positions 2, 3, 4 (but 3 is R, so 2 or 4)  
A: allowed in positions 1, 4, 5 (but 5 is still open)  
L: allowed in positions 1, 3, 5 (but 3 is R, so 1 or 5)

Let’s try to assemble a valid word that fits:

If we place E in position 2 and L in position 1, we get:
L E R _ _

We still need two more letters, but we already have L, E, R. The remaining two positions must be filled with letters that are still unused and valid. However, we only have one more letter (A) that we know must be in the word. This suggests we need to place A somewhere.

Looking at the positions:
- A cannot be in 2 or 3, so it could go in 4 or 5.
- If we place A in 4, we get: L E R A _
- The last letter must be a consonant we haven’t used yet. From the remaining consonants, D, G, M, N, P, etc. are still possible. However, we know L must be in the word and we’ve placed L in position 1, so this is valid.

But we need to check if L E R A _ is a valid word. The closest valid word is ""LERAS"" but that’s not a common word. Instead, let’s try:

Place A in position 5: _ _ R _ A  
We know E must be in the word and cannot be in 2 or 5, so E could be in 4.  
Then we have: _ _ R E A  
We know L must be in the word and cannot be in 2 or 4, so L could be in 1 or 5. 5 is A, so L must be in 1:  
L _ R E A  
The missing letter is in position 2. This must be a consonant we haven’t used yet. From the feedback, unused consonants include D, G, M, N, P, etc. The valid word that fits is ""LARGE"" but G is unused and fits.

Let’s go with ""LARGE"":
- L is in position 1 (allowed)
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since it was only disallowed in 3 and 2? Wait, A was marked wrong in position 2 (from EARLY) so A cannot be in 2. So ""LARGE"" is invalid because A is in 2.

Let’s try another arrangement:
Place L in position 5: _ _ R _ L  
E must be in 2 or 4.  
A must be in 1, 4, or 5 (but 5 is L), so A could be in 1 or 4.  
Let’s try A in 1: A _ R _ L  
E must go in 2 or 4. 2 is open, so E in 2: A E R _ L  
The missing letter is in position 4. It must be a consonant we haven’t used yet. From the feedback, unused consonants include D, G, M, N, P, etc. The valid word is ""AERIL"" but that’s not common. Instead, let’s try A in 4 and E in 2:

_ E R A L  
We need a consonant in position 1. Unused consonants: D, G, M, N, P, etc. The valid word is ""DERAL"" but that’s not common. Instead, let’s try ""PERAL"" but P is unused and valid.

But ""PERAL"" is valid, but let’s see if it fits:
P E R A L  
- P is new, allowed  
- E is in position 2 (allowed)  
- R is in 3 (matches ✓)  
- A is in 4 (allowed)  
- L is in 5 (allowed)  

This seems perfect. However, we need to check if this uses only the letters we know must be in the word (E, A, R, L) plus one new consonant. This is acceptable because we still have one blank.

But ""PERAL"" is a valid word. However, let’s see if there’s a more common word. Another candidate is ""CERAL"" but C is unused and might be too obscure.

Instead, let’s try ""MERAL"" but M is unused. The most straightforward valid word fitting the constraints is ""LARGE"" but as noted, A is in position 2 which was disallowed.

Let’s try a different approach: list possible positions for E, A, L.

We need a word with pattern: [consonant] [consonant] R [position for E or A or L] [position for remaining letters]

Given the constraints:
- E can be 2 or 4  
- A can be 1 or 4 or 5  
- L can be 1 or 5  

Let’s try placing A in 1, E in 2, L in 5:  
A E R _ L  
The missing letter is in position 4. It must be a consonant we haven’t used yet. The valid word is ""AERIL"" but that’s not common. Instead, let’s try ""AEROL"" but that’s also obscure.

Let’s try A in 1, L in 5, E in 4:  
A _ R E L  
The missing letter is in position 2. It must be a consonant. The valid word is ""AEREL"" but that’s not valid. Instead, let’s try ""AERAL"" which is not valid.

Let’s try L in 1, A in 4, E in 2:  
L E R A _  
The missing letter is in position 5. It must be a consonant. The valid word is ""LERAS"" but that’s not common.

Let’s try L in 1, E in 4, A in 5:  
L _ R E A  
The missing letter is in position 2. It must be a consonant. The valid word is ""LIGEA"" but that’s not valid.

Let’s try L in 5, A in 1, E in 2:  
A E R _ L  
The missing letter is in position 4. The valid word is ""AERIL"" but not common.

Let’s try L in 5, A in 4, E in 2:  
_ E R A L  
The missing letter is in position 1. It must be a consonant. The valid word is ""TERAL"" but T was already ruled out (from SLATE: T(x)).

Unused consonants include D, G, M, N, P, etc. The valid word is ""DERAL"" but that’s not common. The most common valid word fitting is ""LARGE"" but A is in position 2 which was disallowed.

Wait, let’s re-examine the constraints for A:
From SLATE: A was in position 3 → marked wrong, so A cannot be in 3.  
From EARLY: A was in position 2 → marked wrong, so A cannot be in 2.  
So A can be in 1, 4, or 5.

Similarly, E:
From SLATE: E was in 5 → marked wrong, so E cannot be 5.  
From EARLY: E was in 1 → marked wrong, so E cannot be 1.  
So E can be in 2 or 4.

L:
From SLATE: L was in 2 → marked wrong, so L cannot be 2.  
From EARLY: L was in 4 → marked wrong, so L cannot be 4.  
So L can be in 1 or 5.

R is fixed in position 3.

So possible patterns:
1) A in 1, E in 2: A E R _ _  
   L must be in 5: A E R _ L  
   Position 4 must be a consonant we haven’t used. Valid word: ""AERIL"" – not common.

2) A in 1, E in 4: A _ R E _  
   L must be in 5: A _ R E L  
   Position 2 must be a consonant we haven’t used. Valid word: ""AEREL"" – not valid.

3) A in 4, E in 2: _ E R A _  
   L must be in 1 or 5.  
   - L in 1: L E R A _ → position 5 must be consonant. Valid word: ""LERAS"" – not common.  
   - L in 5: _ E R A L → position 1 must be consonant. Valid word: ""TERAL"" – T is out.

4) A in 5, E in 2: _ E R _ A  
   L must be in 1: L E R _ A  
   Position 4 must be a consonant we haven’t used. Valid word: ""LIGRA"" – not valid.

5) A in 5, E in 4: _ _ R A A – invalid (double A).

6) A in 1, E in 2, L in 5: A E R _ L – already considered.

Let’s try a different consonant set. The missing letter must be from unused consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for valid 5-letter words that fit:
- Pattern: _ _ R _ _ with letters E, A, L already placed.

One valid word is ""CERAL"" but C is unused and it’s obscure.

Another is ""BERAL"" – B is unused, valid word.

Let’s try ""BERAL"":
B E R A L  
Check constraints:
- B is new consonant, allowed.  
- E is in position 2 (allowed)  
- R is in 3 (matches ✓)  
- A is in 4 (allowed)  
- L is in 5 (allowed)  

This fits all constraints and is a valid word.

Thus, the next guess is ""BERAL"".Based on the feedback from the first two guesses, I now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, T, Y
- Letters that ARE in the word: E, A, L, R
- R is correctly placed in position 3
- E cannot be in positions 1 or 5
- A cannot be in positions 2 or 3
- L cannot be in positions 2 or 4

For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, etc. A popular and effective first guess is ""SLATE"" because it covers:
- S: Very common starting letter
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Most common letter in English

This gives us a good spread of letters to work with and should provide helpful feedback for narrowing down possibilities.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
- L(-) – L is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- T(x) – T is not in the word at all.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So we now know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, T
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions we still need to place: L, A, E

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain S or T
- Contains L, A, E (in any positions except the ones already ruled out)
- Uses only valid English letters and words

A good candidate is “LEARN”:
- L is in position 1 (allowed, since it was only marked wrong in position 2)
- E is in position 2 (allowed, since it was only marked wrong in position 5)
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since it was only marked wrong in position 3) – wait, this is actually disallowed because A was marked wrong in position 3.

Let me reconsider. A cannot be in position 3, L cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.

Another candidate: “EARLY”
- E is in position 1 (allowed)
- A is in position 2 (allowed)
- R is a new letter we haven’t tested
- L is in position 3 (allowed, since it was only wrong in position 2)
- Y is a new letter we haven’t tested

This seems valid. Let’s go with EARLY.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that ARE in the word: E, A, L, R  
Exact positions ruled out so far  
- E cannot be in position 1 (from EARLY) or 5 (from SLATE)  
- A cannot be in position 2 (from EARLY) or 3 (from SLATE)

and the remaining letters to place are E, A, L, plus one more letter that must come from the unused consonants (since we still have one blank).

Let’s try A in 1, L in 5, E in 4:  
A _ R E L  
The missing letter is in position 2. It must be a consonant. The valid word is ""AEREL"" but that’s not valid. Instead, let’s try ""AERAL"" which is not valid.

Let’s try L in 1, A in 4, E in 2:  
L E R A _  
The missing letter is in position 5. It must be a consonant. The valid word is ""LERAS"" but that’s not common.

Let’s try L in 1, E in 4, A in 5:

Wait, let’s re-examine the constraints for A:
From SLATE: A was in position 3 → marked wrong, so A cannot be in 3.  
From EARLY: A was in position 2 → marked wrong, so A cannot be in 2.  
So A can be in 1, 4, or 5.

Similarly, E:

From EARLY: L was in 4 → marked wrong, so L cannot be 4.  
So L can be in 1 or 5.

R is fixed in position 3.

So possible patterns:
1) A in 1, E in 2: A E R _ _  
   L must be in 5: A E R _ L  
   Position 4 must be a consonant we haven’t used. Valid word: ""AERIL"" – not common.

5) A in 5, E in 4: _ _ R A A – invalid (double A).

6) A in 1, E in 2, L in 5: A E R _ L – already considered.

Let’s try a different consonant set. The missing letter must be from unused consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for valid 5-letter words that fit:
- Pattern: _ _ R _ _ with letters E, A, L already placed.

One valid word is ""CERAL"" but C is unused and it’s obscure.

Another is ""BERAL"" – B is unused, valid word.

Let’s try ""BERAL"":
B E R A L  
Check constraints:
- B is new consonant, allowed.  
- E is in position 2 (allowed)  
- R is in 3 (matches ✓)  
- A is in 4 (allowed)  
- L is in 5 (allowed)  

This fits all constraints and is a valid word.

Thus, the next guess is ""BERAL"".Based on the feedback from the first two guesses, I now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, T, Y
- Letters that ARE in the word: E, A, L, R
- R is correctly placed in position 3
- E cannot be in positions 1 or 5
- A cannot be in positions 2 or 3
- L cannot be in positions 2 or 4

The most recent valid arrangement that satisfies all these constraints is ""B E R A L"".

Another candidate is ""CERAL"" but C is unused and might be too obscure.\n\nInstead, let’s try ""MERAL"" but M is unused. The most straightforward valid word fitting the constraints is ""LARGE"" but as noted, A is in position 2 which was disallowed.\n\nLet’s try a different approach: list possible positions for E, A, L.\n\nWe need a word with pattern: [consonant] [consonant] R [position for E or A or L] [position for remaining letters]\n\nGiven the constraints:\n- E can be 2 or 4  \n- A can be 1 or 4 or 5  \n- L can be 1 or 5  \n\nLet’s try placing A in 1, E in 2, L in 5:  \nA E R _ L  \nThe missing letter is in position 4.

The valid word is ""TERAL"" but T was already ruled out (from SLATE: T(x)).\n\nUnused consonants include D, G, M, N, P, etc. The valid word is ""DERAL"" but that’s not common. The most common valid word fitting is ""LARGE"" but A is in position 2 which was disallowed.\n\nWait, let’s re-examine the constraints for A:\nFrom SLATE: A was in position 3 → marked wrong, so A cannot be in 3.  \nFrom EARLY: A was in position 2 → marked wrong, so A cannot be in 2.  \nSo A can be in 1, 4, or 5.\n\nSimilarly, E:\nFrom SLATE: E was in 5 → marked wrong, so E cannot be 5.  \nFrom EARLY: E was in 1 → marked wrong, so E cannot be 1.  \nSo E can be in 2 or 4.\n\nL:\nFrom SLATE: L was in 2 → marked wrong, so L cannot be 2.  \nFrom EARLY: L was in 4 → marked wrong, so L cannot be 4.  \nSo L can be in 1 or 5.\n\nR is fixed in position 3.\n\nSo possible patterns:\n1) A in 1, E in 2: A E R _ _  \n   L must be in 5: A E R _ L  \n   Position 4 must be a consonant we haven’t used. Valid word: ""AERIL"" – not common.\n\n2) A in 1, E in 4: A _ R E _  \n   L must be in 5: A _ R E L  \n   Position 2 must be a consonant we haven’t used.

The missing letter must be from unused consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nLooking for valid 5-letter words that fit:\n- Pattern: _ _ R _ _ with letters E, A, L already placed.\n\nOne valid word is ""CERAL"" but C is unused and it’s obscure.\n\nAnother is ""BERAL"" – B is unused, valid word.\n\nLet’s try ""BERAL"":\nB E R A L  \nCheck constraints:\n- B is new consonant, allowed.  \n- E is in position 2 (allowed)  \n- R is in 3 (matches ✓)  \n- A is in 4 (allowed)  \n- L is in 5 (allowed)  \n\nThis fits all constraints and is a valid word.\n\nThus, the next guess is ""BERAL"".Based on the feedback from the first two guesses, I now know:\n- Letters NOT in the word: S, T, Y\n- Letters that ARE in the word: E, A, L, R\n- R is correctly placed in position 3\n- E cannot be in positions 1 or 5\n- A cannot be in positions 2 or 3\n- L cannot be in positions 2 or 4\n\nThe most recent valid arrangement that satisfies all these constraints is ""B E R A L"".\n\n<guess>BERAL</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: EARLY -> FEEDBACK: E(-) A(-) R(✓) L(-) Y(x)\nGuess 3: BERAL -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) R(✓) A(✓) L(✓)\n'}]","<think>
From the latest feedback on BERAL:
- B(x) – B is NOT in the word.

- A(✓) – A is in the word and is CORRECTLY placed in position 4.
- L(✓) – L is in the word and is CORRECTLY placed in position 5.

So we now know the exact pattern: _ E R A L.

We still need the first letter.  
Letters already ruled out: S, T, Y, B.  
Letters already used: E, R, A, L.

Remaining consonants for position 1: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Among these, common starting letters in 5-letter English words include C, D, F, G, H, M, N, P.

Let’s pick a common one: C.

The word would be C E R A L → “CERAL” – but “CERAL” is not a standard English word.

Next common consonant: D → D E R A L → “DERAL” – also not standard.

Next: F → F E R A L → “FERAL” – this is a valid English word meaning relating to ferrets or ferality.

So the only remaining letter that fits is F.
