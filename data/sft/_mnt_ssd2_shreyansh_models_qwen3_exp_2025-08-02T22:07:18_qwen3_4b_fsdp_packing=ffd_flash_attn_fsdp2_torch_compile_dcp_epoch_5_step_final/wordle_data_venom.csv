For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English words.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A strong starting word would use several of these letters. Some popular choices are:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it contains three very common vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants might be present in the secret word.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R, A, I, S are NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E
- Does NOT contain R, A, I, S
- Must be a 5-letter word with E somewhere other than the last position

I need a word that:
1. Has E in it (and not in position 5)
2. Does not have R, A, I, S
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, B, F, G, H, K, P, U, V, W, Y
Good vowels left: O, U (since A and I are out, E is already known)

I'll try to include some of these high-frequency letters. A good candidate is ""TOWER"":
- T, O, W, E, R
- But R is already eliminated, so this is invalid.

Next candidate: ""UNTIE"" - but I is eliminated.

Next: ""CLOTE"" - but O and T are good letters, but E must be in wrong position. However, in CLOTE, E is in position 4, which is allowed. But C, L, O, T are all new letters.

Wait, let me think better. Since E is in the word but not at position 5, I can try a word where E is in position 1,2,3 or 4 and avoid R,A,I,S.

A good choice is ""OUTER"":
- O, U, T, E, R
- R is eliminated, so this is invalid.

""UNMET"":
- U, N, M, E, T
- E is in position 4 (allowed)
- Uses U, N, M, T which are all new letters
- No R, A, I, S

This seems like a strong second guess to test new letters while keeping E somewhere in the word.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)

2. UNMET → U(x) N(-) M(-) E(-) T(x)

   – N is in the word, but not in position 2.  
   – M is in the word, but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, A, I, S, U, T  
- Letters definitely in the word: E, N, M  
- Positions still unknown for E, N, M.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains E, N, M exactly once each.  
- Places E somewhere other than 4 or 5.  
- Places N somewhere other than 2.  
- Places M somewhere other than 3.  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, V, W, Y  
Remaining vowels: O (since A, I are out, E is already in).

A good candidate that satisfies all constraints and introduces new common letters is “COMET”:
- C, O, M, E, T  
However, T is already ruled out (feedback from UNMET showed T(x)), so COMET is invalid.

Next candidate: “BENCH”
- B, E, N, C, H  
E is in position 2 (allowed), N in position 3 (allowed since it’s not in position 2), M is not present – but we know M must be in the word, so BENCH is invalid.

Next: “MENUS” – contains S (ruled out) and U (ruled out).

Next: “MOLEN” – uses O, L, which are still allowed. E is in position 4 (but E cannot be in 4 or 5 per feedback), so invalid.

Next: “MONEY”
- M, O, N, E, Y  
E is in position 4 – invalid (feedback says E not in 4 or 5).  
Also, N is in position 3 – allowed (only position 2 was ruled out).

Next: “MONGE” – not a valid English word.

Next: “MENOC” – not a valid word.

Next: “MOVEN” – uses V, O, E, M, N.  
E is in position 4 – invalid.

Next: “MELON”
- M, E, L, O, N  
E is in position 2 – allowed.  
N is in position 5 – allowed (only position 2 was ruled out for N).  
M is in position 1 – allowed (only position 3 was ruled out for M).  
Letters used: M, E, L, O, N – none of which have been ruled out except O is new.  
This satisfies all constraints.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English words.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A strong starting word would use several of these letters. Some popular choices are:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it contains three very common vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants might be present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R, A, I, S are NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E
- Does NOT contain R, A, I, S
- Must be a 5-letter word with E somewhere other than the last position

I need a word that:
1. Has E in it (and not in position 5)
2. Does not have R, A, I, S
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, B, F, G, H, K, P, U, V, W, Y
Good vowels left: O, U (since A and I are out, E is already known)

I'll try to include some of these high-frequency letters. A good candidate is ""TOWER"":
- T, O, W, E, R
- But R is already eliminated, so this is invalid.

Next candidate: ""UNTIE"" - but I is eliminated.

Next: ""CLOTE"" - but O and T are good letters, but E must be in wrong position. However, in CLOTE, E is in position 4, which is allowed. But C, L, O, T are all new letters.

Wait, let me think better. Since E is in the word but not at position 5, I can try a word where E is in position 1,2,3 or 4 and avoid R,A,I,S.

A good choice is ""OUTER"":
- O, U, T, E, R
- R is eliminated, so this is invalid.

""UNMET"":
- U, N, M, E, T
- E is in position 4 (allowed)
- Uses U, N, M, T which are all new letters
- No R, A, I, S

This seems like a strong second guess to test new letters while keeping E somewhere in the word.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)  
   – E is in the word, but not in position 5.

2. UNMET → U(x) N(-) M(-) E(-) T(x)  
   – E is still in the word, but not in positions 4 or 5.  
   – N is in the word, but not in position 2.  
   – M is in the word, but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, A, I, S, U, T  
- Letters definitely in the word: E, N, M  
- Positions still unknown for E, N, M.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains E, N, M exactly once each.  
- Places E somewhere other than 4 or 5.  
- Places N somewhere other than 2.  
- Places M somewhere other than 3.  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, V, W, Y  
Remaining vowels: O (since A, I are out, E is already in).

A good candidate that satisfies all constraints and introduces new common letters is “COMET”:
- C, O, M, E, T  
However, T is already ruled out (feedback from UNMET showed T(x)), so COMET is invalid.

Next candidate: “BENCH”
- B, E, N, C, H  
E is in position 2 (allowed), N in position 3 (allowed since it’s not in position 2), M is not present – but we know M must be in the word, so BENCH is invalid.

Next: “MENUS” – contains S (ruled out) and U (ruled out).

Next: “MOLEN” – uses O, L, which are still allowed. E is in position 4 (but E cannot be in 4 or 5 per feedback), so invalid.

Next: “MONEY”
- M, O, N, E, Y  
E is in position 4 – invalid (feedback says E not in 4 or 5).  
Also, N is in position 3 – allowed (only position 2 was ruled out).

Next: “MONGE” – not a valid English word.

Next: “MENOC” – not a valid word.

Next: “MOVEN” – uses V, O, E, M, N.  
E is in position 4 – invalid.

Next: “MELON”
- M, E, L, O, N  
E is in position 2 – allowed.  
N is in position 5 – allowed (only position 2 was ruled out for N).  
M is in position 1 – allowed (only position 3 was ruled out for M).  
Letters used: M, E, L, O, N – none of which have been ruled out except O is new.  
This satisfies all constraints.

So the next guess is MELON.

From the three rounds of feedback:

   – M is in the word but not in position 1.  
   – N is in the word but not in positions 2 or 5.  
   – L is NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: E (fixed at pos 2), O (fixed at pos 4), M, N  
- Letters NOT in the word: R, A, I, S, U, T, L  
- Positions:
   – M cannot be in 1 or 3  
   – N cannot be in 2 or 5  
   – E is at 2, O is at 4  
   – Positions 1, 3, 5 remain to be filled with remaining letters.

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, P, V, W, Y  
Remaining vowels: none (A, I, O used, U ruled out)

We need a 5-letter word with pattern: _ E _ O _  
That must contain both M and N somewhere, with the above position restrictions.

Possible placements:
- M can be at 3 or 5 (but 3 is O’s spot), so M must be at 5.  
- N can be at 1 or 3 (but 3 is O’s spot), so N must be at 1.  
Thus the word must be N E _ O M.

Only letter left to fill is position 3.  
Available letters (not yet used and not ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, K, P, V, W, Y.

Looking for valid English words fitting N E _ O M:
- N E B O M → “NEBOM” – not valid  
- N E C O M → “NECOM” – not valid  
- N E D O M – not valid  
- N E G O M – not valid  
- N E P O M – not valid  
- N E V O M – not valid  
- N E W O M – not valid  
- N E C O M – not valid  
Wait – the only valid English word that fits N E _ O M is “N E C O M” → “NECOM” – but that’s not a word.

Hmm, let’s double-check:  
Actually, the valid word is “N E C O M” → “NECOM” – but it’s not recognized.  
Let me think of other possibilities.

Wait – perhaps I made a mistake in deducing M must be at 5.  
Let me re-examine:

From MELON feedback:
- M is in the word but not in position 1 (from M(-) in MELON).  
From earlier feedback:
- M is in the word but not in position 3 (from UNMET).  
Thus M cannot be in 1 or 3, so M must be in 2, 4, or 5.  
But position 2 is E, position 4 is O, so M must indeed be in 5.

Similarly for N:
From UNMET: N(-) – N not in position 2.  
From MELON: N(-) – N not in position 5.  
Thus N cannot be in 2 or 5, so N must be in 1 or 3.  
But position 3 is O in MELON feedback (O is in position 4, so position 3 is free).  
Thus N could be at 1 or 3.

Wait, in MELON, O is in position 4, so position 3 is free.  
Thus possible patterns:
- N E _ O M (N at 1, M at 5)  
- N E _ O _ (but M must be placed somewhere, and cannot be 1,3, so must be 5)  
Thus only possible pattern is N E _ O M.

But no valid word fits N E _ O M.  
Let me check again – perhaps I missed a word.

Actually, the valid word is “N E C O M” → “NECOM” – but it’s not a standard word.  
Wait – let me think differently: perhaps the word is “N E P O M” – but again not valid.

Let me re-examine the constraints more carefully.

We have:
- E at 2, O at 4.  
- Must include M and N.  
- M cannot be at 1 or 3, so M must be at 5.  
- N cannot be at 2 or 5, so N must be at 1 or 3.  
Position 3 is free, so N could be at 3.  
Thus the pattern could be _ E N O M or N E _ O M.

But _ E N O M would require M at 5, N at 3.  
Check if this is possible:  
Letters: _ E N O M – need a consonant at position 1.  
Valid word: “B” E N O M → “BENOM” – not valid.  
“C” E N O M → “CENOM” – not valid.  
“D” E N O M → “DENOM” – not valid.  
“G” E N O M → “GENOM” – not valid.  
“H” E N O M → “HENOM” – not valid.  
“K” E N O M → “KENOM” – not valid.  
“P” E N O M → “PENOM” – not valid.  
“V” E N O M → “VENOM” – this is valid!

Thus the word must be V E N O M.

Let me verify:
- V (new letter, not ruled out)  
- E (fixed at 2)  
- N (must be in word, allowed at 3)  
- O (fixed at 4)  
- M (must be in word, allowed at 5)  

This satisfies all constraints.
