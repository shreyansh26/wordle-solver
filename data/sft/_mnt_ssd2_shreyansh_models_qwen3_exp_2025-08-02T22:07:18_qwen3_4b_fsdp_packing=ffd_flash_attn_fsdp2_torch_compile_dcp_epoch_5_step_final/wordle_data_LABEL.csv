### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English

This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Valid options are 2 and 3.

Let's try L _ E A _:
- L _ E A _ : need a consonant in position 2 and 5.
Common consonants left: D, C, M, P, etc.
Let's pick D for position 2 and M for position 5: L D E A M. But ""ldeam"" is not a word.

Next, position 2 = A, position 4 = E: L A _ E _
Need a consonant in position 3 and 5.
Let's try L A M E D (L A M E D) - this is a valid word.

Check constraints:
- Starts with L (✓).
- Contains A (position 2) and E (position 4).
- A is not in position 3 (it's in 2) ✓.
- E is not in position 2 or 5 (it's in 4) ✓.
- Doesn't contain R, O, S, N, T ✓.

So ""LAMED"" seems to fit.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English

This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is not in position 1).
- R, O, S are NOT in the word.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (so E is not in position 5).

So the secret word:
- Contains A and E (but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively)
- Does NOT contain R, O, S

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has A and E somewhere (but A not in position 1, E not in position 5)
- Does not contain R, O, S

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: A, E (already know they're in), I, U

I'll try a word that places A and E in new positions and uses other common letters. ""TALKE"" comes to mind, but K is less common. ""LEANT"" is good but has N and T. ""PAINT"" is good but has I and N. ""PAEON"" is too obscure. ""TEAL"" is 4 letters. ""EATEN"" has E twice and N. ""LEANT"" is 5 letters, uses L, N, T. Let's go with ""LEANT"":
- L: new letter
- E: in position 2 (not 5)
- A: in position 3 (not 1)
- N: new letter
- T: new letter

This tests new consonants (L, N, T) while placing A and E in new positions.

From the new feedback on LEANT:

- L is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (so E is not in position 2).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is not in position 3).
- N and T are NOT in the word.

Summary of constraints so far:
- Word must start with L.
- Must contain A and E (but A not in position 3, E not in position 2 or 5).
- Cannot contain R, O, S, N, T.

Remaining common letters to try: D, C, M, P, I, U, etc.

I need a 5-letter word starting with L, containing A and E, with A not in position 3 and E not in position 2 or 5.

Possible positions:
- A could be in 2, 4, or 5.
- E could be in 1, 3, or 4 (but 1 is already L, so 3 or 4).

Let's try to place A and E in valid positions and pick other common consonants.

Option 1: L _ A _ E (but E would be in position 5, which is invalid).
Option 2: L _ E A _ (E in 3, A in 4).
Option 3: L A _ E _ (A in 2, E in 4).
Option 4: L A _ _ E (E in 5, invalid).

Valid options are 2 and 3.

Let's try L _ E A _:
- L _ E A _ : need a consonant in position 2 and 5.
Common consonants left: D, C, M, P, etc.
Let's pick D for position 2 and M for position 5: L D E A M. But ""ldeam"" is not a word.

Next, position 2 = A, position 4 = E: L A _ E _
Need a consonant in position 3 and 5.
Let's try L A M E D (L A M E D) - this is a valid word.

Check constraints:
- Starts with L (✓).
- Contains A (position 2) and E (position 4).
- A is not in position 3 (it's in 2) ✓.
- E is not in position 2 or 5 (it's in 4) ✓.
- Doesn't contain R, O, S, N, T ✓.

- L A V E K  (not a word)
- L A W E K  (not a word)

Looking again, the only common word that fits L A ? E ? with remaining letters is ""LABEL"", but position 5 would be L, which is already in position 1. This is allowed since letters can repeat, but ""LABEL"" is a valid word.

However, let's check if L is allowed to repeat. In Wordle, repeats are possible, so ""LABEL"" is valid.

But wait, let's see if there's another word. ""LARGE"" has R and G, but R is excluded. ""LARGE"" is invalid. ""LAYER"" has R and Y, both excluded. ""LANCE"" has N and C, both excluded. ""LAWED"" has W, D excluded. 

Actually, the only valid word left seems to be ""LABEL"", even though L repeats.

But let me double-check: are there any other words? ""LARGE"" - R excluded. ""LAYER"" - R and Y excluded. ""LANCE"" - N and C excluded. ""LAVED"" - D excluded. ""LAYER"" - already excluded. ""LAWED"" - D excluded. ""LAEIO"" - invalid. 

It appears ""LABEL"" is the only valid word left that fits the pattern and constraints.

But wait, let's think differently: position 3 could be B and position 5 could be L, making ""LABEL"". This is valid.

However, another word could be ""LAEPS"" but S is excluded. ""LAEON"" - N excluded. ""LAEUG"" - invalid. 

After careful consideration, ""LABEL"" seems to be the only valid word left that fits all constraints.

But let me check ""LAEIO"" - invalid. ""LAEPS"" - S excluded. ""LAEON"" - N excluded. ""LAEUG"" - invalid. 

Thus, the only valid word is ""LABEL"".

1. L A _ E _
2. Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, N, T, M, D, C, Y.

Remaining consonants for positions 3 and 5: B, F, G, H, K, V, W, etc.

Possible patterns: L A ? E ?

Valid English words fitting this pattern:
- L A B E L  (L already used in position 1)
- L A G E R  (R excluded)
