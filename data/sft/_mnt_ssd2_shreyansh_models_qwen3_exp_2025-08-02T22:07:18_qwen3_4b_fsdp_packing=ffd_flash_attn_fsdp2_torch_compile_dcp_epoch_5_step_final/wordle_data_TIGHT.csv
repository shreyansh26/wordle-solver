### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, U, I. A good starting word should use several of these letters. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L, A, T, E (all among the most frequent letters)

This gives us coverage of 5 different high-frequency letters, which should help us quickly identify which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, E are NOT in the word (x)
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-). In SLATE, T was in position 4, so it must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5 in the actual word.

Since S, L, A, E are out, we need a new set of common letters. The next most common letters after T are R, O, I, N, C, U, D, etc. A good second guess should include T (now in a different position) plus other high-frequency letters that weren’t used yet. 

Possible candidates: 
- ROUND (but O and U are common, D isn’t as high)
- CRUST (but S is already ruled out)
- TRUNK (but U, N, K are decent, but T is repeated)
- UNTIL (but L is out)
- CROAK (but A is out)
- RINSE (but S, E are out)

A balanced choice is ""ROUND"": it includes T (now in position 2), plus O, U, R, N – all high-frequency letters not yet ruled out. This should help determine the correct placement of T and test other common letters.

3. Avoid any letter already ruled out.

Positions we now know:
- H is in position 4 (fixed).  
- T is NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (because it was “-” in positions 1 and 4 respectively).  
  Therefore T must be in position 5.

Pick three new distinct letters that are common and haven’t been tried: let’s choose B, I, and K.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, U, I. A good starting word should use several of these letters. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L, A, T, E (all among the most frequent letters)

This gives us coverage of 5 different high-frequency letters, which should help us quickly identify which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, E are NOT in the word (x)
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-). In SLATE, T was in position 4, so it must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5 in the actual word.

Since S, L, A, E are out, we need a new set of common letters. The next most common letters after T are R, O, I, N, C, U, D, etc. A good second guess should include T (now in a different position) plus other high-frequency letters that weren’t used yet. 

Possible candidates: 
- ROUND (but O and U are common, D isn’t as high)
- CRUST (but S is already ruled out)
- TRUNK (but U, N, K are decent, but T is repeated)
- UNTIL (but L is out)
- CROAK (but A is out)
- RINSE (but S, E are out)

A balanced choice is ""ROUND"": it includes T (now in position 2), plus O, U, R, N – all high-frequency letters not yet ruled out. This should help determine the correct placement of T and test other common letters.

From the first two guesses we now know:

Letters definitely absent: S, L, A, E, R, O, U, N, D  
Only letter we know is present: T (from SLATE feedback “T(-)”)

Positions T occupied so far:
- In SLATE, T was in position 4 → so T is NOT in position 4.
- In ROUND, T wasn’t used at all → so T could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We still need to test common letters that haven’t appeared yet.  
High-frequency letters not yet tried and not yet ruled out: I, C, G, M, P, Y, K, H, B, F, W, V, etc.

A good third guess should:
1. Place T in a new spot (1, 2, 3, or 5)
2. Include several other high-frequency letters that haven’t been tested yet
3. Avoid any letter already ruled out.

A balanced word that meets these criteria is “ITCHY”:
- Places T in position 1 (new placement)
- Uses I, C, H, Y – all high-frequency letters not yet ruled out
- No letters from the already-excluded list.

This should give us more information about T’s correct position and test the new letters I, C, H, Y.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, U, I. A good starting word should use several of these letters. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L, A, T, E (all among the most frequent letters)

This gives us coverage of 5 different high-frequency letters, which should help us quickly identify which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, E are NOT in the word (x)
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-). In SLATE, T was in position 4, so it must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5 in the actual word.

Since S, L, A, E are out, we need a new set of common letters. The next most common letters after T are R, O, I, N, C, U, D, etc. A good second guess should include T (now in a different position) plus other high-frequency letters that weren’t used yet. 

Possible candidates: 
- ROUND (but O and U are common, D isn’t as high)
- CRUST (but S is already ruled out)
- TRUNK (but U, N, K are decent, but T is repeated)
- UNTIL (but L is out)
- CROAK (but A is out)
- RINSE (but S, E are out)

A balanced choice is ""ROUND"": it includes T (now in position 2), plus O, U, R, N – all high-frequency letters not yet ruled out. This should help determine the correct placement of T and test other common letters.

From the first two guesses we now know:

Letters definitely absent: S, L, A, E, R, O, U, N, D  
Only letter we know is present: T (from SLATE feedback “T(-)”)

Positions T occupied so far:
- In SLATE, T was in position 4 → so T is NOT in position 4.
- In ROUND, T wasn’t used at all → so T could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We still need to test common letters that haven’t appeared yet.  
High-frequency letters not yet tried and not yet ruled out: I, C, G, M, P, Y, K, H, B, F, W, V, etc.

A good third guess should:
1. Place T in a new spot (1, 2, 3, or 5)
2. Include several other high-frequency letters that haven’t been tested yet
3. Avoid any letter already ruled out.

A balanced word that meets these criteria is “ITCHY”:
- Places T in position 1 (new placement)
- Uses I, C, H, Y – all high-frequency letters not yet ruled out
- No letters from the already-excluded list.

This should give us more information about T’s correct position and test the new letters I, C, H, Y.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)
Guess 2: ROUND -> FEEDBACK: R(x) O(x) U(x) N(x) D(x)
Guess 3: ITCHY -> FEEDBACK: I(-) T(-) C(x) H(✓) Y(x)

From all feedback so far:

Letters ruled out:  
S, L, A, E, R, O, U, N, D, C, Y  

Letters we know are in the word:  
- T (from SLATE and ITCHY both showing “-” so it exists but is misplaced)  
- H (from ITCHY showing “✓” in position 4)

Positions we now know:
- H is in position 4 (fixed).  
- T is NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (because it was “-” in positions 1 and 4 respectively).  
  Therefore T must be in position 5.

So far the word looks like: _ _ _ H T

Remaining unused high-frequency letters not yet ruled out:  
B, F, G, I, K, M, P, V, W, etc.

We need two more distinct letters (not repeating H or T) from the allowed set to fill positions 1, 2, 3.  
Pick three new distinct letters that are common and haven’t been tried: let’s choose B, I, and K.

A valid 5-letter word using these plus the fixed H and T is “B I K H T” → “BIKHT” is not valid.  
Swap for a real word: “P I K H T” → “PIKHT” is not valid.  
Try “V I K H T” → “VIKHT” is not valid.  
Instead use “B I G H T” → “BIGHT” is archaic; “BIGHT” is valid.

“BIGHT”:
- B, I, G are new letters not yet ruled out or used.  
- Places T in position 5 (correct) and H in position 4 (correct).  

This is a valid guess that tests new letters while locking in the known positions.

From the feedback on BIGHT:

- B(x) → B is not in the word.
- I(✓) → I is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- G(✓) → G is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- H(✓) → H is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- T(✓) → T is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So the word structure is now fully determined: _ I G H T.

We only need to find the first letter.  
Letters already ruled out (from all previous guesses):  
S, L, A, E, R, O, U, N, D, C, Y, B.

Remaining common high-frequency letters not yet used:  
F, K, M, P, V, W, etc.

Possible valid 5-letter words ending in ""IGHT"":
- FI GHT → ""FIGHT"" (valid word)
- KI GHT → ""KIGHT"" (archaic, not standard)
- MI GHT → ""MIght"" (invalid)
- PI GHT → ""PIght"" (invalid)
- VI GHT → ""VIght"" (invalid)
- WI GHT → ""WIght"" (invalid)

The only standard word is ""FIGHT"".

Therefore, the secret word must be ""FIGHT"".
