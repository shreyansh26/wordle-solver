For my first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. A strong starting word often includes common letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, etc.

After considering common 5-letter words that cover these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice. It contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions, which should provide useful feedback for narrowing down future guesses.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A, R, S are NOT in the word (x).
- O and E are in the word, and each is in its correct position (✓ for the 3rd and 5th letters).

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ E
- Letters to avoid: A, R, S
- We still need to find the 1st, 2nd, and 4th letters.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and E are already used, and O is in place).

Let’s pick a word that:
1. Matches _ _ O _ E
2. Uses new letters not yet tested.
3. Uses common letters to maximize information.

Possible candidates: “POINT”, “CLOVE”, “MONEY”, “TOWNE”, etc.

“POINT” looks good because:
- P, I, N, T are all new letters.
- It tests common consonants P, N, T and the vowel I.

Let’s try “POINT”.

Let’s digest the new feedback:

1. From arose:  
   Pattern so far: _ _ O _ E  
   Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, S  
   (O and E are confirmed in their correct positions.)

2. From point:  
   - P, I, N, T are all marked x → none of them appear anywhere in the word.  
   - O is shown as “-” (in the word but wrong position).  
     This is interesting: we already knew O is somewhere in the word (from arose), but point placed O in position 2 while it belongs in position 3.  
     So the feedback simply re-affirms that O is present, but does not change the known pattern _ _ O _ E.

3. Letters still available:  
   - O and E are locked into positions 3 and 5.  
   - We must find the 1st and 2nd letters, and the 4th letter, avoiding A, R, S, P, I, N, T.

4. Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, V, W, Y, Z  
   Remaining vowels: U (only other common vowel left)

5. We need a word that:
   - Has O in position 3 and E in position 5.  
   - Uses only the available letters.  
   - Is a valid 5-letter English word.

Possible skeletons:  
- C O U E D → C O U E D (but that’s 5 letters: C O U E D → “coud” not a word)  
Wait, we need 5 letters, positions: 1 2 3 4 5 = _ _ O _ E

Let’s list possible letters for each slot:  
1: any unused consonant except P, I, N, T, A, R, S → B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, V, W, Y, Z  
2: same pool  
3: O (fixed)  
4: same pool  
5: E (fixed)

We need a common word that fits _ _ O _ E with only the allowed letters.

Examples:  
- B O U N E → B O U N E → “boune” not common  
- C O U L E → C O U L E → “coule” not a word  
- C O U V E → “covue” no  
- H O U N E → “horne” no  
- L O U D E → “loude” archaic spelling of “loud” but not standard  
- M O U N E → “moune” no

- C O U V E → no  
- C O U G E → “couge” no  
- C O U L E → no

- C O U L E → no  
- C O U N E → no  
- C O U G E → no  
- C O U F E → no  
- C O U D E → no  

I think I need to try ""COVFE"" but that’s not a word.

Let me try ""CLOVE"" → C L O V E → letters C, L, O, V, E.  
Check letters against banned list (A, R, S, P, I, N, T):  
C, L, V are allowed.  
So ""CLOVE"" is possible.

""CLOVE"" fits the pattern _ _ O _ E (C L O V E).

Let me verify:

- C (position 1) – allowed  
- L (position 2) – allowed  
- O (position 3) – correct  
- V (position 4) – allowed  
- E (position 5) – correct  

""CLOVE"" uses only allowed letters and matches the known pattern.

Therefore, I’ll guess ""CLOVE"".
</think>

Based on the feedback from arose (O and E confirmed in positions 3 and 5) and point (which only confirmed O is in the word, but not in position 2), I now know the pattern is _ _ O _ E and must avoid A, R, S, P, I, N, T. A valid word that fits this pattern and uses only allowed letters is ""CLOVE"".

<guess>clove</guess>",clove,"Let’s digest the new feedback:

1. From arose:  
   Pattern so far: _ _ O _ E  
   Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, S  
   (O and E are confirmed in their correct positions.)

2. From point:  
   - P, I, N, T are all marked x → none of them appear anywhere in the word.  
   - O is shown as “-” (in the word but wrong position).  
     This is interesting: we already knew O is somewhere in the word (from arose), but point placed O in position 2 while it belongs in position 3.  
     So the feedback simply re-affirms that O is present, but does not change the known pattern _ _ O _ E.

3. Letters still available:  
   - O and E are locked into positions 3 and 5.  
   - We must find the 1st and 2nd letters, and the 4th letter, avoiding A, R, S, P, I, N, T.

4. Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, V, W, Y, Z  
   Remaining vowels: U (only other common vowel left)

5. We need a word that:
   - Has O in position 3 and E in position 5.  
   - Uses only the available letters.  
   - Is a valid 5-letter English word.

Possible skeletons:  
- C O U E D → C O U E D (but that’s 5 letters: C O U E D → “coud” not a word)  
Wait, we need 5 letters, positions: 1 2 3 4 5 = _ _ O _ E

Let’s list possible letters for each slot:  
1: any unused consonant except P, I, N, T, A, R, S → B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, V, W, Y, Z  
2: same pool  
3: O (fixed)  
4: same pool  
5: E (fixed)

We need a common word that fits _ _ O _ E with only the allowed letters.

Examples:  
- B O U N E → B O U N E → “boune” not common  
- C O U L E → C O U L E → “coule” not a word  
- C O U V E → “covue” no  
- H O U N E → “horne” no  
- L O U D E → “loude” archaic spelling of “loud” but not standard  
- M O U N E → “moune” no  
- C O U E D → already considered  
- C O U V E → no  
- C O U G E → “couge” no  
- C O U L E → no  
- C O U N E → no  
- C O U F E → no  

Wait, let me think of actual common words with pattern _ _ O _ E:

- C O U V E → no  
- C O U L E → no  
- C O U N E → no  
- C O U G E → no  
- C O U F E → no  
- C O U D E → no

I need to find a valid 5-letter word that has O in position 3 and E in position 5, using only the letters not yet eliminated.

Let me list possible letters again:

Allowed letters (not in A, R, S, P, I, N, T):  
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need _ _ O _ E.

Possible words:

I’m realizing I need to systematically list possible words:

Possible letters for positions 1,2,4: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need _ _ O _ E.

Possible words:

I realize I’m stuck. Let me try a different approach: list actual words that have O in position 3 and E in position 5, and check the letters.

Actual words:

- C O U V E → no  
- C O U L E → no  
- C O U N E → no

- C O U D E → no  

I need to find a valid word. Let me think of ""COULD"" but that’s 5 letters: C O U L D → pattern C O U L D → no E.

Wait, let me list actual words:

Real 5-letter words with pattern _ _ O _ E:

- C O U L E → no  
- C O U N E → no  
- C O U G E → no  
- C O U F E → no

- C O U D E → no  

I think I need to try ""COVFE"" but that’s not a word.

Let me try ""CLOVE"" → C L O V E → letters C, L, O, V, E.  
Check letters against banned list (A, R, S, P, I, N, T):  
C, L, V are allowed.  
So ""CLOVE"" is possible.

""CLOVE"" fits the pattern _ _ O _ E (C L O V E).

Let me verify:

- C (position 1) – allowed  
- L (position 2) – allowed  
- O (position 3) – correct  
- V (position 4) – allowed  
- E (position 5) – correct  

""CLOVE"" uses only allowed letters and matches the known pattern.

Therefore, I’ll guess ""CLOVE"".Based on the feedback from arose (O and E confirmed in positions 3 and 5) and point (which only confirmed O is in the word, but not in position 2), I now know the pattern is _ _ O _ E and must avoid A, R, S, P, I, N, T. A valid word that fits this pattern and uses only allowed letters is ""CLOVE"".",Guess 3: clove -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) L(✓) O(✓) V(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
