1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains common letters like S, L, T (which appear in many words) and vowels A and E. This should give me good information about which letters might be in the secret word.

However, another strong option is ""AROSE"" since it contains all five of the most common letters in English words (A, R, O, S, E). This could potentially give me more immediate information about vowel positions.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers more of the high-frequency letters, including three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

- Letters to keep: A, E (both present but misplaced)

Good next guesses should:
1. Keep A and E in new positions

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: TALKE → T(✓) A(✓) L(x) K(-) E(-)

What we now know:
- T is in the correct position (first letter).
- A is in the correct position (second letter).
- L is not in the word.
- K is in the word but in the wrong position.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R, O, S are not in the word (from guess 1).

So the pattern so far is:
T A _ _ _

Letters to keep: A (fixed in 2nd), T (fixed in 1st), K (somewhere), E (somewhere)
Letters to avoid: R, O, S, L

We need three more letters, none of which are R, O, S, L. Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc. Vowels left: I, U (since A is already placed).

Let’s try to place K and E in new positions while introducing new common letters. A good candidate is ""TAKE_"". The only missing letter must be a new consonant or vowel not yet used. A simple choice is ""TAMER"", but M is new and E can be placed correctly, but we know E is misplaced, so we can't have E in 5th spot. Another option: ""TAWER"" – but W is okay, but E is still misplaced. Better: ""TAPIR"" – but P and I are new, but R is already excluded. 

Wait, simpler: ""TAPIE"" – but E is in 5th, which is wrong for E. 

Alternative: ""TAXED"" – but X is less common, D is new. 

Best seems ""TAKE_"" with a new letter. The only common letter left is N: ""TANKY"" – but Y is okay, but K is already present. 

Wait, we have T A _ _ _ and need to place K and E somewhere. Let's try ""TAWER"" – but W is okay, but E is still misplaced. 

Another approach: since E is misplaced, it can't be in 5th spot, so maybe ""T E _ _ _"" but T is 1st, A is 2nd, so E could be 3rd or 4th. Let's try ""T A E _ _"" but then K must fit. 

A good candidate is ""TAKE_"" but we need a 5th letter. The simplest is ""T A K E _"" but then E is 4th, K is 3rd – but we know K is misplaced (from TALKE, K was in 4th and marked ""-""). So K can't be in 4th, so ""T A K E _"" is invalid for K. 

Alternative: ""T A _ K E"" – but E is in 5th, which is wrong for E. 

We need K and E both in new positions. Let's try ""T A _ _ K"" with E in 3rd or 4th: ""T A E _ K"" – but then what's 4th letter? ""T A E N K"" – but N is new, but is ""TAENK"" a word? No. 

Another option: ""T A _ K E"" – but E is 5th, which is wrong. 

We need to place K and E in different positions. Let's try ""T A _ _ _"" with K in 3rd or 4th and E in 3rd or 4th, but not overlapping. 

A valid word: ""T A C E K"" – but C is new, K is 5th, E is 4th – but K was in 4th in TALKE and was marked ""-"", so K can't be in 4th, so this is invalid. 

Next: ""T A M E K"" – M is new, but same issue with K in 5th. 

Alternative: ""T A _ E K"" – but K in 5th is wrong. 

We need K in a new position and E in a new position. Let's try ""T A _ _ K"" with E in 3rd: ""T A E _ K"" – but 4th letter must be new, valid word: ""T A E N K"" – but not valid. 

Another candidate: ""T A B E K"" – but B is new, but ""TABEK"" isn't a word. 

Let's try ""T A _ K E"" – but E in 5th is wrong. 

We need to find a word that:
- Starts with T A
- Contains K and E in new positions
- Doesn't use R, O, S, L

A valid word: ""T A W E K"" – but W is okay, but ""TAWEK"" isn't valid. 

Better: ""T A P E K"" – ""TAP E K"" isn't a word. 

Next: ""T A M E D"" – but doesn't have K. 

Wait, we must include K and E. Let's try ""T A K E N"" – but N is new, and positions: K is 3rd (from TALKE, K was 4th, so 3rd is okay), E is 4th (from TALKE, E was 5th, so 4th is okay). And ""TAKEN"" is a valid word. 

Let's check:
- T is 1st (correct)
- A is 2nd (correct)
- K is 3rd (was 4th before, now new position)
- E is 4th (was 5th before, now new position)
- N is new letter

This seems valid.

Based on the feedback:
- T is fixed in position 1
- A is fixed in position 2
- K and E are in the word but misplaced
- Letters to avoid: R, O, S, L
