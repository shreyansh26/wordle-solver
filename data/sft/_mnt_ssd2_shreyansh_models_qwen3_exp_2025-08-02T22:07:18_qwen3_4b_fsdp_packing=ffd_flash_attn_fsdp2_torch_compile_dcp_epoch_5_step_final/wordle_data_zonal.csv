### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me a solid foundation to narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

From the two guesses we have:

What we now know:

1. The word does NOT contain R, S, E, D, M.
2. It DOES contain both A and O, but:
   - A is NOT in position 1.
   - O is NOT in position 3 or 4.
   - N is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So possible positions:
- A could be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- O could be in positions 1, 2, or 5 (since 3 and 4 are ruled out).
- N could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Letters still available (common ones): B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word that:
- Uses only the allowed letters.
- Places A and O in new positions.
- Introduces new consonants to test.

A good candidate is “COBAN”:
- C and B are new letters to test.
- A is in position 3 (new position for A).
- O is in position 2 (new position for O).
- N is in position 5, but we know N is not in position 5, so this is invalid.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E, D, M, C, G.
- Letters confirmed IN the word and in the correct positions:
  - O in position 2.
  - N in position 3.
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 5. Therefore A must be in position 4.
- Positions 1 and 5 are still open, and we have not tested B, F, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The word so far looks like: _ O N A _

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2.
- Has N in position 3.
- Has A in position 4.
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated (so no R, S, E, D, M, C, G).
- The first and fifth letters must be from the remaining letters.

Possible first letters (not yet ruled out): B, F, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Possible fifth letters (not yet ruled out): same list, but we can use the same letter twice unless it’s ruled out.

Let’s try to find a common word that fits this pattern. Trying first and fifth letters from the remaining common letters.

Some candidates:
- B O N A _ → BONAX, BONAY (not valid).
- F O N A _ → FONAS (invalid), FONAX (invalid).
- H O N A _ → HONAS (invalid), HONAX (invalid).
- T O N A _ → TONAL (invalid), TONAS (invalid), TONAK (invalid).

- W O N A _ → WONAS (invalid), WONAX (invalid).
- Y O N A _ → YONAS (invalid), YONAX (invalid).
- K O N A _ → KONAS (invalid), KONAX (invalid).

Hmm, none of these seem to be valid English words. Maybe I need to reconsider.

Wait, let’s list all possible 5-letter words with pattern _ O N A _:

Looking at a dictionary, valid words with O in 2nd, N in 3rd, A in 4th:
- BONAS (invalid, S is used and G,S,C,D,M,R,E ruled out)
- FONAS (invalid)
- HONAS (invalid)
- JONAS (invalid)
- LONAS (invalid)
- PONAS (invalid)
- SONAS (invalid, S is out)
- TONAS (invalid)
- VONAS (invalid)
- WONAS (invalid)
- YONAS (invalid)

This seems problematic. Maybe A is not in position 4 after all? Let me re-examine the feedback.

From CONGA → C(x) O(✓) N(✓) G(x) A(-)
- A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 5. It doesn’t necessarily mean it’s in position 4. It could be in position 2 or 3, but positions 2 and 3 are already taken by O and N respectively. Therefore A must be in position 4.

So the pattern _ O N A _ is correct.

Looking further, the only valid English word that fits _ O N A _ with the remaining letters seems to be:

- BONAS – but S is eliminated.
- FONAS – invalid.
- HONAS – invalid.
- JONAS – invalid.
- LONAS – invalid.
- PONAS – invalid.
- TONAL – L is allowed, but is it TONAL? Let’s check:
   TONAL: T O N A L – positions: T(1) O(2) N(3) A(4) L(5).
   Letters used: T, O, N, A, L.
   - T, L are not yet eliminated.
   - O, N, A positions are correct.
   - No eliminated letters (R,S,E,D,M,C,G not present).
   - This seems valid.

So TONAL is a valid word fitting all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess should be TONAL.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me a solid foundation to narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it can’t be in position 1).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (it can’t be in position 3).
- R, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and O somewhere (but not in positions 1, 3 respectively).
- Does NOT contain R, S, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses only letters not yet eliminated (so no R, S, E).
2. Uses A and O in different positions than before (A not in position 1, O not in position 3).
3. Possibly introduces new common letters to test.

A good candidate is “ADMON”:
- Uses A (not in position 1) and O (not in position 3).
- Introduces D, M, N — common consonants we haven’t tested yet.
- No R, S, E.

This should give us more information about the remaining letters and the correct placement of A and O.

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ADMON → A(-) D(x) M(x) O(-) N(-)

What we now know:

1. The word does NOT contain R, S, E, D, M.
2. It DOES contain both A and O, but:
   - A is NOT in position 1.
   - O is NOT in position 3 or 4.
   - N is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So possible positions:
- A could be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- O could be in positions 1, 2, or 5 (since 3 and 4 are ruled out).
- N could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Letters still available (common ones): B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word that:
- Uses only the allowed letters.
- Places A and O in new positions.
- Introduces new consonants to test.

A good candidate is “COBAN”:
- C and B are new letters to test.
- A is in position 3 (new position for A).
- O is in position 2 (new position for O).
- N is in position 5, but we know N is not in position 5, so this is invalid.

Next candidate: “PACON”
- P is new.
- A is in position 2 (new position for A).
- C is new.
- O is in position 3, but we know O cannot be in position 3. Invalid.

Next candidate: “CANON”
- C and N are in play, but O is in position 3 (invalid). Also N in position 5 is invalid.

Next candidate: “CONGA”
- C, G new.
- O in position 1 (valid).
- N in position 2 (valid).
- G new.
- A in position 5 (valid).

This seems good: uses new letters C, G; positions O1, N2, A5; no ruled-out letters.

So I’ll guess CONGA.

This seems problematic. Maybe A is not in position 4 after all? Let me re-examine the feedback.

- BONAS – but S is eliminated.
