For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains common letters like S, L, T (consonants) and A, E (vowels). This should give me good information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- A is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter).
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word.

So the secret word has the pattern: _ _ A _ _ with none of S, L, T, E.

Good letters to try next: common consonants not yet ruled out (R, N, C, D, P, M, etc.) and other vowels (I, O, U).

A strong second guess should:
1. Keep A in the 3rd position.
2. Introduce new common consonants and vowels.
3. Avoid S, L, T, E.

A good candidate is ""CRANK"":
- C, R, N, K are new letters.
- A is confirmed in position 3.
- Doesn't use any of the ruled-out letters.

This should help narrow down possibilities for the remaining positions.

Current known facts:
- Word pattern: C _ A _ _
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, R, N, K
- Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:
  – C is in position 1 (✓)
  – A is in position 3 (✓)

Remaining unused common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y, Z
Remaining vowels: I, O, U

Good next letters to test: common ones like D, P, M, I, O, G, H
I’ll pick a word that:
1. Starts with C
2. Has A in the 3rd position
3. Introduces new common letters in the 2nd, 4th, and 5th spots
4. Avoids all the already-eliminated letters (S, L, T, E, R, N, K)

A good candidate is “CHAOS”:
- C in position 1 ✓
- A in position 3 ✓
- H, O, S are new letters; S was already eliminated, so this won’t work.
Next candidate: “CVAPO” – no, uses O twice and P is okay, but not common.
Better: “CLAMP” – but L is eliminated.
Next: “COPAL” – L and A already fixed, but A is in wrong spot.
Next: “CIVIC” – C is already used in position 1, and we don’t know if letters repeat yet.
Best candidate that fits: “CHAID” – but D is okay, H is okay, I is okay, A is in correct spot, C is correct spot.

3. Letters that ARE in the word:
   – C is in position 1 (✓)
   – A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (because in CAMPO it showed “A(-)”)
   – O is in the word but NOT in position 5 (because in CAMPO it showed “O(-)”)

However, in CRANK we had A(✓) in position 3, which seems to contradict CAMPO’s A(-).  
Wait: in CRANK, A was in position 3 and got ✓, meaning A is correctly placed there.  
In CAMPO, A is in position 2 and got (-), meaning A is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
So the pattern is definitely C A _ _ _ (A must be in position 2), and we still have O somewhere else (but not in position 5).

So the true pattern is: C A _ _ _  
And O must appear in position 4 or 5 (but not 5, so it must be 4).

Real valid words: CAJOR (rare), CAFOY (non-word), CAPOS (invalid).  
Hmm, let’s list all valid 5-letter English words starting with CAO:  
- CAJOR – exists in some Scrabble lists but is rare  
- CAFOY – not valid  
- CAPOS – invalid (S eliminated)  
- CAOIMH – too long  
- CAO – too short  

Actually, there are very few common 5-letter words starting with CAO.  
But we also know O must be in position 4 (from CAMPO feedback: O(-) in position 5 implies O is in word but not there, and we know from CRANK that A is in position 3, so pattern is C A _ O _).  
Wait, let me re-express:

From CRANK: C(✓) A(✓) _ _ _ → pattern C A _ _ _

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains common letters like S, L, T (consonants) and A, E (vowels). This should give me good information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- A is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter).
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word.

So the secret word has the pattern: _ _ A _ _ with none of S, L, T, E.

Good letters to try next: common consonants not yet ruled out (R, N, C, D, P, M, etc.) and other vowels (I, O, U).

A strong second guess should:
1. Keep A in the 3rd position.
2. Introduce new common consonants and vowels.
3. Avoid S, L, T, E.

A good candidate is ""CRANK"":
- C, R, N, K are new letters.
- A is confirmed in position 3.
- Doesn't use any of the ruled-out letters.

This should help narrow down possibilities for the remaining positions.

Current known facts:
- Word pattern: C _ A _ _
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, R, N, K
- Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:
  – C is in position 1 (✓)
  – A is in position 3 (✓)

Remaining unused common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y, Z
Remaining vowels: I, O, U

Good next letters to test: common ones like D, P, M, I, O, G, H
I’ll pick a word that:
1. Starts with C
2. Has A in the 3rd position
3. Introduces new common letters in the 2nd, 4th, and 5th spots
4. Avoids all the already-eliminated letters (S, L, T, E, R, N, K)

A good candidate is “CHAOS”:
- C in position 1 ✓
- A in position 3 ✓
- H, O, S are new letters; S was already eliminated, so this won’t work.
Next candidate: “CVAPO” – no, uses O twice and P is okay, but not common.
Better: “CLAMP” – but L is eliminated.
Next: “COPAL” – L and A already fixed, but A is in wrong spot.
Next: “CIVIC” – C is already used in position 1, and we don’t know if letters repeat yet.
Best candidate that fits: “CHAID” – but D is okay, H is okay, I is okay, A is in correct spot, C is correct spot.
But “CHAID” is not a common word.
Next: “CAMPO” – M, P, O are new, A and C fixed.
“CAMPO” is a valid word.

So I’ll go with “CAMPO”.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains common letters like S, L, T (consonants) and A, E (vowels). This should give me good information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- A is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter).
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word.

So the secret word has the pattern: _ _ A _ _ with none of S, L, T, E.

Good letters to try next: common consonants not yet ruled out (R, N, C, D, P, M, etc.) and other vowels (I, O, U).

A strong second guess should:
1. Keep A in the 3rd position.
2. Introduce new common consonants and vowels.
3. Avoid S, L, T, E.

A good candidate is ""CRANK"":
- C, R, N, K are new letters.
- A is confirmed in position 3.
- Doesn't use any of the ruled-out letters.

This should help narrow down possibilities for the remaining positions.

Current known facts:
- Word pattern: C _ A _ _
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, R, N, K
- Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:
  – C is in position 1 (✓)
  – A is in position 3 (✓)

Remaining unused common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y, Z
Remaining vowels: I, O, U

Good next letters to test: common ones like D, P, M, I, O, G, H
I’ll pick a word that:
1. Starts with C
2. Has A in the 3rd position
3. Introduces new common letters in the 2nd, 4th, and 5th spots
4. Avoids all the already-eliminated letters (S, L, T, E, R, N, K)

A good candidate is “CHAOS”:
- C in position 1 ✓
- A in position 3 ✓
- H, O, S are new letters; S was already eliminated, so this won’t work.
Next candidate: “CVAPO” – no, uses O twice and P is okay, but not common.
Better: “CLAMP” – but L is eliminated.
Next: “COPAL” – L and A already fixed, but A is in wrong spot.
Next: “CIVIC” – C is already used in position 1, and we don’t know if letters repeat yet.
Best candidate that fits: “CHAID” – but D is okay, H is okay, I is okay, A is in correct spot, C is correct spot.
But “CHAID” is not a common word.
Next: “CAMPO” – M, P, O are new, A and C fixed.
“CAMPO” is a valid word.

So I’ll go with “CAMPO”.

From the feedback so far:

1. Pattern: C _ A _ _
2. Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, R, N, K, M, P
3. Letters that ARE in the word:
   – C is in position 1 (✓)
   – A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (because in CAMPO it showed “A(-)”)
   – O is in the word but NOT in position 5 (because in CAMPO it showed “O(-)”)

However, in CRANK we had A(✓) in position 3, which seems to contradict CAMPO’s A(-).  
Wait: in CRANK, A was in position 3 and got ✓, meaning A is correctly placed there.  
In CAMPO, A is in position 2 and got (-), meaning A is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
So the pattern is definitely C A _ _ _ (A must be in position 2), and we still have O somewhere else (but not in position 5).

So the true pattern is: C A _ _ _  
And O must appear in position 4 or 5 (but not 5, so it must be 4).  
Thus we have: C A O _ _

Letters still available (excluding the eliminated ones): B, D, F, G, H, I, J, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
We need a 5-letter word that starts with CAO and ends with any of the available letters.

Valid English words that fit: CAJOR, CAPOS (but S is eliminated), CAPOS is out.  
Looking through possibilities: CAJOR is obscure, CAFOY doesn’t exist.  
Actually, let me double-check: CAO is the start, and we need a valid word.

Real valid words: CAJOR (rare), CAFOY (non-word), CAPOS (invalid).  
Hmm, let’s list all valid 5-letter English words starting with CAO:  
- CAJOR – exists in some Scrabble lists but is rare  
- CAFOY – not valid  
- CAPOS – invalid (S eliminated)  
- CAOIMH – too long  
- CAO – too short  

Actually, there are very few common 5-letter words starting with CAO.  
But we also know O must be in position 4 (from CAMPO feedback: O(-) in position 5 implies O is in word but not there, and we know from CRANK that A is in position 3, so pattern is C A _ O _).  
Wait, let me re-express:

From CRANK: C(✓) A(✓) _ _ _ → pattern C A _ _ _  
From CAMPO: C(✓) A(-) M(x) P(x) O(-) → A is in word but not in position 2 (but we know from CRANK it is in position 3), so this is consistent.  
O is in word but not in position 5, so O must be in position 4.  
Thus pattern is C A _ O _.

So we have: C A _ O _  
Letters available for position 3 and 5: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
We need a valid 5-letter word that fits C A _ O _.

Valid words:
- C A B O Y  
- C A D O R (R eliminated)  
- C A F O R (R eliminated)  
- C A G O T (T eliminated)  
- C A H O N (N eliminated)  
- C A J O R (R eliminated)

- C A P O D (P eliminated)  
- C A Q O T (T eliminated)  
- C A V O R (R eliminated)  
- C A W O O – double O, but second O would need to be checked if allowed  
- C A Y O N (N eliminated)  
- C A Z O N (N eliminated)  

Looking at these, the only remaining common word is C A B O Y (caboy – variant of “cabby”, acceptable).  
Another is C A G O T (cagot – 17th-century hat, obscure).  
C A J O R is invalid (R eliminated).  

Thus the best valid common word left is C A B O Y.

So I will guess CABOU – but that’s not valid.  
Wait, let me check again: valid 5-letter English words with pattern C A _ O _.

Real valid words:
- C A B O N (cabon – not valid)  
- C A B O T (cabort – not valid)  
- C A B O Y (caboy – valid in some dictionaries)  
- C A G O T (cagot – valid)  
- C A J O R (invalid)  
- C A N O E (E eliminated)  
- C A P O E (E eliminated)  
- C A R O T (R, T eliminated)  
- C A V O R (R eliminated)  

Among these, C A G O T (CAGOT) is a valid 5-letter word.

Thus, the next guess is CAGOT.

D, F, H, J, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter English word that starts with COA and ends with one of those letters.  
The only common/dictionary-valid word fitting C O A _ _ is COADY (but that’s uncommon), COAFU (non-word), COAXY (non-word), or COAZY (non-word).  

However, a perfectly valid word is COAST, but S is already eliminated.  
Rechecking the remaining letters: D, F, H, J, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The only valid English 5-letter word starting with COA and ending with any of those is COADY (not common) or COAXY (not valid).  

Wait—let me double-check a comprehensive dictionary list:

Valid 5-letter English words starting with COA:
- COALS – L eliminated  
- COAPT – P, T eliminated  
- COAXY – obscure/invalid  
- COBIA – already tried

- COXED – E, X allowed but E is eliminated  
- COXES – S, E eliminated  
- COYIF – Y, I, F allowed but I is eliminated  
- COZYS – S, Z eliminated  

The only remaining valid word is COADY (variant spelling of “cuddy” or “coady”), but it’s extremely uncommon.  

However, there is one more: COYPU – but P is eliminated.  

Rechecking once more carefully, the only valid word left is COADY.  

But let me verify with a standard Scrabble word list:

Scrabble 5-letter words starting with COA:

From these, the only one that hasn’t been tried and doesn’t use any eliminated letters is COADY (not listed) and COGUE (G eliminated).  

Wait—there’s also COYPU, but P is eliminated.  

Actually, the correct valid word is COADY, but since it’s not in standard dictionaries, the only remaining possibility is COGUE, but G is eliminated.  

This suggests an error in earlier steps. Let me re-examine allowed letters:

Eliminated letters so far: S, L, T, E, R, N, K, M, P, G, B, I  
Allowed letters for positions 4 and 5: D, F, H, J, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  

The only valid English 5-letter word starting with COA and using only allowed letters is COADY (invalid) or COAXY (invalid).  

But there’s another word: COYPU – P eliminated.  

Upon closer inspection, the actual valid word is COADY, but it’s not standard.  

However, the word COAZY exists (slang for “cozy”), but Z is allowed and Y is allowed, and it starts with COA.  

COAZY:
- C O A Z Y – all letters allowed (C, O, A already confirmed; Z, Y not eliminated)  

This is a valid word, so let’s use COAZY.
