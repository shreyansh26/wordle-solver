For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good starting word typically includes common vowels and consonants. 

Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

Looking at these, I'll choose a word that includes several of these high-frequency letters. ""RAISE"" is a popular starting choice because it contains R, A, I, S, E - all very common letters. This should give me good information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

Instead, let's try a more common word: ""PLATE"" fits _ A I _ E (P, L, T are new letters). It also avoids R and S.

Another option could be ""GLADE"" but it has D instead of I in position 3, which we know is correct. So ""PLATE"" seems better.

From the two pieces of feedback we have:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(✓) I(✓) S(x) E(✓)
   - Word pattern: _ A I _ E
   - Letters NOT in the word: R, S

2. PLATE → P(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
   - E is still correctly placed at position 5 (✓)
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-)  
     This is interesting: the first feedback said A is in position 2 (✓), but now it’s marked “in the word but wrong position.”  
     This implies my interpretation of the first feedback was incorrect.  
     Let me re-read the first feedback carefully:

     RAISE → R(x) A(✓) I(✓) S(x) E(✓)
     The notation is:
     - ✓ means the letter is in the word and in the correct position.
     - – means the letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
     - x means the letter is NOT in the word.

     So for RAISE:
     - R: x → not in word
     - A: ✓ → in word, position 2 is correct
     - I: ✓ → in word, position 3 is correct
     - S: x → not in word
     - E: ✓ → in word, position 5 is correct

     Therefore the pattern is definitely _ A I _ E.

     Now the second guess PLATE:
     - P(x) → not in word
     - L(x) → not in word
     - A(-) → in word but wrong position. But this contradicts the first feedback which said A is in position 2.  
     Unless… I mis-read the feedback. Let me double-check:

     In feedback, the symbols are:
     - ✓ : letter is in word and in correct position
     - – : letter is in word but wrong position
     - x : letter not in word

     So for RAISE:
     - R: x → not in word
     - A: ✓ → in word, position 2 is correct
     - I: ✓ → in word, position 3 is correct
     - S: x → not in word
     - E: ✓ → in word, position 5 is correct

     Therefore the pattern is _ A I _ E.

     Now for PLATE:
     - P(x) → not in word
     - L(x) → not in word
     - A(-) → this should not happen if A is fixed in position 2.  
     The only way this can happen is if the feedback for PLATE is interpreted as:
     - P: x → not in word
     - L: x → not in word
     - A: – → in word but not in position 3 (but we know from RAISE it must be in position 2)
     - T: x → not in word
     - E: ✓ → in word, position 5 is correct

     This suggests that A is indeed in position 2 (from RAISE), but in PLATE, A is in position 3, hence the “–”.  
     So the pattern remains _ A I _ E, and we now know:
     - Letters NOT in the word: R, S, P, L, T
     - E is fixed in position 5
     - A and I are fixed in positions 2 and 3
     - So the word is _ A I _ E

     Now we need a 5-letter word that fits _ A I _ E and does not contain R, S, P, L, T.

     Common consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

     Let’s try to find common words fitting _ A I _ E:
     - B A I _ E → BAI_E → BAIKE (but K is sometimes a vowel sound)
     - C A I _ E → CAI_E → CAINE (valid but rare)
     - D A I _ E → DAINE (not a word)
     - F A I _ E → FAI_E → FAIRE (archaic)
     - G A I _ E → GAINE (not common)
     - H A I _ E → HAI_E → HAIER (not common)
     - M A I _ E → MAI_E → MAIZE (but Z is last, and we need _ A I _ E)
     - N A I _ E → NAIVE (N A I V E) → fits perfectly!

     ""NAIVE"" fits the pattern _ A I _ E (N A I V E), and none of its letters are in the forbidden list (R, S, P, L, T).

     Therefore, ""NAIVE"" is a good next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good starting word typically includes common vowels and consonants. 

Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

Looking at these, I'll choose a word that includes several of these high-frequency letters. ""RAISE"" is a popular starting choice because it contains R, A, I, S, E - all very common letters. This should give me good information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(✓) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → position 2
- I is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → position 3
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → position 5

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ A I _ E
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, S
- Letters still available: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

I need a 5-letter word that fits _ A I _ E and does not contain R or S. A good next guess should introduce new common consonants in positions 1 and 4. Common consonants not yet tried include T, N, L, C, M, D, etc.

Looking at common words fitting this pattern, ""CAINE"" is valid but rare. ""DAINE"" isn't a word. ""GAITE"" isn't common. ""PAINE"" isn't a word. ""TAINE"" isn't common. ""VAINE"" isn't a word.

Instead, let's try a more common word: ""PLATE"" fits _ A I _ E (P, L, T are new letters). It also avoids R and S.

Another option could be ""GLADE"" but it has D instead of I in position 3, which we know is correct. So ""PLATE"" seems better.

Final choice: PLATE

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(✓) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: PLATE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two pieces of feedback we have:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(✓) I(✓) S(x) E(✓)
   - Word pattern: _ A I _ E
   - Letters NOT in the word: R, S

2. PLATE → P(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
   - E is still correctly placed at position 5 (✓)
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-)  
     This is interesting: the first feedback said A is in position 2 (✓), but now it’s marked “in the word but wrong position.”  
     This implies my interpretation of the first feedback was incorrect.  
     Let me re-read the first feedback carefully:

     RAISE → R(x) A(✓) I(✓) S(x) E(✓)
     The notation is:
     - ✓ means the letter is in the word and in the correct position.
     - – means the letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
     - x means the letter is NOT in the word.

     So for RAISE:
     - R: x → not in word
     - A: ✓ → in word, position 2 is correct
     - I: ✓ → in word, position 3 is correct
     - S: x → not in word
     - E: ✓ → in word, position 5 is correct

     Therefore the pattern is definitely _ A I _ E.

     Now the second guess PLATE:
     - P(x) → not in word
     - L(x) → not in word
     - A(-) → in word but wrong position. But this contradicts the first feedback which said A is in position 2.  
     Unless… I mis-read the feedback. Let me double-check:

     In feedback, the symbols are:
     - ✓ : letter is in word and in correct position
     - – : letter is in word but wrong position
     - x : letter not in word

     So for RAISE:
     - R: x → not in word
     - A: ✓ → in word, position 2 is correct
     - I: ✓ → in word, position 3 is correct
     - S: x → not in word
     - E: ✓ → in word, position 5 is correct

     Therefore the pattern is _ A I _ E.

     Now for PLATE:
     - P(x) → not in word
     - L(x) → not in word
     - A(-) → this should not happen if A is fixed in position 2.  
     The only way this can happen is if the feedback for PLATE is interpreted as:
     - P: x → not in word
     - L: x → not in word
     - A: – → in word but not in position 3 (but we know from RAISE it must be in position 2)
     - T: x → not in word
     - E: ✓ → in word, position 5 is correct

     This suggests that A is indeed in position 2 (from RAISE), but in PLATE, A is in position 3, hence the “–”.  
     So the pattern remains _ A I _ E, and we now know:
     - Letters NOT in the word: R, S, P, L, T
     - E is fixed in position 5
     - A and I are fixed in positions 2 and 3
     - So the word is _ A I _ E

     Now we need a 5-letter word that fits _ A I _ E and does not contain R, S, P, L, T.

     Common consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

     Let’s try to find common words fitting _ A I _ E:
     - B A I _ E → BAI_E → BAIKE (but K is sometimes a vowel sound)
     - C A I _ E → CAI_E → CAINE (valid but rare)
     - D A I _ E → DAINE (not a word)
     - F A I _ E → FAI_E → FAIRE (archaic)
     - G A I _ E → GAINE (not common)
     - H A I _ E → HAI_E → HAIER (not common)
     - M A I _ E → MAI_E → MAIZE (but Z is last, and we need _ A I _ E)
     - N A I _ E → NAIVE (N A I V E) → fits perfectly!

     ""NAIVE"" fits the pattern _ A I _ E (N A I V E), and none of its letters are in the forbidden list (R, S, P, L, T).

     Therefore, ""NAIVE"" is a good next guess.

Let’s re-examine all the feedback carefully.

1. RAISE → R(x) A(✓) I(✓) S(x) E(✓)
   - Pattern: _ A I _ E
   - Letters NOT in word: R, S

2. PLATE → P(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
   - E is still ✓ at position 5.
   - A is marked “–” when it was in position 3, but we already know from RAISE that A is fixed in position 2.  
     Therefore, the feedback for PLATE must simply be confirming A is NOT in positions 1, 3, 4 (but we already know it’s in 2).  
   - Letters NOT in word: P, L, T (added to R, S)

3. NAIVE → N(x) A(✓) I(✓) V(✓) E(✓)
   - E, A, I are all confirmed in their positions.
   - V is now known to be in position 4.
   - Pattern: _ A I V E
   - Letters NOT in word: N (added to R, S, P, L, T)

So the secret word must be:
- 5 letters
- _ A I V E (positions 2-5 are A I V E)
- Cannot contain: R, S, P, L, T, N

We need a 5-letter word that ends in AIVE and doesn’t use any of those letters.  
The only common English word that fits is:

D A I V E → DAIVE (not a standard word)  
B A I V E → BAI V E (no)  
C A I V E → CAIVE (no)  
F A I V E → FAIVE (no)  
G A I V E → GAIVE (no)  
H A I V E → HAIVE (no)  
K A I V E → KAIVE (no)  
M A I V E → MAIVE (no)  
W A I V E → WAIVE (valid word!)

“WAIVE”:
- W is not forbidden by any previous feedback.
- Fits the pattern _ A I V E exactly.

Therefore, the next guess should be WAIVE.
