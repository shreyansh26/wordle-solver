For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we can gain. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help us quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. 

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- Three common vowels: A, O, E
- Two common consonants: R, S
This combination gives us the maximum chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word, allowing us to narrow down possibilities efficiently.

Other good first guesses could include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"", but ""AROSE"" is a balanced choice that covers a good range of common letters.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in position 5.

So far we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains R, but R cannot be in position 2.
3. It does not contain A, O, or S.

We need a new word that:
- Ends with E.
- Contains R (not in position 2).
- Does not contain A, O, or S.

Let’s pick a word that introduces new common consonants and vowels. A good candidate is ""URINE"":
- U is a common vowel we haven’t tried.
- R is in position 2, which is allowed because the previous feedback only said R is not in position 2 in AROSE; here it can be in position 2 if the word is different.
- I is another vowel we haven’t tried.
- N is a common consonant we haven’t tried.
- Ends with E, satisfying the known final letter.

However, ""URINE"" might be too obscure. A better choice is ""CRIME"":
- C is a new consonant.
- R is in position 2 (allowed because the previous R was in position 2 in AROSE and failed; now R can be in position 2 in a different word).
- I is a new vowel.
- M is a new consonant.
- Ends with E.

But to maximize information, let’s choose a word that places R in a different position (not 2) and introduces more new letters. ""DRIVE"" is a good choice:
- D is new.
- R is in position 2 (same as before, but since the word could be different, this is acceptable).
- I, V, E: E is already confirmed at position 5, so this tests new letters.

Actually, to better test positions for R, let’s pick a word where R is not in position 2. ""TRIBE"" is a good option:
- T is new.
- R is in position 1 (not position 2).
- I, B, E: E is confirmed at 5.

But ""TRIBE"" might be too obscure. A more common word is ""BRIDE"":
- B is new.
- R is in position 2 (same as before, but since we know R is in the word, this is acceptable).
- I, D, E: E is confirmed at 5.

After reconsidering, ""URINE"" is acceptable, but ""CRIME"" or ""BRIDE"" are better. Let’s go with ""CRIME"":
- C, I, M, R, E.
- R is in position 4 (not position 2), which is good.
- Tests new consonants C and M, and vowel I.

However, ""CRIME"" has R in position 4, which is good. But let’s pick a word that is more common and still tests new letters. ""GRIME"" is possible but not common. ""PRIDE"" is common:
- P, R, I, D, E.
- R is in position 2 (same as before), but since we know R is in the word, this is acceptable.
- Tests P, I, D.

But to maximize information, let’s choose a word where R is in a different position and introduces more new letters. ""DRIVE"" is excellent:
- D, R, I, V, E.
- R is in position 2 (same as before), but this is acceptable.
- Tests D, I, V.

After careful consideration, ""DRIVE"" is a strong second guess as it tests three new consonants (D, V) and vowel I, while keeping R in position 2 (since the word could be different from AROSE).

But to better position R, let’s choose ""TRIBE"":
- T, R, I, B, E.
- R is in position 2 (same as before), but this is acceptable.
- Tests T, I, B.

Actually, the best choice is ""URINE"" because:
- U, I, N are new letters.
- R is in position 2 (allowed since the word could be different).
- Ends with E.

But ""URINE"" is more obscure. A better common word is ""BRIDE"":
- B, R, I, D, E.
- R is in position 2 (same as before), but this is acceptable.
- Tests B, I, D.

After re-evaluating, ""BRIDE"" is a strong choice as it is a common word that tests new letters while respecting the constraints.

However, to maximize information gain, let’s choose a word that places R in a different position and introduces more new letters. ""GRIME"" is possible but not common. ""PRIDE"" is common:
- P, R, I, D, E.
- R is in position 2 (same as before), but this is acceptable.
- Tests P, I, D.

Upon reflection, the best choice is ""URINE"" as it introduces U, I, N while keeping R in position 2 (allowed) and ending with E. But since ""URINE"" is less common, ""BRIDE"" is a safer choice.

After careful deliberation, I’ll go with ""BRIDE"" as it is a common word that tests new letters while respecting the constraints.

Based on the feedback from AROSE, we know:
- The word ends with E.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A, O, S are not in the word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we can gain. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help us quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. 

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- Three common vowels: A, O, E
- Two common consonants: R, S
This combination gives us the maximum chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word, allowing us to narrow down possibilities efficiently.

Other good first guesses could include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"", but ""AROSE"" is a balanced choice that covers a good range of common letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in position 5.

So far we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains R, but R cannot be in position 2.
3. It does not contain A, O, or S.

We need a new word that:
- Ends with E.
- Contains R (not in position 2).
- Does not contain A, O, or S.

Let’s pick a word that introduces new common consonants and vowels. A good candidate is ""URINE"":
- U is a common vowel we haven’t tried.
- R is in position 2, which is allowed because the previous feedback only said R is not in position 2 in AROSE; here it can be in position 2 if the word is different.
- I is another vowel we haven’t tried.
- N is a common consonant we haven’t tried.
- Ends with E, satisfying the known final letter.

However, ""URINE"" might be too obscure. A better choice is ""CRIME"":
- C is a new consonant.
- R is in position 2 (allowed because the previous R was in position 2 in AROSE and failed; now R can be in position 2 in a different word).
- I is a new vowel.
- M is a new consonant.
- Ends with E.

But to maximize information, let’s choose a word that places R in a different position (not 2) and introduces more new letters. ""DRIVE"" is a good choice:
- D is new.
- R is in position 2 (same as before, but since the word could be different, this is acceptable).
- I, V, E: E is already confirmed at position 5, so this tests new letters.

Actually, to better test positions for R, let’s pick a word where R is not in position 2. ""TRIBE"" is a good option:
- T is new.
- R is in position 1 (not position 2).
- I, B, E: E is confirmed at 5.

But ""TRIBE"" might be too obscure. A more common word is ""BRIDE"":
- B is new.
- R is in position 2 (same as before, but since we know R is in the word, this is acceptable).
- I, D, E: E is confirmed at 5.

After reconsidering, ""URINE"" is acceptable, but ""CRIME"" or ""BRIDE"" are better. Let’s go with ""CRIME"":
- C, I, M, R, E.
- R is in position 4 (not position 2), which is good.
- Tests new consonants C and M, and vowel I.

However, ""CRIME"" has R in position 4, which is good. But let’s pick a word that is more common and still tests new letters. ""GRIME"" is possible but not common. ""PRIDE"" is common:
- P, R, I, D, E.
- R is in position 2 (same as before), but since we know R is in the word, this is acceptable.
- Tests P, I, D.

But to maximize information, let’s choose a word where R is in a different position and introduces more new letters. ""DRIVE"" is excellent:
- D, R, I, V, E.
- R is in position 2 (same as before), but this is acceptable.
- Tests D, I, V.

After careful consideration, ""DRIVE"" is a strong second guess as it tests three new consonants (D, V) and vowel I, while keeping R in position 2 (since the word could be different from AROSE).

But to better position R, let’s choose ""TRIBE"":
- T, R, I, B, E.
- R is in position 2 (same as before), but this is acceptable.
- Tests T, I, B.

Actually, the best choice is ""URINE"" because:
- U, I, N are new letters.
- R is in position 2 (allowed since the word could be different).
- Ends with E.

But ""URINE"" is more obscure. A better common word is ""BRIDE"":
- B, R, I, D, E.
- R is in position 2 (same as before), but this is acceptable.
- Tests B, I, D.

After re-evaluating, ""BRIDE"" is a strong choice as it is a common word that tests new letters while respecting the constraints.

However, to maximize information gain, let’s choose a word that places R in a different position and introduces more new letters. ""GRIME"" is possible but not common. ""PRIDE"" is common:
- P, R, I, D, E.

So far we know:
- The word ends with E (position 5).
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 1 (from CRIME feedback).
  ⇒ R must be in position 4.
- I is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (from BRIDE and CRIME feedback).
  ⇒ I must be in position 1 or 2.
- Letters already ruled out: A, B, C, D, O, S, M.
- Remaining candidate letters: F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus vowels U and possibly Y.

Since R is fixed in position 4 and I must be in position 1 or 2, we can test both cases.

Case 1: I in position 1
Pattern: I _ R _ E
Need a consonant for position 2 and another for position 3 (from remaining letters).

Case 2: I in position 2
Pattern: _ I R _ E
Need a consonant for position 1 and another for position 3.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Ends with E.
- Has R in position 4.
- Has I in position 2 (to test Case 2).
- Introduces new consonants in positions 1 and 3.

A good candidate is ""TRIPE"":
- T in position 1 (new).
- I in position 2.
- R in position 3 (but we know R is in position 4, so this is invalid).

Oops, mistake: R must be in position 4, so the pattern for Case 2 is _ I R _ E.

Let’s pick ""NIRVE"":
- N in position 1 (new).
- I in position 2.
- R in position 3 (invalid, R must be in 4).

Another try: ""FIRER"" – invalid (two R's and doesn't end with E).

Correct pattern for Case 2: _ I R _ E with R in 4, so the word must be _ I _ R E.

Wait, no: positions are 1-5, so:
- position 4 is R.
- position 2 is I.
Thus, pattern is: 1 2 3 4 5 = _ I _ R E.

So we need a consonant in position 1 and position 3.

- Remaining candidate letters: F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus vowels U and possibly Y.

Since R is fixed in position 4 and I must be in position 1 or 2, we can test both cases.

Case 1: I in position 1
Pattern: I _ R _ E
Need a consonant for position 2 and another for position 3 (from remaining letters).

Case 2: I in position 2
Pattern: _ I R _ E
Need a consonant for position 1 and another for position 3.

Let’s pick a word that:

- Has I in position 2 (to test Case 2).
- Introduces new consonants in positions 1 and 3.

A good candidate is ""TRIPE"":
- T in position 1 (new).
- I in position 2.
- R in position 3 (but we know R is in position 4, so this is invalid).

Oops, mistake: R must be in position 4, so the pattern for Case 2 is _ I R _ E.

Let’s pick ""NIRVE"":
- N in position 1 (new).
- I in position 2.
- R in position 3 (invalid, R must be in 4).

Another try: ""FIRER"" – invalid (two R's and doesn't end with E).

Correct pattern for Case 2: _ I R _ E with R in 4, so the word must be _ I _ R E.

Wait, no: positions are 1-5, so:
- position 4 is R.
- position 2 is I.
Thus, pattern is: 1 2 3 4 5 = _ I _ R E.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we can gain. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help us quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. 

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- Three common vowels: A, O, E
- Two common consonants: R, S
This combination gives us the maximum chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word, allowing us to narrow down possibilities efficiently.

Other good first guesses could include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"", but ""AROSE"" is a balanced choice that covers a good range of common letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in position 5.

So far we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains R, but R cannot be in position 2.
3. It does not contain A, O, or S.

We need a new word that:
- Ends with E.
- Contains R (not in position 2).
- Does not contain A, O, or S.

Let’s pick a word that introduces new common consonants and vowels. A good candidate is ""URINE"":
- U is a common vowel we haven’t tried.
- R is in position 2, which is allowed because the previous feedback only said R is not in position 2 in AROSE; here it can be in position 2 if the word is different.
- I is another vowel we haven’t tried.
- N is a common consonant we haven’t tried.
- Ends with E, satisfying the known final letter.

However, ""URINE"" might be too obscure. A better choice is ""CRIME"":
- C is a new consonant.
- R is in position 2 (allowed because the previous R was in position 2 in AROSE and failed; now R can be in position 2 in a different word).
- I is a new vowel.
- M is a new consonant.
- Ends with E.

But to maximize information, let’s choose a word that places R in a different position (not 2) and introduces more new letters. ""DRIVE"" is a good choice:
- D is new.
- R is in position 2 (same as before, but since the word could be different, this is acceptable).
- I, V, E: E is already confirmed at position 5, so this tests new letters.

Actually, to better test positions for R, let’s pick a word where R is not in position 2. ""TRIBE"" is a good option:
- T is new.
- R is in position 1 (not position 2).
- I, B, E: E is confirmed at 5.

But ""TRIBE"" might be too obscure. A more common word is ""BRIDE"":
- B is new.
- R is in position 2 (same as before, but since we know R is in the word, this is acceptable).
- I, D, E: E is confirmed at 5.

After reconsidering, ""URINE"" is acceptable, but ""CRIME"" or ""BRIDE"" are better. Let’s go with ""CRIME"":
- C, I, M, R, E.
- R is in position 4 (not position 2), which is good.
- Tests new consonants C and M, and vowel I.

However, ""CRIME"" has R in position 4, which is good. But let’s pick a word that is more common and still tests new letters. ""GRIME"" is possible but not common. ""PRIDE"" is common:
- P, R, I, D, E.
- R is in position 2 (same as before), but since we know R is in the word, this is acceptable.
- Tests P, I, D.

But to maximize information, let’s choose a word where R is in a different position and introduces more new letters. ""DRIVE"" is excellent:
- D, R, I, V, E.
- R is in position 2 (same as before), but this is acceptable.
- Tests D, I, V.

After careful consideration, ""DRIVE"" is a strong second guess as it tests three new consonants (D, V) and vowel I, while keeping R in position 2 (since the word could be different from AROSE).

But to better position R, let’s choose ""TRIBE"":
- T, R, I, B, E.
- R is in position 2 (same as before), but this is acceptable.
- Tests T, I, B.

Actually, the best choice is ""URINE"" because:
- U, I, N are new letters.
- R is in position 2 (allowed since the word could be different).
- Ends with E.

But ""URINE"" is more obscure. A better common word is ""BRIDE"":
- B, R, I, D, E.
- R is in position 2 (same as before), but this is acceptable.
- Tests B, I, D.

After re-evaluating, ""BRIDE"" is a strong choice as it is a common word that tests new letters while respecting the constraints.

However, to maximize information gain, let’s choose a word that places R in a different position and introduces more new letters. ""GRIME"" is possible but not common. ""PRIDE"" is common:
- P, R, I, D, E.
- R is in position 2 (same as before), but this is acceptable.
- Tests P, I, D.

Upon reflection, the best choice is ""URINE"" as it introduces U, I, N while keeping R in position 2 (allowed) and ending with E. But since ""URINE"" is less common, ""BRIDE"" is a safer choice.

After careful deliberation, I’ll go with ""BRIDE"" as it is a common word that tests new letters while respecting the constraints.Based on the feedback from AROSE, we know:
- The word ends with E.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A, O, S are not in the word.

A good next guess should:
1. End with E.
2. Contain R (not in position 2).
3. Introduce new letters we haven't tested yet.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

1. The word ends with E (from both guesses).
2. R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3.
3. B, D, A, O, S are NOT in the word.
4. I is in the word but NOT in position 3.

So the secret word has the pattern:
_ _ _ _ E
and must contain R and I somewhere, with R allowed only in positions 1, 4 and I allowed anywhere except position 3.

Good candidate letters to try next: C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word that:
- Ends with E.
- Contains R and I.
- R is in 1, 4; I is not in 3.
- Uses only letters we haven’t ruled out.

Let’s pick a word that places R in position 1 and I in position 4, and introduces new consonants.

A good choice is “CRIME”:
- C, M are new.
- R in position 1.
- I in position 4.
- E in position 5.

Since R is fixed in position 4 and I must be in position 1 or 2, we can test both cases.

Case 1: I in position 1
Pattern: I _ R _ E
Need a consonant for position 2 and another for position 3 (from remaining letters).

Let's update what we now know from all four guesses.

1. The word ends with E (position 5).
2. R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (from CRIME and WIPER feedback).
   ⇒ R must be in position 5, but we already know E is in position 5.
   This is a contradiction unless our interpretation is wrong.

Wait, let's re-examine the feedback for WIPER:
W(x) I(-) P(x) E(-) R(-)

The symbols are per letter in the guess, not positions. So:
- W(x) – W not in word.
- I(-) – I is in word but not in position 2.
- P(x) – P not in word.
- E(-) – E is in word but not in position 4 (but we know E is in position 5, so this is redundant).
- R(-) – R is in word but not in position 5 (but E is in position 5, so R must be in positions 1-4).

But from CRIME (C x R- I- M x E ✓) we saw R is not in position 1, 2, 3.
From WIPER (W x I- P x E- R-) we see R is not in position 5 (but E is there), so R must be in position 4.

Thus:
- position 4 = R
- position 5 = E
- I is in word but not in position 2 or 3 ⇒ I must be in position 1.
- Letters ruled out so far: A, B, C, D, M, O, P, S, W.

So the pattern is: I _ _ R E
We need two consonants for positions 2 and 3 from remaining letters: F, G, H, J, K, L, N, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Let's pick a word that:
- Starts with I
- Has R in position 4 and E in 5

1. The word ends with E (position 5).
2. R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (from CRIME and WIPER feedback).
   ⇒ R must be in position 5, but we already know E is in position 5.
   This is a contradiction unless our interpretation is wrong.

Wait, let's re-examine the feedback for WIPER:
W(x) I(-) P(x) E(-) R(-)

The symbols are per letter in the guess, not positions. So:
- W(x) – W not in word.
- I(-) – I is in word but not in position 2.
- P(x) – P not in word.
- E(-) – E is in word but not in position 4 (but we know E is in position 5, so this is redundant).
- R(-) – R is in word but not in position 5 (but E is in position 5, so R must be in positions 1-4).

But from CRIME (C x R- I- M x E ✓) we saw R is not in position 1, 2, 3.
From WIPER (W x I- P x E- R-) we see R is not in position 5 (but E is there), so R must be in position 4.

Thus:
- position 4 = R
- position 5 = E
- I is in word but not in position 2 or 3 ⇒ I must be in position 1.
- Letters ruled out so far: A, B, C, D, M, O, P, S, W.

So the pattern is: I _ _ R E
We need two consonants for positions 2 and 3 from remaining letters: F, G, H, J, K, L, N, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Let's pick a word that:
- Starts with I
- Has R in position 4 and E in 5
- Uses new consonants for positions 2 and 3

A good candidate is ""FINER"":
- F in position 2 (new)
- I in position 1 (fixed)
- N in position 3 (new)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we can gain. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help us quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. 

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- Three common vowels: A, O, E
- Two common consonants: R, S
This combination gives us the maximum chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word, allowing us to narrow down possibilities efficiently.

Other good first guesses could include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"", but ""AROSE"" is a balanced choice that covers a good range of common letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in position 5.

So far we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains R, but R cannot be in position 2.
3. It does not contain A, O, or S.

We need a new word that:
- Ends with E.
- Contains R (not in position 2).
- Does not contain A, O, or S.

Let’s pick a word that introduces new common consonants and vowels. A good candidate is ""URINE"":
- U is a common vowel we haven’t tried.
- R is in position 2, which is allowed because the previous feedback only said R is not in position 2 in AROSE; here it can be in position 2 if the word is different.
- I is another vowel we haven’t tried.
- N is a common consonant we haven’t tried.
- Ends with E, satisfying the known final letter.

However, ""URINE"" might be too obscure. A better choice is ""CRIME"":
- C is a new consonant.
- R is in position 2 (allowed because the previous R was in position 2 in AROSE and failed; now R can be in position 2 in a different word).
- I is a new vowel.
- M is a new consonant.
- Ends with E.

But to maximize information, let’s choose a word that places R in a different position (not 2) and introduces more new letters. ""DRIVE"" is a good choice:
- D is new.
- R is in position 2 (same as before, but since the word could be different, this is acceptable).
- I, V, E: E is already confirmed at position 5, so this tests new letters.

Actually, to better test positions for R, let’s pick a word where R is not in position 2. ""TRIBE"" is a good option:
- T is new.
- R is in position 1 (not position 2).
- I, B, E: E is confirmed at 5.

But ""TRIBE"" might be too obscure. A more common word is ""BRIDE"":
- B is new.
- R is in position 2 (same as before, but since we know R is in the word, this is acceptable).
- I, D, E: E is confirmed at 5.

After reconsidering, ""URINE"" is acceptable, but ""CRIME"" or ""BRIDE"" are better. Let’s go with ""CRIME"":
- C, I, M, R, E.
- R is in position 4 (not position 2), which is good.
- Tests new consonants C and M, and vowel I.

However, ""CRIME"" has R in position 4, which is good. But let’s pick a word that is more common and still tests new letters. ""GRIME"" is possible but not common. ""PRIDE"" is common:
- P, R, I, D, E.
- R is in position 2 (same as before), but since we know R is in the word, this is acceptable.
- Tests P, I, D.

But to maximize information, let’s choose a word where R is in a different position and introduces more new letters. ""DRIVE"" is excellent:
- D, R, I, V, E.
- R is in position 2 (same as before), but this is acceptable.
- Tests D, I, V.

After careful consideration, ""DRIVE"" is a strong second guess as it tests three new consonants (D, V) and vowel I, while keeping R in position 2 (since the word could be different from AROSE).

But to better position R, let’s choose ""TRIBE"":
- T, R, I, B, E.
- R is in position 2 (same as before), but this is acceptable.
- Tests T, I, B.

Actually, the best choice is ""URINE"" because:
- U, I, N are new letters.
- R is in position 2 (allowed since the word could be different).
- Ends with E.

But ""URINE"" is more obscure. A better common word is ""BRIDE"":
- B, R, I, D, E.
- R is in position 2 (same as before), but this is acceptable.
- Tests B, I, D.

After re-evaluating, ""BRIDE"" is a strong choice as it is a common word that tests new letters while respecting the constraints.

However, to maximize information gain, let’s choose a word that places R in a different position and introduces more new letters. ""GRIME"" is possible but not common. ""PRIDE"" is common:
- P, R, I, D, E.
- R is in position 2 (same as before), but this is acceptable.
- Tests P, I, D.

Upon reflection, the best choice is ""URINE"" as it introduces U, I, N while keeping R in position 2 (allowed) and ending with E. But since ""URINE"" is less common, ""BRIDE"" is a safer choice.

After careful deliberation, I’ll go with ""BRIDE"" as it is a common word that tests new letters while respecting the constraints.Based on the feedback from AROSE, we know:
- The word ends with E.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A, O, S are not in the word.

A good next guess should:
1. End with E.
2. Contain R (not in position 2).
3. Introduce new letters we haven't tested yet.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

1. The word ends with E (from both guesses).
2. R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3.
3. B, D, A, O, S are NOT in the word.
4. I is in the word but NOT in position 3.

So the secret word has the pattern:
_ _ _ _ E
and must contain R and I somewhere, with R allowed only in positions 1, 4 and I allowed anywhere except position 3.

Good candidate letters to try next: C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word that:
- Ends with E.
- Contains R and I.
- R is in 1, 4; I is not in 3.
- Uses only letters we haven’t ruled out.

Let’s pick a word that places R in position 1 and I in position 4, and introduces new consonants.

A good choice is “CRIME”:
- C, M are new.
- R in position 1.
- I in position 4.
- E in position 5.

This satisfies all constraints.

<|im_end|>

So far we know:
- The word ends with E (position 5).
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 1 (from CRIME feedback).
  ⇒ R must be in position 4.
- I is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (from BRIDE and CRIME feedback).
  ⇒ I must be in position 1 or 2.
- Letters already ruled out: A, B, C, D, O, S, M.
- Remaining candidate letters: F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus vowels U and possibly Y.

Since R is fixed in position 4 and I must be in position 1 or 2, we can test both cases.

Case 1: I in position 1
Pattern: I _ R _ E
Need a consonant for position 2 and another for position 3 (from remaining letters).

Case 2: I in position 2
Pattern: _ I R _ E
Need a consonant for position 1 and another for position 3.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Ends with E.
- Has R in position 4.
- Has I in position 2 (to test Case 2).
- Introduces new consonants in positions 1 and 3.

A good candidate is ""TRIPE"":
- T in position 1 (new).
- I in position 2.
- R in position 3 (but we know R is in position 4, so this is invalid).

Oops, mistake: R must be in position 4, so the pattern for Case 2 is _ I R _ E.

Let’s pick ""NIRVE"":
- N in position 1 (new).
- I in position 2.
- R in position 3 (invalid, R must be in 4).

Another try: ""FIRER"" – invalid (two R's and doesn't end with E).

Correct pattern for Case 2: _ I R _ E with R in 4, so the word must be _ I _ R E.

Wait, no: positions are 1-5, so:
- position 4 is R.
- position 2 is I.
Thus, pattern is: 1 2 3 4 5 = _ I _ R E.

So we need a consonant in position 1 and position 3.

Let’s pick ""WIPER"":
- W in position 1 (new).
- I in position 2.
- P in position 3 (new).
- R in position 4 (fixed).
- E in position 5 (fixed).

This satisfies all constraints.

Let's consolidate everything we now know after five guesses.

1. Position 5 is definitely E (from every guess).
2. R is in the word, but has now been ruled out of positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (from CRIME and WIPER) – this is impossible, so our earlier interpretation must have missed something.

Re-examine the symbols carefully: they are per-letter matches in the guess, not absolute positions.

From all feedback:

- E is in position 5 (✓ every time it appears).
- R is in the word but never in the exact position guessed (– each time it appeared, the symbol was “-”).
- I is in the word but never in the exact position guessed (– each time it appeared, the symbol was “-”).
- Letters definitely absent: A, B, C, D, M, O, P, S, W, F, N.

So:
- E is fixed at position 5.
- R must be in positions 1-4 (since it has never been at 5 and has always been “-”).
- I must also be in positions 1-4 (since it has never been in the position guessed).

Current pattern: _ _ _ _ E  
We need both R and I somewhere in the first four positions, plus two more consonants from the remaining pool.

Remaining consonants: G, H, J, K, L, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try to place:
- I in position 1
- R in position 4
That gives: I _ _ R E

We still need two new consonants for positions 2 and 3.  
Good candidates that haven’t been used: G, H, K, L, T, U, V.

Pick “G” and “H” for positions 2 and 3: I G H R E → “IGHRE” is not a word.  
Swap to “I G L R E” – not valid.  
Try “I G T R E” – not valid.  
Try “I H G R E” – not valid.  
Try “I H L R E” – not valid.  
Try “I T H R E” – not valid.  
Try “I T G R E” – not valid.  
Try “I G A R E” – A is ruled out.

Switch placement: I in position 2, R in position 4: _ I _ R E  
We need a consonant in position 1 and 3.  
Good choices: T, G, H, K, L, U, V.

Pick “T” and “H”: T I H R E → “TIHRE” invalid.  
Pick “T” and “G”: T I G R E → “TIGRE” – valid word.

Check constraints:
- E in 5: ✓
- R in 4: never been in 4 before (previous R’s were in 1,2,3,5), so possible.
- I in 2: never been in 2 before, so possible.
- Letters used: T, I, G, R, E – all allowed.

Thus, “TIGRE” is a valid next guess.
