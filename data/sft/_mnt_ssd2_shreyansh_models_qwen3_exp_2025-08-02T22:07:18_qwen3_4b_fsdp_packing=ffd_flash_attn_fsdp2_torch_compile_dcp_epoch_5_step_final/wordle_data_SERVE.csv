### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The classic starting word ""SLATE"" is popular for this reason, as it covers common consonants (S, L, T) and vowels (A, E). However, another strong choice is ""AROSE"" which contains all five of the most common letters in English words (A, R, O, S, E). 

Between these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it has a better letter frequency distribution according to Wordle analysis, giving me a higher chance of hitting at least one correct letter early on.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- E is in the word and is in position 5 (✓)

- The word ends with E.
- It contains R and S somewhere, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.
- It does not contain A or O.

Hmm, many words end with E but have R in position 2. Let me think differently - maybe R is not in position 2, so positions 1,3,4,5 are possible. Similarly, S is not in position 4, so positions 1,2,3,5 are possible. 

Let me try ""STEER"" - S in position 1, T new, E in 3, E in 4, R in 5. Contains S and R, ends with E, no A/O. R is in position 5, S in position 1 - both allowed. 

""STEER"" seems valid. 

Check:
- Ends with E: yes.
- Contains R and S: yes.
- No A or O: correct.
- R not in position 2: correct (it's in 5).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The classic starting word ""SLATE"" is popular for this reason, as it covers common consonants (S, L, T) and vowels (A, E). However, another strong choice is ""AROSE"" which contains all five of the most common letters in English words (A, R, O, S, E). 

Between these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it has a better letter frequency distribution according to Wordle analysis, giving me a higher chance of hitting at least one correct letter early on.

- The word ends with E.
- It contains R and S somewhere, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.
- It does not contain A or O.

1. Ends with E.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The classic starting word ""SLATE"" is popular for this reason, as it covers common consonants (S, L, T) and vowels (A, E). However, another strong choice is ""AROSE"" which contains all five of the most common letters in English words (A, R, O, S, E). 

Between these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it has a better letter frequency distribution according to Wordle analysis, giving me a higher chance of hitting at least one correct letter early on.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- E is in the word and is in position 5 (✓)

So we know:
- The word ends with E.
- It contains R and S somewhere, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.
- It does not contain A or O.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Contains R and S.
3. Does not contain A or O.
4. R is not in position 2.
5. S is not in position 4.

Possible candidates: TREND, CRISP, DRIPS, GRIST, PRISM, TRUST, etc.

Let me pick one that uses the known letters efficiently and tests new ones. ""CRISP"" uses C, R, I, S, P - but S is in position 4 which is disallowed. ""DRIPS"" has S in position 4 - also disallowed. ""GRIST"" has S in position 4 - disallowed. ""PRISM"" has S in position 4 - disallowed. ""TREND"" has R in position 2 - disallowed.

""CRUST"" ends with T, not E. ""BRISK"" ends with K. ""FRISK"" ends with K. ""DRUSE"" ends with E, has R and S, no A/O. Let's check: D R U S E. R is in position 2 - disallowed.

""CRUSE"" - R in position 2 - disallowed. ""GRATE"" has A - no good. ""PRUNE"" has O in position 3? No, U is there. P R U N E - R in position 2 - disallowed.

""GRIME"" - ends with E, but R in position 2 - disallowed. 

""CRIME"" - ends with E, but R in position 2 - disallowed. 

""BRIME"" - ends with E, but R in position 2 - disallowed. 

Hmm, many words end with E but have R in position 2. Let me think differently - maybe R is not in position 2, so positions 1,3,4,5 are possible. Similarly, S is not in position 4, so positions 1,2,3,5 are possible. 

Let me try ""STEER"" - S in position 1, T new, E in 3, E in 4, R in 5. Contains S and R, ends with E, no A/O. R is in position 5, S in position 1 - both allowed. 

""STEER"" seems valid. 

Check:
- Ends with E: yes.
- Contains R and S: yes.
- No A or O: correct.
- R not in position 2: correct (it's in 5).
- S not in position 4: correct (it's in 1).

This seems like a good next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
Guess 2: STEER -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) E(-) E(-) R(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
Round 2: STEER → S(✓) T(x) E(-) E(-) R(-)

We now know:

1. Position 5 is E (from AROSE).
2. Position 1 is S (from STEER).
3. R is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 4, or 5 (from both rounds). Therefore R must be in position 3.
4. S is in the word but NOT in position 1 or 4 (from both rounds). Therefore S must be in position 2 or 3. But position 3 is now known to be R, so S must be in position 2.
5. T is not in the word (from STEER).
6. E is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (from STEER). Therefore E must be in position 1, 2, or 5. Position 1 is S, position 5 is E, so this means the E in position 5 is the only one, and the other E's in positions 3 and 4 must be wrong (which they were marked as ""-"").

So the current pattern is:
Position 1: S
Position 2: S (but this can't be because we can't have two S's and position 1 is already S)
Wait, this suggests an inconsistency. Let me re-examine:

From STEER feedback:
S(✓) at position 1
T(x) - T not in word
E(-) at position 3 - E is in word but not here
E(-) at position 4 - E is in word but not here
R(-) at position 5 - R is in word but not here

From AROSE feedback:
E(✓) at position 5 - E is correct here

Therefore:
- Position 1: S
- Position 5: E
- R is in word but not in positions 2,4,5 - so R must be in position 3
- S is in word but not in positions 1,4 - but position 1 is already S (✓), so S must be in position 2 or 3. Position 3 is R, so S must be in position 2
- E is in word but not in positions 3,4 - but position 5 is already E (✓), so this is satisfied
- The second E in position 3 and 4 in STEER were marked ""-"" because they are in wrong positions, but we know the correct E is at position 5

So the current pattern is:
S _ R _ E

We need to fill positions 2 and 4 with letters we haven't used yet, excluding A, O, T.

Possible letters for position 2 and 4: any not A, O, T, and ensuring we don't repeat S, R, E.

Let me think of valid 5-letter words fitting S _ R _ E.

Possible candidates:
- S P R I E
- S C R E E (but two E's, and position 4 would be E which is already at 5, but E can appear twice)
- S H R E E
- S D R E E
- S G R E E
- S B R E E (but B is possible)
- S F R E E (but F is possible)

Among these, ""SPR I E"" is valid, as is ""SHREE"", ""SCREE"", etc.

""SPR I E"" uses P and I which haven't been tested yet.

Let's go with ""SPR I E"" - S P R I E.

Check:
- S in position 1 (✓)
- P new
- R in position 3 (must be correct)
- I new
- E in position 5 (✓)

This tests P and I, and fits all constraints.Based on the combined feedback, we've deduced the pattern S _ R _ E. The letters in positions 1 (S), 3 (R), and 5 (E) are all fixed. We need to test possible letters for positions 2 and 4.

Wait – the only common English word that fits S _ R _ E is **SPREE** (S P R E E).  
Although it has an extra E in position 4, Wordle answers can include duplicate letters, and we’ve already confirmed E is correctly at position 5.  
The feedback from STEER already told us E is in the word (and we know it’s at position 5), so the second E in SPREE is acceptable as part of the word.

Therefore, SPREE is the only reasonable next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The classic starting word ""SLATE"" is popular for this reason, as it covers common consonants (S, L, T) and vowels (A, E). However, another strong choice is ""AROSE"" which contains all five of the most common letters in English words (A, R, O, S, E). 

Between these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it has a better letter frequency distribution according to Wordle analysis, giving me a higher chance of hitting at least one correct letter early on.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- E is in the word and is in position 5 (✓)

So we know:
- The word ends with E.
- It contains R and S somewhere, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.
- It does not contain A or O.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Contains R and S.
3. Does not contain A or O.
4. R is not in position 2.
5. S is not in position 4.

Possible candidates: TREND, CRISP, DRIPS, GRIST, PRISM, TRUST, etc.

Let me pick one that uses the known letters efficiently and tests new ones. ""CRISP"" uses C, R, I, S, P - but S is in position 4 which is disallowed. ""DRIPS"" has S in position 4 - also disallowed. ""GRIST"" has S in position 4 - disallowed. ""PRISM"" has S in position 4 - disallowed. ""TREND"" has R in position 2 - disallowed.

""CRUST"" ends with T, not E. ""BRISK"" ends with K. ""FRISK"" ends with K. ""DRUSE"" ends with E, has R and S, no A/O. Let's check: D R U S E. R is in position 2 - disallowed.

""CRUSE"" - R in position 2 - disallowed. ""GRATE"" has A - no good. ""PRUNE"" has O in position 3? No, U is there. P R U N E - R in position 2 - disallowed.

""CRANE"" - A is present. ""BRINE"" - A is present. ""TRINE"" - A is present.

""CRUSE"" - R in position 2 - disallowed. 

""DRUSE"" - R in position 2 - disallowed.

""CRIME"" - valid, but R in position 2 - disallowed.

""CRUST"" - ends with T. 

""CRONE"" - ends with E, has R in position 2 - disallowed. 

""BRUTE"" - ends with E, but R in position 2 - disallowed. 

""PRUNE"" - ends with E, but R in position 2 - disallowed.

""GRIME"" - ends with E, but R in position 2 - disallowed. 

""CRIME"" - ends with E, but R in position 2 - disallowed. 

""BRIME"" - ends with E, but R in position 2 - disallowed. 

Hmm, many words end with E but have R in position 2. Let me think differently - maybe R is not in position 2, so positions 1,3,4,5 are possible. Similarly, S is not in position 4, so positions 1,2,3,5 are possible. 

Let me try ""STEER"" - S in position 1, T new, E in 3, E in 4, R in 5. Contains S and R, ends with E, no A/O. R is in position 5, S in position 1 - both allowed. 

""STEER"" seems valid. 

Check:
- Ends with E: yes.
- Contains R and S: yes.
- No A or O: correct.
- R not in position 2: correct (it's in 5).
- S not in position 4: correct (it's in 1).

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
Round 2: STEER → S(✓) T(x) E(-) E(-) R(-)

We now know:

1. Position 5 is E (from AROSE).
2. Position 1 is S (from STEER).
3. R is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 4, or 5 (from both rounds). Therefore R must be in position 3.
4. S is in the word but NOT in position 1 or 4 (from both rounds). Therefore S must be in position 2 or 3. But position 3 is now known to be R, so S must be in position 2.
5. T is not in the word (from STEER).
6. E is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (from STEER). Therefore E must be in position 1, 2, or 5. Position 1 is S, position 5 is E, so this means the E in position 5 is the only one, and the other E's in positions 3 and 4 must be wrong (which they were marked as ""-"").

So the current pattern is:
Position 1: S
Position 2: S (but this can't be because we can't have two S's and position 1 is already S)
Wait, this suggests an inconsistency. Let me re-examine:

From STEER feedback:
S(✓) at position 1
T(x) - T not in word
E(-) at position 3 - E is in word but not here
E(-) at position 4 - E is in word but not here
R(-) at position 5 - R is in word but not here

From AROSE feedback:
E(✓) at position 5 - E is correct here

Therefore:
- Position 1: S
- Position 5: E
- R is in word but not in positions 2,4,5 - so R must be in position 3
- S is in word but not in positions 1,4 - but position 1 is already S (✓), so S must be in position 2 or 3. Position 3 is R, so S must be in position 2
- E is in word but not in positions 3,4 - but position 5 is already E (✓), so this is satisfied
- The second E in position 3 and 4 in STEER were marked ""-"" because they are in wrong positions, but we know the correct E is at position 5

So the current pattern is:
S _ R _ E

We need to fill positions 2 and 4 with letters we haven't used yet, excluding A, O, T.

Possible letters for position 2 and 4: any not A, O, T, and ensuring we don't repeat S, R, E.

Let me think of valid 5-letter words fitting S _ R _ E.

Possible candidates:
- S P R I E
- S C R E E (but two E's, and position 4 would be E which is already at 5, but E can appear twice)
- S H R E E
- S D R E E
- S G R E E
- S B R E E (but B is possible)
- S F R E E (but F is possible)

Among these, ""SPR I E"" is valid, as is ""SHREE"", ""SCREE"", etc.

""SPR I E"" uses P and I which haven't been tested yet.

Let's go with ""SPR I E"" - S P R I E.

Check:
- S in position 1 (✓)
- P new
- R in position 3 (must be correct)
- I new
- E in position 5 (✓)

This tests P and I, and fits all constraints.Based on the combined feedback, we've deduced the pattern S _ R _ E. The letters in positions 1 (S), 3 (R), and 5 (E) are all fixed. We need to test possible letters for positions 2 and 4.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
Guess 2: STEER -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) E(-) E(-) R(-)
Guess 3: SPR I E -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The feedback from SPR I E was that the model answer is not five letters, so ""SPR I E"" is invalid (likely because it was interpreted as ""SPR I E"" with a space, but Wordle answers don't have spaces). The correct word must be a single 5-letter word.

Given the constraints:
- S _ R _ E (positions 1,3,5 fixed as S, R, E)
- No A, O, T
- Letters not yet used for positions 2 and 4: any except A, O, T, S, R, E

Possible valid words:
- SCREE (S C R E E) - but position 4 would be E, which is already at 5 - might be valid
- SHREE (S H R E E)
- SWREE (invalid)
- SBREE (invalid)
- SPREE (S P R E E) - but this has P and E in position 4
- SKREE (invalid)
- SCREE, SHREE, SPREE are the most likely

""SPREE"" is a valid word and tests P in position 2 and E in position 4 (but E is already at 5, so this might be redundant). However, Wordle words can have duplicate letters.

Let's go with ""SPREE"" as it's valid and tests P in position 2.

But wait, from STEER feedback, E is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4, and we know E is correctly at 5, so duplicate E's might not be allowed or might be acceptable. 

Another option is ""SCREE"" (S C R E E) - but this has E in position 4 which was marked ""-"" in STEER, so it's invalid.

""SHREE"" is valid - S H R E E.

Let's choose ""SHREE"".Based on the previous deductions (S _ R _ E pattern, no A/O/T, and correcting the invalid space issue), the next guess is:

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
Guess 2: STEER -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) E(-) E(-) R(-)
Guess 3: SPR I E -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 4: SHREE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) R(✓) E(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on SHREE:

- S(✓) – correct in position 1  
- H(x) – H is NOT in the word  
- R(✓) – correct in position 3  
- E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (we already know E is correctly at position 5, so this confirms no second E before the end)  
- E(✓) – correct in position 5  

Thus the pattern is now fully determined:  
S _ R _ E  

We still need to fill position 2 and position 4 with letters that  
- have not yet been tested,  
- are not A, O, T, H,  
- do not conflict with known letters (S, R, E already used).  

Possible letters left (common ones): B, C, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

Scanning the dictionary for valid S _ R _ E words:  
- SCR E E – invalid (E in position 4 is already ruled out)  
- S P R E E – valid word, tests P in position 2 and E in position 4 (but E is already fixed at 5, so the second E is extra)  
- S C R E E – same issue  
- S K R E E – same  
- S D R E E – not a word  
- S G R E E – not a word  
- S B R E E – not a word  
- S F R E E – not a word  
- S L R E E – not a word  
- S W R E E – not a word  
- S V R E E – not a word  
- S N R E E – not a word  
- S M R E E – not a word  
- S I R E E – not a word  
- S U R E E – not a word  
- S Y R E E – not a word  
- S X R E E – not a word  
- S Z R E E – not a word  

Wait – the only common English word that fits S _ R _ E is **SPREE** (S P R E E).  
Although it has an extra E in position 4, Wordle answers can include duplicate letters, and we’ve already confirmed E is correctly at position 5.  
The feedback from STEER already told us E is in the word (and we know it’s at position 5), so the second E in SPREE is acceptable as part of the word.

Therefore, SPREE is the only reasonable next guess.  
If it’s correct, the final pattern will be S P R E E, which is a valid word.

(If SPREE is incorrect, the only other possibility would be S C R E E, S K R E E, etc., but those are all either invalid or duplicates we’ve already accounted for.)

I’ll choose the more common **SCREE**.

(If SCREE were incorrect, the only other plausible word left would be SKREE, but since both have been tested and only one is typically listed as valid, this suggests SCREE is the intended answer.)

- S Y R E E – not a word  
- S X R E E – not a word  
- S Z R E E – not a word  

The only remaining common words are **S C R E E** and **S K R E E**.  
Between these, **SKREE** is a valid word (though rarer), while **SCREE** is also valid but slightly more common.  
Since we have no prior info on C or K, either could be correct.  
I’ll choose the more common **SCREE**.

(If SCREE were incorrect, the only other plausible word left would be SKREE, but since both have been tested and only one is typically listed as valid, this suggests SCREE is the intended answer.)",Guess 6: SCREE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(x) R(✓) E(-) E(✓),FAIL
