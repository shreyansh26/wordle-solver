### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback.

Common starting words often include letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, etc. A popular and effective first guess is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should give good coverage of possible letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-)
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-)
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-)

So the secret word contains: L, A, E (somewhere other than positions 2, 3, 5 respectively) and does NOT contain S or T.

I need a word that:
1. Includes L, A, E
2. Does not place L in position 2, A in position 3, E in position 5
3. Does not use S or T

A good candidate is ""LEARN"":
- L is in position 1 (allowed, since it wasn't in position 2)
- E is in position 2 (allowed, since it wasn't in position 5)
- A is in position 3 (forbidden, since A was marked ""-"" for position 3)
So this doesn't work.

Next candidate: ""EARLY""
- E in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- R (new letter, but we know R isn't ruled out)
- L in position 4 (allowed, since L wasn't in position 2)
- Y (new letter)
But we don't know about R and Y yet, and we want to test more vowels.

Another candidate: ""ELAWE"" - but this uses E twice and W is untested.

Better: ""ALERT""
- A in position 1 (allowed)
- L in position 2 (forbidden, since L was ""-"" for position 2)
No.

""LEVER"":
- L in position 1 (allowed)
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- V (new)
- E in position 4 (allowed)
- R (new)
But E appears twice and we don't know if E is allowed twice.

""ELDER"":
- E in position 1 (allowed)
- L in position 2 (forbidden)

""ALDER"":
- A in position 1 (allowed)
- L in position 2 (forbidden)

""LEAFY"":
- L in position 1 (allowed)

""LABEL"":
- L in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (allowed)

This seems valid:
- Contains L, A, E
- L not in position 2 (it's in 1 and 5)
- A not in position 3 (it's in 2)

Let’s digest the new feedback on LABEL:

- L(✓) : First letter is L – locked in position 1.
- A(✓) : Second letter is A – locked in position 2.
- B(x) : B is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) : Fourth letter is E – locked in position 4.
- L(-) : Fifth letter is L but it is NOT in position 5 (so it must appear elsewhere, but position 5 is already shown to be L and marked “-” meaning L is not in position 5). This implies L appears exactly once (contradicting the “-” on position 5), so the feedback must mean L is in the word but not in position 5. But position 1 already has L(✓), so L can’t appear again. This suggests L is only once and is in position 1, so the fifth letter cannot be L. The feedback must be interpreted as: L is in position 1 (✓), A is in position 2 (✓), E is in position 4 (✓), B is not in the word, and the fifth letter is L but that L is not in position 5 (which is impossible if position 1 already has L). This implies the fifth letter is NOT L, and the feedback “L(-)” on the fifth letter is a mistake in interpretation. Re-reading: the fifth letter in LABEL is L, and the feedback is “L(-)” meaning that L is in the word but not in position 5. Since we already have L in position 1, this is consistent: L appears once, in position 1. So the fifth letter is NOT L. 

So far we have:
- Positions: 1=L, 2=A, 3=?, 4=E, 5=?
- Letters known to be in word: L, A, E
- Letters known NOT in word: S, T, B
- Remaining letters to test: consonants and vowels not yet tried (C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)

The word looks like L A _ E _

We need a fifth letter that is:
- Not S, T, B
- Not L (since L is already in position 1 and can’t repeat)
- Not E (since E is in position 4 and can’t repeat)

Possible endings: ...E D, ...E R, etc.

A good candidate is “L A R E _” – but we need a fifth letter. Let’s pick a common consonant. “L A R E N” is 5 letters: L A R E N.

Check:
- Contains L, A, E
- L in position 1 (✓)
- A in position 2 (✓)
- E in position 4 (✓)
- No S, T, B
- No duplicate L
- Fifth letter N is new and plausible.

So “LAREN” is a valid guess.

But “LAREN” is not a common English word. Adjust: “L A G E _” – “L A G E R” is invalid. “L A M E R” – but M is 3rd, E is 4th, R is 5th. That fits: L A M E R.

Check:
- L(1), A(2), M(3), E(4), R(5)
- Contains L, A, E
- No S, T, B
- No duplicate L
- New letters M, R tested.

Thus, “LAMER” is a good next guess.

- Remaining letters to test: consonants and vowels not yet tried (C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)

The word looks like L A _ E _

We need a fifth letter that is:
- Not S, T, B
- Not L (since L is already in position 1 and can’t repeat)
- Not E (since E is in position 4 and can’t repeat)

Possible endings: ...E D, ...E R, etc.

A good candidate is “L A R E _” – but we need a fifth letter. Let’s pick a common consonant. “L A R E N” is 5 letters: L A R E N.

Check:
- Contains L, A, E
- L in position 1 (✓)
- A in position 2 (✓)
- E in position 4 (✓)
- No S, T, B
- No duplicate L
- Fifth letter N is new and plausible.

So “LAREN” is a valid guess.

But “LAREN” is not a common English word. Adjust: “L A G E _” – “L A G E R” is invalid. “L A M E R” – but M is 3rd, E is 4th, R is 5th. That fits: L A M E R.

Check:
- L(1), A(2), M(3), E(4), R(5)
- Contains L, A, E
- No S, T, B
- No duplicate L
- New letters M, R tested.

Thus, “LAMER” is a good next guess.",Guess 3: LAMER -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) A(✓) M(x) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback.

Common starting words often include letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, etc. A popular and effective first guess is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should give good coverage of possible letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-)
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-)
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-)

So the secret word contains: L, A, E (somewhere other than positions 2, 3, 5 respectively) and does NOT contain S or T.

I need a word that:
1. Includes L, A, E
2. Does not place L in position 2, A in position 3, E in position 5
3. Does not use S or T

A good candidate is ""LEARN"":
- L is in position 1 (allowed, since it wasn't in position 2)
- E is in position 2 (allowed, since it wasn't in position 5)
- A is in position 3 (forbidden, since A was marked ""-"" for position 3)
So this doesn't work.

Next candidate: ""EARLY""
- E in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- R (new letter, but we know R isn't ruled out)
- L in position 4 (allowed, since L wasn't in position 2)
- Y (new letter)
But we don't know about R and Y yet, and we want to test more vowels.

Another candidate: ""ELAWE"" - but this uses E twice and W is untested.

Better: ""ALERT""
- A in position 1 (allowed)
- L in position 2 (forbidden, since L was ""-"" for position 2)
No.

""LEVER"":
- L in position 1 (allowed)
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- V (new)
- E in position 4 (allowed)
- R (new)
But E appears twice and we don't know if E is allowed twice.

""ELDER"":
- E in position 1 (allowed)
- L in position 2 (forbidden)

""ALDER"":
- A in position 1 (allowed)
- L in position 2 (forbidden)

""LEAFY"":
- L in position 1 (allowed)
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- A in position 3 (forbidden)

""ELATE"":
- E in position 1 (allowed)
- L in position 2 (forbidden)

""LABEL"":
- L in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- B (new)
- E in position 4 (allowed)
- L in position 5 (allowed)
This seems valid:
- Contains L, A, E
- L not in position 2 (it's in 1 and 5)
- A not in position 3 (it's in 2)
- E not in position 5 (it's in 1 and 4)
- No S or T
- No duplicate letters tested yet

So ""LABEL"" is a good next guess.

Guess 2: LABEL -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) A(✓) B(x) E(✓) L(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s digest the new feedback on LABEL:

- L(✓) : First letter is L – locked in position 1.
- A(✓) : Second letter is A – locked in position 2.
- B(x) : B is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) : Fourth letter is E – locked in position 4.
- L(-) : Fifth letter is L but it is NOT in position 5 (so it must appear elsewhere, but position 5 is already shown to be L and marked “-” meaning L is not in position 5). This implies L appears exactly once (contradicting the “-” on position 5), so the feedback must mean L is in the word but not in position 5. But position 1 already has L(✓), so L can’t appear again. This suggests L is only once and is in position 1, so the fifth letter cannot be L. The feedback must be interpreted as: L is in position 1 (✓), A is in position 2 (✓), E is in position 4 (✓), B is not in the word, and the fifth letter is L but that L is not in position 5 (which is impossible if position 1 already has L). This implies the fifth letter is NOT L, and the feedback “L(-)” on the fifth letter is a mistake in interpretation. Re-reading: the fifth letter in LABEL is L, and the feedback is “L(-)” meaning that L is in the word but not in position 5. Since we already have L in position 1, this is consistent: L appears once, in position 1. So the fifth letter is NOT L. 

So far we have:
- Positions: 1=L, 2=A, 3=?, 4=E, 5=?
- Letters known to be in word: L, A, E
- Letters known NOT in word: S, T, B
- Remaining letters to test: consonants and vowels not yet tried (C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)

The word looks like L A _ E _

We need a fifth letter that is:
- Not S, T, B
- Not L (since L is already in position 1 and can’t repeat)
- Not E (since E is in position 4 and can’t repeat)

Possible endings: ...E D, ...E R, etc.

A good candidate is “L A R E _” – but we need a fifth letter. Let’s pick a common consonant. “L A R E N” is 5 letters: L A R E N.

Check:
- Contains L, A, E
- L in position 1 (✓)
- A in position 2 (✓)
- E in position 4 (✓)
- No S, T, B
- No duplicate L
- Fifth letter N is new and plausible.

So “LAREN” is a valid guess.

But “LAREN” is not a common English word. Adjust: “L A G E _” – “L A G E R” is invalid. “L A M E R” – but M is 3rd, E is 4th, R is 5th. That fits: L A M E R.

Check:
- L(1), A(2), M(3), E(4), R(5)
- Contains L, A, E
- No S, T, B
- No duplicate L
- New letters M, R tested.

Thus, “LAMER” is a good next guess.

So far we have:
- Positions: 1=L, 2=A, 3=?, 4=E, 5=?
- Letters known to be in word: L, A, E
- Letters known NOT in word: S, T, B
- Remaining letters to test: consonants and vowels not yet tried (C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)

The word looks like L A _ E _

We need a fifth letter that is:
- Not S, T, B
- Not L (since L is already in position 1 and can’t repeat)
- Not E (since E is in position 4 and can’t repeat)

Possible endings: ...E D, ...E R, etc.

A good candidate is “L A R E _” – but we need a fifth letter. Let’s pick a common consonant. “L A R E N” is 5 letters: L A R E N.

Check:
- Contains L, A, E
- L in position 1 (✓)
- A in position 2 (✓)
- E in position 4 (✓)
- No S, T, B
- No duplicate L
- Fifth letter N is new and plausible.

So “LAREN” is a valid guess.

But “LAREN” is not a common English word. Adjust: “L A G E _” – “L A G E R” is invalid. “L A M E R” – but M is 3rd, E is 4th, R is 5th. That fits: L A M E R.

Check:
- L(1), A(2), M(3), E(4), R(5)
- Contains L, A, E
- No S, T, B
- No duplicate L
- New letters M, R tested.

Thus, “LAMER” is a good next guess.

Current confirmed information:
- Word pattern: L A _ E R (positions 1,2,4,5 fixed as L,A,E,R respectively)
- Letters known NOT in the word: S,T,B,M
- Still missing: the third letter (position 3)

Letters that can occupy position 3 (must not be S,T,B,M and must form a valid 5-letter word starting with L A _ E R):
Available consonants/vowels: C,D,F,G,H,I,K,N,O,P,Q,R,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (excluding S,T,B,M)

Common English 5-letter words that fit L A _ E R:
- L A N E R → ""LANER"" (valid, means someone who lanes)
- L A G E R → ""G"" in position 3 → ""LAGER"" (valid, a type of beer)
- L A P E R → ""P"" in position 3 → ""LAPER"" (valid, though rarer)
- L A I E R → ""I"" in position 3 → ""LAIER"" (valid comparative form, but less common)

Among these, ""LAGER"" is a very common word and uses G, which hasn't been tested yet. This seems like the most likely candidate.

Let's verify:
- L A G E R:
  - L(✓) A(✓) G(?) E(✓) R(✓)
  - G is new and plausible.
  - No forbidden letters (S,T,B,M).
  - Forms a valid English word.

Therefore, the next logical guess is ""LAGER"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback.

Common starting words often include letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, etc. A popular and effective first guess is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should give good coverage of possible letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-)
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-)
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-)

So the secret word contains: L, A, E (somewhere other than positions 2, 3, 5 respectively) and does NOT contain S or T.

I need a word that:
1. Includes L, A, E
2. Does not place L in position 2, A in position 3, E in position 5
3. Does not use S or T

A good candidate is ""LEARN"":
- L is in position 1 (allowed, since it wasn't in position 2)
- E is in position 2 (allowed, since it wasn't in position 5)
- A is in position 3 (forbidden, since A was marked ""-"" for position 3)
So this doesn't work.

Next candidate: ""EARLY""
- E in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- R (new letter, but we know R isn't ruled out)
- L in position 4 (allowed, since L wasn't in position 2)
- Y (new letter)
But we don't know about R and Y yet, and we want to test more vowels.

Another candidate: ""ELAWE"" - but this uses E twice and W is untested.

Better: ""ALERT""
- A in position 1 (allowed)
- L in position 2 (forbidden, since L was ""-"" for position 2)
No.

""LEVER"":
- L in position 1 (allowed)
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- V (new)
- E in position 4 (allowed)
- R (new)
But E appears twice and we don't know if E is allowed twice.

""ELDER"":
- E in position 1 (allowed)
- L in position 2 (forbidden)

""ALDER"":
- A in position 1 (allowed)
- L in position 2 (forbidden)

""LEAFY"":
- L in position 1 (allowed)
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- A in position 3 (forbidden)

""ELATE"":
- E in position 1 (allowed)
- L in position 2 (forbidden)

""LABEL"":
- L in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- B (new)
- E in position 4 (allowed)
- L in position 5 (allowed)
This seems valid:
- Contains L, A, E
- L not in position 2 (it's in 1 and 5)
- A not in position 3 (it's in 2)
- E not in position 5 (it's in 1 and 4)
- No S or T
- No duplicate letters tested yet

Let’s digest the new feedback on LABEL:

- L(✓) : First letter is L – locked in position 1.
- A(✓) : Second letter is A – locked in position 2.
- B(x) : B is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) : Fourth letter is E – locked in position 4.
- L(-) : Fifth letter is L but it is NOT in position 5 (so it must appear elsewhere, but position 5 is already shown to be L and marked “-” meaning L is not in position 5). This implies L appears exactly once (contradicting the “-” on position 5), so the feedback must mean L is in the word but not in position 5. But position 1 already has L(✓), so L can’t appear again. This suggests L is only once and is in position 1, so the fifth letter cannot be L. The feedback must be interpreted as: L is in position 1 (✓), A is in position 2 (✓), E is in position 4 (✓), B is not in the word, and the fifth letter is L but that L is not in position 5 (which is impossible if position 1 already has L). This implies the fifth letter is NOT L, and the feedback “L(-)” on the fifth letter is a mistake in interpretation. Re-reading: the fifth letter in LABEL is L, and the feedback is “L(-)” meaning that L is in the word but not in position 5. Since we already have L in position 1, this is consistent: L appears once, in position 1. So the fifth letter is NOT L. 

So far we have:
- Positions: 1=L, 2=A, 3=?, 4=E, 5=?
- Letters known to be in word: L, A, E
- Letters known NOT in word: S, T, B
- Remaining letters to test: consonants and vowels not yet tried (C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)

The word looks like L A _ E _

We need a fifth letter that is:
- Not S, T, B
- Not L (since L is already in position 1 and can’t repeat)
- Not E (since E is in position 4 and can’t repeat)

Possible endings: ...E D, ...E R, etc.

A good candidate is “L A R E _” – but we need a fifth letter. Let’s pick a common consonant. “L A R E N” is 5 letters: L A R E N.

Check:
- Contains L, A, E
- L in position 1 (✓)
- A in position 2 (✓)
- E in position 4 (✓)
- No S, T, B
- No duplicate L
- Fifth letter N is new and plausible.

So “LAREN” is a valid guess.

But “LAREN” is not a common English word. Adjust: “L A G E _” – “L A G E R” is invalid. “L A M E R” – but M is 3rd, E is 4th, R is 5th. That fits: L A M E R.

Check:
- L(1), A(2), M(3), E(4), R(5)
- Contains L, A, E
- No S, T, B
- No duplicate L
- New letters M, R tested.

Thus, “LAMER” is a good next guess.

Consonants: C, D, F, H, K, N, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels: I, O, U (but vowel in position 3 is less common in this pattern)

Common 5-letter English words fitting L A _ E R:
- L A N E R → ""LANER"" (valid)
- L A D E R → ""D"" in position 3 → ""LADER"" (valid, though less common)
- L A I E R → ""I"" in position 3 → ""LAIER"" (valid but rare)
- L A P E R → ""P"" in position 3 → ""LAPER"" (valid but rare)
- L A F E R → ""F"" in position 3 → ""LAFER"" (valid but rare)

Among these, ""LANER"" is the most common word. Let's verify:
- L A N E R:
  - L(✓) A(✓) N(?) E(✓) R(✓)
  - N is new and not forbidden.
  - Forms a valid English word.

Therefore, ""LANER"" is the logical next guess.

This suggests L is only once and is in position 1, so the fifth letter cannot be L. The feedback must be interpreted as: L is in position 1 (✓), A is in position 2 (✓), E is in position 4 (✓), B is not in the word, and the fifth letter is L but that L is not in position 5 (which is impossible if position 1 already has L). This implies the fifth letter is NOT L, and the feedback “L(-)” on the fifth letter is a mistake in interpretation.
