### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should cover these.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

1. First letter is S (✓).
2. Second letter is A (✓).
3. Letters NOT in the word at all: L, T, E, H, R, K, M, P.
4. Letter O is in the word but not in position 5 (because it was “-” in SAMPO).

So the pattern is S A _ _ _ and the remaining letters must come from the unused pool plus O, which can only be in positions 3 or 4.

Unused common letters: B, C, D, F, G, I, N, U, V, W, Y, plus O.

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with SA and uses O in position 3 or 4, plus any new letters.

Possible candidates:
- S A O _ _ → but no common words fit
- S A _ O _ → e.g., SABO? (invalid), SABOT? (valid)
- S A _ _ O → e.g., SAD? (invalid), SAG? (invalid), SAV? (invalid), SAW? (invalid)

The only valid word that fits is SABOT, but we need to check:
- S A B O T
- Letters B, O, T: T is already ruled out (from SLATE feedback), so SABOT is invalid.

Next candidate: SAGGY? But G is new, Y is new, but we need to check all letters:
- S A G G Y → G is new, Y is new, but double G is unlikely.

Next: SAPPY? P is already ruled out.

Next: SAVVY? V is new, Y is new, but double V is unlikely.

Next: SAWNY? Not a word.

Next: SABIN? I is new, N is new, but B is new, and O is not used.

Wait, we must use O in position 3 or 4. Let me list possible positions:
- SA _ O _ → need a letter before O and after O that are unused.
- SA _ _ O → need letters before and after O.

Looking at common words:
- S A C H E? No, H and E ruled out.
- S A N D Y? N, D, Y are new, but no O.
- S A V O R? R ruled out.
- S A V O Y? V, O, Y are new or confirmed. SAVOY is a valid word.

Check SAVOY:
- S A V O Y
- Letters: S, A (✓), V (new), O (must be used, and is in position 4), Y (new)
- All letters are either confirmed, new, or O which we know is in the word.

This seems valid.

Another candidate: S A V O R? R ruled out.
S A D O N? Not a word.
S A L O N? L ruled out.
S A C O N? Not a word.
S A F O N? Not a word.
S A G O N? Not a word.
S A V O N? Not a word.
S A M O N? M ruled out.
Thus, SAVOY is the best.

Let me confirm SAVOY is a valid 5-letter English word: Yes, SAVOY (a region in France) is valid.

So the next guess is SAVOY.
