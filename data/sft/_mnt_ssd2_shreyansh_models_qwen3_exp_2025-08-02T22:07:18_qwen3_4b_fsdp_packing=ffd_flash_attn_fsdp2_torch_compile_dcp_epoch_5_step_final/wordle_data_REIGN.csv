### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The classic starting word ""SLATE"" is popular for this reason, as it covers common consonants and vowels. However, another strong choice is ""AROSE"" which contains all five of the most common English letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is particularly good at revealing vowel positions. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it gives excellent coverage of high-frequency letters and vowels, which should help narrow down possibilities quickly.

- T, R, E, A, D
But A is already ruled out, so this is invalid.

Another candidate is ""ENTRY"":

This uses E (not in position 5) and R (not in position 2), and doesn't include A, O, S. This seems valid.

Let me check:

So far:
- Letters definitely in: R, E, N
- Letters definitely out: A, O, S, T, Y, U, D
- R cannot be in positions 2, 4, 5
- E cannot be in positions 1, 4, 5
- N can be anywhere (yet not yet pinned down)

Remaining high-frequency letters not yet tested: I, L, C, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with R, E, N and no banned letters, while respecting the position bans.

Let’s list possible positions for R, E, N:

R must be in 1 or 3 (since 2,4,5 are banned)
E must be in 2 or 3 (since 1,4,5 are banned)
N can be anywhere (but let’s see)

Let’s try to place them:

Option 1: R in 1, E in 2 → word starts with RE...
   Then N could be 3, 4, or 5 (but 5 is banned for E, but N has no ban)
   But E is in 2, R in 1, so possible: R E N _ _
   Need two more letters not yet used (from remaining: I, L, C, G, H, M, P, B, F, K)
   Let’s pick common endings: “REND_” – but we need a valid word.
   “REIGN” – but G and I are allowed, N is already used. But “REIGN” has I in 3, but we already have N in 3? No, REIGN is R E I G N – this has I and G, and positions:
   R(1) – allowed
   E(2) – allowed
   I(3) – new
   G(4) – new
   N(5) – allowed (no ban on N in 5)
   But we know N must be present somewhere, and this places it in 5. This seems valid.

Option 2: R in 1, E in 3 → R _ E N _ or R _ E _ N
   But E is in 3, R in 1, N could be 4 or 5.
   Example: R I E N D – but D is banned.
   R I E N G – G is allowed, but D is banned, so this might work, but “RIENG” isn’t a word.

Option 3: R in 3, E in 2 → _ E R N _ or _ E R _ N
   But R must be in 1 or 3 (from bans), and E must be in 2 or 3.
   If R is in 3 and E is in 2: _ E R _ _
   Then N must be in 1, 4, or 5.
   Example: N E R V E – but E is already in 2 and 5, and E cannot be in 5.
   N E R F _ – “NERF_” isn’t a common word.

Option 4: R in 3, E in 3 – impossible, same position.

Thus, the most promising is Option 1: “REIGN” – but let me verify:
- Letters: R, E, I, G, N
- All letters are allowed (no banned ones)
- R in 1 (allowed)
- E in 2 (allowed)
- N in 5 (allowed)
- I and G are new letters to test
- This should reveal more about possible positions and additional letters.

However, “REIGN” is a valid English word meaning to rule or dominate. It seems like a good next guess.
