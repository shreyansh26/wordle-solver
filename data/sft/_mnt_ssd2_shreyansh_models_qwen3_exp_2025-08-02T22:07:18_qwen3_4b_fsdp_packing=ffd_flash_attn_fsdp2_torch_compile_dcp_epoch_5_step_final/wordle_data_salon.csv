3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The classic starting word ""SLATE"" is popular for this reason, as it includes common consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E). However, another strong choice is ""CRANE"" which covers similar ground. After considering a few options, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's widely recognized as an effective starting word in Wordle strategy.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 (✓)
- L is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- T and E are not in the word at all (x)

So far we know:
- Word starts with S
- Contains L and A somewhere (but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively)
- Does not contain T or E

Good letters to use next: L, A
Forbidden letters: T, E
Known positions: S _ _ _ _

I need a word that:
- Starts with S
- Uses L and A in different positions than before
- Avoids T and E

Possible positions for L: 3,4,5
Possible positions for A: 2,4,5

Let me think of words that fit:
- S _ _ A _ : SLASH? but has T (no)
- S _ L A _ : SLALA? not a word
- S _ _ L A : S _ _ L A - SULSA? no
- S A _ _ L : S A _ _ L - SAGAL? no
- S _ A L _ : S _ A L _ - SPALL? has T? no
- S A L _ _ : SALSA? has T? no

Wait, let me try:
- S _ _ _ A : SLICA? no
- S _ L _ A : S _ L _ A - SPILA? no
- S _ _ L A : S _ _ L A - SCALA? has T? no

Hmm, let me think differently. Maybe use A in position 2:
S A _ _ _ : 
- S A L _ _ : SALSA? has T? no
- S A _ L _ : S A _ L _ - SABAL? no
- S A _ _ L : S A _ _ L - SAGAL? no

- S _ L _ _ - SPULD? no

- S _ _ L _ - SULFA? no

Try L in position 5:
S _ _ _ L : 
- S _ _ _ L - S _ _ _ L - SAGAL? no
- S _ _ _ L - SULAL? no

This is tricky. Maybe try a word that uses A in position 4 and L in position 3:
S _ _ A L : 
- S _ _ A L - SUGAL? no
- S _ _ A L - SPHAL? no

Wait, what about ""SCALE""? Let me check:

- Positions: S C A L E
  - L is in position 4 (was in position 2 in SLATE, so this is new)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The classic starting word ""SLATE"" is popular for this reason, as it includes common consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E). However, another strong choice is ""CRANE"" which covers similar ground. After considering a few options, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's widely recognized as an effective starting word in Wordle strategy.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 (✓)
- L is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- T and E are not in the word at all (x)

So far we know:
- Word starts with S
- Contains L and A somewhere (but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively)
- Does not contain T or E

Good letters to use next: L, A
Forbidden letters: T, E
Known positions: S _ _ _ _

I need a word that:
- Starts with S
- Uses L and A in different positions than before
- Avoids T and E

Possible positions for L: 3,4,5
Possible positions for A: 2,4,5

Let me think of words that fit:
- S _ _ A _ : SLASH? but has T (no)
- S _ L A _ : SLALA? not a word
- S _ _ L A : S _ _ L A - SULSA? no
- S A _ _ L : S A _ _ L - SAGAL? no
- S _ A L _ : S _ A L _ - SPALL? has T? no
- S A L _ _ : SALSA? has T? no

Wait, let me try:
- S _ _ _ A : SLICA? no
- S _ L _ A : S _ L _ A - SPILA? no
- S _ _ L A : S _ _ L A - SCALA? has T? no

Hmm, let me think differently. Maybe use A in position 2:
S A _ _ _ : 
- S A L _ _ : SALSA? has T? no
- S A _ L _ : S A _ L _ - SABAL? no
- S A _ _ L : S A _ _ L - SAGAL? no

Try L in position 3:
S _ L _ _ : 
- S _ L _ _ - SCLAD? no
- S _ L _ _ - SPULD? no

Try L in position 4:
S _ _ L _ : 
- S _ _ L _ - SCALD? no
- S _ _ L _ - SULFA? no

Try L in position 5:
S _ _ _ L : 
- S _ _ _ L - S _ _ _ L - SAGAL? no
- S _ _ _ L - SULAL? no

This is tricky. Maybe try a word that uses A in position 4 and L in position 3:
S _ _ A L : 
- S _ _ A L - SUGAL? no
- S _ _ A L - SPHAL? no

Wait, what about ""SCALE""? Let me check:
- Starts with S ✓
- Contains L and A ✓
- Does not contain T or E ✓
- Positions: S C A L E
  - L is in position 4 (was in position 2 in SLATE, so this is new)
  - A is in position 3 (was in position 3 in SLATE, but feedback was ""-"" so this is invalid)

Oops, A can't be in position 3 again. Let me try ""SALSA"":
- Starts with S ✓
- Contains L and A ✓
- Does not contain T or E ✓
- Positions: S A L S A
  - L is in position 3 (was position 2 in SLATE, so this is new)
  - A is in position 2 (was position 3 in SLATE, so this is new)

This seems valid. SALSA is a real word and fits all constraints.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SALSA -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(✓) L(✓) S(-) A(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. S is fixed in position 1 (✓).
2. A is fixed in position 2 (✓).
3. L is fixed in position 3 (✓).
4. S is in the word but NOT in position 4 (feedback for SALSA shows S(-) in position 4).
5. A is in the word but NOT in position 5 (feedback for SALSA shows A(-) in position 5).

So the current pattern is:

S A L _ _

Letters already used and ruled out: T, E, (from SALSA) the second S and second A cannot appear again in other positions.

We still need two more letters for positions 4 and 5.  
Allowed letters are any that haven’t been eliminated yet (no T, E, A in positions 4 or 5, no S in position 4).

A good candidate letter set includes common consonants and vowels we haven’t tried: R, N, D, C, H, I, O, U, etc.

Let’s try a word that fits SAL _ _ and uses new letters.  
SALSA is already ruled out because it reuses S and A in forbidden spots.  
SALAD is ruled out because it uses A again in position 5.  
SALTY uses T (already ruled out).  
SALSA is out, so let’s try SALIN:

- S A L I N: uses new letters I and N, no reused S or A in forbidden positions.
