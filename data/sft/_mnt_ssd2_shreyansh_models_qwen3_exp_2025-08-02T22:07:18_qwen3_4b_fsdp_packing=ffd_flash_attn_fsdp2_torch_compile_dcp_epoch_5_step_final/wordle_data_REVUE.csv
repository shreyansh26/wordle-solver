For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 vowels and common consonants to maximize information gain. ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), covering 5 of the most frequent letters. This should give us good feedback to narrow down the possibilities for the secret word.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A is not in the word (x).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- O is not in the word (x).
- S is not in the word (x).
- E is in the correct position (✓) at the end.

So far we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains R somewhere other than position 2.
3. It does not contain A, O, S.

I want a new guess that:
- Keeps E in position 5.
- Uses R in a different position.
- Avoids A, O, S.
- Introduces other common letters not yet tested (T, N, I, L, C, etc.).

A good candidate is “IRATE”:
- I, T, N are new letters.
- R moves to position 2 (was position 2 in “arose”, so now it’s in position 2 again, but that’s allowed since the feedback only said it’s in the wrong position, not necessarily position 3).
Wait, no, in “arose” R was in position 2 and got “-” (wrong position), so I should put R in a different position. Let me choose “IRATE” but with R in position 3 instead: “IRATE” has R in position 2 again, which is same as before. Let me pick another word.

How about “CRATE”:
- C, T, I are new letters.
- R is in position 2 again, same as before. Not ideal.

Better word: “TIMER”:
- T, I, M are new letters.
- R is in position 5, which is correct position (E is already there), so R cannot be in 5. Not good.

Next: “TERSE” – but S is already excluded.

Another: “PERKY” – but Y is less common, and P,K not tested yet.

Better: “NERDY” – but D, Y, N, R, E. E is fixed at 5, R must not be at 2.

Let me try “UNDER”:
- U, N, D are new.
- R is in position 5, which conflicts with E at 5. Not possible.

Wait, E is fixed at position 5, so any word must end with E. Let me focus on that.

Looking for 5-letter words ending with E, containing R not in position 2, and avoiding A,O,S.

Examples: “TIMER” (R at 4), “PIPER” (but P is repeated), “CRIME” (R at 2 again), “DRIVE” (R at 2), “GRIME” (R at 2).

Let me pick “TIMER”:
- T, I, M are new letters.
- R is in position 4 (was position 2 before), so this satisfies “wrong position” from feedback.
- Ends with E as required.
- Avoids A,O,S.

This seems optimal.

- R moves to position 2 (was position 2 in “arose”, so now it’s in position 2 again, but that’s allowed since the feedback only said it’s in the wrong position, not necessarily position 3).
Wait, no, in “arose” R was in position 2 and got “-” (wrong position), so I should put R in a different position. Let me choose “IRATE” but with R in position 3 instead: “IRATE” has R in position 2 again, which is same as before. Let me pick another word.

How about “CRATE”:
- C, T, I are new letters.
- R is in position 2 again, same as before. Not ideal.

Better word: “TIMER”:
- T, I, M are new letters.
- R is in position 5, which is correct position (E is already there), so R cannot be in 5. Not good.

Next: “TERSE” – but S is already excluded.

Another: “PERKY” – but Y is less common, and P,K not tested yet.

Better: “NERDY” – but D, Y, N, R, E. E is fixed at 5, R must not be at 2.

Let me try “UNDER”:
- U, N, D are new.
- R is in position 5, which conflicts with E at 5. Not possible.

Wait, E is fixed at position 5, so any word must end with E. Let me focus on that.

Looking for 5-letter words ending with E, containing R not in position 2, and avoiding A,O,S.

Examples: “TIMER” (R at 4), “PIPER” (but P is repeated), “CRIME” (R at 2 again), “DRIVE” (R at 2), “GRIME” (R at 2).

Let me pick “TIMER”:
- T, I, M are new letters.
- R is in position 4 (was position 2 before), so this satisfies “wrong position” from feedback.
- Ends with E as required.
- Avoids A,O,S.

This seems optimal.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: timer -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(-) R(-)
<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word ends with E (from arose feedback).
2. R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 5 (from arose and timer feedback).
3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, O, S, T, I, M.
4. Therefore the remaining letters we can still use are among: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the already-placed E and the still-unknown positions 1,2,3,4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E
- Contains R in position 1, 3 or 4 (since 2 and 5 are ruled out)
- Uses only letters not yet excluded.

Good remaining consonants to test next are N, L, C, D, P, G, B, etc.

A high-information guess that places R in position 1 and tests new common letters is “RIDGE”:
- R in position 1 (new position for R)
- I, D, G are new letters
- Ends with E
- Avoids all excluded letters.

This should quickly narrow down where R can go and test useful new consonants.

From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word ends with E (fixed in position 5).
2. R is in the correct position at position 1.
3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, O, S, T, I, M, D, G.
4. Therefore the remaining letters we can still use are: B, C, F, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with the pattern R _ _ _ E, using only the still-allowed letters.

Good remaining consonants to test next are N, L, C, B, F, K, etc.

A high-information guess that fills position 2 and tests common remaining letters is “R N C E” – but “rnce” is not a valid word. Instead, let’s pick a valid word that fits: “R N L E” → “rnle” invalid. Next: “R U N E” → “rune” (but that’s 4 letters). Valid 5-letter words with pattern R _ _ _ E include:

- R U N N E → “runne” (archaic, not ideal)
- R A N G E → but A and G are excluded
- R I S E N → but I, S excluded
- R E D I E → but D, I excluded
- R U N N E → same as first
- R U C E R → but ends with R, not E
- R U P E R → ends with R
- R U L E R → ends with R
- R A N K E → A excluded

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 vowels and common consonants to maximize information gain. ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), covering 5 of the most frequent letters. This should give us good feedback to narrow down the possibilities for the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A is not in the word (x).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- O is not in the word (x).
- S is not in the word (x).
- E is in the correct position (✓) at the end.

So far we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains R somewhere other than position 2.
3. It does not contain A, O, S.

I want a new guess that:
- Keeps E in position 5.
- Uses R in a different position.
- Avoids A, O, S.
- Introduces other common letters not yet tested (T, N, I, L, C, etc.).

A good candidate is “IRATE”:
- I, T, N are new letters.
- R moves to position 2 (was position 2 in “arose”, so now it’s in position 2 again, but that’s allowed since the feedback only said it’s in the wrong position, not necessarily position 3).
Wait, no, in “arose” R was in position 2 and got “-” (wrong position), so I should put R in a different position. Let me choose “IRATE” but with R in position 3 instead: “IRATE” has R in position 2 again, which is same as before. Let me pick another word.

How about “CRATE”:
- C, T, I are new letters.
- R is in position 2 again, same as before. Not ideal.

Better word: “TIMER”:
- T, I, M are new letters.
- R is in position 5, which is correct position (E is already there), so R cannot be in 5. Not good.

Next: “TERSE” – but S is already excluded.

Another: “PERKY” – but Y is less common, and P,K not tested yet.

Better: “NERDY” – but D, Y, N, R, E. E is fixed at 5, R must not be at 2.

Let me try “UNDER”:
- U, N, D are new.
- R is in position 5, which conflicts with E at 5. Not possible.

Wait, E is fixed at position 5, so any word must end with E. Let me focus on that.

Looking for 5-letter words ending with E, containing R not in position 2, and avoiding A,O,S.

Examples: “TIMER” (R at 4), “PIPER” (but P is repeated), “CRIME” (R at 2 again), “DRIVE” (R at 2), “GRIME” (R at 2).

Let me pick “TIMER”:
- T, I, M are new letters.
- R is in position 4 (was position 2 before), so this satisfies “wrong position” from feedback.
- Ends with E as required.
- Avoids A,O,S.

This seems optimal.

Guess 2: timer -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(-) R(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word ends with E (from arose feedback).
2. R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 5 (from arose and timer feedback).
3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, O, S, T, I, M.
4. Therefore the remaining letters we can still use are among: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the already-placed E and the still-unknown positions 1,2,3,4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E
- Contains R in position 1, 3 or 4 (since 2 and 5 are ruled out)
- Uses only letters not yet excluded.

Good remaining consonants to test next are N, L, C, D, P, G, B, etc.

A high-information guess that places R in position 1 and tests new common letters is “RIDGE”:
- R in position 1 (new position for R)
- I, D, G are new letters
- Ends with E
- Avoids all excluded letters.

This should quickly narrow down where R can go and test useful new consonants.

From the three rounds we now know:

1. Word pattern: R _ _ _ E   (R in position 1, E in position 5 confirmed)
2. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, O, S, T, I, M, D, G  
3. Remaining unused common letters: B, C, F, H, K, L, N, P, U, V, W, Y

We still need to place R in position 1 and E in position 5, and fill positions 2, 3, 4 with letters from the allowed set.  
A good next guess should test several new consonants or vowels in those middle positions.  
Candidate words that fit R _ _ _ E and use only allowed letters:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 vowels and common consonants to maximize information gain. ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), covering 5 of the most frequent letters. This should give us good feedback to narrow down the possibilities for the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A is not in the word (x).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- O is not in the word (x).
- S is not in the word (x).
- E is in the correct position (✓) at the end.

So far we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains R somewhere other than position 2.
3. It does not contain A, O, S.

I want a new guess that:
- Keeps E in position 5.
- Uses R in a different position.
- Avoids A, O, S.
- Introduces other common letters not yet tested (T, N, I, L, C, etc.).

A good candidate is “IRATE”:
- I, T, N are new letters.
- R moves to position 2 (was position 2 in “arose”, so now it’s in position 2 again, but that’s allowed since the feedback only said it’s in the wrong position, not necessarily position 3).
Wait, no, in “arose” R was in position 2 and got “-” (wrong position), so I should put R in a different position. Let me choose “IRATE” but with R in position 3 instead: “IRATE” has R in position 2 again, which is same as before. Let me pick another word.

How about “CRATE”:
- C, T, I are new letters.
- R is in position 2 again, same as before. Not ideal.

Better word: “TIMER”:
- T, I, M are new letters.
- R is in position 5, which is correct position (E is already there), so R cannot be in 5. Not good.

Next: “TERSE” – but S is already excluded.

Another: “PERKY” – but Y is less common, and P,K not tested yet.

Better: “NERDY” – but D, Y, N, R, E. E is fixed at 5, R must not be at 2.

Let me try “UNDER”:
- U, N, D are new.
- R is in position 5, which conflicts with E at 5. Not possible.

Wait, E is fixed at position 5, so any word must end with E. Let me focus on that.

Looking for 5-letter words ending with E, containing R not in position 2, and avoiding A,O,S.

Examples: “TIMER” (R at 4), “PIPER” (but P is repeated), “CRIME” (R at 2 again), “DRIVE” (R at 2), “GRIME” (R at 2).

Let me pick “TIMER”:
- T, I, M are new letters.
- R is in position 4 (was position 2 before), so this satisfies “wrong position” from feedback.
- Ends with E as required.
- Avoids A,O,S.

This seems optimal.

Guess 2: timer -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(-) R(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word ends with E (from arose feedback).
2. R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 5 (from arose and timer feedback).
3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, O, S, T, I, M.
4. Therefore the remaining letters we can still use are among: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the already-placed E and the still-unknown positions 1,2,3,4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E
- Contains R in position 1, 3 or 4 (since 2 and 5 are ruled out)
- Uses only letters not yet excluded.

Good remaining consonants to test next are N, L, C, D, P, G, B, etc.

A high-information guess that places R in position 1 and tests new common letters is “RIDGE”:
- R in position 1 (new position for R)
- I, D, G are new letters
- Ends with E
- Avoids all excluded letters.

This should quickly narrow down where R can go and test useful new consonants.
