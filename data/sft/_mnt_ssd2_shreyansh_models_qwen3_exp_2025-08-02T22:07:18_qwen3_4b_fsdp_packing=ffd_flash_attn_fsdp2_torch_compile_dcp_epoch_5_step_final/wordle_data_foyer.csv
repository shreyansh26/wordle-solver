For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several letters at once. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which letters might be in the secret word.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - covering common letters in different positions. But I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's slightly more balanced.

So my first guess is AROSE.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 2).
- O(-) → O is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3).
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5).

So we know:
- The word contains R, O, E (but not in positions 2, 3, 5 respectively).
- It does NOT contain A or S.

We need a word that:
- Has R, O, E somewhere (but not in positions 2, 3, 5).
- Does not have A or S.
- Has two more letters (not A or S) to complete the 5 letters.

Let’s try to place R, O, E in new positions:
- R cannot be in position 2 → could be 1, 3, 4, 5.
- O cannot be in position 3 → could be 1, 2, 4, 5.
- E cannot be in position 5 → could be 1, 2, 3, 4.

A good candidate is ""ROGER"":
- Contains R, O, E (R twice, O once, E once).
- R is in positions 1 and 4 (neither is 2).
- O is in position 2 (not 3).
- E is in position 4 (not 5).
- Does not contain A or S.

This seems like a solid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several letters at once. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which letters might be in the secret word.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - covering common letters in different positions. But I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's slightly more balanced.

So my first guess is AROSE.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 2).
- O(-) → O is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3).
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5).

So we know:
- The word contains R, O, E (but not in positions 2, 3, 5 respectively).
- It does NOT contain A or S.

We need a word that:
- Has R, O, E somewhere (but not in positions 2, 3, 5).
- Does not have A or S.
- Has two more letters (not A or S) to complete the 5 letters.

Let’s try to place R, O, E in new positions:
- R cannot be in position 2 → could be 1, 3, 4, 5.
- O cannot be in position 3 → could be 1, 2, 4, 5.
- E cannot be in position 5 → could be 1, 2, 3, 4.

A good candidate is ""ROGER"":
- Contains R, O, E (R twice, O once, E once).
- R is in positions 1 and 4 (neither is 2).
- O is in position 2 (not 3).
- E is in position 4 (not 5).
- Does not contain A or S.

This seems like a solid next guess.

From the new feedback on ROGER:
- R(-) → R is still in the word but not in position 1.
- O(✓) → O is in the word and is in position 2.
- G(x) → G is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and is in position 4.
- R(✓) → R is in the word and is in position 5.

So now we know:
- Position 2 = O
- Position 4 = E
- Position 5 = R
- Letters we have: O, E, R
- Letters we do NOT have: A, S, G
- We need two more letters (not A, S, G) to fill positions 1 and 3.

We also know:
- R is in position 5, so the first R in ROGER (position 1) was wrong, but the second R (position 5) is correct. This means the word ends with ""OR"".

So the word has the pattern: _ O _ E R

Now we need to pick a letter for position 1 and position 3, excluding A, S, G.

Possible letters for positions 1 and 3 (excluding A, S, G): B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try to pick a common combination. A good candidate is ""BOWER"":
- B for position 1
- O in position 2 (known)
- W for position 3
- E in position 4 (known)
- R in position 5 (known)

Check:
- Contains O, E, R in correct positions.
- Does not contain A, S, G.
- Uses new letters B and W.

This seems like a strong next guess.

Known facts after four guesses:

1. Fixed letters:
   - Position 2 = O
   - Position 4 = E
   - Position 5 = R

   Word pattern: _ O _ E R

2. Eliminated letters (never appear in the word):
   A, S, G, B, W, H, M

3. We still need letters for positions 1 and 3, chosen from the remaining alphabet (excluding the eliminated ones).

   Remaining consonants for positions 1 and 3 (among others): C, D, F, I, K, L, N, P, T, U, V, Y, etc.

4. We need a valid 5-letter English word that matches _ O _ E R and uses only the allowed letters.

   Let’s list some candidates:
   - COPER (C, O, P, E, R) – C and P are allowed.
   - DOPEY (but ends with Y, not R).
   - FOCUS (but ends with S, not R).
   - LOPER (L, O, P, E, R) – L and P are allowed.
   - POPER (but P is allowed, O, P, E, R – but “POPER” is not a standard word).
   - TOPER (T, O, P, E, R) – T and P are allowed.

   The most straightforward and common word among these is COPER.

Let’s verify:
- C for position 1 – not eliminated.
- O in position 2 – fixed.

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several letters at once. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which letters might be in the secret word.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - covering common letters in different positions. But I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's slightly more balanced.

So my first guess is AROSE.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 2).
- O(-) → O is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3).
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5).

So we know:
- The word contains R, O, E (but not in positions 2, 3, 5 respectively).
- It does NOT contain A or S.

We need a word that:
- Has R, O, E somewhere (but not in positions 2, 3, 5).
- Does not have A or S.
- Has two more letters (not A or S) to complete the 5 letters.

Let’s try to place R, O, E in new positions:
- R cannot be in position 2 → could be 1, 3, 4, 5.
- O cannot be in position 3 → could be 1, 2, 4, 5.
- E cannot be in position 5 → could be 1, 2, 3, 4.

A good candidate is ""ROGER"":
- Contains R, O, E (R twice, O once, E once).
- R is in positions 1 and 4 (neither is 2).
- O is in position 2 (not 3).
- E is in position 4 (not 5).
- Does not contain A or S.

This seems like a solid next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: ROGER -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on ROGER:
- R(-) → R is still in the word but not in position 1.
- O(✓) → O is in the word and is in position 2.
- G(x) → G is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and is in position 4.
- R(✓) → R is in the word and is in position 5.

So now we know:
- Position 2 = O
- Position 4 = E
- Position 5 = R
- Letters we have: O, E, R
- Letters we do NOT have: A, S, G
- We need two more letters (not A, S, G) to fill positions 1 and 3.

We also know:
- R is in position 5, so the first R in ROGER (position 1) was wrong, but the second R (position 5) is correct. This means the word ends with ""OR"".

So the word has the pattern: _ O _ E R

Now we need to pick a letter for position 1 and position 3, excluding A, S, G.

Possible letters for positions 1 and 3 (excluding A, S, G): B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try to pick a common combination. A good candidate is ""BOWER"":
- B for position 1
- O in position 2 (known)
- W for position 3
- E in position 4 (known)
- R in position 5 (known)

Check:
- Contains O, E, R in correct positions.
- Does not contain A, S, G.
- Uses new letters B and W.

This seems like a strong next guess.

Guess 3: BOWER -> FEEDBACK: B(x) O(✓) W(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on BOWER:
- B(x) → B is NOT in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in the word and is in position 2 (confirmed again).
- W(x) → W is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and is in position 4 (confirmed again).
- R(✓) → R is in the word and is in position 5 (confirmed again).

So the known pattern is: _ O _ E R

Letters we now know are NOT in the word: A, S, G, B, W  
Letters we know are in the word and in their correct positions: O (pos 2), E (pos 4), R (pos 5)

We still need letters for positions 1 and 3, excluding A, S, G, B, W.

Common remaining consonants for these spots: C, D, F, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, Y, etc.

Let’s look for a word that fits _ O _ E R and uses only allowed letters. A good candidate is ""FOGER"":
- F for position 1 (not previously excluded)
- O in position 2 (correct)
- G is excluded (from G(x) in ROGER), so this would fail.

Next candidate: ""HOMER"":
- H for position 1
- O in position 2
- M for position 3
- E in position 4
- R in position 5
G is excluded, but G isn’t in HOMER, so this is fine.

But let’s check if any letters in HOMER are excluded:
- H: allowed
- O: allowed (known)
- M: allowed
- E: allowed (known)
- R: allowed (known)

HOMER uses new letters H and M, neither of which have been excluded yet.

Another candidate: ""DOPER"":
- D for position 1
- O in position 2
- P for position 3
- E in position 4
- R in position 5

Check exclusions:
- D, O, P, E, R: none are excluded.

Between HOMER and DOPER, both fit. HOMER is more common, so I’ll go with that.
