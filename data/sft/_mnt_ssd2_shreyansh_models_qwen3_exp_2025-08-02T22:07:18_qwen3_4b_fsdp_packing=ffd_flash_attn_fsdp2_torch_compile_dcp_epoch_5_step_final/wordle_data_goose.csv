### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

From the feedback on “arose” we know:

- O, S, E are in the word and in the correct positions 3, 4, 5.
- A and R are not in the word at all.

Some candidates: “POSE”, “MOSE”, “GOSE”, “LOSE”, “NOSE”, “VOICE”, “DOSE”, etc.

I’ll pick “VOICE” because it introduces new consonants (V, C) and a new vowel (I) in the first two positions. This should help determine the correct placement of V, C, and whether I is in the word.

(Note: “VOICE” is valid because it ends in “OSE” and avoids A and R.)

None of these combinations form valid 5-letter words ending in “OSE” without using ruled-out letters. This suggests I need to revisit the assumption that both positions must be consonants. However, all remaining vowels are ruled out (A, E, I, O, U), so position 1 or 2 could be a consonant and the other a consonant or a vowel, but vowels are all ruled out. Therefore, both positions must be consonants.

Looking back at the ruled-out letters: A, R, V, I, C, M, U. The remaining consonants are indeed all listed above. 

But none of these form valid words. This implies I may have missed a word or made an error in elimination. Let me double-check:

Valid 5-letter words ending in “OSE”:
- BOOSE (contains O, but is it valid? Yes, slang for “boss”)  
- DOOSE (valid, variant of “dose”)  
- FOOSE (valid, old word for “fuss”)  
- GOOSE (valid)  
- JOUSE (valid, variant of “joke”)  
- LOUSE (valid)  
- NOOSE (valid)  
- POOSE (valid, variant of “pose”)  
- SOOSE (valid, variant of “souse”)  
- TOOSE (valid, variant of “toe”)  
- VOOSE (invalid, V is ruled out)  
- WOOSE (valid, old word for “woe”)  
- YOUSE (valid, variant of “yoke”)  
- ZOOSE (invalid, Z is uncommon but possible)

From these, the valid ones not containing any ruled-out letters are:  
- BOOSE (B, O, S, E—O is in position 3, which is confirmed)  
- DOOSE (D, O, S, E)  
- FOOSE (F, O, S, E)  
- GOOSE (G, O, S, E)  
- LOUSE (L, O, S, E)  
- NOOSE (N, O, S, E)  
- POOSE (P, O, S, E)  
- SOOSE (S, O, S, E)  
- TOOSE (T, O, S, E)  
- WOOSE (W, O, S, E)  
- YOUSE (Y, O, S, E)

Among these, “GOOSE” is the most common word. I’ll go with “GOOSE” as the next guess.

<guess>goose</guess>",goose,"We now know the word ends in “OSE” and the letters **not** in the word are:  
A, R, V, I, C, M, U.

So the pattern is: _ _ O S E  
Allowed letters for positions 1 and 2 (excluding A, R, V, I, C, M, U).

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, S, T, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: none (A, E, I, O, U are all either confirmed or ruled out).

We need a 5-letter word ending in “OSE” that uses only the remaining letters.
