For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has a good mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. The goal is to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A strong starting word typically includes:

1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to test as many unique letters as possible

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good spread of letters to work with.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word (x)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is not in the word (x)
- T is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓)

So we know:
1. E is the last letter (position 5)
2. L is somewhere in the word but not in position 2
3. S, A, T are not in the word at all

A good next guess should:
- Keep the confirmed E in position 5
- Move L to a new position
- Introduce new common consonants and vowels not yet tested
- Avoid S, A, T

Possible candidates: 
- ""FLUME"" - but T is out, so F, L, U, M, E
- ""CLERK"" - but T is out, and we need to test new letters
- ""OLDER"" - but T is out, and we need to test new letters

Let's choose ""OLDER"":
- Keeps E in position 5
- Moves L to position 2 (was position 2 in SLATE, so now testing position 2 again is okay since position was wrong before but now we're retesting)
- Introduces O, D, R which are common letters not yet tested
- Avoids S, A, T

Actually, let me reconsider. In SLATE, L was in position 2 and marked as wrong position, so in ""OLDER"" L is in position 2 again. That's okay because we need to test if it's in another position. But to maximize information, maybe it's better to move L to a new position.

Let me choose ""MELON"":
- Keeps E in position 5
- Moves L to position 3
- Introduces M, O, N which are common letters not yet tested
- Avoids S, A, T

This seems better as it tests new letters and moves L to a new position.

- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- N(x) – N is not in the word.

Confirmed facts so far:
- Letters in the word: E, L

- E cannot be in position 2 or 5, so it must be in 1, 3, or 4.
- L cannot be in position 2 or 3, so it must be in 1, 4, or 5.

We need a word that:
- Contains only the remaining letters (no S, A, T, M, O, N).
- Places E and L in allowed positions.
- Introduces new common consonants not yet tested (e.g., R, D, C, B, G, H, etc.).

Let’s try “RELIC”:
- R – new letter
- E – allowed in position 2? No, E cannot be in 2. So RELIC is invalid.
  
Try “CIDER”:
- C – new letter
- I – new vowel

1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to test as many unique letters as possible

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

A good next guess should:
- Keep the confirmed E in position 5
- Move L to a new position
- Introduce new common consonants and vowels not yet tested
- Avoid S, A, T

Possible candidates: 
- ""FLUME"" - but T is out, so F, L, U, M, E
- ""CLERK"" - but T is out, and we need to test new letters
- ""OLDER"" - but T is out, and we need to test new letters

Let's choose ""OLDER"":
- Keeps E in position 5
- Moves L to position 2 (was position 2 in SLATE, so now testing position 2 again is okay since position was wrong before but now we're retesting)
- Introduces O, D, R which are common letters not yet tested
- Avoids S, A, T

Actually, let me reconsider. In SLATE, L was in position 2 and marked as wrong position, so in ""OLDER"" L is in position 2 again. That's okay because we need to test if it's in another position. But to maximize information, maybe it's better to move L to a new position.

Let me choose ""MELON"":
- Keeps E in position 5
- Moves L to position 3
- Introduces M, O, N which are common letters not yet tested
- Avoids S, A, T

This seems better as it tests new letters and moves L to a new position.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: MELON -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(-) L(-) O(x) N(x)

From the new feedback on MELON:

- M(x) – M is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 2 (it was position 5 in SLATE, so now we know it’s not in 2 or 5).
- L(-) – L is in the word but NOT in position 3 (it was in position 2 in SLATE and now position 3, so it must be in 1, 4, or 5).
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- N(x) – N is not in the word.

Confirmed facts so far:
- Letters in the word: E, L
- Letters out: S, A, T, M, O, N
- E cannot be in position 2 or 5, so it must be in 1, 3, or 4.
- L cannot be in position 2 or 3, so it must be in 1, 4, or 5.

We need a word that:
- Contains only the remaining letters (no S, A, T, M, O, N).
- Places E and L in allowed positions.
- Introduces new common consonants not yet tested (e.g., R, D, C, B, G, H, etc.).

Let’s try “RELIC”:
- R – new letter
- E – allowed in position 2? No, E cannot be in 2. So RELIC is invalid.
  
Try “CIDER”:
- C – new letter
- I – new vowel
- D – new letter
- E – allowed in position 4
- R – new letter
But L is missing. We must include L.

Try “ELDER”:
- E – allowed in position 1
- L – allowed in position 2? No, L cannot be in 2. Invalid.

Try “FLIER”:
- F – new letter
- L – allowed in position 2? No, L cannot be in 2. Invalid.

Try “BELIE”:
- B – new letter
- E – allowed in position 1
- L – allowed in position 3? No, L cannot be in 3. Invalid.

Try “CLERK”:
- C – new letter
- L – allowed in position 2? No. Invalid.

Try “WIELD”:
- W – new letter
- I – new vowel
- E – allowed in position 3
- L – allowed in position 4
- D – new letter
This fits all constraints:
- Contains E and L in allowed positions.
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.
- Introduces W, I, D.

So “WIELD” is a good next guess.

From the latest feedback on WIELD:

- W(x) – W is not in the word.
- I(✓) – I is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 3 (it was position 5 in SLATE, then position 2 in MELON, now position 3 in WIELD, so E must be in 1, 4, or 5).
- L(✓) – L is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- D(x) – D is not in the word.

Confirmed facts:
- Letters in the word: I (position 2), L (position 4), E (somewhere else: 1, 3, or 5)
- Letters out: S, A, T, M, O, N, W, D
- Remaining common letters not yet tested: R, C, B, G, H, F, K, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- I fixed in position 2
- L fixed in position 4
- E must appear once more in 1, 3, or 5
- No eliminated letters

Possible patterns: _ I _ L _ with E in 1, 3, or 5.

Let’s test E in position 1: E I _ L _
Possible words: EIDER (D is out), EIKEL (invalid), EICEL (invalid) – nothing valid.

Test E in position 3: _ I E L _
Possible words: C I E L E (invalid), B I E L L (invalid), F I E L D (D out), R I E L S (S out), H I E L L (invalid) – nothing valid.

Test E in position 5: _ I _ L E

“B I B L E” – valid word “BIBLE” but L is in 4, so B I B L E – fits: B I B L E
Check constraints:
- B – new letter
- I – fixed in 2
- B – new letter
- L – fixed in 4
- E – allowed in 5 (was in 5 in SLATE, but marked ✓, so E is in 5. But in SLATE, E was in 5 and ✓, so E is in 5. But in MELON, E was in 2 and marked -, so E is not in 2. In WIELD, E was in 3 and marked -, so E is not in 3. So E must be in 1, 4, or 5. But L is in 4, so E must be in 1 or 5. In SLATE, E was in 5 and ✓, so E is in 5. So E must be in 5. So word must be _ I _ L E. So “BIBLE” is B I B L E – fits _ I _ L E. Let me check if BIBLE is valid: yes, it’s a common word.

So “BIBLE” fits all constraints:
- I in 2 ✓
- L in 4 ✓
- E in 5 ✓
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated
- Introduces B (new letter)

Therefore, next guess is “BIBLE”.

This is extremely restrictive. Let me try a different letter combination.

We have I in 2, L in 4, and E must appear once more. Let me try E in position 5: _ I _ L E

Let me try “F I B L E” – not valid.
“B I B L E” – valid word “BIBLE” but L is in 4, so B I B L E – fits: B I B L E
Check constraints:
- B – new letter
- I – fixed in 2
- B – new letter
- L – fixed in 4
- E – allowed in 5 (was in 5 in SLATE, but marked ✓, so E is in 5. But in SLATE, E was in 5 and ✓, so E is in 5. But in MELON, E was in 2 and marked -, so E is not in 2. In WIELD, E was in 3 and marked -, so E is not in 3. So E must be in 1, 4, or 5. But L is in 4, so E must be in 1 or 5. In SLATE, E was in 5 and ✓, so E is in 5. So E must be in 5. So word must be _ I _ L E. So “BIBLE” is B I B L E – fits _ I _ L E. Let me check if BIBLE is valid: yes, it’s a common word.

So “BIBLE” fits all constraints:
- I in 2 ✓
- L in 4 ✓
- E in 5 ✓
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated
- Introduces B (new letter)

Therefore, next guess is “BIBLE”.",Guess 4: BIBLE -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) I(✓) B(✓) L(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
