### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. A strong starting word often includes multiple vowels and frequently used consonants. 

After considering options like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" and ""AROSE,"" I think ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps test vowel positions
- 2 common consonants (R, S) which appear frequently in 5-letter words
- This combination gives good coverage of common letters while testing vowel-heavy possibilities

From the two guesses we have:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - Letters not in the word: A, R, S, E
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.

2. point → P(-) O(-) I(✓) N(x) T(x)
   - Letters not in the word: N, T (in addition to A, R, S, E)
   - I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
   - P and O are in the word but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.

So the secret word:
- Has I fixed in position 3.
- Contains both P and O, but:
  - P is not in position 1.
  - O is not in position 2 (and also not in position 3, from the first guess).
- Does not contain A, R, S, E, N, T.

Letters still available (excluding the banned ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the confirmed I in position 3.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- I in position 3.
- P somewhere not position 1.
- O somewhere not positions 2 or 3.
- No other banned letters.

Let's try to construct a word:
- Position 3: I
- Position 1: Could be C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, etc.
- Position 2: Must be O (since O can't be in positions 2, 3, or 1 in this case? Wait, no: O can be in positions 1, 4, or 5, but not 2 or 3. From the first guess, O is in the word but not position 3. From the second guess, O is not in position 2. So O must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- Position 4 or 5: Could be O if needed.

Let's try ""COPHY"":
- C (position 1) - allowed
- O (position 2) - but this is banned because O can't be in position 2. So this is invalid.

Alternative: ""FOCAL"" - but A is banned.

Alternative: ""POLYP"" - but P and O positions might not fit, and Y is allowed.

Wait, let's think systematically:
We need:
- I in position 3.
- P somewhere not position 1.
- O somewhere not positions 2 or 3.

Possible positions:
- O could be in 1, 4, or 5.
- P could be in 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 1).

Let's try O in position 1:
- Word starts with O, has I in position 3, and contains P somewhere else.
  - Example: O _ I _ _ with P in 2,4, or 5.
  - ""OPINI"" - but N is banned.
  - ""OPIFY"" - F and Y are allowed, but let's check:
    - O P I F Y
    - P is in position 2 (allowed, since P isn't in position 1).
    - O is in position 1 (allowed, since it's not 2 or 3).
    - I is in position 3 (correct).
    - Letters used: O, P, I, F, Y - none are banned.
    - This seems valid.

Another option with O in position 4:
- _ _ I O _ with P in 2 or 5.
  - ""UPION"" - N is banned.
  - ""HIPPO"" - double P and O positions, but O is in 4 (allowed), P in 5 (allowed), but H is allowed. But ""HIPPO"" has P in 2 and 5, which might not be optimal.

""OPIFY"" seems better as it tests new letters (F, Y) and fits all constraints.

But let me double-check:
- OPIFY:
  - O: position 1 (allowed, not 2 or 3)
  - P: position 2 (allowed, not 1)
  - I: position 3 (correct)
  - F: new letter, allowed
  - Y: new letter, allowed
- No banned letters (A, R, S, E, N, T).

So ""OPIFY"" is a strong next guess.

   - O is in the word but not in position 3.

2. point → P(-) O(-) I(✓) N(x) T(x)
   - Letters not in the word: N, T (in addition to A, R, S, E)
   - I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
   - P and O are in the word but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.

So the secret word:
- Has I fixed in position 3.
- Contains both P and O, but:
  - P is not in position 1.
  - O is not in position 2 (and also not in position 3, from the first guess).
- Does not contain A, R, S, E, N, T.

Letters still available (excluding the banned ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the confirmed I in position 3.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- I in position 3.
- P somewhere not position 1.
- O somewhere not positions 2 or 3.
- No other banned letters.

Let's try to construct a word:
- Position 3: I
- Position 1: Could be C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, etc.
- Position 2: Must be O (since O can't be in positions 2, 3, or 1 in this case? Wait, no: O can be in positions 1, 4, or 5, but not 2 or 3. From the first guess, O is in the word but not position 3. From the second guess, O is not in position 2. So O must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- Position 4 or 5: Could be O if needed.

Let's try ""COPHY"":
- C (position 1) - allowed
- O (position 2) - but this is banned because O can't be in position 2. So this is invalid.

Alternative: ""FOCAL"" - but A is banned.

Alternative: ""POLYP"" - but P and O positions might not fit, and Y is allowed.

Wait, let's think systematically:
We need:
- I in position 3.
- P somewhere not position 1.
- O somewhere not positions 2 or 3.

Possible positions:
- O could be in 1, 4, or 5.
- P could be in 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 1).

Let's try O in position 1:
- Word starts with O, has I in position 3, and contains P somewhere else.
  - Example: O _ I _ _ with P in 2,4, or 5.
  - ""OPINI"" - but N is banned.
  - ""OPIFY"" - F and Y are allowed, but let's check:
    - O P I F Y
    - P is in position 2 (allowed, since P isn't in position 1).
    - O is in position 1 (allowed, since it's not 2 or 3).
    - I is in position 3 (correct).
    - Letters used: O, P, I, F, Y - none are banned.
    - This seems valid.

Another option with O in position 4:
- _ _ I O _ with P in 2 or 5.
  - ""UPION"" - N is banned.
  - ""HIPPO"" - double P and O positions, but O is in 4 (allowed), P in 5 (allowed), but H is allowed. But ""HIPPO"" has P in 2 and 5, which might not be optimal.

""OPIFY"" seems better as it tests new letters (F, Y) and fits all constraints.

But let me double-check:
- OPIFY:
  - O: position 1 (allowed, not 2 or 3)
  - P: position 2 (allowed, not 1)
  - I: position 3 (correct)
  - F: new letter, allowed
  - Y: new letter, allowed
- No banned letters (A, R, S, E, N, T).

So ""OPIFY"" is a strong next guess.

From the new feedback on ""opify"":
- O is now confirmed in position 1 (✓)
- P is confirmed in position 2 (✓)
- I is confirmed in position 3 (✓)
- F and Y are NOT in the word (x)

So far we know:
1. Word starts with OPI...
2. Must be 5 letters.
3. Cannot contain A, R, S, E, N, T, F, Y.

Letters still allowed (besides O, P, I already placed):
B, C, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, U, V, W, X, Z

We need to fill positions 4 and 5 with two different letters from the allowed set.

Possible endings:
- OPI_B or OPI__ with two more letters.

Let's think of common 5-letter words starting with ""OPI"" that don't use any banned letters:
- OPIUM - U and M are allowed
- OPIATE - A is banned (already excluded)
- OPIGY - Y is banned
- OPILOT - T is banned
- OPILUS - S is banned
- OPIUM is the only common word that fits.

Let's verify OPIUM:
- O P I U M
- U and M are not in the banned list.
- All letters are allowed based on prior feedback.

This seems to be the only logical word left that fits all constraints.
