### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, U, I. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)

This gives us maximum coverage of high-frequency letters to quickly narrow down possibilities for the second guess.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A is in the word and in the correct first position.
- O is in the word and in the correct third position.
- R, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is:
A _ O _ _   (with the remaining three slots filled by letters we haven’t ruled out yet).

Letters still available (excluding R, S, E): most of the alphabet minus those three.  
To maximize information on the next turn, I want a word that:
1. Keeps A and O fixed in positions 1 and 3.
2. Uses new common consonants and vowels we haven’t tried yet (T, L, N, I, D, C, etc.).

A simple, high-information choice that fits is “ADOPT”:
- Keeps A and O in their correct places.
- Introduces D, P, T (common consonants) and the new vowel I (though I is already in AROSE feedback so I should avoid it; let me pick another word).

Better choice: “ALONE” – but E is already ruled out.  
Next best: “ADOPT” still uses P and T which are fine.

Actually, let me pick “ADOPT” because it introduces three new consonants (D, P, T) and keeps A and O locked in place.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, U, I. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)

This gives us maximum coverage of high-frequency letters to quickly narrow down possibilities for the second guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A is in the word and in the correct first position.
- O is in the word and in the correct third position.
- R, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is:
A _ O _ _   (with the remaining three slots filled by letters we haven’t ruled out yet).

Letters still available (excluding R, S, E): most of the alphabet minus those three.  
To maximize information on the next turn, I want a word that:
1. Keeps A and O fixed in positions 1 and 3.
2. Uses new common consonants and vowels we haven’t tried yet (T, L, N, I, D, C, etc.).

A simple, high-information choice that fits is “ADOPT”:
- Keeps A and O in their correct places.
- Introduces D, P, T (common consonants) and the new vowel I (though I is already in AROSE feedback so I should avoid it; let me pick another word).

Better choice: “ALONE” – but E is already ruled out.  
Next best: “ADOPT” still uses P and T which are fine.

Actually, let me pick “ADOPT” because it introduces three new consonants (D, P, T) and keeps A and O locked in place.

Guess 2: adopt -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) D(x) O(✓) P(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. arose → A(✓) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
   - A is fixed in position 1.
   - O is fixed in position 3.
   - R, S, E are not in the word.

2. adopt → A(✓) D(x) O(✓) P(x) T(x)
   - Confirms A and O in the same positions.
   - Rules out D, P, T.

So the pattern is still:
A _ O _ _

Letters ruled out so far: R, S, E, D, P, T.

Remaining common consonants: N, L, C, G, B, F, H, K, M, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining common vowels: I, U (A and O are already placed).

We need a 5-letter word with A _ O _ _ that uses none of the ruled-out letters and introduces new common letters.

Good candidates:
- ALOOF (but F and L are new, but O is repeated which might not help)
- AFOUL (uses F, U, L - all new)
- ABOIL (uses B, I, L - but I is a vowel we haven't used yet)
- ACORN - but R is ruled out
- AFOOT - but T is ruled out
- ACOUST - but S and T are ruled out

Best choice seems ""ABOIL"" as it introduces B, I, L - all new and common.
