### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that appears frequently in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are present in the secret word.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's widely considered an optimal starting word.

From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - Letters absent so far: A, S, E
   - Letters present somewhere: R, O

2. ROUND → R(-) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)
   - Letters absent so far (new): U, N, D
   - Letters present somewhere (confirmed again): R, O
   - R cannot be in position 1 (was in position 1 in ROUND but marked “-” again)
   - O cannot be in position 2 (was in position 2 in ROUND but marked “-” again)

So:
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 2.
- O is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3.
- Absent letters: A, S, E, U, N, D.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains R and O
- R must be in positions 3, 4, or 5
- O must be in positions 1, 4, or 5 (cannot be 2 or 3)
- Does NOT contain A, S, E, U, N, D

Good remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Good remaining vowels: I, Y (since O is already confirmed, we might still need I)

Let’s try to place R and O in new positions and fill the rest with common letters not yet ruled out.

Option: R in position 3, O in position 1 → O _ R _ _

Let’s pick a word that fits: ORBIT – but B and T are allowed, but I is allowed. However, we need to check letters used so far: B is new, T is new, I is new. But O is in position 1 (new), R is in position 3 (new). Let’s see:

But ORBIT uses I, B, T – all new letters. However, we have no info on I, B, T yet. This seems risky because we’re introducing three new letters at once.

Better to introduce one or two new letters while keeping R and O in new positions.

Alternative: R in position 5, O in position 4 → _ _ _ _ R and O in 4? No, O must be in 1, 4, or 5. Let’s try O in 4 and R in 5: _ _ _ O R

A word like “CROOR” – but double O is unlikely. “GROOR” – also unlikely. “MORPH” – uses M, P, H, but H is new.

Another approach: R in position 4, O in position 1: O _ _ R _

Word: OX R… not working. How about “CORGI”? C, O, R, G, I – but G and I are new, and O in 2 is ruled out.

Wait, O must not be in position 2 or 3. So O can be in 1, 4, or 5.

Let’s try O in position 5 and R in position 4: _ _ _ _ O with R in 4: _ _ R _ O

A word like “CRIRO” – no, not valid. “BRIRO” – invalid. “FRIRO” – invalid.

Alternative: O in position 1 and R in position 4: O _ _ R _

Word: “OCEAN” – uses E (ruled out). “OBORN” – uses N (ruled out). “OVINE” – uses N, E (ruled out).

Alternative: O in position 4, R in position 5: _ _ _ O R

Word: “TIGOR” – uses T, I, G. All new letters. Seems valid.

Check letters:

- I – new
- G – new
- O – confirmed present, in position 4 (was not in 2 or 3, so ok)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that appears frequently in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are present in the secret word.

From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - Letters absent so far: A, S, E
   - Letters present somewhere: R, O

2. ROUND → R(-) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)
   - Letters absent so far (new): U, N, D
   - Letters present somewhere (confirmed again): R, O
   - R cannot be in position 1 (was in position 1 in ROUND but marked “-” again)
   - O cannot be in position 2 (was in position 2 in ROUND but marked “-” again)

So:
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 2.
- O is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3.
- Absent letters: A, S, E, U, N, D.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains R and O
- R must be in positions 3, 4, or 5
- O must be in positions 1, 4, or 5 (cannot be 2 or 3)
- Does NOT contain A, S, E, U, N, D

Good remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Good remaining vowels: I, Y (since O is already confirmed, we might still need I)

Let’s try to place R and O in new positions and fill the rest with common letters not yet ruled out.

Option: R in position 3, O in position 1 → O _ R _ _

Let’s pick a word that fits: ORBIT – but B and T are allowed, but I is allowed. However, we need to check letters used so far: B is new, T is new, I is new. But O is in position 1 (new), R is in position 3 (new). Let’s see:

But ORBIT uses I, B, T – all new letters. However, we have no info on I, B, T yet. This seems risky because we’re introducing three new letters at once.

Better to introduce one or two new letters while keeping R and O in new positions.

Alternative: R in position 5, O in position 4 → _ _ _ _ R and O in 4? No, O must be in 1, 4, or 5. Let’s try O in 4 and R in 5: _ _ _ O R

A word like “CROOR” – but double O is unlikely. “GROOR” – also unlikely. “MORPH” – uses M, P, H, but H is new.

Another approach: R in position 4, O in position 1: O _ _ R _

Word: OX R… not working. How about “CORGI”? C, O, R, G, I – but G and I are new, and O in 2 is ruled out.

Wait, O must not be in position 2 or 3. So O can be in 1, 4, or 5.

Let’s try O in position 5 and R in position 4: _ _ _ _ O with R in 4: _ _ R _ O

A word like “CRIRO” – no, not valid. “BRIRO” – invalid. “FRIRO” – invalid.

Alternative: O in position 1 and R in position 4: O _ _ R _

Word: “OCEAN” – uses E (ruled out). “OBORN” – uses N (ruled out). “OVINE” – uses N, E (ruled out).

Alternative: O in position 4, R in position 5: _ _ _ O R

Word: “TIGOR” – uses T, I, G. All new letters. Seems valid.

Check letters:
- T – new
- I – new
- G – new
- O – confirmed present, in position 4 (was not in 2 or 3, so ok)
- R – confirmed present, in position 5 (was not in 1 or 2, so ok)

No ruled-out letters used. This seems like a good guess.

From the latest feedback on TIGOR:
- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- I(✓) – I is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- G(✓) – G is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- R(✓) – R is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So the secret word has the pattern:
_ I G O R

We only need to determine the first letter.  
Letters already ruled out (from all previous guesses):  
A, S, E, U, N, D, T

Remaining common consonants for the first position: B, C, F, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

The most common 5-letter words ending in ""IGOR"" are:
BIGOR – not a valid word
CIGOR – not a valid word
FIGOR – not a valid word
HIGOR – not a valid word
MIGOR – not a valid word
PIGOR – not a valid word
VIGOR – valid word

""VIGOR"" fits perfectly:
- Starts with V (not yet ruled out)
- Matches the confirmed pattern _ I G O R

Therefore, the correct guess is VIGOR.
