For my first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should ideally use 5 distinct letters from this set to help eliminate or confirm many possibilities early on.

Looking at these common letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a high chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word, providing valuable feedback for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position.
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word.

So the secret word ends in E and contains none of A, R, O, S.  
I need a 5-letter word that ends in E and avoids A, R, O, S.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, H, M, P, B, F, G, K, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are ruled out).

A strong second guess should introduce new common letters while respecting the constraints.  
“untie” would conflict with R and S indirectly (but not directly), yet “elite” repeats E uselessly.  
“until” is invalid (ends in L).  
“elite” repeats E.  
“input” contains P and U, both common and not yet tested.  
“input” ends in T, not E.

Let me pick a word that ends in E, contains new common letters, and avoids A, R, O, S.

“input” → ends in T, so discard.  
“elite” → ends in E, but repeats E and uses I, L, T.  
“elite” uses E in position 5 (✓), and introduces I, L, T.

But “elite” uses E in position 1 and 5 – we already know E is in position 5, but duplicates aren’t ruled out. However, it’s better to avoid duplicate letters in guesses to maximize new info.

Another candidate: “untie” – but ends in E, uses U, N, T, I.  
“untie” ends in E, avoids A, R, O, S, and introduces U, N, T, I.

Let’s go with “untie”.

The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should ideally use 5 distinct letters from this set to help eliminate or confirm many possibilities early on.\n\nLooking at these common letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:\n- A (very common vowel)\n- R (common consonant)\n- O (common vowel)\n- S (common consonant)\n- E (most common letter in English)\n\nThis combination gives us a high chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word, providing valuable feedback for subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>arose</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on “arose”:\n- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position.\n- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word.\n\nSo the secret word ends in E and contains none of A, R, O, S.  \nI need a 5-letter word that ends in E and avoids A, R, O, S.\n\nGood remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, H, M, P, B, F, G, K, etc.  \nGood remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are ruled out).\n\nA strong second guess should introduce new common letters while respecting the constraints.  \n“untie” would conflict with R and S indirectly (but not directly), yet “elite” repeats E uselessly.  \n“until” is invalid (ends in L).  \n“elite” repeats E.  \n“input” contains P and U, both common and not yet tested.  \n“input” ends in T, not E.\n\nLet me pick a word that ends in E, contains new common letters, and avoids A, R, O, S.\n\n“input” → ends in T, so discard.  \n“elite” → ends in E, but repeats E and uses I, L, T.  \n“elite” uses E in position 5 (✓), and introduces I, L, T.\n\nBut “elite” uses E in position 1 and 5 – we already know E is in position 5, but duplicates aren’t ruled out.

Current knowledge:
- Position 5 is E (✓).
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, C, Y, D.
- Letters known to be in the word:
  - L is in the word and is in position 2 (✓).
- Therefore the word has the form: _ L _ _ E
- Remaining unused common consonants: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z
- Remaining unused vowels: none except E (since A, O, U, I are out, and Y is out too)

So we need a 5-letter word with:
- Position 2 = L
- Position 5 = E
- No A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, C, Y, D
- The first, third, and fourth letters must be chosen from the remaining consonants and must form a valid word.

Possible letters for positions 1, 3, 4: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

Let’s think of words that fit _ L _ _ E:
- B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z for positions 1, 3, 4.

Some possibilities:
- FLAME – but A and M are allowed? A is out.
- GLUME – U is out.
- BLIME – I is out.
- FRAME – A is out.
- GLIDE – I, D are out.
- SLIME – S, I, D are out.
- SLIME is out due to S, I, D.

Looking at remaining consonants:
Let me try to find words with remaining letters.

Possible word: F L O W E – O is out.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should ideally use 5 distinct letters from this set to help eliminate or confirm many possibilities early on.

Looking at these common letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a high chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word, providing valuable feedback for subsequent guesses.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position.
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word.

So the secret word ends in E and contains none of A, R, O, S.  
I need a 5-letter word that ends in E and avoids A, R, O, S.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, H, M, P, B, F, G, K, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are ruled out).

A strong second guess should introduce new common letters while respecting the constraints.  
“untie” would conflict with R and S indirectly (but not directly), yet “elite” repeats E uselessly.  
“until” is invalid (ends in L).  
“elite” repeats E.  
“input” contains P and U, both common and not yet tested.  
“input” ends in T, not E.

Let me pick a word that ends in E, contains new common letters, and avoids A, R, O, S.

“input” → ends in T, so discard.  
“elite” → ends in E, but repeats E and uses I, L, T.  
“elite” uses E in position 5 (✓), and introduces I, L, T.

But “elite” uses E in position 1 and 5 – we already know E is in position 5, but duplicates aren’t ruled out. However, it’s better to avoid duplicate letters in guesses to maximize new info.

Another candidate: “untie” – but ends in E, uses U, N, T, I.  
“untie” ends in E, avoids A, R, O, S, and introduces U, N, T, I.

Let’s go with “untie”.

Guess 2: untie -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(x) I(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we know:

- The word ends in E (position 5 has ✓).
- Letters A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I are **not** in the word at all.

Remaining common letters not yet tried:
- Vowels: only Y and (possibly) E are left; E is already confirmed at the end.
- Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that uses none of the eliminated letters.  
Good candidate letters to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, W, Y.

A word like “clyde” would use C, L, Y, D – but D is still possible.  
However, “clyde” uses C, L, Y, D, E – none of which are eliminated except E is known at position 5.

But “clyde” has C in position 1, L in 2, Y in 3, D in 4, E in 5 – this fits.

Another simple choice: “clyde” uses four new consonants and the known E.

Let’s go with that.

So far we know:
- Position 5 = E
- Position 2 = L
- Eliminated letters: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, C, Y, D

Remaining letters that are still possible:
Vowels: only E is left (already placed at position 5), so no other vowel is in the word.
Consonants: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (plus L and E already known).

We need a 5-letter word with:
- _ _ L _ E
- No A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, C, Y, D
- Uses only remaining consonants.

Good candidate letters to test: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Let’s pick a word that uses several of these new letters. A good choice is “globe”, but:
- G is allowed
- L is allowed (already in position 2)
- O is eliminated
- B is allowed
- E is allowed

However, “globe” contains O, which is eliminated. Let’s try “flame”:
- F is allowed
- L is allowed
- A is eliminated

Next, “hlome” – but H is allowed, L, O eliminated.

Let’s try “vulge” – but U is eliminated.

A valid word is “blame”:
- B is allowed
- L is allowed
- A is eliminated

Next, “flume” – but U is eliminated.

“Plume” – U is eliminated.

“Flege” – G is allowed, but E is already at the end, and G is allowed, but we need to check other letters. Actually, “flege” is not a valid word.

“Jlome” – not a word.

“Mlome” – not a word.

“Plume” – U is eliminated.

“Wlome” – not a word.

“Klome” – not a word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should ideally use 5 distinct letters from this set to help eliminate or confirm many possibilities early on.

Looking at these common letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a high chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word, providing valuable feedback for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position.
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word.

So the secret word ends in E and contains none of A, R, O, S.  
I need a 5-letter word that ends in E and avoids A, R, O, S.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, H, M, P, B, F, G, K, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are ruled out).

A strong second guess should introduce new common letters while respecting the constraints.  
“untie” would conflict with R and S indirectly (but not directly), yet “elite” repeats E uselessly.  
“until” is invalid (ends in L).  
“elite” repeats E.  
“input” contains P and U, both common and not yet tested.  
“input” ends in T, not E.

Let me pick a word that ends in E, contains new common letters, and avoids A, R, O, S.

“input” → ends in T, so discard.  
“elite” → ends in E, but repeats E and uses I, L, T.  
“elite” uses E in position 5 (✓), and introduces I, L, T.

But “elite” uses E in position 1 and 5 – we already know E is in position 5, but duplicates aren’t ruled out. However, it’s better to avoid duplicate letters in guesses to maximize new info.

Another candidate: “untie” – but ends in E, uses U, N, T, I.  
“untie” ends in E, avoids A, R, O, S, and introduces U, N, T, I.

Let’s go with “untie”.

Guess 2: untie -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(x) I(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we know:

- The word ends in E (position 5 has ✓).
- Letters A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I are **not** in the word at all.

Remaining common letters not yet tried:
- Vowels: only Y and (possibly) E are left; E is already confirmed at the end.
- Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that uses none of the eliminated letters.  
Good candidate letters to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, W, Y.

A word like “clyde” would use C, L, Y, D – but D is still possible.  
However, “clyde” uses C, L, Y, D, E – none of which are eliminated except E is known at position 5.

But “clyde” has C in position 1, L in 2, Y in 3, D in 4, E in 5 – this fits.

Another simple choice: “clyde” uses four new consonants and the known E.

Let’s go with that.

We now know:
- The word ends in E (position 5).
- L is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, C, Y, D.

So the pattern is: _ L _ _ E

Available letters (not yet ruled out): B, E, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that fits _ L _ _ E and only uses the allowed letters. Good candidates:
- B L _ _ E: ""bleed"" uses E twice (but E is already confirmed at the end) and D is ruled out.
- F L _ _ E: ""flake"" uses A and K, but A is ruled out.
- G L _ _ E: ""glove"" uses O and V.
- H L _ _ E: ""hyle"" is 4 letters, ""hylee"" is 5 but uncommon.
- M L _ _ E: ""mallee"" is 6 letters.
- P L _ _ E: ""plebe"" uses E twice and B is allowed.
- V L _ _ E: ""vulve"" is not a valid word.
- W L _ _ E: ""w leve"" is not valid.

A valid word that fits is ""plebe"":
- P, L, E, B, E - but E is already confirmed at position 5, and we don't have info about other E's.
- However, ""plebe"" is 5 letters, fits _ L _ _ E pattern, and uses only allowed letters.

But ""plebe"" has E in position 3 and 5 - we don't know if E appears elsewhere. A better choice is ""bleed"" but D is ruled out.

Another valid word: ""flume"" - but U is ruled out.
""glume"" - U is ruled out.

""plume"" - U is ruled out.

""zombie"" - O and Z are allowed, but O is ruled out.

Wait, let's think differently - we need _ L _ _ E with remaining letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Possible words:
- ""flake"" - A is ruled out.
- ""glove"" - O is ruled out.
- ""hylee"" - H, Y, L, E, E - Y is ruled out.
- ""jilge"" - J, I, L, G, E - I is ruled out.
- ""kluge"" - K, L, U, G, E - U is ruled out.
- ""mluge"" - M, L, U, G, E - U is ruled out.
- ""qluge"" - Q, L, U, G, E - U is ruled out.
- ""vlume"" - U is ruled out.
- ""wlume"" - U is ruled out.
- ""xliche"" - too long.
- ""zombie"" - O is ruled out.

Hmm, seems limited. Let's try ""bleed"" - but D is ruled out.

Actually, let's list all possible _ L _ _ E words with remaining letters:

Letters left: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Possible combinations:
- B L _ _ E: ""bleed"" (D out), ""blume"" (U out), ""blitz"" (Z allowed but T is out), ""blume"" (U out).
- F L _ _ E: ""flake"" (A out), ""flume"" (U out).
- G L _ _ E: ""glove"" (O out), ""glume"" (U out).
- H L _ _ E: ""hylee"" (Y out), ""hlume"" (U out).
- J L _ _ E: ""jlume"" (U out).
- K L _ _ E: ""kluge"" (U out), ""klege"" (G, L, E, but needs 5 letters).
- M L _ _ E: ""mallee"" (too long), ""mlume"" (U out).
- P L _ _ E: ""plebe"" (B allowed, P allowed, E allowed, but E is already at 5), ""plume"" (U out).
- Q L _ _ E: ""qlume"" (U out).
- V L _ _ E: ""vlume"" (U out).
- W L _ _ E: ""wlume"" (U out).
- X L _ _ E: ""xlume"" (U out).
- Z L _ _ E: ""zlume"" (U out).

This is tricky. Maybe ""plebe"" is the closest valid word, even if it repeats E - it's a known word.

But let's think of other possibilities. ""zombie"" - O is out. ""xylem"" - X, Y, L, E, M - Y is out.

Actually, ""plume"" is invalid due to U. ""bleed"" is invalid due to D.

Another valid word: ""flume"" - U is out.

Wait, let's try ""qlume"" - but U is out.

This seems difficult. Maybe ""plebe"" is the best possible with remaining letters.

But ""plebe"" has E in position 3 and 5 - we don't know if E appears twice. 

Alternative approach: look for _ L _ _ E words with remaining consonants:

Possible words:
- ""bleed"" - D out.
- ""flume"" - U out.
- ""glove"" - O out.
- ""hylee"" - Y out.
- ""jilge"" - I out.
- ""kluge"" - U out.
- ""mlume"" - U out.
- ""plebe"" - valid, but E twice.
- ""vlume"" - U out.

""plebe"" seems to be the only valid 5-letter word fitting _ L _ _ E with remaining letters. Even though it repeats E, it's the best candidate.

However, let's double-check: is there ""plebe"" in the dictionary? Yes, ""plebe"" is a valid word meaning the common people in ancient Rome.

So, the next guess is ""plebe"".

But wait, ""plebe"" has P, L, E, B, E - and we know:
- P is new (not ruled out).
- L is confirmed at position 2.
- E is confirmed at position 5.
- B is new (not ruled out).
- Second E is untested.

This seems acceptable as it tests new letters around the known L and E.

Therefore, the next guess is ""plebe"".
