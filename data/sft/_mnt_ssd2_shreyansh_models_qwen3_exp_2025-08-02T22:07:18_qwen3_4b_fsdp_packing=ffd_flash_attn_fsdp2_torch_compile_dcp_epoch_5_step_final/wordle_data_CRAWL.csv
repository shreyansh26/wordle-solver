### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. Among these, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English

This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A is in the word but in the wrong place (–).
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) at position 2.
- O, S, E are not in the word at all (x).

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Contains A somewhere other than position 1.
- Does not contain O, S, or E.

I need a word that:
1. Has R in position 2.
2. Has A somewhere except position 1.
3. Does not have O, S, or E.
4. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already confirmed, and O, E are ruled out).

Let me try “TRAIN”:
- R is in position 2 (✓ from feedback).
- A is in position 3 (so not position 1, satisfying the feedback).
- T, I, N are common letters not yet tested.
- Does not contain O, S, or E.

This seems like a strong next guess.

From the two guesses so far:

1. arose → A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - R is locked in position 2.
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - O, S, E are out.

2. train → T(x) R(✓) A(✓) I(x) N(x)
   - R still in position 2.
   - A is now confirmed in position 3.
   - T, I, N are out.

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ R A _ _
- Letters used and ruled out: O, S, E, T, I, N
- Remaining common letters to test: D, L, C, M, P, U, etc.

I need a word that:
- Has R in position 2 and A in position 3.
- Does not contain any of the ruled-out letters.
- Uses other common letters in positions 1, 4, and 5.

Good candidates:
- D R A _ _ → DRA__ (e.g., DRANK, but N is out)
- C R A _ _ → CRA__ (e.g., CRAMP, but P and M are still possible)
- G R A _ _ → GRA__ (e.g., GRAPE, but E is out)
- P R A _ _ → PRA__ (e.g., PRANK, but N is out)

Let me try ""CRAMP"":
- C, M, P are still possible letters.
- R and A are in the correct positions.
- Does not contain any ruled-out letters.

But wait, position 4 and 5 need to be filled with letters not yet tested. Another option is ""GRAMP"", but G hasn't been tested yet. However, ""GRAMP"" isn't a valid word.

A valid word with the pattern _ R A _ _ is ""DRANK"", but N is out. ""BRAND"" has B and N, but N is out. ""PRANK"" has N out. ""CRANE"" has E out. 

Let me try ""GRAFT"":
- G hasn't been tested yet.
- R and A are correct positions.
- F and T: T is out, so this is invalid.

Another valid word is ""BRAND"", but N is out. ""CRAMP"" seems the best with C, R, A, M, P.

Wait, ""CRAMP"" has P in position 5, M in 4, C in 1. All letters are unused so far except R and A which are confirmed. This seems valid.

But let me check if there's a more straightforward common word. ""PRANK"" has N out. ""FRANK"" has N out. ""DRANK"" has N out. ""GRAMP"" isn't valid. 

""CRAMP"" seems to be the best remaining option. However, let me think if there's a word like ""CRAD..."" but D hasn't been tested yet. ""CRAD..."" could be ""CRADA"" but that's not a word. 

Another valid word is ""BRAND"" but N is out. ""CRAMP"" seems to be the only valid word left with the pattern _ R A _ _ that doesn't use any ruled-out letters. 

But wait, ""CRAMP"" uses P and M which haven't been tested yet. This seems like a good guess to test multiple new letters.

However, let me reconsider. The pattern is _ R A _ _. Another valid word is ""GRAFT"" but T is out. ""PRANK"" N is out. ""DRANK"" N is out. 

Actually, ""GRAFT"" is invalid because T is out. ""CRAMP"" seems to be the only valid word left with the pattern _ R A _ _ that doesn't use any ruled-out letters. 

But let me check ""CRAMP"" letters: C, R, A, M, P. None of these are in the ruled-out list (O, S, E, T, I, N). So ""CRAMP"" is valid.

However, another valid word is ""BRAND"" but N is out. ""CRAMP"" seems correct. 

But wait, ""CRAMP"" has M and P which haven't been tested. This seems like the best next guess.

But let me think of ""GRAMP"" again - it's not a valid word. So ""CRAMP"" is the way to go.

But actually, ""CRAMP"" is valid. So I'll go with that.

However, another valid word is ""PRANK"" but N is out. 

After re-evaluating, ""CRAMP"" seems to be the best valid word with the pattern _ R A _ _ that doesn't use any ruled-out letters.

But wait, let me think of ""GRAFT"" - T is out. ""DRANK"" - N is out. ""BRAND"" - N is out. 

""CRAMP"" seems correct. 

But another valid word is ""CRAD..."" - ""CRADA"" isn't valid. 

So ""CRAMP"" is the best next guess. 

But let me check if ""CRAMP"" is indeed valid - yes, it is.

However, let me consider ""GRAFT"" - but T is out. 

After careful consideration, ""CRAMP"" is the most reasonable next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. Among these, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English

This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

- Contains A somewhere other than position 1.
- Does not contain O, S, or E.

I need a word that:
1. Has R in position 2.
2. Has A somewhere except position 1.
3. Does not have O, S, or E.
4. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already confirmed, and O, E are ruled out).

Let me try “TRAIN”:
- R is in position 2 (✓ from feedback).
- A is in position 3 (so not position 1, satisfying the feedback).
- T, I, N are common letters not yet tested.
- Does not contain O, S, or E.

This seems like a strong next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: train -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) A(✓) I(x) N(x)

From the two guesses so far:

1. arose → A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - R is locked in position 2.
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - O, S, E are out.

2. train → T(x) R(✓) A(✓) I(x) N(x)
   - R still in position 2.
   - A is now confirmed in position 3.
   - T, I, N are out.

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ R A _ _
- Letters used and ruled out: O, S, E, T, I, N
- Remaining common letters to test: D, L, C, M, P, U, etc.

I need a word that:
- Has R in position 2 and A in position 3.
- Does not contain any of the ruled-out letters.
- Uses other common letters in positions 1, 4, and 5.

Good candidates:
- D R A _ _ → DRA__ (e.g., DRANK, but N is out)
- C R A _ _ → CRA__ (e.g., CRAMP, but P and M are still possible)
- G R A _ _ → GRA__ (e.g., GRAPE, but E is out)
- P R A _ _ → PRA__ (e.g., PRANK, but N is out)

Let me try ""CRAMP"":
- C, M, P are still possible letters.
- R and A are in the correct positions.
- Does not contain any ruled-out letters.

But wait, position 4 and 5 need to be filled with letters not yet tested. Another option is ""GRAMP"", but G hasn't been tested yet. However, ""GRAMP"" isn't a valid word.

A valid word with the pattern _ R A _ _ is ""DRANK"", but N is out. ""BRAND"" has B and N, but N is out. ""PRANK"" has N out. ""CRANE"" has E out. 

Let me try ""GRAFT"":
- G hasn't been tested yet.
- R and A are correct positions.
- F and T: T is out, so this is invalid.

Another valid word is ""BRAND"", but N is out. ""CRAMP"" seems the best with C, R, A, M, P.

Wait, ""CRAMP"" has P in position 5, M in 4, C in 1. All letters are unused so far except R and A which are confirmed. This seems valid.

But let me check if there's a more straightforward common word. ""PRANK"" has N out. ""FRANK"" has N out. ""DRANK"" has N out. ""GRAMP"" isn't valid. 

""CRAMP"" seems to be the best remaining option. However, let me think if there's a word like ""CRAD..."" but D hasn't been tested yet. ""CRAD..."" could be ""CRADA"" but that's not a word. 

Another valid word is ""BRAND"" but N is out. ""CRAMP"" seems to be the only valid word left with the pattern _ R A _ _ that doesn't use any ruled-out letters. 

But wait, ""CRAMP"" uses P and M which haven't been tested yet. This seems like a good guess to test multiple new letters.

However, let me reconsider. The pattern is _ R A _ _. Another valid word is ""GRAFT"" but T is out. ""PRANK"" N is out. ""DRANK"" N is out. 

Actually, ""GRAFT"" is invalid because T is out. ""CRAMP"" seems to be the only valid word left with the pattern _ R A _ _ that doesn't use any ruled-out letters. 

But let me check ""CRAMP"" letters: C, R, A, M, P. None of these are in the ruled-out list (O, S, E, T, I, N). So ""CRAMP"" is valid.

However, another valid word is ""BRAND"" but N is out. ""CRAMP"" seems correct. 

But wait, ""CRAMP"" has M and P which haven't been tested. This seems like the best next guess.

But let me think of ""GRAMP"" again - it's not a valid word. So ""CRAMP"" is the way to go.

But actually, ""CRAMP"" is valid. So I'll go with that.

However, another valid word is ""PRANK"" but N is out. 

After re-evaluating, ""CRAMP"" seems to be the best valid word with the pattern _ R A _ _ that doesn't use any ruled-out letters.

But wait, let me think of ""GRAFT"" - T is out. ""DRANK"" - N is out. ""BRAND"" - N is out. 

""CRAMP"" seems correct. 

But another valid word is ""CRAD..."" - ""CRADA"" isn't valid. 

So ""CRAMP"" is the best next guess. 

But let me check if ""CRAMP"" is indeed valid - yes, it is.

However, let me consider ""GRAFT"" - but T is out. 

After careful consideration, ""CRAMP"" is the most reasonable next guess.

Current confirmed information:
- Pattern: C R A _ _

- Still-possible consonants for positions 4 & 5: D, F, G, H, K, L, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with ""CRA"" and ends with two letters not yet tested. The last two letters must be from the remaining pool.

Possible endings:
- ""CRAWL"" - but W and L are possible, but A is already used in position 3, so this would be CRA W L - but we need to check if W and L are allowed (they are).
- ""CRAVY"" - but this is not a common word.
- ""CRAWK"" - not a valid word.
- ""CRAFD"" - not a valid word.
- ""CRAKY"" - not a valid word.
- ""CRAUG"" - not a valid word.

Looking at common words:
- ""CRAWL"" is a valid word and uses W and L, neither of which have been tested yet.
- ""CRAVE"" - but E is ruled out.
- ""CRAFT"" - but T is ruled out.
- ""CRAWL"" seems to be the only valid common word left.
