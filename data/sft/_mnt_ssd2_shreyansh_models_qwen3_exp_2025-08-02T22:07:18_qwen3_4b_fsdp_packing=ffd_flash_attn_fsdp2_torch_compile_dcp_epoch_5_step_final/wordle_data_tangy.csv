### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. A strong starting word typically includes:

- Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
- Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of frequent letters in both positions and vowels.

This seems valid because:
- Contains A and T
- A is not in position 3
- T is not in position 4
- No S, L, E

From the new feedback on TARIN:
- T(✓) – T is in the word and in the correct 1st position.
- A(✓) – A is in the word and in the correct 2nd position.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- I(x) – I is not in the word.
- N(-) – N is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So far we know:
- Word structure: T A _ _ _
- Letters definitely present somewhere: N (but not in position 5)
- Letters definitely absent: S, L, E, R, I

Remaining unused common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word that starts with TA and contains N somewhere (positions 3 or 4). Let's try to pick a word that introduces new common letters.

Good candidates:
- T A N K _ (but we need 5 letters)
- T A _ N _ (but N cannot be in position 5)
- T A _ _ N (but N cannot be in position 5, so this is invalid)
- T A _ N _ (N in position 4)
- T A N _ _ (N in position 3)

Let's try ""TANKY"" – but Y is sometimes used, and K is common. However, ""TANKY"" isn't a standard word.
Let's try ""TANGO"" – but O is a vowel we haven't tested yet, and G is a consonant.
""TANGO"" uses: T, A, N, G, O – all valid letters not excluded.

But we need to check positions:
- T A N G O: N is in position 3 (allowed), O is new, G is new.

This seems valid.

Alternative: ""TAPIR"" – but R is excluded.
""TAJIN"" – but I is excluded.
""TALON"" – but L is excluded and O is new.

""TANGO"" seems better as it introduces two new common letters (G, O).

From the new feedback on TANGO:
- T(✓) – T is correct in position 1.
- A(✓) – A is correct in position 2.
- N(✓) – N is correct in position 3.
- G(✓) – G is correct in position 4.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.

So far we know the word structure is T A N G _

Letters definitely absent: S, L, E, R, I, O
Letters already placed: T, A, N, G

We need a 5-letter word that starts with TANG and whose last letter is not O, S, L, E, R, I.

Possible last letters (common ones not excluded): B, C, D, F, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y

Let’s list some words:
- TANGB – not a word
- TANGC – not a word
- TANGD – not a word
- TANGE – not a word (E excluded)
- TANGF – not a word
- TANGH – not a word
- TANGK – not a word
- TANGM – not a word
- TANGP – not a word
- TANGU – not a word
- TANGV – not a word
- TANGW – not a word
- TANGY – valid word

""TANGY"" fits perfectly:
- T A N G Y – all letters are allowed (Y not excluded)
- Y is a valid 5th letter in English words.

Let me double-check:
- TANGY is indeed a valid English word.
- Y is not in the excluded list (S, L, E, R, I, O).
- This should be the correct word.

Based on the feedback, the word must start with TANG and the last letter cannot be any of the excluded letters (S, L, E, R, I, O). The only common letter that fits is Y.
