For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. A good starting word should ideally include several of these letters without repeating any letters.

One of the best starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This combination gives us a good spread of common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

2. Does not contain L, T, M.
3. Places S, A, E in still-allowed positions.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after the three guesses.

1. Letters that ARE in the word (at least once): S, A, E, E (so definitely S, A, E)
2. Letters that are NOT in the word: L, T, M, R
3. Position constraints so far:
   - S cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 5 → must be in 2 or 4
   - A cannot be in positions 3 or 4 → must be in 1, 2, or 5
   - E cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 → must be in 4 (but we already have E in 4 from EASER feedback showing E(✓) in position 4)
   - The final E is confirmed in position 4.

So the word must look like:
_ _ _ E _

with S and A placed in still-allowed positions.

Given E is fixed in position 4, we need:
- S in 2 or 3 (since 5 is now impossible for S because E is in 4 and S can’t be in 5 from SEAMS feedback)
- A in 1, 2, or 5 (but 5 is impossible because E is in 4 and A can’t be in 5 from SEAMS feedback) → A must be in 1 or 2
- S must be in 2 or 3, but if A is in 2, S must be in 3.

Possible patterns:
- A _ S E _
- _ A S E _

Now we need to fill the remaining blanks with letters that haven’t been ruled out and are distinct from S, A, E, L, T, M, R.

Common unused consonants: N, D, G, H, etc.

Let’s try “GASES”:
- G (new letter)
- A (allowed in position 2)
- S (allowed in position 3)
- E (fixed in 4)
- S (allowed in position 5, but wait: SEAMS feedback said S cannot be in 5)

So S cannot be in 5, so “GASES” is invalid because it puts S in 5.

Next try “HASES” – same issue with S in 5.

Try “DASES” – same issue.

Try “NASES” – same issue.

Try “PASES” – same issue.

We need S not in 3 or 5, but from above S must be in 2 or 3, and A must be in 1 or 2.

If we put A in 1 and S in 2: A S _ E _

We need a third letter in position 3 that hasn’t been ruled out (not L, T, M, R).

Common unused consonants: N, D, G, H, etc.

Try “ASNEE” – but E is already in 4 and can’t repeat in 5 (from SEAMS feedback E cannot be in 5).

Try “ASHEE” – same issue.

Try “ASKEE” – K is okay, but E can’t be in 5.

Try “ASNEE” – again E in 5 is invalid.

Try “ASKEE” – E in 5 invalid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. A good starting word should ideally include several of these letters without repeating any letters.

One of the best starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This combination gives us a good spread of common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it can’t be 1st)
- L is not in the word
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (can’t be 3rd)
- T is not in the word
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (can’t be 5th)

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: L, T
- Letters that ARE in the word somewhere: S, A, E
- S cannot be 1st, A cannot be 3rd, E cannot be 5th.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S, A, E (but not in their previous positions).
2. Does NOT contain L or T.
3. Has valid positions for S, A, E that satisfy the feedback.

A good candidate is “SEAMS”:
- S is now in position 2 (was 1st, so allowed).
- E is in position 1 (was 5th, so allowed).
- A is in position 4 (was 3rd, so allowed).
- M and S are new letters; M is common and hasn’t been ruled out.
- Doesn’t contain L or T.

This should efficiently test the remaining positions and possibly reveal the correct placement of S, A, E.

Guess 2: SEAMS -> FEEDBACK: S(-) E(-) A(-) M(x) S(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s summarize what we now know after the two guesses.

From SLATE:
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- L, T are NOT in the word.
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

From SEAMS:
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1 or 5.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 1 or 5.
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 or 4.
- M is NOT in the word.

So far:
- Letters known to be in the word: S, A, E
- Letters known NOT in the word: L, T, M

Positions ruled out for each of S, A, E:
- S cannot be 1st or 5th → possible positions: 2, 3, 4
- A cannot be 3rd or 4th → possible positions: 1, 2, 5
- E cannot be 1st or 5th → possible positions: 2, 3, 4

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S, A, E (each at least once).
2. Does not contain L, T, M.
3. Places S, A, E in still-allowed positions.

A simple way to satisfy all constraints is to use the word “EASER”:
- Letters: E, A, S, E, R.  Contains S, A, E.
- R is a new letter; it hasn’t been ruled out.
- Positions:
  – E in position 1: allowed (only position 5 was disallowed).
  – A in position 2: allowed (positions 3, 4 were disallowed).
  – S in position 3: allowed (positions 1, 5 were disallowed).
  – The two E’s and one R are additional letters.

This should give us new positional feedback for S, A, E and test the letter R.

From the latest feedback (ASHEN):
- A is correct in position 1
- S is correct in position 2
- E is correct in position 4
- H and N are NOT in the word

So the word now looks like: A S _ E _

We know the letters NOT in the word are: L, T, M, R, H, N

We need to find a valid 5-letter word that starts with AS and ends with E, with the third letter not being any of the ruled-out letters.

Possible third letters (not H, N, L, T, M, R): common consonants like D, G, K, P, V, W, etc.

Looking for words like ""AS_D E"" or ""AS*E*"".

Common words fitting this pattern:
- ASKEE - but K is allowed, but E can't be in position 5 (from SEAMS feedback), and ASKEE has E in 5 which is invalid.
- ASPEN - P is allowed, and the word is ASPEN. Let's check:
  - A(✓) in 1
  - S(✓) in 2
  - P - not ruled out
  - E(✓) in 4
  - N - but N was ruled out in Guess 4 (N(x))
  So ASPEN is invalid because N is used.
- ASIDE - I is allowed, D is allowed. Let's check:
  - A S I D E
  - Positions: 1,2,3,4,5
  - E is in 5 - but from SEAMS feedback, E cannot be in 5 (E(-) in SEAMS guess where E was in 5)
  So ASIDE is invalid because E can't be in 5.
- ASKEW - but E is in 4, so this would have E in 4 and W at 5, but the word is ASKEW which is A S K E W - this has E in 4 and W in 5, which fits because:
    - A(✓) 1
    - S(✓) 2
    - K - not ruled out
    - E(✓) 4
    - W - not ruled out
  But we need to check if K is allowed - it wasn't ruled out in any guess.
  Also, ASKEW is a valid word.

But let me think if there's a more straightforward word. Another option is:
- ASKEE - but E in 5 is invalid
- ASIDE - E in 5 invalid
- ASPEN - N invalid
- ASHEM - H invalid
- ASKED - D is allowed, E in 5 invalid
- ASKES - S in 5 invalid (from SEAMS feedback S cannot be in 5)
- ASKED - E in 5 invalid
- ASKEW - this seems valid as it has:
   A S K E W
   E is in 4 (correct), W is new, K is new

But looking at the pattern A S _ E _, the only common word that fits without ruled-out letters is ASPEN, but N is ruled out. ASKEW seems to fit but let me check if K is allowed - it wasn't used in any previous guess, so it's allowed.

However, there's another word: A S P E N (AS PEN), but N is ruled out. 

Wait, let me re-examine the pattern: A S _ E _ with the third letter not being H, N, L, T, M, R.

Possible third letters: D, G, K, P, V, W, etc.

Looking for common words:
- ASKEW - A S K E W (K and W are allowed)
- ASPEN - N is not allowed
- ASIDE - E in 5 not allowed
- ASHEM - H not allowed
- ASKEE - E in 5 not allowed
- ASKED - E in 5 not allowed
- ASPED - P and D allowed, but ASPED is not a common word
- ASKED - already considered
- ASKEW seems to be the only valid word here.

But let me think if there's another word: A S P E D (asped) - but this is not a standard word.

Another possibility: A S K E T - but T is ruled out.

A S K E W seems to be the only valid word fitting the pattern and constraints.

But let me double-check:
- A S K E W:
   - A(✓) 1
   - S(✓) 2
   - K - not used before, allowed
   - E(✓) 4
   - W - not used before, allowed
   - No ruled-out letters (L, T, M, R, H, N are avoided)
   - This is a valid English word.

Therefore, the next guess should be ASKEW.
