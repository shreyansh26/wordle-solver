### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several letters at once. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word with a mix of these vowels and consonants. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- Three common vowels: A, O, E
- Two common consonants: R, S
This gives me the maximum information possible with one guess, as many letters are among the most frequent in English.

All five letters in ""arose"" (A, R, O, S, E) are now known to be absent from the secret word.  
That means I can completely ignore those letters when choosing my next guess.  
I should pick a word that uses entirely different letters, ideally including some of the next-most-common consonants and vowels to maximize information gain.  
Good candidates among the remaining common letters include: T, N, L, I, C, U, D, M, P, etc.  
A balanced five-letter word using these is ""UNTIL"" (U, N, T, I, L).  
This gives me coverage of a new vowel (U, I) and three new consonants (N, T, L) that weren’t in the first guess.

Letters we now know are NOT in the word (x):  
A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L  

Letters that ARE in the word (- or ✓), but whose positions are unknown:  
U, N  

So the secret word contains both U and N, and they are NOT in their original positions from Guess 2 (until).  
In Guess 2, U was in position 1 and N in position 2, so they must be in different positions now.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both U and N (and only those letters not yet ruled out).
- U is NOT in position 1.
- N is NOT in position 2.

Remaining common letters we can still use: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, plus the required U and N.

Let’s pick a word that places U and N in new positions and introduces other fresh common letters.  
A good candidate is “MOUND”:  
- M, O, D are new letters (O was already ruled out, so scratch MOUND).  
Another candidate: “UNBROKEN” – too long.  
“FUNNY” – repeats N.  
“DUNNY” – repeats N.  
“BUNNY” – repeats N.  
“PUNY” – too short.  
“PUCKY” – introduces P, C, K, Y.  
Let’s check: P, U, C, K, Y.  
- P, C, K, Y are all new letters.  
- U is in position 2 (was in 1 before).  
- N is not in this word at all – so scratch.  
Need a word that includes N.

“DUNNO” – ruled out by O.  
“NUNCH” – introduces C, H, and moves N to positions 1 and 3.  
But U must be in the word, and in NUNCH it’s not present.  
So scratch.  
“UNCUP” – introduces C, P, but no.  
“UNFIX” – introduces F, X.  
“UNHIP” – introduces H, P.  
“UNJOK” – introduces J, O, K.  
“UNKNOT” – introduces K, T, O.  
“UNKIND” – introduces K, I, N, D.  
I is already ruled out.  
“UNLIT” – introduces L, I, T.  
All ruled out.  
“UNMUT” – introduces M, T.  
T is ruled out.  
“UPEND” – introduces P, E, D.  
E is ruled out.  
“UNDER” – introduces D, E, R.  
E, R ruled out.  
“UNFIT” – introduces F, I, T.  
I, T ruled out.  
“UNHOOK” – too long.  
“UNJUM” – introduces J, M.  
“UNKET” – introduces K, E, T.  
E, T ruled out.  
“UNLUG” – introduces L, G.  
“UNPEN” – introduces P, E, N.  
E ruled out.  
“UNPUS” – introduces P, S.  
S ruled out.  
“UNRUL” – introduces R, U, L.  
R, L ruled out.  
“UNSPOILED” – too long.  
“UNSET” – introduces S, E, T.  
S, E, T ruled out.  
“UNTIL” – already used.  
“UNWED” – introduces W, D.  
D is okay, W is new.  
But we need to include N, and in “UNTIL” N was in position 2.  
So in “UNWED”, N is in position 1 – allowed.  
But E is ruled out.  
So scratch.  
“UNZIP” – introduces Z, P.  
Z is uncommon, but acceptable.  
Positions: U in 1, N in 2 – but in Guess 2, U was in 1 and N in 2, and feedback said they are in the word but wrong positions.  
So they must be in different positions now.  
Thus, U cannot be in 1 and N cannot be in 2 in the new guess.  
So “UNZIP” is invalid because U is still in 1 and N still in 2.  
Need to move both U and N to new positions.

Let’s list possible positions for U and N:
U cannot be in 1 (from Guess 2).  
N cannot be in 2 (from Guess 2).

Possible positions:
U: 2,3,4,5  
N: 1,3,4,5  

We need a word that satisfies these constraints and uses only allowed letters.

Let’s try “DUCHN” – but C, H, D are new, but N is in 5, U in 2.  
But “DUCHN” is not a valid English word.  
“CHUNK” – C, H, K new; N in 3, U in 2.  
Valid word.  
Check letters: C,H,U,N,K.  
All are allowed (not in the ruled-out list).  
Positions: U in 2 (allowed), N in 3 (allowed).  
This seems good.

Another candidate: “FUNNY” – repeats N, and F is new.  
But N is in 4 and 5, U is not present.  
So invalid (must include U).  
“PUCKY” – P,U,C,K,Y; no N.  
Invalid.  
“DUNNY” – N in 3,4, U in 2.  
Valid word.  
Letters: D,U,N,N,Y.  
D and Y are new.  
Positions: U in 2 (allowed), N in 3 and 4 (allowed).  
But it repeats N, which is acceptable as long as both U and N are present.  
But we want to maximize information, so “CHUNK” introduces more new letters (C,H,K) compared to DUNNY (D,Y).  
Thus, “CHUNK” is better.

Let’s go with “CHUNK”.

So the secret word contains both U and N, and they are NOT in their original positions from Guess 2 (until).  
In Guess 2, U was in position 1 and N in position 2, so they must be in different positions now.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both U and N (and only those letters not yet ruled out).
- U is NOT in position 1.
- N is NOT in position 2.

Remaining common letters we can still use: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, plus the required U and N.

Let’s pick a word that places U and N in new positions and introduces other fresh common letters.

“DUNNY” – repeats N.  
“BUNNY” – repeats N.  
“PUNY” – too short.  
“PUCKY” – introduces P, C, K, Y.  
Let’s check: P, U, C, K, Y.  
- P, C, K, Y are all new letters.  
- U is in position 2 (was in 1 before).  
- N is not in this word at all – so scratch.  
Need a word that includes N.

“DUNNO” – ruled out by O.  
“NUNCH” – introduces C, H, and moves N to positions 1 and 3.  
But U must be in the word, and in NUNCH it’s not present.

“UNCUP” – introduces C, P, but no.  
“UNFIX” – introduces F, X.  
“UNHIP” – introduces H, P.  
“UNJOK” – introduces J, O, K.  
“UNKNOT” – introduces K, T, O.

I is already ruled out.  
“UNLIT” – introduces L, I, T.

“UNMUT” – introduces M, T.  
T is ruled out.  
“UPEND” – introduces P, E, D.  
E is ruled out.  
“UNDER” – introduces D, E, R.  
E, R ruled out.  
“UNFIT” – introduces F, I, T.  
I, T ruled out.

E, T ruled out.  
“UNLUG” – introduces L, G.

S ruled out.  
“UNRUL” – introduces R, U, L.  
R, L ruled out.  
“UNSPOILED” – too long.  
“UNSET” – introduces S, E, T.  
S, E, T ruled out.  
“UNTIL” – already used.  
“UNWED” – introduces W, D.  
D is okay, W is new.  
But we need to include N, and in “UNTIL” N was in position 2.  
So in “UNWED”, N is in position 1 – allowed.  
But E is ruled out.  
So scratch.  
“UNZIP” – introduces Z, P.  
Z is uncommon, but acceptable.  
Positions: U in 1, N in 2 – but in Guess 2, U was in 1 and N in 2, and feedback said they are in the word but wrong positions.  
So they must be in different positions now.  
Thus, U cannot be in 1 and N cannot be in 2 in the new guess.  
So “UNZIP” is invalid because U is still in 1 and N still in 2.  
Need to move both U and N to new positions.

Let’s list possible positions for U and N:
U cannot be in 1 (from Guess 2).  
N cannot be in 2 (from Guess 2).

Possible positions:
U: 2,3,4,5  
N: 1,3,4,5  

We need a word that satisfies these constraints and uses only allowed letters.

Let’s try “DUCHN” – but C, H, D are new, but N is in 5, U in 2.  
But “DUCHN” is not a valid English word.  
“CHUNK” – C, H, K new; N in 3, U in 2.  
Valid word.  
Check letters: C,H,U,N,K.  
All are allowed (not in the ruled-out list).  
Positions: U in 2 (allowed), N in 3 (allowed).  
This seems good.

Another candidate: “FUNNY” – repeats N, and F is new.  
But N is in 4 and 5, U is not present.  
So invalid (must include U).  
“PUCKY” – P,U,C,K,Y; no N.  
Invalid.  
“DUNNY” – N in 3,4, U in 2.  
Valid word.  
Letters: D,U,N,N,Y.  
D and Y are new.  
Positions: U in 2 (allowed), N in 3 and 4 (allowed).  
But it repeats N, which is acceptable as long as both U and N are present.  
But we want to maximize information, so “CHUNK” introduces more new letters (C,H,K) compared to DUNNY (D,Y).  
Thus, “CHUNK” is better.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several letters at once. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word with a mix of these vowels and consonants. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- Three common vowels: A, O, E
- Two common consonants: R, S
This gives me the maximum information possible with one guess, as many letters are among the most frequent in English.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in ""arose"" (A, R, O, S, E) are now known to be absent from the secret word.  
That means I can completely ignore those letters when choosing my next guess.  
I should pick a word that uses entirely different letters, ideally including some of the next-most-common consonants and vowels to maximize information gain.  
Good candidates among the remaining common letters include: T, N, L, I, C, U, D, M, P, etc.  
A balanced five-letter word using these is ""UNTIL"" (U, N, T, I, L).  
This gives me coverage of a new vowel (U, I) and three new consonants (N, T, L) that weren’t in the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: until -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(-) T(x) I(x) L(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Letters we now know are NOT in the word (x):  
A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L  

Letters that ARE in the word (- or ✓), but whose positions are unknown:  
U, N  

So the secret word contains both U and N, and they are NOT in their original positions from Guess 2 (until).  
In Guess 2, U was in position 1 and N in position 2, so they must be in different positions now.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both U and N (and only those letters not yet ruled out).
- U is NOT in position 1.
- N is NOT in position 2.

Remaining common letters we can still use: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, plus the required U and N.

Let’s pick a word that places U and N in new positions and introduces other fresh common letters.  
A good candidate is “MOUND”:  
- M, O, D are new letters (O was already ruled out, so scratch MOUND).  
Another candidate: “UNBROKEN” – too long.  
“FUNNY” – repeats N.  
“DUNNY” – repeats N.  
“BUNNY” – repeats N.  
“PUNY” – too short.  
“PUCKY” – introduces P, C, K, Y.  
Let’s check: P, U, C, K, Y.  
- P, C, K, Y are all new letters.  
- U is in position 2 (was in 1 before).  
- N is not in this word at all – so scratch.  
Need a word that includes N.

“DUNNO” – ruled out by O.  
“NUNCH” – introduces C, H, and moves N to positions 1 and 3.  
But U must be in the word, and in NUNCH it’s not present.  
So scratch.  
“UNCUP” – introduces C, P, but no.  
“UNFIX” – introduces F, X.  
“UNHIP” – introduces H, P.  
“UNJOK” – introduces J, O, K.  
“UNKNOT” – introduces K, T, O.  
“UNKIND” – introduces K, I, N, D.  
I is already ruled out.  
“UNLIT” – introduces L, I, T.  
All ruled out.  
“UNMUT” – introduces M, T.  
T is ruled out.  
“UPEND” – introduces P, E, D.  
E is ruled out.  
“UNDER” – introduces D, E, R.  
E, R ruled out.  
“UNFIT” – introduces F, I, T.  
I, T ruled out.  
“UNHOOK” – too long.  
“UNJUM” – introduces J, M.  
“UNKET” – introduces K, E, T.  
E, T ruled out.  
“UNLUG” – introduces L, G.  
“UNPEN” – introduces P, E, N.  
E ruled out.  
“UNPUS” – introduces P, S.  
S ruled out.  
“UNRUL” – introduces R, U, L.  
R, L ruled out.  
“UNSPOILED” – too long.  
“UNSET” – introduces S, E, T.  
S, E, T ruled out.  
“UNTIL” – already used.  
“UNWED” – introduces W, D.  
D is okay, W is new.  
But we need to include N, and in “UNTIL” N was in position 2.  
So in “UNWED”, N is in position 1 – allowed.  
But E is ruled out.  
So scratch.  
“UNZIP” – introduces Z, P.  
Z is uncommon, but acceptable.  
Positions: U in 1, N in 2 – but in Guess 2, U was in 1 and N in 2, and feedback said they are in the word but wrong positions.  
So they must be in different positions now.  
Thus, U cannot be in 1 and N cannot be in 2 in the new guess.  
So “UNZIP” is invalid because U is still in 1 and N still in 2.  
Need to move both U and N to new positions.

Let’s list possible positions for U and N:
U cannot be in 1 (from Guess 2).  
N cannot be in 2 (from Guess 2).

Possible positions:
U: 2,3,4,5  
N: 1,3,4,5  

We need a word that satisfies these constraints and uses only allowed letters.

Let’s try “DUCHN” – but C, H, D are new, but N is in 5, U in 2.  
But “DUCHN” is not a valid English word.  
“CHUNK” – C, H, K new; N in 3, U in 2.  
Valid word.  
Check letters: C,H,U,N,K.  
All are allowed (not in the ruled-out list).  
Positions: U in 2 (allowed), N in 3 (allowed).  
This seems good.

Another candidate: “FUNNY” – repeats N, and F is new.  
But N is in 4 and 5, U is not present.  
So invalid (must include U).  
“PUCKY” – P,U,C,K,Y; no N.  
Invalid.  
“DUNNY” – N in 3,4, U in 2.  
Valid word.  
Letters: D,U,N,N,Y.  
D and Y are new.  
Positions: U in 2 (allowed), N in 3 and 4 (allowed).  
But it repeats N, which is acceptable as long as both U and N are present.  
But we want to maximize information, so “CHUNK” introduces more new letters (C,H,K) compared to DUNNY (D,Y).  
Thus, “CHUNK” is better.

Let’s go with “CHUNK”.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several letters at once. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word with a mix of these vowels and consonants. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- Three common vowels: A, O, E
- Two common consonants: R, S
This gives me the maximum information possible with one guess, as many letters are among the most frequent in English.

All five letters in ""arose"" (A, R, O, S, E) are now known to be absent from the secret word.  
That means I can completely ignore those letters when choosing my next guess.  
I should pick a word that uses entirely different letters, ideally including some of the next-most-common consonants and vowels to maximize information gain.  
Good candidates among the remaining common letters include: T, N, L, I, C, U, D, M, P, etc.  
A balanced five-letter word using these is ""UNTIL"" (U, N, T, I, L).  
This gives me coverage of a new vowel (U, I) and three new consonants (N, T, L) that weren’t in the first guess.

Letters we now know are NOT in the word (x):  
A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L  

Letters that ARE in the word (- or ✓), but whose positions are unknown:  
U, N  

So the secret word contains both U and N, and they are NOT in their original positions from Guess 2 (until).  
In Guess 2, U was in position 1 and N in position 2, so they must be in different positions now.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both U and N (and only those letters not yet ruled out).
- U is NOT in position 1.
- N is NOT in position 2.

Remaining common letters we can still use: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, plus the required U and N.

Let’s pick a word that places U and N in new positions and introduces other fresh common letters.  
A good candidate is “MOUND”:  
- M, O, D are new letters (O was already ruled out, so scratch MOUND).  
Another candidate: “UNBROKEN” – too long.  
“FUNNY” – repeats N.  
“DUNNY” – repeats N.  
“BUNNY” – repeats N.  
“PUNY” – too short.  
“PUCKY” – introduces P, C, K, Y.  
Let’s check: P, U, C, K, Y.  
- P, C, K, Y are all new letters.  
- U is in position 2 (was in 1 before).  
- N is not in this word at all – so scratch.  
Need a word that includes N.

“DUNNO” – ruled out by O.  
“NUNCH” – introduces C, H, and moves N to positions 1 and 3.  
But U must be in the word, and in NUNCH it’s not present.  
So scratch.  
“UNCUP” – introduces C, P, but no.  
“UNFIX” – introduces F, X.  
“UNHIP” – introduces H, P.  
“UNJOK” – introduces J, O, K.  
“UNKNOT” – introduces K, T, O.  
“UNKIND” – introduces K, I, N, D.  
I is already ruled out.  
“UNLIT” – introduces L, I, T.  
All ruled out.  
“UNMUT” – introduces M, T.  
T is ruled out.  
“UPEND” – introduces P, E, D.  
E is ruled out.  
“UNDER” – introduces D, E, R.  
E, R ruled out.  
“UNFIT” – introduces F, I, T.  
I, T ruled out.  
“UNHOOK” – too long.  
“UNJUM” – introduces J, M.  
“UNKET” – introduces K, E, T.  
E, T ruled out.  
“UNLUG” – introduces L, G.  
“UNPEN” – introduces P, E, N.  
E ruled out.  
“UNPUS” – introduces P, S.  
S ruled out.  
“UNRUL” – introduces R, U, L.  
R, L ruled out.  
“UNSPOILED” – too long.  
“UNSET” – introduces S, E, T.  
S, E, T ruled out.  
“UNTIL” – already used.  
“UNWED” – introduces W, D.  
D is okay, W is new.  
But we need to include N, and in “UNTIL” N was in position 2.  
So in “UNWED”, N is in position 1 – allowed.  
But E is ruled out.  
So scratch.  
“UNZIP” – introduces Z, P.  
Z is uncommon, but acceptable.  
Positions: U in 1, N in 2 – but in Guess 2, U was in 1 and N in 2, and feedback said they are in the word but wrong positions.  
So they must be in different positions now.  
Thus, U cannot be in 1 and N cannot be in 2 in the new guess.  
So “UNZIP” is invalid because U is still in 1 and N still in 2.  
Need to move both U and N to new positions.

Let’s list possible positions for U and N:
U cannot be in 1 (from Guess 2).  
N cannot be in 2 (from Guess 2).

Possible positions:
U: 2,3,4,5  
N: 1,3,4,5  

We need a word that satisfies these constraints and uses only allowed letters.

Let’s try “DUCHN” – but C, H, D are new, but N is in 5, U in 2.  
But “DUCHN” is not a valid English word.  
“CHUNK” – C, H, K new; N in 3, U in 2.  
Valid word.  
Check letters: C,H,U,N,K.  
All are allowed (not in the ruled-out list).  
Positions: U in 2 (allowed), N in 3 (allowed).  
This seems good.

Another candidate: “FUNNY” – repeats N, and F is new.  
But N is in 4 and 5, U is not present.  
So invalid (must include U).  
“PUCKY” – P,U,C,K,Y; no N.  
Invalid.  
“DUNNY” – N in 3,4, U in 2.  
Valid word.  
Letters: D,U,N,N,Y.  
D and Y are new.  
Positions: U in 2 (allowed), N in 3 and 4 (allowed).  
But it repeats N, which is acceptable as long as both U and N are present.  
But we want to maximize information, so “CHUNK” introduces more new letters (C,H,K) compared to DUNNY (D,Y).  
Thus, “CHUNK” is better.

Let’s go with “CHUNK”.

Guess 3: chunk -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) U(-) N(-) K(-)

<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on CHUNK:

- C(x) → C is not in the word  
- H(x) → H is not in the word  
- U(-) → U is in the word, but NOT in position 3  
- N(-) → N is in the word, but NOT in position 4  
- K(-) → K is in the word, but NOT in position 5  

Summary of known letters:
- Must contain: U, N, K  
- Must NOT contain: A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L, C, H  

Letters still allowed (common ones): B, D, F, G, J, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Positions to avoid:
- U cannot be in 3  
- N cannot be in 4  
- K cannot be in 5  

We need a valid 5-letter word that uses U, N, K and only the allowed letters.  
Let’s try to place U, N, K in permissible positions and fill the remaining spots with allowed letters.

Possible structure (slots 1-5):
- Slot 1: B, D, F, G, J, M, P, V, W, Y …  
- Slot 2: same …  
- Slot 3: NOT U  
- Slot 4: NOT N  
- Slot 5: NOT K  

Let’s list possible placements:

Option 1:  
U in 2, N in 1, K in 3 → N _ U K _  
Need two more letters from allowed set.  
Example: N B U K D → “NBUKD” – invalid (not a word).  
“FUNKY” – uses F, U, N, K, Y.  
Check positions:  
F (1), U (2), N (3), K (4), Y (5).  
- U is in 2 (allowed)  
- N is in 3 (allowed)  
- K is in 4 (allowed)  
- All letters are allowed.  
“FUNKY” is a valid English word.

Option 2:  
U in 4, N in 1, K in 2 → N K _ U _  
Need two more letters.  
Example: N K B U M → “NKBUM” – invalid.  
“PUNKY” – P, U, N, K, Y.  
Positions: P(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), Y(5).  
Same as FUNGY but starting with P.  
Valid word.

Option 3:  
U in 5, N in 1, K in 2 → N K _ _ U  
Example: N K B M U → “NKBMU” – invalid.  
“JUNKY” – J, U, N, K, Y.  
Positions: J(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), Y(5).  
Valid word.

Among these, “FUNKY”, “PUNKY”, “JUNKY” are all valid.  
“JUNKY” is most common.

Let’s go with JUNKY.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several letters at once. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word with a mix of these vowels and consonants. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- Three common vowels: A, O, E
- Two common consonants: R, S
This gives me the maximum information possible with one guess, as many letters are among the most frequent in English.

<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in ""arose"" (A, R, O, S, E) are now known to be absent from the secret word.  
That means I can completely ignore those letters when choosing my next guess.  
I should pick a word that uses entirely different letters, ideally including some of the next-most-common consonants and vowels to maximize information gain.  
Good candidates among the remaining common letters include: T, N, L, I, C, U, D, M, P, etc.  
A balanced five-letter word using these is ""UNTIL"" (U, N, T, I, L).  
This gives me coverage of a new vowel (U, I) and three new consonants (N, T, L) that weren’t in the first guess.

Letters we now know are NOT in the word (x):  
A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L  

Letters that ARE in the word (- or ✓), but whose positions are unknown:  
U, N  

So the secret word contains both U and N, and they are NOT in their original positions from Guess 2 (until).  
In Guess 2, U was in position 1 and N in position 2, so they must be in different positions now.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both U and N (and only those letters not yet ruled out).
- U is NOT in position 1.
- N is NOT in position 2.

Remaining common letters we can still use: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, plus the required U and N.

Let’s pick a word that places U and N in new positions and introduces other fresh common letters.  
A good candidate is “MOUND”:  
- M, O, D are new letters (O was already ruled out, so scratch MOUND).  
Another candidate: “UNBROKEN” – too long.  
“FUNNY” – repeats N.  
“DUNNY” – repeats N.  
“BUNNY” – repeats N.  
“PUNY” – too short.  
“PUCKY” – introduces P, C, K, Y.  
Let’s check: P, U, C, K, Y.  
- P, C, K, Y are all new letters.  
- U is in position 2 (was in 1 before).  
- N is not in this word at all – so scratch.  
Need a word that includes N.

“DUNNO” – ruled out by O.  
“NUNCH” – introduces C, H, and moves N to positions 1 and 3.  
But U must be in the word, and in NUNCH it’s not present.  
So scratch.  
“UNCUP” – introduces C, P, but no.  
“UNFIX” – introduces F, X.  
“UNHIP” – introduces H, P.  
“UNJOK” – introduces J, O, K.  
“UNKNOT” – introduces K, T, O.  
“UNKIND” – introduces K, I, N, D.  
I is already ruled out.  
“UNLIT” – introduces L, I, T.  
All ruled out.  
“UNMUT” – introduces M, T.  
T is ruled out.  
“UPEND” – introduces P, E, D.  
E is ruled out.  
“UNDER” – introduces D, E, R.  
E, R ruled out.  
“UNFIT” – introduces F, I, T.  
I, T ruled out.  
“UNHOOK” – too long.  
“UNJUM” – introduces J, M.  
“UNKET” – introduces K, E, T.  
E, T ruled out.  
“UNLUG” – introduces L, G.  
“UNPEN” – introduces P, E, N.  
E ruled out.  
“UNPUS” – introduces P, S.  
S ruled out.  
“UNRUL” – introduces R, U, L.  
R, L ruled out.  
“UNSPOILED” – too long.  
“UNSET” – introduces S, E, T.  
S, E, T ruled out.  
“UNTIL” – already used.  
“UNWED” – introduces W, D.  
D is okay, W is new.  
But we need to include N, and in “UNTIL” N was in position 2.  
So in “UNWED”, N is in position 1 – allowed.  
But E is ruled out.  
So scratch.  
“UNZIP” – introduces Z, P.  
Z is uncommon, but acceptable.  
Positions: U in 1, N in 2 – but in Guess 2, U was in 1 and N in 2, and feedback said they are in the word but wrong positions.  
So they must be in different positions now.  
Thus, U cannot be in 1 and N cannot be in 2 in the new guess.  
So “UNZIP” is invalid because U is still in 1 and N still in 2.  
Need to move both U and N to new positions.

Let’s list possible positions for U and N:
U cannot be in 1 (from Guess 2).  
N cannot be in 2 (from Guess 2).

Possible positions:
U: 2,3,4,5  
N: 1,3,4,5  

We need a word that satisfies these constraints and uses only allowed letters.

Let’s try “DUCHN” – but C, H, D are new, but N is in 5, U in 2.  
But “DUCHN” is not a valid English word.  
“CHUNK” – C, H, K new; N in 3, U in 2.  
Valid word.  
Check letters: C,H,U,N,K.  
All are allowed (not in the ruled-out list).  
Positions: U in 2 (allowed), N in 3 (allowed).  
This seems good.

Another candidate: “FUNNY” – repeats N, and F is new.  
But N is in 4 and 5, U is not present.  
So invalid (must include U).  
“PUCKY” – P,U,C,K,Y; no N.  
Invalid.  
“DUNNY” – N in 3,4, U in 2.  
Valid word.  
Letters: D,U,N,N,Y.  
D and Y are new.  
Positions: U in 2 (allowed), N in 3 and 4 (allowed).  
But it repeats N, which is acceptable as long as both U and N are present.  
But we want to maximize information, so “CHUNK” introduces more new letters (C,H,K) compared to DUNNY (D,Y).  
Thus, “CHUNK” is better.

Let’s go with “CHUNK”.

From the new feedback on CHUNK:

- C(x) → C is not in the word  
- H(x) → H is not in the word  
- U(-) → U is in the word, but NOT in position 3  
- N(-) → N is in the word, but NOT in position 4  
- K(-) → K is in the word, but NOT in position 5  

Summary of known letters:
- Must contain: U, N, K  
- Must NOT contain: A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L, C, H  

Letters still allowed (common ones): B, D, F, G, J, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Positions to avoid:
- U cannot be in 3  
- N cannot be in 4  
- K cannot be in 5  

We need a valid 5-letter word that uses U, N, K and only the allowed letters.  
Let’s try to place U, N, K in permissible positions and fill the remaining spots with allowed letters.

Possible structure (slots 1-5):
- Slot 1: B, D, F, G, J, M, P, V, W, Y …  
- Slot 2: same …  
- Slot 3: NOT U  
- Slot 4: NOT N  
- Slot 5: NOT K  

Let’s list possible placements:

Option 1:  
U in 2, N in 1, K in 3 → N _ U K _  
Need two more letters from allowed set.  
Example: N B U K D → “NBUKD” – invalid (not a word).  
“FUNKY” – uses F, U, N, K, Y.  
Check positions:  
F (1), U (2), N (3), K (4), Y (5).  
- U is in 2 (allowed)  
- N is in 3 (allowed)  
- K is in 4 (allowed)  
- All letters are allowed.  
“FUNKY” is a valid English word.

Option 2:  
U in 4, N in 1, K in 2 → N K _ U _  
Need two more letters.  
Example: N K B U M → “NKBUM” – invalid.  
“PUNKY” – P, U, N, K, Y.  
Positions: P(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), Y(5).  
Same as FUNGY but starting with P.  
Valid word.

Option 3:  
U in 5, N in 1, K in 2 → N K _ _ U  
Example: N K B M U → “NKBMU” – invalid.  
“JUNKY” – J, U, N, K, Y.  
Positions: J(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), Y(5).  
Valid word.

Among these, “FUNKY”, “PUNKY”, “JUNKY” are all valid.  
“JUNKY” is most common.

Let’s go with JUNKY.

We now have four of the five letters locked in place:

- U is in position 2 (✓)
- N is in position 3 (✓)
- K is in position 4 (✓)
- Y is in position 5 (✓)

The only unknown is the first letter.  
From earlier eliminations, the set of still-allowed consonants is roughly:  
B, D, F, G, M, P, V, W, and a few rarer ones.

We need a 5-letter word that matches the pattern _ U N K Y.

Common valid completions:
- BUNKY (valid, means “boring”)  
- FUNGY (not a standard word)  
- PUNKY (slang, but not standard)  
- WUNKY (non-word)

The clearest standard word left is BUNKY.

Let’s try it.
