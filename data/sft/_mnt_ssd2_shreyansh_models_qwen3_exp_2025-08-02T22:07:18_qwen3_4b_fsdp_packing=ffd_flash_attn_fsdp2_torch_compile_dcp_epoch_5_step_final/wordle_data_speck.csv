2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. 

Looking at common letters in English, the letters E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C are very frequent. A word like ""AROSE"" contains 5 of these high-frequency letters (A, R, O, S, E) and can give us good coverage. However, since we don't have any prior information, any of these words would be equally effective.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" which includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. Between these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a good mix of vowels and consonants that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

This should give us good information about which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x)
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E
- Does NOT contain A, R, O
- Has S and E in positions different from 4 and 5 respectively (since S was in position 4 and E in position 5)

Good letters to use next: S, E (must use them), plus other common letters not ruled out (like T, N, I, L, U, etc.).

I want a word that:
1. Uses S and E (but not in positions 4 and 5)
2. Doesn't use A, R, O
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information

Possible candidates:
- STEIN (uses S, E, T, I, N - but E is in position 4, which was ruled out for E)
- STILE (uses S, T, I, L, E - E in position 5, ruled out)
- SNITE (uses S, N, I, T, E - E in position 5, ruled out)
