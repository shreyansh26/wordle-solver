For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- Three common vowels: A, O, E
- Two common consonants: R, S
This gives me good coverage of frequently used letters in 5-letter words, which should provide useful feedback for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- Letters definitely in the word: R, E

1. Contains R and E
2. Does not contain A, O, S
3. R is not in position 2
4. E is not in position 5

I’ll pick a word that re-uses R and E in different positions while introducing new common letters. ""TREAD"" is a good candidate:
- T, R, E, A, D
But A is already ruled out, so that won’t work.

Instead, let’s try ""ROUTE"":
- Letters: R, O, U, T, E
But O is ruled out, so that won’t work either.

Next, ""ENTRY"":
- Letters: E, N, T, R, Y
- Contains R and E
- Doesn’t contain A, O, S
- R is in position 4 (not 2) ✓
- E is in position 1 (not 5) ✓

Let’s summarize what we now know from both guesses.

Known letters (present but position unknown):
- R (from AROSE and ENTRY) – must appear at least once, but NOT in positions 2 or 4.
- E (from AROSE and ENTRY) – must appear at least once, but NOT in positions 1 or 5.

Known absent letters:
A, O, S, N, T, Y

Remaining common consonants and vowels we haven’t tried yet:
B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both R and E.
2. Does not contain A, O, S, N, T, Y.
3. R is NOT in positions 2 or 4.
4. E is NOT in positions 1 or 5.

A good next word should place R and E in new positions while introducing other common unused letters. Let’s try:

- Position R in 3 or 5 (since 2 and 4 are ruled out).
- Position E in 2, 3 or 4 (since 1 and 5 are ruled out).

Let’s pick a word that satisfies these constraints: “CREPE” would reuse E but add C and P; however, P is fine, but we’d rather test more vowels first. “DERRY” is invalid (Y is out). “FERRY” invalid (Y). “PERKY” invalid (Y). “CHERE” uses C and H but repeats E. “PERRE” repeats R.

A better choice is “CRUEL” but U is allowed. However, we want to test E in position 4. Let’s try “PERCH” – but H is fine, but P is in position 1, E in 2, R in 3, C in 4, H in 5. This introduces P, C, H while keeping R in 3 (allowed) and E in 2 (allowed).

But we can do better by testing more common letters. Let’s try “CREEK” – but repeats E and R. “FREAK” invalid (A). “CREAK” invalid (A). “DREEP” invalid. “GREED” repeats E and D is new. 

A good candidate is “CREPE” but P is allowed. However, we can try “CREPE” first. Alternatively, “PERGE” but G is allowed. 

Let’s pick “PERGE” – P, E, R, G, E. But repeats E. 

Best is to avoid repeats and test new letters. Let’s try “CHORE” – but O is out. “DRIER” invalid (I is allowed, but R repeats). 

Let’s try “PRIED” – P, R, I, E, D. This introduces P, I, D. R is in position 2 – but R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE feedback). So invalid.

Next, “PRIED” is out. Let’s try “FRIED” – F, R, I, E, D. R is in position 2 – invalid.

Next, “GRIED” – G, R, I, E, D. R in 2 – invalid.

“TRIED” – T is out.

“DRUEL” – D, R, U, E, L. R in 2 – invalid.

“FRUEL” – F, R, U, E, L. R in 2 – invalid.

“PRUEL” – P, R, U, E, L. R in 2 – invalid.

“CRUEL” is invalid. 

Let’s try R in 3. Word structure: _ _ R _ _ with E in 2, 3, or 4.

Let’s try “PRESS” – S is out.

“CREPE” – P is allowed, but E repeats. 

“CREPE” is acceptable even with E repeating, as we want to confirm E’s position and P’s presence. However, we can avoid repeats.

Let’s try “CRIMP” – C, R, I, M, P. But missing E.

We must include E. Let’s try “CRUEL” – already invalid.

“DRIER” – repeats R and I is allowed, but R repeats. 

“FRIER” – repeats R.

“GRIER” – repeats R.

“PRIER” – repeats R.

“TRIER” – T is out.

“CRUEL” – invalid.

“CREAK” – A is out.

“DREAD” – A is out.

“BREAD” – A is out.

“CREDO” – O is out.

“CREPE” – acceptable even with E repeating, but we can try without repeats.

Let’s try “CHORE” – O is out.

“DRIER” – repeats R.

“FRUIT” – T, Y out.

“CHIDE” – C, H, I, D, E. R is missing.

We must include R and E. Let’s try “CHIDE” – missing R. 

“CHIDE” is invalid.

“CIDER” – C, I, D, E, R. R in 5 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed). Introduces C, I, D. No repeats. This seems perfect.

Check constraints:
- Contains R (position 5) and E (position 4) – ✓
- Letters used: C, I, D, E, R – none of A, O, S, N, T, Y – ✓
- R not in 2 or 4 – in 5 – ✓

Thus, “CIDER” is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- Three common vowels: A, O, E
- Two common consonants: R, S
This gives me good coverage of frequently used letters in 5-letter words, which should provide useful feedback for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: R, E
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, O, S

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R and E
2. Does not contain A, O, S
3. R is not in position 2
4. E is not in position 5

I’ll pick a word that re-uses R and E in different positions while introducing new common letters. ""TREAD"" is a good candidate:
- T, R, E, A, D
But A is already ruled out, so that won’t work.

Instead, let’s try ""ROUTE"":
- Letters: R, O, U, T, E
But O is ruled out, so that won’t work either.

Next, ""ENTRY"":
- Letters: E, N, T, R, Y
- Contains R and E
- Doesn’t contain A, O, S
- R is in position 4 (not 2) ✓
- E is in position 1 (not 5) ✓

This seems like a solid second guess.

Let’s summarize what we now know from both guesses.

Known letters (present but position unknown):
- R (from AROSE and ENTRY) – must appear at least once, but NOT in positions 2 or 4.
- E (from AROSE and ENTRY) – must appear at least once, but NOT in positions 1 or 5.

Known absent letters:
A, O, S, N, T, Y

Remaining common consonants and vowels we haven’t tried yet:
B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both R and E.
2. Does not contain A, O, S, N, T, Y.
3. R is NOT in positions 2 or 4.
4. E is NOT in positions 1 or 5.

A good next word should place R and E in new positions while introducing other common unused letters. Let’s try:

- Position R in 3 or 5 (since 2 and 4 are ruled out).
- Position E in 2, 3 or 4 (since 1 and 5 are ruled out).

Let’s pick a word that satisfies these constraints: “CREPE” would reuse E but add C and P; however, P is fine, but we’d rather test more vowels first. “DERRY” is invalid (Y is out). “FERRY” invalid (Y). “PERKY” invalid (Y). “CHERE” uses C and H but repeats E. “PERRE” repeats R.

A better choice is “CRUEL” but U is allowed. However, we want to test E in position 4. Let’s try “PERCH” – but H is fine, but P is in position 1, E in 2, R in 3, C in 4, H in 5. This introduces P, C, H while keeping R in 3 (allowed) and E in 2 (allowed).

But we can do better by testing more common letters. Let’s try “CREEK” – but repeats E and R. “FREAK” invalid (A). “CREAK” invalid (A). “DREEP” invalid. “GREED” repeats E and D is new. 

A good candidate is “CREPE” but P is allowed. However, we can try “CREPE” first. Alternatively, “PERGE” but G is allowed. 

Let’s pick “PERGE” – P, E, R, G, E. But repeats E. 

Best is to avoid repeats and test new letters. Let’s try “CHORE” – but O is out. “DRIER” invalid (I is allowed, but R repeats). 

Let’s try “PRIED” – P, R, I, E, D. This introduces P, I, D. R is in position 2 – but R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE feedback). So invalid.

Next, “PRIED” is out. Let’s try “FRIED” – F, R, I, E, D. R is in position 2 – invalid.

Next, “GRIED” – G, R, I, E, D. R in 2 – invalid.

“TRIED” – T is out.

“CRUEL” – C, R, U, E, L. R in 2 – invalid.

“DRUEL” – D, R, U, E, L. R in 2 – invalid.

“FRUEL” – F, R, U, E, L. R in 2 – invalid.

“PRUEL” – P, R, U, E, L. R in 2 – invalid.

“CRUEL” is invalid. 

Let’s try R in 3. Word structure: _ _ R _ _ with E in 2, 3, or 4.

Let’s try “PRESS” – S is out.

“CREPE” – P is allowed, but E repeats. 

“CREPE” is acceptable even with E repeating, as we want to confirm E’s position and P’s presence. However, we can avoid repeats.

Let’s try “CRIMP” – C, R, I, M, P. But missing E.

We must include E. Let’s try “CRUEL” – already invalid.

“DRIER” – repeats R and I is allowed, but R repeats. 

“FRIER” – repeats R.

“GRIER” – repeats R.

“PRIER” – repeats R.

“TRIER” – T is out.

“CRUEL” – invalid.

“FREAK” – A is out.

“CREAK” – A is out.

“DREAD” – A is out.

“BREAD” – A is out.

“CREDO” – O is out.

“CREPE” – acceptable even with E repeating, but we can try without repeats.

Let’s try “CHORE” – O is out.

“DRIER” – repeats R.

“FRUIT” – T, Y out.

“CHIDE” – C, H, I, D, E. R is missing.

We must include R and E. Let’s try “CHIDE” – missing R. 

“CHIDE” is invalid.

“CIDER” – C, I, D, E, R. R in 5 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed). Introduces C, I, D. No repeats. This seems perfect.

Check constraints:
- Contains R (position 5) and E (position 4) – ✓
- Letters used: C, I, D, E, R – none of A, O, S, N, T, Y – ✓
- R not in 2 or 4 – in 5 – ✓
- E not in 1 or 5 – in 4 – ✓

Thus, “CIDER” is a valid next guess.

2. Does not contain any of the absent letters.
3. Uses only the remaining letters.

Possible structures: _ _ _ E R

Let’s think of common 5-letter words ending with ""ER"" that don’t use any of the excluded letters. Good candidates:

- B A L E R → A is excluded.
- P U L E R → P, U, L, E, R – all allowed.
- G R E E R → G, R, E, E, R – but R and E are already known, and we need to test new letters.
- M U L E R → M, U, L, E, R – all allowed.

Among these, ""FULER"" isn’t a valid word, but ""PULER"" is (though rare). A more common word is ""FUGER"" – but G and U are allowed, F is allowed.

Actually, let’s try ""FUGER"" – F, U, G, E, R. All letters are allowed by current constraints.

But let’s pick a more common word first. ""PULER"" is valid but uncommon. ""FUGER"" is also uncommon. 

Another option: ""LUGER"" – L, U, G, E, R. Valid and more common.

Let’s verify:
- L, U, G, E, R – none are in the excluded list.
- Matches the fixed ""ER"" ending.

Thus, ""LUGER"" is a good next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

“FRUEL” – F, R, U, E, L. R in 2 – invalid.

“PRUEL” – P, R, U, E, L. R in 2 – invalid.

“CRUEL” is invalid. 

Let’s try R in 3. Word structure: _ _ R _ _ with E in 2, 3, or 4.

Let’s try “PRESS” – S is out.

“CREPE” – P is allowed, but E repeats. 

“CREPE” is acceptable even with E repeating, as we want to confirm E’s position and P’s presence. However, we can avoid repeats.

Let’s try “CRIMP” – C, R, I, M, P. But missing E.

We must include E. Let’s try “CRUEL” – already invalid.

“DRIER” – repeats R and I is allowed, but R repeats. 

“FRIER” – repeats R.

“GRIER” – repeats R.

“PRIER” – repeats R.

“TRIER” – T is out.

“CRUEL” – invalid.

“FREAK” – A is out.

“CREAK” – A is out.

“DREAD” – A is out.

“BREAD” – A is out.

“CREDO” – O is out.

“CREPE” – acceptable even with E repeating, but we can try without repeats.

Let’s try “CHORE” – O is out.

“DRIER” – repeats R.

“FRUIT” – T, Y out.

“CHIDE” – C, H, I, D, E. R is missing.

We must include R and E. Let’s try “CHIDE” – missing R. 

“CHIDE” is invalid.

“CIDER” – C, I, D, E, R. R in 5 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed). Introduces C, I, D. No repeats. This seems perfect.

Check constraints:
- Contains R (position 5) and E (position 4) – ✓
- Letters used: C, I, D, E, R – none of A, O, S, N, T, Y – ✓
- R not in 2 or 4 – in 5 – ✓
- E not in 1 or 5 – in 4 – ✓

Thus, “CIDER” is a valid next guess.

From the new feedback on CIDER:

- C(x) → C is not in the word.
- I(x) → I is not in the word.
- D(x) → D is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- R(✓) → R is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So now we know:
- Exact placement: _ _ _ E R
- Letters definitely absent: A, O, S, N, T, Y, C, I, D
- Remaining common letters to test: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with ""ER"" (positions 4 and 5 fixed as E and R).
2. Does not contain any of the absent letters.
3. Uses only the remaining letters.

Possible structures: _ _ _ E R

Let’s think of common 5-letter words ending with ""ER"" that don’t use any of the excluded letters. Good candidates:
- F U L E R → F, U, L, E, R – all allowed.
- B A L E R → A is excluded.
- P U L E R → P, U, L, E, R – all allowed.
- G R E E R → G, R, E, E, R – but R and E are already known, and we need to test new letters.
- M U L E R → M, U, L, E, R – all allowed.

Among these, ""FULER"" isn’t a valid word, but ""PULER"" is (though rare). A more common word is ""FUGER"" – but G and U are allowed, F is allowed.

Actually, let’s try ""FUGER"" – F, U, G, E, R. All letters are allowed by current constraints.

But let’s pick a more common word first. ""PULER"" is valid but uncommon. ""FUGER"" is also uncommon. 

Another option: ""LUGER"" – L, U, G, E, R. Valid and more common.

Let’s verify:
- L, U, G, E, R – none are in the excluded list.
- Matches the fixed ""ER"" ending.

Thus, ""LUGER"" is a good next guess.

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- Three common vowels: A, O, E
- Two common consonants: R, S
This gives me good coverage of frequently used letters in 5-letter words, which should provide useful feedback for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: R, E
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, O, S

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R and E
2. Does not contain A, O, S
3. R is not in position 2
4. E is not in position 5

I’ll pick a word that re-uses R and E in different positions while introducing new common letters. ""TREAD"" is a good candidate:
- T, R, E, A, D
But A is already ruled out, so that won’t work.

Instead, let’s try ""ROUTE"":
- Letters: R, O, U, T, E
But O is ruled out, so that won’t work either.

Next, ""ENTRY"":
- Letters: E, N, T, R, Y
- Contains R and E
- Doesn’t contain A, O, S
- R is in position 4 (not 2) ✓
- E is in position 1 (not 5) ✓

This seems like a solid second guess.

Let’s summarize what we now know from both guesses.

Known letters (present but position unknown):
- R (from AROSE and ENTRY) – must appear at least once, but NOT in positions 2 or 4.
- E (from AROSE and ENTRY) – must appear at least once, but NOT in positions 1 or 5.

Known absent letters:
A, O, S, N, T, Y

Remaining common consonants and vowels we haven’t tried yet:
B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both R and E.
2. Does not contain A, O, S, N, T, Y.
3. R is NOT in positions 2 or 4.
4. E is NOT in positions 1 or 5.

A good next word should place R and E in new positions while introducing other common unused letters. Let’s try:

- Position R in 3 or 5 (since 2 and 4 are ruled out).
- Position E in 2, 3 or 4 (since 1 and 5 are ruled out).

Let’s pick a word that satisfies these constraints: “CREPE” would reuse E but add C and P; however, P is fine, but we’d rather test more vowels first. “DERRY” is invalid (Y is out). “FERRY” invalid (Y). “PERKY” invalid (Y). “CHERE” uses C and H but repeats E. “PERRE” repeats R.

A better choice is “CRUEL” but U is allowed. However, we want to test E in position 4. Let’s try “PERCH” – but H is fine, but P is in position 1, E in 2, R in 3, C in 4, H in 5. This introduces P, C, H while keeping R in 3 (allowed) and E in 2 (allowed).

But we can do better by testing more common letters. Let’s try “CREEK” – but repeats E and R. “FREAK” invalid (A). “CREAK” invalid (A). “DREEP” invalid. “GREED” repeats E and D is new. 

A good candidate is “CREPE” but P is allowed. However, we can try “CREPE” first. Alternatively, “PERGE” but G is allowed. 

Let’s pick “PERGE” – P, E, R, G, E. But repeats E. 

Best is to avoid repeats and test new letters. Let’s try “CHORE” – but O is out. “DRIER” invalid (I is allowed, but R repeats). 

Let’s try “PRIED” – P, R, I, E, D. This introduces P, I, D. R is in position 2 – but R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE feedback). So invalid.

Next, “PRIED” is out. Let’s try “FRIED” – F, R, I, E, D. R is in position 2 – invalid.

Next, “GRIED” – G, R, I, E, D. R in 2 – invalid.

“TRIED” – T is out.

“CRUEL” – C, R, U, E, L. R in 2 – invalid.

“DRUEL” – D, R, U, E, L. R in 2 – invalid.

“FRUEL” – F, R, U, E, L. R in 2 – invalid.

“PRUEL” – P, R, U, E, L. R in 2 – invalid.

“CRUEL” is invalid. 

Let’s try R in 3. Word structure: _ _ R _ _ with E in 2, 3, or 4.

Let’s try “PRESS” – S is out.

“CREPE” – P is allowed, but E repeats. 

“CREPE” is acceptable even with E repeating, as we want to confirm E’s position and P’s presence. However, we can avoid repeats.

Let’s try “CRIMP” – C, R, I, M, P. But missing E.

We must include E. Let’s try “CRUEL” – already invalid.

“DRIER” – repeats R and I is allowed, but R repeats. 

“FRIER” – repeats R.

“GRIER” – repeats R.

“PRIER” – repeats R.

“TRIER” – T is out.

“CRUEL” – invalid.

“FREAK” – A is out.

“CREAK” – A is out.

“DREAD” – A is out.

“BREAD” – A is out.

“CREDO” – O is out.

“CREPE” – acceptable even with E repeating, but we can try without repeats.

Let’s try “CHORE” – O is out.

“DRIER” – repeats R.

“FRUIT” – T, Y out.

“CHIDE” – C, H, I, D, E. R is missing.

We must include R and E. Let’s try “CHIDE” – missing R. 

“CHIDE” is invalid.

“CIDER” – C, I, D, E, R. R in 5 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed). Introduces C, I, D. No repeats. This seems perfect.

Check constraints:
- Contains R (position 5) and E (position 4) – ✓
- Letters used: C, I, D, E, R – none of A, O, S, N, T, Y – ✓
- R not in 2 or 4 – in 5 – ✓
- E not in 1 or 5 – in 4 – ✓

Thus, “CIDER” is a valid next guess.

From the new feedback on CIDER:

- C(x) → C is not in the word.
- I(x) → I is not in the word.
- D(x) → D is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- R(✓) → R is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So now we know:
- Exact placement: _ _ _ E R
- Letters definitely absent: A, O, S, N, T, Y, C, I, D
- Remaining common letters to test: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with ""ER"" (positions 4 and 5 fixed as E and R).
2. Does not contain any of the absent letters.
3. Uses only the remaining letters.

Possible structures: _ _ _ E R

Let’s think of common 5-letter words ending with ""ER"" that don’t use any of the excluded letters. Good candidates:
- F U L E R → F, U, L, E, R – all allowed.
- B A L E R → A is excluded.
- P U L E R → P, U, L, E, R – all allowed.
- G R E E R → G, R, E, E, R – but R and E are already known, and we need to test new letters.
- M U L E R → M, U, L, E, R – all allowed.

Among these, ""FULER"" isn’t a valid word, but ""PULER"" is (though rare). A more common word is ""FUGER"" – but G and U are allowed, F is allowed.

Actually, let’s try ""FUGER"" – F, U, G, E, R. All letters are allowed by current constraints.

But let’s pick a more common word first. ""PULER"" is valid but uncommon. ""FUGER"" is also uncommon. 

Another option: ""LUGER"" – L, U, G, E, R. Valid and more common.

Let’s verify:
- L, U, G, E, R – none are in the excluded list.
- Matches the fixed ""ER"" ending.

Thus, ""LUGER"" is a good next guess.

From the new feedback on LUGER:

- L(-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- U(✓) → U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- G(x) → G is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- R(✓) → R is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So far we know:
- Exact placements: _ U _ E R
- Letters definitely absent: A, O, S, N, T, Y, C, I, D, G
- L is in the word but not in position 1.
- Remaining available letters (from the alphabet excluding the absent ones): B, F, H, K, M, P, V, W, X, Z, and L (but L cannot be in position 1).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has the pattern _ U _ E R.
2. Uses only the available letters.
3. Places L somewhere other than position 1.

Possible letters for positions 1 and 3: B, F, H, K, M, P, V, W, X, Z, or L (but L cannot be in position 1).

Let’s list possible combinations:
- Position 1: B, F, H, K, M, P, V, W, X, Z
- Position 3: B, F, H, K, M, P, V, W, X, Z, or L (but L cannot be in position 1, so if L is in position 3, that’s fine).

We need to find common words fitting this pattern. Let’s think of common 5-letter words with the pattern ?U?ER.

Some candidates:
- B U L E R → B, U, L, E, R – all allowed, and L is in position 3 (allowed).
- F U L E R → F, U, L, E, R – same as above.
- P U L E R → P, U, L, E, R – same.
- H U L E R → H, U, L, E, R – same.

""BULER"" is a valid word (a variant spelling or slang term for ""bull""), and it fits all constraints:
- Pattern: B U L E R → _ U _ E R with L in position 3.
- All letters B, U, L, E, R are allowed by current constraints.
- L is not in position 1, so this satisfies L(-) feedback.

Let’s use ""BULER"" as the next guess.
