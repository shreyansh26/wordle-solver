For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains five common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels that appear in many words. This should give me good information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

From the feedback on “arose” we now know:
- S is in the secret word, but not in the last position.
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word contains S somewhere other than position 5, and does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains the letter S (and not in the 5th spot).
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.
3. Uses other common letters that haven’t been ruled out yet.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, E, O are out).

Let me pick a word that uses these. “until” is often a good second guess because it introduces new common letters (U, N, T, L) and places S in a different spot. However, “until” doesn’t contain S. I need a word that has S and avoids the forbidden letters.

“shout” has O (forbidden) and E (forbidden) in it, so that’s no good.
“spend” has E (forbidden).
“stunt” has no S in the 5th spot and avoids the forbidden letters, but it doesn’t contain S at all. I need S in the word.

“swing” has E (forbidden).
“spill” has no S in the 5th spot and avoids the forbidden letters.

Let me pick “spill”:
- S is in position 1, so it won’t be ruled out for position 5.
- P, I, L are all new letters.
- Avoids A, R, O, E.

This seems like a solid next guess.

2. The letter S is in the word, but it is NOT in positions 1 or 5 (because in arose it was in position 5 and got “-”, and in spill it was in position 1 and got “-”).

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains five common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels that appear in many words. This should give me good information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

From the feedback on “arose” we now know:
- S is in the secret word, but not in the last position.
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word contains S somewhere other than position 5, and does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains the letter S (and not in the 5th spot).
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.
3. Uses other common letters that haven’t been ruled out yet.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, E, O are out).

Let me pick a word that uses these. “until” is often a good second guess because it introduces new common letters (U, N, T, L) and places S in a different spot. However, “until” doesn’t contain S. I need a word that has S and avoids the forbidden letters.

“shout” has O (forbidden) and E (forbidden) in it, so that’s no good.
“spend” has E (forbidden).
“stunt” has no S in the 5th spot and avoids the forbidden letters, but it doesn’t contain S at all. I need S in the word.

“swing” has E (forbidden).
“spill” has no S in the 5th spot and avoids the forbidden letters.

Let me pick “spill”:
- S is in position 1, so it won’t be ruled out for position 5.
- P, I, L are all new letters.
- Avoids A, R, O, E.

This seems like a solid next guess.

From the two guesses so far we know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, P, I, L  
2. The letter S is in the word, but it is NOT in positions 1 or 5 (because in arose it was in position 5 and got “-”, and in spill it was in position 1 and got “-”).

So the secret word must:
- contain S exactly once, and that S must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- use only letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding A, R, O, E, P, I, L).

Remaining common consonants: T, N, C, D, M, H, G, B, F, K, etc.  
Remaining common vowels: U (since A, E, O, I are out).

Let’s try to build a word with S in position 2, 3, or 4 and only the allowed letters.

A good candidate is “tucks”:
- T, U, C, K are all new and allowed.
- S is in position 4, which hasn’t been ruled out yet.
- No forbidden letters appear.

This should give us more information about T, U, C, K and the correct placement of S.

So the secret word contains S somewhere other than position 5, and does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains the letter S (and not in the 5th spot).
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.
3. Uses other common letters that haven’t been ruled out yet.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, E, O are out).

Let me pick a word that uses these. “until” is often a good second guess because it introduces new common letters (U, N, T, L) and places S in a different spot. However, “until” doesn’t contain S. I need a word that has S and avoids the forbidden letters.

“shout” has O (forbidden) and E (forbidden) in it, so that’s no good.
“spend” has E (forbidden).
“stunt” has no S in the 5th spot and avoids the forbidden letters, but it doesn’t contain S at all. I need S in the word.

“swing” has E (forbidden).
“spill” has no S in the 5th spot and avoids the forbidden letters.

Let me pick “spill”:
- S is in position 1, so it won’t be ruled out for position 5.
- P, I, L are all new letters.
- Avoids A, R, O, E.

This seems like a solid next guess.

From the two guesses so far we know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, P, I, L  
2. The letter S is in the word, but it is NOT in positions 1 or 5 (because in arose it was in position 5 and got “-”, and in spill it was in position 1 and got “-”).

So the secret word must:
- contain S exactly once, and that S must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- use only letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding A, R, O, E, P, I, L).

Remaining common consonants: T, N, C, D, M, H, G, B, F, K, etc.  
Remaining common vowels: U (since A, E, O, I are out).

Let’s try to build a word with S in position 2, 3, or 4 and only the allowed letters.

A good candidate is “tucks”:
- T, U, C, K are all new and allowed.
- S is in position 4, which hasn’t been ruled out yet.
- No forbidden letters appear.

This should give us more information about T, U, C, K and the correct placement of S.

Current deductions:

- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, P, I, L, C, K  
- Letters that ARE in the word: S, U  
- Known positions:
  – U is in the 2nd spot (✓).  
  – S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 4, or 5.  
    Therefore S must be in position 3.

So the word has the pattern: _ U S _ _

Remaining allowed letters (excluding everything already ruled out):  
B, D, F, G, H, J, M, N, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the already-used S, U.

We need two more letters (one in position 1 and one in position 5) from the remaining set.  
Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, M, N, T, etc.  
No vowels left except possibly Y (but that’s rare).

Let’s look for common 5-letter words with pattern _ U S _ _ using only the allowed letters.  
A quick scan gives “musky” (but K is out), “bushy” (Y allowed), “hussy” (S already used once), “lusty” (L is out), “tusks” (K is out), “gushy” (not common), “dusky” (K is out).  
“bushy” seems the most plausible: B, U, S, H, Y — none of the ruled-out letters appear.

Let’s try “bushy”.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, P, I, L, C, K, B, H  
- Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:
  – U is in position 2 (✓)  
  – S is in position 3 (✓)  
  – Y is in position 5 (✓)

So the word has the fixed pattern: _ U S _ Y

Remaining allowed letters (excluding everything already ruled out):  
D, F, G, J, M, N, Q, T, V, W, X, Z

We need a letter for position 1 and position 4 from this remaining set.  
Common consonants left: D, F, G, M, N, T, W

Looking for common 5-letter words with pattern _ U S _ Y:

- D U S _ Y → “dusgy” (not a word)  
- F U S _ Y → “fusiy” (not a word)  
- G U S _ Y → “gusgy” (not a word)  
- M U S _ Y → “musgy” (not a word)  
- N U S _ Y → “nusgy” (not a word)  
- T U S _ Y → “tusgy” (not a word)  
- W U S _ Y → “wusgy” (not a word)

Hmm, none of these are valid. Let me double-check the remaining letters and possible combinations.

Wait, position 4 could also be any of the remaining consonants, and position 1 as well. Let me list all valid combinations:

Possible letters for position 1: D, F, G, J, M, N, Q, T, V, W, X, Z  
Possible letters for position 4: D, F, G, J, M, N, Q, T, V, W, X, Z

Looking for actual words:

- D U S D Y → “dusdy” (no)  
- D U S F Y → “dusfy” (no)  
- D U S G Y → “dusgy” (no)  
- D U S J Y → “dusjy” (no)  
- D U S M Y → “dusmy” (no)  
- D U S N Y → “dusny” (no)  
- D U S Q Y → “dusqy” (no)  
- D U S T Y → “dusty” (yes, this is a word)

“dusty” fits the pattern _ U S _ Y with D in position 1 and T in position 4, and uses only allowed letters.

Let’s try “dusty”.
