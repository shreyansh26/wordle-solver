### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. I'll use a word with common consonants and vowels to test multiple letters at once. 

A good starting word might be something like ""AROSE"" because it contains common vowels (A, O, E) and consonants (R, S). This should give me information about several letters in the first guess.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: O (now confirmed in position 1), E (confirmed somewhere, but not in position 5), A (in the word but not in position 1, 3, or 5).
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, C, N.
- Letters we still need to test: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We have O in position 1 and E somewhere (not position 5), and A somewhere (not positions 1,3,5). The remaining letters must be chosen from the still-allowed set.

A good next word should:
1. Keep O in position 1 (confirmed).
2. Place E in a new spot (not 5, and not already used in 2 or 3).
3. Place A in a new spot (not 1,3,5, and not already used in 2 or 3).
4. Introduce new consonants that haven’t been ruled out.

Possible positions:
- O _ _ _ _
- E can go in 2, 4 (but 4 is after A, which might be better if we know order)
- A can go in 2, 4 (since 1,3,5 are ruled out)

Let’s try to construct a word:
- O _ A _ E (but E can’t be in 5, so this is invalid)
- O A _ E _ (but E can’t be in 4 if we want to test A in 2)
- O _ _ A E (invalid because E can’t be in 5)

Alternative approach: Since A must be somewhere, and we’ve tried positions 1,3,5, the only remaining positions for A are 2 or 4. Let’s try A in position 2:
- O A _ _ _

Now we need to place E (not in 5) and introduce new consonants. Let’s try:

Oops, N is out. Let’s try ""OARED"":
- O (✓)
- A (position 2)
- R (out)
No good.

Next: ""OAKED"":
- O (✓)
- A (position 2)
- K (new)
- E (position 4)
- D (new)
But E is in 4, which is allowed.

Let’s check if OAKED is valid:
- O: position 1 ✓
- A: position 2 (new for A)
- K: new letter
- E: position 4 (new for E)
- D: new letter

No ruled-out letters used. This seems good.

Current confirmed facts:
- Position 1 is O (from arose and ocean).
- E is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (because it was in position 5 in arose and got “-”, and in position 3 in ocean and got “-”, and in position 4 in oaked and got “-”).  
  Therefore E must be in position 0, which is impossible.  
  Wait: let’s re-read the feedback carefully.

From arose: E(-) – E is in the word, but not in position 5.
From ocean: E(✓) – E is in the word and in position 3.
From oaked: E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 4.

So E is confirmed in position 3.

Similarly:
A is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (because it was “-” in arose positions 1, ocean position 2, oaked position 2).  
This is impossible – A cannot be anywhere.  
Wait again: let’s list all placements:

arose: A(-) – A not in 1, but in word.
ocean: A(-) – A not in 4, but in word.
oaked: A(-) – A not in 2, but in word.

So A must be in position 3 or 5.  
But E is confirmed in position 3.  
Therefore A must be in position 5.

So far:
O _ E _ A

Letters ruled out: R, S, C, N, K, D.

We need two more letters from the remaining pool (B, F, G, H, I, J, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

We also know:
- From arose: B, T, etc. are still possible.
- From oaked: G is still possible.

Let’s try to pick a common consonant pair.  
Good candidates: B, T, L, M, P, H, G, F.

Let’s try “OBEFA” – but F is uncommon after E.
“OBEGA” – G is possible, but double G is unlikely.
“OLEGA” – L and G are possible.
“OPHIA” – P and H are possible.

Let’s pick “OLIVE” – but E is already in 3, and we need O _ E _ A.  
Wait, we need O _ E _ A.

So the pattern is O _ E _ A.

Let’s pick the most common consonants for positions 2 and 4.  
Position 2: common consonants: B, T, L, M, P, H, G, F.  
Position 4: same.

Let’s try “OBEFA” – but F is at 4, B at 2.  
But “OBEFA” is not a valid word.

Valid word: “OBESE” – but S is ruled out.

“OVULA” – but U and L are possible, but A is fixed at 5.

Wait, we need O _ E _ A.  
Let me list valid English words fitting O _ E _ A:

- OBEFA – invalid
- OBEGA – invalid
- OBEIA – invalid
- OBEKA – invalid
- OBEPA – invalid
- OBEVA – invalid
- OBEYA – invalid

Hmm, none. Let me think differently.

Actually, the pattern is O _ E _ A.  
Valid 5-letter words:

- OBEFA – no
- OBEIA – no
- OBEKA – no
- OBEPA – no
- OBEVA – no
- OBEYA – no

Wait, let me think of common words:

- OBESE – S is out
- OLDER – R is out
- OLEOS – S, O already used
- OMEGA – M, G possible. This is a valid word.

OMEGA:
- O(✓) position 1
- M – new letter
- E(✓) position 3
- G – new letter
- A(✓) position 5

This fits all constraints.

Check ruled-out letters: M and G are not among R, S, C, N, K, D.

So OMEGA is a valid guess.
