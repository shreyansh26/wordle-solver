1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently appearing letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which appear in many 5-letter words
2. It has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
3. These letters are in different positions, which helps with placement information
4. It doesn't repeat any letters, maximizing information gain

This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

Remaining common letters to try: T, N, C, G, B, M, U, Y, etc.

A good candidate is ""BANAL"":
- B, N, U, L are new letters (but L was already ruled out from plaid feedback, so this is bad).
Wait, L is already ruled out, so this is invalid.

Next candidate: ""CANTON"" – too long.

""TABUN"" – has T, B, U, N, but A is in position 2 and ends with N (valid), but let's check letters: T, A, B, U, N – none of them are ruled out except L, etc. were already ruled out. This seems valid.

But ""TABUN"" is a valid word, but let me think of a more common word.

""CAMPS"" – has S (ruled out).
""TWANG"" – has W, G, T, N, A. This seems good: T, W, A, N, G – none ruled out, A is in position 3 (invalid).
""TWANG"" is invalid because A is in position 3.

""CHANT"" is invalid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently appearing letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which appear in many 5-letter words
2. It has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
3. These letters are in different positions, which helps with placement information
4. It doesn't repeat any letters, maximizing information gain

This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

Good vowels left to try: I, U (since A is already confirmed, and E, O are ruled out).

Let’s try a word that uses A in a different position and introduces new common letters. ""PLAID"" comes to mind:
- P, L, I, D are all new letters.
- A is in position 2, satisfying the ""in word but wrong position"" clue.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: plaid -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) I(x) D(x)

From the two guesses we have:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word, but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are not in the word.

2. plaid → P(x) L(x) A(-) I(x) D(x)
   - A is in the word, but not in position 3.
   - P, L, I, D are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: A (unknown position)
- Letters ruled out: R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D

Remaining common letters to try: T, N, C, G, B, M, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A (not in position 1 or 3)
- Uses only the remaining letters
- Has good coverage of other common letters

Let’s try to place A in position 2 or 4 and introduce new common consonants and vowels.

A good candidate is ""BANAL"":
- B, N, U, L are new letters (but L was already ruled out from plaid feedback, so this is bad).
Wait, L is already ruled out, so this is invalid.

Next candidate: ""CANTON"" – too long.
""CANAL"" – has L (ruled out) and A in position 3 (invalid).
""TABUN"" – has T, B, U, N, but A is in position 2 and ends with N (valid), but let's check letters: T, A, B, U, N – none of them are ruled out except L, etc. were already ruled out. This seems valid.

But ""TABUN"" is a valid word, but let me think of a more common word.

""CAMPS"" – has S (ruled out).
""TWANG"" – has W, G, T, N, A. This seems good: T, W, A, N, G – none ruled out, A is in position 3 (invalid).
""TWANG"" is invalid because A is in position 3.

""CHANT"" – has C, H, A, N, T. A is in position 3 (invalid).
""CHANT"" is invalid.

""BUGGY"" – has B, U, G, G, Y. No A, so invalid.

""CHART"" – has C, H, A, R, T. R is ruled out, so invalid.

""CHANT"" – already considered.

""CAMPS"" – S is ruled out.

""TABBY"" – no A in correct position, but has B, T, A, B, Y – A is in position 3 (invalid).

""ANKLE"" – has E (ruled out).

""UNCLE"" – has E (ruled out).

""CHANT"" – invalid.

""TABUN"" – A is in position 2, which is allowed (since it's not position 1 or 3). Letters: T, A, B, U, N – none of which are ruled out. This seems valid.

But ""TABUN"" is a less common word. Let me think of something more common.

""TWANG"" – invalid as A is in position 3.

""STANG"" – has S (ruled out).

""CHANT"" – invalid.

""MANLY"" – has M, A, N, L, Y. L is ruled out, so invalid.

""ANTSY"" – has S (ruled out).

""AGONY"" – has O (ruled out).

""ANVIL"" – has L (ruled out).

""ANKLE"" – has E (ruled out).

""UNCLE"" – has E (ruled out).

""CANAL"" – has L (ruled out).

""BANJO"" – has O (ruled out).

""TABUN"" seems to be the best remaining option, but let me think of another.

""TWANG"" is invalid (A in position 3).

""CHAFF"" – has F, H, C, but A in position 2. Letters: C, H, A, F, F – none ruled out, A is in position 2 (allowed). This seems valid.

""CHAFF"" is a valid word, and:
- C, H, F are new letters.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).

This seems like a good guess.Based on the feedback:
- A is in the word but not in positions 1 or 3.
- Letters ruled out: R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D.

I need a word with A not in position 1 or 3, and without any of the ruled-out letters. ""CHAFF"" fits:
- C, H, F are new letters.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).

From the three guesses we now know:

- A is in the word, but not in positions 1, 3 or 4 (because it was marked “-” in positions 1, 3 and 2 respectively).
  ⇒ A must be in position 2 or 5.

- Letters that are definitely NOT in the word:
  R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D, C, H, F

That leaves these still-possible letters (in roughly frequency order):
Vowels: A (already confirmed), U, Y  
Consonants: B, G, J, K, M, N, Q, T, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- contains A exactly once (no duplicates needed unless helpful);
- places A in position 2 or 5;
- uses only the still-allowed letters.

Let’s try A in position 2 first, because it’s more common there.  
We want fresh common consonants. Good candidates: B, G, K, M, N, T, W.

A quick scan finds “BANAL” but L is ruled out.  
“GAMUT” – U is allowed, T is allowed, but M is allowed, and A is in position 2.  
Letters: G, A, M, U, T – none are on the banned list.  
This seems perfect.

Another candidate could be “MANLY”, but L is banned.  
“TABBY” has banned F and L already.  
“GAMUT” fits all constraints.

So I’ll go with “GAMUT”.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently appearing letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which appear in many 5-letter words
2. It has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
3. These letters are in different positions, which helps with placement information
4. It doesn't repeat any letters, maximizing information gain

This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently appearing letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which appear in many 5-letter words
2. It has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
3. These letters are in different positions, which helps with placement information
4. It doesn't repeat any letters, maximizing information gain

This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The feedback from ""arose"" tells us:

- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it is not first).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So we now know:
- The word does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
- It DOES contain A, but not in position 1.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A (but not as the first letter).
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left to try: I, U (since A is already confirmed, and E, O are ruled out).

Let’s try a word that uses A in a different position and introduces new common letters. ""PLAID"" comes to mind:
- P, L, I, D are all new letters.
- A is in position 2, satisfying the ""in word but wrong position"" clue.

This should help us gather more information.

Guess 2: plaid -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) I(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word, but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are not in the word.

2. plaid → P(x) L(x) A(-) I(x) D(x)
   - A is in the word, but not in position 3.
   - P, L, I, D are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: A (unknown position)
- Letters ruled out: R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D

Remaining common letters to try: T, N, C, G, B, M, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A (not in position 1 or 3)
- Uses only the remaining letters
- Has good coverage of other common letters

Let’s try to place A in position 2 or 4 and introduce new common consonants and vowels.

A good candidate is ""BANAL"":
- B, N, U, L are new letters (but L was already ruled out from plaid feedback, so this is bad).
Wait, L is already ruled out, so this is invalid.

Next candidate: ""CANTON"" – too long.
""CANAL"" – has L (ruled out) and A in position 3 (invalid).
""TABUN"" – has T, B, U, N, but A is in position 2 and ends with N (valid), but let's check letters: T, A, B, U, N – none of them are ruled out except L, etc. were already ruled out. This seems valid.

But ""TABUN"" is a valid word, but let me think of a more common word.

""CAMPS"" – has S (ruled out).
""TWANG"" – has W, G, T, N, A. This seems good: T, W, A, N, G – none ruled out, A is in position 3 (invalid).
""TWANG"" is invalid because A is in position 3.

""CHANT"" – has C, H, A, N, T. A is in position 3 (invalid).
""CHANT"" is invalid.

""BUGGY"" – has B, U, G, G, Y. No A, so invalid.

""CHART"" – has C, H, A, R, T. R is ruled out, so invalid.

""CHANT"" – already considered.

""CAMPS"" – S is ruled out.

""TABBY"" – no A in correct position, but has B, T, A, B, Y – A is in position 3 (invalid).

""ANKLE"" – has E (ruled out).

""UNCLE"" – has E (ruled out).

""CHANT"" – invalid.

""TABUN"" – A is in position 2, which is allowed (since it's not position 1 or 3). Letters: T, A, B, U, N – none of which are ruled out. This seems valid.

But ""TABUN"" is a less common word. Let me think of something more common.

""TWANG"" – invalid as A is in position 3.

""STANG"" – has S (ruled out).

""CHANT"" – invalid.

""MANLY"" – has M, A, N, L, Y. L is ruled out, so invalid.

""ANTSY"" – has S (ruled out).

""AGONY"" – has O (ruled out).

""ANVIL"" – has L (ruled out).

""ANKLE"" – has E (ruled out).

""UNCLE"" – has E (ruled out).

""CANAL"" – has L (ruled out).

""BANJO"" – has O (ruled out).

""TABUN"" seems to be the best remaining option, but let me think of another.

""TWANG"" is invalid (A in position 3).

""CHAFF"" – has F, H, C, but A in position 2. Letters: C, H, A, F, F – none ruled out, A is in position 2 (allowed). This seems valid.

""CHAFF"" is a valid word, and:
- C, H, F are new letters.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).

This seems like a good guess.Based on the feedback:
- A is in the word but not in positions 1 or 3.
- Letters ruled out: R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D.

I need a word with A not in position 1 or 3, and without any of the ruled-out letters. ""CHAFF"" fits:
- C, H, F are new letters.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).

From the three guesses we now know:

- A is in the word, but not in positions 1, 3 or 4 (because it was marked “-” in positions 1, 3 and 2 respectively).
  ⇒ A must be in position 2 or 5.

- Letters that are definitely NOT in the word:
  R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D, C, H, F

That leaves these still-possible letters (in roughly frequency order):
Vowels: A (already confirmed), U, Y  
Consonants: B, G, J, K, M, N, Q, T, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- contains A exactly once (no duplicates needed unless helpful);
- places A in position 2 or 5;
- uses only the still-allowed letters.

Let’s try A in position 2 first, because it’s more common there.  
We want fresh common consonants. Good candidates: B, G, K, M, N, T, W.

A quick scan finds “BANAL” but L is ruled out.  
“GAMUT” – U is allowed, T is allowed, but M is allowed, and A is in position 2.  
Letters: G, A, M, U, T – none are on the banned list.  
This seems perfect.

Another candidate could be “MANLY”, but L is banned.  
“TABBY” has banned F and L already.  
“GAMUT” fits all constraints.

So I’ll go with “GAMUT”.

It doesn\'t repeat any letters, maximizing information gain\n\nThis should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.\n\n<guess>arose</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'The feedback from ""arose"" tells us:\n\n- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it is not first).\n- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.\n\nSo we now know:\n- The word does NOT contain R, O, S, E.\n- It DOES contain A, but not in position 1.\n\nWe need a 5-letter word that:\n- Contains A (but not as the first letter).\n- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.\n\nGood consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.\nGood vowels left to try: I, U (since A is already confirmed, and E, O are ruled out).\n\nLet’s try a word that uses A in a different position and introduces new common letters.
