### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". These words cover frequently used letters.

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps quickly identify which vowels are in the word.
- It has 2 common consonants (R, S).
- It avoids less common letters like Q, X, Z, etc., which are unlikely to appear.

Therefore, I'll choose ""AROSE"" as the first guess to efficiently narrow down possible letters and positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- The word contains A and S, but R, O, E are excluded.
- A cannot be in position 1, S cannot be in position 4.

Next, I want a word that:
- Uses A and S in different positions.
- Avoids R, O, E.
- Introduces new common consonants and vowels (I, U, T, N, L, etc.).

A good candidate is ""SALSA"":
- S in position 1 (new position for S).
- A in position 2 (new position for A).
- L, S, A introduce new letters (L is common, second S is allowed since S is confirmed present).
- Avoids R, O, E.

This should help pinpoint exact positions for A and S while testing new letters.

What we now know for sure:

1. S is in position 1 (✓).
2. A is in position 2 (✓) and also in position 5 (✓).  
   This means the word has the pattern: S A _ _ A
3. L is not in the word (x).
4. R, O, E are not in the word (from Guess 1).

Good remaining consonants: T, N, M, D, C, K, P, B, G, H, etc.
