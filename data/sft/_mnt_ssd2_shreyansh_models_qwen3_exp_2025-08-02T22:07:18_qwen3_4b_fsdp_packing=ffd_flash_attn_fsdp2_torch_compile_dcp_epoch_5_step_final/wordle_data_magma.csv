### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words include:

- SLATE: covers very common letters S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: covers C, R, A, N, E
- STARE: covers S, T, A, R, E

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three very common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage for both vowels and consonants in 5-letter words.

From the feedback on “arose”:

- A(-) → A is in the secret word, but not in the 1st position.  
- R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x) → R, O, S, E are **not** in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A somewhere other than position 1.  
- Does **not** contain R, O, S, E.

Good consonants to try next (avoiding R, S): B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y.  
Good vowels: A is already known, so we might try I or U later.

A strong second guess uses fresh common letters while keeping A in a new spot.  
“ADMIT” uses A in position 2, plus common consonants D, M, T and the vowel I.  
Other candidates could be “PLAID”, “CABIN”, “LADY”, etc.

I’ll go with “ADMIT”.

So far we know:

- M is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- R, O, S, E, D, I, T are NOT in the word.

Letters left to try: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A (positions 3, 4, or 5)
- Contains M (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5)
- Avoids all the eliminated letters.

Possible candidates:
- MACHO – but O is eliminated.
- PLANK – no A or M.
- LUMPY – no A.
- CAMPS – S is eliminated.
- HUMID – I and D are eliminated.
- PANTY – T and Y are eliminated.
- GAMUT – U and T are eliminated.
- LAMIA – I and A in wrong positions, and A is in position 2 (invalid).
- BUMPY – no A.
- CAMPY – C, A, M, P, Y. Y is allowed, P is allowed. A is in position 2 (invalid).
- CAMPS – S is eliminated.
- LAMPS – S is eliminated.
- FANCY – C, A, N, Y. A is in position 2 (invalid).
- MAFIA – F, A, M, I. I is eliminated.
- LAMMA – M is repeated, but A is in position 3 (valid), M is in positions 1 and 4 (valid). However, double M might not be optimal.
- KAMAC – C, A, M, K. A is in position 2 (invalid).
- GAMMA – G, A, M, M. A is in position 2 (invalid), and M is in positions 3 and 4 (invalid).
- CAMUS – S is eliminated.
- LAMMA seems the best so far: A in position 3, M in positions 1 and 4. But double M is less optimal.

Alternative approach: use C, A, M, P, U, N, etc.

Best candidate: PLANK – but no A or M.

Wait, we need both A and M. Let me list words with both A and M avoiding the eliminated letters:

- MACHO – O eliminated.
- MAMBA – B is allowed, A in position 2 (invalid).
- MAFFIA – F, I, I eliminated.
- MAJOR – O, R, S eliminated.
- MAMBO – O, S eliminated.
- MAMMA – A in position 3, M in positions 1 and 4. Double M, but valid.
- MAMBO – O, S eliminated.
- MAFIA – I eliminated.
- CAMPS – S eliminated.
- LAMMA – same as above.

Remaining letters: B,C,F,G,H,K,L,M,N,P,U,V,W,Y,A

- BAMBAS – too long
- LAMAS – too short
- MAMAS – too short
- CAMAS – too short
- GAMAS – too short
- KAMAS – too short

Best valid 5-letter word: MAMMA or KAMAL or LAMMA.

Among these, MAMMA uses M twice and A once, which is acceptable.

Let's go with MAMMA.

But wait, MAMMA has M in positions 1,3,4. A in positions 2,5. But we know A is not in position 2 (from admit feedback: A(-) in position 1, but not sure about position 2). Actually, the feedback only said A is not in position 1 (from arose: A(-) in position 1), and from admit: A(-) in position 1 again. So A could be in positions 2,3,4,5.

In MAMMA: A is in positions 2 and 5. M is in positions 1,3,4. This satisfies:
- A is in word (positions 2,5)
- M is in word (positions 1,3,4)
- No eliminated letters (R,O,S,E,D,I,T)

MAMMA seems valid.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words include:

- SLATE: covers very common letters S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: covers C, R, A, N, E
- STARE: covers S, T, A, R, E

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three very common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage for both vowels and consonants in 5-letter words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:

- A(-) → A is in the secret word, but not in the 1st position.  
- R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x) → R, O, S, E are **not** in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A somewhere other than position 1.  
- Does **not** contain R, O, S, E.

Good consonants to try next (avoiding R, S): B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y.  
Good vowels: A is already known, so we might try I or U later.

A strong second guess uses fresh common letters while keeping A in a new spot.  
“ADMIT” uses A in position 2, plus common consonants D, M, T and the vowel I.  
Other candidates could be “PLAID”, “CABIN”, “LADY”, etc.

I’ll go with “ADMIT”.

So far we know:
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 2.
- M is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- R, O, S, E, D, I, T are NOT in the word.

Letters left to try: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A (positions 3, 4, or 5)
- Contains M (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5)
- Avoids all the eliminated letters.

Possible candidates:
- MACHO – but O is eliminated.
- PLANK – no A or M.
- LUMPY – no A.
- CAMPS – S is eliminated.
- HUMID – I and D are eliminated.
- PANTY – T and Y are eliminated.
- GAMUT – U and T are eliminated.
- LAMIA – I and A in wrong positions, and A is in position 2 (invalid).
- BUMPY – no A.
- CAMPY – C, A, M, P, Y. Y is allowed, P is allowed. A is in position 2 (invalid).
- CAMPS – S is eliminated.
- LAMPS – S is eliminated.
- FANCY – C, A, N, Y. A is in position 2 (invalid).
- MAFIA – F, A, M, I. I is eliminated.
- LAMMA – M is repeated, but A is in position 3 (valid), M is in positions 1 and 4 (valid). However, double M might not be optimal.
- KAMAC – C, A, M, K. A is in position 2 (invalid).
- GAMMA – G, A, M, M. A is in position 2 (invalid), and M is in positions 3 and 4 (invalid).
- CAMUS – S is eliminated.
- LAMMA seems the best so far: A in position 3, M in positions 1 and 4. But double M is less optimal.

Alternative approach: use C, A, M, P, U, N, etc.

Best candidate: PLANK – but no A or M.

Wait, we need both A and M. Let me list words with both A and M avoiding the eliminated letters:

- MACHO – O eliminated.
- MAMBA – B is allowed, A in position 2 (invalid).
- MAFFIA – F, I, I eliminated.
- MAJOR – O, R, S eliminated.
- MAMBO – O, S eliminated.
- MAMMA – A in position 3, M in positions 1 and 4. Double M, but valid.
- MAMBO – O, S eliminated.
- MAFIA – I eliminated.
- CAMPS – S eliminated.
- LAMMA – same as above.

Another candidate: CAMBY – B is allowed, A in position 2 (invalid).

Let me try: CAMPS – S eliminated.

How about: CAMUS – S eliminated.

Wait, let's try: CAMPA – P, A, but A is repeated in position 4 (valid), M in position 2 (valid). C is allowed.

But ""cam pa"" is not a word.

Actually, ""CAMPA"" is not valid.

Valid word: CAMPAIGN – too long.

Valid word: CAMPS – S eliminated.

Valid word: CAMPO – O eliminated.

Valid word: CAMMY – Y is allowed, A in position 2 (invalid).

Valid word: CAMBA – B is allowed, A in position 2 (invalid).

Valid word: CAMPA – not valid.

Valid word: CAMPA – not valid.

Valid word: CAMPA – not valid.

Let me try: MAMBA – A in position 2 (invalid).

Valid word: MAMBA – A in position 2 (invalid).

Valid word: MAMBA – same.

Valid word: MAMBA – same.

Valid word: MAMBA – same.

Wait, let's list all valid 5-letter words with A and M, avoiding eliminated letters (R,O,S,E,D,I,T):

Eliminated letters: R,O,S,E,D,I,T

Remaining letters: B,C,F,G,H,K,L,M,N,P,U,V,W,Y,A

We need words with A and M, avoiding the above.

Possible words:
- MAMBA – A in position 2 (invalid)
- MAMMA – A in position 3, M in positions 1 and 4 (valid)
- LAMMA – same as MAMMA
- CAMMA – not a word
- GAMMA – G,A,M,M,A – but A is in position 2 (invalid)
- HAMAL – A in position 2 (invalid)
- KAMAL – A in position 3, M in positions 1 and 4 (valid)
- PAMPA – A in position 2 (invalid)
- BAMBAS – too long
- LAMAS – too short
- MAMAS – too short
- CAMAS – too short
- GAMAS – too short
- KAMAS – too short

Best valid 5-letter word: MAMMA or KAMAL or LAMMA.

Among these, MAMMA uses M twice and A once, which is acceptable.

Let's go with MAMMA.

But wait, MAMMA has M in positions 1,3,4. A in positions 2,5. But we know A is not in position 2 (from admit feedback: A(-) in position 1, but not sure about position 2). Actually, the feedback only said A is not in position 1 (from arose: A(-) in position 1), and from admit: A(-) in position 1 again. So A could be in positions 2,3,4,5.

In MAMMA: A is in positions 2 and 5. M is in positions 1,3,4. This satisfies:
- A is in word (positions 2,5)
- M is in word (positions 1,3,4)
- No eliminated letters (R,O,S,E,D,I,T)

MAMMA seems valid.

But is MAMMA a valid English word? Yes, it's a variant of mama.

Alternatively: KAMAL is also valid.

Let's choose MAMMA.

But let me check if there's a better word.

Another candidate: CAMPA – not valid.

Valid word: MAMBA – A in position 2 (invalid)

Valid word: MAMMA – seems best.

Thus, next guess: MAMMA.

Let's parse the feedback step by step.

From Guess 3 (mamma):
- M(✓) : the first M is correct in position 1.
- A(✓) : A is correct in position 2.
- M(-) : the third M is in the word but wrong position (cannot be position 3).
- M(✓) : the fourth M is correct in position 4.
- A(✓) : the fifth A is correct in position 5.

So the secret word has the pattern: M A _ M A

We know:
- Letters not in the word at all: R, O, S, E, D, I, T
- Letters in the word and their positions:
  - M in positions 1, 4
  - A in positions 2, 5
  - The third position is unknown, but it cannot be M (already in positions 1 and 4) or A (already in positions 2 and 5).

Possible letters for the third position (from remaining letters not eliminated):
B, C, F, G, H, K, L, N, P, U, V, W, Y

Looking for 5-letter words that fit the pattern M A _ M A.

Possible candidates:
- M A B M A → no valid word
- M A C M A → no valid word
- M A F M A → no valid word
- M A G M A → no valid word
- M A H M A → no valid word
- M A K M A → no valid word
- M A L M A → no valid word
- M A N M A → no valid word
- M A P M A → no valid word
- M A U M A → no valid word
- M A V M A → no valid word
- M A W M A → no valid word
- M A Y M A → no valid word

Hmm, none of these seem to be valid English words. Let me think differently - perhaps I'm missing some letters or there's a typo. The pattern is definitely M A _ M A.

Looking up valid English words with the pattern M A _ M A:
- MAMMA - already tried
- MAAMA - not valid
- MAGMA - fits the pattern: M A G M A

Checking MAGMA:
- M in positions 1,4 - correct
- A in positions 2,5 - correct
- G in position 3 - not yet tested, but not eliminated

Letters used: M, A, G
Letters not eliminated: G is allowed (not in the previously eliminated list)

Thus, MAGMA is a valid candidate that fits all feedback.

Based on the feedback, the secret word must be M A _ M A. The only valid English word fitting this pattern is MAGMA.
