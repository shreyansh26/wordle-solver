For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. Among these, words like ""AROSE"" or ""RAISE"" are good because they contain multiple vowels and common consonants. 

""AROSE"" is particularly good because:
- A is the most common vowel
- R and S are very common consonants
- O and E are also frequent vowels
This gives us good coverage of common letters across different positions.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" but since I don't have any prior feedback, any of these top-5-letter-frequency words would be equally valid. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers a good spread of common letters.

From the feedback on “arose” we now know:
- R is in the word and is in the correct (second) position.
- A, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the pattern is _ R _ _ _ and we must avoid A, O, S, E.

We need a word that:
- Has R in the 2nd position.
- Does not contain A, O, S, E.
- Uses only the remaining common letters (T, I, N, L, U, D, C, etc.).

A good next step is to test other common letters in positions 1, 3, 4, 5.  
I’ll pick a word that introduces several new common letters while keeping R fixed.  
“TRIUN” is invalid (not a real word).  
“DRINK” fits: D, R, I, N, K — all allowed letters and common.  
Let’s try “drink”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. Among these, words like ""AROSE"" or ""RAISE"" are good because they contain multiple vowels and common consonants. 

""AROSE"" is particularly good because:
- A is the most common vowel
- R and S are very common consonants
- O and E are also frequent vowels
This gives us good coverage of common letters across different positions.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" but since I don't have any prior feedback, any of these top-5-letter-frequency words would be equally valid. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers a good spread of common letters.

From the feedback on “arose” we now know:
- R is in the word and is in the correct (second) position.
- A, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the pattern is _ R _ _ _ and we must avoid A, O, S, E.

We need a word that:
- Has R in the 2nd position.
- Does not contain A, O, S, E.
- Uses only the remaining common letters (T, I, N, L, U, D, C, etc.).

A good next step is to test other common letters in positions 1, 3, 4, 5.  
I’ll pick a word that introduces several new common letters while keeping R fixed.  
“TRIUN” is invalid (not a real word).  
“DRINK” fits: D, R, I, N, K — all allowed letters and common.

Let’s try to pick a word that:
1. Keeps the pattern _ R I _ _
2. Places K in position 4 or 1
3. Uses other common letters we haven’t ruled out.

A good candidate is “TRICK”:
- T is common and not ruled out.
- R and I are already confirmed in positions 2 and 3.
- C is common and not ruled out.
- K placed in position 4 (which is allowed because K was marked “-” in position 5 last time).

This should give us more information about T, C and confirm where K belongs.

We now know the pattern is _ R I K _ and the letters NOT in the word are:
A, O, S, E, D, N, T, C, P, B

Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:
- R is 2nd
- I is 3rd
- K is 4th

So the word is of the form ? R I K ? where ? can be any letter not in the forbidden list.

Allowed letters left: F, G, H, L, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for common 5-letter words matching this pattern:
- FRIKI – not a valid word
- GRIK? – no common word
- HRIK? – none
- LRIK? – none
- MRIK? – none
- URIK? – none
- VRIK? – none
- WRIK? – none
- YRIK? – none

However, ""GRIM"" is not matching. Wait, let me think of actual words.

Valid words fitting _ R I K _:
- FRISK – but S is ruled out
- GRISK – S is ruled out
- PRISK – P is ruled out
- TRISK – T is ruled out
- BRISK – B and S are ruled out
- CRICK – C is ruled out
- DRICK – D is ruled out
- PRICK – P is ruled out
- BRICK – B is ruled out

Looking again, the only common word left is ""FRISK"", but S is ruled out. This suggests we might need to think of less common words.

Another approach: the fifth letter could be any allowed letter. Let's list possible endings:

Possible endings: F, G, H, L, M, U, V, W, Y

Possible words:
- FRIKF – not a word
- FRIKG – not a word
- FRIKH – not a word
- FRIKL – not a word
- FRIKM – not a word
- FRIKU – not a word
- FRIKV – not a word
- FRIKW – not a word
- FRIKY – not a word

This suggests the word might be ""FRISK"", but S is ruled out. This implies we might have missed something.

Wait, let me re-examine the feedback. The feedback says K is in the word but not in positions 1,2,3,5. This leaves only position 4 for K. So the pattern is definitely _ R I K _.

The only remaining possibility is that the first and fifth letters are from the allowed list. The most common word fitting this is ""FRISK"", but S is ruled out. 

Looking deeper, the word ""GRIM"" is not fitting. However, ""GRIM"" is 4 letters. 

Upon reflection, the correct word must be ""FRISK"" but since S is ruled out, this suggests the word might be ""URIK?"" but no such word exists.

This indicates a possible error in our assumption. Re-reading the feedback: K was marked ""-"" in positions 5 and 4, meaning K is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5. This leaves positions 1, 2, or 3 for K. But positions 2 and 3 are already taken by R and I. Therefore, K must be in position 1.

So the pattern is K R I _ _

Now, the letters NOT in the word are: A, O, S, E, D, N, T, C, P, B

We need a word starting with KRI and ending with any allowed letter. The only common word is ""KRILL"", but L is allowed. 

Let's check:
- K is now position 1
- Pattern: K R I _ _

Possible endings with allowed letters: L, M, U, V, W, Y

Possible words:
- KRIKL – not a word
- KRIKM – not a word
- KRIKU – not a word
- KRIKV – not a word
- KRIKW – not a word
- KRIKY – not a word

This suggests the word is ""KRILL"" but that has two L's and the ending L is allowed. However, ""KRILL"" is 5 letters.

Upon checking, the correct word must be ""KRILL"" but this seems unlikely. 

Re-evaluating: the only possible word left is ""KRILL"" but since L is allowed and not ruled out, this could be the answer.

However, a more plausible word is ""FRISK"" but S is ruled out. This suggests the word must be ""KRILL"".

But let me think differently: the word could be ""GRIM"" but that's 4 letters. 

Realizing the mistake: the word must be ""KRILL"" even though it's less common. 

Alternatively, the word could be ""URIK?"" but no such word exists. 

Upon careful reconsideration, the correct word must be ""KRILL"" as it's the only valid 5-letter word fitting the updated pattern K R I _ _ with allowed letters.

But this seems unlikely. Rechecking the feedback interpretation: K is in the word but not in positions 5 or 4. This leaves positions 1, 2, or 3. Positions 2 and 3 are taken by R and I, so K must be in position 1. Thus, the pattern is K R I _ _.

The only valid word starting with KRI and using allowed letters is ""KRILL"".

However, this seems incorrect. Let me re-examine the feedback:

The feedback for guess 5 (brick) was B(x) R(✓) I(✓) C(x) K(-). This means:
- B is not in the word
- R is in position 2
- I is in position 3
- C is not in the word
- K is in the word but not in position 5

This contradicts earlier interpretations. K was also ""-"" in position 4 in guess 4 (prick), meaning K is not in position 4 or 5. Thus, K must be in position 1 or 3. Position 3 is taken by I, so K must be in position 1.

Thus, the pattern is K R I _ _.

The only valid word is ""KRILL"".

But this seems unlikely. Realizing that ""KRILL"" is actually a valid word for young salmon. Given the constraints, this must be the answer.

Therefore, the next guess is ""KRILL"".
</think>

Based on all the feedback, the word must be K R I _ _ with the remaining letters from F, G, H, L, M, U, V, W, Y. The only valid 5-letter word fitting this pattern is ""KRILL"".
