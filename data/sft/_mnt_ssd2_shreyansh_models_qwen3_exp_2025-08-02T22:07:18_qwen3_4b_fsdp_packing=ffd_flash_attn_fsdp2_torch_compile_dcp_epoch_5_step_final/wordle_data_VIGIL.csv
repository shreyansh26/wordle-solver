- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common starting letters include S, T, R, N, L, and vowels like A, E, I, O, U. A good starting word should have a mix of these letters to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S: Very common starting letter and consonant
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Most common vowel in English

This combination gives us good coverage of frequent letters and positions, making it a strong first guess to gather initial feedback.

- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- T is NOT in the word (x)

Letters we can eliminate: S, A, T, E

Good remaining vowels to try: I, O, U

We also know L cannot be in position 2, so we'll try placing it elsewhere (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5).

A balanced word would include L plus other common letters not yet ruled out. Let's pick a word that uses L in a different position and introduces new common letters.

Possible candidates: FLING, DRILL, CLINK, PLUMB, GRILL, etc.

""FLING"" uses:
- F: common consonant
- L: known to be in the word
- I: common vowel
- N: common consonant
- G: common consonant

This seems like a good choice as it introduces new letters while placing L in position 2 (but we know L is in the word somewhere else, so this is still viable).

Common starting letters include S, T, R, N, L, and vowels like A, E, I, O, U. A good starting word should have a mix of these letters to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:

- BRIG – too short.
- LIGMA – not a valid word.
- GRILL – G in position 1 (allowed), R new, I in position 2 (allowed), L in position 4 (allowed), L in position 5 (allowed). This seems valid.

GRILL:
- G in position 1 (new position, allowed)
- R (new letter, allowed)
- I in position 2 (not position 3, allowed)
- L in position 4 (not position 2, allowed)
- L in position 5 (no restriction on duplicates)

This introduces R and checks GRILL as a valid word.

From the latest feedback on GRILL:

- G is in the word but NOT in position 1 (-)
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- I is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-)
- L is in the word and is in the CORRECT position 5 (✓)
- Second L is NOT in the word (x) — so the word has only one L.

So we now know:
- Must contain: L (fixed at position 5), I, G
- Must NOT contain: S, A, T, E, F, N, R
- I cannot be in position 3
- G cannot be in position 1
- Letters left to try: C, D, H, K, M, P, B, V, W, Y, U, O

We need a 5-letter word ending in L, containing I and G, with no forbidden letters, and I not in position 3, G not in position 1.

Possible patterns: _ _ _ _ L

Let’s list possible letters for each position:
- Position 1: cannot be G, R, S, A, T, E, F, N → allowed: C, D, H, K, M, P, B, V, W, Y, I, U, O, G (but G is allowed here since restriction is only for position 1 in GRILL feedback, but we saw G is in word somewhere, and now it’s not fixed yet)
- Position 2: same pool
- Position 3: cannot be I
- Position 4: same pool
- Position 5: L (fixed)

We need to place I and G in positions 1-4, with I not in 3 and G not in 1.

Let’s think of words ending in L with I and G:
- DICIG – not valid
- DICOL – not valid
- DICUL – not valid
- MIGAL – not valid
- PIGMY – not valid, Y is allowed but M is allowed
- VIGIL – V allowed, I in 2, G in 3, I in 4, L in 5 – but has I twice which we don’t know if allowed
- WIGAL – not valid
- CIGAL – not valid
- DILIG – not valid
- GIGAL – not valid
- HIGGL – not valid
- KIGAL – not valid
- MIGAL – not valid
- PIGAL – not valid
- VIGIL – seems valid, but has I twice
- WIGAL – not valid
- YIGAL – not valid

Wait, let’s check VIGIL:
- V allowed
- I in position 2 (allowed)
- G in position 3 (allowed)
- I in position 4 (allowed – we don’t know if duplicates are allowed, but the secret word could have duplicates)
- L in 5 (correct)

VIGIL is a valid English word.

Another option: G is not in position 1, so maybe:
- G in position 2 or 3 or 4
- I cannot be in 3

Let’s try G in position 2:
- _ G _ _ L, with I somewhere else (not 3)
Possible: D I G I L – not valid
- C I G _ L – CIGIL – not valid
- M I G _ L – MIGIL – not valid
- B I G _ L – BIGIL – not valid
- H I G _ L – HIGIL – not valid
- K I G _ L – KIGIL – not valid

G in position 3:
- _ _ G _ L
Possible: C I G _ L – CIGIL – not valid
- D I G _ L – DIGIL – not valid
- M I G _ L – MIGIL – not valid
- P I G _ L – PIGIL – not valid
- V I G _ L – VIGIL – same as before

G in position 4:
- _ _ _ G L
Possible: C I _ G L – CIGL? – not 5 letters
- D I _ G L – DIGL? – not valid
- M I _ G L – MIGL? – not valid

So VIGIL seems the only valid word fitting the constraints:
- Ends with L
- Contains I and G
- No forbidden letters
- I not in position 3
- G not in position 1

Let’s verify:
- V allowed (not in banned list)
- I in position 2 (allowed)
- G in position 3 (allowed)
- I in position 4 (allowed – duplicates possible)
- L in 5 (correct)

Thus, VIGIL is a valid next guess.
