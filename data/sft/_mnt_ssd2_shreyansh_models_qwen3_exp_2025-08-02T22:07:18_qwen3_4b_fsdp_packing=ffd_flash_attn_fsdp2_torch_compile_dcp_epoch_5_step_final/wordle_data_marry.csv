### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A good first guess should use a mix of these vowels and consonants. Some popular choices are:
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers 5 of the most common letters and has a good vowel-consonant balance.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- TRAIN (but E is not allowed, so this has I and N - but I is allowed)
- TRAMP (but P and M are allowed)
- CRANK (but K is allowed)
- DRAIN (but I and N are allowed)

- Letters known NOT to be in the word: O, S, E, T, I, N
- Positions to avoid for A: 1 and 3
- Positions to avoid for R: 2

Remaining common letters we can still use: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and R
- Does NOT contain O, S, E, T, I, N
- A is not in position 1 or 3
- R is not in position 2

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5
Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but not 2)

Let me think of words that fit:
- CRANK: C, R, A, N, K → N is excluded
- DRAB: only 4 letters
- GRAMP: G, R, A, M, P → P is allowed, but let's check positions:
   - G _  R A M P → R is in position 2 → invalid (R can't be in position 2)
- BRAG: B, R, A, G → A is in position 3 → invalid
- GRAPE: contains E (invalid)
- CARGO: contains O (invalid)
- DRAFT: contains T and F (T is invalid)
- BRAWL: contains W, L, B, A, R → positions: B(1), R(2) → R in position 2 is invalid
- CARGO: O is invalid
- FRANK: contains N (invalid)
- GRAVY: contains V, Y, but let's see:
   - G R A V Y → R in position 2 → invalid
- CRAMP: C, R, A, M, P → R in position 2 → invalid
- BURAK: contains U, R, A, K → positions: B(1), U(2), R(3), A(4), K(5)
   - A is in position 4 → allowed (not 1 or 3)
   - R is in position 3 → allowed (not 2)
   - Letters: B, U, R, A, K → none of the excluded letters (O, S, E, T, I, N)
   - This seems valid!

Let me confirm:
- BURAK: 5 letters, contains A and R
- No O, S, E, T, I, N
- A is in position 4 (allowed)
- R is in position 3 (allowed)

This looks like a good next guess.

From the three guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)

   - O, S, E are not in the word.

   - A is in the word but not in positions 1 or 3 (confirmed).

3. BURAK → B(x) U(x) R(✓) A(-) K(x)
   - B, U, K are not in the word.
   - R is in the correct position 3.
   - A is in the word but not in position 4 (confirmed).

So far:
- Letters known to be in the word: A, R
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: O, S, E, T, I, N, B, U, K
- Positions:
   - R is fixed in position 3 (✓)
   - A is in the word but not in positions 1, 3, or 4 → must be in position 2 or 5
   - Remaining allowed positions: 1, 2, 4, 5 (but A is restricted to 2 or 5)
   - R is in position 3

We need a 5-letter word with:
- R in position 3
- A in position 2 or 5
- No O, S, E, T, I, N, B, U, K
- Other letters must be from remaining common letters: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y

Let's consider both cases for A:

Case 1: A in position 2 (word pattern: _ A R _ _)
   - Possible letters for positions 1, 4, 5 from remaining set.
   - Common consonants left: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y
   - Looking for valid English words:
       - CRADY? Not valid.
       - DRAG? Too short.
       - GRAMP? Contains M, P - but let's see:
           - G R A M P → R is in position 3, A in position 2 - this fits!
           - Letters: G, R, A, M, P - none of the excluded letters.
           - Valid word.

Case 2: A in position 5 (word pattern: _ _ R _ A)
   - Need letters for positions 1,2,4 from remaining set.
   - Possible combinations:
       - C R I A? I is excluded.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A good first guess should use a mix of these vowels and consonants. Some popular choices are:
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers 5 of the most common letters and has a good vowel-consonant balance.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R is in the word but in the wrong position.
- O, S, E are NOT in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains A and R, but not in positions 1 or 2 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain O, S, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and R.
2. Does NOT contain O, S, E.
3. A is not in position 1.
4. R is not in position 2.

Common letters we can still use: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, M, P, etc.

Let me think of words that fit these constraints. Some candidates:
- TRAIN (but E is not allowed, so this has I and N - but I is allowed)
- TRAMP (but P and M are allowed)
- CRANK (but K is allowed)
- DRAIN (but I and N are allowed)
- GRANT (but G and N are allowed)

I'll choose ""TRAIN"" because:
- It has A (not in position 1) and R (not in position 2).
- It doesn't contain O, S, E.
- Uses common letters T, I, N.

   - R again not in position 2 (but we already knew that)
   - A again not in position 3 (but we already knew that)
   - M is in the word but NOT in position 4

So we now know:
- R is fixed in position 3
- A is in the word but must be in position 2 or 5 (since positions 1,3,4 are excluded)
- M is in the word but not in position 4
- Letters out: O, S, E, T, I, N, B, U, K, G, P
- Remaining possible letters: C, D, F, H, L, V, W, Y (plus A and R already placed)

We need a 5-letter word with:
- R in position 3
- A in position 2 or 5
- M somewhere else (not position 4)
- No banned letters

Let's consider both cases for A:

Case 1: A in position 2 → word pattern _ A R _ _
   - We have M to place in 1, 4, or 5
   - Possible letters for remaining positions from allowed set: C, D, F, H, L, V, W, Y
   - Try placing M in position 1: M A R _ _
       - Need two more letters from allowed set, forming a valid word.
       - MARCH? C and H are allowed, but we need to check if the word is valid.
       - MARCH is valid (a musical note).
       - Check letters: M, A, R, C, H - none are banned.
       - This seems valid.

Case 2: A in position 5 → word pattern _ _ R _ A
   - We have M to place in 1, 2, or 4 (but not 4 because M is in the word but NOT in position 4 from GRAMP feedback)
   - So M must be in position 1 or 2
   - Possible combinations:
       - M _ R _ A: need letters for 2 and 4 from allowed set.
       - _ M R _ A: need letters for 1 and 4 from allowed set.
   - Let's see:
       - M C R O A? O is banned.
       - M C R I A? I is banned.
       - M C R U A? U is banned.
       - M C R V A? Not a valid word.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A good first guess should use a mix of these vowels and consonants. Some popular choices are:
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers 5 of the most common letters and has a good vowel-consonant balance.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R is in the word but in the wrong position.
- O, S, E are NOT in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains A and R, but not in positions 1 or 2 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain O, S, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and R.
2. Does NOT contain O, S, E.
3. A is not in position 1.
4. R is not in position 2.

Common letters we can still use: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, M, P, etc.

Let me think of words that fit these constraints. Some candidates:
- TRAIN (but E is not allowed, so this has I and N - but I is allowed)
- TRAMP (but P and M are allowed)
- CRANK (but K is allowed)
- DRAIN (but I and N are allowed)
- GRANT (but G and N are allowed)

I'll choose ""TRAIN"" because:
- It has A (not in position 1) and R (not in position 2).
- It doesn't contain O, S, E.
- Uses common letters T, I, N.

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - O, S, E are not in the word.

2. TRAIN → T(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   - T, I, N are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2 (confirmed).
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (from TRAIN) or 1 (from AROSE).

So far:
- Letters known to be in the word: A, R
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: O, S, E, T, I, N
- Positions to avoid for A: 1 and 3
- Positions to avoid for R: 2

Remaining common letters we can still use: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and R
- Does NOT contain O, S, E, T, I, N
- A is not in position 1 or 3
- R is not in position 2

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5
Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but not 2)

Let me think of words that fit:
- CRANK: C, R, A, N, K → N is excluded
- DRAB: only 4 letters
- GRAMP: G, R, A, M, P → P is allowed, but let's check positions:
   - G _  R A M P → R is in position 2 → invalid (R can't be in position 2)
- BRAG: B, R, A, G → A is in position 3 → invalid
- GRAPE: contains E (invalid)
- CARGO: contains O (invalid)
- DRAFT: contains T and F (T is invalid)
- BRAWL: contains W, L, B, A, R → positions: B(1), R(2) → R in position 2 is invalid
- CARGO: O is invalid
- FRANK: contains N (invalid)
- GRAVY: contains V, Y, but let's see:
   - G R A V Y → R in position 2 → invalid
- CRAMP: C, R, A, M, P → R in position 2 → invalid
- BURAK: contains U, R, A, K → positions: B(1), U(2), R(3), A(4), K(5)
   - A is in position 4 → allowed (not 1 or 3)
   - R is in position 3 → allowed (not 2)
   - Letters: B, U, R, A, K → none of the excluded letters (O, S, E, T, I, N)
   - This seems valid!

Let me confirm:
- BURAK: 5 letters, contains A and R
- No O, S, E, T, I, N
- A is in position 4 (allowed)
- R is in position 3 (allowed)

   - Remaining allowed positions: 1, 2, 4, 5 (but A is restricted to 2 or 5)

- A in position 2 or 5
- No O, S, E, T, I, N, B, U, K
- Other letters must be from remaining common letters: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y

Let's consider both cases for A:

   - Possible letters for positions 1, 4, 5 from remaining set.
   - Common consonants left: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y
   - Looking for valid English words:

           - Letters: G, R, A, M, P - none of the excluded letters.
           - Valid word.

Case 2: A in position 5 (word pattern: _ _ R _ A)

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: TRAIN -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
Guess 3: BURAK -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(x) R(✓) A(-) K(x)
Guess 4: GRAMP -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(-) A(-) M(-) P(x)

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 2
   - O, S, E are out

2. TRAIN → T(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   - T, I, N are out
   - R still not in position 2
   - A still not in positions 1, 3, 4

3. BURAK → B(x) U(x) R(✓) A(-) K(x)
   - R is now confirmed in position 3 (✓)
   - A is still in the word but NOT in position 4
   - B, U, K are out

4. GRAMP → G(x) R(-) A(-) M(-) P(x)
   - G, P are out
   - R again not in position 2 (but we already knew that)
   - A again not in position 3 (but we already knew that)
   - M is in the word but NOT in position 4

So we now know:
- R is fixed in position 3
- A is in the word but must be in position 2 or 5 (since positions 1,3,4 are excluded)
- M is in the word but not in position 4
- Letters out: O, S, E, T, I, N, B, U, K, G, P
- Remaining possible letters: C, D, F, H, L, V, W, Y (plus A and R already placed)

We need a 5-letter word with:
- R in position 3
- A in position 2 or 5
- M somewhere else (not position 4)
- No banned letters

Let's consider both cases for A:

Case 1: A in position 2 → word pattern _ A R _ _
   - We have M to place in 1, 4, or 5
   - Possible letters for remaining positions from allowed set: C, D, F, H, L, V, W, Y
   - Try placing M in position 1: M A R _ _
       - Need two more letters from allowed set, forming a valid word.
       - MARCH? C and H are allowed, but we need to check if the word is valid.
       - MARCH is valid (a musical note).
       - Check letters: M, A, R, C, H - none are banned.
       - This seems valid.

Case 2: A in position 5 → word pattern _ _ R _ A
   - We have M to place in 1, 2, or 4 (but not 4 because M is in the word but NOT in position 4 from GRAMP feedback)
   - So M must be in position 1 or 2
   - Possible combinations:
       - M _ R _ A: need letters for 2 and 4 from allowed set.
       - _ M R _ A: need letters for 1 and 4 from allowed set.
   - Let's see:
       - M C R O A? O is banned.
       - M C R I A? I is banned.
       - M C R U A? U is banned.
       - M C R V A? Not a valid word.
       - C M R O A? O banned.
       - C M R I A? I banned.
       - C M R U A? U banned.
       - C M R V A? Not valid.
   - It seems hard to form valid words with A in position 5.

Therefore, the most promising candidate is ""MARCH"".

Remaining possible letters (from the alphabet minus all used or eliminated ones):

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with MAR and ends with two letters from {D, F, L, V, W, Y}.

Possible candidates:  
MARVD, MARVF, MARVL, MARVW, MARVY, MARYD, MARYF, MARYL, MARYV, MARYW

Checking which of these are valid English words:  
- MARVD – not a word

Wait, let’s re-examine the remaining letters and possible combinations more carefully.  
Actually, the only common letters left that can form a valid word with MAR are D, F, L, V, W, Y.

Looking at standard word lists, the only common word starting with MAR and using only those letters is:

M A R V Y – but that’s not a standard word.  
M A R V D – not a word.  
M A R V F – not a word.  
M A R V L – not a word.  
M A R V W – not a word.  
M A R Y D – not a word.  
M A R Y F – not a word.  
M A R Y L – not a word.  
M A R Y V – not a word.  
M A R Y W – not a word.  

However, ""MARRY"" is a valid word, but it uses Y twice, and we haven't ruled out Y twice yet. The feedback hasn't said anything about Y being used once or twice, so it's allowed.

So the word must be ""MARRY"".

Let's verify:
- M A R R Y  
- Letters used: M, A, R, R, Y  
- R is allowed to appear twice (no restriction in feedback against it).  
- Y is not yet used or ruled out.  

Therefore, the only possible word left is ""MARRY"".
