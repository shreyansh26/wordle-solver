### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Common starting strategies include using vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English words.

A good choice is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This combination gives us maximum information potential to determine which letters might be in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on “arose” we now know:
- R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (fifth letter).
- A, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is: _ R _ _ E  
Letters to avoid: A, O, S.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has R in position 2.
2. Has E in position 5.
3. Does NOT contain A, O, S.

I’ll pick a word that introduces new common consonants and a vowel that hasn’t been ruled out yet (I, U, Y, etc.).

A good candidate is “URINE”:
- U is a new vowel.
- R is confirmed in position 2.
- I is a new vowel.
- N is a new consonant.
- E is confirmed in position 5.

This gives us information about four new letters while respecting all constraints.
