For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""RAISE,"" or ""AROSE."" 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E
- RAISE: R, A, I, S, E
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E

""AROSE"" is particularly good because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should help us quickly identify which vowels are in the word and whether R or S are present. 

Another strong candidate is ""RAISE"" for similar reasons. However, ""AROSE"" covers O, which is slightly more common in certain positions, making it a solid first guess.

After considering these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides a good balance of vowels and common consonants to maximize information gain.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in position 5.

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains O, but O is not in position 3.
3. It does NOT contain A, R, or S.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that includes O somewhere else (positions 1, 2, or 4) and avoids A, R, S.

Possible letters left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Good candidates:
- COULD: C O U L D E → but D is not confirmed yet, and we have O in position 2.
- M O C K E → M, O, C, K, E – all letters are new and include O.
- T O P E → too short.
- L O N E → L, O, N, E – but N is not confirmed yet.
- P O K E → P, O, K, E – all new letters.

""MOCKE"" isn't a valid word. ""POKE"" is 4 letters. ""LONGE"" might be valid but is uncommon. ""TOKED"" is 5 letters but doesn't fit. 

A valid and common word is ""CLOVE"" – C, L, O, V, E. But V is new and O is in position 3 which was ruled out (- means O is not in position 3). So ""CLOVE"" is invalid because O would be in position 3.

Next option: ""DOUSE"" – but S is already ruled out.
""DOGE"" – too short.
""VOICE"" – I is new, C is new, but A is ruled out (no A here), V is new, O is in position 2 (valid), E is confirmed. But ""VOICE"" has I, C, O, V, E – all new letters except E and O. However, ""VOICE"" is 5 letters and ends with E. Let's check:
- V – new
- O – in word, position 2 (valid)
- I – new
- C – new
- E – confirmed position 5.

But ""VOICE"" has I in position 3, C in 4, O in 2. This seems valid.

Another option: ""FOGEY"" – but Y is new and F, G, Y are new. But ""FOGEY"" is 5 letters ending in Y, not E. 

""DOGEY"" – ends with Y.

""JOKE"" – too short.

""LODE"" – L, O, D, E – but O is in position 2 (valid), ends with E. D is new.

""LODE"" is a valid word meaning a deposit of minerals. But O is in position 2 (valid), ends with E. Letters: L, O, D, E. But we need 5 letters, so ""LODE"" is 4 letters. 

""LODES"" – S is ruled out.

""MOLE"" – M, O, L, E – but O is in position 2 (valid), ends with E. But ""MOLE"" is 4 letters.

""MOLES"" – S is ruled out.

""POKE"" – 4 letters.

""TOKE"" – T, O, K, E – but O is in position 2 (valid), ends with E. ""TOKE"" is 4 letters.

""TOILE"" – I, L, O, T, E – but O is in position 3 (invalid).

""VOICE"" – 5 letters, ends with E, contains O in position 2, no A, R, S. This seems valid.

""VOICE"" is a valid word meaning sound or message. It uses V, O, I, C, E. 

Another option: ""COVFE"" – but this is ""COVFE"" which is not a word.

""DOIVE"" – not a word.

""FOIVE"" – not a word.

""JOIVE"" – not a word.

""LOIVE"" – not a word.

""NOIVE"" – not a word.

""POIVE"" – not a word.

""VOIVE"" – not a word.

""WOIVE"" – not a word.

""YODE"" – too short.

""ZODE"" – not a word.

""VOICE"" seems to be the best 5-letter word fitting all constraints:
- Ends with E (position 5 confirmed).
- Contains O, and O is not in position 3 (here it's in position 2).
- Does not contain A, R, S.

Thus, the next guess should be ""VOICE"".

   Allowed letters (so far) are everything else except those six.

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ O _ _ E that uses only allowed letters.

Possible patterns:

Good remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z
Good remaining vowels: none (only O is allowed in position 2; other vowels are already ruled out or not needed).

Let’s look for common words that fit _ O _ _ E:
- B O _ _ E → “BOOGE” (invalid), “BONZE” (Z is okay) – but N and Z are new.
- D O _ _ E → “DONZE” (Z is okay), “DOLCE” (C is forbidden).

Among these, “MODEL” is invalid (ends with L, not E). “LONGE” is valid but uses G and N. “NODLE” is valid. “MONDE” is valid. “HONZE” is valid. 

Let’s pick “MODEL” – wait, it ends with L, not E.  
Let’s pick “NODLE” – ends with E, uses N, D, L (all new), and fits _ O _ _ E.

But “NODLE” is a valid word meaning a small piece of bread. However, it’s quite obscure. A more common word is “MODEL” – but it ends with L, not E. 

Another common word: “HOLME” – but M is okay, ends with E. However, “HOLME” is also obscure.

“GONPE” – invalid.

“BOOZE” – uses Z, but Z is okay, ends with E. But Z is usually a consonant, and “BOOZE” is valid. But it repeats O in position 1, which is allowed (but we already have O in position 2). However, “BOOZE” has O in position 1 and 2, which is allowed by the rules.

But let’s check “BOOZE”:
- B (new), O (position 1), O (position 2), Z (new), E (position 5).
But we know O must be in position 2, so “BOOZE” has O in position 1 and 2 – this is allowed, but it’s a bit redundant.

A better choice is “MODEL” – but it ends with L, not E.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""RAISE,"" or ""AROSE."" 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E
- RAISE: R, A, I, S, E
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E

""AROSE"" is particularly good because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should help us quickly identify which vowels are in the word and whether R or S are present. 

Another strong candidate is ""RAISE"" for similar reasons. However, ""AROSE"" covers O, which is slightly more common in certain positions, making it a solid first guess.

After considering these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides a good balance of vowels and common consonants to maximize information gain.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in position 5.

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains O, but O is not in position 3.
3. It does NOT contain A, R, or S.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that includes O somewhere else (positions 1, 2, or 4) and avoids A, R, S.

Possible letters left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Good candidates:
- COULD: C O U L D E → but D is not confirmed yet, and we have O in position 2.
- M O C K E → M, O, C, K, E – all letters are new and include O.
- T O P E → too short.
- L O N E → L, O, N, E – but N is not confirmed yet.
- P O K E → P, O, K, E – all new letters.

""MOCKE"" isn't a valid word. ""POKE"" is 4 letters. ""LONGE"" might be valid but is uncommon. ""TOKED"" is 5 letters but doesn't fit. 

A valid and common word is ""CLOVE"" – C, L, O, V, E. But V is new and O is in position 3 which was ruled out (- means O is not in position 3). So ""CLOVE"" is invalid because O would be in position 3.

Next option: ""DOUSE"" – but S is already ruled out.
""DOGE"" – too short.
""VOICE"" – I is new, C is new, but A is ruled out (no A here), V is new, O is in position 2 (valid), E is confirmed. But ""VOICE"" has I, C, O, V, E – all new letters except E and O. However, ""VOICE"" is 5 letters and ends with E. Let's check:
- V – new
- O – in word, position 2 (valid)
- I – new
- C – new
- E – confirmed position 5.

But ""VOICE"" has I in position 3, C in 4, O in 2. This seems valid.

Another option: ""FOGEY"" – but Y is new and F, G, Y are new. But ""FOGEY"" is 5 letters ending in Y, not E. 

""DOGEY"" – ends with Y.

""JOKE"" – too short.

""LODE"" – L, O, D, E – but O is in position 2 (valid), ends with E. D is new.

""LODE"" is a valid word meaning a deposit of minerals. But O is in position 2 (valid), ends with E. Letters: L, O, D, E. But we need 5 letters, so ""LODE"" is 4 letters. 

""LODES"" – S is ruled out.

""MOLE"" – M, O, L, E – but O is in position 2 (valid), ends with E. But ""MOLE"" is 4 letters.

""MOLES"" – S is ruled out.

""POKE"" – 4 letters.

""TOKE"" – T, O, K, E – but O is in position 2 (valid), ends with E. ""TOKE"" is 4 letters.

""TOILE"" – I, L, O, T, E – but O is in position 3 (invalid).

""VOICE"" – 5 letters, ends with E, contains O in position 2, no A, R, S. This seems valid.

""VOICE"" is a valid word meaning sound or message. It uses V, O, I, C, E. 

Another option: ""COVFE"" – but this is ""COVFE"" which is not a word.

""DOIVE"" – not a word.

""FOIVE"" – not a word.

""JOIVE"" – not a word.

""LOIVE"" – not a word.

""MOIVE"" – not a word.

""NOIVE"" – not a word.

""POIVE"" – not a word.

""VOIVE"" – not a word.

""WOIVE"" – not a word.

""YODE"" – too short.

""ZODE"" – not a word.

""VOICE"" seems to be the best 5-letter word fitting all constraints:
- Ends with E (position 5 confirmed).
- Contains O, and O is not in position 3 (here it's in position 2).
- Does not contain A, R, S.

Thus, the next guess should be ""VOICE"".Based on the feedback:
- E is confirmed in position 5.
- O is in the word but not in position 3.
- A, R, S are not in the word.

A valid next guess is ""VOICE"", which:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Has O in position 2 (not 3, satisfying the feedback).
- Contains no A, R, or S.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""RAISE,"" or ""AROSE."" 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E
- RAISE: R, A, I, S, E
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E

""AROSE"" is particularly good because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should help us quickly identify which vowels are in the word and whether R or S are present. 

Another strong candidate is ""RAISE"" for similar reasons. However, ""AROSE"" covers O, which is slightly more common in certain positions, making it a solid first guess.

After considering these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides a good balance of vowels and common consonants to maximize information gain.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in position 5.

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains O, but O is not in position 3.
3. It does NOT contain A, R, or S.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that includes O somewhere else (positions 1, 2, or 4) and avoids A, R, S.

Possible letters left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Good candidates:
- COULD: C O U L D E → but D is not confirmed yet, and we have O in position 2.
- M O C K E → M, O, C, K, E – all letters are new and include O.
- T O P E → too short.
- L O N E → L, O, N, E – but N is not confirmed yet.
- P O K E → P, O, K, E – all new letters.

""MOCKE"" isn't a valid word. ""POKE"" is 4 letters. ""LONGE"" might be valid but is uncommon. ""TOKED"" is 5 letters but doesn't fit. 

A valid and common word is ""CLOVE"" – C, L, O, V, E. But V is new and O is in position 3 which was ruled out (- means O is not in position 3). So ""CLOVE"" is invalid because O would be in position 3.

Next option: ""DOUSE"" – but S is already ruled out.
""DOGE"" – too short.
""VOICE"" – I is new, C is new, but A is ruled out (no A here), V is new, O is in position 2 (valid), E is confirmed. But ""VOICE"" has I, C, O, V, E – all new letters except E and O. However, ""VOICE"" is 5 letters and ends with E. Let's check:
- V – new
- O – in word, position 2 (valid)
- I – new
- C – new
- E – confirmed position 5.

But ""VOICE"" has I in position 3, C in 4, O in 2. This seems valid.

Another option: ""FOGEY"" – but Y is new and F, G, Y are new. But ""FOGEY"" is 5 letters ending in Y, not E. 

""DOGEY"" – ends with Y.

""JOKE"" – too short.

""LODE"" – L, O, D, E – but O is in position 2 (valid), ends with E. D is new.

""LODE"" is a valid word meaning a deposit of minerals. But O is in position 2 (valid), ends with E. Letters: L, O, D, E. But we need 5 letters, so ""LODE"" is 4 letters. 

""LODES"" – S is ruled out.

""MOLE"" – M, O, L, E – but O is in position 2 (valid), ends with E. But ""MOLE"" is 4 letters.

""MOLES"" – S is ruled out.

""POKE"" – 4 letters.

""TOKE"" – T, O, K, E – but O is in position 2 (valid), ends with E. ""TOKE"" is 4 letters.

""TOILE"" – I, L, O, T, E – but O is in position 3 (invalid).

""VOICE"" – 5 letters, ends with E, contains O in position 2, no A, R, S. This seems valid.

""VOICE"" is a valid word meaning sound or message. It uses V, O, I, C, E. 

Another option: ""COVFE"" – but this is ""COVFE"" which is not a word.

""DOIVE"" – not a word.

""FOIVE"" – not a word.

""JOIVE"" – not a word.

""LOIVE"" – not a word.

""MOIVE"" – not a word.

""NOIVE"" – not a word.

""POIVE"" – not a word.

""VOIVE"" – not a word.

""WOIVE"" – not a word.

""YODE"" – too short.

""ZODE"" – not a word.

""VOICE"" seems to be the best 5-letter word fitting all constraints:
- Ends with E (position 5 confirmed).
- Contains O, and O is not in position 3 (here it's in position 2).
- Does not contain A, R, S.

Thus, the next guess should be ""VOICE"".Based on the feedback:
- E is confirmed in position 5.
- O is in the word but not in position 3.
- A, R, S are not in the word.

A valid next guess is ""VOICE"", which:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Has O in position 2 (not 3, satisfying the feedback).
- Contains no A, R, or S.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. E is fixed in position 5 (✓ both times).
2. O is in the word and in position 2 (✓ in Guess 2).
3. Forbidden letters so far: A, R, S, V, I, C (they all got ×).
4. We still need letters in positions 1, 3, and 4.
   Allowed letters (so far) are everything else except those six.

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ O _ _ E that uses only allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
  ? O ? ? E

Good remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z
Good remaining vowels: none (only O is allowed in position 2; other vowels are already ruled out or not needed).

Let’s look for common words that fit _ O _ _ E:
- B O _ _ E → “BOOGE” (invalid), “BONZE” (Z is okay) – but N and Z are new.
- D O _ _ E → “DONZE” (Z is okay), “DOLCE” (C is forbidden).
- F O _ _ E → “FOUGE” (invalid), “FOLLE” (invalid).
- G O _ _ E → “GONZE” (Z), “GOLPE” (P is okay).
- H O _ _ E → “HONZE”, “HOLME” (M is okay).
- L O _ _ E → “LONGE” (valid, but G and N are new).
- M O _ _ E → “MONDE”, “MODEL” (invalid, ends with L).
- N O _ _ E → “NODLE” (D and L are new).
- P O _ _ E → “PONDE”, “POULE” (invalid).
- T O _ _ E → “TONZE”, “TOLKE” (invalid).
- W O _ _ E → “WONZE”.
- Z O _ _ E → “ZONDE”.

Among these, “MODEL” is invalid (ends with L, not E). “LONGE” is valid but uses G and N. “NODLE” is valid. “MONDE” is valid. “HONZE” is valid. 

Let’s pick “MODEL” – wait, it ends with L, not E.  
Let’s pick “NODLE” – ends with E, uses N, D, L (all new), and fits _ O _ _ E.

But “NODLE” is a valid word meaning a small piece of bread. However, it’s quite obscure. A more common word is “MODEL” – but it ends with L, not E. 

Another common word: “HOLME” – but M is okay, ends with E. However, “HOLME” is also obscure.

“GONPE” – invalid.

“BOOZE” – uses Z, but Z is okay, ends with E. But Z is usually a consonant, and “BOOZE” is valid. But it repeats O in position 1, which is allowed (but we already have O in position 2). However, “BOOZE” has O in position 1 and 2, which is allowed by the rules.

But let’s check “BOOZE”:
- B (new), O (position 1), O (position 2), Z (new), E (position 5).
But we know O must be in position 2, so “BOOZE” has O in position 1 and 2 – this is allowed, but it’s a bit redundant.

A better choice is “MODEL” – but it ends with L, not E. 

Wait, let’s re-examine valid _ O _ _ E words:
- “MODEL” – invalid, ends with L.
- “LONGE” – valid, ends with E. Uses L, N, G. All new letters.
- “NODLE” – valid, ends with E. Uses N, D, L.
- “MONDE” – valid, ends with E. Uses M, N, D.

“LONGE” is a valid word (a mineral deposit). “NODLE” is a valid word (a small bread piece). “MONDE” is a valid word (a French coin).

Among these, “NODLE” is the most common.

So the next guess is “NODLE”.

- W O D _ E → “WODGE” (G is new), “WODIE” (I is forbidden).
- Z O D _ E → “ZODIE” (I is forbidden).

The only valid word with new letters is “BODGE” or “PODGE” or “TODGE” or “WODGE”. Among these, “BODGE” is a valid word (British slang for “bodge” or “tweak”). It uses B, O, D, G, E – all allowed letters.

Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""RAISE,"" or ""AROSE."" \n\nLooking at these options:\n- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E\n- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E\n- RAISE: R, A, I, S, E\n- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E\n\n""AROSE"" is particularly good because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should help us quickly identify which vowels are in the word and whether R or S are present. \n\nAnother strong candidate is ""RAISE"" for similar reasons. However, ""AROSE"" covers O, which is slightly more common in certain positions, making it a solid first guess.\n\nAfter considering these, I\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides a good balance of vowels and common consonants to maximize information gain.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A(x) – A is not in the word.\n- R(x) – R is not in the word.\n- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.\n- S(x) – S is not in the word.\n- E(✓) – E is in the word and in position 5.\n\nSo we know:\n1.

From the four rounds we now know:

1. E is fixed in position 5 (✓ every time).
2. O is in position 2 (✓ every time).
3. D is in position 3 (✓ in Guess 3 and 4).
4. G is in position 4 (✓ in Guess 4).
5. Forbidden letters so far: A, R, S, V, I, C, N, L, B (they all got × or –).
6. We still need a letter in position 1.
   Allowed letters (so far) are everything else except those nine.

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ O D G E.

The only common English word that fits this pattern is “FOUGE” – but that’s not valid.  
Actually, the only valid word is “MODEL” – but M is allowed, and L was already ruled out (– in Guess 3).  
Wait, let’s re-examine: the pattern is _ O D G E. The only valid word is “MODEL” – but L is forbidden.  
Another word: “HODGE” – but H is allowed, and we haven’t tried it yet.  
But “HODGE” has H in position 1, O in 2, D in 3, G in 4, E in 5. All letters are allowed (H not forbidden).  
However, we already have D and G in the correct positions, and E is fixed. The only missing letter is position 1.  
The only valid word fitting _ O D G E is “HODGE”.  

But let’s double-check: are there any other words?  
“JODGE” – not valid.  
“KODGE” – not valid.  
“MODGE” – not valid.  
“PODGE” – already tried (Guess 3 was NODLE, BODGE was Guess 4; PODGE wasn’t used).  
Wait, “PODGE” is valid and fits _ O D G E. P is not forbidden.  

So the word must be “PODGE” or “HODGE”. Between these, “PODGE” is more common.  

But let’s confirm:  
- P is allowed (not in forbidden list).  
- O, D, G, E are already confirmed in positions 2-5.  

Thus, the only remaining candidate is “PODGE”.  

However, we already tried BODGE (Guess 4) and got B(x), so PODGE hasn’t been tried yet.  

Therefore, the next guess is “PODGE”.  

But wait – in Guess 4 we used BODGE and got B(x), so the word can’t be BODGE. The only other valid word fitting _ O D G E is “HODGE”.  

Let me verify “HODGE” is valid: yes, it’s a valid English word (a piece of wood or a blow).  

Thus, the next guess is “HODGE”.  

But let’s check if there are any other possibilities. The forbidden list is extensive, and the pattern is very restrictive.  

Another word: “WODGE” – not valid.  
“YODGE” – not valid.  
“ZODGE” – not valid.  

Therefore, the only remaining valid word is “HODGE”.  

So the next guess is “HODGE”.  

But wait – we have D in position 3, G in 4, so the word must be _ O D G E. The only valid word is “HODGE”.  

Hence, the final candidate is “HODGE”.  

However, I just realized – in Guess 3 we had NODLE and got L(-), meaning L is in the word but not in position 4. But we already have D in 3 and G in 4, so L cannot be in 5 (it’s E). Thus, L must be in 1 or 2. But O is fixed in 2, so L must be in 1. But we have _ O D G E, so L can’t be in 1 because position 1 is the only unknown. This suggests a contradiction, meaning our earlier assumption is wrong.  

Wait, let’s re-examine: the feedback from Guess 3 (NODLE) was N(x) O(✓) D(✓) L(-) E(✓). This means:
- O is in position 2 (✓).
- D is in position 3 (✓).
- L is in the word but not in position 4 (–).
- E is in position 5 (✓).
- N is not in the word (x).

Thus, the word has the form _ O D _ E, with L somewhere in the word, but not in position 4. Since positions 2,3,5 are occupied by O, D, E respectively, L must be in position 1. Therefore, the word must be L O D _ E.  

But we also have from Guess 4 (BODGE) that B(x) O(✓) D(✓) G(✓) E(✓). This means:
- G is in position 4 (✓).

Thus, the word must be L O D G E.  

“LODGE” is a valid English word (a place of shelter or a verb meaning to deposit).  

Let’s verify all constraints:
- L is allowed in position 1 (not forbidden).
- O is in 2 (✓).
- D is in 3 (✓).
- G is in 4 (✓).
- E is in 5 (✓).

Forbidden letters: A, R, S, V, I, C, N, B – none of these appear in LODGE.  

Therefore, the correct word is “LODGE”.  

Thus, the next guess is “LODGE”.  

This resolves the earlier confusion: the word must be LODGE.
