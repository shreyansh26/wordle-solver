2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting letters include S, T, R, N, L, and vowels like A, E, I, O, U. A good starting word should have a mix of these letters to quickly narrow down possibilities.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S: Very common starting letter
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Most common vowel in English

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to start eliminating or confirming letters efficiently.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- L(x) – L is not in the word.
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: S, L, E.
- Letters definitely present somewhere: A, T.
- A is not in position 3.
- T is not in position 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain S, L, E.
- Contains both A and T.
- A is not in the 3rd position.
- T is not in the 4th position.

Let’s pick a word that uses these constraints. A good candidate is “MATHS”, but it contains S (invalid). Next, “CARTS” has S and L (invalid). “PARTY” has no A or T (invalid). “VATTA” has two A’s and T but might be obscure. “TAMER” has E (invalid). “TAPIR” has no A. “TABBY” has no T. “TABUN” has no A. “TACET” has E (invalid). “TALAR” has L (invalid). “TAMAL” has L (invalid). “TAPIR” has no A. “TAROK” has no A. “TAROT” has no A. “TARPS” has S (invalid). “TARTS” has S (invalid). “TATOU” has no A. “TAWNY” has no A. “TAUPE” has E (invalid). “TAUON” has no A. “TAXAL” has L (invalid). “TAUT” is 4 letters. “TAXES” has S and E (invalid). 

Let’s try “TAMBA” – contains A and T, no S, L, E. A is in position 4 (not 3), T in position 1 (not 4). This seems valid. Another option is “TABUN” but it lacks A. “TAPIR” lacks A. “TAROK” lacks A. “TAROT” lacks A. “TAXAL” has L. 

A better choice is “TAMBA” – but let’s pick a more common word. “TAMER” has E. “TANGO” has no A. “TAPAS” has S. “TAPED” has E. “TAPER” has E. “TAPET” has E. “TAROK” lacks A. “TAROT” lacks A. “TART” is 4 letters. “TATOU” lacks A. “TAXAL” has L. 

Let’s try “TAMBA” – it’s valid, but perhaps “TAPIR” is too obscure. Another candidate is “TAROK” but it lacks A. 

Wait – we need A in the word. Let’s try “TAMBA” – it has A in position 4 and T in position 1. This satisfies all constraints. 

Another candidate is “TABUN” – but it lacks A. “TAPIR” lacks A. “TAROK” lacks A. “TAXAL” has L.

Let’s digest the new feedback on TAMBA:

T(✓)  – T is in position 1 and is correct.

M(x)  – M is not in the word.  
B(-)  – B is in the word but not in position 4.  
A(✓)  – A is in position 5 and is correct.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: T _ _ _ A
- Letters definitely present: T (position 1), A (position 5), B (somewhere), and we still need two more letters.
- Letters definitely absent: S, L, E, M.
- B cannot be in position 4.
- A cannot be in position 2 (already satisfied since A is only in 5).

We need a 5-letter word that starts with T and ends with A, contains B, and does not contain S, L, E, M.

Possible positions for B: 2, 3 (since 4 is disallowed and 1 & 5 are taken by T & A).

Let’s brainstorm words fitting T _ _ _ A with B in 2 or 3:
- T B _ _ A → TB…A – unlikely common words.
- T _ B _ A → T _ B _ A – more promising.

Examples:
- TUBIA – contains U, B, I; no S,L,E,M. B is in position 3 (valid). This fits.
- TUBIA is a valid word (though rare, it’s acceptable).

Another candidate:
- TIBIA – starts with T, has B in position 2, ends with A. Contains I, B, A. No S,L,E,M. B is in position 2 (valid).

Between TUBIA and TIBIA, TIBIA is more common.

Let’s verify constraints for TIBIA:
- T(✓) in position 1 – matches.
- I – new letter, not yet ruled out.
- B(-) – in position 3, not position 4 (valid).
- I – new letter.
- A(✓) in position 5 – matches.

No forbidden letters (S,L,E,M) appear.
