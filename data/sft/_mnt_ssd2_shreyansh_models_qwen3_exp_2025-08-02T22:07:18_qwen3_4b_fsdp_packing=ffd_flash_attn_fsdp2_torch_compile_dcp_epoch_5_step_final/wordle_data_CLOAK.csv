### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently appearing letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).

The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a good first guess because it contains:
- S: Very common starting letter
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Most common vowel in English

This combination should give me good coverage to identify which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the correct position (3rd letter) (✓)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So far we know:
- 3rd letter is L
- A is somewhere else (not position 3)
- No S, T, or E

I want a new word that:
1. Keeps L in position 3
2. Uses A in a different position
3. Avoids S, T, E
4. Introduces other common letters to maximize information

Good consonants to try next: R, N, C, D, P, M, etc.
Good vowels to try next: I, O, U (since A is already known)

Let me try a word like CLAMP:
- C, L, A, M, P
- L stays in position 3
- A moves to position 3 → but wait, position 3 is already L. So A can't go there. Let me rethink.

Better word: FLANK
- F, L, A, N, K
- L in position 3 ✓
- A in position 3 → conflict with L. Not good.

Better word: PLAIN
- P, L, A, I, N
- L in position 3 ✓
- A in position 2 (new position)
- Uses I and N, avoids S, T, E

This seems solid.

So far we have:

- Position 3 is definitely L.
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3.
- Letters already ruled out: S, T, E, P, I, N.

Remaining vowels: O, U, Y (though Y is sometimes a vowel).  
Common consonants not yet tried: R, C, D, G, H, K, M, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with:
1. L in position 3.
2. A placed in position 1, 4 or 5 (since 2 and 3 are excluded).
3. No S, T, E, P, I, N.

Let’s try to place A in position 4 and build a word around it.  
A good candidate is “CLOUD”:
- C, L, O, U, D  
- L is in position 3 ✓  
- A is not used, but we can check if A must appear elsewhere.  
However, we know A must appear somewhere, so we should include it.

Instead, let’s try “GLOAM” (though “gloam” is less common).  
Better: “CLOAK”:
- C, L, O, A, K  
- L in position 3 ✓  
- A in position 4 ✓  
- Uses new letters C, O, K.

But “CLOAK” is a valid word and fits all constraints.

Another option: “BLOAT” – but T is ruled out.  
“FLOAT” – T ruled out.  
“GLOAT” – T ruled out.  
“CLOAK” seems best.
