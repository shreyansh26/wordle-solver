For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should cover several vowels and common consonants. 

""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
This combination should help eliminate many possibilities quickly based on the feedback.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is not in position 1).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, but not in position 1.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A somewhere (positions 2-5).
- Does not use R, O, S, E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A is already confirmed).

A strong next guess would use new common letters while placing A in a different spot. ""TALON"" is a good candidate:
- T is common.
- A is in position 2 (new spot).
- L, O, N: but O is already ruled out, so ""TALON"" is invalid (contains O).

Next candidate: ""TAINS"" – but S is ruled out.
Next: ""PAINT"" – contains I, N, T, P; A in position 2; no ruled-out letters.

""PAINT"" seems good:
- Uses P, I, N, T (all new or less tested).
- Places A in position 2 (new spot).
- No R, O, S, E.

But ""PAINT"" has T at the end; let's check another: ""PLANT"" – P, L, A, N, T. Also good.

Between ""PAINT"" and ""PLANT"", both are strong. ""PLANT"" uses L and N, which are very common. I'll go with ""PLANT"".

- Does not use any of the ruled-out letters.

A good next guess should use fresh common letters.  
Let’s try “CHAIR”:
- C, H, I, R: but R is ruled out → reject.  
Try “GUILD” – uses U, I, L, D; L is ruled out → reject.  
Try “MADAM” – uses M, D, M; but A is in positions 2 and 5, which are allowed, and M, D are new.  
But “MADAM” repeats the letter M, which is unnecessary for information gain.

Better choice: “MUSIC” – uses M, U, S, I, C.  
But S is ruled out → reject.

Try “CIVIC” – C, I, V, I, C → repeats letters and uses V (rare). Not ideal.

Try “VIRAL” – R, L ruled out → reject.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   – A is in the word but not in position 1.  
   – R, O, S, E are **not** in the word.

2. plant → P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(x)  
   – A is still in the word but not in position 3.  
   – P, L, N, T are **not** in the word.  
   – So A is in the word but not in positions 1 or 3.

Letters already ruled out: R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T.

Remaining common consonants: C, D, G, H, M, Y, K, B, F, V, W, Z, X, Q, J  
Remaining common vowels: I, U, A (A already confirmed)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains the letter A, and it must be in position 2 or 4 or 5 (since positions 1 and 3 are ruled out).  
- Does not use any of the ruled-out letters.

A good next guess should use fresh common letters.  
Let’s try “CHAIR”:
- C, H, I, R: but R is ruled out → reject.  
Try “GUILD” – uses U, I, L, D; L is ruled out → reject.  
Try “MADAM” – uses M, D, M; but A is in positions 2 and 5, which are allowed, and M, D are new.  
But “MADAM” repeats the letter M, which is unnecessary for information gain.

Better choice: “MUSIC” – uses M, U, S, I, C.  
But S is ruled out → reject.

Try “CIVIC” – C, I, V, I, C → repeats letters and uses V (rare). Not ideal.

Try “VIRAL” – R, L ruled out → reject.

Try “WIDAR” – R ruled out → reject.

Try “GUMMY” – no A → reject.

Try “MIAOU” – uses M, I, O, U; O ruled out → reject.

Try “VIVID” – no A → reject.

Try “BAYOU” – O ruled out → reject.

Try “CABIN” – N ruled out → reject.

Try “DAMAS” – S ruled out → reject.

Try “GAMUT” – T ruled out → reject.

Try “HABIT” – T ruled out → reject.

Try “MAGIC” – C, G, I, M; A in position 2.  
Letters used: M, A, G, I, C.  
None of these letters have been ruled out.  
Positions: A is in position 2 (allowed).  
This seems like a strong candidate.

Another candidate: “CABAL” – L ruled out → reject.  
“DAMAS” – S ruled out → reject.  
“FACED” – E ruled out → reject.  
“GAMAS” – S ruled out → reject.  
“HABIT” – T ruled out → reject.  
“JAMMY” – no new info, repeats M.

“MAGIC” uses five new letters (for information gain) and places A in position 2, which is allowed.

Therefore, the next guess is “MAGIC”.

Current confirmed facts:

- A is in the word and is in position 2 (✓).
- C is in the word but not in position 5 (-).
- Letters ruled out so far: R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T, M, G, I.

So the word has the pattern:
_ A _ _ _

And must contain C somewhere (but not in position 5).

Remaining unused common consonants: B, D, F, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining unused vowels: U (since A is already used, and E, O, I ruled out)

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A fixed in position 2.
- C somewhere (positions 1, 3, or 4).
- No reused ruled-out letters.

Possible patterns:
- C A _ _ _
- _ A C _ _
- _ A _ C _

Let’s try to pick a word that fits one of these patterns using new letters.

Looking at pattern _ A C _ _ (C in position 3):
We need letters for positions 1, 4, 5 from the remaining pool (B, D, F, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, U).

A common word with this pattern is “BACON”, but O is ruled out.  
“DACRY” – Y is possible, but rare.  
“HACKE” – E ruled out.  
“BACCH” – H repeated, not ideal.

Pattern _ A _ C _ (C in position 4):
Example: “UACID” – not a word.  
“BANDC” – not a word.  
“DANCE” – E ruled out.  
“HANKC” – not a word.

Pattern C A _ _ _ (C in position 1):
Example: “CABIN” – I, N ruled out.  
“CAMEO” – O, E ruled out.  
“CANDY” – N, D, Y possible, but N is ruled out.  
“CABOO” – O ruled out.

Pattern _ A _ C _ (C in position 4) with new letters:
Let’s try “BAYOU” – O ruled out.  
“VACCA” – C repeated, O ruled out.  
“DAMAS” – S ruled out.  
“BACON” – O ruled out.  
“HACKY” – K, X, Y possible. “HACKY” is a valid word.

Check letters:
H – new  
A – fixed position 2  
C – in word, not in position 5 (here C is in 3, which is allowed)  
K – new  
Y – new  

So “HACKY” fits all constraints.

Another candidate: “BAYLE” – E ruled out.  
“DALLY” – L ruled out.  
“VIVID” – no A.  

Thus, the best next guess is “HACKY”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should cover several vowels and common consonants. 

""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
This combination should help eliminate many possibilities quickly based on the feedback.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is not in position 1).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, but not in position 1.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A somewhere (positions 2-5).
- Does not use R, O, S, E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A is already confirmed).

A strong next guess would use new common letters while placing A in a different spot. ""TALON"" is a good candidate:
- T is common.
- A is in position 2 (new spot).
- L, O, N: but O is already ruled out, so ""TALON"" is invalid (contains O).

Next candidate: ""TAINS"" – but S is ruled out.
Next: ""PAINT"" – contains I, N, T, P; A in position 2; no ruled-out letters.

""PAINT"" seems good:
- Uses P, I, N, T (all new or less tested).
- Places A in position 2 (new spot).
- No R, O, S, E.

But ""PAINT"" has T at the end; let's check another: ""PLANT"" – P, L, A, N, T. Also good.

Between ""PAINT"" and ""PLANT"", both are strong. ""PLANT"" uses L and N, which are very common. I'll go with ""PLANT"".

Try “MADAM” – uses M, D, M; but A is in positions 2 and 5, which are allowed, and M, D are new.  
But “MADAM” repeats the letter M, which is unnecessary for information gain.

Current confirmed facts:

1. Word pattern: _ A _ _ Y  (A in position 2, Y in position 5)
2. C is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from feedback C(-) on H A C K Y)
   Therefore C must be in position 1 or 4.
3. Letters ruled out so far: R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T, M, G, I, H, K
4. Remaining available letters (common ones): B, D, F, J, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2
- Y in position 5
- C in position 1 or 4

Possible patterns:
- C A _ C Y  (C in positions 1 and 4) – unlikely since C can't repeat unless word allows
- C A _ _ Y with C in position 4: _ A _ C Y
- _ A C _ Y with C in position 3 is invalid (C must be in 1 or 4)
