For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. The word ""AROSE"" is excellent for this because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This will help me quickly narrow down possible letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.  
- R(x) → R is not in the word.  
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in the 3rd position.  
- S(x) → S is not in the word.  
- E(x) → E is not in the word.  

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter O, but O cannot be in position 3.  
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E.  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O somewhere except position 3.  
- Avoids A, R, S, E.  

Good consonants left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
Good vowels left to try: I, U (since A, E are out and O is already known to be present).  

A strong next guess should use new common letters and place O in a different position.  
The word “POINT” uses P, I, N, T and places O in position 2.  
- P, I, N, T are all new letters.  
- O is in position 2, which is different from the forbidden position 3.  

Therefore, “POINT” is a good choice.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. The word ""AROSE"" is excellent for this because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This will help me quickly narrow down possible letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.  
- R(x) → R is not in the word.  
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in the 3rd position.  
- S(x) → S is not in the word.  
- E(x) → E is not in the word.  

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter O, but O cannot be in position 3.  
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E.  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O somewhere except position 3.  
- Avoids A, R, S, E.  

Good consonants left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
Good vowels left to try: I, U (since A, E are out and O is already known to be present).  

A strong next guess should use new common letters and place O in a different position.  
The word “POINT” uses P, I, N, T and places O in position 2.  
- P, I, N, T are all new letters.  
- O is in position 2, which is different from the forbidden position 3.  

Therefore, “POINT” is a good choice.

We need two more letters (positions 3, 4, 5) from the available set.  
A good strategy is to pick a word that introduces new common letters and fits the pattern P O _ _ _.  
The word “POUCH” comes to mind:
- P and O are already confirmed in positions 1 and 2.
- U, C, H are all new letters that haven’t been ruled out.
- It’s a valid 5-letter word.

We now know:
- Pattern: P O _ _ Y
- Eliminated letters: A, R, S, E, I, N, T, U, C, H, M
- Still available letters (common ones): B, D, F, G, K, L, V, W, Z

We need one more letter for position 3 or 4 (whichever is empty).  
Looking at common 5-letter words starting with PO and ending in Y:

Possible words:
- POUND – N is out.
- POWER – E, R are out.
- POUCH – already tried.
- POGUE – E, U, G?  E and U are out.
- POKER – E, R are out.
- POLLY – L is allowed, but we need to check if it fits P O _ _ Y.  POLLY ends in Y, but we have P O _ _ Y, so POLLY would be P O L L Y, which fits!  However, we have already tried POUCH, pommy, and pouch, and POLLY hasn't been tried yet.

Wait, let's verify:
- POLLY: P(✓) O(✓) L(?) L(?) Y(✓)
We haven't tried L yet, and it's still available.

But we need to check if L is eliminated.  From previous guesses, eliminated letters are: A, R, S, E, I, N, T, U, C, H, M.  L is not in this list, so it's still available.

So POLLY is a valid candidate.

Another candidate could be POGGY, but G is allowed and Y is already confirmed in position 5, but POGGY would be P O G G Y, but we have P O _ _ Y, so P O G G Y would fit, but we need to check if G is available.  G hasn't been eliminated yet.

But POLLY seems more straightforward as it uses L, which hasn't been tried.

Wait, let's think differently: the pattern is P O _ _ Y, so we need two letters in positions 3 and 4.  The simplest is to have P O _ _ Y where the blanks are new letters.

Looking at common words:
- P O L L Y – POLLY
- P O G G Y – POGGY
- P O W D Y – doesn't exist
- P O K K Y – doesn't exist
- P O B B Y – doesn't exist
- P O D D Y – doesn't exist

POLLY seems the most common.

But let's check if POLLY has any letters eliminated:
Letters in POLLY: P, O, L, L, Y
- P, O, Y are confirmed.
- L hasn't been eliminated (eliminated letters don't include L).
- Second L is same as first, so no issue.

Thus, POLLY is a valid next guess.

However, we have to be careful: in previous feedback, when we tried POUCH (P O U C H), H was eliminated, but that's for position 5.  Here, we're trying P O _ _ Y, so Y is in position 5, which matches the feedback.

But wait, in pommy (P O M M Y), Y was marked ✓ in position 5, so Y is confirmed in position 5.  Thus, the pattern is P O _ _ Y.

Looking at common words ending in Y with PO:
- POLLY – P O L L Y
- POGGY – P O G G Y
- POKKY – doesn't exist
- POBBY – doesn't exist
- PODDY – doesn't exist
- POOFY – F is allowed, but POOFY isn't common
- POOZY – Z is allowed, but POOZY isn't common

POLLY seems the best.

But let's think if there's a word with P O _ _ Y where the middle letters are new.  Another candidate is P O G G Y, but G is allowed.

But POLLY uses L, which hasn't been tried, and is common.

Thus, I'll go with POLLY.

But wait, in previous guesses, we have:
- arose: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x) → O is in word but not in position 3
- point: P(✓) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x) → P and O confirmed in positions 1 and 2
- pouch: P(✓) O(✓) U(x) C(x) H(x) → P, O confirmed in 1,2
- pommy: P(✓) O(✓) M(x) M(x) Y(✓) → P, O confirmed in 1,2, Y in 5

Thus, the pattern is P O _ _ Y, and we need two letters in positions 3 and 4, neither of which can be any eliminated letters.

Eliminated letters so far: A, R, S, E, I, N, T, U, C, H, M

Still available: B, D, F, G, K, L, V, W, Z

Looking for common words:
- P O L L Y – POLLY (valid)
- P O G G Y – POGGY (valid)
- P O W D Y – doesn't exist
- P O K K Y – doesn't exist
- P O B B Y – doesn't exist
- P O D D Y – doesn't exist

Between POLLY and POGGY, POLLY is more common.

But let's check if L is available: yes, L is not in eliminated list.

Thus, POLLY is the best next guess.

However, I just realized that in pommy, the second M was also marked x, meaning M is not in the word at all.  Thus, M is eliminated.  But L is still available.

Thus, POLLY is valid.

But let's verify:
- P O L L Y: P, O, L, L, Y
- P: confirmed in position 1
- O: confirmed in position 2
- L: not eliminated
- Second L: same as above
- Y: confirmed in position 5

Thus, POLLY is acceptable.

But wait, another thought: in pommy, the feedback was:
P(✓) O(✓) M(x) M(x) Y(✓)
This means:
- P is correct in position 1
- O is correct in position 2
- M is not in the word (first M)
- M is not in the word (second M)
- Y is correct in position 5

Thus, the word has the form P O _ _ Y, and letters not in the word include M, A, R, S, E, I, N, T, U, C, H

Thus, letters still available: B, D, F, G, K, L, V, W, Z

Looking for common words:
- P O L L Y – POLLY (valid)
- P O G G Y – POGGY (valid)
- P O K K Y – doesn't exist
- P O W D Y – doesn't exist
- P O B B Y – doesn't exist
- P O D D Y – doesn't exist

POLLY is the most common.

Thus, I will go with POLLY.

But wait, let me check if POLLY is indeed a valid word: yes, it's a variant of ""polite"" and means proud or boastful.

Thus, POLLY is the next guess.

- Eliminated letters: A, R, S, E, I, N, T, U, C, H, M
- Still available letters (common ones): B, D, F, G, K, L, V, W, Z

We need one more letter for position 3 or 4 (whichever is empty).  
Looking at common 5-letter words starting with PO and ending in Y:

Possible words:
- POUND – N is out.
- POWER – E, R are out.
- POUCH – already tried.
- POGUE – E, U, G?  E and U are out.
- POKER – E, R are out.

But we need to check if L is eliminated.  From previous guesses, eliminated letters are: A, R, S, E, I, N, T, U, C, H, M.  L is not in this list, so it's still available.

So POLLY is a valid candidate.

Another candidate could be POGGY, but G is allowed and Y is already confirmed in position 5, but POGGY would be P O G G Y, but we have P O _ _ Y, so P O G G Y would fit, but we need to check if G is available.  G hasn't been eliminated yet.

But POLLY seems more straightforward as it uses L, which hasn't been tried.

Wait, let's think differently: the pattern is P O _ _ Y, so we need two letters in positions 3 and 4.  The simplest is to have P O _ _ Y where the blanks are new letters.

Looking at common words:
- P O L L Y – POLLY
- P O G G Y – POGGY
- P O W D Y – doesn't exist
- P O K K Y – doesn't exist
- P O B B Y – doesn't exist
- P O D D Y – doesn't exist

POLLY seems the most common.

But let's check if POLLY has any letters eliminated:
Letters in POLLY: P, O, L, L, Y
- P, O, Y are confirmed.
- L hasn't been eliminated (eliminated letters don't include L).
- Second L is same as first, so no issue.

Thus, POLLY is a valid next guess.

However, we have to be careful: in previous feedback, when we tried POUCH (P O U C H), H was eliminated, but that's for position 5.  Here, we're trying P O _ _ Y, so Y is in position 5, which matches the feedback.

But wait, in pommy (P O M M Y), Y was marked ✓ in position 5, so Y is confirmed in position 5.  Thus, the pattern is P O _ _ Y.

Looking at common words ending in Y with PO:
- POLLY – P O L L Y
- POGGY – P O G G Y
- POKKY – doesn't exist
- POBBY – doesn't exist
- PODDY – doesn't exist
- POOFY – F is allowed, but POOFY isn't common
- POOZY – Z is allowed, but POOZY isn't common

POLLY seems the best.

But let's think if there's a word with P O _ _ Y where the middle letters are new.  Another candidate is P O G G Y, but G is allowed.

But POLLY uses L, which hasn't been tried, and is common.

Thus, I'll go with POLLY.

But wait, in previous guesses, we have:
- arose: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x) → O is in word but not in position 3
- point: P(✓) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x) → P and O confirmed in positions 1 and 2
- pouch: P(✓) O(✓) U(x) C(x) H(x) → P, O confirmed in 1,2
- pommy: P(✓) O(✓) M(x) M(x) Y(✓) → P, O confirmed in 1,2, Y in 5

Thus, the pattern is P O _ _ Y, and we need two letters in positions 3 and 4, neither of which can be any eliminated letters.

Eliminated letters so far: A, R, S, E, I, N, T, U, C, H, M

Still available: B, D, F, G, K, L, V, W, Z

Looking for common words:
- P O L L Y – POLLY (valid)
- P O G G Y – POGGY (valid)
- P O W D Y – doesn't exist
- P O K K Y – doesn't exist
- P O B B Y – doesn't exist
- P O D D Y – doesn't exist

Between POLLY and POGGY, POLLY is more common.

But let's check if L is available: yes, L is not in eliminated list.

Thus, POLLY is the best next guess.

However, I just realized that in pommy, the second M was also marked x, meaning M is not in the word at all.  Thus, M is eliminated.  But L is still available.

Thus, POLLY is valid.

But let's verify:
- P O L L Y: P, O, L, L, Y
- P: confirmed in position 1
- O: confirmed in position 2
- L: not eliminated
- Second L: same as above
- Y: confirmed in position 5

Thus, POLLY is acceptable.

But wait, another thought: in pommy, the feedback was:
P(✓) O(✓) M(x) M(x) Y(✓)
This means:
- P is correct in position 1
- O is correct in position 2
- M is not in the word (first M)
- M is not in the word (second M)
- Y is correct in position 5

Thus, the word has the form P O _ _ Y, and letters not in the word include M, A, R, S, E, I, N, T, U, C, H

Thus, letters still available: B, D, F, G, K, L, V, W, Z

Looking for common words:
- P O L L Y – POLLY (valid)
- P O G G Y – POGGY (valid)
- P O K K Y – doesn't exist
- P O W D Y – doesn't exist
- P O B B Y – doesn't exist
- P O D D Y – doesn't exist

POLLY is the most common.

Thus, I will go with POLLY.

But wait, let me check if POLLY is indeed a valid word: yes, it's a variant of ""polite"" and means proud or boastful.

Thus, POLLY is the next guess.",Guess 5: polly -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(✓) L(x) L(x) Y(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. The word ""AROSE"" is excellent for this because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This will help me quickly narrow down possible letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.  
- R(x) → R is not in the word.  
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in the 3rd position.  
- S(x) → S is not in the word.  
- E(x) → E is not in the word.  

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter O, but O cannot be in position 3.  
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E.  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O somewhere except position 3.  
- Avoids A, R, S, E.  

Good consonants left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
Good vowels left to try: I, U (since A, E are out and O is already known to be present).  

A strong next guess should use new common letters and place O in a different position.  
The word “POINT” uses P, I, N, T and places O in position 2.  
- P, I, N, T are all new letters.  
- O is in position 2, which is different from the forbidden position 3.  

Therefore, “POINT” is a good choice.

Guess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
So far we know:
- The word starts with P and has O in position 2: P O _ _ _
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, I, N, T
- Still-available letters (among common ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y, Z

We need two more letters (positions 3, 4, 5) from the available set.  
A good strategy is to pick a word that introduces new common letters and fits the pattern P O _ _ _.  
The word “POUCH” comes to mind:
- P and O are already confirmed in positions 1 and 2.
- U, C, H are all new letters that haven’t been ruled out.
- It’s a valid 5-letter word.

Let’s try POUCH.

So far we have:

- Eliminated letters: A, R, S, E, I, N, T, U, C, H

Still available letters (common ones): B, D, F, G, K, L, M, V, W, Y, Z

We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5.  
Let’s look for common 5-letter words starting with “PO” that use only the still-allowed letters.

Possible endings:
- POUND – but N is out.
- POWER – E and R are out.
- POUCH – already tried.
- POGUE – E and U are out.
- POKER – E and R are out.
- POMMY – M is allowed, Y is allowed.  (POMMY is a valid word meaning “proud” or “boastful”)
- POGGS – S is out.
- POLLY – L is allowed, Y is allowed.  (POLLY is valid)

Let’s pick POMMY because it uses M and Y, both still allowed, and it’s a common word.

Guess 4: pommy -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(✓) M(x) M(x) Y(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
We now know:
- Pattern: P O _ _ Y
- Eliminated letters: A, R, S, E, I, N, T, U, C, H, M
- Still available letters (common ones): B, D, F, G, K, L, V, W, Z

We need one more letter for position 3 or 4 (whichever is empty).  
Looking at common 5-letter words starting with PO and ending in Y:

Possible words:
- POUND – N is out.
- POWER – E, R are out.
- POUCH – already tried.
- POGUE – E, U, G?  E and U are out.
- POKER – E, R are out.
- POLLY – L is allowed, but we need to check if it fits P O _ _ Y.  POLLY ends in Y, but we have P O _ _ Y, so POLLY would be P O L L Y, which fits!  However, we have already tried POUCH, pommy, and pouch, and POLLY hasn't been tried yet.

Wait, let's verify:
- POLLY: P(✓) O(✓) L(?) L(?) Y(✓)
We haven't tried L yet, and it's still available.

But we need to check if L is eliminated.  From previous guesses, eliminated letters are: A, R, S, E, I, N, T, U, C, H, M.  L is not in this list, so it's still available.

So POLLY is a valid candidate.

Another candidate could be POGGY, but G is allowed and Y is already confirmed in position 5, but POGGY would be P O G G Y, but we have P O _ _ Y, so P O G G Y would fit, but we need to check if G is available.  G hasn't been eliminated yet.

But POLLY seems more straightforward as it uses L, which hasn't been tried.

Wait, let's think differently: the pattern is P O _ _ Y, so we need two letters in positions 3 and 4.  The simplest is to have P O _ _ Y where the blanks are new letters.

Looking at common words:
- P O L L Y – POLLY
- P O G G Y – POGGY
- P O W D Y – doesn't exist
- P O K K Y – doesn't exist
- P O B B Y – doesn't exist
- P O D D Y – doesn't exist

POLLY seems the most common.

But let's check if POLLY has any letters eliminated:
Letters in POLLY: P, O, L, L, Y
- P, O, Y are confirmed.
- L hasn't been eliminated (eliminated letters don't include L).
- Second L is same as first, so no issue.

Thus, POLLY is a valid next guess.

However, we have to be careful: in previous feedback, when we tried POUCH (P O U C H), H was eliminated, but that's for position 5.  Here, we're trying P O _ _ Y, so Y is in position 5, which matches the feedback.

But wait, in pommy (P O M M Y), Y was marked ✓ in position 5, so Y is confirmed in position 5.  Thus, the pattern is P O _ _ Y.

Looking at common words ending in Y with PO:
- POLLY – P O L L Y
- POGGY – P O G G Y
- POKKY – doesn't exist
- POBBY – doesn't exist
- PODDY – doesn't exist
- POOFY – F is allowed, but POOFY isn't common
- POOZY – Z is allowed, but POOZY isn't common

POLLY seems the best.

But let's think if there's a word with P O _ _ Y where the middle letters are new.  Another candidate is P O G G Y, but G is allowed.

But POLLY uses L, which hasn't been tried, and is common.

Thus, I'll go with POLLY.

But wait, in previous guesses, we have:
- arose: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x) → O is in word but not in position 3
- point: P(✓) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x) → P and O confirmed in positions 1 and 2
- pouch: P(✓) O(✓) U(x) C(x) H(x) → P, O confirmed in 1,2
- pommy: P(✓) O(✓) M(x) M(x) Y(✓) → P, O confirmed in 1,2, Y in 5

Thus, the pattern is P O _ _ Y, and we need two letters in positions 3 and 4, neither of which can be any eliminated letters.

Eliminated letters so far: A, R, S, E, I, N, T, U, C, H, M

Still available: B, D, F, G, K, L, V, W, Z

Looking for common words:
- P O L L Y – POLLY (valid)
- P O G G Y – POGGY (valid)
- P O W D Y – doesn't exist
- P O K K Y – doesn't exist
- P O B B Y – doesn't exist
- P O D D Y – doesn't exist

Between POLLY and POGGY, POLLY is more common.

But let's check if L is available: yes, L is not in eliminated list.

Thus, POLLY is the best next guess.

However, I just realized that in pommy, the second M was also marked x, meaning M is not in the word at all.  Thus, M is eliminated.  But L is still available.

Thus, POLLY is valid.

But let's verify:
- P O L L Y: P, O, L, L, Y
- P: confirmed in position 1
- O: confirmed in position 2
- L: not eliminated
- Second L: same as above
- Y: confirmed in position 5

Thus, POLLY is acceptable.

But wait, another thought: in pommy, the feedback was:
P(✓) O(✓) M(x) M(x) Y(✓)
This means:
- P is correct in position 1
- O is correct in position 2
- M is not in the word (first M)
- M is not in the word (second M)
- Y is correct in position 5

Thus, the word has the form P O _ _ Y, and letters not in the word include M, A, R, S, E, I, N, T, U, C, H

Thus, letters still available: B, D, F, G, K, L, V, W, Z

Looking for common words:
- P O L L Y – POLLY (valid)
- P O G G Y – POGGY (valid)
- P O K K Y – doesn't exist
- P O W D Y – doesn't exist
- P O B B Y – doesn't exist
- P O D D Y – doesn't exist

POLLY is the most common.

Thus, I will go with POLLY.

But wait, let me check if POLLY is indeed a valid word: yes, it's a variant of ""polite"" and means proud or boastful.

Thus, POLLY is the next guess.

But L is still available.\n\nThus, POLLY is valid.\n\nBut let\'s verify:\n- P O L L Y: P, O, L, L, Y\n- P: confirmed in position 1\n- O: confirmed in position 2\n- L: not eliminated\n- Second L: same as above\n- Y: confirmed in position 5\n\nThus, POLLY is acceptable.\n\nBut wait, another thought: in pommy, the feedback was:\nP(✓) O(✓) M(x) M(x) Y(✓)\nThis means:\n- P is correct in position 1\n- O is correct in position 2\n- M is not in the word (first M)\n- M is not in the word (second M)\n- Y is correct in position 5\n\nThus, the word has the form P O _ _ Y, and letters not in the word include M, A, R, S, E, I, N, T, U, C, H\n\nThus, letters still available: B, D, F, G, K, L, V, W, Z\n\nLooking for common words:\n- P O L L Y – POLLY (valid)\n- P O G G Y – POGGY (valid)\n- P O K K Y – doesn\'t exist\n- P O W D Y – doesn\'t exist\n- P O B B Y – doesn\'t exist\n- P O D D Y – doesn\'t exist\n\nPOLLY is the most common.\n\nThus, I will go with POLLY.\n\nBut wait, let me check if POLLY is indeed a valid word: yes, it\'s a variant of ""polite"" and means proud or boastful.\n\nThus, POLLY is the next guess.\n\n<guess>polly</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: pouch -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(✓) U(x) C(x) H(x)\nGuess 4: pommy -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(✓) M(x) M(x) Y(✓)\nGuess 5: polly -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(✓) L(x) L(x) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We now know the pattern is P O _ _ Y and the letters NOT in the word are:

A, R, S, E, I, N, T, U, C, H, M, L

Still available letters (common ones): B, D, F, G, K, V, W, Z

We need two letters for positions 3 and 4, neither of which can be any of the eliminated letters.

Looking at common 5-letter words starting with PO and ending in Y:

- P O B B Y – doesn’t exist
- P O D D Y – doesn’t exist
- P O G G Y – POGGY (G is still available)
- P O K K Y – doesn’t exist
- P O V V Y – doesn’t exist
- P O W D Y – doesn’t exist
- P O W K Y – doesn’t exist
- P O Z Z Y – doesn’t exist

The only valid word left is POGGY.

Check its letters:
- P, O, Y are already confirmed in positions 1, 2, 5.
- G has not been eliminated.
- Both G’s are new and allowed.

Thus, POGGY is the only logical next guess.
