For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters are: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should ideally contain 2-3 vowels and several common consonants.

Some popular starting words are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), which should help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it can't be in position 1).
- R is not in the word.
- O is not in the word.
- S is not in the word.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it can't be in position 5).

So the secret word:
- Must contain A and E (but not in positions 1 or 5 respectively).
- Must NOT contain R, O, S.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has A and E somewhere (but A not in position 1, E not in position 5).
- Doesn't use R, O, S.

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, G, B, M, P, etc.

Let's try ""TALKE"":
- T (new consonant)
- A (in word, not in position 1 - this is fine)
- L (new consonant)
- K (new consonant)
- E (in word, not in position 5 - this is fine)

""cleat"" is valid. It uses C, L, E, A, T - none of which are R, O, S. Positions: A is in 4 (not 1), E is in 3 (not 5). This seems like a good next guess to gather more information.

From the two guesses so far:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.
   - R, O, S are not in the word.

   - C, L, T are not in the word.
   - E is in the word but not in position 3.
   - A is in the word but not in position 4.

So the secret word:
- Must contain A and E.
- Must NOT contain R, O, S, C, L, T.
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
- E cannot be in positions 3 or 5.

Remaining letters to consider (common ones): B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with A and E, avoiding the forbidden letters and respecting the position constraints.

Let's list possible positions:
- A can be in 2, 3, or 5.
- E can be in 1, 2, or 4.

Let's try to find a word that fits these constraints. One systematic way is to pick a word with A in position 2 and E in position 4, or vice versa.

Consider ""BEACH"":
- B (new)
- E (in word, position 2 - allowed)
- A (in word, position 3 - allowed)
- C (forbidden)
- H (new)
But C is forbidden, so this is invalid.

Next, ""PEACH"":
- P (new)
- E (position 2)
- A (position 3)
- C (forbidden)
- H (new)
Again, C is forbidden.

Next, ""MEANT"":
- M (new)
- E (position 2)
- A (position 3)
- N (new)
- T (forbidden)
T is forbidden, so invalid.

Next, ""HEMAN"":
- H (new)
- E (position 2)
- M (new)
- A (position 4) - but A cannot be in position 4 (from cleat feedback)
So this is invalid.

Next, ""BEGAN"":
- B (new)
- E (position 2)
- G (new)
- A (position 4) - invalid
- N (new)

Next, ""FLEAN"":
- F (new)
- L (forbidden)
- E (position 3) - invalid
- A (position 4) - invalid
- N (new)

Next, ""WHEAL"":
- W (new)
- H (new)
- E (position 3) - invalid
- A (position 4) - invalid
- L (forbidden)

Next, ""VEXAN"":
- V (new)
- E (position 2)
- X (new)
- A (position 4) - invalid
- N (new)

This is getting tedious. Let's try a different approach: pick a word where A is in position 5 and E is in position 2.

""BEGAN"" had A in 4, which is invalid. How about ""PEAGE"":
- P (new)
- E (position 2)
- A (position 3)
- G (new)
- E (position 5) - but E cannot be in position 5 (from arose feedback)
Invalid.

Next, ""BEGUM"":
- B (new)
- E (position 2)
- G (new)
- U (new)
- M (new)
But this doesn't have A, which is required.

We must include A and E. Let's try ""BEACH"" variant without C: ""BEADG"" - invalid.

Wait, let's list valid letters: allowed are A, E, plus any not forbidden: so far forbidden are R, O, S, C, L, T.

Remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y.

Let's try ""BEGUM"" - no A.

We need A and E. Let's try ""BEAVER"" - but R is forbidden.

""BEADY"":
- B
- E
- A
- D
- Y
But this is 4 letters, and we need 5.

""BEAKY"":
- B
- E
- A
- K
- Y
This has A and E, and no forbidden letters. Let's check positions:
- A is in position 3 - allowed (from arose: A not in 1; from cleat: A not in 4)
- E is in position 2 - allowed (from arose: E not in 5; from cleat: E not in 3)
This seems valid.

""BEAKY"" is a valid word (British slang for ""beaky"", meaning narrow or sharp).

Let's go with this.
</think>

Based on the feedback so far, the secret word:
- Must contain A and E.
- Must NOT contain R, O, S, C, L, T.
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
- E cannot be in positions 3 or 5.

A valid word fitting these constraints is ""BEAKY"".

We must include A and E. Let's try ""BEACH"" variant without C: ""BEADG"" - invalid.

Wait, let's list valid letters: allowed are A, E, plus any not forbidden: so far forbidden are R, O, S, C, L, T.

Remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y.

Let's try ""BEGUM"" - no A.

We need A and E. Let's try ""BEAVER"" - but R is forbidden.

""BEADY"":
- B
- E
- A
- D
- Y
But this is 4 letters, and we need 5.

""BEAKY"":
- B
- E
- A
- K
- Y
This has A and E, and no forbidden letters. Let's check positions:
- A is in position 3 - allowed (from arose: A not in 1; from cleat: A not in 4)
- E is in position 2 - allowed (from arose: E not in 5; from cleat: E not in 3)
This seems valid.

""BEAKY"" is a valid word (British slang for ""beaky"", meaning narrow or sharp).

Let's go with this.Based on the feedback so far, the secret word:
- Must contain A and E.
- Must NOT contain R, O, S, C, L, T.
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
- E cannot be in positions 3 or 5.

A valid word fitting these constraints is ""BEAKY"".",Guess 3: beaky -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) E(✓) A(✓) K(x) Y(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters are: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should ideally contain 2-3 vowels and several common consonants.

Some popular starting words are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), which should help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it can't be in position 1).
- R is not in the word.
- O is not in the word.
- S is not in the word.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it can't be in position 5).

So the secret word:
- Must contain A and E (but not in positions 1 or 5 respectively).
- Must NOT contain R, O, S.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has A and E somewhere (but A not in position 1, E not in position 5).
- Doesn't use R, O, S.

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, G, B, M, P, etc.

Let's try ""TALKE"":
- T (new consonant)
- A (in word, not in position 1 - this is fine)
- L (new consonant)
- K (new consonant)
- E (in word, not in position 5 - this is fine)

But ""talke"" isn't a valid English word. Let me think of a valid word.

How about ""TALKE"" - no, invalid. Next: ""CLEAT"":
- C (new)
- L (new)
- E (in word, position 3 - fine)
- A (in word, position 4 - fine)
- T (new)

""cleat"" is valid. It uses C, L, E, A, T - none of which are R, O, S. Positions: A is in 4 (not 1), E is in 3 (not 5). This seems like a good next guess to gather more information.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: cleat -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(x) E(-) A(-) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses so far:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.
   - R, O, S are not in the word.

2. cleat → C(x) L(x) E(-) A(-) T(x)
   - C, L, T are not in the word.
   - E is in the word but not in position 3.
   - A is in the word but not in position 4.

So the secret word:
- Must contain A and E.
- Must NOT contain R, O, S, C, L, T.
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
- E cannot be in positions 3 or 5.

Remaining letters to consider (common ones): B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with A and E, avoiding the forbidden letters and respecting the position constraints.

Let's list possible positions:
- A can be in 2, 3, or 5.
- E can be in 1, 2, or 4.

Let's try to find a word that fits these constraints. One systematic way is to pick a word with A in position 2 and E in position 4, or vice versa.

Consider ""BEACH"":
- B (new)
- E (in word, position 2 - allowed)
- A (in word, position 3 - allowed)
- C (forbidden)
- H (new)
But C is forbidden, so this is invalid.

Next, ""PEACH"":
- P (new)
- E (position 2)
- A (position 3)
- C (forbidden)
- H (new)
Again, C is forbidden.

Next, ""MEANT"":
- M (new)
- E (position 2)
- A (position 3)
- N (new)
- T (forbidden)
T is forbidden, so invalid.

Next, ""HEMAN"":
- H (new)
- E (position 2)
- M (new)
- A (position 4) - but A cannot be in position 4 (from cleat feedback)
So this is invalid.

Next, ""BEGAN"":
- B (new)
- E (position 2)
- G (new)
- A (position 4) - invalid
- N (new)

Next, ""FLEAN"":
- F (new)
- L (forbidden)
- E (position 3) - invalid
- A (position 4) - invalid
- N (new)

Next, ""WHEAL"":
- W (new)
- H (new)
- E (position 3) - invalid
- A (position 4) - invalid
- L (forbidden)

Next, ""VEXAN"":
- V (new)
- E (position 2)
- X (new)
- A (position 4) - invalid
- N (new)

This is getting tedious. Let's try a different approach: pick a word where A is in position 5 and E is in position 2.

""BEGAN"" had A in 4, which is invalid. How about ""PEAGE"":
- P (new)
- E (position 2)
- A (position 3)
- G (new)
- E (position 5) - but E cannot be in position 5 (from arose feedback)
Invalid.

Next, ""BEGUM"":
- B (new)
- E (position 2)
- G (new)
- U (new)
- M (new)
But this doesn't have A, which is required.

We must include A and E. Let's try ""BEACH"" variant without C: ""BEADG"" - invalid.

Wait, let's list valid letters: allowed are A, E, plus any not forbidden: so far forbidden are R, O, S, C, L, T.

Remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y.

Let's try ""BEGUM"" - no A.

We need A and E. Let's try ""BEAVER"" - but R is forbidden.

""BEADY"":
- B
- E
- A
- D
- Y
But this is 4 letters, and we need 5.

""BEAKY"":
- B
- E
- A
- K
- Y
This has A and E, and no forbidden letters. Let's check positions:
- A is in position 3 - allowed (from arose: A not in 1; from cleat: A not in 4)
- E is in position 2 - allowed (from arose: E not in 5; from cleat: E not in 3)
This seems valid.

""BEAKY"" is a valid word (British slang for ""beaky"", meaning narrow or sharp).

Let's go with this.Based on the feedback so far, the secret word:
- Must contain A and E.
- Must NOT contain R, O, S, C, L, T.
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
- E cannot be in positions 3 or 5.

A valid word fitting these constraints is ""BEAKY"".

From the latest feedback on “beaky”:
- B is correct in position 1.
- E is correct in position 2.
- A is correct in position 3.
- Y is correct in position 5.
- K is not in the word.

So the secret word has the form: B E A _ Y

We need a 5-letter word that starts with BEA and ends with Y, and does not contain K, R, O, S, C, L, T (from prior guesses).

Possible letters for position 4 (only one unknown): remaining common consonants not yet ruled out include D, F, G, H, I, M, N, P, U, V, W, etc.

Valid English words fitting B E A _ Y:
- BEADY
- BEAGY (not common)
- BEAMY
- BEFYY (invalid)
- BEGYY (invalid)
- BEGUM (doesn’t fit)
- BEVY (only 4 letters)

Among these, BEADY and BEAMY are valid 5-letter words. BEADY uses D, which hasn’t been ruled out yet. BEAMY uses M, also still allowed.

Let’s pick BEADY first, as D is a common letter and hasn’t been tried.

Check constraints:
- B, E, A, Y already confirmed correct positions.
- D hasn’t been used or ruled out yet.
- No forbidden letters (R, O, S, C, L, T, K).

Thus, BEADY is a logical next guess.
