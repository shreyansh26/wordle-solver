### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains common letters: S, L, A, T, E. These letters cover several frequently used consonants and vowels. This should give me good information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

We need a new 5-letter word that contains L, A, E and does NOT contain S or T.  
Good next candidates should place L, A, E in new positions and introduce new common consonants.  
A strong choice is “EARLY”:
- E in position 1 (new position for E)
- A in position 2 (new position for A)
- R (new consonant)
- L in position 4 (new position for L)
- Y (new consonant)

This should help narrow down positions for L, A, E and reveal more about the remaining letters.

Summary of what we know so far:

Letters in the word (but position unknown):
- L, A, E, R   (all showed “-” at least once, so they are present)

Letters NOT in the word:
- S, T

Letters that are in the word and already placed correctly:
- Y is in position 5 (✓)

So the secret word ends with Y and contains L, A, E, R somewhere in the first four positions.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with Y
2. Contains L, A, E, R
3. Does NOT contain S or T

A quick scan of common English words meeting these constraints gives “REALY” (variant spelling of “really”), but that’s not standard. The correct spelling is “REALLY,” which has six letters. Another option is “ELDER” but it ends with R, not Y.

The only standard 5-letter word I can think of that ends in Y and contains L, A, E, R is “REALLY” – but it’s six letters. Wait, let me re-examine.

Actually, the word must be exactly five letters. Let me list possible combinations:

- R, E, A, L, Y → “REALY” is not valid.
- E, A, R, L, Y → no valid word.

Hmm, looks like no standard 5-letter word ends with Y and contains R, A, E, L. Did I miss any letters?

Wait, the feedback says Y is in the correct position (position 5). The other letters (L, A, E, R) must be in the first four positions, but we don’t know their exact positions.

Let me think differently: the word must have Y in position 5 and must include L, A, E, R in positions 1-4. The only possible arrangement is that one of these letters must be in position 5, but we know Y is there. Therefore, the word must be a permutation of R, E, A, L in positions 1-4 followed by Y.

Looking at permutations:
- R, E, A, L → REALY (invalid)
- R, E, L, A → RELAY – this is a valid word!

Let me check RELAY:
- Ends with Y (✓)
- Contains R, E, L, A (all required)
- Does not contain S or T (✓)
- All letters are used from the known set.

This seems to be the only valid word meeting all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess should be RELAY.
