Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently appearing letters in English. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and covers vowels and consonants that appear in many words. This should give me good information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

Current constraints:
- 5th letter is E (fixed).
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, N, B, K.
- Letters that ARE in the word but are misplaced: R (must be in positions 1-4), O (must be in positions 1-4).

So the word looks like: _ _ _ _ E, with R and O somewhere among the first four spots, and no S, L, A, T, C, N, B, K.

Remaining common consonants: D, F, G, H, I, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Remaining vowels: I, O, U (but O is already known to be present)

Possible word patterns:
- R _ O _ E
- O _ R _ E
- R _ _ O E
- O _ _ R E
- _ R O _ E
- _ O R _ E

Let’s list valid words fitting these patterns:
1. DROVE – but V is allowed, D, R, O, V, E. However, we have K already excluded, V wasn’t excluded, but we need to check if DROVE uses any excluded letters. D, R, O, V, E – none are excluded except K was excluded, but D, O, V, E are allowed. Wait, K was excluded, but V wasn’t. However, in BROKE, K was excluded, but V wasn’t tested yet. But DROVE uses D, R, O, V, E – none of which are excluded. But we have to be careful: the excluded letters are S, L, A, T, C, N, B, K. So D, R, O, V, E: R and O are known to be in the word, but their positions are wrong in BROKE. So DROVE could be possible.

But let me think of another word that might be more likely. How about ""GROVE""? G, R, O, V, E – but V is allowed, G is allowed. However, GROVE might not be a common word.

Another option: ""PROVE"" – P, R, O, V, E. But P and V are allowed.

But looking at the feedback, R was in position 2 in BROKE and marked as ""-"", meaning R is in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, O in position 3 was ""-"", so O is in the word but not in position 3. So possible positions for R and O are:
- R could be in positions 1, 3, 4
- O could be in positions 1, 2, 4

Let me think of words that fit these constraints. For example:
- ""DROVE"": D R O V E – but O is in position 3, which was excluded in BROKE (since O in position 3 was ""-""), so O cannot be in position 3. So DROVE is invalid because O is in position 3.

Wait, in BROKE, O was in position 3 and marked as ""-"", so O cannot be in position 3. Similarly, in CRONE, O was in position 3 and marked as ""-"", so O cannot be in position 3. So O must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

Similarly, R in BROKE was in position 2 and marked ""-"", so R cannot be in position 2. In CRONE, R was in position 2 and marked ""-"", so same thing. So R must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Let me try to find words with:
- O in 1, 2, or 4
- R in 1, 3, or 4
- No S, L, A, T, C, N, B, K
- Ends with E

Possible words:
- ""DROVE"" – O in 3 is invalid (already excluded)
- ""PROVE"" – O in 3 is invalid
- ""GROVE"" – O in 3 is invalid
- ""DORIE"" – but I is allowed, but O is in 2, R in 3: D O R I E – but D, O, R, I, E – none excluded. However, R in position 3 was not tested yet (in BROKE R was in 2, in CRONE R was in 2), so R in 3 is possible. O in 2 was not tested in CRONE (O was in 3), so O in 2 is possible.

""DORIE"" is a valid word. But is it common? Maybe not.

Another option: ""MORIE"" – but M, O, R, I, E – but R is in 3, O in 2, ends with E. But ""MORIE"" might not be a valid word.

""FROZE"" – but Z is allowed, F, R, O, Z, E – but O is in 3, which is invalid.

""VOICE"" – but C is excluded.

""WOIRE"" – not a valid word.

""VRODE"" – not a valid word.

""DRIVE"" – but I is allowed, D, R, I, V, E – but O is required, so this is invalid.

""FRIZE"" – but Z is allowed, F, R, I, Z, E – but O is required, so invalid.

""FORGE"" – but G is allowed, F, O, R, G, E – O is in 2, R in 3, ends with E. Let's check:
- O in 2: not tested yet (in CRONE O was 3, in BROKE O was 3), so possible.
- R in 3: not tested yet (in CRONE R was 2, in BROKE R was 2), so possible.
- Letters: F, O, R, G, E – none are excluded (excluded: S, L, A, T, C, N, B, K). So FORGE is valid.

""FORGE"" seems like a good next guess as it places O in 2 and R in 3, which haven't been ruled out yet.

But let me think if there's a better word. ""DORIE"" and ""FORGE"" are both possibilities. ""FORGE"" is more common.

However, in CRONE, O was in 3 and marked ""-"", so O cannot be in 3. In BROKE, O was in 3 and marked ""-"", so same. So O must be in 1, 2, or 4. Similarly, R must be in 1, 3, or 4.

Another word: ""DROVE"" is invalid (O in 3). ""GROVE"" invalid (O in 3). ""PROVE"" invalid (O in 3). 

""VRODE"" – invalid word.

""DRIVE"" – missing O.

""FRIZE"" – missing O.

""FORGE"" – seems valid.

Another option: ""MOROE"" – but M, O, R, O, E – but O repeats, and is O allowed to repeat? The feedback doesn't say, but usually letters can repeat if they appear in the word.

But ""MOROE"" is a valid word (though rare), but let's stick with more common words.

""FROZE"" – O in 3 invalid.

""VRODE"" – invalid.

""ADORE"" – but A is excluded.

""EDORE"" – but E is already in 5, so E D O R E – but D, O, R are allowed, but is E D O R E a valid word? It might be archaic.

""EDORE"" is probably not valid.

""FRODE"" – invalid word.

""PRODE"" – invalid.

""GRODE"" – invalid.

""VRODE"" – invalid.

""WOIRE"" – invalid.

""DORIE"" – valid but uncommon.

""FORGE"" – common word.

Thus, ""FORGE"" seems to be the best next guess.

From the feedback:
- E is locked in position 5.
- R and O are in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 respectively.
- Excluded letters: S, L, A, T, C, N, B, K.

The word must end with E, contain both R and O, and avoid the excluded letters. After analyzing possible positions, ""FORGE"" fits these constraints:
- Ends with E.
- Contains R (position 3) and O (position 2), neither of which have been ruled out by previous feedback.
- Uses only allowed letters (F, O, R, G, E).

- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, N, B, K.
- Letters that ARE in the word but are misplaced: R (must be in positions 1-4), O (must be in positions 1-4).

So the word looks like: _ _ _ _ E, with R and O somewhere among the first four spots, and no S, L, A, T, C, N, B, K.

Remaining common consonants: D, F, G, H, I, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Possible word patterns:

Let’s list valid words fitting these patterns:
1. DROVE – but V is allowed, D, R, O, V, E. However, we have K already excluded, V wasn’t excluded, but we need to check if DROVE uses any excluded letters. D, R, O, V, E – none are excluded except K was excluded, but D, O, V, E are allowed. Wait, K was excluded, but V wasn’t. However, in BROKE, K was excluded, but V wasn’t tested yet. But DROVE uses D, R, O, V, E – none of which are excluded. But we have to be careful: the excluded letters are S, L, A, T, C, N, B, K. So D, R, O, V, E: R and O are known to be in the word, but their positions are wrong in BROKE. So DROVE could be possible.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently appearing letters in English. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and covers vowels and consonants that appear in many words. This should give me good information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- E is in the word and in the correct 5th position.
- S, L, A, T are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and does not contain S, L, A, T.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Does not contain S, L, A, T.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common consonants: N, R, H, D, C, M, P, B, F, G, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A is out).

I’ll try a word that uses several of these. ""CRONE"" uses C, R, O, N, E. It avoids the eliminated letters and tests new ones.

Current constraints:
- Word ends with E (position 5).
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, N.
- Letters in the word but in wrong positions: R (must be in positions 1-4), O (must be in positions 1-4).

I need a 5-letter word ending in E that contains both R and O somewhere in positions 1-4, and avoids S, L, A, T, C, N.

Possible letters left: B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus R and O.

Let me think of words that fit:
- ""BROKE"": B, R, O, K, E – uses R and O in positions 2 and 3, ends with E, and avoids all excluded letters.
- ""DROVE"": D, R, O, V, E – but V is less common; BROKE seems better.
- ""GROPE"": G, R, O, P, E – also valid, but GROPE uses P which is fine.

I’ll choose BROKE as it uses three new letters (B, K) and confirms positions for R and O.

- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, N, B, K.
- Letters that ARE in the word but are misplaced: R (must be in positions 1-4), O (must be in positions 1-4).

So the word looks like: _ _ _ _ E, with R and O somewhere among the first four spots, and no S, L, A, T, C, N, B, K.

Remaining common consonants: D, F, G, H, I, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Remaining vowels: I, O, U (but O is already known to be present)

Possible word patterns:
- R _ O _ E
- O _ R _ E
- R _ _ O E
- O _ _ R E
- _ R O _ E
- _ O R _ E

Let’s list valid words fitting these patterns:
1. DROVE – but V is allowed, D, R, O, V, E. However, we have K already excluded, V wasn’t excluded, but we need to check if DROVE uses any excluded letters. D, R, O, V, E – none are excluded except K was excluded, but D, O, V, E are allowed. Wait, K was excluded, but V wasn’t. However, in BROKE, K was excluded, but V wasn’t tested yet. But DROVE uses D, R, O, V, E – none of which are excluded. But we have to be careful: the excluded letters are S, L, A, T, C, N, B, K. So D, R, O, V, E: R and O are known to be in the word, but their positions are wrong in BROKE. So DROVE could be possible.

But let me think of another word that might be more likely. How about ""GROVE""? G, R, O, V, E – but V is allowed, G is allowed. However, GROVE might not be a common word.

Another option: ""PROVE"" – P, R, O, V, E. But P and V are allowed.

But looking at the feedback, R was in position 2 in BROKE and marked as ""-"", meaning R is in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, O in position 3 was ""-"", so O is in the word but not in position 3. So possible positions for R and O are:
- R could be in positions 1, 3, 4
- O could be in positions 1, 2, 4

Let me think of words that fit these constraints. For example:
- ""DROVE"": D R O V E – but O is in position 3, which was excluded in BROKE (since O in position 3 was ""-""), so O cannot be in position 3. So DROVE is invalid because O is in position 3.

Wait, in BROKE, O was in position 3 and marked as ""-"", so O cannot be in position 3. Similarly, in CRONE, O was in position 3 and marked as ""-"", so O cannot be in position 3. So O must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

Similarly, R in BROKE was in position 2 and marked ""-"", so R cannot be in position 2. In CRONE, R was in position 2 and marked ""-"", so same thing. So R must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Let me try to find words with:
- O in 1, 2, or 4
- R in 1, 3, or 4
- No S, L, A, T, C, N, B, K
- Ends with E

Possible words:
- ""DROVE"" – O in 3 is invalid (already excluded)
- ""PROVE"" – O in 3 is invalid
- ""GROVE"" – O in 3 is invalid
- ""DORIE"" – but I is allowed, but O is in 2, R in 3: D O R I E – but D, O, R, I, E – none excluded. However, R in position 3 was not tested yet (in BROKE R was in 2, in CRONE R was in 2), so R in 3 is possible. O in 2 was not tested in CRONE (O was in 3), so O in 2 is possible.

""DORIE"" is a valid word. But is it common? Maybe not.

Another option: ""MORIE"" – but M, O, R, I, E – but R is in 3, O in 2, ends with E. But ""MORIE"" might not be a valid word.

""FROZE"" – but Z is allowed, F, R, O, Z, E – but O is in 3, which is invalid.

""VOICE"" – but C is excluded.

""WOIRE"" – not a valid word.

""VRODE"" – not a valid word.

""DRIVE"" – but I is allowed, D, R, I, V, E – but O is required, so this is invalid.

""FRIZE"" – but Z is allowed, F, R, I, Z, E – but O is required, so invalid.

""FORGE"" – but G is allowed, F, O, R, G, E – O is in 2, R in 3, ends with E. Let's check:
- O in 2: not tested yet (in CRONE O was 3, in BROKE O was 3), so possible.
- R in 3: not tested yet (in CRONE R was 2, in BROKE R was 2), so possible.
- Letters: F, O, R, G, E – none are excluded (excluded: S, L, A, T, C, N, B, K). So FORGE is valid.

""FORGE"" seems like a good next guess as it places O in 2 and R in 3, which haven't been ruled out yet.

But let me think if there's a better word. ""DORIE"" and ""FORGE"" are both possibilities. ""FORGE"" is more common.

However, in CRONE, O was in 3 and marked ""-"", so O cannot be in 3. In BROKE, O was in 3 and marked ""-"", so same. So O must be in 1, 2, or 4. Similarly, R must be in 1, 3, or 4.

Another word: ""DROVE"" is invalid (O in 3). ""GROVE"" invalid (O in 3). ""PROVE"" invalid (O in 3). 

""VRODE"" – invalid word.

""DRIVE"" – missing O.

""FRIZE"" – missing O.

""FORGE"" – seems valid.

Another option: ""MOROE"" – but M, O, R, O, E – but O repeats, and is O allowed to repeat? The feedback doesn't say, but usually letters can repeat if they appear in the word.

But ""MOROE"" is a valid word (though rare), but let's stick with more common words.

""FROZE"" – O in 3 invalid.

""VRODE"" – invalid.

""ADORE"" – but A is excluded.

""EDORE"" – but E is already in 5, so E D O R E – but D, O, R are allowed, but is E D O R E a valid word? It might be archaic.

""EDORE"" is probably not valid.

""FRODE"" – invalid word.

""PRODE"" – invalid.

""GRODE"" – invalid.

""VRODE"" – invalid.

""WOIRE"" – invalid.

""DORIE"" – valid but uncommon.

""FORGE"" – common word.

Thus, ""FORGE"" seems to be the best next guess.From the feedback:
- E is locked in position 5.
- R and O are in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 respectively.

DROVE – but V is allowed, D, R, O, V, E. However, we have K already excluded, V wasn’t excluded, but we need to check if DROVE uses any excluded letters. D, R, O, V, E – none are excluded except K was excluded, but D, O, V, E are allowed. Wait, K was excluded, but V wasn’t. However, in BROKE, K was excluded, but V wasn’t tested yet. But DROVE uses D, R, O, V, E – none of which are excluded. But we have to be careful: the excluded letters are S, L, A, T, C, N, B, K. So D, R, O, V, E: R and O are known to be in the word, but their positions are wrong in BROKE. So DROVE could be possible.\n\nBut let me think of another word that might be more likely. How about ""GROVE""? G, R, O, V, E – but V is allowed, G is allowed. However, GROVE might not be a common word.\n\nAnother option: ""PROVE"" – P, R, O, V, E. But P and V are allowed.\n\nBut looking at the feedback, R was in position 2 in BROKE and marked as ""-"", meaning R is in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, O in position 3 was ""-"", so O is in the word but not in position 3. So possible positions for R and O are:\n- R could be in positions 1, 3, 4\n- O could be in positions 1, 2, 4\n\nLet me think of words that fit these constraints. For example:\n- ""DROVE"": D R O V E – but O is in position 3, which was excluded in BROKE (since O in position 3 was ""-""), so O cannot be in position 3. So DROVE is invalid because O is in position 3.\n\nWait, in BROKE, O was in position 3 and marked as ""-"", so O cannot be in position 3. Similarly, in CRONE, O was in position 3 and marked as ""-"", so O cannot be in position 3. So O must be in position 1, 2, or 4.\n\nSimilarly, R in BROKE was in position 2 and marked ""-"", so R cannot be in position 2. In CRONE, R was in position 2 and marked ""-"", so same thing. So R must be in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nLet me try to find words with:\n- O in 1, 2, or 4\n- R in 1, 3, or 4\n- No S, L, A, T, C, N, B, K\n- Ends with E\n\nPossible words:\n- ""DROVE"" – O in 3 is invalid (already excluded)\n- ""PROVE"" – O in 3 is invalid\n- ""GROVE"" – O in 3 is invalid\n- ""DORIE"" – but I is allowed, but O is in 2, R in 3: D O R I E – but D, O, R, I, E – none excluded. However, R in position 3 was not tested yet (in BROKE R was in 2, in CRONE R was in 2), so R in 3 is possible. O in 2 was not tested in CRONE (O was in 3), so O in 2 is possible.\n\n""DORIE"" is a valid word. But is it common? Maybe not.\n\nAnother option: ""MORIE"" – but M, O, R, I, E – but R is in 3, O in 2, ends with E. But ""MORIE"" might not be a valid word.\n\n""FROZE"" – but Z is allowed, F, R, O, Z, E – but O is in 3, which is invalid.\n\n""VOICE"" – but C is excluded.\n\n""WOIRE"" – not a valid word.\n\n""VRODE"" – not a valid word.\n\n""DRIVE"" – but I is allowed, D, R, I, V, E – but O is required, so this is invalid.\n\n""FRIZE"" – but Z is allowed, F, R, I, Z, E – but O is required, so invalid.\n\n""FORGE"" – but G is allowed, F, O, R, G, E – O is in 2, R in 3, ends with E. Let\'s check:\n- O in 2: not tested yet (in CRONE O was 3, in BROKE O was 3), so possible.\n- R in 3: not tested yet (in CRONE R was 2, in BROKE R was 2), so possible.\n- Letters: F, O, R, G, E – none are excluded (excluded: S, L, A, T, C, N, B, K). So FORGE is valid.\n\n""FORGE"" seems like a good next guess as it places O in 2 and R in 3, which haven\'t been ruled out yet.\n\nBut let me think if there\'s a better word. ""DORIE"" and ""FORGE"" are both possibilities. ""FORGE"" is more common.\n\nHowever, in CRONE, O was in 3 and marked ""-"", so O cannot be in 3. In BROKE, O was in 3 and marked ""-"", so same. So O must be in 1, 2, or 4. Similarly, R must be in 1, 3, or 4.\n\nAnother word: ""DROVE"" is invalid (O in 3). ""GROVE"" invalid (O in 3). ""PROVE"" invalid (O in 3). \n\n""VRODE"" – invalid word.\n\n""DRIVE"" – missing O.\n\n""FRIZE"" – missing O.\n\n""FORGE"" – seems valid.\n\nAnother option: ""MOROE"" – but M, O, R, O, E – but O repeats, and is O allowed to repeat? The feedback doesn\'t say, but usually letters can repeat if they appear in the word.\n\nBut ""MOROE"" is a valid word (though rare), but let\'s stick with more common words.\n\n""FROZE"" – O in 3 invalid.\n\n""VRODE"" – invalid.\n\n""ADORE"" – but A is excluded.\n\n""EDORE"" – but E is already in 5, so E D O R E – but D, O, R are allowed, but is E D O R E a valid word? It might be archaic.\n\n""EDORE"" is probably not valid.\n\n""FRODE"" – invalid word.\n\n""PRODE"" – invalid.\n\n""GRODE"" – invalid.\n\n""VRODE"" – invalid.\n\n""WOIRE"" – invalid.\n\n""DORIE"" – valid but uncommon.\n\n""FORGE"" – common word.\n\nThus, ""FORGE"" seems to be the best next guess.From the feedback:\n- E is locked in position 5.\n- R and O are in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 respectively.\n- Excluded letters: S, L, A, T, C, N, B, K.\n\nThe word must end with E, contain both R and O, and avoid the excluded letters. After analyzing possible positions, ""FORGE"" fits these constraints:\n- Ends with E.\n- Contains R (position 3) and O (position 2), neither of which have been ruled out by previous feedback.\n- Uses only allowed letters (F, O, R, G, E).\n\n<guess>FORGE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: CRONE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) O(-) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: BROKE -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(-) O(-) K(x) E(✓)\nGuess 4: FORGE -> FEEDBACK: F(x) O(✓) R(-) G(✓) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
From the latest feedback on FORGE:
- F(x) → F is NOT in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2).
- R(-) → R is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- G(✓) → G is in the word AND in the correct position (position 4).
- E(✓) → E is already confirmed in position 5.

So the pattern is now: _ O _ G E

Known letters:
- Position 2: O
- Position 4: G
- Position 5: E

Letters still in play (must appear somewhere in positions 1 or 3):
- R (from earlier feedback, must be in position 1 or 3 since it can't be in 2,3,4,5 based on previous exclusions)

Excluded letters so far: S, L, A, T, C, N, B, K, F.

Remaining common consonants for position 1 or 3: D, H, I, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a letter in position 1 or 3 that is R (since R must be in the word and hasn't been placed yet). R cannot be in position 3 (because FORGE showed R is not in position 3), so R must be in position 1.

Thus the pattern is: R O _ G E

Now we need a valid 5-letter word that starts with RO and ends with GE. The only common word fitting this is ""ROUGE"" (though it's uncommon), but let's check:

""ROUGE"" uses R, O, U, G, E. All these letters are allowed (not in the excluded list). It fits the pattern:
- R in position 1 (correct placement)
- O in position 2 (correct placement)
- U is a new letter to test
- G in position 4 (correct placement)
- E in position 5 (correct placement)

""ROUGE"" is the only common word that fits the pattern RO _ GE.
