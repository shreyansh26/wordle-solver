### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use some of these letters. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives us good coverage across the alphabet. This should help us quickly identify which of these common letters are in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓) — so the word ends in E.

We know:
1. Word ends with E.
2. S is somewhere in positions 1-4 (since position 4 was already tried and failed).
3. No A, R, O anywhere in the word.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that contains S but not A, R, or O. Good letters to try next might include T, N, I, L, C, etc.

A strong next guess is “STEIN”:
- S is moved to position 1.
- T and I are common letters not yet tested.
- N is also common.
- Ends with E as confirmed.

This tests new letters (T, I, N) while repositioning S and confirming the known E at the end.

We need a 5-letter word starting with S and ending with E that contains T and I in the middle three positions, without using A, R, O, N.

A good candidate is “SITE_” but we need a full word. The word “STILE” fits:
- S ✓ in position 1
- T in position 2 (was in position 4 before, so new position)
- I in position 3 (was in position 4 before, so new position)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use some of these letters. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives us good coverage across the alphabet. This should help us quickly identify which of these common letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓) — so the word ends in E.

We know:
1. Word ends with E.
2. S is somewhere in positions 1-4 (since position 4 was already tried and failed).
3. No A, R, O anywhere in the word.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that contains S but not A, R, or O. Good letters to try next might include T, N, I, L, C, etc.

A strong next guess is “STEIN”:
- S is moved to position 1.
- T and I are common letters not yet tested.
- N is also common.
- Ends with E as confirmed.

This tests new letters (T, I, N) while repositioning S and confirming the known E at the end.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. STEIN → S(✓) T(-) E(-) I(-) N(x)
   - S is now confirmed in position 1.
   - T, E, I are in the word but in wrong positions.
   - N is NOT in the word.

We now know:
- Word pattern: S _ _ _ E
- Letters definitely present: S, T, E, I
- Letters definitely absent: A, R, O, N
- E must appear exactly once (since only one ✓ for E).

Possible remaining positions for T and I are 2, 3, or 4 (since E is fixed at 5 and S at 1).

We need a 5-letter word starting with S and ending with E that contains T and I in the middle three positions, without using A, R, O, N.

A good candidate is “SITE_” but we need a full word. The word “STILE” fits:
- S ✓ in position 1
- T in position 2 (was in position 4 before, so new position)
- I in position 3 (was in position 4 before, so new position)
- L is a new letter to test
- E ✓ in position 5

This tests the remaining positions for T and I while introducing L.

- Ends with E
- Contains T in position 2 or 4
- Uses only the remaining valid letters (no A, R, O, N, L)

Possible T placements:
- T in position 2 → S T I _ E → possible letters for position 4: from remaining valid letters (C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.)
- T in position 4 → S _ I T E → check if any word fits this

Looking at T in position 2:
STI_E → need a valid word. The only common English word fitting is ""STILE"" but L is already excluded. Next possible is ""STIME"" but that's not valid. ""STIBE"" isn't valid. No clear valid word here.

Looking at T in position 4:
S _ I T E → possible words:
- ""SPI TE"" → ""SPI TE"" isn't valid.
- ""SKITE"" isn't valid.
- ""SHITE"" isn't valid.
- ""SMITE"" → uses M, which hasn't been excluded yet.

SMITE:
- S ✓ position 1
- M new letter
- I ✓ position 3
- T in position 4 (was in position 2 before, new position)
- E ✓ position 5

This uses all confirmed letters and places T in a new position while introducing M to test.

We now have:

- Pattern: S _ I T E  (positions 1,3,4,5 locked)
- Letters confirmed present: S, I, T, E
- Letters confirmed absent: A, R, O, N, L, M

The only remaining unknown is position 2.  
We need a 5-letter word that starts with S, has I in position 3, T in position 4, ends with E, and does NOT contain any of the excluded letters.

Possible letters for position 2 (from remaining valid ones):  
C, D, F, G, H, K, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

The only common English word that fits S _ I T E and uses one of these letters is:

S C I T E  →  SCITE (not a valid English word)  
S H I T E  →  SHITE (slang, not standard)  
S P I T E  →  SPI TE (invalid)  
S W I T E  →  SWITE (invalid)  
S V I T E  →  VRITE (invalid)  

Wait—there’s one we’re missing:  
S P I T E → no, that’s SPI TE.  
But “SPI TE” isn’t a word.  

Actually, the valid word fitting S _ I T E is:

S P I T E → no, that’s not valid.  
Wait—let me double-check: the valid word is “SPITE” (S-P-I-T-E).  

Yes, “SPITE” is a valid English word and fits all constraints:
- S ✓ position 1
- P new letter
- I ✓ position 3
- T ✓ position 4
- E ✓ position 5

And P has not been excluded yet.

So our next guess is SPITE.

We now know the exact pattern:

S _ I T E

and we have tested the following letters in position 2:

- arose: A (x) – A is out  
- stein: T (but T is already locked in position 4)  
- stile: L (x) – L is out  
- smite: M (x) – M is out  
- spite: P (x) – P is out  

Letters already ruled-out for position 2: A, L, M, P, N, R, O.

Remaining valid letters for position 2 (from the alphabet minus all excluded ones):  
C, D, F, G, H, K, U, V, W, Y, etc.

The only common English word that fits S _ I T E is:

S C I T E → “SCITE” – not valid  
S D I T E → “SDITE” – not valid  
S F I T E → “SFITE” – not valid  
S H I T E → “SHITE” – slang, not standard  
S K I T E → “SKITE” – not standard  
S U I T E → “SUITE” – valid word!

“SUITE”:
- S ✓ position 1  
- U new letter (not yet excluded)  
- I ✓ position 3  
- T ✓ position 4  
- E ✓ position 5  

No other common 5-letter word fits S _ I T E except SUITE, and we have not yet tried U. Therefore SUITE is the logical next guess.
