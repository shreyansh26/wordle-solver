### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
This combination gives me maximum information about which letters might be in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on “arose”:

- A(x) → A is not in the word.  
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.  
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.  
- S(x) → S is not in the word.  
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in position 5.

So far we know:
- The word ends in E.  
- It contains R and O, but not A, S.  
- R is not in position 2 and O is not in position 3.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep the confirmed E in position 5.  
2. Place R and O in new positions.  
3. Introduce other common consonants and vowels to narrow things down.

A candidate that satisfies these constraints is “ROUTE”:
- R moves from position 2 to position 1.  
- O moves from position 3 to position 2.  
- U and T are new common letters.  
- Ends with the confirmed E.

This should help us test the new positions for R and O, plus learn about U and T.

Let’s summarize what we now know:

1. E is fixed in position 5 (✓ every time).
2. O is fixed in position 2 (✓ every time).
3. R is in the word, but it is NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (from arose, route, drone).  
   Therefore R must be in position 4.
4. Letters already ruled out: A, S, U, T, N.  
   Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus vowels I).

So the pattern is:  
_ O _ R E

We need a 5-letter word that matches this pattern and only uses allowed letters.

Common words that fit _ O _ R E:
- BORNE – but N is out.  
- COVER – V is allowed, but we need to check.  
- GLOVE – V is allowed, but G and L are new.  
- PROBE – P and B are new.  
- FORCE – C and F are new.  
- MORPE – M and P are new, but “MORPE” is uncommon.  
- LORIE – but I is allowed, and L, O, R, I, E are all allowed letters.  
- CRORE – R repeats, but R is already known.  
- GROPE – G, P are new.

The most straightforward common word seems to be “FORCE”:
- F and C are new consonants.  
- I is a new vowel.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
This combination gives me maximum information about which letters might be in the secret word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:

- A(x) → A is not in the word.  
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.  
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.  
- S(x) → S is not in the word.  
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in position 5.

So far we know:
- The word ends in E.  
- It contains R and O, but not A, S.  
- R is not in position 2 and O is not in position 3.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep the confirmed E in position 5.  
2. Place R and O in new positions.  
3. Introduce other common consonants and vowels to narrow things down.

A candidate that satisfies these constraints is “ROUTE”:
- R moves from position 2 to position 1.  
- O moves from position 3 to position 2.  
- U and T are new common letters.  
- Ends with the confirmed E.

This should help us test the new positions for R and O, plus learn about U and T.

- A, S, U, T are not in the word.

Letters we still need to test: common consonants like N, L, D, C, G, H, plus any remaining vowels I, Y.

We also know R must be in position 3 or 4 (since it can't be 1, 2, or 5).

A good next guess should:
1. Keep O in position 2 and E in position 5.
2. Place R in a new possible position (3 or 4).
3. Introduce new common consonants and vowels.

A candidate that fits is ""GROPE"":
- G and P are new common consonants.
- R is now in position 2 (but we know R is not in position 2 from arose feedback). Oops, that's invalid.

Next candidate: ""CRORE"":
- C and R again, but R is in position 2 (invalid).

Next: ""DRONE"":
- D and N are new consonants.
- R is in position 3 (valid since R could be here).
- O and E positions are confirmed.

Let’s summarize what we now know:

1. E is fixed in position 5 (✓ every time).
2. O is fixed in position 2 (✓ every time).
3. R is in the word, but it is NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (from arose, route, drone).  
   Therefore R must be in position 4.
4. Letters already ruled out: A, S, U, T, N.  
   Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus vowels I).

So the pattern is:  
_ O _ R E

We need a 5-letter word that matches this pattern and only uses allowed letters.

Common words that fit _ O _ R E:
- BORNE – but N is out.  
- COVER – V is allowed, but we need to check.  
- GLOVE – V is allowed, but G and L are new.  
- PROBE – P and B are new.  
- FORCE – C and F are new.  
- MORPE – M and P are new, but “MORPE” is uncommon.  
- LORIE – but I is allowed, and L, O, R, I, E are all allowed letters.  
- CRORE – R repeats, but R is already known.  
- GROPE – G, P are new.

The most straightforward common word seems to be “FORCE”:
- F and C are new consonants.  
- I is a new vowel.  
- It fits _ O _ R E: F O R C E.

Let’s try it.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: route -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) U(x) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: drone -> FEEDBACK: D(-) R(-) O(-) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 4: force -> FEEDBACK: F(x) O(✓) R(✓) C(x) E(✓)

From the feedback so far we have:

1. E is fixed in position 5.
2. O is fixed in position 2.
3. R is fixed in position 3 (✓ in force).
4. Letters ruled out: A, S, U, T, N, F, C.

So the pattern is: _ O R _ E

Letters still allowed: B, D, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus vowels I).

We need a 5-letter word matching _ O R _ E. Common examples:
- BORNE – N is out.
- GROPE – P is allowed, G is allowed.
- PROBE – P, B are allowed.
- DROVE – D is allowed, V is allowed.
- GROVE – G, V are allowed.
- BROKE – B, K are allowed.
- GROPE vs PROBE vs DROVE vs BROKE – GROPE seems common enough.

Let’s pick GROPE.

G – new consonant, P – new consonant, O and E already confirmed, R confirmed in position 3.

GROPE uses only allowed letters and fits the pattern.
