For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information I can gain. The best strategy is to use a word that contains common letters in the English language, particularly vowels and common consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should include several of these. 

Some popular starting words are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - vowel-heavy
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A, O (common vowels)
- R, S (common consonants)
- E (very common letter)

This should give good coverage of common letters to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters definitely excluded: R, O, E
- Letters included but misplaced: A, S
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels (T, L, N, I, C, U, etc.)

A good next guess should:
1. Keep the known letters A and S in different positions.
2. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tested yet.
3. Avoid re-using R, O, E.

Let’s try “STAIN”:
- S moves to position 1 (allowed since S is in the word but not necessarily in position 4).
- T, I, N are new common letters.
- A moves to position 4 (allowed since A is in the word but not in position 1).

This tests new consonants (T, N) and the vowel I while repositioning the known letters A and S.

Current confirmed facts:
1. S is fixed in position 1.
2. T is fixed in position 5.
3. A is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (because it was “-” in positions 1 and 4 in previous guesses).  
   Therefore A must be in position 5, but position 5 is already taken by T.  
   → Contradiction. That means our interpretation of the feedback must be updated.

Re-examining the feedback on “stain”:  
S(✓) means S is in position 1 and correct.  
T(-) means T is in the word but not in position 2.  
A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 3.  
I(x) and N(x) are exclusions.

On “shalt”:  
S(✓) again confirms S in position 1.  
H(x) and L(x) are exclusions.  
A(-) confirms A is in the word but not in position 3.  
T(✓) confirms T is in position 5.

So far:
- Word pattern: S _ _ _ T
- A must be somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4 (since it was “-” in position 3 on “stain”, but the “-” only rules out position 3, not the others).  
Wait: on “stain” A was in position 3 and got “-”, so A is NOT in position 3.  
On “shalt” A was in position 3 again and got “-”, reinforcing A is NOT in position 3.  
Thus A must be in 2 or 4.

We still need to test common consonants not yet used: C, D, F, G, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
- Keeps S in 1 and T in 5.
- Places A in position 2 or 4.
- Introduces new common letters.

Candidate: SCARF  
- S(1), C, A(3) but A cannot be in 3 → reject.  
Candidate: SPLIT → A not present → reject.  
Candidate: SPACE → A in 3 → reject.

Hmm, many words with S _ _ _ T have A in 3, which is excluded.  
Alternative: A in position 2.  
Pattern: S A _ _ T.  
Common consonants left: C, D, F, G, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information I can gain. The best strategy is to use a word that contains common letters in the English language, particularly vowels and common consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should include several of these. 

Some popular starting words are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - vowel-heavy
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A, O (common vowels)
- R, S (common consonants)
- E (very common letter)

This should give good coverage of common letters to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters definitely excluded: R, O, E
- Letters included but misplaced: A, S
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels (T, L, N, I, C, U, etc.)

A good next guess should:
1. Keep the known letters A and S in different positions.
2. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tested yet.
3. Avoid re-using R, O, E.

Let’s try “STAIN”:
- S moves to position 1 (allowed since S is in the word but not necessarily in position 4).
- T, I, N are new common letters.
- A moves to position 4 (allowed since A is in the word but not in position 1).

This tests new consonants (T, N) and the vowel I while repositioning the known letters A and S.

Summary of what we now know:

1. Letters definitely excluded: R, O, E, I, N
2. Letters confirmed present: S (and it is in position 1)
3. Letters present but wrong position so far:
   - A (must be in positions 2,3,4,5)
   - T (must be in positions 2,3,4,5)
   - S is already locked in position 1
4. Still need to test common consonants and vowels not yet used: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

We want a word that:
- Has S in position 1
- Places A and T in new positions (not their previous ones: A not in 4, T not in 2)
- Introduces new common letters

Possible candidates:
- SCARF – but F is less common
- SLANT – but N is excluded
- STAFF – but F is less common
- SHALT – H and L are new, A in 3, T in 4 (both allowed)

""SHALT"" uses:
- S in 1 (confirmed)
- H and L (new common letters)
- A in 3 (allowed, since A was not in 3 before)
- T in 4 (allowed, since T was not in 4 before)

This seems optimal for gathering more information.

Re-examining the feedback on “stain”:  
S(✓) means S is in position 1 and correct.

A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 3.

A(-) confirms A is in the word but not in position 3.  
T(✓) confirms T is in position 5.

So far:
- Word pattern: S _ _ _ T
- A must be somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4 (since it was “-” in position 3 on “stain”, but the “-” only rules out position 3, not the others).  
Wait: on “stain” A was in position 3 and got “-”, so A is NOT in position 3.  
On “shalt” A was in position 3 again and got “-”, reinforcing A is NOT in position 3.

From all feedback so far:

1. S is locked in position 1.
2. T is locked in position 5.
3. A is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (it has been marked “-” in positions 2, 3, 4, and 5).  
   → The only remaining possible position for A is position 1, but position 1 is already occupied by S.  
   → This contradiction implies our earlier interpretation must be wrong.

Re-examine the feedback carefully:

- arose: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)

  – S is in the word but not in position 4.

- sadly: S(✓) A(-) D(x) L(x) Y(x)

Consolidated facts:
- S is in position 1 (✓).
- T is in position 5 (✓).
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.  
  – This is impossible unless the word has no valid positions for A, which means we must have mis-read the feedback.

Wait: the feedback symbols are per-letter, not per-position. Let’s re-interpret:

For arose: A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 1.  
S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 4.

For stain: S(✓) means S is in position 1.  
T(-) means T is in the word but not in position 2.  
A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 3.

T(✓) confirms T in position 5.

For sadly: S(✓) confirms S in position 1.  
A(-) confirms A is in the word but not in position 2.

So A must be in the word and cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3.  
Possible positions for A: 4.

Thus the pattern is: S _ _ A T.

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, ending with AT, and having A in position 4.

Common words that fit: SCARF (but F is new), SCALE (E is new), SKATE (K is new), SPAT (only 4 letters), SMALT (rare), SHALT (already tried), SWALT (non-word).

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information I can gain. The best strategy is to use a word that contains common letters in the English language, particularly vowels and common consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should include several of these. 

Some popular starting words are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - vowel-heavy
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A, O (common vowels)
- R, S (common consonants)
- E (very common letter)

This should give good coverage of common letters to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters definitely excluded: R, O, E
- Letters included but misplaced: A, S
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels (T, L, N, I, C, U, etc.)

A good next guess should:
1. Keep the known letters A and S in different positions.
2. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tested yet.
3. Avoid re-using R, O, E.

Let’s try “STAIN”:
- S moves to position 1 (allowed since S is in the word but not necessarily in position 4).
- T, I, N are new common letters.
- A moves to position 4 (allowed since A is in the word but not in position 1).

This tests new consonants (T, N) and the vowel I while repositioning the known letters A and S.

Summary of what we now know:

1. Letters definitely excluded: R, O, E, I, N
2. Letters confirmed present: S (and it is in position 1)
3. Letters present but wrong position so far:
   - A (must be in positions 2,3,4,5)
   - T (must be in positions 2,3,4,5)
   - S is already locked in position 1
4. Still need to test common consonants and vowels not yet used: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

We want a word that:
- Has S in position 1
- Places A and T in new positions (not their previous ones: A not in 4, T not in 2)
- Introduces new common letters

Possible candidates:
- SCARF – but F is less common
- SLANT – but N is excluded
- STAFF – but F is less common
- SHALT – H and L are new, A in 3, T in 4 (both allowed)

""SHALT"" uses:
- S in 1 (confirmed)
- H and L (new common letters)
- A in 3 (allowed, since A was not in 3 before)
- T in 4 (allowed, since T was not in 4 before)

This seems optimal for gathering more information.

Current confirmed facts:
1. S is fixed in position 1.
2. T is fixed in position 5.
3. A is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (because it was “-” in positions 1 and 4 in previous guesses).  
   Therefore A must be in position 5, but position 5 is already taken by T.  
   → Contradiction. That means our interpretation of the feedback must be updated.

Re-examining the feedback on “stain”:  
S(✓) means S is in position 1 and correct.  
T(-) means T is in the word but not in position 2.  
A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 3.  
I(x) and N(x) are exclusions.

On “shalt”:  
S(✓) again confirms S in position 1.  
H(x) and L(x) are exclusions.  
A(-) confirms A is in the word but not in position 3.  
T(✓) confirms T is in position 5.

So far:
- Word pattern: S _ _ _ T
- A must be somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4 (since it was “-” in position 3 on “stain”, but the “-” only rules out position 3, not the others).  
Wait: on “stain” A was in position 3 and got “-”, so A is NOT in position 3.  
On “shalt” A was in position 3 again and got “-”, reinforcing A is NOT in position 3.  
Thus A must be in 2 or 4.

We still need to test common consonants not yet used: C, D, F, G, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
- Keeps S in 1 and T in 5.
- Places A in position 2 or 4.
- Introduces new common letters.

Candidate: SCARF  
- S(1), C, A(3) but A cannot be in 3 → reject.  
Candidate: SPLIT → A not present → reject.  
Candidate: SPACE → A in 3 → reject.  
Candidate: SWAPT → uses W, P; A in 3 → reject.  
Candidate: SQUAT → A in 3 → reject.  
Candidate: SLATE → A in 3 → reject (L and E already tested).  
Candidate: SHAKY → A in 3 → reject.  
Candidate: SCAMP → A in 3 → reject.  
Candidate: SUGAR → A in 3 → reject.  
Candidate: SCUFF → A not present → reject.  
Candidate: SPANK → A in 3 → reject.  
Candidate: SNAFT → A in 3 → reject.  
Candidate: SCANT → A in 3 → reject (N and T already fixed).

Hmm, many words with S _ _ _ T have A in 3, which is excluded.  
Alternative: A in position 2.  
Pattern: S A _ _ T.  
Common consonants left: C, D, F, G, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Try SADLY:  
- S A D L Y → positions: S(1), A(2), D(3), L(4), Y(5).  
Letters not yet tested: D, L, Y.  
No exclusions yet for D, L, Y.  
This fits the pattern S A _ _ T and places A in 2 (allowed).

- A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

T(✓) confirms T in position 5.

For sadly: S(✓) confirms S in position 1.  
A(-) confirms A is in the word but not in position 2.

So A must be in the word and cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3.  
Possible positions for A: 4.

Thus the pattern is: S _ _ A T.

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, ending with AT, and having A in position 4.

Common words that fit: SCARF (but F is new), SCALE (E is new), SKATE (K is new), SPAT (only 4 letters), SMALT (rare), SHALT (already tried), SWALT (non-word).

Let’s try SKATE:
- S(1), K(2), A(4), T(5).  
- Letters: S, K, A, T.  
- K is new and common.

This fits all constraints:
- S in 1 (✓).

   - S is in position 1 (✓).
   - T is in the word but NOT in position 2.
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 3.

3. shalt → S(✓) H(x) A(-) L(x) T(✓)
   - S is in position 1 (✓).
   - T is in position 5 (✓).
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (confirmed).

4. sadly → S(✓) A(-) D(x) L(x) Y(x)
   - S is in position 1 (✓).
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 2.

5. skate → S(✓) K(x) A(-) T(-) E(x)
   - S is in position 1 (✓).
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (already known).
   - T is in the word but NOT in position 4 (since it is already locked in position 5, this is redundant).

So far we know:
- S is in position 1.
- T is in position 5.
- A is in the word but cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (from arose, sadly, stain, shalt).
  - Therefore A must be in position 4.
- Positions 2 and 3 must be filled with letters not yet ruled out.

Letters already excluded: R, O, E, I, N, H, L, D, Y, K.
Still available common consonants: C, F, G, M, P, U, V, W, etc.

We need a word of the form S _ _ A T. Common English words that fit:
- SCART (non-word)
- SCAT  (valid word, but only 4 letters)
- SCAFT (non-word)
- SCAPT (non-word)
- SUGAT (non-word)
- SQUAT (valid word, Q not yet excluded)
- SWAPT (non-word)
- SMALT (rare but valid)
- SQUAT is the most common 5-letter word fitting S _ _ A T.

Let’s verify SQUAT:
- S(1), Q(2), U(3), A(4), T(5).
- Q and U are not yet excluded by any feedback.
- This satisfies all constraints:
  - S in 1 (✓)
  - T in 5 (✓)
  - A in 4 (✓)
  - Q and U are new positions for A (4) and T (5).
