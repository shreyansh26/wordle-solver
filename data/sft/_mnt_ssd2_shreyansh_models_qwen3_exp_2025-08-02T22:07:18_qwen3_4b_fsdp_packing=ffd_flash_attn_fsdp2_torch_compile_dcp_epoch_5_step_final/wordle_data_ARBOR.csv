### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll pick a word that uses some of these high-frequency letters to maximize the information gained. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains 5 common letters and no duplicates.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is correct in position 1.
- R is correct in position 2.
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (so it must appear at 3,4 or 5).
- S and E are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- Pattern: A R _ _ _
- O is somewhere in positions 3-5.
- Letters to exclude: S, E.

I now want a word that:
1. Starts with AR.
2. Contains O in positions 3,4, or 5.
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible candidates:
- ARBOR (but has B, which isn't ruled out yet)
- ARDOR (but has D, which isn't ruled out yet)
- ARGON (but has G, which isn't ruled out yet)

Let me pick ""ARDOR"" because it keeps A and R in place, puts O in position 3, and introduces D which is a common letter not yet tested.

From the two guesses and their feedback:

Guess 1: arose → A(✓) R(✓) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ardor → A(✓) R(✓) D(x) O(✓) R(✓)

We now know:

1. Pattern: A R _ O R
2. Letters already eliminated: S, E, D
3. The third letter must be a letter that hasn’t been ruled out yet and must fit the pattern.

Looking at the pattern A R _ O R, the missing third letter must be a consonant that isn't S, E, D. Common consonants left include N, T, M, C, etc.

Possible words fitting A R _ O R:
- ARBOR (but B hasn't been ruled out yet)
- ARGOR (but G hasn't been ruled out yet)
- ARGOR (but G and the second R already present)
- ARBOR seems valid, but let's check if it fits all constraints.

Actually, looking at the pattern A R _ O R, the third letter must be a single letter, so possible words are:
- ARBOR (B is possible)
- ARGOR (G is possible)
- ARHOR (H is possible, but not common)
- ARJOR (J is possible, but not common)

The most common and valid word here is ""ARBOR"".

- A R B O R: A(✓) R(✓) B(?) O(✓) R(✓). B hasn't been ruled out, so this is valid.
