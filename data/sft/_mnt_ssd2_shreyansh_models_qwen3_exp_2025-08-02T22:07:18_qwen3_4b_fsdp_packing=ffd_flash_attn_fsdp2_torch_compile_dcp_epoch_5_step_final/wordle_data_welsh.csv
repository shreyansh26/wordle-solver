For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word, providing useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- S is in the correct position (5th letter).

- A, R, O are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ _ _ S
- E is somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.
- Cannot use A, R, O.

I need a new 5-letter word that ends in S, contains E, and avoids A, R, O. Let me think of a word that fits these constraints and uses common remaining letters. ""THEES"" comes to mind - it ends in S, has E, and doesn't use A, R, or O. However, T and H are still possibilities. Another option could be ""LEDES"" but that uses E twice which might not be optimal. ""THEES"" seems better as it tests T, H, and positions E.

But wait, ""THEES"" has E in position 4, which is allowed since E can't be in position 2. However, I want to test a word that might reveal more consonants. ""LIMES"" ends in S, has E, and avoids A, R, O. It tests L, I, M, E, S. This seems like a strong next guess.

Let's digest the new feedback from LIMES:

- L is in the word but not in position 1.
- I and M are NOT in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 4.
- S is confirmed in position 5.

So far we know:
- Word ends in S (position 5).
- E is somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since 4 and 2 are ruled out for E so far).
- L is somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4.
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, I, M.

We need a 5-letter word ending in S that:
- Contains E and L in allowed positions.
- Avoids A, R, O, I, M.

Let's think of possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Good candidates:
- E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- L must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

Possible patterns:
- E _ _ _ S
- _ E _ _ S
- _ _ E _ S
- _ _ _ E S (but E can't be in position 4 from LIMES feedback, so this is invalid)
- _ L _ _ S (L in position 2)
- L _ _ _ S (L in position 1 - but L can't be in position 1 from AROSE feedback, so this is invalid)
- _ _ L _ S (L in position 3)
- _ _ _ L S (L in position 4)

So valid patterns:
1. E _ _ _ S
2. _ E _ _ S
3. _ _ E _ S
4. _ _ _ L S

Let's think of words fitting these patterns, avoiding forbidden letters.

Option 1: E _ _ _ S
- E and S are fixed. Need three consonants in positions 2,3,4, avoiding forbidden letters.
- Example: E D U L S - but U is allowed, L is allowed. However, this might not be a valid word.

Option 2: _ E _ _ S
- E in position 2. Need consonants in 1,3,4.
- Example: T E N E S - but N and E are allowed? Wait, E is allowed in position 2? From feedback, E can be in positions 1,2,3 (since it was in position 4 and marked wrong). So this is allowed.

Option 3: _ _ E _ S
- E in position 3. Need consonants in 1,2,4.
- Example: T H E E S - but E is repeated and E can't be in position 4.

Option 4: _ _ _ L S
- L in position 4. Need consonants in 1,2,3.
- Example: T H R L S - but R is forbidden.

Let me think of valid words:
- ""T E N E S"" - but E is in position 4 which is forbidden.
- ""P E N E S"" - same issue.
- ""T E L L S"" - L is in position 3 and 4, but E is in position 2 - this seems possible.
  - Check letters: T, E, L, L, S.
  - Forbidden letters: A, R, O, I, M - none of these are present.
  - Positions: S is in 5 (correct), E is in 2 (allowed), L is in 3 and 4 (but feedback says L is in word but not position 1 - this is okay since it's in 3 and 4).

However, ""Tells"" might not be the best as it repeats L.

Another word: ""C L E A N S"" - but this is 6 letters.

Wait, let's think of words ending in S with E and L in allowed positions.

""J E L L S"" - J, E, L, L, S.
- Forbidden letters: none of A, R, O, I, M are present.
- Positions: S in 5 (correct), E in 2 (allowed), L in 3 and 4 (allowed).

This seems valid.

""JELLS"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Let me go with this as it tests J, E, L, L, S.

But wait, we might want to test new consonants. ""T E L L S"" is also valid.

Between ""JELLS"" and ""Tells"", ""Tells"" uses more common letters (T, E, L, S).

Let's go with ""Tells"".

From the combined feedback:
- S is locked in position 5.
- E must appear in positions 1, 2, or 3 (not 4, and not 2 from LIMES).
- L must appear somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4 (not 1).
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, I, M.

A good next guess is ""Tells"" which:

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word, providing useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

- S is in the correct position (5th letter).
- E is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- A, R, O are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ _ _ S
- E is somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.
- Cannot use A, R, O.

I need a new 5-letter word that ends in S, contains E, and avoids A, R, O. Let me think of a word that fits these constraints and uses common remaining letters. ""THEES"" comes to mind - it ends in S, has E, and doesn't use A, R, or O. However, T and H are still possibilities. Another option could be ""LEDES"" but that uses E twice which might not be optimal. ""THEES"" seems better as it tests T, H, and positions E.

But wait, ""THEES"" has E in position 4, which is allowed since E can't be in position 2. However, I want to test a word that might reveal more consonants. ""LIMES"" ends in S, has E, and avoids A, R, O. It tests L, I, M, E, S. This seems like a strong next guess.

Let me go with ""LIMES"".

Let's digest the new feedback from LIMES:

- L is in the word but not in position 1.
- I and M are NOT in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 4.
- S is confirmed in position 5.

So far we know:
- Word ends in S (position 5).
- E is somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since 4 and 2 are ruled out for E so far).
- L is somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4.
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, I, M.

We need a 5-letter word ending in S that:
- Contains E and L in allowed positions.
- Avoids A, R, O, I, M.

Let's think of possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Good candidates:
- E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- L must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

Possible patterns:
- E _ _ _ S
- _ E _ _ S
- _ _ E _ S
- _ _ _ E S (but E can't be in position 4 from LIMES feedback, so this is invalid)
- _ L _ _ S (L in position 2)
- L _ _ _ S (L in position 1 - but L can't be in position 1 from AROSE feedback, so this is invalid)
- _ _ L _ S (L in position 3)
- _ _ _ L S (L in position 4)

So valid patterns:
1. E _ _ _ S
2. _ E _ _ S
3. _ _ E _ S
4. _ _ _ L S

Let's think of words fitting these patterns, avoiding forbidden letters.

Option 1: E _ _ _ S
- E and S are fixed. Need three consonants in positions 2,3,4, avoiding forbidden letters.
- Example: E D U L S - but U is allowed, L is allowed. However, this might not be a valid word.

Option 2: _ E _ _ S
- E in position 2. Need consonants in 1,3,4.
- Example: T E N E S - but N and E are allowed? Wait, E is allowed in position 2? From feedback, E can be in positions 1,2,3 (since it was in position 4 and marked wrong). So this is allowed.

Option 3: _ _ E _ S
- E in position 3. Need consonants in 1,2,4.
- Example: T H E E S - but E is repeated and E can't be in position 4.

Option 4: _ _ _ L S
- L in position 4. Need consonants in 1,2,3.
- Example: T H R L S - but R is forbidden.

Let me think of valid words:
- ""T E N E S"" - but E is in position 4 which is forbidden.
- ""P E N E S"" - same issue.
- ""T E L L S"" - L is in position 3 and 4, but E is in position 2 - this seems possible.
  - Check letters: T, E, L, L, S.
  - Forbidden letters: A, R, O, I, M - none of these are present.
  - Positions: S is in 5 (correct), E is in 2 (allowed), L is in 3 and 4 (but feedback says L is in word but not position 1 - this is okay since it's in 3 and 4).

However, ""Tells"" might not be the best as it repeats L.

Another word: ""C L E A N S"" - but this is 6 letters.

Wait, let's think of words ending in S with E and L in allowed positions.

""J E L L S"" - J, E, L, L, S.
- Forbidden letters: none of A, R, O, I, M are present.
- Positions: S in 5 (correct), E in 2 (allowed), L in 3 and 4 (allowed).

This seems valid.

""JELLS"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Let me go with this as it tests J, E, L, L, S.

But wait, we might want to test new consonants. ""T E L L S"" is also valid.

Between ""JELLS"" and ""Tells"", ""Tells"" uses more common letters (T, E, L, S).

Let's go with ""Tells"".From the combined feedback:
- S is locked in position 5.
- E must appear in positions 1, 2, or 3 (not 4, and not 2 from LIMES).
- L must appear somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4 (not 1).
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, I, M.

A good next guess is ""Tells"" which:
- Ends in S (position 5 ✓).
- Contains E in position 2 (allowed).
- Contains L in positions 3 and 4 (allowed).
- Uses only permitted letters (T, E, L, S).

Current known pattern:
- Position 1: unknown, must be a consonant not yet ruled out.
- Position 2: E (✓).
- Position 3: L (✓).
- Position 4: not L, and must be a consonant not yet ruled out.
- Position 5: S (✓).

Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, I, M, T.
Allowed letters for positions 1 and 4: any consonant not in the forbidden list.

We need a 5-letter word matching: _ E L _ S, where the first and fourth letters are consonants not yet ruled out.

Possible valid words:
- ""B"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""D"" + ""S"" → ""BELDS"" (invalid, not a real word).
- ""C"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""D"" + ""S"" → ""CELDS"" (invalid).
- ""F"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""D"" + ""S"" → ""FELDS"" (invalid).
- ""G"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""D"" + ""S"" → ""GELDS"" (invalid).
- ""H"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""D"" + ""S"" → ""HELDS"" (valid word!).

""HELDS"" fits the pattern:
- H is not yet ruled out.
- E is in position 2 (✓).
- L is in position 3 (✓).
- D is not yet ruled out.
- S is in position 5 (✓).

Step-by-step deduction:

1. From Guess 1 (AROSE):
   - S is fixed in position 5 (✓).
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).

2. From Guess 2 (LIMES):
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 1 (-).
   - I, M are out (x).
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-).

3. From Guess 3 (Tells):
   - T is out (x).
   - E is confirmed in position 2 (✓).
   - L is confirmed in position 3 (✓).
   - L in position 4 is wrong (-).

4. From Guess 4 (HELDS):
   - H is in the word but NOT in position 1 (-).
   - E is confirmed in position 2 (✓).
   - L is confirmed in position 3 (✓).
   - D is out (x).
   - S is confirmed in position 5 (✓).

Current known pattern:
- Position 1: not A, R, O, I, M, T, D, H (H is in word but wrong position).
- Position 2: E (✓).
- Position 3: L (✓).
- Position 4: not L, I, M, D, and must be a consonant.
- Position 5: S (✓).

Forbidden letters: A, R, O, I, M, T, D.
Allowed letters for positions 1 and 4: any consonant not in the forbidden list, and position 1 cannot be H (since H was marked ""-"" in position 1).

We need a 5-letter word matching: _ E L _ S, where:
- First letter: consonant not in forbidden list and not H.
- Fourth letter: consonant not in forbidden list and not L.

Possible valid words:
- ""F"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""S"" + ""S"" → ""FELSS"" (invalid).
- ""B"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""S"" + ""S"" → ""BELSS"" (invalid).
- ""C"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""S"" + ""S"" → ""CELSS"" (invalid).
- ""G"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""S"" + ""S"" → ""GELSS"" (invalid).
- ""N"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""S"" + ""S"" → ""NELSS"" (invalid).
- ""P"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""S"" + ""S"" → ""PELSS"" (invalid).
- ""K"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""S"" + ""S"" → ""KELSS"" (invalid).
- ""V"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""S"" + ""S"" → ""VELSS"" (invalid).
- ""W"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""S"" + ""S"" → ""WELSS"" (invalid).
- ""Y"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""S"" + ""S"" → ""YELSS"" (invalid).
- ""Z"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""S"" + ""S"" → ""ZELSS"" (invalid).

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Let me reconsider the fourth position. The fourth letter does not have to be S; it just can't be L, I, M, D, or any forbidden letter. The word must be a valid English word ending in S with the pattern _ E L _ S.

Valid words fitting _ E L _ S:
- ""FELAS"" - but A is forbidden.
- ""GELAS"" - A is forbidden.
- ""NELAS"" - A is forbidden.
- ""VELAS"" - A is forbidden.
- ""YELAS"" - A is forbidden.
- ""BELAS"" - A is forbidden.
- ""CELAS"" - A is forbidden.
- ""FELIS"" - I is forbidden.
- ""GELIS"" - I is forbidden.
- ""NELIS"" - I is forbidden.
- ""VELIS"" - I is forbidden.
- ""YELIS"" - I is forbidden.
- ""FELMS"" - M is forbidden.
- ""GELMS"" - M is forbidden.
- ""NELMS"" - M is forbidden.
- ""VELMS"" - M is forbidden.
- ""YELMS"" - M is forbidden.

This is tricky. Let me think of other consonants for position 4. The fourth letter could be J, K, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Possible words:
- ""B"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""J"" + ""S"" → ""BELJS"" (invalid).
- ""C"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""J"" + ""S"" → ""CELJS"" (invalid).
- ""F"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""J"" + ""S"" → ""FELJS"" (invalid).
- ""G"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""J"" + ""S"" → ""GELJS"" (invalid).
- ""K"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""J"" + ""S"" → ""KELJS"" (invalid).
- ""N"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""J"" + ""S"" → ""NELJS"" (invalid).
- ""P"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""J"" + ""S"" → ""PELJS"" (invalid).
- ""V"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""J"" + ""S"" → ""VELJS"" (invalid).
- ""W"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""J"" + ""S"" → ""WELJS"" (invalid).
- ""Y"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""J"" + ""S"" → ""YELJS"" (invalid).

This path isn't yielding valid words. Let me reconsider the first letter. The first letter must be a consonant not in the forbidden list and not H (since H was ""-"" in position 1). Possible first letters: B, C, F, G, J, K, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Let me try ""B"" as the first letter and see what the fourth letter needs to be for a valid word:
- ""B"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""?"" + ""S"" → ""BEL?S"".
  - Valid word: ""BELLS"" - but this has two L's, and we know L is already in position 3, so position 4 would be L, but L cannot be in position 4 (from Guess 2 and 3). So ""BELLS"" is invalid.

Next, ""C"" as first letter:
- ""CEL?S"" - ""CELTS"" (T is forbidden), ""CELLS"" (L is forbidden in position 4), ""CELSI"" (I is forbidden), etc. None valid.

""F"" as first letter:
- ""FEL?S"" - ""FELTS"" (T is forbidden), ""FELLS"" (L in position 4 is forbidden).

""G"" as first letter:
- ""GEL?S"" - ""GELDS"" (D is forbidden), ""GELLS"" (L in position 4 forbidden).

""J"" as first letter:
- ""JEL?S"" - ""JELLS"" (L in position 4 forbidden).

""K"" as first letter:
- ""KEL?S"" - ""KELLS"" (L in position 4 forbidden).

""N"" as first letter:
- ""NEL?S"" - ""NELDS"" (D is forbidden), ""NELLS"" (L in position 4 forbidden).

""P"" as first letter:
- ""PEL?S"" - ""PELTS"" (T is forbidden), ""PELLS"" (L in position 4 forbidden).

""V"" as first letter:
- ""VEL?S"" - ""VELTS"" (T is forbidden), ""VELLS"" (L in position 4 forbidden).

""W"" as first letter:
- ""WEL?S"" - ""WELTS"" (T is forbidden), ""WELLS"" (L in position 4 forbidden).

""Y"" as first letter:
- ""YEL?S"" - ""YELTS"" (T is forbidden), ""YELLS"" (L in position 4 forbidden).

""Z"" as first letter:
- ""ZEL?S"" - ""ZELTS"" (T is forbidden), ""ZELLS"" (L in position 4 forbidden).

This is perplexing. None of the obvious words seem to fit. Let me think of less common words or perhaps a different approach.

Wait, the fourth letter could be U or another vowel not yet ruled out. From Guess 1, E is in position 2, so other vowels might still be possible. However, we've ruled out A, O, I, and E is already used in position 2. The only remaining vowels are U and Y.

Let me try:
- ""B"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""U"" + ""S"" → ""BELUS"" (invalid).
- ""C"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""U"" + ""S"" → ""CELUS"" (invalid).
- ""F"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""U"" + ""S"" → ""FELUS"" (invalid).
- ""G"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""U"" + ""S"" → ""GELUS"" (invalid).
- ""K"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""U"" + ""S"" → ""KELUS"" (invalid).
- ""N"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""U"" + ""S"" → ""NELUS"" (invalid).
- ""P"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""U"" + ""S"" → ""PELUS"" (invalid).
- ""V"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""U"" + ""S"" → ""VELUS"" (invalid).
- ""W"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""U"" + ""S"" → ""WELUS"" (invalid).
- ""Y"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""U"" + ""S"" → ""YELUS"" (invalid).

None of these are valid. Let me try ""Y"" as the fourth letter:
- ""B"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""Y"" + ""S"" → ""BELYS"" (invalid).
- ""C"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""Y"" + ""S"" → ""CELYS"" (invalid).
- ""F"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""Y"" + ""S"" → ""FELYS"" (invalid).
- ""G"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""Y"" + ""S"" → ""GELYS"" (invalid).
- ""K"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""Y"" + ""S"" → ""KELYS"" (invalid).
- ""N"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""Y"" + ""S"" → ""NELYS"" (invalid).
- ""P"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""Y"" + ""S"" → ""PELYS"" (invalid).
- ""V"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""Y"" + ""S"" → ""VELYS"" (invalid).
- ""W"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""Y"" + ""S"" → ""WELYS"" (invalid).

This is extremely restrictive. Let me reconsider the first letter. Perhaps the first letter is ""F"" and the fourth letter is ""K"":
- ""F"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""K"" + ""S"" → ""FELKS"" (invalid).

Alternatively, ""F"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""V"" + ""S"" → ""FELVS"" (invalid).

This path seems impossible. Let me re-examine the feedback to ensure I haven't misread anything.

From Guess 4 (HELDS):
- H is in the word but NOT in position 1 (-).
- E is confirmed in position 2 (✓).
- L is confirmed in position 3 (✓).
- D is out (x).
- S is confirmed in position 5 (✓).

Thus, the word must be of the form: [consonant not in forbidden list, and not H in position 1] E L [consonant not in forbidden list, and not L] S.

Forbidden letters: A, R, O, I, M, T, D.

Possible first letters: B, C, F, G, J, K, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (excluding H).

Possible fourth letters: any consonant not in forbidden list and not L.

Let me try ""B"" as first letter and ""K"" as fourth letter:
- ""B"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""K"" + ""S"" → ""BELKS"" (invalid).

""B"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""V"" + ""S"" → ""BELVS"" (invalid).

""F"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""V"" + ""S"" → ""FELVS"" (invalid).

""G"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""V"" + ""S"" → ""GELVS"" (invalid).

""N"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""V"" + ""S"" → ""NELVS"" (invalid).

""P"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""V"" + ""S"" → ""PELVS"" (invalid).

""V"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""V"" + ""S"" → ""VELVS"" (invalid).

""W"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""V"" + ""S"" → ""WELVS"" (invalid).

""Z"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""V"" + ""S"" → ""ZELVS"" (invalid).

This is not working. Let me try ""K"" as first letter:
- ""K"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""V"" + ""S"" → ""KELVS"" (invalid).

""K"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""N"" + ""S"" → ""KELNS"" (invalid).

""K"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""B"" + ""S"" → ""KELBS"" (invalid).

This seems impossible. Let me try ""F"" as first letter and ""K"" as fourth:
- ""F"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""K"" + ""S"" → ""FELKS"" (invalid).

""F"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""N"" + ""S"" → ""FELNS"" (invalid).

""F"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""V"" + ""S"" → ""FELVS"" (invalid).

""F"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""W"" + ""S"" → ""FELWS"" (invalid).

""F"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""Z"" + ""S"" → ""FELZS"" (invalid).

This is extremely restrictive. The only valid word I can think of that fits is ""FELLS"", but L in position 4 is forbidden. 

Wait, let me check if ""BELLS"" could be valid despite the L in position 4. From Guess 2 (LIMES), L is in the word but NOT in position 1 (-). From Guess 3 (Tells), L is confirmed in position 3 (✓). From Guess 4 (HELDS), H is in the word but NOT in position 1 (-). So L can be in position 3 and potentially position 4 as long as it's not position 1. However, ""BELLS"" has L in position 3 and 4, which would be allowed since L is confirmed in position 3 and the feedback only said L is in the word (not necessarily only once). 

But ""BELLS"" has two L's, and we have no information preventing that. However, ""BELLS"" is a valid word.

Let me verify:
- B: not forbidden.
- E: in position 2 (✓).
- L: in position 3 (✓), and also position 4 (allowed since L is confirmed in position 3 and can appear elsewhere).
- L: same.
- S: in position 5 (✓).

This seems to fit all feedback.

- ""C"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""S"" + ""S"" → ""CELSS"" (invalid).
- ""G"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""S"" + ""S"" → ""GELSS"" (invalid).

- ""Y"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""S"" + ""S"" → ""YELSS"" (invalid).
- ""Z"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""S"" + ""S"" → ""ZELSS"" (invalid).

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Let me reconsider the fourth position. The fourth letter does not have to be S; it just can't be L, I, M, D, or any forbidden letter. The word must be a valid English word ending in S with the pattern _ E L _ S.

Valid words fitting _ E L _ S:
- ""FELAS"" - but A is forbidden.
- ""GELAS"" - A is forbidden.
- ""NELAS"" - A is forbidden.
- ""VELAS"" - A is forbidden.
- ""YELAS"" - A is forbidden.
- ""BELAS"" - A is forbidden.
- ""CELAS"" - A is forbidden.
- ""FELIS"" - I is forbidden.
- ""GELIS"" - I is forbidden.
- ""NELIS"" - I is forbidden.
- ""VELIS"" - I is forbidden.
- ""YELIS"" - I is forbidden.
- ""FELMS"" - M is forbidden.
- ""GELMS"" - M is forbidden.
- ""NELMS"" - M is forbidden.
- ""VELMS"" - M is forbidden.
- ""YELMS"" - M is forbidden.

This is tricky. Let me think of other consonants for position 4. The fourth letter could be J, K, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Possible words:
- ""B"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""J"" + ""S"" → ""BELJS"" (invalid).
- ""C"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""J"" + ""S"" → ""CELJS"" (invalid).
- ""F"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""J"" + ""S"" → ""FELJS"" (invalid).
- ""G"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""J"" + ""S"" → ""GELJS"" (invalid).
- ""K"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""J"" + ""S"" → ""KELJS"" (invalid).
- ""N"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""J"" + ""S"" → ""NELJS"" (invalid).
- ""P"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""J"" + ""S"" → ""PELJS"" (invalid).
- ""V"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""J"" + ""S"" → ""VELJS"" (invalid).
- ""W"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""J"" + ""S"" → ""WELJS"" (invalid).
- ""Y"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""J"" + ""S"" → ""YELJS"" (invalid).

This path isn't yielding valid words. Let me reconsider the first letter. The first letter must be a consonant not in the forbidden list and not H (since H was ""-"" in position 1). Possible first letters: B, C, F, G, J, K, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Let me try ""B"" as the first letter and see what the fourth letter needs to be for a valid word:
- ""B"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""?"" + ""S"" → ""BEL?S"".
  - Valid word: ""BELLS"" - but this has two L's, and we know L is already in position 3, so position 4 would be L, but L cannot be in position 4 (from Guess 2 and 3). So ""BELLS"" is invalid.

Next, ""C"" as first letter:
- ""CEL?S"" - ""CELTS"" (T is forbidden), ""CELLS"" (L is forbidden in position 4), ""CELSI"" (I is forbidden), etc. None valid.

""F"" as first letter:
- ""FEL?S"" - ""FELTS"" (T is forbidden), ""FELLS"" (L in position 4 is forbidden).

""G"" as first letter:
- ""GEL?S"" - ""GELDS"" (D is forbidden), ""GELLS"" (L in position 4 forbidden).

""J"" as first letter:
- ""JEL?S"" - ""JELLS"" (L in position 4 forbidden).

""K"" as first letter:
- ""KEL?S"" - ""KELLS"" (L in position 4 forbidden).

""N"" as first letter:
- ""NEL?S"" - ""NELDS"" (D is forbidden), ""NELLS"" (L in position 4 forbidden).

""P"" as first letter:
- ""PEL?S"" - ""PELTS"" (T is forbidden), ""PELLS"" (L in position 4 forbidden).

""V"" as first letter:
- ""VEL?S"" - ""VELTS"" (T is forbidden), ""VELLS"" (L in position 4 forbidden).

""W"" as first letter:
- ""WEL?S"" - ""WELTS"" (T is forbidden), ""WELLS"" (L in position 4 forbidden).

""Y"" as first letter:
- ""YEL?S"" - ""YELTS"" (T is forbidden), ""YELLS"" (L in position 4 forbidden).

""Z"" as first letter:
- ""ZEL?S"" - ""ZELTS"" (T is forbidden), ""ZELLS"" (L in position 4 forbidden).

This is perplexing. None of the obvious words seem to fit. Let me think of less common words or perhaps a different approach.

Wait, the fourth letter could be U or another vowel not yet ruled out. From Guess 1, E is in position 2, so other vowels might still be possible. However, we've ruled out A, O, I, and E is already used in position 2. The only remaining vowels are U and Y.

Let me try:
- ""B"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""U"" + ""S"" → ""BELUS"" (invalid).
- ""C"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""U"" + ""S"" → ""CELUS"" (invalid).
- ""F"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""U"" + ""S"" → ""FELUS"" (invalid).
- ""G"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""U"" + ""S"" → ""GELUS"" (invalid).
- ""K"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""U"" + ""S"" → ""KELUS"" (invalid).
- ""N"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""U"" + ""S"" → ""NELUS"" (invalid).
- ""P"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""U"" + ""S"" → ""PELUS"" (invalid).
- ""V"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""U"" + ""S"" → ""VELUS"" (invalid).
- ""W"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""U"" + ""S"" → ""WELUS"" (invalid).
- ""Y"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""U"" + ""S"" → ""YELUS"" (invalid).

None of these are valid. Let me try ""Y"" as the fourth letter:
- ""B"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""Y"" + ""S"" → ""BELYS"" (invalid).
- ""C"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""Y"" + ""S"" → ""CELYS"" (invalid).
- ""F"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""Y"" + ""S"" → ""FELYS"" (invalid).
- ""G"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""Y"" + ""S"" → ""GELYS"" (invalid).
- ""K"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""Y"" + ""S"" → ""KELYS"" (invalid).
- ""N"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""Y"" + ""S"" → ""NELYS"" (invalid).
- ""P"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""Y"" + ""S"" → ""PELYS"" (invalid).
- ""V"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""Y"" + ""S"" → ""VELYS"" (invalid).
- ""W"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""Y"" + ""S"" → ""WELYS"" (invalid).

This is extremely restrictive. Let me reconsider the first letter. Perhaps the first letter is ""F"" and the fourth letter is ""K"":
- ""F"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""K"" + ""S"" → ""FELKS"" (invalid).

Alternatively, ""F"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""V"" + ""S"" → ""FELVS"" (invalid).

This path seems impossible. Let me re-examine the feedback to ensure I haven't misread anything.

From Guess 4 (HELDS):
- H is in the word but NOT in position 1 (-).
- E is confirmed in position 2 (✓).
- L is confirmed in position 3 (✓).
- D is out (x).
- S is confirmed in position 5 (✓).

Thus, the word must be of the form: [consonant not in forbidden list, and not H in position 1] E L [consonant not in forbidden list, and not L] S.

Forbidden letters: A, R, O, I, M, T, D.

Possible first letters: B, C, F, G, J, K, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (excluding H).

Possible fourth letters: any consonant not in forbidden list and not L.

Let me try ""B"" as first letter and ""K"" as fourth letter:
- ""B"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""K"" + ""S"" → ""BELKS"" (invalid).

""B"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""V"" + ""S"" → ""BELVS"" (invalid).

""F"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""V"" + ""S"" → ""FELVS"" (invalid).

""G"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""V"" + ""S"" → ""GELVS"" (invalid).

""N"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""V"" + ""S"" → ""NELVS"" (invalid).

""P"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""V"" + ""S"" → ""PELVS"" (invalid).

""V"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""V"" + ""S"" → ""VELVS"" (invalid).

""W"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""V"" + ""S"" → ""WELVS"" (invalid).

""Z"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""V"" + ""S"" → ""ZELVS"" (invalid).

This is not working. Let me try ""K"" as first letter:
- ""K"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""V"" + ""S"" → ""KELVS"" (invalid).

""K"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""N"" + ""S"" → ""KELNS"" (invalid).

""K"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""B"" + ""S"" → ""KELBS"" (invalid).

This seems impossible. Let me try ""F"" as first letter and ""K"" as fourth:
- ""F"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""K"" + ""S"" → ""FELKS"" (invalid).

""F"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""N"" + ""S"" → ""FELNS"" (invalid).

""F"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""V"" + ""S"" → ""FELVS"" (invalid).

""F"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""W"" + ""S"" → ""FELWS"" (invalid).

""F"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""Z"" + ""S"" → ""FELZS"" (invalid).

This is extremely restrictive. The only valid word I can think of that fits is ""FELLS"", but L in position 4 is forbidden. 

Wait, let me check if ""BELLS"" could be valid despite the L in position 4. From Guess 2 (LIMES), L is in the word but NOT in position 1 (-). From Guess 3 (Tells), L is confirmed in position 3 (✓). From Guess 4 (HELDS), H is in the word but NOT in position 1 (-). So L can be in position 3 and potentially position 4 as long as it's not position 1. However, ""BELLS"" has L in position 3 and 4, which would be allowed since L is confirmed in position 3 and the feedback only said L is in the word (not necessarily only once). 

But ""BELLS"" has two L's, and we have no information preventing that. However, ""BELLS"" is a valid word.

Let me verify:
- B: not forbidden.
- E: in position 2 (✓).
- L: in position 3 (✓), and also position 4 (allowed since L is confirmed in position 3 and can appear elsewhere).
- L: same.
- S: in position 5 (✓).

This seems to fit all feedback.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word, providing useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- S is in the correct position (5th letter).
- E is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- A, R, O are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ _ _ S
- E is somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.
- Cannot use A, R, O.

I need a new 5-letter word that ends in S, contains E, and avoids A, R, O. Let me think of a word that fits these constraints and uses common remaining letters. ""THEES"" comes to mind - it ends in S, has E, and doesn't use A, R, or O. However, T and H are still possibilities. Another option could be ""LEDES"" but that uses E twice which might not be optimal. ""THEES"" seems better as it tests T, H, and positions E.

But wait, ""THEES"" has E in position 4, which is allowed since E can't be in position 2. However, I want to test a word that might reveal more consonants. ""LIMES"" ends in S, has E, and avoids A, R, O. It tests L, I, M, E, S. This seems like a strong next guess.

Let me go with ""LIMES"".

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: LIMES -> FEEDBACK: L(-) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's digest the new feedback from LIMES:

- L is in the word but not in position 1.
- I and M are NOT in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 4.
- S is confirmed in position 5.

So far we know:
- Word ends in S (position 5).
- E is somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since 4 and 2 are ruled out for E so far).
- L is somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4.
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, I, M.

We need a 5-letter word ending in S that:
- Contains E and L in allowed positions.
- Avoids A, R, O, I, M.

Let's think of possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Good candidates:
- E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- L must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

Possible patterns:
- E _ _ _ S
- _ E _ _ S
- _ _ E _ S
- _ _ _ E S (but E can't be in position 4 from LIMES feedback, so this is invalid)
- _ L _ _ S (L in position 2)
- L _ _ _ S (L in position 1 - but L can't be in position 1 from AROSE feedback, so this is invalid)
- _ _ L _ S (L in position 3)
- _ _ _ L S (L in position 4)

So valid patterns:
1. E _ _ _ S
2. _ E _ _ S
3. _ _ E _ S
4. _ _ _ L S

Let's think of words fitting these patterns, avoiding forbidden letters.

Option 1: E _ _ _ S
- E and S are fixed. Need three consonants in positions 2,3,4, avoiding forbidden letters.
- Example: E D U L S - but U is allowed, L is allowed. However, this might not be a valid word.

Option 2: _ E _ _ S
- E in position 2. Need consonants in 1,3,4.
- Example: T E N E S - but N and E are allowed? Wait, E is allowed in position 2? From feedback, E can be in positions 1,2,3 (since it was in position 4 and marked wrong). So this is allowed.

Option 3: _ _ E _ S
- E in position 3. Need consonants in 1,2,4.
- Example: T H E E S - but E is repeated and E can't be in position 4.

Option 4: _ _ _ L S
- L in position 4. Need consonants in 1,2,3.
- Example: T H R L S - but R is forbidden.

Let me think of valid words:
- ""T E N E S"" - but E is in position 4 which is forbidden.
- ""P E N E S"" - same issue.
- ""T E L L S"" - L is in position 3 and 4, but E is in position 2 - this seems possible.
  - Check letters: T, E, L, L, S.
  - Forbidden letters: A, R, O, I, M - none of these are present.
  - Positions: S is in 5 (correct), E is in 2 (allowed), L is in 3 and 4 (but feedback says L is in word but not position 1 - this is okay since it's in 3 and 4).

However, ""Tells"" might not be the best as it repeats L.

Another word: ""C L E A N S"" - but this is 6 letters.

Wait, let's think of words ending in S with E and L in allowed positions.

""J E L L S"" - J, E, L, L, S.
- Forbidden letters: none of A, R, O, I, M are present.
- Positions: S in 5 (correct), E in 2 (allowed), L in 3 and 4 (allowed).

This seems valid.

""JELLS"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Let me go with this as it tests J, E, L, L, S.

But wait, we might want to test new consonants. ""T E L L S"" is also valid.

Between ""JELLS"" and ""Tells"", ""Tells"" uses more common letters (T, E, L, S).

Let's go with ""Tells"".From the combined feedback:
- S is locked in position 5.
- E must appear in positions 1, 2, or 3 (not 4, and not 2 from LIMES).
- L must appear somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4 (not 1).
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, I, M.

A good next guess is ""Tells"" which:
- Ends in S (position 5 ✓).
- Contains E in position 2 (allowed).
- Contains L in positions 3 and 4 (allowed).
- Uses only permitted letters (T, E, L, S).

Step-by-step deduction:

1. From Guess 1 (AROSE):
   - S is fixed in position 5 (✓).
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).

2. From Guess 2 (LIMES):
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 1 (-).
   - I, M are out (x).
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-).

3. From Guess 3 (Tells):
   - T is out (x).
   - E is now confirmed in position 2 (✓).
   - L is confirmed in position 3 (✓).
   - L in position 4 is wrong (-).
   - S in position 5 is already confirmed.

Current known pattern:
- Position 1: unknown, must be a consonant not yet ruled out.
- Position 2: E (✓).
- Position 3: L (✓).
- Position 4: not L, and must be a consonant not yet ruled out.
- Position 5: S (✓).

Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, I, M, T.
Allowed letters for positions 1 and 4: any consonant not in the forbidden list.

We need a 5-letter word matching: _ E L _ S, where the first and fourth letters are consonants not yet ruled out.

Possible valid words:
- ""B"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""D"" + ""S"" → ""BELDS"" (invalid, not a real word).
- ""C"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""D"" + ""S"" → ""CELDS"" (invalid).
- ""F"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""D"" + ""S"" → ""FELDS"" (invalid).
- ""G"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""D"" + ""S"" → ""GELDS"" (invalid).
- ""H"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""D"" + ""S"" → ""HELDS"" (valid word!).

""HELDS"" fits the pattern:
- H is not yet ruled out.
- E is in position 2 (✓).
- L is in position 3 (✓).
- D is not yet ruled out.
- S is in position 5 (✓).

No conflicts with previous feedback.

Forbidden letters: A, R, O, I, M, T, D.
Allowed letters for positions 1 and 4: any consonant not in the forbidden list, and position 1 cannot be H (since H was marked ""-"" in position 1).

We need a 5-letter word matching: _ E L _ S, where:
- First letter: consonant not in forbidden list and not H.
- Fourth letter: consonant not in forbidden list and not L.

Possible valid words:
- ""F"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""S"" + ""S"" → ""FELSS"" (invalid).
- ""B"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""S"" + ""S"" → ""BELSS"" (invalid).

- ""Y"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""S"" + ""S"" → ""YELSS"" (invalid).
- ""Z"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""S"" + ""S"" → ""ZELSS"" (invalid).

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Let me reconsider the fourth position. The fourth letter does not have to be S; it just can't be L, I, M, D, or any forbidden letter. The word must be a valid English word ending in S with the pattern _ E L _ S.

Valid words fitting _ E L _ S:
- ""FELAS"" - but A is forbidden.
- ""GELAS"" - A is forbidden.
- ""NELAS"" - A is forbidden.
- ""VELAS"" - A is forbidden.
- ""YELAS"" - A is forbidden.
- ""BELAS"" - A is forbidden.
- ""CELAS"" - A is forbidden.
- ""FELIS"" - I is forbidden.
- ""GELIS"" - I is forbidden.
- ""NELIS"" - I is forbidden.
- ""VELIS"" - I is forbidden.
- ""YELIS"" - I is forbidden.
- ""FELMS"" - M is forbidden.
- ""GELMS"" - M is forbidden.
- ""NELMS"" - M is forbidden.
- ""VELMS"" - M is forbidden.
- ""YELMS"" - M is forbidden.

This is tricky. Let me think of other consonants for position 4. The fourth letter could be J, K, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Possible words:
- ""B"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""J"" + ""S"" → ""BELJS"" (invalid).
- ""C"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""J"" + ""S"" → ""CELJS"" (invalid).

This path isn't yielding valid words. Let me reconsider the first letter. The first letter must be a consonant not in the forbidden list and not H (since H was ""-"" in position 1). Possible first letters: B, C, F, G, J, K, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Let me try ""B"" as the first letter and see what the fourth letter needs to be for a valid word:
- ""B"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""?"" + ""S"" → ""BEL?S"".
  - Valid word: ""BELLS"" - but this has two L's, and we know L is already in position 3, so position 4 would be L, but L cannot be in position 4 (from Guess 2 and 3). So ""BELLS"" is invalid.

Next, ""C"" as first letter:
- ""CEL?S"" - ""CELTS"" (T is forbidden), ""CELLS"" (L is forbidden in position 4), ""CELSI"" (I is forbidden), etc. None valid.

""F"" as first letter:
- ""FEL?S"" - ""FELTS"" (T is forbidden), ""FELLS"" (L in position 4 is forbidden).

""G"" as first letter:
- ""GEL?S"" - ""GELDS"" (D is forbidden), ""GELLS"" (L in position 4 forbidden).

""J"" as first letter:
- ""JEL?S"" - ""JELLS"" (L in position 4 forbidden).

""K"" as first letter:
- ""KEL?S"" - ""KELLS"" (L in position 4 forbidden).

""N"" as first letter:
- ""NEL?S"" - ""NELDS"" (D is forbidden), ""NELLS"" (L in position 4 forbidden).

""P"" as first letter:
- ""PEL?S"" - ""PELTS"" (T is forbidden), ""PELLS"" (L in position 4 forbidden).

""V"" as first letter:
- ""VEL?S"" - ""VELTS"" (T is forbidden), ""VELLS"" (L in position 4 forbidden).

""W"" as first letter:
- ""WEL?S"" - ""WELTS"" (T is forbidden), ""WELLS"" (L in position 4 forbidden).

""Y"" as first letter:
- ""YEL?S"" - ""YELTS"" (T is forbidden), ""YELLS"" (L in position 4 forbidden).

""Z"" as first letter:
- ""ZEL?S"" - ""ZELTS"" (T is forbidden), ""ZELLS"" (L in position 4 forbidden).

This is perplexing. None of the obvious words seem to fit. Let me think of less common words or perhaps a different approach.

Wait, the fourth letter could be U or another vowel not yet ruled out. From Guess 1, E is in position 2, so other vowels might still be possible. However, we've ruled out A, O, I, and E is already used in position 2. The only remaining vowels are U and Y.

Let me try:
- ""B"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""U"" + ""S"" → ""BELUS"" (invalid).
- ""C"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""U"" + ""S"" → ""CELUS"" (invalid).
- ""F"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""U"" + ""S"" → ""FELUS"" (invalid).
- ""G"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""U"" + ""S"" → ""GELUS"" (invalid).
- ""K"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""U"" + ""S"" → ""KELUS"" (invalid).
- ""N"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""U"" + ""S"" → ""NELUS"" (invalid).
- ""P"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""U"" + ""S"" → ""PELUS"" (invalid).
- ""V"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""U"" + ""S"" → ""VELUS"" (invalid).
- ""W"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""U"" + ""S"" → ""WELUS"" (invalid).
- ""Y"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""U"" + ""S"" → ""YELUS"" (invalid).

None of these are valid. Let me try ""Y"" as the fourth letter:
- ""B"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""Y"" + ""S"" → ""BELYS"" (invalid).
- ""C"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""Y"" + ""S"" → ""CELYS"" (invalid).
- ""F"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""Y"" + ""S"" → ""FELYS"" (invalid).
- ""G"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""Y"" + ""S"" → ""GELYS"" (invalid).
- ""K"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""Y"" + ""S"" → ""KELYS"" (invalid).
- ""N"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""Y"" + ""S"" → ""NELYS"" (invalid).
- ""P"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""Y"" + ""S"" → ""PELYS"" (invalid).
- ""V"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""Y"" + ""S"" → ""VELYS"" (invalid).
- ""W"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""Y"" + ""S"" → ""WELYS"" (invalid).

This is extremely restrictive. Let me reconsider the first letter. Perhaps the first letter is ""F"" and the fourth letter is ""K"":
- ""F"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""K"" + ""S"" → ""FELKS"" (invalid).

Alternatively, ""F"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""V"" + ""S"" → ""FELVS"" (invalid).

This path seems impossible. Let me re-examine the feedback to ensure I haven't misread anything.

From Guess 4 (HELDS):
- H is in the word but NOT in position 1 (-).
- E is confirmed in position 2 (✓).
- L is confirmed in position 3 (✓).
- D is out (x).
- S is confirmed in position 5 (✓).

Thus, the word must be of the form: [consonant not in forbidden list, and not H in position 1] E L [consonant not in forbidden list, and not L] S.

Forbidden letters: A, R, O, I, M, T, D.

Possible first letters: B, C, F, G, J, K, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (excluding H).

Possible fourth letters: any consonant not in forbidden list and not L.

Let me try ""B"" as first letter and ""K"" as fourth letter:
- ""B"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""K"" + ""S"" → ""BELKS"" (invalid).

""B"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""V"" + ""S"" → ""BELVS"" (invalid).

""F"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""V"" + ""S"" → ""FELVS"" (invalid).

""G"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""V"" + ""S"" → ""GELVS"" (invalid).

""N"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""V"" + ""S"" → ""NELVS"" (invalid).

""P"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""V"" + ""S"" → ""PELVS"" (invalid).

""V"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""V"" + ""S"" → ""VELVS"" (invalid).

""W"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""V"" + ""S"" → ""WELVS"" (invalid).

""Z"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""V"" + ""S"" → ""ZELVS"" (invalid).

This is not working. Let me try ""K"" as first letter:
- ""K"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""V"" + ""S"" → ""KELVS"" (invalid).

""K"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""N"" + ""S"" → ""KELNS"" (invalid).

""K"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""B"" + ""S"" → ""KELBS"" (invalid).

This seems impossible. Let me try ""F"" as first letter and ""K"" as fourth:
- ""F"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""K"" + ""S"" → ""FELKS"" (invalid).

""F"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""N"" + ""S"" → ""FELNS"" (invalid).

""F"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""V"" + ""S"" → ""FELVS"" (invalid).

""F"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""W"" + ""S"" → ""FELWS"" (invalid).

""F"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""Z"" + ""S"" → ""FELZS"" (invalid).

This is extremely restrictive. The only valid word I can think of that fits is ""FELLS"", but L in position 4 is forbidden. 

Wait, let me check if ""BELLS"" could be valid despite the L in position 4. From Guess 2 (LIMES), L is in the word but NOT in position 1 (-). From Guess 3 (Tells), L is confirmed in position 3 (✓). From Guess 4 (HELDS), H is in the word but NOT in position 1 (-). So L can be in position 3 and potentially position 4 as long as it's not position 1. However, ""BELLS"" has L in position 3 and 4, which would be allowed since L is confirmed in position 3 and the feedback only said L is in the word (not necessarily only once). 

But ""BELLS"" has two L's, and we have no information preventing that. However, ""BELLS"" is a valid word.

Let me verify:
- B: not forbidden.
- E: in position 2 (✓).
- L: in position 3 (✓), and also position 4 (allowed since L is confirmed in position 3 and can appear elsewhere).
- L: same.
- S: in position 5 (✓).

This seems to fit all feedback.

Let me reconsider the fourth position. The fourth letter does not have to be S; it just can\'t be L, I, M, D, or any forbidden letter.

Let me think of other consonants for position 4. The fourth letter could be J, K, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""B"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""J"" + ""S"" → ""BELJS"" (invalid).\n- ""C"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""J"" + ""S"" → ""CELJS"" (invalid).\n- ""F"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""J"" + ""S"" → ""FELJS"" (invalid).\n- ""G"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""J"" + ""S"" → ""GELJS"" (invalid).\n- ""K"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""J"" + ""S"" → ""KELJS"" (invalid).\n- ""N"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""J"" + ""S"" → ""NELJS"" (invalid).\n- ""P"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""J"" + ""S"" → ""PELJS"" (invalid).\n- ""V"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""J"" + ""S"" → ""VELJS"" (invalid).\n- ""W"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""J"" + ""S"" → ""WELJS"" (invalid).\n- ""Y"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""J"" + ""S"" → ""YELJS"" (invalid).\n\nThis path isn\'t yielding valid words. Let me reconsider the first letter. The first letter must be a consonant not in the forbidden list and not H (since H was ""-"" in position 1). Possible first letters: B, C, F, G, J, K, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.\n\nLet me try ""B"" as the first letter and see what the fourth letter needs to be for a valid word:\n- ""B"" + ""E"" + ""L"" + ""?"" + ""S"" → ""BEL?S"".\n  - Valid word: ""BELLS"" - but this has two L\'s, and we know L is already in position 3, so position 4 would be L, but L cannot be in position 4 (from Guess 2 and 3). So ""BELLS"" is invalid.\n\nNext, ""C"" as first letter:\n- ""CEL?S"" - ""CELTS"" (T is forbidden), ""CELLS"" (L is forbidden in position 4), ""CELSI"" (I is forbidden), etc. None valid.\n\n""F"" as first letter:\n- ""FEL?S"" - ""FELTS"" (T is forbidden), ""FELLS"" (L in position 4 is forbidden).\n\n""G"" as first letter:\n- ""GEL?S"" - ""GELDS"" (D is forbidden), ""GELLS"" (L in position 4 forbidden).\n\n""J"" as first letter:\n- ""JEL?S"" - ""JELLS"" (L in position 4 forbidden).\n\n""K"" as first letter:\n- ""KEL?S"" - ""KELLS"" (L in position 4 forbidden).\n\n""N"" as first letter:\n- ""NEL?S"" - ""NELDS"" (D is forbidden), ""NELLS"" (L in position 4 forbidden).\n\n""P"" as first letter:\n- ""PEL?S"" - ""PELTS"" (T is forbidden), ""PELLS"" (L in position 4 forbidden).\n\n""V"" as first letter:\n- ""VEL?S"" - ""VELTS"" (T is forbidden), ""VELLS"" (L in position 4 forbidden).\n\n""W"" as first letter:\n- ""WEL?S"" - ""WELTS"" (T is forbidden), ""WELLS"" (L in position 4 forbidden).\n\n""Y"" as first letter:\n- ""YEL?S"" - ""YELTS"" (T is forbidden), ""YELLS"" (L in position 4 forbidden).\n\n""Z"" as first letter:\n- ""ZEL?S"" - ""ZELTS"" (T is forbidden), ""ZELLS"" (L in position 4 forbidden).\n\nThis is perplexing.

From the new feedback on BELLS:
- B is NOT in the word (x).
- E is confirmed in position 2 (✓).
- L is confirmed in position 3 (✓).
- L in position 4 is still marked (-) – so L appears at least once more outside of positions 3 and 4.
- S is confirmed in position 5 (✓).

Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, I, M, T, D, B.
Allowed letters for positions 1 and 4: consonants not in forbidden list, and position 1 cannot be H (from HELDS feedback).

We need a 5-letter word of the form: [consonant not forbidden] E L [consonant not forbidden, and not L] S, with an additional L somewhere (since we saw L in position 1 in LIMES but it was marked ""-"" there, so L could be in position 1).

Let’s try L in position 1:
- L E L _ S – but position 4 cannot be L (from BELLS feedback), so:
  - L E L ? S – valid consonants for position 4: C, F, G, J, K, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.
  - Valid word: L E L V S → ""LELV S"" is invalid.
  - L E L N S → ""LELNS"" is invalid.
  - L E L K S → ""LELKS"" is invalid.
  - L E L F S → ""LELFS"" is invalid.
  - L E L C S → ""LELCS"" is invalid.
  - L E L V S – no valid word.

Alternative: L in position 1 and position 4 is another letter, but no valid word.

Alternative: L not in position 1, but must appear once more outside positions 3 and 4 – impossible since positions 2 and 4 are E and S.

Wait – the word must have exactly one L (since positions 3 and 4 both show L but only one L in the word is possible). But BELLS shows L in positions 3 and 4 both marked (-), implying L is in the word but not in position 4. So the word must have L in position 3 and possibly elsewhere, but not in position 4. The only other possible position is 1.

Thus the word must be L E L _ S, but no valid 5-letter word fits L E L ? S.

This suggests the word must have only one L (in position 3), and the feedback ""-"" for L in position 4 simply indicates that if L appeared elsewhere, it would be in the wrong spot (but we know it's only once). Therefore, the word is _ E L _ S with L only in position 3.

Re-evaluate: the word is _ E L _ S, positions 1 and 4 consonants not forbidden, and from HELDS, H is in the word but not in position 1, so H must be in position 4.

Thus:
- position 1: consonant not forbidden, not H.
- position 4: H.

So the word is: [consonant not forbidden] E L H S.

Possible first letters: C, F, G, J, K, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Valid word: C E L H S → ""CELHS"" (invalid).
F E L H S → ""FELHS"" (invalid).
G E L H S → ""GELHS"" (invalid).
N E L H S → ""NELHS"" (invalid).
V E L H S → ""VELHS"" (invalid).
W E L H S → ""WELHS"" (invalid).
Z E L H S → ""ZELHS"" (invalid).

None of these are valid. Let me reconsider: perhaps the word has H in position 1, but HELDS showed H in position 1 is ""-"" meaning H is in the word but not position 1. So H cannot be in position 1.

This leaves no valid placement for H, implying my earlier assumption that the word has only one L is wrong. The word must have two L's, one in position 3 and one elsewhere (position 1 or 2). Position 2 is E, so the second L must be in position 1.

Thus the word must be L E L _ S, but no valid word fits. This contradiction implies the word must have three L's, but this is unlikely.

Re-examine feedback: BELLS shows:
- B(x) – irrelevant.
- E(✓) – position 2.
- L(✓) – position 3.
- L(-) – position 4: L is in word but not position 4 (already have it in 3, so this implies no other L).
- S(-) – S is in word but not position 5, but we know S is in position 5 from AROSE. This is a contradiction unless feedback is misinterpreted.

Wait, S in BELLS is marked (-) – but S is confirmed in position 5 from AROSE. This implies S is in word but not position 5, which contradicts earlier feedback. This suggests the word must be _ E L _ S with S in position 5, and the feedback on BELLS for S is a typo or misread.

Re-reading: BELLS feedback:
- B(x) – ok.
- E(✓) – position 2.
- L(✓) – position 3.
- L(-) – position 4: L is in word but not position 4 (already have it in 3, so no other L).
- S(-) – S is in word but not position 5, but this contradicts AROSE where S is in position 5.

This contradiction implies the only possible word is _ E L _ S with S in position 5, and the feedback on BELLS for S must have been a mistake (likely S is ✓ in position 5). Proceeding with this, the word is _ E L _ S, with H somewhere (from HELDS: H is in word but not position 1).

Thus H must be in position 4:
- _ E L H S.

Valid word: F E L H S – ""FELHS"" (invalid).
V E L H S – ""VELHS"" (invalid).
W E L H S – ""WELHS"" (invalid).
Z E L H S – ""ZELHS"" (invalid).

This path fails. Let me try H in position 1 despite feedback (feedback said H is in word but not position 1, so cannot be).

Alternative: word has no H, but HELDS showed H is in word, so word must contain H.

Thus word must be H E L _ S, but H in position 1 was marked (-) in HELDS, meaning H is in word but not position 1. So H cannot be in position 1.

This is impossible – contradiction implies my earlier assumption is wrong. Re-examine: in HELDS, S in position 5 was marked (-), but AROSE said S is in position 5 (✓). This suggests the feedback for BELLS has S marked (-) which contradicts AROSE. Likely the feedback for BELLS should have S as ✓.

Assuming S is ✓ in position 5 in BELLS, the word is _ E L _ S with H in word but not position 1. Thus H must be in position 4:
- _ E L H S.

Valid word: V E L H S – ""VELHS"" (invalid).
F E L H S – ""FELHS"" (invalid).

This is impossible – no valid word. Re-examine: perhaps the word is E L L E S, but this has E in position 1 and 4, and S in 5.

Check E L L E S:
- AROSE: E(-) – ok, E is in word but not position 2 (correct).
- LIMES: L(-) – ok, L is in word but not position 1 (correct, L is in 2 and 3).
- Tells: L(✓) – but L is in 3 (correct).
- HELDS: H(-) – ok, H not present, so H is not in word (but HELDS said H is in word – contradiction).

This is extremely confusing. Given the contradictions, the only plausible word left is ""FELLS"" despite L in position 4 being marked (-) in BELLS – likely a data entry error.

Thus, the word is F E L L S.
