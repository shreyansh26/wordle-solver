For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently appearing letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (present somewhere else).
- R is NOT in the word.
- O is NOT in the word.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O.
- Letters definitely in the word (but positions unknown): A, S, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, S, E (since they’re in the word but positions are wrong).
2. Does NOT contain R or O.
3. Uses new letters to test additional consonants/vowels.

A good candidate is ""STEAL"":
- It contains S, E, A (which we know are in the word).
- It introduces T and L as new letters to test.
- It avoids R and O as instructed.

This should help us narrow down positions for A, S, E and test T and L.

From the new feedback on CASES:
- C is NOT in the word.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (we already know it's in position 4 from STEAL, so this feedback is contradictory unless the feedback is interpreted per-guess only).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently appearing letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (present somewhere else).
- R is NOT in the word.
- O is NOT in the word.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O.
- Letters definitely in the word (but positions unknown): A, S, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, S, E (since they’re in the word but positions are wrong).
2. Does NOT contain R or O.
3. Uses new letters to test additional consonants/vowels.

A good candidate is ""STEAL"":
- It contains S, E, A (which we know are in the word).
- It introduces T and L as new letters to test.
- It avoids R and O as instructed.

This should help us narrow down positions for A, S, E and test T and L.

- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, T, L.
- We still need to place S and E somewhere among the remaining slots (positions 1,2,3,5) and we need to test new consonants.

A good next word should:
1. Keep A in position 4.
2. Include S and E in new positions.
3. Introduce new letters to test.

Candidate word: ""CASES""
- Keeps A in position 4.
- Moves S to position 1 and E to position 3.

From the feedback on FEIGN:
- F, I, G, N are NOT in the word.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position.

Current knowns:
- Letters in word and fixed positions: S (position 3), A (position 4).
- E must be in position 1, 2, or 5 (positions 3 & 4 are taken by S & A).
- Letters NOT in word: R, O, T, L, C, B, D, F, I, G, N.
- Remaining consonants to test: H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we want common ones).

We need a word that:
1. Has S in position 3.
2. Has A in position 4.
3. Has E in position 1, 2, or 5.
4. Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Candidate words:
- EASES: but S is already in position 3, and we can't have S in position 5 because the last S in CASES was marked (-) indicating S is not in position 5. Also, E can't be in position 2 because in BASED E was in position 2 and got (-), so E must be in position 1 or 5.
- HEAPS: but P is untested, and A is fixed in 4, so this would have A in position 2 which conflicts.
- WEASE: but W is untested, E in position 5 is possible.

Let's try ""WEASE"":
- W (new consonant) in position 1.
- E in position 2 (but in BASED E was in position 2 and got (-), so this is possible because the feedback was per-guess; the word could have E in position 2 if the previous (-) was for a different instance).
Wait, no - from BASED, E was in position 2 and got (-) meaning E is in the word but not in position 2. So E cannot be in position 2.

Thus E must be in position 1 or 5.

Let's try ""EASES"":
- E in position 1.
- A in position 2 - but A must be in position 4, so this is invalid.

Next candidate: ""HEAPS"" - invalid because A must be in position 4.

Next: ""YEAST"":
- But T is already eliminated (from AROSE).

Next: ""WEASE"" - E in position 2 is invalid as above.

Next: ""HEXAS"":
- X is untested, but A is in position 4, so this would have A in position 3 which is taken by S.

Next: ""PEASE"":
- P is untested, E in position 5.
- P E A S E: positions 1=P, 2=E (invalid as before), 5=E.

Wait, let's think differently: the word structure must be:
- Position 3: S
- Position 4: A
- E must be in position 1, 2, or 5.
- Positions 1,2,5 must use letters not eliminated.

Possible patterns:
- E _ S A _  (E in 1)
- _ E S A _  (E in 2 - but this is invalid because E can't be in 2)
- _ _ S A E  (E in 5)

Thus the only possible pattern is _ _ S A E, with E in position 5.

So we need a word ending with S A E, with S in 3, A in 4, E in 5.

Looking for common words: ""BASED"" was tried, but D is eliminated.

""CASES"" - C eliminated.

""PEASE"" - P is untested, but E would be in position 2 (invalid).

Wait, actually the pattern is:
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Letters:   ? ? S A E

Possible words: ""HESAE"" - not a word.
""ESA"" is prefix, but need 5 letters.

Actually, let's list remaining consonants: H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word like ""M"" or ""P"" or ""W"" in positions 1 and 2, ending with S A E.

Looking for real words: ""PEASE"" is a word, but as noted E would be in position 2 (invalid).

""WEASE"" - same issue.

""YEAST"" - T eliminated.

""HEXAS"" - X is possible, but not a word.

""KEASE"" - not a word.

""VEASE"" - not a word.

""PEASE"" seems to be the only candidate, but E would be in position 2.

This suggests E must be in position 5, so the word must be ? ? S A E.

Looking up 5-letter words ending with SAE: ""PEASE"" is the main one, but it's E in 2.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something - let me re-examine the feedback.

From CASES: S is confirmed in position 3 (✓), A is in position 4 (from STEAL), and E is in the word but in wrong positions.

From BASED: E is in the word but not in position 2.

Thus E must be in position 1 or 5.

Possible words:
- E _ S A _ : but E in position 1, then positions 2 and 5 need consonants not eliminated.
  - E M S A ? - but need a valid word.
  - ""EMSA?"" - not a word.

- _ _ S A E : E in position 5.
  - ""M"" in 1 and 2: ""M"" + ""P"" = ""MP"" - ""MPASE"" - not a word.
  - ""W"" in 1 and 2: ""W"" + ""H"" = ""WHASE"" - not a word.
  - ""P"" in 1 and 2: ""P"" + ""H"" = ""PHASE"" - this is a valid word!

""PHASE"":
- P (untested consonant) in position 1.
- H (untested consonant) in position 2.
- S in position 3 (fixed).
- A in position 4 (fixed).
- E in position 5 (new position for E).

This fits all constraints:
- Uses only non-eliminated letters (P and H are new).
- S in 3, A in 4, E in 5.

Let's check if this is valid:
- P, H, S, A, E - none are in the eliminated list.
- Structure: _ _ S A E with S in 3, A in 4, E in 5.

Thus ""PHASE"" is the next logical guess.

Next candidate: ""HEAPS"" - invalid because A must be in position 4.

Next: ""YEAST"":

Next: ""WEASE"" - E in position 2 is invalid as above.

Next: ""HEXAS"":

Next: ""PEASE"":
- P is untested, E in position 5.
- P E A S E: positions 1=P, 2=E (invalid as before), 5=E.

Wait, let's think differently: the word structure must be:
- Position 3: S
- Position 4: A
- E must be in position 1, 2, or 5.
- Positions 1,2,5 must use letters not eliminated.

Possible patterns:
- E _ S A _  (E in 1)
- _ E S A _  (E in 2 - but this is invalid because E can't be in 2)
- _ _ S A E  (E in 5)

Thus the only possible pattern is _ _ S A E, with E in position 5.

So we need a word ending with S A E, with S in 3, A in 4, E in 5.

Looking for common words: ""BASED"" was tried, but D is eliminated.

""CASES"" - C eliminated.

""PEASE"" - P is untested, but E would be in position 2 (invalid).

Thus E must be in position 1 or 5.

Possible words:
