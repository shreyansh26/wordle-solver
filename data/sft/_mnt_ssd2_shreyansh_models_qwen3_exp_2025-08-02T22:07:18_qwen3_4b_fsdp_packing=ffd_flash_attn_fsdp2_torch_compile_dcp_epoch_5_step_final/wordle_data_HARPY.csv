### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several letters at once. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently appearing letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). 

The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains:
- S: Common consonant
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Common vowel

This combination gives us good coverage of frequent letters and positions, which should provide useful feedback for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are **not** in the word (x).
- A is in the word but **not** in position 3 (-).

So we know:
- The word contains the letter A, but not in position 3.
- It does **not** contain S, L, T, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A (but not in position 3).
2. Does not contain S, L, T, E.

Let me think of words that fit these constraints. Good candidates often use remaining common letters like R, N, I, O, C, M, P, etc. One such word is ""CHART"":
- C, H, R are new letters.
- A is in position 2 (not 3).
- T is already ruled out, so this word won't work because it contains T.

Next candidate: ""CRIAR"" – but this uses R twice and might not be valid.

Next: ""CRANK"":
- Contains A (position 3) – ruled out because A can't be in position 3.

Next: ""FRANK"":
- Contains A (position 3) – again ruled out.

Next: ""CHARD"":
- Contains A (position 3) – ruled out.

Next: ""CABIN"":
- Contains A (position 1), no S, L, T, E. This seems valid.

Let me check:
- C, A, B, I, N – none are S, L, T, E.
- A is in position 1 (not 3), so this fits.

""CABIN"" looks like a good second guess.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, C, B, I, N  
   (only A is confirmed to be in the word so far).

2. Letter A is in the word AND in the correct position 2.

So every remaining letter must avoid all of those eight letters and must place A in position 2.

Common 5-letter words with A in position 2 and no other forbidden letters:

- A is fixed: _ A _ _ _
- Allowed consonants so far: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Allowed vowels so far: O, U (since A is already used)

Quick scan:
- D A _ _ _  → “DAMPS”, “DARMS” (but S is out)  
- F A _ _ _  → “FARMS” (S out), “FADIR” (I out)  
- H A _ _ _  → “HARDY” (D, Y still allowed)  
- M A _ _ _  → “MADAM” (M twice, but valid), “MARRY” (R, Y allowed)  
- P A _ _ _  → “PAPAW” (W allowed)  
- R A _ _ _  → “RASPY” (S, P, Y allowed)  
- W A _ _ _  → “WANDA” (N, D, A allowed)  

Among these, “HARDY” uses four fresh letters (H, R, D, Y) and has no repeats. It’s a strong candidate.

Another quick check: “MADAM” repeats M, which is acceptable but slightly less informative.  
“RASPY” repeats no letters but uses S, already ruled out.  
“PAPAW” repeats P and uses W; still valid but less optimal.  

“HARDY” seems best: all new letters, no repeats, keeps A in position 2.

So I’ll guess HARDY.

- R A _ _ _  → “RASPY” (S, P, Y allowed)  
- W A _ _ _  → “WANDA” (N, D, A allowed)  

Among these, “HARDY” uses four fresh letters (H, R, D, Y) and has no repeats. It’s a strong candidate.

Another quick check: “MADAM” repeats M, which is acceptable but slightly less informative.  
“RASPY” repeats no letters but uses S, already ruled out.  
“PAPAW” repeats P and uses W; still valid but less optimal.  

“HARDY” seems best: all new letters, no repeats, keeps A in position 2.

So I’ll guess HARDY.

From the feedback so far we know:

- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, C, B, I, N, D  
- Letters confirmed in the word and in their exact positions:  
  – H in position 1  
  – A in position 2  
  – R in position 3  
  – Y in position 5  

So the pattern is now:  H  A  R  _  Y  

Only position 4 is unknown.  
Allowed letters for position 4 are those not yet ruled out and not already used in the word (to avoid repeats).  
From the remaining alphabet, valid choices that have not been tested yet include: F, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Common 5-letter words that fit H A R _ Y:

- HARFY  (not a valid word)  
- HARRY  (but we already have Y in position 5; this would repeat Y, which is allowed only if the original word allows it, but we have no info that HARRY is possible)  
- HARPY  (P is still allowed)  
- HARBY  (B is already ruled out)  
- HARGY  (G is allowed, but HARGY is uncommon)  
- HARKY  (K is allowed, but HARKY is rare)  

The most common and valid word fitting the pattern is HARPY.

Let’s verify:  
H A R P Y  
- H, A, R, Y are confirmed in their correct positions.  
- P has not been ruled out yet.  
- No previously excluded letters are used.  

Therefore, HARPY is the logical next guess.
