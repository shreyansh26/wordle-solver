### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a word that maximizes the amount of information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that uses several of these high-frequency letters. 

""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels that might appear in the word. This should give me good information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

We also know E must appear somewhere other than positions 3 or 5 (from arose and stein feedback). So E could be in positions 2, 4.

From the three rounds of feedback:

Round 1: arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Round 2: stein → S(✓) T(x) E(-) I(-) N(x)
Round 3: spume → S(✓) P(✓) U(x) M(x) E(-)

What we now know:
- S is in position 1 (✓).
- P is in position 2 (✓).
- U and M are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but NOT in positions 3, 4, or 5 (from arose and spume feedback).  
  Therefore, E must be in position 2.  
  But position 2 is already occupied by P (✓).  
  This is a contradiction.

Wait, let me re-examine the feedback:
- arose: E(-) – E is in the word, not in position 5.
- stein: E(-) – E is in the word, not in position 3.
- spume: E(-) – E is in the word, not in position 5 (again).

So E must be in position 2, because positions 3, 4, 5 are ruled out, and position 1 is S.

But in spume, P is in position 2 (✓), so E cannot be in position 2. This is impossible.

This implies my earlier interpretation was wrong. Let me re-express:

From arose: E is in word, not in position 5.
From stein: E is in word, not in position 3.
From spume: E is in word, not in position 5 (again).

Thus, E must be in position 2 or 4.
But in stein, E was in position 3 (-), so not 3.
In spume, E was in position 5 (-), so not 5.
In arose, E was in position 5 (-), so not 5.

So E must be in position 2 or 4.

Also, from spume:
- P is in position 2 (✓), so P is fixed in position 2.
Thus, E cannot be in position 2, so E must be in position 4.

So the pattern is:
S P _ E _

Looking for valid words:

Another approach: position 3 could be any allowed letter.

Let me list possible letters for position 3: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a word that maximizes the amount of information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that uses several of these high-frequency letters. 

""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels that might appear in the word. This should give me good information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(x): A is not in the word.
- R(x): R is not in the word.
- O(x): O is not in the word.
- S(-): S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(-): E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So we know:
- The word contains S and E.
- It does not contain A, R, or O.
- S is not in position 4, and E is not in position 5.

Next, I should pick a word that:
1. Contains S and E.
2. Does not contain A, R, or O.
3. Places S and E in positions different from their previous positions (S not in 4th, E not in 5th).
4. Uses other common letters not yet tested (like T, L, N, I, C, etc.).

A good candidate is ""STEIN"":
- Contains S and E.
- Does not contain A, R, or O.
- S is in position 1 (new position), E is in position 3 (new position).
- Uses T, I, N which are common and untested.

This should maximize information gain.

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Round 2: stein → S(✓) T(x) E(-) I(-) N(x)

What we now know:
- S is in position 1 (✓).
- E is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).
- T, I, N are NOT in the word (x).
- A, R, O were already ruled out in round 1.

So the pattern so far:
S _ _ _ _

Letters still available (from the alphabet minus the eliminated ones):
Eliminated: A, O, R, T, I, N
Still possible: B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We also know E must appear somewhere other than positions 3 or 5 (from arose and stein feedback). So E could be in positions 2, 4.

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, containing E, not using any of the eliminated letters, and placing E in a permissible spot.

Let’s list some possibilities:
- S E _ _ _  (E in position 2)
- S _ _ E _  (E in position 4)

Common letters left: C, L, M, P, U, etc.

Good candidates:
- SHELF  (S, H, E, L, F) – E in position 3 is disallowed by feedback.
- SCENE  – uses N (eliminated) and C.
- SPEER – uses P, E, E, R (R eliminated).
- SLIME – uses L, I (I eliminated), M, E.
- SCREE – uses C, R (R eliminated), E, E.

Let’s pick a word that fits:
- S _ _ E _  (E in position 4) seems safer since E can’t be in 3 or 5.

Looking for S _ _ E _ words without any eliminated letters:
- SUGUE – not a valid word.
- SPUME – uses P, U, M, E. All letters allowed.
- SHULE – not common.
- SKENE – uses K, E, N (N eliminated).

SPUME seems valid and uses allowed letters.

Check:
- S P U M E
- S in position 1 (✓ from feedback).
- E in position 4 (allowed by current constraints).
- Letters P, U, M are all still possible.

From the four rounds of feedback we now have:

Letters eliminated:
A, O, R, T, I, N, U, M, D

So the last letter must be one of the remaining unused letters:
B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that starts with “SPIE” and ends with one of those letters.  
The only common English words that fit are:

SPIEL  (ends in L) – valid word  
SPIES  (ends in S, but S is already used in position 1)  
SPIEL is the only remaining valid candidate.

Check letters:
- S, P, I, E are already confirmed in their correct positions.
- L has not been eliminated.

Therefore the secret word must be SPIEL.
