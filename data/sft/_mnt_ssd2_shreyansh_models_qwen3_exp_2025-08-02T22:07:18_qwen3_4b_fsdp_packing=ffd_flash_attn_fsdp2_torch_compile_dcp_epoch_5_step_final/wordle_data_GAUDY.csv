### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us good coverage of common letters and can quickly narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is somewhere other than the first letter).
- R, O, S, E are **not** in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in position 1.
- Does **not** contain R, O, S, E.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A somewhere (positions 2-5).
- Does not contain R, O, S, E.

A good next guess should introduce new common consonants and vowels to test. I’ll pick a word that:
- Places A in a different position (e.g., second).
- Uses other common letters like T, N, L, D, etc.

“ADMIT” is a good candidate:
- A in position 2.
- Uses D, M, I, T — none of which were in the previous guess.

Summary of what we know so far:
1. Letters **not** in the word: R, O, S, E, M, I, T.
2. Letters **in** the word but in the wrong positions:
   - A (not in position 1 or 2)
   - D (not in position 1 or 2)

So the secret word:
- Must contain A and D.
- A cannot be in position 1 or 2.
- D cannot be in position 1 or 2.
- Cannot contain R, O, S, E, M, I, T.

Remaining common letters to try: N, L, U, C, G, H, K, P, Y, etc.

I need a word that:
- Uses A and D.
- Places A and D in positions 3-5 (since they can’t be in 1 or 2).
- Uses only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- DA??: but D can’t be in position 1, so DA?? is invalid.
- ?AD?: but A can’t be in 2, so this is invalid.
- ??AD: possible, but let’s look for words where A and D are in 3-5 and no forbidden letters.

Good candidate: “CANDY”
- C, N, Y are allowed.
- A is in position 3 (allowed).
- D is in position 4 (allowed).
- No forbidden letters.

Another candidate: “HOUND” – but O and U are allowed, but T is not allowed (T is excluded), so HOUND has T in position 5 which is excluded. So HOUND is invalid.

“LADY” – only 4 letters, invalid.

“DANCY” – D in position 1, but D can’t be in 1, so invalid.

“PACED” – E is excluded, so invalid.

From the new feedback on “candy”:
- C(x) → C is not in the word.
- A(✓) → A is in the word **and** in the **correct** position 2.
- N(x) → N is not in the word.
- D(✓) → D is in the word **and** in the **correct** position 4.
- Y(✓) → Y is in the word **and** in the **correct** position 5.

So the secret word now looks like:
_ A _ D Y

Known letters in fixed positions:
- Position 2: A
- Position 4: D
- Position 5: Y

Letters already ruled out entirely: R, O, S, E, M, I, T, C, N.

Letters still allowed: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (plus any others not yet excluded).

We need to find a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2, D in position 4, Y in position 5.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.
- Has valid letters for positions 1 and 3.

Possible patterns: B A _ D Y or F A _ D Y, etc.

Let’s list possible letters for positions 1 and 3:
Allowed consonants: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z
Allowed vowels: U (since A is already used in position 2, and E, I, O are ruled out)

So position 1: any of the allowed consonants or vowels.
Position 3: any of the allowed consonants or vowels.

Possible combinations:
- B A U D Y → “BAUDY” – valid word.
- F A U D Y → “FAUDY” – not a common word.
- G A U D Y → “GAUDY” – valid word.
- H A U D Y → “HAUDY” – not common.
- L A U D Y → “LAUDY” – valid word.
- P A U D Y → “PAUDY” – not common.

Among these, “BAUDY”, “GAUDY”, and “LAUDY” are all valid English words. We need to choose one that fits the constraints and is likely.

Let’s pick “GAUDY” as it’s a common word and uses G, which hasn’t been tested yet.
