### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. Among these, words like ""AROSE"" or ""RAISE"" are good because they contain multiple vowels and common consonants. 

""AROSE"" is particularly good because:
- A is the most common vowel
- R and S are very common consonants
- O and E are also frequent vowels
This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"", but since I don't have any prior info, any of these top candidates would work equally well. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers several high-frequency letters.

From the latest feedback on TANGE:

- A is now in the correct position (position 2).
- N is now in the correct position (position 3).
- E is confirmed in position 5.
- T and G are not in the word.

So the word now looks like: _ A N _ E

Letters still unknown for positions 1 and 4.  
Letters already ruled out: R, O, S, P, L, T, G.

Remaining common consonants to test: C, B, D, M, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: I, U.

We need two distinct letters for positions 1 and 4, neither of which can be any of the ruled-out letters, and we want to test common combinations.

Possible patterns:
1. C A N _ E → CAN_E → CANIE, CANE_, etc. (but must be 5 letters)
   - CANIE (but I is a vowel, N already used)
   - C A N E _ → but E is already in position 5, so this would be C A N E _, but position 4 would be _, which conflicts since E is fixed at 5. So C A N _ E.

Possible words fitting _ A N _ E:
- C A N _ E → CAN_E → CANIE (but I is in position 4)
- B A N _ E → BAN_E → BANES (but S is ruled out), BANIE
- M A N _ E → MAN_E → MANFE (but F not tested yet), MANIE
- H A N _ E → HAN_E → HANES (S ruled out), HANIE
- V A N _ E → VAN_E → VANET (T ruled out), VANIE
- D A N _ E → DAN_E → DANIE

Among these, ""DANIE"" is a valid 5-letter word (though ""DANIE"" is not common; ""DANES"" is invalid because S is ruled out). ""MANIE"" is also not common. ""BANIE"" is possible but not standard. ""C ANIE"" is not a word. 

However, ""VANIE"" is not a valid English word. The most plausible valid word from these is ""MANFE"" but F is not tested and seems less likely. 

Wait, let me reconsider valid English words fitting _ A N _ E:
- C A N _ E → CAN_E → CANIE (not valid)
- B A N _ E → BAN_E → BANES (invalid, S ruled out)
- M A N _ E → MAN_E → MANFE (invalid)
- H A N _ E → HAN_E → HANES (invalid)
- D A N _ E → DAN_E → DANIE (not valid)

Hmm, none of these are valid. Let me think differently: maybe position 4 is a vowel. The remaining vowels are I and U.

So possible words:
- C A N I E → ""CANIE"" - not valid
- C A N U E → ""CANUE"" - not valid
- B A N I E → ""BANIE"" - not valid
- B A N U E → ""BANUE"" - not valid

- D A N I E → ""DANIE"" - not valid
- D A N U E → ""DANUE"" - not valid

""MANIE"" is actually a valid word (though rare), but let's see if there's a more common one. 

Another approach: position 1 could be a consonant and position 4 could be a consonant or vowel. Let me list valid English words fitting _ A N _ E:

- C A N _ E → CAN_E → CANIE (no)
- B A N _ E → BAN_E → BANES (no, S ruled out)
- M A N _ E → MAN_E → MANFE (no)
- H A N _ E → HAN_E → HANES (no)
- V A N _ E → VAN_E → VANIE (no)
- D A N _ E → DAN_E → DANIE (no)

Wait, let me think of other possibilities. Maybe position 4 is a consonant not yet tested. 

Looking at remaining consonants: C, B, D, M, H, K, V, W, Y, F, etc.

Possible combinations:
- C A N C E → ""CANCE"" - but C is repeated and seems unlikely
- C A N D E → ""CANDE"" - not valid
- C A N B E → ""CANBE"" - not valid
- B A N C E → ""BANCE"" - not valid

""VANCE"" is a valid 5-letter word. Let's check:
- V (position 1) - untested
- A (position 2) - confirmed

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. Among these, words like ""AROSE"" or ""RAISE"" are good because they contain multiple vowels and common consonants. 

""AROSE"" is particularly good because:
- A is the most common vowel
- R and S are very common consonants
- O and E are also frequent vowels
This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"", but since I don't have any prior info, any of these top candidates would work equally well. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers several high-frequency letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)

From the feedback on AROSE:
- E is in the word and in the correct (5th) position.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is not in position 1).
- R, O, S are not in the word at all.

We now know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains A somewhere, but not in the first position.
3. It does not contain R, O, S.

Good remaining consonants to test: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and E are confirmed).

I want a word that:
- Ends with E.
- Contains A (not in position 1).
- Avoids R, O, S.

Possible candidates:
- TALKE (but K is less common)
- PLANE (but N is common, P is good)
- CHAPE (but H and P are good)
- GLADE (but D is good)
- TABLE (but B is good)

I'll choose ""PLANE"" because:
- P and N are common consonants.
- A is in position 2 (not position 1).
- Avoids R, O, S.
- E is confirmed in position 5.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word ends with E (E is in position 5).
2. It contains A and N, but both are in the wrong positions.
   - A is not in position 1 or 3.
   - N is not in position 4.
3. Letters that have been ruled out completely: R, O, S, P, L.

So the word looks like: _ _ _ _ E  
and must include both A and N somewhere in positions 2, 3 or 4, with the constraints above.

Remaining common consonants to test: T, C, D, M, B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I, U (A and E already confirmed).

Let’s try to place A and N under new constraints:
- A could be in position 2 or 4.
- N could be in position 2, 3 or 4 (but not 4 if A is there).

A promising pattern is _ A _ N E or _ N _ A E, or _ _ A N E, etc.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Ends with E.
- Contains both A and N in new positions.
- Uses only untested letters.

A good candidate is “TANGE”:
- T is untested and common.
- A is in position 2 (new position).
- N is in position 3 (new position).
- G is untested and common.
- E is confirmed in position 5.

This tests T, G, plus keeps A and N in new spots.
