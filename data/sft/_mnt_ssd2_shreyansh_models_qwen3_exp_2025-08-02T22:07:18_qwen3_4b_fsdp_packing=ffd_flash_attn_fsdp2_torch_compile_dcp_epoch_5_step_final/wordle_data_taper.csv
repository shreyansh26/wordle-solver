### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use some of these letters to quickly eliminate or confirm their presence in the secret word.

Looking at common 5-letter words that use these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a high chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word, providing valuable feedback for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in the first position.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in the second position.
- O(x) → O is NOT in the word.
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

So we now know:
- Letters definitely present: A, R, E  
- Letters definitely absent: O, S  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, R, E in positions other than 1, 2, 5 respectively.
- Does NOT contain O or S.

Good candidates use the known letters and avoid the eliminated ones. A word like “RAISE” contains all three known letters but uses S (eliminated), so that’s out. Instead, “EARLY” uses E, A, R but introduces L and Y. A better fit is “REACT” but it only has R and E. The word “CRATE” has C, R, A, T, E – all allowed letters and places A in position 3 and E in position 5 (but E can’t be in position 5). 

A better choice is “CRANE” – it has C, R, A, N, E. R is in position 2 (allowed since R can’t be in position 2 from arose feedback? Wait, arose had R in position 2 and feedback was (-) meaning R is in the word but not in position 2. So R cannot be in position 2. So CRANE has R in position 2 – that’s invalid.

Next candidate: “TREAD” – T, R, E, A, D. R is in position 2 – again invalid.

Next: “EARLY” – E, A, R, L, Y. E is in position 1 (allowed), A in 2 (allowed), R in 3 (allowed). This avoids O, S and places the known letters in allowed positions.

Another candidate: “DRAPE” – D, R, A, P, E. R in 2 – invalid.

“GRAPE” – G, R, A, P, E. R in 2 – invalid.

“EAGER” – E, A, G, E, R. E in 5 – invalid.

“ANGER” – A, N, G, E, R. A in 1 – invalid (A can’t be in 1).

“RAPER” – R, A, P, E, R. R in 1 and 5 – allowed positions for R (since R only can’t be in 2). A in 2 – allowed (R in arose was in 2, so A in 2 is allowed since A’s position wasn’t restricted). E in 4 – allowed. This avoids O, S and uses A, R, E.

But “RAPER” has R twice – we don’t know if R appears twice yet. “ANGER” has A in 1 – invalid.

“CATER” – C, A, T, E, R. A in 2 – allowed, E in 4 – allowed, R in 5 – allowed. Avoids O, S. This seems good.

So a strong next guess is “CATER”.

Current known positions:

Letters known to be absent: C, O, S
Letters still available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2
- E in position 4
- R in position 5
- T somewhere except position 3
- No C, O, S

Possible structure: _ A _ E R or _ A T E R (but T can't be in position 3, so if it's in position 3 it's invalid)

Let's list possible words fitting _ A _ E R:
- BATER (but T is in position 4, which is E's spot)
- DATER (T in 4, E in 4 - no)
- FATER - no
- GATER - no
- HATER - no
- JATER - no
- KATER - no
- LATER - no
- MATER - no
- NATER - no
- PATER - no
- QATER - no
- UATER - no
- VATER - no
- WATER - no
- XATER - no
- YATER - no
- ZATER - no

Wait, the structure is _ A _ E R, so T must be in position 1 or 3. Position 3 is invalid for T (from cater feedback), so T must be in position 1.

Thus, the word must be T A _ E R. The missing letter must be from available letters (not C, O, S).

Possible letters for position 3: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Possible words:
- TABER - not a valid word
- TADDER - no
- TAFER - no
- TAGER - no
- TAPER - valid word
- TAGER - no
- TAHER - no
- TAJER - no
- TAKER - valid word
- TAMER - valid word
- TAPER, TAKER, TAMER

Check each:
- TAPER: T A P E R - P is allowed, no C,O,S
- TAKER: T A K E R - K is allowed
- TAMER: T A M E R - M is allowed

All three are valid. Among these, ""TAPER"" is the most common.
</think>

Based on the feedback:
- A is fixed in position 2
- E is fixed in position 4
- R is fixed in position 5
- T must be in position 1 (since it can't be in position 3)
- The remaining letter (position 3) must be from allowed letters (not C, O, S)

- Position 2: A
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: R

Current known letters still to place: T
Letters known to be absent: C, O, S
Letters still available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2
- E in position 4
- R in position 5
- T somewhere except position 3
- No C, O, S

Possible structure: _ A _ E R or _ A T E R (but T can't be in position 3, so if it's in position 3 it's invalid)

Let's list possible words fitting _ A _ E R:
- BATER (but T is in position 4, which is E's spot)
- DATER (T in 4, E in 4 - no)
- FATER - no
- GATER - no
- HATER - no
- JATER - no
- KATER - no
- LATER - no
- MATER - no
- NATER - no
- PATER - no
- QATER - no
- UATER - no
- VATER - no
- WATER - no
- XATER - no
- YATER - no
- ZATER - no

Wait, the structure is _ A _ E R, so T must be in position 1 or 3. Position 3 is invalid for T (from cater feedback), so T must be in position 1.

Thus, the word must be T A _ E R. The missing letter must be from available letters (not C, O, S).

Possible letters for position 3: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Possible words:
- TABER - not a valid word
- TADDER - no
- TAFER - no
- TAGER - no
- TAPER - valid word
- TAGER - no
- TAHER - no
- TAJER - no
- TAKER - valid word
- TAMER - valid word
- TAPER, TAKER, TAMER

Check each:
- TAPER: T A P E R - P is allowed, no C,O,S
- TAKER: T A K E R - K is allowed
- TAMER: T A M E R - M is allowed

All three are valid. Among these, ""TAPER"" is the most common.Based on the feedback:
- A is fixed in position 2
- E is fixed in position 4
- R is fixed in position 5
- T must be in position 1 (since it can't be in position 3)
- The remaining letter (position 3) must be from allowed letters (not C, O, S)

The only valid structure is T A _ E R, and ""TAPER"" fits perfectly.",Guess 3: taper -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) A(✓) P(✓) E(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
