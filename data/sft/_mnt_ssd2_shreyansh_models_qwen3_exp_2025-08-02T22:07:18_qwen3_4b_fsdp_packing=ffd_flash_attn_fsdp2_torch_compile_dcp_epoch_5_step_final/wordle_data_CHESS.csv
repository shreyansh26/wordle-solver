### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

One of the best starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives us maximum coverage for the first guess. This will help us quickly identify which of these common letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.\n\nOne of the best starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives us maximum coverage for the first guess. This will help us quickly identify which of these common letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback:\n- S is in the word and in the correct 4th position.\n- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not 5th).\n- A, R, O are not in the word at all.\n\nSo we know:\n- Pattern: _ _ _ S _\n- Must include E somewhere (positions 1, 2, 3 or 4, but 4 is already S).\n- Cannot use A, R, O.\n\nGood letters to try next: T, I, N, L, C, U, D, M, P, H, etc.\n\nLet’s pick a word that:\n- Has S in 4th position.\n- Has E in a different position (not 5th).\n- Doesn’t use A, R, O.\n\nA strong candidate is “TENSE”:\n- T, N, E are new letters.\n- S is in correct 4th spot.\n- E is in 3rd spot (not 5th).\n\n<guess>TENSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)\nGuess 2: TENSE -> FEEDBACK: T(x) E(-) N(x) S(✓) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two rounds of feedback we have:\n\n1.

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)  
   - S is in position 4.  
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

2. TENSE → T(x) E(-) N(x) S(✓) E(-)  
   - Confirms S in position 4.  
   - First E is not in position 2; second E is not in position 5.

3. FLESH → F(x) L(x) E(✓) S(✓) H(-)  
   - E is now known to be in position 3.  
   - H is in the word but not in position 5.

So the pattern is now locked as:  
_ _ E S _

Letters ruled out: A, R, O, T, N, F, L  
Letters we know are in the word: E (position 3), S (position 4), H (somewhere not 5).

Hence H must be in position 1 or 2.

Possible words fitting _ _ E S _ with H in 1 or 2:  
- H _ E S _  
- _ H E S _

Remaining consonants allowed: B, C, D, G, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try H in position 1: H _ E S _  
Need a valid word like HIDES, HUMES, HUMPS, etc.  
But D, M, P, U are allowed.

HUMES – uses U and M, both allowed.  
HUMPS – P is allowed, but we already have S in 4.  
HUMPS would fit: H U M P S – but S is already in 4, so P would be in 3, but 3 is E. Doesn’t fit.

HIDES – I is allowed (vowels left: I, U), D is allowed.  
H I D E S – but S is in 4, E in 3, so this would be H I D E S, which is 5 letters.  
Wait, H I D E S: positions 1-H, 2-I, 3-D, 4-E, 5-S – but S must be in 4, E in 3. So this would be H I _ E S – but HIDES is H I D E S, which has D in 3, E in 4, S in 5 – that’s wrong.

Let me re-index:  
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Pattern:   _ _ E S _

So word must be: [1][2]E[S]_[5], with H in 1 or 2.

Examples:  
H _ E S _ → H I E S _ – but IES_? Need 5 letters.  
H I E S E – but E is already in 4.  
H I E S _ – what’s H I E S ? Not a word.

_ H E S _ → C H E S _ – CHESS has S twice, but S is already in 4.  
B H E S _ – no word.  
D H E S _ – no word.  
M H E S _ – no word.  
P H E S _ – no word.  
W H E S _ – no word.  
C H E S E – but E is already in 4, can’t repeat.

Let me try H in position 2: _ H E S _  
Need a word like B H E S _ – no.  
C H E S _ – CHESS (but S twice).  
D H E S _ – no.  
G H E S _ – no.  
K H E S _ – no.  
M H E S _ – no.  
V H E S _ – no.  
W H E S _ – no.  
Y H E S _ – no.  

Hmm, none obvious. Let me try H in position 1 with different vowels:  
H _ E S _  
H O E S _ – O is ruled out.  
H U E S _ – H U E S ? Not 5 letters.  
H I E S _ – no valid word.  

Let me think differently – maybe H is in position 2 with a consonant:  
_ H E S _  
D H E S _ – no.  
B H E S _ – no.  
G H E S _ – no.  
M H E S _ – no.  

Wait, is there a word like “CHESS”? No, S appears twice, and we don’t know if S repeats.  

Let me try H in position 2 with a valid word:  
“WHITE” – no S.  
“THYME” – no S.  

Another approach: list 5-letter words fitting _ _ E S _ with E in 3, S in 4, and H somewhere.  

Valid words:  
- HUMES – no.  
- HIKES – I, K allowed.  
- HIKES: H I K E S – positions: H(1), I(2), K(3), E(4), S(5) – but S must be in 4, E in 3. So this would be H I K E S – but E is in 4, S in 5 – violates pattern.  

Wait, pattern is _ _ E S _, so:  
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Letters:    ? ? E S ?  

So word must be: [1][2]E[S][5], with H in 1 or 2.  

Examples:  
B I E S _ – no.  
C I E S _ – no.  
D I E S _ – no.  
G I E S _ – no.  
M I E S _ – no.  
P I E S _ – no.  
V I E S _ – no.  

Let me try H in position 1 with consonants:  
H _ E S _  
H B E S _ – no.  
H C E S _ – no.  
H D E S _ – no.  
H G E S _ – no.  
H K E S _ – no.  
H M E S _ – no.  
H P E S _ – no.  
H V E S _ – no.  
H W E S _ – no.  
H Y E S _ – no.  

None of these form valid words.  

Let me try H in position 2 with consonants:  
_ H E S _  
B H E S _ – no.  
D H E S _ – no.  
F H E S _ – F ruled out.  
G H E S _ – no.  
K H E S _ – no.  
M H E S _ – no.  
P H E S _ – no.  
V H E S _ – no.  
W H E S _ – no.  
Y H E S _ – no.  

This is puzzling. Maybe I missed a word.  

Let me list all valid 5-letter words with pattern _ _ E S _ and see which fit ruled letters:  

Valid words with pattern **??E S ?** (E in 3, S in 4):  
- BESOM – B E S O M – O ruled out.  
- CEDAS – no.  
- CHESS – S twice, but let’s consider: C H E S S – positions: C(1), H(2), E(3), S(4), S(5). This has S in 4 and 5 – but we don’t know if S repeats. However, the feedback never said S only appears once, so this is possible.  

CHESS uses:  
- C, H, E, S, S  
- C is allowed (not ruled out).  
- H is allowed (in word, position 2).  
- E and S fit positions 3 and 4.  

So CHESS is a valid candidate.  

Let me verify:  
Letters used: C, H, E, S, S  
Ruled-out letters: A, R, O, T, N, F, L – none of these appear in CHESS.  

Thus, CHESS is a valid next guess.
