For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly effective because it includes:
- S: Very common starting letter
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Most common letter in English

This combination gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: not in word (x)
- L: not in word (x)
- A: correct position (✓) → A is in position 3
- T: in word but wrong position (-) → T exists somewhere else (positions 1,2,4,5)
- E: not in word (x)

- Contains the letter T somewhere not position 4
- Does NOT contain S, L, E

Good letters to try next: T (already confirmed), A (already placed), plus common remaining consonants and vowels like R, N, I, O, U, C, M, P, etc.

A balanced second guess should:
1. Keep A in position 3
2. Move T to a new position (avoiding position 4)
3. Introduce new common letters not yet tested

Possible candidates:

From the two rounds of feedback we have:

Round 1: SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(-) E(x)
- A is fixed in position 3.
- T is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4 (since it appeared in positions 1 and 4 and was marked “-” both times).

Round 2: TRAIN → T(-) R(-) A(✓) I(x) N(x)
- T is again marked “-” even though we moved it to position 1. This means T cannot be in position 1.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- I and N are not in the word.
- A is still locked in position 3.

So far:
- Word pattern: _ _ A _ _
- Letters known to be in the word: A (position 3), T (somewhere not positions 1 or 4), R (somewhere not position 2).
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: S, L, E, I, N.

Remaining common consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining common vowels: O, U (since A is already used).

A good next guess should:
1. Keep A in position 3.
2. Place T in a new position (possible 2, 3, or 5 – but 3 is already A, so 2 or 5).
3. Place R in a new position (possible 1, 3, 4, 5 – but 3 is A, so 1, 4, or 5).
4. Introduce new letters like O, U, C, M, P, etc.

Let’s try a word that moves T to position 2, R to position 1 or 4, and introduces O and C.

Candidate words:
- CROAK: C, R in 1, O in 2, A in 3, K in 5. T is not used here.
- CRAFT: C, R in 1, A in 3, F in 4, T in 5. Uses T in 5.
- CRATE: C, R in 1, A in 3, T in 4 (but T cannot be in 4).
- BROTH: B, R in 1, O in 2, T in 3 (but A is in 3), so invalid.
- PROUD: P, R in 1, O in 2, U in 3 (but A is in 3), so invalid.

CRAFT seems good: T is in position 5 (new position for T), R is in position 1 (new position for R), and introduces C and F.

But let’s check if we can use T in position 2 with a better letter set. How about:
- CROAT: C, R in 1, O in 2, A in 3, T in 5. Same as CRAFT.
- CORTA: C, O in 2, R in 3 (but A is in 3), so invalid.

Another option is:
- MORTA: M, O in 2, R in 3 (invalid as above).

Perhaps:
- PRACT: P, A in 2 (but A must be in 3), so invalid.

Best seems CRAFT or CROAK. CROAK doesn’t use T, so CRAFT is better to keep testing T.

But let me think of a word that uses T in position 2 and R elsewhere. How about:
- ARTIC: A in 3, R in 1, T in 2, I in 3 (invalid as A is in 3), so no.

Actually, T in position 2 and R in position 4: word like
- TORAC: T in 1 (invalid), so no.

Let me list possible positions:
- T can be in 2 or 5 (since not 1 or 4).
- R can be in 1, 4, or 5 (since not 2).

Let’s try a word with T in 2 and R in 4 or 5, and new letters.

Candidate:
- COTRY: C, O in 2, T in 3 (invalid as A is in 3), so no.

Another:
- CATTY: T appears twice, but Y is new, but T is already in 3 (invalid).

Better:
- COTTA: C, O in 2, T in 3 (invalid).

Let me try T in 5 and R in 1 or 4.

For R in 1 and T in 5:
- CR***: C, R in 1, need letters for 2,3,4 with A in 3, T in 5.
- C R _ A _ T
Possible: C R O A K, C R O A D, C R I A T (but I is out), C R U A T (U is new), etc.

CROAK fits: C, R in 1, O in 2, A in 3, K in 4, but T is in 5. This uses T in 5 (new), R in 1 (new), and O (new).

Similarly:
- CROAK: C, R in 1, O in 2, A in 3, K in 4 (but T must be in word, so K is new).
Wait, CROAK has T in 5, which is new for T.

This seems the best: CROAK introduces C, R, O, K and places T in 5.

But let me check if CROAK is valid: yes, it’s a word.

Alternatively:
- CRAFT: C, R in 1, A in 3, F in 4, T in 5. Also good.

Between CROAK and CRAFT, CRAFT seems slightly better as F is common.

But let’s pick CROAK to test T in 5, R in 1, and new letters O, K.

Actually, let me re-evaluate: we know R is in the word but not in position 2. If we place R in position 1, that’s allowed.

So CROAK:
- C (new)
- R in 1 (allowed)
- O (new)
- A in 3 (fixed)
- K (new)
And T is in 5 (new position for T).

This seems optimal.

But another thought: we have T and R both needing placement. Maybe a word that places T in 2 and R in 4 or 5.

For example:
- C R A T _ : but then R is in 2 (invalid), so no.
- _ R A T _ : but T would be in 4 (invalid as T cannot be in 4).

Thus, T must be in 2 or 5, and R must be in 1, 4, or 5.

Let’s try T in 2 and R in 4:
- _ _ A T R
Need letters for 1 and 2, avoiding used letters.

Possible:
- C R A T _ : R in 2 (invalid)
- B R A T _ : R in 2 (invalid)
- P R A T _ : R in 2 (invalid)

Thus, T in 2 seems hard because R would need to be in 1, 4, or 5, but 4 is invalid for T, and 5 is possible.

Wait, let’s try:
- C R A T _ : R in 2 (invalid)
- C _ A T R : T in 4 (invalid), R in 5.
So C _ A T R is invalid as T cannot be in 4.

Thus, T in 2 seems limited. Let’s instead go with T in 5 and R in 1 or 4.

For R in 1 and T in 5:
- C R _ A _ T
Possible: C R O A K (but K is new), C R U A T (U is new), etc.

CROAK seems best.

Alternatively, R in 4 and T in 5:
- _ _ A R T
Need letters for 1,2.
- C O A R T: C, O new, A in 3, R in 4, T in 5. This is valid and tests R in 4 and T in 5.

CAORT is not a word, but COART is not valid either. CORTA is valid but T is in 5.

CORTA: C, O, R, A, T. Positions: 1-C, 2-O, 3-R (invalid as A must be in 3), so no.

Thus, CROAK is the best candidate.

But let me think of another: C R A P T (but P is new, T in 5, R in 1, A in 3). CRAPT is not a word.

Best valid word seems CROAK.

However, let me check CRAFT:
- C, R in 1, A in 3, F new, T in 5.
Valid word.

Between CROAK and CRAFT, CRAFT introduces F while CROAK introduces O and K. Both are good, but CRAFT seems slightly better.

Let me go with CRAFT.

Wait, but in CRAFT:
- C, R in 1, A in 3, F new, T in 5.
This places T in 5 (new), R in 1 (new), and F (new).

Yes, this seems optimal.

Final choice: CRAFT.

From the feedback:
- A is fixed in position 3.
- T must appear somewhere other than positions 1 or 4.
- R must appear somewhere other than position 2.
- Letters not in the word: S, L, E, I, N.

I’ll place T in position 5 and R in position 1, introducing new common letters C and F.

2. Place T in a new position (possible 2, 3, or 5 – but 3 is already A, so 2 or 5).
3. Place R in a new position (possible 1, 3, 4, 5 – but 3 is A, so 1, 4, or 5).
4. Introduce new letters like O, U, C, M, P, etc.

Let’s try a word that moves T to position 2, R to position 1 or 4, and introduces O and C.

Candidate words:
- CROAK: C, R in 1, O in 2, A in 3, K in 5. T is not used here.
- CRAFT: C, R in 1, A in 3, F in 4, T in 5. Uses T in 5.
- CRATE: C, R in 1, A in 3, T in 4 (but T cannot be in 4).
- BROTH: B, R in 1, O in 2, T in 3 (but A is in 3), so invalid.
- PROUD: P, R in 1, O in 2, U in 3 (but A is in 3), so invalid.

CRAFT seems good: T is in position 5 (new position for T), R is in position 1 (new position for R), and introduces C and F.

But let’s check if we can use T in position 2 with a better letter set. How about:
- CROAT: C, R in 1, O in 2, A in 3, T in 5. Same as CRAFT.
- CORTA: C, O in 2, R in 3 (but A is in 3), so invalid.

Another option is:
- MORTA: M, O in 2, R in 3 (invalid as above).

Perhaps:
- PRACT: P, A in 2 (but A must be in 3), so invalid.

Best seems CRAFT or CROAK. CROAK doesn’t use T, so CRAFT is better to keep testing T.

But let me think of a word that uses T in position 2 and R elsewhere. How about:
- ARTIC: A in 3, R in 1, T in 2, I in 3 (invalid as A is in 3), so no.

Actually, T in position 2 and R in position 4: word like
- TORAC: T in 1 (invalid), so no.

Let me list possible positions:
- T can be in 2 or 5 (since not 1 or 4).
- R can be in 1, 4, or 5 (since not 2).

Let’s try a word with T in 2 and R in 4 or 5, and new letters.

Candidate:
- COTRY: C, O in 2, T in 3 (invalid as A is in 3), so no.

Another:
- CATTY: T appears twice, but Y is new, but T is already in 3 (invalid).

Better:
- COTTA: C, O in 2, T in 3 (invalid).

Let me try T in 5 and R in 1 or 4.

For R in 1 and T in 5:
- CR***: C, R in 1, need letters for 2,3,4 with A in 3, T in 5.
- C R _ A _ T
Possible: C R O A K, C R O A D, C R I A T (but I is out), C R U A T (U is new), etc.

CROAK fits: C, R in 1, O in 2, A in 3, K in 4, but T is in 5. This uses T in 5 (new), R in 1 (new), and O (new).

Similarly:
- CROAK: C, R in 1, O in 2, A in 3, K in 4 (but T must be in word, so K is new).
Wait, CROAK has T in 5, which is new for T.

This seems the best: CROAK introduces C, R, O, K and places T in 5.

But let me check if CROAK is valid: yes, it’s a word.

Alternatively:
- CRAFT: C, R in 1, A in 3, F in 4, T in 5. Also good.

Between CROAK and CRAFT, CRAFT seems slightly better as F is common.

But let’s pick CROAK to test T in 5, R in 1, and new letters O, K.

Actually, let me re-evaluate: we know R is in the word but not in position 2. If we place R in position 1, that’s allowed.

So CROAK:
- C (new)
- R in 1 (allowed)
- O (new)
- A in 3 (fixed)
- K (new)
And T is in 5 (new position for T).

This seems optimal.

But another thought: we have T and R both needing placement. Maybe a word that places T in 2 and R in 4 or 5.

For example:
- C R A T _ : but then R is in 2 (invalid), so no.
- _ R A T _ : but T would be in 4 (invalid as T cannot be in 4).

Thus, T must be in 2 or 5, and R must be in 1, 4, or 5.

Let’s try T in 2 and R in 4:
- _ _ A T R
Need letters for 1 and 2, avoiding used letters.

Possible:
- C R A T _ : R in 2 (invalid)
- B R A T _ : R in 2 (invalid)
- P R A T _ : R in 2 (invalid)

Thus, T in 2 seems hard because R would need to be in 1, 4, or 5, but 4 is invalid for T, and 5 is possible.

Wait, let’s try:
- C R A T _ : R in 2 (invalid)
- C _ A T R : T in 4 (invalid), R in 5.
So C _ A T R is invalid as T cannot be in 4.

Thus, T in 2 seems limited. Let’s instead go with T in 5 and R in 1 or 4.

For R in 1 and T in 5:
- C R _ A _ T
Possible: C R O A K (but K is new), C R U A T (U is new), etc.

CROAK seems best.

Alternatively, R in 4 and T in 5:
- _ _ A R T
Need letters for 1,2.
- C O A R T: C, O new, A in 3, R in 4, T in 5. This is valid and tests R in 4 and T in 5.

CAORT is not a word, but COART is not valid either. CORTA is valid but T is in 5.

CORTA: C, O, R, A, T. Positions: 1-C, 2-O, 3-R (invalid as A must be in 3), so no.

Thus, CROAK is the best candidate.

But let me think of another: C R A P T (but P is new, T in 5, R in 1, A in 3). CRAPT is not a word.

Best valid word seems CROAK.

However, let me check CRAFT:
- C, R in 1, A in 3, F new, T in 5.
Valid word.

Between CROAK and CRAFT, CRAFT introduces F while CROAK introduces O and K. Both are good, but CRAFT seems slightly better.

Let me go with CRAFT.

Wait, but in CRAFT:
- C, R in 1, A in 3, F new, T in 5.
This places T in 5 (new), R in 1 (new), and F (new).

Yes, this seems optimal.

Final choice: CRAFT.From the feedback:
- A is fixed in position 3.
- T must appear somewhere other than positions 1 or 4.
- R must appear somewhere other than position 2.
- Letters not in the word: S, L, E, I, N.

I’ll place T in position 5 and R in position 1, introducing new common letters C and F.",Guess 3: CRAFT -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(✓) F(x) T(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly effective because it includes:
- S: Very common starting letter
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Most common letter in English

This combination gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: not in word (x)
- L: not in word (x)
- A: correct position (✓) → A is in position 3
- T: in word but wrong position (-) → T exists somewhere else (positions 1,2,4,5)
- E: not in word (x)

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ A _ _
- Contains the letter T somewhere not position 4
- Does NOT contain S, L, E

Good letters to try next: T (already confirmed), A (already placed), plus common remaining consonants and vowels like R, N, I, O, U, C, M, P, etc.

A balanced second guess should:
1. Keep A in position 3
2. Move T to a new position (avoiding position 4)
3. Introduce new common letters not yet tested

Possible candidates:
- TRAIN: A in 3, T in 2, introduces R, I, N
- CATER: A in 3, T in 4 (but T was in position 4 in SLATE and was marked ""-"", so T cannot be in 4 → invalid)
- CRATE: A in 3, T in 5, introduces C, R
- TRAIL: A in 3, T in 1, introduces R, I, L (but L was already ruled out → invalid)

""TRAIN"" seems ideal: keeps A in 3, moves T to 2, and adds R, I, N.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: TRAIN -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(-) A(✓) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we have:

Round 1: SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(-) E(x)
- A is fixed in position 3.
- T is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4 (since it appeared in positions 1 and 4 and was marked “-” both times).

Round 2: TRAIN → T(-) R(-) A(✓) I(x) N(x)
- T is again marked “-” even though we moved it to position 1. This means T cannot be in position 1.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- I and N are not in the word.
- A is still locked in position 3.

So far:
- Word pattern: _ _ A _ _
- Letters known to be in the word: A (position 3), T (somewhere not positions 1 or 4), R (somewhere not position 2).
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: S, L, E, I, N.

Remaining common consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining common vowels: O, U (since A is already used).

A good next guess should:
1. Keep A in position 3.
2. Place T in a new position (possible 2, 3, or 5 – but 3 is already A, so 2 or 5).
3. Place R in a new position (possible 1, 3, 4, 5 – but 3 is A, so 1, 4, or 5).
4. Introduce new letters like O, U, C, M, P, etc.

Let’s try a word that moves T to position 2, R to position 1 or 4, and introduces O and C.

Candidate words:

- CRAFT: C, R in 1, A in 3, F in 4, T in 5. Uses T in 5.
- CRATE: C, R in 1, A in 3, T in 4 (but T cannot be in 4).
- BROTH: B, R in 1, O in 2, T in 3 (but A is in 3), so invalid.
- PROUD: P, R in 1, O in 2, U in 3 (but A is in 3), so invalid.

CRAFT seems good: T is in position 5 (new position for T), R is in position 1 (new position for R), and introduces C and F.

But let’s check if we can use T in position 2 with a better letter set. How about:

This uses T in 5 (new), R in 1 (new), and O (new).\n\nSimilarly:\n- CROAK: C, R in 1, O in 2, A in 3, K in 4 (but T must be in word, so K is new).\nWait, CROAK has T in 5, which is new for T.\n\nThis seems the best: CROAK introduces C, R, O, K and places T in 5.\n\nBut let me check if CROAK is valid: yes, it’s a word.\n\nAlternatively:\n- CRAFT: C, R in 1, A in 3, F in 4, T in 5. Also good.\n\nBetween CROAK and CRAFT, CRAFT seems slightly better as F is common.\n\nBut let’s pick CROAK to test T in 5, R in 1, and new letters O, K.\n\nActually, let me re-evaluate: we know R is in the word but not in position 2. If we place R in position 1, that’s allowed.\n\nSo CROAK:\n- C (new)\n- R in 1 (allowed)\n- O (new)\n- A in 3 (fixed)\n- K (new)\nAnd T is in 5 (new position for T).\n\nThis seems optimal.\n\nBut another thought: we have T and R both needing placement. Maybe a word that places T in 2 and R in 4 or 5.\n\nFor example:\n- C R A T _ : but then R is in 2 (invalid), so no.\n- _ R A T _ : but T would be in 4 (invalid as T cannot be in 4).\n\nThus, T must be in 2 or 5, and R must be in 1, 4, or 5.\n\nLet’s try T in 2 and R in 4:\n- _ _ A T R\nNeed letters for 1 and 2, avoiding used letters.\n\nPossible:\n- C R A T _ : R in 2 (invalid)\n- B R A T _ : R in 2 (invalid)\n- P R A T _ : R in 2 (invalid)\n\nThus, T in 2 seems hard because R would need to be in 1, 4, or 5, but 4 is invalid for T, and 5 is possible.\n\nWait, let’s try:\n- C R A T _ : R in 2 (invalid)\n- C _ A T R : T in 4 (invalid), R in 5.\nSo C _ A T R is invalid as T cannot be in 4.\n\nThus, T in 2 seems limited. Let’s instead go with T in 5 and R in 1 or 4.\n\nFor R in 1 and T in 5:\n- C R _ A _ T\nPossible: C R O A K (but K is new), C R U A T (U is new), etc.\n\nCROAK seems best.\n\nAlternatively, R in 4 and T in 5:\n- _ _ A R T\nNeed letters for 1,2.\n- C O A R T: C, O new, A in 3, R in 4, T in 5. This is valid and tests R in 4 and T in 5.\n\nCAORT is not a word, but COART is not valid either. CORTA is valid but T is in 5.\n\nCORTA: C, O, R, A, T. Positions: 1-C, 2-O, 3-R (invalid as A must be in 3), so no.\n\nThus, CROAK is the best candidate.\n\nBut let me think of another: C R A P T (but P is new, T in 5, R in 1, A in 3). CRAPT is not a word.\n\nBest valid word seems CROAK.\n\nHowever, let me check CRAFT:\n- C, R in 1, A in 3, F new, T in 5.\nValid word.\n\nBetween CROAK and CRAFT, CRAFT introduces F while CROAK introduces O and K. Both are good, but CRAFT seems slightly better.\n\nLet me go with CRAFT.\n\nWait, but in CRAFT:\n- C, R in 1, A in 3, F new, T in 5.\nThis places T in 5 (new), R in 1 (new), and F (new).\n\nYes, this seems optimal.\n\nFinal choice: CRAFT.From the feedback:\n- A is fixed in position 3.\n- T must appear somewhere other than positions 1 or 4.\n- R must appear somewhere other than position 2.\n- Letters not in the word: S, L, E, I, N.\n\nI’ll place T in position 5 and R in position 1, introducing new common letters C and F.\n\n<guess>CRAFT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: TRAIN -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(-) A(✓) I(x) N(x)\nGuess 3: CRAFT -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(✓) F(x) T(✓)\n'}]","<think>
From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Positions locked in:
   - Position 3 = A
   - Position 1 = C
   - Position 5 = T

   So the pattern is: C _ A _ T

2. Letters that are in the word but whose exact positions are still uncertain:
   - R (from TRAIN and CRAFT: R was marked “-” both times, so it must be in positions 2 or 4)

3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
   S, L, E, I, N, F

4. Remaining unused common consonants and vowels:
   Common consonants left: B, D, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y
   Common vowels left: O, U (since A is already used)

We need a 5-letter word that fits the pattern C _ A _ T and contains R.  
The only positions left to fill are positions 2 and 4.  
Since R must be in the word and cannot be in position 1, 2, or 5 (from prior feedback), R must be in position 4.

Therefore the pattern is: C _ A R T

The only common English 5-letter word that fits this pattern is:
C O A R T → COART is not a valid word.
C U A R T → CUART is not valid.
C H A R T → CHART is valid.

Let’s verify:
- C H A R T
  - C in position 1 (✓)
  - H in position 2 (new letter)
  - A in position 3 (✓)
  - R in position 4 (must be here, as shown)
  - T in position 5 (✓)

All constraints satisfied.
