For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use some of these letters to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

Looking at these common letters, ""SLATE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L, A, T, E (all among the most frequent letters)

This gives us a broad coverage of common consonants and vowels in one guess. If any of these letters appear in the feedback, we'll have a clear indicator of what's in the word. Even if none of them are correct, we'll have eliminated many possibilities for future guesses.

Remaining common letters to try: O, I, N, D, G, U, M, B, F, K, Y, W, V, etc.

Possible patterns: _ _ A S _

Let’s brainstorm words that fit:
- OASIS – but H is already excluded, but I is allowed. However, this has I in position 5, which might be okay.
- BASIS – but B and I are allowed, but we need to check other letters.
- DASH – but this is only 4 letters.
- FOCUS – but C and O are allowed, but this has C excluded.
- GAINS – but G and N are allowed, but this has C excluded.
- MASS – but only 4 letters.
- PAINS – but P is allowed, but this has C excluded.
- WAINS – but W and N are allowed, but this has C excluded.

Wait, let me think differently. The pattern is _ _ A S _. We need 5 letters.

Looking at common words:
- OASIS – O, A, S, I, S. But A is in position 3, S in 4, and we need to check other letters. O, I are allowed since they haven't been excluded. L, T, E, C, R, H are excluded. So OASIS is valid.
- BASIS – B, A, S, I, S. B and I are allowed.
- DASIS – but D is allowed, but this isn't a common word.
- GAINS – G, A, I, N, S. G, I, N are allowed.
- MANS – but only 4 letters.
- PAINS – P, A, I, N, S. P, I, N are allowed.
- WAINS – W, A, I, N, S. W, I, N are allowed.

Among these, ""OASIS"" is a very common word. Let's try it first.

But wait, in CRASH feedback, H was excluded (H(x)), but I wasn't checked. So OASIS uses I, which is allowed.

Another option is ""GAINS"" – G, A, I, N, S. G, I, N are allowed.

Let me choose ""OASIS"" as it's a common word and tests O and I.

But let me double-check: O, A, S, I, S. A is position 3, S is position 4. No L, T, E, C, R, H. O and I are new letters. This seems correct.

So the next guess is OASIS.

But let me double-check: O, A, S, I, S. A is position 3, S is position 4. No L, T, E, C, R, H. O and I are new letters. This seems correct.

So the next guess is OASIS.

Let’s carefully parse the new feedback on OASIS:

O(x)  → O is NOT in the word.  
A(-)  → A is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
S(-)  → S is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
I(x)  → I is NOT in the word.  
S(✓)  → S is in position 5 and is CORRECT.

So we now know:
- Word ends in S (position 5): _ _ A _ S
- A is in the word, but not in position 2 or 3. The only remaining place for A is position 1 or 2.  
- Letters already ruled out: L, T, E, C, R, H, O, I  
- Letters still allowed: A, S (already placed), plus any untested ones like B, D, F, G, M, N, P, U, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends in S (position 5).
2. Contains A in position 1 or 2.
3. Uses only allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
- A _ A _ S  (but A can’t repeat unless the word has double A, e.g., A _ A _ S → A A _ _ S doesn’t fit _ _ A _ S)
- _ A _ _ S with A in position 2.

Wait, the only possible positions for A are now:
- Position 1: A _ A _ S → impossible because we need _ _ A _ S
- Position 2: _ A _ A S → impossible because A must be in position 1 or 2, but the pattern is _ _ A _ S.

Actually, the pattern is fixed: _ _ A _ S (A in position 3, S in position 5).  
But the feedback on OASIS shows A(-) which means A is in the word but NOT in position 2. Since we already have A in position 3 from SLATE, this is consistent. The key takeaway is that A is definitely in position 3 and S in position 5, and the earlier feedback about A(-) in OASIS simply re-affirms A is in the word (which we already know).

Let me re-express the constraints clearly:
- Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
- Known: _ _ A _ S (A in 3, S in 5)
- Excluded letters: L, T, E, C, R, H, O, I
- Remaining letters to test: B, D, F, G, M, N, P, U, W, Y, etc.

We need a word fitting _ _ A _ S with no excluded letters. Common candidates:
- BANAS → but N is allowed, but A repeats which might be okay.
- DUNAS → D, U, N, A, S. D, U, N are allowed.
- FUMAS → but F, U, M, A, S. F, U, M are allowed.
- GUMAS → G, U, M, A, S. G, U, M are allowed.
- MANAS → M, A, N, A, S. M, N are allowed.
- PUNAS → P, U, N, A, S. P, U, N are allowed.

Among these, ""DUNAS"" is a common word using D, U, N. Let's try it.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use some of these letters to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

Looking at these common letters, ""SLATE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L, A, T, E (all among the most frequent letters)

This gives us a broad coverage of common consonants and vowels in one guess. If any of these letters appear in the feedback, we'll have a clear indicator of what's in the word. Even if none of them are correct, we'll have eliminated many possibilities for future guesses.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently first; must be in positions 2-5)

- A is in the word and in the correct position (third letter)

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ A _ _

2. Uses S in a different position
3. Avoids L, T, E
4. Introduces other common letters not yet tested (R, O, N, I, C, etc.)

Remaining common letters to try: O, I, N, D, G, U, M, B, F, K, Y, W, V, etc.

Possible patterns: _ _ A S _

Let’s brainstorm words that fit:
- OASIS – but H is already excluded, but I is allowed. However, this has I in position 5, which might be okay.
- BASIS – but B and I are allowed, but we need to check other letters.
- DASH – but this is only 4 letters.

- MASS – but only 4 letters.
- PAINS – but P is allowed, but this has C excluded.
- WAINS – but W and N are allowed, but this has C excluded.

Wait, let me think differently. The pattern is _ _ A S _. We need 5 letters.

Looking at common words:
- OASIS – O, A, S, I, S. But A is in position 3, S in 4, and we need to check other letters. O, I are allowed since they haven't been excluded. L, T, E, C, R, H are excluded. So OASIS is valid.

- GAINS – G, A, I, N, S. G, I, N are allowed.
- MANS – but only 4 letters.
- PAINS – P, A, I, N, S. P, I, N are allowed.
- WAINS – W, A, I, N, S. W, I, N are allowed.

Among these, ""OASIS"" is a very common word. Let's try it first.

But wait, in CRASH feedback, H was excluded (H(x)), but I wasn't checked. So OASIS uses I, which is allowed.

Another option is ""GAINS"" – G, A, I, N, S. G, I, N are allowed.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use some of these letters to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

Looking at these common letters, ""SLATE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L, A, T, E (all among the most frequent letters)

This gives us a broad coverage of common consonants and vowels in one guess. If any of these letters appear in the feedback, we'll have a clear indicator of what's in the word. Even if none of them are correct, we'll have eliminated many possibilities for future guesses.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently first; must be in positions 2-5)
- L, T, E are NOT in the word at all
- A is in the word and in the correct position (third letter)

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ A _ _
- Contains S (but not in position 1)
- Does NOT contain L, T, E

We want a new guess that:
1. Keeps A in position 3
2. Uses S in a different position
3. Avoids L, T, E
4. Introduces other common letters not yet tested (R, O, N, I, C, etc.)

A good candidate is “CRASH”:
- C, R, H are new letters
- A is in the correct spot
- S is in position 4 (different from position 1)

Let’s try it.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ A S _
- Must contain S (and it must be in position 4)
- A is in position 3 (confirmed twice)
- Letters NOT in the word: L, T, E, C, R, H

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 3
- S in position 4
- No L, T, E, C, R, H

Remaining common letters to try: O, I, N, D, G, U, M, B, F, K, Y, W, V, etc.

Possible patterns: _ _ A S _

Let’s brainstorm words that fit:
- OASIS – but H is already excluded, but I is allowed. However, this has I in position 5, which might be okay.
- BASIS – but B and I are allowed, but we need to check other letters.
- DASH – but this is only 4 letters.
- FOCUS – but C and O are allowed, but this has C excluded.
- GAINS – but G and N are allowed, but this has C excluded.
- MASS – but only 4 letters.
- PAINS – but P is allowed, but this has C excluded.
- WAINS – but W and N are allowed, but this has C excluded.

Wait, let me think differently. The pattern is _ _ A S _. We need 5 letters.

Looking at common words:
- OASIS – O, A, S, I, S. But A is in position 3, S in 4, and we need to check other letters. O, I are allowed since they haven't been excluded. L, T, E, C, R, H are excluded. So OASIS is valid.
- BASIS – B, A, S, I, S. B and I are allowed.
- DASIS – but D is allowed, but this isn't a common word.
- GAINS – G, A, I, N, S. G, I, N are allowed.
- MANS – but only 4 letters.
- PAINS – P, A, I, N, S. P, I, N are allowed.
- WAINS – W, A, I, N, S. W, I, N are allowed.

Among these, ""OASIS"" is a very common word. Let's try it first.

But wait, in CRASH feedback, H was excluded (H(x)), but I wasn't checked. So OASIS uses I, which is allowed.

Another option is ""GAINS"" – G, A, I, N, S. G, I, N are allowed.

Let me choose ""OASIS"" as it's a common word and tests O and I.

But let me double-check: O, A, S, I, S. A is position 3, S is position 4. No L, T, E, C, R, H. O and I are new letters. This seems correct.

So the next guess is OASIS.

Guess 3: OASIS -> FEEDBACK: O(x) A(-) S(-) I(x) S(✓)

Let’s carefully parse the new feedback on OASIS:

O(x)  → O is NOT in the word.  
A(-)  → A is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
S(-)  → S is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
I(x)  → I is NOT in the word.  
S(✓)  → S is in position 5 and is CORRECT.

So we now know:
- Word ends in S (position 5): _ _ A _ S
- A is in the word, but not in position 2 or 3. The only remaining place for A is position 1 or 2.  
- Letters already ruled out: L, T, E, C, R, H, O, I  
- Letters still allowed: A, S (already placed), plus any untested ones like B, D, F, G, M, N, P, U, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends in S (position 5).
2. Contains A in position 1 or 2.
3. Uses only allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
- A _ A _ S  (but A can’t repeat unless the word has double A, e.g., A _ A _ S → A A _ _ S doesn’t fit _ _ A _ S)
- _ A _ _ S with A in position 2.

Wait, the only possible positions for A are now:
- Position 1: A _ A _ S → impossible because we need _ _ A _ S
- Position 2: _ A _ A S → impossible because A must be in position 1 or 2, but the pattern is _ _ A _ S.

Actually, the pattern is fixed: _ _ A _ S (A in position 3, S in position 5).  
But the feedback on OASIS shows A(-) which means A is in the word but NOT in position 2. Since we already have A in position 3 from SLATE, this is consistent. The key takeaway is that A is definitely in position 3 and S in position 5, and the earlier feedback about A(-) in OASIS simply re-affirms A is in the word (which we already know).

Let me re-express the constraints clearly:
- Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
- Known: _ _ A _ S (A in 3, S in 5)
- Excluded letters: L, T, E, C, R, H, O, I
- Remaining letters to test: B, D, F, G, M, N, P, U, W, Y, etc.

We need a word fitting _ _ A _ S with no excluded letters. Common candidates:
- BANAS → but N is allowed, but A repeats which might be okay.
- DUNAS → D, U, N, A, S. D, U, N are allowed.
- FUMAS → but F, U, M, A, S. F, U, M are allowed.

- MANAS → M, A, N, A, S. M, N are allowed.
- PUNAS → P, U, N, A, S. P, U, N are allowed.

The key takeaway is that A is definitely in position 3 and S in position 5, and the earlier feedback about A(-) in OASIS simply re-affirms A is in the word (which we already know).\n\nLet me re-express the constraints clearly:\n- Positions: 1 2 3 4 5\n- Known: _ _ A _ S (A in 3, S in 5)\n- Excluded letters: L, T, E, C, R, H, O, I\n- Remaining letters to test: B, D, F, G, M, N, P, U, W, Y, etc.\n\nWe need a word fitting _ _ A _ S with no excluded letters. Common candidates:\n- BANAS → but N is allowed, but A repeats which might be okay.\n- DUNAS → D, U, N, A, S. D, U, N are allowed.\n- FUMAS → but F, U, M, A, S. F, U, M are allowed.\n- GUMAS → G, U, M, A, S. G, U, M are allowed.\n- MANAS → M, A, N, A, S. M, N are allowed.\n- PUNAS → P, U, N, A, S.

Let’s summarize everything we now know:

1. Pattern: _ _ A _ S  (A is in position 3, S in position 5)
2. Letters that are NOT in the word (ever):  
   L, T, E, C, R, H, O, I, D, U, N, G  
3. From GAMAS feedback:  
   - G(x) → G is out (already knew that)  
   - A(-) → A is in word but not in position 2 (redundant, since we know A is in position 3)  
   - M(-) → M is in word but NOT in position 3 (redundant, since position 3 is A)  
   - A(-) → same as above  
   - S(✓) → S is correct in position 5  

So the only fixed positions are:
- Position 3: A  
- Position 5: S  

We still need letters for positions 1, 2, and 4, using only letters that have NOT been excluded.  
Allowed letters so far: B, F, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and maybe others, but these are the ones that haven’t appeared).

We also know from GAMAS that M is in the word (M(-) means M exists but is not in position 3). Since position 3 is A, M could be in position 1, 2, or 4.

Let’s list possible combinations for positions 1, 2, 4 that:
- include M (since we now know M is in the word)  
- use only allowed letters  
- form a common 5-letter English word

Possible placements for M:
- Position 1: M _ A _ S  
- Position 2: _ M A _ S  
- Position 4: _ _ A M S  

Common words that fit:
- M _ A _ S: “MATCH” – but C is excluded. “MAPLE” – E is excluded.  
- _ M A _ S: “PLANK” – N is excluded. “BLANK” – N is excluded. “SMACK” – C, K allowed but C is excluded.  
- _ _ A M S: “CLAMPS” – C, L excluded. “PLAMS” – not a word. “FLAMS” – not standard. “BAMAS” – not standard.  

Wait, let’s think of actual common words with pattern _ _ A _ S that include M.

One valid word: “PLAMS” – not common.  
Another: “CLAMS” – C, L excluded.  
“SLAMS” – S is already in position 5. L is excluded.  
“FLAMS” – not standard.  
“AMASS” – A repeats, but double A is possible. Let’s check: A(✓) is already in position 3, so A in position 1 is allowed (since earlier feedback only said A is not in position 2). So “AMASS” uses A in position 1 and M in position 2. Letters: A, M, M, A, S. M is allowed, A is allowed, S is allowed. No excluded letters. This seems valid.

Another candidate: “PMAS” – but needs 5 letters.  
“AMASS” is the most promising common word that fits all constraints.

Let’s verify:
- A in position 1 (allowed)  
- M in position 2 (allowed)  
- A in position 3 (correct)  
- S in position 5 (correct)  
- No letters from the excluded list.

Therefore, “AMASS” is a valid next guess.
