### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. 

Common starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - vowel-heavy
- ROATE (R, O, A, T, E)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly effective because:
1. C and R are common consonants in English words
2. A and E are the two most common vowels
3. N is a very common ending letter
4. It covers 5 different letters, maximizing coverage

This should give us good information about which of these 4 letters are in the word and their positions.

From the new feedback on PERVY:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. 

Common starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - vowel-heavy
- ROATE (R, O, A, T, E)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly effective because:
1. C and R are common consonants in English words
2. A and E are the two most common vowels
3. N is a very common ending letter
4. It covers 5 different letters, maximizing coverage

This should give us good information about which of these 4 letters are in the word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- N is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
- The word contains R and E, but not C, A, N.
- R is not in position 2, and E is not in position 5.

We need a new word that:
1. Contains R and E
2. Does not contain C, A, N
3. Has R not in position 2 and E not in position 5

Good candidate letters to include (common ones not yet ruled out): S, T, I, O, D, L, M, P, U, etc.

Let’s try a word that places R and E in new positions and introduces new common letters. A good choice is ""STORE"":
- S, T, O are new letters.
- R is now in position 3 (not 2).
- E is now in position 2 (not 5).

This should give us more information about S, T, O and confirm the positions of R and E.

From the two previous guesses we know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: C, A, N, S, T, O  
2. Letters that ARE in the word, but we still don’t know their exact positions: R, E  

Specific placement constraints still hold:
- R is not in position 2 (from CRANE) and not in position 4 (from STORE)  
- E is not in position 5 (from CRANE) and not in position 5 again (from STORE) — same constraint remains

So far:
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 4
- E cannot be in position 5

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains both R and E
- Excludes C, A, N, S, T, O
- Places R somewhere other than 2 or 4
- Places E somewhere other than 5

Good remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, Z  
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out, E is already required)

Let’s try to place:
- R in position 1, 3, or 5

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. 

Common starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - vowel-heavy
- ROATE (R, O, A, T, E)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly effective because:
1. C and R are common consonants in English words
2. A and E are the two most common vowels
3. N is a very common ending letter
4. It covers 5 different letters, maximizing coverage

This should give us good information about which of these 4 letters are in the word and their positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- N is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
- The word contains R and E, but not C, A, N.
- R is not in position 2, and E is not in position 5.

We need a new word that:
1. Contains R and E
2. Does not contain C, A, N
3. Has R not in position 2 and E not in position 5

Good candidate letters to include (common ones not yet ruled out): S, T, I, O, D, L, M, P, U, etc.

Let’s try a word that places R and E in new positions and introduces new common letters. A good choice is ""STORE"":
- S, T, O are new letters.
- R is now in position 3 (not 2).
- E is now in position 2 (not 5).

This should give us more information about S, T, O and confirm the positions of R and E.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STORE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(x) R(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two previous guesses we know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: C, A, N, S, T, O  
2. Letters that ARE in the word, but we still don’t know their exact positions: R, E  

Specific placement constraints still hold:
- R is not in position 2 (from CRANE) and not in position 4 (from STORE)  
- E is not in position 5 (from CRANE) and not in position 5 again (from STORE) — same constraint remains

So far:
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 4
- E cannot be in position 5

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains both R and E
- Excludes C, A, N, S, T, O
- Places R somewhere other than 2 or 4
- Places E somewhere other than 5

Good remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, Z  
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out, E is already required)

Let’s try to place:
- R in position 1, 3, or 5
- E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4

A promising candidate is “PERVY”:
- P, V, Y are new letters
- E in position 2
- R in position 3
- All letters are allowed so far
- No disallowed letters

Another candidate could be “FURRY”, but double R might not give new info. “PERVY” seems more informative.

Let’s go with “PERVY”.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: STORE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(x) R(-) E(-)
Guess 3: PERVY -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(-) R(-) V(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on PERVY:
- P(x), V(x), Y(x) → these three letters are NOT in the word.
- E(-), R(-) → confirms E and R are in the word but still in wrong positions.

Summary of known facts:
Letters OUT: C, A, N, S, T, O, P, V, Y  
Letters IN (positions unknown): E, R  
Position constraints:
- R ≠ 2, 4, 3 (from CRANE and STORE and PERVY) → R can only be in 1 or 5
- E ≠ 5 (from CRANE and STORE and PERVY) → E can be in 1, 2, 3, or 4

Remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, W, Z  
Remaining vowels: I, U (since A, O are out, and E is already required)

We need a word that:
- Contains both E and R
- Uses only allowed letters
- Places R in 1 or 5
- Places E somewhere not 5

Let’s try to place:
- R in position 1 (most restrictive)
- E in position 2, 3, or 4

Candidate letters left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, I, U, W, Z

A good candidate is “RIDGE”:
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- I, D, G are new letters
- E in position 5 → but E cannot be in 5 (constraint). So RIDGE is invalid.

Next candidate: “RILED”
- R in 1
- I, L, D are new
- E in 3 (allowed)
- Letters: R, I, L, E, D — all allowed so far
- No disallowed letters
- Meets all constraints

Another candidate: “RIDGE” fails, so “RILED” looks good.

Let’s go with “RILED”.

Guess 4: RILED -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(✓) L(x) E(✓) D(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RILED:
- R(-) → R is in the word but NOT in position 1
- I(✓) → I is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2)
- L(x) → L is NOT in the word
- E(✓) → E is in the word AND in the correct position (position 4)
- D(-) → D is in the word but NOT in position 5

So far we know:
Letters OUT: C, A, N, S, T, O, P, V, Y, L  
Letters IN & fixed position: I at 2, E at 4  
Letters IN but position unknown: R, D  
Position constraints:
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (already ruled out by previous guesses) → R must be in position 5
- D cannot be in position 5 → D must be in position 1, 3, or (but 4 is taken by E) so 1 or 3

Current word skeleton:
_ I _ E _

With R fixed at position 5:
_ I _ E R

Now we need a letter for position 1 and position 3 from remaining allowed letters: B, F, G, H, K, M, U, W, Z, D

Also, D must be placed at 1 or 3.

Possible candidates:
- D I _ E R → need a valid 3rd letter: D I ? E R → DIWER? Not valid
- _ I D E R → need a valid 1st letter: B, F, G, H, K, M, U, W, Z

Looking for valid 5-letter words fitting _ I _ E R with D in 3rd position:
- B I D E R → ""BIDER"" (valid word)
- F I D E R → ""FIDER"" (not a common word)
- G I D E R → ""GIDER"" (not valid)
- H I D E R → ""HIDER"" (valid word)
- M I D E R → ""MIDER"" (not valid)
- W I D E R → ""WIDER"" (valid word)

Among these, ""BIDER"", ""HIDER"", ""WIDER"" are all valid. ""BIDER"" is more common.
