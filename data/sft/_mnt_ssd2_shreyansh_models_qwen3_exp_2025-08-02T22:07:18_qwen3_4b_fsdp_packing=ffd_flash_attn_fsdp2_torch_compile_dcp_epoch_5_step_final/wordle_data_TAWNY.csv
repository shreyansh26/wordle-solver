For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent

This should give me good information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

From the feedback on “arose” we now know:

- A is in the secret word but is not in the first position.  
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the secret word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains an A somewhere (positions 2-5).  
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.  
- Has five distinct letters (since none of the letters we know are in the word are duplicated in arose).

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already confirmed, and E is out).

I want a word that:
- Uses A (not in position 1).  
- Avoids R, O, S, E.  
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is “UNTIL”:
- U and I are still possible vowels.  
- N, T, L are common consonants.  
- A is not used, but that’s fine since we already know A is somewhere and we can check placement later.

However, to maximize vowel coverage and include A, a better choice is “PAINT”:
- P, N, T are common consonants.  
- A and I are vowels (with A in position 2).  
- This tests new letters while also re-using A to find its correct spot.

Let’s go with “PAINT”.

Current knowledge:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, P, I
- Letters confirmed IN the word and their positions:
  – A is in position 2 (✓)
  – N is in position 4 (✓)
- Letters that are somewhere in the word but whose exact positions are unknown:
  – T (because it got “-” in paint: it is in the word but not in position 5)
- Letters still untested that are common: D, L, C, B, G, H, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A in position 2.
2. Has N in position 4.
3. Contains T somewhere (but not at the end).
4. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible pattern: _ A _ N _ (with T in 1, 3, or 5, but 5 is excluded because T was “-” in position 5). So T must be in 1 or 3.

Let’s try T in position 3: _ A T N _  
Letters left to fill: positions 1 and 5.  
Good consonants left: D, L, C, B, G, H, M, etc.  
Good vowels left: U (since A is used, E, I, O are out).

Try “C” in position 1 and “U” in position 5: C A T N U → “catnu” – not a valid word.  
Try “B” and “U”: B A T N U – “batnu” – invalid.  
Try “D” and “U”: D A T N U – “datnu” – invalid.  
Try “G” and “U”: G A T N U – “gatnu” – invalid.  
Try “H” and “U”: H A T N U – “hatnu” – invalid.

Try T in position 1: T A _ N _  
Letters left: positions 3 and 5.  
Good options for position 3: consonants like L, C, D, M, etc.  
Good options for position 5: vowels like U or Y.

Try “T A L N _” – need a valid word.  
“T A L N E” – E is out.  
“T A L N U” – “talnu” – invalid.  
“T A C N _” – “tacne” – E is out.  
“T A C N U” – invalid.  
“T A M N _” – “tamne” – E is out.  
“T A M N U” – invalid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent

This should give me good information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose” we now know:

- A is in the secret word but is not in the first position.  
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the secret word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains an A somewhere (positions 2-5).  
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.  
- Has five distinct letters (since none of the letters we know are in the word are duplicated in arose).

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already confirmed, and E is out).

I want a word that:
- Uses A (not in position 1).  
- Avoids R, O, S, E.  
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is “UNTIL”:
- U and I are still possible vowels.  
- N, T, L are common consonants.  
- A is not used, but that’s fine since we already know A is somewhere and we can check placement later.

However, to maximize vowel coverage and include A, a better choice is “PAINT”:

- Letters confirmed in the word: A (position 2), N, T.  
- N is not in position 3.  
- T is not in position 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2.  
- Contains N and T somewhere else (positions not yet ruled out).  
- Does not contain R, O, S, E, P, I.

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
Remaining vowels: U (A is already placed).

A good candidate would use the confirmed letters A, N, T plus new letters.  
Let’s try “CHANT”:
- C, H, U are new letters.  
- A is in position 2.  
- N and T are present (N is in position 3, T in 5 – neither is in a forbidden spot).  
- No disallowed letters.

This seems like a strong next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent

This should give me good information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

From the feedback on “arose” we now know:

- A is in the secret word but is not in the first position.  
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the secret word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains an A somewhere (positions 2-5).  
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.  
- Has five distinct letters (since none of the letters we know are in the word are duplicated in arose).

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already confirmed, and E is out).

I want a word that:
- Uses A (not in position 1).  
- Avoids R, O, S, E.  
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is “UNTIL”:
- U and I are still possible vowels.  
- N, T, L are common consonants.  
- A is not used, but that’s fine since we already know A is somewhere and we can check placement later.

However, to maximize vowel coverage and include A, a better choice is “PAINT”:
- P, N, T are common consonants.  
- A and I are vowels (with A in position 2).  
- This tests new letters while also re-using A to find its correct spot.

Let’s go with “PAINT”.

Let’s digest the new feedback:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   A is in the word but not in position 1.

2. paint → P(x) A(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(-)  
   A is fixed in position 2.  
   N is in the word but not in position 3.  
   T is in the word but not in position 4.

3. chant → C(x) H(x) A(-) N(✓) T(-)  
   C, H are not in the word.  
   A is in position 3 here, but we already know A is in position 2, so this simply confirms A is not in position 3.  
   N is in position 4 (✓), so N’s correct spot is now position 4.  
   T is in position 5 but marked (-), meaning T is in the word but not in position 5.

So the pattern is now:
- A _ _ _ _
- _ _ _ N _
- Letters used so far: A, N, T (positions 2, 4, and somewhere else).  
- Letters ruled out: R, O, S, E, P, I, C, H.

We still need to place T somewhere. Possible positions for T: 1, 3 (since 4 is N and 5 is excluded).  
We need two more distinct letters (not in the banned list) for the remaining spots.

Let’s try:
- T in position 1: T A _ _ N  
- Need one more letter for position 3 and one for 5.  
Common unused letters: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
Let’s pick B and D: T A B L N? No, L is okay, but we need to check if any letters are banned – they aren’t.  
Word: T A B L N – but is “tabl” a valid root? Maybe “TALON” but O is banned.  
Alternative: T A M P N – but P is banned.  
Alternative: T A G N _ – but N is already in 4.  
Wait, we need 5 letters: T A _ _ N.

Let’s try T A M B N – but is “tambn” a word? No.  
Alternative: T A K E N – but E is banned.  
Alternative: T A R N _ – R is banned.  
Alternative: T A L K N – no.  
Alternative: T A L L N – double L is okay, but “talln” isn’t a word.  
Alternative: T A N G N – no.  
Let me rethink: we have T A _ _ N, need valid 5-letter words.

Valid words fitting T A _ _ N:
- TACAN – but C is banned.  
- TALON – O is banned.  
- TAMAN – not valid.  
- TAPIR – I, R banned.  
- TAWNY – W, Y okay, but N is already in 4.  
Word: T A W N Y – but Y is okay, and we have T A _ _ N.  
But N is in position 4, so T A W N Y would have N in 4 and Y in 5.  
But T A W N Y is 5 letters: T A W N Y.  
Check letters: T, A, W, N, Y – none banned.  
Positions: T(1), A(2), W(3), N(4), Y(5).  
This fits all constraints.

Another option: T A M B N – invalid.  
Another: T A L K N – invalid.  
Another: T A U N _ – T A U N is 4 letters.  
Another: T A U G N – G, N okay, but word?  
Actually, “TAUNG” is a word (a geological term), but is it common enough?  
“TAWNY” seems better.

Let’s go with T A W N Y.

But wait – the feedback shows T is in the word but not in position 5 (from chant: T(-) means T is in word but not in position 5). So T could be in 1, 3.  
In T A W N Y, T is in 1, A in 2, W in 3, N in 4, Y in 5. This fits.

Another candidate: T A M P N – but P is banned.  
Another: T A L L N – invalid.  
Another: T A G N _ – T A G N is 4 letters.  
Another: T A U N _ – T A U N is 4 letters.  
Another: T A L K N – invalid.  
Another: T A L E N – E banned.  
Another: T A B L N – invalid.  
Another: T A L O N – O banned.  
Another: T A L I N – I banned.  
Another: T A L K N – invalid.  
Another: T A L E N – E banned.  
Another: T A L U N – U, N okay, but word?  
Actually, “TAULN” is not a word.  
So “TAWNY” seems the best fit.

Let me verify: T A W N Y – letters T, A, W, N, Y.  
- A is in position 2 (confirmed).  
- N is in position 4 (confirmed).  
- T is in position 1 (not excluded).  
- W and Y are new letters, not ruled out.  
This should be a valid guess.

Alternative: T A L L N – double L is okay, but “talln” isn’t a word.  
Alternative: T A N G N – no.  
Let me rethink: we have T A _ _ N, need valid 5-letter words.

Valid words fitting T A _ _ N:
- TACAN – but C is banned.  
- TALON – O is banned.  
- TAMAN – not valid.  
- TAPIR – I, R banned.  
- TAWNY – W, Y okay, but N is already in 4.  
Word: T A W N Y – but Y is okay, and we have T A _ _ N.  
But N is in position 4, so T A W N Y would have N in 4 and Y in 5.  
But T A W N Y is 5 letters: T A W N Y.  
Check letters: T, A, W, N, Y – none banned.  
Positions: T(1), A(2), W(3), N(4), Y(5).  
This fits all constraints.

Another option: T A M B N – invalid.  
Another: T A L K N – invalid.  
Another: T A U N _ – T A U N is 4 letters.  
Another: T A U G N – G, N okay, but word?  
Actually, “TAUNG” is a word (a geological term), but is it common enough?  
“TAWNY” seems better.

Let’s go with T A W N Y.

But wait – the feedback shows T is in the word but not in position 5 (from chant: T(-) means T is in word but not in position 5). So T could be in 1, 3.  
In T A W N Y, T is in 1, A in 2, W in 3, N in 4, Y in 5. This fits.

Another candidate: T A M P N – but P is banned.  
Another: T A L L N – invalid.  
Another: T A G N _ – T A G N is 4 letters.  
Another: T A U N _ – T A U N is 4 letters.  
Another: T A L K N – invalid.  
Another: T A L E N – E banned.  
Another: T A B L N – invalid.  
Another: T A L O N – O banned.  
Another: T A L I N – I banned.  
Another: T A L K N – invalid.  
Another: T A L E N – E banned.  
Another: T A L U N – U, N okay, but word?  
Actually, “TAULN” is not a word.  
So “TAWNY” seems the best fit.

Let me verify: T A W N Y – letters T, A, W, N, Y.  
- A is in position 2 (confirmed).  
- N is in position 4 (confirmed).  
- T is in position 1 (not excluded).  
- W and Y are new letters, not ruled out.  
This should be a valid guess.",Guess 5: tawny -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) A(✓) W(✓) N(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
