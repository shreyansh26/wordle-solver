1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good first guess should use some of these letters while avoiding repetition to test as many letters as possible.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repetitions. This will help us quickly identify which of these common letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on “arose” we now know:

- The letter E is in the secret word and is in the 5th position (last letter).
- The letters A, R, O, S are **not** in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and contains none of A, R, O, S.

Next I want to test new common letters that haven’t been ruled out yet.  
The remaining high-frequency letters are: T, I, N, L, C, D, U, Y, H, M, K, B, F, G, etc.

A good second guess should:
1. Keep the known E in position 5.
2. Introduce as many new common letters as possible.
3. Avoid the already-eliminated A R O S.

One such candidate is “TINCE”:
- T, I, N, C are all new letters.
- C is placed before E, which is allowed since we only know E is in position 5.
- None of T, I, N, C were ruled out by previous feedback.

This should give us more information about which of these new letters are present and their positions.

From the feedback so far:

- E is in the word, but NOT in position 5 (because in tubed, E was in position 4 and got “-” instead of “✓”).  
- Letters A, R, O, S, T, U, B, D are **not** in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word ends with E, but E is **not** in position 4.
2. The remaining letters to test are among the still-allowed consonants and vowels: C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the still-allowed vowels: I (since A and O are out, and E is already handled).

A good next step is to test new common letters while keeping E in the last position.  
I’ll try “MICE” but it’s only 4 letters, so instead I’ll use “MIDGE” – but G and D are already ruled out.  
Let’s pick a word that introduces new common letters and keeps E in position 5: “MENUS” – but S is out.  
“LINER” – R is out.  
“MINCE” – C is still allowed, and M, I, N are new.  
So “MINCE” is a valid candidate: it uses M, I, N, C (all new) and ends with E.

Another check: none of A, R, O, S, T, U, B, D appear in “MINCE”, and it’s 5 letters.  
Therefore, “MINCE” is a good next guess.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good first guess should use some of these letters while avoiding repetition to test as many letters as possible.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repetitions. This will help us quickly identify which of these common letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose” we now know:

- The letter E is in the secret word and is in the 5th position (last letter).
- The letters A, R, O, S are **not** in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and contains none of A, R, O, S.

Next I want to test new common letters that haven’t been ruled out yet.  
The remaining high-frequency letters are: T, I, N, L, C, D, U, Y, H, M, K, B, F, G, etc.

A good second guess should:
1. Keep the known E in position 5.
2. Introduce as many new common letters as possible.
3. Avoid the already-eliminated A R O S.

One such candidate is “TINCE”:
- T, I, N, C are all new letters.
- C is placed before E, which is allowed since we only know E is in position 5.
- None of T, I, N, C were ruled out by previous feedback.

This should give us more information about which of these new letters are present and their positions.

The feedback on “tinced” says “Model answer is not five letters,” so the intended word is not “tinced” and must still be five letters.  
We already know:
- The secret word ends with E (position 5).
- Letters A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

I need a valid 5-letter word that ends with E and contains none of A, R, O, S.  
Common endings for such words include:
- -E (already known at position 5)
- -LE, -PE, -TE, -BE, -GE, etc.

I’ll try “TIGER”:
- Ends with R, but R is already eliminated, so this is invalid.
Next, “TUBED” – contains U, B, E, D. None of A, R, O, S appear, and it ends with E.  
This seems like a good test word to check for U, B, D.

Another candidate could be “MUTER”, but R is eliminated.  
“CUBED” is also valid, but let’s go with “TUBED” to test U, B, D.

Final choice: “TUBED”.

Current knowledge:

- E is in the word and is in position 5 (because in mince, E was in position 5 and got ✓).
- N is in position 3 (because in mince, N was in position 3 and got ✓).
- I is in the word but NOT in position 2 (because in mince, I was in position 2 and got -).
- Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, S, T, U, B, D, M, C.

So far the pattern is:
_ _ N _ E

With I somewhere in the word (but not position 2), and remaining letters to test from the still-allowed set: F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Has N in position 3.
3. Contains I somewhere (but not position 2).
4. Uses only allowed letters.

Possible positions for I:
- Position 1
- Position 4 (but position 4 is before E, so I could be there)
- Position 2 is ruled out
- Position 3 is N, so that's taken

Let's try to find a word with this pattern. One candidate is ""HINSE"" but S is ruled out. Another is ""PINNE"" but P and N are allowed, but we need to check if it's valid. Wait, ""PINNE"" might not be a common word.

A better candidate is ""LINER"" but R is ruled out. Next, ""WINCE"" - C is ruled out. ""GINER"" - R is ruled out. ""FINER"" - R is ruled out.

Let's try ""PINE"" - too short. ""VINEL"" - doesn't end with E. ""MINTE"" - M is ruled out. ""LINED"" - D is ruled out. ""FINED"" - D is ruled out.

Wait, we need to keep E in position 5 and N in position 3. Let's try ""KINFE"" - but F is allowed and K is allowed. However, this might not be a valid word.

Another approach: since I must appear somewhere, and positions 2 and 3 are partially filled, let's try a word where I is in position 1. For example: ""INSET"" - but S and T are ruled out. ""INGLE"" - G and L are allowed, ends with E. Let's check: I in position 1, N in position 2 - but we know N is in position 3. So ""INGLE"" is I N G L E - but N is supposed to be in position 3, so this doesn't fit.

Wait, the pattern is _ _ N _ E. So positions 1 and 2 are open, position 3 is N, positions 4 and 5 are open but 5 must be E.

I must be in position 1 or 4. Let's try position 1: I _ N _ E. Possible words: ""INANE"" - A is ruled out. ""INSET"" - S and T ruled out. ""INGLE"" - as above, doesn't fit pattern.

Now try I in position 4: _ _ N I E. Possible words: ""GUNIE"" - but G, U, N, I, E - U is ruled out. ""FINIE"" - F, I, N, I, E - but I would be in position 2 and 4, which might not be allowed (double I). 

""LINIE"" - L, I, N, I, E - same issue. 

""PINIE"" - P, I, N, I, E - same.

""VINIE"" - V, I, N, I, E - same.

""WINIE"" - W, I, N, I, E - same.

""XINIE"" - X, I, N, I, E - same.

""YINIE"" - Y, I, N, I, E - same.

""ZINIE"" - Z, I, N, I, E - same.

Hmm, these all have double I. Let's try without double I: _ _ N I E.

""KNIFE"" - K, N, I, F, E - but F is allowed, K is allowed. This fits: K _ N I E. 

Check letters: K (allowed), N (position 3, ✓), I (position 4, allowed here), F (allowed), E (position 5, ✓). 

No ruled-out letters are used. ""KNIFE"" is a valid English word.

Therefore, the next guess should be ""KNIFE"".

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose” we now know:

- The letter E is in the secret word and is in the 5th position (last letter).
- The letters A, R, O, S are **not** in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and contains none of A, R, O, S.

Next I want to test new common letters that haven’t been ruled out yet.  
The remaining high-frequency letters are: T, I, N, L, C, D, U, Y, H, M, K, B, F, G, etc.

A good second guess should:
1. Keep the known E in position 5.
2. Introduce as many new common letters as possible.
3. Avoid the already-eliminated A R O S.

One such candidate is “TINCE”:
- T, I, N, C are all new letters.
- C is placed before E, which is allowed since we only know E is in position 5.
- None of T, I, N, C were ruled out by previous feedback.

This should give us more information about which of these new letters are present and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: tinced -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The feedback on “tinced” says “Model answer is not five letters,” so the intended word is not “tinced” and must still be five letters.  
We already know:
- The secret word ends with E (position 5).
- Letters A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

I need a valid 5-letter word that ends with E and contains none of A, R, O, S.  
Common endings for such words include:
- -E (already known at position 5)
- -LE, -PE, -TE, -BE, -GE, etc.

I’ll try “TIGER”:
- Ends with R, but R is already eliminated, so this is invalid.
Next, “TUBED” – contains U, B, E, D. None of A, R, O, S appear, and it ends with E.  
This seems like a good test word to check for U, B, D.

Another candidate could be “MUTER”, but R is eliminated.  
“CUBED” is also valid, but let’s go with “TUBED” to test U, B, D.

Final choice: “TUBED”.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: tinced -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 3: tubed -> FEEDBACK: T(x) U(x) B(x) E(-) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

- E is in the word, but NOT in position 5 (because in tubed, E was in position 4 and got “-” instead of “✓”).  
- Letters A, R, O, S, T, U, B, D are **not** in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word ends with E, but E is **not** in position 4.
2. The remaining letters to test are among the still-allowed consonants and vowels: C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the still-allowed vowels: I (since A and O are out, and E is already handled).

A good next step is to test new common letters while keeping E in the last position.  
I’ll try “MICE” but it’s only 4 letters, so instead I’ll use “MIDGE” – but G and D are already ruled out.  
Let’s pick a word that introduces new common letters and keeps E in position 5: “MENUS” – but S is out.  
“LINER” – R is out.  
“MINCE” – C is still allowed, and M, I, N are new.  
So “MINCE” is a valid candidate: it uses M, I, N, C (all new) and ends with E.

Another check: none of A, R, O, S, T, U, B, D appear in “MINCE”, and it’s 5 letters.  
Therefore, “MINCE” is a good next guess.

Guess 4: mince -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(-) N(✓) C(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Current knowledge:

- E is in the word and is in position 5 (because in mince, E was in position 5 and got ✓).
- N is in position 3 (because in mince, N was in position 3 and got ✓).
- I is in the word but NOT in position 2 (because in mince, I was in position 2 and got -).
- Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, S, T, U, B, D, M, C.

So far the pattern is:
_ _ N _ E

With I somewhere in the word (but not position 2), and remaining letters to test from the still-allowed set: F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Has N in position 3.
3. Contains I somewhere (but not position 2).
4. Uses only allowed letters.

Possible positions for I:
- Position 1
- Position 4 (but position 4 is before E, so I could be there)
- Position 2 is ruled out
- Position 3 is N, so that's taken

Let's try to find a word with this pattern. One candidate is ""HINSE"" but S is ruled out. Another is ""PINNE"" but P and N are allowed, but we need to check if it's valid. Wait, ""PINNE"" might not be a common word.

A better candidate is ""LINER"" but R is ruled out. Next, ""WINCE"" - C is ruled out. ""GINER"" - R is ruled out. ""FINER"" - R is ruled out.

Let's try ""PINE"" - too short. ""VINEL"" - doesn't end with E. ""MINTE"" - M is ruled out. ""LINED"" - D is ruled out. ""FINED"" - D is ruled out.

Wait, we need to keep E in position 5 and N in position 3. Let's try ""KINFE"" - but F is allowed and K is allowed. However, this might not be a valid word.

Another approach: since I must appear somewhere, and positions 2 and 3 are partially filled, let's try a word where I is in position 1. For example: ""INSET"" - but S and T are ruled out. ""INGLE"" - G and L are allowed, ends with E. Let's check: I in position 1, N in position 2 - but we know N is in position 3. So ""INGLE"" is I N G L E - but N is supposed to be in position 3, so this doesn't fit.

Wait, the pattern is _ _ N _ E. So positions 1 and 2 are open, position 3 is N, positions 4 and 5 are open but 5 must be E.

I must be in position 1 or 4. Let's try position 1: I _ N _ E. Possible words: ""INANE"" - A is ruled out. ""INSET"" - S and T ruled out. ""INGLE"" - as above, doesn't fit pattern.

Now try I in position 4: _ _ N I E. Possible words: ""GUNIE"" - but G, U, N, I, E - U is ruled out. ""FINIE"" - F, I, N, I, E - but I would be in position 2 and 4, which might not be allowed (double I). 

""LINIE"" - L, I, N, I, E - same issue. 

""PINIE"" - P, I, N, I, E - same.

""VINIE"" - V, I, N, I, E - same.

""WINIE"" - W, I, N, I, E - same.

""XINIE"" - X, I, N, I, E - same.

""YINIE"" - Y, I, N, I, E - same.

""ZINIE"" - Z, I, N, I, E - same.

Hmm, these all have double I. Let's try without double I: _ _ N I E.

""KNIFE"" - K, N, I, F, E - but F is allowed, K is allowed. This fits: K _ N I E. 

Check letters: K (allowed), N (position 3, ✓), I (position 4, allowed here), F (allowed), E (position 5, ✓). 

No ruled-out letters are used. ""KNIFE"" is a valid English word.

Therefore, the next guess should be ""KNIFE"".

Current knowledge:

1. E is definitely in position 5 (✓ in mince and knife).
2. N is in the word but NOT in position 3 (N got ✓ in mince but - in knife).  
   Therefore N must be in position 2 or 4.
3. I is in the word but NOT in position 4 (I got - in mince and knife).  
   So I must be in position 1 or 3.
4. Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, S, T, U, B, D, M, C, K, F.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that satisfies:
- N in position 2 or 4
- I in position 1 or 3
- No ruled-out letters

Let’s list possible patterns:

Pattern 1: I _ N _ E   (I in 1, N in 3) – but N must be in 2 or 4, so N in 3 is invalid (must be in 2 or 4).  
Pattern 2: I _ _ N E   (I in 1, N in 4)
Pattern 3: _ I N _ E   (I in 2, N in 3) – N must be in 2 or 4, so N in 3 is invalid.
Pattern 4: _ I _ N E   (I in 2, N in 4)

So valid patterns are:
- I _ _ N E
- _ I _ N E

Allowed remaining letters: G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (but K and F are already ruled out, so exclude K).

Let’s try pattern I _ _ N E:
Need a letter in position 3 that is allowed and makes a valid word.  
I G G N E – not valid.  
I N N E – too short.  
I L L N E – not valid.  
No obvious valid word here.

Now pattern _ I _ N E:
Position 1: any allowed consonant except ruled-out ones.  
Position 3: any allowed consonant except ruled-out ones.

Try L I N E – too short.  
P I N E – too short.  
V I N E – too short.  
G I N E – too short.  
W I N E – too short.  
We need 5 letters.

Valid 5-letter words ending in NE with I in position 2:
- G I V E N – ends with N, not E.  
- L I N E – 4 letters.  
- P I N E – 4 letters.  
- H I N E – 4 letters.  
- V I N E – 4 letters.  

Wait, we need _ I _ N E – so position 4 is N, 5 is E.

Valid word: L I G N E – but LIGNE is not common.  
P I G N E – PIGNE not a word.  
V I G N E – VIGNE not a word.  
H I G N E – HIGNE not a word.  
W I G N E – WIGNE not a word.  

Try another consonant in position 3:  
L I S N E – S is ruled out.  
P I S N E – S ruled out.  
V I S N E – S ruled out.  

Try G in position 3:  
L I G N E – not valid.  
P I G N E – not valid.  
V I G N E – not valid.  

Try H in position 3:  
L I H N E – not valid.  

Try Y in position 3:  
L I Y N E – not valid.  

Try J in position 3:  
L I J N E – not valid.  

Try Q in position 3:  
L I Q N E – not valid.  

Try X in position 3:  
L I X N E – not valid.  

Try Z in position 3:  
L I Z N E – not valid.  

Try P in position 1 and G in position 3:  
P I G N E – not valid.  

Try V in position 1 and G in position 3:  
V I G N E – not valid.  

Try W in position 1 and G in position 3:  
W I G N E – not valid.  

Try Y in position 1 and G in position 3:  
Y I G N E – not valid.  

Try Z in position 1 and G in position 3:  
Z I G N E – not valid.  

Hmm, let’s try different consonants.  
Valid word: L I N E – too short.  
We need _ I _ N E.

Valid English word: L I N E – no.  
Valid word: P I N E – no.  
Valid word: V I N E – no.  

Wait, let’s try G in position 1, I in position 2, N in position 4, E in 5:  
G I _ N E – need a letter in position 3.  
G I V N E – GIVNE not a word.  
G I R N E – R ruled out.  
G I T N E – T ruled out.  
G I S N E – S ruled out.  
G I D N E – D ruled out.  
G I B N E – B ruled out.  
G I H N E – not a word.  

Try H in position 1:  
H I _ N E – H I V N E – not a word.  

Try J in position 1:  
J I _ N E – J I V N E – not a word.  

Try P in position 1:  
P I V N E – not a word.  

Try V in position 1:  
V I G N E – not a word.  

Try W in position 1:  
W I G N E – not a word.  

Try Y in position 1:  
Y I G N E – not a word.  

Try Z in position 1:  
Z I G N E – not a word.  

Let me reconsider. Maybe N is in position 2.  
Then pattern: _ N I _ E  
But I must be in position 1 or 3. If N is in 2, then I could be in 3.  
So pattern: _ N I _ E  

Valid words with _ N I _ E:  
B N I N E – B and N are allowed, but is it a word?  
C N I N E – C ruled out.  
D N I N E – D ruled out.  
F N I N E – F ruled out.  
G N I N E – G allowed, N in 2, I in 3, E in 5.  
G N I N E – is this a valid word? ""GNINE"" is not valid.  

H N I N E – not valid.  
J N I N E – not valid.  
K N I N E – K ruled out.  
L N I N E – not valid.  
M N I N E – M ruled out.

Z N I N E – not valid.  

Another pattern: I N _ _ E – but N must be in 2 or 4. If N is in 2, then I in 1, N in 2, but we need _ N I _ E.  

Wait, let me list all possible positions:

N must be in 2 or 4.  
I must be in 1 or 3.  

Case 1: N in 2, I in 1 → I N _ _ E  
Need letters in 3 and 4 from allowed set (G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).

INGLE – G allowed, L allowed. ""INGLE"" is valid (variant spelling of ""ingle"").  
But we have to check if it fits all constraints:  
I in 1, N in 2, G in 3, L in 4, E in 5.  
Letters used: I, N, G, L, E – none of which are ruled out.  
This seems valid.

Case 2: N in 4, I in 1 → I _ _ N E  
Need letters in 2 and 3 from allowed set.  
Valid words: I G I N E – not valid.  
I L I N E – not valid.  
I V I N E – not valid.  
I G N I N E – too long.  

No obvious valid words in this case.

Therefore, the only valid candidate is ""INGLE"".

Check if ""INGLE"" has been tried: no, it wasn’t in previous guesses.  
So ""INGLE"" is the next logical guess.

<guess>ingle</guess>",ingle,"Current knowledge:

1. E is definitely in position 5 (✓ in mince and knife).
2. N is in the word but NOT in position 3 (N got ✓ in mince but - in knife).  
   Therefore N must be in position 2 or 4.
3. I is in the word but NOT in position 4 (I got - in mince and knife).  
   So I must be in position 1 or 3.
4. Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, S, T, U, B, D, M, C, K, F.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that satisfies:
- N in position 2 or 4
- I in position 1 or 3
- No ruled-out letters

Let’s list possible patterns:

Pattern 1: I _ N _ E   (I in 1, N in 3) – but N must be in 2 or 4, so N in 3 is invalid (must be in 2 or 4).  
Pattern 2: I _ _ N E   (I in 1, N in 4)
Pattern 3: _ I N _ E   (I in 2, N in 3) – N must be in 2 or 4, so N in 3 is invalid.
Pattern 4: _ I _ N E   (I in 2, N in 4)

So valid patterns are:
- I _ _ N E
- _ I _ N E

Allowed remaining letters: G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (but K and F are already ruled out, so exclude K).

Let’s try pattern I _ _ N E:
Need a letter in position 3 that is allowed and makes a valid word.  
I G G N E – not valid.  
I N N E – too short.  
I L L N E – not valid.  
No obvious valid word here.

Now pattern _ I _ N E:
Position 1: any allowed consonant except ruled-out ones.  
Position 3: any allowed consonant except ruled-out ones.

Try L I N E – too short.  
P I N E – too short.  
V I N E – too short.  
G I N E – too short.  
W I N E – too short.  
We need 5 letters.

Valid 5-letter words ending in NE with I in position 2:
- G I V E N – ends with N, not E.  
- L I N E – 4 letters.  
- P I N E – 4 letters.  
- H I N E – 4 letters.  
- V I N E – 4 letters.  

Wait, we need _ I _ N E – so position 4 is N, 5 is E.

Valid word: L I G N E – but LIGNE is not common.  
P I G N E – PIGNE not a word.  
V I G N E – VIGNE not a word.  
H I G N E – HIGNE not a word.  
W I G N E – WIGNE not a word.  

Try another consonant in position 3:  
L I S N E – S is ruled out.  
P I S N E – S ruled out.  
V I S N E – S ruled out.  

Try G in position 3:  
L I G N E – not valid.  
P I G N E – not valid.  
V I G N E – not valid.  

Try H in position 3:  
L I H N E – not valid.  

Try Y in position 3:  
L I Y N E – not valid.  

Try J in position 3:  
L I J N E – not valid.  

Try Q in position 3:  
L I Q N E – not valid.  

Try X in position 3:  
L I X N E – not valid.  

Try Z in position 3:  
L I Z N E – not valid.  

Try P in position 1 and G in position 3:  
P I G N E – not valid.  

Try V in position 1 and G in position 3:  
V I G N E – not valid.  

Try W in position 1 and G in position 3:  
W I G N E – not valid.  

Try Y in position 1 and G in position 3:  
Y I G N E – not valid.  

Try Z in position 1 and G in position 3:  
Z I G N E – not valid.  

Hmm, let’s try different consonants.  
Valid word: L I N E – too short.  
We need _ I _ N E.

Valid English word: L I N E – no.  
Valid word: P I N E – no.  
Valid word: V I N E – no.  

Wait, let’s try G in position 1, I in position 2, N in position 4, E in 5:  
G I _ N E – need a letter in position 3.  
G I V N E – GIVNE not a word.  
G I R N E – R ruled out.  
G I T N E – T ruled out.  
G I S N E – S ruled out.  
G I D N E – D ruled out.  
G I B N E – B ruled out.  
G I H N E – not a word.  

Try H in position 1:  
H I _ N E – H I V N E – not a word.  

Try J in position 1:  
J I _ N E – J I V N E – not a word.  

Try P in position 1:  
P I V N E – not a word.  

Try V in position 1:  
V I G N E – not a word.  

Try W in position 1:  
W I G N E – not a word.  

Try Y in position 1:  
Y I G N E – not a word.  

Try Z in position 1:  
Z I G N E – not a word.  

Let me reconsider. Maybe N is in position 2.  
Then pattern: _ N I _ E  
But I must be in position 1 or 3. If N is in 2, then I could be in 3.  
So pattern: _ N I _ E  

Valid words with _ N I _ E:  
B N I N E – B and N are allowed, but is it a word?  
C N I N E – C ruled out.  
D N I N E – D ruled out.  
F N I N E – F ruled out.  
G N I N E – G allowed, N in 2, I in 3, E in 5.  
G N I N E – is this a valid word? ""GNINE"" is not valid.  

H N I N E – not valid.  
J N I N E – not valid.  
K N I N E – K ruled out.  
L N I N E – not valid.  
M N I N E – M ruled out.  
P N I N E – not valid.  
Q N I N E – not valid.  
R N I N E – R ruled out.  
S N I N E – S ruled out.  
T N I N E – T ruled out.  
U N I N E – U ruled out.  
V N I N E – not valid.  
W N I N E – not valid.  
X N I N E – not valid.  
Y N I N E – not valid.  
Z N I N E – not valid.  

Another pattern: I N _ _ E – but N must be in 2 or 4. If N is in 2, then I in 1, N in 2, but we need _ N I _ E.  

Wait, let me list all possible positions:

N must be in 2 or 4.  
I must be in 1 or 3.  

Case 1: N in 2, I in 1 → I N _ _ E  
Need letters in 3 and 4 from allowed set (G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).  
Valid 5-letter words starting with IN and ending with E:  
INANE – A ruled out.  
INSET – S, T ruled out.  
INGLE – G allowed, L allowed. ""INGLE"" is valid (variant spelling of ""ingle"").  
But we have to check if it fits all constraints:  
I in 1, N in 2, G in 3, L in 4, E in 5.  
Letters used: I, N, G, L, E – none of which are ruled out.  
This seems valid.

Case 2: N in 4, I in 1 → I _ _ N E  
Need letters in 2 and 3 from allowed set.  
Valid words: I G I N E – not valid.  
I L I N E – not valid.  
I V I N E – not valid.  
I G N I N E – too long.  

No obvious valid words in this case.

Therefore, the only valid candidate is ""INGLE"".

Check if ""INGLE"" has been tried: no, it wasn’t in previous guesses.  
So ""INGLE"" is the next logical guess.",Guess 6: ingle -> FEEDBACK: I(-) N(-) G(-) L(x) E(✓),FAIL
