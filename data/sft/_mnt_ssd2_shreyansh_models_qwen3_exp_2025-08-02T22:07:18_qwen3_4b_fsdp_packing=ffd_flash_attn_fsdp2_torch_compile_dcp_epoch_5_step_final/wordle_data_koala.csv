For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. Among these, I'll pick a word that contains several common vowels and consonants to help narrow down possibilities quickly. 

A good choice is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A, O, E (all very common vowels)
- R, S (common consonants)
This gives me a broad coverage of frequently used letters in 5-letter words.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is somewhere other than position 1)
- R is NOT in the word
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (so O is somewhere other than position 3)
- S is NOT in the word
- E is NOT in the word

So we know:
- Letters that are definitely in the word: A, O
- Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: R, S, E

We need a 5-letter word that contains both A and O (in positions other than 1 and 3 respectively), and does not contain R, S, or E.

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: A, O (already confirmed), plus maybe I or U.

I'll try to place A and O in new positions and use other common letters. A good candidate is ""ADOPT"":
- Contains A and O
- A is in position 2 (new position)
- O is in position 3 (but this is the same position as before, which was marked wrong, so this might not be good)

Let me rethink: O was in position 3 and marked wrong, so O should not be in position 3. A was in position 1 and marked wrong, so A should not be in position 1.

Another candidate: ""COATI"" - but this has O in position 2 (new) and A in position 3 (new), but O was in position 3 before, so position 2 is fine. However, T and I are possible, but I'm not sure.

Better candidate: ""ADOPT"" has O in position 3 again, which is bad.

Next: ""CANTO"" - has O in position 5 (new), A in position 2 (new), but contains T and N which are good, but also has O in 5 which is new. However, this has O in 5, which is new.

But wait, ""CANTO"" has O in position 5, which is new (was 3 before), and A in position 2 (was 1 before), so this is good.

But ""CANTO"" has O in 5, A in 2, and uses C, N, T. But this might not be optimal.

Alternative: ""PACED"" - but E is excluded.

""PLAID"" - has A in 2, O not present.

""FOCAL"" - has O in 2, A in 4, uses F, C, L.

But ""FOCAL"" has O in 2 (was 3 before), A in 4 (was 1 before), and uses F, C, L. This seems good.

But let me think of a word that uses A and O in new positions and common letters. ""CANTO"" seems good, but let me check ""PLAID"" - no O.

""PAINT"" - no O.

""COAST"" - has S (excluded).

""FOCAL"" seems better: O in 2, A in 4, plus F, C, L.

But let me think of a word with O not in 3 or 5, and A not in 1. ""ADOPT"" is bad (O in 3 again).

""CONGA"" - has O in 2, A in 5, uses C, N, G. This seems good: O in 2 (was 3), A in 5 (was 1), and uses new consonants C, N, G.

This seems like a strong choice.

Based on the feedback that A and O are in the word but in wrong positions, and R, S, E are not in the word, I'll try a new word that places A and O in different positions while using fresh consonants.

From the new feedback on CONGA:

- N is NOT in the word (x)
- G is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word AND in the correct position (position 5) (✓)

So we now know:
- Exact placement: _ O _ _ A
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, S, E, C, N, G
- Still need to find letters for positions 1, 3, 4 from remaining common letters: B, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Good remaining consonants to try: B, D, F, H, L, M, P, T, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are already placed)

Let's pick a word that fits _ O _ _ A, uses new letters, and covers common possibilities. Trying to include a new vowel (I or U) and common consonants.

A good candidate is ""FOILA"":
- F, I, L are new letters
- O and A are in correct positions
But ""FOILA"" uses F, O, I, L, A - all new letters except O and A which are confirmed.

However, ""FOILA"" might not be common. Another option is ""HOMIA"" but this is less common.

Better common words: ""MOLAR"" - but R is excluded.
""POLAR"" - R is excluded.
""BOILA"" - uses B, O, I, L, A - all new letters except O and A.

""BOILA"" seems good - uses B, O, I, L, A with O in 2 and A in 5 confirmed correct.

But let me check ""TOLANA"" - too long.

Another common word: ""FOCAL"" - but C is excluded.

""PODIA"" - D is new, but P, O, I, A - but D is new.

""PODIA"" uses P, O, D, I, A - O and A correct positions, D and P and I new.

This seems strong.

But ""BOILA"" is also valid. Between these, ""BOILA"" uses B, O, I, L, A - all new letters except O and A.

I'll go with ""BOILA"" as it's a common word and tests new letters.
</think>

Based on the feedback:
- O is correctly placed in position 2
- A is correctly placed in position 5
- Letters to avoid: R, S, E, C, N, G

- Still need to find letters for positions 1, 3, 4 from remaining common letters: B, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Good remaining consonants to try: B, D, F, H, L, M, P, T, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are already placed)

Let's pick a word that fits _ O _ _ A, uses new letters, and covers common possibilities. Trying to include a new vowel (I or U) and common consonants.

A good candidate is ""FOILA"":
- F, I, L are new letters
- O and A are in correct positions
But ""FOILA"" uses F, O, I, L, A - all new letters except O and A which are confirmed.

However, ""FOILA"" might not be common. Another option is ""HOMIA"" but this is less common.

Better common words: ""MOLAR"" - but R is excluded.
""POLAR"" - R is excluded.
""BOILA"" - uses B, O, I, L, A - all new letters except O and A.

""BOILA"" seems good - uses B, O, I, L, A with O in 2 and A in 5 confirmed correct.

But let me check ""TOLANA"" - too long.

Another common word: ""FOCAL"" - but C is excluded.

""PODIA"" - D is new, but P, O, I, A - but D is new.

""PODIA"" uses P, O, D, I, A - O and A correct positions, D and P and I new.

This seems strong.

But ""BOILA"" is also valid. Between these, ""BOILA"" uses B, O, I, L, A - all new letters except O and A.

I'll go with ""BOILA"" as it's a common word and tests new letters.Based on the feedback:
- O is correctly placed in position 2
- A is correctly placed in position 5
- Letters to avoid: R, S, E, C, N, G

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. Among these, I'll pick a word that contains several common vowels and consonants to help narrow down possibilities quickly. 

A good choice is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A, O, E (all very common vowels)
- R, S (common consonants)
This gives me a broad coverage of frequently used letters in 5-letter words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is somewhere other than position 1)
- R is NOT in the word
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (so O is somewhere other than position 3)
- S is NOT in the word
- E is NOT in the word

So we know:
- Letters that are definitely in the word: A, O
- Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: R, S, E

We need a 5-letter word that contains both A and O (in positions other than 1 and 3 respectively), and does not contain R, S, or E.

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: A, O (already confirmed), plus maybe I or U.

I'll try to place A and O in new positions and use other common letters. A good candidate is ""ADOPT"":
- Contains A and O
- A is in position 2 (new position)
- O is in position 3 (but this is the same position as before, which was marked wrong, so this might not be good)

Let me rethink: O was in position 3 and marked wrong, so O should not be in position 3. A was in position 1 and marked wrong, so A should not be in position 1.

Another candidate: ""COATI"" - but this has O in position 2 (new) and A in position 3 (new), but O was in position 3 before, so position 2 is fine. However, T and I are possible, but I'm not sure.

Better candidate: ""ADOPT"" has O in position 3 again, which is bad.

Next: ""CANTO"" - has O in position 5 (new), A in position 2 (new), but contains T and N which are good, but also has O in 5 which is new. However, this has O in 5, which is new.

But wait, ""CANTO"" has O in position 5, which is new (was 3 before), and A in position 2 (was 1 before), so this is good.

But ""CANTO"" has O in 5, A in 2, and uses C, N, T. But this might not be optimal.

Alternative: ""PACED"" - but E is excluded.

""PLAID"" - has A in 2, O not present.

""FOCAL"" - has O in 2, A in 4, uses F, C, L.

But ""FOCAL"" has O in 2 (was 3 before), A in 4 (was 1 before), and uses F, C, L. This seems good.

But let me think of a word that uses A and O in new positions and common letters. ""CANTO"" seems good, but let me check ""PLAID"" - no O.

""PAINT"" - no O.

""COAST"" - has S (excluded).

""FOCAL"" seems better: O in 2, A in 4, plus F, C, L.

But let me think of a word with O not in 3 or 5, and A not in 1. ""ADOPT"" is bad (O in 3 again).

""CONGA"" - has O in 2, A in 5, uses C, N, G. This seems good: O in 2 (was 3), A in 5 (was 1), and uses new consonants C, N, G.

This seems like a strong choice.Based on the feedback that A and O are in the word but in wrong positions, and R, S, E are not in the word, I'll try a new word that places A and O in different positions while using fresh consonants.

Better common words: ""MOLAR"" - but R is excluded.
""POLAR"" - R is excluded.
""BOILA"" - uses B, O, I, L, A - all new letters except O and A.

""BOILA"" seems good - uses B, O, I, L, A with O in 2 and A in 5 confirmed correct.

But let me check ""TOLANA"" - too long.

Another common word: ""FOCAL"" - but C is excluded.

""PODIA"" - D is new, but P, O, I, A - but D is new.

""PODIA"" uses P, O, D, I, A - O and A correct positions, D and P and I new.

This seems strong.

But ""BOILA"" is also valid. Between these, ""BOILA"" uses B, O, I, L, A - all new letters except O and A.

I'll go with ""BOILA"" as it's a common word and tests new letters.Based on the feedback:
- O is correctly placed in position 2
- A is correctly placed in position 5
- Letters to avoid: R, S, E, C, N, G

I'll try a word that fits _ O _ _ A and uses new letters.

From the latest feedback on BOILA:
- B is NOT in the word (x)
- O is in the word and already correctly placed in position 2 (✓)
- I is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word and correctly placed in position 4 (✓)
- A is in the word and already correctly placed in position 5 (✓)

So the pattern is now: _ O _ L A

Letters we know are NOT in the word: R, S, E, C, N, G, B, I

Remaining consonants to try: D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
Remaining vowels to try: U (since A and O are already placed)

We need a 5-letter word that fits: _ O _ L A and uses only the remaining letters.

Possible candidates:
- DOULA: D, O, U, L, A - uses U (new vowel) and D (new consonant)
- FOLLA: F, O, L, L, A - but L is already in position 4, so double L might not be needed
- HOMLA: H, O, M, L, A - uses H and M
- TOLLA: T, O, L, L, A - similar to above

""DOULA"" seems the best as it introduces a new vowel (U) and a new consonant (D) while fitting the pattern _ O _ L A.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. Among these, I'll pick a word that contains several common vowels and consonants to help narrow down possibilities quickly. 

A good choice is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A, O, E (all very common vowels)
- R, S (common consonants)
This gives me a broad coverage of frequently used letters in 5-letter words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is somewhere other than position 1)
- R is NOT in the word
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (so O is somewhere other than position 3)
- S is NOT in the word
- E is NOT in the word

So we know:
- Letters that are definitely in the word: A, O
- Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: R, S, E

We need a 5-letter word that contains both A and O (in positions other than 1 and 3 respectively), and does not contain R, S, or E.

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: A, O (already confirmed), plus maybe I or U.

I'll try to place A and O in new positions and use other common letters. A good candidate is ""ADOPT"":
- Contains A and O
- A is in position 2 (new position)
- O is in position 3 (but this is the same position as before, which was marked wrong, so this might not be good)

Let me rethink: O was in position 3 and marked wrong, so O should not be in position 3. A was in position 1 and marked wrong, so A should not be in position 1.

Another candidate: ""COATI"" - but this has O in position 2 (new) and A in position 3 (new), but O was in position 3 before, so position 2 is fine. However, T and I are possible, but I'm not sure.

Better candidate: ""ADOPT"" has O in position 3 again, which is bad.

Next: ""CANTO"" - has O in position 5 (new), A in position 2 (new), but contains T and N which are good, but also has O in 5 which is new. However, this has O in 5, which is new.

But wait, ""CANTO"" has O in position 5, which is new (was 3 before), and A in position 2 (was 1 before), so this is good.

But ""CANTO"" has O in 5, A in 2, and uses C, N, T. But this might not be optimal.

Alternative: ""PACED"" - but E is excluded.

""PLAID"" - has A in 2, O not present.

""FOCAL"" - has O in 2, A in 4, uses F, C, L.

But ""FOCAL"" has O in 2 (was 3 before), A in 4 (was 1 before), and uses F, C, L. This seems good.

But let me think of a word that uses A and O in new positions and common letters. ""CANTO"" seems good, but let me check ""PLAID"" - no O.

""PAINT"" - no O.

""COAST"" - has S (excluded).

""FOCAL"" seems better: O in 2, A in 4, plus F, C, L.

But let me think of a word with O not in 3 or 5, and A not in 1. ""ADOPT"" is bad (O in 3 again).

""CONGA"" - has O in 2, A in 5, uses C, N, G. This seems good: O in 2 (was 3), A in 5 (was 1), and uses new consonants C, N, G.

This seems like a strong choice.Based on the feedback that A and O are in the word but in wrong positions, and R, S, E are not in the word, I'll try a new word that places A and O in different positions while using fresh consonants.

- O is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2) (✓)
- N is NOT in the word (x)
- G is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word AND in the correct position (position 5) (✓)

So we now know:
- Exact placement: _ O _ _ A
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, S, E, C, N, G
- Still need to find letters for positions 1, 3, 4 from remaining common letters: B, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Good remaining consonants to try: B, D, F, H, L, M, P, T, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are already placed)

Let's pick a word that fits _ O _ _ A, uses new letters, and covers common possibilities. Trying to include a new vowel (I or U) and common consonants.

A good candidate is ""FOILA"":
- F, I, L are new letters
- O and A are in correct positions
But ""FOILA"" uses F, O, I, L, A - all new letters except O and A which are confirmed.

However, ""FOILA"" might not be common. Another option is ""HOMIA"" but this is less common.

Better common words: ""MOLAR"" - but R is excluded.
""POLAR"" - R is excluded.
""BOILA"" - uses B, O, I, L, A - all new letters except O and A.

""BOILA"" seems good - uses B, O, I, L, A with O in 2 and A in 5 confirmed correct.

But let me check ""TOLANA"" - too long.

Another common word: ""FOCAL"" - but C is excluded.

""PODIA"" - D is new, but P, O, I, A - but D is new.

""PODIA"" uses P, O, D, I, A - O and A correct positions, D and P and I new.

This seems strong.

But ""BOILA"" is also valid. Between these, ""BOILA"" uses B, O, I, L, A - all new letters except O and A.

I'll go with ""BOILA"" as it's a common word and tests new letters.Based on the feedback:
- O is correctly placed in position 2
- A is correctly placed in position 5
- Letters to avoid: R, S, E, C, N, G

I'll try a word that fits _ O _ _ A and uses new letters.

Remaining consonants to try: D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
Remaining vowels to try: U (since A and O are already placed)

We need a 5-letter word that fits: _ O _ L A and uses only the remaining letters.

Possible candidates:
- DOULA: D, O, U, L, A - uses U (new vowel) and D (new consonant)
- FOLLA: F, O, L, L, A - but L is already in position 4, so double L might not be needed
- HOMLA: H, O, M, L, A - uses H and M
- TOLLA: T, O, L, L, A - similar to above

- T O _ L A → TOLLA (valid)

Among these, TOLLA and KOLLA are both valid, but TOLLA is more common. Let’s choose TOLLA.

(Note: If repeated letters are not allowed, KOLLA would be the only other option, but since the game never forbade repeats, and HOLLA/FOLLA are also valid, any of these could work. TOLLA is the safest common choice.)

From the feedback on TOLLA:
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- O is in the word and already correctly placed in position 2 (✓)
- L is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-) – so L must be in position 1
- L is in the word and already correctly placed in position 4 (✓)
- A is in the word and already correctly placed in position 5 (✓)

So the pattern is now: L O _ L A

Letters ruled out so far: R, S, E, C, N, G, B, I, D, U, T

We still need a letter for position 3. The remaining letters that haven’t been ruled out and are common in English include F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for 5-letter words that fit L O _ L A:

- LOFLA – not a word
- LOHLA – not a word
- LOKLA – not a word
- LOMLA – not a word
- LOPLA – not a word
- LOWLA – not a word
- LOVLA – not a word

Wait, let’s double-check common words. The only valid English word that fits L O _ L A is:

- L O W L A – but that’s “lowla,” which isn’t recognized.
- L O V L A – “lovla,” invalid.
- L O M L A – “lomla,” invalid.

Actually, the valid word is “LOLLA,” but L is already in position 4 and we can’t have two L’s unless the game allows repeats. Since the game never forbade repeats, and L is already in position 4, we can try LOLLA.

But let’s confirm: LOLLA is a valid English word (a slang term for “police”). It fits the pattern L O L L A and uses L twice, which is allowed.

So the final guess is LOLLA.
