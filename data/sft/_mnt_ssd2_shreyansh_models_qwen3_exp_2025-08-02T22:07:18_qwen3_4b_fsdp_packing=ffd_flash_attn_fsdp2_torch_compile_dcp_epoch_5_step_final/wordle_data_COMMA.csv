For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll pick a word that uses several of these high-frequency letters in different positions to help narrow down possibilities quickly. ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters and tests vowels in multiple positions.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is not in position 1).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (so O is not in position 3).
- S is not in the word at all.
- E is not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: R, S, E
- Letters that ARE in the word but not yet positioned: A, O

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and O (with A not in position 1 and O not in position 3)
2. Does not contain R, S, E

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, etc.

Let's pick a word that places A and O in new positions and introduces new common letters. ""OATEN"" uses A and O in new spots and introduces T, N. However, E is already ruled out, so that's no good.

Next option: ""PAINT"" - but E is gone, and we need to test new letters. Wait, we already know E is gone, so we can ignore that.

Let's try ""PLAID"" - but D is less common, and we need to test more vowels.

Better choice: ""CLOUD"" - but we need A and O, and CLOUD has neither.

Wait, we must include both A and O. Let's try ""ADOPT"" - but P and T are new, and it places A in position 1, which is ruled out.

Next: ""COATI"" - but I is a vowel, and we need to test new consonants.

Actually, let's try ""TONAL"" - but O is in position 1, A in position 3, which is allowed since O wasn't in position 1 before and A wasn't in position 3 before. But O was in position 3 in arose, so O cannot be in position 3, but can be in position 1. Similarly, A was in position 1, so A cannot be in position 1 but can be elsewhere.

""TONAL"" has:
- T (new)
- O in position 2 (allowed)
- N (new)
- A in position 3 (allowed, since A was in position 1)
- L (new)

This seems good as it tests new letters while placing A and O in allowed positions.

But let me double-check:
- A cannot be in position 1 (correct, it was in position 1 in arose)
- O cannot be in position 3 (correct, it was in position 3 in arose)
All other positions are allowed.

""TONAL"" meets all constraints.

- O is in the word but in the wrong position (so O is not in position 3).
- S is not in the word at all.
- E is not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: R, S, E
- Letters that ARE in the word but not yet positioned: A, O

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and O (with A not in position 1 and O not in position 3)
2. Does not contain R, S, E

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, etc.

Let's pick a word that places A and O in new positions and introduces new common letters. ""OATEN"" uses A and O in new spots and introduces T, N. However, E is already ruled out, so that's no good.

Next option: ""PAINT"" - but E is gone, and we need to test new letters. Wait, we already know E is gone, so we can ignore that.

Let's try ""PLAID"" - but D is less common, and we need to test more vowels.

Better choice: ""CLOUD"" - but we need A and O, and CLOUD has neither.

Wait, we must include both A and O. Let's try ""ADOPT"" - but P and T are new, and it places A in position 1, which is ruled out.

Next: ""COATI"" - but I is a vowel, and we need to test new consonants.

Actually, let's try ""TONAL"" - but O is in position 1, A in position 3, which is allowed since O wasn't in position 1 before and A wasn't in position 3 before. But O was in position 3 in arose, so O cannot be in position 3, but can be in position 1. Similarly, A was in position 1, so A cannot be in position 1 but can be elsewhere.

""TONAL"" has:
- T (new)
- O in position 2 (allowed)
- N (new)
- A in position 3 (allowed, since A was in position 1)
- L (new)

This seems good as it tests new letters while placing A and O in allowed positions.

But let me double-check:
- A cannot be in position 1 (correct, it was in position 1 in arose)
- O cannot be in position 3 (correct, it was in position 3 in arose)
All other positions are allowed.

""TONAL"" meets all constraints.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: tonal -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(✓) N(x) A(-) L(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on ""tonal"":
- T is not in the word.
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- N is not in the word.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is not in position 4).
- L is not in the word.

So we now know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: R, S, E, T, N, L
- Letters that ARE in the word and in correct position: O in position 2
- Letters that ARE in the word but not yet positioned: A (cannot be in position 1 or 4)

Current constraints:
- Word must have O in position 2.
- Must contain A somewhere (positions 2,3,5 only; 2 is O, so positions 3 or 5).
- Cannot use: R, S, E, T, N, L
- Remaining common letters to try: C, D, F, G, H, I, M, P, U, V, W, Y

Let's pick a word that:
1. Has O in position 2.
2. Places A in position 3 or 5.
3. Uses new common consonants.

Option 1: O in 2, A in 3 → e.g., _ O A _ _
Option 2: O in 2, A in 5 → e.g., _ O _ _ A

Let's try option 1: _ O A _ _
Possible letters for positions 1,4,5 from remaining: C, D, F, G, H, I, M, P, U, V, W, Y

A good choice is ""COAXI"" but X is less common and I is a vowel. Let's try ""COBIA"" - but B is allowed, I is allowed. However, ""COBIA"" has B and I, but we need to test new consonants.

Better: ""FOCAL"" - but L is already excluded.

Next: ""POACH"" - but H and C are new, and A is in position 3. This fits:
- P (new)
- O (correct position 2)
- A (in word, wrong position in tonal, now in position 3)
- C (new)
- H (new)

This uses only allowed letters and positions.

Check:
- P, O, A, C, H - none are in the excluded list.
- O is in correct spot (position 2).
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since it was in position 4 in tonal and position 1 in arose).

Looks good.

From the new feedback on ""poach"":
- P is not in the word.
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is not in position 3).
- C is in the word but in the wrong position (so C is not in position 4).
- H is not in the word.

Summary of all constraints so far:
1. O is fixed in position 2.
2. Must contain A (not in positions 1, 3, 4) → A must be in position 5.
3. Must contain C (not in position 4) → C can be in positions 1, 3.
4. Excluded letters: R, S, E, T, N, L, P, H.
5. Remaining allowed letters: A, C, D, F, G, I, M, U, V, W, Y (plus any others not excluded).

Current word skeleton:
- Position 2: O
- Position 5: A
- Positions 1, 3, 4: to be filled with allowed letters, ensuring C is used (not in 4).

Possible C placements:
- C in position 1 → C O _ _ A
- C in position 3 → _ O C _ A

Let's explore both.

Option 1: C O _ _ A
Need two more letters for positions 3 and 4 from allowed set (D, F, G, I, M, U, V, W, Y).
Looking for common combinations: ""COFIA"" is invalid (F and I are okay, but ""COFIA"" isn't a word). ""COMGA"" isn't valid. ""COVIA"" isn't valid. ""COVYA"" isn't valid. Seems limited.

Option 2: _ O C _ A
Need letters for positions 1 and 4 from allowed set.
Looking for common patterns: ""FOC VA"" → ""FOC VA"" isn't a word. ""DOC MA"" → ""DO CMA"" isn't a word. ""GOC IA"" → ""GOC IA"" isn't a word. ""MOC VA"" → ""MOC VA"" isn't a word. ""WOC IA"" → ""WOC IA"" isn't a word.

Wait, let's try ""FOCAL"":
- F, O, C, A, L
But L is already excluded from feedback (L x in tonal).

Next, ""VOCAL"" - L excluded.

""FOC A"" needs another letter. ""FOC A"" isn't valid.

""DOC A"" isn't valid.

""ROC A"" - R excluded.

""XOC A"" - X not tested but uncommon.

""FOC A"" isn't valid.

""FOC A"" isn't valid.

Let me think of valid 5-letter words that fit:
- O in position 2
- A in position 5
- C must be in 1 or 3
- No excluded letters

Possible word: ""FOCAL"" - but L excluded.

""VOCAL"" - L excluded.

""WOCLA"" - not valid.

""GOCHA"" - H excluded.

""DOCA"" - too short.

""COBIA"" - B is allowed, I is allowed, but C is in position 1, O in 2, I in 3, A in 5, B in 4. But B wasn't tested yet, and this fits all constraints:
- C is in position 1 (allowed, since C was in position 4 in poach and marked as wrong position, so 1 is okay)
- O is in position 2 (correct)
- A is in position 5 (allowed, since it was in positions 1,3,4 in previous guesses)
- B and I are new letters, but we know the word must contain A, C, O, and other letters can be new.

But wait, we only know the word must contain A and C (from feedback), but could it contain other letters? Actually, from feedback we only know the word contains A and C (since they were marked as in the word), but could also contain other letters not yet tested.

However, in ""COBIA"":
- C in 1 (allowed)
- O in 2 (correct)
- B in 3 (new)
- I in 4 (new)
- A in 5 (allowed)

This seems valid. But let me check if there's a more straightforward word.

Another option: ""FOC IA"" - not valid.

""DOC IA"" - not valid.

""COG IA"" - not valid.

""COM IA"" - not valid.

""COV IA"" - not valid.

""COY IA"" - not valid.

""COG A"" - not valid.

""COB A"" - not valid.

""COBIA"" seems to be the best fit among possible combinations.

But let me think if there's a better word. ""FOCAL"" is invalid due to L. ""VOCAL"" invalid due to L. ""COBIA"" is valid but uses B and I.

Alternatively, ""COGMA"" - G and M are allowed, but ""COGMA"" isn't a word.

""COMGA"" - not a word.

""COVGA"" - not a word.

""COVIA"" - not a word.

""COYIA"" - not a word.

""COBIA"" seems to be the only valid word fitting the constraints. However, let me double-check:

Is ""COBIA"" a valid 5-letter word? Yes, it's a plural of ""cobia"" (a type of fish).

But let me see if there's a more common word. ""FOCAL"" is invalid, ""VOCAL"" invalid, ""DOICA"" (not a word).

Another approach: since C must be in 1 or 3, and we have _ O C _ A, let's try ""GOC A"" - no.

""DOC A"" - no.

""FOC A"" - no.

""BOC A"" - B is allowed, but ""BOC A"" isn't a word.

""COB A"" - no.

- O is locked in position 2.
- A must be in position 5 (cannot be 1,3,4).
- C must be used (was in position 4 in poach, so not 4; can be 1 or 3).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll pick a word that uses several of these high-frequency letters in different positions to help narrow down possibilities quickly. ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters and tests vowels in multiple positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is not in position 1).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (so O is not in position 3).
- S is not in the word at all.
- E is not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: R, S, E
- Letters that ARE in the word but not yet positioned: A, O

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and O (with A not in position 1 and O not in position 3)
2. Does not contain R, S, E

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, etc.

Let's pick a word that places A and O in new positions and introduces new common letters. ""OATEN"" uses A and O in new spots and introduces T, N. However, E is already ruled out, so that's no good.

Next option: ""PAINT"" - but E is gone, and we need to test new letters. Wait, we already know E is gone, so we can ignore that.

Let's try ""PLAID"" - but D is less common, and we need to test more vowels.

Better choice: ""CLOUD"" - but we need A and O, and CLOUD has neither.

Wait, we must include both A and O. Let's try ""ADOPT"" - but P and T are new, and it places A in position 1, which is ruled out.

Next: ""COATI"" - but I is a vowel, and we need to test new consonants.

Actually, let's try ""TONAL"" - but O is in position 1, A in position 3, which is allowed since O wasn't in position 1 before and A wasn't in position 3 before. But O was in position 3 in arose, so O cannot be in position 3, but can be in position 1. Similarly, A was in position 1, so A cannot be in position 1 but can be elsewhere.

""TONAL"" has:
- T (new)
- O in position 2 (allowed)
- N (new)
- A in position 3 (allowed, since A was in position 1)
- L (new)

This seems good as it tests new letters while placing A and O in allowed positions.

But let me double-check:
- A cannot be in position 1 (correct, it was in position 1 in arose)
- O cannot be in position 3 (correct, it was in position 3 in arose)
All other positions are allowed.

""TONAL"" meets all constraints.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: tonal -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(✓) N(x) A(-) L(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on ""tonal"":
- T is not in the word.
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- N is not in the word.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is not in position 4).
- L is not in the word.

So we now know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: R, S, E, T, N, L
- Letters that ARE in the word and in correct position: O in position 2
- Letters that ARE in the word but not yet positioned: A (cannot be in position 1 or 4)

Current constraints:
- Word must have O in position 2.
- Must contain A somewhere (positions 2,3,5 only; 2 is O, so positions 3 or 5).
- Cannot use: R, S, E, T, N, L
- Remaining common letters to try: C, D, F, G, H, I, M, P, U, V, W, Y

Let's pick a word that:
1. Has O in position 2.
2. Places A in position 3 or 5.
3. Uses new common consonants.

Option 1: O in 2, A in 3 → e.g., _ O A _ _
Option 2: O in 2, A in 5 → e.g., _ O _ _ A

Let's try option 1: _ O A _ _
Possible letters for positions 1,4,5 from remaining: C, D, F, G, H, I, M, P, U, V, W, Y

A good choice is ""COAXI"" but X is less common and I is a vowel. Let's try ""COBIA"" - but B is allowed, I is allowed. However, ""COBIA"" has B and I, but we need to test new consonants.

Better: ""FOCAL"" - but L is already excluded.

Next: ""POACH"" - but H and C are new, and A is in position 3. This fits:
- P (new)
- O (correct position 2)
- A (in word, wrong position in tonal, now in position 3)
- C (new)
- H (new)

This uses only allowed letters and positions.

Check:
- P, O, A, C, H - none are in the excluded list.
- O is in correct spot (position 2).
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since it was in position 4 in tonal and position 1 in arose).

Looks good.

Guess 3: poach -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) A(-) C(-) H(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on ""poach"":
- P is not in the word.
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is not in position 3).
- C is in the word but in the wrong position (so C is not in position 4).
- H is not in the word.

Summary of all constraints so far:
1. O is fixed in position 2.
2. Must contain A (not in positions 1, 3, 4) → A must be in position 5.
3. Must contain C (not in position 4) → C can be in positions 1, 3.
4. Excluded letters: R, S, E, T, N, L, P, H.
5. Remaining allowed letters: A, C, D, F, G, I, M, U, V, W, Y (plus any others not excluded).

Current word skeleton:
- Position 2: O
- Position 5: A
- Positions 1, 3, 4: to be filled with allowed letters, ensuring C is used (not in 4).

Possible C placements:
- C in position 1 → C O _ _ A
- C in position 3 → _ O C _ A

Let's explore both.

Option 1: C O _ _ A
Need two more letters for positions 3 and 4 from allowed set (D, F, G, I, M, U, V, W, Y).
Looking for common combinations: ""COFIA"" is invalid (F and I are okay, but ""COFIA"" isn't a word). ""COMGA"" isn't valid. ""COVIA"" isn't valid. ""COVYA"" isn't valid. Seems limited.

Option 2: _ O C _ A
Need letters for positions 1 and 4 from allowed set.
Looking for common patterns: ""FOC VA"" → ""FOC VA"" isn't a word. ""DOC MA"" → ""DO CMA"" isn't a word. ""GOC IA"" → ""GOC IA"" isn't a word. ""MOC VA"" → ""MOC VA"" isn't a word. ""WOC IA"" → ""WOC IA"" isn't a word.

Wait, let's try ""FOCAL"":
- F, O, C, A, L
But L is already excluded from feedback (L x in tonal).

Next, ""VOCAL"" - L excluded.

""FOC A"" needs another letter. ""FOC A"" isn't valid.

""DOC A"" isn't valid.

""ROC A"" - R excluded.

""XOC A"" - X not tested but uncommon.

""FOC A"" isn't valid.

""FOC A"" isn't valid.

Let me think of valid 5-letter words that fit:
- O in position 2
- A in position 5
- C must be in 1 or 3
- No excluded letters

Possible word: ""FOCAL"" - but L excluded.

""VOCAL"" - L excluded.

""WOCLA"" - not valid.

""GOCHA"" - H excluded.

""DOCA"" - too short.

""COBIA"" - B is allowed, I is allowed, but C is in position 1, O in 2, I in 3, A in 5, B in 4. But B wasn't tested yet, and this fits all constraints:
- C is in position 1 (allowed, since C was in position 4 in poach and marked as wrong position, so 1 is okay)
- O is in position 2 (correct)
- A is in position 5 (allowed, since it was in positions 1,3,4 in previous guesses)
- B and I are new letters, but we know the word must contain A, C, O, and other letters can be new.

But wait, we only know the word must contain A and C (from feedback), but could it contain other letters? Actually, from feedback we only know the word contains A and C (since they were marked as in the word), but could also contain other letters not yet tested.

However, in ""COBIA"":
- C in 1 (allowed)
- O in 2 (correct)
- B in 3 (new)
- I in 4 (new)
- A in 5 (allowed)

This seems valid. But let me check if there's a more straightforward word.

Another option: ""FOC IA"" - not valid.

""DOC IA"" - not valid.

""COG IA"" - not valid.

""COM IA"" - not valid.

""COV IA"" - not valid.

""COY IA"" - not valid.

""COG A"" - not valid.

""COB A"" - not valid.

""COBIA"" seems to be the best fit among possible combinations.

But let me think if there's a better word. ""FOCAL"" is invalid due to L. ""VOCAL"" invalid due to L. ""COBIA"" is valid but uses B and I.

Alternatively, ""COGMA"" - G and M are allowed, but ""COGMA"" isn't a word.

""COMGA"" - not a word.

""COVGA"" - not a word.

""COVIA"" - not a word.

""COYIA"" - not a word.

""COBIA"" seems to be the only valid word fitting the constraints. However, let me double-check:

Is ""COBIA"" a valid 5-letter word? Yes, it's a plural of ""cobia"" (a type of fish).

But let me see if there's a more common word. ""FOCAL"" is invalid, ""VOCAL"" invalid, ""DOICA"" (not a word).

Another approach: since C must be in 1 or 3, and we have _ O C _ A, let's try ""GOC A"" - no.

""DOC A"" - no.

""FOC A"" - no.

""BOC A"" - B is allowed, but ""BOC A"" isn't a word.

""COB A"" - no.

""COG A"" - no.

""COV A"" - no.

""COY A"" - no.

""COBIA"" seems to be the only valid word fitting the constraints. However, let me think if ""FOC A"" can be adjusted.

Wait, ""FOC A"" isn't valid. ""FOCAL"" is 5 letters but L is excluded.

Let me try ""VOC A"" - no.

""WO C A"" - no.

""GO C A"" - no.

""DO C A"" - no.

""COBIA"" seems to be the only valid word. But let me think of ""FOC A"" with different letters.

Actually, ""FOC A"" isn't valid. Let me try ""FOC A"" with valid letters.

""FOCAL"" is invalid, ""VOCAL"" invalid, ""DOICA"" (not a word).\n\nAnother approach: since C must be in 1 or 3, and we have _ O C _ A, let\'s try ""GOC A"" - no.\n\n""DOC A"" - no.\n\n""FOC A"" - no.\n\n""BOC A"" - B is allowed, but ""BOC A"" isn\'t a word.\n\n""COB A"" - no.\n\n""COG A"" - no.\n\n""COV A"" - no.\n\n""COY A"" - no.\n\n""COBIA"" seems to be the only valid word fitting the constraints.

From the feedback on ""cobia"":
- C is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- B is not in the word.
- I is not in the word.
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So the word now looks like: C O _ _ A

We know:
- Positions 1, 2, 5 are fixed: C O _ _ A
- Must use letters not yet excluded: remaining allowed letters are D, F, G, M, U, V, W, Y (plus any others not excluded)
- Letters already excluded: R, S, E, T, N, L, P, H, B, I

We need to fill positions 3 and 4 with allowed letters. Let's look for common combinations:
Possible letters for positions 3 and 4: D, F, G, M, U, V, W, Y

Looking for valid 5-letter words that fit C O _ _ A:
- COFIA - invalid
- COMMA - invalid (second M would be position 4, but word must end in A)
- COVVA - invalid
- COGGA - invalid
- COVGA - invalid
- COVYA - invalid
- COGIA - invalid
- COMIA - invalid
- COFIA - invalid
- COVIA - invalid

Wait, let's think of actual words:
- COFFA - invalid
- COGGA - invalid
- COMMA - invalid (ends in A but has two Ms)
- COVVA - invalid
- COGIA - invalid

Looking at valid words ending in CO _ _ A:
- COFFA - invalid

- COMMA - invalid
- COVVA - invalid

Hmm, let's try CO _ _ A with allowed letters:
- COFIA - invalid
- COMIA - invalid
- COGIA - invalid
- COVIA - invalid

Wait, let's try CO _ _ A with different combinations:
- COF _ A: COF_A - need a letter for position 4 from allowed set (D, G, M, U, V, W, Y)

Looking at this, the only valid word that fits C O _ _ A with allowed letters is ""COFFA"" but it's invalid. 

Wait, let me think of actual words:
- COFFA - invalid
- COGGA - invalid
- COMMA - invalid
- COVVA - invalid

Actually, the valid word fitting C O _ _ A with allowed letters is ""COMMA"" but it has two Ms. However, ""COMMA"" is a valid word:
- C O M M A
- Positions: 1=C, 2=O, 3=M, 4=M, 5=A
- Letters used: M is allowed (not excluded)
- But we have no restriction on duplicate letters.

So ""COMMA"" is valid.

Another possible word: ""COFFA"" - invalid
""COGGA"" - invalid
""COVVA"" - invalid

Thus, the only valid word seems to be ""COMMA"".

But let me double-check:
- C O M M A
- C, O, A are correct positions
- M is allowed (not excluded)
- This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is ""COMMA"".
