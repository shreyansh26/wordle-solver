For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AROSE,"" or ""ADIEU."" 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should give us good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- S is in the correct position (last letter).
- A, R, O, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends in S and does not contain A, R, O, E.  
We need a 5-letter word ending in S that avoids those four letters.

Common consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y, Z  
Common vowels left: I, U (since A, O, E are ruled out)

Good candidates:  
- BUILT S → but BUILT ends in T, not S.  
- DUSTS → has U, D, S, T, S – but S appears twice and we don’t know if S is repeated.  
- HISTS → has H, I, S, T, S – again double S.  
- MISTS → M, I, S, T, S – same issue.  
- PIVOT S → doesn’t end in S.  
- TULIP S → doesn’t end in S.  
- VULTS → uncommon spelling.  
- WISTS → uncommon.  
- YILKS → doesn’t end in S.

Actually, let’s list 5-letter words ending in S without A, R, O, E:  
- BUSTS – has B, U, S, T, S (double S)  
- CUSTS – not valid.  
- DUSTS – valid, has D, U, S, T, S (double S)  
- FISTS – valid, has F, I, S, T, S (double S)  
- GISTS – valid, has G, I, S, T, S (double S)  
- HISTS – valid, has H, I, S, T, S (double S)  
- LISTS – valid, has L, I, S, T, S (double S)  
- MISTS – valid, has M, I, S, T, S (double S)  
- PISTS – not valid.  
- TISTS – not valid.  
- WISTS – not valid.  
- YISTS – not valid.

All these have double S, which seems unlikely. Let’s look for words with single S at the end:  
- BUILT – ends in T.  
- CUBED – ends in D.  
- DILUT – ends in T.  
- FIBRE – ends in E (ruled out).  
- GUILD – ends in D.  
- HUMAN – ends in N.  
- LIMIT – ends in T.  
- MURKY – ends in Y.  
- PIVOT – ends in T.  
- SCALE – ends in E (ruled out).  
- SHOWN – ends in N.  
- STONE – ends in E (ruled out).  
- TULIP – ends in P.  
- VITAL – ends in L.  
- WIDER – ends in R (ruled out).  
- YOUTH – ends in H.

None of these end in S. So the only plausible words are those with double S, even though it’s less common. Among these, DUSTS, FISTS, GISTS, HISTS, LISTS, MISTS are all valid. 

Let’s pick one: DUSTS has D, U, S, T, S. It covers U, D, T, S. This seems like a good next guess to narrow down consonants and possibly the second letter.

However, another approach is to look for words ending in S with no A, R, O, E and no repeated letters. Examples:  
- BUILT – ends in T.  
- CUBED – ends in D.  
- DILUT – ends in T.

- WIDER – ends in R (ruled out).  
- YOUTH – ends in H.

None of these end in S. So the only viable options are those with double S. Given that, DUSTS seems like a reasonable choice.

Based on the feedback:
- S is confirmed in the last position.
- A, R, O, E are not in the word.

Let's parse the new feedback:

- D(x) → D is NOT in the word.
- U(x) → U is NOT in the word.
- S(-) → S is in the word but NOT in position 4 (since the second S is in position 5 and marked ""-"", that means the final S is still correct in position 5, but the first S in position 4 is marked ""-"" so S cannot be in position 4).
- T(-) → T is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So far:
- Word ends in S (position 5 confirmed ✓).
- Word contains S somewhere else (not position 4) and also contains T somewhere else (not position 4).
- Letters ruled out so far: A, R, O, E, D, U.

We need a 5-letter word ending in S that:
1. Contains S (not in position 4).
2. Contains T (not in position 4).
3. Does not contain A, R, O, E, D, U.

Possible consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, Z  
Possible vowels left: I (since A, O, E, U are ruled out)

Let's think of words fitting these constraints:
- Must end in S.
- Must have S in position 1, 2, or 3 (since position 4 is excluded).
- Must have T in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but 5 is already S, so positions 1,2,3).

Possible candidates:
- BISTS → has B, I, S, T, S → valid, but double S.
- FISTS → F, I, S, T, S → valid, double S.
- GISTS → G, I, S, T, S → valid, double S.
- HISTS → H, I, S, T, S → valid, double S.
- LISTS → L, I, S, T, S → valid, double S.
- MISTS → M, I, S, T, S → valid, double S.

All these have double S, which might be acceptable. Alternatively, words with single S and T elsewhere:
- BITTS → ends in S, has B, I, T, T, S → but T is in position 4 (ruled out).
- CISTS → C, I, S, T, S → valid, double S.
- FITTS → F, I, T, T, S → T in position 4 (ruled out).
- PISTS → P, I, S, T, S → valid, double S.

The best choices seem to be the ones with double S, as they fit all constraints. Among these, ""FISTS"" is a common word and covers F, I, S, T, S.

Let's verify:
- FISTS: F, I, S, T, S.
- Ends in S (✓).
- Contains S (positions 3 and 5), so S is in word (✓), and position 4 is excluded for S (-) which matches feedback.
- Contains T (position 4), but feedback says T is in word but NOT in position 4 (-). Wait, this is a conflict.

Oops, FISTS has T in position 4, but feedback says T is in word but NOT in position 4. So FISTS is invalid.

Let me reconsider. T must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

Possible words:
- BISTS → T in position 4 again (invalid).
- CISTS → T in position 4 (invalid).
- HISTS → T in position 4 (invalid).
- LISTS → T in position 4 (invalid).
- MISTS → T in position 4 (invalid).

I need to find words where T is not in position 4. Let's think differently: words with T in 1,2, or 3 and S in 1,2, or 3 (not 4), ending in S.

Examples:
- TISS → too short.
- STISS → invalid.
- BIST → ends in T, not S.
- CIST → ends in T.
- FIST → ends in T.
- GIST → ends in T.
- HIST → ends in T.
- LINT → ends in T.
- MIN → too short.
- PIST → ends in T.
- WIST → ends in T.

Hmm, most words with T and S don't end in S. Let me think of words ending in S with T and S not in 4, T not in 4.

Possible words:
- BISS → ends in S, has B, I, S, S → no T.
- CASS → ends in S, no T.
- FISS → ends in S, no T.
- GISS → ends in S, no T.
- LIS → too short.
- MISS → ends in S, no T.
- PISS → ends in S, no T.
- WISS → ends in S, no T.

This is tricky. Maybe I need to consider less common words or verify if T must be in 1,2, or 3.

Looking back at the feedback:
- DUSTS → D(x) U(x) S(-) T(-) S(-)
This means:
- S is in word but not in position 4 (so S must be in 1,2,3, or 5; but 5 is confirmed ✓, so 1,2,3).
- T is in word but not in position 4 (so T must be in 1,2,3).

Possible words:
- BIT → too short.
- FIT → too short.
- HIT → too short.
- PITH → ends in H.
- SWISH → ends in H.
- STITCH → ends in H.
- BUST → ends in T, not S.
- FUST → ends in T.
- LUST → ends in T.
- MUST → ends in T.
- PUST → ends in T.
- WUST → ends in T.

None of these end in S. I must have made a mistake. The word must end in S, contain S (not in 4), and contain T (not in 4).

Let me try:
- BIST → ends in T.
- CIST → ends in T.
- FIST → ends in T.
- GIST → ends in T.
- HIST → ends in T.
- LINT → ends in T.
- PIST → ends in T.
- WIST → ends in T.

These all end in T, not S. I need to find words ending in S with T and S not in 4, T not in 4.

Possible words:
- BITTS → ends in S, has B, I, T, T, S → T in 3 and 4. Position 4 is excluded for T (-), so T in 3 is okay. S is in 5 (✓), and also in 4 (but 4 is excluded for S (-), so S must be in 1,2, or 3. But BITTS has S in 4 and 5, which conflicts with S(-) for position 4 in DUSTS.

This is getting complicated. Let me re-express constraints:
- Word: _ _ _ _ S
- Must contain S somewhere else (not position 4).
- Must contain T somewhere else (not position 4).
- Cannot contain A, R, O, E, D, U.

Possible positions:
S must be in 1,2, or 3 (since 4 and 5 are S in 5 and 4 respectively, but S is excluded from 4).
T must be in 1,2, or 3.

Possible combinations:
- S in 1: S _ _ _ S → T must be in 2 or 3 → S T _ _ S or S _ T _ S
- S in 2: _ S _ _ S → T must be in 1, 3 → T S _ _ S or _ S T _ S
- S in 3: _ _ S _ S → T must be in 1 or 2 → T _ S _ S or _ T S _ S

Let's think of words fitting these patterns:
- S T _ _ S: STICKS → has C, I, K → valid? STICKS: S, T, I, C, K, S → 6 letters.
- S _ T _ S: S, _, T, _, S → S, I, T, _, S → SIT? no.
- T S _ _ S: T, S, _, _, S → T, S, _, _, S → TISS → too short.
- _ S T _ S: _, S, T, _, S → B, S, T, _, S → BISTS → 5 letters, B, I, S, T, S → but T is in 4 (invalid).
- T _ S _ S: T, _, S, _, S → T, I, S, _, S → TISS → too short.
- _ T S _ S: _, T, S, _, S → B, T, S, _, S → B T S _ S → B T S _ S → needs a letter.

This is proving difficult. Maybe the word has S in 1 and T in 2 or 3:
- S T I C S → STICS → not a valid word.
- S T I L S → STILS → variant of ""still"", but uncommon.
- S T I P S → STIPS → valid word.

STIPS:
- S T I P S
- Ends in S (✓).
- Contains S in 1 and 5 (so S is in word, and positions 1 and 5, so 4 is excluded for S (-) which matches feedback).
- Contains T in 2 (not in 4) (✓).
- Letters used: S, T, I, P, S → no A, R, O, E, D, U (✓).

STIPS seems to fit all constraints.
</think>

Based on the feedback:
- S is confirmed in position 5 (✓).
- S is also in the word but not in position 4 (-), so S must appear elsewhere (position 1, 2, or 3).
- T is in the word but not in position 4 (-), so T must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- Letters ruled out: A, R, O, E, D, U.

A valid word that fits these constraints is ""STIPS"":

- Contains S in position 1 and T in position 2 (both allowed positions).
- Uses only allowed letters (no A, R, O, E, D, U).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AROSE,"" or ""ADIEU."" 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should give us good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- S is in the correct position (last letter).
- A, R, O, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends in S and does not contain A, R, O, E.  
We need a 5-letter word ending in S that avoids those four letters.

Common consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y, Z  
Common vowels left: I, U (since A, O, E are ruled out)

Good candidates:  
- BUILT S → but BUILT ends in T, not S.  
- DUSTS → has U, D, S, T, S – but S appears twice and we don’t know if S is repeated.  
- HISTS → has H, I, S, T, S – again double S.  
- MISTS → M, I, S, T, S – same issue.  
- PIVOT S → doesn’t end in S.  
- TULIP S → doesn’t end in S.  
- VULTS → uncommon spelling.  
- WISTS → uncommon.  
- YILKS → doesn’t end in S.

Actually, let’s list 5-letter words ending in S without A, R, O, E:  
- BUSTS – has B, U, S, T, S (double S)  
- CUSTS – not valid.  
- DUSTS – valid, has D, U, S, T, S (double S)  
- FISTS – valid, has F, I, S, T, S (double S)  
- GISTS – valid, has G, I, S, T, S (double S)  
- HISTS – valid, has H, I, S, T, S (double S)  
- LISTS – valid, has L, I, S, T, S (double S)  
- MISTS – valid, has M, I, S, T, S (double S)  
- PISTS – not valid.  
- TISTS – not valid.  
- WISTS – not valid.  
- YISTS – not valid.

All these have double S, which seems unlikely. Let’s look for words with single S at the end:  
- BUILT – ends in T.  
- CUBED – ends in D.  
- DILUT – ends in T.  
- FIBRE – ends in E (ruled out).  
- GUILD – ends in D.  
- HUMAN – ends in N.  
- LIMIT – ends in T.  
- MURKY – ends in Y.  
- PIVOT – ends in T.  
- SCALE – ends in E (ruled out).  
- SHOWN – ends in N.  
- STONE – ends in E (ruled out).  
- TULIP – ends in P.  
- VITAL – ends in L.  
- WIDER – ends in R (ruled out).  
- YOUTH – ends in H.

None of these end in S. So the only plausible words are those with double S, even though it’s less common. Among these, DUSTS, FISTS, GISTS, HISTS, LISTS, MISTS are all valid. 

Let’s pick one: DUSTS has D, U, S, T, S. It covers U, D, T, S. This seems like a good next guess to narrow down consonants and possibly the second letter.

However, another approach is to look for words ending in S with no A, R, O, E and no repeated letters. Examples:  
- BUILT – ends in T.  
- CUBED – ends in D.  
- DILUT – ends in T.  
- FIBRE – ends in E (ruled out).  
- GUILD – ends in D.  
- HUMAN – ends in N.  
- LIMIT – ends in T.  
- MURKY – ends in Y.  
- PIVOT – ends in T.  
- SCALE – ends in E (ruled out).  
- SHOWN – ends in N.  
- STONE – ends in E (ruled out).  
- TULIP – ends in P.  
- VITAL – ends in L.  
- WIDER – ends in R (ruled out).  
- YOUTH – ends in H.

None of these end in S. So the only viable options are those with double S. Given that, DUSTS seems like a reasonable choice.Based on the feedback:
- S is confirmed in the last position.
- A, R, O, E are not in the word.

I need a 5-letter word ending in S that avoids A, R, O, E. A good candidate is ""DUSTS,"" which covers new consonants (D, U, T) and a vowel (U).

Let's parse the new feedback:

- D(x) → D is NOT in the word.
- U(x) → U is NOT in the word.
- S(-) → S is in the word but NOT in position 4 (since the second S is in position 5 and marked ""-"", that means the final S is still correct in position 5, but the first S in position 4 is marked ""-"" so S cannot be in position 4).
- T(-) → T is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So far:
- Word ends in S (position 5 confirmed ✓).
- Word contains S somewhere else (not position 4) and also contains T somewhere else (not position 4).
- Letters ruled out so far: A, R, O, E, D, U.

We need a 5-letter word ending in S that:
1. Contains S (not in position 4).
2. Contains T (not in position 4).
3. Does not contain A, R, O, E, D, U.

Possible consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, Z  
Possible vowels left: I (since A, O, E, U are ruled out)

Let's think of words fitting these constraints:
- Must end in S.
- Must have S in position 1, 2, or 3 (since position 4 is excluded).
- Must have T in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but 5 is already S, so positions 1,2,3).

Possible candidates:
- BISTS → has B, I, S, T, S → valid, but double S.
- FISTS → F, I, S, T, S → valid, double S.
- GISTS → G, I, S, T, S → valid, double S.

- MISTS → M, I, S, T, S → valid, double S.

All these have double S, which might be acceptable. Alternatively, words with single S and T elsewhere:
- BITTS → ends in S, has B, I, T, T, S → but T is in position 4 (ruled out).
- CISTS → C, I, S, T, S → valid, double S.
- FITTS → F, I, T, T, S → T in position 4 (ruled out).
- PISTS → P, I, S, T, S → valid, double S.

The best choices seem to be the ones with double S, as they fit all constraints. Among these, ""FISTS"" is a common word and covers F, I, S, T, S.

Let's verify:
- FISTS: F, I, S, T, S.
- Ends in S (✓).
- Contains S (positions 3 and 5), so S is in word (✓), and position 4 is excluded for S (-) which matches feedback.
- Contains T (position 4), but feedback says T is in word but NOT in position 4 (-). Wait, this is a conflict.

Oops, FISTS has T in position 4, but feedback says T is in word but NOT in position 4. So FISTS is invalid.

Let me reconsider. T must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

Possible words:
- BISTS → T in position 4 again (invalid).
- CISTS → T in position 4 (invalid).
- HISTS → T in position 4 (invalid).
- LISTS → T in position 4 (invalid).
- MISTS → T in position 4 (invalid).

I need to find words where T is not in position 4. Let's think differently: words with T in 1,2, or 3 and S in 1,2, or 3 (not 4), ending in S.

Examples:
- TISS → too short.
- STISS → invalid.
- BIST → ends in T, not S.
- CIST → ends in T.
- FIST → ends in T.
- GIST → ends in T.
- HIST → ends in T.
- LINT → ends in T.
- MIN → too short.
- PIST → ends in T.
- WIST → ends in T.

Hmm, most words with T and S don't end in S. Let me think of words ending in S with T and S not in 4, T not in 4.

Possible words:
- BISS → ends in S, has B, I, S, S → no T.
- CASS → ends in S, no T.
- FISS → ends in S, no T.
- GISS → ends in S, no T.
- LIS → too short.
- MISS → ends in S, no T.
- PISS → ends in S, no T.
- WISS → ends in S, no T.

This is tricky. Maybe I need to consider less common words or verify if T must be in 1,2, or 3.

Looking back at the feedback:
- DUSTS → D(x) U(x) S(-) T(-) S(-)
This means:
- S is in word but not in position 4 (so S must be in 1,2,3, or 5; but 5 is confirmed ✓, so 1,2,3).
- T is in word but not in position 4 (so T must be in 1,2,3).

Possible words:
- BIT → too short.
- FIT → too short.
- HIT → too short.
- PITH → ends in H.
- SWISH → ends in H.
- STITCH → ends in H.
- BUST → ends in T, not S.
- FUST → ends in T.
- LUST → ends in T.
- MUST → ends in T.
- PUST → ends in T.
- WUST → ends in T.

None of these end in S. I must have made a mistake. The word must end in S, contain S (not in 4), and contain T (not in 4).

Let me try:
- BIST → ends in T.
- CIST → ends in T.
- FIST → ends in T.
- GIST → ends in T.
- HIST → ends in T.
- LINT → ends in T.
- PIST → ends in T.
- WIST → ends in T.

These all end in T, not S. I need to find words ending in S with T and S not in 4, T not in 4.

Possible words:
- BITTS → ends in S, has B, I, T, T, S → T in 3 and 4. Position 4 is excluded for T (-), so T in 3 is okay. S is in 5 (✓), and also in 4 (but 4 is excluded for S (-), so S must be in 1,2, or 3. But BITTS has S in 4 and 5, which conflicts with S(-) for position 4 in DUSTS.

This is getting complicated. Let me re-express constraints:
- Word: _ _ _ _ S
- Must contain S somewhere else (not position 4).
- Must contain T somewhere else (not position 4).
- Cannot contain A, R, O, E, D, U.

Possible positions:
S must be in 1,2, or 3 (since 4 and 5 are S in 5 and 4 respectively, but S is excluded from 4).
T must be in 1,2, or 3.

Possible combinations:
- S in 1: S _ _ _ S → T must be in 2 or 3 → S T _ _ S or S _ T _ S
- S in 2: _ S _ _ S → T must be in 1, 3 → T S _ _ S or _ S T _ S
- S in 3: _ _ S _ S → T must be in 1 or 2 → T _ S _ S or _ T S _ S

Let's think of words fitting these patterns:
- S T _ _ S: STICKS → has C, I, K → valid? STICKS: S, T, I, C, K, S → 6 letters.
- S _ T _ S: S, _, T, _, S → S, I, T, _, S → SIT? no.
- T S _ _ S: T, S, _, _, S → T, S, _, _, S → TISS → too short.
- _ S T _ S: _, S, T, _, S → B, S, T, _, S → BISTS → 5 letters, B, I, S, T, S → but T is in 4 (invalid).
- T _ S _ S: T, _, S, _, S → T, I, S, _, S → TISS → too short.
- _ T S _ S: _, T, S, _, S → B, T, S, _, S → B T S _ S → B T S _ S → needs a letter.

This is proving difficult. Maybe the word has S in 1 and T in 2 or 3:
- S T I C S → STICS → not a valid word.
- S T I L S → STILS → variant of ""still"", but uncommon.
- S T I P S → STIPS → valid word.

STIPS:
- S T I P S
- Ends in S (✓).
- Contains S in 1 and 5 (so S is in word, and positions 1 and 5, so 4 is excluded for S (-) which matches feedback).
- Contains T in 2 (not in 4) (✓).
- Letters used: S, T, I, P, S → no A, R, O, E, D, U (✓).

STIPS seems to fit all constraints.Based on the feedback:
- S is confirmed in position 5 (✓).
- S is also in the word but not in position 4 (-), so S must appear elsewhere (position 1, 2, or 3).
- T is in the word but not in position 4 (-), so T must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- Letters ruled out: A, R, O, E, D, U.

A valid word that fits these constraints is ""STIPS"":
- Ends in S (✓).
- Contains S in position 1 and T in position 2 (both allowed positions).
- Uses only allowed letters (no A, R, O, E, D, U).

Let's update what we now know from all feedback:

1. Position 5 is definitely S (✓).
2. S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (from STIPS feedback S(-) in positions 1 and 3, and from DUSTS feedback S(-) in position 4).  
   Therefore S must be in position 2.
3. T is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 4 (from STIPS feedback T(-) in position 2 and DUSTS feedback T(-) in position 4).  
   Therefore T must be in position 1 or 3.
4. I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3 ✓).
5. Letters definitely absent: A, R, O, E, D, U, P.

Current pattern:
- Position 3: I (fixed)
- Position 5: S (fixed)
- Position 2: S (only remaining place for S)
- Positions 1 and 4: to be determined from remaining letters.

So the word looks like: _ S I _ S

We need:
- Position 1: any letter not yet ruled out (B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, V, W, Y, Z, etc.) and not used in positions 2,3,4,5.
- Position 4: T (because T cannot be in 2,4,5 and must appear) or any other letter if T is skipped, but T must appear so it must go here.

Thus the word must be: ? S I T S

Possible first letters left: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, V, W, Y, Z...

Valid English 5-letter words ending in SITS or similar:
- B I T S → too short.
- C I T S → too short.
- F I T S → ""fits"" but that's 4 letters.
- G I T S → ""gits"" but that's 4 letters.
- H I T S → ""hits"" but that's 4 letters.
- L I T S → ""lists"" but that's 5 letters and ends in S, but we need _ S I T S.

Wait, we need _ S I T S. Let's think:

Possible first letters:
- B: B S I T S → not a word.
- C: C S I T S → not a word.
- F: F S I T S → not a word.
- H: H S I T S → not a word.
- K: K S I T S → not a word.
- M: M S I T S → not a word.
- N: N S I T S → not a word.
- V: V S I T S → not a word.
- W: W S I T S → not a word.
- Y: Y S I T S → not a word.
- Z: Z S I T S → not a word.

Hmm, none of these are valid. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, the pattern is _ S I _ S, and T must be in 1 or 3. But position 3 is I, so T must be in position 1. Thus the word must be T S I _ S. But that would be T S I _ S, needing a 4th letter.

Possible 4th letters left: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, V, W, Y, Z.

Valid English words:
- T S I B S → not a word.
- T S I C S → not a word.
- T S I F S → not a word.
- T S I G S → not a word.
- T S I L S → ""tsils"" not a word.
- T S I M S → not a word.
- T S I N S → ""tins"" but that's 4 letters.
- T S I P S → P is ruled out.
- T S I V S → not a word.
- T S I W S → not a word.
- T S I Y S → not a word.
- T S I Z S → not a word.

This suggests my earlier deduction might be off. Let me re-examine the constraints.

From STIPS feedback:
- S(-) in position 1: S is in word but not position 1.
- T(-) in position 2: T is in word but not position 2.
- I(✓) in position 3: I is correct here.
- P(x) in position 4: P is not in word.
- S(-) in position 5: S is in word but not position 5. But we already know position 5 is S (from AROSE), so this implies S cannot be in position 5, which contradicts the first feedback. Wait, no: the first feedback said S(✓) in position 5, so position 5 is definitely S. The STIPS feedback S(-) in position 5 is actually redundant because we know it's S.

So re-summarizing:
- Position 5: S (fixed).
- S is in word but NOT in positions 1,3,4,5. But position 5 is S, so this implies S cannot be in position 5, which contradicts the first feedback. Wait, no: the feedback for STIPS says S(-) in position 5, which would mean S is in word but not position 5, but we know from AROSE that position 5 is S. This is a contradiction unless the feedback is interpreted as ""S is in word but not in position 5"", but that would conflict with position 5 being S. This suggests the feedback is indicating S is in word but not in position 5, yet position 5 is marked ✓ for S. This seems impossible.

Wait, let's re-read the feedback carefully:

Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
This means:
- Position 1: A(x) → A not in word.
- Position 2: R(x) → R not in word.
- Position 3: O(x) → O not in word.
- Position 4: S(✓) → S is in word and in correct position (position 4). But this contradicts the initial statement that the word is 5 letters with S in position 5. This suggests a misinterpretation.

Wait, the initial problem says: ""Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)"". This implies:
- The feedback is per position:
  - A is not in the word (position 1).
  - R is not in the word (position 2).
  - O is not in the word (position 3).
  - S is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
  - E is not in the word (position 5).

But this would mean the secret word has S in position 4, not 5. This contradicts my earlier understanding. Let me re-interpret all feedback with this in mind.

Correct interpretation:
Each letter's feedback is for its specific position in the guess.

Guess 1: AROSE
- Position 1: A(x) → A not in word.
- Position 2: R(x) → R not in word.
- Position 3: O(x) → O not in word.
- Position 4: S(✓) → S is in word and in position 4.
- Position 5: E(x) → E not in word.

Thus the secret word has S in position 4, not 5. My earlier interpretations were incorrect due to misreading the feedback.

Let's restart with correct understanding:

1. Secret word: _ _ _ S _
2. Letters not in word: A, R, O, E, D, U, P (from all feedback).
3. From Guess 2 DUSTS: D(x) U(x) S(-) T(-) S(-)
   - Position 1: D(x) → D not in word.
   - Position 2: U(x) → U not in word.
   - Position 3: S(-) → S is in word but not in position 3 (but we know S is in position 4, so this is redundant).
   - Position 4: T(-) → T is in word but not in position 4 (so T is in 1,2,3, or 5).
   - Position 5: S(-) → S is in word but not in position 5 (consistent with S in 4).

4. From Guess 3 STIPS: S(-) T(-) I(✓) P(x) S(-)
   - Position 1: S(-) → S is in word but not in position 1 (so S is in 2,3,4,5; but we know S is in 4).
   - Position 2: T(-) → T is in word but not in position 2.
   - Position 3: I(✓) → I is in word and in position 3.
   - Position 4: P(x) → P not in word.
   - Position 5: S(-) → S is in word but not in position 5 (consistent).

Thus current constraints:
- Word: _ _ I S _
- Letters not in word: A, R, O, E, D, U, P
- T is in word but not in positions 2 or 4 (from DUSTS and STIPS), so T must be in position 1 or 5.
- S is fixed in position 4.
- I is fixed in position 3.

Possible patterns:
- T _ I S _ → T in position 1
- _ _ I S T → T in position 5

Let's explore both.

Case 1: T _ I S _
Word: T _ I S _
Letters used: T, I, S
Letters left to fill: position 2 and 5 from remaining alphabet (excluding A,R,O,E,D,U,P)
Valid letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, V, W, Y, Z

Possible words:
- T B I S _ → T B I S N, T B I S M, etc.
- T C I S _ → T C I S N, T C I S M, etc.
- T F I S _ → T F I S N, T F I S M, etc.

Valid English words:
- T B I S N → not valid.
- T C I S N → not valid.
- T F I S N → not valid.
- T H I S _ → T H I S Y, T H I S N, T H I S K, etc.
  - T H I S K → ""thisk"" not valid.
  - T H I S N → ""thinsn"" not valid.
  - T H I S Y → ""thisy"" not valid.
- T W I S _ → T W I S E → E is ruled out.
- T W I S T → T W I S T → valid word ""twist"".

Case 2: _ _ I S T
Word: _ _ I S T
Letters used: I, S, T
Letters left to fill: positions 1 and 2 from remaining alphabet.

Valid letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, V, W, Y, Z

Possible combinations:
- B C I S T → ""bcist"" not valid.
- B L I S T → ""blist"" not valid.
- C L I S T → ""clist"" not valid.
- F L I S T → ""flist"" not valid.
- G L I S T → ""glist"" not valid.
- H I I S T → I is already in position 3.
- M I I S T → not valid.
- V I I S T → not valid.
- W I I S T → not valid.
- Y I I S T → not valid.

None of these seem to produce valid words. Thus the only plausible valid word is ""twist"" from Case 1.

Let's verify:
- T W I S T
- Position 1: T ✓ (from T _ I S _)
- Position 2: W (not ruled out)
- Position 3: I ✓
- Position 4: S ✓
- Position 5: T ✓ (from _ _ I S T or T _ I S _)

This fits all constraints.
</think>

Based on the updated interpretation of the feedback, the secret word has S in position 4, I in position 3, and T must be in position 1 or 5. The only valid English word fitting these constraints is ""twist"".

<guess>TWIST</guess>",TWIST,"Let's update what we now know from all feedback:

1. Position 5 is definitely S (✓).
2. S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (from STIPS feedback S(-) in positions 1 and 3, and from DUSTS feedback S(-) in position 4).  
   Therefore S must be in position 2.
3. T is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 4 (from STIPS feedback T(-) in position 2 and DUSTS feedback T(-) in position 4).  
   Therefore T must be in position 1 or 3.
4. I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3 ✓).
5. Letters definitely absent: A, R, O, E, D, U, P.

Current pattern:
- Position 3: I (fixed)
- Position 5: S (fixed)
- Position 2: S (only remaining place for S)
- Positions 1 and 4: to be determined from remaining letters.

So the word looks like: _ S I _ S

We need:
- Position 1: any letter not yet ruled out (B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, V, W, Y, Z, etc.) and not used in positions 2,3,4,5.
- Position 4: T (because T cannot be in 2,4,5 and must appear) or any other letter if T is skipped, but T must appear so it must go here.

Thus the word must be: ? S I T S

Possible first letters left: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, V, W, Y, Z...

Valid English 5-letter words ending in SITS or similar:
- B I T S → too short.
- C I T S → too short.
- F I T S → ""fits"" but that's 4 letters.
- G I T S → ""gits"" but that's 4 letters.
- H I T S → ""hits"" but that's 4 letters.
- L I T S → ""lists"" but that's 5 letters and ends in S, but we need _ S I T S.

Wait, we need _ S I T S. Let's think:

Possible first letters:
- B: B S I T S → not a word.
- C: C S I T S → not a word.
- F: F S I T S → not a word.
- H: H S I T S → not a word.
- K: K S I T S → not a word.
- M: M S I T S → not a word.
- N: N S I T S → not a word.
- V: V S I T S → not a word.
- W: W S I T S → not a word.
- Y: Y S I T S → not a word.
- Z: Z S I T S → not a word.

Hmm, none of these are valid. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, the pattern is _ S I _ S, and T must be in 1 or 3. But position 3 is I, so T must be in position 1. Thus the word must be T S I _ S. But that would be T S I _ S, needing a 4th letter.

Possible 4th letters left: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, V, W, Y, Z.

Valid English words:
- T S I B S → not a word.
- T S I C S → not a word.
- T S I F S → not a word.
- T S I G S → not a word.
- T S I L S → ""tsils"" not a word.
- T S I M S → not a word.
- T S I N S → ""tins"" but that's 4 letters.
- T S I P S → P is ruled out.
- T S I V S → not a word.
- T S I W S → not a word.
- T S I Y S → not a word.
- T S I Z S → not a word.

This suggests my earlier deduction might be off. Let me re-examine the constraints.

From STIPS feedback:
- S(-) in position 1: S is in word but not position 1.
- T(-) in position 2: T is in word but not position 2.
- I(✓) in position 3: I is correct here.
- P(x) in position 4: P is not in word.
- S(-) in position 5: S is in word but not position 5. But we already know position 5 is S (from AROSE), so this implies S cannot be in position 5, which contradicts the first feedback. Wait, no: the first feedback said S(✓) in position 5, so position 5 is definitely S. The STIPS feedback S(-) in position 5 is actually redundant because we know it's S.

So re-summarizing:
- Position 5: S (fixed).
- S is in word but NOT in positions 1,3,4,5. But position 5 is S, so this implies S cannot be in position 5, which contradicts the first feedback. Wait, no: the feedback for STIPS says S(-) in position 5, which would mean S is in word but not position 5, but we know from AROSE that position 5 is S. This is a contradiction unless the feedback is interpreted as ""S is in word but not in position 5"", but that would conflict with position 5 being S. This suggests the feedback is indicating S is in word but not in position 5, yet position 5 is marked ✓ for S. This seems impossible.

Wait, let's re-read the feedback carefully:

Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
This means:
- Position 1: A(x) → A not in word.
- Position 2: R(x) → R not in word.
- Position 3: O(x) → O not in word.
- Position 4: S(✓) → S is in word and in correct position (position 4). But this contradicts the initial statement that the word is 5 letters with S in position 5. This suggests a misinterpretation.

Wait, the initial problem says: ""Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)"". This implies:
- The feedback is per position:
  - A is not in the word (position 1).
  - R is not in the word (position 2).
  - O is not in the word (position 3).
  - S is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
  - E is not in the word (position 5).

But this would mean the secret word has S in position 4, not 5. This contradicts my earlier understanding. Let me re-interpret all feedback with this in mind.

Correct interpretation:
Each letter's feedback is for its specific position in the guess.

Guess 1: AROSE
- Position 1: A(x) → A not in word.
- Position 2: R(x) → R not in word.
- Position 3: O(x) → O not in word.
- Position 4: S(✓) → S is in word and in position 4.
- Position 5: E(x) → E not in word.

Thus the secret word has S in position 4, not 5. My earlier interpretations were incorrect due to misreading the feedback.

Let's restart with correct understanding:

1. Secret word: _ _ _ S _
2. Letters not in word: A, R, O, E, D, U, P (from all feedback).
3. From Guess 2 DUSTS: D(x) U(x) S(-) T(-) S(-)
   - Position 1: D(x) → D not in word.
   - Position 2: U(x) → U not in word.
   - Position 3: S(-) → S is in word but not in position 3 (but we know S is in position 4, so this is redundant).
   - Position 4: T(-) → T is in word but not in position 4 (so T is in 1,2,3, or 5).
   - Position 5: S(-) → S is in word but not in position 5 (consistent with S in 4).

4. From Guess 3 STIPS: S(-) T(-) I(✓) P(x) S(-)
   - Position 1: S(-) → S is in word but not in position 1 (so S is in 2,3,4,5; but we know S is in 4).
   - Position 2: T(-) → T is in word but not in position 2.
   - Position 3: I(✓) → I is in word and in position 3.
   - Position 4: P(x) → P not in word.
   - Position 5: S(-) → S is in word but not in position 5 (consistent).

Thus current constraints:
- Word: _ _ I S _
- Letters not in word: A, R, O, E, D, U, P
- T is in word but not in positions 2 or 4 (from DUSTS and STIPS), so T must be in position 1 or 5.
- S is fixed in position 4.
- I is fixed in position 3.

Possible patterns:
- T _ I S _ → T in position 1
- _ _ I S T → T in position 5

Let's explore both.

Case 1: T _ I S _
Word: T _ I S _
Letters used: T, I, S
Letters left to fill: position 2 and 5 from remaining alphabet (excluding A,R,O,E,D,U,P)
Valid letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, V, W, Y, Z

Possible words:
- T B I S _ → T B I S N, T B I S M, etc.
- T C I S _ → T C I S N, T C I S M, etc.
- T F I S _ → T F I S N, T F I S M, etc.

Valid English words:
- T B I S N → not valid.
- T C I S N → not valid.
- T F I S N → not valid.
- T H I S _ → T H I S Y, T H I S N, T H I S K, etc.
  - T H I S K → ""thisk"" not valid.
  - T H I S N → ""thinsn"" not valid.
  - T H I S Y → ""thisy"" not valid.
- T W I S _ → T W I S E → E is ruled out.
- T W I S T → T W I S T → valid word ""twist"".

Case 2: _ _ I S T
Word: _ _ I S T
Letters used: I, S, T
Letters left to fill: positions 1 and 2 from remaining alphabet.

Valid letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, V, W, Y, Z

Possible combinations:
- B C I S T → ""bcist"" not valid.
- B L I S T → ""blist"" not valid.
- C L I S T → ""clist"" not valid.
- F L I S T → ""flist"" not valid.
- G L I S T → ""glist"" not valid.
- H I I S T → I is already in position 3.
- M I I S T → not valid.
- V I I S T → not valid.
- W I I S T → not valid.
- Y I I S T → not valid.

None of these seem to produce valid words. Thus the only plausible valid word is ""twist"" from Case 1.

Let's verify:
- T W I S T
- Position 1: T ✓ (from T _ I S _)
- Position 2: W (not ruled out)
- Position 3: I ✓
- Position 4: S ✓
- Position 5: T ✓ (from _ _ I S T or T _ I S _)

This fits all constraints.Based on the updated interpretation of the feedback, the secret word has S in position 4, I in position 3, and T must be in position 1 or 5. The only valid English word fitting these constraints is ""twist"".",Guess 4: TWIST -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) W(✓) I(✓) S(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
