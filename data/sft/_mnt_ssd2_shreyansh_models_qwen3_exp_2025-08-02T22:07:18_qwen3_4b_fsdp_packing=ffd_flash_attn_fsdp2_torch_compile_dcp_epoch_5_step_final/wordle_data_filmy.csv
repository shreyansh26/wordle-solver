### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information I can get from the feedback. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. 

A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct common letters. ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains five of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E), each in a different position. This will help me quickly identify which of these common letters are in the secret word and their correct positions.

Another good option could be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O and E which are very common. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

All five letters A, R, O, S, E are NOT in the secret word (each got “x”).  
Therefore I must avoid these letters entirely.

I still want a word with common letters not yet ruled out.  
The next most common letters that remain available are: T, I, N, L, U, D, C, M, P, H, G, B, K, F, Y, W, V, O (but O is already out), etc.

A balanced choice would be a word like “UNTIL” or “HITTY” or “CUBIC”.  
I’ll pick “UNTIL” because it uses five distinct, fairly common letters (U, N, T, I, L) none of which have been tested yet.

So far we know:
- Letters A, R, O, S, E are NOT in the word (from the first guess).
- Letters U, N, T are NOT in the word (from the second guess).
- Letters I and L are in the word but in the wrong positions.

The remaining unused common letters include: D, C, M, P, H, G, B, K, F, Y, W, V, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both I and L (since both are in the word).
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T.
3. Has I and L in different positions from their current ones (I was in position 4, L in position 5).

Possible positions for I and L:
- I can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.
- L can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Let me think of words that fit these constraints. Some candidates:
- ""CHILD"" (I in 2, L in 4) - but D is new, C and H are new
- ""FLICK"" (I in 3, L in 4) - but K is new
- ""MILCH"" (I in 2, L in 3) - but H is new
- ""PILCH"" (I in 2, L in 3) - but H is new
- ""VIRAL"" - but A and R are already out
- ""WIDLY"" - but Y is new, W and D are new

""WIDLY"" seems good because:
- Contains I (position 2) and L (position 4)
- Uses new letters W, D, Y
- Doesn't use any ruled-out letters

- W: new

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information I can get from the feedback. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. 

A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct common letters. ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains five of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E), each in a different position. This will help me quickly identify which of these common letters are in the secret word and their correct positions.

Another good option could be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O and E which are very common. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters A, R, O, S, E are NOT in the secret word (each got “x”).  
Therefore I must avoid these letters entirely.

I still want a word with common letters not yet ruled out.  
The next most common letters that remain available are: T, I, N, L, U, D, C, M, P, H, G, B, K, F, Y, W, V, O (but O is already out), etc.

A balanced choice would be a word like “UNTIL” or “HITTY” or “CUBIC”.  
I’ll pick “UNTIL” because it uses five distinct, fairly common letters (U, N, T, I, L) none of which have been tested yet.

(If the feedback shows any hits, I’ll adjust my next guess accordingly.)

So far we know:
- Letters A, R, O, S, E are NOT in the word (from the first guess).
- Letters U, N, T are NOT in the word (from the second guess).
- Letters I and L are in the word but in the wrong positions.

The remaining unused common letters include: D, C, M, P, H, G, B, K, F, Y, W, V, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both I and L (since both are in the word).
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T.
3. Has I and L in different positions from their current ones (I was in position 4, L in position 5).

Possible positions for I and L:
- I can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.
- L can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Let me think of words that fit these constraints. Some candidates:
- ""CHILD"" (I in 2, L in 4) - but D is new, C and H are new
- ""FLICK"" (I in 3, L in 4) - but K is new
- ""MILCH"" (I in 2, L in 3) - but H is new
- ""PILCH"" (I in 2, L in 3) - but H is new
- ""VIRAL"" - but A and R are already out
- ""WIDLY"" - but Y is new, W and D are new

""WIDLY"" seems good because:
- Contains I (position 2) and L (position 4)
- Uses new letters W, D, Y
- Doesn't use any ruled-out letters

Let me double-check:
- W: new
- I: in word (allowed)
- D: new
- L: in word (allowed)
- Y: new

This seems like the best next guess.

- _ I L _ Y  (L in position 3)  

Thus valid patterns are:
- L I _ _ Y  
- _ I L _ Y  

Let’s think of common words for these patterns:

- L I C K Y – uses C, K (both unused)

3. Letter L is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (from feedback on guesses 2, 3, 4).  
   Therefore L must be in position 2, but position 2 is already occupied by I.  
   This is a contradiction unless we re-examine:

Wait:  
- Guess 2: L(-) means L is in word, not in position 4.  
- Guess 3: L(-) means L is in word, not in position 1.  
- Guess 4: L(-) means L is in word, not in position 1.

- Position 5 = Y  

Thus L must be in position 3.

Current pattern: _ I L _ Y

Remaining unused common letters (not yet ruled out):

Thus L must be in position 3.

Current pattern: _ I L _ Y

Remaining unused common letters (not yet ruled out):  
B, F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, X, Z (plus any others not listed above).

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 4, both from the unused set.

Common words fitting _ I L _ Y:

- B I L G Y → B and G unused, valid  
- F I L M Y → F and M unused, valid  
- H I L G Y → H and G unused, valid  
- M I L G Y → M and G unused, valid  
- P I L G Y → P and G unused, valid  
- V I L G Y → V and G unused, valid  

Among these, “FILMY” is a very common word using F and M (both still allowed).  
Let’s try FILMY.

If it fits, I, L, Y will all be in correct positions, and F, M will be tested.",Guess 5: filmy -> FEEDBACK: F(✓) I(✓) L(✓) M(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
