### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help us eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Good starting words often include common vowels and consonants. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is a strong choice because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of frequently used letters in English words, which should provide helpful feedback for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

All five letters from the first guess (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates an enormous number of 5-letter words.  
To maximize information in the second guess we need a fresh set of common letters that were not used in the first guess.  
Good candidates that avoid A, R, O, S, E include:  
- T, I, N, L, U (common consonants and a vowel)

A balanced choice that covers different common letters is “UNTIL” (U, N, T, I, L).

From the feedback so far:

- Letters that are **not** in the word at all: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I  
- Letters that **are** in the word but in the wrong place: U and L  

So the secret word contains the letters U and L somewhere, and it does **not** contain A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I.  
That leaves consonants like B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z and the remaining vowels Y and (possibly) U and L.

We now want a guess that:
1. Keeps the known letters U and L in different positions from their previous ones.
2. Uses only letters that have not been ruled out.
3. Introduces new common letters to maximize information.

Previous positions:
- U was in position 1 → try positions 2, 3, 4, or 5
- L was in position 5 → try positions 1, 2, 3, or 4

Let’s try a word that moves U and L and introduces new common consonants.  
A good candidate is “BUILD”:
- B, U, I, L, D  
But I is already ruled out, so this is invalid.

Next candidate: “CLUMP”
- C, L, U, M, P  
This uses new letters C, M, P and moves U to position 3 and L to position 2.  
All letters are allowed by the current constraints.

Therefore, “CLUMP” is a good next guess.

Summary of everything we know so far:

Letters that are NOT in the word:  
A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, C, M, P

Letters that ARE in the word (but position still unknown):  
U and L

Positions ruled out for U:  
- Cannot be in position 1 (was first tried there in “until”)  
- Cannot be in position 3 (was tried there in “clump”)

Positions ruled out for L:  
- Cannot be in position 5 (was tried there in “until”)  
- Cannot be in position 2 (was tried there in “clump”)

So:
- U must be in position 2, 4, or 5  
- L must be in position 1, 3, or 4  

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Contains both U and L  
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated  
- Places U and L in still-allowed positions  

Remaining common consonants and vowels available:  
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the remaining vowels Y (sometimes) and the still-allowed U and L.

Let’s look for a word that fits:

Try to place U in position 2 and L in position 1:  
L _ U _ _ → L U _ _ _ → but “LU___” is not a common pattern; let’s see if any word fits.

Alternatively, place U in position 4 and L in position 1:  
L _ _ U _ → e.g., L U C K Y – but C, K are allowed, and Y is allowed.  
But we must check all letters are allowed.  
L, U, C, K, Y: C and K were not ruled out yet?  
Wait, C was ruled out in “clump” feedback (C(x)).  
So C is not allowed.  
So L U _ _ _ is not possible with allowed letters.

Try U in position 5 and L in position 1:  
L _ _ _ U → e.g., L U B S T – but S, T are ruled out.  
L A B E L – A, E ruled out.  
L U D I C – I, C ruled out.  
Not promising.

Try U in position 2 and L in position 3:  
_ U L _ _ → e.g., B U L L Y – B, U, L, Y are allowed, and L is allowed in position 3 (was only ruled out of position 2).  
Check letters: B, U, L, L, Y – all are allowed (none in the forbidden list).  
“BULLY” is a valid 5-letter word.

Let’s verify:
- B: allowed  
- U: allowed, in position 2 (not ruled out)  
- L: allowed, in position 3 (was only ruled out of 2 and 5)  
- L: same  
- Y: allowed  

This seems valid and introduces new letters B and Y to gain more information.
