For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has a good mix of common letters to maximize the information gained. The best starting words typically contain:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
- No repeated letters

Some popular strong starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - vowel-heavy
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers very common letters and provides good coverage across the alphabet.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but NOT in the 3rd position
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has A somewhere except position 3
- Doesn't use S, L, T, E

Good letters to try next: R, N, I, O, U, C, M, P, D, etc.

A strong next guess should use fresh common letters while incorporating the known A.  
""CRANK"" uses C, R, N, K and places A in position 3 - but that's the same position ruled out.  
""DRANK"" - same issue.  
""ROUND"" - no A.  
""CHAOS"" - has S (ruled out).  
""GRAIN"" - has A in position 3 again.  
""ADORN"" - A is first, uses D, O, R, N. No ruled-out letters. This seems good.

""ADORN"" gives:
A in position 1 (new position), D, O, R, N - none of which are ruled out.

- uses R in a new position (say 2),
- introduces fresh common letters (C, M, P, etc.).

From all feedback so far:

Letters we know are in the word (but possibly in wrong positions):
- C (now confirmed in position 1)
- R (must be in the word, but not in position 2 or 4)
- A (must be in the word, but not in positions 1, 3)

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
S, L, T, E, D, O, N, M, P

So far the secret word looks like:
C _ _ _ _

Known letters to place: R, A, plus three unknown letters from the remaining unused pool.

Positions so far:
- Position 1: C (✓)
- R cannot be in 2 or 4, so possible positions for R: 3 or 5
- A cannot be in 1 or 3, so possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5

Let's try to combine these constraints:

Case 1: R in position 3
Then A must be in 2, 4, or 5
Word shape: C A R _ _  (but A in 2, R in 3)
Or C _ R A _  (R in 3, A in 4)
Or C _ R _ A  (R in 3, A in 5)

Case 2: R in position 5
Then A must be in 2 or 4
Word shape: C _ _ A R  (A in 4, R in 5)
Or C _ A _ R  (A in 3 - but A cannot be in 3 from SLATE feedback)

From SLATE feedback: A is not in position 3, so A cannot be in 3.

Thus:
- If R is in 3, A can be in 2,4,5
- If R is in 5, A can be in 2,4

We need to pick a word that satisfies these constraints and introduces new letters we haven't tried yet.

Unused common letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let's try:
- C A R _ _ : next letters could be B, F, G, H, I, K, U, V, W, Y
  - C A R B _ - but we need 5 letters, let's think of full words
  - C A R B I - but I is okay
  - C A R B I - but we need to check if all letters are allowed
  - C A R B I - C, A, R, B, I - none are ruled out
  - But we need to check positions: A in 2, R in 3 - both are allowed

But we need to be careful - we have to make sure the word is valid.

Another option:
C _ _ A R - with A in 4, R in 5
Possible letters for 2 and 3: from unused pool
C H I A R - but I is okay
C H I A R - C, H, I, A, R - none are ruled out
This seems valid

Another option:
C A R I S - but S is ruled out
C A R I S - invalid

C A R V A - but A is repeated and position 5 would be A, which is allowed, but we don't know if A can repeat - but the original word is 5 letters, and A could appear twice
But we have no info that A can't repeat, so this is possible

But let's pick the most straightforward word that fits the constraints and introduces new letters.

Let's try C H I A R - but is this a valid word? No, ""CHIA R"" isn't a word.

Wait, let's think of valid words:
C A R B I - ""CARBI"" isn't a word
C A R V A - ""CARVA"" isn't a word
C A R G I - ""CARGI"" isn't a word

Let me think differently - we need to pick a word where:
- C is first
- Contains R and A
- R not in 2 or 4
- A not in 1 or 3
- No ruled out letters

Valid words that fit:
- C A R A R - but repeated letters and seems unlikely
- C A R V A - not valid
- C A R B O - but O is ruled out
- C A R V I - ""CARVI"" isn't a word
- C A R B A - ""CARBA"" isn't a word

Wait, let's list possible positions:
C _ _ _ _
R must be in 3 or 5
A must be in 2,4,5

Option 1: R in 3, A in 2
Word shape: C A R _ _
Letters left: from unused pool (B, F, G, H, I, K, Q, U, V, W, Y, Z)
Need two more letters
Possible combinations:
C A R B I - but ""CARBI"" isn't a word
C A R G I - ""CARGI"" isn't a word
C A R V I - ""CARVI"" isn't a word
C A R H I - ""CARHI"" isn't a word
C A R F I - ""CARFI"" isn't a word
C A R K I - ""CARKI"" isn't a word
C A R B A - ""CARBA"" isn't a word
C A R V A - ""CARVA"" isn't a word
C A R I A - ""CARIA"" isn't a word
C A R U A - ""CARUA"" isn't a word

Option 2: R in 3, A in 4
Word shape: C _ R A _
Letters left: from unused pool
C H R A P - but P is ruled out
C H R A K - K is okay, but ""CHRAK"" isn't a word
C H R A V - ""CHR AV"" isn't a word
C H R A B - ""CHRAB"" isn't a word
C H R A F - ""CHR AF"" isn't a word
C H R A I - ""CHRAI"" isn't a word
C H R A U - ""CHRAU"" isn't a word

Option 3: R in 3, A in 5
Word shape: C _ R _ A
Letters left: from unused pool
C H I R A - but R is in 3, A in 5 - this would be C H I R A
Check letters: C, H, I, R, A - none are ruled out
Check positions: 
- C in 1 (✓)
- R in 3 (allowed, since R was in 2 and 4 before)
- A in 5 (allowed, since A was in 1,3 before)
- H and I are new letters
- I is a new letter
This seems valid - ""CHIRA"" isn't a word, but ""CHIRP"" is, but P is ruled out
Wait, ""CHIRP"" has P which is ruled out
""CHIRA"" isn't valid
""CIARA"" - but A is repeated and we don't know if allowed

Option 4: R in 5, A in 2
Word shape: C A _ _ R
Letters left: from unused pool
C A R I S - S is ruled out
C A R I K - ""CARIK"" isn't a word
C A R I V - ""CARIV"" isn't a word
C A R I B - ""CARIB"" - this is actually a valid word (a variant spelling of ""caribou"" or ""carib"") but might be obscure
C A R I G - ""CARIG"" isn't a word
C A R I H - ""CARIH"" isn't a word

Option 5: R in 5, A in 4
Word shape: C _ _ A R
Letters left: from unused pool
C H I A R - but ""CHIA R"" isn't a word
C H U A R - ""CHUAR"" isn't a word
C I G A R - ""CIGAR"" - this is a valid word
Check letters: C, I, G, A, R - none are ruled out
Check positions:
- C in 1 (✓)
- I in 2 (new)
- G in 3 (new)
- A in 4 (allowed, since A was in 1,3 before)
- R in 5 (allowed, since R was in 2,4 before)
This seems perfect - ""CIGAR"" fits all constraints

Thus, the best next guess is CIGAR
</think>

Based on the feedback, we now know:
- C is correctly placed in position 1.
- R and A are both in the word, but not in their previously tried positions.
- Many letters have been eliminated (S, L, T, E, D, O, N, M, P).

The most straightforward valid word that fits these constraints is:
