For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", ""ADIEU"", etc.

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A good starting word would include:
- Common vowels (A, E, O, I)
- Common consonants (S, T, R, N, L)

After considering these factors, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to test.

From the feedback on “arose” we now know:
- A is in the word but is not in the 1st position.
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains an A somewhere (not in position 1).
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses A in a position other than first.
- Avoids R, O, S, E entirely.

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already confirmed, and E is ruled out).

Let’s pick a word that:
- Places A in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- Uses other common letters that haven’t been ruled out.

A strong candidate is “plaid”:
- P, L, I, D are all new letters.
- A is in position 2, satisfying the “A is somewhere else” clue.

But wait—let me double-check:
- Letters in “plaid”: P, L, A, I, D.
- None of P, L, I, D are R, O, S, E.
- A is in position 3, which is allowed.

Another candidate could be “tubed”, but B and U are also new. However, “plaid” uses more common letters (P, L, I, D).

After reconsidering, “plaid” seems like the best next guess.

Another good candidate is “cutie” – but I and E are ruled out.

Another candidate is “tugan” – G, N allowed, but A is in position 4.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", ""ADIEU"", etc.

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A good starting word would include:
- Common vowels (A, E, O, I)
- Common consonants (S, T, R, N, L)

After considering these factors, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to test.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)

<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose” we now know:
- A is in the word but is not in the 1st position.
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains an A somewhere (not in position 1).
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses A in a position other than first.
- Avoids R, O, S, E entirely.

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already confirmed, and E is ruled out).

Let’s pick a word that:
- Places A in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- Uses other common letters that haven’t been ruled out.

A strong candidate is “plaid”:
- P, L, I, D are all new letters.
- A is in position 2, satisfying the “A is somewhere else” clue.

But wait—let me double-check:
- Letters in “plaid”: P, L, A, I, D.
- None of P, L, I, D are R, O, S, E.
- A is in position 3, which is allowed.

Another candidate could be “tubed”, but B and U are also new. However, “plaid” uses more common letters (P, L, I, D).

After reconsidering, “plaid” seems like the best next guess.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A exactly once, and in position 2, 4, or 5.
2. Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Let’s try to pick a word that:
- Places A in position 2 (middle) to maximize information.
- Uses new common consonants and vowels (T, N, C, U, M, etc.).

Candidate words:
- “tacit” – but T, C, I, T are allowed except I is already ruled out.
- “began” – G, N allowed, but E is ruled out.
- “cannon” – too long.
- “tuban” – B, N allowed, but E is ruled out (no E here), and A is in position 4. This could work.

“tuban”:
- Letters: T, U, B, A, N.
- None of T, U, B, N are in the eliminated list.
- A is in position 4, which is allowed.

Another good candidate is “cutie” – but I and E are ruled out.

Another candidate is “tugan” – G, N allowed, but A is in position 4.

Uses only letters not yet eliminated.\n\nLet’s try to pick a word that:\n- Places A in position 2 (middle) to maximize information.\n- Uses new common consonants and vowels (T, N, C, U, M, etc.).\n\nCandidate words:\n- “tacit” – but T, C, I, T are allowed except I is already ruled out.\n- “began” – G, N allowed, but E is ruled out.\n- “cannon” – too long.\n- “tuban” – B, N allowed, but E is ruled out (no E here), and A is in position 4. This could work.\n\n“tuban”:\n- Letters: T, U, B, A, N.\n- None of T, U, B, N are in the eliminated list.\n- A is in position 4, which is allowed.\n\nAnother good candidate is “cutie” – but I and E are ruled out.\n\nAnother candidate is “tugan” – G, N allowed, but A is in position 4.\n\nLet’s go with “tuban” as it uses new letters and positions A in 4.\n\nWait – let me check if “tuban” is a valid 5-letter English word. Yes, it is (a type of drum).\n\nFinal choice: “tuban”.\n\n<guess>tuban</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: plaid -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) I(x) D(x)\nGuess 3: tuban -> FEEDBACK: T(-) U(✓) B(x) A(-) N(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback so far:\n\n1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)  \n   – A is in the word but NOT in position 1.  \n   – R, O, S, E are NOT in the word.\n\n2. plaid → P(x) L(x) A(-) I(x) D(x)  \n   – A is in the word but NOT in position 3.  \n   – P, L, I, D are NOT in the word.\n\n3. tuban → T(-) U(✓) B(x) A(-) N(-)  \n   – U is in the word and in the correct position 2.  \n   – T, B, A, N are in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 respectively.  \n   – B is NOT in the word.\n\nSo we now know:\n\n- Word pattern: _ U _ _ _ (U is fixed in position 2).  \n- A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4.

From the latest feedback on “fanta” we now know:

- F is NOT in the word.  
- A is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
- N is in the word and in the correct position 3.  
- T is in the word and in the correct position 4.  
- A is in the word and in the correct position 5.

So the pattern is now: _ U N T A.

We also know the letters NOT in the word (from all feedback so far):
R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D, B, F.

Letters still allowed (and required to be used):
- Position 1: any letter NOT yet eliminated and not already placed.  
Allowed letters left: C, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus A, N, T (but A, N, T are already fixed in positions 5, 3, 4).

Therefore position 1 must be one of C, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word matching _ U N T A.

Possible words:
- C U N T A – CUNTA is not valid.  
- G U N T A – GUNTA is not valid.  
- H U N T A – HUNTA is not valid.  
- M U N T A – MUNTA is not valid.  
- V U N T A – VUNTA is not valid.  
- W U N T A – WUNTA is not valid.  

The only valid English word that fits _ U N T A is “gunta” (a variant spelling or nickname), but it’s not recognized in standard dictionaries.  

Rechecking: is there any other valid word?  
“Junta” is a valid word (a political council), and it fits: J U N T A.  

- J: allowed (not yet eliminated).  
- U: fixed in position 2.  
- N: fixed in position 3.  
- T: fixed in position 4.  
- A: fixed in position 5.  

Thus, the only remaining valid guess is JUNTA.
