### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses some of these high-frequency letters in different positions to help narrow down possibilities quickly. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters and tests vowels in multiple positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains O, but NOT in position 3.
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has O somewhere except position 3.
2. Does NOT have A, R, S, E.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and E are out; O is already known to be in).

I'll try a word like ""POINT"":
- P, I, N, T are new letters.
- O is in position 2 (not 3), satisfying the feedback.

This should give good coverage of new letters while respecting the constraints.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T.
- Letter O is in the word and is in position 2 (✓).

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: D, L, C, G, B, F, H, K, M, U, Y, W, V, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O fixed in position 2.
- No other letters from the excluded set (A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T).

Let’s look for a word like _ O _ _ _ using the remaining letters.  
Some candidates:
- DOUBT – but T is excluded.
- COULD – but U and L are allowed, D is allowed.
- GOLLY – but L and Y are allowed, G is allowed.
- MOLLY – but M and L are allowed, Y is allowed.
- WOMAN – but W and M are allowed, N is excluded.

“COULD” uses C, U, L, D and keeps O in position 2.  
“GOLLY” uses G, L, L, Y.  
“MOLLY” uses M, L, L, Y.

Among these, “COULD” introduces three new letters (C, U, L, D) efficiently.  
Let’s go with “COULD”.

From all feedback so far:

Known facts
- O is fixed in position 2 (✓).
- Letters NOT in the word at all: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, C, U, L.
- Letters that ARE in the word somewhere (but not yet pinned down): D (it appeared as “D(-)” in position 5).

Remaining candidate letters (not yet ruled out):
- Consonants: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Vowels: O (already placed), none left among A E I U, so no other vowel is present.

So the secret word looks like: _ O _ _ _
and must contain the letter D somewhere (but not in position 5, because the previous D was marked “-” meaning it’s in the word but not in position 5).

Therefore D must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Also, every other letter must come from the remaining set.

Let’s list possible placements of D:

1. D O _ _ _  → Need 3 more letters from {B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z}
2. _ O D _ _  → Need 3 more letters from the same set.
3. _ O _ D _  → Need 3 more letters from the same set.
4. _ O _ _ D  → But D was “-” in position 5 before, so this is impossible.

So we can ignore the last case.

We need a common word that fits one of the first three patterns.

Scanning common 5-letter words:
- D _ O _ _  → “DOING” uses I and N, both already excluded.
- _ O D _ _  → “BODGY” uses B, G, Y – all allowed.
- _ O _ D _  → “HOLDY” uses H, L, D, Y – but L is excluded.
- _ O _ _ D  → impossible, as noted.

“BODGY” looks valid:
- B, O, D, G, Y – none of the excluded letters appear.
- O is in position 2 (✓).
- D is in position 4 (not 5), so this is compatible with D being in the word but not in position 5.

Let’s try “BODGY”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses some of these high-frequency letters in different positions to help narrow down possibilities quickly. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters and tests vowels in multiple positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains O, but NOT in position 3.
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has O somewhere except position 3.
2. Does NOT have A, R, S, E.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and E are out; O is already known to be in).

I'll try a word like ""POINT"":
- P, I, N, T are new letters.
- O is in position 2 (not 3), satisfying the feedback.

This should give good coverage of new letters while respecting the constraints.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T.
- Letter O is in the word and is in position 2 (✓).

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: D, L, C, G, B, F, H, K, M, U, Y, W, V, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O fixed in position 2.
- No other letters from the excluded set (A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T).

Let’s look for a word like _ O _ _ _ using the remaining letters.  
Some candidates:
- DOUBT – but T is excluded.
- COULD – but U and L are allowed, D is allowed.
- GOLLY – but L and Y are allowed, G is allowed.
- MOLLY – but M and L are allowed, Y is allowed.
- WOMAN – but W and M are allowed, N is excluded.

“COULD” uses C, U, L, D and keeps O in position 2.  
“GOLLY” uses G, L, L, Y.  
“MOLLY” uses M, L, L, Y.

Among these, “COULD” introduces three new letters (C, U, L, D) efficiently.  
Let’s go with “COULD”.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T.
- Letter O is in the word and is in position 2 (✓).

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: D, L, C, G, B, F, H, K, M, U, Y, W, V, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O fixed in position 2.
- No other letters from the excluded set (A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T).

Let’s look for a word like _ O _ _ _ using the remaining letters.  
Some candidates:
- DOUBT – but T is excluded.
- COULD – but U and L are allowed, D is allowed.
- GOLLY – but L and Y are allowed, G is allowed.
- MOLLY – but M and L are allowed, Y is allowed.
- WOMAN – but W and M are allowed, N is excluded.

“COULD” uses C, U, L, D and keeps O in position 2.  
“GOLLY” uses G, L, L, Y.  
“MOLLY” uses M, L, L, Y.

Among these, “COULD” introduces three new letters (C, U, L, D) efficiently.

From all feedback so far:

Known facts
- O is fixed in position 2 (✓).
- Letters NOT in the word at all: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, C, U, L.
- Letters that ARE in the word somewhere (but not yet pinned down): D (it appeared as “D(-)” in position 5).

Remaining candidate letters (not yet ruled out):
- Consonants: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Vowels: O (already placed), none left among A E I U, so no other vowel is present.

So the secret word looks like: _ O _ _ _
and must contain the letter D somewhere (but not in position 5, because the previous D was marked “-” meaning it’s in the word but not in position 5).

Therefore D must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Also, every other letter must come from the remaining set.

Let’s list possible placements of D:

1. D O _ _ _  → Need 3 more letters from {B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z}
2. _ O D _ _  → Need 3 more letters from the same set.
3. _ O _ D _  → Need 3 more letters from the same set.
4. _ O _ _ D  → But D was “-” in position 5 before, so this is impossible.

So we can ignore the last case.

We need a common word that fits one of the first three patterns.

Scanning common 5-letter words:
- D _ O _ _  → “DOING” uses I and N, both already excluded.
- _ O D _ _  → “BODGY” uses B, G, Y – all allowed.
- _ O _ D _  → “HOLDY” uses H, L, D, Y – but L is excluded.
- _ O _ _ D  → impossible, as noted.

“BODGY” looks valid:
- B, O, D, G, Y – none of the excluded letters appear.
- O is in position 2 (✓).
- D is in position 4 (not 5), so this is compatible with D being in the word but not in position 5.

Let’s try “BODGY”.

- B(x) → B is not in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in position 2 (already known).
- D(✓) → D is in position 3.
- G(✓) → G is in position 4.
- Y(✓) → Y is in position 5.

So the word structure is now fully determined:
Position 1: unknown, but must be a letter not yet ruled out.
Position 2: O
Position 3: D
Position 4: G
Position 5: Y

Letters already ruled out include A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, C, U, L, B.  
Remaining possible letters for position 1: F, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z (and any others not yet used).

Looking for common 5-letter words matching the pattern _ O D G Y:
- FODGY – but F is still possible.
- HODGY – H is possible.
- MODGY – M is possible.
- WODGY – W is possible.

The most common word among these is ""FODGY"". Let’s check:
- F is not yet ruled out.
- O, D, G, Y are already confirmed in their correct positions.

Thus, ""FODGY"" is the logical next guess.

A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, C, U, L, B, F.

Still-allowed consonants for the first slot are:  
H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z.

The only common English word that fits H O D G Y, J O D G Y, K O D G Y, M O D G Y, V O D G Y, W O D G Y, X O D G Y, or Z O D G Y is “HODGY”.  
All letters except the first are already confirmed, and H has never been tested.
