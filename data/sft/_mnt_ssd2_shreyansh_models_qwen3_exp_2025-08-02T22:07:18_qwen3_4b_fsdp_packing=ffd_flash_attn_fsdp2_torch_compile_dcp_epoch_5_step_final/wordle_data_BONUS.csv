### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many letters quickly. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which vowels are present and their positions, as well as whether R or S are in the word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains O and S.
- Does NOT contain A, R, E.
- The O cannot be in position 3 (since it was in position 3 and marked -).
- The S cannot be in position 4 (since it was in position 4 and marked -).

I need a 5-letter word that includes O and S, excludes A, R, E, and places O and S in different positions than above. Good consonants left include D, N, T, L, C, etc. A simple word that fits: SOUND.
- Uses O and S.
- Does not use A, R, E.
- O is in position 2 (not 3), S is in position 4 (but this was marked -, so SOUND is invalid because S cannot be in position 4).

Next try: SOUND is invalid. Try STONY:
- S in position 1 (new position), O in position 2 (new position). Uses S and O, excludes A, R, E. Looks valid.

But let me check another word: DOING:
- O in position 1 (new), S not present. Needs S, so invalid.

Another: SONIC:
- S in position 1, O in position 2. Uses S and O, excludes A, R, E. Valid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many letters quickly. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which vowels are present and their positions, as well as whether R or S are in the word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains O and S.
- Does NOT contain A, R, E.
- The O cannot be in position 3 (since it was in position 3 and marked -).
- The S cannot be in position 4 (since it was in position 4 and marked -).

I need a 5-letter word that includes O and S, excludes A, R, E, and places O and S in different positions than above. Good consonants left include D, N, T, L, C, etc. A simple word that fits: SOUND.
- Uses O and S.
- Does not use A, R, E.
- O is in position 2 (not 3), S is in position 4 (but this was marked -, so SOUND is invalid because S cannot be in position 4).

Next try: SOUND is invalid. Try STONY:
- S in position 1 (new position), O in position 2 (new position). Uses S and O, excludes A, R, E. Looks valid.

But let me check another word: DOING:
- O in position 1 (new), S not present. Needs S, so invalid.

Another: SONIC:
- S in position 1, O in position 2. Uses S and O, excludes A, R, E. Valid.

I'll go with SONIC.

Guess 2: sonic -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(✓) N(✓) I(x) C(x)
<|im_end|>

From the new feedback on SONIC:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓).  
- N is in the word and in the correct position (✓).  
- I and C are NOT in the word (x).

So far we know:
- Correct letters in exact positions: O in 2nd, N in 3rd.  
- Correct letters but wrong positions: S must appear somewhere else (not position 1).  
- Excluded letters: A, R, E, I, C.

We need a 5-letter word with pattern _ O N _ _ that also contains S somewhere (not in position 1). Remaining unused consonants: D, T, L, B, G, M, P, etc.

Possible words:
- SOUND: S in 1st (invalid, S must not be in 1st).  
- STONY: S in 1st (invalid).  
- BOUND: no S.  
- GONYS: S in 5th (valid), but GONYS is uncommon.  
- DONUS: uncommon.  
- TONYS: S in 5th, but TONYS is slang.  
- SONIC: already tried.  
- PONDS: S in 5th, P and D untried. PONDS fits _ O N _ _ and has S in 5th (allowed).

PONDS:
- P, O, N, D, S.  
- O in 2nd (correct), N in 3rd (correct), S in 5th (allowed).  
- Excludes all known bad letters.

Let's use PONDS.
