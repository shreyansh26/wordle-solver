For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in 5-letter English words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

Popular and effective starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (covers R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U - but uses 4 vowels which might be too limiting)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it includes 3 vowels (A, I, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage for identifying letters in the secret word.

- O, U, N, D are all new letters we haven’t tested yet.

But let’s check if this is optimal. Another option could be “SLOTH” or “STONY”, but let’s go with “SOUND” as it tests S, O, U, N, D.

However, let me reconsider: we know S is in the word but not at position 4. “SOUND” puts S at position 1, which is fine. But maybe a better choice is “SLOTH” which also tests S, L, O, T, H.

From feedback, banned letters so far: R, A, I, E, L, T, H. So S, O are already placed, and M, C, K, U, N, D, etc. are allowed. SOUND seems simpler as it uses U, N, D.

3. Uses other common letters we haven’t ruled out yet.

Letters still possible (common ones): T, N, L, O, U, D, C, M, P, etc.

A good candidate would include S plus other common letters. Let’s try “SOUND”:
- S is in position 1 (not 4, so possible).
- O, U, N, D are all new letters we haven’t tested yet.

But let’s check if this is optimal. Another option could be “SLOTH” or “STONY”, but let’s go with “SOUND” as it tests S, O, U, N, D.

However, let me reconsider: we know S is in the word but not at position 4. “SOUND” puts S at position 1, which is fine. But maybe a better choice is “SLOTH” which also tests S, L, O, T, H.

I’ll choose “SLOTH” as it tests S (position 1), L, O, T, H — all new letters.

From the new feedback on SLOTH:
- S(✓) → S is in the word and now we know it is in position 1.

- O(✓) → O is in the word and now we know it is in position 3.
- T(x) → T is not in the word.
- H(x) → H is not in the word.

Summary of what we now know:
- Letters in the word and their positions:
  – S must be in position 1.
  – O must be in position 3.
- Letters NOT in the word: R, A, I, E, L, T, H.
- We still need to determine positions 2 and 5.

Letters that remain possible (common ones not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, Z.

We need two more letters for positions 2 and 5. Common consonants that haven’t been ruled out include N, M, D, C, K, etc. Common vowels left are U (since A, E, I, O are either ruled out or already placed).

Let’s try to pick a word that fits:
- Pattern: S _ O _ _
- Possible letters for positions 2 and 5: from remaining letters.

Good candidates:
- SCORN – but R and N are allowed? Wait, R is ruled out (from RAISE feedback), so R is out. So SCORN is invalid (R is out).
- SOUND – but U is allowed, N is allowed, D is allowed. Let’s check: S(1) O(3) U(2) N(4) D(5). Letters used: S, O, U, N, D. All letters are allowed (not in the banned list). Also, positions fit: S at 1, O at 3. This seems good.
- SMOCK – C and K are allowed, but T is already ruled out (not relevant here), but K is allowed. However, M is allowed, C is allowed. But we need to check if any letters are ruled out. From feedback, banned letters so far: R, A, I, E, L, T, H. So S, O are already placed, and M, C, K, U, N, D, etc. are allowed. SOUND seems simpler as it uses U, N, D.

Let's carefully interpret the new feedback on SOUND:

S(✓)  → S is correct in position 1  
O(-)  → O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (it was placed at position 3 in SLOTH and marked ✓, so this feedback is contradictory unless we re-read carefully).  
Wait: in SLOTH, O was at position 3 and marked ✓, so O must be in position 3.  
Therefore, in SOUND, O at position 2 being marked (-) is impossible because we already know O is in position 3.  
This suggests the feedback must be interpreted per-letter in the current guess, not globally.

Re-parse SOUND feedback:
- S(✓) : S is in position 1 and is correct.
- O(-) : O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (but we know from SLOTH that O is in position 3, so this is consistent—O is in position 3, so this feedback is redundant or misleading).
- U(x) : U is not in the word.
- N(x) : N is not in the word.
- D(x) : D is not in the word.

So far we know:
- S is fixed at position 1.
- O is fixed at position 3.
- Letters ruled out: R, A, I, E, L, T, H, U, N, D.

Remaining possible letters (common ones): B, C, F, G, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z.

We need to fill positions 2 and 5.  
Position 4 is currently empty but we have no info yet.

But we have O in position 3, so the pattern is:
S _ O _ _

We need two more letters for positions 2 and 5, chosen from the remaining letters.  
Let’s look for common 5-letter words fitting S _ O _ _ with no disallowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- SCOPE – P and E, but E is ruled out.
- SCOWL – W and L, but L is ruled out.
- SPOOK – K and K, but O is already used in position 3.
- SMOKE – K and E, E is ruled out.
- SCOPY – Y is allowed, but this is obscure.
- SFOOK – F and K, but SFOOK is not a valid word.
- SPOOF – P and F are allowed, but O is already used in position 3, so SPOOF would be S P O O F, which repeats O in position 4—probably invalid because O is only once in the word (from feedback, O appears only once in the word).
- SMOCK – C and K are allowed, but we need to check if O appears only once. SMOCK is S M O C K, which fits S _ O _ _ with no repeated O. But we have no info on C or K yet.

Let’s try SMOCK:

Letters used: S, M, O, C, K.  
None of these are in the ruled-out list.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in 5-letter English words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

Popular and effective starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (covers R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U - but uses 4 vowels which might be too limiting)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it includes 3 vowels (A, I, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage for identifying letters in the secret word.

Let's carefully process the new feedback on SMOCK:

SMOCK → S(✓) M(x) O(✓) C(-) K(x)

- S(✓) at position 1 – already confirmed.
- O(✓) at position 3 – already confirmed.
- M(x) – M is NOT in the word.
- K(x) – K is NOT in the word.
- C(-) – C is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So far we know:
- Fixed: S _ O _ _
- Ruled-out letters: R, A, I, E, L, T, H, U, N, D, M, K
- C is in the word but NOT at position 4, so it must be at position 2 or 5.
- We still need to fill positions 2, 4, 5 with letters not yet ruled out.

Remaining possible letters (common ones): B, C, F, G, J, P, V, W, Y, Z

Because C must appear somewhere, and positions 1 and 3 are fixed, C must be at position 2 or 5.

Let's test both cases:

Case 1: C at position 2 → S C O _ _
We need a letter for position 4 and 5 from the remaining letters (B, F, G, J, P, V, W, Y, Z).
Looking for common words: SCOWL (but L is out), SCOPE (E is out), SCOPY (rare), SCOOT (O is already used once). No obvious valid word.

Case 2: C at position 5 → S _ O _ C
We need a letter for position 2 and 4 from the remaining letters.
Possible combinations:
- S P O W C – not a word
- S P O B C – not a word
- S V O B C – not a word
- S F O B C – not a word
- S W O B C – not a word
- S B O W C – not a word

But ""SPOOC"" is not valid. However, ""SWOOP"" is a word but has O in position 4 which would duplicate O.

Wait, let's think of ""SPOOK"" but K is out. ""SPOOF"" has F and O but O is already in position 3.

Actually, let's consider ""SWOOP"":
- S W O O P – but O appears twice, and our feedback only shows one O (from SLOTH and SOUND). So this is likely invalid.

Another valid word fitting S _ O _ C is ""SPOOC"" but it's not valid. The only valid word I can find is ""SPOOK"" but K is out.

Let me reconsider remaining letters. Maybe ""SPOOF"" but F is allowed and O is already in position 3. However, this would have O in position 4 which might be acceptable if the word has two O's. But our previous feedback only indicates one O.

Actually, let's try ""SWOOP"" even if it has two O's – the feedback didn't specify only one O. But ""SWOOP"" is S W O O P.

But P hasn't been ruled out yet. Let's check:
Letters used: S, W, O, O, P
Ruled-out letters don't include W or P, so this is possible.

However, we have C(-) meaning C is in the word but not at position 4. So C must be at position 2 or 5. In SWOOP, C isn't used, so this is invalid.

Back to drawing board. We must use C at position 2 or 5.

The only valid word I can find with C at position 2 is ""SCOP_"" but we need a valid word ending. ""SCOPY"" is obscure. 

Actually, ""SCOWL"" is invalid (L is out). 

Wait, let's think of ""SCOP"" plus a letter. ""SCOPB"" – no. 

It seems the only plausible word is ""SCOP"" but it's 4 letters. 

But we have ""C(-)"" meaning C is in the word, so we must use C. The only possible position is position 2 or 5.

Let me try C at position 2: S C O _ _
We need two more letters from remaining: B, F, G, J, P, V, W, Y, Z
Looking for common words: ""SCOB"" – no, needs 5 letters. ""SCOP"" – 4 letters. 

Actually, ""SCOP"" is part of ""SCOP"" but not helpful.

Wait, let's try ""SCOP"" plus a letter at position 5: ""SCOPB"" – no. 

This path seems limited. Let me try C at position 5: S _ O _ C
We need letters for position 2 and 4 from remaining: B, F, G, J, P, V, W, Y, Z
Possible combinations:
- S P O B C – not a word
- S P O F C – not a word
- S P O W C – not a word
- S V O B C – not a word
- S W O B C – not a word

But ""SWOOP"" is invalid as it doesn't use C. 

Actually, ""SPOOC"" is not valid. 

I realize I'm stuck. Let me list valid 5-letter words fitting S _ O _ C or S C O _ _.

Valid words:
- SCOWL – L is out
- SCOPE – E is out
- SCOPY – obscure
- SPOOF – F and O, but O is already in position 3
- SWOOP – two O's possible

But we must use C. The only valid word I can find is ""SCOPY"" but it's rare. 

However, ""SCOPY"" is valid (a copy of a drawing). Let's try it:

SCOPY: S C O P Y
Check letters:
- S, C, O, P, Y – none are ruled out except P and Y haven't been used yet. This fits all constraints:
  - S at 1 ✓
  - C at 2 (since C must be used)
  - O at 3 ✓
  - P and Y are new letters

From the feedback on SMOCK we now know:
- S is fixed at position 1
- O is fixed at position 3
- M and K are not in the word
- C is in the word but NOT at position 4, so it must be at position 2 or 5

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in 5-letter English words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

Popular and effective starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (covers R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U - but uses 4 vowels which might be too limiting)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it includes 3 vowels (A, I, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage for identifying letters in the secret word.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- I(x) → I is not in the word.
- S(-) → S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at position 4).
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains S but not in position 4.
- The word does NOT contain R, A, I, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has S somewhere other than position 4.
2. Does not contain R, A, I, E.
3. Uses other common letters we haven’t ruled out yet.

Letters still possible (common ones): T, N, L, O, U, D, C, M, P, etc.

A good candidate would include S plus other common letters. Let’s try “SOUND”:
- S is in position 1 (not 4, so possible).
- O, U, N, D are all new letters we haven’t tested yet.

But let’s check if this is optimal. Another option could be “SLOTH” or “STONY”, but let’s go with “SOUND” as it tests S, O, U, N, D.

However, let me reconsider: we know S is in the word but not at position 4. “SOUND” puts S at position 1, which is fine. But maybe a better choice is “SLOTH” which also tests S, L, O, T, H.

I’ll choose “SLOTH” as it tests S (position 1), L, O, T, H — all new letters.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: SLOTH -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) O(✓) T(x) H(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on SLOTH:
- S(✓) → S is in the word and now we know it is in position 1.
- L(x) → L is not in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in the word and now we know it is in position 3.
- T(x) → T is not in the word.
- H(x) → H is not in the word.

Summary of what we now know:
- Letters in the word and their positions:
  – S must be in position 1.
  – O must be in position 3.
- Letters NOT in the word: R, A, I, E, L, T, H.
- We still need to determine positions 2 and 5.

Letters that remain possible (common ones not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, Z.

We need two more letters for positions 2 and 5. Common consonants that haven’t been ruled out include N, M, D, C, K, etc. Common vowels left are U (since A, E, I, O are either ruled out or already placed).

Let’s try to pick a word that fits:
- Pattern: S _ O _ _
- Possible letters for positions 2 and 5: from remaining letters.

Good candidates:
- SCORN – but R and N are allowed? Wait, R is ruled out (from RAISE feedback), so R is out. So SCORN is invalid (R is out).
- SOUND – but U is allowed, N is allowed, D is allowed. Let’s check: S(1) O(3) U(2) N(4) D(5). Letters used: S, O, U, N, D. All letters are allowed (not in the banned list). Also, positions fit: S at 1, O at 3. This seems good.
- SMOCK – C and K are allowed, but T is already ruled out (not relevant here), but K is allowed. However, M is allowed, C is allowed. But we need to check if any letters are ruled out. From feedback, banned letters so far: R, A, I, E, L, T, H. So S, O are already placed, and M, C, K, U, N, D, etc. are allowed. SOUND seems simpler as it uses U, N, D.

Let’s go with SOUND as it fills positions 2, 4, 5 with new letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SLOTH -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) O(✓) T(x) H(x)
Guess 3: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's carefully interpret the new feedback on SOUND:

S(✓)  → S is correct in position 1  
O(-)  → O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (it was placed at position 3 in SLOTH and marked ✓, so this feedback is contradictory unless we re-read carefully).  
Wait: in SLOTH, O was at position 3 and marked ✓, so O must be in position 3.  
Therefore, in SOUND, O at position 2 being marked (-) is impossible because we already know O is in position 3.  
This suggests the feedback must be interpreted per-letter in the current guess, not globally.

Re-parse SOUND feedback:
- S(✓) : S is in position 1 and is correct.
- O(-) : O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (but we know from SLOTH that O is in position 3, so this is consistent—O is in position 3, so this feedback is redundant or misleading).
- U(x) : U is not in the word.
- N(x) : N is not in the word.
- D(x) : D is not in the word.

So far we know:
- S is fixed at position 1.
- O is fixed at position 3.
- Letters ruled out: R, A, I, E, L, T, H, U, N, D.

Remaining possible letters (common ones): B, C, F, G, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z.

We need to fill positions 2 and 5.  
Position 4 is currently empty but we have no info yet.

But we have O in position 3, so the pattern is:
S _ O _ _

We need two more letters for positions 2 and 5, chosen from the remaining letters.  
Let’s look for common 5-letter words fitting S _ O _ _ with no disallowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- SCOPE – P and E, but E is ruled out.
- SCOWL – W and L, but L is ruled out.
- SPOOK – K and K, but O is already used in position 3.
- SMOKE – K and E, E is ruled out.
- SCOPY – Y is allowed, but this is obscure.
- SFOOK – F and K, but SFOOK is not a valid word.
- SPOOF – P and F are allowed, but O is already used in position 3, so SPOOF would be S P O O F, which repeats O in position 4—probably invalid because O is only once in the word (from feedback, O appears only once in the word).
- SMOCK – C and K are allowed, but we need to check if O appears only once. SMOCK is S M O C K, which fits S _ O _ _ with no repeated O. But we have no info on C or K yet.

Let’s try SMOCK:
- S(1) ✓
- M(2) ? 
- O(3) ✓
- C(4) ?
- K(5) ?

Letters used: S, M, O, C, K.  
None of these are in the ruled-out list.  
SMOCK is a valid 5-letter word.

Therefore, the next logical guess is SMOCK.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SLOTH -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) O(✓) T(x) H(x)

Guess 4: SMOCK -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) M(x) O(✓) C(-) K(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's carefully process the new feedback on SMOCK:

SMOCK → S(✓) M(x) O(✓) C(-) K(x)

- S(✓) at position 1 – already confirmed.
- O(✓) at position 3 – already confirmed.
- M(x) – M is NOT in the word.
- K(x) – K is NOT in the word.
- C(-) – C is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So far we know:
- Fixed: S _ O _ _
- Ruled-out letters: R, A, I, E, L, T, H, U, N, D, M, K
- C is in the word but NOT at position 4, so it must be at position 2 or 5.
- We still need to fill positions 2, 4, 5 with letters not yet ruled out.

Remaining possible letters (common ones): B, C, F, G, J, P, V, W, Y, Z

Because C must appear somewhere, and positions 1 and 3 are fixed, C must be at position 2 or 5.

Let's test both cases:

Case 1: C at position 2 → S C O _ _
We need a letter for position 4 and 5 from the remaining letters (B, F, G, J, P, V, W, Y, Z).
Looking for common words: SCOWL (but L is out), SCOPE (E is out), SCOPY (rare), SCOOT (O is already used once). No obvious valid word.

Case 2: C at position 5 → S _ O _ C
We need a letter for position 2 and 4 from the remaining letters.
Possible combinations:
- S P O W C – not a word
- S P O B C – not a word
- S V O B C – not a word
- S F O B C – not a word
- S W O B C – not a word
- S B O W C – not a word

But ""SPOOC"" is not valid. However, ""SWOOP"" is a word but has O in position 4 which would duplicate O.

Wait, let's think of ""SPOOK"" but K is out. ""SPOOF"" has F and O but O is already in position 3.

Actually, let's consider ""SWOOP"":
- S W O O P – but O appears twice, and our feedback only shows one O (from SLOTH and SOUND). So this is likely invalid.

Another valid word fitting S _ O _ C is ""SPOOC"" but it's not valid. The only valid word I can find is ""SPOOK"" but K is out.

Let me reconsider remaining letters. Maybe ""SPOOF"" but F is allowed and O is already in position 3. However, this would have O in position 4 which might be acceptable if the word has two O's. But our previous feedback only indicates one O.

Actually, let's try ""SWOOP"" even if it has two O's – the feedback didn't specify only one O. But ""SWOOP"" is S W O O P.

But P hasn't been ruled out yet. Let's check:
Letters used: S, W, O, O, P
Ruled-out letters don't include W or P, so this is possible.

However, we have C(-) meaning C is in the word but not at position 4. So C must be at position 2 or 5. In SWOOP, C isn't used, so this is invalid.

Back to drawing board. We must use C at position 2 or 5.

The only valid word I can find with C at position 2 is ""SCOP_"" but we need a valid word ending. ""SCOPY"" is obscure. 

Actually, ""SCOWL"" is invalid (L is out). 

Wait, let's think of ""SCOP"" plus a letter. ""SCOPB"" – no. 

It seems the only plausible word is ""SCOP"" but it's 4 letters. 

But we have ""C(-)"" meaning C is in the word, so we must use C. The only possible position is position 2 or 5.

Let me try C at position 2: S C O _ _
We need two more letters from remaining: B, F, G, J, P, V, W, Y, Z
Looking for common words: ""SCOB"" – no, needs 5 letters. ""SCOP"" – 4 letters. 

Actually, ""SCOP"" is part of ""SCOP"" but not helpful.

Wait, let's try ""SCOP"" plus a letter at position 5: ""SCOPB"" – no. 

This path seems limited. Let me try C at position 5: S _ O _ C
We need letters for position 2 and 4 from remaining: B, F, G, J, P, V, W, Y, Z
Possible combinations:
- S P O B C – not a word
- S P O F C – not a word
- S P O W C – not a word
- S V O B C – not a word
- S W O B C – not a word

But ""SWOOP"" is invalid as it doesn't use C. 

Actually, ""SPOOC"" is not valid. 

I realize I'm stuck. Let me list valid 5-letter words fitting S _ O _ C or S C O _ _.

Valid words:
- SCOWL – L is out
- SCOPE – E is out
- SCOPY – obscure
- SPOOF – F and O, but O is already in position 3
- SWOOP – two O's possible

But we must use C. The only valid word I can find is ""SCOPY"" but it's rare. 

However, ""SCOPY"" is valid (a copy of a drawing). Let's try it:

SCOPY: S C O P Y
Check letters:
- S, C, O, P, Y – none are ruled out except P and Y haven't been used yet. This fits all constraints:
  - S at 1 ✓
  - C at 2 (since C must be used)
  - O at 3 ✓
  - P and Y are new lettersFrom the feedback on SMOCK we now know:
- S is fixed at position 1
- O is fixed at position 3
- M and K are not in the word
- C is in the word but NOT at position 4, so it must be at position 2 or 5

The only valid 5-letter word that fits these constraints is:

We need to fill positions 4 and 5.  
Letters already ruled out (in any position):  
R, A, I, E, L, T, H, U, N, D, M, K, Y

Letters still allowed: B, F, G, J, V, W, Z, and P (since P is in the word but not at position 4).

Because P is in the word and cannot be at position 4, it must be at position 5.  
Thus the word must be: S C O _ P

The only common 5-letter word that fits this exact pattern is:

S C O U P

But U is already ruled out (from SOUND feedback: U(x)).  
So SCOUT is invalid.

Next possible combination: S C O B P, S C O F P, S C O G P, etc.  
None of these are valid English words.

However, we have not yet ruled out B, F, G, J, V, W, Z.  
Looking for valid words: S C O _ P, the only valid one is SCOP_ but we need 5 letters.

Wait, let's list all valid 5-letter words starting with SCO and ending with P:
- SCOP_ – none fit except SCOPY (already tried) and SCOPP (double P), but Y is out and double P is unlikely.

Actually, the only valid word fitting S C O _ P is SCOPP (as in ""scopp"" – but this is obscure). However, the more common word is SCOUT which we know is invalid (U is out).

This suggests we need to re-examine P(-) interpretation. P is in the word but not at position 4, so it could be at position 5. The only valid word with P at position 5 is SCOPP, but this is not standard.

Alternatively, perhaps P is at position 4 and the feedback was misinterpreted. But feedback clearly says P(-) meaning P is in word but not at position 4.

Given constraints, the only possible valid word is:

This suggests we need to re-examine P(-) interpretation. P is in the word but not at position 4, so it could be at position 5. The only valid word with P at position 5 is SCOPP, but this is not standard.

Alternatively, perhaps P is at position 4 and the feedback was misinterpreted. But feedback clearly says P(-) meaning P is in word but not at position 4.

Given constraints, the only possible valid word is:

<guess>SCOPP</guess>",Guess 6: SCOPP -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(✓) O(✓) P(-) P(✓),FAIL
