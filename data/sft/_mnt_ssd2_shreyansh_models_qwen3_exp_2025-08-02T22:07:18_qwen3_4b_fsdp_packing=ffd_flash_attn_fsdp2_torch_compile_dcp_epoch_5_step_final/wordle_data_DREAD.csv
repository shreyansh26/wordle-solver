### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use some of these letters without repeating any. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 unique common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels that might appear in the secret word. This will help us quickly identify which letters are present and their possible positions.

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use some of these letters without repeating any. \n\nLooking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 unique common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels that might appear in the secret word.

So far we know:
- The word is _ R E A D _
- Letters already ruled out for position 1: A (from arose, though A is already known to be in position 4), B (from bread), T (from tread), O, S
- Actually, position 1 can’t be B, T, O, or S.
- Letters already confirmed in their correct positions: R (2), E (3), A (4), D (5)
- Therefore the word is [?]READ where ? is a consonant not yet ruled out.

Common consonants not yet ruled out for position 1: C, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking at common English words ending in “READ”:
- CREAD → not a valid word
- FREAD → not a valid word
- GREAD → not a valid word
- PREAD → not a valid word
- CREAD → not valid
- Actually, the only common valid word that fits _READ is “C” followed by READ? No, CREAD isn’t valid.
- Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words ending in READ:
  - BREAD – already tried, B ruled out
  - CREAD – invalid
  - FREAD – invalid
  - GREAD – invalid
  - CREAD – invalid
  - Actually, the only common valid word ending in READ is “BREAD”, which we already tried with B ruled out.
  - Are there any others? Let me think…
  - “SREAD” – invalid, S ruled out
  - “TREAD” – T ruled out
  - “GREAD” – invalid
  - “CREAD” – invalid
  - “DREAD” – D is already in position 5
  - “HREAD” – not a valid word
  - “NREAD” – not a valid word
  - “CREAD” – invalid
  - “FREAD” – invalid
  - “SREAD” – invalid
  - “TREAD” – invalid (T ruled out)
  - “GREAD” – invalid
  - “CREAD” – invalid
  - “BREAD” – already tried
  - “DREAD” – D already in position 5
  - “FREAD” – invalid
  - “HREAD” – invalid
  - “LREAD” – invalid
  - “MREAD” – invalid
  - “NREAD” – invalid
  - “PREAD” – invalid
  - “VREAD” – invalid
  - “WREAD” – invalid
  - “YREAD” – invalid

Wait, let me double-check a dictionary list of 5-letter words ending in “READ”:

Common valid words ending in “READ”:
- BREAD
- CREAD – not valid
- DREAD
- FREAD – not valid
- GREAD – not valid
- HREAD – not valid
- LREAD – not valid
- MREAD – not valid
- NREAD – not valid
- PREAD – not valid
- SREAD – not valid
- TREAD
- VREAD – not valid
- WREAD – not valid
- YREAD – not valid

So the only valid words are BREAD (B ruled out), TREAD (T ruled out), and DREAD (D already in position 5). None of these fit.

This suggests I may have made an error. Let me re-examine:

The pattern is _ R E A D _, so the word must be [?][R][E][A][D]. The only valid English word that matches this exact pattern is “BREAD”, but B was ruled out in position 1. 

This implies either:
1. I missed another valid word, or
2. There’s an error in my previous reasoning.

Upon closer inspection, the only valid 5-letter word that matches _ R E A D exactly is “BREAD”, and since B was ruled out, there must be no other word. This suggests the secret word must be “BREAD”, but B is invalid. 

However, this contradicts, so I must have missed a word. Let me check again:

Looking up valid 5-letter words ending in “READ”:

- LREAD – invalid
- MREAD – invalid
- NREAD – invalid
- PREAD – invalid
- SREAD – invalid
- TREAD
- VREAD – invalid
- WREAD – invalid
- YREAD – invalid

The only valid ones are BREAD, DREAD, and TREAD. Among these, BREAD and TREAD have been tried (with B and T ruled out), leaving DREAD. However, DREAD has D in position 1 and 5, but our feedback shows D is in position 5 only. 

But the pattern is _ R E A D _, so the first letter must be a single consonant, and DREAD fits this exact pattern: D R E A D. 

Since D is already confirmed in position 5, and no other letters are ruled out for position 1 except B, T, O, S, the only remaining valid word is DREAD.

Therefore, the next guess must be DREAD.

The feedback from previous guesses has locked the second, third, fourth, and fifth letters as R, E, A, D respectively. The only remaining unknown is the first letter. After checking valid 5-letter words that fit the pattern _ R E A D _, the only candidate not yet ruled out is **DREAD**.
