### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

For the first guess, we want a word that uses common letters to maximize the information we can gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters in different positions. 

Some good options would be:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)

I'll choose ""STARE"" as it uses 5 of the most common letters and gives us good coverage for vowels and consonants.

- S is NOT in the word (x)
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
- The word contains A and E, but not in positions 3 or 5 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain S, T, R.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A and E somewhere (not in positions 3 or 5)
- Does not have S, T, R

Good letters to try next: N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

A good candidate would be a word like:
- CLANE (but this has N and L)
- PLANE (but P and L)
- LANCE (L, A, N, C, E) - A is in position 2, E in position 5. But E cannot be in position 5 per feedback.

Next candidate: ANGEL - A in 1, E in 4. Letters A, N, G, E, L. Does not contain S, T, R. This seems good.

Another candidate: PANEL - A in 2, E in 4. Letters P, E, N, A, L. Also good.

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: STARE → S(x) T(x) A(-) R(x) E(-)
Guess 2: PANEL → P(x) A(-) N(x) E(-) L(✓)

What we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: S, T, R, P, N
2. Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong place: A, E
3. Letter that IS in the word and in the correct place: L in position 5.

So the word ends in L and contains both A and E somewhere in positions 1-4, but:
- A cannot be in position 2 (from PANEL)
- E cannot be in position 4 (from STARE or PANEL)
- A cannot be in position 3 (from STARE)

Possible positions for A: 1, 4
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3
And they must be in different positions.

Good remaining consonants to try: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try to construct a word that:
- Ends in L
- Contains both A and E
- Does not use S, T, R, P, N
- Places A and E in allowed positions

A promising pattern is _ _ E _ L with A in position 1 or 4, and E in 2 or 3.

Trying A in 1 and E in 2: A E _ _ L → A E C _ L → AECL_ is not a valid pattern.
Trying A in 1 and E in 3: A _ E _ L → A C E _ L → ACESL is not valid.
Trying A in 4 and E in 1: E _ _ A L → E C _ A L → ECAL_ is not valid.
Trying A in 4 and E in 2: _ E _ A L → C E _ A L → C E M A L → CEMAL is not valid.
Trying A in 4 and E in 3: _ _ E A L → C O E A L → COEAL is not valid.

Let’s try another pattern: _ A _ E L. From STARE, A cannot be in position 3 (it’s in position 3 in STARE and was marked “-”, so A cannot be in position 3). From PANEL, A cannot be in position 2. So A could be in position 1 or 4. If we put A in 1: A _ _ E L → A C H E L → ACHEL is not valid. If we put A in 4: _ _ _ A L → C H E A L → CHEAL is not valid.

Another pattern: A _ E _ L → A C E D L → ACEDL is not valid.

Let’s try a word that uses M and C: _ _ _ _ L with A and E somewhere. How about C A E D L → CAEDL is not valid.

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words ending in L that contain both A and E, without S, T, R, P, N.

Some candidates:

- FABLE: A in 2 (invalid), E in 4 (invalid)
- GABLE: A in 2 (invalid), E in 4 (invalid)
- HABLE: not a word
- LANCE: N is invalid
- MABLE: not a word
- WABLE: not a word

Let’s try E A _ _ L: E A C _ L → EAC_L is not valid.

Another approach: use remaining common letters. Let’s try D, G, M, V, etc.

How about V E R T L? R and T are invalid.

Let’s try G E M A L: A in 4, E in 2. Letters: G, E, M, A, L. Does not contain S, T, R, P, N. A is in 4 (allowed), E is in 2 (allowed), L is in 5 (correct). GEMAL is not a valid word.

Possible positions:
A: 1 or 4
E: 1, 2, or 3
And they must be in different positions.

Let’s try A in 1 and E in 2: A E _ _ L → AE_ _ L. Need two consonants not used yet (not S, T, R, P, N). Let’s try C and D: A E C D L → AEC DL is not valid.

A in 1 and E in 3: A _ E _ L → A C E D L → ACEDL is not valid.

A in 4 and E in 1: E _ _ A L → E C _ A L → ECAL_ is not valid.

A in 4 and E in 2: _ E _ A L → C E _ A L → C E M A L → CEMAL is not valid.

A in 4 and E in 3: _ _ E A L → C _ E A L → C H E A L → CHEAL is not valid.

Valid word: C H E A L is not valid. How about C H E A L → no.

Valid word: V E R T L → R and T invalid.

Valid word: M E A L _ → needs 5 letters ending in L.

Wait, let’s try a word with A in 4 and E in 2: _ E _ A L. Let’s try D E B A L → DEBAL is not valid.

Valid word: D E C A L → DECAL (as in “decimal”).

DECAL:
- Ends in L (✓)
- Contains A and E (A in 4, E in 2)
- A is in 4 (allowed, since it was in 3 in STARE and 2 in PANEL, so 4 is new)
- E is in 2 (allowed, since it was in 4 and 5 in previous guesses)
- Letters used: D, E, C, A, L. None of the forbidden letters (S, T, R, P, N).

DECAL is a valid 5-letter word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want a word that uses common letters to maximize the information we can gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters in different positions. 

Some good options would be:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)

I'll choose ""STARE"" as it uses 5 of the most common letters and gives us good coverage for vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(-) R(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on STARE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
- The word contains A and E, but not in positions 3 or 5 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain S, T, R.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A and E somewhere (not in positions 3 or 5)
- Does not have S, T, R

Good letters to try next: N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

A good candidate would be a word like:
- CLANE (but this has N and L)
- PLANE (but P and L)
- LANCE (L, A, N, C, E) - A is in position 2, E in position 5. But E cannot be in position 5 per feedback.

Next candidate: ANGEL - A in 1, E in 4. Letters A, N, G, E, L. Does not contain S, T, R. This seems good.

Another candidate: PANEL - A in 2, E in 4. Letters P, E, N, A, L. Also good.

I'll choose PANEL as it uses common letters and positions A and E in new spots.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(-) R(x) E(-)
Guess 2: PANEL -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) N(x) E(-) L(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: STARE → S(x) T(x) A(-) R(x) E(-)
Guess 2: PANEL → P(x) A(-) N(x) E(-) L(✓)

What we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: S, T, R, P, N
2. Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong place: A, E
3. Letter that IS in the word and in the correct place: L in position 5.

So the word ends in L and contains both A and E somewhere in positions 1-4, but:
- A cannot be in position 2 (from PANEL)
- E cannot be in position 4 (from STARE or PANEL)
- A cannot be in position 3 (from STARE)

Possible positions for A: 1, 4
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3
And they must be in different positions.

Good remaining consonants to try: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try to construct a word that:
- Ends in L
- Contains both A and E
- Does not use S, T, R, P, N
- Places A and E in allowed positions

A promising pattern is _ _ E _ L with A in position 1 or 4, and E in 2 or 3.

Trying A in 1 and E in 2: A E _ _ L → A E C _ L → AECL_ is not a valid pattern.
Trying A in 1 and E in 3: A _ E _ L → A C E _ L → ACESL is not valid.
Trying A in 4 and E in 1: E _ _ A L → E C _ A L → ECAL_ is not valid.
Trying A in 4 and E in 2: _ E _ A L → C E _ A L → C E M A L → CEMAL is not valid.
Trying A in 4 and E in 3: _ _ E A L → C O E A L → COEAL is not valid.

Let’s try another pattern: _ A _ E L. From STARE, A cannot be in position 3 (it’s in position 3 in STARE and was marked “-”, so A cannot be in position 3). From PANEL, A cannot be in position 2. So A could be in position 1 or 4. If we put A in 1: A _ _ E L → A C H E L → ACHEL is not valid. If we put A in 4: _ _ _ A L → C H E A L → CHEAL is not valid.

Another pattern: A _ E _ L → A C E D L → ACEDL is not valid.

Let’s try a word that uses M and C: _ _ _ _ L with A and E somewhere. How about C A E D L → CAEDL is not valid.

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words ending in L that contain both A and E, without S, T, R, P, N.

Some candidates:
- CABLE: A in 2 (invalid, A cannot be in 2), E in 4 (invalid, E cannot be in 4)
- FABLE: A in 2 (invalid), E in 4 (invalid)
- GABLE: A in 2 (invalid), E in 4 (invalid)
- HABLE: not a word
- LANCE: N is invalid
- MABLE: not a word
- WABLE: not a word

Let’s try E A _ _ L: E A C _ L → EAC_L is not valid.

Another approach: use remaining common letters. Let’s try D, G, M, V, etc.

How about V E R T L? R and T are invalid.

Let’s try G E M A L: A in 4, E in 2. Letters: G, E, M, A, L. Does not contain S, T, R, P, N. A is in 4 (allowed), E is in 2 (allowed), L is in 5 (correct). GEMAL is not a valid word.

Valid word: G E M E L → GEMEL is not valid.

Valid word: V E R T L → R and T invalid.

Valid word: C H E A L → CHEAL is not valid.

Valid word: C H A E L → CHAEL is not valid.

Valid word: M E A L _ → needs 5 letters ending in L.

Wait, let’s list valid words ending in L with A and E:

- CABLE: invalid positions for A and E
- FABLE: invalid
- GABLE: invalid
- HABLE: no
- LANCE: N invalid
- MABLE: no
- WABLE: no

Let me think differently. The word must end in L, contain A and E, and A not in 2 or 3, E not in 4.

Possible positions:
A: 1 or 4
E: 1, 2, or 3
And they must be in different positions.

Let’s try A in 1 and E in 2: A E _ _ L → AE_ _ L. Need two consonants not used yet (not S, T, R, P, N). Let’s try C and D: A E C D L → AEC DL is not valid.

A in 1 and E in 3: A _ E _ L → A C E D L → ACEDL is not valid.

A in 4 and E in 1: E _ _ A L → E C _ A L → ECAL_ is not valid.

A in 4 and E in 2: _ E _ A L → C E _ A L → C E M A L → CEMAL is not valid.

A in 4 and E in 3: _ _ E A L → C _ E A L → C H E A L → CHEAL is not valid.

Valid word: C H E A L is not valid. How about C H E A L → no.

Valid word: V E R T L → R and T invalid.

Valid word: M E A L _ → needs 5 letters ending in L.

Wait, let’s try a word with A in 4 and E in 2: _ E _ A L. Let’s try D E B A L → DEBAL is not valid.

Valid word: D E C A L → DECAL (as in “decimal”).

DECAL:
- Ends in L (✓)
- Contains A and E (A in 4, E in 2)
- A is in 4 (allowed, since it was in 3 in STARE and 2 in PANEL, so 4 is new)
- E is in 2 (allowed, since it was in 4 and 5 in previous guesses)
- Letters used: D, E, C, A, L. None of the forbidden letters (S, T, R, P, N).

   - Word pattern: _ E _ A L

2. Forbidden letters (never appear): S, T, R, P, N, C

3. Letters that must appear somewhere, but we already placed A, E, L, so we need two more distinct letters in positions 1 and 3 that:
   - are NOT forbidden
   - are NOT already used (we haven’t seen them yet)

4. From earlier feedback:
   - D was marked (-) in DECAL, meaning D is in the word but not in position 1. Since position 1 is still open, D could be in position 3.
   - So one of the letters in positions 1 or 3 must be D in position 3.

5. Therefore:
   - Position 3 must be D (since D is in the word and can’t be in position 1 or 5, and 5 is L)
   - Position 1 must be a consonant that is not forbidden and not yet used.

6. Remaining possible consonants for position 1 (excluding S, T, R, P, N, C, and excluding letters already used in E, A, L, D): B, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y, etc.

7. Let’s try a common consonant like B for position 1: B E D A L → BEdal is not a valid word.
