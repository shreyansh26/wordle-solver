### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should cover these common letters without repeating any. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

From the feedback:
- S is in the correct first position (✓)
- A is in the word but not in the third position (-) – so it must be in positions 2, 4, or 5
- T is in the word but not in the fourth position (-) – so it must be in positions 2, 3, or 5
- L and E are not in the word at all (x)

So far we know:
1. Word starts with S
2. Contains A (not in position 3)
3. Contains T (not in position 4)
4. Does not contain L or E

Let’s try to pick a word that:
- Starts with S
- Uses A and T in new positions
- Avoids L and E

A good candidate is ""STAIR"":
- S stays in position 1
- T moves to position 2
- A moves to position 3 (but we know A is not in position 3 from the feedback), so this might not work.

Another candidate: ""STAR"":
- Only 4 letters, so invalid.

Next: ""SATCH"":
- Has C and H, but E is excluded, and T is in position 4 (forbidden).

Next: ""SAINT"":
- Starts with S, has A and T, avoids L and E.
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since previous A was in position 3)
- T is in position 5 (allowed, since previous T was in position 4)
- Letters S, A, I, N, T: all valid, no L or E.

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(-) E(x)
   - S is fixed in position 1.

   - T is in the word but NOT in position 4.
   - L and E are absent.

2. SAINT → S(✓) A(-) I(x) N(x) T(-)
   - S is still fixed in position 1.
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 2 (since it shows “-”).
   - I and N are absent.
   - T is in the word but NOT in position 5 (since it shows “-”).

So far we know:
- Word pattern: S _ _ _ _
- Must contain A (positions 3 and 2 are ruled out) → A can only be in 4 or 5.
- Must contain T (positions 4 and 5 are ruled out) → T can only be in 2 or 3.
- Letters already ruled out: L, E, I, N.
- Remaining common consonants and vowels to test: R, C, D, G, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Let’s try to place T in position 2 and A in position 4:
S T _ A _

A valid word fitting this pattern is “STARE”, but E is already ruled out.
Next possibility: “STARK” – E is out, K is still allowed.
Another: “STARK” – same issue.
Try A in position 5 and T in position 3:
S _ T _ A
A valid word here is “SPORT” – but O and R are still allowed, P is allowed.
Check: S P O R T – but T must be in position 3 or 2, and A must be in 4 or 5. In “SPORT”, A is not present, so this is invalid.

Wait, we need A in 4 or 5 and T in 2 or 3.

Option 1: T in 2, A in 4 → S T _ A _
   - “STARK” – E is out, K allowed, but A is in 4, T in 2. However, E is ruled out, but K is fine.
   - “STARK” has A in 4 and T in 2: this fits.

Option 2: T in 3, A in 5 → S _ T _ A
   - “STARK” again has T in 3 and A in 5: same word.

So “STARK” fits both possibilities. Let’s verify:
- S(✓) fixed.
- T in 2 or 3: allowed.
- A in 4 or 5: allowed.

Thus, “STARK” is a valid next guess.

   - S is still fixed in position 1.
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 2 (since it shows “-”).
   - I and N are absent.
   - T is in the word but NOT in position 5 (since it shows “-”).

So far we know:
- Word pattern: S _ _ _ _
- Must contain A (positions 3 and 2 are ruled out) → A can only be in 4 or 5.
- Must contain T (positions 4 and 5 are ruled out) → T can only be in 2 or 3.
- Letters already ruled out: L, E, I, N.
- Remaining common consonants and vowels to test: R, C, D, G, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Let’s try to place T in position 2 and A in position 4:
S T _ A _

A valid word fitting this pattern is “STARE”, but E is already ruled out.
Next possibility: “STARK” – E is out, K is still allowed.
Another: “STARK” – same issue.
Try A in position 5 and T in position 3:
S _ T _ A
A valid word here is “SPORT” – but O and R are still allowed, P is allowed.
Check: S P O R T – but T must be in position 3 or 2, and A must be in 4 or 5. In “SPORT”, A is not present, so this is invalid.

Wait, we need A in 4 or 5 and T in 2 or 3.

Option 1: T in 2, A in 4 → S T _ A _
   - “STARK” – E is out, K allowed, but A is in 4, T in 2. However, E is ruled out, but K is fine.
   - “STARK” has A in 4 and T in 2: this fits.

Option 2: T in 3, A in 5 → S _ T _ A
   - “STARK” again has T in 3 and A in 5: same word.

So “STARK” fits both possibilities. Let’s verify:
- S(✓) fixed.
- T in 2 or 3: allowed.
- A in 4 or 5: allowed.
- No L, E, I, N.

Thus, “STARK” is a valid next guess.

From the latest feedback:

We now know:
1. S is fixed in position 1.
2. T is fixed in position 2.
3. A is fixed in position 3.
4. R and K are NOT in the word.

Previous deductions:
- A must be in position 4 or 5 (but now we see it’s in 3), so this new feedback actually contradicts the earlier feedback unless the earlier interpretation was wrong. Wait, no—this new feedback shows A is in position 3 with ✓, so A is indeed in position 3 after all. That means the earlier feedback about A being in the word but not in position 3 or 2 is now superseded: A is in position 3.

So the word now looks like: S T A _ _

Letters ruled out so far: L, E, I, N, R, K.

We need to fill positions 4 and 5 with letters not yet ruled out. Common remaining consonants: C, D, G, M, P, U, Y, etc. Vowels left: O, U (since A is already used).

Possible endings:
- SATUR – but U is allowed, R is out.
- SATOM – M and O are allowed.
- SATUP – T is already used in position 2, so can’t repeat.
- SATUM – U and M are allowed.

A valid 5-letter word fitting S T A _ _ with no ruled-out letters is “SATUM” (though not common), but a better common word is “STAMP” – but P and M are allowed, and T is already used in position 2, so can’t have T again.

Another candidate: “STAND” – but N is ruled out.

“STASH” – H is allowed, but S would repeat in position 5, which is fine as long as S is allowed in position 5 (it wasn’t ruled out).

But let’s check: S T A _ _ with letters not ruled out (no L, E, I, N, R, K).

Possible combinations:
- S T A C _
  - STACO – O is allowed, but CO is a valid ending? “STACO” is a word (a musical term), but rare.

- S T A M _
  - STAMP – P is allowed, M is allowed. This is a common word.

- S T A O _
  - STAON – not a word.

- S T A P _
  - STAPL – L is out.
  - STAPE – E is out.

“STAMP” seems the most plausible common word.

But wait: STAMP has P in position 5 and M in position 4: S T A M P. This fits all constraints:
- S T A are fixed in positions 1-3.
- M and P are not yet ruled out.
- No R, K, L, E, I, N.

Thus, “STAMP” is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should cover these common letters without repeating any. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- S is in the correct first position (✓)
- A is in the word but not in the third position (-) – so it must be in positions 2, 4, or 5
- T is in the word but not in the fourth position (-) – so it must be in positions 2, 3, or 5
- L and E are not in the word at all (x)

So far we know:
1. Word starts with S
2. Contains A (not in position 3)
3. Contains T (not in position 4)
4. Does not contain L or E

Let’s try to pick a word that:
- Starts with S
- Uses A and T in new positions
- Avoids L and E

A good candidate is ""STAIR"":
- S stays in position 1
- T moves to position 2
- A moves to position 3 (but we know A is not in position 3 from the feedback), so this might not work.

Another candidate: ""STAR"":
- Only 4 letters, so invalid.

Next: ""SATCH"":
- Has C and H, but E is excluded, and T is in position 4 (forbidden).

Next: ""SAINT"":
- Starts with S, has A and T, avoids L and E.
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since previous A was in position 3)
- T is in position 5 (allowed, since previous T was in position 4)
- Letters S, A, I, N, T: all valid, no L or E.

This seems like a strong guess.

Check: S P O R T – but T must be in position 3 or 2, and A must be in 4 or 5. In “SPORT”, A is not present, so this is invalid.

Wait, we need A in 4 or 5 and T in 2 or 3.

Option 2: T in 3, A in 5 → S _ T _ A

Current known facts:

1. Positions 1-3 are fixed: S T A _ _
2. Letters already ruled out: L, E, I, N, R, K, M, P
3. Still-allowed consonants for positions 4-5: C, D, G, H, J, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we’ll stick to common ones)
4. Still-allowed vowels for positions 4-5: O, U (A already used in position 3)

We need a 5-letter word of the form “STA__” using only allowed letters.  
Common English words in this pattern:

- STACO – not a valid word  
- STAFF – F is allowed, double F is okay; no ruled-out letters  
- STAGS – G and S (S repeats, but that’s fine)  
- STAND – N is out  
- STARK – K is out  
- STARE – E is out  
- STASH – H is allowed, S repeats  
- STAYS – Y and S allowed, but double S is okay  

Among these, “STAFF” is the most common word that fits all constraints.

Let’s verify:  
S T A F F  
- F not yet ruled out  
- No forbidden letters (L, E, I, N, R, K, M, P)  
- Double F is acceptable in English words.

Therefore, “STAFF” is the logical next guess.
