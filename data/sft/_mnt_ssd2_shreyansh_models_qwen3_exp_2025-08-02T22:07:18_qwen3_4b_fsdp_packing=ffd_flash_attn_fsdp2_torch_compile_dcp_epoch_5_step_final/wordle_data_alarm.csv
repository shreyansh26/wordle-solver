### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information I can gain. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

A good strategy is to use a word with:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, T, N, S, L, etc.)
3. No repeated letters to maximize coverage

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S, T (very common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)
- L (common consonant)
- No repeated letters

This gives me good coverage across common letters and should provide useful feedback for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → position 2 is L
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (–) → A exists somewhere else
- T is NOT in the word (x)

- Word pattern: _ L _ _ _
- Contains the letter A somewhere (not in position 3)
- Does NOT contain S, T, or E

Good letters to use next: R, N, I, O, C, H, U, D, M, etc.  
We also want to place A in a new spot and keep the L locked in position 2.

- L: confirmed in position 2

This means selecting a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. \n\nA good strategy is to use a word with:\n1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)\n2. Common consonants (R, T, N, S, L, etc.)\n3. No repeated letters to maximize coverage\n\nOne of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:\n- S, T (very common consonants)\n- A, E (common vowels)\n- L (common consonant)\n- No repeated letters\n\nThis gives me good coverage across common letters and should provide useful feedback for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>SLATE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on SLATE:\n- S is NOT in the word (x)\n- L is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → position 2 is L\n- A is in the word but in the wrong position (–) → A exists somewhere else\n- T is NOT in the word (x)\n- E is NOT in the word (x)\n\nSo far we know:\n- Word pattern: _ L _ _ _\n- Contains the letter A somewhere (not in position 3)\n- Does NOT contain S, T, or E\n\nGood letters to use next: R, N, I, O, C, H, U, D, M, etc.  \nWe also want to place A in a new spot and keep the L locked in position 2.\n\nA strong candidate is “CLAMP”:\n- C: new consonant\n- L: confirmed in position 2\n- A: placed in position 3 (different from feedback, so it will test if A is elsewhere)\n- M: new consonant\n- P: new consonant\n\nThis tests new letters while checking where A fits and keeping L locked.\n\n<guess>CLAMP</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: CLAMP -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(✓) A(✓) M(-) P(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two rounds of feedback:\n\n1.

From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

- Pattern: _ L _ _ _
- Must contain A and M.
- A is NOT in position 3 (from SLATE) and NOT in position 4 (from GLAMB) → A must be in position 1 or 5.
- M is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (from CLAMP and GLAMB) → M must be in position 1, 2, or 5.  
  – Position 2 is already L, so M must be in position 1 or 5.

Therefore the only remaining possibilities for the positions are:
- If M is in position 1: M L _ _ _ with A in position 5 → M L _ _ A
- If A is in position 1: A L _ _ _ with M in position 5 → A L _ _ M

We still need to test consonants for the remaining blanks while keeping these constraints in mind.  
Let’s try the first case: M L _ _ A  
A common consonant pair that fits is “M L R D A” → MLRDA is not a word, but “ML” plus a consonant and “A” gives us “ML”…  
A valid word is “MLA” but it’s only 3 letters.  
Wait, we need 5 letters.  
Let’s try “M L A N A” – but A is already in position 5.  
Another valid word that fits M L _ _ A is “MLVNA” – but that’s not common.  
Let’s instead try the other case: A L _ _ M.

A common word that fits A L _ _ M is “ALARM”.  
Check:
- A in position 1 (allowed)
- L in position 2 (locked)
- R (new letter)
- A (allowed in position 4)
- M in position 5 (allowed)

This uses all constraints and tests R in position 3 and 4.

So the next guess is ALARM.
