For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. Among these, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- 3 very common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- This combination gives good coverage to potentially reveal multiple letters in the secret word.

I'll go with AROSE as my first guess to gather maximum information about the letters present in the secret word.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely absent: A, O, S
- Letters present somewhere: R, E
- R is not in position 2, E is not in position 5

I want a new word that:
1. Contains R and E (since they are in the word)
2. Does NOT contain A, O, S
3. Uses common letters to maximize information
4. Places R and E in new positions to test their correct spots

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out, and E is already confirmed)

Let me try ""TREND"":

But wait, from arose, R is in the word but not in position 2, so placing R in position 2 in ""trend"" would be redundant. Let me rethink.

Better to place R and E in new positions. Let's try ""ENTRY"":
- E: position 1 (new position)

But this might not use common letters effectively. Another option is ""TIMER"":

I'll go with AROSE as my first guess to gather maximum information about the letters present in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word, but not in position 2 (-)
- O: not in the word (x)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word, but not in position 5 (-)

So far we know:
- Letters definitely absent: A, O, S
- Letters present somewhere: R, E
- R is not in position 2, E is not in position 5

I want a new word that:
1. Contains R and E (since they are in the word)
2. Does NOT contain A, O, S
3. Uses common letters to maximize information
4. Places R and E in new positions to test their correct spots

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out, and E is already confirmed)

Let me try ""TREND"":
- T: new letter
- R: in position 2 (but we know R is not in position 2 from arose feedback, so this will confirm or deny R's position)
- E: in position 3 (new position)
- N: new letter
- D: new letter

But wait, from arose, R is in the word but not in position 2, so placing R in position 2 in ""trend"" would be redundant. Let me rethink.

Better to place R and E in new positions. Let's try ""ENTRY"":
- E: position 1 (new position)
- N: new letter
T: new letter
R: position 4 (new position)
Y: new letter

But this might not use common letters effectively. Another option is ""TIMER"":
- T: new letter
I: new vowel
M: new letter
E: position 4 (new position)
R: position 5 (new position)

This seems good because:
- Uses T, I, M which are common
- Places E in position 4 and R in position 5 to test their correct spots
- Doesn't use any confirmed absent letters (A, O, S)Based on the feedback from ""arose"", I know:
- R and E are in the word, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.
- A, O, and S are not in the word.

I need a new word that contains R and E but avoids A, O, S, and places R and E in different positions to narrow down their correct spots.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tiger -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on ""tiger"":
- T(x) I(x) G(x): T, I, G are not in the word.
- E(✓): E is in the word and is in position 4 (E is the 4th letter).
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: E (position 4), R (somewhere else).
- Letters definitely not in the word: A, O, S, T, I, G.
- Positions to avoid for R: 2 and 5.
- Positions still open for R: 1, 3.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E in position 4.
2. Has R in position 1 or 3.
3. Does not contain A, O, S, T, I, G.
4. Uses only remaining common letters (e.g., B, C, D, F, H, L, N, P, U, Y, etc.).

Let’s list possible patterns:
- If R is in position 1: R _ _ E _
- If R is in position 3: _ _ R E _

Remaining letters to consider: B, C, D, F, H, L, N, P, U, Y, K, M, V, W, etc.

Let’s try R in position 1: R _ _ E _
We need 3 letters in positions 2 and 3 that are from the allowed set.
Common combinations: R U N E T (but T is out), R U N E D, R U N E L, R U N E Y, etc.
""rune_"" doesn’t fit 5 letters easily.

Try R in position 3: _ _ R E _
Possible: B R E E D (but E is already in 4), C R E E K (C and K are allowed), D R E E D, F R E E D, etc.

""creed"" comes to mind:
- C: allowed
- R: position 3 (allowed)
- E: position 4 (correct)
- E: already accounted for
- D: allowed

But ""creed"" has two E’s, which is acceptable since we know E is in position 4 and R is in position 3.

Let’s check if ""creed"" meets all criteria:
- Contains E in position 4 (✓)
- Contains R in position 3 (allowed, since R is not in positions 2 or 5)
- No A, O, S, T, I, G
- Uses C, D which are allowed

Thus, ""creed"" seems like a good next guess.

From the new feedback on ""creed"":
- C(x) D(x): C and D are not in the word.
- E(✓): E is in position 4 (confirmed again).
- R(-): R is in the word but not in positions 3 or 5.
- E(-): the E in position 2 is in the word but not in position 2.

So far we know:
- E is fixed at position 4.
- R is in the word but not in positions 2, 3, 5 → must be in position 1.
- The E that is not in position 2 must be in position 0 (invalid) or 1, 3. Since position 4 is taken by E, the other E must be in position 1 or 3. But position 4 is already E, so the word must have two E's, one at position 4 and another at 1 or 3.

But we have:
- R must be in position 1 (only remaining spot).
- So the word is R E _ E _ or R _ E E _.

But we also know:
- From guess 1: arose → R is in the word but not in position 2 (consistent with R in position 1).
- From guess 2: tiger → R is in the word but not in position 5 (consistent).
- From guess 3: creed → R is in the word but not in position 3 (consistent).

Thus, R must be in position 1, and there must be another E in position 3 (since position 2 is invalid for E, and position 4 is already E). So the pattern is R _ E E _.

Now we need to find a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with R.
2. Has E in position 3 and E in position 4.
3. Does not contain A, O, S, T, I, G, C, D.
4. Uses remaining allowed letters: B, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y.

Possible words:
- R _ E E _ → need a letter for position 2 and 5 from allowed set.
- R N E E D → D is invalid (from creed).
- R H E E N → ""rhene"" is not a valid word.
- R B E E N → ""rbenn"" is not valid.
- R M E E N → ""rmenn"" is not valid.
- R L E E N → ""rleen"" is not valid.
- R N E E K → ""rneek"" is not valid.
- R N E E P → ""rneep"" is not valid.
- R N E E V → ""rneev"" is not valid.
- R N E E Y → ""rneey"" is not valid.
- R B E E K → ""rbEEK"" is not valid.
- R H E E K → ""rhEEK"" is not valid.
- R M E E K → ""rmEEK"" is not valid.
- R P E E K → ""rpEEK"" is not valid.
- R F E E K → ""rfeek"" is not valid.
- R N E E K → already considered.

Wait, let me think of actual words:
- ""raven"" has A (invalid).
- ""reach"" has C (invalid).
- ""realm"" has C (invalid).
- ""rebel"" has B and E in position 3, but E is already in 4, and we need E in 3. So ""rebel"" is R E B E L → this fits the pattern R E B E L!

Check ""rebel"":
- R in position 1 (must be correct).
- E in position 2 (but from creed feedback, E is in the word but not in position 2). This is a conflict.

So ""rebel"" is invalid because E cannot be in position 2.

Next possible word: ""rhein"" (but I is invalid).
""rheum"" (u and m are allowed, but H is allowed, U is allowed, M is allowed). But this has H in position 2, E in 3, E in 4, M in 5, but ""rheum"" is R H E U M → U is allowed, but E is in 3 and 4, but we need E in 4 only, and the other E must be in 3. So ""rheum"" has only one E (position 3), but position 4 is E, so this is actually R H E U M → no, this has only one E in position 3, and position 4 is E from the feedback, but the word would need to have two E's. So ""rheum"" is invalid.

Wait, the feedback says:
- creed → C(x) R(-) E(-) E(✓) D(x)
This means:
- E is in position 4 (✓)
- The E in position 2 is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
Thus, the word must have exactly one E at position 4, and the E in position 2 in creed is actually indicating that there is another E in the word but not at position 2. This implies the word has two E's: one at position 4 and another at 1, 3, or 5 (but R is at 1, so 3 or 5).

But from guess 3, R is in the word but not in position 3 (already satisfied since R is at 1), and the E in position 2 is in the word but not at 2. Thus, the word must have another E at 3 or 5.

Thus possible patterns:
1. R _ E E _ (E at 3, 4)
2. R _ _ E E (E at 4, 5)

But from guess 1 arose → E is in the word but not at 5 (since E in arose is at 5 and feedback is (-) meaning E is in word but not at 5). Thus E cannot be at 5, so pattern 2 is invalid.

Thus only pattern is R _ E E _.

Now find valid words:
- R _ E E _ with allowed letters.
- Allowed letters: B, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y.

Possible:
- R N E E K → ""rneek"" not valid.
- R H E E N → ""rh een"" not valid.
- R B E E N → ""rb e e n"" not valid.
- R M E E N → ""rm e e n"" not valid.
- R L E E N → ""rleen"" not valid.
- R P E E K → ""rpeek"" not valid.
- R N E E P → ""rneep"" not valid.
- R V E E N → ""rveen"" not valid.
- R W E E N → ""rween"" not valid.
- R Y E E N → ""ryeen"" not valid.

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternative approach: perhaps the word has only one E at position 4, and the (-) in creed for the E at position 2 simply means that E is in the word but not at position 2 (but could be at 1, 3, 5). But since we know E is at 4, and from arose E is not at 5, and from creed E is not at 2, the only possible positions for the second E is 1 or 3.

But R must be at 1 (from previous deductions), so the second E must be at 3. Thus the word must be R _ E E _.

But no valid words fit this pattern with allowed letters. This suggests I may have made an error in interpreting the feedback.

Re-reading the feedback:
- Guess 1: arose → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
This means:
- A, O, S not in word.
- R is in word but not at 2.
- E is in word but not at 5.

- Guess 2: tiger → T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(-)
This means:
- T, I, G not in word.
- E is at position 4 (✓).
- R is in word but not at 5.

- Guess 3: creed → C(x) R(-) E(-) E(✓) D(x)
This means:
- C, D not in word.
- R is in word but not at 3.
- E is in word but not at 2 (the E at position 2 in creed is in word but not at 2).
- E is at position 4 (✓).

Thus:
- E is fixed at 4.
- R is in word but not at 2, 3, 5 → must be at 1.
- The E in position 2 in creed is in word but not at 2 → this implies there is another E in the word at 1, 3, or 5. But:
   - R is at 1, so E cannot be at 1.
   - From arose, E is not at 5.
   - Thus E must be at 3.

Thus the word must be R _ E E _.

But as before, no valid words fit R _ E E _ with allowed letters. This suggests either:
1. I'm missing a valid word.
2. There's an error in my deductions.

Upon reflection, the feedback from creed says the E at position 2 is in the word but not at 2. This does NOT necessarily mean there is another E in the word; it could mean that the E at position 2 is part of a larger E (like ""EE"" in ""REED""), but the feedback is indicating that the specific E at position 2 is in the word but not at 2. This is a bit ambiguous.

However, in Wordle-style games, typically each letter is considered independently. Thus:
- From creed: E at position 2 is in word but not at 2 → this implies there is an E in the word but not at 2.
- We already have E at 4, so this could simply mean that the E at position 2 in creed is a separate E (but this would require two E's).

Thus, the word must have two E's: one at 4 and one at 1, 3, or 5 (but R is at 1, so 3 or 5).

But from arose, E is not at 5, so the second E must be at 3. Thus R _ E E _.

But no valid words fit this. Thus, perhaps the word has only one E at 4, and the (-) in creed simply indicates that E is in word but not at 2 (but we already know it's at 4). This would mean the word has only one E at 4, and the previous interpretations may have overcounted.

Thus, re-evaluate:
- E is at 4 (only).
- R is at 1 (only).
- Thus word starts with R and has E at 4: R _ _ E _.
- R must be at 1 (since not at 2,3,5).
- Now find words R _ _ E _ with no A, O, S, T, I, G, C, D.

Possible letters for positions 2,3,5: B, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y.

Possible words:
- R N E E K → invalid (D from creed, but K is allowed, but word is R N E E K? This has E at 3,4, which would be two E's, but we're considering only one E at 4.
- R H E E N → invalid.
- R B E E N → invalid.
- R M E E N → invalid.
- R L E E N → invalid.
- R N E E P → invalid.
- R P E E K → invalid.
- R N E E V → invalid.
- R N E E Y → invalid.

This is problematic. Let me think of actual words starting with R and having E at 4:
- R E E D S → D and S invalid.
- R E E K S → S invalid.
- R E E N S → N and S invalid.
- R E E P S → S invalid.
- R E E V S → S invalid.
- R E E N Y → Y is allowed, but N is allowed: ""reeny"" is not valid.
- R E E M P → ""reemp"" is not valid.

Wait, perhaps the word is ""rue"" related, but must be 5 letters.

Actually, let me list all 5-letter words starting with R and having E at position 4, avoiding forbidden letters (A,O,S,T,I,G,C,D):

Forbidden letters: A, O, S, T, I, G, C, D.

Allowed letters: B, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, plus E (at 4), R (at 1).

Pattern: R _ _ E _

Possible combinations:
- R N E E K → K is allowed, but word is ""rneek"" which is invalid.
- R H E E N → ""rh een"" is invalid.
- R B E E N → invalid.
- R M E E N → invalid.
- R L E E N → invalid.
- R N E E P → invalid.
- R P E E K → invalid.
- R V E E N → invalid.
- R W E E N → invalid.
- R Y E E N → invalid.

This suggests no valid words fit, which is impossible. Thus, my earlier deduction that R must be at 1 is correct, but the word must have only one E at 4, and the (-) in creed simply indicates E is in word but not at 2 (but we already know it's at 4). Thus, the word is R _ _ E _ with no other E.

Thus, find R _ _ E _ with no A, O, S, T, I, G, C, D.

Possible words:
- R U N E Y → R U N E Y → valid word ""rune y"" but is ""rune y"" a word? ""rune"" is 4 letters.
- R U M E N → ""rumen"" is valid (but contains U, M, E, N).
- R U V E N → invalid.
- R U P E N → invalid.
- R U B E N → invalid.
- R U L E N → ""rulen"" is invalid.
- R U F E N → invalid.
- R H U E N → invalid.
- R N U E M → invalid.
- R N E U M → invalid.

Actually, let me think of valid words:
- R U N E Y → not valid.
- R U M E N → ""rumen"" is valid (but is it a common word?).
- R U L E D → D is invalid.
- R U L E S → S invalid.
- R U L E N → invalid.
- R U B E N → invalid.
- R U L E M → invalid.
- R U P E N → invalid.
- R U V E N → invalid.
- R U F E N → invalid.
- R U N E M → invalid.

This is tricky. Another approach: perhaps the word is ""ruble"" but E is at 4, so R U B L E → E is at 5, but from arose E is not at 5. Thus invalid.

Wait, let me list all valid 5-letter words starting with R and having E at position 4, avoiding forbidden letters:

Valid words:
- R U M E N → ""rumen"" (but is this a valid English word? Yes, it's a word meaning the part of the stomach in ruminants.)
- R U N E M → invalid.
- R U B E N → invalid.
- R U L E N → invalid.
- R U P E N → invalid.
- R U V E N → invalid.
- R U F E N → invalid.
- R H U E N → invalid.
- R N U E M → invalid.
- R N E U M → invalid.

Thus, the only plausible word seems to be ""rumen"", but I'm not certain it's in the allowed set. However, based on the constraints, this appears to be the only possible word.

But let me double-check:
- R U M E N:
   - R at 1 (required)
   - U at 2 (allowed)
   - M at 3 (allowed)
   - E at 4 (correct)
   - N at 5 (allowed)
   - No forbidden letters (A,O,S,T,I,G,C,D).

Thus, ""rumen"" seems valid.

<guess>rumen</guess>
</think>

Based on all the feedback and deductions:
- E is fixed at position 4.
- R is fixed at position 1 (since it cannot be at 2,3,5 and must appear).
- The remaining letters must be chosen from the allowed set to avoid disallowed letters (A, O, S, T, I, G, C, D).

The only valid word fitting these constraints is:

<guess>rumen</guess>",rumen,"From the new feedback on ""creed"":
- C(x) D(x): C and D are not in the word.
- E(✓): E is in position 4 (confirmed again).
- R(-): R is in the word but not in positions 3 or 5.
- E(-): the E in position 2 is in the word but not in position 2.

So far we know:
- E is fixed at position 4.
- R is in the word but not in positions 2, 3, 5 → must be in position 1.
- The E that is not in position 2 must be in position 0 (invalid) or 1, 3. Since position 4 is taken by E, the other E must be in position 1 or 3. But position 4 is already E, so the word must have two E's, one at position 4 and another at 1 or 3.

But we have:
- R must be in position 1 (only remaining spot).
- So the word is R E _ E _ or R _ E E _.

But we also know:
- From guess 1: arose → R is in the word but not in position 2 (consistent with R in position 1).
- From guess 2: tiger → R is in the word but not in position 5 (consistent).
- From guess 3: creed → R is in the word but not in position 3 (consistent).

Thus, R must be in position 1, and there must be another E in position 3 (since position 2 is invalid for E, and position 4 is already E). So the pattern is R _ E E _.

Now we need to find a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with R.
2. Has E in position 3 and E in position 4.
3. Does not contain A, O, S, T, I, G, C, D.
4. Uses remaining allowed letters: B, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y.

Possible words:
- R _ E E _ → need a letter for position 2 and 5 from allowed set.
- R N E E D → D is invalid (from creed).
- R H E E N → ""rhene"" is not a valid word.
- R B E E N → ""rbenn"" is not valid.
- R M E E N → ""rmenn"" is not valid.
- R L E E N → ""rleen"" is not valid.
- R N E E K → ""rneek"" is not valid.
- R N E E P → ""rneep"" is not valid.
- R N E E V → ""rneev"" is not valid.
- R N E E Y → ""rneey"" is not valid.
- R B E E K → ""rbEEK"" is not valid.
- R H E E K → ""rhEEK"" is not valid.
- R M E E K → ""rmEEK"" is not valid.
- R P E E K → ""rpEEK"" is not valid.
- R F E E K → ""rfeek"" is not valid.
- R N E E K → already considered.

Wait, let me think of actual words:
- ""raven"" has A (invalid).
- ""reach"" has C (invalid).
- ""realm"" has C (invalid).
- ""rebel"" has B and E in position 3, but E is already in 4, and we need E in 3. So ""rebel"" is R E B E L → this fits the pattern R E B E L!

Check ""rebel"":
- R in position 1 (must be correct).
- E in position 2 (but from creed feedback, E is in the word but not in position 2). This is a conflict.

So ""rebel"" is invalid because E cannot be in position 2.

Next possible word: ""rhein"" (but I is invalid).
""rheum"" (u and m are allowed, but H is allowed, U is allowed, M is allowed). But this has H in position 2, E in 3, E in 4, M in 5, but ""rheum"" is R H E U M → U is allowed, but E is in 3 and 4, but we need E in 4 only, and the other E must be in 3. So ""rheum"" has only one E (position 3), but position 4 is E, so this is actually R H E U M → no, this has only one E in position 3, and position 4 is E from the feedback, but the word would need to have two E's. So ""rheum"" is invalid.

Wait, the feedback says:
- creed → C(x) R(-) E(-) E(✓) D(x)
This means:
- E is in position 4 (✓)
- The E in position 2 is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
Thus, the word must have exactly one E at position 4, and the E in position 2 in creed is actually indicating that there is another E in the word but not at position 2. This implies the word has two E's: one at position 4 and another at 1, 3, or 5 (but R is at 1, so 3 or 5).

But from guess 3, R is in the word but not in position 3 (already satisfied since R is at 1), and the E in position 2 is in the word but not at 2. Thus, the word must have another E at 3 or 5.

Thus possible patterns:
1. R _ E E _ (E at 3, 4)
2. R _ _ E E (E at 4, 5)

But from guess 1 arose → E is in the word but not at 5 (since E in arose is at 5 and feedback is (-) meaning E is in word but not at 5). Thus E cannot be at 5, so pattern 2 is invalid.

Thus only pattern is R _ E E _.

Now find valid words:
- R _ E E _ with allowed letters.
- Allowed letters: B, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y.

Possible:
- R N E E K → ""rneek"" not valid.
- R H E E N → ""rh een"" not valid.
- R B E E N → ""rb e e n"" not valid.
- R M E E N → ""rm e e n"" not valid.
- R L E E N → ""rleen"" not valid.
- R P E E K → ""rpeek"" not valid.
- R N E E P → ""rneep"" not valid.
- R V E E N → ""rveen"" not valid.
- R W E E N → ""rween"" not valid.
- R Y E E N → ""ryeen"" not valid.

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternative approach: perhaps the word has only one E at position 4, and the (-) in creed for the E at position 2 simply means that E is in the word but not at position 2 (but could be at 1, 3, 5). But since we know E is at 4, and from arose E is not at 5, and from creed E is not at 2, the only possible positions for the second E is 1 or 3.

But R must be at 1 (from previous deductions), so the second E must be at 3. Thus the word must be R _ E E _.

But no valid words fit this pattern with allowed letters. This suggests I may have made an error in interpreting the feedback.

Re-reading the feedback:
- Guess 1: arose → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
This means:
- A, O, S not in word.
- R is in word but not at 2.
- E is in word but not at 5.

- Guess 2: tiger → T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(-)
This means:
- T, I, G not in word.
- E is at position 4 (✓).
- R is in word but not at 5.

- Guess 3: creed → C(x) R(-) E(-) E(✓) D(x)
This means:
- C, D not in word.
- R is in word but not at 3.
- E is in word but not at 2 (the E at position 2 in creed is in word but not at 2).
- E is at position 4 (✓).

Thus:
- E is fixed at 4.
- R is in word but not at 2, 3, 5 → must be at 1.
- The E in position 2 in creed is in word but not at 2 → this implies there is another E in the word at 1, 3, or 5. But:
   - R is at 1, so E cannot be at 1.
   - From arose, E is not at 5.
   - Thus E must be at 3.

Thus the word must be R _ E E _.

But as before, no valid words fit R _ E E _ with allowed letters. This suggests either:
1. I'm missing a valid word.
2. There's an error in my deductions.

Upon reflection, the feedback from creed says the E at position 2 is in the word but not at 2. This does NOT necessarily mean there is another E in the word; it could mean that the E at position 2 is part of a larger E (like ""EE"" in ""REED""), but the feedback is indicating that the specific E at position 2 is in the word but not at 2. This is a bit ambiguous.

However, in Wordle-style games, typically each letter is considered independently. Thus:
- From creed: E at position 2 is in word but not at 2 → this implies there is an E in the word but not at 2.
- We already have E at 4, so this could simply mean that the E at position 2 in creed is a separate E (but this would require two E's).

Thus, the word must have two E's: one at 4 and one at 1, 3, or 5 (but R is at 1, so 3 or 5).

But from arose, E is not at 5, so the second E must be at 3. Thus R _ E E _.

But no valid words fit this. Thus, perhaps the word has only one E at 4, and the (-) in creed simply indicates that E is in word but not at 2 (but we already know it's at 4). This would mean the word has only one E at 4, and the previous interpretations may have overcounted.

Thus, re-evaluate:
- E is at 4 (only).
- R is at 1 (only).
- Thus word starts with R and has E at 4: R _ _ E _.
- R must be at 1 (since not at 2,3,5).
- Now find words R _ _ E _ with no A, O, S, T, I, G, C, D.

Possible letters for positions 2,3,5: B, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y.

Possible words:
- R N E E K → invalid (D from creed, but K is allowed, but word is R N E E K? This has E at 3,4, which would be two E's, but we're considering only one E at 4.
- R H E E N → invalid.
- R B E E N → invalid.
- R M E E N → invalid.
- R L E E N → invalid.
- R N E E P → invalid.
- R P E E K → invalid.
- R N E E V → invalid.
- R N E E Y → invalid.

This is problematic. Let me think of actual words starting with R and having E at 4:
- R E E D S → D and S invalid.
- R E E K S → S invalid.
- R E E N S → N and S invalid.
- R E E P S → S invalid.
- R E E V S → S invalid.
- R E E N Y → Y is allowed, but N is allowed: ""reeny"" is not valid.
- R E E M P → ""reemp"" is not valid.

Wait, perhaps the word is ""rue"" related, but must be 5 letters.

Actually, let me list all 5-letter words starting with R and having E at position 4, avoiding forbidden letters (A,O,S,T,I,G,C,D):

Forbidden letters: A, O, S, T, I, G, C, D.

Allowed letters: B, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, plus E (at 4), R (at 1).

Pattern: R _ _ E _

Possible combinations:
- R N E E K → K is allowed, but word is ""rneek"" which is invalid.
- R H E E N → ""rh een"" is invalid.
- R B E E N → invalid.
- R M E E N → invalid.
- R L E E N → invalid.
- R N E E P → invalid.
- R P E E K → invalid.
- R V E E N → invalid.
- R W E E N → invalid.
- R Y E E N → invalid.

This suggests no valid words fit, which is impossible. Thus, my earlier deduction that R must be at 1 is correct, but the word must have only one E at 4, and the (-) in creed simply indicates E is in word but not at 2 (but we already know it's at 4). Thus, the word is R _ _ E _ with no other E.

Thus, find R _ _ E _ with no A, O, S, T, I, G, C, D.

Possible words:
- R U N E Y → R U N E Y → valid word ""rune y"" but is ""rune y"" a word? ""rune"" is 4 letters.
- R U M E N → ""rumen"" is valid (but contains U, M, E, N).
- R U V E N → invalid.
- R U P E N → invalid.
- R U B E N → invalid.
- R U L E N → ""rulen"" is invalid.
- R U F E N → invalid.
- R H U E N → invalid.
- R N U E M → invalid.
- R N E U M → invalid.

Actually, let me think of valid words:
- R U N E Y → not valid.
- R U M E N → ""rumen"" is valid (but is it a common word?).
- R U L E D → D is invalid.
- R U L E S → S invalid.
- R U L E N → invalid.
- R U B E N → invalid.
- R U L E M → invalid.
- R U P E N → invalid.
- R U V E N → invalid.
- R U F E N → invalid.
- R U N E M → invalid.

This is tricky. Another approach: perhaps the word is ""ruble"" but E is at 4, so R U B L E → E is at 5, but from arose E is not at 5. Thus invalid.

Wait, let me list all valid 5-letter words starting with R and having E at position 4, avoiding forbidden letters:

Valid words:
- R U M E N → ""rumen"" (but is this a valid English word? Yes, it's a word meaning the part of the stomach in ruminants.)
- R U N E M → invalid.
- R U B E N → invalid.
- R U L E N → invalid.
- R U P E N → invalid.
- R U V E N → invalid.
- R U F E N → invalid.
- R H U E N → invalid.
- R N U E M → invalid.
- R N E U M → invalid.

Thus, the only plausible word seems to be ""rumen"", but I'm not certain it's in the allowed set. However, based on the constraints, this appears to be the only possible word.

But let me double-check:
- R U M E N:
   - R at 1 (required)
   - U at 2 (allowed)
   - M at 3 (allowed)
   - E at 4 (correct)
   - N at 5 (allowed)
   - No forbidden letters (A,O,S,T,I,G,C,D).

Thus, ""rumen"" seems valid.

<guess>rumen</guess>Based on all the feedback and deductions:
- E is fixed at position 4.
- R is fixed at position 1 (since it cannot be at 2,3,5 and must appear).
- The remaining letters must be chosen from the allowed set to avoid disallowed letters (A, O, S, T, I, G, C, D).

The only valid word fitting these constraints is:",Guess 4: rumen -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) U(x) M(x) E(✓) N(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. Among these, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- 3 very common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- This combination gives good coverage to potentially reveal multiple letters in the secret word.

I'll go with AROSE as my first guess to gather maximum information about the letters present in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word, but not in position 2 (-)
- O: not in the word (x)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word, but not in position 5 (-)

So far we know:
- Letters definitely absent: A, O, S
- Letters present somewhere: R, E
- R is not in position 2, E is not in position 5

I want a new word that:
1. Contains R and E (since they are in the word)
2. Does NOT contain A, O, S
3. Uses common letters to maximize information
4. Places R and E in new positions to test their correct spots

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out, and E is already confirmed)

Let me try ""TREND"":
- T: new letter
- R: in position 2 (but we know R is not in position 2 from arose feedback, so this will confirm or deny R's position)
- E: in position 3 (new position)
- N: new letter
- D: new letter

But wait, from arose, R is in the word but not in position 2, so placing R in position 2 in ""trend"" would be redundant. Let me rethink.

Better to place R and E in new positions. Let's try ""ENTRY"":
- E: position 1 (new position)
- N: new letter
T: new letter
R: position 4 (new position)
Y: new letter

But this might not use common letters effectively. Another option is ""TIMER"":
- T: new letter
I: new vowel
M: new letter
E: position 4 (new position)
R: position 5 (new position)

This seems good because:
- Uses T, I, M which are common
- Places E in position 4 and R in position 5 to test their correct spots
- Doesn't use any confirmed absent letters (A, O, S)Based on the feedback from ""arose"", I know:
- R and E are in the word, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.
- A, O, and S are not in the word.

I need a new word that contains R and E but avoids A, O, S, and places R and E in different positions to narrow down their correct spots.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tiger -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on ""tiger"":
- T(x) I(x) G(x): T, I, G are not in the word.
- E(✓): E is in the word and is in position 4 (E is the 4th letter).
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: E (position 4), R (somewhere else).
- Letters definitely not in the word: A, O, S, T, I, G.
- Positions to avoid for R: 2 and 5.
- Positions still open for R: 1, 3.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E in position 4.
2. Has R in position 1 or 3.
3. Does not contain A, O, S, T, I, G.
4. Uses only remaining common letters (e.g., B, C, D, F, H, L, N, P, U, Y, etc.).

Let’s list possible patterns:
- If R is in position 1: R _ _ E _
- If R is in position 3: _ _ R E _

Remaining letters to consider: B, C, D, F, H, L, N, P, U, Y, K, M, V, W, etc.

Let’s try R in position 1: R _ _ E _
We need 3 letters in positions 2 and 3 that are from the allowed set.
Common combinations: R U N E T (but T is out), R U N E D, R U N E L, R U N E Y, etc.
""rune_"" doesn’t fit 5 letters easily.

Try R in position 3: _ _ R E _
Possible: B R E E D (but E is already in 4), C R E E K (C and K are allowed), D R E E D, F R E E D, etc.

""creed"" comes to mind:
- C: allowed
- R: position 3 (allowed)
- E: position 4 (correct)
- E: already accounted for
- D: allowed

But ""creed"" has two E’s, which is acceptable since we know E is in position 4 and R is in position 3.

Let’s check if ""creed"" meets all criteria:
- Contains E in position 4 (✓)
- Contains R in position 3 (allowed, since R is not in positions 2 or 5)
- No A, O, S, T, I, G
- Uses C, D which are allowed

Thus, ""creed"" seems like a good next guess.

<guess>creed</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tiger -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(-)
Guess 3: creed -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) E(-) E(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on ""creed"":
- C(x) D(x): C and D are not in the word.
- E(✓): E is in position 4 (confirmed again).
- R(-): R is in the word but not in positions 3 or 5.
- E(-): the E in position 2 is in the word but not in position 2.

So far we know:
- E is fixed at position 4.
- R is in the word but not in positions 2, 3, 5 → must be in position 1.
- The E that is not in position 2 must be in position 0 (invalid) or 1, 3. Since position 4 is taken by E, the other E must be in position 1 or 3. But position 4 is already E, so the word must have two E's, one at position 4 and another at 1 or 3.

But we have:
- R must be in position 1 (only remaining spot).
- So the word is R E _ E _ or R _ E E _.

But we also know:
- From guess 1: arose → R is in the word but not in position 2 (consistent with R in position 1).
- From guess 2: tiger → R is in the word but not in position 5 (consistent).
- From guess 3: creed → R is in the word but not in position 3 (consistent).

Thus, R must be in position 1, and there must be another E in position 3 (since position 2 is invalid for E, and position 4 is already E). So the pattern is R _ E E _.

Now we need to find a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with R.
2. Has E in position 3 and E in position 4.
3. Does not contain A, O, S, T, I, G, C, D.
4. Uses remaining allowed letters: B, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y.

Possible words:
- R _ E E _ → need a letter for position 2 and 5 from allowed set.
- R N E E D → D is invalid (from creed).
- R H E E N → ""rhene"" is not a valid word.
- R B E E N → ""rbenn"" is not valid.
- R M E E N → ""rmenn"" is not valid.
- R L E E N → ""rleen"" is not valid.
- R N E E K → ""rneek"" is not valid.
- R N E E P → ""rneep"" is not valid.
- R N E E V → ""rneev"" is not valid.
- R N E E Y → ""rneey"" is not valid.
- R B E E K → ""rbEEK"" is not valid.
- R H E E K → ""rhEEK"" is not valid.
- R M E E K → ""rmEEK"" is not valid.
- R P E E K → ""rpEEK"" is not valid.
- R F E E K → ""rfeek"" is not valid.
- R N E E K → already considered.

Wait, let me think of actual words:
- ""raven"" has A (invalid).
- ""reach"" has C (invalid).
- ""realm"" has C (invalid).
- ""rebel"" has B and E in position 3, but E is already in 4, and we need E in 3. So ""rebel"" is R E B E L → this fits the pattern R E B E L!

Check ""rebel"":
- R in position 1 (must be correct).
- E in position 2 (but from creed feedback, E is in the word but not in position 2). This is a conflict.

So ""rebel"" is invalid because E cannot be in position 2.

Next possible word: ""rhein"" (but I is invalid).
""rheum"" (u and m are allowed, but H is allowed, U is allowed, M is allowed). But this has H in position 2, E in 3, E in 4, M in 5, but ""rheum"" is R H E U M → U is allowed, but E is in 3 and 4, but we need E in 4 only, and the other E must be in 3. So ""rheum"" has only one E (position 3), but position 4 is E, so this is actually R H E U M → no, this has only one E in position 3, and position 4 is E from the feedback, but the word would need to have two E's. So ""rheum"" is invalid.

Wait, the feedback says:
- creed → C(x) R(-) E(-) E(✓) D(x)
This means:
- E is in position 4 (✓)
- The E in position 2 is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
Thus, the word must have exactly one E at position 4, and the E in position 2 in creed is actually indicating that there is another E in the word but not at position 2. This implies the word has two E's: one at position 4 and another at 1, 3, or 5 (but R is at 1, so 3 or 5).

But from guess 3, R is in the word but not in position 3 (already satisfied since R is at 1), and the E in position 2 is in the word but not at 2. Thus, the word must have another E at 3 or 5.

Thus possible patterns:
1. R _ E E _ (E at 3, 4)
2. R _ _ E E (E at 4, 5)

But from guess 1 arose → E is in the word but not at 5 (since E in arose is at 5 and feedback is (-) meaning E is in word but not at 5). Thus E cannot be at 5, so pattern 2 is invalid.

Thus only pattern is R _ E E _.

Now find valid words:
- R _ E E _ with allowed letters.
- Allowed letters: B, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y.

Possible:
- R N E E K → ""rneek"" not valid.
- R H E E N → ""rh een"" not valid.
- R B E E N → ""rb e e n"" not valid.
- R M E E N → ""rm e e n"" not valid.
- R L E E N → ""rleen"" not valid.
- R P E E K → ""rpeek"" not valid.
- R N E E P → ""rneep"" not valid.
- R V E E N → ""rveen"" not valid.
- R W E E N → ""rween"" not valid.
- R Y E E N → ""ryeen"" not valid.

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternative approach: perhaps the word has only one E at position 4, and the (-) in creed for the E at position 2 simply means that E is in the word but not at position 2 (but could be at 1, 3, 5). But since we know E is at 4, and from arose E is not at 5, and from creed E is not at 2, the only possible positions for the second E is 1 or 3.

But R must be at 1 (from previous deductions), so the second E must be at 3. Thus the word must be R _ E E _.

But no valid words fit this pattern with allowed letters. This suggests I may have made an error in interpreting the feedback.

Re-reading the feedback:
- Guess 1: arose → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
This means:
- A, O, S not in word.
- R is in word but not at 2.
- E is in word but not at 5.

- Guess 2: tiger → T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(-)
This means:
- T, I, G not in word.
- E is at position 4 (✓).
- R is in word but not at 5.

- Guess 3: creed → C(x) R(-) E(-) E(✓) D(x)
This means:
- C, D not in word.
- R is in word but not at 3.
- E is in word but not at 2 (the E at position 2 in creed is in word but not at 2).
- E is at position 4 (✓).

Thus:
- E is fixed at 4.
- R is in word but not at 2, 3, 5 → must be at 1.
- The E in position 2 in creed is in word but not at 2 → this implies there is another E in the word at 1, 3, or 5. But:
   - R is at 1, so E cannot be at 1.
   - From arose, E is not at 5.
   - Thus E must be at 3.

Thus the word must be R _ E E _.

But as before, no valid words fit R _ E E _ with allowed letters. This suggests either:
1. I'm missing a valid word.
2. There's an error in my deductions.

Upon reflection, the feedback from creed says the E at position 2 is in the word but not at 2. This does NOT necessarily mean there is another E in the word; it could mean that the E at position 2 is part of a larger E (like ""EE"" in ""REED""), but the feedback is indicating that the specific E at position 2 is in the word but not at 2. This is a bit ambiguous.

However, in Wordle-style games, typically each letter is considered independently. Thus:
- From creed: E at position 2 is in word but not at 2 → this implies there is an E in the word but not at 2.
- We already have E at 4, so this could simply mean that the E at position 2 in creed is a separate E (but this would require two E's).

Thus, the word must have two E's: one at 4 and one at 1, 3, or 5 (but R is at 1, so 3 or 5).

But from arose, E is not at 5, so the second E must be at 3. Thus R _ E E _.

But no valid words fit this. Thus, perhaps the word has only one E at 4, and the (-) in creed simply indicates that E is in word but not at 2 (but we already know it's at 4). This would mean the word has only one E at 4, and the previous interpretations may have overcounted.

Thus, re-evaluate:
- E is at 4 (only).
- R is at 1 (only).
- Thus word starts with R and has E at 4: R _ _ E _.
- R must be at 1 (since not at 2,3,5).
- Now find words R _ _ E _ with no A, O, S, T, I, G, C, D.

Possible letters for positions 2,3,5: B, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y.

Possible words:
- R N E E K → invalid (D from creed, but K is allowed, but word is R N E E K? This has E at 3,4, which would be two E's, but we're considering only one E at 4.
- R H E E N → invalid.
- R B E E N → invalid.
- R M E E N → invalid.
- R L E E N → invalid.
- R N E E P → invalid.
- R P E E K → invalid.
- R N E E V → invalid.
- R N E E Y → invalid.

This is problematic. Let me think of actual words starting with R and having E at 4:
- R E E D S → D and S invalid.
- R E E K S → S invalid.
- R E E N S → N and S invalid.
- R E E P S → S invalid.
- R E E V S → S invalid.
- R E E N Y → Y is allowed, but N is allowed: ""reeny"" is not valid.
- R E E M P → ""reemp"" is not valid.

Wait, perhaps the word is ""rue"" related, but must be 5 letters.

Actually, let me list all 5-letter words starting with R and having E at position 4, avoiding forbidden letters (A,O,S,T,I,G,C,D):

Forbidden letters: A, O, S, T, I, G, C, D.

Allowed letters: B, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, plus E (at 4), R (at 1).

Pattern: R _ _ E _

Possible combinations:
- R N E E K → K is allowed, but word is ""rneek"" which is invalid.
- R H E E N → ""rh een"" is invalid.
- R B E E N → invalid.
- R M E E N → invalid.
- R L E E N → invalid.
- R N E E P → invalid.
- R P E E K → invalid.
- R V E E N → invalid.
- R W E E N → invalid.
- R Y E E N → invalid.

This suggests no valid words fit, which is impossible. Thus, my earlier deduction that R must be at 1 is correct, but the word must have only one E at 4, and the (-) in creed simply indicates E is in word but not at 2 (but we already know it's at 4). Thus, the word is R _ _ E _ with no other E.

Thus, find R _ _ E _ with no A, O, S, T, I, G, C, D.

Possible words:
- R U N E Y → R U N E Y → valid word ""rune y"" but is ""rune y"" a word? ""rune"" is 4 letters.
- R U M E N → ""rumen"" is valid (but contains U, M, E, N).
- R U V E N → invalid.
- R U P E N → invalid.
- R U B E N → invalid.
- R U L E N → ""rulen"" is invalid.
- R U F E N → invalid.
- R H U E N → invalid.
- R N U E M → invalid.
- R N E U M → invalid.

Actually, let me think of valid words:
- R U N E Y → not valid.
- R U M E N → ""rumen"" is valid (but is it a common word?).
- R U L E D → D is invalid.
- R U L E S → S invalid.
- R U L E N → invalid.
- R U B E N → invalid.
- R U L E M → invalid.
- R U P E N → invalid.
- R U V E N → invalid.
- R U F E N → invalid.
- R U N E M → invalid.

This is tricky. Another approach: perhaps the word is ""ruble"" but E is at 4, so R U B L E → E is at 5, but from arose E is not at 5. Thus invalid.

Wait, let me list all valid 5-letter words starting with R and having E at position 4, avoiding forbidden letters:

Valid words:
- R U M E N → ""rumen"" (but is this a valid English word? Yes, it's a word meaning the part of the stomach in ruminants.)
- R U N E M → invalid.
- R U B E N → invalid.
- R U L E N → invalid.
- R U P E N → invalid.
- R U V E N → invalid.
- R U F E N → invalid.
- R H U E N → invalid.
- R N U E M → invalid.
- R N E U M → invalid.

Thus, the only plausible word seems to be ""rumen"", but I'm not certain it's in the allowed set. However, based on the constraints, this appears to be the only possible word.

But let me double-check:
- R U M E N:
   - R at 1 (required)
   - U at 2 (allowed)
   - M at 3 (allowed)
   - E at 4 (correct)
   - N at 5 (allowed)
   - No forbidden letters (A,O,S,T,I,G,C,D).

Thus, ""rumen"" seems valid.

<guess>rumen</guess>Based on all the feedback and deductions:
- E is fixed at position 4.
- R is fixed at position 1 (since it cannot be at 2,3,5 and must appear).
- The remaining letters must be chosen from the allowed set to avoid disallowed letters (A, O, S, T, I, G, C, D).

The only valid word fitting these constraints is:

""rune"" is 4 letters.\n- R U M E N → ""rumen"" is valid (but contains U, M, E, N).\n- R U V E N → invalid.\n- R U P E N → invalid.\n- R U B E N → invalid.\n- R U L E N → ""rulen"" is invalid.\n- R U F E N → invalid.\n- R H U E N → invalid.\n- R N U E M → invalid.\n- R N E U M → invalid.\n\nActually, let me think of valid words:\n- R U N E Y → not valid.\n- R U M E N → ""rumen"" is valid (but is it a common word?).\n- R U L E D → D is invalid.\n- R U L E S → S invalid.\n- R U L E N → invalid.\n- R U B E N → invalid.\n- R U L E M → invalid.\n- R U P E N → invalid.\n- R U V E N → invalid.\n- R U F E N → invalid.\n- R U N E M → invalid.\n\nThis is tricky. Another approach: perhaps the word is ""ruble"" but E is at 4, so R U B L E → E is at 5, but from arose E is not at 5. Thus invalid.\n\nWait, let me list all valid 5-letter words starting with R and having E at position 4, avoiding forbidden letters:\n\nValid words:\n- R U M E N → ""rumen"" (but is this a valid English word? Yes, it\'s a word meaning the part of the stomach in ruminants.)\n- R U N E M → invalid.\n- R U B E N → invalid.\n- R U L E N → invalid.\n- R U P E N → invalid.\n- R U V E N → invalid.\n- R U F E N → invalid.\n- R H U E N → invalid.\n- R N U E M → invalid.\n- R N E U M → invalid.\n\nThus, the only plausible word seems to be ""rumen"", but I\'m not certain it\'s in the allowed set. However, based on the constraints, this appears to be the only possible word.\n\nBut let me double-check:\n- R U M E N:\n   - R at 1 (required)\n   - U at 2 (allowed)\n   - M at 3 (allowed)\n   - E at 4 (correct)\n   - N at 5 (allowed)\n   - No forbidden letters (A,O,S,T,I,G,C,D).\n\nThus, ""rumen"" seems valid.\n\n<guess>rumen</guess>Based on all the feedback and deductions:\n- E is fixed at position 4.\n- R is fixed at position 1 (since it cannot be at 2,3,5 and must appear).\n- The remaining letters must be chosen from the allowed set to avoid disallowed letters (A, O, S, T, I, G, C, D).\n\nThe only valid word fitting these constraints is:\n\n<guess>rumen</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tiger -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(-)\nGuess 3: creed -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) E(-) E(✓) D(x)\nGuess 4: rumen -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) U(x) M(x) E(✓) N(x)\n'}]","<think>
From the latest feedback on ""rumen"":
- R(✓): R is in position 1.
- U(x): U is not in the word.
- M(x): M is not in the word.
- E(✓): E is in position 4.
- N(x): N is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters fixed: R _ _ E _
- Letters definitely absent: A, O, S, T, I, G, C, D, U, M, N
- Remaining possible letters (from the alphabet minus the absent ones): B, F, H, K, L, P, V, W, Y

We need to fill positions 2 and 3 and 5 with these remaining letters, ensuring we don't repeat any letters unnecessarily (though repetition isn't ruled out).

Possible patterns: R _ _ E _

Let's list valid 5-letter words starting with R and ending with E, with the middle letters chosen from B, F, H, K, L, P, V, W, Y.

Possible candidates:
- R B L E Y
- R B F E Y
- R H L E Y
- R H F E Y
- R P L E Y
- R P F E Y
- R V L E Y
- R V F E Y
- R W L E Y
- R W F E Y
- R Y L E Y
- R Y F E Y

Checking which of these are valid English words:
- R B L E Y → ""rbley"" - invalid
- R B F E Y → ""rbfe y"" - invalid
- R H L E Y → ""rhley"" - invalid
- R H F E Y → ""rhfe y"" - invalid
- R P L E Y → ""rplay"" - invalid
- R P F E Y → ""rpfe y"" - invalid
- R V L E Y → ""rvley"" - invalid
- R V F E Y → ""rvfe y"" - invalid
- R W L E Y → ""rwley"" - invalid
- R W F E Y → ""rwfe y"" - invalid
- R Y L E Y → ""ryley"" - invalid
- R Y F E Y → ""ryfe y"" - invalid

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Let me reconsider - perhaps the word doesn't need to end with E in position 5, just have E in position 4. So the pattern is R _ _ E _ with the last letter being any allowed letter except the absent ones.

Valid English words fitting R _ _ E _ with letters from B, F, H, K, L, P, V, W, Y in positions 2,3,5:

- R E E D S - but D and S are invalid
- R E E K S - S invalid
- R E E N S - N invalid
- R E E P S - S invalid
- R E E V S - S invalid
- R E E M P - M invalid
- R E E L Y - E is already used in position 4, but we can have two E's
   - R E E L Y → but L and Y are allowed
   - However, this would have E in positions 2 and 4, but from feedback E is only confirmed at 4
   - Also, ""reely"" is a valid word (though rare)

But let's think of more common words:
- R E E L Y - ""reely"" (valid)
- R E E K Y - K and Y allowed, ""reek y"" - invalid
- R E E L K - invalid
- R E E L B - invalid
- R E E L F - invalid
- R E E L V - invalid
- R E E L W - invalid
- R E E L P - invalid
- R E E L H - invalid
- R E E L Y - ""reely"" (valid)

Another approach: perhaps the word has no additional E's beyond position 4, so R _ _ E _ with no second E.

Valid words:
- R B L E Y - invalid
- R B F E Y - invalid
- R H L E Y - invalid
- R H F E Y - invalid
- R P L E Y - invalid
- R P F E Y - invalid
- R V L E Y - invalid
- R V F E Y - invalid
- R W L E Y - invalid
- R W F E Y - invalid
- R Y L E Y - invalid
- R Y F E Y - invalid

This is also not yielding valid words. Let me try a different set of middle letters, perhaps including E in position 3:

Pattern: R _ E E _ - but from feedback E is only confirmed at 4, and we don't know about a second E
- R B E E K - K allowed, but ""rbEEK"" invalid
- R H E E K - invalid
- R P E E K - invalid
- R V E E K - invalid
- R W E E K - invalid
- R Y E E K - invalid

This isn't working. Let me try simpler combinations:

- R B E L Y - ""rbel y"" invalid
- R F E L Y - ""rfe ly"" invalid
- R H E L Y - ""rhely"" invalid
- R K E L Y - ""rke ly"" invalid
- R L E B Y - invalid
- R L E F Y - invalid
- R L E H Y - invalid
- R L E K Y - invalid
- R L E P Y - invalid
- R L E V Y - invalid
- R L E W Y - invalid
- R L E Y B - invalid

I'm realizing I need to think of actual words, not just letter combinations. Let me list real 5-letter words starting with R and having E in position 4, with the other letters from the allowed set:

Allowed letters for positions 2,3,5: B, F, H, K, L, P, V, W, Y

Valid words:
- R E E D S - D and S invalid
- R E E K S - S invalid
- R E E N S - N invalid
- R E E P S - S invalid
- R E E V S - S invalid
- R E E M P - M invalid
- R E E L Y - ""reely"" (valid, though rare)
- R E E L K - invalid
- R E E L B - invalid
- R E E L F - invalid
- R E E L V - invalid
- R E E L W - invalid
- R E E L P - invalid
- R E E L Y - ""reely""

Another word: ""reek y"" - invalid
""reedy"" - D invalid
""rebel"" - B and L allowed, but E in position 2 conflicts with feedback (E is in word but not at 2 from creed)
But ""rebel"" has E at 2 which is invalid.

Wait, the feedback from creed says E is in the word but not at 2, so we cannot have E at 2. Thus, no second E in position 2.

Thus, possible words:
- R B L E Y - invalid
- R B F E Y - invalid
- R H L E Y - invalid
- R H F E Y - invalid
- R P L E Y - invalid
- R P F E Y - invalid
- R V L E Y - invalid
- R V F E Y - invalid
- R W L E Y - invalid
- R W F E Y - invalid
- R Y L E Y - invalid
- R Y F E Y - invalid

This is perplexing. Let me try a different pattern: R _ _ E _ with no second E, and letters from B, F, H, K, L, P, V, W, Y.

Valid words:
- R B L E Y - invalid
- R B F E Y - invalid
- R H L E Y - invalid

- R K F E Y - invalid
- R P L E Y - invalid

- R V L E Y - invalid
- R V F E Y - invalid
- R W L E Y - invalid
- R W F E Y - invalid
- R Y L E Y - invalid
- R Y F E Y - invalid

I'm realizing I'm not finding valid words. Let me try simpler combinations:

- R E E L Y - ""reely"" (valid, though rare)
- R E E L K - invalid
- R E E L B - invalid
- R E E L F - invalid
- R E E L V - invalid
- R E E L W - invalid
- R E E L P - invalid
- R E E L Y - ""reely""

This seems to be the only valid word fitting the pattern. Even though it's rare, it's the only candidate.

Thus, the next guess is ""reely"".
</think>

Based on all the feedback, the word must start with R, have E in the 4th position, and cannot contain any of the eliminated letters. The only valid English word fitting these constraints is:

<guess>reely</guess>",reely,"From the latest feedback on ""rumen"":

We need to fill positions 2 and 3 and 5 with these remaining letters, ensuring we don't repeat any letters unnecessarily (though repetition isn't ruled out).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. Among these, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- 3 very common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- This combination gives good coverage to potentially reveal multiple letters in the secret word.

I'll go with AROSE as my first guess to gather maximum information about the letters present in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word, but not in position 2 (-)
- O: not in the word (x)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word, but not in position 5 (-)

So far we know:
- Letters definitely absent: A, O, S
- Letters present somewhere: R, E
- R is not in position 2, E is not in position 5

I want a new word that:
1. Contains R and E (since they are in the word)
2. Does NOT contain A, O, S
3. Uses common letters to maximize information
4. Places R and E in new positions to test their correct spots

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out, and E is already confirmed)

Let me try ""TREND"":
- T: new letter
- R: in position 2 (but we know R is not in position 2 from arose feedback, so this will confirm or deny R's position)
- E: in position 3 (new position)
- N: new letter
- D: new letter

But wait, from arose, R is in the word but not in position 2, so placing R in position 2 in ""trend"" would be redundant. Let me rethink.

Better to place R and E in new positions. Let's try ""ENTRY"":
- E: position 1 (new position)
- N: new letter
T: new letter
R: position 4 (new position)
Y: new letter

But this might not use common letters effectively. Another option is ""TIMER"":
- T: new letter
I: new vowel
M: new letter
E: position 4 (new position)
R: position 5 (new position)

This seems good because:
- Uses T, I, M which are common
- Places E in position 4 and R in position 5 to test their correct spots
- Doesn't use any confirmed absent letters (A, O, S)Based on the feedback from ""arose"", I know:
- R and E are in the word, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.
- A, O, and S are not in the word.

I need a new word that contains R and E but avoids A, O, S, and places R and E in different positions to narrow down their correct spots.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: tiger -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on ""tiger"":
- T(x) I(x) G(x): T, I, G are not in the word.
- E(✓): E is in the word and is in position 4 (E is the 4th letter).
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: E (position 4), R (somewhere else).
- Letters definitely not in the word: A, O, S, T, I, G.
- Positions to avoid for R: 2 and 5.
- Positions still open for R: 1, 3.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E in position 4.
2. Has R in position 1 or 3.
3. Does not contain A, O, S, T, I, G.
4. Uses only remaining common letters (e.g., B, C, D, F, H, L, N, P, U, Y, etc.).

Let’s list possible patterns:
- If R is in position 1: R _ _ E _
- If R is in position 3: _ _ R E _

Remaining letters to consider: B, C, D, F, H, L, N, P, U, Y, K, M, V, W, etc.

Let’s try R in position 1: R _ _ E _
We need 3 letters in positions 2 and 3 that are from the allowed set.
Common combinations: R U N E T (but T is out), R U N E D, R U N E L, R U N E Y, etc.
""rune_"" doesn’t fit 5 letters easily.

Try R in position 3: _ _ R E _
Possible: B R E E D (but E is already in 4), C R E E K (C and K are allowed), D R E E D, F R E E D, etc.

""creed"" comes to mind:
- C: allowed
- R: position 3 (allowed)
- E: position 4 (correct)
- E: already accounted for
- D: allowed

But ""creed"" has two E’s, which is acceptable since we know E is in position 4 and R is in position 3.

Let’s check if ""creed"" meets all criteria:
- Contains E in position 4 (✓)
- Contains R in position 3 (allowed, since R is not in positions 2 or 5)
- No A, O, S, T, I, G
- Uses C, D which are allowed

Thus, ""creed"" seems like a good next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tiger -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(-)
Guess 3: creed -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) E(-) E(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on ""creed"":
- C(x) D(x): C and D are not in the word.
- E(✓): E is in position 4 (confirmed again).
- R(-): R is in the word but not in positions 3 or 5.
- E(-): the E in position 2 is in the word but not in position 2.

So far we know:
- E is fixed at position 4.
- R is in the word but not in positions 2, 3, 5 → must be in position 1.
- The E that is not in position 2 must be in position 0 (invalid) or 1, 3. Since position 4 is taken by E, the other E must be in position 1 or 3. But position 4 is already E, so the word must have two E's, one at position 4 and another at 1 or 3.

But we have:
- R must be in position 1 (only remaining spot).
- So the word is R E _ E _ or R _ E E _.

But we also know:
- From guess 1: arose → R is in the word but not in position 2 (consistent with R in position 1).
- From guess 2: tiger → R is in the word but not in position 5 (consistent).
- From guess 3: creed → R is in the word but not in position 3 (consistent).

Thus, R must be in position 1, and there must be another E in position 3 (since position 2 is invalid for E, and position 4 is already E). So the pattern is R _ E E _.

Now we need to find a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with R.
2. Has E in position 3 and E in position 4.
3. Does not contain A, O, S, T, I, G, C, D.
4. Uses remaining allowed letters: B, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y.

Possible words:
- R _ E E _ → need a letter for position 2 and 5 from allowed set.
- R N E E D → D is invalid (from creed).
- R H E E N → ""rhene"" is not a valid word.
- R B E E N → ""rbenn"" is not valid.
- R M E E N → ""rmenn"" is not valid.
- R L E E N → ""rleen"" is not valid.
- R N E E K → ""rneek"" is not valid.
- R N E E P → ""rneep"" is not valid.
- R N E E V → ""rneev"" is not valid.
- R N E E Y → ""rneey"" is not valid.
- R B E E K → ""rbEEK"" is not valid.
- R H E E K → ""rhEEK"" is not valid.
- R M E E K → ""rmEEK"" is not valid.
- R P E E K → ""rpEEK"" is not valid.
- R F E E K → ""rfeek"" is not valid.
- R N E E K → already considered.

Wait, let me think of actual words:
- ""raven"" has A (invalid).
- ""reach"" has C (invalid).
- ""realm"" has C (invalid).
- ""rebel"" has B and E in position 3, but E is already in 4, and we need E in 3. So ""rebel"" is R E B E L → this fits the pattern R E B E L!

Check ""rebel"":
- R in position 1 (must be correct).
- E in position 2 (but from creed feedback, E is in the word but not in position 2). This is a conflict.

So ""rebel"" is invalid because E cannot be in position 2.

Next possible word: ""rhein"" (but I is invalid).
""rheum"" (u and m are allowed, but H is allowed, U is allowed, M is allowed). But this has H in position 2, E in 3, E in 4, M in 5, but ""rheum"" is R H E U M → U is allowed, but E is in 3 and 4, but we need E in 4 only, and the other E must be in 3. So ""rheum"" has only one E (position 3), but position 4 is E, so this is actually R H E U M → no, this has only one E in position 3, and position 4 is E from the feedback, but the word would need to have two E's. So ""rheum"" is invalid.

Wait, the feedback says:
- creed → C(x) R(-) E(-) E(✓) D(x)
This means:
- E is in position 4 (✓)
- The E in position 2 is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
Thus, the word must have exactly one E at position 4, and the E in position 2 in creed is actually indicating that there is another E in the word but not at position 2. This implies the word has two E's: one at position 4 and another at 1, 3, or 5 (but R is at 1, so 3 or 5).

But from guess 3, R is in the word but not in position 3 (already satisfied since R is at 1), and the E in position 2 is in the word but not at 2. Thus, the word must have another E at 3 or 5.

Thus possible patterns:
1. R _ E E _ (E at 3, 4)
2. R _ _ E E (E at 4, 5)

But from guess 1 arose → E is in the word but not at 5 (since E in arose is at 5 and feedback is (-) meaning E is in word but not at 5). Thus E cannot be at 5, so pattern 2 is invalid.

Thus only pattern is R _ E E _.

Now find valid words:
- R _ E E _ with allowed letters.
- Allowed letters: B, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y.

Possible:
- R N E E K → ""rneek"" not valid.
- R H E E N → ""rh een"" not valid.
- R B E E N → ""rb e e n"" not valid.
- R M E E N → ""rm e e n"" not valid.
- R L E E N → ""rleen"" not valid.
- R P E E K → ""rpeek"" not valid.
- R N E E P → ""rneep"" not valid.
- R V E E N → ""rveen"" not valid.
- R W E E N → ""rween"" not valid.
- R Y E E N → ""ryeen"" not valid.

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternative approach: perhaps the word has only one E at position 4, and the (-) in creed for the E at position 2 simply means that E is in the word but not at position 2 (but could be at 1, 3, 5). But since we know E is at 4, and from arose E is not at 5, and from creed E is not at 2, the only possible positions for the second E is 1 or 3.

But R must be at 1 (from previous deductions), so the second E must be at 3. Thus the word must be R _ E E _.

But no valid words fit this pattern with allowed letters. This suggests I may have made an error in interpreting the feedback.

Re-reading the feedback:
- Guess 1: arose → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
This means:
- A, O, S not in word.
- R is in word but not at 2.
- E is in word but not at 5.

- Guess 2: tiger → T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(-)
This means:
- T, I, G not in word.
- E is at position 4 (✓).
- R is in word but not at 5.

- Guess 3: creed → C(x) R(-) E(-) E(✓) D(x)
This means:
- C, D not in word.
- R is in word but not at 3.
- E is in word but not at 2 (the E at position 2 in creed is in word but not at 2).
- E is at position 4 (✓).

Thus:
- E is fixed at 4.
- R is in word but not at 2, 3, 5 → must be at 1.
- The E in position 2 in creed is in word but not at 2 → this implies there is another E in the word at 1, 3, or 5. But:
   - R is at 1, so E cannot be at 1.
   - From arose, E is not at 5.
   - Thus E must be at 3.

Thus the word must be R _ E E _.

But as before, no valid words fit R _ E E _ with allowed letters. This suggests either:
1. I'm missing a valid word.
2. There's an error in my deductions.

Upon reflection, the feedback from creed says the E at position 2 is in the word but not at 2. This does NOT necessarily mean there is another E in the word; it could mean that the E at position 2 is part of a larger E (like ""EE"" in ""REED""), but the feedback is indicating that the specific E at position 2 is in the word but not at 2. This is a bit ambiguous.

However, in Wordle-style games, typically each letter is considered independently. Thus:
- From creed: E at position 2 is in word but not at 2 → this implies there is an E in the word but not at 2.
- We already have E at 4, so this could simply mean that the E at position 2 in creed is a separate E (but this would require two E's).

Thus, the word must have two E's: one at 4 and one at 1, 3, or 5 (but R is at 1, so 3 or 5).

But from arose, E is not at 5, so the second E must be at 3. Thus R _ E E _.

But no valid words fit this. Thus, perhaps the word has only one E at 4, and the (-) in creed simply indicates that E is in word but not at 2 (but we already know it's at 4). This would mean the word has only one E at 4, and the previous interpretations may have overcounted.

Thus, re-evaluate:
- E is at 4 (only).
- R is at 1 (only).
- Thus word starts with R and has E at 4: R _ _ E _.
- R must be at 1 (since not at 2,3,5).
- Now find words R _ _ E _ with no A, O, S, T, I, G, C, D.

Possible letters for positions 2,3,5: B, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y.

Possible words:
- R N E E K → invalid (D from creed, but K is allowed, but word is R N E E K? This has E at 3,4, which would be two E's, but we're considering only one E at 4.
- R H E E N → invalid.
- R B E E N → invalid.
- R M E E N → invalid.
- R L E E N → invalid.
- R N E E P → invalid.
- R P E E K → invalid.
- R N E E V → invalid.
- R N E E Y → invalid.

This is problematic. Let me think of actual words starting with R and having E at 4:
- R E E D S → D and S invalid.
- R E E K S → S invalid.
- R E E N S → N and S invalid.
- R E E P S → S invalid.
- R E E V S → S invalid.
- R E E N Y → Y is allowed, but N is allowed: ""reeny"" is not valid.
- R E E M P → ""reemp"" is not valid.

Wait, perhaps the word is ""rue"" related, but must be 5 letters.

Actually, let me list all 5-letter words starting with R and having E at position 4, avoiding forbidden letters (A,O,S,T,I,G,C,D):

Forbidden letters: A, O, S, T, I, G, C, D.

Allowed letters: B, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, plus E (at 4), R (at 1).

Pattern: R _ _ E _

Possible combinations:
- R N E E K → K is allowed, but word is ""rneek"" which is invalid.
- R H E E N → ""rh een"" is invalid.
- R B E E N → invalid.
- R M E E N → invalid.
- R L E E N → invalid.
- R N E E P → invalid.
- R P E E K → invalid.
- R V E E N → invalid.
- R W E E N → invalid.
- R Y E E N → invalid.

This suggests no valid words fit, which is impossible. Thus, my earlier deduction that R must be at 1 is correct, but the word must have only one E at 4, and the (-) in creed simply indicates E is in word but not at 2 (but we already know it's at 4). Thus, the word is R _ _ E _ with no other E.

Thus, find R _ _ E _ with no A, O, S, T, I, G, C, D.

Possible words:
- R U N E Y → R U N E Y → valid word ""rune y"" but is ""rune y"" a word? ""rune"" is 4 letters.
- R U M E N → ""rumen"" is valid (but contains U, M, E, N).
- R U V E N → invalid.
- R U P E N → invalid.
- R U B E N → invalid.
- R U L E N → ""rulen"" is invalid.
- R U F E N → invalid.
- R H U E N → invalid.
- R N U E M → invalid.
- R N E U M → invalid.

Actually, let me think of valid words:
- R U N E Y → not valid.
- R U M E N → ""rumen"" is valid (but is it a common word?).
- R U L E D → D is invalid.
- R U L E S → S invalid.
- R U L E N → invalid.
- R U B E N → invalid.
- R U L E M → invalid.
- R U P E N → invalid.
- R U V E N → invalid.
- R U F E N → invalid.
- R U N E M → invalid.

This is tricky. Another approach: perhaps the word is ""ruble"" but E is at 4, so R U B L E → E is at 5, but from arose E is not at 5. Thus invalid.

Wait, let me list all valid 5-letter words starting with R and having E at position 4, avoiding forbidden letters:

Valid words:
- R U M E N → ""rumen"" (but is this a valid English word? Yes, it's a word meaning the part of the stomach in ruminants.)
- R U N E M → invalid.
- R U B E N → invalid.
- R U L E N → invalid.
- R U P E N → invalid.
- R U V E N → invalid.
- R U F E N → invalid.
- R H U E N → invalid.
- R N U E M → invalid.
- R N E U M → invalid.

Thus, the only plausible word seems to be ""rumen"", but I'm not certain it's in the allowed set. However, based on the constraints, this appears to be the only possible word.

But let me double-check:
- R U M E N:
   - R at 1 (required)
   - U at 2 (allowed)
   - M at 3 (allowed)
   - E at 4 (correct)
   - N at 5 (allowed)
   - No forbidden letters (A,O,S,T,I,G,C,D).

Thus, ""rumen"" seems valid.

<guess>rumen</guess>Based on all the feedback and deductions:
- E is fixed at position 4.
- R is fixed at position 1 (since it cannot be at 2,3,5 and must appear).
- The remaining letters must be chosen from the allowed set to avoid disallowed letters (A, O, S, T, I, G, C, D).

The only valid word fitting these constraints is:

<guess>rumen</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tiger -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(-)
Guess 3: creed -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) E(-) E(✓) D(x)
Guess 4: rumen -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) U(x) M(x) E(✓) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the latest feedback on ""rumen"":
- R(✓): R is in position 1.
- U(x): U is not in the word.
- M(x): M is not in the word.
- E(✓): E is in position 4.
- N(x): N is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters fixed: R _ _ E _
- Letters definitely absent: A, O, S, T, I, G, C, D, U, M, N
- Remaining possible letters (from the alphabet minus the absent ones): B, F, H, K, L, P, V, W, Y

We need to fill positions 2 and 3 and 5 with these remaining letters, ensuring we don't repeat any letters unnecessarily (though repetition isn't ruled out).

Possible patterns: R _ _ E _

Let's list valid 5-letter words starting with R and ending with E, with the middle letters chosen from B, F, H, K, L, P, V, W, Y.

Possible candidates:
- R B L E Y
- R B F E Y
- R H L E Y
- R H F E Y
- R P L E Y
- R P F E Y
- R V L E Y
- R V F E Y
- R W L E Y
- R W F E Y
- R Y L E Y
- R Y F E Y

Checking which of these are valid English words:
- R B L E Y → ""rbley"" - invalid
- R B F E Y → ""rbfe y"" - invalid
- R H L E Y → ""rhley"" - invalid
- R H F E Y → ""rhfe y"" - invalid
- R P L E Y → ""rplay"" - invalid
- R P F E Y → ""rpfe y"" - invalid
- R V L E Y → ""rvley"" - invalid
- R V F E Y → ""rvfe y"" - invalid
- R W L E Y → ""rwley"" - invalid
- R W F E Y → ""rwfe y"" - invalid
- R Y L E Y → ""ryley"" - invalid
- R Y F E Y → ""ryfe y"" - invalid

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Let me reconsider - perhaps the word doesn't need to end with E in position 5, just have E in position 4. So the pattern is R _ _ E _ with the last letter being any allowed letter except the absent ones.

Valid English words fitting R _ _ E _ with letters from B, F, H, K, L, P, V, W, Y in positions 2,3,5:

- R E E D S - but D and S are invalid
- R E E K S - S invalid
- R E E N S - N invalid
- R E E P S - S invalid
- R E E V S - S invalid
- R E E M P - M invalid
- R E E L Y - E is already used in position 4, but we can have two E's
   - R E E L Y → but L and Y are allowed
   - However, this would have E in positions 2 and 4, but from feedback E is only confirmed at 4
   - Also, ""reely"" is a valid word (though rare)

But let's think of more common words:
- R E E L Y - ""reely"" (valid)
- R E E K Y - K and Y allowed, ""reek y"" - invalid
- R E E L K - invalid
- R E E L B - invalid
- R E E L F - invalid
- R E E L V - invalid
- R E E L W - invalid
- R E E L P - invalid
- R E E L H - invalid
- R E E L Y - ""reely"" (valid)

Another approach: perhaps the word has no additional E's beyond position 4, so R _ _ E _ with no second E.

Valid words:
- R B L E Y - invalid
- R B F E Y - invalid
- R H L E Y - invalid
- R H F E Y - invalid
- R P L E Y - invalid
- R P F E Y - invalid
- R V L E Y - invalid
- R V F E Y - invalid
- R W L E Y - invalid
- R W F E Y - invalid
- R Y L E Y - invalid
- R Y F E Y - invalid

This is also not yielding valid words. Let me try a different set of middle letters, perhaps including E in position 3:

Pattern: R _ E E _ - but from feedback E is only confirmed at 4, and we don't know about a second E
- R B E E K - K allowed, but ""rbEEK"" invalid
- R H E E K - invalid
- R P E E K - invalid
- R V E E K - invalid
- R W E E K - invalid
- R Y E E K - invalid

This isn't working. Let me try simpler combinations:

- R B E L Y - ""rbel y"" invalid
- R F E L Y - ""rfe ly"" invalid
- R H E L Y - ""rhely"" invalid
- R K E L Y - ""rke ly"" invalid
- R L E B Y - invalid
- R L E F Y - invalid
- R L E H Y - invalid
- R L E K Y - invalid
- R L E P Y - invalid
- R L E V Y - invalid
- R L E W Y - invalid
- R L E Y B - invalid

I'm realizing I need to think of actual words, not just letter combinations. Let me list real 5-letter words starting with R and having E in position 4, with the other letters from the allowed set:

Allowed letters for positions 2,3,5: B, F, H, K, L, P, V, W, Y

Valid words:
- R E E D S - D and S invalid
- R E E K S - S invalid
- R E E N S - N invalid
- R E E P S - S invalid
- R E E V S - S invalid
- R E E M P - M invalid
- R E E L Y - ""reely"" (valid, though rare)
- R E E L K - invalid
- R E E L B - invalid
- R E E L F - invalid
- R E E L V - invalid
- R E E L W - invalid
- R E E L P - invalid
- R E E L Y - ""reely""

Another word: ""reek y"" - invalid
""reedy"" - D invalid
""rebel"" - B and L allowed, but E in position 2 conflicts with feedback (E is in word but not at 2 from creed)
But ""rebel"" has E at 2 which is invalid.

Wait, the feedback from creed says E is in the word but not at 2, so we cannot have E at 2. Thus, no second E in position 2.

Thus, possible words:
- R B L E Y - invalid
- R B F E Y - invalid
- R H L E Y - invalid
- R H F E Y - invalid
- R P L E Y - invalid
- R P F E Y - invalid
- R V L E Y - invalid
- R V F E Y - invalid
- R W L E Y - invalid
- R W F E Y - invalid
- R Y L E Y - invalid
- R Y F E Y - invalid

This is perplexing. Let me try a different pattern: R _ _ E _ with no second E, and letters from B, F, H, K, L, P, V, W, Y.

Valid words:
- R B L E Y - invalid
- R B F E Y - invalid
- R H L E Y - invalid
- R H F E Y - invalid
- R K L E Y - invalid
- R K F E Y - invalid
- R P L E Y - invalid
- R P F E Y - invalid
- R V L E Y - invalid
- R V F E Y - invalid
- R W L E Y - invalid
- R W F E Y - invalid
- R Y L E Y - invalid
- R Y F E Y - invalid

I'm realizing I'm not finding valid words. Let me try simpler combinations:

- R E E L Y - ""reely"" (valid, though rare)
- R E E L K - invalid
- R E E L B - invalid
- R E E L F - invalid
- R E E L V - invalid
- R E E L W - invalid
- R E E L P - invalid
- R E E L Y - ""reely""

This seems to be the only valid word fitting the pattern. Even though it's rare, it's the only candidate.

Thus, the next guess is ""reely"".Based on all the feedback, the word must start with R, have E in the 4th position, and cannot contain any of the eliminated letters. The only valid English word fitting these constraints is:

<guess>reely</guess><|im_end|>

Since position 4 is taken by E, the other E must be in position 1 or 3. But position 4 is already E, so the word must have two E\'s, one at position 4 and another at 1 or 3.\n\nBut we have:\n- R must be in position 1 (only remaining spot).\n- So the word is R E _ E _ or R _ E E _.\n\nBut we also know:\n- From guess 1: arose → R is in the word but not in position 2 (consistent with R in position 1).\n- From guess 2: tiger → R is in the word but not in position 5 (consistent).\n- From guess 3: creed → R is in the word but not in position 3 (consistent).\n\nThus, R must be in position 1, and there must be another E in position 3 (since position 2 is invalid for E, and position 4 is already E). So the pattern is R _ E E _.\n\nNow we need to find a 5-letter word that:\n1. Starts with R.\n2. Has E in position 3 and E in position 4.\n3. Does not contain A, O, S, T, I, G, C, D.\n4.

So ""rebel"" is R E B E L → this fits the pattern R E B E L!\n\nCheck ""rebel"":\n- R in position 1 (must be correct).\n- E in position 2 (but from creed feedback, E is in the word but not in position 2). This is a conflict.\n\nSo ""rebel"" is invalid because E cannot be in position 2.\n\nNext possible word: ""rhein"" (but I is invalid).\n""rheum"" (u and m are allowed, but H is allowed, U is allowed, M is allowed). But this has H in position 2, E in 3, E in 4, M in 5, but ""rheum"" is R H E U M → U is allowed, but E is in 3 and 4, but we need E in 4 only, and the other E must be in 3. So ""rheum"" has only one E (position 3), but position 4 is E, so this is actually R H E U M → no, this has only one E in position 3, and position 4 is E from the feedback, but the word would need to have two E\'s. So ""rheum"" is invalid.\n\nWait, the feedback says:\n- creed → C(x) R(-) E(-) E(✓) D(x)\nThis means:\n- E is in position 4 (✓)\n- The E in position 2 is in the word but not in position 2 (-)\nThus, the word must have exactly one E at position 4, and the E in position 2 in creed is actually indicating that there is another E in the word but not at position 2. This implies the word has two E\'s: one at position 4 and another at 1, 3, or 5 (but R is at 1, so 3 or 5).\n\nBut from guess 3, R is in the word but not in position 3 (already satisfied since R is at 1), and the E in position 2 is in the word but not at 2. Thus, the word must have another E at 3 or 5.\n\nThus possible patterns:\n1. R _ E E _ (E at 3, 4)\n2. R _ _ E E (E at 4, 5)\n\nBut from guess 1 arose → E is in the word but not at 5 (since E in arose is at 5 and feedback is (-) meaning E is in word but not at 5). Thus E cannot be at 5, so pattern 2 is invalid.\n\nThus only pattern is R _ E E _.\n\nNow find valid words:\n- R _ E E _ with allowed letters.\n- Allowed letters: B, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y.\n\nPossible:\n- R N E E K → ""rneek"" not valid.\n- R H E E N → ""rh een"" not valid.\n- R B E E N → ""rb e e n"" not valid.\n- R M E E N → ""rm e e n"" not valid.\n- R L E E N → ""rleen"" not valid.\n- R P E E K → ""rpeek"" not valid.\n- R N E E P → ""rneep"" not valid.\n- R V E E N → ""rveen"" not valid.\n- R W E E N → ""rween"" not valid.\n- R Y E E N → ""ryeen"" not valid.\n\nHmm, none of these seem valid. Maybe I\'m missing something.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the word has only one E at position 4, and the (-) in creed for the E at position 2 simply means that E is in the word but not at position 2 (but could be at 1, 3, 5). But since we know E is at 4, and from arose E is not at 5, and from creed E is not at 2, the only possible positions for the second E is 1 or 3.\n\nBut R must be at 1 (from previous deductions), so the second E must be at 3. Thus the word must be R _ E E _.\n\nBut no valid words fit this pattern with allowed letters. This suggests I may have made an error in interpreting the feedback.\n\nRe-reading the feedback:\n- Guess 1: arose → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)\nThis means:\n- A, O, S not in word.\n- R is in word but not at 2.\n- E is in word but not at 5.\n\n- Guess 2: tiger → T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(-)\nThis means:\n- T, I, G not in word.\n- E is at position 4 (✓).\n- R is in word but not at 5.\n\n- Guess 3: creed → C(x) R(-) E(-) E(✓) D(x)\nThis means:\n- C, D not in word.\n- R is in word but not at 3.\n- E is in word but not at 2 (the E at position 2 in creed is in word but not at 2).\n- E is at position 4 (✓).\n\nThus:\n- E is fixed at 4.\n- R is in word but not at 2, 3, 5 → must be at 1.\n- The E in position 2 in creed is in word but not at 2 → this implies there is another E in the word at 1, 3, or 5. But:\n   - R is at 1, so E cannot be at 1.\n   - From arose, E is not at 5.\n   - Thus E must be at 3.\n\nThus the word must be R _ E E _.\n\nBut as before, no valid words fit R _ E E _ with allowed letters. This suggests either:\n1. I\'m missing a valid word.\n2. There\'s an error in my deductions.\n\nUpon reflection, the feedback from creed says the E at position 2 is in the word but not at 2. This does NOT necessarily mean there is another E in the word; it could mean that the E at position 2 is part of a larger E (like ""EE"" in ""REED""), but the feedback is indicating that the specific E at position 2 is in the word but not at 2. This is a bit ambiguous.\n\nHowever, in Wordle-style games, typically each letter is considered independently. Thus:\n- From creed: E at position 2 is in word but not at 2 → this implies there is an E in the word but not at 2.\n- We already have E at 4, so this could simply mean that the E at position 2 in creed is a separate E (but this would require two E\'s).\n\nThus, the word must have two E\'s: one at 4 and one at 1, 3, or 5 (but R is at 1, so 3 or 5).\n\nBut from arose, E is not at 5, so the second E must be at 3. Thus R _ E E _.\n\nBut no valid words fit this. Thus, perhaps the word has only one E at 4, and the (-) in creed simply indicates that E is in word but not at 2 (but we already know it\'s at 4). This would mean the word has only one E at 4, and the previous interpretations may have overcounted.\n\nThus, re-evaluate:\n- E is at 4 (only).\n- R is at 1 (only).\n- Thus word starts with R and has E at 4: R _ _ E _.\n- R must be at 1 (since not at 2,3,5).\n- Now find words R _ _ E _ with no A, O, S, T, I, G, C, D.\n\nPossible letters for positions 2,3,5: B, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y.\n\nPossible words:\n- R N E E K → invalid (D from creed, but K is allowed, but word is R N E E K? This has E at 3,4, which would be two E\'s, but we\'re considering only one E at 4.\n- R H E E N → invalid.\n- R B E E N → invalid.\n- R M E E N → invalid.\n- R L E E N → invalid.\n- R N E E P → invalid.\n- R P E E K → invalid.\n- R N E E V → invalid.\n- R N E E Y → invalid.\n\nThis is problematic. Let me think of actual words starting with R and having E at 4:\n- R E E D S → D and S invalid.\n- R E E K S → S invalid.\n- R E E N S → N and S invalid.\n- R E E P S → S invalid.\n- R E E V S → S invalid.\n- R E E N Y → Y is allowed, but N is allowed: ""reeny"" is not valid.\n- R E E M P → ""reemp"" is not valid.\n\nWait, perhaps the word is ""rue"" related, but must be 5 letters.\n\nActually, let me list all 5-letter words starting with R and having E at position 4, avoiding forbidden letters (A,O,S,T,I,G,C,D):\n\nForbidden letters: A, O, S, T, I, G, C, D.\n\nAllowed letters: B, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, plus E (at 4), R (at 1).\n\nPattern: R _ _ E _\n\nPossible combinations:\n- R N E E K → K is allowed, but word is ""rneek"" which is invalid.\n- R H E E N → ""rh een"" is invalid.\n- R B E E N → invalid.\n- R M E E N → invalid.\n- R L E E N → invalid.\n- R N E E P → invalid.\n- R P E E K → invalid.\n- R V E E N → invalid.\n- R W E E N → invalid.\n- R Y E E N → invalid.\n\nThis suggests no valid words fit, which is impossible. Thus, my earlier deduction that R must be at 1 is correct, but the word must have only one E at 4, and the (-) in creed simply indicates E is in word but not at 2 (but we already know it\'s at 4). Thus, the word is R _ _ E _ with no other E.\n\nThus, find R _ _ E _ with no A, O, S, T, I, G, C, D.\n\nPossible words:\n- R U N E Y → R U N E Y → valid word ""rune y"" but is ""rune y"" a word? ""rune"" is 4 letters.\n- R U M E N → ""rumen"" is valid (but contains U, M, E, N).\n- R U V E N → invalid.\n- R U P E N → invalid.\n- R U B E N → invalid.\n- R U L E N → ""rulen"" is invalid.\n- R U F E N → invalid.\n- R H U E N → invalid.\n- R N U E M → invalid.\n- R N E U M → invalid.\n\nActually, let me think of valid words:\n- R U N E Y → not valid.\n- R U M E N → ""rumen"" is valid (but is it a common word?).\n- R U L E D → D is invalid.\n- R U L E S → S invalid.\n- R U L E N → invalid.\n- R U B E N → invalid.\n- R U L E M → invalid.\n- R U P E N → invalid.\n- R U V E N → invalid.\n- R U F E N → invalid.\n- R U N E M → invalid.\n\nThis is tricky. Another approach: perhaps the word is ""ruble"" but E is at 4, so R U B L E → E is at 5, but from arose E is not at 5. Thus invalid.\n\nWait, let me list all valid 5-letter words starting with R and having E at position 4, avoiding forbidden letters:\n\nValid words:\n- R U M E N → ""rumen"" (but is this a valid English word? Yes, it\'s a word meaning the part of the stomach in ruminants.)\n- R U N E M → invalid.\n- R U B E N → invalid.\n- R U L E N → invalid.\n- R U P E N → invalid.\n- R U V E N → invalid.\n- R U F E N → invalid.\n- R H U E N → invalid.\n- R N U E M → invalid.\n- R N E U M → invalid.\n\nThus, the only plausible word seems to be ""rumen"", but I\'m not certain it\'s in the allowed set. However, based on the constraints, this appears to be the only possible word.\n\nBut let me double-check:\n- R U M E N:\n   - R at 1 (required)\n   - U at 2 (allowed)\n   - M at 3 (allowed)\n   - E at 4 (correct)\n   - N at 5 (allowed)\n   - No forbidden letters (A,O,S,T,I,G,C,D).\n\nThus, ""rumen"" seems valid.\n\n<guess>rumen</guess>Based on all the feedback and deductions:\n- E is fixed at position 4.\n- R is fixed at position 1 (since it cannot be at 2,3,5 and must appear).\n- The remaining letters must be chosen from the allowed set to avoid disallowed letters (A, O, S, T, I, G, C, D).\n\nThe only valid word fitting these constraints is:\n\n<guess>rumen</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tiger -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(-)\nGuess 3: creed -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) E(-) E(✓) D(x)\nGuess 4: rumen -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) U(x) M(x) E(✓) N(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the latest feedback on ""rumen"":\n- R(✓): R is in position 1.\n- U(x): U is not in the word.\n- M(x): M is not in the word.\n- E(✓): E is in position 4.\n- N(x): N is not in the word.\n\nSo far we know:\n- Letters fixed: R _ _ E _\n- Letters definitely absent: A, O, S, T, I, G, C, D, U, M, N\n- Remaining possible letters (from the alphabet minus the absent ones): B, F, H, K, L, P, V, W, Y\n\nWe need to fill positions 2 and 3 and 5 with these remaining letters, ensuring we don\'t repeat any letters unnecessarily (though repetition isn\'t ruled out).\n\nPossible patterns: R _ _ E _\n\nLet\'s list valid 5-letter words starting with R and ending with E, with the middle letters chosen from B, F, H, K, L, P, V, W, Y.\n\nPossible candidates:\n- R B L E Y\n- R B F E Y\n- R H L E Y\n- R H F E Y\n- R P L E Y\n- R P F E Y\n- R V L E Y\n- R V F E Y\n- R W L E Y\n- R W F E Y\n- R Y L E Y\n- R Y F E Y\n\nChecking which of these are valid English words:\n- R B L E Y → ""rbley"" - invalid\n- R B F E Y → ""rbfe y"" - invalid\n- R H L E Y → ""rhley"" - invalid\n- R H F E Y → ""rhfe y"" - invalid\n- R P L E Y → ""rplay"" - invalid\n- R P F E Y → ""rpfe y"" - invalid\n- R V L E Y → ""rvley"" - invalid\n- R V F E Y → ""rvfe y"" - invalid\n- R W L E Y → ""rwley"" - invalid\n- R W F E Y → ""rwfe y"" - invalid\n- R Y L E Y → ""ryley"" - invalid\n- R Y F E Y → ""ryfe y"" - invalid\n\nHmm, none of these seem valid.

From the new feedback on ""reely"":
- R(✓) E(✓) E(-) L(-) Y(x)

We now know:
- R is correctly at position 1.
- E is correctly at position 2.
- The E in position 3 is in the word but not at position 3 (so there must be another E elsewhere, but position 4 is already E, and position 5 is Y which is invalid, so this implies there must be a second E at position 3 - but feedback says it's not there). This is confusing - let me re-read carefully.

Actually, the feedback is per letter in the guess:
- R at position 1: ✓ (correct)
- E at position 2: ✓ (correct)
- E at position 3: - (this E is in the word but not at position 3)
- L at position 4: - (L is in the word but not at position 4)
- Y at position 5: x (Y is not in the word)

So the word looks like: R E _ _ _

Known:
- Must contain E (at least two times: positions 1 and 2 are already E, but the feedback says the E at position 3 is in the word but not there - this implies there must be a third E, but this seems unlikely. Wait, no - the feedback is that the E at position 3 in the guess is in the word but not at position 3 - meaning the word has an E that is not at position 3, but positions 1 and 2 are already E's. This suggests the word has at least two E's: positions 1 and 2 are correct, and there must be another E elsewhere (but position 4 is confirmed E by ✓, so this implies three E's - but this seems impossible in a 5-letter word with only two confirmed E's. I must be misinterpreting.

Let me re-express the feedback for ""reely"":
- R at 1: ✓ (correct)
- E at 2: ✓ (correct)
- E at 3: - (this E is in the word but not at position 3 - but positions 1 and 2 are already E's, so this implies the word has an E that is not at position 3 - but positions 1 and 2 are already E's, so this is redundant. This suggests the word has at least two E's at positions 1 and 2, and possibly another E elsewhere.

But the feedback for ""reely"" shows:
- E at 2: ✓ (so position 2 is definitely E)
- E at 3: - (so the E at position 3 in the guess is in the word but not at 3 - but since position 2 is E, this implies there is another E at position 4 or 5. However, from ""rumen"" feedback, E is confirmed at position 4. So the word must have E at positions 1, 2, and 4 - which is possible.

Thus the word structure is: R E _ E _

From ""reely"" feedback:
- L at position 4: - (L is in the word but not at position 4 - but we know E is at position 4, so L must be elsewhere - this implies L is at position 3 or 5, but position 3 is before E at 4, so possible.

Thus possible patterns:
- R E L E _ (but then L is at 3, E at 4, and Y is invalid at 5)
- R E _ E L (but then L is at 5, E at 4, and position 3 is empty)

Looking at allowed letters:
From previous eliminations, allowed letters are: B, F, H, K, L, P, V, W, Y (but Y is invalid from reely feedback).

Thus, possible words:
- R E L E _ : need a letter at 5 from B, F, H, K, P, V, W
   - R E L E B - invalid
   - R E L E F - ""rel ef"" invalid
   - R E L E K - invalid
   - R E L E P - invalid
   - R E L E V - invalid
   - R E L E W - invalid
- R E _ E L : need a letter at 3 from B, F, H, K, P, V, W
   - R E B E L - ""rebel"" - but from creed feedback, E is in word but not at 2, and ""rebel"" has E at 2 which is invalid
   - R E F E L - invalid
   - R E H E L - invalid
   - R E K E L - invalid
   - R E P E L - ""repel"" - valid word
   - R E V E L - invalid
   - R E W E L - invalid

Thus, the only valid word seems to be ""repel"".

Checking ""repel"":
- R at 1: ✓ (matches feedback)
- E at 2: ✓ (matches feedback)
- P at 3: not yet tested, but allowed
- E at 4: ✓ (matches feedback)
- L at 5: but from reely feedback, L at position 4 is ""-"", meaning L is in word but not at 4 - in ""repel"", L is at 5, so this is consistent.

Thus, ""repel"" fits all constraints.
</think>

Based on all the feedback, the word must start with ""RE"" and have an E in position 4, with L somewhere in the word and Y excluded. The only valid word fitting these constraints is:

<guess>repel</guess>",repel,"From the new feedback on ""reely"":
- R(✓) E(✓) E(-) L(-) Y(x)

We now know:
- R is correctly at position 1.
- E is correctly at position 2.
- The E in position 3 is in the word but not at position 3 (so there must be another E elsewhere, but position 4 is already E, and position 5 is Y which is invalid, so this implies there must be a second E at position 3 - but feedback says it's not there). This is confusing - let me re-read carefully.

Actually, the feedback is per letter in the guess:
- R at position 1: ✓ (correct)
- E at position 2: ✓ (correct)
- E at position 3: - (this E is in the word but not at position 3)
- L at position 4: - (L is in the word but not at position 4)
- Y at position 5: x (Y is not in the word)

So the word looks like: R E _ _ _
