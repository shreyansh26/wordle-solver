### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information I can get from the feedback. A good strategy is to use a word with common consonants and a mix of vowels. One popular starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position.
- S, L, A, T are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and does not contain S, L, A, T.

I need a 5-letter word that ends with E and avoids S, L, A, T.  
I’ll pick a word with common remaining consonants and vowels to gather more information.  
A good candidate is ""CRANE"":
- C, R, N are common consonants not yet ruled out.
- It uses the vowel A, but since A was already ruled out, this might not be ideal.  
Another option is ""CHORE"":
- C, H, O, R, E.  
  - O is a common vowel not yet tested.  
  - C, H, R are common consonants not yet ruled out.  
This seems better because it introduces a new vowel (O) and tests three new consonants (C, H, R).

- Letters NOT in the word at all: S, L, A, T, C, H, O.
- Letter R is in the word but NOT in position 4.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that avoids all the excluded letters. Remaining consonants to test: B, D, F, G, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc. Remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out).

Good candidate letters: R (must be placed in positions 1, 2, or 3), plus any new consonants or vowels we haven’t tried yet.

A good next word would test R in a new position while introducing new letters. Let’s try:
- “BRIDE”: B, R, I, D, E.  
  – Tests B, I, D and moves R to position 2.  
  – Uses I (new vowel) and avoids all excluded letters.

This seems like a strong choice.

Current confirmed facts:

- I is in the word and in the correct position 3.
- Letters NOT in the word at all: S, L, A, T, C, H, O, B, D.

So the pattern is: _ R I _ E

We still need to test consonants for positions 1 and 4. Remaining common consonants not yet tried: F, G, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y.

A good next word would test two new consonants in positions 1 and 4. Let's pick ""F"" and ""N"" to test: F R I N E. However, ""FRINE"" is not a valid English word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information I can get from the feedback. A good strategy is to use a word with common consonants and a mix of vowels. One popular starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position.
- S, L, A, T are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and does not contain S, L, A, T.

I need a 5-letter word that ends with E and avoids S, L, A, T.  
I’ll pick a word with common remaining consonants and vowels to gather more information.  
A good candidate is ""CRANE"":
- C, R, N are common consonants not yet ruled out.
- It uses the vowel A, but since A was already ruled out, this might not be ideal.  
Another option is ""CHORE"":
- C, H, O, R, E.  
  - O is a common vowel not yet tested.  
  - C, H, R are common consonants not yet ruled out.  
This seems better because it introduces a new vowel (O) and tests three new consonants (C, H, R).

Let’s go with ""CHORE"".

So far we know:
- The word ends with E (position 5).
- Letters NOT in the word at all: S, L, A, T, C, H, O.
- Letter R is in the word but NOT in position 4.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that avoids all the excluded letters. Remaining consonants to test: B, D, F, G, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc. Remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out).

Good candidate letters: R (must be placed in positions 1, 2, or 3), plus any new consonants or vowels we haven’t tried yet.

A good next word would test R in a new position while introducing new letters. Let’s try:
- “BRIDE”: B, R, I, D, E.  
  – Tests B, I, D and moves R to position 2.  
  – Uses I (new vowel) and avoids all excluded letters.

This seems like a strong choice.
