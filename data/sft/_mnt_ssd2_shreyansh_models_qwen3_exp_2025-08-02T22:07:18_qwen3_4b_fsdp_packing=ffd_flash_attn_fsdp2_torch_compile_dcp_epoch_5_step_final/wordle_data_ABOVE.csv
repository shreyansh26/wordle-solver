### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The letters E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C are among the most frequent in English, so I'll pick a word that uses some of these. 

Looking at combinations, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeated letters. This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

Current confirmed information:
- Pattern: A B O _ E
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, L, N, D
- Position 4 must be a letter that hasn’t appeared yet and isn’t R, S, L, N, or D.

Remaining common consonants for position 4: C, F, G, H, M, P, T, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: I, U (but O is already in place).

Common 5-letter words that fit A B O _ E:
- ABOME – not a valid word
- ABOKE – not a valid word
- ABOVE – valid word!
- ABOVE uses T (position 4) which hasn’t been ruled out.

Let’s try ABOVE.
