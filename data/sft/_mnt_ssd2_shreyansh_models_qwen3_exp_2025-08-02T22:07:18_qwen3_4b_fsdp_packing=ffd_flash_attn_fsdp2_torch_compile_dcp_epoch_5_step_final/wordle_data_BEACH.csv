### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and we have no prior information about the secret word, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good starting word often includes common vowels and consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word would use some of these. 

One popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- L(x) – L is not in the word.
- A(✓) – A is in the word and in the correct third position.
- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (it is not the fifth letter).

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ A _ _
- Letters to avoid entirely: S, L, T
- Letters to use elsewhere: E (but not at the end)

Good consonants left to try: R, N, C, H, D, M, P, B, G, etc.
Good vowels left to try: I, O, U (but A is already placed)

Let’s pick a word that:
- Has A in the third position,
- Uses E in a position other than 5,
- Avoids S, L, T,
- Introduces new common consonants.

A strong candidate is “CRANE”:
- C and R are new common consonants.
- A is confirmed in position 3.
- E is placed in position 4 (not 5, satisfying the feedback).

But wait – CRANE has E in position 4, which is fine. However, we might want to test more consonants. Another good choice is “CHARE” but that’s 5 letters and uses E in position 5 which we know is wrong. 

“CHARE” is invalid because E would be in position 5. 

Instead, let’s try “CHARD” – but that skips E entirely. We want to keep testing E in different positions.

“MEDIA” – but A is already in position 3, and E is in position 4 here. However, M and D are new consonants. But A is fixed at position 3, so MEDIA would have A in position 4 – that’s wrong.

“PEACH” – A is in position 3, E in position 2. Uses P and C, new consonants. H is new too. This seems good.

Check:
- P, E, A, C, H
- A is in position 3 – correct.
- E is in position 2 – not 5 – acceptable.
- No S, L, T – good.

Thus, “PEACH” is a solid next guess.

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(-)
Round 2: PEACH → P(x) E(✓) A(✓) C(✓) H(✓)

What we now know for sure:
- Letters in the word and their exact positions: E _ A C H (positions 2-5)
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, P
- Still-unknown: first letter (position 1)

The word must be of the form: ? E A C H
Only the first letter is variable. All other letters are locked in place.

Letters that can legally occupy position 1 (not yet ruled out):
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z

Among these, the most common English first letters are B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, R.

Let’s pick a first letter that is common and doesn’t repeat any already confirmed letters. C is already in position 4, so we’ll avoid it in position 1. H is already in position 5, so we’ll avoid it in position 1. That leaves B, D, F, G, K, M, N, R.

A very common word that fits ?EACH is “MEACH” – but “MEACH” is not a standard English word. The standard word is “MATCH” – but T is already ruled out.

Next best options:
- B EACH → BEACH (valid word)
- D EACH → DEACH (not standard)
- F EACH → FEACH (not standard)
- G EACH → GEACH (not standard)
- M EACH → MEACH (not standard)
- N EACH → NEACH (not standard)
- R EACH → REACH (valid word)

Between BEACH and REACH, both are valid. BEACH is slightly more common, but REACH is also very frequent. We’ll go with BEACH first, since it’s a common word and B is a frequent starting letter.

However, we must check: is BEACH a valid 5-letter English word? Yes, it is.

So the next logical guess is BEACH.
