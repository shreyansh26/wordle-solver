### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 3-4 of these common letters to quickly eliminate or confirm several possibilities. 

After considering options, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E), which will give us maximum feedback about letter positions and presence in the secret word.

We know:
- E is in the word and is in the correct (last) position.
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends in E and does not contain A, R, O, S.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends in E
- Does not contain A, R, O, S
- Uses only remaining common letters (T, L, N, I, C, U, D, M, P, H, etc.)

A good next guess should introduce new common letters while respecting the constraints. The word ""UNTIE"" is invalid because it contains U and T (which could be useful) but also has I and E, and we already know E is in the last position. However, ""UNTIE"" contains U, N, T, I, E - but E is already known to be in position 5, so this is acceptable. But let's think of a word that introduces more new letters.

A better choice might be ""UNTIE"" but let me reconsider. We need to maximize new information. The word ""UNTIE"" is valid but contains U, N, T, I, E - and we already know E is in position 5. However, this uses U, N, T, I which are all new letters not yet tested.

But wait, ""UNTIE"" has E in the 5th position which matches our known info, and introduces U, N, T, I. This seems good.

However, let me think if there's a word that introduces more new letters or better covers remaining common letters. Another option is ""UNTIE"" or ""UNTIE"" is actually the best.

But let me think of ""UNTIE"" as a valid guess. It ends in E, doesn't contain A, R, O, S, and introduces U, N, T, I.

Alternatively, ""UNTIE"" is valid. So I'll go with ""UNTIE"".

""TITLE"" – has T, I, L, E. Ends in E. T is in position 1 (allowed), I in position 2 (allowed). L is new. This seems perfect.

4. Uses only the allowed letters.

Good candidate letters to test next: C, L, M, P, D, G, H, K, etc.

Let’s pick a word that places T in position 1 or 2 and I in 1, 2, or 3, while introducing new common letters.

A good choice is ""ITCHY"" but that has two Cs and an H, and we don’t know about C or H yet. However, ""ITCHY"" has:
- I in position 1 (allowed).
- T in position 2 (allowed).
- C, H, Y are new letters.
- Ends in Y, not E – invalid.

Next, ""TIGER"" – but R is already ruled out.

""WHITE"" – H and W are new, but W isn’t common.

""TITLE"" – has T, I, L, E. Ends in E. T is in position 1 (allowed), I in position 2 (allowed). L is new. This seems perfect.

Let’s verify:
- Ends in E: yes.
- Contains T (not in position 3): T is in 1st position – ok.
- Contains I (not in position 4): I is in 2nd position – ok.
- Letters: T, I, L, E. All allowed, no ruled-out letters.

So ""TITLE"" is a solid next guess.

Let’s summarize what we now know:

1. E is definitely in position 5 (✓ every time).
2. I is definitely in the word and is in position 2 (✓).
3. T is definitely in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from feedback: - in 1st, ✓ in 3rd, ✓ in 4th, so T must be in position 2 or 5. But position 2 is already taken by I, so T must be in position 5).
4. From guess 3 we also see L is in the word but not in position 4 (-).

So the pattern is now: _ I _ _ E  
with T in position 5, and L somewhere (but not 4).

Thus the word must be: _ I _ L E or _ I _ _ L E, but since E is fixed at 5, it must be _ I _ L E.

Letters ruled out so far: A, R, O, S, U, N, plus any used and ruled out positions (T not in 1,3,4 so only 5, etc.).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 2.
- Has L in position 4.
- Has T in position 5.
- Has valid letters in positions 1 and 3 from remaining unused common letters (B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).

A quick scan of common English words fitting _ I _ L E with T in 5 gives us ""BIBLE"" (but B is repeated), ""CIBLE"" (invalid), ""DIBLE"" (invalid), ""FIBLE"" (invalid), ""GIBLE"" (invalid), ""MIBLE"" (invalid), ""PIBLE"" (invalid), ""VIBLE"" (invalid), ""WIBLE"" (invalid), ""XIBLE"" (invalid), ""YIBLE"" (invalid), ""ZIBLE"" (invalid).

Wait, the only common word that fits is ""BIBLE"" but it repeats B, which might not be optimal. Let me think of other possibilities.

Looking at _ I _ L E with T in 5, the valid word is ""BIBLE"" (but B is in position 1 and 4, and 4 is L, so no). Actually, the pattern is _ I _ L E with T in 5, so the word must be something like ""D I _ L E"" but T is in 5, so:

Wait, the pattern is: pos1, I, pos3, L, E with T in pos5. So the word must be pos1 I pos3 L E, but T is in pos5, which is E. This suggests my earlier conclusion is flawed.

Let me re-examine:

From guess 3 (title → T(-) I(✓) T(✓) L(-) E(✓)):

- T is in the word, but position 1 is wrong (-), position 3 is correct (✓), position 4 is wrong (-), position 5 is correct (✓).
- I is in position 2 (✓).
- L is in the word but position 4 is wrong (-).

So the pattern is: _ I T _ E  
with L somewhere (but not position 4).

Thus the word must be: _ I T _ E and contain L not in position 4.

Possible positions for L: 1 or 3. But position 3 is T, so L must be in position 1.

Thus the word must be L I T _ E.

Looking for 5-letter words that are L I T _ E:

- LITHE (valid)
- LITES (but S is ruled out)
- LITEN (but N is ruled out)
- LITHE is the only valid word left.

Let's verify LITHE:
- Ends in E (✓).
- Contains T in position 3 (✓ from guess 3).
- Contains I in position 2 (✓ from guess 3).
- Contains L in position 1 (not ruled out).
- Uses only allowed letters (H is new but allowed).

Thus, the next guess is LITHE.
