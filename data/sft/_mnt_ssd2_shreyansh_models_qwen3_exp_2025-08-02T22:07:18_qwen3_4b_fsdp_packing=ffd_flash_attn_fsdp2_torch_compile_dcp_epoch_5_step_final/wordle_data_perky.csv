1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should cover several of these. 

""SLATE"" is a strong choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us a good spread of consonants and vowels to test against the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains E
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T
- Has E in any position except the 5th (since that’s where it was in SLATE)

We now want a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses E in a different position (not 5th)
- Avoids S, L, A, T entirely
- Uses common letters not yet ruled out

Common consonants not yet ruled out: R, N, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, K, V, W, Y, Z, X, Q, J
Common vowels not yet ruled out: I, O, U (since A is out and E is confirmed)

A good second guess should use fresh common letters and place E in a new spot. “CRONE” is a strong candidate because:
- C, R, O, N are all high-frequency letters not yet tested
- E is moved to the 3rd position (new location)
- It avoids the eliminated letters S, L, A, T

Let’s try CRONE.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, O, N
2. Letters that ARE in the word but are misplaced: R, E  
   – R is somewhere other than position 2  
   – E is somewhere other than positions 4 or 5  

So the secret word:
- Contains both R and E  
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T, C, O, N  
- E can be in position 1, 2, or 3  
- R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5  

Remaining common letters that have not been tested yet include: D, P, M, H, G, B, F, I, U, Y, W, K, V

We want a word that:
- Uses R and E in new positions  
- Avoids all the eliminated letters  
- Uses fresh common consonants to maximize information  

A good candidate is “DRIVE”:
- D, I, V are new common letters  
- R is now in position 2 (was in 3 before)  
- E is now in position 4 (was in 5 before)  

But note that E cannot be in 4 or 5, so DRIVE is invalid because it puts E in 4.

Let’s try “BRIEF” instead:
- B, F are new common letters  
- R is in position 2 (was 3)  
- E is in position 4 → again invalid (E cannot be in 4 or 5)

Next candidate: “MERGE” – but G is untested and E appears twice, which might not help.

Try “PERVY”:
- P, V, Y are new  
- E in position 2 (valid)  
- R in position 3 (valid)  

This seems good: it places E in 2 and R in 3, uses new letters P, V, Y.

Another option is “DIRTY” – but T is eliminated.

“FURRY” – but R repeats and Y is less common.

“MERGE” – G is okay, but E repeats.

“PERKY” – P, K, Y new; E in 2, R in 3. Looks best.
