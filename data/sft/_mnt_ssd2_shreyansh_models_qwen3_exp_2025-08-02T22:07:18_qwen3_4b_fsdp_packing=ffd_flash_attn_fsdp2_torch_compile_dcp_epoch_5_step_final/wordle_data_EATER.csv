### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help us eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters in different positions.

A popular and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and tests vowels in multiple positions. This gives us good coverage to narrow down the possibilities quickly.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - also very common letters.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers a slightly broader range of common letters.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but wrong position (–)
- R is in the word but wrong position (–)
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but wrong position (–)

So we now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: O, S
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, R, E (but not in their original positions: A not in 1st, R not in 2nd, E not in 5th)

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, R, E
2. Does NOT contain O or S
3. Arranges A, R, E differently from their original positions (A not in 1st, R not in 2nd, E not in 5th)

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints. One systematic way is to pick a word that shifts A, R, E to new positions and fills the remaining two slots with new letters that haven’t been ruled out.

A good candidate is “RANGE”:
- Contains R, A, N, G, E
- Doesn’t contain O or S
- Positions: R is now in 1st (originally 2nd), A is in 2nd (originally 1st), E is in 5th (originally 5th – but this is the same position as E in AROSE, which violates the feedback that E was in the wrong position). So RANGE is invalid because E is still in the 5th spot.

Next candidate: “REACT”
- Contains R, E, A, C, T
- Doesn’t contain O or S
- Positions: R in 1st (originally 2nd), E in 2nd (originally 5th), A in 3rd (originally 1st) – this satisfies all constraints.

Let’s verify:
- A is in word, now in 3rd (was 1st) ✓
- R is in word, now in 1st (was 2nd) ✓
- E is in word, now in 2nd (was 5th) ✓
- Doesn’t contain O or S ✓
- New letters C and T haven’t been used yet ✓

Thus, “REACT” is a valid next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help us eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters in different positions.

A popular and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and tests vowels in multiple positions. This gives us good coverage to narrow down the possibilities quickly.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - also very common letters.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers a slightly broader range of common letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but wrong position (–)
- R is in the word but wrong position (–)
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but wrong position (–)

So we now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: O, S
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, R, E (but not in their original positions: A not in 1st, R not in 2nd, E not in 5th)

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, R, E
2. Does NOT contain O or S
3. Arranges A, R, E differently from their original positions (A not in 1st, R not in 2nd, E not in 5th)

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints. One systematic way is to pick a word that shifts A, R, E to new positions and fills the remaining two slots with new letters that haven’t been ruled out.

A good candidate is “RANGE”:
- Contains R, A, N, G, E
- Doesn’t contain O or S
- Positions: R is now in 1st (originally 2nd), A is in 2nd (originally 1st), E is in 5th (originally 5th – but this is the same position as E in AROSE, which violates the feedback that E was in the wrong position). So RANGE is invalid because E is still in the 5th spot.

Next candidate: “REACT”
- Contains R, E, A, C, T
- Doesn’t contain O or S
- Positions: R in 1st (originally 2nd), E in 2nd (originally 5th), A in 3rd (originally 1st) – this satisfies all constraints.

Let’s verify:
- A is in word, now in 3rd (was 1st) ✓
- R is in word, now in 1st (was 2nd) ✓
- E is in word, now in 2nd (was 5th) ✓
- Doesn’t contain O or S ✓
- New letters C and T haven’t been used yet ✓

Thus, “REACT” is a valid next guess.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters definitely in the word: A, R, E, T  
   (each appeared as “-” or “✓” in at least one guess)

2. Letters definitely NOT in the word: O, S, C  
   (each appeared as “x” in one guess)

3. Forbidden positions so far:
   - A cannot be in spots 1, 3  
   - R cannot be in spots 1, 2  
   - E cannot be in spots 2, 5  
   - T cannot be in spot 5  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- contains A, R, E, T plus one new letter (not O, S, C)  
- places A, R, E, T in previously untested or compliant positions  
- uses only letters from {A, R, E, T, ?} where ? is any unused legal letter (e.g., D, I, N, etc.)

A good candidate is “TREAD”:
- Letters: T, R, E, A, D  
- Contains all required letters (A, R, E, T) plus D (new, not O/S/C)  
- Positions:
  – T is now in 1st (was never in 1st before) ✓  
  – R is now in 2nd (was 2nd in REACT, but feedback was “-” so position 2 is still invalid; therefore R must NOT be in 2nd) → TREAD is invalid because R is in 2nd again.

Next candidate: “TRAVE” – contains V (new), but E is in 5th (invalid).

Next: “EARLY” – has L and Y (new), but L/Y not yet ruled out, and positions fit:
- E in 1st (new position, allowed)  
- A in 2nd (allowed)  
- R in 3rd (allowed)  
- L, Y new, not yet excluded  
- T missing – must include T.

We must include T, so we need a word with A, R, E, T plus one new letter, arranged so that:
- A is not 1st or 3rd  
- R is not 1st or 2nd  
- E is not 2nd or 5th  
- T is not 5th  

A valid arrangement is:
T 4th, A 2nd, R 3rd, E 1st, plus a new letter in 5th (must not be O/S/C).

Candidate: “TREAD” again fails on R in 2nd.

Candidate: “TAPER”:
- T 1st (allowed)  
- A 2nd (allowed)  
- P new, not O/S/C  
- E 4th (allowed)  
- R 5th (allowed)  
Contains A, R, E, T plus P. All constraints satisfied.

Let’s confirm:
- A is in 2nd (not 1st or 3rd) ✓  
- R is in 5th (not 1st or 2nd) ✓  
- E is in 4th (not 2nd or 5th) ✓  
- T is in 1st (not 5th) ✓  
- P is new, not O/S/C ✓  

Therefore, “TAPER” is a valid next guess.

From the feedback so far:

Letters we know are in the word and in the correct positions:
- A is in position 2
- E is in position 4
- R is in position 5

Letters we know are in the word but NOT in these positions (so they must appear elsewhere):
- T (from TAPER feedback: T(-) means T is in the word but not in position 1)
- Also re-check earlier feedback:
  – AROSE: A(-) R(-) E(-) → A, R, E all in word but wrong positions
  – REACT: R(-) E(-) A(-) → same trio
  – TAPER: T(-) → T in word but not pos 1

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
- O, S, C, P (from any x in feedback)

So the word looks like: _ A _ E R with:
- T must appear somewhere (positions 2,3,4,5 already occupied by A,E,R, so T must be in position 3)
- Remaining slot (position 1) must be a new letter not yet used and not O/S/C/P

Thus the word must be: ? A T E R where ? is a new letter not in {O,S,C,P}

Possible first letters (common, not excluded): B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Thus the word must be: ? A T E R where ? is a new letter not in {O,S,C,P}

Possible first letters (common, not excluded): B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

A good candidate is ""BATER"" but ""BATER"" is not a common word. Next, ""HATER"" is valid.

Another possibility is “DATER” (but that’s not standard). “LATER” is also valid, but LATER is already implied by the pattern.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help us eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters in different positions.

A popular and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and tests vowels in multiple positions. This gives us good coverage to narrow down the possibilities quickly.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - also very common letters.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers a slightly broader range of common letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but wrong position (–)
- R is in the word but wrong position (–)
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but wrong position (–)

So we now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: O, S
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, R, E (but not in their original positions: A not in 1st, R not in 2nd, E not in 5th)

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, R, E
2. Does NOT contain O or S
3. Arranges A, R, E differently from their original positions (A not in 1st, R not in 2nd, E not in 5th)

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints. One systematic way is to pick a word that shifts A, R, E to new positions and fills the remaining two slots with new letters that haven’t been ruled out.

A good candidate is “RANGE”:
- Contains R, A, N, G, E
- Doesn’t contain O or S
- Positions: R is now in 1st (originally 2nd), A is in 2nd (originally 1st), E is in 5th (originally 5th – but this is the same position as E in AROSE, which violates the feedback that E was in the wrong position). So RANGE is invalid because E is still in the 5th spot.

Next candidate: “REACT”
- Contains R, E, A, C, T
- Doesn’t contain O or S
- Positions: R in 1st (originally 2nd), E in 2nd (originally 5th), A in 3rd (originally 1st) – this satisfies all constraints.

Let’s verify:
- A is in word, now in 3rd (was 1st) ✓
- R is in word, now in 1st (was 2nd) ✓
- E is in word, now in 2nd (was 5th) ✓
- Doesn’t contain O or S ✓
- New letters C and T haven’t been used yet ✓

Thus, “REACT” is a valid next guess.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters definitely in the word: A, R, E, T  
   (each appeared as “-” or “✓” in at least one guess)

2. Letters definitely NOT in the word: O, S, C  
   (each appeared as “x” in one guess)

3. Forbidden positions so far:
   - A cannot be in spots 1, 3  
   - R cannot be in spots 1, 2  
   - E cannot be in spots 2, 5  
   - T cannot be in spot 5  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- contains A, R, E, T plus one new letter (not O, S, C)  
- places A, R, E, T in previously untested or compliant positions  
- uses only letters from {A, R, E, T, ?} where ? is any unused legal letter (e.g., D, I, N, etc.)

A good candidate is “TREAD”:
- Letters: T, R, E, A, D  
- Contains all required letters (A, R, E, T) plus D (new, not O/S/C)  
- Positions:
  – T is now in 1st (was never in 1st before) ✓  
  – R is now in 2nd (was 2nd in REACT, but feedback was “-” so position 2 is still invalid; therefore R must NOT be in 2nd) → TREAD is invalid because R is in 2nd again.

Next candidate: “TRAVE” – contains V (new), but E is in 5th (invalid).

Next: “EARLY” – has L and Y (new), but L/Y not yet ruled out, and positions fit:
- E in 1st (new position, allowed)  
- A in 2nd (allowed)  
- R in 3rd (allowed)  
- L, Y new, not yet excluded  
- T missing – must include T.

We must include T, so we need a word with A, R, E, T plus one new letter, arranged so that:
- A is not 1st or 3rd  
- R is not 1st or 2nd  
- E is not 2nd or 5th  
- T is not 5th  

A valid arrangement is:
T 4th, A 2nd, R 3rd, E 1st, plus a new letter in 5th (must not be O/S/C).

Candidate: “TREAD” again fails on R in 2nd.

Candidate: “TAPER”:
- T 1st (allowed)  
- A 2nd (allowed)  
- P new, not O/S/C  
- E 4th (allowed)  
- R 5th (allowed)  
Contains A, R, E, T plus P. All constraints satisfied.

Let’s confirm:
- A is in 2nd (not 1st or 3rd) ✓  
- R is in 5th (not 1st or 2nd) ✓  
- E is in 4th (not 2nd or 5th) ✓  
- T is in 1st (not 5th) ✓  
- P is new, not O/S/C ✓  

Therefore, “TAPER” is a valid next guess.

From the feedback so far:

Letters we know are in the word and in the correct positions:
- A is in position 2
- E is in position 4
- R is in position 5

Letters we know are in the word but NOT in these positions (so they must appear elsewhere):
- T (from TAPER feedback: T(-) means T is in the word but not in position 1)
- Also re-check earlier feedback:
  – AROSE: A(-) R(-) E(-) → A, R, E all in word but wrong positions
  – REACT: R(-) E(-) A(-) → same trio
  – TAPER: T(-) → T in word but not pos 1

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
- O, S, C, P (from any x in feedback)

So the word looks like: _ A _ E R with:
- T must appear somewhere (positions 2,3,4,5 already occupied by A,E,R, so T must be in position 3)
- Remaining slot (position 1) must be a new letter not yet used and not O/S/C/P

Thus the word must be: ? A T E R where ? is a new letter not in {O,S,C,P}

Possible first letters (common, not excluded): B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

A good candidate is ""BATER"" but ""BATER"" is not a common word. Next, ""HATER"" is valid.

Check ""HATER"":

This gives us good coverage to narrow down the possibilities quickly.\n\nAnother strong candidate is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - also very common letters.\n\nI\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers a slightly broader range of common letters.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A is in the word but wrong position (–)\n- R is in the word but wrong position (–)\n- O is not in the word (x)\n- S is not in the word (x)\n- E is in the word but wrong position (–)\n\nSo we now know:\n- Letters NOT in the word: O, S\n- Letters that ARE in the word: A, R, E (but not in their original positions: A not in 1st, R not in 2nd, E not in 5th)\n\nWe need a new 5-letter word that:\n1.

Arranges A, R, E differently from their original positions (A not in 1st, R not in 2nd, E not in 5th)\n\nLet’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints. One systematic way is to pick a word that shifts A, R, E to new positions and fills the remaining two slots with new letters that haven’t been ruled out.\n\nA good candidate is “RANGE”:\n- Contains R, A, N, G, E\n- Doesn’t contain O or S\n- Positions: R is now in 1st (originally 2nd), A is in 2nd (originally 1st), E is in 5th (originally 5th – but this is the same position as E in AROSE, which violates the feedback that E was in the wrong position). So RANGE is invalid because E is still in the 5th spot.\n\nNext candidate: “REACT”\n- Contains R, E, A, C, T\n- Doesn’t contain O or S\n- Positions: R in 1st (originally 2nd), E in 2nd (originally 5th), A in 3rd (originally 1st) – this satisfies all constraints.\n\nLet’s verify:\n- A is in word, now in 3rd (was 1st) ✓\n- R is in word, now in 1st (was 2nd) ✓\n- E is in word, now in 2nd (was 5th) ✓\n- Doesn’t contain O or S ✓\n- New letters C and T haven’t been used yet ✓\n\nThus, “REACT” is a valid next guess.\n\n<guess>REACT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: REACT -> FEEDBACK: R(-) E(-) A(-) C(x) T(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two rounds of feedback we now know:\n\n1.

We now know the exact pattern of the secret word:

Positions:
1: unknown (must be a letter not yet ruled out)
2: A (✓)
3: T (✓)
4: E (✓)
5: R (✓)

Letters already confirmed in the word and in their correct spots: A, T, E, R.

Letters ruled out entirely (from any “x” feedback):
O, S, C, P, H, L

Therefore the first letter must be one of the remaining unused letters that are not in the forbidden set and not already used (A, T, E, R).  
Available letters (common ones first): B, D, F, G, I, K, M, N, U, V, W, Y, Z.

The only common English 5-letter word that fits the pattern “_ A T E R” is:

- BATER – not valid
- DATER – not valid
- FATER – not valid
- GATER – not valid
- MATER – valid (short for “mater”, also used in “tutor mater”)
- NATER – not valid
- VATER – not valid
- WATER – valid (the most common word)

Between the two valid candidates “MATER” and “WATER”, “WATER” is far more common and therefore the most likely secret word.

So the next (and likely final) guess is “WATER”.
