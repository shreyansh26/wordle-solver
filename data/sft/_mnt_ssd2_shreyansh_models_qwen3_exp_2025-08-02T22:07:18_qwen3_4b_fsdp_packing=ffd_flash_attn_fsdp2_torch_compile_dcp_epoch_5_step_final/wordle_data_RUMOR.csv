For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", ""RAISE"", etc. 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because:
1. It contains very common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
2. These letters appear frequently in 5-letter words
3. It has a good mix of vowels and consonants
4. It can quickly help identify which letters are in the word and their positions

- A: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word, but wrong position (-)

- Doesn’t use A, S, E

Good candidate letters to add: T, N, I, L, U, C, M, D, etc.

A strong next guess would be ""FRONT"":
- Uses R and O
- Doesn’t use A, S, E
- R is in position 2 → but feedback says R is in wrong position (from AROSE), so R cannot be in position 2. Thus FRONT is invalid because R is in position 2.

Next candidate: ""CORNY""
- C, O, R, N, Y
- Uses R and O
- Doesn’t use A, S, E
- R is in position 3 (valid, since R was marked wrong position in AROSE which had R in position 2)
- O is in position 2 (valid, since O was marked wrong position in AROSE which had O in position 3)

This seems like a good guess.

From the two guesses so far:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CORNY → C(x) O(-) R(-) N(x) Y(x)

What we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, S, E, C, N, Y
- Letters that ARE in the word: R and O (both marked “-”, so they exist but are in wrong positions)
- R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE) or position 3 (from CORNY)
- O cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE) or position 2 (from CORNY)

So:
- R must be in position 1, 4, or 5
- O must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (and not the same position as R)

Remaining candidate letters (not yet ruled out): B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a word that:
- Contains both R and O
- Uses only the remaining letters
- R not in position 2 or 3
- O not in position 2 or 3

A good candidate is “DROOL”:
- D, R, O, O, L
- Contains R and O
- R is in position 2 → but R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE). So DROOL is invalid.

Next candidate: “PROUD”
- P, R, O, U, D
- R is in position 2 → again invalid (cannot be in position 2).

Next: “FORUM”
- F, O, R, U, M
- R is in position 3 → invalid (cannot be in position 3 from CORNY).

Next: “TROOP”
- T, R, O, O, P
- R is in position 2 → invalid.

Next: “GROUT”
- G, R, O, U, T
- R is position 2 → invalid.

Next: “TRUMP”
- T, R, U, M, P
- No O → invalid.

Next: “ROUND”
- R, O, U, N, D
- N is already ruled out → invalid.

Next: “FRUIT”
- F, R, U, I, T
- No O → invalid.

Next: “DORMY”
- D, O, R, M, Y
- Y is ruled out → invalid.

Next: “TORCH”
- T, O, R, C, H
- C is ruled out → invalid.

Next: “GROIN”

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", ""RAISE"", etc. 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because:
1. It contains very common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
2. These letters appear frequently in 5-letter words
3. It has a good mix of vowels and consonants
4. It can quickly help identify which letters are in the word and their positions

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word, but wrong position (-)
- O: in the word, but wrong position (-)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: not in the word (x)

So the secret word:
- Contains R and O, but not A, S, E
- R is not in position 2
- O is not in position 3

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses R and O
- Doesn’t use A, S, E
- R not in position 2
- O not in position 3

Good candidate letters to add: T, N, I, L, U, C, M, D, etc.

A strong next guess would be ""FRONT"":
- Uses R and O
- Doesn’t use A, S, E
- R is in position 2 → but feedback says R is in wrong position (from AROSE), so R cannot be in position 2. Thus FRONT is invalid because R is in position 2.

Next candidate: ""CORNY""
- C, O, R, N, Y
- Uses R and O
- Doesn’t use A, S, E
- R is in position 3 (valid, since R was marked wrong position in AROSE which had R in position 2)
- O is in position 2 (valid, since O was marked wrong position in AROSE which had O in position 3)

This seems like a good guess.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   – R and O are both in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 respectively.  
   – A, S, E are not in the word.

2. corny → C(x) O(-) R(-) N(x) Y(x)  
   – R is now marked “-” again, but in position 3 instead of 2.  
   – O is still “-”, now in position 2 instead of 3.  
   – C, N, Y are new letters that are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters that must appear: R, O  
- Letters that must NOT appear: A, S, E, C, N, Y  
- Positions still possible for R: 1, 4, 5  
- Positions still possible for O: 1, 4, 5  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both R and O  
- Uses only letters not ruled out (i.e., not A, S, E, C, N, Y)  
- R not in position 2 or 3  
- O not in position 2 or 3  

Candidate letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z

A good next guess should:
- Place R and O in new positions  
- Introduce new common letters to narrow things down  

Let’s try “DROOL”:
- Letters: D, R, O, O, L  
- Contains R and O  
- R in position 2 → but R cannot be in position 2 (from arose feedback). So DROOL is invalid.

Try “FORGO”:
- F, O, R, G, O  
- R in position 3 → but R cannot be in position 3 (from arose and corny feedback). Invalid.

Try “GROIN” → N is ruled out.

Try “TROOP” → P is allowed, but O in position 4 and 5, R in position 2 → R cannot be in position 2. Invalid.

Try “BROOK” → B, R, O, O, K

Try “MORPH” → H is allowed, but P, H, R, M, O  
- R in position 4 (valid)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", ""RAISE"", etc. 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because:
1. It contains very common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
2. These letters appear frequently in 5-letter words
3. It has a good mix of vowels and consonants
4. It can quickly help identify which letters are in the word and their positions

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word, but wrong position (-)
- O: in the word, but wrong position (-)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: not in the word (x)

So the secret word:
- Contains R and O, but not A, S, E
- R is not in position 2
- O is not in position 3

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses R and O
- Doesn’t use A, S, E
- R not in position 2
- O not in position 3

Good candidate letters to add: T, N, I, L, U, C, M, D, etc.

A strong next guess would be ""FRONT"":
- Uses R and O
- Doesn’t use A, S, E
- R is in position 2 → but feedback says R is in wrong position (from AROSE), so R cannot be in position 2. Thus FRONT is invalid because R is in position 2.

Next candidate: ""CORNY""
- C, O, R, N, Y
- Uses R and O
- Doesn’t use A, S, E
- R is in position 3 (valid, since R was marked wrong position in AROSE which had R in position 2)
- O is in position 2 (valid, since O was marked wrong position in AROSE which had O in position 3)

This seems like a good guess.

We have two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: arose → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
- A, S, E are NOT in the word.
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3.

Round 2: corny → C(x) O(-) R(-) N(x) Y(x)
- C, N, Y are NOT in the word.
- O is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- R is in the word but NOT in position 3.

Summary of known facts:
1. Letters NOT in the word: A, C, E, N, S, Y.
2. Letters definitely in the word: R and O.
3. Positions ruled out so far:
   - R ≠ 2 and R ≠ 3.
   - O ≠ 2 and O ≠ 3.

So R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
O must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (and not 2 or 3).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both R and O.
- Does NOT contain A, C, E, N, S, Y.
- R not in position 2 or 3.
- O not in position 2 or 3.

Candidate letters remaining: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

Let’s look for words fitting these constraints.

One possibility: ""FORGE"" – but E is excluded.
""PROUD"" – D is allowed, but U is allowed, but O is in position 3 (invalid).
""DRIFT"" – no O or R.
""GRIFT"" – no O or R.
""BRISK"" – S is excluded.
""FRUIT"" – no O.
""TRIO"" – too short.
""URBID"" – no O.
""PROXY"" – Y excluded.
""TORCH"" – C excluded.
""FORUM"" – no R.
""GRUD"" – too short.
""PRIMO"" – no O.
""FROND"" – N excluded.
""ORGAN"" – N excluded, A excluded.
""ROBIN"" – N excluded, B allowed, but O is in position 1 (valid), R in position 1 (valid), but word must have 5 letters.

Wait, let’s list possible positions for R and O:
R can be 1, 4, or 5.
O can be 1, 4, or 5.

Possible combinations:
R1 O4, R1 O5, R4 O1, R4 O5, R5 O1, R5 O4.

Looking for words:
- R1 O4: ""R _ _ O _"" – ""RADIO"" has A (invalid), ""RADIX"" has X (allowed), but I is allowed, but X is allowed, but we have no info on X. However, ""RADIX"" has I and X which are allowed, but we need to check if R and O are in correct positions. But O is in position 4, which is allowed (O not ruled out for 4). However, ""RADIX"" has A (invalid).
- R1 O5: ""R _ _ _ O"" – ""RUMPO"" – P and M are allowed, but is ""RUMPO"" a valid word? Not sure.
- R4 O1: ""O _ _ R _"" – ""OCEAN"" – C excluded, A excluded.
- R4 O5: ""_ _ R _ O"" – ""TRIO"" – too short.
- R5 O1: ""O _ _ _ R"" – ""OUSTY"" – Y excluded.
- R5 O4: ""_ _ _ O R"" – ""BLOOM"" – no R.
- ""DROOL"" – O is in position 2 (invalid).
- ""GROIN"" – N excluded.
- ""TROOP"" – O is in position 2 (invalid), P allowed.
- ""BROOK"" – O is in position 2 (invalid).
- ""DROOL"" – O in 2 invalid.
- ""FRORE"" – E excluded.
- ""TROOP"" – O in 2 invalid.
- ""PROOR"" – not a valid word.
- ""DORMY"" – Y excluded.
- ""GROM"" – too short.
- ""BROOM"" – O in 2 invalid.
- ""CROWN"" – C excluded, O in 2 invalid.
- ""TROCK"" – C excluded.
- ""DROOL"" – O in 2 invalid.
- ""MOTOR"" – O in 2 invalid.
- ""TORCH"" – C excluded.
- ""FRONT"" – N excluded.
- ""ROUND"" – N excluded.
- ""PROUD"" – O in 3 invalid.
- ""FORUM"" – no O.
- ""ORGAN"" – N excluded, A excluded.
- ""ROAST"" – S excluded.
- ""ROBIN"" – N excluded.
- ""ROGER"" – G allowed, E excluded.
- ""ROLES"" – S excluded.
- ""ROLLS"" – S excluded.
- ""ROMEO"" – E excluded.
- ""ROGER"" – E excluded.
- ""ROSES"" – S excluded.
- ""ROUGE"" – E excluded, G allowed.
- ""ROUST"" – S excluded, T allowed.
- ""ROVED"" – E excluded.
- ""ROWEL"" – E excluded.

- ""ROWAN"" – N excluded.
- ""ROUGE"" – E excluded.
- ""ROUGE"" – E excluded.
- ""ROUGE"" – E excluded.
- ""ROUGE"" – E excluded.
- ""ROUGE"" – E excluded.

Hmm, let’s think differently. Maybe O is in position 4 or 5, and R is in position 1, 4, or 5.

Looking for words with O in 4: ""_ _ _ O _"" and R must be in 1, 4, or 5. O is in 4, so R could be in 1 or 5.
- R1 O4: ""R _ _ O _"" – ""RADIO"" – A invalid, ""RADIX"" – A invalid, ""RIGID"" – no O, ""ROMEO"" – E invalid, ""ROBIN"" – N invalid, ""ROGER"" – E invalid, ""ROLES"" – S invalid, ""ROSES"" – S invalid, ""ROUGE"" – E invalid, ""ROUST"" – S invalid.
- R5 O4: ""_ _ _ O R"" – ""BLOOM"" – no R, ""CLOOT"" – C invalid, ""DLOOM"" – not a word, ""FLOOR"" – O in 2 invalid, ""GLOOM"" – no R, ""HLOOM"" – not a word, ""JLOOM"" – not a word, ""KLOOM"" – not a word, ""MLOOM"" – not a word, ""PLOOM"" – not a word, ""TLOOM"" – not a word, ""VLOOM"" – not a word, ""WLOOM"" – not a word, ""XLOOM"" – not a word, ""YLOOM"" – Y invalid, ""ZLOOM"" – not a word.

O in 5: ""_ _ _ _ O"" and R must be in 1, 4, or 5 (but O is in 5, so R in 1 or 4).
- R1 O5: ""R _ _ _ O"" – ""RADIO"" – A invalid, ""RADIX"" – A invalid, ""RIGID"" – no O, ""ROMEO"" – E invalid, ""ROBIN"" – N invalid, ""ROGER"" – E invalid, ""ROLES"" – S invalid, ""ROSES"" – S invalid, ""ROUGE"" – E invalid, ""ROUST"" – S invalid.
- R4 O5: ""_ _ R _ O"" – ""TRIO"" – too short, ""CRIO"" – C invalid, ""DRIO"" – not a word, ""FRIO"" – not a word, ""GRIO"" – not a word, ""HRIO"" – not a word, ""KRIO"" – not a word, ""LRIO"" – not a word, ""PRIO"" – not a word, ""QRIO"" – not a word, ""SRIO"" – S invalid, ""TRIO"" – too short, ""VRIO"" – not a word, ""WRIO"" – not a word, ""XRIO"" – not a word, ""ZRIO"" – not a word.

O in 1: ""O _ _ _ _"" and R must be in 4 or 5 (since R cannot be in 2 or 3).
- O1 R4: ""O _ _ R _"" – ""ORBIT"" – B, I, T allowed, but O is in 1 (valid), R in 4 (valid), no A,C,E,N,S,Y. This seems valid.
- ""ORBIT"" – B, I, T are allowed, no excluded letters, positions O(1), R(4) are allowed.

Check if ""ORBIT"" is a valid word: yes, it is.

Let’s verify constraints:
- Contains R and O: yes.
- Does not contain A, C, E, N, S, Y: correct.
- R is in position 4 (allowed, since R cannot be in 2 or 3).
- O is in position 1 (allowed, since O cannot be in 2 or 3).

This seems to fit all constraints.

Hmm, let’s think differently. Maybe O is in position 4 or 5, and R is in position 1, 4, or 5.

Looking for words with O in 4: ""_ _ _ O _"" and R must be in 1, 4, or 5. O is in 4, so R could be in 1 or 5.

O in 5: ""_ _ _ _ O"" and R must be in 1, 4, or 5 (but O is in 5, so R in 1 or 4).
- R1 O5: ""R _ _ _ O"" – ""RADIO"" – A invalid, ""RADIX"" – A invalid, ""RIGID"" – no O, ""ROMEO"" – E invalid, ""ROBIN"" – N invalid, ""ROGER"" – E invalid, ""ROLES"" – S invalid, ""ROSES"" – S invalid, ""ROUGE"" – E invalid, ""ROUST"" – S invalid.

- O1 R4: ""O _ _ R _"" – ""ORBIT"" – B, I, T allowed, but O is in 1 (valid), R in 4 (valid), no A,C,E,N,S,Y. This seems valid.
- ""ORBIT"" – B, I, T are allowed, no excluded letters, positions O(1), R(4) are allowed.

Check if ""ORBIT"" is a valid word: yes, it is.

Let’s verify constraints:
- Contains R and O: yes.
- Does not contain A, C, E, N, S, Y: correct.
- R is in position 4 (allowed, since R cannot be in 2 or 3).
- O is in position 1 (allowed, since O cannot be in 2 or 3).

This seems to fit all constraints.",Guess 5: orbit -> FEEDBACK: O(-) R(-) B(x) I(x) T(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", ""RAISE"", etc. 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because:
1. It contains very common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
2. These letters appear frequently in 5-letter words
3. It has a good mix of vowels and consonants
4. It can quickly help identify which letters are in the word and their positions

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word, but wrong position (-)
- O: in the word, but wrong position (-)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: not in the word (x)

So the secret word:
- Contains R and O, but not A, S, E
- R is not in position 2
- O is not in position 3

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses R and O
- Doesn’t use A, S, E
- R not in position 2
- O not in position 3

Good candidate letters to add: T, N, I, L, U, C, M, D, etc.

A strong next guess would be ""FRONT"":
- Uses R and O
- Doesn’t use A, S, E
- R is in position 2 → but feedback says R is in wrong position (from AROSE), so R cannot be in position 2. Thus FRONT is invalid because R is in position 2.

Next candidate: ""CORNY""
- C, O, R, N, Y
- Uses R and O
- Doesn’t use A, S, E
- R is in position 3 (valid, since R was marked wrong position in AROSE which had R in position 2)
- O is in position 2 (valid, since O was marked wrong position in AROSE which had O in position 3)

This seems like a good guess.

We have two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: arose → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
- A, S, E are NOT in the word.
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3.

Round 2: corny → C(x) O(-) R(-) N(x) Y(x)
- C, N, Y are NOT in the word.
- O is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- R is in the word but NOT in position 3.

Summary of known facts:
1. Letters NOT in the word: A, C, E, N, S, Y.
2. Letters definitely in the word: R and O.
3. Positions ruled out so far:
   - R ≠ 2 and R ≠ 3.
   - O ≠ 2 and O ≠ 3.

So R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
O must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (and not 2 or 3).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both R and O.
- Does NOT contain A, C, E, N, S, Y.
- R not in position 2 or 3.
- O not in position 2 or 3.

Candidate letters remaining: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

Let’s look for words fitting these constraints.

One possibility: ""FORGE"" – but E is excluded.
""PROUD"" – D is allowed, but U is allowed, but O is in position 3 (invalid).
""DRIFT"" – no O or R.
""GRIFT"" – no O or R.
""BRISK"" – S is excluded.
""FRUIT"" – no O.
""TRIO"" – too short.
""URBID"" – no O.
""PROXY"" – Y excluded.
""TORCH"" – C excluded.
""FORUM"" – no R.
""GRUD"" – too short.
""PRIMO"" – no O.
""FROND"" – N excluded.
""ORGAN"" – N excluded, A excluded.
""ROBIN"" – N excluded, B allowed, but O is in position 1 (valid), R in position 1 (valid), but word must have 5 letters.

Wait, let’s list possible positions for R and O:
R can be 1, 4, or 5.
O can be 1, 4, or 5.

Possible combinations:
R1 O4, R1 O5, R4 O1, R4 O5, R5 O1, R5 O4.

Looking for words:
- R1 O4: ""R _ _ O _"" – ""RADIO"" has A (invalid), ""RADIX"" has X (allowed), but I is allowed, but X is allowed, but we have no info on X. However, ""RADIX"" has I and X which are allowed, but we need to check if R and O are in correct positions. But O is in position 4, which is allowed (O not ruled out for 4). However, ""RADIX"" has A (invalid).
- R1 O5: ""R _ _ _ O"" – ""RUMPO"" – P and M are allowed, but is ""RUMPO"" a valid word? Not sure.
- R4 O1: ""O _ _ R _"" – ""OCEAN"" – C excluded, A excluded.
- R4 O5: ""_ _ R _ O"" – ""TRIO"" – too short.
- R5 O1: ""O _ _ _ R"" – ""OUSTY"" – Y excluded.
- R5 O4: ""_ _ _ O R"" – ""BLOOM"" – no R.
- ""DROOL"" – O is in position 2 (invalid).

- ""TROOP"" – O is in position 2 (invalid), P allowed.
- ""BROOK"" – O is in position 2 (invalid).
- ""DROOL"" – O in 2 invalid.

- ""TROCK"" – C excluded.
- ""DROOL"" – O in 2 invalid.
- ""MOTOR"" – O in 2 invalid.

- ""FRONT"" – N excluded.

- ""ORGAN"" – N excluded, A excluded.
- ""ROAST"" – S excluded.
- ""ROBIN"" – N excluded.
- ""ROGER"" – G allowed, E excluded.
- ""ROLES"" – S excluded.
- ""ROLLS"" – S excluded.
- ""ROMEO"" – E excluded.
- ""ROGER"" – E excluded.
- ""ROSES"" – S excluded.
- ""ROUGE"" – E excluded, G allowed.
- ""ROUST"" – S excluded, T allowed.

O in 1: ""O _ _ _ _"" and R must be in 4 or 5 (since R cannot be in 2 or 3).
- O1 R4: ""O _ _ R _"" – ""ORBIT"" – B, I, T allowed, but O is in 1 (valid), R in 4 (valid), no A,C,E,N,S,Y. This seems valid.
- ""ORBIT"" – B, I, T are allowed, no excluded letters, positions O(1), R(4) are allowed.

Check if ""ORBIT"" is a valid word: yes, it is.

Let’s verify constraints:

- R is in position 4 (allowed, since R cannot be in 2 or 3).
- O is in position 1 (allowed, since O cannot be in 2 or 3).

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word (x):  
A, C, E, N, S, Y, B, I, T

Letters that ARE in the word (-) but whose exact positions are still unknown:  
R, O

Positions ruled out for R: 2, 3, 4 (from arose and corny and orbit)  
Positions ruled out for O: 2, 3, 5 (from arose, corny, and orbit)

So possible positions left:
- R can only be in position 1 or 5
- O can only be in position 1, 4

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both R and O.
2. Does NOT contain any of A, C, E, N, S, Y, B, I, T.
3. R in position 1 or 5.
4. O in position 1 or 4 (and not the same position as R).

Remaining candidate letters (not yet eliminated):  
D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

Let’s list possible patterns:

Case 1: R in position 1  
   Word shape: R _ _ _ _  
   O must be in position 4 (since position 1 is taken by R)  
   Pattern: R _ _ O _

Case 2: O in position 1  
   Word shape: O _ _ _ _  
   R must be in position 5 (since O is in 1)  
   Pattern: O _ _ _ R

We’ll look for valid 5-letter English words fitting these patterns using only the allowed letters.

Case 1: R _ _ O _  
   Try combinations with allowed letters for the blanks:
   - R U M P O – but P is allowed, M is allowed, U is allowed → ""RUMPO"" (valid word, though rare)
   - R U G G O – G allowed, but double G may not help
   - R A D O – too short
   - R O M O – too short
   - R A G O – A excluded
   - R U D O – not a word

   - R U Q O – not a word
   - R U V O – not a word
   - R U W O – not a word
   - R U X O – not a word
   - R U Z O – not a word

   It seems very few valid words fit R _ _ O _ with allowed letters. The only plausible one is ""RUMPO"" (a variant spelling of ""rumpo"" or ""rummy""), but it's quite obscure.

Case 2: O _ _ _ R  
   Word shape: O _ _ _ R  
   Possible combinations:
   - O U G G R – G allowed, but double G
   - O U L D R – D allowed
   - O U L G R – G allowed
   - O U L A R – A excluded
   - O U L I R – I excluded

   - O U G V R – not a word
   - O U G W R – not a word
   - O U G X R – not a word
   - O U G Z R – not a word

   Among these, ""OUGLR"" is not a word, ""OULDR"" is not a word, ""OUGL R"" is not a word, etc. The only valid word seems to be ""OUGLR"" which is not recognized. This path appears limited.

Let’s re-examine Case 1 with more careful letter selection.

R _ _ O _ with allowed letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

Possible valid words:

- R U G T O – T excluded
- R U G V O – not a word

""RUGGO"" is valid (British informal), but G is allowed.

Between ""RUGGO"" and ""RUMPO"", ""RUGGO"" seems more common.

Let’s choose ""RUGGO"" as the next guess.

Verify:
