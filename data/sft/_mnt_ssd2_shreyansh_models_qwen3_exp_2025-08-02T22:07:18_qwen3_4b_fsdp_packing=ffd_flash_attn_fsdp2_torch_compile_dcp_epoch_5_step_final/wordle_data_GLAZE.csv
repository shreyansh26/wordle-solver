### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. A commonly recommended starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (very common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of frequent letters in English words and should provide helpful feedback for narrowing down possibilities.

- A(✓) – A is in the word and in the 3rd position.
- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in the 5th position.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ L A _ E
- Letters not in the word: S, T
- Still need to determine positions 1 and 4.

Good letters to try next (common ones not yet ruled out): R, N, C, H, M, D, G, B, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep L, A, E in their correct positions.
2. Introduce new common consonants for positions 1 and 4.
3. Avoid S and T.

A strong candidate is ""CLAVE"":
- C (new consonant for position 1)
- L (correct, stays)
- A (correct, stays)
- V (new consonant for position 4)
- E (correct, stays)

This tests two new common letters (C and V) while respecting the known pattern and forbidden letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. A commonly recommended starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (very common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of frequent letters in English words and should provide helpful feedback for narrowing down possibilities.

Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- L(✓) – L is in the word and in the 2nd position.
- A(✓) – A is in the word and in the 3rd position.
- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in the 5th position.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ L A _ E
- Letters not in the word: S, T
- Still need to determine positions 1 and 4.

Good letters to try next (common ones not yet ruled out): R, N, C, H, M, D, G, B, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep L, A, E in their correct positions.
2. Introduce new common consonants for positions 1 and 4.
3. Avoid S and T.

A strong candidate is ""CLAVE"":
- C (new consonant for position 1)
- L (correct, stays)

- V (new consonant for position 4)

From the latest feedback:

- G(✓) – G is in the word and in position 1.
- L(✓) – L is in the word and in position 2 (already known).
- A(✓) – A is in the word and in position 3 (already known).
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in position 5 (already known).

So the pattern is now fully determined:

G L A _ E

We only need to find the missing fourth letter.  
Letters already ruled out: S, T, C, V, F, M, B, D, R  
Letters still possible: N, H, K, W, P, Y, etc.

Common 5-letter words that fit G L A _ E:
- GLANE (not valid)
- GLADE (valid)
- GLAZE (valid)
- GLAIE (valid, but rare)
- GLAPE (not valid)

The most common and likely valid word is ""GLADE"".

Let's check if any other letters are ruled out for position 4:
- D was already ruled out (from BLADE feedback).
- So position 4 cannot be D, R, S, T, C, V, F, M, B, etc.

Hence, ""GLADE"" is the only plausible common word left.
