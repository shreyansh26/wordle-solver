For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting letters include S, T, R, N, L, and vowels like A, E, I, O, U. A good starting word should cover a mix of consonants and vowels. 

Some popular starting words are:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)
- RAISE (covers R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it's very common and covers several frequent letters (S, L, A, T, E).

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the word is of the form L _ _ _ _
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so E appears somewhere else in the word, not in position 5.

So we now know:
- L is fixed in position 1.
- E is somewhere in positions 2-4 or 5 (but not position 5, so positions 2-4).
- No S, A, or T.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with L, contains E (but not in the last position), and does not contain S, A, or T.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus E.

Let’s brainstorm words starting with L and containing E in positions 2-4:
- L E G O N
- L E G O M
- L E G U E (but has E in position 5, which is invalid)
- L E G A N (contains A, invalid)
- L E G I N
- L E G O N
- L E M E N (invalid, E in position 4 is fine)
- L E M O N
- L I N E R (invalid, E in position 4 is fine)
- L I V E N (invalid, E in position 4 is fine)
- L I V E R (invalid, E in position 4 is fine)
- L I N E R (invalid, E in position 4 is fine)
- L I N E D (invalid, E in position 4 is fine)
- L I N E R (invalid, E in position 4 is fine)

Looking at these, ""L E G O N"" seems valid, but let me check if it's a real word. ""LEGON"" isn't a standard English word. ""L E M O N"" is valid, but let me see if it fits all criteria:
- L E M O N: starts with L, has E in position 2, no S, A, T. This seems valid.

Another option: ""L I V E R"" – but this has E in position 4, which is allowed.

Let me choose ""L I V E R"" as it's a common word and fits all constraints.

Wait, let me double-check:
- L is in position 1 (✓ from feedback)
- E is in position 3 (allowed, not position 5)
- No S, A, T
- Valid English word ""LIVER""

This seems optimal.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word is 5 letters long.
2. Position 1: L was marked “-” in LIVER, so L is in the word but NOT in position 1.
3. Position 5: E was marked “✓”, so E is in position 5.
4. I and V are NOT in the word (x in LIVER).
5. From SLATE we also know S, A, T are NOT in the word.
6. R was marked “✓” in LIVER, so R is in position 5? Wait, no: the feedback for LIVER was L(-) I(x) V(x) E(✓) R(✓). That means:
   - E is in position 4 (because E(✓) in LIVER means E is in the word and in the correct position, which is position 4).
   - R is in position 5 (because R(✓) in LIVER means R is in the word and in the correct position, which is position 5).
   - L is in the word but not in position 1 (L(-)).
   - I and V are not in the word (I(x), V(x)).
   - From SLATE: S(x), A(x), T(x) are not in the word.

So far:
- Position 1: must be a letter that is in the word but not L (since L is in the word but not in position 1). Possible letters to consider (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.
- Position 2: unknown.
- Position 3: unknown.
- Position 4: E (fixed).
- Position 5: R (fixed).

We also know L must appear somewhere in positions 2-3 (since it can’t be in 1, 4, or 5 because 4 and 5 are taken by E and R).

So the word has the pattern: _ _ L E R or _ L E R _ (but position 5 is R, so it must be _ _ L E R).

Wait, position 5 is R, position 4 is E, and L must be in the word but not in position 1. So L must be in position 2 or 3.

Thus possible patterns:
- _ L E R _
- _ _ L E R

But position 5 is R, so the second pattern would be _ _ L E R, but then where is the L? It would have to be in position 2 or 3.

Let me re-express:
The word must contain L, E, R in positions:
- E is in position 4 (from E(✓) in LIVER)
- R is in position 5 (from R(✓) in LIVER)
- L is in the word but not position 1 (from L(-) in LIVER)

Thus the word must be of the form:
[?] [L or not] [?] E R
with L appearing somewhere in positions 2 or 3.

So possible forms:
- ? L ? E R
- ? ? L E R

Letters already ruled out: S, A, T, I, V.

Let me think of common words that fit these patterns with the remaining letters.

For ? L ? E R:
- B L E E R (but has E in position 3, which is allowed, but is BLEEPER a word? No, that's two E's)
- C L E E R (CLEER is a valid word, but again two E's)
- F L E E R (FLEER is valid)
- G L E E R (GLEER is not standard)
- P L E E R (PLEER is not standard)
- D L E E R (DLEER is not standard)

For ? ? L E R:
- B E L E R (BELER is not standard)
- C E L E R (CELER is not standard)
- F E L E R (FELER is not standard)
- M E L E R (MELER is not standard)
- N E L E R (NELER is not standard)
- B O L E R (BOLER is not standard)
- C O L E R (COLOR is not matching, but COOLER has O and C)
- C H L E R (CHLER is not standard)
- F R L E R (invalid)
- M O L E R (MOLER is not standard)
- P O L E R (POKER is not matching, but POLER is valid)

Looking at these, ""FLEER"" (F L E E R) is valid, but has two E's. ""CLEER"" has two E's. ""PLEER"" is not valid. ""BOLER"" is not valid. ""COOLER"" has O and C but is 6 letters. ""POLER"" is valid (P O L E R), but has O which we haven't ruled out.

""POLER"" fits:
- P: not ruled out
- O: not ruled out
- L: must be in word (and not in position 1), here L is in position 3 (valid)
- E: position 4 (matches)
- R: position 5 (matches)

No letters in POLER are ruled out except none of the ruled-out letters (S,A,T,I,V) are present.

Let me check if POLER is a valid word: yes, a poler is someone who polishes shoes.

Another candidate: ""FLEER"" (F L E E R) – but has two E's. ""CLEER"" – same issue.

""ELDER"" – but has D and E in positions 2 and 4, but R is position 5, E is position 4, so would be E L D E R – but this has:
- E in position 1 (not yet ruled out)
- L in position 2 (valid, since L can't be in position 1)
- D: not ruled out
- E in position 4 (matches)
- R in position 5 (matches)

But ELDER is a valid word and fits all constraints:
- E is in position 1 (allowed)
- L is in position 2 (allowed, since L can't be in position 1)
- D: new letter, not ruled out
- E in 4 (matches)
- R in 5 (matches)

This seems better as it uses only one E (position 1) and the known E in position 4, with L in position 2.

Let me verify:
- ELDER: E L D E R
- L is in position 2 (allowed, since L is in word but not position 1)
- E is in position 1 (not yet ruled out)
- D is new
- E in 4 (matches)
- R in 5 (matches)

This seems optimal.

Another candidate: ""BLDER"" – but not a word. ""CLDER"" – no. ""FLDER"" – no.

Thus, the most promising valid word fitting all constraints is ""ELDER"".
</think>

Based on the feedback:
- E is in position 4
- R is in position 5
- L is in the word but not position 1
- Letters ruled out: S, A, T, I, V

The word must be of the form _ L _ E R or _ _ L E R, but since L must appear and can't be in position 1, the only valid common word fitting these constraints is:

<guess>ELDER</guess>",ELDER,"From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word is 5 letters long.
2. Position 1: L was marked “-” in LIVER, so L is in the word but NOT in position 1.
3. Position 5: E was marked “✓”, so E is in position 5.
4. I and V are NOT in the word (x in LIVER).
5. From SLATE we also know S, A, T are NOT in the word.
6. R was marked “✓” in LIVER, so R is in position 5? Wait, no: the feedback for LIVER was L(-) I(x) V(x) E(✓) R(✓). That means:
   - E is in position 4 (because E(✓) in LIVER means E is in the word and in the correct position, which is position 4).
   - R is in position 5 (because R(✓) in LIVER means R is in the word and in the correct position, which is position 5).
   - L is in the word but not in position 1 (L(-)).
   - I and V are not in the word (I(x), V(x)).
   - From SLATE: S(x), A(x), T(x) are not in the word.

So far:
- Position 1: must be a letter that is in the word but not L (since L is in the word but not in position 1). Possible letters to consider (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.
- Position 2: unknown.
- Position 3: unknown.
- Position 4: E (fixed).
- Position 5: R (fixed).

We also know L must appear somewhere in positions 2-3 (since it can’t be in 1, 4, or 5 because 4 and 5 are taken by E and R).

So the word has the pattern: _ _ L E R or _ L E R _ (but position 5 is R, so it must be _ _ L E R).

Wait, position 5 is R, position 4 is E, and L must be in the word but not in position 1. So L must be in position 2 or 3.

Thus possible patterns:
- _ L E R _
- _ _ L E R

But position 5 is R, so the second pattern would be _ _ L E R, but then where is the L? It would have to be in position 2 or 3.

Let me re-express:
The word must contain L, E, R in positions:
- E is in position 4 (from E(✓) in LIVER)
- R is in position 5 (from R(✓) in LIVER)
- L is in the word but not position 1 (from L(-) in LIVER)

Thus the word must be of the form:
[?] [L or not] [?] E R
with L appearing somewhere in positions 2 or 3.

So possible forms:
- ? L ? E R
- ? ? L E R

Letters already ruled out: S, A, T, I, V.

Let me think of common words that fit these patterns with the remaining letters.

For ? L ? E R:
- B L E E R (but has E in position 3, which is allowed, but is BLEEPER a word? No, that's two E's)
- C L E E R (CLEER is a valid word, but again two E's)
- F L E E R (FLEER is valid)
- G L E E R (GLEER is not standard)
- P L E E R (PLEER is not standard)
- D L E E R (DLEER is not standard)

For ? ? L E R:
- B E L E R (BELER is not standard)
- C E L E R (CELER is not standard)
- F E L E R (FELER is not standard)
- M E L E R (MELER is not standard)
- N E L E R (NELER is not standard)
- B O L E R (BOLER is not standard)
- C O L E R (COLOR is not matching, but COOLER has O and C)
- C H L E R (CHLER is not standard)
- F R L E R (invalid)
- M O L E R (MOLER is not standard)
- P O L E R (POKER is not matching, but POLER is valid)

Looking at these, ""FLEER"" (F L E E R) is valid, but has two E's. ""CLEER"" has two E's. ""PLEER"" is not valid. ""BOLER"" is not valid. ""COOLER"" has O and C but is 6 letters. ""POLER"" is valid (P O L E R), but has O which we haven't ruled out.

""POLER"" fits:
- P: not ruled out
- O: not ruled out
- L: must be in word (and not in position 1), here L is in position 3 (valid)
- E: position 4 (matches)
- R: position 5 (matches)

No letters in POLER are ruled out except none of the ruled-out letters (S,A,T,I,V) are present.

Let me check if POLER is a valid word: yes, a poler is someone who polishes shoes.

Another candidate: ""FLEER"" (F L E E R) – but has two E's. ""CLEER"" – same issue.

""ELDER"" – but has D and E in positions 2 and 4, but R is position 5, E is position 4, so would be E L D E R – but this has:
- E in position 1 (not yet ruled out)
- L in position 2 (valid, since L can't be in position 1)
- D: not ruled out
- E in position 4 (matches)
- R in position 5 (matches)

But ELDER is a valid word and fits all constraints:
- E is in position 1 (allowed)
- L is in position 2 (allowed, since L can't be in position 1)
- D: new letter, not ruled out
- E in 4 (matches)
- R in 5 (matches)

This seems better as it uses only one E (position 1) and the known E in position 4, with L in position 2.

Let me verify:
- ELDER: E L D E R
- L is in position 2 (allowed, since L is in word but not position 1)
- E is in position 1 (not yet ruled out)
- D is new
- E in 4 (matches)
- R in 5 (matches)

This seems optimal.

Another candidate: ""BLDER"" – but not a word. ""CLDER"" – no. ""FLDER"" – no.

Thus, the most promising valid word fitting all constraints is ""ELDER"".Based on the feedback:
- E is in position 4
- R is in position 5
- L is in the word but not position 1
- Letters ruled out: S, A, T, I, V

The word must be of the form _ L _ E R or _ _ L E R, but since L must appear and can't be in position 1, the only valid common word fitting these constraints is:",Guess 3: ELDER -> FEEDBACK: E(✓) L(✓) D(✓) E(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
