### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and avoids repeating any letters. This gives us maximum coverage of common letters to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E), but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better letter coverage according to frequency analysis.

So, my first guess will be ""AROSE"".

- Contains both R and E (but R not in position 2 and E not in position 5)
- Does NOT contain A, O, S
- Uses only remaining common letters to maximize information.

Remaining common letters to consider: T, I, N, L, U, C, Y, D, M, P, etc.

Let’s pick a word that places R and E in new positions while introducing new common letters. A good candidate is ""TREND"":
- T (new letter)
- R (must not be in position 2; here it’s in position 2, which is invalid)
Oops, that’s no good. Let’s try ""URINE"":
- U (new letter)
- R (position 2 is invalid)
Still no. How about ""RINSE"":
- R in position 1 (valid)
- I (new letter)
- N (new letter)
- S is invalid (already eliminated)
No. Try ""ENTRY"":
- E in position 1 (valid)
- N (new letter)
- T (new letter)
- R (position 4, valid)
- Y (new letter)
This looks good: contains R and E, avoids A, O, S, and introduces new common letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: ENTRY -> FEEDBACK: E(-) N(x) T(x) R(✓) Y(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on ENTRY:
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 1.
- N(x) → N is not in the word.
- T(x) → T is not in the word.
- R(✓) → R is in the word and is in position 4.
- Y(✓) → Y is in the word and is in position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S, N, T
- Letters definitely in the word and their positions:
  - R is in position 4
  - Y is in position 5
- E is in the word but not in positions 1 or 5 (since it was in position 1 in ENTRY and position 5 in AROSE, both now ruled out). So E must be in positions 2, 3, or 4. But position 4 is already taken by R, so E must be in position 2 or 3.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has R in position 4
- Has Y in position 5
- Contains E in position 2 or 3
- Does not contain A, O, S, N, T
- Uses only remaining common letters.

Possible patterns:
- _ E _ R Y (E in position 2)
- _ _ E R Y (E in position 3)

Let’s try _ E _ R Y first. Common letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z.

A good candidate is ""BERGY"" but B and G are possible, but ""PERKY"" uses P and K. However, P and K are less common. Let’s try ""CERFY"" – no, F is possible but Y is already used. Wait, we need to avoid repeating letters already ruled out.

Actually, we can use any letters not yet ruled out. Let’s try ""CERFY"" – but F is allowed. But this seems less common.

Better to try _ _ E R Y. Common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z.

A good candidate is ""FIERY"" – but I is allowed, E is in position 3. This uses F, I, E, R, Y. All letters are allowed so far.

""FIERY"" is a valid word meaning ""full of fire"" or ""passionate"".

Let’s check:
- F: new letter
- I: new letter
- E: must be in word, and position 3 is allowed
- R: must be in position 4 – correct here
- Y: must be in position 5 – correct here

This seems like a good guess.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and avoids repeating any letters. This gives us maximum coverage of common letters to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E), but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better letter coverage according to frequency analysis.

So, my first guess will be ""AROSE"".

From the feedback on AROSE:

- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S
- Letters definitely in the word but whose positions are unknown: R, E
- Other letters are still possible.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both R and E (but R not in position 2 and E not in position 5)
- Does NOT contain A, O, S
- Uses only remaining common letters to maximize information.

From the new feedback on FEWER:

- F(✓) – correct in position 1  
- E(✓) – correct in position 2  
- W(x) – W is NOT in the word  
- E(-) – there is another E, but it cannot be in position 4 (because that’s where the second E would land here and we already know E is fixed in position 2).  
- R(-) – R is in the word but NOT in position 5 (it was already confirmed in position 4 from ENTRY and FIERY, so this just re-affirms R is in position 4).

Current known pattern:  
F E _ R Y  

The only remaining unknown is the third letter.  
Letters already ruled out: A, O, S, N, T, I, W.  
Letters still allowed in position 3: B, C, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, X, Z.  

The only common English word that fits F E _ R Y is F E R R Y.  
Check each letter:  
F, E, R, R, Y – none of these have been ruled out, and the double R is acceptable.  

Therefore, the word must be FERRY.
