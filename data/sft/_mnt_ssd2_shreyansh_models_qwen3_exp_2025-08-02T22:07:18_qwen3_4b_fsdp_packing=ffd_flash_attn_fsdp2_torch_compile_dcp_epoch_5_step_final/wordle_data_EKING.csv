### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives me good coverage to test multiple letters at once and gather useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are **not** in the word at all (all marked x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (marked -).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E.
- Does **not** contain A, R, O, S.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Has E somewhere (but not in position 5).
- Avoids A, R, O, S entirely.

A good next guess should test new common consonants and vowels. The word ""UNTIE"" comes to mind:
- It has E in position 4 (a new position for E).
- It introduces the consonants N, T, I and the vowel U.
- It avoids A, R, O, S.

This should give me more information about which of these new letters are present and their correct positions.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)  
   – Letters **not** in the word: A, R, O, S  
   – Letter **in** the word but in the wrong position: E

2. UNTIE → U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) E(-)  
   – Letters **not** in the word: U, T  
   – Letters **in** the word but in the wrong position: N, I, E

So the secret word:
- Contains the letters E, N, I (each only once so far).  
- Does **not** contain A, R, O, S, U, T.

We still need to place E, N, I correctly and discover the remaining two letters.  
A good next guess should:
- Use only the allowed letters.  
- Try to place E, N, I in new positions.  
- Introduce two new consonants that are common and haven’t been ruled out yet.

The word “INFER” is invalid because F and R have already been ruled out.  
The word “INLET” is invalid because T has been ruled out.  
The word “INDEX” is invalid because X and D haven’t been tested yet, but E is already known and N and I are in the word, so let’s check:  
– Letters: I, N, D, E, X.  
– Ruled-out letters: A, R, O, S, U, T.  
– D and X haven’t been ruled out yet.  
– Positions for E, N, I: E is in position 4 (new), N in 2 (new), I in 1 (new).  
So “INDEX” is valid and informative.

Another candidate is “INDEC” (but C hasn’t been tested either).  
“INDEX” seems slightly better because X is a common enough consonant and D is also common.

Let’s summarize what we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word (x-feedback so far):
A, R, O, S, U, T, D, X

Letters that ARE in the word but whose correct positions we still don’t know:
E, N, I

So the secret word is a permutation of E, N, I plus two letters that have not yet been ruled out and are not among the above list.

Common remaining consonants not yet tested: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Common remaining vowels not yet tested: none, since A, E, I, O, U have all been tested (even E was only “in but wrong place”).

We need two additional letters from the still-allowed set.  Common, high-frequency bigrams or letter combinations suggest we might try words like:

- “BEGIN” – but G and B are still allowed, and we already know E and N are in the word.  However, we already tried “BEGIN” implicitly (as part of “INDEX” and earlier guesses), but since we haven’t seen feedback on B or G yet, this could be useful.  But we already have I and N in the word, and we need to place them.

Wait, we have three letters (E, N, I) that must appear, and two more letters to fill the 5-letter word.  The simplest approach is to pick a word that contains E, N, I plus two new letters that haven’t been ruled out yet.

Let’s pick a word that uses high-frequency remaining letters.  Common remaining high-frequency letters: L, C, G, B, M, P, etc.

A good candidate is “CLINE”:
- Letters: C, L, I, N, E
- All letters are either known to be in the word (I, N, E) or newly introduced (C, L) and not yet ruled out.
- This also gives us a new position for E (position 5), N (position 4), I (position 3), which could help us confirm placements.

Another candidate is “BLINE” or “GIMME”, but “CLINE” seems balanced.

Therefore, I’ll guess “CLINE”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives me good coverage to test multiple letters at once and gather useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are **not** in the word at all (all marked x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (marked -).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E.
- Does **not** contain A, R, O, S.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Has E somewhere (but not in position 5).
- Avoids A, R, O, S entirely.

A good next guess should test new common consonants and vowels. The word ""UNTIE"" comes to mind:
- It has E in position 4 (a new position for E).
- It introduces the consonants N, T, I and the vowel U.
- It avoids A, R, O, S.

This should give me more information about which of these new letters are present and their correct positions.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)  
   – Letters **not** in the word: A, R, O, S  
   – Letter **in** the word but in the wrong position: E

2. UNTIE → U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) E(-)  
   – Letters **not** in the word: U, T  
   – Letters **in** the word but in the wrong position: N, I, E

So the secret word:
- Contains the letters E, N, I (each only once so far).  
- Does **not** contain A, R, O, S, U, T.

We still need to place E, N, I correctly and discover the remaining two letters.  
A good next guess should:
- Use only the allowed letters.  
- Try to place E, N, I in new positions.  
- Introduce two new consonants that are common and haven’t been ruled out yet.

The word “INFER” is invalid because F and R have already been ruled out.  
The word “INLET” is invalid because T has been ruled out.  
The word “INDEX” is invalid because X and D haven’t been tested yet, but E is already known and N and I are in the word, so let’s check:  
– Letters: I, N, D, E, X.  
– Ruled-out letters: A, R, O, S, U, T.  
– D and X haven’t been ruled out yet.  
– Positions for E, N, I: E is in position 4 (new), N in 2 (new), I in 1 (new).  
So “INDEX” is valid and informative.

Another candidate is “INDEC” (but C hasn’t been tested either).  
“INDEX” seems slightly better because X is a common enough consonant and D is also common.

Therefore, I’ll go with “INDEX”.

  – N is in position 4 (✓)
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:
  – E (because every time it’s marked “-”, meaning it’s in the word but not in the spot guessed)
- Therefore the secret word has the pattern: _ _ I N _ with E somewhere among the blanks.

Remaining high-frequency consonants: B, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y
Remaining vowels: none (E is already known to be present)

We already know E must appear once, so it must be in either position 1, 2, or 5.

A good candidate is “HINEM” – but M and H are still allowed, and E could fit, but this isn’t a valid 5-letter word.

A valid word that fits the pattern _ _ I N _ and uses E in position 5 is “FINET” – but T is already ruled out.

A valid word that fits and uses remaining letters is “MINER” – but R is ruled out.

A valid word that fits and uses remaining letters is “WIPEN” – but W, P, E are still allowed, and N is already in position 4.

But let’s check: W I P E N – positions: W(1), I(2), P(3), E(4), N(5).  This would place N in position 5, but we know N must be in position 4.  So this is invalid.

A valid word with E in position 2 and N in 4: “BEIGN” – but G and B are allowed, and N is in position 4.  However, “BEIGN” isn’t a common word.

A valid word with E in position 5: “F I N E _” – but we need a letter in position 1 and 2.  A valid word is “F I N E _” – but we need a 5-letter word ending in E with I N in positions 3-4.  This would be “F I N E _” – but we need a 5-letter word like “FINE_” – but we need a 5-letter word with I N in positions 3-4 and E in position 5.  This would be “FINE_” – but we need a 5-letter word like “FINED” – but D is ruled out.

Another approach: we need _ _ I N _ with E somewhere.  Possible valid words:
- “BEGIN” – but G, B are allowed, and E is in position 2, N in 4, I in 3.  This fits the pattern and uses allowed letters.

Let’s check:
B (allowed), E (must be in word), G (allowed), I (position 3), N (position 4).  All letters are allowed and positions fit the feedback.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives me good coverage to test multiple letters at once and gather useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are **not** in the word at all (all marked x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (marked -).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E.
- Does **not** contain A, R, O, S.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Has E somewhere (but not in position 5).
- Avoids A, R, O, S entirely.

A good next guess should test new common consonants and vowels. The word ""UNTIE"" comes to mind:
- It has E in position 4 (a new position for E).
- It introduces the consonants N, T, I and the vowel U.
- It avoids A, R, O, S.

This should give me more information about which of these new letters are present and their correct positions.

Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)  
   – Letters **not** in the word: A, R, O, S  
   – Letter **in** the word but in the wrong position: E

2. UNTIE → U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) E(-)  
   – Letters **not** in the word: U, T  
   – Letters **in** the word but in the wrong position: N, I, E

So the secret word:
- Contains the letters E, N, I (each only once so far).  
- Does **not** contain A, R, O, S, U, T.

We still need to place E, N, I correctly and discover the remaining two letters.  
A good next guess should:
- Use only the allowed letters.  
- Try to place E, N, I in new positions.  
- Introduce two new consonants that are common and haven’t been ruled out yet.

The word “INFER” is invalid because F and R have already been ruled out.  
The word “INLET” is invalid because T has been ruled out.  
The word “INDEX” is invalid because X and D haven’t been tested yet, but E is already known and N and I are in the word, so let’s check:  
– Letters: I, N, D, E, X.  
– Ruled-out letters: A, R, O, S, U, T.  
– D and X haven’t been ruled out yet.  
– Positions for E, N, I: E is in position 4 (new), N in 2 (new), I in 1 (new).  
So “INDEX” is valid and informative.

Another candidate is “INDEC” (but C hasn’t been tested either).  
“INDEX” seems slightly better because X is a common enough consonant and D is also common.

Therefore, I’ll go with “INDEX”.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>

Let’s summarize what we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word (x-feedback so far):
A, R, O, S, U, T, D, X

Letters that ARE in the word but whose correct positions we still don’t know:
E, N, I

So the secret word is a permutation of E, N, I plus two letters that have not yet been ruled out and are not among the above list.

Common remaining consonants not yet tested: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Common remaining vowels not yet tested: none, since A, E, I, O, U have all been tested (even E was only “in but wrong place”).

We need two additional letters from the still-allowed set.  Common, high-frequency bigrams or letter combinations suggest we might try words like:

- “BEGIN” – but G and B are still allowed, and we already know E and N are in the word.  However, we already tried “BEGIN” implicitly (as part of “INDEX” and earlier guesses), but since we haven’t seen feedback on B or G yet, this could be useful.  But we already have I and N in the word, and we need to place them.

Wait, we have three letters (E, N, I) that must appear, and two more letters to fill the 5-letter word.  The simplest approach is to pick a word that contains E, N, I plus two new letters that haven’t been ruled out yet.

Let’s pick a word that uses high-frequency remaining letters.  Common remaining high-frequency letters: L, C, G, B, M, P, etc.

A good candidate is “CLINE”:
- Letters: C, L, I, N, E
- All letters are either known to be in the word (I, N, E) or newly introduced (C, L) and not yet ruled out.
- This also gives us a new position for E (position 5), N (position 4), I (position 3), which could help us confirm placements.

Another candidate is “BLINE” or “GIMME”, but “CLINE” seems balanced.

Therefore, I’ll guess “CLINE”.

Guess 4: CLINE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(x) I(✓) N(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, T, D, X, C, L  
- Letters that ARE in the word and whose correct positions are known:
  – I is in position 3 (✓)
  – N is in position 4 (✓)
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:
  – E (because every time it’s marked “-”, meaning it’s in the word but not in the spot guessed)
- Therefore the secret word has the pattern: _ _ I N _ with E somewhere among the blanks.

We still need two more letters (positions 1 and 2) and one of the blanks (position 5) that:
  – have not been ruled out yet
  – are not A, R, O, S, U, T, D, X, C, L
  – are common English letters

Remaining high-frequency consonants: B, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y
Remaining vowels: none (E is already known to be present)

We already know E must appear once, so it must be in either position 1, 2, or 5.

A good candidate is “HINEM” – but M and H are still allowed, and E could fit, but this isn’t a valid 5-letter word.

A valid word that fits the pattern _ _ I N _ and uses E in position 5 is “FINET” – but T is already ruled out.

A valid word that fits and uses remaining letters is “MINER” – but R is ruled out.

A valid word that fits and uses remaining letters is “WIPEN” – but W, P, E are still allowed, and N is already in position 4.

But let’s check: W I P E N – positions: W(1), I(2), P(3), E(4), N(5).  This would place N in position 5, but we know N must be in position 4.  So this is invalid.

We need the pattern _ _ I N _ with E somewhere in 1, 2, or 5.

A valid word with E in position 2 and N in 4: “BEIGN” – but G and B are allowed, and N is in position 4.  However, “BEIGN” isn’t a common word.

A valid word with E in position 5: “F I N E _” – but we need a letter in position 1 and 2.  A valid word is “F I N E _” – but we need a 5-letter word ending in E with I N in positions 3-4.  This would be “F I N E _” – but we need a 5-letter word like “FINE_” – but we need a 5-letter word with I N in positions 3-4 and E in position 5.  This would be “FINE_” – but we need a 5-letter word like “FINED” – but D is ruled out.

Another approach: we need _ _ I N _ with E somewhere.  Possible valid words:
- “BEGIN” – but G, B are allowed, and E is in position 2, N in 4, I in 3.  This fits the pattern and uses allowed letters.

Let’s check:
B (allowed), E (must be in word), G (allowed), I (position 3), N (position 4).  All letters are allowed and positions fit the feedback.

So “BEGIN” is a valid guess.
