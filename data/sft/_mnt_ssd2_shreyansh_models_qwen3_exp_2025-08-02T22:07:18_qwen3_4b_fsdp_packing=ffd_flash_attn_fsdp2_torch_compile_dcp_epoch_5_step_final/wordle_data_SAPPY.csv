For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common starting words include:

- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- C (very common in English)
- R (second most common letter)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This combination gives us coverage of 5 different common letters, including 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 consonants (C, R, N), which should help eliminate many possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C(x) – C is NOT in the word.
- R(x) – R is NOT in the word.
- A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at position 3).
- N(x) – N is NOT in the word.
- E(x) – E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains the letter A somewhere (but not in position 3).
- The letters C, R, N, E are NOT in the word.
- We still need to test other common letters.

Good remaining consonants to test: S, T, L, M, D, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good vowels: I, O, U (since A is already confirmed).

A good next guess should:
1. Include A in a different position.
2. Introduce new common letters.

Possible candidates:
- STAIL (but E is out, so maybe STAIL is okay since it doesn’t use E, but we need to check letters)
- PLAID (but P, L, D are good, but A is in position 2 here)
- SALTY (but S, L, T, Y are good, but Y might be less common)
- GUILD (but G, U, I, L, D – but E is already out, but GUILD uses U and I which are good)

Actually, let me think of a word that:
- Uses A not in position 3.
- Avoids C, R, N, E.
- Introduces new common letters.

A good choice is ""PLAID"":
- P – new consonant
- L – new consonant
- A – in position 2 (different from position 3 in CRANE)
- I – new vowel
- D – new consonant

This tests 4 new letters (P, L, I, D) plus the known letter A in a new position.

- Position information:
  – A is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3.  
  – P is in the word but NOT in position 1.

Remaining common letters we have not tried yet: B, F, G, H, K, M, O, S, T, U, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and P (with A not in positions 2 or 3, and P not in position 1).
2. Uses only letters that have not been ruled out (no C, R, N, E, L, I, D).
3. Tests new common letters to maximize information.

- O – new vowel
- A – known letter, now in position 3 (which we already know A is NOT in, so this is a test of the other A positions)

Another candidate is “STAMP”:

- T – new consonant
- A – known letter, now in position 3 (again ruled out)
- M – new consonant
- P – known letter, now in position 5 (which is allowed since P is not in position 1)

But A in position 3 is still invalid. Let’s try “MAPSY” – but Y is less common and S is already in STAMP.

A better choice is “BASHP”:
- B – new consonant
- A – known letter, now in position 2 (which was ruled out for A, so this is invalid)

Next, try “PAWMS”:
- P – known letter, now in position 1 (invalid since P can’t be in position 1)

Try “GLOAM” – but L is ruled out.

Try “BOOST”:
- B – new consonant
- O – new vowel
- O – new vowel
- S – new consonant
- T – new consonant

This doesn’t include A or P, so it’s invalid.

Try “SPOOK” – but O and K are new, but P is in position 1 (invalid).

Try “MAJOR” – but R and J are new, but R is ruled out.

Try “HUMPS”:
- H – new consonant
- U – new vowel
- M – new consonant
- P – known letter, now in position 4 (valid)
- S – new consonant

This doesn’t include A, so it’s invalid.

We need a word with both A and P. Let’s try “TAPAS”:
- T – new consonant
- A – known letter, now in position 2 (invalid since A can’t be in position 2)

Try “VAPOR” – but R is ruled out.

Try “KAPUT”:

Try “PAJOS” – but J and O are new, but A is in position 1 (valid), P is in position 1 (invalid).

Try “PAPAW” – but P is in position 1 (invalid).

Try “MAKUP” – but K and U are new, but A is in position 1 (valid), P is in position 5 (valid).

This seems valid:
- Letters used: M, A, K, U, P
- All letters are unused or known to be in the word.
- A is in position 1 (which is allowed since previous A positions were 2 and 3).
- P is in position 5 (which is allowed since P can’t be in position 1).

Try “MAJPS” – but J is new and P is in position 5 (valid), but A is in position 2 (invalid).

Try “PAJOS” – but J and O are new, but A is in position 1 (valid), P is in position 1 (invalid).

Try “PAPAW” – but P is in position 1 (invalid).

Try “MAKUP” – but K and U are new, but A is in position 1 (valid), P is in position 5 (valid).

This seems valid:
- Letters used: M, A, K, U, P
- All letters are unused or known to be in the word.
- A is in position 1 (which is allowed since previous A positions were 2 and 3).
- P is in position 5 (which is allowed since P can’t be in position 1).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common starting words include:

- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- C (very common in English)
- R (second most common letter)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This combination gives us coverage of 5 different common letters, including 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 consonants (C, R, N), which should help eliminate many possibilities quickly.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C(x) – C is NOT in the word.
- R(x) – R is NOT in the word.
- A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at position 3).
- N(x) – N is NOT in the word.
- E(x) – E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains the letter A somewhere (but not in position 3).
- The letters C, R, N, E are NOT in the word.
- We still need to test other common letters.

Good remaining consonants to test: S, T, L, M, D, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good vowels: I, O, U (since A is already confirmed).

A good next guess should:
1. Include A in a different position.
2. Introduce new common letters.

Possible candidates:
- STAIL (but E is out, so maybe STAIL is okay since it doesn’t use E, but we need to check letters)
- PLAID (but P, L, D are good, but A is in position 2 here)
- SALTY (but S, L, T, Y are good, but Y might be less common)
- GUILD (but G, U, I, L, D – but E is already out, but GUILD uses U and I which are good)

Actually, let me think of a word that:
- Uses A not in position 3.
- Avoids C, R, N, E.
- Introduces new common letters.

A good choice is ""PLAID"":
- P – new consonant
- L – new consonant
- A – in position 2 (different from position 3 in CRANE)
- I – new vowel
- D – new consonant

This tests 4 new letters (P, L, I, D) plus the known letter A in a new position.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLAID -> FEEDBACK: P(-) L(x) A(-) I(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)  
Guess 2: PLAID → P(-) L(x) A(-) I(x) D(x)

What we now know for sure:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, L, I, D  
- Letters that ARE in the word (but in the wrong positions so far): A, P  
- Position information:
  – A is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3.  
  – P is in the word but NOT in position 1.

Remaining common letters we have not tried yet: B, F, G, H, K, M, O, S, T, U, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and P (with A not in positions 2 or 3, and P not in position 1).
2. Uses only letters that have not been ruled out (no C, R, N, E, L, I, D).
3. Tests new common letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is “MOATS”:
- M – new consonant
- O – new vowel
- A – known letter, now in position 3 (which we already know A is NOT in, so this is a test of the other A positions)
- T – new consonant
- S – new consonant

However, A in position 3 is already ruled out. Let’s pick a word where A is in a new position and P is also in a new position.

Another candidate is “STAMP”:
- S – new consonant
- T – new consonant
- A – known letter, now in position 3 (again ruled out)
- M – new consonant
- P – known letter, now in position 5 (which is allowed since P is not in position 1)

But A in position 3 is still invalid. Let’s try “MAPSY” – but Y is less common and S is already in STAMP.

A better choice is “BASHP”:
- B – new consonant
- A – known letter, now in position 2 (which was ruled out for A, so this is invalid)

Next, try “PAWMS”:
- P – known letter, now in position 1 (invalid since P can’t be in position 1)

Try “GLOAM” – but L is ruled out.

Try “BOOST”:
- B – new consonant
- O – new vowel
- O – new vowel
- S – new consonant
- T – new consonant

This doesn’t include A or P, so it’s invalid.

Try “SPOOK” – but O and K are new, but P is in position 1 (invalid).

Try “MAJOR” – but R and J are new, but R is ruled out.

Try “HUMPS”:
- H – new consonant
- U – new vowel
- M – new consonant
- P – known letter, now in position 4 (valid)
- S – new consonant

This doesn’t include A, so it’s invalid.

We need a word with both A and P. Let’s try “TAPAS”:
- T – new consonant
- A – known letter, now in position 2 (invalid since A can’t be in position 2)

Try “VAPOR” – but R is ruled out.

Try “KAPUT”:
- K – new consonant
- A – known letter, now in position 2 (invalid)

Try “WAPID” – but I and D are ruled out.

Try “SHAKY” – but K and Y are new, but A is in position 2 (invalid).

Try “YAKES” – but E is ruled out.

Try “GAMPS”:
- G – new consonant
- A – known letter, now in position 2 (invalid)

Try “BAPHS” – but H and S are new, but A is in position 2 (invalid).

Try “MAJPS” – but J is new and P is in position 5 (valid), but A is in position 2 (invalid).

Try “PAJOS” – but J and O are new, but A is in position 1 (valid), P is in position 1 (invalid).

Try “PAPAW” – but P is in position 1 (invalid).

Try “MAKUP” – but K and U are new, but A is in position 1 (valid), P is in position 5 (valid).

This seems valid:
- Letters used: M, A, K, U, P
- All letters are unused or known to be in the word.
- A is in position 1 (which is allowed since previous A positions were 2 and 3).
- P is in position 5 (which is allowed since P can’t be in position 1).

Let's digest the new feedback:

Guess 3: MAKUP → M(x) A(✓) K(x) U(x) P(-)

1. A is now confirmed to be in position 2 (✓).  
2. P is in the word but NOT in position 5 (from PLAID: P(-) in position 1, and here P(-) in position 5).  
   So P must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.  
3. Letters ruled out so far:  
   C, R, N, E, L, I, D, M, K, U.  
4. Remaining common letters we haven’t tried: B, F, G, H, J, O, S, T, V, W, Y.  
5. We need a 5-letter word that:
   - Has A fixed in position 2.  
   - Contains P somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (since 1 and 5 are ruled out).  
   - Uses only the still-allowed letters.  

Candidate structure: _ A _ _ _ with P in position 3 or 4.

Possible patterns:
- _ A P _ _  (P in 3rd)
- _ A _ P _  (P in 4th)

Let’s brainstorm words fitting these patterns with allowed letters:

_ A P _ _  
BAPED, BAPED (invalid), CAPED (C ruled out), FAPED, GAPED, HAPED, JAPED, MAPED (M ruled out), PAPED (P in 1st, invalid), etc.  
Valid ones: BAPED (but E is ruled out), FAPED (E ruled out), GAPED (E ruled out) – none work.

_ A _ P _  
BAGPO (O allowed), HAGPE (E ruled out), TAGPE (E ruled out), SAGPE (E ruled out), etc.  
Better options: BAGPO, HAGPO, SAGPO – but these use O and P correctly.

Another pattern: _ A _ P _ with P in 4th and A in 2nd.

Valid words:  
BAGPO, HAGPO, SAGPO, TAGPO, VAPOR (R ruled out), etc.  
The simplest and most common seems BAGPO, but let me check letters: B, A, G, P, O – all allowed.

However, BAGPO is a valid word (a slang term for ""bag of potatoes""). But let’s aim for more common words.

Another candidate: HAPOR – but R is ruled out.

Try S A _ P _ :  
SAPID (I, D ruled out), SATED (E, D ruled out), etc. – none work.

Try T A _ P _ :  
TAPED (E, D ruled out), TAPAS (S allowed, but A in 2nd is correct, P in 3rd is allowed, S allowed, but T is in 1st, A in 2nd, P in 3rd, S in 4th, but we need 5 letters. TAPAS has A in 2nd, P in 3rd, S in 4th, but we need to check all letters: T, A, P, A, S. A is allowed twice? The rules don’t forbid repeated letters, and A could appear twice. However, TAPAS has A twice and S once, P once, T once. But we have no info on S yet. Let’s consider TAPAS.

But TAPAS has A in 2nd and 4th, P in 3rd. This fits all constraints:
- A in 2nd (✓).  
- P in 3rd (allowed).  
- Letters: T, A, P, A, S – all allowed (T, S not ruled out yet).  
But TAPAS uses A twice, which might not be optimal if we want to test new letters.

A better choice is SAGPO (S, A, G, P, O) – all unique letters and all allowed.

But let’s pick the most common word fitting the constraints: TAPAS.

Wait, let’s re-examine:
- A must be in position 2 (✓).  
- P must be in positions 3 or 4 (since 1 and 5 are ruled out).  
- Letters allowed: B, F, G, H, J, O, S, T, V, W, Y.

Possible words:
- TAPAS (A in 2, P in 3, S in 4, A in 5, T in 1) – but S is new, T is new.  
- SAGAS (but S twice, G once, A twice) – but A is already fixed in 2.  
- HAPAS (but H in 1, A in 2, P in 3, A in 4, S in 5) – but S is new.  
- BAPAS (B in 1, A in 2, P in 3, A in 4, S in 5) – but S is new.  

The best seems TAPAS, as it uses common letters and tests T and S.

But let me double-check:
- TAPAS: T, A, P, A, S  
  - T: allowed (not ruled out)  
  - A: fixed in 2, second A is allowed  
  - P: allowed in 3  
  - S: allowed  
This fits all constraints.

However, another valid word is SAGPO (S, A, G, P, O) – all unique letters, all allowed, P in 4th.

Between TAPAS and SAGPO, TAPAS is more common. Let’s go with TAPAS.

But wait – in TAPAS, P is in position 3, which is allowed (since P can’t be in 1 or 5).  

Yes, TAPAS is valid.

So the next guess is TAPAS.

  - A: fixed in 2, second A is allowed  
  - P: allowed in 3  
  - S: allowed  
This fits all constraints.

However, another valid word is SAGPO (S, A, G, P, O) – all unique letters, all allowed, P in 4th.

Between TAPAS and SAGPO, TAPAS is more common. Let’s go with TAPAS.

But wait – in TAPAS, P is in position 3, which is allowed (since P can’t be in 1 or 5).  

Yes, TAPAS is valid.

So the next guess is TAPAS.",Guess 4: TAPAS -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) P(✓) A(-) S(-),FAIL

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common starting words include:

- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- C (very common in English)
- R (second most common letter)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This combination gives us coverage of 5 different common letters, including 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 consonants (C, R, N), which should help eliminate many possibilities quickly.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C(x) – C is NOT in the word.
- R(x) – R is NOT in the word.
- A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at position 3).
- N(x) – N is NOT in the word.
- E(x) – E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains the letter A somewhere (but not in position 3).
- The letters C, R, N, E are NOT in the word.
- We still need to test other common letters.

Good remaining consonants to test: S, T, L, M, D, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good vowels: I, O, U (since A is already confirmed).

A good next guess should:
1. Include A in a different position.
2. Introduce new common letters.

Possible candidates:
- STAIL (but E is out, so maybe STAIL is okay since it doesn’t use E, but we need to check letters)
- PLAID (but P, L, D are good, but A is in position 2 here)
- SALTY (but S, L, T, Y are good, but Y might be less common)
- GUILD (but G, U, I, L, D – but E is already out, but GUILD uses U and I which are good)

Actually, let me think of a word that:
- Uses A not in position 3.
- Avoids C, R, N, E.
- Introduces new common letters.

A good choice is ""PLAID"":
- P – new consonant
- L – new consonant
- A – in position 2 (different from position 3 in CRANE)
- I – new vowel
- D – new consonant

This tests 4 new letters (P, L, I, D) plus the known letter A in a new position.

<guess>PLAID</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLAID -> FEEDBACK: P(-) L(x) A(-) I(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)  
Guess 2: PLAID → P(-) L(x) A(-) I(x) D(x)

What we now know for sure:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, L, I, D  
- Letters that ARE in the word (but in the wrong positions so far): A, P  
- Position information:
  – A is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3.  
  – P is in the word but NOT in position 1.

Remaining common letters we have not tried yet: B, F, G, H, K, M, O, S, T, U, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and P (with A not in positions 2 or 3, and P not in position 1).
2. Uses only letters that have not been ruled out (no C, R, N, E, L, I, D).
3. Tests new common letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is “MOATS”:
- M – new consonant
- O – new vowel
- A – known letter, now in position 3 (which we already know A is NOT in, so this is a test of the other A positions)
- T – new consonant
- S – new consonant

However, A in position 3 is already ruled out. Let’s pick a word where A is in a new position and P is also in a new position.

Another candidate is “STAMP”:
- S – new consonant
- T – new consonant
- A – known letter, now in position 3 (again ruled out)
- M – new consonant
- P – known letter, now in position 5 (which is allowed since P is not in position 1)

But A in position 3 is still invalid. Let’s try “MAPSY” – but Y is less common and S is already in STAMP.

A better choice is “BASHP”:
- B – new consonant
- A – known letter, now in position 2 (which was ruled out for A, so this is invalid)

Next, try “PAWMS”:
- P – known letter, now in position 1 (invalid since P can’t be in position 1)

Try “GLOAM” – but L is ruled out.

Try “BOOST”:
- B – new consonant
- O – new vowel
- O – new vowel
- S – new consonant
- T – new consonant

This doesn’t include A or P, so it’s invalid.

Try “SPOOK” – but O and K are new, but P is in position 1 (invalid).

Try “MAJOR” – but R and J are new, but R is ruled out.

Try “HUMPS”:
- H – new consonant
- U – new vowel
- M – new consonant
- P – known letter, now in position 4 (valid)
- S – new consonant

This doesn’t include A, so it’s invalid.

We need a word with both A and P. Let’s try “TAPAS”:
- T – new consonant
- A – known letter, now in position 2 (invalid since A can’t be in position 2)

Try “VAPOR” – but R is ruled out.

Try “KAPUT”:
- K – new consonant
- A – known letter, now in position 2 (invalid)

Try “WAPID” – but I and D are ruled out.

Try “SHAKY” – but K and Y are new, but A is in position 2 (invalid).

Try “YAKES” – but E is ruled out.

Try “GAMPS”:
- G – new consonant
- A – known letter, now in position 2 (invalid)

Try “BAPHS” – but H and S are new, but A is in position 2 (invalid).

Try “MAJPS” – but J is new and P is in position 5 (valid), but A is in position 2 (invalid).

Try “PAJOS” – but J and O are new, but A is in position 1 (valid), P is in position 1 (invalid).

Try “PAPAW” – but P is in position 1 (invalid).

Try “MAKUP” – but K and U are new, but A is in position 1 (valid), P is in position 5 (valid).

This seems valid:
- Letters used: M, A, K, U, P
- All letters are unused or known to be in the word.
- A is in position 1 (which is allowed since previous A positions were 2 and 3).
- P is in position 5 (which is allowed since P can’t be in position 1).

Let’s go with “MAKUP”.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLAID -> FEEDBACK: P(-) L(x) A(-) I(x) D(x)
Guess 3: MAKUP -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(✓) K(x) U(x) P(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's digest the new feedback:

Guess 3: MAKUP → M(x) A(✓) K(x) U(x) P(-)

1. A is now confirmed to be in position 2 (✓).  
2. P is in the word but NOT in position 5 (from PLAID: P(-) in position 1, and here P(-) in position 5).  
   So P must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.  
3. Letters ruled out so far:  
   C, R, N, E, L, I, D, M, K, U.  
4. Remaining common letters we haven’t tried: B, F, G, H, J, O, S, T, V, W, Y.  
5. We need a 5-letter word that:
   - Has A fixed in position 2.  
   - Contains P somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (since 1 and 5 are ruled out).  
   - Uses only the still-allowed letters.  

Candidate structure: _ A _ _ _ with P in position 3 or 4.

Possible patterns:
- _ A P _ _  (P in 3rd)
- _ A _ P _  (P in 4th)

Let’s brainstorm words fitting these patterns with allowed letters:

_ A P _ _  
BAPED, BAPED (invalid), CAPED (C ruled out), FAPED, GAPED, HAPED, JAPED, MAPED (M ruled out), PAPED (P in 1st, invalid), etc.  
Valid ones: BAPED (but E is ruled out), FAPED (E ruled out), GAPED (E ruled out) – none work.

_ A _ P _  
BAGPO (O allowed), HAGPE (E ruled out), TAGPE (E ruled out), SAGPE (E ruled out), etc.  
Better options: BAGPO, HAGPO, SAGPO – but these use O and P correctly.

Another pattern: _ A _ P _ with P in 4th and A in 2nd.

Valid words:  
BAGPO, HAGPO, SAGPO, TAGPO, VAPOR (R ruled out), etc.  
The simplest and most common seems BAGPO, but let me check letters: B, A, G, P, O – all allowed.

However, BAGPO is a valid word (a slang term for ""bag of potatoes""). But let’s aim for more common words.

Another candidate: HAPOR – but R is ruled out.

Try S A _ P _ :  
SAPID (I, D ruled out), SATED (E, D ruled out), etc. – none work.

Try T A _ P _ :  
TAPED (E, D ruled out), TAPAS (S allowed, but A in 2nd is correct, P in 3rd is allowed, S allowed, but T is in 1st, A in 2nd, P in 3rd, S in 4th, but we need 5 letters. TAPAS has A in 2nd, P in 3rd, S in 4th, but we need to check all letters: T, A, P, A, S. A is allowed twice? The rules don’t forbid repeated letters, and A could appear twice. However, TAPAS has A twice and S once, P once, T once. But we have no info on S yet. Let’s consider TAPAS.

But TAPAS has A in 2nd and 4th, P in 3rd. This fits all constraints:
- A in 2nd (✓).  
- P in 3rd (allowed).  
- Letters: T, A, P, A, S – all allowed (T, S not ruled out yet).  
But TAPAS uses A twice, which might not be optimal if we want to test new letters.

A better choice is SAGPO (S, A, G, P, O) – all unique letters and all allowed.

But let’s pick the most common word fitting the constraints: TAPAS.

Wait, let’s re-examine:
- A must be in position 2 (✓).  
- P must be in positions 3 or 4 (since 1 and 5 are ruled out).  
- Letters allowed: B, F, G, H, J, O, S, T, V, W, Y.

Possible words:
- TAPAS (A in 2, P in 3, S in 4, A in 5, T in 1) – but S is new, T is new.  
- SAGAS (but S twice, G once, A twice) – but A is already fixed in 2.  
- HAPAS (but H in 1, A in 2, P in 3, A in 4, S in 5) – but S is new.  
- BAPAS (B in 1, A in 2, P in 3, A in 4, S in 5) – but S is new.  

The best seems TAPAS, as it uses common letters and tests T and S.

But let me double-check:
- TAPAS: T, A, P, A, S  
  - T: allowed (not ruled out)  
  - A: fixed in 2, second A is allowed  
  - P: allowed in 3  
  - S: allowed  
This fits all constraints.

However, another valid word is SAGPO (S, A, G, P, O) – all unique letters, all allowed, P in 4th.

Between TAPAS and SAGPO, TAPAS is more common. Let’s go with TAPAS.

But wait – in TAPAS, P is in position 3, which is allowed (since P can’t be in 1 or 5).  

Yes, TAPAS is valid.

So the next guess is TAPAS.

This fits all constraints:\n- A in 2nd (✓).  \n- P in 3rd (allowed).  \n- Letters: T, A, P, A, S – all allowed (T, S not ruled out yet).  \nBut TAPAS uses A twice, which might not be optimal if we want to test new letters.\n\nA better choice is SAGPO (S, A, G, P, O) – all unique letters and all allowed.\n\nBut let’s pick the most common word fitting the constraints: TAPAS.\n\nWait, let’s re-examine:\n- A must be in position 2 (✓).  \n- P must be in positions 3 or 4 (since 1 and 5 are ruled out).  \n- Letters allowed: B, F, G, H, J, O, S, T, V, W, Y.\n\nPossible words:\n- TAPAS (A in 2, P in 3, S in 4, A in 5, T in 1) – but S is new, T is new.  \n- SAGAS (but S twice, G once, A twice) – but A is already fixed in 2.  \n- HAPAS (but H in 1, A in 2, P in 3, A in 4, S in 5) – but S is new.  \n- BAPAS (B in 1, A in 2, P in 3, A in 4, S in 5) – but S is new.  \n\nThe best seems TAPAS, as it uses common letters and tests T and S.\n\nBut let me double-check:\n- TAPAS: T, A, P, A, S  \n  - T: allowed (not ruled out)  \n  - A: fixed in 2, second A is allowed  \n  - P: allowed in 3  \n  - S: allowed  \nThis fits all constraints.\n\nHowever, another valid word is SAGPO (S, A, G, P, O) – all unique letters, all allowed, P in 4th.\n\nBetween TAPAS and SAGPO, TAPAS is more common. Let’s go with TAPAS.\n\nBut wait – in TAPAS, P is in position 3, which is allowed (since P can’t be in 1 or 5).  \n\nYes, TAPAS is valid.\n\nSo the next guess is TAPAS.\n\n<guess>TAPAS</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: PLAID -> FEEDBACK: P(-) L(x) A(-) I(x) D(x)\nGuess 3: MAKUP -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(✓) K(x) U(x) P(-)\nGuess 4: TAPAS -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) P(✓) A(-) S(-)\n'}]","<think>
Let’s carefully incorporate the brand-new feedback from TAPAS:

TAPAS → T(x) A(✓) P(✓) A(-) S(-)

1. A is locked in position 2 (✓).  
2. P is now confirmed in position 3 (✓).  
   So the pattern is now: _ A P _ _  
3. The second A in position 4 is marked “-”, meaning:
   – A is already used in position 2, so the word may contain only one A (and it must be in position 2).  
   – Therefore position 4 cannot be A.  
4. T and S are both in the word but are in the wrong positions.  
   – T cannot be in position 1.  
   – S cannot be in position 5.  

5. Letters we have ruled out so far (from all feedback):
   C, R, N, E, L, I, D, M, K, U, T, S.  
   Wait: T and S were in TAPAS and marked “x” and “-”.  
   – T(x) means T is NOT in the word at all.  
   – S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 5.  

So the actual set of letters NOT in the word is:
C, R, N, E, L, I, D, M, K, U, T.

Letters that ARE in the word and their known positions:
- A (fixed at position 2)
- P (fixed at position 3)
- S (in the word, but not at position 5)

We still need two more letters to fill positions 1 and 5.  
Available letters (never yet tested and not ruled out):
B, F, G, H, J, O, V, W, Y, plus S (which must appear somewhere).

Because S cannot be in position 5, it must be in position 1 or 5.  
But position 5 is the only open spot left for S (position 1 is open too, but let’s try to place S in 5 first since it’s the only remaining spot where it can legally go).

So we want a word of the form:
? A P _ S
with the blank being any unused letter that hasn’t been ruled out.

Possible choices for the blank: B, F, G, H, J, O, V, W, Y.

Let’s pick the most common letter that fits: B, F, G, H, O, V.

The most common among these is B or G or H.

Testing B: BAP_S → BAPBS (invalid), BAPFS (invalid), etc. – no common word.

Testing G: GAP_S → GAPPED (too long), GAPS_ – nothing.

Testing H: HAP_S → HAPED (E ruled out), HAPAS (A already used twice issue), HAPOR (R ruled out).

Testing O: OAP_S – no.

Testing V: VAP_S – VAPID (I, D ruled out).

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words matching _ A P _ S with allowed letters.

Looking for real words:
- BAPED – E ruled out  
- FAPED – E ruled out  
- GAPED – E ruled out  
- HAPED – E ruled out  
- JAPED – E ruled out  
- MAPED – M ruled out  
- PAPED – P already used in 3, and P cannot repeat (no info against it, but we have no evidence of double P)  
- SATED – A, T, E ruled out  
- VAPED – E ruled out  
- WAPED – E ruled out  
- YAPED – E ruled out  

None of these work because they all contain E or other ruled-out letters.

Let’s instead try placing S in position 1, giving:
S A P _ _  
We need a letter for position 4 and 5, both from remaining unused letters (B, F, G, H, J, O, V, W, Y), and position 5 must not be S (already handled).

Common words:
- SAPPY – Y allowed, P already used in 3, but SAPPY has P in 3 and 4, and P is already fixed in 3. So SAPPY would be S A P P Y – but P is only confirmed once.  
- SAPPY has two Ps – we have no info against it.  
- SAPPY is a valid word.

Check letters:
S – allowed (in word, not in position 5)  
A – fixed in 2  
P – fixed in 3  
P – second P allowed (no evidence against)  
Y – allowed  

This seems valid and tests Y.

Another candidate: SAGGY – G twice, but G is allowed.

SAPPY seems the most straightforward.

So the next guess is SAPPY.
