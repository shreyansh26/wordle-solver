For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. Among these, I'll pick a word with a good mix of consonants and vowels. ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This should help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

- R is in the word but in the wrong position.

So we now know:
- The secret word contains A and R somewhere (but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively).

- R and A are placed in new positions (2 and 3 instead of 1 and 2 in “arose”).

This should help determine if T, L, or I are in the word, while repositioning R and A.

From the two rounds of feedback we know:

1. Letters that ARE in the secret word: A and R (both confirmed, but both still in wrong positions).
2. Letters that are NOT in the secret word: O, S, E, T, I, L.

So the secret word contains A and R, and none of O, S, E, T, I, L.

Positions so far:
- In arose: A was in position 1 (wrong), R was in position 2 (wrong).
- In trail: R was in position 2 (wrong), A was in position 3 (wrong).

Therefore:
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from arose and trail).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and R.
- Does not contain O, S, E, T, I, L.
- Places A and R in new positions.

Remaining common consonants not yet tried: N, C, D, G, H, M, P, U, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels not yet tried: U (since A is already confirmed, and E, O, I are out).

Let’s try to place A and R in new positions and introduce new letters.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5
Possible positions for R: 1, 4, 5

A good candidate is “CRANK”:
- C and N are new letters.
- K is new.
- A is in position 2 (new position for A).
- R is in position 3 (new position for R).

But wait: in trail, R was in position 2 and marked “-” (wrong position), so R could still be in 1, 3, 4, or 5. Position 3 was marked “-” in trail, so R could still be in 1, 4, or 5. So R in position 3 is still allowed (since trail had R in 2, not 3).

But let’s double-check: in arose, R was in position 2 (marked “-”). In trail, R was in position 2 again (same position) and still “-”. So R cannot be in position 2. From trail, R was also in position 2 again, so same info. We know R is not in position 2. We need R in 1, 3, 4, or 5.

In CRANK:
- R is in position 3 (new position).
- A is in position 2 (new position).
- C, N, K are new letters.

This seems valid.

Another candidate could be “DRAIN” but N is in position 5 and A in 2, but I is already out, and L is out, so N is okay. But K is also okay.

But CRANK seems good.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. Among these, I'll pick a word with a good mix of consonants and vowels. ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This should help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R is in the word but in the wrong position.
- O, S, E are NOT in the word.

So we now know:
- The secret word contains A and R somewhere (but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively).
- It does NOT contain O, S, or E.

To maximize new information, I want a word that:
1. Uses the known letters A and R in different positions.
2. Introduces other common letters that haven’t been tried yet (like T, N, L, C, D, etc.).
3. Avoids O, S, E.

A good candidate is “TRAIL”:
- T, L, I are new letters.
- R and A are placed in new positions (2 and 3 instead of 1 and 2 in “arose”).

This should help determine if T, L, or I are in the word, while repositioning R and A.

Guess 2: trail -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) L(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we know:

1. Letters that ARE in the secret word: A and R (both confirmed, but both still in wrong positions).
2. Letters that are NOT in the secret word: O, S, E, T, I, L.

So the secret word contains A and R, and none of O, S, E, T, I, L.

Positions so far:
- In arose: A was in position 1 (wrong), R was in position 2 (wrong).
- In trail: R was in position 2 (wrong), A was in position 3 (wrong).

Therefore:
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from arose and trail).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and R.
- Does not contain O, S, E, T, I, L.
- Places A and R in new positions.

Remaining common consonants not yet tried: N, C, D, G, H, M, P, U, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels not yet tried: U (since A is already confirmed, and E, O, I are out).

Let’s try to place A and R in new positions and introduce new letters.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5
Possible positions for R: 1, 4, 5

A good candidate is “CRANK”:
- C and N are new letters.
- K is new.
- A is in position 2 (new position for A).
- R is in position 3 (new position for R).

But wait: in trail, R was in position 2 and marked “-” (wrong position), so R could still be in 1, 3, 4, or 5. Position 3 was marked “-” in trail, so R could still be in 1, 4, or 5. So R in position 3 is still allowed (since trail had R in 2, not 3).

But let’s double-check: in arose, R was in position 2 (marked “-”). In trail, R was in position 2 again (same position) and still “-”. So R cannot be in position 2. From trail, R was also in position 2 again, so same info. We know R is not in position 2. We need R in 1, 3, 4, or 5.

In CRANK:
- R is in position 3 (new position).
- A is in position 2 (new position).
- C, N, K are new letters.

This seems valid.

Another candidate could be “DRAIN” but N is in position 5 and A in 2, but I is already out, and L is out, so N is okay. But K is also okay.

But CRANK seems good.

Let’s go with CRANK.

Letters confirmed to be in the word (but wrong positions so far):
- A – cannot be in positions 1,2,3,4  ⇒ must be in position 5
- R – cannot be in positions 2,3,4  ⇒ must be in position 1

Letters confirmed NOT in the word:
O, S, E, T, I, L, C, N, K, D, Y

So the pattern so far is:

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):
B, F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

From guess 4 (ruday), we saw:
- U is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 2 but marked “-”).

Therefore:
- U must appear somewhere in positions 2,3,4 (since position 5 is A and position 1 is R).

We need a word that:
1. Starts with R and ends with A: R _ _ _ A
2. Contains U in position 2, 3, or 4
3. Uses only allowed letters (no O,S,E,T,I,L,C,N,K,D,Y)

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. Among these, I'll pick a word with a good mix of consonants and vowels. ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This should help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R is in the word but in the wrong position.
- O, S, E are NOT in the word.

So we now know:
- The secret word contains A and R somewhere (but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively).
- It does NOT contain O, S, or E.

To maximize new information, I want a word that:
1. Uses the known letters A and R in different positions.
2. Introduces other common letters that haven’t been tried yet (like T, N, L, C, D, etc.).
3. Avoids O, S, E.

A good candidate is “TRAIL”:
- T, L, I are new letters.
- R and A are placed in new positions (2 and 3 instead of 1 and 2 in “arose”).

This should help determine if T, L, or I are in the word, while repositioning R and A.

Guess 2: trail -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) L(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we know:

1. Letters that ARE in the secret word: A and R (both confirmed, but both still in wrong positions).
2. Letters that are NOT in the secret word: O, S, E, T, I, L.

So the secret word contains A and R, and none of O, S, E, T, I, L.

Positions so far:
- In arose: A was in position 1 (wrong), R was in position 2 (wrong).
- In trail: R was in position 2 (wrong), A was in position 3 (wrong).

Therefore:
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from arose and trail).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and R.
- Does not contain O, S, E, T, I, L.
- Places A and R in new positions.

Remaining common consonants not yet tried: N, C, D, G, H, M, P, U, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels not yet tried: U (since A is already confirmed, and E, O, I are out).

Let’s try to place A and R in new positions and introduce new letters.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5
Possible positions for R: 1, 4, 5

A good candidate is “CRANK”:
- C and N are new letters.
- K is new.
- A is in position 2 (new position for A).
- R is in position 3 (new position for R).

But wait: in trail, R was in position 2 and marked “-” (wrong position), so R could still be in 1, 3, 4, or 5. Position 3 was marked “-” in trail, so R could still be in 1, 4, or 5. So R in position 3 is still allowed (since trail had R in 2, not 3).

But let’s double-check: in arose, R was in position 2 (marked “-”). In trail, R was in position 2 again (same position) and still “-”. So R cannot be in position 2. From trail, R was also in position 2 again, so same info. We know R is not in position 2. We need R in 1, 3, 4, or 5.

In CRANK:
- R is in position 3 (new position).
- A is in position 2 (new position).
- C, N, K are new letters.

This seems valid.

Another candidate could be “DRAIN” but N is in position 5 and A in 2, but I is already out, and L is out, so N is okay. But K is also okay.

But CRANK seems good.

Let’s go with CRANK.

Known letters in the word (but wrong positions):
- A – cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3 (from arose, trail, crank)
- R – cannot be in positions 2, 3 (from arose, trail, crank)

Known absent letters: O, S, E, T, I, L, C, N, K

So:
- A must be in position 4 or 5.
- R can be in positions 1, 4, or 5 (but cannot be in 2 or 3).

We still need to test other common letters not yet tried: D, G, H, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
- Places A in position 4 or 5,
- Places R in position 1, 4, or 5 (not already excluded),
- Introduces new letters.

A good candidate is “DRAFT”:
- D, F, T are new letters, but T is already out → discard.
Next candidate: “GRAPE”:
- G, P, E; E is out → discard.
Next: “PRANK”:
- P, N, K; N and K already out → discard.
Next: “DURAL”:
- D, U, L; L already out → discard.
Next: “GRAVY”:
- G, V, Y; V and Y new, but A and R positions:
   - R in position 2 → already out → discard.

Let’s try “GRAVY” variant: “GRAVY” has R in 2 → no.

Next: “MARRY”:
- M, Y; R in 3 → already out.

Next: “DARMA”:
- D, M; A in 3 → already out.

Next: “DARMA” invalid.

Next: “PARDY”:
- P, D, Y; A in 2 → already out.

Next: “HARDY”:
- H, D, Y; A in 2 → already out.

Next: “GARDY”:
- G, D, Y; A in 2 → already out.

Next: “RADGY”:
- R in 1, A in 2 → A already can’t be in 2.

Next: “RABID”:
- R in 1, A in 2 → A already can’t be in 2.

Next: “RUDAY”:
- R in 1, A in 4 → valid positions:
   - A in 4, R in 1.
   - Letters: U, D, Y new.

Let’s use “RUDAY”.

Check:
- R in 1 (new position for R – allowed).
- A in 4 (new position for A – allowed).
- U, D, Y not yet tested.

From the latest feedback on RUMBA:

- R(-)  – R is in the word but not in position 1
- U(-) – U is in the word but not in position 2
- M(-) – M is in the word but not in position 3
- B(-) – B is in the word but not in position 4
- A(✓) – A is correctly in position 5

Combining with earlier deductions:

1. A is fixed in position 5  →  _ _ _ _ A
2. R is in the word but cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4  →  R must be in position 5, but position 5 is A.  This is impossible.

Wait – contradiction.  Earlier we thought R must be in position 1 because it was excluded from 2,3,4.  But now A is fixed in 5 and R cannot be in 1 (from RUMBA feedback), so R has no valid position.  That means our earlier deduction that R must be in position 1 was wrong.

Let’s re-examine:

From arose: A(-) R(-)  → A not in 1, R not in 2  
From trail: R(-) A(-)  → R not in 2, A not in 3  
From crank: R(-) A(-)  → R not in 3, A not in 4  
From ruday: R(-)  → R not in 1  
From rumba: R(-)  → R not in 1 (redundant)

So R cannot be in positions 1,2,3,4, but must be somewhere.  The only possible position is 5, but 5 is A.  This is impossible – the only explanation is that we mis-read the feedback.

Wait: in rumba, A(✓) means A is in position 5.  The feedback for R was R(-) – meaning R is in the word but not in position 1.  So R is still somewhere in 2,3,4 (but not 1 or 5).

But earlier we had:
- A cannot be in 1,3,4 (from arose, trail, crank)
- A is in 5 (now confirmed)
- So A is in 5 only.

So word pattern: _ _ _ _ A

Letters known to be in the word and their allowed positions:
R – cannot be in 1,2,3,4  → impossible, since 5 is A.  Therefore R must be in position 5, but 5 is A.  This suggests no solution, but Wordle words exist.

Realization: the feedback symbols are per-letter, not per-position.  Let me re-interpret:

From arose: A(-) – A is in word, but not in position 1  
R(-) – R is in word, but not in position 2  
From trail: R(-) – R is in word, but not in position 2 (same info)  
A(-) – A is in word, but not in position 3  
From crank: R(-) – R is in word, but not in position 3  
A(-) – A is in word, but not in position 4  
From ruday: R(-) – R is in word, but not in position 1  
U(-) – U is in word, but not in position 2  
A(-) – A is in word, but not in position 5 (but we just saw A is in 5 from rumba)

Wait, in rumba the feedback was:
R(-) U(-) M(-) B(-) A(✓)

The A(✓) clearly shows A is in position 5.

So:
- A is in position 5 (✓)
- R is in word but not in position 1 (from ruday) or 2 (from arose) or 3 (from trail or crank)
- So R must be in position 4
- U is in word but not in position 2
- M is in word but not in position 3
- B is in word but not in position 4

So current constraints:
- Word ends with A (position 5)
- R must be in position 4
- U, M, B are all in the word, but in unknown positions (2 or 3)
- Letters not in word: O,S,E,T,I,L,C,N,K,D,Y
- Remaining letters allowed: F,G,H,J,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z (but M,B,U already used)

So word pattern: _ _ R _ A with U and M and B in positions 1,2,3 (but R is in 4)

Wait, positions:
1 2 3 4 5
_ _ _ R A

U, M, B must occupy positions 1,2,3 (since 4 and 5 are R and A)

Possible permutations of U, M, B in 1,2,3:
- U M B
- U B M
- M U B
- M B U
- B U M
- B M U

We need to check which of these form valid 5-letter words ending in RA.

Check each permutation with possible first letters:

1. U M B R A –UMBRA – valid word (shadow)
2. U B M R A – not a word
3. M U B R A – not a word
4. M B U R A – not a word
5. B U M R A – not a word
6. B M U R A – not a word

Only valid candidate: UMBRA

Let’s verify:
- U in position 1 – feedback said U is in word but not in position 2 – position 1 is allowed
- M in position 2 – feedback said M is in word but not in position 3 – position 2 is allowed
- B in position 3 – feedback said B is in word but not in position 4 – position 3 is allowed
- R in position 4 – allowed (must be here)
- A in position 5 – correct (✓)

No disallowed letters used.

Therefore, the next guess is UMBRA.
