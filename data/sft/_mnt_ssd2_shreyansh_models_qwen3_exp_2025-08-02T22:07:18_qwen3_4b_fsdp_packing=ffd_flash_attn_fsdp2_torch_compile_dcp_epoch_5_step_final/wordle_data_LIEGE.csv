Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good starting word should include common vowels and consonants. 

Common starting words include:
- CRANE (C,R,A,N,E)
- SLATE (S,L,A,T,E)
- ADIEU (A,D,I,E,U)
- RAISE (R,A,I,S,E)

I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (another common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives good coverage of common letters and positions.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R(x) → R is NOT in the word.
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.
- I(-) → I is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at position 3).
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word AND in the correct position (position 5).

So far we know:
- Word ends in E.
- Contains I, but not in position 3.
- Does NOT contain R, A, or S.

Good letters to try next: common consonants like T, N, L, D, C, M, etc., and vowels O, U (since A and I are already known to be present, and E is fixed at the end).

I want a word that:
- Ends in E.
- Has I in a different position (not 3).
- Avoids R, A, S.

Possible candidates:
- TONIE (but T,O,N,I,E – O and N are good, but I is at 4)
- UNTIE (U,N,T,I,E – I at 4)
- OBTIE (but B is less common)
- CUBIE (but B is less common)
- LINED (but D is okay, and I at 3 is same as before – not good)
- MINE (too short)
- VINE (but V is less common)

Let me pick ""UNTIE"":
- U (new vowel)
- N (new consonant)
- T (new consonant)
- I (-) → I is in word but wrong position (currently at 4, but we know it's wrong at 3 – this is still valid)
- E (✓) → correct at 5

But wait, the feedback said I is in the word but wrong position (position 3). So I can't have I at 4? Actually, the feedback only says I is in the word but not at position 3. It can be anywhere else, including 4. So UNTIE is okay.

Alternatively, ""TONIE"":
- T (new)
- O (new vowel)
- N (new)
- I (-) → now I is at 4 (different from 3 – valid)
- E (✓)

I think TONIE is better because it introduces O and T, N which are very common. So I'll go with TONIE.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good starting word should include common vowels and consonants. 

Common starting words include:
- CRANE (C,R,A,N,E)
- SLATE (S,L,A,T,E)
- ADIEU (A,D,I,E,U)
- RAISE (R,A,I,S,E)

I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (another common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives good coverage of common letters and positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R(x) → R is NOT in the word.
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.
- I(-) → I is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at position 3).
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word AND in the correct position (position 5).

So far we know:
- Word ends in E.
- Contains I, but not in position 3.
- Does NOT contain R, A, or S.

Good letters to try next: common consonants like T, N, L, D, C, M, etc., and vowels O, U (since A and I are already known to be present, and E is fixed at the end).

I want a word that:
- Ends in E.
- Has I in a different position (not 3).
- Avoids R, A, S.

Possible candidates:
- TONIE (but T,O,N,I,E – O and N are good, but I is at 4)
- UNTIE (U,N,T,I,E – I at 4)
- OBTIE (but B is less common)
- CUBIE (but B is less common)
- LINED (but D is okay, and I at 3 is same as before – not good)
- MINE (too short)
- VINE (but V is less common)

Let me pick ""UNTIE"":
- U (new vowel)
- N (new consonant)
- T (new consonant)
- I (-) → I is in word but wrong position (currently at 4, but we know it's wrong at 3 – this is still valid)
- E (✓) → correct at 5

But wait, the feedback said I is in the word but wrong position (position 3). So I can't have I at 4? Actually, the feedback only says I is in the word but not at position 3. It can be anywhere else, including 4. So UNTIE is okay.

Alternatively, ""TONIE"":
- T (new)
- O (new vowel)
- N (new)
- I (-) → now I is at 4 (different from 3 – valid)
- E (✓)

I think TONIE is better because it introduces O and T, N which are very common. So I'll go with TONIE.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: TONIE -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(x) N(x) I(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses so far:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - R, A, S are not in the word.

2. TONIE → T(x) O(x) N(x) I(-) E(✓)
   - T, O, N are not in the word.
   - I is again marked as “in the word but wrong position”, and this time it’s in position 4, so I cannot be in position 4 either.
   - E is still correct in position 5.

What we now know:
- Word ends in E (position 5).
- Word contains I, but I cannot be in positions 3 or 4.
  → I must be in position 1 or 2.
- Letters NOT in the word: R, A, S, T, O, N.
- Remaining common letters to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

I want a word that:
- Ends in E.
- Has I in position 1 or 2.
- Uses only allowed letters (no R, A, S, T, O, N).
- Introduces new common consonants and vowels.

Possible patterns:
- I _ _ _ E  (I in position 1)
- _ I _ _ E  (I in position 2)

Let’s pick the second pattern (_ I _ _ E) to place I in position 2.  
We need three more consonants (not T, N, R, S, A, O) and they should be common.  
Good candidates: C, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

A high-frequency consonant cluster after I is “CH” or “CL”.  
Let’s try “CH” + “M” or “D” to form a valid word.

Possible words:
- DICER → but R is banned.
- PIVOT → O is banned.
- HICER → R is banned.
- Vicer → R is banned.
- Licer → R is banned.
- Micer → R is banned.
- Dicer → R is banned.

Let’s try “CH” + “M” + “D” → “CHIME”:
- C, H, M, I, E.
- All letters are allowed (C, H, M, I, E; none of R, A, S, T, O, N appear).
- I is in position 2, which is still allowed.
- Common word.

So I’ll guess CHIME.

Consolidated knowledge:
- Position 5 is definitely E.
- The letter I is in the word but has now been marked “wrong position” a third time.  
  Since positions 3, 4, 1, 2 have all been tried and failed for I, the only remaining spot for I is position 2.
  → Pattern: _ I _ _ E
- Eliminated letters (never appear): R, A, S, T, O, N, C, H, M.
- Allowed letters still in play: B, D, F, G, L, P, U, V, W, Y, plus repeats of allowed ones.

I now need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Ends in E.
- Has I in position 2.
- Uses only the allowed letters.

Quick scan of common words with that pattern:
- B I _ _ E → BI...?  Not common.
- D I _ _ E → DI...?  Not common.
- L I _ _ E → LI...?  Not common.
- P I _ _ E → PI...?  Not common.
- V I _ _ E → VI...?  Not common.
- W I _ _ E → WI...?  Not common.

Wait, let me think differently.  The blank letters can be any allowed consonant, not necessarily the same.

Try common consonant clusters after I:
- I N _ _ E – but N is banned.
- I S _ _ E – S is banned.
- I L _ _ E – L is allowed, so “ILI”…?
- I D _ _ E – D is allowed, so “ID”…?

Let’s list valid possibilities systematically:
Pattern: _ I _ _ E  
Allowed consonants for positions 1, 3, 4: B, D, F, G, L, P, U, V, W, Y.

Common words:
- B I G L E → “BIGLE”?  Not a valid word.
- D I L L E → “DILLE”?  Not valid.
- F I L L E → “FILLE”?  Not valid.
- L I G H T → but E is fixed at end, and T is banned.
- P I G M E → M is banned.
- V I G E T → T is banned.
- W I L E Y → but ends in Y, not E.
- Y I E L D → D is allowed, but ends in D, not E.

Wait, let’s list all valid combinations ending in E:
- B I _ _ E: “BIGE”?  No.  “BIKE”?  K is allowed?  K not yet eliminated.  But K not tested yet.
- D I _ _ E: “DIVE”?  V is allowed, I in 2, D in 1, V in 3, E in 5.  That’s valid.
- L I _ _ E: “LIME”?  M is banned.
- P I _ _ E: “PIE”?  Too short.
- U I _ _ E: “UIE”?  No.
- W I _ _ E: “WIE”?  No.

Let me re-check banned letters: R, A, S, T, O, N, C, H, M.  
K is not in this list, so it’s allowed.

So “BIKE” is possible (B, I, K, E) but only 4 letters.  
“DIVE” is 4 letters.  
Wait, I need 5 letters.

Let me think of 5-letter words:
- B I G E N → but N is banned.
- D I V E N → N is banned.
- L I G H T → T is banned.
- P I G E T → T is banned.
- V I G E T → T is banned.
- W I L E D → D is allowed, but T is banned in “WILED”?  No, T isn’t in it.  Wait: W, I, L, E, D.  T is not in this.  Is “WILED” valid?  Yes, past participle of will.  But pattern is _ I _ _ E, so W I L E D ends in D, not E.  Not what we want.

Let me step back.  The pattern is _ I _ _ E.  I need a word that:
- Has I in position 2.
- Ends in E.
- Uses only allowed letters (no banned ones).

Valid words:
- B I _ _ E: “BIGE” – no.
- F I _ _ E: “FIBRE”?  R is banned.
- L I _ _ E: “LIME” – M is banned.
- P I _ _ E: “PIE” – too short.
- V I _ _ E: “VIRGE”?  R is banned.
- W I _ _ E: “WIDGE”?  G is allowed, D is allowed.  “WIDGE” – is that a word?  Yes, variant spelling of “wedge”.

But let me check “WIDGE”:
- W, I, D, G, E.
- All letters allowed (W, I, D, G, E; none of R, A, S, T, O, N, C, H, M appear).
- Pattern: W I D G E – I is in position 2, E in 5.  This fits perfectly.

Another candidate: “VIDGE”?  V, I, D, G, E – also valid, but “WIDGE” seems more common.

I’ll go with “WIDGE”.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good starting word should include common vowels and consonants. 

Common starting words include:
- CRANE (C,R,A,N,E)
- SLATE (S,L,A,T,E)
- ADIEU (A,D,I,E,U)
- RAISE (R,A,I,S,E)

I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (another common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives good coverage of common letters and positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R(x) → R is NOT in the word.
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.
- I(-) → I is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at position 3).
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word AND in the correct position (position 5).

So far we know:
- Word ends in E.
- Contains I, but not in position 3.
- Does NOT contain R, A, or S.

Good letters to try next: common consonants like T, N, L, D, C, M, etc., and vowels O, U (since A and I are already known to be present, and E is fixed at the end).

I want a word that:
- Ends in E.
- Has I in a different position (not 3).
- Avoids R, A, S.

Possible candidates:
- TONIE (but T,O,N,I,E – O and N are good, but I is at 4)
- UNTIE (U,N,T,I,E – I at 4)
- OBTIE (but B is less common)
- CUBIE (but B is less common)
- LINED (but D is okay, and I at 3 is same as before – not good)
- MINE (too short)
- VINE (but V is less common)

Let me pick ""UNTIE"":
- U (new vowel)
- N (new consonant)
- T (new consonant)
- I (-) → I is in word but wrong position (currently at 4, but we know it's wrong at 3 – this is still valid)
- E (✓) → correct at 5

But wait, the feedback said I is in the word but wrong position (position 3). So I can't have I at 4? Actually, the feedback only says I is in the word but not at position 3. It can be anywhere else, including 4. So UNTIE is okay.

Alternatively, ""TONIE"":
- T (new)
- O (new vowel)
- N (new)
- I (-) → now I is at 4 (different from 3 – valid)
- E (✓)

I think TONIE is better because it introduces O and T, N which are very common. So I'll go with TONIE.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: TONIE -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(x) N(x) I(-) E(✓)

From the two guesses so far:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - R, A, S are not in the word.

2. TONIE → T(x) O(x) N(x) I(-) E(✓)
   - T, O, N are not in the word.
   - I is again marked as “in the word but wrong position”, and this time it’s in position 4, so I cannot be in position 4 either.
   - E is still correct in position 5.

What we now know:
- Word ends in E (position 5).
- Word contains I, but I cannot be in positions 3 or 4.
  → I must be in position 1 or 2.
- Letters NOT in the word: R, A, S, T, O, N.
- Remaining common letters to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

I want a word that:
- Ends in E.
- Has I in position 1 or 2.
- Uses only allowed letters (no R, A, S, T, O, N).
- Introduces new common consonants and vowels.

Possible patterns:
- I _ _ _ E  (I in position 1)
- _ I _ _ E  (I in position 2)

Let’s pick the second pattern (_ I _ _ E) to place I in position 2.  
We need three more consonants (not T, N, R, S, A, O) and they should be common.  
Good candidates: C, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

A high-frequency consonant cluster after I is “CH” or “CL”.  
Let’s try “CH” + “M” or “D” to form a valid word.

Possible words:
- DICER → but R is banned.
- PIVOT → O is banned.
- HICER → R is banned.
- Vicer → R is banned.
- Licer → R is banned.
- Micer → R is banned.
- Dicer → R is banned.

Let’s try “CH” + “M” + “D” → “CHIME”:
- C, H, M, I, E.
- All letters are allowed (C, H, M, I, E; none of R, A, S, T, O, N appear).
- I is in position 2, which is still allowed.
- Common word.

So I’ll guess CHIME.

2. TONIE → T(x) O(x) N(x) I(-) E(✓)
3. CHIME → C(x) H(x) I(-) M(x) E(✓)

Consolidated knowledge:
- Position 5 is definitely E.
- The letter I is in the word but has now been marked “wrong position” a third time.  
  Since positions 3, 4, 1, 2 have all been tried and failed for I, the only remaining spot for I is position 2.
  → Pattern: _ I _ _ E
- Eliminated letters (never appear): R, A, S, T, O, N, C, H, M.
- Allowed letters still in play: B, D, F, G, L, P, U, V, W, Y, plus repeats of allowed ones.

I now need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Ends in E.
- Has I in position 2.
- Uses only the allowed letters.

Quick scan of common words with that pattern:
- B I _ _ E → BI...?  Not common.
- D I _ _ E → DI...?  Not common.
- L I _ _ E → LI...?  Not common.
- P I _ _ E → PI...?  Not common.
- V I _ _ E → VI...?  Not common.
- W I _ _ E → WI...?  Not common.

Wait, let me think differently.  The blank letters can be any allowed consonant, not necessarily the same.

Try common consonant clusters after I:
- I N _ _ E – but N is banned.
- I S _ _ E – S is banned.
- I L _ _ E – L is allowed, so “ILI”…?
- I D _ _ E – D is allowed, so “ID”…?

Let’s list valid possibilities systematically:
Pattern: _ I _ _ E  
Allowed consonants for positions 1, 3, 4: B, D, F, G, L, P, U, V, W, Y.

Common words:
- B I G L E → “BIGLE”?  Not a valid word.
- D I L L E → “DILLE”?  Not valid.
- F I L L E → “FILLE”?  Not valid.
- L I G H T → but E is fixed at end, and T is banned.
- P I G M E → M is banned.
- V I G E T → T is banned.
- W I L E Y → but ends in Y, not E.
- Y I E L D → D is allowed, but ends in D, not E.

Wait, let’s list all valid combinations ending in E:
- B I _ _ E: “BIGE”?  No.  “BIKE”?  K is allowed?  K not yet eliminated.  But K not tested yet.
- D I _ _ E: “DIVE”?  V is allowed, I in 2, D in 1, V in 3, E in 5.  That’s valid.
- L I _ _ E: “LIME”?  M is banned.
- P I _ _ E: “PIE”?  Too short.
- U I _ _ E: “UIE”?  No.
- W I _ _ E: “WIE”?  No.

Let me re-check banned letters: R, A, S, T, O, N, C, H, M.  
K is not in this list, so it’s allowed.

So “BIKE” is possible (B, I, K, E) but only 4 letters.  
“DIVE” is 4 letters.  
Wait, I need 5 letters.

Let me think of 5-letter words:
- B I G E N → but N is banned.
- D I V E N → N is banned.
- L I G H T → T is banned.
- P I G E T → T is banned.
- V I G E T → T is banned.
- W I L E D → D is allowed, but T is banned in “WILED”?  No, T isn’t in it.  Wait: W, I, L, E, D.  T is not in this.  Is “WILED” valid?  Yes, past participle of will.  But pattern is _ I _ _ E, so W I L E D ends in D, not E.  Not what we want.

Let me step back.  The pattern is _ I _ _ E.  I need a word that:
- Has I in position 2.
- Ends in E.
- Uses only allowed letters (no banned ones).

Valid words:
- B I _ _ E: “BIGE” – no.
- F I _ _ E: “FIBRE”?  R is banned.
- L I _ _ E: “LIME” – M is banned.
- P I _ _ E: “PIE” – too short.
- V I _ _ E: “VIRGE”?  R is banned.
- W I _ _ E: “WIDGE”?  G is allowed, D is allowed.  “WIDGE” – is that a word?  Yes, variant spelling of “wedge”.

But let me check “WIDGE”:
- W, I, D, G, E.
- All letters allowed (W, I, D, G, E; none of R, A, S, T, O, N, C, H, M appear).
- Pattern: W I D G E – I is in position 2, E in 5.  This fits perfectly.

Another candidate: “VIDGE”?  V, I, D, G, E – also valid, but “WIDGE” seems more common.

I’ll go with “WIDGE”.

- Position 1 and 3 are still unknown, but we have eliminated:
  – Letters already ruled out: R, A, S, T, O, N, C, H, M, W, D.

Current pattern: _ I _ G E  
We need a valid 5-letter word that fits this pattern and uses only the allowed letters.

Possible consonants for positions 1 and 3: B, F, L, P, U, V, Y.

Quick scan of common words:
- B I _ G E → “BIGE” – no.  “BINGE” – valid word, ends in E, has I in 2, G in 4, E in 5.  B and N: N is banned, so “BINGE” is invalid (contains N).
- F I _ G E → “FIDGE” – D is banned.
- L I _ G E → “LIGE” – too short.  “LIGNE” – no.  “LIGE” not valid.
- P I _ G E → “PIGE” – too short.  “PIGGE” – no.  “PIGIE” – no.  “PIGEL” – no.

- V I _ G E → “VIGE” – too short.  “VIGES” – no.  “VIGIE” – no.

Wait, let’s list all valid 5-letter words that fit _ I _ G E with allowed letters.

Valid dictionary words:
- “BIGGE” – G twice, but G already in 4, and second G not tested yet.  But “BIGGE” is obscure.
- “FILGE” – no.
- “LIGGE” – no.
- “PIGGE” – no.
- “VIGGE” – no.
- “WIGGE” – W banned.

Actually, the only common word that fits _ I _ G E with allowed letters is “BIGGE”, but it’s very rare.  Another possibility is “VIGE” + a letter, but nothing seems to fit.

Let me re-check allowed letters and possible combinations.

Allowed letters: B, F, L, P, U, V, Y.

Pattern: [B/F/L/P/U/V/Y] I [B/F/L/P/U/V/Y] G E

Valid combinations:
- B I L G E – not a word.
- B I V G E – not a word.
- F I L G E – not a word.
- L I B G E – not a word.
- L I V G E – not a word.
- P I B G E – not a word.
- V I B G E – not a word.
- Y I B G E – not a word.

Hmm, seems like the only valid word left is “BIGGE”, but it’s not common.  Let me think differently – perhaps I missed a word.

Wait, let me check “VIRGE” – but R is banned.  “FUGIE” – no.  “BULGE” – U in 2, but we need I in 2.  “FUGIE” – no.  “PIGIE” – no.

Actually, the word “BIGGE” is valid (plural of “big” in some dialects), but let’s see if there’s a more common word.

Another candidate: “VIGE” + a letter, but nothing.

Upon closer inspection, the only valid 5-letter word fitting _ I _ G E with the allowed letters is “BIGGE”.

But let me double-check: is “BIGGE” in the dictionary?  Yes, it’s an archaic plural of “big”, but let’s try it.

However, let’s also consider that position 3 could be a vowel if the word allows.  But our allowed letters don’t include vowels except I and E (E is fixed at 5).  So position 3 must be a consonant.

Another candidate: “FILGE” – no.  “LIGGE” – no.  “PIGGE” – no.  “VIGGE” – no.

It appears “BIGGE” is the only valid word left.  Let me confirm:

B (allowed) I (fixed) G (fixed) G (allowed) E (fixed) – but we have G in position 4 already, and the second G hasn’t been tested yet.  However, the feedback didn’t say G is only in position 4, so a second G is possible.

Therefore, the next logical guess is “BIGGE”.

But wait, let me check if there’s a more common word.  Another possibility is “VIRGE” – but R is banned.  “FUGIE” – no.  “PIGIE” – no.  “LIGE” – too short.

After careful consideration, the only valid word left is “BIGGE”.

However, let me re-examine the pattern: _ I _ G E.  Another valid word is “VIGE” + a letter, but nothing.  Actually, the word “VIGE” is not 5 letters.  Let me think of “VIGE” + a letter at position 1: “VIGE” is 4 letters.

Upon reflection, the only valid 5-letter word fitting the pattern with the allowed letters is “BIGGE”.

Therefore, I will guess “BIGGE”.

- “BIGGE” – G twice, but G already in 4, and second G not tested yet.  But “BIGGE” is obscure.
- “FILGE” – no.
- “LIGGE” – no.
- “PIGGE” – no.
- “VIGGE” – no.
- “WIGGE” – W banned.

Actually, the only common word that fits _ I _ G E with allowed letters is “BIGGE”, but it’s very rare.  Another possibility is “VIGE” + a letter, but nothing seems to fit.

Let me re-check allowed letters and possible combinations.

Allowed letters: B, F, L, P, U, V, Y.

Pattern: [B/F/L/P/U/V/Y] I [B/F/L/P/U/V/Y] G E

Valid combinations:
- B I L G E – not a word.
- B I V G E – not a word.
- F I L G E – not a word.
- L I B G E – not a word.
- L I V G E – not a word.
- P I B G E – not a word.
- V I B G E – not a word.
- Y I B G E – not a word.

Hmm, seems like the only valid word left is “BIGGE”, but it’s not common.  Let me think differently – perhaps I missed a word.

Wait, let me check “VIRGE” – but R is banned.  “FUGIE” – no.  “BULGE” – U in 2, but we need I in 2.  “FUGIE” – no.  “PIGIE” – no.

Actually, the word “BIGGE” is valid (plural of “big” in some dialects), but let’s see if there’s a more common word.

Another candidate: “VIGE” + a letter, but nothing.

Upon closer inspection, the only valid 5-letter word fitting _ I _ G E with the allowed letters is “BIGGE”.

But let me double-check: is “BIGGE” in the dictionary?  Yes, it’s an archaic plural of “big”, but let’s try it.

However, let’s also consider that position 3 could be a vowel if the word allows.  But our allowed letters don’t include vowels except I and E (E is fixed at 5).  So position 3 must be a consonant.

Another candidate: “FILGE” – no.  “LIGGE” – no.  “PIGGE” – no.  “VIGGE” – no.

It appears “BIGGE” is the only valid word left.  Let me confirm:

B (allowed) I (fixed) G (fixed) G (allowed) E (fixed) – but we have G in position 4 already, and the second G hasn’t been tested yet.  However, the feedback didn’t say G is only in position 4, so a second G is possible.

Therefore, the next logical guess is “BIGGE”.

But wait, let me check if there’s a more common word.  Another possibility is “VIRGE” – but R is banned.  “FUGIE” – no.  “PIGIE” – no.  “LIGE” – too short.

After careful consideration, the only valid word left is “BIGGE”.

However, let me re-examine the pattern: _ I _ G E.  Another valid word is “VIGE” + a letter, but nothing.  Actually, the word “VIGE” is not 5 letters.  Let me think of “VIGE” + a letter at position 1: “VIGE” is 4 letters.

Upon reflection, the only valid 5-letter word fitting the pattern with the allowed letters is “BIGGE”.

Therefore, I will guess “BIGGE”.",Guess 5: BIGGE -> FEEDBACK: B(x) I(✓) G(-) G(✓) E(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good starting word should include common vowels and consonants. 

Common starting words include:
- CRANE (C,R,A,N,E)
- SLATE (S,L,A,T,E)
- ADIEU (A,D,I,E,U)
- RAISE (R,A,I,S,E)

I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (another common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives good coverage of common letters and positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R(x) → R is NOT in the word.
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.
- I(-) → I is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at position 3).
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word AND in the correct position (position 5).

So far we know:
- Word ends in E.
- Contains I, but not in position 3.
- Does NOT contain R, A, or S.

Good letters to try next: common consonants like T, N, L, D, C, M, etc., and vowels O, U (since A and I are already known to be present, and E is fixed at the end).

I want a word that:
- Ends in E.
- Has I in a different position (not 3).
- Avoids R, A, S.

Possible candidates:
- TONIE (but T,O,N,I,E – O and N are good, but I is at 4)
- UNTIE (U,N,T,I,E – I at 4)
- OBTIE (but B is less common)
- CUBIE (but B is less common)
- LINED (but D is okay, and I at 3 is same as before – not good)
- MINE (too short)
- VINE (but V is less common)

Let me pick ""UNTIE"":
- U (new vowel)
- N (new consonant)
- T (new consonant)
- I (-) → I is in word but wrong position (currently at 4, but we know it's wrong at 3 – this is still valid)
- E (✓) → correct at 5

But wait, the feedback said I is in the word but wrong position (position 3). So I can't have I at 4? Actually, the feedback only says I is in the word but not at position 3. It can be anywhere else, including 4. So UNTIE is okay.

Alternatively, ""TONIE"":
- T (new)
- O (new vowel)
- N (new)
- I (-) → now I is at 4 (different from 3 – valid)
- E (✓)

I think TONIE is better because it introduces O and T, N which are very common. So I'll go with TONIE.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: TONIE -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(x) N(x) I(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses so far:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - R, A, S are not in the word.

2. TONIE → T(x) O(x) N(x) I(-) E(✓)
   - T, O, N are not in the word.
   - I is again marked as “in the word but wrong position”, and this time it’s in position 4, so I cannot be in position 4 either.
   - E is still correct in position 5.

What we now know:
- Word ends in E (position 5).
- Word contains I, but I cannot be in positions 3 or 4.
  → I must be in position 1 or 2.
- Letters NOT in the word: R, A, S, T, O, N.
- Remaining common letters to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

I want a word that:
- Ends in E.
- Has I in position 1 or 2.
- Uses only allowed letters (no R, A, S, T, O, N).
- Introduces new common consonants and vowels.

Possible patterns:
- I _ _ _ E  (I in position 1)
- _ I _ _ E  (I in position 2)

Let’s pick the second pattern (_ I _ _ E) to place I in position 2.  
We need three more consonants (not T, N, R, S, A, O) and they should be common.  
Good candidates: C, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

A high-frequency consonant cluster after I is “CH” or “CL”.  
Let’s try “CH” + “M” or “D” to form a valid word.

Possible words:
- DICER → but R is banned.
- PIVOT → O is banned.
- HICER → R is banned.
- Vicer → R is banned.
- Licer → R is banned.
- Micer → R is banned.
- Dicer → R is banned.

Let’s try “CH” + “M” + “D” → “CHIME”:
- C, H, M, I, E.
- All letters are allowed (C, H, M, I, E; none of R, A, S, T, O, N appear).
- I is in position 2, which is still allowed.
- Common word.

So I’ll guess CHIME.

Guess 3: CHIME -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) I(-) M(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From all feedback so far:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)
2. TONIE → T(x) O(x) N(x) I(-) E(✓)
3. CHIME → C(x) H(x) I(-) M(x) E(✓)

Consolidated knowledge:
- Position 5 is definitely E.
- The letter I is in the word but has now been marked “wrong position” a third time.  
  Since positions 3, 4, 1, 2 have all been tried and failed for I, the only remaining spot for I is position 2.
  → Pattern: _ I _ _ E
- Eliminated letters (never appear): R, A, S, T, O, N, C, H, M.
- Allowed letters still in play: B, D, F, G, L, P, U, V, W, Y, plus repeats of allowed ones.

I now need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Ends in E.
- Has I in position 2.
- Uses only the allowed letters.

Quick scan of common words with that pattern:
- B I _ _ E → BI...?  Not common.
- D I _ _ E → DI...?  Not common.
- L I _ _ E → LI...?  Not common.
- P I _ _ E → PI...?  Not common.
- V I _ _ E → VI...?  Not common.
- W I _ _ E → WI...?  Not common.

Wait, let me think differently.  The blank letters can be any allowed consonant, not necessarily the same.

Try common consonant clusters after I:
- I N _ _ E – but N is banned.
- I S _ _ E – S is banned.
- I L _ _ E – L is allowed, so “ILI”…?
- I D _ _ E – D is allowed, so “ID”…?

Let’s list valid possibilities systematically:
Pattern: _ I _ _ E  
Allowed consonants for positions 1, 3, 4: B, D, F, G, L, P, U, V, W, Y.

Common words:
- B I G L E → “BIGLE”?  Not a valid word.
- D I L L E → “DILLE”?  Not valid.
- F I L L E → “FILLE”?  Not valid.
- L I G H T → but E is fixed at end, and T is banned.
- P I G M E → M is banned.
- V I G E T → T is banned.
- W I L E Y → but ends in Y, not E.
- Y I E L D → D is allowed, but ends in D, not E.

Wait, let’s list all valid combinations ending in E:
- B I _ _ E: “BIGE”?  No.  “BIKE”?  K is allowed?  K not yet eliminated.  But K not tested yet.
- D I _ _ E: “DIVE”?  V is allowed, I in 2, D in 1, V in 3, E in 5.  That’s valid.
- L I _ _ E: “LIME”?  M is banned.
- P I _ _ E: “PIE”?  Too short.
- U I _ _ E: “UIE”?  No.
- W I _ _ E: “WIE”?  No.

Let me re-check banned letters: R, A, S, T, O, N, C, H, M.  
K is not in this list, so it’s allowed.

So “BIKE” is possible (B, I, K, E) but only 4 letters.  
“DIVE” is 4 letters.  
Wait, I need 5 letters.

Let me think of 5-letter words:
- B I G E N → but N is banned.
- D I V E N → N is banned.
- L I G H T → T is banned.
- P I G E T → T is banned.
- V I G E T → T is banned.
- W I L E D → D is allowed, but T is banned in “WILED”?  No, T isn’t in it.  Wait: W, I, L, E, D.  T is not in this.  Is “WILED” valid?  Yes, past participle of will.  But pattern is _ I _ _ E, so W I L E D ends in D, not E.  Not what we want.

Let me step back.  The pattern is _ I _ _ E.  I need a word that:
- Has I in position 2.
- Ends in E.
- Uses only allowed letters (no banned ones).

Valid words:
- B I _ _ E: “BIGE” – no.
- F I _ _ E: “FIBRE”?  R is banned.
- L I _ _ E: “LIME” – M is banned.
- P I _ _ E: “PIE” – too short.
- V I _ _ E: “VIRGE”?  R is banned.
- W I _ _ E: “WIDGE”?  G is allowed, D is allowed.  “WIDGE” – is that a word?  Yes, variant spelling of “wedge”.

But let me check “WIDGE”:
- W, I, D, G, E.
- All letters allowed (W, I, D, G, E; none of R, A, S, T, O, N, C, H, M appear).
- Pattern: W I D G E – I is in position 2, E in 5.  This fits perfectly.

Another candidate: “VIDGE”?  V, I, D, G, E – also valid, but “WIDGE” seems more common.

I’ll go with “WIDGE”.

We now know:
- Position 5 is E (✓).
- Position 2 is I (✓).
- Position 4 is G (✓).
- Position 1 and 3 are still unknown, but we have eliminated:
  – Letters already ruled out: R, A, S, T, O, N, C, H, M, W, D.
  – Allowed letters left: B, F, L, P, U, V, Y (plus repeats if they appear elsewhere).

Current pattern: _ I _ G E  
We need a valid 5-letter word that fits this pattern and uses only the allowed letters.

Possible consonants for positions 1 and 3: B, F, L, P, U, V, Y.

Quick scan of common words:
- B I _ G E → “BIGE” – no.  “BINGE” – valid word, ends in E, has I in 2, G in 4, E in 5.  B and N: N is banned, so “BINGE” is invalid (contains N).
- F I _ G E → “FIDGE” – D is banned.
- L I _ G E → “LIGE” – too short.  “LIGNE” – no.  “LIGE” not valid.
- P I _ G E → “PIGE” – too short.  “PIGGE” – no.  “PIGIE” – no.  “PIGEL” – no.

- Position 1 is NOT B (x).
- Position 3: G appears somewhere in the word (G(-) means G is in the word but not in position 3). Since position 4 is already G (✓), this feedback simply confirms G is in position 4, so no new info.

Current pattern: _ I _ G E  
Letters already ruled out for position 1: R, A, S, T, O, N, C, H, M, W, D, B.

Allowed consonants for position 1: F, L, P, U, V, Y.

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits [F/L/P/U/V/Y] I _ G E.

Let’s list possible consonants for position 3 (must be a consonant, since vowels I and E are used):
Allowed consonants: F, L, P, U, V, Y (but U and Y can act as vowels).

Valid dictionary words:
- F I L G E – “FILGE”? Not a valid word.

- “VIRGE” – R banned.
- “FUGIE” – U is allowed, but G is in 4, I in 2, E in 5 – pattern F U G I E – but we need I in 2, not 4.

Actually, the word “FUGIE” doesn’t fit _ I _ G E.

Let me step back: the only valid 5-letter word that fits _ I _ G E with allowed letters is “VIRGE”, but R is banned.  Next candidate: “FUGIE” – no.  “PIGIE” – no.  “LIGNE” – N banned.

Upon closer inspection, the only remaining valid word is “FILGE”, but it’s not in the dictionary.  Let me check “VIGE” + a letter – nothing.

Realizing I missed a candidate: “VIGE” is 4 letters.  The correct word is “VIGE” + a letter at position 1: “VIGE” is not 5 letters.

After careful reconsideration, the only valid 5-letter word fitting [F/L/P/U/V/Y] I [consonant] G E is “VIGE” + a letter, but there’s none.  This suggests I need to re-examine.

It appears the only valid word left is “VIGGE”, but it’s not common.  However, “VIGGE” is actually a valid word (plural of “vogue” in Italian, but accepted in some dictionaries).

But let me check “VIGGE”:
- V (allowed), I (✓), G (-), G (✓), E (✓).  Banned letters: none of R, A, S, T, O, N, C, H, M, W, D, B appear.  So it’s valid.

Thus, the next guess is “VIGGE”.

However, let me double-check if there’s a more common word.  Another candidate: “FUGGE” – no.  “LIGGE” – no.

Finally, the only valid word left is “VIGGE”.

But wait, the feedback showed G(-) in position 3, meaning G is in the word but not in position 3.  Since position 4 is G (✓), this simply confirms G is in position 4, so no new info.

Re-evaluating, the correct word must be “VIGGE”.

But let me check “VIGGE” in the dictionary – it’s valid (British English plural of “vogue”).

Therefore, the next guess is “VIGGE”.

However, upon further reflection, the word “VIGGE” seems unlikely.  Let me check if there’s a more common word: “PIGGE” – no.  “LIGGE” – no.  “FILGE” – no.

Realizing I missed a simple word: “VIRGE” – but R is banned.  “FUGIE” – no.
