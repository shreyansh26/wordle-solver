### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- O is NOT in the word (x)
- S is in the correct position (✓) – so the word is _ _ _ S _
- E is NOT in the word (x)

Letters known to be in the word: A, S  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, O, E  
We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has S in the 4th position.
2. Contains A somewhere other than the 1st position.
3. Does NOT contain R, O, E.

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, etc.
Good vowels left to try: I, U (since A is already confirmed and O, E are ruled out).

A strong next guess would be a word that uses the confirmed A and S, and introduces new common letters. ""FAINT"" is a good candidate:
- F and T are new consonants.
- I is a new vowel.
- It places A in the 2nd position (different from the 1st position), satisfying the feedback.
- It does not use any ruled-out letters (R, O, E).

Another candidate could be ""MASTS"" but it repeats S which might not be ideal. ""PAINT"" is similar but uses I instead of A in the 2nd position. However, ""FAINT"" uses A in the 2nd position which is allowed.

I'll go with ""FAINT"".

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
   - S is fixed in 4th position: _ _ _ S _
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.

2. FAINT → F(x) A(-) I(x) N(x) T(x)
   - F, I, N, T are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 2.

So far:
- Letters confirmed in the word: A, S
- Letters confirmed NOT in the word: R, O, E, F, I, N, T
- S is in position 4: _ _ _ S _
- A must be in positions 3 or 5 (since it’s not in 1, 2).

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y
Remaining common vowels: U (A is already used)

Let’s try to place A in position 3 or 5 and fill the rest with unused common letters.

Option 1: A in position 3 → _ _ A S _
   But then A is in position 3 and S in 4, which would make the word end with “AS_”.  
   Possible candidates: “CABAS” (invalid – B and second A), “GASPS” (invalid – P, S already used).

Option 2: A in position 5 → _ _ _ S A
   This seems more promising.  
   We need two new consonants and one new vowel (if needed) for positions 1, 2, 3.

Let’s pick common letters: C, L, U (vowel), M, etc.

Candidate words:
- CLUSA – uses C, L, U, S, A (but U is not ruled out)
- GLADA – uses G, L, A, D, A (but D is unused)
- PLAUS – uses P, L, A, U, S (all letters are unused so far)

“PLAUS” is a valid word (though rare), so let’s try a more common word with the same idea: “CLASP” – but P is unused and S is already fixed. However, “CLASP” has S in position 4 and A in position 5, which fits our pattern.

Another check: letters used so far (confirmed not in word): R, O, E, F, I, N, T.  
“CLASP” uses C, L, A, S, P – none of the forbidden letters.

Thus, “CLASP” is a good next guess.
