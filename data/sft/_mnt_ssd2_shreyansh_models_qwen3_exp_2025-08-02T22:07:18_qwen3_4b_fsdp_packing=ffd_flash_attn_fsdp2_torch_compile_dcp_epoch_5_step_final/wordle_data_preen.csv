### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should cover several of these.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)

This gives us good coverage of frequently appearing letters in English words, which will help us narrow down possibilities efficiently based on the feedback.

From the feedback on “arose”:

- A(x) → A is not in the word.  
- R(✓) → R is in the word and in the correct second position.  
- O(x) → O is not in the word.  
- S(x) → S is not in the word.  
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ _  
- Letters to use: E (somewhere except 5th), plus any other consonants/vowels not yet ruled out.  
- Letters already excluded: A, O, S.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep R in position 2.
2. Include E in a different position.
3. Introduce new common letters not yet tested (T, L, N, etc.).

A strong candidate is “TREND”:
- T: new consonant.
- R: stays in position 2.
- E: moves to position 3 (allowed by the feedback).
- N, D: new consonants.

This tests new letters while respecting the constraints.

From the two guesses we have:

1. arose → A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - R is fixed in position 2.
   - E is somewhere in the word but not in position 5.

2. trend → T(x) R(✓) E(✓) N(-) D(x)
   - R is still in position 2 (✓).
   - E is now confirmed in position 3 (✓).
   - N is in the word but not in position 4.

So the pattern now looks like: _ R E _ _

Known letters:
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: E
- N is somewhere else (positions 1, 4, or 5)

Excluded letters so far: A, O, S, T, D.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has R in position 2
- Has E in position 3
- Contains N somewhere (not in position 4)
- Uses only letters not yet excluded

Possible candidates:
- N is in position 1: N R E _ _
- N is in position 5: _ R E _ N

Looking at common words:
- ""NERVE"" - N in 1, E in 3, R in 2, V and E in 4/5. But V hasn't been tested yet.
- ""CREPE"" - but T is excluded, and P hasn't been tested.
- ""PREEN"" - but N would be in position 5, E in 3, R in 2.

""PREEN"" seems good because:
- P is a new letter.
- R in 2 (✓), E in 3 (✓), N in 5 (allowed since N was only marked as wrong in position 4).
- All letters are valid so far.
