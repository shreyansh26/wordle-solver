- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback on AROSE:

""FRAKE"":

- GRADE: G, D are allowed. This seems good.
- TRAPE: T, P are allowed. But ""trape"" is not a common word.
- BRAVE: B, V are allowed. This is a valid word.
- GRAPE: G, P are allowed. This is a valid word.

Among these, ""GRADE"" and ""BRAVE"" are strong candidates. ""GRADE"" uses common letters and tests G and D. I'll go with GRADE first.

However, GRADE has G in position 1 and D in position 4. Let's verify:
- G: new letter.
- R: position 2 (✓).
- A: position 3 (✓).
- D: new letter.
- E: position 5 (✓).

No forbidden letters (O, S, C, N). So GRADE is valid.

But wait, in CRANE feedback, N was marked x, so GRADE has D which is allowed. GRADE seems correct.

Alternatively, BRAVE is also valid, but GRADE tests G and D. I'll go with GRADE.

- BRAVE: B, V are allowed. This is a valid word.
- GRAPE: G, P are allowed. This is a valid word.

Among these, ""GRADE"" and ""BRAVE"" are strong candidates. ""GRADE"" uses common letters and tests G and D. I'll go with GRADE first.

However, GRADE has G in position 1 and D in position 4. Let's verify:
- G: new letter.
- R: position 2 (✓).
- A: position 3 (✓).
- D: new letter.
- E: position 5 (✓).

No forbidden letters (O, S, C, N). So GRADE is valid.

But wait, in CRANE feedback, N was marked x, so GRADE has D which is allowed. GRADE seems correct.

Alternatively, BRAVE is also valid, but GRADE tests G and D. I'll go with GRADE.

Actually, let me double-check GRADE: G-R-A-D-E. Yes, this fits all constraints.

So the next guess is GRADE.

Current confirmed positions:

Common English words that fit:
- GRADE – already tried; D ruled out → invalid  
- GRATE – T is still allowed  
- GRAPE – P is still allowed  
- GRAVE – V is still allowed  

GRATE (G-R-A-T-E) is a common word and tests the letter T, which has not been used yet.  
Therefore GRATE is the logical next guess.
