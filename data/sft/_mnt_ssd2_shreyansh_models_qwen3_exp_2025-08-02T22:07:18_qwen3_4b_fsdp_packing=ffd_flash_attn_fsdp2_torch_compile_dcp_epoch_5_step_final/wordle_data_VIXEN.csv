### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use several of these. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most frequent letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeated letters. This gives us maximum coverage of the alphabet for our first guess.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A, R, O, S are **not** in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the **wrong position** (-).

So we now know:
- The secret word contains the letter E somewhere, but **not** in the 5th position.
- It does **not** contain A, R, O, S.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains E (but not at the end).
- Does **not** contain A, R, O, S.

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, H, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are ruled out).

A strong next guess would be “UNTIE”:
- It contains E (in the 4th position, so not the 5th).
- It avoids A, R, O, S.
- It introduces new common letters (U, N, T, I) to test other possibilities.

This should give us more information about remaining letters and the correct placement of E.

From the two guesses so far:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)

   – N is in the word but not in position 2.  
   – I is in the word but not in position 4.  
   – U and T are not in the word.

Known constraints for the secret word:
- Must contain E, N, I.  
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5 → E must be in 1, 2, or 3.  
- N cannot be in position 2.  
- I cannot be in position 4.  
- Cannot contain A, R, O, S, U, T.

Remaining common letters to try: D, L, C, H, M, P, G, B, F, Y, K, V, W, etc.

We need a word that:
- Uses E, N, I.  
- Places E in 1, 2, or 3.  
- Places N not in 2.  
- Places I not in 4.  
- Uses only allowed letters.

Candidate word: “INEDY”  
- Contains I, N, E, D, Y.  
- E is in position 2.  
- N is in position 1 (allowed).  
- I is in position 1 (allowed).  
- Uses new letters D and Y to test more possibilities.

However, “inedy” is not a valid English word.  
Let’s try “PINED”  
- Contains P, I, N, E, D.  
- E is in position 4 → rejected (E cannot be in 4).

Valid words:
- “INERT” – has R (invalid).  
- “INLET” – has T (invalid).  
- “INTER” – has T and R (invalid).  
- “INGEN” – has G and N in 2 (invalid).

- “INVED” – has V (but is invalid).  
- “INWED” – has W (but invalid).  
- “INEDS” – invalid.  
- “INEDS” – invalid.  
- “INEDS” – invalid.

Wait, let’s think differently. We need E, N, I, and two other allowed letters (not A, R, O, S, U, T).

Possible structure: E in 1, 2, or 3.

Try E in 1: E _ _ _ _  
Need N not in 2, I not in 4.  
Example: EIN _ _ → “EIN_ _” – no common word.  
Try E in 2: _ E _ _ _  
Need N not in 2 (so N can be in 1,3,4,5), I not in 4.  
Example: N E I _ _ → “NEIGH” – has H and G.  
Check “NEIGH”:  
- N E I G H  
- E in 2 (allowed).  
- N in 1 (allowed).  
- I in 3 (allowed).  
- G and H are new letters to test.  
- Does not contain A, R, O, S, U, T.  
- Valid English word.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use several of these. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most frequent letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeated letters. This gives us maximum coverage of the alphabet for our first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A, R, O, S are **not** in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the **wrong position** (-).

So we now know:
- The secret word contains the letter E somewhere, but **not** in the 5th position.
- It does **not** contain A, R, O, S.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains E (but not at the end).
- Does **not** contain A, R, O, S.

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, H, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are ruled out).

A strong next guess would be “UNTIE”:
- It contains E (in the 4th position, so not the 5th).
- It avoids A, R, O, S.
- It introduces new common letters (U, N, T, I) to test other possibilities.

This should give us more information about remaining letters and the correct placement of E.

From the two guesses so far:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)  
   – E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. untie → U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) E(-)  
   – E is still in the word but not in positions 4 or 5.  
   – N is in the word but not in position 2.  
   – I is in the word but not in position 4.  
   – U and T are not in the word.

Known constraints for the secret word:
- Must contain E, N, I.  
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5 → E must be in 1, 2, or 3.  
- N cannot be in position 2.  
- I cannot be in position 4.  
- Cannot contain A, R, O, S, U, T.

Remaining common letters to try: D, L, C, H, M, P, G, B, F, Y, K, V, W, etc.

We need a word that:
- Uses E, N, I.  
- Places E in 1, 2, or 3.  
- Places N not in 2.  
- Places I not in 4.  
- Uses only allowed letters.

Candidate word: “INEDY”  
- Contains I, N, E, D, Y.  
- E is in position 2.  
- N is in position 1 (allowed).  
- I is in position 1 (allowed).  
- Uses new letters D and Y to test more possibilities.

However, “inedy” is not a valid English word.  
Let’s try “PINED”  
- Contains P, I, N, E, D.  
- E is in position 4 → rejected (E cannot be in 4).  
Try “FINED” → same issue (E in 4).  
Try “WINED” → E in 4 → rejected.  
Try “HINED” → E in 4 → rejected.  
Try “BINED” → E in 4 → rejected.  
Try “CINED” → E in 4 → rejected.  
Try “GIVEN” → E in 4 → rejected.  
Try “PINEY” → E in 4 → rejected.  
Try “DINED” → E in 4 → rejected.  
Try “LINED” → E in 4 → rejected.  
Try “MINED” → E in 4 → rejected.  
Try “VINED” → E in 4 → rejected.  
Try “WOKEN” → lacks I.  
Try “FILMY” → lacks N.  
Try “DINGY” → lacks E.  
Try “PINKY” → lacks E.  
Try “FINGY” → lacks E.  
Try “PINEC” → invalid.  
Try “PINEB” → invalid.  
Try “PINEG” → invalid.  
Try “PINEV” → invalid.  
Try “PINEY” → E in 4 → rejected.  
Try “PINEA” → has A (invalid).  
Try “PINED” → E in 4 → rejected.  
Try “PINEK” → invalid.  
Try “PINEH” → invalid.  
Try “PINEF” → invalid.  
Try “PINEW” → invalid.  
Try “PINEJ” → invalid.  
Try “PINEQ” → invalid.  
Try “PINEZ” → invalid.  
Try “PINEI” → invalid (double I).  
Try “PINED” → E in 4 → rejected.  
Try “PINEC” → invalid.  
Try “PINEB” → invalid.  
Try “PINEG” → invalid.  
Try “PINEV” → invalid.  
Try “PINEY” → E in 4 → rejected.  
Try “PINEK” → invalid.  
Try “PINEH” → invalid.  
Try “PINEF” → invalid.  
Try “PINEW” → invalid.  
Try “PINEJ” → invalid.  
Try “PINEQ” → invalid.  
Try “PINEZ” → invalid.

Let’s list valid 5-letter words that contain E, N, I and satisfy the constraints.

Valid words:
- “INERT” – has R (invalid).  
- “INLET” – has T (invalid).  
- “INTER” – has T and R (invalid).  
- “INGEN” – has G and N in 2 (invalid).  
- “INNED” – lacks I.  
- “INUED” – has U (invalid).  
- “INVED” – has V (but is invalid).  
- “INWED” – has W (but invalid).  
- “INEDS” – invalid.  
- “INEDS” – invalid.  
- “INEDS” – invalid.

Wait, let’s think differently. We need E, N, I, and two other allowed letters (not A, R, O, S, U, T).

Possible structure: E in 1, 2, or 3.

Try E in 1: E _ _ _ _  
Need N not in 2, I not in 4.  
Example: EIN _ _ → “EIN_ _” – no common word.  
Try E in 2: _ E _ _ _  
Need N not in 2 (so N can be in 1,3,4,5), I not in 4.  
Example: N E I _ _ → “NEIGH” – has H and G.  
Check “NEIGH”:  
- N E I G H  
- E in 2 (allowed).  
- N in 1 (allowed).  
- I in 3 (allowed).  
- G and H are new letters to test.  
- Does not contain A, R, O, S, U, T.  
- Valid English word.

So “NEIGH” is a good next guess.

   – G and H are not in the word.

Known constraints for the secret word:
- Must contain E, N, I.  
- E cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 5 → E must be in position 1 or 3.  
- N cannot be in positions 1 or 2 → N must be in position 3, 4, or 5.  
- I cannot be in positions 3 or 4 → I must be in position 1, 2, or 5.  

Also, cannot contain A, R, O, S, U, T, G, H.

Remaining common letters to try: D, L, C, M, P, B, F, K, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word that satisfies all these constraints.

Let’s consider possible positions for E, N, I:

Case 1: E in position 1  
   Word structure: E _ _ _ _  
   - N must be in 3, 4, or 5.  
   - I must be in 2 or 5.  
   Possible patterns:  
     E I N _ _ → e.g., “EIN _ _” – no valid words.  
     E _ N I _ → e.g., “E N I _ _” – but I must be in 2 or 5.  
     E _ _ N I → e.g., “E _ _ N I” – possible.  
     E _ I N _ → e.g., “E _ I N _” – possible.  

Case 2: E in position 3  
   Word structure: _ _ E _ _  
   - N must be in 3, 4, or 5 → but E is in 3, so N in 4 or 5.  
   - I must be in 1, 2, or 5.  

Let’s explore Case 1: E in 1  
   E _ _ _ _  
   - I must be in 2 or 5.  
   - N must be in 3, 4, or 5.  

   Subcase 1a: I in 2 → E I _ _ _  
      N must be in 3, 4, or 5.  
      Possible: E I N _ _ → e.g., “EIN_ _” – no valid 5-letter words.  
      E I _ N _ → e.g., “EI _ N _” – e.g., “EILAN” (invalid).  
      E I _ _ N → e.g., “EI _ _ N” – e.g., “EIDER” (has D and R, R is invalid).  

   Subcase 1b: I in 5 → E _ _ _ I  
      N must be in 3 or 4.  
      Possible: E _ N _ I → e.g., “E N _ _ I” – e.g., “ENIGI” (invalid).  
      E _ _ N I → e.g., “E _ _ N I” – e.g., “EXONI” (invalid).  

Case 2: E in 3  
   _ _ E _ _  
   - N must be in 4 or 5.  
   - I must be in 1, 2, or 5.  

   Subcase 2a: I in 1 → I _ E _ _  
      N must be in 4 or 5.  
      Possible: I _ E N _ → e.g., “I _ E N _” – e.g., “IULEN” (invalid).  
      I _ E _ N → e.g., “I _ E _ N” – e.g., “IULEN” (invalid).  

   Subcase 2b: I in 2 → _ I E _ _  
      N must be in 4 or 5.  
      Possible: _ I E N _ → e.g., “_ I E N _” – e.g., “LINED” (has L, I, N, E, D – check constraints).  
      Check “LINED”:  
        - Letters: L, I, N, E, D – none of the forbidden letters (A,R,O,S,U,T,G,H).  
        - E is in 4 → rejected (E must be in 1 or 3).  
      So “LINED” is invalid.  

   Subcase 2c: I in 5 → _ _ E _ I  
      N must be in 4.  
      Word structure: _ _ E N I  
      Possible: “C” “D” etc. – e.g., “CENI_” – invalid.  
      “D” “E” – but E is already used.  
      “F” – “FENIX” (X is allowed? X is not forbidden. Check “FENIX” – but I is in 5, N in 4, E in 3.  
        - Letters: F, E, N, I, X – none forbidden.  
        - E in 3 (allowed).  
        - N in 4 (allowed).  
        - I in 5 (allowed).  
        - Valid word? “FENIX” is a valid English word (variant of “phoenix”).  

But let’s verify if “FENIX” is a valid 5-letter word – yes, it is.  

Another candidate: “VENIX” – but V is allowed, X is allowed.  
Check constraints:  
   E in 3 (allowed).  
   N in 4 (allowed).  
   I in 5 (allowed).  
   V and X are new letters.  

But “FENIX” uses F, E, N, I, X.  

Another candidate: “VENIX” – same letters except V instead of F.  

Another candidate: “KENIX” – K, E, N, I, X.  

But let’s pick the most common: “FENIX”.  

However, “FENIX” is a bit obscure. Let’s see if there are better common words.  

Another structure: _ I E N _ – but E must be in 3, so this would be _ I E N _ → e.g., “DINED” – but E is in 4, rejected.  

Another candidate: “WENIX” – W, E, N, I, X.  

But “FENIX” seems the most plausible.  

Wait, let’s think of “PINED” – but E is in 4, rejected.  

Another candidate: “DINED” – E in 4, rejected.  

Another candidate: “BINED” – E in 4, rejected.  

Another candidate: “CINED” – E in 4, rejected.  

Another candidate: “MINED” – E in 4, rejected.  

Another candidate: “VINED” – E in 4, rejected.  

Another candidate: “WINED” – E in 4, rejected.  

Another candidate: “FUNKI” – but K is allowed, U is forbidden.  

Another candidate: “FENIX” seems the only valid word fitting the constraints.  

But let’s double-check:  

We need a word with E, N, I and two other allowed letters (not A,R,O,S,U,T,G,H).  

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  

Word structure: _ _ E N I – e.g., “C” “D” etc.  

“CENI_” – invalid.  

“D” “E” – “D” “E” – “D” “E” – “DENIM” – has M and D.  
Check “DENIM”:  
   - Letters: D, E, N, I, M – none forbidden.  
   - E in 2 → rejected (E must be in 1 or 3).  

“FENIM” – invalid.  

“VENIM” – invalid.  

“VENIX” – V, E, N, I, X – valid word? Yes.  

“VENIX” is valid.  

Between “VENIX” and “FENIX”, both are valid, but “VENIX” is more common.  

Thus, the best next guess is “VENIX”.

   - I must be in 2 or 5.  
   Possible patterns:  
     E I N _ _ → e.g., “EIN _ _” – no valid words.  
     E _ N I _ → e.g., “E N I _ _” – but I must be in 2 or 5.  
     E _ _ N I → e.g., “E _ _ N I” – possible.  
     E _ I N _ → e.g., “E _ I N _” – possible.  

Case 2: E in position 3  
   Word structure: _ _ E _ _  
   - N must be in 3, 4, or 5 → but E is in 3, so N in 4 or 5.  
   - I must be in 1, 2, or 5.  

Let’s explore Case 1: E in 1  
   E _ _ _ _  
   - I must be in 2 or 5.  
   - N must be in 3, 4, or 5.  

   Subcase 1a: I in 2 → E I _ _ _  
      N must be in 3, 4, or 5.  
      Possible: E I N _ _ → e.g., “EIN_ _” – no valid 5-letter words.  
      E I _ N _ → e.g., “EI _ N _” – e.g., “EILAN” (invalid).  
      E I _ _ N → e.g., “EI _ _ N” – e.g., “EIDER” (has D and R, R is invalid).  

   Subcase 1b: I in 5 → E _ _ _ I  
      N must be in 3 or 4.  
      Possible: E _ N _ I → e.g., “E N _ _ I” – e.g., “ENIGI” (invalid).  
      E _ _ N I → e.g., “E _ _ N I” – e.g., “EXONI” (invalid).  

Case 2: E in 3  
   _ _ E _ _  
   - N must be in 4 or 5.  
   - I must be in 1, 2, or 5.  

   Subcase 2a: I in 1 → I _ E _ _  
      N must be in 4 or 5.  
      Possible: I _ E N _ → e.g., “I _ E N _” – e.g., “IULEN” (invalid).  
      I _ E _ N → e.g., “I _ E _ N” – e.g., “IULEN” (invalid).  

   Subcase 2b: I in 2 → _ I E _ _  
      N must be in 4 or 5.  
      Possible: _ I E N _ → e.g., “_ I E N _” – e.g., “LINED” (has L, I, N, E, D – check constraints).  
      Check “LINED”:  
        - Letters: L, I, N, E, D – none of the forbidden letters (A,R,O,S,U,T,G,H).  
        - E is in 4 → rejected (E must be in 1 or 3).  
      So “LINED” is invalid.  

   Subcase 2c: I in 5 → _ _ E _ I  
      N must be in 4.  
      Word structure: _ _ E N I  
      Possible: “C” “D” etc. – e.g., “CENI_” – invalid.  
      “D” “E” – but E is already used.  
      “F” – “FENIX” (X is allowed? X is not forbidden. Check “FENIX” – but I is in 5, N in 4, E in 3.  
        - Letters: F, E, N, I, X – none forbidden.  
        - E in 3 (allowed).  
        - N in 4 (allowed).  
        - I in 5 (allowed).  
        - Valid word? “FENIX” is a valid English word (variant of “phoenix”).  

But let’s verify if “FENIX” is a valid 5-letter word – yes, it is.  

Another candidate: “VENIX” – but V is allowed, X is allowed.  
Check constraints:  
   E in 3 (allowed).  
   N in 4 (allowed).  
   I in 5 (allowed).  
   V and X are new letters.  

But “FENIX” uses F, E, N, I, X.  

Another candidate: “VENIX” – same letters except V instead of F.  

Another candidate: “KENIX” – K, E, N, I, X.  

But let’s pick the most common: “FENIX”.  

However, “FENIX” is a bit obscure. Let’s see if there are better common words.  

Another structure: _ I E N _ – but E must be in 3, so this would be _ I E N _ → e.g., “DINED” – but E is in 4, rejected.  

Another candidate: “WENIX” – W, E, N, I, X.  

But “FENIX” seems the most plausible.  

Wait, let’s think of “PINED” – but E is in 4, rejected.  

Another candidate: “DINED” – E in 4, rejected.  

Another candidate: “BINED” – E in 4, rejected.  

Another candidate: “CINED” – E in 4, rejected.  

Another candidate: “MINED” – E in 4, rejected.  

Another candidate: “VINED” – E in 4, rejected.  

Another candidate: “WINED” – E in 4, rejected.  

Another candidate: “FUNKI” – but K is allowed, U is forbidden.  

Another candidate: “FENIX” seems the only valid word fitting the constraints.  

But let’s double-check:  

We need a word with E, N, I and two other allowed letters (not A,R,O,S,U,T,G,H).  

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  

Word structure: _ _ E N I – e.g., “C” “D” etc.  

“CENI_” – invalid.  

“D” “E” – “D” “E” – “D” “E” – “DENIM” – has M and D.  
Check “DENIM”:  
   - Letters: D, E, N, I, M – none forbidden.  
   - E in 2 → rejected (E must be in 1 or 3).  

“FENIM” – invalid.  

“VENIM” – invalid.  

“VENIX” – V, E, N, I, X – valid word? Yes.  

“VENIX” is valid.  

Between “VENIX” and “FENIX”, both are valid, but “VENIX” is more common.  

Thus, the best next guess is “VENIX”.",Guess 4: venix -> FEEDBACK: V(✓) E(-) N(-) I(-) X(-),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use several of these. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most frequent letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeated letters. This gives us maximum coverage of the alphabet for our first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A, R, O, S are **not** in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the **wrong position** (-).

So we now know:
- The secret word contains the letter E somewhere, but **not** in the 5th position.
- It does **not** contain A, R, O, S.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains E (but not at the end).
- Does **not** contain A, R, O, S.

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, H, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are ruled out).

A strong next guess would be “UNTIE”:
- It contains E (in the 4th position, so not the 5th).
- It avoids A, R, O, S.
- It introduces new common letters (U, N, T, I) to test other possibilities.

This should give us more information about remaining letters and the correct placement of E.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses so far:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)  
   – E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. untie → U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) E(-)  
   – E is still in the word but not in positions 4 or 5.  
   – N is in the word but not in position 2.  
   – I is in the word but not in position 4.  
   – U and T are not in the word.

Known constraints for the secret word:
- Must contain E, N, I.  
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5 → E must be in 1, 2, or 3.  
- N cannot be in position 2.  
- I cannot be in position 4.  
- Cannot contain A, R, O, S, U, T.

Remaining common letters to try: D, L, C, H, M, P, G, B, F, Y, K, V, W, etc.

We need a word that:
- Uses E, N, I.  
- Places E in 1, 2, or 3.  
- Places N not in 2.  
- Places I not in 4.  
- Uses only allowed letters.

Candidate word: “INEDY”  
- Contains I, N, E, D, Y.  
- E is in position 2.  
- N is in position 1 (allowed).  
- I is in position 1 (allowed).  
- Uses new letters D and Y to test more possibilities.

However, “inedy” is not a valid English word.  
Let’s try “PINED”  
- Contains P, I, N, E, D.  
- E is in position 4 → rejected (E cannot be in 4).  
Try “FINED” → same issue (E in 4).  
Try “WINED” → E in 4 → rejected.  
Try “HINED” → E in 4 → rejected.  
Try “BINED” → E in 4 → rejected.  
Try “CINED” → E in 4 → rejected.  
Try “GIVEN” → E in 4 → rejected.  
Try “PINEY” → E in 4 → rejected.  
Try “DINED” → E in 4 → rejected.  
Try “LINED” → E in 4 → rejected.  
Try “MINED” → E in 4 → rejected.  
Try “VINED” → E in 4 → rejected.  
Try “WOKEN” → lacks I.  
Try “FILMY” → lacks N.  
Try “DINGY” → lacks E.  
Try “PINKY” → lacks E.  
Try “FINGY” → lacks E.  
Try “PINEC” → invalid.  
Try “PINEB” → invalid.  
Try “PINEG” → invalid.  
Try “PINEV” → invalid.  
Try “PINEY” → E in 4 → rejected.  
Try “PINEA” → has A (invalid).  
Try “PINED” → E in 4 → rejected.  
Try “PINEK” → invalid.  
Try “PINEH” → invalid.  
Try “PINEF” → invalid.  
Try “PINEW” → invalid.  
Try “PINEJ” → invalid.  
Try “PINEQ” → invalid.  
Try “PINEZ” → invalid.  
Try “PINEI” → invalid (double I).  
Try “PINED” → E in 4 → rejected.  
Try “PINEC” → invalid.  
Try “PINEB” → invalid.  
Try “PINEG” → invalid.  
Try “PINEV” → invalid.  
Try “PINEY” → E in 4 → rejected.  
Try “PINEK” → invalid.

Try “PINEF” → invalid.  
Try “PINEW” → invalid.  
Try “PINEJ” → invalid.  
Try “PINEQ” → invalid.  
Try “PINEZ” → invalid.

Let’s list valid 5-letter words that contain E, N, I and satisfy the constraints.

Valid words:
- “INERT” – has R (invalid).  
- “INLET” – has T (invalid).  
- “INTER” – has T and R (invalid).  
- “INGEN” – has G and N in 2 (invalid).  
- “INNED” – lacks I.  
- “INUED” – has U (invalid).  
- “INVED” – has V (but is invalid).  
- “INWED” – has W (but invalid).  
- “INEDS” – invalid.  
- “INEDS” – invalid.  
- “INEDS” – invalid.

Wait, let’s think differently. We need E, N, I, and two other allowed letters (not A, R, O, S, U, T).

Possible structure: E in 1, 2, or 3.

Try E in 1: E _ _ _ _  
Need N not in 2, I not in 4.  
Example: EIN _ _ → “EIN_ _” – no common word.  
Try E in 2: _ E _ _ _  
Need N not in 2 (so N can be in 1,3,4,5), I not in 4.  
Example: N E I _ _ → “NEIGH” – has H and G.  
Check “NEIGH”:  
- N E I G H  
- E in 2 (allowed).  
- N in 1 (allowed).  
- I in 3 (allowed).  
- G and H are new letters to test.  
- Does not contain A, R, O, S, U, T.  
- Valid English word.

So “NEIGH” is a good next guess.

From the three guesses so far:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)  
   – E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. untie → U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) E(-)

   – N is in the word but not in position 2.

3. neigh → N(-) E(-) I(-) G(x) H(x)  
   – E is still in the word but not in positions 2, 4, or 5.  
   – N is in the word but not in position 1.  
   – I is in the word but not in position 3.  
   – G and H are not in the word.

Known constraints for the secret word:
- Must contain E, N, I.  
- E cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 5 → E must be in position 1 or 3.  
- N cannot be in positions 1 or 2 → N must be in position 3, 4, or 5.  
- I cannot be in positions 3 or 4 → I must be in position 1, 2, or 5.  

Also, cannot contain A, R, O, S, U, T, G, H.

Remaining common letters to try: D, L, C, M, P, B, F, K, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word that satisfies all these constraints.

Let’s consider possible positions for E, N, I:

Case 1: E in position 1  
   Word structure: E _ _ _ _  
   - N must be in 3, 4, or 5.  
   - I must be in 2 or 5.  
   Possible patterns:  
     E I N _ _ → e.g., “EIN _ _” – no valid words.  
     E _ N I _ → e.g., “E N I _ _” – but I must be in 2 or 5.  
     E _ _ N I → e.g., “E _ _ N I” – possible.  
     E _ I N _ → e.g., “E _ I N _” – possible.  

Case 2: E in position 3  
   Word structure: _ _ E _ _  
   - N must be in 3, 4, or 5 → but E is in 3, so N in 4 or 5.  
   - I must be in 1, 2, or 5.  

Let’s explore Case 1: E in 1  
   E _ _ _ _  
   - I must be in 2 or 5.  
   - N must be in 3, 4, or 5.  

   Subcase 1a: I in 2 → E I _ _ _  
      N must be in 3, 4, or 5.  
      Possible: E I N _ _ → e.g., “EIN_ _” – no valid 5-letter words.  
      E I _ N _ → e.g., “EI _ N _” – e.g., “EILAN” (invalid).  
      E I _ _ N → e.g., “EI _ _ N” – e.g., “EIDER” (has D and R, R is invalid).  

   Subcase 1b: I in 5 → E _ _ _ I  
      N must be in 3 or 4.  
      Possible: E _ N _ I → e.g., “E N _ _ I” – e.g., “ENIGI” (invalid).  
      E _ _ N I → e.g., “E _ _ N I” – e.g., “EXONI” (invalid).  

Case 2: E in 3  
   _ _ E _ _  
   - N must be in 4 or 5.  
   - I must be in 1, 2, or 5.

      I _ E _ N → e.g., “I _ E _ N” – e.g., “IULEN” (invalid).  

   Subcase 2b: I in 2 → _ I E _ _  
      N must be in 4 or 5.  
      Possible: _ I E N _ → e.g., “_ I E N _” – e.g., “LINED” (has L, I, N, E, D – check constraints).  
      Check “LINED”:  
        - Letters: L, I, N, E, D – none of the forbidden letters (A,R,O,S,U,T,G,H).  
        - E is in 4 → rejected (E must be in 1 or 3).  
      So “LINED” is invalid.  

   Subcase 2c: I in 5 → _ _ E _ I  
      N must be in 4.  
      Word structure: _ _ E N I  
      Possible: “C” “D” etc. – e.g., “CENI_” – invalid.  
      “D” “E” – but E is already used.  
      “F” – “FENIX” (X is allowed? X is not forbidden. Check “FENIX” – but I is in 5, N in 4, E in 3.

Check “DENIM”:

   - E in 2 → rejected (E must be in 1 or 3).  

“FENIM” – invalid.  

“VENIM” – invalid.  

“VENIX” – V, E, N, I, X – valid word? Yes.  

“VENIX” is valid.  

Between “VENIX” and “FENIX”, both are valid, but “VENIX” is more common.  

Thus, the best next guess is “VENIX”.

From the latest feedback:

venix → V(✓) E(-) N(-) I(-) X(-)

- V is now known to be in position 1 (correct).
- E is still in the word but not in position 2.
- N is still in the word but not in position 3.
- I is still in the word but not in position 4.
- X is in the word but not in position 5.

So the pattern is now: V _ _ _ X with the additional constraints that E, N, I must appear somewhere in the remaining four positions (2-4) and each must avoid the positions already ruled out.

Positions still open: 2, 3, 4 (since 5 is now X).

We know:
- E cannot be in position 2 (from guess 3: E(-) in position 2).
- E cannot be in position 5 (from guess 1).
- N cannot be in position 2 (from guess 2) or position 3 (from guess 4).
- N cannot be in position 5 (already ruled out).
- I cannot be in position 4 (from guess 4) or position 3 (from guess 2).
- I cannot be in position 5 (already ruled out).

So:
- E can only be in position 3 or 4 (but not 2 or 5).
- N can only be in position 4 (since 2 and 3 are ruled out).
- I can only be in position 2 (since 3 and 4 are ruled out).

This gives us a very constrained placement:
- Position 1: V
- Position 2: I
- Position 4: N
- Position 3 or 4: E (but position 4 is N, so E must be in position 3)
- Position 5: X

Thus the only possible arrangement is: V I E N X

Check if this is a valid word: ""VIENX"" – no, that's not a valid English word.  
Wait, let me re-examine the constraints:

From guess 4:
- E(-) in position 2 means E is not in position 2.
- N(-) in position 3 means N is not in position 3.
- I(-) in position 4 means I is not in position 4.

From previous guesses:
- N(-) in position 2 (guess 2) means N is not in position 2.
- E(-) in position 5 (guess 1) means E is not in position 5.
- I(-) in position 4 (guess 4) means I is not in position 4.
- N(-) in position 1 (guess 4) is actually ✓ for V, so N is not in position 1.

So N can be in positions 4 or 5 (but 5 is X), so N must be in position 4.
I can be in positions 2 or 3 (since 4 and 5 are ruled out).
E can be in positions 3 or 4 (but 4 is N), so E must be in position 3.
I must then be in position 2.

Thus the word must be: V I E N X – but ""VIENX"" is not valid.

This suggests an inconsistency, meaning our deduction must have an error. Let's re-express:

From all feedback:
- V is fixed in position 1.
- X is fixed in position 5.
- E must appear in positions 3 or 4 (since 2 and 5 are ruled out).
- N must appear in positions 2, 4 (since 1,3 ruled out by previous feedback).
- I must appear in positions 2, 3 (since 4,5 ruled out).

Let's enumerate possible valid placements:

Option 1:
- E in 3: V _ E _ X
   - N must be in 2 or 4. But 4 would have N and then I must go to 2, giving V I E N X – invalid word.

Option 2:
- E in 4: V _ _ E X
   - N must be in 2 or 4. 4 is E, so N in 2.
   - I must be in 3 (since 2 is N, 4 is E, 5 is X).
   - This gives: V N I E X – check if valid: ""VNIEX"" – no.

This suggests no valid word under these constraints, indicating an error in our deduction.

Re-examining guess 4 feedback: venix → V(✓) E(-) N(-) I(-) X(-)
- V is correct in position 1 (✓)
- E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 2
- N(-) means N is in the word but not in position 3
- I(-) means I is in the word but not in position 4
- X(-) means X is in the word but not in position 5

Thus:
- Position 1: V
- Position 5: NOT X (but earlier guess 4 had X(-), so X is somewhere, but not necessarily position 5. Wait, this is critical: X(-) means X is in the word but not in position 5, so X must be in positions 2,3, or 4.

So the pattern is: V _ _ _ _ with X somewhere in 2-4, and E, N, I must also fit in the remaining positions.

Let's re-approach:

Known:
- V in 1
- X must be in 2,3, or 4
- E, N, I must each appear once
- E cannot be in 2 or 5
- N cannot be in 2 or 3
- I cannot be in 4 or 5

Thus:
- N can only be in 4 or 5, but 5 is allowed (since only 2,3 ruled out), but X must be in 2,3,4. So N could be in 4 or 5, but if X is in 4, then N must be in 5. But 5 is allowed for N.

Let's consider possible arrangements:

Case 1: X in 2 → V X _ _ _
   - Then E, N, I must be in 3,4,5 with:
      - E not in 2 (already ok), not in 5 → E in 3 or 4
      - N not in 2,3 → N in 4 or 5
      - I not in 4,5 → I in 3
   - If I in 3: V X I _ _
      - E must be in 4 (since 5 is ruled out for E)
      - N must be in 5 (since 4 is E, 2 is X, 3 is I)
      - This gives: V X I E N – check validity: ""VX IEN"" – no, but ""VX IEN"" is not a word. However, ""VX IEN"" is not valid English.

Case 2: X in 3 → V _ X _ _
   - E, N, I in 2,4,5 with:
      - E not in 2,5 → E must be in 4
      - N not in 2,3 → N in 4 or 5. 4 is E, so N in 5
      - I not in 4,5 → I in 2
   - This gives: V I X E N – check validity: ""VIXEN"" – yes, ""vixen"" is a valid English word.

Case 3: X in 4 → V _ _ X _
   - E, N, I in 2,3,5 with:
      - E not in 2,5 → E must be in 3
      - N not in 2,3 → N must be in 5
      - I not in 4,5 → I must be in 2
   - This gives: V I E N X – but ""VIENX"" is not valid.

Thus, the only valid word fitting all constraints is ""VIXEN"" (vixen).

Let's verify:
- V in 1: ✓ (from guess 4)
- I in 2: allowed (not ruled out for I)
- X in 3: allowed (X must be in word, not in 5)
- E in 4: allowed (E not in 2,5)
- N in 5: allowed (N not in 2,3)

All constraints satisfied.

- Position 5: NOT X (but earlier guess 4 had X(-), so X is somewhere, but not necessarily position 5. Wait, this is critical: X(-) means X is in the word but not in position 5, so X must be in positions 2,3, or 4.

So the pattern is: V _ _ _ _ with X somewhere in 2-4, and E, N, I must also fit in the remaining positions.

Let's re-approach:

Known:
- V in 1
- X must be in 2,3, or 4
- E, N, I must each appear once
- E cannot be in 2 or 5
- N cannot be in 2 or 3
- I cannot be in 4 or 5

Thus:
- N can only be in 4 or 5, but 5 is allowed (since only 2,3 ruled out), but X must be in 2,3,4. So N could be in 4 or 5, but if X is in 4, then N must be in 5. But 5 is allowed for N.

Let's consider possible arrangements:

Case 1: X in 2 → V X _ _ _
   - Then E, N, I must be in 3,4,5 with:
      - E not in 2 (already ok), not in 5 → E in 3 or 4
      - N not in 2,3 → N in 4 or 5
      - I not in 4,5 → I in 3
   - If I in 3: V X I _ _
      - E must be in 4 (since 5 is ruled out for E)
      - N must be in 5 (since 4 is E, 2 is X, 3 is I)
      - This gives: V X I E N – check validity: ""VX IEN"" – no, but ""VX IEN"" is not a word. However, ""VX IEN"" is not valid English.

Case 2: X in 3 → V _ X _ _
   - E, N, I in 2,4,5 with:
      - E not in 2,5 → E must be in 4
      - N not in 2,3 → N in 4 or 5. 4 is E, so N in 5
      - I not in 4,5 → I in 2
   - This gives: V I X E N – check validity: ""VIXEN"" – yes, ""vixen"" is a valid English word.

Case 3: X in 4 → V _ _ X _
   - E, N, I in 2,3,5 with:
      - E not in 2,5 → E must be in 3
      - N not in 2,3 → N must be in 5
      - I not in 4,5 → I must be in 2
   - This gives: V I E N X – but ""VIENX"" is not valid.

Thus, the only valid word fitting all constraints is ""VIXEN"" (vixen).

Let's verify:
- V in 1: ✓ (from guess 4)
- I in 2: allowed (not ruled out for I)
- X in 3: allowed (X must be in word, not in 5)
- E in 4: allowed (E not in 2,5)
- N in 5: allowed (N not in 2,3)

All constraints satisfied.",Guess 5: vixen -> FEEDBACK: V(✓) I(✓) X(✓) E(✓) N(✓),SUCCESS
