For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The best starting words typically include common vowels and consonants.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should cover several of these.

Some excellent starting words include:
- AROSE (covers A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)

I'll go with **AROSE** as it includes 4 of the top 5 most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives us good coverage for vowels and common consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct first position (✓)
- R is not in the word at all (x)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S and E are not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. Word starts with A
2. Contains O somewhere after the first letter
3. Does not contain R, S, or E
4. Does not contain the letters R, S, E (and we already know A and O are present)

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are already present)

I want a word that:
- Starts with A
- Has O somewhere in positions 2-5
- Avoids R, S, E
- Uses new letters to maximize information

Possible candidates:
- ADOBO (but has two O's and B)
- ALLOY (but has two O's and L)
- ANGOL (but has N, G, O, L - but O is in position 4)
- AFOOT (but has two O's and T)
- ABODE (but has E which is excluded)
- ADOPT (but has P, T)

Let me pick **ADOPT**:
- Starts with A
- Has O in position 3
- Uses new letters P and T
- Avoids R, S, E
- Uses D which wasn't in the previous guess

This should help determine if O is in position 3, and test P, T, D.

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(✓) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ADOPT → A(✓) D(x) O(-) P(x) T(x)

What we know so far:
1. The word starts with A (A is in position 1 and correct).
2. The letter O is present but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (from ADOPT feedback: O(-) in position 3, and in AROSE feedback: O(-) in position 3 as well). Wait, that seems contradictory. Let me re-read carefully.

Actually, in AROSE, O was in position 3 and marked (-) - meaning O is in the word but NOT in position 3. In ADOPT, O was again in position 3 and marked (-) - same conclusion. So O is somewhere else (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5) but NOT position 3. But position 1 is already A, so O must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

Also:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E, D, P, T
- Letters still possible: A (position 1), O (somewhere else), plus any remaining letters not yet tested: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a word that:
- Starts with A
- Contains O in position 2, 4, or 5 (since 3 is ruled out and 1 is A)
- Avoids R, S, E, D, P, T
- Uses new letters to gather more info

Possible positions for O:
- Position 2: A O _ _ _
- Position 4: A _ _ O _
- Position 5: A _ _ _ O

Good consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, V, W, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and O are present)

Let's try to pick a word that tests new consonants and positions O.

Option 1: A O _ _ _ (O in position 2)
Need valid words like AUDIO, AFOUL, etc. But AUDIO has U and D (D is out), AFOUL has F, U, L - but U is okay, F and L are new.

Option 2: A _ _ O _ (O in position 4)
Words like AMBIT (but T is out), ANGOL (L is new, but G is new), AULIC (C is new), etc.

Option 3: A _ _ _ O (O in position 5)
Words like AULIC (but ends with C), ABHOR (R is out), AMMON (N is new), ABBOT (T is out), etc.

Let's pick **AUDIO**:
- Starts with A
- O in position 2
- Uses new letters U, I
- Avoids all excluded letters (R, S, E, D, P, T)

But wait - D is excluded, and AUDIO has D? No, AUDIO is A-U-D-I-O, which includes D (from ADOPT feedback D(x)), so D is out. So AUDIO is invalid.

Next option: **AULIC** (A U L I C)
- Starts with A
- O is not present here - we need to include O. So this is invalid.

Next: **AMBIT** - has T (out), invalid.

Next: **ANGOL** - but this is a proper noun (Spanish for ""angry""), might not be valid.

Next: **AFOUL** - A F O U L
- Starts with A
- O in position 3 - but we know O cannot be in position 3 (from both guesses marking O(-) in position 3). So this is invalid.

Next: **AULICA** - invalid (not 5 letters).

Let me rethink with O in position 4 or 5.

Try **AULIC** - but no O.

Wait, we need O in position 2, 4, or 5.

Let's try **AULIC** - no O.

Alternative: **ABHOR** - R is out.

**ACORN** - R is out.

**ACOUST** - S, T are out.

**AFRAID** - R, D, P, T are out (but P isn't in this word, D is out).

**AFLOAT** - T is out.

**AMONG** - G is new, O in position 4
- A M O N G
- Starts with A
- O in position 3 - but we know O cannot be in position 3. So invalid.

**AMONG** has O in position 3 - ruled out.

**AFOUL** - O in position 3 - ruled out.

**AULIC** - no O.

**AQUAM** - not valid.

**AUROR** - R is out.

**AURIC** - C is new, O is not present.

This is tricky. Let me list valid 5-letter words starting with A, containing O, avoiding R, S, E, D, P, T, with O in position 2, 4, or 5.

Possible O positions:
- Position 2: A O _ _ _
  - AOGRE - invalid
  - AONIC - invalid
  - AORIC - invalid
  - AOVIC - invalid
  - AOWLS - S is out
  - AOXID - D is out
  - AOPYL - invalid
  - AORID - D is out
  - AONIC - invalid
  - AOVIC - invalid
  - AOWED - D is out
  - AOKED - D is out
  - AONED - D is out

  - AORID - D is out
  - AOWED - D is out
  - AOKED - D is out
  - AONED - D is out
  - AOPED - D is out

- Position 4: A _ _ O _
  - ABBOT - T is out
  - ABHOT - T is out
  - ACHOO - C, H, O are new, but O in position 4
  - ACHOR - R is out
  - ACHOW - W is new

  - ARBOR - R is out
  - ASHOK - S is out
  - ASTRO - S, T, R are out

  - ARBOR - R is out
  - ASHOK - S is out
  - ASTRO - S, T, R are out
  - AUGUR - R is out

- AGLOW (G, L, O are new, O in position 4)
- ANGOL (A, N, G, O, L - O in position 4)

- AHOJO - J, H, O are new, O in position 5
- AHOKO - K, H, O are new, O in position 5
- AMOKO - M, K, O are new, O in position 5
- ANGOL - already listed

Let's pick **AGLOW**:
- Starts with A
- G, L, O are new letters
- O is in position 4
- Avoids all excluded letters (R, S, E, D, P, T)

This should help determine the position of O and test G and L.

- The word starts with A.
- O is in the word but NOT in positions 3 (from both guesses).
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E, D, P, T.
- Remaining letters to test: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, U, V, W, etc.

I need a word that:
- Starts with A
- Contains O in position 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is ruled out)
- Avoids R, S, E, D, P, T
- Uses new letters to gather more information

A good candidate is **AGLOW**:
- Starts with A
- Contains O in position 4
- Uses new letters G, L, O (O's position is tested here)
- Avoids all excluded letters

<guess>AGLOW</guess>",AGLOW,"From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(✓) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ADOPT → A(✓) D(x) O(-) P(x) T(x)

What we know so far:
1. The word starts with A (A is in position 1 and correct).
2. The letter O is present but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (from ADOPT feedback: O(-) in position 3, and in AROSE feedback: O(-) in position 3 as well). Wait, that seems contradictory. Let me re-read carefully.

Actually, in AROSE, O was in position 3 and marked (-) - meaning O is in the word but NOT in position 3. In ADOPT, O was again in position 3 and marked (-) - same conclusion. So O is somewhere else (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5) but NOT position 3. But position 1 is already A, so O must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

Also:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E, D, P, T
- Letters still possible: A (position 1), O (somewhere else), plus any remaining letters not yet tested: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a word that:
- Starts with A
- Contains O in position 2, 4, or 5 (since 3 is ruled out and 1 is A)
- Avoids R, S, E, D, P, T
- Uses new letters to gather more info

Possible positions for O:
- Position 2: A O _ _ _
- Position 4: A _ _ O _
- Position 5: A _ _ _ O

Good consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, V, W, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and O are present)

Let's try to pick a word that tests new consonants and positions O.

Option 1: A O _ _ _ (O in position 2)
Need valid words like AUDIO, AFOUL, etc. But AUDIO has U and D (D is out), AFOUL has F, U, L - but U is okay, F and L are new.

Option 2: A _ _ O _ (O in position 4)
Words like AMBIT (but T is out), ANGOL (L is new, but G is new), AULIC (C is new), etc.

Option 3: A _ _ _ O (O in position 5)
Words like AULIC (but ends with C), ABHOR (R is out), AMMON (N is new), ABBOT (T is out), etc.

Let's pick **AUDIO**:
- Starts with A
- O in position 2
- Uses new letters U, I
- Avoids all excluded letters (R, S, E, D, P, T)

But wait - D is excluded, and AUDIO has D? No, AUDIO is A-U-D-I-O, which includes D (from ADOPT feedback D(x)), so D is out. So AUDIO is invalid.

Next option: **AULIC** (A U L I C)
- Starts with A
- O is not present here - we need to include O. So this is invalid.

Next: **AMBIT** - has T (out), invalid.

Next: **ANGOL** - but this is a proper noun (Spanish for ""angry""), might not be valid.

Next: **AFOUL** - A F O U L
- Starts with A
- O in position 3 - but we know O cannot be in position 3 (from both guesses marking O(-) in position 3). So this is invalid.

Next: **AULICA** - invalid (not 5 letters).

Let me rethink with O in position 4 or 5.

Try **AULIC** - but no O.

Wait, we need O in position 2, 4, or 5.

Let's try **AULIC** - no O.

Alternative: **ABHOR** - R is out.

**ACORN** - R is out.

**ACOUST** - S, T are out.

**AFRAID** - R, D, P, T are out (but P isn't in this word, D is out).

**AFLOAT** - T is out.

**AMONG** - G is new, O in position 4
- A M O N G
- Starts with A
- O in position 3 - but we know O cannot be in position 3. So invalid.

**AMONG** has O in position 3 - ruled out.

**AFOUL** - O in position 3 - ruled out.

**AULIC** - no O.

**AQUAM** - not valid.

**AUROR** - R is out.

**AURIC** - C is new, O is not present.

This is tricky. Let me list valid 5-letter words starting with A, containing O, avoiding R, S, E, D, P, T, with O in position 2, 4, or 5.

Possible O positions:
- Position 2: A O _ _ _

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The best starting words typically include common vowels and consonants.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should cover several of these.

Some excellent starting words include:
- AROSE (covers A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)

I'll go with **AROSE** as it includes 4 of the top 5 most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives us good coverage for vowels and common consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct first position (✓)
- R is not in the word at all (x)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S and E are not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. Word starts with A
2. Contains O somewhere after the first letter
3. Does not contain R, S, or E
4. Does not contain the letters R, S, E (and we already know A and O are present)

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are already present)

I want a word that:
- Starts with A
- Has O somewhere in positions 2-5
- Avoids R, S, E
- Uses new letters to maximize information

Possible candidates:
- ADOBO (but has two O's and B)
- ALLOY (but has two O's and L)
- ANGOL (but has N, G, O, L - but O is in position 4)
- AFOOT (but has two O's and T)
- ABODE (but has E which is excluded)
- ADOPT (but has P, T)

Let me pick **ADOPT**:
- Starts with A
- Has O in position 3
- Uses new letters P and T
- Avoids R, S, E
- Uses D which wasn't in the previous guess

This should help determine if O is in position 3, and test P, T, D.

Let me re-read carefully.\n\nActually, in AROSE, O was in position 3 and marked (-) - meaning O is in the word but NOT in position 3. In ADOPT, O was again in position 3 and marked (-) - same conclusion. So O is somewhere else (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5) but NOT position 3. But position 1 is already A, so O must be in position 2, 4, or 5.\n\nAlso:\n- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E, D, P, T\n- Letters still possible: A (position 1), O (somewhere else), plus any remaining letters not yet tested: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nWe need a word that:\n- Starts with A\n- Contains O in position 2, 4, or 5 (since 3 is ruled out and 1 is A)\n- Avoids R, S, E, D, P, T\n- Uses new letters to gather more info\n\nPossible positions for O:\n- Position 2: A O _ _ _\n- Position 4: A _ _ O _\n- Position 5: A _ _ _ O\n\nGood consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, V, W, etc.\nGood vowels left: I, U (since A and O are present)\n\nLet\'s try to pick a word that tests new consonants and positions O.\n\nOption 1: A O _ _ _ (O in position 2)\nNeed valid words like AUDIO, AFOUL, etc. But AUDIO has U and D (D is out), AFOUL has F, U, L - but U is okay, F and L are new.\n\nOption 2: A _ _ O _ (O in position 4)\nWords like AMBIT (but T is out), ANGOL (L is new, but G is new), AULIC (C is new), etc.\n\nOption 3: A _ _ _ O (O in position 5)\nWords like AULIC (but ends with C), ABHOR (R is out), AMMON (N is new), ABBOT (T is out), etc.\n\nLet\'s pick **AUDIO**:\n- Starts with A\n- O in position 2\n- Uses new letters U, I\n- Avoids all excluded letters (R, S, E, D, P, T)\n\nBut wait - D is excluded, and AUDIO has D? No, AUDIO is A-U-D-I-O, which includes D (from ADOPT feedback D(x)), so D is out. So AUDIO is invalid.\n\nNext option: **AULIC** (A U L I C)\n- Starts with A\n- O is not present here - we need to include O. So this is invalid.\n\nNext: **AMBIT** - has T (out), invalid.\n\nNext: **ANGOL** - but this is a proper noun (Spanish for ""angry""), might not be valid.\n\nNext: **AFOUL** - A F O U L\n- Starts with A\n- O in position 3 - but we know O cannot be in position 3 (from both guesses marking O(-) in position 3). So this is invalid.\n\nNext: **AULICA** - invalid (not 5 letters).\n\nLet me rethink with O in position 4 or 5.\n\nTry **AULIC** - but no O.\n\nWait, we need O in position 2, 4, or 5.\n\nLet\'s try **AULIC** - no O.\n\nAlternative: **ABHOR** - R is out.\n\n**ACORN** - R is out.\n\n**ACOUST** - S, T are out.\n\n**AFRAID** - R, D, P, T are out (but P isn\'t in this word, D is out).\n\n**AFLOAT** - T is out.\n\n**AMONG** - G is new, O in position 4\n- A M O N G\n- Starts with A\n- O in position 3 - but we know O cannot be in position 3.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The best starting words typically include common vowels and consonants.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should cover several of these.

Some excellent starting words include:
- AROSE (covers A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)

I'll go with **AROSE** as it includes 4 of the top 5 most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives us good coverage for vowels and common consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct first position (✓)
- R is not in the word at all (x)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S and E are not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. Word starts with A
2. Contains O somewhere after the first letter
3. Does not contain R, S, or E
4. Does not contain the letters R, S, E (and we already know A and O are present)

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are already present)

I want a word that:
- Starts with A
- Has O somewhere in positions 2-5
- Avoids R, S, E
- Uses new letters to maximize information

Possible candidates:
- ADOBO (but has two O's and B)
- ALLOY (but has two O's and L)
- ANGOL (but has N, G, O, L - but O is in position 4)
- AFOOT (but has two O's and T)
- ABODE (but has E which is excluded)
- ADOPT (but has P, T)

Let me pick **ADOPT**:
- Starts with A
- Has O in position 3
- Uses new letters P and T
- Avoids R, S, E
- Uses D which wasn't in the previous guess

This should help determine if O is in position 3, and test P, T, D.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ADOPT -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) D(x) O(-) P(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(✓) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ADOPT → A(✓) D(x) O(-) P(x) T(x)

What we know so far:
1. The word starts with A (A is in position 1 and correct).
2. The letter O is present but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (from ADOPT feedback: O(-) in position 3, and in AROSE feedback: O(-) in position 3 as well). Wait, that seems contradictory. Let me re-read carefully.

Actually, in AROSE, O was in position 3 and marked (-) - meaning O is in the word but NOT in position 3. In ADOPT, O was again in position 3 and marked (-) - same conclusion. So O is somewhere else (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5) but NOT position 3. But position 1 is already A, so O must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

Also:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E, D, P, T
- Letters still possible: A (position 1), O (somewhere else), plus any remaining letters not yet tested: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a word that:
- Starts with A
- Contains O in position 2, 4, or 5 (since 3 is ruled out and 1 is A)
- Avoids R, S, E, D, P, T
- Uses new letters to gather more info

Possible positions for O:
- Position 2: A O _ _ _
- Position 4: A _ _ O _
- Position 5: A _ _ _ O

Good consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, V, W, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and O are present)

Let's try to pick a word that tests new consonants and positions O.

Option 1: A O _ _ _ (O in position 2)
Need valid words like AUDIO, AFOUL, etc. But AUDIO has U and D (D is out), AFOUL has F, U, L - but U is okay, F and L are new.

Option 2: A _ _ O _ (O in position 4)
Words like AMBIT (but T is out), ANGOL (L is new, but G is new), AULIC (C is new), etc.

Option 3: A _ _ _ O (O in position 5)
Words like AULIC (but ends with C), ABHOR (R is out), AMMON (N is new), ABBOT (T is out), etc.

Let's pick **AUDIO**:
- Starts with A
- O in position 2
- Uses new letters U, I
- Avoids all excluded letters (R, S, E, D, P, T)

But wait - D is excluded, and AUDIO has D? No, AUDIO is A-U-D-I-O, which includes D (from ADOPT feedback D(x)), so D is out. So AUDIO is invalid.

Next option: **AULIC** (A U L I C)
- Starts with A
- O is not present here - we need to include O. So this is invalid.

Next: **AMBIT** - has T (out), invalid.

Next: **ANGOL** - but this is a proper noun (Spanish for ""angry""), might not be valid.

Next: **AFOUL** - A F O U L
- Starts with A
- O in position 3 - but we know O cannot be in position 3 (from both guesses marking O(-) in position 3). So this is invalid.

Next: **AULICA** - invalid (not 5 letters).

Let me rethink with O in position 4 or 5.

Try **AULIC** - but no O.

Wait, we need O in position 2, 4, or 5.

Let's try **AULIC** - no O.

Alternative: **ABHOR** - R is out.

**ACORN** - R is out.

**ACOUST** - S, T are out.

**AFRAID** - R, D, P, T are out (but P isn't in this word, D is out).

**AFLOAT** - T is out.

**AMONG** - G is new, O in position 4
- A M O N G
- Starts with A
- O in position 3 - but we know O cannot be in position 3. So invalid.

**AMONG** has O in position 3 - ruled out.

**AFOUL** - O in position 3 - ruled out.

**AULIC** - no O.

**AQUAM** - not valid.

**AUROR** - R is out.

**AURIC** - C is new, O is not present.

This is tricky. Let me list valid 5-letter words starting with A, containing O, avoiding R, S, E, D, P, T, with O in position 2, 4, or 5.

Possible O positions:
- Position 2: A O _ _ _
  - AOGRE - invalid
  - AONIC - invalid
  - AORIC - invalid

Let's pick **AGLOW**:

- G, L, O are new letters
- O is in position 4
- Avoids all excluded letters (R, S, E, D, P, T)

This should help determine the position of O and test G and L.From the feedback so far:
- The word starts with A.
- O is in the word but NOT in positions 3 (from both guesses).
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E, D, P, T.
- Remaining letters to test: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, U, V, W, etc.

I need a word that:
- Starts with A
- Contains O in position 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is ruled out)
- Avoids R, S, E, D, P, T
- Uses new letters to gather more information

A good candidate is **AGLOW**:

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The best starting words typically include common vowels and consonants.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should cover several of these.

Some excellent starting words include:
- AROSE (covers A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)

I'll go with **AROSE** as it includes 4 of the top 5 most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives us good coverage for vowels and common consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct first position (✓)
- R is not in the word at all (x)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S and E are not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. Word starts with A
2. Contains O somewhere after the first letter
3. Does not contain R, S, or E
4. Does not contain the letters R, S, E (and we already know A and O are present)

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are already present)

I want a word that:
- Starts with A
- Has O somewhere in positions 2-5
- Avoids R, S, E
- Uses new letters to maximize information

Possible candidates:
- ADOBO (but has two O's and B)
- ALLOY (but has two O's and L)
- ANGOL (but has N, G, O, L - but O is in position 4)
- AFOOT (but has two O's and T)
- ABODE (but has E which is excluded)
- ADOPT (but has P, T)

Let me pick **ADOPT**:
- Starts with A
- Has O in position 3
- Uses new letters P and T
- Avoids R, S, E
- Uses D which wasn't in the previous guess

This should help determine if O is in position 3, and test P, T, D.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ADOPT -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) D(x) O(-) P(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(✓) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ADOPT → A(✓) D(x) O(-) P(x) T(x)

What we know so far:
1. The word starts with A (A is in position 1 and correct).
2. The letter O is present but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (from ADOPT feedback: O(-) in position 3, and in AROSE feedback: O(-) in position 3 as well). Wait, that seems contradictory. Let me re-read carefully.

Actually, in AROSE, O was in position 3 and marked (-) - meaning O is in the word but NOT in position 3. In ADOPT, O was again in position 3 and marked (-) - same conclusion. So O is somewhere else (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5) but NOT position 3. But position 1 is already A, so O must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

Also:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E, D, P, T
- Letters still possible: A (position 1), O (somewhere else), plus any remaining letters not yet tested: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a word that:
- Starts with A
- Contains O in position 2, 4, or 5 (since 3 is ruled out and 1 is A)
- Avoids R, S, E, D, P, T
- Uses new letters to gather more info

Possible positions for O:
- Position 2: A O _ _ _
- Position 4: A _ _ O _
- Position 5: A _ _ _ O

Good consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, V, W, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and O are present)

Let's try to pick a word that tests new consonants and positions O.

Option 1: A O _ _ _ (O in position 2)
Need valid words like AUDIO, AFOUL, etc. But AUDIO has U and D (D is out), AFOUL has F, U, L - but U is okay, F and L are new.

Option 2: A _ _ O _ (O in position 4)
Words like AMBIT (but T is out), ANGOL (L is new, but G is new), AULIC (C is new), etc.

Option 3: A _ _ _ O (O in position 5)
Words like AULIC (but ends with C), ABHOR (R is out), AMMON (N is new), ABBOT (T is out), etc.

Let's pick **AUDIO**:
- Starts with A
- O in position 2
- Uses new letters U, I
- Avoids all excluded letters (R, S, E, D, P, T)

But wait - D is excluded, and AUDIO has D? No, AUDIO is A-U-D-I-O, which includes D (from ADOPT feedback D(x)), so D is out. So AUDIO is invalid.

Next option: **AULIC** (A U L I C)
- Starts with A
- O is not present here - we need to include O. So this is invalid.

Next: **AMBIT** - has T (out), invalid.

Next: **ANGOL** - but this is a proper noun (Spanish for ""angry""), might not be valid.

Next: **AFOUL** - A F O U L
- Starts with A
- O in position 3 - but we know O cannot be in position 3 (from both guesses marking O(-) in position 3). So this is invalid.

Next: **AULICA** - invalid (not 5 letters).

Let me rethink with O in position 4 or 5.

Try **AULIC** - but no O.

Wait, we need O in position 2, 4, or 5.

Let's try **AULIC** - no O.

Alternative: **ABHOR** - R is out.

**ACORN** - R is out.

**ACOUST** - S, T are out.

**AFRAID** - R, D, P, T are out (but P isn't in this word, D is out).

**AFLOAT** - T is out.

**AMONG** - G is new, O in position 4
- A M O N G
- Starts with A
- O in position 3 - but we know O cannot be in position 3. So invalid.

**AMONG** has O in position 3 - ruled out.

**AFOUL** - O in position 3 - ruled out.

**AULIC** - no O.

**AQUAM** - not valid.

**AUROR** - R is out.

**AURIC** - C is new, O is not present.

This is tricky. Let me list valid 5-letter words starting with A, containing O, avoiding R, S, E, D, P, T, with O in position 2, 4, or 5.

Possible O positions:
- Position 2: A O _ _ _
  - AOGRE - invalid
  - AONIC - invalid
  - AORIC - invalid
  - AOVIC - invalid
  - AOWLS - S is out
  - AOXID - D is out
  - AOPYL - invalid
  - AORID - D is out
  - AONIC - invalid
  - AOVIC - invalid

Valid candidates:

Let's pick **AGLOW**:
- Starts with A
- G, L, O are new letters
- O is in position 4
- Avoids all excluded letters (R, S, E, D, P, T)

This should help determine the position of O and test G and L.From the feedback so far:
- The word starts with A.
- O is in the word but NOT in positions 3 (from both guesses).
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E, D, P, T.
- Remaining letters to test: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, U, V, W, etc.

I need a word that:
- Starts with A
- Contains O in position 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is ruled out)
- Avoids R, S, E, D, P, T
- Uses new letters to gather more information

A good candidate is **AGLOW**:
- Starts with A
- Contains O in position 4
- Uses new letters G, L, O (O's position is tested here)
- Avoids all excluded letters

From the new feedback on AGLOW:
- A is still correct in position 1 (✓)
- G is not in the word (x)
- L is not in the word (x)
- O is now correct in position 4 (✓)
- W is not in the word (x)

So far we know:
1. Word pattern: A _ _ O _
2. Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E, D, P, T, G, L, W
3. Remaining possible letters: B, C, F, H, I, K, M, N, U, V, Y, etc.
4. Still need to determine positions 2 and 3.

Good next steps:
- Pick a word that fits A _ _ O _ and tests new consonants/vowels for positions 2 and 3.
- Avoid all excluded letters (R, S, E, D, P, T, G, L, W).
- Try to include common remaining letters like B, C, F, H, I, K, M, N, U.

Possible candidates:
- AFOCK (but C and K are new, F is new)
- ABMOW (but W is out)
- ANKOU (but U is new, K is new)
- AFIRE (but R and E are out)
- AMUCK (but C and K are new, M is new)
- ABHOR (but R and H are new, but R is out)
- ACHOO (but C and H are new, O is already known at 4)
- ANCHO (but N and C and H are new, O is already known at 4)

Let's choose **AMUCK**:
- Starts with A
- Has O in position 4
- Tests M, U, C in positions 2,3,5
- Avoids all excluded letters

Current known facts:
1. Pattern: A _ _ O _
2. Letters already excluded: R, S, E, D, P, T, G, L, W, M, U, C, K
3. Remaining candidate letters (not yet ruled out) for positions 2,3,5:
   B, F, H, I, N, V, Y, plus any others not yet used.

We still need to determine positions 2, 3, and 5.  
A good next guess should:
- fit A _ _ O _
- use only the still-allowed letters
- test new letters in those positions.

A simple word that fits and uses remaining common letters is AFIBO, but that’s not a valid English word.  
Another candidate: AFI ON (not valid).  
Looking at remaining letters, common combinations left are:
- A F I O N
- A F H O N
- A N I O N (invalid)
- A N H O N (invalid)
- A F I O B
- A N I O B

Valid English words from these:
- AFIBO – not valid
- AFHON – not valid
- ANION – valid word

ANION uses:
- A (position 1) ✓
- N (position 2)
- I (position 3)
- O (position 4) ✓
- N (position 5)

All letters A, N, I, O, N are allowed by current constraints.  
This will test N, I, and N again for positions 2,3,5.

Let’s go with ANION.

From the latest feedback on ANION:
- A(✓) – correct in position 1  
- N(-) – N is in the word but not in position 2  
- I(✓) – correct in position 3  
- O(✓) – correct in position 4  
- N(✓) – correct in position 5  

Thus, the confirmed pattern is: A _ I O N.

We only need to verify that no other letter conflicts arise with this pattern. All previously excluded letters remain excluded, and none of the already-used letters (R, S, E, D, P, T, G, L, W, M, U, C, K) appear here. The only letter left to confirm is the second position, but since the pattern is now fully determined, we can simply present the single remaining valid English word that fits A _ I O N.

The only common English word matching this pattern is AJOIN (as in “to ally”), but AJOIN is not a standard Scrabble word. The actual standard word is AJOIN is not valid. Let me reconsider standard 5-letter words:

Standard dictionary check:
- A B I O N – not a word
- A F I O N – not a word
- A H I O N – not a word
- A J I O N – not a word
- A V I O N – not a word
- A X I O N – not a word

However, the valid standard word fitting A _ I O N is **AJOIN** (Scrabble list includes it). But to be safe with common English, the only plausible word is **AXION** (a particle physics term). Let me confirm:

AXION:
- A ✓
- X – new letter, but allowed so far
- I ✓

- N ✓

All letters fit the constraints. Therefore, AXION is the logical next guess.

<guess>AXION</guess>",AXION,"From the latest feedback on ANION:
- A(✓) – correct in position 1  
- N(-) – N is in the word but not in position 2  
- I(✓) – correct in position 3  
- O(✓) – correct in position 4  
- N(✓) – correct in position 5  

Thus, the confirmed pattern is: A _ I O N.

We only need to verify that no other letter conflicts arise with this pattern. All previously excluded letters remain excluded, and none of the already-used letters (R, S, E, D, P, T, G, L, W, M, U, C, K) appear here. The only letter left to confirm is the second position, but since the pattern is now fully determined, we can simply present the single remaining valid English word that fits A _ I O N.

The only common English word matching this pattern is AJOIN (as in “to ally”), but AJOIN is not a standard Scrabble word. The actual standard word is AJOIN is not valid. Let me reconsider standard 5-letter words:

Standard dictionary check:
- A B I O N – not a word
- A F I O N – not a word
- A H I O N – not a word
- A J I O N – not a word
- A V I O N – not a word
- A X I O N – not a word

However, the valid standard word fitting A _ I O N is **AJOIN** (Scrabble list includes it). But to be safe with common English, the only plausible word is **AXION** (a particle physics term). Let me confirm:

AXION:
- A ✓
- X – new letter, but allowed so far
- I ✓
- O ✓
- N ✓

All letters fit the constraints. Therefore, AXION is the logical next guess.",Guess 6: AXION -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) X(✓) I(✓) O(✓) N(✓),SUCCESS
