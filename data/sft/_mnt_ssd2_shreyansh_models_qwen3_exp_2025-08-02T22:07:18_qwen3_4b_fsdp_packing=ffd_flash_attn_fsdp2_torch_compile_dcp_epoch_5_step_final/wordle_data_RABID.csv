For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common starting words include:

- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- ARISE (uses A, R, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)

I'll choose ""ARISE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters in English words (A, R, I, S, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and common consonants.

From the feedback on ARISE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in the 1st position.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- I(-) → I is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, I somewhere (but not in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively).
- Does NOT contain S or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that uses A, R, I and avoids S and E. Also, the positions of A, R, I must be different from positions 1, 2, 3.

Possible letters to include: A, R, I, plus other consonants (avoiding S) and possibly other vowels (avoiding E).

Let me think of words that fit:
- Could use consonants like T, N, L, D, etc.
- Maybe ""TRAIN"" – but A is in position 3, which was marked wrong for A.
- ""RADIO"" – but O is a new vowel, and D and I are in new positions. However, A is in position 2, which was wrong for A.
- ""IRATE"" – but E is not allowed, and A is in position 4 (new position for A).
- ""TRIAD"" – uses T, R, I, A, D. Positions: A is in 4 (new), R is in 2 (original was 2, but feedback said R is in word but not in 2, so this is invalid).
- ""DRIAR"" – but R is repeated and positions may not fit.
- ""IRONY"" – but Y is new, and positions: I in 1 (original was 3), R in 2 (original was 2, but feedback says R is not in 2), so invalid.
- ""CRIAR"" – but C is new, and positions: A in 4, R in 2 (invalid as above).
- ""CRIMP"" – but M and P are new, and positions: A in 3 (invalid), so no.
- ""TRAIN"" – A in 3 (invalid).
- ""RATIO"" – A in 3 (invalid).
- ""ARTIC"" – but C is new, A in 1 (invalid), so no.
- ""INART"" – but T is new, positions: A in 3 (invalid).
- ""TRIAC"" – but C is new, A in 4, R in 2 (invalid).
- ""DRAIN"" – A in 3 (invalid).
- ""GRAIN"" – A in 3 (invalid).
- ""FRUIT"" – but U and T are new, positions: A in 4, R in 2 (invalid).
- ""BRISK"" – but S is invalid.
- ""GRAFT"" – but F and T are new, positions: A in 3 (invalid).
- ""GRAIL"" – A in 4, R in 2 (invalid).
- ""GRAVY"" – but V and Y are new, positions: A in 3 (invalid).
- ""GRAFT"" – same issue as above.
- ""GRAIN"" – same issue.
- ""TRIPOD"" – too long.
- ""CRIER"" – but E is invalid, and R is repeated.
- ""CRISP"" – S is invalid.
- ""FRISK"" – S is invalid.
- ""PRICK"" – C and K are new, positions: A in 4, R in 2 (invalid).
- ""PRIAR"" – but R is repeated, positions: A in 4, R in 3 (original R was in 2, so 3 is new), I in 2 (original was 3, so 2 is new). This could work. The word ""PRIAR"" is valid (though rare, it's a variant spelling of ""priestly"" or ""priory"").

But ""PRIAR"" is obscure. Let me think of more common words.

Alternative approach: Since A, R, I must be in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively, and we can't use S or E, let's look for words where:
- A is in position 2, 4, or 5
- R is in position 1, 3, 4, or 5
- I is in position 1, 2, 4, or 5

Possible combinations:
- A in 2: e.g., _A_RI or _A_IR
- A in 4: e.g., _ _ _A_ with R and I in other positions
- A in 5: e.g., _ _ _ _A with R and I in other positions

Let's try ""TRAIN"":
- T R A I N
- A is in 3 (invalid, must be in 2,4,5)
- R is in 2 (invalid, must not be in 2)
So invalid.

""TRIAD"":
- T R I A D
- A is in 4 (valid)
- R is in 2 (invalid, must not be in 2)
Invalid.

""IRATE"":
- I R A T E
- E is invalid
Also, A is in 3 (invalid)
Invalid.

""RATIO"":
- R A T I O
- A is in 2 (valid)
- R is in 1 (valid)
- I is in 4 (valid)
This seems to fit all constraints:
- Contains A, R, I in new positions (A-2, R-1, I-4)
- Does not contain S or E
- All letters are in valid positions per feedback

So ""RATIO"" is a good next guess.
</think>

Based on the feedback that A, R, and I are all in the word but not in positions 1, 2, and 3 respectively, and that S and E are not in the word, I'll try ""RATIO"" which places A in position 2, R in position 1, and I in position 4.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common starting words include:

- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- ARISE (uses A, R, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)

I'll choose ""ARISE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters in English words (A, R, I, S, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and common consonants.

<guess>ARISE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) I(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ARISE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in the 1st position.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- I(-) → I is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, I somewhere (but not in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively).
- Does NOT contain S or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that uses A, R, I and avoids S and E. Also, the positions of A, R, I must be different from positions 1, 2, 3.

Possible letters to include: A, R, I, plus other consonants (avoiding S) and possibly other vowels (avoiding E).

Let me think of words that fit:
- Could use consonants like T, N, L, D, etc.
- Maybe ""TRAIN"" – but A is in position 3, which was marked wrong for A.
- ""RADIO"" – but O is a new vowel, and D and I are in new positions. However, A is in position 2, which was wrong for A.
- ""IRATE"" – but E is not allowed, and A is in position 4 (new position for A).
- ""TRIAD"" – uses T, R, I, A, D. Positions: A is in 4 (new), R is in 2 (original was 2, but feedback said R is in word but not in 2, so this is invalid).
- ""DRIAR"" – but R is repeated and positions may not fit.
- ""IRONY"" – but Y is new, and positions: I in 1 (original was 3), R in 2 (original was 2, but feedback says R is not in 2), so invalid.
- ""CRIAR"" – but C is new, and positions: A in 4, R in 2 (invalid as above).
- ""CRIMP"" – but M and P are new, and positions: A in 3 (invalid), so no.
- ""TRAIN"" – A in 3 (invalid).
- ""RATIO"" – A in 3 (invalid).
- ""ARTIC"" – but C is new, A in 1 (invalid), so no.
- ""INART"" – but T is new, positions: A in 3 (invalid).
- ""TRIAC"" – but C is new, A in 4, R in 2 (invalid).
- ""DRAIN"" – A in 3 (invalid).
- ""GRAIN"" – A in 3 (invalid).
- ""FRUIT"" – but U and T are new, positions: A in 4, R in 2 (invalid).
- ""BRISK"" – but S is invalid.
- ""GRAFT"" – but F and T are new, positions: A in 3 (invalid).
- ""GRAIL"" – A in 4, R in 2 (invalid).
- ""GRAVY"" – but V and Y are new, positions: A in 3 (invalid).
- ""GRAFT"" – same issue as above.
- ""GRAIN"" – same issue.
- ""TRIPOD"" – too long.
- ""CRIER"" – but E is invalid, and R is repeated.
- ""CRISP"" – S is invalid.
- ""FRISK"" – S is invalid.
- ""PRICK"" – C and K are new, positions: A in 4, R in 2 (invalid).
- ""PRIAR"" – but R is repeated, positions: A in 4, R in 3 (original R was in 2, so 3 is new), I in 2 (original was 3, so 2 is new). This could work. The word ""PRIAR"" is valid (though rare, it's a variant spelling of ""priestly"" or ""priory"").

But ""PRIAR"" is obscure. Let me think of more common words.

Alternative approach: Since A, R, I must be in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively, and we can't use S or E, let's look for words where:
- A is in position 2, 4, or 5
- R is in position 1, 3, 4, or 5
- I is in position 1, 2, 4, or 5

Possible combinations:
- A in 2: e.g., _A_RI or _A_IR
- A in 4: e.g., _ _ _A_ with R and I in other positions
- A in 5: e.g., _ _ _ _A with R and I in other positions

Let's try ""TRAIN"":
- T R A I N
- A is in 3 (invalid, must be in 2,4,5)
- R is in 2 (invalid, must not be in 2)
So invalid.

""TRIAD"":
- T R I A D
- A is in 4 (valid)
- R is in 2 (invalid, must not be in 2)
Invalid.

""IRATE"":
- I R A T E
- E is invalid
Also, A is in 3 (invalid)
Invalid.

""RATIO"":
- R A T I O
- A is in 2 (valid)
- R is in 1 (valid)
- I is in 4 (valid)
This seems to fit all constraints:
- Contains A, R, I in new positions (A-2, R-1, I-4)
- Does not contain S or E
- All letters are in valid positions per feedback

So ""RATIO"" is a good next guess.Based on the feedback that A, R, and I are all in the word but not in positions 1, 2, and 3 respectively, and that S and E are not in the word, I'll try ""RATIO"" which places A in position 2, R in position 1, and I in position 4.

Let me think of more common words.\n\nAlternative approach: Since A, R, I must be in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively, and we can\'t use S or E, let\'s look for words where:\n- A is in position 2, 4, or 5\n- R is in position 1, 3, 4, or 5\n- I is in position 1, 2, 4, or 5\n\nPossible combinations:\n- A in 2: e.g., _A_RI or _A_IR\n- A in 4: e.g., _ _ _A_ with R and I in other positions\n- A in 5: e.g., _ _ _ _A with R and I in other positions\n\nLet\'s try ""TRAIN"":\n- T R A I N\n- A is in 3 (invalid, must be in 2,4,5)\n- R is in 2 (invalid, must not be in 2)\nSo invalid.\n\n""TRIAD"":\n- T R I A D\n- A is in 4 (valid)\n- R is in 2 (invalid, must not be in 2)\nInvalid.\n\n""IRATE"":\n- I R A T E\n- E is invalid\nAlso, A is in 3 (invalid)\nInvalid.\n\n""RATIO"":\n- R A T I O\n- A is in 2 (valid)\n- R is in 1 (valid)\n- I is in 4 (valid)\nThis seems to fit all constraints:\n- Contains A, R, I in new positions (A-2, R-1, I-4)\n- Does not contain S or E\n- All letters are in valid positions per feedback\n\nSo ""RATIO"" is a good next guess.Based on the feedback that A, R, and I are all in the word but not in positions 1, 2, and 3 respectively, and that S and E are not in the word, I\'ll try ""RATIO"" which places A in position 2, R in position 1, and I in position 4.\n\n<guess>RATIO</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) I(-) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: RATIO -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) T(x) I(✓) O(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two rounds of feedback:\n\n1.

From the three rounds of feedback:

1. ARISE → A(-) R(-) I(-) S(x) E(x)  
   – A, R, I are in the word, but not in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively.  
   – S and E are NOT in the word.

2. RATIO → R(✓) A(✓) T(x) I(✓) O(x)  
   – Confirms R in position 1, A in position 2, I in position 4.  
   – T and O are NOT in the word.

3. RACID → R(✓) A(✓) C(x) I(✓) D(✓)  
   – Confirms R, A, I, D are all in the word and in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 respectively.  
   – C is NOT in the word.

So the pattern is now:  
R A _ I D

Only position 3 remains unknown.  
Letters already excluded: S, E, T, O, C.  
Letters already placed: R, A, I, D.

Valid English 5-letter words that fit R A _ I D:

- R A N I D → RANID (valid, though rare – a type of frog)  
- R A B I D → RABID (valid, means ""intensely passionate"")

RABID is the more common word, so I’ll guess RABID.
