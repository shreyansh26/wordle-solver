### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. Common starting letters like S, T, N, or R are often effective, and including vowels like A, E, I can quickly narrow down possibilities.

A popular and balanced starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S: Common consonant
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Common vowel

This combination provides good coverage of frequent letters and positions.

From the two guesses we now know:

1. The word ends with E (last letter is E).
2. The letter N is in the word and in the correct position (4th position).
3. Letters already ruled out: S, L, A, T, C, R, O.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ N E  
Available letters (excluding the ruled-out ones): B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus any others not yet used.

We need a word that:
- Is 5 letters long
- Has N in position 4 and E in position 5
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out
- Uses common letters to maximize information gain

Looking at common 5-letter words ending in NE, a good candidate is ""PHONE"":
- P, H, O are still possible (O was ruled out in CRONE, but wait - O was in CRONE and marked x, so O is ruled out. Let me reconsider.)

Let me think of words ending in NE without O, C, R, S, L, A, T.

Good candidates:
- ""CHINE"" - but C is ruled out.
- ""DINER"" - R is ruled out.
- ""FINER"" - R is ruled out.
- ""GINER"" - R is ruled out.
- ""HINER"" - R is ruled out.
- ""MINER"" - R is ruled out.
- ""PINER"" - R is ruled out.
- ""WINER"" - R is ruled out.

Hmm, many words ending in NE with R are ruled out. Let me try ""DINE"" - but that's 4 letters.

Wait, we need 5 letters. Let me think differently: _ _ _ N E.

Possible words:
- ""MIDGE"" - but G is not common.
- ""VINE"" - 4 letters.
- ""WINE"" - 4 letters.
- ""BIDGE"" - 5 letters but ends with E, pattern _ _ D N E? No.

Wait, let me list possible 5-letter words ending in NE without the ruled-out letters:

- ""BONEY"" - but Y is possible, B is possible, O is ruled out.
- ""DONEY"" - O is ruled out.
- ""HONEY"" - O is ruled out.
- ""JONES"" - S is ruled out.
- ""LONES"" - L and S are ruled out.
- ""MONES"" - S is ruled out.
- ""PONES"" - S is ruled out.
- ""TONES"" - T and S are ruled out.
- ""WONES"" - S is ruled out.

This is tricky. Let me think of other words ending in NE:

- ""CHINE"" - C is ruled out.
- ""FINES"" - S is ruled out.
- ""GINES"" - S is ruled out.
- ""HIGNE"" - not a valid word.
- ""MIGNE"" - not valid.
- ""PINE"" - 4 letters.
- ""VINE"" - 4 letters.

Wait, let me think of words with N in position 4 and E in position 5, avoiding the ruled-out letters:

Possible letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Some words:

But we need N in position 4, so _ _ _ N E.

So ""BIDGE"" is B I D G E - but N is not in position 4. Let me try:

- ""MIDGE"" - M I D G E - N is not here.
- ""WIDGE"" - W I D G E - N is not here.

Let me try ""VINER"" - R is ruled out.

Let me try ""QUINE"" - Q, U, I, N, E - but Q is less common, but this is a valid word.

""QUINE"" uses:
- Q (possible)
- U (possible)
- I (possible)
- N (correct position)
- E (correct position)

This seems like a good candidate as it uses new letters (Q, U, I) to gather more information.

Another candidate: ""VINE"" is 4 letters.

""QUINE"" seems valid and fits the pattern _ _ _ N E with letters not yet ruled out.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. Common starting letters like S, T, N, or R are often effective, and including vowels like A, E, I can quickly narrow down possibilities.

A popular and balanced starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S: Common consonant
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Common vowel

This combination provides good coverage of frequent letters and positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position.
- S, L, A, T are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- Word ends with E
- Letters S, L, A, T are excluded
- Remaining letters are still possible

Good letters to try next (common ones not yet ruled out): R, N, I, O, U, C, H, M, D, P, etc.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Ends with E
- Doesn’t contain S, L, A, T
- Uses other common letters to gather more info

A good candidate is ""CRONE"":
- C, R, O, N are all common letters not yet ruled out
- Ends with E (known correct position)
- Avoids S, L, A, T

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: CRONE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) O(x) N(✓) E(✓)

From the two guesses we now know:

1. The word ends with E (last letter is E).
2. The letter N is in the word and in the correct position (4th position).
3. Letters already ruled out: S, L, A, T, C, R, O.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ N E  
Available letters (excluding the ruled-out ones): B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus any others not yet used.

We need a word that:
- Is 5 letters long
- Has N in position 4 and E in position 5
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out
- Uses common letters to maximize information gain

Looking at common 5-letter words ending in NE, a good candidate is ""PHONE"":
- P, H, O are still possible (O was ruled out in CRONE, but wait - O was in CRONE and marked x, so O is ruled out. Let me reconsider.)

Let me think of words ending in NE without O, C, R, S, L, A, T.

Good candidates:
- ""CHINE"" - but C is ruled out.
- ""DINER"" - R is ruled out.
- ""FINER"" - R is ruled out.
- ""GINER"" - R is ruled out.
- ""HINER"" - R is ruled out.
- ""MINER"" - R is ruled out.
- ""PINER"" - R is ruled out.
- ""WINER"" - R is ruled out.

Hmm, many words ending in NE with R are ruled out. Let me try ""DINE"" - but that's 4 letters.

Wait, we need 5 letters. Let me think differently: _ _ _ N E.

Possible words:
- ""MIDGE"" - but G is not common.
- ""VINE"" - 4 letters.
- ""WINE"" - 4 letters.
- ""BIDGE"" - 5 letters but ends with E, pattern _ _ D N E? No.

Wait, let me list possible 5-letter words ending in NE without the ruled-out letters:

- ""BONEY"" - but Y is possible, B is possible, O is ruled out.
- ""DONEY"" - O is ruled out.
- ""HONEY"" - O is ruled out.
- ""JONES"" - S is ruled out.
- ""LONES"" - L and S are ruled out.
- ""MONES"" - S is ruled out.
- ""PONES"" - S is ruled out.
- ""TONES"" - T and S are ruled out.
- ""WONES"" - S is ruled out.

This is tricky. Let me think of other words ending in NE:

- ""CHINE"" - C is ruled out.
- ""FINES"" - S is ruled out.
- ""GINES"" - S is ruled out.
- ""HIGNE"" - not a valid word.
- ""MIGNE"" - not valid.
- ""PINE"" - 4 letters.
- ""VINE"" - 4 letters.

Wait, let me think of words with N in position 4 and E in position 5, avoiding the ruled-out letters:

Possible letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Some words:
- ""BIDGE"" - but D is possible, G is possible, but O is ruled out in CRONE, but this word doesn't have O. Wait, ""BIDGE"" is B, I, D, G, E? No, that's 5 letters: B I D G E.

But we need N in position 4, so _ _ _ N E.

So ""BIDGE"" is B I D G E - but N is not in position 4. Let me try:

- ""MIDGE"" - M I D G E - N is not here.
- ""WIDGE"" - W I D G E - N is not here.

Let me think of words ending in NE with N in position 4:

- ""MIDGE"" - no N in 4th.
- ""PIDGE"" - P I D G E - no N.

This is harder. Let me think of words ending in NE with N in position 4:

- ""CHINE"" - C is ruled out.
- ""HINNE"" - not a word.
- ""MINNE"" - not a word.
- ""PINNE"" - not a word.

Wait, let me try ""DINER"" - but R is ruled out.

Let me try ""HINER"" - R is ruled out.

Let me try ""MINER"" - R is ruled out.

Let me try ""WINER"" - R is ruled out.

Let me try ""BINER"" - R is ruled out.

Let me try ""GINER"" - R is ruled out.

Let me try ""PINER"" - R is ruled out.

Let me try ""FOINE"" - but O is ruled out.

Let me try ""VINER"" - R is ruled out.

Let me try ""QUINE"" - Q, U, I, N, E - but Q is less common, but this is a valid word.

""QUINE"" uses:
- Q (possible)
- U (possible)
- I (possible)
- N (correct position)
- E (correct position)

This seems like a good candidate as it uses new letters (Q, U, I) to gather more information.

Another candidate: ""VINE"" is 4 letters.

""QUINE"" seems valid and fits the pattern _ _ _ N E with letters not yet ruled out.

Let me check if ""QUINE"" is a valid word - yes, it is (a variant of ""quince"").

So I'll go with ""QUINE"".
