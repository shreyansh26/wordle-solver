### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me identify which vowels and consonants might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to narrow down possibilities for the next guess.

From the feedback on “arose”:

A x → A is not in the word.  
R - → R is in the word but not in position 2.  
O - → O is in the word but not in position 3.  
S x → S is not in the word.  
E - → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- contains the letters R, O, E (in some order, not in positions 2, 3, 5 respectively).
- does NOT contain A or S.

I want a new 5-letter word that:
1. uses only the remaining letters (R, O, E plus other consonants/vowels not ruled out).
2. places R, O, E in positions different from the ones just ruled out.
3. introduces new consonants to test.

A good candidate is “ROUTE”:
- R is now in position 1 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of position 2).
- O is now in position 2 (allowed, since it was ruled out of position 3).
- U and T are new letters to test.
- E is in position 5 (ruled out, so this is bad).

Let me adjust. Instead, I’ll try “TROPE”:
- T is new.
- R is in position 2 (was ruled out of position 2 → conflict).
Oops.

Try “PROVE”:
- P is new.
- R in position 2 (again ruled out).

Try “ROGER”:
- R in position 1 and 5.
- O in position 2.
- G and E in new positions.

But E was marked as present but wrong position (position 5), so in “ROGER” E is in position 4 → allowed.

This seems valid:
- Contains R, O, E in allowed positions.
- Introduces G.
- Uses new consonants R twice (but duplicates are allowed).

However, I want to avoid duplicate letters if possible. Let me pick “PRONE”:
- P is new.
- R in position 2 (ruled out → conflict).

Next, “DROVE”:
- D is new.
- R in position 2 (ruled out).

“FRONT”:
- F is new.
- R in position 2 (ruled out).

“GROPE”:
- G is new.
- R in position 2 (ruled out).

“ROUTE” had E in position 5 (forbidden). So I need E not in position 5.

Let’s try “TOWER”:
- T, W new.
- E in position 4 (allowed).
- O in position 2 (allowed).
- R in position 5 (allowed, since only position 2 was ruled out for R).

This looks good.

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 (arose):

W(x) – W is not in the word

R(✓) – R is in position 5

- Still unknown positions 1, 3  
- Allowed letters so far: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z (minus any ruled out)  
- Ruled out letters: A, S, T, W  
- Still need to test new consonants for positions 1 and 3  

A good next guess should:
1. Keep O in position 2 and R in position 5  
2. Place E in position 4  
3. Introduce new consonants for positions 1 and 3  
4. Avoid any already ruled-out letters  

Candidate words:
- B O X E R → uses B and X (new consonants)  
- C O N E R → uses C and N  
- F O L E R → uses F and L  
- P O D E R → uses P and D
