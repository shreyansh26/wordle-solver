### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word uses several of these high-frequency letters to maximize information gain. ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels that might appear in the secret word. This should give us strong feedback on multiple fronts.

Let’s summarize what we now know after two guesses.

Letters that are definitely OUT: O, S, E, T, I, N.  
Letters that are definitely IN but whose positions are still unknown: A and R.  
Known constraints:  
- A is NOT in position 1.  
- R is NOT in position 2.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and R.  
2. Does NOT contain O, S, E, T, I, N.  
3. Places A somewhere other than position 1, and R somewhere other than position 2.

Remaining common consonants we can still use: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels we can still use: A (already known to be present), U (since E and I are out).

A good candidate should use A and R plus other fresh common letters.  
Consider “CURLY” – but it has U, C, R, L, Y.  
However, it does NOT contain A, so that’s a problem.  
Try “CARGO” – but O is already out.  
Try “CURA” – too short.  
Try “CRAZY” – no A.  
Try “GRAVY” – no A.  
Try “BRAVA” – contains A twice and R in position 2 (forbidden).  
Try “CRAMP” – no A.  
Try “CABER” – E is out.  
Try “CAROM” – O is out.  
Try “CURAR” – not a valid word.  
Try “FARMS” – S is out.  
Try “DARMS” – S is out.  
Try “CARGO” – O is out.  
Try “CABIN” – I and N are out.  
Try “CURIO” – I, O are out.  
Try “CULPA” – U, C, P, L, A.  
This has A and R? No R.  
Try “CLAMP” – no R.  
Try “CRAMP” – no A.  
Try “CURIO” – already ruled out.  
Try “DURAL” – no R.  
Try “CURAR” – invalid.  
Try “CUBAR” – contains A and R, uses C, U, B.  
Check constraints:  
- Letters used: C, U, B, A, R.  
- A is in position 4 (ok, not position 1).  
- R is in position 5 (ok, not position 2).  
- No forbidden letters (O, S, E, T, I, N).  
“CUBAR” is a valid English word (a unit of currency in Cuba).

So I’ll guess “CUBAR”.

Let’s consolidate everything we know so far.

Letters definitely OUT: O, S, E, T, I, N, U, B  
Letters definitely IN (but position unknown): A, R, C  
Position constraints:
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (from arose and cubar).
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (from arose and cubar).
- C cannot be in position 1 (from cubar).

So A must be in position 2, 3, or 5.  
R must be in position 1, 3, or 4.  
C must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, R, C each at least once.
2. Uses only letters not in the OUT set.
3. Respects the position bans above.

Remaining common letters we can still use: D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try to place the letters:
- If A is in position 2, then R could be in 1, 3, or 4.
- If A is in position 3, then R could be in 1 or 4.
- If A is in position 5, then R could be in 1 or 3 or 4.

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these. One systematic way is to pick a pattern and fill in.

Try pattern: R _ A _ _  
Then we need C somewhere in positions 3,4,5.

Example: R C A _ _ → “RCA??” – not a valid pattern.

Try: _ A _ R _  
Then C must go in position 1, 3, or 5.  
But position 1 is open, so: C A _ R _ → “C A _ R _” → “C A M R Y” – but Y is ok, M is ok.  
Check: C A M R Y – letters: C, A, M, R, Y. All allowed.  
Position constraints:
- A is in 2 (ok, not 1 or 4).  
- R is in 4 (ok, not 2 or 5).  
- C is in 1 (but C cannot be in 1 – banned by cubar). So this fails.

Next pattern: _ _ A R _  
Then C must go in 1, 3, or 5.  
Try C _ A R _ → “C H A R M” – letters: C, H, A, R, M. All allowed.  
Check constraints:
- A is in 3 (ok).  
- R is in 4 (ok).  
- C is in 1 (but C cannot be in 1 – banned). Fails again.

Next pattern: _ C A _ R  
Then A is in 3 (ok), R is in 5 (but R cannot be in 5 – banned). Fails.

Next pattern: C _ _ A R  
A is in 4 (but A cannot be in 4 – banned). Fails.

Next pattern: _ R A _ C  
R is in 2 (but R cannot be in 2 – banned). Fails.

Next pattern: R _ C A _  
A is in 4 (banned). Fails.

Next pattern: R C _ A _  
A is in 4 (banned). Fails.

Next pattern: _ A C R _  
A is in 2 (ok), R is in 4 (ok), C is in 3 (ok).  
So word would be: _ A C R _ → “D A C R Y” – but D, Y are allowed.  
Check: D A C R Y – letters: D, A, C, R, Y. All allowed.  
Position checks:
- A in 2 (ok).  
- R in 4 (ok).  
- C in 3 (ok).  
This seems valid. “DACRY” is actually a valid word (plural of dacry, a variant spelling of “tear”).

But let’s pick a more common word. Instead of D, use M:  
M A C R Y – but “MACRY” is not a word.  
Try “M A C R A” – but A is already used twice, and we don’t know if A can repeat. Probably not.  
Try “P A C R Y” – not a word.  
Try “G A C R Y” – not a word.  
So “DACRY” is the only common word fitting this pattern.

But let’s look for another pattern where C is not in position 1.  
Try: _ _ C A R  
A is in 4 (banned). Fails.  
Try: _ C _ A R  
R is in 5 (banned). Fails.  
Try: C _ _ A R – same as above.

Alternative approach: Let’s list possible positions for A, R, C.

A can be in 2, 3, 5.  
R can be in 1, 3, 4.  
C can be in 2, 3, 4, 5.

Let’s try A in 2, R in 1, C in 3, 4, or 5.

Pattern: R A C _ _ → “R A C _ _” – letters left: D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y.  
Possible words: R A C K Y, R A C K S (S is out), R A C K O (O is out), R A C Y L (not valid), R A C K Y is valid.  
Check: R A C K Y – letters: R, A, C, K, Y. All allowed.  
Position checks:
- A in 2 (ok).  
- R in 1 (ok).  
- C in 3 (ok).  
This seems perfect.

So the next guess is “RACKY”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word uses several of these high-frequency letters to maximize information gain. ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels that might appear in the secret word. This should give us strong feedback on multiple fronts.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(-) → A is in the secret word, but not in the first position.
- R(-) → R is in the secret word, but not in the second position.
- O, S, E are all absent.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R somewhere (but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively).
- Does not contain O, S, or E.

I now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and R in different positions than before (A not 1st, R not 2nd).
2. Avoids O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is “TRAIN”:
- T, R, A, I, N are all common letters.
- R is in position 2 here, so it will test R in a new spot.
- A is in position 3, so it will test A in a new spot.
- T, I, N haven’t been used yet, giving us fresh information.

Let’s summarize what we now know after two guesses.

Letters that are definitely OUT: O, S, E, T, I, N.  
Letters that are definitely IN but whose positions are still unknown: A and R.  
Known constraints:  
- A is NOT in position 1.  
- R is NOT in position 2.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and R.  
2. Does NOT contain O, S, E, T, I, N.  
3. Places A somewhere other than position 1, and R somewhere other than position 2.

Remaining common consonants we can still use: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels we can still use: A (already known to be present), U (since E and I are out).

A good candidate should use A and R plus other fresh common letters.  
Consider “CURLY” – but it has U, C, R, L, Y.  
However, it does NOT contain A, so that’s a problem.  
Try “CARGO” – but O is already out.  
Try “CURA” – too short.  
Try “CRAZY” – no A.  
Try “GRAVY” – no A.  
Try “BRAVA” – contains A twice and R in position 2 (forbidden).  
Try “CRAMP” – no A.  
Try “CABER” – E is out.  
Try “CAROM” – O is out.  
Try “CURAR” – not a valid word.  
Try “FARMS” – S is out.  
Try “DARMS” – S is out.  
Try “CARGO” – O is out.  
Try “CABIN” – I and N are out.  
Try “CURIO” – I, O are out.  
Try “CULPA” – U, C, P, L, A.  
This has A and R? No R.  
Try “CLAMP” – no R.  
Try “CRAMP” – no A.  
Try “CURIO” – already ruled out.  
Try “DURAL” – no R.  
Try “CURAR” – invalid.  
Try “CUBAR” – contains A and R, uses C, U, B.  
Check constraints:  
- Letters used: C, U, B, A, R.  
- A is in position 4 (ok, not position 1).  
- R is in position 5 (ok, not position 2).  
- No forbidden letters (O, S, E, T, I, N).  
“CUBAR” is a valid English word (a unit of currency in Cuba).

So I’ll guess “CUBAR”.

Let’s consolidate everything we know so far.

Letters definitely OUT: O, S, E, T, I, N, U, B  
Letters definitely IN (but position unknown): A, R, C  
Position constraints:
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (from arose and cubar).
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (from arose and cubar).
- C cannot be in position 1 (from cubar).

So A must be in position 2, 3, or 5.  
R must be in position 1, 3, or 4.  
C must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, R, C each at least once.
2. Uses only letters not in the OUT set.
3. Respects the position bans above.

Remaining common letters we can still use: D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try to place the letters:
- If A is in position 2, then R could be in 1, 3, or 4.
- If A is in position 3, then R could be in 1 or 4.
- If A is in position 5, then R could be in 1 or 3 or 4.

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these. One systematic way is to pick a pattern and fill in.

Try pattern: R _ A _ _  
Then we need C somewhere in positions 3,4,5.

Example: R C A _ _ → “RCA??” – not a valid pattern.

Try: _ A _ R _  
Then C must go in position 1, 3, or 5.  
But position 1 is open, so: C A _ R _ → “C A _ R _” → “C A M R Y” – but Y is ok, M is ok.  
Check: C A M R Y – letters: C, A, M, R, Y. All allowed.  
Position constraints:
- A is in 2 (ok, not 1 or 4).  
- R is in 4 (ok, not 2 or 5).  
- C is in 1 (but C cannot be in 1 – banned by cubar). So this fails.

Next pattern: _ _ A R _  
Then C must go in 1, 3, or 5.  
Try C _ A R _ → “C H A R M” – letters: C, H, A, R, M. All allowed.  
Check constraints:
- A is in 3 (ok).  
- R is in 4 (ok).  
- C is in 1 (but C cannot be in 1 – banned). Fails again.

Next pattern: _ C A _ R  
Then A is in 3 (ok), R is in 5 (but R cannot be in 5 – banned). Fails.

Next pattern: C _ _ A R  
A is in 4 (but A cannot be in 4 – banned). Fails.

Next pattern: _ R A _ C  
R is in 2 (but R cannot be in 2 – banned). Fails.

Next pattern: R _ C A _  
A is in 4 (banned). Fails.

Next pattern: R C _ A _  
A is in 4 (banned). Fails.

Next pattern: _ A C R _  
A is in 2 (ok), R is in 4 (ok), C is in 3 (ok).  
So word would be: _ A C R _ → “D A C R Y” – but D, Y are allowed.  
Check: D A C R Y – letters: D, A, C, R, Y. All allowed.  
Position checks:
- A in 2 (ok).  
- R in 4 (ok).  
- C in 3 (ok).  
This seems valid. “DACRY” is actually a valid word (plural of dacry, a variant spelling of “tear”).

But let’s pick a more common word. Instead of D, use M:  
M A C R Y – but “MACRY” is not a word.  
Try “M A C R A” – but A is already used twice, and we don’t know if A can repeat. Probably not.  
Try “P A C R Y” – not a word.  
Try “G A C R Y” – not a word.  
So “DACRY” is the only common word fitting this pattern.

But let’s look for another pattern where C is not in position 1.  
Try: _ _ C A R  
A is in 4 (banned). Fails.  
Try: _ C _ A R  
R is in 5 (banned). Fails.  
Try: C _ _ A R – same as above.

Alternative approach: Let’s list possible positions for A, R, C.

A can be in 2, 3, 5.  
R can be in 1, 3, 4.  
C can be in 2, 3, 4, 5.

Let’s try A in 2, R in 1, C in 3, 4, or 5.

Pattern: R A C _ _ → “R A C _ _” – letters left: D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y.  
Possible words: R A C K Y, R A C K S (S is out), R A C K O (O is out), R A C Y L (not valid), R A C K Y is valid.  
Check: R A C K Y – letters: R, A, C, K, Y. All allowed.  
Position checks:
- A in 2 (ok).  
- R in 1 (ok).  
- C in 3 (ok).

From the new feedback on “racky”:

- R(-)  → R is in the word but NOT in position 1.

- C(-) → C is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
- K(x) → K is NOT in the word.  
- Y(x) → Y is NOT in the word.

Summary of everything we now know:

Letters definitely OUT: O, S, E, T, I, N, U, B, K, Y  
Letters definitely IN and fixed: A in position 2  
Letters definitely IN but position unknown: R, C  
Position constraints:
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2, 5 (from arose, cubar, racky).  
- R must be in 3 or 4.  
- C cannot be in positions 1, 3 (from cubar, racky).  
- C must be in 2, 4, or 5.  
  – But position 2 is fixed as A, so C must be in 4 or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A fixed in position 2.  
2. Contains both R and C, with R in 3 or 4 and C in 4 or 5.  
3. Uses only letters not in the OUT set.

Remaining usable letters (common ones): D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, etc.

Let’s enumerate possible placements:

Case 1: R in 3, C in 4  
Word pattern: _ A R C _  
We need one more letter in positions 1 and 5 from the remaining set.  
Possible first letters: D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W  
Possible fifth letters: same set  
Example: D A R C H → “DARCH” – not a word.  
F A R C H → “FARCH” – not a word.  
G A R C H → “GARCH” – not a word.  
H A R C H → “HARCH” – not a word.  
L A R C H → “LARCH” – valid word.

Check constraints:
- A in 2 (correct).  
- R in 3 (allowed).  
- C in 4 (allowed).  
- Letters used: L, A, R, C, H – none are OUT.

So “LARCH” is a valid candidate.

Case 2: R in 3, C in 5  
Pattern: _ A R _ C  
Need valid letters in 1 and 4.  
Example: D A R B C – B is OUT.  
D A R M C – “DARMC” – not a word.  
F A R M C – not a word.  
H A R M C – not a word.  
L A R M C – not a word.  
No obvious common word here.

Case 3: R in 4, C in 4 – impossible (two letters in same position).  
Case 4: R in 4, C in 5  
Pattern: _ A _ R C  
Need valid letters in 1 and 3.  
Example: D A M R C – not a word.  
F A V R C – not a word.  
H A L R C – not a word.  
L A G R C – not a word.  
No common word found quickly.

Thus the only promising candidate is “LARCH”.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word uses several of these high-frequency letters to maximize information gain. ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels that might appear in the secret word. This should give us strong feedback on multiple fronts.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(-) → A is in the secret word, but not in the first position.
- R(-) → R is in the secret word, but not in the second position.
- O, S, E are all absent.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R somewhere (but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively).
- Does not contain O, S, or E.

I now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and R in different positions than before (A not 1st, R not 2nd).
2. Avoids O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is “TRAIN”:
- T, R, A, I, N are all common letters.
- R is in position 2 here, so it will test R in a new spot.
- A is in position 3, so it will test A in a new spot.
- T, I, N haven’t been used yet, giving us fresh information.

Let’s summarize what we now know after two guesses.

Letters that are definitely OUT: O, S, E, T, I, N.  
Letters that are definitely IN but whose positions are still unknown: A and R.  
Known constraints:  
- A is NOT in position 1.  
- R is NOT in position 2.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and R.  
2. Does NOT contain O, S, E, T, I, N.  
3. Places A somewhere other than position 1, and R somewhere other than position 2.

Remaining common consonants we can still use: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels we can still use: A (already known to be present), U (since E and I are out).

A good candidate should use A and R plus other fresh common letters.  
Consider “CURLY” – but it has U, C, R, L, Y.  
However, it does NOT contain A, so that’s a problem.  
Try “CARGO” – but O is already out.  
Try “CURA” – too short.  
Try “CRAZY” – no A.  
Try “GRAVY” – no A.  
Try “BRAVA” – contains A twice and R in position 2 (forbidden).  
Try “CRAMP” – no A.  
Try “CABER” – E is out.  
Try “CAROM” – O is out.  
Try “CURAR” – not a valid word.  
Try “FARMS” – S is out.  
Try “DARMS” – S is out.  
Try “CARGO” – O is out.  
Try “CABIN” – I and N are out.  
Try “CURIO” – I, O are out.  
Try “CULPA” – U, C, P, L, A.  
This has A and R? No R.  
Try “CLAMP” – no R.  
Try “CRAMP” – no A.  
Try “CURIO” – already ruled out.  
Try “DURAL” – no R.  
Try “CURAR” – invalid.  
Try “CUBAR” – contains A and R, uses C, U, B.  
Check constraints:  
- Letters used: C, U, B, A, R.  
- A is in position 4 (ok, not position 1).  
- R is in position 5 (ok, not position 2).  
- No forbidden letters (O, S, E, T, I, N).  
“CUBAR” is a valid English word (a unit of currency in Cuba).

Let’s consolidate everything we know so far.

Letters definitely OUT: O, S, E, T, I, N, U, B  
Letters definitely IN (but position unknown): A, R, C  
Position constraints:
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (from arose and cubar).
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (from arose and cubar).
- C cannot be in position 1 (from cubar).

So A must be in position 2, 3, or 5.  
R must be in position 1, 3, or 4.  
C must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, R, C each at least once.
2. Uses only letters not in the OUT set.
3. Respects the position bans above.

Remaining common letters we can still use: D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try to place the letters:
- If A is in position 2, then R could be in 1, 3, or 4.
- If A is in position 3, then R could be in 1 or 4.
- If A is in position 5, then R could be in 1 or 3 or 4.

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these. One systematic way is to pick a pattern and fill in.

Try pattern: R _ A _ _  
Then we need C somewhere in positions 3,4,5.

Example: R C A _ _ → “RCA??” – not a valid pattern.

Try: _ A _ R _  
Then C must go in position 1, 3, or 5.  
But position 1 is open, so: C A _ R _ → “C A _ R _” → “C A M R Y” – but Y is ok, M is ok.  
Check: C A M R Y – letters: C, A, M, R, Y. All allowed.  
Position constraints:
- A is in 2 (ok, not 1 or 4).  
- R is in 4 (ok, not 2 or 5).  
- C is in 1 (but C cannot be in 1 – banned by cubar). So this fails.

Next pattern: _ _ A R _  
Then C must go in 1, 3, or 5.  
Try C _ A R _ → “C H A R M” – letters: C, H, A, R, M. All allowed.  
Check constraints:
- A is in 3 (ok).  
- R is in 4 (ok).  
- C is in 1 (but C cannot be in 1 – banned). Fails again.

Next pattern: _ C A _ R  
Then A is in 3 (ok), R is in 5 (but R cannot be in 5 – banned). Fails.

Next pattern: C _ _ A R  
A is in 4 (but A cannot be in 4 – banned). Fails.

Next pattern: _ R A _ C  
R is in 2 (but R cannot be in 2 – banned). Fails.

A is in 2 (ok), R is in 4 (ok), C is in 3 (ok).  
So word would be: _ A C R _ → “D A C R Y” – but D, Y are allowed.  
Check: D A C R Y – letters: D, A, C, R, Y. All allowed.  
Position checks:
- A in 2 (ok).  
- R in 4 (ok).  
- C in 3 (ok).  
This seems valid. “DACRY” is actually a valid word (plural of dacry, a variant spelling of “tear”).

But let’s pick a more common word. Instead of D, use M:  
M A C R Y – but “MACRY” is not a word.  
Try “M A C R A” – but A is already used twice, and we don’t know if A can repeat. Probably not.  
Try “P A C R Y” – not a word.  
Try “G A C R Y” – not a word.  
So “DACRY” is the only common word fitting this pattern.

But let’s look for another pattern where C is not in position 1.  
Try: _ _ C A R  
A is in 4 (banned). Fails.  
Try: _ C _ A R  
R is in 5 (banned). Fails.  
Try: C _ _ A R – same as above.

Alternative approach: Let’s list possible positions for A, R, C.

A can be in 2, 3, 5.  
R can be in 1, 3, 4.  
C can be in 2, 3, 4, 5.

Let’s try A in 2, R in 1, C in 3, 4, or 5.

Pattern: R A C _ _ → “R A C _ _” – letters left: D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y.  
Possible words: R A C K Y, R A C K S (S is out), R A C K O (O is out), R A C Y L (not valid), R A C K Y is valid.  
Check: R A C K Y – letters: R, A, C, K, Y. All allowed.  
Position checks:
- A in 2 (ok).  
- R in 1 (ok).  
- C in 3 (ok).  
This seems perfect.

So the next guess is “RACKY”.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: train -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
Guess 3: cubar -> FEEDBACK: C(-) U(x) B(x) A(-) R(-)
Guess 4: racky -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) C(-) K(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on “racky”:

- R(-)  → R is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
- A(✓) → A is in position 2 and is correct.  
- C(-) → C is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
- K(x) → K is NOT in the word.  
- Y(x) → Y is NOT in the word.

Summary of everything we now know:

Letters definitely OUT: O, S, E, T, I, N, U, B, K, Y  
Letters definitely IN and fixed: A in position 2  
Letters definitely IN but position unknown: R, C  
Position constraints:
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2, 5 (from arose, cubar, racky).  
- R must be in 3 or 4.  
- C cannot be in positions 1, 3 (from cubar, racky).  
- C must be in 2, 4, or 5.  
  – But position 2 is fixed as A, so C must be in 4 or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A fixed in position 2.  
2. Contains both R and C, with R in 3 or 4 and C in 4 or 5.  
3. Uses only letters not in the OUT set.

Remaining usable letters (common ones): D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, etc.

Let’s enumerate possible placements:

Case 1: R in 3, C in 4  
Word pattern: _ A R C _  
We need one more letter in positions 1 and 5 from the remaining set.  
Possible first letters: D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W  
Possible fifth letters: same set  
Example: D A R C H → “DARCH” – not a word.  
F A R C H → “FARCH” – not a word.  
G A R C H → “GARCH” – not a word.  
H A R C H → “HARCH” – not a word.  
L A R C H → “LARCH” – valid word.

Check constraints:
- A in 2 (correct).  
- R in 3 (allowed).  
- C in 4 (allowed).  
- Letters used: L, A, R, C, H – none are OUT.

So “LARCH” is a valid candidate.

Case 2: R in 3, C in 5  
Pattern: _ A R _ C  
Need valid letters in 1 and 4.  
Example: D A R B C – B is OUT.  
D A R M C – “DARMC” – not a word.  
F A R M C – not a word.  
H A R M C – not a word.  
L A R M C – not a word.  
No obvious common word here.

Case 3: R in 4, C in 4 – impossible (two letters in same position).  
Case 4: R in 4, C in 5  
Pattern: _ A _ R C  
Need valid letters in 1 and 3.  
Example: D A M R C – not a word.  
F A V R C – not a word.  
H A L R C – not a word.  
L A G R C – not a word.  
No common word found quickly.

Thus the only promising candidate is “LARCH”.
