For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E
- RAISE: R, A, I, S, E
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E

Among these, ""AROSE"" stands out because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us the best chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word early on. 

Therefore, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback:
- A, R, O, S are **not** in the word at all (x for each).
- E is in the word but in the **wrong position** (-).

So the secret word:
- Does **not** contain A, R, O, S.
- **Does** contain E, but not in the 5th position.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E somewhere (positions 1-4).
2. Does not have A, R, O, S.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants to test: T, N, L, C, D, H, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, O are out).

Let’s pick a word that places E in a different position and introduces new common letters. A good candidate is ""UNTIE"":
- U and I are new vowels.
- N and T are common consonants.
- E moves to position 4 (from position 5 in AROSE).

This should help us test new letters while respecting the constraints.

From all feedback so far:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, T, C, L  
Letters that ARE in the word but are in the wrong positions: E, N, I  

So the secret word must contain the letters E, N, I exactly once each, and may contain other letters only from the still-allowed set.  
Still-allowed letters (excluding the eliminated ones): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus the required E, N, I).

We need a valid 5-letter English word that:
- Uses each of E, N, I exactly once.
- Uses only letters from the still-allowed set for the remaining two slots.
- Keeps E, N, I away from the positions they occupied in previous guesses:
  – E cannot be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (because it was in position 5 in AROSE, 4 in UNTIE, and 4 in INCEL).
  – N cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (because it was in position 2 in UNTIE and 2 in INCEL).
  – I cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (because it was in position 3 in INCEL and 4 in UNTIE).

So the only possible positions now:
- E: position 1 or 2
- N: position 1 or 5
- I: position 4 or 5

Let’s try to construct a word that satisfies these constraints and is a valid English word.  
One possibility is “JIVE N” but that’s not 5 letters.  
Another is “MIDGE” but it lacks N.  
After checking, a valid word that fits is “VINED”:
- V (new letter)
- I (position 2, allowed)
- N (position 3, allowed)
- E (position 4, allowed)
- D (new letter)

But “VINED” has E in position 4, which was marked “-” in INCEL (position 4), so E cannot be in position 4.  
Next candidate: “WIVEN” – invalid.  
Next: “PINED” – E in position 4 again, invalid.  
Next: “FINED” – E in 4, invalid.  
Next: “HIVEN” – E in 4, invalid.  
Next: “DINER” – E in 4, invalid.  
Next: “WINE D” – invalid.  
Next: “MIDGE” – lacks N.  
Next: “BINED” – E in 4, invalid.  
Next: “GIVEN” – E in 4, invalid.  
Next: “KIVEN” – E in 4, invalid.  
Next: “YINED” – E in 4, invalid.  

Let’s try E in position 1:  
“E _ _ _ _” – but English words rarely start with E in this context.  

Try E in position 2:  
“_ E _ _ _” – possible.  

Now place N and I:  
N can be in position 5.  
I can be in position 4.  

So pattern: _ E _ I N  

We need two new consonants for positions 1 and 3 from the allowed set.  
Valid word: “F E N I N” – not valid.  
“B E N I N” – not valid.  
“D E N I N” – not valid.  
“G E N I N” – not valid.  
“M E N I N” – not valid.  

Try swapping I to position 5 and N to position 4:  
Pattern: _ E _ N I  

Need new letters for 1 and 3.  
“B E G N I” – not valid.  
“D E B N I” – not valid.  
“F E M N I” – not valid.  
“H E M N I” – not valid.  
“M E D N I” – not valid.  

Try different placement:  
E in 2, I in 4, N in 5: _ E _ I N  
Valid word: “B E G I N” – but G is allowed, B is allowed.  
“BEGIN” is a valid English word.  

Check constraints:
- Letters: B, E, G, I, N  
- Eliminated letters avoided.  
- Positions:  
  – E is in position 2 (allowed, previous positions were 5,4,4)  
  – N is in position 5 (allowed, previous positions 2,2)  
  – I is in position 4 (allowed, previous positions 3,4)  
- New letters introduced: B, G  

This fits all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E
- RAISE: R, A, I, S, E
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E

Among these, ""AROSE"" stands out because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us the best chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word early on. 

Therefore, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- A, R, O, S are **not** in the word at all (x for each).
- E is in the word but in the **wrong position** (-).

So the secret word:
- Does **not** contain A, R, O, S.
- **Does** contain E, but not in the 5th position.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E somewhere (positions 1-4).
2. Does not have A, R, O, S.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants to test: T, N, L, C, D, H, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, O are out).

Let’s pick a word that places E in a different position and introduces new common letters. A good candidate is ""UNTIE"":
- U and I are new vowels.
- N and T are common consonants.
- E moves to position 4 (from position 5 in AROSE).

This should help us test new letters while respecting the constraints.

So far we know:
- Letters not in the word at all: A, R, O, S, U, T.
- Letters that are in the word but in the wrong positions: E, N, I.

The secret word must contain E, N, and I, but none of A, R, O, S, U, T.

We need a 5-letter word that uses only letters not yet eliminated and places E, N, I in new positions. Remaining common consonants to test: D, L, C, H, M, P, G, B, F, K, Y, W, V, etc. Remaining vowels: none (A, O, U are out, E and I are required).

Let’s try to place E, N, I in new positions while introducing new common letters. A good candidate is ""INELD"" but this isn’t a valid English word. Another option is ""FLING"" but it doesn’t contain E, N, or I. 

A valid word that contains E, N, I and uses new common letters is ""INCEL"":
- I in position 1 (new position from previous guess)
- N in position 2 (new position from previous guess)
- C is a new common consonant
- E in position 3 (new position from previous guess)
- L is a new common consonant

This tests two new consonants (C, L) while repositioning E, N, I.

From the new feedback:

- B(x) → B is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and is in the correct position (position 2).
- G(-) → G is in the word but in the wrong position (cannot be position 3).
- I(-) → I is in the word but in the wrong position (cannot be position 4).
- N(✓) → N is in the word and is in the correct position (position 5).

So far we know:
- Fixed letters: _ E _ _ N
- Must include G and I somewhere in the remaining slots (positions 1, 3, or 4), but:
  – G cannot be in position 3.
  – I cannot be in position 4.
- Eliminated letters: A, R, O, S, U, T, C, L, B
- Allowed remaining letters for positions 1, 3, 4: D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus G and I, but they must be placed correctly)

We need a valid 5-letter word with pattern: _ E _ _ N, containing both G and I, with G not in position 3 and I not in position 4.

Possible placements:
- Position 1: G or I
- Position 3: G is forbidden here, so if G is in position 1, then I must be in position 3 or 4 (but 4 is forbidden), so I would be in 3.
- Position 4: I is forbidden, so if I is in position 1, G could be in 3 or 4 (but 3 is forbidden for G), so G would be in 4.

Let's try:
- G in position 1, I in position 3: G E I _ N
  - Need a letter for position 4 from allowed set (D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z)
  - Valid word: G E I D N → ""GEIDN"" (invalid)
  - G E I F N → ""GEIFN"" (invalid)
  - G E I M N → ""GEIMN"" (invalid)
  - G E I P N → ""GEIPN"" (invalid)
  - G E I V N → ""GEIVN"" (invalid)
  - G E I D N etc. all invalid.

- I in position 1, G in position 4: I E _ G N
  - Need a letter for position 3 from allowed set (D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z)
  - Valid word: I E D G N → ""IEDGN"" (invalid)
  - I E M G N → ""IEMGN"" (invalid)
  - I E P G N → ""IEPGN"" (invalid)

  - I E X G N → ""IEWGN"" (invalid)
  - I E Y G N → ""IEYGN"" (invalid)
  - I E Z G N → ""IEZGN"" (invalid)

Hmm, these patterns aren't yielding valid words. Let's try a different approach: look for actual words matching _ E _ _ N that contain both G and I, with G not in position 3 and I not in position 4.

Valid English words fitting _ E _ _ N:
- ""MEDIA"" – but A is eliminated.
- ""MENUS"" – S is eliminated.
- ""JENGA"" – A is eliminated.
- ""GENIE"" – E is already in position 2, so this would have E twice (invalid).
- ""FENGI"" – doesn't fit _ E _ _ N.
- ""PENGI"" – doesn't fit.
- ""VENGI"" – doesn't fit.
- ""WENGI"" – doesn't fit.
- ""YENGI"" – doesn't fit.
- ""ZENGI"" – doesn't fit.

Wait, let's list actual 5-letter words ending in N with E in position 2 and containing both G and I:
- ""GEING"" – invalid
- ""GEGIN"" – invalid
- ""I Ging"" – invalid

This suggests we might need to try a word where G or I is in a position we didn't consider, but the constraints seem tight. However, we missed ""JEING"" (invalid) and ""MEING"" (invalid).

Actually, a valid word is ""GEING"" but it's not recognized. Let me think differently: perhaps G is in position 1 and I is in position 4, but I cannot be in position 4. 

Re-examining constraints:
- _ E _ _ N
- Must contain G and I
- G cannot be in position 3
- I cannot be in position 4

Possible valid placement:
- Position 1: I
- Position 3: G (but G cannot be in position 3 – conflict)
- Position 1: G
- Position 3: I (allowed, since I has not been in position 3 before)
- Pattern: G E I _ N
  - Need a letter for position 4 that is allowed and forms a valid word.
  - ""GEIDN"" – invalid
  - ""GEIFN"" – invalid
  - ""GEIMN"" – invalid
  - ""GEIPN"" – invalid
  - ""GEIVN"" – invalid
  - ""GEIZN"" – invalid

This path doesn't work. Let's try:
- Position 1: D
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: G
- Pattern: D E I G N → ""DEIGN"" (valid word!)

Check constraints:
- D is allowed (not eliminated)
- E is fixed in position 2
- I is in position 3 (allowed, not previously in 3)
- G is in position 4 (allowed, not in position 3)
- N is fixed in position 5

""DEIGN"" is a valid English word meaning to value or esteem highly.

This fits all constraints.
