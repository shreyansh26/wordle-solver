For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should include several of these letters, especially vowels. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which will help identify vowel positions quickly
- No repeated letters

This gives me maximum coverage of common letters and should provide good feedback for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

- Uses other common letters not yet ruled out (T, L, N, I, C, etc.).

A good candidate is “ROUTE”:
- Contains R, O, U, T, E.
- U and T are common and not yet ruled out.
- R is in position 1 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of position 2).
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of position 3).
- E is in position 5 (disallowed, because E was ruled out of position 5). Oops, this fails.

Next candidate: “TROPE”:
- T, R, O, P, E.
- R in position 2 (disallowed). Fails.

Next: “CRORE”:
- C, R, O, R, E.
- R appears twice; position 2 still disallowed for R. Fails.

Next: “ELOPE”:
- E, L, O, P, E.
- E appears twice; position 5 disallowed for E. Fails.

Next: “FRONT”:
- F, R, O, N, T.
- Contains R, O, but not E. Fails (must include E).

Next: “EERIE”:
- E, E, R, I, E.
- E in position 5 disallowed. Fails.

Next: “ENTRY”:
- E, N, T, R, Y.
- Contains E, R, O is missing. Fails.

Next: “COWER”:
- C, O, W, E, R.
- Contains C, O, W, E, R.
- R is in position 5 (allowed).
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of position 3).
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of position 5).
- C and W are new letters; common enough.

This seems valid.

From the new feedback on “cower”:

- C(✓) – C is in the word and in position 1.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in position 2.
- W(x) – W is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in position 4.
- R(✓) – R is in the word and in position 5.

So the secret word now looks like: C O _ E R.

Known:
- Positions 1, 2, 4, 5 are fixed: C O _ E R.
- Position 3 is unknown and must be a letter that has not yet been ruled out (not A, S, W).

Letters not yet used and common: T, L, N, I, D, M, etc.

Possible 3rd letters that form a valid 5-letter word: T, L, N, I, D, M.

Possible candidates: C O T E R, C O L E R, C O N E R, C O I E R, C O D E R, C O M E R.

Valid English words among these: “coter”, “color”, “corner”, “coier”, “coder”, “comet” (but must be 5 letters starting with CO and ending with ER).

Valid ones: COTER (archaic), COLOR (valid), CORNER (valid), CIDER (invalid), COMER (valid).

Among these, “color” and “corner” are most likely. Both fit the pattern C O _ E R.

Let’s choose “color” as the next guess.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should include several of these letters, especially vowels. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which will help identify vowel positions quickly
- No repeated letters

This gives me maximum coverage of common letters and should provide good feedback for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on “arose”:

- A(x) – A is not in the word.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains R, O, E (in any positions except the ones ruled out above).
- Does not contain A or S.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should include several of these letters, especially vowels. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which will help identify vowel positions quickly
- No repeated letters

This gives me maximum coverage of common letters and should provide good feedback for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:

- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: A, S.
- Letters definitely present: R, O, E.
- R is not in position 2.
- O is not in position 3.
- E is not in position 5.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains R, O, E (in any positions except the ones ruled out above).
- Does not contain A or S.
- Uses other common letters not yet ruled out (T, L, N, I, C, etc.).

A good candidate is “ROUTE”:
- Contains R, O, U, T, E.
- U and T are common and not yet ruled out.
- R is in position 1 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of position 2).
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of position 3).
- E is in position 5 (disallowed, because E was ruled out of position 5). Oops, this fails.

Next candidate: “TROPE”:
- T, R, O, P, E.
- R in position 2 (disallowed). Fails.

Next: “CRORE”:
- C, R, O, R, E.
- R appears twice; position 2 still disallowed for R. Fails.

Next: “ELOPE”:
- E, L, O, P, E.
- E appears twice; position 5 disallowed for E. Fails.

Next: “FRONT”:
- F, R, O, N, T.
- Contains R, O, but not E. Fails (must include E).

Next: “EERIE”:
- E, E, R, I, E.
- E in position 5 disallowed. Fails.

Next: “ENTRY”:
- E, N, T, R, Y.
- Contains E, R, O is missing. Fails.

Next: “COWER”:
- C, O, W, E, R.
- Contains C, O, W, E, R.
- R is in position 5 (allowed).
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of position 3).
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of position 5).
- C and W are new letters; common enough.

This seems valid.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: cower -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) W(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on “cower”:

- C(✓) – C is in the word and in position 1.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in position 2.
- W(x) – W is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in position 4.
- R(✓) – R is in the word and in position 5.

So the secret word now looks like: C O _ E R.

Known:
- Positions 1, 2, 4, 5 are fixed: C O _ E R.
- Position 3 is unknown and must be a letter that has not yet been ruled out (not A, S, W).

Letters not yet used and common: T, L, N, I, D, M, etc.

Possible 3rd letters that form a valid 5-letter word: T, L, N, I, D, M.

Possible candidates: C O T E R, C O L E R, C O N E R, C O I E R, C O D E R, C O M E R.

Valid English words among these: “coter”, “color”, “corner”, “coier”, “coder”, “comet” (but must be 5 letters starting with CO and ending with ER).

Valid ones: COTER (archaic), COLOR (valid), CORNER (valid), CIDER (invalid), COMER (valid).

Among these, “color” and “corner” are most likely. Both fit the pattern C O _ E R.

Let’s choose “color” as the next guess.

From the feedback so far:

- Word pattern: C O _ E R
- Letters definitely absent: A, S, W, L
- Letters definitely present and fixed: C (pos 1), O (pos 2), E (pos 4), R (pos 5)
- Position 3 must be a letter not yet ruled out and not already used in its position.

Letters not yet ruled out and not used yet: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Common letters that fit position 3 and make a valid word:
- N: C O N E R → ""corner""
- M: C O M E R → ""comer""
- D: C O D E R → ""coder""
- T: C O T E R → ""coter"" (less common)
- I: C O I E R → ""coier"" (not a standard word)

Among these, ""corner"", ""comer"", and ""coder"" are all valid English words. ""Corner"" is the most common, so we'll try it next.

If ""corner"" is correct, the feedback should confirm all letters. If not, we'll know the third letter is among the others.
