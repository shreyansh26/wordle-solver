1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, T, R, O, S, etc. 

One of the most common 5-letter words in English is ""AROSE"" because it contains several of these high-frequency letters (A, R, O, S, E). This should give me good information about which letters are present and possibly their positions.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but not in the 4th position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has S somewhere other than position 4.
2. Uses none of A, R, O, E.

Good remaining letters to test: T, I, N, L, U, C, H, M, Y, D, etc.

Let’s pick a word with S in a different position and common remaining letters.  
“STINT” uses S in position 1 and tests T, I, N.  
But T and I are common and helpful.

Another option is “SULKY” (S in 1st, U, L, K, Y), but “STINT” is simpler.

Let’s choose “STINT” as it tests S in position 1 and common letters T, I, N.

Let’s summarize the clues so far.

Known facts:
1. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, N  
2. Letters in the word but in the wrong positions:  
   – S (not in position 1 or 4)  
   – T (not in position 2 or 5)  
   – I (not in position 3)  
3. T is in the word and in the correct position 5.

So the word ends in T, and contains S, T, I somewhere else (but not in the positions already ruled out).

We need a 5-letter word ending in T that:
- Contains S (not in position 1 or 4)
- Contains I (not in position 3)
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E, N

Remaining common letters to try: C, L, U, M, Y, D, H, G, B, F, K, P, V, W, X, Z, etc.

A good candidate is “SPLIT”:
- Ends in T (✓)
- S is in position 1 (but we know S is not in position 1 from STINT feedback, so this is invalid).

Next candidate: “SLIT” is only 4 letters.

Try “CLIST” – invalid (not a word).

Try “WITCH” – ends in H, not T.

Try “MISTY” – ends in Y, not T.

Try “CUTIE” – ends in E, not T, and contains E (invalid).

Try “DUSTY” – ends in Y, not T.

Try “FUSTY” – ends in Y, not T.

Try “GUSTY” – ends in Y, not T.

Try “HUSTY” – ends in Y, not T.

Try “LUSTY” – ends in Y, not T.

Try “MUSTY” – ends in Y, not T.

Try “PUSHT” – ends in T, has S (position 1, invalid).

Try “WUSHT” – ends in T, has S (position 1, invalid).

Try “CUTST” – ends in T, has S (position 3, allowed), and T (position 5, correct).  
But CUTST is not a valid English word.

Try “SUTLE” – ends in E, invalid.

Try “SULIT” – ends in T, has S (position 1, invalid).

Try “SPLIT” – already ruled out.

Try “SWIFT” – ends in T, has S (position 1, invalid).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, T, R, O, S, etc. 

One of the most common 5-letter words in English is ""AROSE"" because it contains several of these high-frequency letters (A, R, O, S, E). This should give me good information about which letters are present and possibly their positions.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but not in the 4th position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has S somewhere other than position 4.
2. Uses none of A, R, O, E.

Good remaining letters to test: T, I, N, L, U, C, H, M, Y, D, etc.

Let’s pick a word with S in a different position and common remaining letters.  
“STINT” uses S in position 1 and tests T, I, N.  
But T and I are common and helpful.

Another option is “SULKY” (S in 1st, U, L, K, Y), but “STINT” is simpler.

Let’s choose “STINT” as it tests S in position 1 and common letters T, I, N.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, T, R, O, S, etc. 

One of the most common 5-letter words in English is ""AROSE"" because it contains several of these high-frequency letters (A, R, O, S, E). This should give me good information about which letters are present and possibly their positions.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but not in the 4th position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has S somewhere other than position 4.
2. Uses none of A, R, O, E.

Good remaining letters to test: T, I, N, L, U, C, H, M, Y, D, etc.

Let’s pick a word with S in a different position and common remaining letters.  
“STINT” uses S in position 1 and tests T, I, N.  
But T and I are common and helpful.

Another option is “SULKY” (S in 1st, U, L, K, Y), but “STINT” is simpler.

Let’s choose “STINT” as it tests S in position 1 and common letters T, I, N.

- I(✓) → I is in the word AND in the correct position (position 4).
- C(x) → C is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ S I _
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, E, N, M, U, C
- T is known to be in position 5 (from STINT feedback).
- Therefore T is fixed in position 5.

Current pattern: _ _ S I T

Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, L, Y.

Let’s pick a common word that fits _ _ S I T:
- B S I T → needs a first letter, e.g., B S I T → but we need 5 letters.
- Possible words: ""BISIT"" (invalid), ""FISIT"" (invalid), ""GISTS"" (invalid), ""HISTS"" (invalid), ""LISIT"" (invalid), ""VISIT"" → VISIT is a valid word.

Check VISIT:
- V, I, S, I, T
- Letters: V, I, S, I, T
- I is in position 2 (but we already have I in position 4 from MUSIC feedback) – but the word can have I in multiple positions.  
Wait, MUSIC feedback only told us I is in position 4, not that it cannot appear elsewhere.  
VISIT has I in positions 2 and 4, which is allowed.

But let’s check if VISIT uses any ruled-out letters:
- V, I, S, I, T: none of A, R, O, E, N, M, U, C are present.  
This fits all constraints.

So VISIT is a valid next guess.
