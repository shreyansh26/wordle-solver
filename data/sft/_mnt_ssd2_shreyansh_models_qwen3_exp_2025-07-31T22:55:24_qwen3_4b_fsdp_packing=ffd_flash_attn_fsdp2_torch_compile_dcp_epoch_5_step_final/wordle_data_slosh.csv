### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- ARISE (contains A, R, I, S, E)

I think ""ARISE"" is a strong choice because it includes:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- I (another common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give me good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

BLOSS is a valid 5-letter word (meaning a small, rounded fruit or a type of growth). It uses B, L, O, S, S. None of the excluded letters are used.

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- ARISE (contains A, R, I, S, E)

I think ""ARISE"" is a strong choice because it includes:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- I (another common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give me good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

We need to fill the 1st, 3rd, and 5th positions with allowed letters.

Looking for common words:
- BLAST: B, L, A, S, T → A is excluded.
- CLASP: C, L, A, S, P → A and P excluded.
- FLASK: F, L, A, S, K → A excluded.
- GLASS: G, L, A, S, S → A excluded.
- H L _ S _ → HL... not a common start.
- J L _ S _ → JL... not a common start.
- K L _ S _ → KL... not a common start.
- N L _ S _ → NL... not a common start.
- T L _ S _ → TL... not a common start.
- W L _ S _ → WL... not a common start.
- Y L _ S _ → YL... not a common start.

Looking for other patterns:
- _ L _ S _ → possible words: FLICK (but ends with K, not S), CLINK (ends with K), BLINT (not a word), SLING (but S is 1st, not 4th).

Wait, let's think differently. The pattern is _ L _ S _, so the word must be 1st letter, L, 3rd letter, S, 5th letter.

Possible words:
- FLICK → ends with K, not S.
- CLINK → ends with K.
- BLINT → not a word.
- SLING → S is 1st, not 4th.
- PLUSH → P is excluded.
- B L O S S → B, L, O, S, S → O is allowed, S is allowed, but double S is okay.
- BLOSS → B, L, O, S, S → fits pattern _ L _ S _ and uses allowed letters.

BLOSS is a valid 5-letter word (meaning a small, rounded fruit or a type of growth). It uses B, L, O, S, S. None of the excluded letters are used.

Let's check:
- B (not excluded)
- L (already known in 2nd position)
- O (not excluded)
- S (known in 4th position)
- S (allowed, no restriction on repeats)

So BLOSS is a valid next guess.

From the new feedback on BLOSS:
- B(x) → B is not in the word.
- L(✓) → L is still correct in 2nd position (already known).
- O(✓) → O is in the word and in the 3rd position.
- S(✓) → S is correct in 4th position (already known).
- S(-) → the final S is in the word but not in the 5th position (so S appears twice, once in 4th and once in 1st or 3rd). However, we already know 3rd is O, so S must be in 1st position.

So the pattern is now:
1st letter: S
2nd letter: L
3rd letter: O
4th letter: S
5th letter: ?

Therefore the word is S L O S _.

Letters already ruled out: A, R, I, E, U, M, P, B.

Possible letters left for 5th position: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit S L O S _:
- SLOSH → S, L, O, S, H → H is allowed.
- SLOST → not a common word.
- SLOST is not valid, SLOSH is valid.

So the next guess is SLOSH.
