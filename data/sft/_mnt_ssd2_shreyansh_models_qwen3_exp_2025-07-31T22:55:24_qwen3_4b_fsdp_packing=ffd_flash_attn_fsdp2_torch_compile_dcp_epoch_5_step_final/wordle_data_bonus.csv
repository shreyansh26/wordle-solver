### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English are A, E, I, O, U, R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess should use these letters without repeating any to test as many possibilities as possible. 

Some good starting words are:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (contains A, U, D, I, O)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers five very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and is a valid 5-letter word.

The feedback from SLATE tells us:
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- The word contains S somewhere (but not first).
- The word does NOT contain L, A, T, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has S in one of positions 2-5.
2. Does not contain L, A, T, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good letters to try next: R, I, N, O, U, D, C, M, P, etc.

A strong candidate is ""CRISP"":
- C (new letter)
- R (new letter)
- I (new letter)
- S (must be in word, and position 4 here)
- P (new letter)

This tests 5 new letters (C, R, I, S, P) with S in position 4, which is allowed by the feedback.

From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - L, A, T, E are not in the word.

2. CRISP → C(x) R(x) I(x) S(-) P(x)
   - C, R, I, P are not in the word.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4 (confirmed by second guess).

So far we know:
- The word contains S, and S is NOT in positions 1 or 4.
- The word does NOT contain: L, A, T, E, C, R, I, P.
- Therefore S must be in position 2, 3, or 5.

Remaining common letters to test: D, N, O, U, M, G, H, B, F, K, Y, W, V, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses S in position 2, 3, or 5.
- Uses only letters from the allowed set (no L,A,T,E,C,R,I,P).

A good next guess would test several new letters while placing S in a new position. Let’s try “BONUS”:
- B (new)
- O (new)
- U (new)
- N (new)
- S (must be in word, placed in position 5).

This uses four new letters and places S in position 5, which is still allowed by the feedback.
