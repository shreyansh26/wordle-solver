For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring letters like A, E, T, R, S, etc. 

One of the most common 5-letter words is ""AROSE"", which contains:
- A (very common starting letter)
- R (very common)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives me a good chance to discover several letters that are in the secret word, regardless of their positions. Another good candidate might be ""SLATE"" or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better based on letter frequency analysis.

I'll go with AROSE as my first guess because it covers several high-frequency letters and vowels.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(-): A is in the word but not in the first position.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(-): S is in the word but not in the fourth position.
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and S, but not R, O, or E.
- A cannot be first, and S cannot be fourth.

Letters we know are out: R, O, E  
Letters we know are in: A, S

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A and S somewhere (but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively)
- Does not contain R, O, or E

Good candidates should use other common letters like T, N, I, L, C, D, etc.

Possible words:
- STAIN (but has I and N, but S is first, which is allowed)
- SAINT (A is second, S is first)
- STAND (but has D)
- STASH (but has H)
- STAIN (valid)
- STAIN seems good because it uses S, A, I, N, T - none of the excluded letters.

Let me check STAIN:
- S is first (allowed, since feedback only said S is not fourth)
- A is second (allowed, since feedback only said A is not first)
- I, N, T are new letters to test
- No R, O, E

This seems like a solid second guess.

One of the most common 5-letter words is ""AROSE"", which contains:

- R (very common)
- O (common vowel)

- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives me a good chance to discover several letters that are in the secret word, regardless of their positions. Another good candidate might be ""SLATE"" or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better based on letter frequency analysis.

- N(x) : N is not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word starts with S.
- It contains A, but A is not in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since in AROSE A was not first and in STAIN it was not third).
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E, T, I, N.
- Remaining common letters to test: D, L, C, U, Y, etc.

Possible positions for A: 2 or 5 (since 1,3,4 are ruled out).

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, containing A in position 2 or 5, and avoiding the eliminated letters.

Let’s try a word where A is in position 2: S _ A _ _.

Good candidates:
- SCALY (but Y is possible)
- SCARF (but R is eliminated)
- SCAMP (but P is possible)
- SCALD (but L and D are possible)

SCALY seems good: S C A L Y. It places A in position 3, but that contradicts our earlier conclusion that A is not in position 3. So SCALY is invalid.

Next, try A in position 5: S _ _ _ A.

Good candidates:
- SLASH (but H is possible)
- SLANG (but G is possible)
- SCALD (but D is possible)

SLASH: S L A S H. This has S in position 1 (correct), A in position 3 (invalid). So no.

SLANG: S L A N G. But N is eliminated.

SCALD: S C A L D. A is in position 3 (invalid).

Next: S _ _ A _.

SCUBA: but B is possible, U is possible.

SCUBA: S C U B A. A is in position 5 (valid), no eliminated letters. This seems good.

Check letters: S, C, U, B, A. None of R, O, E, T, I, N are present. A is in position 5 (allowed). S is in position 1 (correct). 

This looks like a solid third guess.

From all the feedback so far:

2. STAIN → S(✓) T(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)
3. SCUBA → S(✓) C(x) U(x) B(x) A(-)

Key deductions:
- Word starts with S (S ✓ in first position).
- Contains A, but A is NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (because it was marked “-” in positions 1, 3, and 4).  
  Therefore A must be in position 5.
- Eliminated letters: R, O, E, T, I, N, C, U, B.
- Remaining common letters to test: D, L, G, H, Y, M, P, K, F, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S.
- Ends with A.
- Uses none of the eliminated letters.
- Contains no other eliminated letters.

Possible patterns: S _ _ _ A

Candidate words:
- SLASH → S L A S H → contains S twice (but we already know S is only in first position), and H is possible.
- SHARK → R is eliminated.
- SHADY → D, Y are possible.
- SPADA → not a valid English word.
- SLAGA → not valid.
- SLAVA → not valid.
- SLASH → valid, but S appears twice (and we don’t know if S appears more than once).
- SHADA → not valid.
- SLAGA → not valid.
- SLASH seems the only valid candidate left.

But SLASH has S in position 4, which is allowed (we only know S is in position 1). However, we have no evidence against S appearing again.

Another candidate: SHAVA → not valid.
Another: SHADA → not valid.
Another: SLAVA → not valid.

Actually, let’s list valid English 5-letter words starting with S, ending with A, and containing only allowed letters (no R, O, E, T, I, N, C, U, B).

Another candidate: SHAVA is not valid. SLAGA is not valid. SLAVA is not valid.

Wait, let’s check again: are there any other valid words?

- SHAVA – not valid.
- SHADA – not valid.
- SLAVA – not valid.
- SLASH – valid.

Therefore, SLASH is the only valid candidate left that fits all constraints.

But let’s double-check:
- SLASH: S L A S H
  - S in position 1 (correct)
  - A in position 3 (but we know A is NOT in position 3) – this contradicts our deduction that A must be in position 5.

Ah, my earlier analysis was wrong: the feedback on SCUBA shows A(-) in position 5, meaning A is in the word but NOT in position 5. This contradicts my previous conclusion.

Re-examining:

From SCUBA feedback: A(-) in position 5 means A is in the word but NOT in position 5.  
Therefore A must be in position 2 (since it cannot be in 1,3,4,5).

So pattern: S _ A _ _

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring letters like A, E, T, R, S, etc. 

One of the most common 5-letter words is ""AROSE"", which contains:
- A (very common starting letter)
- R (very common)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives me a good chance to discover several letters that are in the secret word, regardless of their positions. Another good candidate might be ""SLATE"" or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better based on letter frequency analysis.

I'll go with AROSE as my first guess because it covers several high-frequency letters and vowels.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(-): A is in the word but not in the first position.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(-): S is in the word but not in the fourth position.
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and S, but not R, O, or E.
- A cannot be first, and S cannot be fourth.

Letters we know are out: R, O, E  
Letters we know are in: A, S

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A and S somewhere (but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively)
- Does not contain R, O, or E

Good candidates should use other common letters like T, N, I, L, C, D, etc.

Possible words:
- STAIN (but has I and N, but S is first, which is allowed)
- SAINT (A is second, S is first)
- STAND (but has D)
- STASH (but has H)
- STAIN (valid)
- STAIN seems good because it uses S, A, I, N, T - none of the excluded letters.

Let me check STAIN:
- S is first (allowed, since feedback only said S is not fourth)
- A is second (allowed, since feedback only said A is not first)
- I, N, T are new letters to test
- No R, O, E

This seems like a solid second guess.

From the new feedback on STAIN:

- S(✓) : S is in the word and in the first position.
- T(x) : T is not in the word.
- A(-) : A is in the word but not in the third position.
- I(x) : I is not in the word.
- N(x) : N is not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word starts with S.
- It contains A, but A is not in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since in AROSE A was not first and in STAIN it was not third).
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E, T, I, N.
- Remaining common letters to test: D, L, C, U, Y, etc.

Possible positions for A: 2 or 5 (since 1,3,4 are ruled out).

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, containing A in position 2 or 5, and avoiding the eliminated letters.

Let’s try a word where A is in position 2: S _ A _ _.

Good candidates:
- SCALY (but Y is possible)
- SCARF (but R is eliminated)
- SCAMP (but P is possible)
- SCALD (but L and D are possible)

SCALY seems good: S C A L Y. It places A in position 3, but that contradicts our earlier conclusion that A is not in position 3. So SCALY is invalid.

Next, try A in position 5: S _ _ _ A.

Good candidates:
- SLASH (but H is possible)
- SLANG (but G is possible)
- SCALD (but D is possible)

SLASH: S L A S H. This has S in position 1 (correct), A in position 3 (invalid). So no.

SLANG: S L A N G. But N is eliminated.

SCALD: S C A L D. A is in position 3 (invalid).

Next: S _ _ A _.

SCUBA: but B is possible, U is possible.

SCUBA: S C U B A. A is in position 5 (valid), no eliminated letters. This seems good.

Check letters: S, C, U, B, A. None of R, O, E, T, I, N are present. A is in position 5 (allowed). S is in position 1 (correct). 

This looks like a solid third guess.

Another candidate: SHAVA → not valid.
Another: SHADA → not valid.
Another: SLAVA → not valid.

Actually, let’s list valid English 5-letter words starting with S, ending with A, and containing only allowed letters (no R, O, E, T, I, N, C, U, B).

- SHAVA – not valid.
- SHADA – not valid.
- SLAVA – not valid.
- SLASH – valid.

Therefore, SLASH is the only valid candidate left that fits all constraints.

But let’s double-check:
- SLASH: S L A S H
  - S in position 1 (correct)
  - A in position 3 (but we know A is NOT in position 3) – this contradicts our deduction that A must be in position 5.

Ah, my earlier analysis was wrong: the feedback on SCUBA shows A(-) in position 5, meaning A is in the word but NOT in position 5. This contradicts my previous conclusion.

Therefore A must be in position 2 (since it cannot be in 1,3,4,5).

Candidate words:
- SABLE → B is eliminated.
- SAGAS → G is allowed, but S is repeated (but we don’t know if S repeats).
- SAGGY → G, Y are allowed.
- SAGRA → R is eliminated.
- SAGGY seems valid: S A G G Y.
- SAGAS: S A G A S – but A is in position 4, which we know is invalid.
- SAGGY: S A G G Y – A is in position 2 (valid), no eliminated letters.

Another candidate: SADLY → D, L, Y are allowed, but Y is position 5, A is position 2.

SADLY: S A D L Y – valid, uses allowed letters, A in position 2.

Between SAGGY and SADLY, both fit. Let’s choose SADLY as it uses more common letters.

<guess>SADLY</guess>From all feedback, we now know:

- Word starts with S (S ✓ in position 1).
- Contains A, but A is NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (from STAIN and SCUBA feedback).  
  Therefore A must be in position 2.
- Eliminated letters: R, O, E, T, I, N, C, U, B.

We need a 5-letter word of the form S A _ _ _, using only allowed letters (no R, O, E, T, I, N, C, U, B).

Candidate words:
- SAGGY (S A G G Y)
- SADLY (S A D L Y)

Both fit, but SADLY uses more common letters. I’ll choose SADLY.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring letters like A, E, T, R, S, etc. 

One of the most common 5-letter words is ""AROSE"", which contains:
- A (very common starting letter)
- R (very common)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives me a good chance to discover several letters that are in the secret word, regardless of their positions. Another good candidate might be ""SLATE"" or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better based on letter frequency analysis.

I'll go with AROSE as my first guess because it covers several high-frequency letters and vowels.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(-): A is in the word but not in the first position.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(-): S is in the word but not in the fourth position.
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and S, but not R, O, or E.
- A cannot be first, and S cannot be fourth.

Letters we know are out: R, O, E  
Letters we know are in: A, S

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A and S somewhere (but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively)
- Does not contain R, O, or E

Good candidates should use other common letters like T, N, I, L, C, D, etc.

Possible words:
- STAIN (but has I and N, but S is first, which is allowed)
- SAINT (A is second, S is first)
- STAND (but has D)
- STASH (but has H)
- STAIN (valid)
- STAIN seems good because it uses S, A, I, N, T - none of the excluded letters.

Let me check STAIN:
- S is first (allowed, since feedback only said S is not fourth)
- A is second (allowed, since feedback only said A is not first)
- I, N, T are new letters to test
- No R, O, E

This seems like a solid second guess.

Guess 2: STAIN -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>

From the new feedback on STAIN:

- S(✓) : S is in the word and in the first position.
- T(x) : T is not in the word.
- A(-) : A is in the word but not in the third position.
- I(x) : I is not in the word.
- N(x) : N is not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word starts with S.
- It contains A, but A is not in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since in AROSE A was not first and in STAIN it was not third).
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E, T, I, N.
- Remaining common letters to test: D, L, C, U, Y, etc.

Possible positions for A: 2 or 5 (since 1,3,4 are ruled out).

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, containing A in position 2 or 5, and avoiding the eliminated letters.

Let’s try a word where A is in position 2: S _ A _ _.

Good candidates:
- SCALY (but Y is possible)
- SCARF (but R is eliminated)
- SCAMP (but P is possible)
- SCALD (but L and D are possible)

SCALY seems good: S C A L Y. It places A in position 3, but that contradicts our earlier conclusion that A is not in position 3. So SCALY is invalid.

Next, try A in position 5: S _ _ _ A.

Good candidates:
- SLASH (but H is possible)
- SLANG (but G is possible)
- SCALD (but D is possible)

SLASH: S L A S H. This has S in position 1 (correct), A in position 3 (invalid). So no.

SLANG: S L A N G. But N is eliminated.

SCALD: S C A L D. A is in position 3 (invalid).

Next: S _ _ A _.

SCUBA: but B is possible, U is possible.

SCUBA: S C U B A. A is in position 5 (valid), no eliminated letters. This seems good.

Check letters: S, C, U, B, A. None of R, O, E, T, I, N are present. A is in position 5 (allowed). S is in position 1 (correct). 

This looks like a solid third guess.

2. STAIN → S(✓) T(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)
3. SCUBA → S(✓) C(x) U(x) B(x) A(-)

Key deductions:
- Word starts with S (S ✓ in first position).
- Contains A, but A is NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (because it was marked “-” in positions 1, 3, and 4).  
  Therefore A must be in position 5.
- Eliminated letters: R, O, E, T, I, N, C, U, B.
- Remaining common letters to test: D, L, G, H, Y, M, P, K, F, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S.
- Ends with A.
- Uses none of the eliminated letters.
- Contains no other eliminated letters.

Possible patterns: S _ _ _ A

Candidate words:
- SLASH → S L A S H → contains S twice (but we already know S is only in first position), and H is possible.
- SHARK → R is eliminated.
- SHADY → D, Y are possible.
- SPADA → not a valid English word.
- SLAGA → not valid.
- SLAVA → not valid.
- SLASH → valid, but S appears twice (and we don’t know if S appears more than once).
- SHADA → not valid.
- SLAGA → not valid.
- SLASH seems the only valid candidate left.

But SLASH has S in position 4, which is allowed (we only know S is in position 1). However, we have no evidence against S appearing again.

Another candidate: SHAVA → not valid.
Another: SHADA → not valid.
Another: SLAVA → not valid.

Actually, let’s list valid English 5-letter words starting with S, ending with A, and containing only allowed letters (no R, O, E, T, I, N, C, U, B).

Valid words:
- SLASH
- SHAVA (not valid)
- SLAGA (not valid)
- SLAVA (not valid)
- SLASH seems the only valid one left.

But SLASH has S in position 4, which is allowed (we only know S is in position 1). However, we have no information about S appearing again.

Another candidate: SHAVA is not valid. SLAGA is not valid. SLAVA is not valid.

Wait, let’s check again: are there any other valid words?

- SHAVA – not valid.
- SHADA – not valid.
- SLAVA – not valid.
- SLASH – valid.

Therefore, SLASH is the only valid candidate left that fits all constraints.

But let’s double-check:
- SLASH: S L A S H
  - S in position 1 (correct)
  - A in position 3 (but we know A is NOT in position 3) – this contradicts our deduction that A must be in position 5.

Ah, my earlier analysis was wrong: the feedback on SCUBA shows A(-) in position 5, meaning A is in the word but NOT in position 5. This contradicts my previous conclusion.

Re-examining:

From SCUBA feedback: A(-) in position 5 means A is in the word but NOT in position 5.  
Therefore A must be in position 2 (since it cannot be in 1,3,4,5).

So pattern: S _ A _ _

Eliminated letters: R, O, E, T, I, N, C, U, B.

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, having A in position 2, and using only allowed letters.

Possible patterns: S A _ _ _

Candidate words:
- SABLE → B is eliminated.
- SAGAS → G is allowed, but S is repeated (but we don’t know if S repeats).
- SAGGY → G, Y are allowed.
- SAGRA → R is eliminated.
- SAGGY seems valid: S A G G Y.
- SAGAS: S A G A S – but A is in position 4, which we know is invalid.
- SAGGY: S A G G Y – A is in position 2 (valid), no eliminated letters.

Another candidate: SADLY → D, L, Y are allowed, but Y is position 5, A is position 2.

SADLY: S A D L Y – valid, uses allowed letters, A in position 2.

Between SAGGY and SADLY, both fit. Let’s choose SADLY as it uses more common letters.

From the feedback on SADLY:

- S(✓) : S is in position 1 (correct).
- A(✓) : A is in position 2 (correct).
- D(x) : D is not in the word.
- L(x) : L is not in the word.
- Y(✓) : Y is in position 5 (correct).

So the secret word is now S A _ _ Y.

Letters we know are NOT in the word: R, O, E, T, I, N, C, U, B, D, L.

Letters still allowed: F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (and any others not yet eliminated).

We need a 5-letter word starting with SA and ending with Y, using only the allowed letters for positions 3 and 4.

Possible patterns: S A _ _ Y.

Common English words fitting this pattern:
- SAGGY (but G is allowed, and we haven't ruled it out yet)
- SAVORY (but O is eliminated)
- SAVAY (not a valid word)
- SAWAY (not valid)
- SAGGY is valid and uses only allowed letters (G is allowed, and we haven't seen G eliminated yet).

Let's check SAGGY:
- S A G G Y
- S, A, Y are already confirmed in their correct positions.
- G is allowed (not yet eliminated).

Therefore, SAGGY is a valid candidate.

Another possibility: SAVAY is invalid, SAWAY is invalid, SAVORY is invalid (O eliminated), etc.

Hence, the only plausible word left is SAGGY.
