For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these.

Looking at common 5-letter starting words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended because it includes:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of frequent letters to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: x → S is not in the word at all.
- L: - → L is in the word but not in position 2.
- A: - → A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T: x → T is not in the word.
- E: - → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
1. Letters present: L, A, E
2. Letters absent: S, T
3. Positions to avoid: L not in 2, A not in 3, E not in 5

We need a 5-letter word that contains L, A, E and does not contain S or T. Also, we need to place L, A, E in positions other than 2, 3, 5 respectively.

Possible candidates: 
- LEAVE: contains L, E, A, but E would be in position 2 (allowed), A in position 3 (forbidden). So reject.
- LEANT: contains T (forbidden).
- ALONE: contains L in position 2 (forbidden), A in 1 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed). But L is in position 2, which is forbidden.
- LAIDE: contains A in 2 (allowed), L in 1 (allowed), E in 5 (forbidden). Reject.
- LEAID: contains A in 2 (allowed), L in 1 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), but D is new letter.
- LEAVE: already checked.
- LEAGU: contains G, U which are new letters.

Wait, let's think systematically:
We need L, A, E plus two other letters (not S or T).

Good letters to try next: R, N, D, C, H, M, P, etc.

Possible words:
- LEARN: contains L, E, A, R, N. L in 1 (allowed), A in 3 (forbidden). Reject.
- LEAGUE: contains L, E, A, G, U, E. A in 3 (forbidden). Reject.
- LEAKY: contains L, E, A, K, Y. A in 3 (forbidden). Reject.
- LEAPT: contains T (forbidden). Reject.
- LEAVE: A in 3 (forbidden). Reject.
- LEAVE: already tried.

Alternative approach: place A not in 3, E not in 5, L not in 2.

Possible positions:
- A could be in 1,2,4,5
- E could be in 1,2,3,4
- L could be in 1,3,4,5

Let's try:
- LEAID: A in 2, L in 1, E in 4. This seems valid. But D is new, I is new. Maybe okay.
- LEAPT: T forbidden.
- LEAGU: A in 3 forbidden.
- LEAVE: A in 3 forbidden.
- LEARN: A in 3 forbidden.
- LEAVE: same.
- LEAVE: same.

Another candidate: LEAKY (A in 3 forbidden). No.

What about:
- LEAID: A in 2, L in 1, E in 4. This seems valid. But D and I are new letters.

But maybe a better candidate is LEAID or LEAVE-like. Alternatively, maybe LEAVE is the closest but A is in 3 which is forbidden.

Wait, let's think differently. Maybe the word has L, A, E plus two other letters, but we can't have S or T.

Another candidate: LEAID (but I is uncommon).

Alternative: LEAID is acceptable, but perhaps a more common word is better.

Looking at common words with L, A, E without S or T:
- LEAID (not common)
- LEAVE (invalid)
- LEAGU (invalid)
- LEARN (invalid)
- LEAPT (invalid)
- LEAVE (invalid)

Alternative approach: maybe the word is LEAVE but A is in 3 which is forbidden. So LEAVE is invalid.

Another candidate: LEAID is the only one I can think of that fits, but it's uncommon.

Wait, let's think of other positions:
- A in 1: AL... something
- A in 2: _A...
- A in 4: _ _ A ...
- A in 5: _ _ _ A (but E can't be in 5, so A in 5 is allowed)

Similarly for E: E in 1,2,3,4.

Let's try:
- ALONE: L in 2 (forbidden)
- ALEED: contains E twice, but L in 2 (forbidden)
- ALEED: same
- ALEED: same
- ALEED: same

Another candidate: LEAID is the only one that seems to fit, but it's uncommon.

Wait, maybe the word is LEAVE but with a different interpretation. No, A is in 3 which is forbidden.

Alternative: LEAID is the only valid word I can think of. But maybe I'm missing something.

Another candidate: LEAID is acceptable, but perhaps the word is LEAVE and the feedback is misinterpreted. No, feedback clearly says A is in word but not in position 3.

Another candidate: LEAID is acceptable, but let's try to find a more common word.

Let me list possible positions:
- L can be in 1,3,4,5
- A can be in 1,2,4,5
- E can be in 1,2,3,4

Possible combinations:
- L in 1, A in 2, E in 3: LAE__ (but E in 3 is allowed, A in 2 allowed, L in 1 allowed)
- LAE__ needs two more letters, not S or T. Common letters: R, N, D, etc.
- LAE__ could be LAEON (but not a word), LAEON is not valid.
- LAEON: no.

Another combination: L in 1, A in 4, E in 2: _E _A L
- LEA _ : LEA__ needs two letters, not S or T. LEARN is invalid (A in 3), LEAF is 4 letters.

Another combination: L in 1, A in 5, E in 2: _E _ _ L A
- E in 2, A in 5, L in 1: E _ _ L A
- Need two letters: E _ _ L A. Common word: E L L A ? No. E L A ? No.

Another combination: L in 3, A in 2, E in 1: E A L _ _
- E A L _ _ needs two letters. E A L _ _ could be E A L E D (E A L E D is not a word), E A L E R (E A L E R is not a word).

Another combination: L in 3, A in 1, E in 2: A E L _ _
- A E L _ _ could be A E L E R (invalid), A E L E D (invalid).

Another combination: L in 4, A in 1, E in 2: A E _ L _
- A E _ L _ could be A E R L E (invalid).

Another combination: L in 4, A in 2, E in 1: E A _ L _
- E A _ L _ could be E A R L Y (E A R L Y is a word). Let's check:
  - E A R L Y: contains E, A, R, L, Y. Does it fit the constraints?
    - L is in position 4 (allowed, since L can't be in 2)
    - A is in position 2 (allowed, since A can't be in 3)
    - E is in position 1 (allowed, since E can't be in 5)
    - No S or T. This seems valid!

So E A R L Y is a valid candidate.

Let me verify:
- Contains L, A, E: yes
- No S or T: yes
- Positions: L in 4 (allowed), A in 2 (allowed), E in 1 (allowed)
- It's a common word.

Therefore, E A R L Y is a good next guess.

Based on the feedback from SLATE, we know:
- L, A, E are in the word but not in positions 2, 3, 5 respectively.
- S and T are not in the word.

A word that satisfies these constraints is ""EARLY"":
- E is in position 1 (allowed)

- LEAVE (invalid)
- LEAGU (invalid)
- LEARN (invalid)
- LEAPT (invalid)
- LEAVE (invalid)

Alternative approach: maybe the word is LEAVE but A is in 3 which is forbidden. So LEAVE is invalid.

Another candidate: LEAID is the only one I can think of that fits, but it's uncommon.

Wait, let's think of other positions:
- A in 1: AL... something
- A in 2: _A...
- A in 4: _ _ A ...
- A in 5: _ _ _ A (but E can't be in 5, so A in 5 is allowed)

Similarly for E: E in 1,2,3,4.

Let's try:
- ALONE: L in 2 (forbidden)
- ALEED: contains E twice, but L in 2 (forbidden)
- ALEED: same
- ALEED: same
- ALEED: same

Another candidate: LEAID is the only one that seems to fit, but it's uncommon.

Wait, maybe the word is LEAVE but with a different interpretation. No, A is in 3 which is forbidden.

Alternative: LEAID is the only valid word I can think of. But maybe I'm missing something.

Another candidate: LEAID is acceptable, but perhaps the word is LEAVE and the feedback is misinterpreted. No, feedback clearly says A is in word but not in position 3.

Another candidate: LEAID is acceptable, but let's try to find a more common word.

Let me list possible positions:
- L can be in 1,3,4,5
- A can be in 1,2,4,5
- E can be in 1,2,3,4

Possible combinations:
- L in 1, A in 2, E in 3: LAE__ (but E in 3 is allowed, A in 2 allowed, L in 1 allowed)
- LAE__ needs two more letters, not S or T. Common letters: R, N, D, etc.
- LAE__ could be LAEON (but not a word), LAEON is not valid.
- LAEON: no.

Another combination: L in 1, A in 4, E in 2: _E _A L
- LEA _ : LEA__ needs two letters, not S or T. LEARN is invalid (A in 3), LEAF is 4 letters.

Another combination: L in 1, A in 5, E in 2: _E _ _ L A
- E in 2, A in 5, L in 1: E _ _ L A
- Need two letters: E _ _ L A. Common word: E L L A ? No. E L A ? No.

Another combination: L in 3, A in 2, E in 1: E A L _ _
- E A L _ _ needs two letters. E A L _ _ could be E A L E D (E A L E D is not a word), E A L E R (E A L E R is not a word).

Another combination: L in 3, A in 1, E in 2: A E L _ _
- A E L _ _ could be A E L E R (invalid), A E L E D (invalid).

Another combination: L in 4, A in 1, E in 2: A E _ L _
- A E _ L _ could be A E R L E (invalid).

Another combination: L in 4, A in 2, E in 1: E A _ L _
- E A _ L _ could be E A R L Y (E A R L Y is a word). Let's check:
  - E A R L Y: contains E, A, R, L, Y. Does it fit the constraints?
    - L is in position 4 (allowed, since L can't be in 2)
    - A is in position 2 (allowed, since A can't be in 3)
    - E is in position 1 (allowed, since E can't be in 5)
    - No S or T. This seems valid!

So E A R L Y is a valid candidate.

Let me verify:
- Contains L, A, E: yes
- No S or T: yes
- Positions: L in 4 (allowed), A in 2 (allowed), E in 1 (allowed)
- It's a common word.

Therefore, E A R L Y is a good next guess.Based on the feedback from SLATE, we know:
- L, A, E are in the word but not in positions 2, 3, 5 respectively.
- S and T are not in the word.

A word that satisfies these constraints is ""EARLY"":
- E is in position 1 (allowed)
- A is in position 2 (allowed)
- R and Y are new letters to test
- L is in position 4 (allowed)

From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(-)
   - Letters not in the word: S, T
   - Letters in the word but misplaced: L, A, E

2. EARLY → E(-) A(-) R(-) L(-) Y(✓)
   - Y is in the correct position (5th letter)
   - E, A, L are still in the word but misplaced
   - R is in the word but misplaced (cannot be in 3rd position)

So far we know:
- Letters that must be in the word: L, A, E, R, Y
- Y is fixed in position 5
- E, A, L, R must appear somewhere in positions 1–4, but not in their previous positions:
  - E cannot be in 1 (from EARLY) and cannot be in 5 (from SLATE) → E must be in 2, 3, or 4
  - A cannot be in 2 (from SLATE) and cannot be in 2 (from EARLY) → A must be in 1, 3, or 4
  - L cannot be in 2 (from SLATE) and cannot be in 4 (from EARLY) → L must be in 1, 3, or 4
  - R cannot be in 3 (from EARLY) → R must be in 1, 2, 4

We need a 5-letter word ending in Y, containing L, A, E, R exactly once each, and no S or T.

Possible permutations of L, A, E, R in positions 1–4 (with the positional restrictions):

Let’s list valid placements:

- E must be in 2, 3, or 4
- A must be in 1, 3, or 4
- L must be in 1, 3, or 4

Hmm, none of these permutations seem to form valid English words. Let me re-examine the constraints.

Actually, we know:

Let me list all valid 5-letter words ending in Y that contain L, A, E, R exactly once each:

1. REALY (invalid)
2. RELAY (valid word)
   - R E L A Y → positions: 1=R, 2=E, 3=L, 4=A, 5=Y
   - Check constraints:
     - Y is in position 5 (correct)
     - L is in position 3 (allowed, since L cannot be in 2 or 4)
     - A is in position 4 (allowed, since A cannot be in 2 or 3)
     - E is in position 2 (allowed, since E cannot be in 1 or 5)

   - This seems to satisfy all constraints!

Therefore, the next logical guess is ""RELAY"".
