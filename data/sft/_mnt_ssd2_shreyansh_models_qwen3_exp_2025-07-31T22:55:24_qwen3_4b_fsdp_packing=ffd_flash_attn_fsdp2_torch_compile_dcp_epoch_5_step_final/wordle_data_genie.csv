For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess should cover as many of these common letters as possible while being a valid English word.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).

So the secret word ends with E, and we know it does NOT contain S, L, A, T.

Next step: pick a word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Uses letters not yet ruled out (S, L, A, T are out).
3. Introduces new common letters to test (R, N, I, O, C, etc.).

A good candidate is ""ROUGE"":

Current known facts:

Letters still available: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the known G and E.

Since G is somewhere in the word but not in position 4, possible positions for G are 1, 2, 3, or 5. But position 5 is already E, so G must be in 1, 2, or 3.

From the new feedback on GIVEN:

- G is now marked ✓ in position 1. So the word starts with G.
- I is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 2). So I must appear somewhere else (positions 3, 4, or 5).
- V is NOT in the word (x).
- E is marked - in position 5, but we already know E is in position 5 from earlier (✓). This seems contradictory. Wait—let me re-read carefully.

Actually, the feedback for GIVEN is:
- G(✓) – position 1 is correct.
- I(-) – I is in the word but not in position 2.
- V(x) – V is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5. But earlier we had E(✓) in position 5 from SLATE. This is impossible. The only way this makes sense is if the feedback is being interpreted per-position, and the E(-) here is a typo or misinterpretation. Re-reading the original feedback:

Original feedback for SLATE: E(✓) – position 5 is E.
Feedback for ROUGE: E(✓) – position 5 is E.
Feedback for GIVEN: E(-) – position 5 is E, but marked -, which contradicts earlier. This must be a misinterpretation. The correct interpretation is that the feedback for GIVEN is:
- G(✓) – position 1 is correct.
- I(-) – I is in the word but not in position 2.
- V(x) – V is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5. But this contradicts earlier feedback. The only resolution is that the E(-) is actually the fifth letter being marked wrong, but we know from SLATE that E is correct in position 5. This suggests the feedback is per-letter, and the fifth letter E is marked -, which is impossible. Therefore, the correct interpretation must be that the feedback for GIVEN is:
- G(✓) – position 1 is correct.
- I(-) – I is in the word but not in position 2.
- V(x) – V is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5. This contradicts earlier feedback, so likely the fifth letter E is actually marked ✓, and the feedback is:
- G(✓) – position 1 is correct.
- I(-) – I is in the word but not in position 2.
- V(x) – V is not in the word.
- E(✓) – position 5 is correct.

Thus, the word starts with G, ends with E, and contains I somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (since position 2 is wrong). Letters ruled out so far: S, L, A, T, R, O, U, V. Remaining letters: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible patterns:
- G _ _ I E  (I in position 4)
- G _ I _ E  (I in position 3)

Let's try ""GIVEN"" again to confirm: G(✓), I(-), V(x), E(-), N(-). This suggests:
- G is correct in position 1.
- I is in the word but not in position 2.
- V is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5. But this contradicts earlier feedback. This indicates the feedback is per-letter, and the fifth letter E is marked -, which is impossible. The only resolution is that the fifth letter E is actually marked ✓, and the feedback is:
- G(✓) – position 1 correct.
- I(-) – I is in the word but not in position 2.
- V(x) – V not in word.
- E(✓) – position 5 correct.

Thus, the word is G _ _ _ E, contains I somewhere in positions 3 or 4.

A good next guess would be ""GIMME"":
- G(✓) – position 1 correct.
- I in position 2 (but feedback says I is not in position 2), so this is invalid.
Next try ""GIMPE"":
- G(✓), I(2) – invalid.
Next try ""GIMIE"":
- G(✓), I(2) – invalid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess should cover as many of these common letters as possible while being a valid English word.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).

So the secret word ends with E, and we know it does NOT contain S, L, A, T.

Next step: pick a word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Uses letters not yet ruled out (S, L, A, T are out).
3. Introduces new common letters to test (R, N, I, O, C, etc.).

A good candidate is ""ROUGE"":
- R, O, U, G are all new letters.
- Ends with E (matches the known position).
- Common letters R, O, U, G are frequent in English words.

Current known facts:
1. The word ends in E (5th letter is E).
2. The letters S, L, A, T, R, O, U are NOT in the word (x).
3. G is in the word but in the wrong position (it appears somewhere other than the 4th spot).

Letters still available: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the known G and E.

Since G is somewhere in the word but not in position 4, possible positions for G are 1, 2, 3, or 5. But position 5 is already E, so G must be in 1, 2, or 3.

We need a word that:
- ends with E
- contains G in position 1, 2, or 3
- does NOT contain any of S, L, A, T, R, O, U

Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, H, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y, Z
Good remaining vowels: I (since A, O, U are out)

Possible patterns:
- G _ _ _ E (G in 1st)
- _ G _ _ E (G in 2nd)
- _ _ G _ E (G in 3rd)

Let's try ""GIVEN"":
- G in 1st position (valid, since G is allowed there)
- I, V, E, N are all new letters
- Ends with E
- Contains no ruled-out letters

Check letters: G, I, V, E, N - none of S, L, A, T, R, O, U are present. This seems valid.

From the feedback so far:

1. The word ends with E (5th letter is E).
2. Letters not in the word: S, L, A, T, R, O, U, V, N.
3. G is in the word and is in the correct position (1st letter).
4. I is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
5. E is in the word but not in the 4th position (though we already know it's in the 5th, so this is redundant).

So the pattern is G _ _ _ E, with the middle three letters chosen from the remaining unused letters: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z.

Constraints:
- I must appear somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4 (since it cannot be in position 2, it must be in 3 or 4).
- We need to test new letters while respecting the constraints.

Possible middle letters: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z.

Let's try a word that places I in the 3rd position and tests new consonants: G I _ _ E.

Candidate: G I B E E (invalid, double E)
Candidate: G I C K E (valid, tests C, K)
Candidate: G I D E E (invalid, double E)
Candidate: G I F F E (invalid, double F)
Candidate: G I M E E (invalid, double E)
Candidate: G I N E E (invalid, N already ruled out)
Candidate: G I P E E (invalid, double E)
Candidate: G I T E E (invalid, T ruled out)
Candidate: G I V E E (invalid, V ruled out)
Candidate: G I X E E (invalid, double E)
Candidate: G I Y E E (invalid, double E)
Candidate: G I Z E E (invalid, double E)

The only valid candidate with I in position 3 is G I C K E.

Another candidate with I in position 4: G _ _ I E.

Candidate: G B I N E (invalid, N ruled out)
Candidate: G C H I E (invalid, 5th letter must be E)
Candidate: G C H I E (invalid, 5th letter must be E)
Candidate: G F I N E (invalid, N ruled out)
Candidate: G H I N E (invalid, N ruled out)
Candidate: G M I N E (invalid, N ruled out)
Candidate: G P I N E (invalid, N ruled out)
Candidate: G W I N E (invalid, N ruled out)

The only valid candidate with I in position 4 is G C H I E (invalid, 5th letter must be E). So the only valid candidate is G I C K E.

Let's check G I C K E:
- G in position 1 (correct)
- I in position 2 (but feedback said I is in word but not in position 2) → conflict.

Oops, I must be in position 3 or 4. Let's try G _ I _ E.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess should cover as many of these common letters as possible while being a valid English word.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).

So the secret word ends with E, and we know it does NOT contain S, L, A, T.

Next step: pick a word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Uses letters not yet ruled out (S, L, A, T are out).
3. Introduces new common letters to test (R, N, I, O, C, etc.).

A good candidate is ""ROUGE"":
- R, O, U, G are all new letters.
- Ends with E (matches the known position).
- Common letters R, O, U, G are frequent in English words.

Guess 2: ROUGE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) O(x) U(x) G(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Current known facts:
1. The word ends in E (5th letter is E).
2. The letters S, L, A, T, R, O, U are NOT in the word (x).
3. G is in the word but in the wrong position (it appears somewhere other than the 4th spot).

Letters still available: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the known G and E.

Since G is somewhere in the word but not in position 4, possible positions for G are 1, 2, 3, or 5. But position 5 is already E, so G must be in 1, 2, or 3.

We need a word that:
- ends with E
- contains G in position 1, 2, or 3
- does NOT contain any of S, L, A, T, R, O, U

Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, H, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y, Z
Good remaining vowels: I (since A, O, U are out)

Possible patterns:
- G _ _ _ E (G in 1st)
- _ G _ _ E (G in 2nd)
- _ _ G _ E (G in 3rd)

Let's try ""GIVEN"":
- G in 1st position (valid, since G is allowed there)
- I, V, E, N are all new letters
- Ends with E
- Contains no ruled-out letters

Check letters: G, I, V, E, N - none of S, L, A, T, R, O, U are present. This seems valid.

A good first guess should cover as many of these common letters as possible while being a valid English word.\n\nOne of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:\n- S (very common starting letter)\n- L (common consonant)\n- A (common vowel)\n- T (common consonant)\n- E (most common vowel)\n\nThis combination gives us a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.\n\n<guess>SLATE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on SLATE:\n- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x).\n- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).\n\nSo the secret word ends with E, and we know it does NOT contain S, L, A, T.\n\nNext step: pick a word that:\n1.

From the feedback so far:

1. E is fixed in the 5th position.
2. G is fixed in the 1st position (G✓).
3. I is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
4. V is not in the word.
5. N is not in the word.
6. Letters ruled out so far: S, L, A, T, R, O, U, V, N.

So the word looks like: G _ _ _ E

Available letters (excluding the ruled-out set): B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z

We also know I must appear somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4.

Possible patterns:
- G I _ _ E
- G _ I _ E
- G _ _ I E

Let's pick a word that uses I in position 2 and common remaining letters. A good candidate is ""GIMME"":
- G (✓) I (must be in word, placed in 2nd) M (new letter) M (new letter) E (✓)
- All letters are allowed, and I is in the word and placed in position 2.

But ""GIMME"" has M twice, which is fine, but let's check if M is allowed. Yes, M hasn't been ruled out.

Another option is ""GIPSY"":
- G (✓) I (in word) P (new) S (but S is ruled out) Y (new) - invalid because S is out.

Next option: ""GIDER"":
- G (✓) I (in word) D (new) E (✓) R (but R is ruled out) - invalid.

Next: ""GIBER"":
- G (✓) I (in word) B (new) E (✓) R (invalid) - invalid.

Next: ""GIDER"" - same as above.

Next: ""GIANT"":
- G (✓) I (in word) A (ruled out) - invalid.

Next: ""GIGAE"":
- G (✓) I (in word) G (new) A (ruled out) - invalid.

Next: ""GIDDE"":
- G (✓) I (in word) D (new) D (new) E (✓) - valid, but ""GIDDE"" is not a common word.

Next: ""GIPPE"":
- G (✓) I (in word) P (new) P (new) E (✓) - valid, but ""GIPPE"" is archaic.

Next: ""GIPSE"":
- G (✓) I (in word) P (new) S (invalid) - invalid.

Next: ""GIRAE"":
- G (✓) I (in word) R (invalid) - invalid.

Next: ""GIMIE"":
- G (✓) I (in word) M (new) I (new) E (✓) - valid, but ""GIMIE"" is not common.

Next: ""GIMME"" seems the best among common words.

Let's verify:
- G (✓) I (must be in word) M (new) M (new) E (✓)
- All letters allowed, and I is placed in position 2.

Therefore, ""GIMME"" is a valid next guess.
