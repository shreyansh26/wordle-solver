For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters to maximize information gain
2. Contains vowels and common consonants
3. Avoids repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll try to include several of these.

A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 vowels and common consonants. ""AROSE"" is a classic opening guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)

This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities for the next guesses.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is in the word but wrong position (so it must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5)
- R is not in the word at all
- O is in the word but wrong position (so it must be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 except 3)
- S is not in the word
- E is not in the word

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: R, S, E
- Letters to include: A, O
- Positions we need to test: positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 for A and O

A good second guess should:
1. Use the known letters A and O
2. Avoid the eliminated letters R, S, E
3. Test new common letters to maximize information
4. Try different positions for A and O

Candidate words:
- ""AUDIO"" - uses A, O, U, I, D (but E is eliminated)
- ""AUDIO"" is valid, but let's see if we can do better
- ""COAST"" - uses C, O, A, S, T - but S is eliminated
- ""FOCAL"" - uses F, O, C, A, L (but O and A are known)
- ""FOCAL"" seems good - tests F, C, L in new positions
- Also tests O in position 2 and A in position 3
- Avoids R, S, E
- Uses common letters F, C, L

Another option is ""AUDIO"" but it has two vowels, which is fine, but ""FOCAL"" tests more consonants.

Let's go with ""FOCAL"" as it tests F, C, L in new positions while keeping A and O in different spots.

The feedback for ""fo cal"" was: ""Model answer is not five letters."" This suggests the system expects a single 5-letter word, not a hyphenated or two-word phrase. I should treat ""fo cal"" as invalid and instead use a proper 5-letter word.

From the first feedback on ""arose"":
- A is in the word but wrong position (positions 2,3,4,5)
- O is in the word but wrong position (positions 1,2,4,5)
- R, S, E are not in the word

From the second feedback (invalid guess):
- We already know the word is 5 letters, so ""fo cal"" is not the word.

Next step: choose a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and O (since they are confirmed in the word)
2. Avoids R, S, E
3. Tests new common consonants
4. Places A and O in new positions

Candidate words:

  - It keeps A and O in new positions (A in 2, O in 3)
  - Introduces U, I, D which are common letters
  - Avoids all eliminated letters

Positions of A and O:
- A was in position 1 in “arose” and still marked “-”, so A cannot be in position 1.

So far:
- A must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters to maximize information gain
2. Contains vowels and common consonants
3. Avoids repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll try to include several of these.

A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 vowels and common consonants. ""AROSE"" is a classic opening guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)

This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities for the next guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is in the word but wrong position (so it must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5)
- R is not in the word at all
- O is in the word but wrong position (so it must be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 except 3)
- S is not in the word
- E is not in the word

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: R, S, E
- Letters to include: A, O
- Positions we need to test: positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 for A and O

A good second guess should:
1. Use the known letters A and O
2. Avoid the eliminated letters R, S, E
3. Test new common letters to maximize information
4. Try different positions for A and O

Candidate words:
- ""AUDIO"" - uses A, O, U, I, D (but E is eliminated)
- ""AUDIO"" is valid, but let's see if we can do better
- ""COAST"" - uses C, O, A, S, T - but S is eliminated
- ""FOCAL"" - uses F, O, C, A, L (but O and A are known)
- ""FOCAL"" seems good - tests F, C, L in new positions
- Also tests O in position 2 and A in position 3
- Avoids R, S, E
- Uses common letters F, C, L

Another option is ""AUDIO"" but it has two vowels, which is fine, but ""FOCAL"" tests more consonants.

Let's go with ""FOCAL"" as it tests F, C, L in new positions while keeping A and O in different spots.

The feedback for ""fo cal"" was: ""Model answer is not five letters."" This suggests the system expects a single 5-letter word, not a hyphenated or two-word phrase. I should treat ""fo cal"" as invalid and instead use a proper 5-letter word.

From the first feedback on ""arose"":
- A is in the word but wrong position (positions 2,3,4,5)
- O is in the word but wrong position (positions 1,2,4,5)
- R, S, E are not in the word

From the second feedback (invalid guess):
- We already know the word is 5 letters, so ""fo cal"" is not the word.

Next step: choose a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and O (since they are confirmed in the word)
2. Avoids R, S, E
3. Tests new common consonants
4. Places A and O in new positions

Candidate words:
- ""AUDIO"" – uses A, O, U, I, D; avoids R,S,E; tests new letters U,I,D
- ""AUDIO"" seems optimal because:
  - It keeps A and O in new positions (A in 2, O in 3)
  - Introduces U, I, D which are common letters
  - Avoids all eliminated letters

Let's go with ""AUDIO"".

From the latest feedback on ""TALON"":

- T is in the word and in the correct first position (✓).
- A is in the word but not in the second position (-).
- L is not in the word (x).
- O is in the word but not in the fourth position (-).
- N is in the word but not in the fifth position (-).

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: T, A, O, N (positions unknown except T is fixed at 1).
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, S, E, U, D, I, L.
- A cannot be in positions 1, 2.
- O cannot be in positions 3, 4.
- N cannot be in position 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with T.
2. Contains A, O, N somewhere in positions 2-5, with the above positional restrictions.
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible positions for A, O, N:
- A: 3, 4, 5
- O: 1, 2 (but 1 is T), so 2
- N: 1, 2, 3, 4 (but 1 is T), so 2, 3, 4

But O must be in position 2 (only remaining slot), and N must be in 2, 3, or 4. However, position 2 is already taken by O, so N must be in 3 or 4. A must be in 3, 4, or 5, but positions 3 and 4 could be taken by N or A.

Let's list possible arrangements:
- T O N A _  (but A would be in 4, N in 3)
- T O A N _  (but N must not be in 5, so this is invalid)
- T O _ N A  (A in 5, N in 4)
- T _ O N A  (but O must be in 2)
- T _ N O A  (but O must be in 2)

The only valid pattern seems to be:
- T O _ _ A  with N in position 3 or 4.

Possible words:
- T O N _ A  (but N must not be in 5, so this is valid)
- T O _ N A  (but A must be in 3,4,5, and N must be in 3,4)

Looking at common 5-letter words starting with T, containing O in position 2, and needing A and N somewhere:
- T O N A _  (but A is in 4, N in 3) → ""TONAL"" but L is eliminated.
- T O _ N A  (N in 4, A in 5) → ""TONIA"" but I is eliminated.
- T O _ _ N  (but N must not be in 5) → invalid.

Wait, let's rethink. The word must start with T, contain A, O, N, and satisfy the positional restrictions.

Possible structure:
T _ _ _ _  (position 1 is T)

We have to place A, O, N in positions 2-5 with:
- O cannot be in 3 or 4 → must be in 2
- A cannot be in 1 or 2 → must be in 3,4,5
- N cannot be in 5 → must be in 2,3,4

Since O must be in 2, we have:
T O _ _ _

Now we need to place A and N in positions 3,4,5 with:
- A must be in 3,4,5
- N must be in 3,4 (cannot be in 5)

Possible combinations:
- T O N A _  (but A in 4, N in 3) → ""TONAL"" (L eliminated)
- T O _ N A  (A in 5, N in 4) → ""TONIA"" (I eliminated)
- T O A N _  (A in 3, N in 4) → ""TOANA"" (invalid word)
- T O _ A N  (A in 4, N in 5) → invalid (N cannot be in 5)

None of these use allowed letters. Let's check if we missed any letters. The remaining common letters not yet ruled out include: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, Y, etc.

We need a word T O _ _ _ with A and N placed correctly. The only valid word seems to be ""TONIA"" but I is eliminated. ""TONAL"" has L eliminated. 

Wait, let's list all possible valid letters for positions 3 and 4, using remaining consonants and avoiding eliminated letters.

Possible letters for positions 3 and 4 (not R,S,E,U,D,I,L):
B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, Y, etc.

We need to place A and N in positions 3,4,5 with:
- A in 3,4,5
- N in 3,4 (not 5)

Possible combinations:
- T O N A _  (A in 4, N in 3) → ""TONAL"" (L eliminated)
- T O _ N A  (A in 5, N in 4) → ""TONIA"" (I eliminated)
- T O A N _  (A in 3, N in 4) → ""TOANA"" (invalid)
- T O _ A N  (A in 4, N in 5) → invalid (N cannot be in 5)

This suggests we might need to reconsider if there's a word I'm missing. Alternatively, perhaps A is in position 5 and N in 3 or 4.

Let me try ""TOGNA"" but G is allowed. However, ""TOGNA"" is not a valid English word.

Another approach: maybe the word has a different structure. Since we know T is in position 1, and we need A, O, N somewhere, with O in position 2 (only possible slot), and A and N needing to fit.

Possible word: ""TONSA"" but S is eliminated.

Wait, let's list all valid 5-letter words starting with T, containing O in position 2, and needing A and N in positions 3-5 with the restrictions.

The only valid word that comes to mind is ""TONIA"" but I is eliminated. ""TONAL"" has L eliminated. 

This seems problematic. Let me double-check the positional constraints:

From ""TALON"" feedback:
- T(✓) at 1
- A(-) at 2 → A not at 2
- O(-) at 4 → O not at 4
- N(-) at 5 → N not at 5

So O must be at 2 (only remaining slot), A must be at 3,4,5, N must be at 2,3,4 (but 2 is O), so N must be at 3 or 4.

Thus:
T O _ _ _

With A and N in positions 3,4,5 but N cannot be at 5, so:
- T O N A _  (A at 4, N at 3) → ""TONAL"" (L eliminated)
- T O _ N A  (A at 5, N at 4) → ""TONIA"" (I eliminated)

No valid words seem to fit. This implies I might have made an error in earlier assumptions. Let me re-examine the feedback.

Wait, the feedback for ""TALON"" was:
T(✓) A(-) L(x) O(-) N(-)

This means:
- T is correct at 1
- A is in the word but not at 2
- O is in the word but not at 4
- N is in the word but not at 5

Thus:
- O can be at 1,2,3 (but 1 is T), so O at 2 or 3
- A can be at 3,4,5
- N can be at 1,2,3,4 (but 1 is T), so N at 2,3,4

This changes the possible positions. Now O can be at 2 or 3.

Let's list possible structures:

Case 1: O at 2
T O _ _ _
Need to place A and N in 3,4,5 with:
- A at 3,4,5
- N at 3,4 (cannot be 5)

Possible words:
- T O N A _  (A at 4, N at 3) → ""TONAL"" (L eliminated)
- T O _ N A  (A at 5, N at 4) → ""TONIA"" (I eliminated)

Case 2: O at 3
T _ O _ _
Need to place A and N in 2,4,5 with:
- A at 2,4,5 (but A cannot be at 2, so A at 4,5)
- N at 2,4 (cannot be at 5)

Possible combinations:
- T N O A _  (A at 4, N at 2) → ""TN OA_"" → ""TN"" is invalid
- T _ O N A  (A at 5, N at 4) → ""T _ O N A"" → ""T"" followed by any letter, O, N, A. The only common word is ""TONGA"" (G allowed). Let's check ""TONGA"":
  - T(✓) at 1
  - O at 3 (allowed)
  - N at 4 (allowed)
  - A at 5 (allowed)
  - G is allowed (not eliminated)
  - ""TONGA"" is a valid word.

This seems to fit all constraints.

Let's verify:
- Contains T, A, O, N
- T at 1 (✓)
- O at 3 (not 4 or 5, so allowed)
- A at 5 (not 1,2, so allowed)
- N at 4 (not 5, so allowed)
- Uses only allowed letters (G is allowed)

Thus, ""TONGA"" is a valid next guess.

<guess>tonga</guess>",tonga,"From the latest feedback on ""TALON"":

- T is in the word and in the correct first position (✓).
- A is in the word but not in the second position (-).
- L is not in the word (x).
- O is in the word but not in the fourth position (-).
- N is in the word but not in the fifth position (-).

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: T, A, O, N (positions unknown except T is fixed at 1).
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, S, E, U, D, I, L.
- A cannot be in positions 1, 2.
- O cannot be in positions 3, 4.
- N cannot be in position 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with T.
2. Contains A, O, N somewhere in positions 2-5, with the above positional restrictions.
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible positions for A, O, N:
- A: 3, 4, 5
- O: 1, 2 (but 1 is T), so 2
- N: 1, 2, 3, 4 (but 1 is T), so 2, 3, 4

But O must be in position 2 (only remaining slot), and N must be in 2, 3, or 4. However, position 2 is already taken by O, so N must be in 3 or 4. A must be in 3, 4, or 5, but positions 3 and 4 could be taken by N or A.

Let's list possible arrangements:
- T O N A _  (but A would be in 4, N in 3)
- T O A N _  (but N must not be in 5, so this is invalid)
- T O _ N A  (A in 5, N in 4)
- T _ O N A  (but O must be in 2)
- T _ N O A  (but O must be in 2)

The only valid pattern seems to be:
- T O _ _ A  with N in position 3 or 4.

Possible words:
- T O N _ A  (but N must not be in 5, so this is valid)
- T O _ N A  (but A must be in 3,4,5, and N must be in 3,4)

Looking at common 5-letter words starting with T, containing O in position 2, and needing A and N somewhere:
- T O N A _  (but A is in 4, N in 3) → ""TONAL"" but L is eliminated.
- T O _ N A  (N in 4, A in 5) → ""TONIA"" but I is eliminated.
- T O _ _ N  (but N must not be in 5) → invalid.

Wait, let's rethink. The word must start with T, contain A, O, N, and satisfy the positional restrictions.

Possible structure:
T _ _ _ _  (position 1 is T)

We have to place A, O, N in positions 2-5 with:
- O cannot be in 3 or 4 → must be in 2
- A cannot be in 1 or 2 → must be in 3,4,5
- N cannot be in 5 → must be in 2,3,4

Since O must be in 2, we have:
T O _ _ _

Now we need to place A and N in positions 3,4,5 with:
- A must be in 3,4,5
- N must be in 3,4 (cannot be in 5)

Possible combinations:
- T O N A _  (but A in 4, N in 3) → ""TONAL"" (L eliminated)
- T O _ N A  (A in 5, N in 4) → ""TONIA"" (I eliminated)
- T O A N _  (A in 3, N in 4) → ""TOANA"" (invalid word)
- T O _ A N  (A in 4, N in 5) → invalid (N cannot be in 5)

None of these use allowed letters. Let's check if we missed any letters. The remaining common letters not yet ruled out include: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, Y, etc.

Thus:

- T O N A _  (A at 4, N at 3) → ""TONAL"" (L eliminated)

No valid words seem to fit. This implies I might have made an error in earlier assumptions. Let me re-examine the feedback.

T _ O _ _
Need to place A and N in 2,4,5 with:

Possible combinations:
