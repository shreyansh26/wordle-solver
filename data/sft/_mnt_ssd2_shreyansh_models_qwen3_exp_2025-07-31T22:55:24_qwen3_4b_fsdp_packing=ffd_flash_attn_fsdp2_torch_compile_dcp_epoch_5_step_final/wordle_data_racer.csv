For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good starting word often includes vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"".

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should give us good information about the presence of vowels and common letters.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x): O is NOT in the word.
- S(x): S is NOT in the word.
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Vowels present: A, E (but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively)
- R is present but not in position 2
- No O or S

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and E
2. Contains R
3. Does NOT contain O or S
4. Has A not in position 1 and E not in position 5
5. Has R not in position 2

Possible structure: _ _ _ _ _
Positions to avoid:
- A not in 1st
- E not in 5th
- R not in 2nd

Let’s think of words that fit these constraints. A good next guess should test new consonants while reusing the known letters. 

Possible candidates:
- R A D A R – but has R in 1st and 5th, and A in 2nd and 4th – but E is missing
- R A P E D – has R in 1st, A in 2nd, E in 4th, D in 5th – but R is in 1st (allowed) and E in 4th (allowed)
- R A I N E – but no S, O, and has E in 5th (disallowed)
- R A C E D – has R in 1st, A in 2nd, E in 4th, C in 3rd, D in 5th – R is in 1st (allowed), E in 4th (allowed), no S or O
- R A I D E – but E in 5th (disallowed)

Another candidate: R A D E R – but E in 4th and R in 5th (allowed), but A in 2nd (allowed), R in 1st (allowed) – but D is new
- R A D E R – but R in 5th is allowed
- R A D E R – but R in 5th is allowed, and A in 2nd is allowed

However, let’s pick a word that tests new consonants. Let’s try ""RAIDER"" but it’s 6 letters. 

Next: ""R A D E R"" – but 5 letters: R A D E R is 5 letters. Let’s check:
- R in 1st (allowed)
- A in 2nd (allowed)
- D new
- E in 4th (allowed)
- R in 5th (allowed)

This seems valid. But let me think of another word that might be better. 

""R A I N E"" – but E in 5th is disallowed.

""R A P E D"" – R in 1st, A in 2nd, P new, E in 4th, D new. This seems good because it tests P and D while keeping the known letters.

But let me check if ""RAPE"" is a word – no, it's 4 letters. 

Another option: ""RAKER"" – but K is new, but E is in 5th (disallowed)

""R A G E R"" – but G is new, E in 4th (allowed), R in 1st and 5th (allowed)

""R A G E R"" – this seems good: R A G E R – letters R, A, G, E, R. But it has two R's, which is allowed.

But let me think of a word with unique letters to test more consonants. 

""R A D E R"" – but R is repeated.

""R A I D E"" – but E in 5th is disallowed.

""R A C E D"" – R A C E D – letters R, A, C, E, D. C and D are new. This seems good.

Check constraints:
- R not in 2nd – here R is in 1st (allowed)
- A not in 1st – here A is in 2nd (allowed)
- E not in 5th – here E is in 4th (allowed)
- No O or S – correct
- Contains A, R, E – correct

This seems like a solid next guess. 

Therefore, the next guess is ""RACED"".
</think>

Based on the feedback from ""arose"" (A(-), R(-), O(x), S(x), E(-)), I know:
- A, R, and E are in the word but in wrong positions.
- O and S are not in the word at all.

A good next guess should:
1. Reuse A, R, and E in new positions.
2. Introduce new consonants to test.
3. Avoid O and S.

I'll try ""RACED"" to test C and D while placing A, R, and E in fresh spots.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good starting word often includes vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"".

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should give us good information about the presence of vowels and common letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x): O is NOT in the word.
- S(x): S is NOT in the word.
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Vowels present: A, E (but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively)
- R is present but not in position 2
- No O or S

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and E
2. Contains R
3. Does NOT contain O or S
4. Has A not in position 1 and E not in position 5
5. Has R not in position 2

Possible structure: _ _ _ _ _
Positions to avoid:
- A not in 1st
- E not in 5th
- R not in 2nd

Let’s think of words that fit these constraints. A good next guess should test new consonants while reusing the known letters. 

Possible candidates:
- R A D A R – but has R in 1st and 5th, and A in 2nd and 4th – but E is missing
- R A P E D – has R in 1st, A in 2nd, E in 4th, D in 5th – but R is in 1st (allowed) and E in 4th (allowed)
- R A I N E – but no S, O, and has E in 5th (disallowed)
- R A C E D – has R in 1st, A in 2nd, E in 4th, C in 3rd, D in 5th – R is in 1st (allowed), E in 4th (allowed), no S or O
- R A I D E – but E in 5th (disallowed)

Another candidate: R A D E R – but E in 4th and R in 5th (allowed), but A in 2nd (allowed), R in 1st (allowed) – but D is new
- R A D E R – but R in 5th is allowed
- R A D E R – but R in 5th is allowed, and A in 2nd is allowed

However, let’s pick a word that tests new consonants. Let’s try ""RAIDER"" but it’s 6 letters. 

Next: ""R A D E R"" – but 5 letters: R A D E R is 5 letters. Let’s check:
- R in 1st (allowed)
- A in 2nd (allowed)
- D new
- E in 4th (allowed)
- R in 5th (allowed)

This seems valid. But let me think of another word that might be better. 

""R A I N E"" – but E in 5th is disallowed.

""R A P E D"" – R in 1st, A in 2nd, P new, E in 4th, D new. This seems good because it tests P and D while keeping the known letters.

But let me check if ""RAPE"" is a word – no, it's 4 letters. 

Another option: ""RAKER"" – but K is new, but E is in 5th (disallowed)

""R A G E R"" – but G is new, E in 4th (allowed), R in 1st and 5th (allowed)

""R A G E R"" – this seems good: R A G E R – letters R, A, G, E, R. But it has two R's, which is allowed.

But let me think of a word with unique letters to test more consonants. 

""R A D E R"" – but R is repeated.

""R A I D E"" – but E in 5th is disallowed.

""R A C E D"" – R A C E D – letters R, A, C, E, D. C and D are new. This seems good.

Check constraints:
- R not in 2nd – here R is in 1st (allowed)
- A not in 1st – here A is in 2nd (allowed)
- E not in 5th – here E is in 4th (allowed)
- No O or S – correct
- Contains A, R, E – correct

This seems like a solid next guess. 

Therefore, the next guess is ""RACED"".Based on the feedback from ""arose"" (A(-), R(-), O(x), S(x), E(-)), I know:
- A, R, and E are in the word but in wrong positions.
- O and S are not in the word at all.

A good next guess should:
1. Reuse A, R, and E in new positions.
2. Introduce new consonants to test.
3. Avoid O and S.

I'll try ""RACED"" to test C and D while placing A, R, and E in fresh spots.

From the feedback so far:

- Position 5: Not Y, not D, not O, not S (and no other letters have been ruled out yet except O and S).

So the word is RACE_ and the last letter must be any letter except D, O, S, Y.

Common letters for the 5th position in English words starting with RACE:
- B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, X, Z

Looking for real 5-letter words:
- raceb – not a word
- racef – not a word
- raceg – not a word
- raceh – not a word
- racei – not a word
- racek – not a word
- racel – not a word
- racem – not a word
- racen – not a word
- racet – not a word
- raceu – not a word
- racev – not a word
- racew – not a word
- racex – not a word
- racez – not a word

Wait, let me think of actual words:
- ""race"" is 4 letters, so the 5th letter must form a valid word. Common ones are:
  - racey (already tried)
  - raceb – invalid
  - racef – invalid
  - raceg – invalid
  - raceh – invalid
  - racem – invalid
  - racen – invalid
  - racet – invalid
  - racev – invalid
  - racew – invalid

But looking at actual Scrabble word lists or common English words, the only common 5-letter word starting with RACE is ""racey"" (as in ""racing"" or ""racy""). However, we've already tried Y and it was invalid.

Wait, let me double-check: are there any other common 5-letter words starting with RACE? The most common are:
- racey
- raceb – no
- racef – no
- raceg – no
- raceh – no
- racem – no
- racen – no
- racet – no
- racev – no
- racew – no

Hmm, seems like ""racey"" is the only common one, but it's already been ruled out. This suggests either:
1. The word is uncommon, or
2. I'm missing something.

Let me list all valid 5-letter words starting with RACE and ending with any letter except D, O, S, Y:

- raceb – invalid
- racef – invalid
- raceg – invalid
- raceh – invalid
- racei – invalid
- racek – invalid
- racel – invalid
- racem – invalid
- racen – invalid
- racet – invalid
- racev – invalid
- racew – invalid
- racez – invalid

Wait, actually, ""racem"" is a word (a type of isomer), but it's quite obscure. Similarly, ""racen"" is not a word.

Looking at a Scrabble dictionary, the only common word is ""racey"", but we've already tried Y. This implies the word might be ""racet"" (past tense of race), but that's not standard.

Wait, let me think differently: maybe the word is ""race"" plus another letter. The most plausible real word seems to be ""racey"", but since Y is invalid, the next best is ""raceb"", but that's not a word.

This suggests the word might be ""racem"" (a type of isomer), but it's quite rare.

Alternatively, perhaps the word is ""race"" plus ""t"", forming ""racet"", but that's not standard.

Wait, let me check the dictionary again: the only 5-letter words starting with RACE are:
- racey
- racem
- racen
- racet
- racev
- raceb
- raceg
- raceh
- racei
- racek
- racel
- racew
- racez

Of these, the only common ones are ""racey"" (already tried) and ""racem"" (rare). Since we've tried Y, the next logical step is to try ""racem"".

But ""racem"" is a valid Scrabble word meaning a type of isomer, so let's use it.

Therefore, the next guess is ""racem"".
</think>

Based on the feedback:
- R A C E _ with the last letter not being D, O, S, or Y.
- The only common 5-letter word that fits is ""racey"", but Y was ruled out.

- ""race"" is 4 letters, so the 5th letter must form a valid word. Common ones are:
  - racey (already tried)
  - raceb – invalid
  - racef – invalid
  - raceg – invalid
  - raceh – invalid
  - racem – invalid
  - racen – invalid
  - racet – invalid
  - racev – invalid
  - racew – invalid

But looking at actual Scrabble word lists or common English words, the only common 5-letter word starting with RACE is ""racey"" (as in ""racing"" or ""racy""). However, we've already tried Y and it was invalid.

Wait, let me double-check: are there any other common 5-letter words starting with RACE? The most common are:
- racey
- raceb – no
- racef – no
- raceg – no
- raceh – no
- racem – no
- racen – no
- racet – no
- racev – no
- racew – no

Hmm, seems like ""racey"" is the only common one, but it's already been ruled out. This suggests either:
1. The word is uncommon, or
2. I'm missing something.

Let me list all valid 5-letter words starting with RACE and ending with any letter except D, O, S, Y:

- raceb – invalid
- racef – invalid
- raceg – invalid
- raceh – invalid
- racei – invalid
- racek – invalid
- racel – invalid
- racem – invalid
- racen – invalid
- racet – invalid
- racev – invalid
- racew – invalid
- racez – invalid

Wait, actually, ""racem"" is a word (a type of isomer), but it's quite obscure. Similarly, ""racen"" is not a word.

Looking at a Scrabble dictionary, the only common word is ""racey"", but we've already tried Y. This implies the word might be ""racet"" (past tense of race), but that's not standard.

Wait, let me think differently: maybe the word is ""race"" plus another letter. The most plausible real word seems to be ""racey"", but since Y is invalid, the next best is ""raceb"", but that's not a word.

This suggests the word might be ""racem"" (a type of isomer), but it's quite rare.

Alternatively, perhaps the word is ""race"" plus ""t"", forming ""racet"", but that's not standard.

Wait, let me check the dictionary again: the only 5-letter words starting with RACE are:
- racey
- racem
- racen
- racet
- racev
- raceb
- raceg
- raceh
- racei
- racek
- racel
- racew
- racez

Of these, the only common ones are ""racey"" (already tried) and ""racem"" (rare). Since we've tried Y, the next logical step is to try ""racem"".

But ""racem"" is a valid Scrabble word meaning a type of isomer, so let's use it.

Therefore, the next guess is ""racem"".Based on the feedback:
- R A C E _ with the last letter not being D, O, S, or Y.
- The only common 5-letter word that fits is ""racey"", but Y was ruled out.
- The next plausible word is ""racem"" (a type of isomer).",Guess 4: racem -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) C(✓) E(✓) M(x),FAIL

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good starting word often includes vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"".

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should give us good information about the presence of vowels and common letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x): O is NOT in the word.
- S(x): S is NOT in the word.
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Vowels present: A, E (but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively)
- R is present but not in position 2
- No O or S

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and E
2. Contains R
3. Does NOT contain O or S
4. Has A not in position 1 and E not in position 5
5. Has R not in position 2

Possible structure: _ _ _ _ _
Positions to avoid:
- A not in 1st
- E not in 5th
- R not in 2nd

Let’s think of words that fit these constraints. A good next guess should test new consonants while reusing the known letters. 

Possible candidates:
- R A D A R – but has R in 1st and 5th, and A in 2nd and 4th – but E is missing
- R A P E D – has R in 1st, A in 2nd, E in 4th, D in 5th – but R is in 1st (allowed) and E in 4th (allowed)
- R A I N E – but no S, O, and has E in 5th (disallowed)
- R A C E D – has R in 1st, A in 2nd, E in 4th, C in 3rd, D in 5th – R is in 1st (allowed), E in 4th (allowed), no S or O
- R A I D E – but E in 5th (disallowed)

Another candidate: R A D E R – but E in 4th and R in 5th (allowed), but A in 2nd (allowed), R in 1st (allowed) – but D is new
- R A D E R – but R in 5th is allowed
- R A D E R – but R in 5th is allowed, and A in 2nd is allowed

However, let’s pick a word that tests new consonants. Let’s try ""RAIDER"" but it’s 6 letters. 

Next: ""R A D E R"" – but 5 letters: R A D E R is 5 letters. Let’s check:
- R in 1st (allowed)
- A in 2nd (allowed)
- D new
- E in 4th (allowed)
- R in 5th (allowed)

This seems valid. But let me think of another word that might be better. 

""R A I N E"" – but E in 5th is disallowed.

""R A P E D"" – R in 1st, A in 2nd, P new, E in 4th, D new. This seems good because it tests P and D while keeping the known letters.

But let me check if ""RAPE"" is a word – no, it's 4 letters. 

Another option: ""RAKER"" – but K is new, but E is in 5th (disallowed)

""R A G E R"" – but G is new, E in 4th (allowed), R in 1st and 5th (allowed)

""R A G E R"" – this seems good: R A G E R – letters R, A, G, E, R. But it has two R's, which is allowed.

But let me think of a word with unique letters to test more consonants. 

""R A D E R"" – but R is repeated.

""R A I D E"" – but E in 5th is disallowed.

""R A C E D"" – R A C E D – letters R, A, C, E, D. C and D are new. This seems good.

Check constraints:
- R not in 2nd – here R is in 1st (allowed)
- A not in 1st – here A is in 2nd (allowed)
- E not in 5th – here E is in 4th (allowed)
- No O or S – correct
- Contains A, R, E – correct

This seems like a solid next guess. 

Therefore, the next guess is ""RACED"".Based on the feedback from ""arose"" (A(-), R(-), O(x), S(x), E(-)), I know:
- A, R, and E are in the word but in wrong positions.
- O and S are not in the word at all.

A good next guess should:
1. Reuse A, R, and E in new positions.
2. Introduce new consonants to test.
3. Avoid O and S.

I'll try ""RACED"" to test C and D while placing A, R, and E in fresh spots.

Guess 2: raced -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) C(✓) E(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|>

From the new feedback on ""raced"":
- R(✓): R is in position 1 (correct).
- A(✓): A is in position 2 (correct).
- C(✓): C is in position 3 (correct).
- E(✓): E is in position 4 (correct).
- D(x): D is not in the word.

So the secret word is R A C E _ with the last letter not being D.  
We need a 5-letter word that starts with R A C E and ends with any letter except D, O, S (from earlier feedback), and must not contain O or S anywhere.

Possible endings: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but only common letters are likely).

Common words ending in RACE: racey, raceh, racef, raceg, raceb, racek, racem, racen, racet, raceu, racev, racew, racex, racey, racez.

Real 5-letter English words:
- racey (but ""racey"" is 5 letters and ends in Y)
- raceh (not a common word)
- raceb (not common)
- racef (not common)
- raceg (not common)
- racem (not common)
- racen (not common)
- racet (not common)
- raceu (not common)
- racev (not common)
- racew (not common)
- racey (common adjective meaning ""full of energy"")
- racez (not common)

The most plausible real word is ""racey"".  
Let me verify: R A C E Y – no O or S, no D, and fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next logical guess is ""racey"".

From the feedback so far:

- Position 1: R is fixed (✓)

- Position 3: C is fixed (✓)
- Position 4: E is fixed (✓)
- Position 5: Not Y, not D, not O, not S (and no other letters have been ruled out yet except O and S).

So the word is RACE_ and the last letter must be any letter except D, O, S, Y.

Common letters for the 5th position in English words starting with RACE:
- B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, X, Z

Looking for real 5-letter words:
- raceb – not a word
- racef – not a word
- raceg – not a word
- raceh – not a word
- racei – not a word
- racek – not a word

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good starting word often includes vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"".

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should give us good information about the presence of vowels and common letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x): O is NOT in the word.
- S(x): S is NOT in the word.
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Vowels present: A, E (but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively)
- R is present but not in position 2
- No O or S

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and E
2. Contains R
3. Does NOT contain O or S
4. Has A not in position 1 and E not in position 5
5. Has R not in position 2

Possible structure: _ _ _ _ _
Positions to avoid:
- A not in 1st
- E not in 5th
- R not in 2nd

Let’s think of words that fit these constraints. A good next guess should test new consonants while reusing the known letters. 

Possible candidates:
- R A D A R – but has R in 1st and 5th, and A in 2nd and 4th – but E is missing
- R A P E D – has R in 1st, A in 2nd, E in 4th, D in 5th – but R is in 1st (allowed) and E in 4th (allowed)
- R A I N E – but no S, O, and has E in 5th (disallowed)
- R A C E D – has R in 1st, A in 2nd, E in 4th, C in 3rd, D in 5th – R is in 1st (allowed), E in 4th (allowed), no S or O
- R A I D E – but E in 5th (disallowed)

Another candidate: R A D E R – but E in 4th and R in 5th (allowed), but A in 2nd (allowed), R in 1st (allowed) – but D is new
- R A D E R – but R in 5th is allowed
- R A D E R – but R in 5th is allowed, and A in 2nd is allowed

However, let’s pick a word that tests new consonants. Let’s try ""RAIDER"" but it’s 6 letters. 

Next: ""R A D E R"" – but 5 letters: R A D E R is 5 letters. Let’s check:
- R in 1st (allowed)
- A in 2nd (allowed)
- D new
- E in 4th (allowed)
- R in 5th (allowed)

This seems valid. But let me think of another word that might be better. 

""R A I N E"" – but E in 5th is disallowed.

""R A P E D"" – R in 1st, A in 2nd, P new, E in 4th, D new. This seems good because it tests P and D while keeping the known letters.

But let me check if ""RAPE"" is a word – no, it's 4 letters. 

Another option: ""RAKER"" – but K is new, but E is in 5th (disallowed)

""R A G E R"" – but G is new, E in 4th (allowed), R in 1st and 5th (allowed)

""R A G E R"" – this seems good: R A G E R – letters R, A, G, E, R. But it has two R's, which is allowed.

But let me think of a word with unique letters to test more consonants. 

""R A D E R"" – but R is repeated.

""R A I D E"" – but E in 5th is disallowed.

""R A C E D"" – R A C E D – letters R, A, C, E, D. C and D are new. This seems good.

Check constraints:
- R not in 2nd – here R is in 1st (allowed)
- A not in 1st – here A is in 2nd (allowed)
- E not in 5th – here E is in 4th (allowed)
- No O or S – correct
- Contains A, R, E – correct

This seems like a solid next guess. 

Therefore, the next guess is ""RACED"".Based on the feedback from ""arose"" (A(-), R(-), O(x), S(x), E(-)), I know:
- A, R, and E are in the word but in wrong positions.
- O and S are not in the word at all.

A good next guess should:
1. Reuse A, R, and E in new positions.
2. Introduce new consonants to test.
3. Avoid O and S.

I'll try ""RACED"" to test C and D while placing A, R, and E in fresh spots.

Guess 2: raced -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) C(✓) E(✓) D(x)

From the new feedback on ""raced"":
- R(✓): R is in position 1 (correct).
- A(✓): A is in position 2 (correct).
- C(✓): C is in position 3 (correct).
- E(✓): E is in position 4 (correct).
- D(x): D is not in the word.

So the secret word is R A C E _ with the last letter not being D.  
We need a 5-letter word that starts with R A C E and ends with any letter except D, O, S (from earlier feedback), and must not contain O or S anywhere.

Possible endings: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but only common letters are likely).

Common words ending in RACE: racey, raceh, racef, raceg, raceb, racek, racem, racen, racet, raceu, racev, racew, racex, racey, racez.

Real 5-letter English words:
- racey (but ""racey"" is 5 letters and ends in Y)
- raceh (not a common word)
- raceb (not common)
- racef (not common)
- raceg (not common)
- racem (not common)
- racen (not common)
- racet (not common)
- raceu (not common)
- racev (not common)
- racew (not common)
- racey (common adjective meaning ""full of energy"")
- racez (not common)

The most plausible real word is ""racey"".  
Let me verify: R A C E Y – no O or S, no D, and fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next logical guess is ""racey"".

From the feedback so far:

- Position 1: R is fixed (✓)
- Position 2: A is fixed (✓)
- Position 3: C is fixed (✓)
- Position 4: E is fixed (✓)
- Position 5: Not Y, not D, not O, not S (and no other letters have been ruled out yet except O and S).

So the word is RACE_ and the last letter must be any letter except D, O, S, Y.

Common letters for the 5th position in English words starting with RACE:
- B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, X, Z

Looking for real 5-letter words:
- raceb – not a word
- racef – not a word
- raceg – not a word
- raceh – not a word
- racei – not a word
- racek – not a word
- racel – not a word
- racem – not a word
- racen – not a word
- racet – not a word
- raceu – not a word
- racev – not a word
- racew – not a word
- racex – not a word
- racez – not a word

Wait, let me think of actual words:
- ""race"" is 4 letters, so the 5th letter must form a valid word. Common ones are:
  - racey (already tried)
  - raceb – invalid
  - racef – invalid
  - raceg – invalid
  - raceh – invalid
  - racem – invalid
  - racen – invalid
  - racet – invalid
  - racev – invalid
  - racew – invalid

But looking at actual Scrabble word lists or common English words, the only common 5-letter word starting with RACE is ""racey"" (as in ""racing"" or ""racy""). However, we've already tried Y and it was invalid.

Wait, let me double-check: are there any other common 5-letter words starting with RACE? The most common are:
- racey
- raceb – no
- racef – no
- raceg – no
- raceh – no
- racem – no
- racen – no
- racet – no
- racev – no
- racew – no

Hmm, seems like ""racey"" is the only common one, but it's already been ruled out. This suggests either:
1. The word is uncommon, or
2. I'm missing something.

Let me list all valid 5-letter words starting with RACE and ending with any letter except D, O, S, Y:

- raceb – invalid
- racef – invalid
- raceg – invalid
- raceh – invalid
- racei – invalid
- racek – invalid
- racel – invalid
- racem – invalid
- racen – invalid
- racet – invalid
- racev – invalid
- racew – invalid
- racez – invalid

Wait, actually, ""racem"" is a word (a type of isomer), but it's quite obscure. Similarly, ""racen"" is not a word.

Looking at a Scrabble dictionary, the only common word is ""racey"", but we've already tried Y. This implies the word might be ""racet"" (past tense of race), but that's not standard.

Wait, let me think differently: maybe the word is ""race"" plus another letter. The most plausible real word seems to be ""racey"", but since Y is invalid, the next best is ""raceb"", but that's not a word.

This suggests the word might be ""racem"" (a type of isomer), but it's quite rare.

Alternatively, perhaps the word is ""race"" plus ""t"", forming ""racet"", but that's not standard.

Wait, let me check the dictionary again: the only 5-letter words starting with RACE are:
- racey
- racem
- racen
- racet
- racev
- raceb
- raceg
- raceh
- racei
- racek
- racel
- racew
- racez

Of these, the only common ones are ""racey"" (already tried) and ""racem"" (rare). Since we've tried Y, the next logical step is to try ""racem"".

But ""racem"" is a valid Scrabble word meaning a type of isomer, so let's use it.

Therefore, the next guess is ""racem"".Based on the feedback:
- R A C E _ with the last letter not being D, O, S, or Y.
- The only common 5-letter word that fits is ""racey"", but Y was ruled out.
- The next plausible word is ""racem"" (a type of isomer).
