### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The letters E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C are among the most common. 

Looking at these, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting several letters in the secret word, especially vowels, which are often present in English words. The letters are all distinct, so I can learn which ones are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) at position 2
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) at position 3
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word has the pattern _ R O _ _
- Letters not in the word: A, S, E
- We need to fill positions 1, 4, and 5 with remaining common letters, avoiding A, S, E.

Good remaining consonants to test: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels to test: I, U (since A and O are already placed, and E is excluded)

Let’s try a word that fills positions 1, 4, 5 with common letters:
- Position 1: T (common starting letter)
- Position 4: I (common vowel)
- Position 5: N (common ending letter)

This gives ""TRION"" – but ""TRION"" is not a valid English word. Let’s adjust:
- Position 1: C
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: N → ""C R O I N"" → ""CROWN"" is valid.

Wait, ""CROWN"" has:
- C (position 1)
- R (position 2 ✓)
- O (position 3 ✓)
- W (position 4)
- N (position 5)

But W is less common, so let’s try another:
- Position 1: T
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: D → ""TRI D"" → ""TRIOD"" is invalid.

Better choice: ""T R O I N"" is invalid, but ""T R O U P"" is invalid (P not tested).

Actually, let’s pick ""T R O I N"" is invalid, but ""T R O U P"" is invalid. Let’s try ""T R O I D"" invalid.

- G R O W N
- M R O W N (invalid)
- P R O W N (invalid)
- T R O U P (invalid)

Valid words left: CROWN, BROWN, GROWN.

CROWN uses C, W, N – all common and not excluded.
BROWN uses B, R, O, W, N – but we already know R and O positions.

Combining both pieces of info:

- W must be at position 1 or 5

Possible placements:
- If W is at position 1: W R O _ _
  - N must be at position 4 → W R O N _

  - Common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, T, U
  - Possible words: WRONG (but G not tested yet), WRONK (invalid), WRONI (invalid), WRONT (invalid), WRONB (invalid)
  - WRONG is valid but G is untested, so let’s check if G is allowed. From feedback, G is not excluded, so WRONG is possible.

- If W is at position 5: _ R O _ W
  - N must be at position 1 or 4
  - If N is at position 1: N R O _ W
    - Need a letter for position 4 (cannot be A, S, E, C)

    - None of these seem valid.

Thus, the only viable option is W R O N _ with a letter for position 5. The most common remaining letter is D, giving WROND (invalid). The next is G, giving WRONG (valid).

Checking WRONG:
- W at position 1: matches W(-) feedback (now in correct position)
- R at position 2: already ✓
- O at position 3: already ✓
- N at position 4: matches N(-) feedback (now in correct position)
- G at position 5: new letter, not excluded

Possible placements:
- If W is at position 1: W R O _ _
  - N must be at position 4 → W R O N _
  - Need a letter for position 5 (cannot be A, S, E, C)
  - Valid letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z
  - Common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, T, U
  - Possible words: WRONG (but G not tested yet), WRONK (invalid), WRONI (invalid), WRONT (invalid), WRONB (invalid)
  - WRONG is valid but G is untested, so let’s check if G is allowed. From feedback, G is not excluded, so WRONG is possible.

- If W is at position 5: _ R O _ W
  - N must be at position 1 or 4
  - If N is at position 1: N R O _ W
    - Need a letter for position 4 (cannot be A, S, E, C)
    - Valid letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z
    - Common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, T, U
    - Possible words: N R O B W (invalid), N R O D W (invalid), N R O G W (invalid), N R O I W (invalid), N R O L W (invalid), N R O M W (invalid), N R O T W (invalid), N R O U W (invalid)
    - None of these seem valid.

  - If N is at position 4: _ R O N W
    - Need a letter for position 1 (cannot be A, S, E, C)
    - Valid letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z
    - Common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, T, U
    - Possible words: B R O N W (invalid), D R O N W (invalid), F R O N W (invalid), G R O N W (invalid), H R O N W (invalid), I R O N W (invalid), L R O N W (invalid), M R O N W (invalid), T R O N W (invalid), U R O N W (invalid)
    - None of these seem valid.

Thus, the only viable option is W R O N _ with a letter for position 5. The most common remaining letter is D, giving WROND (invalid). The next is G, giving WRONG (valid).

Checking WRONG:
- W at position 1: matches W(-) feedback (now in correct position)
- R at position 2: already ✓
- O at position 3: already ✓
- N at position 4: matches N(-) feedback (now in correct position)
- G at position 5: new letter, not excluded

This fits all constraints.",Guess 3: wrong -> FEEDBACK: W(✓) R(✓) O(✓) N(✓) G(✓),SUCCESS
