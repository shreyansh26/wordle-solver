### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me maximum information about the letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. 

Looking at common letters in English: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C are among the most frequent. A word like ""AROSE"" uses five very common letters and can help identify which of these letters are in the word and their positions. 

Another good candidate would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly more balanced in terms of letter distribution. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me maximum information about the letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. 

Looking at common letters in English: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C are among the most frequent. A word like ""AROSE"" uses five very common letters and can help identify which of these letters are in the word and their positions. 

Another good candidate would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly more balanced in terms of letter distribution. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-) – so R must appear somewhere in the word, but not in position 2
- O: not in the word (x)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word but wrong position (-) – so E must appear somewhere in the word, but not in position 5

So the secret word:
- contains R and E (but R is not in position 2, E is not in position 5)
- does not contain A, O, or S

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. has R and E
2. R is not in position 2
3. E is not in position 5
4. does not contain A, O, or S

Good candidate letters to test next: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, etc.

A word that fits these constraints is ""REIGN"":
- R in position 1 (valid, since R is not in position 2)
- E in position 2 (valid, since E is not in position 5)
- I, G, N are new letters to test
- No A, O, S

This should give useful information about positions 1,2,3,4,5 and new letters I, G, N.

   - E is in position 2 (✓)  
   - R is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 2 (from REIGN and AROSE)  
3. Therefore R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

So the pattern so far is: _ E _ _ _  
with R somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5, and no A, O, S, I, G, N.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- has E in position 2  
- has R in position 3, 4, or 5  
- uses only letters not yet ruled out (i.e., not A, O, S, I, G, N)

Candidate letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next guess should test new letters while fitting the known constraints.  
Let’s try a word with R in position 3 and test new letters in positions 1,4,5.  
A common word that fits: “BREED”  
- B: new letter  
- R: position 3 (valid)  
- E: position 2 (correct)  
- E: position 4 (new)  
- D: new letter

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me maximum information about the letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. 

Looking at common letters in English: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C are among the most frequent. A word like ""AROSE"" uses five very common letters and can help identify which of these letters are in the word and their positions. 

Another good candidate would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly more balanced in terms of letter distribution. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- R: in the word but wrong position (-) – so R must appear somewhere in the word, but not in position 2
- O: not in the word (x)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word but wrong position (-) – so E must appear somewhere in the word, but not in position 5

So the secret word:
- contains R and E (but R is not in position 2, E is not in position 5)
- does not contain A, O, or S

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. has R and E
2. R is not in position 2

4. does not contain A, O, or S

Good candidate letters to test next: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, etc.

A word that fits these constraints is ""REIGN"":
- R in position 1 (valid, since R is not in position 2)
- E in position 2 (valid, since E is not in position 5)
- I, G, N are new letters to test
- No A, O, S

This should give useful information about positions 1,2,3,4,5 and new letters I, G, N.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: REIGN -> FEEDBACK: R(-) E(✓) I(x) G(x) N(x)

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word at all: A, O, S, I, G, N  
2. Letters that ARE in the word and their correct positions:  
   - E is in position 2 (✓)  
   - R is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 2 (from REIGN and AROSE)  
3. Therefore R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

So the pattern so far is: _ E _ _ _  
with R somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5, and no A, O, S, I, G, N.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- has E in position 2  
- has R in position 3, 4, or 5  
- uses only letters not yet ruled out (i.e., not A, O, S, I, G, N)

Candidate letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next guess should test new letters while fitting the known constraints.  
Let’s try a word with R in position 3 and test new letters in positions 1,4,5.  
A common word that fits: “BREED”  
- B: new letter  
- R: position 3 (valid)  
- E: position 2 (correct)  
- E: position 4 (new)  
- D: new letter  

This tests B, D, and E in new positions while keeping E fixed in position 2 and R in position 3.

From all feedback so far:

   - R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3 (from AROSE, REIGN, BREED)  
3. Therefore R must be in position 4 or 5.

Current pattern: _ E _ _ _ with R in 4 or 5.

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out): C, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the known E and R.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- has E in position 2  
- has R in position 4 or 5  
- uses only allowed letters

Let’s test R in position 4 first.  
A common word with this pattern: “CLEVR” – but R is in position 5 here.  
Another word: “FLEER” – but R is in position 5.  
A simpler word: “TREND” – but N is ruled out.  
“CREPT” – P and T are allowed, R in position 4.  
“CREPT” fits all constraints:
- C: new letter  
- R: position 4 (valid)  
- E: position 2 (correct)  
- P: new letter  
- T: new letter

This tests C, P, T while keeping E fixed and R in position 4.

Possible candidates:
- FLEER – but E is already in position 2 and R is in 5, and F, L are allowed.  
- HUMER – but U, M, E, R fit and H is allowed.  
- FLEER is a valid word and uses F and L, which haven’t been tested yet.

Let’s choose FLEER.
