### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information I can get from the feedback. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some good starting words include:

- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly good because it contains 5 of the most common letters in English (C, R, A, N, E) and is a valid word. This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

- N – already excluded (this is a mistake; I should avoid N)

Since N is excluded, I’ll try a word without N. Instead, let’s use “SLANT” but replace N with another common letter. A better choice is “STALK”:

2. STALK → S(x) T(-) A(✓) L(-) K(x)

   – L is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ A _ _
- Letters definitely in the word: A, T, L  
- Letters definitely out: C, R, N, E, S, K

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in the 3rd spot.
- Contains both T and L somewhere (but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively).
- Uses only the remaining alphabet (no C, R, N, E, S, K).

Let’s list possible positions for T and L:
- T can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but 3 is A).
- L can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (but 3 is A).

Possible word structures:
- _ T A L _   → but L is in position 4 (forbidden)
- _ T A _ L
- _ _ A T L
- _ _ A L T
- T _ A L _   → L in 4 (forbidden)

- _ T A L _   → L in 4 (forbidden)
- _ _ A T L

The most promising pattern seems _ _ A T L or _ _ A L T.  
Let’s pick a word that fits _ _ A T L: “PLATY” (but Y is uncommon).  
Another: “PLATO” (O is possible).  
A better choice is “PLANT” but N is excluded.  
“PLAID” has I and D, both allowed, and fits _ _ A _ _.  
Wait, let’s try _ _ A T L: “PLATY” is invalid (Y not confirmed).  
“PLATO” is valid.  
“PLAID” fits _ _ A _ _ and uses I, D (both allowed), but doesn’t include T or L.  
We must include T and L.

The pattern _ _ A T L: “PLATY” is invalid.  
“PLATO” is valid: P, L, A, T, O.  
Check positions:

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

From the two guesses we now have:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)  
   – A is locked in the 3rd position: _ _ A _ _

2. STALK → S(x) T(-) A(✓) L(-) K(x)  
   – T is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
   – L is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ A _ _
- Letters definitely in the word: A, T, L  
- Letters definitely out: C, R, N, E, S, K

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in the 3rd spot.
- Contains both T and L somewhere (but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively).
- Uses only the remaining alphabet (no C, R, N, E, S, K).

Let’s list possible positions for T and L:
- T can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but 3 is A).
- L can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (but 3 is A).

Possible word structures:
- _ T A L _   → but L is in position 4 (forbidden)
- _ T A _ L
- _ _ A T L
- _ _ A L T
- T _ A L _   → L in 4 (forbidden)
- T _ A _ L
- T _ A L _   → L in 4 (forbidden)
- _ T A L _   → L in 4 (forbidden)
- _ _ A T L
- _ _ A L T
- T _ A _ L
- _ T A _ L

The most promising pattern seems _ _ A T L or _ _ A L T.  
Let’s pick a word that fits _ _ A T L: “PLATY” (but Y is uncommon).  
Another: “PLATO” (O is possible).  
A better choice is “PLANT” but N is excluded.  
“PLAID” has I and D, both allowed, and fits _ _ A _ _.  
Wait, let’s try _ _ A T L: “PLATY” is invalid (Y not confirmed).  
“PLATO” is valid.  
“PLAID” fits _ _ A _ _ and uses I, D (both allowed), but doesn’t include T or L.  
We must include T and L.

The pattern _ _ A T L: “PLATY” is invalid.  
“PLATO” is valid: P, L, A, T, O.  
Check positions:
- P: new
- L: position 2 (allowed)
- A: position 3 (correct)
- T: position 4 (allowed, since T is in word but not in position 2)
- O: new

This satisfies all constraints.

From all feedback so far:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)  
   – Pattern: _ _ A _ _

2. STALK → S(x) T(-) A(✓) L(-) K(x)  
   – T is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
   – L is in the word but NOT in position 4.

3. PLATO → P(x) L(-) A(✓) T(✓) O(-)  
   – T is in the word and in the correct position 4.  
   – L is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
   – O is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So we now know:
- Pattern: _ _ A T _
- Letters in the word: A, T, L, O  
- Letters definitely out: C, R, N, E, S, K, P

We still need to fill positions 1, 2, and 5 with the remaining letters, ensuring:
- L must appear somewhere (but not in 2 or 4) → L must be in 1 or 5.
- O must appear somewhere (but not in 5) → O must be in 1 or 2.

Let’s list possible placements:

Case 1: L in position 1  
Then O must be in position 2: L O A T _  
We need a letter for position 5 that is not yet used and not in the banned set.  
Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Looking for common letters, Y is possible.  
Word: L O A T Y → “LOATY” (not a valid English word).

Case 2: O in position 1  
Then L must be in position 5: O _ A T L  
We need a letter for position 2 that is not banned.  
Possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Looking for common letters, D is possible.  
Word: O D A T L → “ODATL” (not valid).  
Next: O B A T L → “OBATL” (invalid).  
O I A T L → “OIATL” (invalid).  
O U A T L → “OUATL” (invalid).  
O H A T L → “OHATL” (invalid).  
O G A T L → “OGATL” (invalid).  
O M A T L → “OMATL” (invalid).  
O F A T L → “OFATL” (invalid).  
O J A T L → “OJATL” (invalid).  
O V A T L → “OVATL” (invalid).  
O W A T L → “OWATL” (invalid).  
O Y A T L → “OYATL” (invalid).  
O X A T L → “OXATL” (invalid).  
O Z A T L → “OZATL” (invalid).  

None of these are valid English words.  
Let’s try Case 1 again with other letters for position 5.  
L O A T _ → position 5 must be a valid letter not yet used.  
Possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Looking for valid words:  
- L O A T B → invalid  
- L O A T D → invalid  
- L O A T F → invalid  
- L O A T G → invalid  
- L O A T H → invalid

- L O A T V → invalid  
- L O A T W → invalid  
- L O A T X → invalid  
- L O A T Y → invalid  
- L O A T Z → invalid  

Hmm, no valid words found in these patterns.  
Let’s re-examine the constraints.  
We have letters A, T, L, O must all appear, and the pattern is _ _ A T _.  
So the word must contain A, T, L, O, and one more letter.  
Possible 5-letter words that fit _ _ A T _ and contain L and O:

- L O A T _ → no valid word found.  
- O _ A T L → no valid word found.  
- _ O A T L → need a first letter.  
  Possible first letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
  Looking for common letters:  
  - B O A T L → “BOATL” (invalid)  
  - D O A T L → “DOATL” (invalid)  
  - F O A T L → “FOATL” (invalid)  
  - G O A T L → “GOATL” (invalid)  
  - H O A T L → “HOATL” (invalid)  
  - I O A T L → “IOATL” (invalid)  
  - J O A T L → “JOATL” (invalid)  
  - M O A T L → “MOATL” (invalid)  
  - U O A T L → “UOATL” (invalid)  
  - V O A T L → “VOATL” (invalid)  
  - W O A T L → “WOATL” (invalid)  
  - Y O A T L → “YOATL” (invalid)  
  - Z O A T L → “ZOATL” (invalid)  

This is perplexing.  
Let’s try to list all possible 5-letter English words that fit _ _ A T _ and contain L and O.  
A quick mental scan:  
- “LOATH” – but H is allowed and not banned.  
Check: L O A T H → positions: L(1), O(2), A(3), T(4), H(5).  
- Letters used: L, O, A, T, H.  
- All letters are allowed (not in banned list).  
- Pattern matches _ _ A T _.  

“LOATH” is a valid English word (archaic past of “loathe”).  
This seems to be the only candidate fitting all constraints.
