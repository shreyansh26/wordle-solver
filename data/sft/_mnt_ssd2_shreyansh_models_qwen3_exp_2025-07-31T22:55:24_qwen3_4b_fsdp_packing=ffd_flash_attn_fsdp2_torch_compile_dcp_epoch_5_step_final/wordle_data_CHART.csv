### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. Some popular starting words include:

- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U - good vowel coverage)
- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O - also good vowel coverage)
- ROATE (covers R, O, A, T, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a very common starting word that includes 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 very common consonants (S, T), plus L which is also fairly common. This should give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities for the next guesses.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- L(x) → L is not in the word.
- A(✓) → A is in the word and in position 3.
- T(-) → T is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word has the pattern _ _ A _ _ (A is fixed in position 3).
- Contains T somewhere, but not in position 4.
- Does not contain S, L, or E.

Good next steps:
1. Keep A in position 3.
2. Try to place T in positions 1, 2, or 5.
3. Avoid S, L, E.

Possible candidates:
- T _ A _ _  (T in position 1)
- _ T A _ _  (T in position 2)
- _ _ A T _  (T in position 4 - but feedback says T is not in position 4, so skip)
- _ _ A _ T  (T in position 5)

Let's pick a word that covers new common letters while satisfying these constraints. A good choice is ""CRATE"":
- C and R are common consonants not yet tried.
- A is already confirmed in position 3.
- T is in position 4, but we know T is not in position 4 from the feedback. So CRATE is invalid because T would be in position 4.

Next candidate: ""FRANK""
- F, R, N, K are new letters.
- A is in position 3.
- K is new, but T is missing. We need to include T somewhere.

Let's try ""TRAMP"":

- R, A, M, P are new letters.
- A is in position 3 (matches feedback).
- This satisfies all constraints.

- Letters already ruled out: S, L, E, M, P.
- Remaining common letters to try: C, D, F, G, H, I, K, N, O, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s try to place T in position 5 and R in position 1 (since position 4 is still open for other letters).

Candidate word: R _ A _ T

We need two more letters for positions 2 and 4. Good remaining consonants: C, N, K, D, etc. Let’s pick common ones.
