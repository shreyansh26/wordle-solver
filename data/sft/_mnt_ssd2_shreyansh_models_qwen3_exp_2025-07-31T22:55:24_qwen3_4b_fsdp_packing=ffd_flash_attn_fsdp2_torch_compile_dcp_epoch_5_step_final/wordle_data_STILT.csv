### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should cover a mix of these.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as it contains S, L, A, T, E - covering several common consonants and vowels. This gives us a good chance to identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Another strong option is ""AROSE"" which covers A, R, O, S, E - also covering multiple common letters. However, ""SLATE"" might be slightly more balanced since it includes L which is also common.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess because it covers a good mix of common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

So far we know:

2. Contains L (but not in position 2) and T (but not in position 4).
3. Does NOT contain A or E.

Next guess should:
- Keep the first letter as S.

- Avoid A and E entirely.

Guess 2: STOLE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) O(x) L(✓) E(x)

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. First letter is S (✓ in both guesses).
2. Second letter is T (✓ in STOLE).
3. Fourth letter is L (✓ in STOLE).
4. Letters NOT in the word: A, E, O.
5. Therefore the pattern is S T _ L _ and we still need to determine positions 3 and 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with ST
- Has L in position 4
- Does NOT contain A, E, or O
- Has valid letters for positions 3 and 5

Possible letters left for positions 3 and 5 (excluding A, E, O):
Common consonants: R, N, D, C, H, M, P, etc.
Vowels left: I, U (since A and E are out, O is out too)

So the word looks like: S T _ L _

Possible candidates:
- STIL_ (but we need a 5-letter word ending in L with valid letters)
- STIL_ doesn't fit because we need 5 letters.
- STIL_ is actually STIL_, but we need to check if there's a word STIL_ ending in L.

Wait, let's list possible words:
- STINK (but ends in K, not L)
- STIL_ doesn't work.
- STIL_ is actually STIL_, but we need to check if there's a word STIL_ ending in L.

Looking for words that fit S T _ L _:
- STIL_ doesn't work.
- STIL_ is actually STIL_, but we need to check if there's a word STIL_ ending in L.

Actually, let's think differently. We need S T _ L _ with valid letters. Possible letters for position 3: R, N, D, C, H, M, P, etc.
Possible letters for position 5: R, N, D, C, H, M, P, etc.

Possible words:
- STRIL (but not a valid English word)
- STNLL (invalid)
- STCLL (invalid)
- STHLL (invalid)
- STMLL (invalid)
- STPL_ (invalid)
- STNLL (invalid)

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think of actual words:
- STINT (but ends in T, not L)
- STILT (but ends in T, not L)
- STILL (valid word: S T I L L)

Check STILL:
- S(✓) T(✓) I(-) L(✓) L(✓)
But we already know L is in position 4, so the last L would be position 5. This fits the pattern S T _ L _.

Also, STILL doesn't contain A, E, or O, so it's valid.

Therefore, STILL is a valid next guess.

From the feedback so far:

1. S is fixed in position 1 (✓).
2. T is fixed in position 2 (✓).
3. I is fixed in position 3 (✓).
4. L is fixed in position 4 (✓).
5. The last letter (position 5) is L but in the wrong position (-), so the last letter is NOT L.

So the pattern is: S T I L _

We need a 5-letter word that starts with ""STIL"" and ends with a letter that is NOT L. Also, we know the word does not contain A, E, or O (from earlier feedback).

Possible letters for position 5 (excluding A, E, O, L): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Wait, let's double-check. The word must be S T I L _ and the last letter is not L. The only common word that fits is ""STILT"", but that would have T in position 5, and we already have T in position 2. However, ""STILT"" is a valid word meaning a pole or rod used in stilt-walking. Let me verify:

""STILT"" is indeed a valid English word. It starts with S T I L and ends with T. Since T is allowed in position 5 (we only know it's not in position 4), this fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next logical guess is ""STILT"".
