### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me identify several letters early on. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, T, R, S, L, N, etc. 

One of the most common 5-letter words is ""AROSE"", which contains:
- A (very common starting letter)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common ending letter)

This combination gives me a good chance to hit multiple letters in the secret word on the first try, maximizing the information gained.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in the first position (A(-))
- R is correct in the second position (R(✓))
- O is not in the word (O(x))
- S is not in the word (S(x))
- E is correct in the fifth position (E(✓))

So far we know:
- The word is _ R _ _ E
- The letters A and E are somewhere in the word, but A is not in position 1 and E is not in position 5 (though E is already fixed at position 5, so this is redundant).
- Letters O and S are not in the word.

Next, we need a word that:
1. Has R in position 2 and E in position 5: _ R _ _ E
2. Contains A somewhere (not in position 1)
3. Avoids O and S entirely
4. Uses other common letters to maximize information

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and E are already known)

Possible candidates:
- CRATE: C R A T E → but A is in position 3 (allowed), and we get T and C
- BRIDE: B R I D E → but E is already fixed at 5, so this is invalid (E is already at 5)
- PRIDE: P R I D E → same issue
- TRICE: T R I C E → but C is allowed, and we get T and I
- CRANE: C R A N E → A is in position 3, gives C and N
- GRATE: G R A T E → gives G, A, T

I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it places A in position 3 (allowed), adds C and N, and keeps R and E fixed. This will help us test new letters while respecting the constraints.

From all feedback so far:

1. Pattern: _ R A _ E   (positions 2, 3, 5 are fixed)
2. Letters that are NOT in the word: O, S, C, N, B, V
3. Letters that ARE in the word: R, A, E (already placed)

We still need to determine the first and fourth letters.  
Allowed letters (common ones we haven’t ruled out): T, L, D, M, P, G, H, K, F, W, Y, etc.

We want a word that:
- Fits _ R A _ E
- Uses only allowed letters
- Introduces new common letters to maximize information

Candidate words:
- GRAPE – but P is allowed, but we already have E in position 5 so GRAPE would have E in position 2 (invalid)
- TRAPE – T, R, A, P, E → fits pattern, introduces T and P
- PRATE – P, R, A, T, E → fits pattern, introduces P and T
- GRATE – G, R, A, T, E → fits pattern, introduces G and T
- FRAME – F, R, A, M, E → fits pattern, introduces F and M

""GRATE"" is particularly good because it introduces G and T, two very common letters that haven’t been tested yet.
