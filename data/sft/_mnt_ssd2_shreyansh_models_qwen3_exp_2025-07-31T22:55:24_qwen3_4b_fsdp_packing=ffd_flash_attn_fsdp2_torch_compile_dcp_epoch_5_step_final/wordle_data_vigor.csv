For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these common letters in different positions.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) with no repeated letters. This gives us good coverage of the alphabet early on.

Another strong option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better based on letter frequency analysis. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.

- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains R and O.
- It does NOT contain A, S, or E.
- R is not in position 2, O is not in position 3.

To maximize information, I should pick a word that:
1. Uses R and O in different positions than before.
2. Introduces new common letters that haven’t been tested yet (like T, N, L, C, I, D, etc.).
3. Avoids A, S, E entirely.

A good candidate is “ROUND”:
- Uses R (position 1, which is new) and O (position 2, which is new).
- Uses N, U, D – all untested common letters.
- No A, S, E.

Another option could be “TROOP” or “ROBIN”, but “ROUND” seems more balanced.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these common letters in different positions.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) with no repeated letters. This gives us good coverage of the alphabet early on.

Another strong option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better based on letter frequency analysis. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains R and O.
- It does NOT contain A, S, or E.
- R is not in position 2, O is not in position 3.

To maximize information, I should pick a word that:
1. Uses R and O in different positions than before.
2. Introduces new common letters that haven’t been tested yet (like T, N, L, C, I, D, etc.).
3. Avoids A, S, E entirely.

A good candidate is “ROUND”:
- Uses R (position 1, which is new) and O (position 2, which is new).
- Uses N, U, D – all untested common letters.
- No A, S, E.

Another option could be “TROOP” or “ROBIN”, but “ROUND” seems more balanced.

   – O is not in positions 3 or 2.

So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5, and O must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (but not 3).  
Also, we have not tested letters like T, L, C, I, G, M, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both R and O.
- Places R in position 3, 4, or 5.
- Places O in position 1, 4, or 5 (but not the same position as R).
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

A good candidate is “CORGI”:
- C, I are new letters.
- R is in position 3 (allowed).
- O is in position 1 (allowed).
- No A, S, E, U, N, D.

Another candidate is “TROOP”, but O would be in position 2 (forbidden) and P hasn’t been tested, but O is already in position 2 which is forbidden by the feedback.

Let’s summarize everything we now know after four guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x):  
A, S, E, U, N, D, C, G, I, T, L

Letters that ARE in the word (with positions still unknown):  
R, O

Position restrictions:
- R is NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 → must be in position 5.
- O is NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 → must be in position 5.  
But R and O cannot both be in position 5, so this is impossible unless one of them is in position 5 and the other is in position 4.

Wait, let’s re-examine the feedback carefully:

Guess 4: TROLL → T(x) R(-) O(-) L(x) L(x)

- R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 2 (already known).
- O(-) means O is in the word but not in position 3 (already known).
- T, L are new letters ruled out.

So the only remaining positions for R and O are:
- R must be in position 4 or 5 (since it’s not in 1,2,3).
- O must be in position 4 or 5 (since it’s not in 1,2,3).
- But they cannot both be in the same position, so one must be in 4 and the other in 5.

Thus the word must be _ _ _ R O or _ _ _ O R.

Letters still available (not yet ruled out): B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the letters we haven’t tested yet.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with R O or O R.
- Uses only the allowed letters.
- Does not contain any of the ruled-out letters.

Let’s list possible endings:
- ...RO
- ...OR

Possible words:
- BORON (contains N, ruled out)
- MORYR (invalid)
- PROXY (contains X, Y, P, but not R O)
- VORTEX (contains X, E, T, U, etc., ruled out)
- FROST (contains S, T, ruled out)
- CORGI (already tried)
- MORPH (contains H, P, but not R O)
- PORCH (contains C, H, ruled out)

Looking at remaining letters, a valid word is “PROXY”:
- P, R, O, X, Y
- R is in position 4, O in 5 → matches required positions.
- No forbidden letters.

Another candidate is “BORON” but N is ruled out. “VORTEX” has T, X, E, U, etc. ruled out.

Thus the best valid guess is “PROXY”.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.

- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains R and O.
- It does NOT contain A, S, or E.
- R is not in position 2, O is not in position 3.

To maximize information, I should pick a word that:
1. Uses R and O in different positions than before.
2. Introduces new common letters that haven’t been tested yet (like T, N, L, C, I, D, etc.).
3. Avoids A, S, E entirely.

A good candidate is “ROUND”:
- Uses R (position 1, which is new) and O (position 2, which is new).

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, S, E, U, N, D  
2. Letters that ARE in the word: R, O  
3. Position restrictions:  
   – R is not in positions 2 or 1.  
   – O is not in positions 3 or 2.

So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5, and O must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (but not 3).  
Also, we have not tested letters like T, L, C, I, G, M, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both R and O.
- Places R in position 3, 4, or 5.
- Places O in position 1, 4, or 5 (but not the same position as R).
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

A good candidate is “CORGI”:
- C, I are new letters.
- R is in position 3 (allowed).
- O is in position 1 (allowed).
- No A, S, E, U, N, D.

Another candidate is “TROOP”, but O would be in position 2 (forbidden) and P hasn’t been tested, but O is already in position 2 which is forbidden by the feedback.

“CORGI” seems valid.

From all feedback so far:

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, S, E, U, N, D, C, G, I  
2. Letters that ARE in the word: R, O  
3. Position restrictions:  
   – R is not in positions 1, 2, 3 → must be in 4 or 5.  
   – O is not in positions 1, 2, 3 → must be in 4 or 5.  
   – However, R and O cannot both be in the same position, so one must be in 4 and the other in 5.

Thus the word must end with one of:
- R _ _ _ O  
- O _ _ _ R  

We have not tested the letters T, L, M, P, H, Y, etc.  
A good next word should:
- Place R and O in positions 4 and 5 (in some order).  
- Use only letters not yet ruled out.  

A valid candidate is “TROLL”:
- T, L are new.  
- O in position 4, R in position 5.  
- No forbidden letters.  

Another candidate is “MORPH”:
- M, P, H are new.  
- O in position 2 (forbidden, since O cannot be in 2).  

“TROLL” fits all constraints.

Let’s summarize everything we now know after four guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x):  
A, S, E, U, N, D, C, G, I, T, L

Letters that ARE in the word (with positions still unknown):  
R, O

Position restrictions:
- R is NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 → must be in position 5.
- O is NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 → must be in position 5.  
But R and O cannot both be in position 5, so this is impossible unless one of them is in position 5 and the other is in position 4.

Wait, let’s re-examine the feedback carefully:

Guess 4: TROLL → T(x) R(-) O(-) L(x) L(x)

- R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 2 (already known).
- O(-) means O is in the word but not in position 3 (already known).
- T, L are new letters ruled out.

So the only remaining positions for R and O are:
- R must be in position 4 or 5 (since it’s not in 1,2,3).
- O must be in position 4 or 5 (since it’s not in 1,2,3).
- But they cannot both be in the same position, so one must be in 4 and the other in 5.

Thus the word must be _ _ _ R O or _ _ _ O R.

Letters still available (not yet ruled out): B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the letters we haven’t tested yet.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with R O or O R.
- Uses only the allowed letters.
- Does not contain any of the ruled-out letters.

Let’s list possible endings:
- ...RO
- ...OR

Possible words:
- BORON (contains N, ruled out)
- MORYR (invalid)
- PROXY (contains X, Y, P, but not R O)
- VORTEX (contains X, E, T, U, etc., ruled out)
- FROST (contains S, T, ruled out)
- CORGI (already tried)
- MORPH (contains H, P, but not R O)
- PORCH (contains C, H, ruled out)

Looking at remaining letters, a valid word is “PROXY”:
- P, R, O, X, Y
- R is in position 4, O in 5 → matches required positions.
- No forbidden letters.

Another candidate is “BORON” but N is ruled out. “VORTEX” has T, X, E, U, etc. ruled out.

Thus the best valid guess is “PROXY”.

- R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 2 (already known).
- O(-) means O is in the word but not in position 3 (already known).

Looking at remaining letters, a valid word is “BORON” but N is ruled out. “VORTEX” has T, X, E, U. “FROST” has S, T. “MORYR” is invalid.
