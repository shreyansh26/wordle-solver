For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good starting word should have frequently used vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Common choices include words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""ADIEU,"" or ""AROSE."" 

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of frequent letters and positions, making it an excellent first guess to gather initial feedback.

Good vowels to try: I, O, U (since A is already confirmed and E is ruled out).

A word that fits these constraints is “CRANK”:

From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word:  
S, L, T, E, C, R, N, K, U, D, I, O  

Letters that ARE in the word:  
A (but not in positions 1, 2, 3)

Remaining common consonants: B, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y  
Remaining vowels: none left except A, which is already known

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A (and A must be in position 4 or 5, since positions 1, 2, 3 are ruled out)
- Uses only letters from the still-allowed set (B, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y, plus A)

Possible positions for A: 4 or 5

Let’s list possible words:
- A in position 4: _ _ _ A _
- A in position 5: _ _ _ _ A

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good starting word should have frequently used vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Common choices include words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""ADIEU,"" or ""AROSE."" 

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of frequent letters and positions, making it an excellent first guess to gather initial feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: not in the word (x)
- L: not in the word (x)
- A: in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- T: not in the word (x)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word does NOT contain S, L, T, or E.
- The word DOES contain A, but not in the 3rd position (since A was in position 3 and marked “-”).

Since A is in the word but not in position 3, we should look for a word that:
1. Has A somewhere other than position 3.
2. Does NOT contain S, L, T, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants to try next: R, N, C, D, M, P, etc.  
Good vowels to try: I, O, U (since A is already confirmed and E is ruled out).

A word that fits these constraints is “CRANK”:
- C, R, N, K are all new letters.
- A is in position 2 (not position 3), so it satisfies the “-” feedback.
- No S, L, T, or E.

This should give us more information about the remaining letters.

Guess 2: CRANK -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) K(x)
<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, C, R, N, K  
Letters that ARE in the word: A (but not in positions 2, 3)

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y  
Remaining vowels: I, O, U (A is already confirmed but only known to be elsewhere)

We still need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A (but not in position 2 or 3)
- Uses only letters from the still-allowed set
- Uses common remaining letters to maximize information

Good candidates:
- “MADAM” – but repeats M and A, and A is in positions 2 and 3 (both ruled out)
- “PADIO” – contains A and I, but D and O are still allowed, and A is in position 2 (ruled out)
- “BAHIA” – contains A in position 2 (ruled out)
- “FOAMY” – contains A in position 2 (ruled out)
- “DAMMY” – contains A in position 2 (ruled out)
- “WAGON” – contains A in position 2 (ruled out)
- “GAMMA” – contains A in positions 2 and 3 (both ruled out)
- “HUMID” – contains A in position 2 (ruled out)
- “PUDGY” – contains A in position 2 (ruled out)
- “VIGOR” – contains R (ruled out)
- “VOWEL” – contains E (ruled out)
- “VAPOR” – contains R (ruled out)
- “MAGMA” – contains A in positions 2 and 3 (both ruled out)
- “FAMOUS” – too long
- “MADGE” – contains E (ruled out)

Let’s try a word that puts A in position 1 or 4 or 5, and uses other common remaining letters.

Good options:
- “AMINO” – contains A in position 1, uses M, I, N, O. But N is ruled out.
- “AUDIO” – contains A in position 1, uses U, D, I, O. No ruled-out letters.
- “AUDIO” seems safe: A in position 1 (not ruled out), uses D, U, I, O (all still allowed).

Let’s go with “AUDIO”.

From the feedback so far:

Letters that are NOT in the word (x):  
S, L, T, E, C, R, N, K, U, D, I, O  

Letters that ARE in the word (-):  
A (but not in positions 1, 2, or 3)

So A must be in position 4 or 5.

Remaining common letters (not yet ruled out):  
B, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y, plus the already-known A.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A in position 4 or 5  
- Uses only letters from the allowed set above

Good candidate words:
- “BAMBO” – but O is ruled out  
- “GAMMA” – M and G are allowed, A in position 2 (ruled out)  
- “HAMMY” – M and Y are allowed, A in position 2 (ruled out)  
- “PAMPA” – P and M are allowed, A in position 2 (ruled out)  
- “VAMPS” – S is ruled out  
- “WAMBS” – S is ruled out  
- “VAPID” – I and D are ruled out  
- “GABBY” – B and Y are allowed, A in position 2 (ruled out)  
- “FABBY” – B and Y are allowed, A in position 2 (ruled out)  

Let’s look for words with A in position 4 or 5:

- “FABBY” – A in position 2 (ruled out)  
- “GABBY” – A in position 2 (ruled out)  
- “HABBY” – A in position 2 (ruled out)

- “VAGAB” – A in position 2 (ruled out)  
- “WAGBY” – A in position 2 (ruled out)  
- “YAMBY” – A in position 2 (ruled out)  

We need a word with A in position 4 or 5. Let’s try:

- “BAMBO” – O ruled out  
- “GAMBA” – A in position 5, uses G, M, B – all allowed  
- “HAMBA” – A in position 5, uses H, M, B – all allowed  
- “PAMBA” – A in position 5, uses P, M, B – all allowed  
- “VAMBA” – A in position 5, uses V, M, B – all allowed  

Among these, “GAMBA” is a valid English word and satisfies all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess should be GAMBA.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good starting word should have frequently used vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Common choices include words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""ADIEU,"" or ""AROSE."" 

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of frequent letters and positions, making it an excellent first guess to gather initial feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: not in the word (x)
- L: not in the word (x)
- A: in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- T: not in the word (x)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word does NOT contain S, L, T, or E.
- The word DOES contain A, but not in the 3rd position (since A was in position 3 and marked “-”).

Since A is in the word but not in position 3, we should look for a word that:
1. Has A somewhere other than position 3.
2. Does NOT contain S, L, T, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants to try next: R, N, C, D, M, P, etc.  
Good vowels to try: I, O, U (since A is already confirmed and E is ruled out).

A word that fits these constraints is “CRANK”:
- C, R, N, K are all new letters.
- A is in position 2 (not position 3), so it satisfies the “-” feedback.
- No S, L, T, or E.

This should give us more information about the remaining letters.

Guess 2: CRANK -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) K(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, C, R, N, K  
Letters that ARE in the word: A (but not in positions 2, 3)

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y  
Remaining vowels: I, O, U (A is already confirmed but only known to be elsewhere)

We still need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A (but not in position 2 or 3)
- Uses only letters from the still-allowed set
- Uses common remaining letters to maximize information

Good candidates:
- “MADAM” – but repeats M and A, and A is in positions 2 and 3 (both ruled out)
- “PADIO” – contains A and I, but D and O are still allowed, and A is in position 2 (ruled out)
- “BAHIA” – contains A in position 2 (ruled out)
- “FOAMY” – contains A in position 2 (ruled out)
- “DAMMY” – contains A in position 2 (ruled out)
- “WAGON” – contains A in position 2 (ruled out)
- “GAMMA” – contains A in positions 2 and 3 (both ruled out)
- “HUMID” – contains A in position 2 (ruled out)
- “PUDGY” – contains A in position 2 (ruled out)
- “VIGOR” – contains R (ruled out)
- “VOWEL” – contains E (ruled out)
- “VAPOR” – contains R (ruled out)
- “MAGMA” – contains A in positions 2 and 3 (both ruled out)
- “FAMOUS” – too long
- “MADGE” – contains E (ruled out)

Let’s try a word that puts A in position 1 or 4 or 5, and uses other common remaining letters.

Good options:
- “AMINO” – contains A in position 1, uses M, I, N, O. But N is ruled out.
- “AUDIO” – contains A in position 1, uses U, D, I, O. No ruled-out letters.
- “AUDIO” seems safe: A in position 1 (not ruled out), uses D, U, I, O (all still allowed).

Let’s go with “AUDIO”.

From the feedback so far:

Letters that are NOT in the word (x):  
S, L, T, E, C, R, N, K, U, D, I, O  

Letters that ARE in the word (-):  
A (but not in positions 1, 2, or 3)

So A must be in position 4 or 5.

Remaining common letters (not yet ruled out):  
B, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y, plus the already-known A.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A in position 4 or 5  
- Uses only letters from the allowed set above

Good candidate words:
- “BAMBO” – but O is ruled out  
- “GAMMA” – M and G are allowed, A in position 2 (ruled out)  
- “HAMMY” – M and Y are allowed, A in position 2 (ruled out)  
- “PAMPA” – P and M are allowed, A in position 2 (ruled out)  
- “VAMPS” – S is ruled out  
- “WAMBS” – S is ruled out  
- “VAPID” – I and D are ruled out  
- “GABBY” – B and Y are allowed, A in position 2 (ruled out)  
- “FABBY” – B and Y are allowed, A in position 2 (ruled out)  

Let’s look for words with A in position 4 or 5:

- “BAGGY” – A in position 2 (ruled out)  
- “FABBY” – A in position 2 (ruled out)  
- “GABBY” – A in position 2 (ruled out)  
- “HABBY” – A in position 2 (ruled out)  
- “MAGGY” – A in position 2 (ruled out)  
- “PABBY” – A in position 2 (ruled out)  
- “VAGAB” – A in position 2 (ruled out)  
- “WAGBY” – A in position 2 (ruled out)  
- “YAMBY” – A in position 2 (ruled out)  

We need a word with A in position 4 or 5. Let’s try:

- “BAMBO” – O ruled out  
- “GAMBA” – A in position 5, uses G, M, B – all allowed  
- “HAMBA” – A in position 5, uses H, M, B – all allowed  
- “PAMBA” – A in position 5, uses P, M, B – all allowed  
- “VAMBA” – A in position 5, uses V, M, B – all allowed  

Among these, “GAMBA” is a valid English word and satisfies all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess should be GAMBA.

- B(x) – B is not in the word.  
- A(✓) – A is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).  

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern: _ A M _ A  
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, C, R, N, K, U, D, I, O, G, B  
- Remaining allowed letters: F, H, J, P, V, W, Y, plus any others not yet ruled out.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has the pattern _ A M _ A  
2. Uses only letters from the allowed set (F, H, J, P, V, W, Y, plus A, M already placed).  
3. Is a valid English word.

Possible letters for positions 1 and 4: F, H, J, P, V, W, Y.

Possible combinations:
- F A M _ A → “FAMMA” (not valid)  
- H A M _ A → “HAMMA” (not valid)  
- J A M _ A → “JAMMA” (not valid)  
- P A M _ A → “PAMPA” (but P is allowed, and A is already placed, but P would need to be in position 4 and 5, which is impossible)  
- V A M _ A → “VAMPA” (not valid)  
- W A M _ A → “WAMBA” (not valid)  
- Y A M _ A → “YAMMA” (not valid)  

Wait, we need to check if any of these combinations form valid English words. The only valid word that fits _ A M _ A with allowed letters is “VAMPA” (but it’s not a recognized word), and “WAMBA” is not valid either. Let’s think differently.

Looking back, the pattern is _ A M _ A, and we need valid English words. The only common word that fits is “VAMPA” (but it’s obscure), and “WAMBA” is not valid. However, “VAMPA” is actually a variant spelling of “vampa” (a type of vampire in Italian), but it’s not standard in Scrabble or common dictionaries.

Another approach: check if any letters we’ve missed could fit. The remaining letters are F, H, J, P, V, W, Y. The only valid English word that fits _ A M _ A is “VAMPA” (but it’s obscure), “WAMBA” (not valid), and “YAMMA” (not valid). 

Wait, let’s re-examine the allowed letters. We have not ruled out P, V, W, Y, F, H, J. The word “VAMPA” is not valid, but “VAMPA” is not a word. The only valid word that fits is “VAMPA” (but it’s not valid), so we need to check if we missed something.

Upon closer inspection, the pattern _ A M _ A can be filled by:
- F A M F A – “FAMFA” (invalid)
- H A M H A – “HAMHA” (invalid)
- J A M J A – “JAMJA” (invalid)

- V A M V A – “VAMVA” (invalid)
- W A M W A – “WAMWA” (invalid)

“PAMPA” is a valid English word meaning a grassland plain. It fits the pattern _ A M _ A (P A M P A) and uses only allowed letters (P, A, M, P, A – but P is allowed in position 1 and 4).

Thus, the next logical guess is PAMPA.
