For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and helps eliminate many possibilities early. 

However, I also consider the possibility that the secret word might not contain certain letters. To maximize information gain, I might prefer a word with a mix of vowels and consonants. Another strong option is ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E) or ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E). 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides a good balance of common letters and can quickly reveal vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O, S, E are not in the word (x)

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R somewhere, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively
- Does NOT contain O, S, or E

Next guess should:
1. Use A and R in different positions
2. Avoid O, S, E
3. Introduce new common letters to test

A good candidate is ""TRAIN"":
- Uses T, R, A, I, N
- R is now in position 2 (was 2 before, but feedback shows it's wrong position, so 2 is possible)

To maximize information, we should:
1. Place A and R in new positions
2. Use fresh common consonants that haven't been ruled out
3. Keep the word simple to test more letters quickly

A strong candidate is ""RADAR"":
- Uses R (new position 1) and A (new position 2)

Let's parse the latest feedback:

Guess 3: RADAR  
Feedback: R(-) A(✓) D(x) A(-) R(-)

This tells us:
1. R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 4, or 5.  
   Therefore R must be in position 2 (only remaining spot).
2. A is in the word and is in the correct position (position 3).
3. D is NOT in the word.
4. The two A's in positions 2 and 4 are both marked (-), but since position 3 is already ✓ for A, this means the other A's must be in wrong positions (consistent with the earlier feedback).

So far we know:
- Position 2: R  
- Position 3: A  
- Letters NOT in the word: O, S, E, T, I, N, D  
- Remaining letters to test: common consonants and vowels not yet ruled out (B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)

We need to fill positions 1, 4, and 5 with letters not yet ruled out.  
A good next guess should:
- Keep R in position 2 and A in position 3.  
- Introduce fresh common letters in positions 1, 4, and 5.

Candidate words that fit:
- CRAMP (but M is allowed, P is allowed, but C and M are okay)  
- BRAGS (but G and S are okay, but S is already ruled out)  
- FRANK (but K is allowed, N is ruled out)  
- GRAMP (but P is allowed, M is allowed)  

Best choice seems ""BRAGS"" but S is ruled out.  
Next best: ""CRANK"" but N is ruled out.  
Next: ""FRANK"" but N is ruled out.  
Next: ""GRAMP"" - G, R, A, M, P.  
- G: not yet ruled out  
- M: not yet ruled out  
- P: not yet ruled out  

But position 4 is A in GRAMP, which is already fixed.  
Wait, we need positions 1, 4, 5 to be filled with new letters.

Let me think of a word that has R in position 2, A in position 3, and new letters elsewhere.

Possible: ""CAROL"" - but O is ruled out.  
""CARAT"" - T is ruled out.  
""CARVE"" - E is ruled out.  
""CARPS"" - S is ruled out.  
""CARMA"" - M is allowed, but A is already in position 3.  
""CARAB"" - B is allowed, but A is already in position 3.  

""CARAB"" is invalid because A is already in position 3 and we can't have another A.  

""CARMA"" is invalid for same reason.  

""CARPS"" is invalid.  

""CARVE"" is invalid.  

""CAROL"" is invalid.  

""CARAT"" is invalid.  

""CARAM"" - M is allowed, but A is already in position 3.  

Hmm, let me think differently: positions 1, 4, 5 must be new letters.

We need a 5-letter word with pattern: ? R A ? ? where ? are new letters.

Possible words:
- ""BRAGS"" - but S is ruled out.  
- ""CRANK"" - N is ruled out.  
- ""FRANK"" - N is ruled out.  
- ""GRAMP"" - G, M, P are allowed.  

""GRAMP"" seems valid: G, R, A, M, P.  
But position 4 is M, position 5 is P.  
This seems acceptable.

Another option: ""CRAMP"" - C, R, A, M, P.  
This also fits: C, R, A, M, P.  
C is allowed, M is allowed, P is allowed.

Between ""CRAMP"" and ""GRAMP"", ""CRAMP"" uses C which is common.

Let me check: CRAMP - C, R, A, M, P.  
- C: not ruled out  
- R: position 2 ✓  
- A: position 3 ✓  
- M: not ruled out  
- P: not ruled out  

This seems the best choice.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and helps eliminate many possibilities early. 

However, I also consider the possibility that the secret word might not contain certain letters. To maximize information gain, I might prefer a word with a mix of vowels and consonants. Another strong option is ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E) or ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E). 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides a good balance of common letters and can quickly reveal vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O, S, E are not in the word (x)

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R somewhere, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively
- Does NOT contain O, S, or E

Next guess should:
1. Use A and R in different positions
2. Avoid O, S, E
3. Introduce new common letters to test

A good candidate is ""TRAIN"":
- Uses T, R, A, I, N
- R is now in position 2 (was 2 before, but feedback shows it's wrong position, so 2 is possible)
- A is now in position 3 (was 1 before, so this is a new position)
- Adds T and I which are common letters
- Avoids O, S, E

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters definitely NOT in the word: O, S, E, T, I, N

Letters definitely IN the word but in wrong positions: A (not in 1st or 3rd) and R (not in 2nd or 3rd)

So far we have:
- A must be in position 2, 4, or 5
- R must be in position 1, 4, or 5
- No other letters are confirmed yet

To maximize information, we should:
1. Place A and R in new positions
2. Use fresh common consonants that haven't been ruled out
3. Keep the word simple to test more letters quickly

A strong candidate is ""RADAR"":
- Uses R (new position 1) and A (new position 2)
- Adds D which is common and hasn't been tested
- Repeats A and R to confirm positions quickly

This should help us determine the exact spots for A and R while testing D.

- Position 2: R (from CRAMP feedback: R(-) implies R is in the word but not in position 2, but earlier feedback shows R must be in position 2, so this seems contradictory. Wait, let me re-examine.)

Actually, the feedback for CRAMP is:
C(x) R(-) A(-) M(x) P(-)

This tells us:
- C is NOT in the word.
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2 (since it's marked (-) here).
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (since it's marked (-) here).
- M is NOT in the word.
- P is in the word but NOT in position 5.

But earlier feedback (from RADAR) said:
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3) → A(✓) in position 3.

So the feedback for CRAMP must be interpreted carefully. The A(-) in position 3 contradicts the earlier A(✓) in position 3. This suggests a possible misinterpretation.

Re-examining the feedback for CRAMP:
RADAR: R(-) A(✓) D(x) A(-) R(-)
This means:
- R is in the word but not in position 1, 4, or 5 → must be in position 2.
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- D is not in the word.
- The two A's in positions 2 and 4 are marked (-), but since position 3 is already ✓, this is consistent.

CRAMP: C(x) R(-) A(-) M(x) P(-)
This must mean:
- C is not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (but we know from RADAR it must be in position 2). This is a contradiction, so the feedback must be interpreted differently.

Actually, the feedback symbols are per-letter. For CRAMP:
- C(x) → C is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 3.
- M(x) → M is not in the word.
- P(-) → P is in the word but not in position 5.

But earlier we had from RADAR:
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3). This seems to conflict with CRAMP's A(-).

This suggests the feedback for RADAR might have been mis-read. Let me re-examine:

RADAR: R(-) A(✓) D(x) A(-) R(-)
This is a 5-letter word, so positions are 1-5:
- Position 1: R(-)
- Position 2: A(✓)
- Position 3: D(x)
- Position 4: A(-)
- Position 5: R(-)

This means:
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- R is in the word but not in positions 1, 4, or 5 → must be in position 3.
- D is not in the word.
- The two A's in positions 2 and 4 are marked (-), but since position 2 is ✓, this is consistent.

So the actual pattern is:
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: R
- Other positions unknown.

Letters confirmed NOT in the word: O, S, E, T, I, N, D, C, M.

Letters confirmed IN the word: A (position 2), R (position 3).

We need to fill positions 1, 4, 5 with letters not yet ruled out and not yet used.

Common remaining letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with pattern: ? A R ? ?.

Possible candidates:
- BRAGS - but S is ruled out.
- FRANK - N is ruled out.
- GRASP - S is ruled out.
- GRASP - S is ruled out.
- PRANK - N is ruled out.
- TRAMP - T is ruled out, M is ruled out.
- BRARY - Y is allowed, but R is already in position 3.
- GRAND - N is ruled out.
- BRAGY - Y is allowed, but G and Y are new.
- PRATE - E is ruled out.
- BRARY - valid word.
- GRARY - not a word.
- BRARY seems the best: B, A, R, A, R - but we already have A in position 2 and R in position 3, and positions 1,4,5 would be B, A, R - but this repeats A and R.

Wait, we need to avoid repeating letters that are already confirmed. The word must have A in position 2 and R in position 3, with other letters new.

Looking at possible words:
- BARBY - B, A, R, B, Y - but B is repeated and Y is allowed.
- BRARY - B, R, A, R, Y - but R is in position 3 and 5, which might be possible.
- BRAGY - B, R, A, G, Y - but G and Y are new.
- BRAGY is a valid word.

But let's check letters:
- B: not ruled out.
- R: position 3 ✓.
- A: position 2 ✓.
- G: not ruled out.
- Y: not ruled out.

This seems acceptable.

Another option: BRAGY.

But let me think of a word with distinct letters: BRAGY uses B, R, A, G, Y - all new except A and R which are confirmed.

This seems like a good next guess to test B, G, Y in positions 1,4,5.

From the feedback:
- A is in position 2.
- R is in position 3.
- Letters NOT in the word: O, S, E, T, I, N, D, C, M.
- We need a 5-letter word with pattern: ? A R ? ?.

A good next guess is ""BRAGY"" (B, R, A, G, Y) to test new letters B, G, Y in positions 1,4,5.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and helps eliminate many possibilities early. 

However, I also consider the possibility that the secret word might not contain certain letters. To maximize information gain, I might prefer a word with a mix of vowels and consonants. Another strong option is ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E) or ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E). 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides a good balance of common letters and can quickly reveal vowels and consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O, S, E are not in the word (x)

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R somewhere, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively
- Does NOT contain O, S, or E

Next guess should:
1. Use A and R in different positions
2. Avoid O, S, E
3. Introduce new common letters to test

A good candidate is ""TRAIN"":
- Uses T, R, A, I, N
- R is now in position 2 (was 2 before, but feedback shows it's wrong position, so 2 is possible)
- A is now in position 3 (was 1 before, so this is a new position)
- Adds T and I which are common letters
- Avoids O, S, E

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters definitely NOT in the word: O, S, E, T, I, N

Letters definitely IN the word but in wrong positions: A (not in 1st or 3rd) and R (not in 2nd or 3rd)

So far we have:
- A must be in position 2, 4, or 5
- R must be in position 1, 4, or 5
- No other letters are confirmed yet

To maximize information, we should:
1. Place A and R in new positions
2. Use fresh common consonants that haven't been ruled out
3. Keep the word simple to test more letters quickly

A strong candidate is ""RADAR"":
- Uses R (new position 1) and A (new position 2)
- Adds D which is common and hasn't been tested
- Repeats A and R to confirm positions quickly

This should help us determine the exact spots for A and R while testing D.

<|im_start|>assistant
Let's parse the latest feedback:

Guess 3: RADAR  
Feedback: R(-) A(✓) D(x) A(-) R(-)

This tells us:
1. R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 4, or 5.  
   Therefore R must be in position 2 (only remaining spot).
2. A is in the word and is in the correct position (position 3).
3. D is NOT in the word.
4. The two A's in positions 2 and 4 are both marked (-), but since position 3 is already ✓ for A, this means the other A's must be in wrong positions (consistent with the earlier feedback).

So far we know:
- Position 2: R  
- Position 3: A  
- Letters NOT in the word: O, S, E, T, I, N, D  
- Remaining letters to test: common consonants and vowels not yet ruled out (B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)

We need to fill positions 1, 4, and 5 with letters not yet ruled out.  
A good next guess should:
- Keep R in position 2 and A in position 3.  
- Introduce fresh common letters in positions 1, 4, and 5.

Candidate words that fit:
- CRAMP (but M is allowed, P is allowed, but C and M are okay)  
- BRAGS (but G and S are okay, but S is already ruled out)  
- FRANK (but K is allowed, N is ruled out)  
- GRAMP (but P is allowed, M is allowed)  

Best choice seems ""BRAGS"" but S is ruled out.  
Next best: ""CRANK"" but N is ruled out.  
Next: ""FRANK"" but N is ruled out.  
Next: ""GRAMP"" - G, R, A, M, P.  
- G: not yet ruled out  
- M: not yet ruled out  
- P: not yet ruled out  

But position 4 is A in GRAMP, which is already fixed.  
Wait, we need positions 1, 4, 5 to be filled with new letters.

Let me think of a word that has R in position 2, A in position 3, and new letters elsewhere.

Possible: ""CAROL"" - but O is ruled out.  
""CARAT"" - T is ruled out.  
""CARVE"" - E is ruled out.  
""CARPS"" - S is ruled out.  
""CARMA"" - M is allowed, but A is already in position 3.  
""CARAB"" - B is allowed, but A is already in position 3.  

""CARAB"" is invalid because A is already in position 3 and we can't have another A.  

""CARMA"" is invalid for same reason.  

""CARPS"" is invalid.  

""CARVE"" is invalid.  

""CAROL"" is invalid.  

""CARAT"" is invalid.  

""CARAM"" - M is allowed, but A is already in position 3.  

Hmm, let me think differently: positions 1, 4, 5 must be new letters.

We need a 5-letter word with pattern: ? R A ? ? where ? are new letters.

Possible words:
- ""BRAGS"" - but S is ruled out.  
- ""CRANK"" - N is ruled out.  
- ""FRANK"" - N is ruled out.  
- ""GRAMP"" - G, M, P are allowed.  

""GRAMP"" seems valid: G, R, A, M, P.  
But position 4 is M, position 5 is P.  
This seems acceptable.

Another option: ""CRAMP"" - C, R, A, M, P.  
This also fits: C, R, A, M, P.  
C is allowed, M is allowed, P is allowed.

Between ""CRAMP"" and ""GRAMP"", ""CRAMP"" uses C which is common.

Let me check: CRAMP - C, R, A, M, P.  
- C: not ruled out  
- R: position 2 ✓  
- A: position 3 ✓  
- M: not ruled out  
- P: not ruled out  

This seems the best choice.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E) or ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E). \n\nAfter considering these options, I\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides a good balance of common letters and can quickly reveal vowels and consonants.\n\n<guess>arose</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)\n- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)\n- O, S, E are not in the word (x)\n\nSo the secret word:\n- Contains A and R somewhere, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively\n- Does NOT contain O, S, or E\n\nNext guess should:\n1.

Let's summarize everything we now know.

Confirmed positions:
- Position 2: A (from RADAR feedback: A(✓) in position 2)
- Position 5: Y (from BRAGY feedback: Y(✓) in position 5)

Confirmed letters in the word (positions unknown):
- R (but not in positions 1,2,3,4,5 from earlier feedback - this seems impossible, so re-examine feedback)

Re-examining the feedback carefully:

1. arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A and R are in the word but wrong positions.

2. train → T(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   - R and A again in word but wrong positions.

3. radar → R(-) A(✓) D(x) A(-) R(-)
   - A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
   - R is in the word but not in positions 1,4,5.
   - Therefore R must be in position 3.

4. cramp → C(x) R(-) A(-) M(x) P(-)
   - C, M are out.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2 (confirmed earlier).
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (conflict with earlier A(✓) in position 2 - this suggests the feedback for CRAMP's A(-) must be interpreted differently, likely position 3 A is actually in position 4).

   Re-reading CRAMP feedback:
   - CRAMP: C(x) R(-) A(-) M(x) P(-)
     - Position 1: C(x) - C is out.
     - Position 2: R(-) - R is in word but not here.
     - Position 3: A(-) - A is in word but not here.
     - Position 4: M(x) - M is out.
     - Position 5: P(-) - P is in word but not here.

   So from CRAMP we know:
   - R is in word but not in 2,4,5 (from earlier) → must be in 1 or 3.
   - A is in word but not in 3,4 (from CRAMP) → must be in 1,2,5.
   - P is in word but not in 5.

5. bragy → B(x) R(-) A(-) G(x) Y(✓)
   - B, G are out.
   - R is in word but not in 2 (confirmed).
   - A is in word but not in 3 (confirmed).
   - Y is in word and in position 5.

Combining all:
- Position 2: A (from RADAR A(✓) in position 2)
- Position 5: Y (from BRAGY Y(✓) in position 5)
- R must be in word but not in 2,4,5 → must be in 1 or 3.
- A is in position 2 (confirmed), so A is already placed.
- P is in word but not in 5 → must be in 1,3,4.

Possible patterns:
- R A _ _ Y  (R in 1, A in 2, Y in 5)
- _ A R _ Y  (R in 3, A in 2, Y in 5)

Letters still allowed: from the excluded list we have O,S,E,T,I,N,D,C,M,B,G excluded. Remaining common letters: F, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need to fill positions 3 and 4 (or 1 and 4) with allowed letters, ensuring P is used somewhere.

Option 1: R A _ _ Y
   - Position 3 and 4 must be filled with allowed letters, and P must appear in 3 or 4.
   - Possible: R A P _ Y → R A P _ Y needs a 4th letter. Possible letters: F, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.
   - RAPEY - but E is excluded.
   - RAPLY - L is allowed, Y is in 5, so R A P L Y - valid word.

Option 2: _ A R _ Y
   - Position 1 and 4 must be filled with allowed letters, and P must appear in 1 or 4.
   - If P in 1: P A R _ Y - need 4th letter. Possible: P A R K Y - K is allowed, Y is in 5, so P A R K Y - valid word.

Between RAPLY and PARKY, both are valid, but PARKY uses K which is common. Let's choose PARKY.

Final check:
- P A R K Y
- P: allowed (not excluded), in position 1.
- A: position 2 ✓
- R: position 3 ✓ (must be here as per earlier constraints)
- K: allowed.
- Y: position 5 ✓
