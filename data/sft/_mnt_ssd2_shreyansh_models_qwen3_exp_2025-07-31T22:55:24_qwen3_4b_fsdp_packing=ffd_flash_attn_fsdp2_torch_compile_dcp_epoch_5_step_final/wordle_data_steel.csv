For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A word like ""AROSE"" uses 5 of these high-frequency letters and covers both vowels and common consonants. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a well-balanced first guess that should give good information about multiple letters in the secret word.

- A: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- O: not in the word (x)
- S: in the word but wrong position (-)
- E: in the word but wrong position (-)

So we know:
- The word contains S and E, but NOT in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, or O.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Uses S and E in different positions than before.

A strong candidate is ""UNTIE"":
- Uses U, N, T, I, E.
- E is in position 5 (originally position 5 in AROSE was E, so this is a new position for E).
- S is not in this word, but we know S is in the word somewhere; we just need to test other positions for S later.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O
   - Letters in the word but in wrong positions: S, E

2. UNTIE → U(x) N(x) T(-) I(x) E(-)
   - Letters NOT in the word: U, N, I
   - Letters in the word but in wrong positions: T, E

Combining the information:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, U, N, I
- Letters that ARE in the word: S, E, T
- Positions already ruled out:
  - S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE)
  - E cannot be in positions 5 (from AROSE) or 5 (from UNTIE) → still 5
  - T cannot be in position 3 (from UNTIE)

So the word must contain S, E, T, and must avoid A, R, O, U, N, I.

Remaining vowels: Y (sometimes used as vowel)
Remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

I need a 5-letter word that includes S, E, T and none of the forbidden letters.

Possible structure:
- Must have S, E, T in some order, plus two more letters from allowed set.

Let me try to find a word that fits:
- Must contain S, E, T
- Must avoid A, R, O, U, N, I

Candidate words:
- ""STEEP"" – but has E twice, and P is allowed. However, does it contain T? No, so discard.
- ""STEWS"" – contains S, T, E, W, S. But has S twice, and W is allowed. However, does it contain T? Yes, but we already have S and E. But we need to check if T is in the right place. However, T was in position 3 in UNTIE and marked wrong, so T could be elsewhere. But this word has T in position 2, which was not ruled out. But also, does it contain E in the right place? E was in position 5 in both guesses and marked wrong, so E must be in positions 1-4. In ""STEWS"", E is in position 3, which is allowed. However, this word has S twice, which might not be necessary. Also, W is allowed.

But I need to maximize information. Let me think of a word that uses S, E, T plus two new letters.

Another candidate: ""STEAK"" – but A is forbidden.
""STEAD"" – A is forbidden.
""STEVE"" – E is in position 5, which is forbidden.
""STEIN"" – N is forbidden.
""STEEP"" – E is in position 4, which is allowed (only position 5 was forbidden for E). But P is allowed. However, this has E twice, which might not help much.

Another candidate: ""STENT"" – but N is forbidden.
""STETE"" – has E twice, T twice, which is not helpful.

Let me think of a word with S, E, T plus two new letters that are allowed. For example:

- ""STEWS"" – as above, but has S twice, W is allowed.
- ""STEAK"" – A is forbidden.
- ""STEEP"" – has E twice.
- ""STETE"" – has E twice.
- ""STILE"" – I is forbidden.
- ""STOLE"" – O is forbidden.
- ""STARE"" – A and R are forbidden.
- ""STEVE"" – E is in position 5, forbidden.
- ""STEIN"" – N is forbidden.
- ""STEED"" – D is allowed, but E is in position 4, which is allowed. However, this has E twice.

Let me try ""STEED"":
- Letters: S, T, E, E, D
- Contains S, T, E (twice)
- Avoids forbidden letters (A, R, O, U, N, I)
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since only position 5 was forbidden for E)
- T is in position 2 (allowed, since position 3 was forbidden for T)
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since position 4 was forbidden for S)

This seems like a good candidate because it tests E in position 4 and T in position 2, while introducing D as a new letter. However, it has E twice, which might not be helpful. Let me think of a word with S, E, T plus two distinct new letters.

Another candidate: ""STEIN"" – N is forbidden.
""STEWS"" – W is allowed, but S is repeated.
""STELA"" – A is forbidden.
""STEVE"" – E in position 5 is forbidden.
""STEEP"" – E twice.

Let me try ""STEWS"":
- Letters: S, T, E, W, S
- Contains S, T, E
- Avoids forbidden letters
- S is in positions 1 and 5; position 4 was forbidden for S, so this is allowed
- T is in position 2 (allowed)
- E is in position 3 (allowed)
- W is a new letter

This seems acceptable. However, it has S twice, which might not be optimal. Let me try ""STEED"" instead, even with E twice, because it introduces D.

Alternatively, ""STEED"" introduces D and tests E in position 4.

I think ""STEED"" is a good next guess because it:
- Contains S, T, E
- Tests E in position 4 (allowed)
- Introduces D as a new letter
- Avoids all forbidden letters
</think>

Based on the feedback so far, the word must contain S, E, T and must NOT contain A, R, O, U, N, I. I'm looking for a word that places these letters in new positions while introducing fresh consonants.

A strong candidate is ""STEED"":
- Contains S, T, E (all required letters)
- Tests E in position 4 (new position for E)
- Introduces D as a new letter
- Avoids all forbidden letters

This seems like a good candidate because it tests E in position 4 and T in position 2, while introducing D as a new letter. However, it has E twice, which might not be helpful. Let me think of a word with S, E, T plus two distinct new letters.

Another candidate: ""STEIN"" – N is forbidden.
""STEWS"" – W is allowed, but S is repeated.
""STELA"" – A is forbidden.
""STEVE"" – E in position 5 is forbidden.
""STEEP"" – E twice.

Let me try ""STEWS"":
- Letters: S, T, E, W, S
- Contains S, T, E
- Avoids forbidden letters
- S is in positions 1 and 5; position 4 was forbidden for S, so this is allowed
- T is in position 2 (allowed)
- E is in position 3 (allowed)
- W is a new letter

This seems acceptable. However, it has S twice, which might not be optimal. Let me try ""STEED"" instead, even with E twice, because it introduces D.

Alternatively, ""STEED"" introduces D and tests E in position 4.

I think ""STEED"" is a good next guess because it:
- Contains S, T, E
- Tests E in position 4 (allowed)
- Introduces D as a new letter
- Avoids all forbidden lettersBased on the feedback so far, the word must contain S, E, T and must NOT contain A, R, O, U, N, I. I'm looking for a word that places these letters in new positions while introducing fresh consonants.

A strong candidate is ""STEED"":
- Contains S, T, E (all required letters)
- Tests E in position 4 (new position for E)
- Introduces D as a new letter
- Avoids all forbidden letters",Guess 3: STEED -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) E(✓) E(✓) D(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A word like ""AROSE"" uses 5 of these high-frequency letters and covers both vowels and common consonants. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a well-balanced first guess that should give good information about multiple letters in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- O: not in the word (x)
- S: in the word but wrong position (-)
- E: in the word but wrong position (-)

So we know:
- The word contains S and E, but NOT in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, or O.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Uses S and E in different positions than before.
2. Avoids A, R, O.
3. Introduces new common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.
Good vowels to try next: I, U, Y (since A and O are out).

A strong candidate is ""UNTIE"":
- Uses U, N, T, I, E.
- E is in position 5 (originally position 5 in AROSE was E, so this is a new position for E).
- S is not in this word, but we know S is in the word somewhere; we just need to test other positions for S later.
- Avoids A, R, O.

Another candidate is ""STINK"":
- Uses S in position 1 (was position 4 in AROSE, so new position).
- Uses T, I, N, K.
- Avoids A, R, O.
- E is not in this word, but we know E is in the word; we'll test E in ""UNTIE"" next.

I'll choose ""UNTIE"" because it introduces new letters (U, N, T, I) while testing E in a new position.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(-) I(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O
   - Letters in the word but in wrong positions: S, E

2. UNTIE → U(x) N(x) T(-) I(x) E(-)
   - Letters NOT in the word: U, N, I
   - Letters in the word but in wrong positions: T, E

Combining the information:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, U, N, I
- Letters that ARE in the word: S, E, T
- Positions already ruled out:
  - S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE)
  - E cannot be in positions 5 (from AROSE) or 5 (from UNTIE) → still 5
  - T cannot be in position 3 (from UNTIE)

So the word must contain S, E, T, and must avoid A, R, O, U, N, I.

Remaining vowels: Y (sometimes used as vowel)
Remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

I need a 5-letter word that includes S, E, T and none of the forbidden letters.

Possible structure:
- Must have S, E, T in some order, plus two more letters from allowed set.

Let me try to find a word that fits:
- Must contain S, E, T
- Must avoid A, R, O, U, N, I

Candidate words:
- ""STEEP"" – but has E twice, and P is allowed. However, does it contain T? No, so discard.
- ""STEWS"" – contains S, T, E, W, S. But has S twice, and W is allowed. However, does it contain T? Yes, but we already have S and E. But we need to check if T is in the right place. However, T was in position 3 in UNTIE and marked wrong, so T could be elsewhere. But this word has T in position 2, which was not ruled out. But also, does it contain E in the right place? E was in position 5 in both guesses and marked wrong, so E must be in positions 1-4. In ""STEWS"", E is in position 3, which is allowed. However, this word has S twice, which might not be necessary. Also, W is allowed.

But I need to maximize information. Let me think of a word that uses S, E, T plus two new letters.

Another candidate: ""STEAK"" – but A is forbidden.
""STEAD"" – A is forbidden.
""STEVE"" – E is in position 5, which is forbidden.
""STEIN"" – N is forbidden.
""STEEP"" – E is in position 4, which is allowed (only position 5 was forbidden for E). But P is allowed. However, this has E twice, which might not help much.

Another candidate: ""STENT"" – but N is forbidden.
""STETE"" – has E twice, T twice, which is not helpful.

Let me think of a word with S, E, T plus two new letters that are allowed. For example:

- ""STEWS"" – as above, but has S twice, W is allowed.
- ""STEAK"" – A is forbidden.
- ""STEEP"" – has E twice.
- ""STETE"" – has E twice.
- ""STILE"" – I is forbidden.
- ""STOLE"" – O is forbidden.
- ""STARE"" – A and R are forbidden.
- ""STEVE"" – E is in position 5, forbidden.
- ""STEIN"" – N is forbidden.
- ""STEED"" – D is allowed, but E is in position 4, which is allowed. However, this has E twice.

Let me try ""STEED"":
- Letters: S, T, E, E, D
- Contains S, T, E (twice)
- Avoids forbidden letters (A, R, O, U, N, I)
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since only position 5 was forbidden for E)
- T is in position 2 (allowed, since position 3 was forbidden for T)
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since position 4 was forbidden for S)

This seems like a good candidate because it tests E in position 4 and T in position 2, while introducing D as a new letter. However, it has E twice, which might not be helpful. Let me think of a word with S, E, T plus two distinct new letters.

Another candidate: ""STEIN"" – N is forbidden.
""STEWS"" – W is allowed, but S is repeated.

""STEVE"" – E in position 5 is forbidden.
""STEEP"" – E twice.

Let me try ""STEWS"":
- Letters: S, T, E, W, S

- Avoids forbidden letters
- S is in positions 1 and 5; position 4 was forbidden for S, so this is allowed

This tells us:
- S is in position 1 (correct)

- E is in position 3 (correct)
- E is in position 4 (correct)
- D is not in the word

So the pattern so far is: S T E E _

- Has not been ruled out (A, R, O, U, N, I, D are out)
- Has not been used in position 5 yet (positions 1-4 are fixed)

Remaining allowed letters for position 5 (not yet used and not forbidden): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit STEE_:
- STEEL – uses L, which is allowed
- STEEP – uses P, which is allowed
- STEER – uses R, which is forbidden (R was marked x in Guess 1)
- STEEM – uses M, which is allowed
- STEEK – uses K, which is allowed

Among these, ""STEEL"" and ""STEEP"" are the most common. Between them, ""STEEL"" is more likely given the frequent use of L in English words.

Therefore, the next logical guess is STEEL.
