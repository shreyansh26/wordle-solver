### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, I, O, U, and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

Looking at these considerations, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A, E, O (very common vowels)
- R, S (common consonants)

This gives me a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word, helping me narrow down possibilities efficiently.

- R is not in the word at all (x).
- O is in the word but not in the third position (-).

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.

Let me pick a word that places O in a different position and tests new consonants. A good candidate is ""ADMON"":
- Starts with A.
- O is in position 4.
- Uses D, M, N (all new consonants not yet ruled out).

This should give me information about the placement of O and new consonants.

So L must be in either position 2 or 3.

Possible patterns:

Let's try A L _ O _ first. We need a valid word:
- A L C O _ → ""ALCO_"" – no common word ending.
- A L G O _ → ""ALGO_"" – ""ALGOL"" is a valid word (a star).

Check ""ALGOL"":
- A(✓) L(✓) G(?) O(✓) L(✓) – but L is already in position 2 and 5, which might be possible, but we need to verify if it's valid.

But we need to check if G is allowed. G has not been ruled out, so it's valid.

However, let's see if there's a simpler word. Another candidate is ""AULIC"" but that doesn't fit the pattern.

Wait, let's think of ""ALLOY"":

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, I, O, U, and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

Looking at these considerations, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A, E, O (very common vowels)
- R, S (common consonants)

This gives me a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word, helping me narrow down possibilities efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is in the correct first position (✓).
- R is not in the word at all (x).
- O is in the word but not in the third position (-).
- S is not in the word (x).
- E is not in the word (x).

So the secret word:
- Starts with A.
- Does NOT contain R, S, or E.
- Contains O, but O is not in the third position.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with A.
2. Uses O somewhere other than position 3.
3. Does NOT use R, S, or E.

Possible patterns: A _ _ _ O or A _ O _ _ or A _ _ O _ (but O can't be 3rd, so A _ _ O _ is allowed).

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.

Let me pick a word that places O in a different position and tests new consonants. A good candidate is ""ADMON"":
- Starts with A.
- O is in position 4.
- Uses D, M, N (all new consonants not yet ruled out).

This should give me information about the placement of O and new consonants.

Guess 2: admon -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) D(x) M(x) O(✓) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two pieces of feedback so far:

1. arose → A(✓) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - Word starts with A.
   - Contains O, but not in position 3.
   - Does NOT contain R, S, or E.

2. admon → A(✓) D(x) M(x) O(✓) N(x)
   - Word starts with A.
   - O is in position 4 (✓).
   - Does NOT contain D, M, or N.

So the secret word:
- Starts with A.
- Has O in position 4.
- Does NOT contain R, S, E, D, M, N.

Remaining letters to test: consonants like B, C, F, G, H, K, L, P, T, Y, etc. and vowels I, U (since A and O are already used).

Pattern so far: A _ _ O _

I need a word that:
- Starts with A.
- Has O in position 4.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.
- Tests new consonants.

A good candidate is ""ABOIL"":
- Starts with A.
- O is in position 4.
- Uses B, I, L (none of which have been ruled out).
- Tests B and L, and places I in position 3 (which is new information).

Let me check if ""ABOIL"" is a valid 5-letter English word. Yes, it is.

Let's consolidate what we now know.

1. Pattern so far: A L _ O _
2. Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E, D, M, N, B, I, G
3. Letters known to be in the word: A, L, O (positions 1, 2, 4 are fixed; O is already confirmed at 4)
4. From algol feedback:
   - G is not in the word (x)
   - Second L is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

Therefore the word must be A L _ O _ and must contain another L somewhere in positions 3 or 5. However, position 5 cannot be L because algol showed L(-) there. So the only remaining possibility is that the word is A L L O _.

Now we need a 5-letter word that is A L L O _ and uses only letters not yet ruled out. The only letter left to test in position 5 is among the still-allowed consonants: C, F, H, J, K, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common English words: ""ALLOY"" is the only standard word that fits A L L O Y.

Check constraints:
- A(✓) L(✓) L(?) O(✓) Y(?)
- Letters used: A, L, O, Y – all allowed.
- Positions: 1=A, 2=L, 3=L, 4=O, 5=Y – fits the pattern.

""ALLOY"" is a valid 5-letter word and satisfies all constraints.
