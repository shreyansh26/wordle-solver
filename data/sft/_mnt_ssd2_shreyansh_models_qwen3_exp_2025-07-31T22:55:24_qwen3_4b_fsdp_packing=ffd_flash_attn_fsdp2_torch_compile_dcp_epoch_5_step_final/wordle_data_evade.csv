For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly eliminate or confirm several letters at once. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these common letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at these letters, I can try a word like ""AROSE"" which contains 5 very common letters. This should give me good feedback on several letters and their positions. Alternatively, ""STARE"" or ""RAISE"" are also good options. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers a good spread of common letters.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it’s not in slot 1).
- R, O, S are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word and in the correct position (slot 5).

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains an A, but not in the first position.
3. It does NOT contain R, O, or S.

Next, I want a word that:
- Ends with E.
- Has an A somewhere other than the first position.
- Avoids R, O, S.

Good letters to try next: T, N, L, I, C, U, D, etc.

Possible candidates:
- T A B L E → but A is in position 2, E is in position 5. Uses T, B, L which haven’t been tested yet.
- L A D E → but this is 4 letters.
- C A N E → C, A, N, E. A is in position 2, E is in position 4. But we know E must be in position 5.
- L A T E → A in position 2, E in position 4. Still E not in position 5.
- C A P E → A in position 2, E in position 4.
- L A C E → A in position 2, E in position 4.
- C A N E → same issue.

Actually, I need E in position 5. So possible endings: ...E.

Looking for words ending with E, containing A (not in position 1), and avoiding R, O, S.

Examples:
- A L E → too short.
- T A L E → A in position 2, E in position 4. Doesn’t end with E.
- L A T E → same issue.
- C A T E → same issue.

Wait, I need to end with E. So:
- A T E → too short.
- C A T E → ends with E, A in position 2. This is 4 letters.
- L A T E → 4 letters.
- T A L E → 4 letters.

I need a 5-letter word. Let me think:

- T A B L E → 5 letters, ends with E, A in position 2. This is valid.
- C A N E → 4 letters.
- L A C E → 4 letters.
- C A P E → 4 letters.
- L A D E → 4 letters.

Actually, ""TABLE"" is 5 letters ending with E, has A in position 2, and avoids R, O, S. This seems good.

Another option: ""PAINT"" but ends with T, not E.
""CABIN"" ends with N.
""LARGE"" ends with E, but has R (forbidden).
""PLATE"" ends with E, has A in position 2, avoids R, O, S. This is also good.

Between ""TABLE"" and ""PLATE"":
- ""PLATE"": P, L, A, T, E. A in position 3, E in position 5. Avoids R, O, S.
- ""TABLE"": T, A, B, L, E. A in position 2, E in position 5.

Both are valid. I'll choose ""PLATE"" as it uses P and L which haven't been tested yet.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly eliminate or confirm several letters at once. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these common letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at these letters, I can try a word like ""AROSE"" which contains 5 very common letters. This should give me good feedback on several letters and their positions. Alternatively, ""STARE"" or ""RAISE"" are also good options. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers a good spread of common letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it’s not in slot 1).
- R, O, S are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word and in the correct position (slot 5).

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains an A, but not in the first position.
3. It does NOT contain R, O, or S.

Next, I want a word that:
- Ends with E.
- Has an A somewhere other than the first position.
- Avoids R, O, S.

Good letters to try next: T, N, L, I, C, U, D, etc.

Possible candidates:
- T A B L E → but A is in position 2, E is in position 5. Uses T, B, L which haven’t been tested yet.
- L A D E → but this is 4 letters.
- C A N E → C, A, N, E. A is in position 2, E is in position 4. But we know E must be in position 5.
- L A T E → A in position 2, E in position 4. Still E not in position 5.
- C A P E → A in position 2, E in position 4.
- L A C E → A in position 2, E in position 4.
- C A N E → same issue.

Actually, I need E in position 5. So possible endings: ...E.

Looking for words ending with E, containing A (not in position 1), and avoiding R, O, S.

Examples:
- A L E → too short.
- T A L E → A in position 2, E in position 4. Doesn’t end with E.
- L A T E → same issue.
- C A T E → same issue.

Wait, I need to end with E. So:
- A T E → too short.
- C A T E → ends with E, A in position 2. This is 4 letters.
- L A T E → 4 letters.
- T A L E → 4 letters.

I need a 5-letter word. Let me think:

- T A B L E → 5 letters, ends with E, A in position 2. This is valid.
- C A N E → 4 letters.
- L A C E → 4 letters.
- C A P E → 4 letters.
- L A D E → 4 letters.

Actually, ""TABLE"" is 5 letters ending with E, has A in position 2, and avoids R, O, S. This seems good.

Another option: ""PAINT"" but ends with T, not E.
""CABIN"" ends with N.
""LARGE"" ends with E, but has R (forbidden).
""PLATE"" ends with E, has A in position 2, avoids R, O, S. This is also good.

Between ""TABLE"" and ""PLATE"":
- ""PLATE"": P, L, A, T, E. A in position 3, E in position 5. Avoids R, O, S.
- ""TABLE"": T, A, B, L, E. A in position 2, E in position 5.

Both are valid. I'll choose ""PLATE"" as it uses P and L which haven't been tested yet.

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is locked in the 5th position.
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S are not in the word.

   - A is now confirmed in position 3.
   - P, L, T are not in the word.
   - E is confirmed in position 5.

So the pattern so far is: _ _ A _ E  
Letters still allowed: any except R, O, S, P, L, T.

We need a 5-letter word fitting _ _ A _ E that uses only the remaining letters.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
But we should prioritize common letters.

Good candidates:
- BANKE (but K and E are allowed, but E is already fixed)
- CHAFE (C, H, A, F, E) – A in position 3, E in 5.
- MANDE (M, A, N, D, E) – but D is allowed.
- GANDE (G, A, N, D, E)
- CANDY (but Y is allowed)
- BANDE (B, A, N, D, E)

""CHAFE"" uses C, H, A, F, E – all allowed and common.

Check:
- C: not yet ruled out
- H: not yet ruled out
- A: confirmed in position 3
- F: not yet ruled out
- E: confirmed in position 5

This seems optimal.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly eliminate or confirm several letters at once. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these common letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at these letters, I can try a word like ""AROSE"" which contains 5 very common letters. This should give me good feedback on several letters and their positions. Alternatively, ""STARE"" or ""RAISE"" are also good options. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers a good spread of common letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it’s not in slot 1).
- R, O, S are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word and in the correct position (slot 5).

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains an A, but not in the first position.
3. It does NOT contain R, O, or S.

Next, I want a word that:
- Ends with E.
- Has an A somewhere other than the first position.
- Avoids R, O, S.

Good letters to try next: T, N, L, I, C, U, D, etc.

Possible candidates:
- T A B L E → but A is in position 2, E is in position 5. Uses T, B, L which haven’t been tested yet.
- L A D E → but this is 4 letters.
- C A N E → C, A, N, E. A is in position 2, E is in position 4. But we know E must be in position 5.
- L A T E → A in position 2, E in position 4. Still E not in position 5.
- C A P E → A in position 2, E in position 4.
- L A C E → A in position 2, E in position 4.
- C A N E → same issue.

Actually, I need E in position 5. So possible endings: ...E.

Looking for words ending with E, containing A (not in position 1), and avoiding R, O, S.

Examples:
- A L E → too short.
- T A L E → A in position 2, E in position 4. Doesn’t end with E.
- L A T E → same issue.
- C A T E → same issue.

Wait, I need to end with E. So:
- A T E → too short.
- C A T E → ends with E, A in position 2. This is 4 letters.
- L A T E → 4 letters.
- T A L E → 4 letters.

I need a 5-letter word. Let me think:

- T A B L E → 5 letters, ends with E, A in position 2. This is valid.
- C A N E → 4 letters.
- L A C E → 4 letters.
- C A P E → 4 letters.
- L A D E → 4 letters.

Actually, ""TABLE"" is 5 letters ending with E, has A in position 2, and avoids R, O, S. This seems good.

Another option: ""PAINT"" but ends with T, not E.
""CABIN"" ends with N.
""LARGE"" ends with E, but has R (forbidden).
""PLATE"" ends with E, has A in position 2, avoids R, O, S. This is also good.

Between ""TABLE"" and ""PLATE"":
- ""PLATE"": P, L, A, T, E. A in position 3, E in position 5. Avoids R, O, S.
- ""TABLE"": T, A, B, L, E. A in position 2, E in position 5.

Both are valid. I'll choose ""PLATE"" as it uses P and L which haven't been tested yet.

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is locked in the 5th position.
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S are not in the word.

2. PLATE → P(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
   - A is now confirmed in position 3.
   - P, L, T are not in the word.
   - E is confirmed in position 5.

So the pattern so far is: _ _ A _ E  
Letters still allowed: any except R, O, S, P, L, T.

We need a 5-letter word fitting _ _ A _ E that uses only the remaining letters.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
But we should prioritize common letters.

Good candidates:
- BANKE (but K and E are allowed, but E is already fixed)
- CHAFE (C, H, A, F, E) – A in position 3, E in 5.
- MANDE (M, A, N, D, E) – but D is allowed.
- GANDE (G, A, N, D, E)
- CANDY (but Y is allowed)
- BANDE (B, A, N, D, E)

""CHAFE"" uses C, H, A, F, E – all allowed and common.

Check:
- C: not yet ruled out
- H: not yet ruled out
- A: confirmed in position 3
- F: not yet ruled out
- E: confirmed in position 5

This seems optimal.

- Position 1: B, G, I, K, U, W
- Position 3: B, G, I, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Possible candidates:
- B A D D E – but D is already in position 4, so double D is unlikely.
- G A I D E – G, A, I, D, E – fits the pattern.
- B A K D E – not a valid word.
- K A G D E – not a valid word.
- B A V D E – not a valid word.
- I A G D E – not a valid word.

""G A I D E"" is a valid English word (variant spelling of ""guide"" in some dialects or older usage). Let's check:
- G: allowed
- A: in position 2 (allowed, since A was in 3 before)
- I: allowed
- D: correct position 4
- E: correct position 5

This seems to be the best candidate.

<guess>GAIDE</guess>",GAIDE,"From the new feedback on MANDE:

- M(x) → M is not in the word.
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3 before, now it’s in position 2, so it must be in 1 or 4).
- N(x) → N is not in the word.
- D(✓) → D is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So the pattern is now: _ A _ D E  
Letters ruled out so far: R, O, S, P, L, T, C, H, F, M, N  
Letters still allowed: B, G, I, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word of the form: ? A ? D E
