For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first guess should use a mix of these letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good spread of high-frequency letters to test against the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the correct position (✓) – so the second letter is R
- O is in the correct position (✓) – so the third letter is O
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

- Word pattern: _ R O _ _
- Letters already ruled out: A, S, E

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has R as its second letter
2. Has O as its third letter
3. Does NOT contain A, S, or E

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels to try: I, U, Y

Let’s think of words that fit _ R O _ _:
- FROST – but S is ruled out
- CROON – but N might be good, but double O is possible
- PROUD – P, R, O, U, D – all letters are still possible
- GROIN – G, R, O, I, N – all still possible
- CROOK – C, R, O, O, K – but double O might be okay
- TROOP – T, R, O, O, P – double O again

""PROUD"" looks good because:

The feedback for guess 3 (crow) was that the model answer is not five letters. This is likely a formatting error or miscommunication, as all guesses should be five letters. The feedback ""Model answer is not five letters"" doesn't align with the rules, so we'll treat it as the feedback for ""crow"" being invalid (x) for all letters. However, since the user expects a five-letter word, we'll proceed normally.

From the prior feedback:
- Pattern: _ R O _ _
- Forbidden letters: A, S, E, P, U, D (from arose and proud)
- Additional forbidden letters: none from crow (assuming it was simply a formatting error)

We need a 5-letter word with R in position 2 and O in position 3, and no forbidden letters.

Good remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, T, V, W, Y
Good remaining vowels: I, Y (since A, E, U are out)

Possible words:
- BROWN – B, R, O, W, N → all allowed
- CROWN – C, R, O, W, N → all allowed
- GRIND – G, R, I, N, D → but D is forbidden
- CROON – C, R, O, O, N → double O is allowed, but N is allowed
- BROKE – B, R, O, K, E → E is forbidden
- CROAK – C, R, O, A, K → A is forbidden
- CROON – C, R, O, O, N → valid
- GROIN – G, R, O, I, N → valid
- HROCK – H, R, O, C, K → valid but uncommon
- TROOP – T, R, O, O, P → P is forbidden

""CROWN"" is a common word and fits all constraints:
- C (allowed)
- R (correct position)
- O (correct position)
- W (allowed)
- N (allowed)

So the next guess is CROWN.

<guess>crow</guess>",crow,"The feedback for guess 3 (crow) was that the model answer is not five letters. This is likely a formatting error or miscommunication, as all guesses should be five letters. The feedback ""Model answer is not five letters"" doesn't align with the rules, so we'll treat it as the feedback for ""crow"" being invalid (x) for all letters. However, since the user expects a five-letter word, we'll proceed normally.

From the prior feedback:
- Pattern: _ R O _ _
- Forbidden letters: A, S, E, P, U, D (from arose and proud)
- Additional forbidden letters: none from crow (assuming it was simply a formatting error)

We need a 5-letter word with R in position 2 and O in position 3, and no forbidden letters.

Good remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, T, V, W, Y
Good remaining vowels: I, Y (since A, E, U are out)

Possible words:
- BROWN – B, R, O, W, N → all allowed
- CROWN – C, R, O, W, N → all allowed
- GRIND – G, R, I, N, D → but D is forbidden
- CROON – C, R, O, O, N → double O is allowed, but N is allowed
- BROKE – B, R, O, K, E → E is forbidden
- CROAK – C, R, O, A, K → A is forbidden
- CROON – C, R, O, O, N → valid
- GROIN – G, R, O, I, N → valid
- HROCK – H, R, O, C, K → valid but uncommon
- TROOP – T, R, O, O, P → P is forbidden

""CROWN"" is a common word and fits all constraints:
- C (allowed)
- R (correct position)
- O (correct position)
- W (allowed)
- N (allowed)

So the next guess is CROWN.",Guess 4: crow -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.,FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first guess should use a mix of these letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good spread of high-frequency letters to test against the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the correct position (✓) – so the second letter is R
- O is in the correct position (✓) – so the third letter is O
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ R O _ _
- Letters already ruled out: A, S, E

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has R as its second letter
2. Has O as its third letter
3. Does NOT contain A, S, or E

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels to try: I, U, Y

Let’s think of words that fit _ R O _ _:
- FROST – but S is ruled out
- CROON – but N might be good, but double O is possible
- PROUD – P, R, O, U, D – all letters are still possible
- GROIN – G, R, O, I, N – all still possible
- CROOK – C, R, O, O, K – but double O might be okay
- TROOP – T, R, O, O, P – double O again

""PROUD"" looks good because:
- P, U, D are all still possible
- It uses new letters (P, U, D) that haven’t been tested yet
- It fits the pattern _ R O _ _

So I’ll guess PROUD.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: proud -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) O(✓) U(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
   - Pattern: _ R O _ _
   - Letters ruled out: A, S, E

2. proud → P(x) R(✓) O(✓) U(x) D(x)
   - Pattern still _ R O _ _
   - Additional letters ruled out: P, U, D

So far:
- Word shape: _ R O _ _
- Forbidden letters: A, S, E, P, U, D
- Allowed letters: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with any of the allowed consonants
- Has R in position 2 and O in position 3
- Ends with any of the allowed letters (but not the forbidden ones)

Good candidate endings: T, N, L, C, K, etc.

Possible words:
- B R O W N – B, R, O, W, N → all allowed
- C R O W N – C, R, O, W, N → all allowed
- G R O W N – G, R, O, W, N → all allowed
- F R O Z E – but E is forbidden
- M R O W N – M, R, O, W, N → all allowed

""CRONY"" is invalid because Y is allowed but we need to check positions. Actually, ""CRONY"" is C R O N Y – but N is allowed, Y is allowed. However, we need to check if it fits the pattern _ R O _ _ – yes, it does.

But let's pick one that's common and fits the pattern. ""CROWN"" seems like a good choice because:
- C is allowed
- R and O are correct positions
- W and N are allowed
- It's a common word

So the next guess is CROWN.

The feedback for guess 3 (crow) was that the model answer is not five letters. This is likely a formatting error or miscommunication, as all guesses should be five letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first guess should use a mix of these letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good spread of high-frequency letters to test against the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the correct position (✓) – so the second letter is R
- O is in the correct position (✓) – so the third letter is O
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ R O _ _
- Letters already ruled out: A, S, E

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has R as its second letter
2. Has O as its third letter
3. Does NOT contain A, S, or E

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels to try: I, U, Y

Let’s think of words that fit _ R O _ _:
- FROST – but S is ruled out
- CROON – but N might be good, but double O is possible
- PROUD – P, R, O, U, D – all letters are still possible
- GROIN – G, R, O, I, N – all still possible
- CROOK – C, R, O, O, K – but double O might be okay
- TROOP – T, R, O, O, P – double O again

""PROUD"" looks good because:
- P, U, D are all still possible
- It uses new letters (P, U, D) that haven’t been tested yet
- It fits the pattern _ R O _ _

So I’ll guess PROUD.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: proud -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) O(✓) U(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
   - Pattern: _ R O _ _
   - Letters ruled out: A, S, E

2. proud → P(x) R(✓) O(✓) U(x) D(x)
   - Pattern still _ R O _ _
   - Additional letters ruled out: P, U, D

So far:
- Word shape: _ R O _ _
- Forbidden letters: A, S, E, P, U, D
- Allowed letters: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with any of the allowed consonants
- Has R in position 2 and O in position 3
- Ends with any of the allowed letters (but not the forbidden ones)

Good candidate endings: T, N, L, C, K, etc.

Possible words:
- B R O W N – B, R, O, W, N → all allowed
- C R O W N – C, R, O, W, N → all allowed
- G R O W N – G, R, O, W, N → all allowed
- F R O Z E – but E is forbidden
- M R O W N – M, R, O, W, N → all allowed

""CRONY"" is invalid because Y is allowed but we need to check positions. Actually, ""CRONY"" is C R O N Y – but N is allowed, Y is allowed. However, we need to check if it fits the pattern _ R O _ _ – yes, it does.

But let's pick one that's common and fits the pattern. ""CROWN"" seems like a good choice because:
- C is allowed
- R and O are correct positions
- W and N are allowed
- It's a common word

So the next guess is CROWN.

Guess 2: proud -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) O(✓) U(x) D(x)
Guess 3: crow -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The feedback for guess 3 (crow) was that the model answer is not five letters. This is likely a formatting error or miscommunication, as all guesses should be five letters. The feedback ""Model answer is not five letters"" doesn't align with the rules, so we'll treat it as the feedback for ""crow"" being invalid (x) for all letters. However, since the user expects a five-letter word, we'll proceed normally.

From the prior feedback:
- Pattern: _ R O _ _
- Forbidden letters: A, S, E, P, U, D (from arose and proud)
- Additional forbidden letters: none from crow (assuming it was simply a formatting error)

We need a 5-letter word with R in position 2 and O in position 3, and no forbidden letters.

Good remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, T, V, W, Y
Good remaining vowels: I, Y (since A, E, U are out)

Possible words:
- BROWN – B, R, O, W, N → all allowed
- CROWN – C, R, O, W, N → all allowed
- GRIND – G, R, I, N, D → but D is forbidden
- CROON – C, R, O, O, N → double O is allowed, but N is allowed
- BROKE – B, R, O, K, E → E is forbidden
- CROAK – C, R, O, A, K → A is forbidden
- CROON – C, R, O, O, N → valid
- GROIN – G, R, O, I, N → valid
- HROCK – H, R, O, C, K → valid but uncommon
- TROOP – T, R, O, O, P → P is forbidden

""CROWN"" is a common word and fits all constraints:

- R (correct position)
- O (correct position)
- W (allowed)
