### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, I, O, U, R, S, T, L, N. One of the most common 5-letter words is ""AROSE"" because it contains several high-frequency letters (A, R, O, S, E) and can quickly reveal information about several positions. This should give me good coverage to narrow down the secret word in subsequent guesses.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, I, O, U, R, S, T, L, N. One of the most common 5-letter words is ""AROSE"" because it contains several high-frequency letters (A, R, O, S, E) and can quickly reveal information about several positions. This should give me good coverage to narrow down the secret word in subsequent guesses.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(✓) → R is in the word and is in position 2.
- O(x), S(x), E(x) → O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern: _ R _ _ _
- It contains an A somewhere except position 1.
- It does NOT contain O, S, or E.

Next guess should:
1. Keep R in position 2.
2. Introduce new common letters (avoiding O, S, E).
3. Try to place A in positions 2-5 (but position 2 is already R, so positions 3-5).
4. Use other common letters like T, N, L, I, C, U, etc.

A good candidate is ""TRIAL"":
- T: new common letter
- R: already known in position 2
- I: new common letter
- A: try placing A in position 3
- L: new common letter

This tests T, I, L while keeping R in place and moving A to position 3.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, I, O, U, R, S, T, L, N. One of the most common 5-letter words is ""AROSE"" because it contains several high-frequency letters (A, R, O, S, E) and can quickly reveal information about several positions. This should give me good coverage to narrow down the secret word in subsequent guesses.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(✓) → R is in the word and is in position 2.
- O(x), S(x), E(x) → O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern: _ R _ _ _
- It contains an A somewhere except position 1.
- It does NOT contain O, S, or E.

Next guess should:
1. Keep R in position 2.
2. Introduce new common letters (avoiding O, S, E).
3. Try to place A in positions 2-5 (but position 2 is already R, so positions 3-5).
4. Use other common letters like T, N, L, I, C, U, etc.

A good candidate is ""TRIAL"":
- T: new common letter
- R: already known in position 2
- I: new common letter
- A: try placing A in position 3
- L: new common letter

This tests T, I, L while keeping R in place and moving A to position 3.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: TRIAL -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) I(✓) A(✓) L(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   – R is locked in position 2.
   – A is in the word but not in position 1.
   – O, S, E are absent.

2. TRIAL → T(x) R(✓) I(✓) A(✓) L(x)
   – R is still in position 2.
   – I is in the word and in position 3.
   – A is in the word and in position 4.
   – T and L are absent.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ R I A _
- Letters definitely absent: O, S, E, T, L
- Letters definitely present: R (pos 2), I (pos 3), A (pos 4)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has the exact pattern _ R I A _
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (excluding O, S, E, T, L)
- Common remaining letters to test: N, C, D, U, M, P, H, Y, etc.

Candidate words fitting _ R I A _:
- CRICK → C, R, I, C, K (but C repeats and K is new)
- BRICK → B, R, I, C, K (all new letters except R, I, A)
- DRINK → D, R, I, N, K (but N and K are new)
- PRANK → P, R, A, N, K (but A is already fixed in pos 4, so PRANK would be P R A N K, but we need _ R I A _ → PRINK is invalid)
- CRIMP → C, R, I, M, P (but M and P are new)
- BRISK → B, R, I, S, K (but S is ruled out)
- CRISP → C, R, I, S, P (S is ruled out)
- DRIFT → D, R, I, F, T (T is ruled out)
- FRISK → F, R, I, S, K (S ruled out)

Best candidate seems ""BRICK"":
- B: new letter
- R: confirmed in pos 2
- I: confirmed in pos 3
- C: new letter
- K: new letter

Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: TRIAL -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) I(✓) A(✓) L(x)
Guess 3: BRICK -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) I(✓) C(x) K(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   – R is fixed in position 2.
   – A is in the word but not in position 1.
   – O, S, E are absent.

2. TRIAL → T(x) R(✓) I(✓) A(✓) L(x)
   – R, I, A are fixed in positions 2, 3, 4 respectively.
   – T and L are absent.

3. BRICK → B(x) R(✓) I(✓) C(x) K(x)
   – R, I are already confirmed.
   – C and K are absent.
   – B is absent.

So the pattern is now: _ R I A _
Letters already ruled out: O, S, E, T, L, C, K, B
Letters still allowed: A, R, I (already placed), plus any others not yet tested.

We need a 5-letter word with the pattern _ R I A _ that uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible letters left to test for positions 1 and 5: D, F, G, H, J, M, N, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common words:
- DRIFT → T is out
- PRANK → S is out
- FRANK → S is out
- DRINK → N and K, but K is out
- CRANK → C is out
- DRILL → L is out
- PRIDE → E is out
- PRISM → S is out
- DRIPS → S is out
- DRIFT → T is out
- FRUIT → T is out
- GRASP → S is out
- GRIND → N and D are new
- GRIND → G, R, I, N, D
  – G is new
  – R, I, A are fixed
  – N and D are new
  – No ruled-out letters appear

""GRIND"" fits _ R I A _ and uses only allowed letters.
