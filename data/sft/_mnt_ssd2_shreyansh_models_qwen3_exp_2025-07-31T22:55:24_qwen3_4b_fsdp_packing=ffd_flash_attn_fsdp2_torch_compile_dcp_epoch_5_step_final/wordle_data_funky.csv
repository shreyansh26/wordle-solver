### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. The goal is to maximize the information gained from the feedback. A good starting word often includes letters like A, E, T, R, S, N, L, etc. 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S, L, T (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)
- Covers a good spread of letters

This gives us a strong chance to identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

The feedback from SLATE tells us that none of the letters S, L, A, T, or E are in the secret word at all.  
That immediately eliminates a large portion of the alphabet, so we should avoid any letters from that set.

Now we need a new 5-letter word that uses only letters not in {S, L, A, T, E}.  
Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, B, M, P, F, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U.

A strong next guess should still use common letters while avoiding the eliminated ones.  
The word “CRONY” uses:
- C, R, N (common consonants)  
- O, Y (common vowels/consonants)  
- None of the letters are in the eliminated set.

This maximizes information while staying within the constraints.

From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)  
   Letters eliminated: S, L, A, T, E

2. CRONY → C(x) R(x) O(x) N(-) Y(✓)  
   Letters eliminated: C, R, O  
   Letters confirmed: Y is in the word and in the last position.  
   N is in the word but not in the 4th position.

So far we know:
- The word ends in Y.
- It contains N somewhere (but not 4th).
- It does NOT contain S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O.

Remaining common letters: D, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, B, F, J, Q, X, Z  
We need a 5-letter word ending in Y that includes N somewhere (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5) and uses only the allowed letters.

Candidate words:
- DUNNY – but N is repeated and we don’t know if duplicates are allowed (but duplicates are possible).
- FUNNY – same issue with N.
- HUNNY – same.
- MUNNY – same.
- PUNNY – same.
- WUNNY – same.

Looking for words with N and Y:
- NUNNY – valid word, ends in Y, has N in positions 1 and 3.
- PUNNY – same pattern.
- WUNNY – same.

However, we want to maximize information. A better choice is a word that introduces as many new letters as possible while respecting constraints.

Let’s try “FUNNY”:
- F, U, N, N, Y
- Uses F, U, N, Y (Y is confirmed in position 5).
- N is in position 3 (allowed since N is not in 4th).
- Introduces F and U, which are new letters.

From the three guesses so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)  
   Eliminated: S, L, A, T, E

2. CRONY → C(x) R(x) O(x) N(-) Y(✓)  
   Eliminated: C, R, O  
   Confirmed: Y is in position 5.

3. FUNNY → F(✓) U(✓) N(✓) N(-) Y(✓)  
   Confirmed: F, U, N in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively.  
   Y is confirmed in position 5.  
   The second N is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So the word pattern is:  
F U N _ Y

We need a 5-letter word that starts with F, second letter U, third letter N, ends with Y, and has another N somewhere (but not in position 4). The only possible position left for the second N is position 4, but the feedback says N(-) in position 4, so N cannot be in position 4. That leaves only one possible spot for the second N, which is impossible because positions 1-3 are already F, U, N and position 5 is Y. This suggests the word must have a single N in position 3 and no other N.

However, the feedback from FUNNY shows N(-) in position 4, which means the word contains N but it is not in position 4. Since positions 1-3 are F, U, N and position 5 is Y, the only remaining spot for N would be position 4, but that’s ruled out. This implies the word has only one N in position 3, and the feedback N(-) in position 4 must be a misinterpretation. Actually, the feedback for FUNNY shows:
- Position 1: F(✓) – correct
- Position 2: U(✓) – correct
- Position 3: N(✓) – correct
- Position 4: N(-) – letter N is in the word but not here (but N is already in position 3)
- Position 5: Y(✓) – correct

This suggests the word has exactly one N in position 3 and no other N. The feedback N(-) in position 4 is redundant because N is already placed correctly.

Therefore, the word must be F U N _ Y, with the blank being any letter not yet eliminated and not already used (F, U, N, Y are all used). Eliminated letters so far: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O.

Possible letters for position 4: D, G, H, I, K, M, P, V, W, B, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y (but F, U, N, Y are already used).

Common letters left: D, G, H, I, K, M, P, V, W.

Looking for 5-letter words matching F U N _ Y:
- FUNGI – but G is allowed, but I is not in position 4.
- FUNNY – already tried.
- FUNKY – K is allowed, Y is already in position 5.
- FUNDY – D is allowed.
- FUNNY – already tried.
- FUNGY – G is allowed.

FUNKY is a valid word and uses K, which has not been eliminated.

Thus, the next logical guess is FUNKY.
