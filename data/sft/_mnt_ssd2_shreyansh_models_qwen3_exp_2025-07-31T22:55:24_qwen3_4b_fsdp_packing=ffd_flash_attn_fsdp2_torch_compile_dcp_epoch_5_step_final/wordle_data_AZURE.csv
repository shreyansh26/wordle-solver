For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good starting word often contains vowels and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N, etc. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is a popular first guess because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives me good coverage to start narrowing down the letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- L(x) → L is not in the word at all.
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- T(x) → T is not in the word at all.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and is in the 5th position.

So far we know:
- The word ends with E.
- It contains A somewhere other than the 3rd position (so A must be in 1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th, but 5th is E, so 1st, 2nd, or 4th).
- It does NOT contain S, L, or T.

I need a new word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Contains A in position 1, 2, or 4.
3. Uses none of S, L, T.

Good next guesses should test new common letters while satisfying these constraints. Let's try ""CRANE"":
- C (new letter)
- R (new letter)
- A (must be in word, here in 3rd position – but feedback said A is not in 3rd position, so this is bad)
So CRANE is invalid because A would be in 3rd position.

Next try ""GRAPE"":
- G (new letter)
- R (new letter)
- A (3rd position – again invalid)

Next try ""CRANE"" is invalid, ""DRAPE"" is invalid, ""MARGE"" – ends with E, has A in 2nd position (valid), no S/L/T.

Let's try ""MARGE"":
- M (new)
- A (2nd position – valid)
- R (new)
- G (new)

Good next guesses should test new common letters while satisfying these constraints. Let's try ""CRANE"":
- C (new letter)
- R (new letter)
- A (must be in word, here in 3rd position – but feedback said A is not in 3rd position, so this is bad)
So CRANE is invalid because A would be in 3rd position.

Next try ""GRAPE"":
- G (new letter)
- R (new letter)
- A (3rd position – again invalid)

Next try ""CRANE"" is invalid, ""DRAPE"" is invalid, ""MARGE"" – ends with E, has A in 2nd position (valid), no S/L/T.

Let's try ""MARGE"":
- M (new)
- A (2nd position – valid)
- R (new)
- G (new)
- E (5th position – correct)

This seems good: it places A in 2nd position, tests new letters M, R, G, and keeps E in 5th.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: MARGE -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(-) R(-) G(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on MARGE:
- M(x) → M is not in the word.
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 2 (so A must be in position 1 or 4).
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 3.
- G(x) → G is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is still in position 5.

So far we know:
- Word ends with E.
- Contains A in position 1 or 4.
- Contains R somewhere except position 3.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, M, G.

We need a word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Has A in position 1 or 4.
3. Has R in position 2, 4, or 5 (but 5 is E, so 2 or 4).
4. Uses only letters not ruled out (no S, L, T, M, G).

Possible positions:
- If A is in position 1: A _ _ _ E
- If A is in position 4: _ _ _ A E

Let’s try to find a word that fits these constraints. A good next guess should test new common letters while satisfying the constraints.

Option 1: A _ _ _ E
- Common consonants left: R, N, C, H, B, K, etc.
- R must be in position 2 or 4. If R is in position 2: A R _ _ E. Need two more letters not ruled out.
- Possible word: ARBLE – but B and L are allowed? Wait, L was already ruled out (from SLATE feedback: L(x)). So L is out. B is allowed.

ARBLE:
- A(1) – allowed (position 1)
- R(2) – allowed (position 2)
- B(3) – allowed
- L(4) – L is ruled out (from SLATE feedback: L(x)), so this is invalid.

Next: A _ _ _ E with R in position 4: A _ _ R E
- Need two consonants for positions 2 and 3.
- Common letters left: N, C, H, K, etc.
- Possible word: ANCRE – but C and N are allowed, and R is in position 4 (allowed).
- Check letters: A, N, C, R, E – none are S, L, T, M, G. This seems valid.

Option 2: _ _ _ A E
- Need R in position 2 or 4 (but 4 is A, so R must be in position 2).
- Word pattern: _ R _ A E
- Possible word: B R A N E – but N is allowed, and letters are B, R, A, N, E – none are ruled out.
- Check constraints: A is in position 4 (allowed), R is in position 2 (allowed), ends with E (correct), no forbidden letters.

Between ANCRE and BRANE, BRANE seems more common and uses common letters.

Let’s go with BRANE.

Let's summarize the new feedback from BRANE:

- B(x) → B is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- A(-) → A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (and we already knew it wasn't in position 2 from MARGE).
- N(x) → N is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is still in position 5.

So far we know:
- Word ends with E.
- Contains A in positions 1 or 4 (since it can't be 2 or 3).
- Contains R in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since it can't be 2 or 5).
- Forbidden letters so far: S, L, T, M, G, B, N.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, with A in position 1 or 4, and R somewhere else (positions 1, 3, or 4).

Let’s list possible patterns:

1. A _ _ R E  (A in 1, R in 4)
2. _ _ A R E  (A in 4, R in 4 → impossible, R must be in 1 or 3)
3. _ R A _ E  (A in 3 → invalid)
4. R _ _ A E  (A in 4, R in 1)
5. _ _ R A E  (A in 4, R in 3)

So the possible patterns are:
- A _ _ R E
- R _ _ A E
- _ _ R A E

Let’s pick a word that fits one of these and uses only allowed letters.

Option 1: A _ _ R E
Letters allowed: any not in {S, L, T, M, G, B, N}. Common consonants left: C, D, F, H, K, P, etc.
Possible word: A C H R E → ACHE? No, that's 4 letters. A C H R E → ""ACHE"" + E? Not valid. Next: A C K R E → ""ACKRE"" – not a word. A C H R E – ""ACHE"" is 4 letters. Maybe A D R E – no. A C H R E – ""ACHE"" plus E? Not valid.

Option 2: R _ _ A E
Letters: R, A, E fixed. Need two more letters for positions 2 and 3, not forbidden.
Possible: R O A D E – ""ROAD E"" – not a word. R O A D E – ""ROAD E"" is 5 letters but not valid. R O A D E – ""ROAD E"" – no. R O A D E – ""ROAD E"" – no. R O A D E – ""ROAD E"" – no. R O A D E – ""ROAD E"" – no. R O A D E – ""ROAD E"" – no. R O A D E – ""ROAD E"" – no.

Option 3: _ _ R A E
Letters: R in 3, A in 4, E in 5. Need letters 1 and 2 from allowed set.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good starting word often contains vowels and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N, etc. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is a popular first guess because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives me good coverage to start narrowing down the letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- L(x) → L is not in the word at all.
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- T(x) → T is not in the word at all.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and is in the 5th position.

So far we know:
- The word ends with E.
- It contains A somewhere other than the 3rd position (so A must be in 1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th, but 5th is E, so 1st, 2nd, or 4th).
- It does NOT contain S, L, or T.

I need a new word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Contains A in position 1, 2, or 4.
3. Uses none of S, L, T.

Good next guesses should test new common letters while satisfying these constraints. Let's try ""CRANE"":
- C (new letter)
- R (new letter)
- A (must be in word, here in 3rd position – but feedback said A is not in 3rd position, so this is bad)
So CRANE is invalid because A would be in 3rd position.

Next try ""GRAPE"":
- G (new letter)
- R (new letter)
- A (3rd position – again invalid)

Next try ""CRANE"" is invalid, ""DRAPE"" is invalid, ""MARGE"" – ends with E, has A in 2nd position (valid), no S/L/T.

Let's try ""MARGE"":
- M (new)
- A (2nd position – valid)
- R (new)
- G (new)
- E (5th position – correct)

This seems good: it places A in 2nd position, tests new letters M, R, G, and keeps E in 5th.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: MARGE -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(-) R(-) G(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on MARGE:
- M(x) → M is not in the word.
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 2 (so A must be in position 1 or 4).
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 3.
- G(x) → G is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is still in position 5.

So far we know:
- Word ends with E.
- Contains A in position 1 or 4.
- Contains R somewhere except position 3.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, M, G.

We need a word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Has A in position 1 or 4.
3. Has R in position 2, 4, or 5 (but 5 is E, so 2 or 4).
4. Uses only letters not ruled out (no S, L, T, M, G).

Possible positions:
- If A is in position 1: A _ _ _ E
- If A is in position 4: _ _ _ A E

Let’s try to find a word that fits these constraints. A good next guess should test new common letters while satisfying the constraints.

Option 1: A _ _ _ E
- Common consonants left: R, N, C, H, B, K, etc.
- R must be in position 2 or 4. If R is in position 2: A R _ _ E. Need two more letters not ruled out.
- Possible word: ARBLE – but B and L are allowed? Wait, L was already ruled out (from SLATE feedback: L(x)). So L is out. B is allowed.

ARBLE:
- A(1) – allowed (position 1)
- R(2) – allowed (position 2)
- B(3) – allowed
- L(4) – L is ruled out (from SLATE feedback: L(x)), so this is invalid.

Next: A _ _ _ E with R in position 4: A _ _ R E
- Need two consonants for positions 2 and 3.
- Common letters left: N, C, H, K, etc.
- Possible word: ANCRE – but C and N are allowed, and R is in position 4 (allowed).
- Check letters: A, N, C, R, E – none are S, L, T, M, G. This seems valid.

Option 2: _ _ _ A E
- Need R in position 2 or 4 (but 4 is A, so R must be in position 2).
- Word pattern: _ R _ A E
- Possible word: B R A N E – but N is allowed, and letters are B, R, A, N, E – none are ruled out.
- Check constraints: A is in position 4 (allowed), R is in position 2 (allowed), ends with E (correct), no forbidden letters.

Between ANCRE and BRANE, BRANE seems more common and uses common letters.

Let’s go with BRANE.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good starting word often contains vowels and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N, etc. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is a popular first guess because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives me good coverage to start narrowing down the letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- L(x) → L is not in the word at all.
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- T(x) → T is not in the word at all.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and is in the 5th position.

So far we know:
- The word ends with E.
- It contains A somewhere other than the 3rd position (so A must be in 1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th, but 5th is E, so 1st, 2nd, or 4th).
- It does NOT contain S, L, or T.

I need a new word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Contains A in position 1, 2, or 4.
3. Uses none of S, L, T.

Good next guesses should test new common letters while satisfying these constraints. Let's try ""CRANE"":
- C (new letter)
- R (new letter)
- A (must be in word, here in 3rd position – but feedback said A is not in 3rd position, so this is bad)
So CRANE is invalid because A would be in 3rd position.

Next try ""GRAPE"":
- G (new letter)
- R (new letter)
- A (3rd position – again invalid)

Next try ""CRANE"" is invalid, ""DRAPE"" is invalid, ""MARGE"" – ends with E, has A in 2nd position (valid), no S/L/T.

Let's try ""MARGE"":
- M (new)
- A (2nd position – valid)
- R (new)
- G (new)
- E (5th position – correct)

This seems good: it places A in 2nd position, tests new letters M, R, G, and keeps E in 5th.

Guess 2: MARGE -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(-) R(-) G(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on MARGE:
- M(x) → M is not in the word.
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 2 (so A must be in position 1 or 4).
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 3.
- G(x) → G is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is still in position 5.

So far we know:
- Word ends with E.
- Contains A in position 1 or 4.
- Contains R somewhere except position 3.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, M, G.

We need a word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Has A in position 1 or 4.
3. Has R in position 2, 4, or 5 (but 5 is E, so 2 or 4).
4. Uses only letters not ruled out (no S, L, T, M, G).

Possible positions:
- If A is in position 1: A _ _ _ E
- If A is in position 4: _ _ _ A E

Let’s try to find a word that fits these constraints. A good next guess should test new common letters while satisfying the constraints.

Option 1: A _ _ _ E
- Common consonants left: R, N, C, H, B, K, etc.
- R must be in position 2 or 4. If R is in position 2: A R _ _ E. Need two more letters not ruled out.
- Possible word: ARBLE – but B and L are allowed? Wait, L was already ruled out (from SLATE feedback: L(x)). So L is out. B is allowed.

ARBLE:
- A(1) – allowed (position 1)
- R(2) – allowed (position 2)
- B(3) – allowed
- L(4) – L is ruled out (from SLATE feedback: L(x)), so this is invalid.

Next: A _ _ _ E with R in position 4: A _ _ R E
- Need two consonants for positions 2 and 3.
- Common letters left: N, C, H, K, etc.
- Possible word: ANCRE – but C and N are allowed, and R is in position 4 (allowed).
- Check letters: A, N, C, R, E – none are S, L, T, M, G. This seems valid.

Option 2: _ _ _ A E
- Need R in position 2 or 4 (but 4 is A, so R must be in position 2).
- Word pattern: _ R _ A E
- Possible word: B R A N E – but N is allowed, and letters are B, R, A, N, E – none are ruled out.
- Check constraints: A is in position 4 (allowed), R is in position 2 (allowed), ends with E (correct), no forbidden letters.

Between ANCRE and BRANE, BRANE seems more common and uses common letters.

Let’s go with BRANE.

Letters still allowed for positions 2 and 3: D, F, H, I, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word of the form A _ _ R E using only the allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- ADIRE → uses I and D, both allowed.
- AFIRE → uses F and I, both allowed.
- AIDRE → not a valid word.
- AFIRE is more common and valid.

Check AFIRE:
- A(1) – correct.
- F(2) – allowed.
- I(3) – allowed.
- R(4) – correct.
- E(5) – correct.

No letters are ruled out except those already excluded. AFIRE fits perfectly.

<guess>AFIRE</guess>",AFIRE,"From the feedback on ACORE:

- A(✓) → A is correct in position 1.
- C(x) → C is not in the word.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- R(✓) → R is correct in position 4.
- E(✓) → E is correct in position 5.

So the word pattern is now:
A _ _ R E
