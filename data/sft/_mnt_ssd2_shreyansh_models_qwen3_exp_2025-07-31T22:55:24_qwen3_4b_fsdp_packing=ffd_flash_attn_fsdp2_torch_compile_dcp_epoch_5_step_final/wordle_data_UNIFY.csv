### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters in different positions to test as many possibilities as possible.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeated letters. This should give me good coverage to narrow down the secret word quickly.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means the secret word contains none of those five letters.  
I now need a fresh set of common letters that are not in AROSE.  
The next most common letters that are not A, R, O, S, E are: T, I, N, L, C, U, D, P, M, H.  
I want a word that uses several of these to test as many new letters as possible.  
A good candidate is “UNTIL” – it uses U, N, T, I, L, none of which were in AROSE.  
Another good candidate is “CLINT” – but “UNTIL” is slightly more common.  
I’ll go with “UNTIL” as my second guess.

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ None of A, R, O, S, E appear in the word.

2. UNTIL → U(✓) N(✓) T(x) I(-) L(x)  
   ⇒ U and N are correct in their positions (first and second letters).  
   ⇒ I is in the word but not in the 4th position.  
   ⇒ T and L are not in the word.

So the pattern so far is:  
U N _ _ _  
with I somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5 (but not 4), and no A, R, O, S, E, T, L.

Remaining common letters (not yet ruled out):  
B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
But I is already confirmed in the word, so we’ll use I in position 3 or 5.

I’ll try to place I in position 3 and fill the remaining two slots with common letters not yet ruled out.  
A good candidate is “UNIFY” – it uses U, N, I, F, Y.  
F and Y have not been tested yet, and I is in the correct position (3rd).

Let’s check:  
- U and N are already confirmed correct.  
- I is placed in position 3 (allowed).  
- F and Y are new letters.  
This should give maximum information.
