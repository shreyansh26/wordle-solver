### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in English to maximize information gain. Common letters in 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should balance these letters to quickly identify which are in the secret word.

Looking at common starting words, ""SLATE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word. Other strong options include ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"", but ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a balanced first guess.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it’s not in position 1).
- L, A, T are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word and is in the correct final position (position 5).

So we know:
- The word ends with E.
- It contains an S somewhere other than the first position.
- It does NOT contain L, A, T.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that includes S (not in position 1) and avoids L, A, T.

Possible patterns:
- S _ _ _ E (but S can’t be first, so this is invalid)
- _ S _ _ E
- _ _ S _ E
- _ _ _ S E

We should pick a word that tests new common letters while satisfying these constraints. Good consonants to test next: R, N, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc. Good vowels to test: I, O (since A is ruled out).

Let’s try “CRISP”:
- Ends with P, but we know E is last, so this is invalid.

Let’s try “SPINE”:
- S is in position 1 (invalid, since S can’t be first)
- Ends with E (good)
- Contains P, I, N (all new letters)

But S can’t be first, so SPINE is invalid.

Let’s try “BRINE”:
- B, R, I, N, E
- Ends with E (good)
- No L, A, T
- S is not in the word (but we know S is in the word), so this is invalid.

We need an S in the word, not in position 1.

Let’s try “DRIVE”:
- D, R, I, V, E
- Ends with E (good)
- Contains no L, A, T
- No S, so invalid.

Let’s try “CRUSE”:
- C, R, U, S, E
- Ends with E (good)
- Contains S in position 4 (valid)
- Contains no L, A, T
- Tests new letters C, R, U

This seems good.

Another option is “GRASE”:
- G, R, A, S, E
- But A is ruled out, so invalid.

Another option is “PRASE”:
- P, R, A, S, E
- A is ruled out, so invalid.

Another option is “CRUSE” as above.

Looking at these, the only common valid word is DENSE.

Check DENSE:
- D, E, N, S, E
- Ends with SE (positions 4-5: S, E)
- S in position 4 (✓)
- E in position 5 (✓)
- Letters used: D, N, S, E

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in English to maximize information gain. Common letters in 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should balance these letters to quickly identify which are in the secret word.

Looking at common starting words, ""SLATE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word. Other strong options include ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"", but ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a balanced first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it’s not in position 1).
- L, A, T are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word and is in the correct final position (position 5).

So we know:
- The word ends with E.
- It contains an S somewhere other than the first position.
- It does NOT contain L, A, T.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that includes S (not in position 1) and avoids L, A, T.

Possible patterns:
- S _ _ _ E (but S can’t be first, so this is invalid)
- _ S _ _ E
- _ _ S _ E
- _ _ _ S E

We should pick a word that tests new common letters while satisfying these constraints. Good consonants to test next: R, N, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc. Good vowels to test: I, O (since A is ruled out).

Let’s try “CRISP”:
- Ends with P, but we know E is last, so this is invalid.

Let’s try “SPINE”:
- S is in position 1 (invalid, since S can’t be first)
- Ends with E (good)
- Contains P, I, N (all new letters)

But S can’t be first, so SPINE is invalid.

Let’s try “BRINE”:
- B, R, I, N, E
- Ends with E (good)
- No L, A, T
- S is not in the word (but we know S is in the word), so this is invalid.

We need an S in the word, not in position 1.

Let’s try “DRIVE”:
- D, R, I, V, E
- Ends with E (good)
- Contains no L, A, T
- No S, so invalid.

Let’s try “CRUSE”:
- C, R, U, S, E
- Ends with E (good)
- Contains S in position 4 (valid)
- Contains no L, A, T
- Tests new letters C, R, U

This seems good.

Another option is “GRASE”:
- G, R, A, S, E
- But A is ruled out, so invalid.

Another option is “PRASE”:
- P, R, A, S, E
- A is ruled out, so invalid.

Another option is “CRUSE” as above.

Another option is “PRUSE”:
- P, R, U, S, E
- Ends with E (good)
- Contains S in position 4 (valid)
- Contains no L, A, T
- Tests new letters P, R, U

This is also good.

Between CRUSE and PRUSE, CRUSE tests C and R, while PRUSE tests P and R. Either is fine, but CRUSE is slightly more common.

Let’s go with CRUSE.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: CRUSE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) U(x) S(✓) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1
   - E is in the word and in position 5
   - L, A, T are not in the word

2. CRUSE → C(x) R(x) U(x) S(✓) E(✓)
   - S is now confirmed to be in position 4
   - E is confirmed to be in position 5
   - C, R, U are not in the word

So we know:
- Word ends with SE (positions 4 and 5)
- S is in position 4
- E is in position 5
- Letters not in the word: L, A, T, C, R, U

We need a 5-letter word ending in SE, containing S in position 4, and avoiding L, A, T, C, R, U.

Possible patterns: _ _ S E

Letters still allowed: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s list some common 5-letter words ending in SE with S in position 4:
- DENSE
- GENSE (not a valid word)
- MENSE (not a valid word)
- PENSE (not a valid word)
- WENSE (not a valid word)
- HENSE (not a valid word)
- FENSE (not a valid word)
- VENSE (not a valid word)
- JENSE (not a valid word)
- KENSE (not a valid word)
- MENSE (not a valid word)
- PENSE (not a valid word)
- WENSE (not a valid word)
- XENSE (not a valid word)
- YENSE (not a valid word)
- ZENSE (not a valid word)

Looking at these, the only common valid word is DENSE.

Check DENSE:
- D, E, N, S, E
- Ends with SE (positions 4-5: S, E)
- S in position 4 (✓)
- E in position 5 (✓)
- Letters used: D, N, S, E
- Letters avoided: L, A, T, C, R, U (all absent)

Therefore, DENSE is a valid next guess.

From the three rounds we now know:

We need a 5-letter word of the form: _ _ S E, using only the allowed letters.

Valid English words ending in “SE” with S in position 4:
- FUSE (4 letters) – too short  
- HUSE (not a word)  
- JUSE (not a word)  
- KUSE (not a word)  
- MUSE (M, U, S, E) – but U is ruled out

- WUSE (not a word)  
- XUSE (not a word)

Looking at the remaining letters, the only common valid word is “MUSE” but U is out.  
The next most common word is “HUSE” (a dialectal variant), but it’s obscure.  
Another possibility is “FUSE” but it’s 4 letters.

Wait, let me re-check:  
Are there any 5-letter words ending in “SE” with S in position 4 and using only the allowed letters?  
Yes: “MUSE” is 4 letters, but we need 5.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in English to maximize information gain. Common letters in 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should balance these letters to quickly identify which are in the secret word.

Looking at common starting words, ""SLATE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word. Other strong options include ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"", but ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a balanced first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it’s not in position 1).
- L, A, T are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word and is in the correct final position (position 5).

So we know:
- The word ends with E.
- It contains an S somewhere other than the first position.
- It does NOT contain L, A, T.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that includes S (not in position 1) and avoids L, A, T.

Possible patterns:
- S _ _ _ E (but S can’t be first, so this is invalid)
- _ S _ _ E
- _ _ S _ E
- _ _ _ S E

We should pick a word that tests new common letters while satisfying these constraints. Good consonants to test next: R, N, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc. Good vowels to test: I, O (since A is ruled out).

Let’s try “CRISP”:
- Ends with P, but we know E is last, so this is invalid.

Let’s try “SPINE”:
- S is in position 1 (invalid, since S can’t be first)
- Ends with E (good)
- Contains P, I, N (all new letters)

But S can’t be first, so SPINE is invalid.

Let’s try “BRINE”:
- B, R, I, N, E
- Ends with E (good)
- No L, A, T
- S is not in the word (but we know S is in the word), so this is invalid.

We need an S in the word, not in position 1.

Let’s try “DRIVE”:
- D, R, I, V, E
- Ends with E (good)
- Contains no L, A, T
- No S, so invalid.

Let’s try “CRUSE”:
- C, R, U, S, E
- Ends with E (good)
- Contains S in position 4 (valid)
- Contains no L, A, T
- Tests new letters C, R, U

This seems good.

Another option is “GRASE”:
- G, R, A, S, E
- But A is ruled out, so invalid.

Another option is “PRASE”:
- P, R, A, S, E
- A is ruled out, so invalid.

Another option is “CRUSE” as above.

Another option is “PRUSE”:
- P, R, U, S, E
- Ends with E (good)
- Contains S in position 4 (valid)
- Contains no L, A, T
- Tests new letters P, R, U

This is also good.

Between CRUSE and PRUSE, CRUSE tests C and R, while PRUSE tests P and R. Either is fine, but CRUSE is slightly more common.

Let’s go with CRUSE.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: CRUSE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) U(x) S(✓) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1
   - E is in the word and in position 5
   - L, A, T are not in the word

2. CRUSE → C(x) R(x) U(x) S(✓) E(✓)
   - S is now confirmed to be in position 4
   - E is confirmed to be in position 5
   - C, R, U are not in the word

So we know:
- Word ends with SE (positions 4 and 5)
- S is in position 4
- E is in position 5
- Letters not in the word: L, A, T, C, R, U

We need a 5-letter word ending in SE, containing S in position 4, and avoiding L, A, T, C, R, U.

Possible patterns: _ _ S E

Letters still allowed: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s list some common 5-letter words ending in SE with S in position 4:
- DENSE
- GENSE (not a valid word)
- MENSE (not a valid word)
- PENSE (not a valid word)
- WENSE (not a valid word)
- HENSE (not a valid word)
- FENSE (not a valid word)
- VENSE (not a valid word)
- JENSE (not a valid word)
- KENSE (not a valid word)
- MENSE (not a valid word)
- PENSE (not a valid word)
- WENSE (not a valid word)
- XENSE (not a valid word)
- YENSE (not a valid word)
- ZENSE (not a valid word)

Looking at these, the only common valid word is DENSE.

Check DENSE:
- D, E, N, S, E
- Ends with SE (positions 4-5: S, E)
- S in position 4 (✓)
- E in position 5 (✓)
- Letters used: D, N, S, E
- Letters avoided: L, A, T, C, R, U (all absent)

Therefore, DENSE is a valid next guess.

From the feedback so far:

- E is fixed in position 5.
- S is fixed in position 4.
- Letters ruled out so far: L, A, T, C, R, U, D, N.
- Word pattern: _ _ S E

Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 2 (from the alphabet excluding the ruled-out set): B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need common 5-letter words that fit _ _ S E. Some candidates:
- B I S E (but that’s 4 letters)
- B O S E (but that’s 4 letters)
- B I S E (invalid)
- M I S E (invalid)
- P I S E (invalid)
- W I S E (valid word)

- F I S E (invalid)
- G I S E (invalid)
- H I S E (invalid)
- K I S E (invalid)
- V I S E (invalid)
- W I S E (valid word)

The most common valid word fitting _ _ S E is W I S E.

Check W I S E:
- W (position 1), I (position 2), S (position 3), E (position 4), E (position 5)
Wait, but we know S is in position 4 and E in 5, so the word must be _ _ S E.

Looking again, the pattern is _ _ S E, so positions 1 and 2 are unknown, 3 is S, 4 and 5 are E.

Common words fitting _ _ S E:
- B I S E (invalid)
- F I S E (invalid)
- G I S E (invalid)
- H I S E (invalid)
- K I S E (invalid)
- M I S E (invalid)
- P I S E (invalid)

- V O S E (invalid)
- W O S E (invalid)

After checking, the only valid 5-letter word fitting _ _ S E with S in position 3 and E in 5 is W I S E, but that would be W I S E, which is 4 letters. This suggests I made an error in interpreting the pattern.

Re-evaluating: the feedback shows S in position 4 and E in position 5, so the pattern is _ _ _ S E.

Common words fitting _ _ _ S E:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in English to maximize information gain. Common letters in 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should balance these letters to quickly identify which are in the secret word.

Looking at common starting words, ""SLATE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word. Other strong options include ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"", but ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a balanced first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it’s not in position 1).
- L, A, T are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word and is in the correct final position (position 5).

So we know:
- The word ends with E.
- It contains an S somewhere other than the first position.
- It does NOT contain L, A, T.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that includes S (not in position 1) and avoids L, A, T.

Possible patterns:
- S _ _ _ E (but S can’t be first, so this is invalid)
- _ S _ _ E
- _ _ S _ E
- _ _ _ S E

We should pick a word that tests new common letters while satisfying these constraints. Good consonants to test next: R, N, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc. Good vowels to test: I, O (since A is ruled out).

Let’s try “CRISP”:
- Ends with P, but we know E is last, so this is invalid.

Let’s try “SPINE”:
- S is in position 1 (invalid, since S can’t be first)
- Ends with E (good)
- Contains P, I, N (all new letters)

But S can’t be first, so SPINE is invalid.

Let’s try “BRINE”:
- B, R, I, N, E
- Ends with E (good)
- No L, A, T
- S is not in the word (but we know S is in the word), so this is invalid.

We need an S in the word, not in position 1.

Let’s try “DRIVE”:
- D, R, I, V, E
- Ends with E (good)
- Contains no L, A, T
- No S, so invalid.

Let’s try “CRUSE”:
- C, R, U, S, E
- Ends with E (good)
- Contains S in position 4 (valid)
- Contains no L, A, T
- Tests new letters C, R, U

This seems good.

Another option is “GRASE”:
- G, R, A, S, E
- But A is ruled out, so invalid.

Another option is “PRASE”:
- P, R, A, S, E
- A is ruled out, so invalid.

Another option is “CRUSE” as above.

Another option is “PRUSE”:
- P, R, U, S, E
- Ends with E (good)
- Contains S in position 4 (valid)
- Contains no L, A, T
- Tests new letters P, R, U

This is also good.

Between CRUSE and PRUSE, CRUSE tests C and R, while PRUSE tests P and R. Either is fine, but CRUSE is slightly more common.

Let’s go with CRUSE.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: CRUSE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) U(x) S(✓) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1
   - E is in the word and in position 5
   - L, A, T are not in the word

2. CRUSE → C(x) R(x) U(x) S(✓) E(✓)
   - S is now confirmed to be in position 4
   - E is confirmed to be in position 5
   - C, R, U are not in the word

So we know:
- Word ends with SE (positions 4 and 5)
- S is in position 4
- E is in position 5
- Letters not in the word: L, A, T, C, R, U

We need a 5-letter word ending in SE, containing S in position 4, and avoiding L, A, T, C, R, U.

Possible patterns: _ _ S E

Letters still allowed: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s list some common 5-letter words ending in SE with S in position 4:
- DENSE
- GENSE (not a valid word)
- MENSE (not a valid word)
- PENSE (not a valid word)
- WENSE (not a valid word)
- HENSE (not a valid word)
- FENSE (not a valid word)
- VENSE (not a valid word)
- JENSE (not a valid word)
- KENSE (not a valid word)
- MENSE (not a valid word)
- PENSE (not a valid word)
- WENSE (not a valid word)
- XENSE (not a valid word)
- YENSE (not a valid word)
- ZENSE (not a valid word)

Looking at these, the only common valid word is DENSE.

Check DENSE:
- D, E, N, S, E
- Ends with SE (positions 4-5: S, E)
- S in position 4 (✓)
- E in position 5 (✓)
- Letters used: D, N, S, E
- Letters avoided: L, A, T, C, R, U (all absent)

Therefore, DENSE is a valid next guess.

Common letters in 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should balance these letters to quickly identify which are in the secret word.\n\nLooking at common starting words, ""SLATE"" is a popular choice because it contains:\n- S (very common starting letter)\n- L (common consonant)\n- A (most common vowel)\n- T (common consonant)\n- E (most common vowel)\n\nThis gives us a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

From all feedback so far we know:

1. Word ends with SE (positions 4 and 5 are S and E respectively).
2. Letters not in the word at all: L, A, T, C, R, U, D, N.
3. Therefore the first three letters must be chosen only from the remaining alphabet: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form _ _ S E, using only the allowed letters for positions 1-3.

Common 5-letter words ending in SE with S in position 4:
- FUSE? No, it’s 4 letters.
- HENSE? Not valid.
- PENSE? Not valid.
- MENSE? Not valid.
- GENSE? Not valid.
- WENSE? Not valid.
- BENSE? Not valid.
- VENSE? Not valid.

Looking at remaining letters, the only common valid word that fits is:

M O S S E – but that has two S’s and we already know S is in position 4.
P O S S E – same issue.
B O S S E – same issue.
F O S S E – same issue.

Actually, let’s list all valid 5-letter words ending in SE with S in position 4 and E in 5:
- B O S S E – invalid (double S)
- C O S S E – C is out
- F O S S E – double S
- G O S S E – double S
- H O S S E – double S
- J O S S E – double S
- K O S S E – double S
- M O S S E – double S
- P O S S E – double S
- Q O S S E – double S
- V O S S E – double S
- W O S S E – double S
- X O S S E – double S
- Y O S S E – double S
- Z O S S E – double S

None of these are valid. This suggests we need to look for words with single S in position 4 and E in 5, using other letters.

Valid 5-letter words ending in SE with S in position 4:
- B O S S E – invalid
- C O S S E – C out
- F O S S E – invalid

- J O S S E – invalid

- Q O S S E – invalid
- V O S S E – invalid
- W O S S E – invalid
- X O S S E – invalid
- Y O S S E – invalid
- Z O S S E – invalid

This indicates we need to look for words with different letters. Let’s try:

- F I S H E – but ends with HE, not SE.
- B I S H E – same.
- M I S S E – ends with SE, S in position 4, E in 5, uses B, I, S, E – but B is allowed, I is allowed, S is allowed, E is allowed, M is allowed, but M is in position 1, which is fine.

Check M I S S E:
- M, I, S, S, E
- Ends with SE (positions 4-5: S, E)
- S in position 4 (✓)
- E in position 5 (✓)
- Letters used: M, I, S, E
- Letters avoided: L, A, T, C, R, U, D, N (all absent)

This is valid.

Another option is P I S S E – but P is allowed, I is allowed, S is allowed, E is allowed, but P I S S E is not a valid word.

Another option is B I S S E – not valid.

Another option is G I S S E – not valid.

Another option is H I S S E – not valid.

Another option is V I S S E – not valid.

Another option is W I S S E – not valid.

Another option is K I S S E – not valid.

Another option is F I S S E – not valid.

Thus, the only valid word seems to be M I S S E.

But let’s double-check: M I S S E is actually a valid word (misses).

Therefore, the next guess is MISS E.

But we need a 5-letter word ending in SE with S in position 4 and E in 5. MISS E is 5 letters: M, I, S, S, E.

Yes, this fits all constraints.
