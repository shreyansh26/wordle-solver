- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. Common starting words often include letters like A, E, T, R, S, L, N, etc. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English to maximize information gain.

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- ROAST (R, O, A, S, T)

I'll choose SLATE as it covers very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and has a good mix of vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 (✓)
- L is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- A is not in the word (x)
- T is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So far we know:
1. The word starts with S.
2. It contains L somewhere (but not in position 2).
3. It contains E somewhere (but not in position 5).
4. It does NOT contain A or T.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S
- Contains L and E (each in positions other than 2 and 5 respectively)
- Does NOT contain A or T

Possible positions for L: 3, 4, or 5
Possible positions for E: 1, 3, 4 (but 1 is already S, so 3 or 4)

Let me think of words that fit:
- S_ _ E _ with L in 3 or 4
- S_ L _ E
- S_ _ L _ with E in 3 or 4

Examples:
- SHIEL (but H is uncommon, I is possible)
- SPLEEN (too long, contains A)
- SLIME (contains M and I, but no A/T)
- SLEET (contains T, which is forbidden)
- SLEEK (contains K, but no A/T)
- SLEPT (contains T, forbidden)
- SLEPT is out, T is forbidden.
- SLICE (contains C and I, but no A/T)
- SLIDE (contains D and I, but no A/T)
- SLING (contains N and G, but no A/T)
- SLIME (contains M and I)

SLIDE seems good: S L I D E
Check positions:
- S is correct in position 1
- L is in position 2 (but feedback said L is not in position 2) → conflict.

So SLIDE is invalid because L would be in position 2 again.

Next option: S_ _ L _ with E in 3 or 4
- S_ E L _ → S E L _ _ → need two more letters, no A/T
- S_ _ E L → S _ _ E L → need two more letters, no A/T

Possible words:
- S H E L F → but F is possible, but no A/T
- S H E L F → positions: S(✓), H(new), E(3), L(4), F(new)
- S P E L L → but L would be in position 5, which is allowed for L (since L is not in position 2)
- S P E L L → positions: S(✓), P(new), E(3), L(4), L(5)

SPELL seems good:
- Starts with S
- Contains E in position 3
- Contains L in positions 4 and 5 (both allowed)
- No A or T

From the new feedback on SPELL:

- S(✓) – still correct in position 1.
- P(✓) – correct in position 2.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 3.
- L(-) – L is in the word but not in position 4.
- L(✓) – second L is correct in position 5.

So the pattern is now:
S P _ _ L

We already know:
- The word has L somewhere (positions 3 and 4 are ruled out for L, so L must be in position 3, but feedback says L is not in position 4 and E is not in position 3. Wait, let me re-examine:

Actually, the feedback for L in SPELL shows:
- Position 4: L(-) – L is in the word but not in position 4.
- Position 5: L(✓) – L is correct in position 5.

So the word ends with L (position 5) and contains L somewhere else (positions 2, 3, or 4). But position 2 is already P, so L must be in position 3.

Thus the pattern is:
S P L _ L

Now we need to find a valid 5-letter word that starts with S, has P in position 2, L in position 3, and ends with L. The missing letter (position 4) must be a consonant that hasn’t been ruled out.

Letters ruled out so far: A, T
Letters we know are present: S, P, L, E (E is in the word but not in position 3, so it must be in position 4 or 5, but position 5 is L, so E must be in position 4).

Wait, let me check:
From SLATE: E is in the word but not in position 5.
From SPELL: E is in the word but not in position 3.

So E could be in position 4.

Thus the word would be S P L E L.

Is ""S P L E L"" a valid English word? ""SPELE"" is not a word, but ""S P L E L"" is not valid either. Hmm, this seems problematic.

Let me re-examine:
The pattern is S P _ _ L.
We know E is in the word but not in position 3 or 5 (from SLATE: not in 5, from SPELL: not in 3). Therefore E must be in position 4.

So the word must be S P _ E L.

Now we need a consonant for position 3 that is not A or T.

Possible consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, R, etc.

Possible words:
- SPBEL – not a word
- SPCEL – not a word
- SPDEL – not a word
- SPEGEL – too long
- S P E L L – but we already tried that and it didn't fit
- S P H E L – not a word
- S P I E L – ""SPIEL"" is a valid word (a musical performance or a term in music theory).

SPIEL fits:
- S(✓) P(✓) I(new) E(new) L(✓)
- It contains L in position 5 (correct) and E in position 4 (allowed since E is not in position 3 or 5).
- It doesn't contain A or T.
- All letters are new except S, P, L, which are already confirmed.

Therefore, the next guess is SPIEL.

Actually, the feedback for L in SPELL shows:
- Position 4: L(-) – L is in the word but not in position 4.
- Position 5: L(✓) – L is correct in position 5.

So the word ends with L (position 5) and contains L somewhere else (positions 2, 3, or 4). But position 2 is already P, so L must be in position 3.

Thus the pattern is:
S P L _ L

Now we need to find a valid 5-letter word that starts with S, has P in position 2, L in position 3, and ends with L. The missing letter (position 4) must be a consonant that hasn’t been ruled out.

Letters ruled out so far: A, T
Letters we know are present: S, P, L, E (E is in the word but not in position 3, so it must be in position 4 or 5, but position 5 is L, so E must be in position 4).

Wait, let me check:
From SLATE: E is in the word but not in position 5.
From SPELL: E is in the word but not in position 3.

So E could be in position 4.

Thus the word would be S P L E L.

Is ""S P L E L"" a valid English word? ""SPELE"" is not a word, but ""S P L E L"" is not valid either. Hmm, this seems problematic.

Let me re-examine:
The pattern is S P _ _ L.
We know E is in the word but not in position 3 or 5 (from SLATE: not in 5, from SPELL: not in 3). Therefore E must be in position 4.

So the word must be S P _ E L.

Now we need a consonant for position 3 that is not A or T.

Possible consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, R, etc.

Possible words:
- SPBEL – not a word
- SPCEL – not a word
- SPDEL – not a word
- SPEGEL – too long
- S P E L L – but we already tried that and it didn't fit
- S P H E L – not a word
- S P I E L – ""SPIEL"" is a valid word (a musical performance or a term in music theory).

SPIEL fits:
- S(✓) P(✓) I(new) E(new) L(✓)
- It contains L in position 5 (correct) and E in position 4 (allowed since E is not in position 3 or 5).
- It doesn't contain A or T.
- All letters are new except S, P, L, which are already confirmed.

Therefore, the next guess is SPIEL.",Guess 3: SPIEL -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(✓) I(✓) E(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
