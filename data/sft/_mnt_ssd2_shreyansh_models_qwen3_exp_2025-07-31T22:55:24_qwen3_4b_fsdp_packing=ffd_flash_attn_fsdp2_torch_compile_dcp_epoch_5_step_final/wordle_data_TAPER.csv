For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, T, R, S, etc. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- A (very common starting letter)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (most common letter in English)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should give me good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on AROSE:

A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.  
R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.  
O(x) → O is not in the word.  
S(x) → S is not in the word.  
E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word contains: A, R, E (each somewhere else), and does NOT contain O or S.  
We need a 5-letter word that:
- has A, R, E in positions other than 1, 2, 5 respectively,
- avoids O and S.

Let’s try to place A, R, E in new spots while introducing new common letters.  
A good candidate is “RAE” + two new consonants.  
“RAE” could be part of “RATED” or “RAISE,” but those have S or O.  
Another candidate: “TREND” – but T and N are new, and E is in position 4, R in 2, but A is missing.  
“DREAD” – has A in 3, R in 2 and 4, E in 5 (but E is forbidden in 5).  
“REACT” – has A in 3, R in 2, E in 1 (but E is forbidden in 1).  
“EARLY” – has A in 2, E in 1 (forbidden), R in 3, but Y is new.  
“EARLY” is invalid due to E in 1.  
“EARLY” → invalid.  
“EARLY” → E in 1 is forbidden.  
“EARLY” → A in 2 is allowed, but E in 1 is not.  

Let’s try “TREAD” – T, R, E, A, D.  
Positions:  
- A is in 4 (allowed, since A was only forbidden in 1).  
- R is in 3 (allowed, since R was only forbidden in 2).  
- E is in 5 (forbidden, as E was only allowed not in 5).  

“TREAD” is invalid.  

Try “DREAD” – D, R, E, A, D.  
A in 4 (allowed), R in 3 (allowed), E in 5 (forbidden).  

Try “EARLY” – E in 1 (forbidden).  

Try “RATED” – R, A, T, E, D.  
A in 2 (allowed), R in 1 (allowed), E in 5 (forbidden).  

Try “RAINY” – R, A, I, N, Y.  
A in 2 (allowed), R in 1 (allowed), but no E.  

We must include A, R, E.  
Try “EARLY” – E in 1 is forbidden.  
Try “EARLY” – invalid.  

Try “RAE” + two new letters: “RAE” could be part of “RAE” + consonants.  
“RAE” + “T” + “N” → “RATEN” – not a word.  
“RAE” + “L” + “D” → “RALED” – not a word.  
“RAE” + “L” + “Y” → “RAELY” – not a word.  

Try “E” in 3: “TREND” – no A.  
“BREAD” – B, R, E, A, D.  
Positions:  
- B is new.  
- R in 2 (forbidden).  

“BREAD” invalid.  

Try “GREAT” – G, R, E, A, T.  
R in 2 (forbidden).  

“CREAM” – C, R, E, A, M.  
R in 2 (forbidden).  

“FREAK” – F, R, E, A, K.  
R in 2 (forbidden).  

“HAREM” – H, A, R, E, M.  
A in 2 (allowed), R in 3 (allowed), E in 5 (forbidden).  

“HAREM” invalid.  

Try “MARES” – but S is forbidden.  

Try “PARES” – S forbidden.  

Try “WATER” – W, A, T, E, R.  
A in 2 (allowed), E in 5 (forbidden), R in 5 (allowed).  

“WATER” invalid.  

Try “TWEAR” – T, W, E, A, R.  
E in 3 (allowed), A in 4 (allowed), R in 5 (allowed).  
This seems valid:  
- Contains A, R, E.  
- A not in 1, R not in 2, E not in 5.  
- No O or S.  
- All letters are new except A, R, E.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, T, R, S, etc. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- A (very common starting letter)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (most common letter in English)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should give me good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.  
R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.  
O(x) → O is not in the word.  
S(x) → S is not in the word.  
E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word contains: A, R, E (each somewhere else), and does NOT contain O or S.  
We need a 5-letter word that:
- has A, R, E in positions other than 1, 2, 5 respectively,
- avoids O and S.

Let’s try to place A, R, E in new spots while introducing new common letters.  
A good candidate is “RAE” + two new consonants.  
“RAE” could be part of “RATED” or “RAISE,” but those have S or O.  
Another candidate: “TREND” – but T and N are new, and E is in position 4, R in 2, but A is missing.  
“DREAD” – has A in 3, R in 2 and 4, E in 5 (but E is forbidden in 5).  
“REACT” – has A in 3, R in 2, E in 1 (but E is forbidden in 1).  
“EARLY” – has A in 2, E in 1 (forbidden), R in 3, but Y is new.  
“EARLY” is invalid due to E in 1.  
“EARLY” → invalid.  
“EARLY” → E in 1 is forbidden.  
“EARLY” → A in 2 is allowed, but E in 1 is not.  

Let’s try “TREAD” – T, R, E, A, D.  
Positions:  
- A is in 4 (allowed, since A was only forbidden in 1).  
- R is in 3 (allowed, since R was only forbidden in 2).  
- E is in 5 (forbidden, as E was only allowed not in 5).  

“TREAD” is invalid.  

Try “DREAD” – D, R, E, A, D.  
A in 4 (allowed), R in 3 (allowed), E in 5 (forbidden).  

Try “EARLY” – E in 1 (forbidden).  

Try “RATED” – R, A, T, E, D.  
A in 2 (allowed), R in 1 (allowed), E in 5 (forbidden).  

Try “RAINY” – R, A, I, N, Y.  
A in 2 (allowed), R in 1 (allowed), but no E.  

We must include A, R, E.  
Try “EARLY” – E in 1 is forbidden.  
Try “EARLY” – invalid.  

Try “RAE” + two new letters: “RAE” could be part of “RAE” + consonants.  
“RAE” + “T” + “N” → “RATEN” – not a word.  
“RAE” + “L” + “D” → “RALED” – not a word.  
“RAE” + “L” + “Y” → “RAELY” – not a word.  

Try “E” in 3: “TREND” – no A.  
“BREAD” – B, R, E, A, D.  
Positions:  
- B is new.  
- R in 2 (forbidden).  

“BREAD” invalid.  

Try “GREAT” – G, R, E, A, T.  
R in 2 (forbidden).  

“CREAM” – C, R, E, A, M.  
R in 2 (forbidden).  

“FREAK” – F, R, E, A, K.  
R in 2 (forbidden).  

“HAREM” – H, A, R, E, M.  
A in 2 (allowed), R in 3 (allowed), E in 5 (forbidden).  

“HAREM” invalid.  

Try “MARES” – but S is forbidden.  

Try “PARES” – S forbidden.  

Try “WATER” – W, A, T, E, R.  
A in 2 (allowed), E in 5 (forbidden), R in 5 (allowed).  

“WATER” invalid.  

Try “TWEAR” – T, W, E, A, R.  
E in 3 (allowed), A in 4 (allowed), R in 5 (allowed).  
This seems valid:  
- Contains A, R, E.  
- A not in 1, R not in 2, E not in 5.  
- No O or S.  
- All letters are new except A, R, E.  

“TWEAR” is a valid word meaning to wear out.

From the feedback so far:

- T is locked in position 1 (✓).
- A is locked in position 2 (✓).
- E is locked in position 4 (✓).
- R is locked in position 5 (✓).
- C is not in the word (x).

So the word is now fully determined as:
T A _ E R

We just need the 3rd letter.  
Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): any letter except O, S, W, C.

Common 3rd letters that make valid 5-letter words:
- T A C E R → already tried (C is invalid)
- T A L E R → ""TALER"" (a unit of currency, valid word)
- T A M E R → ""TAMER"" (valid word)
- T A P E R → ""TAPER"" (valid word)
- T A G E R → ""TAGER"" (not a common word)
- T A F E R → ""TAFER"" (not a word)

Among these, ""TAPER"", ""TALER"", and ""TAMER"" are all valid.  
We need to pick one.  
Let's choose ""TAPER"" as it's the most common word.
