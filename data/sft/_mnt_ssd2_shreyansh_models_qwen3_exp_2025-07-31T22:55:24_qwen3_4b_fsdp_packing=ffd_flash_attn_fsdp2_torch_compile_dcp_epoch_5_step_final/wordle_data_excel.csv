### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to pick a word with diverse, frequently occurring letters to test multiple possibilities at once.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)

This gives us good coverage of frequently used letters in English. If any of these letters are in the word, we'll get feedback about their positions, which will help narrow down future guesses.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains E, but NOT in the 5th position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E somewhere (positions 1-4 allowed).
2. Avoids A, R, O, S entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and O are out).

A strong second guess would use these remaining common letters while ensuring E is in a new position. Let's try ""UNTIE"":
- U, N, T, I, E – none of A, R, O, S.
- E is in position 4, giving us new placement info.

This tests:
- E in a new spot (position 4).
- New letters U, N, T, I to gather more clues.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to pick a word with diverse, frequently occurring letters to test multiple possibilities at once.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)

This gives us good coverage of frequently used letters in English. If any of these letters are in the word, we'll get feedback about their positions, which will help narrow down future guesses.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains E, but NOT in the 5th position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E somewhere (positions 1-4 allowed).
2. Avoids A, R, O, S entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and O are out).

A strong second guess would use these remaining common letters while ensuring E is in a new position. Let's try ""UNTIE"":
- U, N, T, I, E – none of A, R, O, S.
- E is in position 4, giving us new placement info.

This tests:
- E in a new spot (position 4).
- New letters U, N, T, I to gather more clues.

Let’s update what we know after guess 4:

Letters ruled out completely:  
A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, H, P, Y.

Letters still in play:  
B, C, D, E, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z.

From the feedback on leecy:
- L is in the word but not in position 1 (-).
- E is in the word but not in positions 2, 3, or 4 (-).
- C is in the word but not in position 4 (-).
- Y is not in the word (x).

We already know:
- E is in the word and appears exactly twice (from guess 3: E in position 4 was ✓, so E is in position 4).
- C is in the word but not in position 1 or 4.

So the word must:
- Have E in position 4.
- Have one more E somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3.
- Have C somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5 (since it cannot be in 1 or 4).
- Use only letters from the still-allowed set.

Possible patterns:
- E _ C _ E  (but E is in position 4, so this can’t be)
- C _ E _ E  (E in 3 and 4, but E is only allowed once in 4, so invalid)
- _ C E _ E  (E in 3 and 4, but E is only allowed once in 4, so invalid)
- _ E C _ E  (E in 2 and 4, but E is only allowed once in 4, so invalid)
- _ E _ C E  (E in 2 and 4, but E is only allowed once in 4, so invalid)
- _ _ E C E  (E in 3 and 4, but E is only allowed once in 4, so invalid)
- C _ _ E _  (E in 4, C in 1 – but C can’t be in 1)
- _ C _ E _  (E in 4, C in 2)
- _ _ C E _  (E in 4, C in 3)

So the only valid patterns are:
- _ C _ E _  (C in 2)
- _ _ C E _  (C in 3)

But we also know there must be another E somewhere, and E is already in position 4. Therefore, the second E must be in position 1, 2, or 3, but not conflicting with C placement.

Let’s list possible words:

1. _ C E E _  – but E is only allowed once in 4, so invalid
2. C _ E E _  – invalid
3. _ C E _ E  – invalid
4. _ E C _ E  – invalid
5. _ E _ C E  – invalid
6. C E _ _ E  – invalid

Actually, since E is in position 4 and must appear once more, the only remaining positions for the second E are 1, 2, or 3. But we also know C must be in 2, 3, or 5.

Let’s try:
- Position 1: E
- Position 2: C
- Position 3: some consonant
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- Position 5: some consonant

This gives: E C _ E _

Possible consonants left: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Looking for real 5-letter words:
- E C K E L  – but L is allowed (not yet ruled out), but L was in guess 4 and was marked “in word but wrong position” (L(-)), so L is in the word but not in position 1. This word places L in position 5, which is allowed.
- E C K E D  – D is allowed
- E C K E R  – R is ruled out
- E C K E L  seems valid

Let’s check:
- E C K E L
  - E in 1 (new position for E)
  - C in 2 (allowed)
  - K in 3 (allowed)
  - E in 4 (fixed)
  - L in 5 (allowed, and L is in the word but not in 1)

This seems to fit all constraints.

- Have one more E somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3.
- Have C somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5 (since it cannot be in 1 or 4).
- Use only letters from the still-allowed set.

Possible patterns:
- E _ C _ E  (but E is in position 4, so this can’t be)
- C _ E _ E  (E in 3 and 4, but E is only allowed once in 4, so invalid)
- _ C E _ E  (E in 3 and 4, but E is only allowed once in 4, so invalid)
- _ E C _ E  (E in 2 and 4, but E is only allowed once in 4, so invalid)
- _ E _ C E  (E in 2 and 4, but E is only allowed once in 4, so invalid)
- _ _ E C E  (E in 3 and 4, but E is only allowed once in 4, so invalid)
- C _ _ E _  (E in 4, C in 1 – but C can’t be in 1)
- _ C _ E _  (E in 4, C in 2)
- _ _ C E _  (E in 4, C in 3)

So the only valid patterns are:
- _ C _ E _  (C in 2)
- _ _ C E _  (C in 3)

But we also know there must be another E somewhere, and E is already in position 4. Therefore, the second E must be in position 1, 2, or 3, but not conflicting with C placement.

Let’s list possible words:

1. _ C E E _  – but E is only allowed once in 4, so invalid
2. C _ E E _  – invalid
3. _ C E _ E  – invalid
4. _ E C _ E  – invalid
5. _ E _ C E  – invalid
6. C E _ _ E  – invalid

Actually, since E is in position 4 and must appear once more, the only remaining positions for the second E are 1, 2, or 3. But we also know C must be in 2, 3, or 5.

Let’s try:
- Position 1: E
- Position 2: C
- Position 3: some consonant
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- Position 5: some consonant

This gives: E C _ E _

Possible consonants left: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Looking for real 5-letter words:
- E C K E L  – but L is allowed (not yet ruled out), but L was in guess 4 and was marked “in word but wrong position” (L(-)), so L is in the word but not in position 1. This word places L in position 5, which is allowed.
- E C K E D  – D is allowed
- E C K E R  – R is ruled out
- E C K E L  seems valid

Let’s check:
- E C K E L
  - E in 1 (new position for E)
  - C in 2 (allowed)
  - K in 3 (allowed)
  - E in 4 (fixed)
  - L in 5 (allowed, and L is in the word but not in 1)

This seems to fit all constraints.",Guess 5: eckel -> FEEDBACK: E(✓) C(-) K(x) E(✓) L(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to pick a word with diverse, frequently occurring letters to test multiple possibilities at once.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)

This gives us good coverage of frequently used letters in English. If any of these letters are in the word, we'll get feedback about their positions, which will help narrow down future guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains E, but NOT in the 5th position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E somewhere (positions 1-4 allowed).
2. Avoids A, R, O, S entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and O are out).

A strong second guess would use these remaining common letters while ensuring E is in a new position. Let's try ""UNTIE"":
- U, N, T, I, E – none of A, R, O, S.
- E is in position 4, giving us new placement info.

This tests:
- E in a new spot (position 4).
- New letters U, N, T, I to gather more clues.

Guess 2: untie -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(x) I(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I.
2. Letter E is in the word but NOT in positions 4 or 5 (it was wrong in both positions 5 and 4).
3. Remaining common letters that haven’t been ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, plus the vowels we haven’t tested yet (only E is confirmed so far).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains E (but not in position 4 or 5, so positions 1, 2, or 3).
- Uses only the still-allowed letters.
- Uses other common consonants to maximize new information.

A good candidate is “CHEEP”:
- Letters: C, H, E, E, P – none of the banned letters.
- E appears in position 3 (new position to test).
- Tests C, H, P, which are common and haven’t been used yet.

Guess 3: cheep -> FEEDBACK: C(-) H(x) E(-) E(✓) P(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s consolidate what we now know:

1. Letters ruled out completely: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, H, P.
2. Letters still in play: B, C, D, E, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   - E is confirmed in the word and appears exactly twice (positions 4 and 5 in guess 3, where it showed ✓ for position 5 and - for position 4).  
   - C is in the word but not in position 1.
3. Word structure:
   - Must contain the letters C and E (with E appearing twice).
   - E cannot be in position 4 or 5 (from guesses 1 and 2), so the two E’s must occupy positions 1, 2, 3, and one of them must be in position 4 or 5.  
     However, from guess 3, E is in position 4 (✓) and position 5 (-).  
     This implies the word has E in position 4 and one more E somewhere else (positions 1, 2, or 3).

4. Remaining unused common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has the pattern _ _ _ E _ (E in position 4).
- Has one more E in positions 1, 2, or 3.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.
- Uses common consonants to maximize information.

Candidate: C L E E V
- Letters: C, L, E, E, V – all allowed.
- E is in position 4 (✓) and position 3 (new position).
- C is in position 1 (but we know C is in the word but not in position 1, so this would conflict).  
  Therefore, C must be in positions 2, 3, or 5.

Next candidate: D E E L Y
- Letters: D, E, E, L, Y – all allowed.
- E is in positions 2 and 3 (new positions).
- No C, so this doesn’t test C.

Next candidate: C L E V E
- Letters: C, L, E, V, E – all allowed.
- E is in positions 3 and 5.
- C is in position 1 (but we know C is not in position 1 from guess 3 feedback).

Next candidate: L E E C Y
- Letters: L, E, E, C, Y – all allowed.
- E is in positions 2 and 3 (new positions).
- C is in position 4 (new position).

This seems valid:
- Contains C (position 4, which hasn’t been tested yet).
- Contains two E’s (positions 2 and 3).
- All letters are still allowed.

Therefore, the next guess is LEECY.

<|im_end|>

Let’s update what we know after guess 4:

Letters ruled out completely:  
A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, H, P, Y.

Letters still in play:  
B, C, D, E, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z.

From the feedback on leecy:
- L is in the word but not in position 1 (-).
- E is in the word but not in positions 2, 3, or 4 (-).
- C is in the word but not in position 4 (-).
- Y is not in the word (x).

We already know:
- E is in the word and appears exactly twice (from guess 3: E in position 4 was ✓, so E is in position 4).
- C is in the word but not in position 1 or 4.

So the word must:
- Have E in position 4.
- Have one more E somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3.
- Have C somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5 (since it cannot be in 1 or 4).
- Use only letters from the still-allowed set.

Possible patterns:
- E _ C _ E  (but E is in position 4, so this can’t be)
- C _ E _ E  (E in 3 and 4, but E is only allowed once in 4, so invalid)
- _ C E _ E  (E in 3 and 4, but E is only allowed once in 4, so invalid)
- _ E C _ E  (E in 2 and 4, but E is only allowed once in 4, so invalid)
- _ E _ C E  (E in 2 and 4, but E is only allowed once in 4, so invalid)
- _ _ E C E  (E in 3 and 4, but E is only allowed once in 4, so invalid)
- C _ _ E _  (E in 4, C in 1 – but C can’t be in 1)
- _ C _ E _  (E in 4, C in 2)
- _ _ C E _  (E in 4, C in 3)

So the only valid patterns are:
- _ C _ E _  (C in 2)
- _ _ C E _  (C in 3)

But we also know there must be another E somewhere, and E is already in position 4. Therefore, the second E must be in position 1, 2, or 3, but not conflicting with C placement.

Let’s list possible words:

1. _ C E E _  – but E is only allowed once in 4, so invalid
2. C _ E E _  – invalid
3. _ C E _ E  – invalid
4. _ E C _ E  – invalid
5. _ E _ C E  – invalid
6. C E _ _ E  – invalid

Actually, since E is in position 4 and must appear once more, the only remaining positions for the second E are 1, 2, or 3. But we also know C must be in 2, 3, or 5.

Let’s try:
- Position 1: E
- Position 2: C
- Position 3: some consonant
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- Position 5: some consonant

This gives: E C _ E _

Possible consonants left: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Looking for real 5-letter words:
- E C K E L  – but L is allowed (not yet ruled out), but L was in guess 4 and was marked “in word but wrong position” (L(-)), so L is in the word but not in position 1. This word places L in position 5, which is allowed.
- E C K E D  – D is allowed
- E C K E R  – R is ruled out
- E C K E L  seems valid

Let’s check:
- E C K E L
  - E in 1 (new position for E)
  - C in 2 (allowed)
  - K in 3 (allowed)
  - E in 4 (fixed)
  - L in 5 (allowed, and L is in the word but not in 1)

This seems to fit all constraints.

2. C is in the word but not in position 2 (-) – so C must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
3. K is not in the word (x) – so we can eliminate K.
4. E is in position 4 (✓) – so the word has E in positions 1 and 4.
5. L is in the word and in position 5 (✓) – so the word ends with L.

So far we know the pattern:
E _ _ E L

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, J, M, Q, V, W, X, Z (since A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, H, P, Y, K are ruled out).

We also know C must appear somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (since it can't be in 1 or 2 and position 4 is already E). But position 4 is E, so C must be in position 3.

Thus the word must be:
E _ C E L

Now we just need a consonant for position 2 from the remaining allowed set. Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, J, M, V, W, etc.

Looking for real 5-letter words matching E _ C E L:
- E B C E L – not a word
- E D C E L – not a word
- E F C E L – not a word
- E G C E L – not a word
- E M C E L – not a word
- E V C E L – not a word
- E W C E L – not a word
- E B C E L – not a word

Wait, let me double-check. Maybe I missed a common word. The only common word that fits E _ C E L is ""E C C E L"", but that would require two C's, and we only know one C exists (from guess 3 and 4).

Hmm, let me reconsider the pattern. We have:

- E _ _ E L
- C must be in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 4 (from previous feedback). Position 4 is E, so C must be in position 3.
- Therefore the word must be E _ C E L.

Looking up real words: ""E B C E L"" – no, ""E D C E L"" – no, ""E M C E L"" – no, ""E V C E L"" – no, ""E W C E L"" – no.

Wait, the only remaining consonant that forms a valid word is ""E V C E L"" – but that's not a word. Let me check if I missed any.

Wait, ""E C C E L"" is actually a valid word (short for ""cell"" in some contexts, but it's not in standard Scrabble lists). However, we only know one C exists.

Wait, let me check again. The only possible consonant left that forms a valid word is ""E D C E L"" – but that's not a word. Maybe ""E M C E L"" – no.

Wait, I think I need to reconsider. The only possible word that fits E _ C E L is ""E C C E L"", but we only know one C exists. This suggests I might have made an error.

Let me re-examine the feedback:

From guess 5 (ECKEL):
- E(✓) – position 1
- C(-) – not position 2
- K(x) – not in word
- E(✓) – position 4
- L(✓) – position 5

So the word is E _ _ E L, with C somewhere in positions 3 or 4. But position 4 is E, so C must be in position 3.

Thus the word must be E _ C E L.

Looking up, the only valid word is ""E C C E L"" (though it's obscure), but since we know C is in the word once, this would require two C's, which isn't indicated.

Wait, let me check if there's another possibility. Maybe C is in position 5? But position 5 is L.

No, position 5 is L, so C must be in position 3.

This suggests the word is E _ C E L, and the only possible consonant left is ""D"" to make ""E D C E L"" – but that's not a word.

Wait, let me check if ""E V C E L"" is a word. No, it's not.

This seems like a dead end. Let me re-examine the constraints.

Wait, from guess 3 (CHEEP):
- C(-) – C is in the word but not in position 1.

From guess 4 (LEECY):
- C(-) – C is in the word but not in position 4.

So C can be in positions 2, 3, or 5.

From guess 5 (ECKEL):
- C(-) – not position 2.

Thus C must be in position 3 or 5.

But position 5 is L, so C must be in position 3.

Therefore the word is E _ C E L.

The only possible consonant left is ""D"", making ""E D C E L"" – but that's not a word.

Wait, let me check if ""E V C E L"" is a word. No.

This suggests I might have missed a consonant. Let me list remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, J, M, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Looking for valid words:
- E B C E L – no
- E D C E L – no
- E F C E L – no
- E G C E L – no
- E J C E L – no
- E M C E L – no
- E V C E L – no
- E W C E L – no
- E X C E L – yes! This is a valid word.

Wait, ""E X C E L"" – but position 4 is E, so positions are E X C E L. That fits:
- E in 1 (✓)
- X in 2 (new)
- C in 3 (must be here)
- E in 4 (✓)
- L in 5 (✓)

This is a valid word and fits all constraints.

The word must start with E, end with L, have E in position 4, and contain C in position 3. The only valid word fitting these constraints is ""excel"".
