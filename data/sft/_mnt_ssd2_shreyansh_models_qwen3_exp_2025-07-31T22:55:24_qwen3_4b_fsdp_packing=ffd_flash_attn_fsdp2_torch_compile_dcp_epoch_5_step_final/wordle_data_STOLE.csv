### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N, etc. A good starting word should have a mix of these letters to quickly identify which ones are in the secret word.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of frequently used letters in English words, helping us narrow down possibilities efficiently.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 → secret word starts with S.
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (it’s not in position 2).
- A is not in the word at all.
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (it’s not in position 4).
- E is correct in position 5 → secret word ends with E.

So we know:
1. Pattern so far: S _ _ _ E
2. Letters we still need to place: L and T (and possibly others not yet ruled out)
3. We have ruled out A.

We also know that L is not in position 2 and T is not in position 4.

Good next steps:
- Try to place L and T in new positions.
- Use common remaining consonants (R, N, C, etc.) and vowels (I, O, U).

A strong candidate is “STOLE”:
- S is already fixed in position 1.
- T is in position 2 (new position for T).
- O is a common vowel not yet tested.
- L is in position 4 (new position for L).
- E is fixed in position 5.

This tests two new letters (O and L) in new positions while keeping S and E fixed.
