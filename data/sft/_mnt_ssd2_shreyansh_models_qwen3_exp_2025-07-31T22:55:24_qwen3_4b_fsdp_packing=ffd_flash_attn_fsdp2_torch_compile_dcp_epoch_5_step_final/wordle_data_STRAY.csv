For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AROSE,"" or ""ADIEU."" 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should give me good information about the presence of these letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all

So far we know:
- Letters present: A, R, S
- Letters absent: O, E
- Positions to avoid for these letters: A≠1, R≠2, S≠4

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, R, S (each at least once)
2. Does NOT contain O or E
3. Avoids placing A in position 1, R in position 2, S in position 4

Good candidates might be:
- STARS → but S is repeated and we don’t know if S can repeat
- RASPY → but Y is untested and we don’t know if it’s present
- CRASH → C is untested, but H is untested
- SARGE → G is untested

I’ll choose CRASH because:
- It contains C (untested), R (must be present), A (must be present), S (must be present), H (untested)
- Avoids O and E
- Places R in position 2 (but feedback said R is NOT in position 2, so this is bad)

Oops, CRASH puts R in position 2, which is forbidden by the feedback (R(-) means R is not in position 2). So CRASH is invalid.

Next candidate: STARS
- S in position 1 (allowed, since S(-) only forbids position 4)
- T is new

- R in position 3 (allowed, since R(-) only forbids position 2)

Letters absent: O, E
Positions fixed:
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: T
Letters still unknown: positions 3, 4, 5
Constraints:
- A must appear somewhere but not in position 3
- R must appear somewhere but not in position 4
- We have no information about letters in positions 3, 4, 5 except that they must be chosen from the remaining unused letters (no O or E)

Possible letters left (common ones): N, L, I, C, H, U, M, D, G, B, F, K, P, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with ST and contains A and R exactly once each (since we have no evidence of duplicates yet), with A not in position 3 and R not in position 4.

Possible patterns:
S T _ A _  (but A can't be in position 3, so this is invalid)
S T _ _ A  (A in position 5 is allowed)
S T A _ _  (A in position 3 is invalid)
S T _ R _  (R in position 4 is invalid)
S T _ _ R  (R in position 5 is allowed)

So the only valid patterns are:
1. ST _ _ A
2. ST _ _ R

Looking for common words:
- ST _ _ A: STAND, STARE, STARK, STAMP, STASH, STARS (but STARS was already tried)
- ST _ _ R: STICK, STIRR, STIRR (invalid), STURK, etc.

STAND: contains A in position 4 (allowed) and D in position 5 (new letter)
STARE: contains A in position 4 (allowed) and E is absent (invalid)
STARK: contains A in position 4 (allowed) and K in position 5 (new letter)
STAMP: contains A in position 4 (allowed) and M in position 5 (new letter)

STAND and STARK both fit the constraints:
- S T A N D
- S T A R K

I'll choose STARK because it's a common word and places R in position 4 (but wait, feedback said R is not in position 4). Oops, STARK has R in position 4, which is invalid.

Next: STAND
- S T A N D
- A is in position 3 (invalid, feedback says A is not in position 3)

Hmm, both STARK and STAND have issues. Let me reconsider.

We need:
- S T _ _ _
- Contains A and R
- A not in position 3
- R not in position 4

Possible positions:
- A could be in 4 or 5
- R could be in 3 or 5 (but not 4)

Let's list possible combinations:
1. S T A _ _ → A in 3 (invalid)
2. S T _ A _ → A in 4 (valid)
3. S T _ _ A → A in 5 (valid)
4. S T _ R _ → R in 4 (invalid)
5. S T _ _ R → R in 5 (valid)

So valid patterns:
- S T _ A _
- S T _ _ A
- S T _ _ R

Looking for words:
- S T _ A _:
  - STAND (but A is in 4, N in 3, D in 5) → STAND has A in 4 (valid)
  - STALK (but L in 3, K in 5)
  - STAMP (but M in 3, P in 5)

- S T _ _ A:
  - STICK (but I in 3, C in 4, K in 5)
  - STICK has C in 4 (new letter)
  - STAMP has M in 3, P in 5

- S T _ _ R:
  - STICK (but ends in K, not R)
  - STICK has I in 3, C in 4
  - STURK (but U in 3, R in 4 (invalid))
  - STURK has R in 4 (invalid)

Looking back, STAND seems the best fit:
- S T A N D
- A is in position 4 (valid, not position 3)
- R is not in the word yet, but we know R must appear somewhere. Wait, STAND doesn't contain R. This is a problem.

We need a word that starts with ST, contains A and R, with A not in position 3 and R not in position 4.

Possible word: STIRR (but has R twice, and R in 4 is invalid)
STICK: contains I, C, K but no R
STARK: contains R in 4 (invalid)
STAND: contains A in 4, no R (invalid)
STAMP: contains A in 4, no R (invalid)

Wait, we must include R somewhere. Let me think differently.

We have:
- S T _ _ _
- Must contain A and R
- A not in position 3
- R not in position 4

Possible positions for A: 4 or 5
Possible positions for R: 3 or 5

Let's try:
- A in 4, R in 3: S T R A _
  - STRAP (but P in 5)
  - STRAW (but W in 5)
  - STRAP: S T R A P → A in 4 (valid), R in 3 (valid), P new
  - STRAW: S T R A W → W new

- A in 5, R in 3: S T R _ A
  - STRAY (but Y in 4)
  - STRAY: S T R A Y → A in 5 (valid), R in 3 (valid), Y new

- A in 5, R in 4 (invalid)
- A in 4, R in 5: S T _ A R
  - STAIR: S T A I R → A in 4 (valid), I new, R in 5 (valid)
  - STAIR: contains A in 4 (valid), R in 5 (valid), I new

STAIR seems valid:
- S T A I R
- A in 4 (valid)
- R in 5 (valid)
- Contains both A and R
- New letters: I

This looks good.

- R could be in 3 or 5 (but not 4)

Let's list possible combinations:
1. S T A _ _ → A in 3 (invalid)
2. S T _ A _ → A in 4 (valid)
3. S T _ _ A → A in 5 (valid)
4. S T _ R _ → R in 4 (invalid)
5. S T _ _ R → R in 5 (valid)

So valid patterns:
- S T _ A _
- S T _ _ A
- S T _ _ R

Looking for words:
- S T _ A _:
  - STAND (but A is in 4, N in 3, D in 5) → STAND has A in 4 (valid)
  - STALK (but L in 3, K in 5)
  - STAMP (but M in 3, P in 5)

- S T _ _ A:
  - STICK (but I in 3, C in 4, K in 5)
  - STICK has C in 4 (new letter)
  - STAMP has M in 3, P in 5

- S T _ _ R:
  - STICK (but ends in K, not R)
  - STICK has I in 3, C in 4
  - STURK (but U in 3, R in 4 (invalid))
  - STURK has R in 4 (invalid)

Looking back, STAND seems the best fit:
- S T A N D
- A is in position 4 (valid, not position 3)
- R is not in the word yet, but we know R must appear somewhere. Wait, STAND doesn't contain R. This is a problem.

We need a word that starts with ST, contains A and R, with A not in position 3 and R not in position 4.

Possible word: STIRR (but has R twice, and R in 4 is invalid)
STICK: contains I, C, K but no R
STARK: contains R in 4 (invalid)
STAND: contains A in 4, no R (invalid)
STAMP: contains A in 4, no R (invalid)

Wait, we must include R somewhere. Let me think differently.

We have:
- S T _ _ _
- Must contain A and R
- A not in position 3
- R not in position 4

Possible positions for A: 4 or 5
Possible positions for R: 3 or 5

Let's try:
- A in 4, R in 3: S T R A _
  - STRAP (but P in 5)
  - STRAW (but W in 5)
  - STRAP: S T R A P → A in 4 (valid), R in 3 (valid), P new
  - STRAW: S T R A W → W new

- A in 5, R in 3: S T R _ A
  - STRAY (but Y in 4)
  - STRAY: S T R A Y → A in 5 (valid), R in 3 (valid), Y new

- A in 5, R in 4 (invalid)
- A in 4, R in 5: S T _ A R
  - STAIR: S T A I R → A in 4 (valid), I new, R in 5 (valid)
  - STAIR: contains A in 4 (valid), R in 5 (valid), I new

STAIR seems valid:
- S T A I R
- A in 4 (valid)
- R in 5 (valid)
- Contains both A and R
- New letters: I

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AROSE,"" or ""ADIEU."" 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should give me good information about the presence of these letters in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all

So far we know:
- Letters present: A, R, S
- Letters absent: O, E
- Positions to avoid for these letters: A≠1, R≠2, S≠4

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, R, S (each at least once)
2. Does NOT contain O or E
3. Avoids placing A in position 1, R in position 2, S in position 4

Good candidates might be:
- STARS → but S is repeated and we don’t know if S can repeat
- RASPY → but Y is untested and we don’t know if it’s present
- CRASH → C is untested, but H is untested
- SARGE → G is untested

I’ll choose CRASH because:
- It contains C (untested), R (must be present), A (must be present), S (must be present), H (untested)
- Avoids O and E
- Places R in position 2 (but feedback said R is NOT in position 2, so this is bad)

Oops, CRASH puts R in position 2, which is forbidden by the feedback (R(-) means R is not in position 2). So CRASH is invalid.

Next candidate: STARS
- S in position 1 (allowed, since S(-) only forbids position 4)
- T is new
- A in position 2 (allowed, since A(-) only forbids position 1)
- R in position 3 (allowed, since R(-) only forbids position 2)
- S in position 5 (allowed, since S(-) only forbids position 4)

This seems valid. I’ll go with STARS.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STARS -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) A(-) R(-) S(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on STARS:
- S(✓) → S is in the word and in position 1
- T(✓) → T is in the word and in position 2
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 3
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 4
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 5 (but we already know S is in position 1, so this is redundant)

So far we know:
Letters present: S, T, A, R
Letters absent: O, E
Positions fixed:
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: T
Letters still unknown: positions 3, 4, 5
Constraints:
- A must appear somewhere but not in position 3
- R must appear somewhere but not in position 4
- We have no information about letters in positions 3, 4, 5 except that they must be chosen from the remaining unused letters (no O or E)

Possible letters left (common ones): N, L, I, C, H, U, M, D, G, B, F, K, P, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with ST and contains A and R exactly once each (since we have no evidence of duplicates yet), with A not in position 3 and R not in position 4.

Possible patterns:
S T _ A _  (but A can't be in position 3, so this is invalid)
S T _ _ A  (A in position 5 is allowed)
S T A _ _  (A in position 3 is invalid)
S T _ R _  (R in position 4 is invalid)
S T _ _ R  (R in position 5 is allowed)

So the only valid patterns are:
1. ST _ _ A
2. ST _ _ R

Looking for common words:
- ST _ _ A: STAND, STARE, STARK, STAMP, STASH, STARS (but STARS was already tried)
- ST _ _ R: STICK, STIRR, STIRR (invalid), STURK, etc.

STAND: contains A in position 4 (allowed) and D in position 5 (new letter)
STARE: contains A in position 4 (allowed) and E is absent (invalid)
STARK: contains A in position 4 (allowed) and K in position 5 (new letter)
STAMP: contains A in position 4 (allowed) and M in position 5 (new letter)

STAND and STARK both fit the constraints:
- S T A N D
- S T A R K

I'll choose STARK because it's a common word and places R in position 4 (but wait, feedback said R is not in position 4). Oops, STARK has R in position 4, which is invalid.

Next: STAND
- S T A N D
- A is in position 3 (invalid, feedback says A is not in position 3)

Hmm, both STARK and STAND have issues. Let me reconsider.

We need:
- S T _ _ _
- Contains A and R
- A not in position 3
- R not in position 4

Possible positions:
- A could be in 4 or 5
- R could be in 3 or 5 (but not 4)

Let's list possible combinations:
1. S T A _ _ → A in 3 (invalid)
2. S T _ A _ → A in 4 (valid)
3. S T _ _ A → A in 5 (valid)
4. S T _ R _ → R in 4 (invalid)
5. S T _ _ R → R in 5 (valid)

So valid patterns:
- S T _ A _
- S T _ _ A
- S T _ _ R

Looking for words:
- S T _ A _:
  - STAND (but A is in 4, N in 3, D in 5) → STAND has A in 4 (valid)
  - STALK (but L in 3, K in 5)
  - STAMP (but M in 3, P in 5)

- S T _ _ A:
  - STICK (but I in 3, C in 4, K in 5)
  - STICK has C in 4 (new letter)
  - STAMP has M in 3, P in 5

- S T _ _ R:
  - STICK (but ends in K, not R)
  - STICK has I in 3, C in 4
  - STURK (but U in 3, R in 4 (invalid))
  - STURK has R in 4 (invalid)

From all feedback so far:

Known facts
1. Letters in the word: S, T, A, R
2. Letters NOT in the word: O, E, I
3. Fixed positions:
   - Position 1 = S
   - Position 2 = T
4. Forbidden positions:
   - A ≠ 3, 4, 5 (because it was marked “-” in positions 3 and 4 and we still haven’t placed it in 5)
   - R ≠ 4, 5 (because it was marked “-” in positions 4 and 5 and we still haven’t placed it in 3)
   - Therefore A must be in position 2, but position 2 is already T. This is impossible.

Wait — let’s re-examine the feedback more carefully.

Feedback on STAIR:
- S(✓)  → S is correct in position 1
- T(✓)  → T is correct in position 2
- A(-)  → A is in the word but NOT in position 3
- I(x)  → I is NOT in the word
- R(-)  → R is in the word but NOT in position 5

So the word is S T _ _ _ with:
- Must contain A and R
- A cannot be in position 3
- R cannot be in position 5
- Cannot contain O, E, I

Possible positions for A: 4 or 5 (since 1,2 are S,T)
Possible positions for R: 3 or 4 (since 1,2 are S,T and 5 is forbidden)

Let’s enumerate the valid placements:

Case 1: A in position 4
Then the word is S T _ A _
R must be in position 3 (only remaining slot)
So the word is S T R A _

We need a letter for position 5 that is NOT O,E,I
Common consonants left: N, L, C, H, M, D, G, B, F, K, P, Y, etc.

Possible words:
- STRAN (but STRAN is not a common word)
- STRAY (but Y is allowed, STRAY is valid)
- STRAP (P allowed)
- STRAM (not common)
- STRAD (not common)

STRAY seems the most common word here.

Case 2: A in position 5
Then the word is S T _ _ A
R must be in position 3 or 4
- If R in 3: S T R _ A → STR_ A → STRGA (invalid), STRPA (invalid), STRMA (invalid), etc. No common words
- If R in 4: S T _ R A → ST_ R A → STGR A (invalid), STPR A (invalid), etc. No common words

Thus the only viable word is STRAY.

But wait — STRAY contains Y, which hasn’t been ruled out yet. Since we have no information against Y, and it’s a valid English word, STRAY is the only logical next guess.

Case 1: A in position 4
Then the word is S T _ A _
R must be in position 3 (only remaining slot)
So the word is S T R A _

We need a letter for position 5 that is NOT O,E,I
Common consonants left: N, L, C, H, M, D, G, B, F, K, P, Y, etc.

Possible words:
- STRAN (but STRAN is not a common word)
- STRAY (but Y is allowed, STRAY is valid)
- STRAP (P allowed)
- STRAM (not common)
- STRAD (not common)

STRAY seems the most common word here.

Case 2: A in position 5
Then the word is S T _ _ A
R must be in position 3 or 4
- If R in 3: S T R _ A → STR_ A → STRGA (invalid), STRPA (invalid), STRMA (invalid), etc. No common words
- If R in 4: S T _ R A → ST_ R A → STGR A (invalid), STPR A (invalid), etc. No common words

Thus the only viable word is STRAY.

But wait — STRAY contains Y, which hasn’t been ruled out yet. Since we have no information against Y, and it’s a valid English word, STRAY is the only logical next guess.",Guess 4: STRAY -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) R(✓) A(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
