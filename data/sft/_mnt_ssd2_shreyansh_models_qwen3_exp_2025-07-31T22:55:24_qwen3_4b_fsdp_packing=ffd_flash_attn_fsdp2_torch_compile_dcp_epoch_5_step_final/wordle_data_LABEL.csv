For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination covers a good spread of frequent letters and positions, giving us maximum information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

- A: - → A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T: x → T is not in the word at all.
- E: - → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, T
- Letters that ARE in the word: L, A, E (each somewhere other than their original positions)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains L, A, E
2. Does NOT contain S or T
3. Places L, A, E in new positions (not 2, 3, 5 respectively)

Good consonants to try next: R, N, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, O, U (but we already have E)

Let’s try a word that rearranges L, A, E and adds two new consonants. A common pattern is to use R and N.

Candidate word: ""REALM""
Check:
- Letters: R, E, A, L, M
- Contains L, A, E (positions 4, 3, 2 respectively)
- No S or T
- New positions for known letters: L was in 2 → now 4; A was in 3 → now 3 (but feedback said A is not in 3, so this is bad)
Oops, A is still in position 3, which is invalid.

- Letters: E, L, D, E, R
- Contains L, A? No A → invalid
Next candidate: ""LEARN""

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination covers a good spread of frequent letters and positions, giving us maximum information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: x → S is not in the word at all.
- L: - → L is in the word but not in position 2.
- A: - → A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T: x → T is not in the word at all.
- E: - → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, T
- Letters that ARE in the word: L, A, E (each somewhere other than their original positions)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains L, A, E
2. Does NOT contain S or T
3. Places L, A, E in new positions (not 2, 3, 5 respectively)

Good consonants to try next: R, N, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, O, U (but we already have E)

Let’s try a word that rearranges L, A, E and adds two new consonants. A common pattern is to use R and N.

Candidate word: ""REALM""
Check:
- Letters: R, E, A, L, M
- Contains L, A, E (positions 4, 3, 2 respectively)
- No S or T
- New positions for known letters: L was in 2 → now 4; A was in 3 → now 3 (but feedback said A is not in 3, so this is bad)
Oops, A is still in position 3, which is invalid.

Next candidate: ""CLEAR""
Check:
- Letters: C, L, E, A, R
- Contains L, A, E (positions 2, 4, 3 respectively)
- No S or T
- New positions for known letters: L was in 2 → now 2 (invalid, same position)
Next candidate: ""ELDER""
Check:
- Letters: E, L, D, E, R
- Contains L, A? No A → invalid
Next candidate: ""LEARN""
Check:
- Letters: L, E, A, R, N
- Contains L, A, E (positions 1, 2, 3 respectively)
- No S or T
- New positions for known letters: L was in 2 → now 1 (valid), A was in 3 → now 3 (invalid)
Next candidate: ""REALE"" – not a valid word
Next candidate: ""ELARA"" – not a valid word
Next candidate: ""EARLY""
Check:
- Letters: E, A, R, L, Y
- Contains L, A, E (positions 4, 2, 1 respectively)
- No S or T
- New positions for known letters: L was in 2 → now 4 (valid), A was in 3 → now 2 (valid), E was in 5 → now 1 (valid)

- E is in position 5 (valid, since E was in 5 before but feedback said E is not in 5, so this is bad)

Next candidate: ""LENA"" + one more letter → ""LENA"" is 4 letters; need 5. ""LENA"" + consonant: ""LENCH"" – but H is possible, but let's think better.

""PALE"" is 4 letters; need 5. ""PALE"" + consonant: ""PALED"" – D is allowed, let's check:
- P, A, L, E, D
- A in 2 ✓
- E in 4 (was in 5 before, so 4 is new)
- L in 3 (was in 2 and 4 before, 3 is new)
- No S, T, R, Y
- D is allowed
""PALED"" is a valid word.

Let me verify positions:
- Position 1: P (new)
- Position 2: A (fixed)
- Position 3: L (was in 2 and 4 before, now 3 is new)
- Position 4: E (was in 5 before, now 4 is new)
- Position 5: D (new)

Current known facts:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, T, R, Y, P, D
- Letters that ARE in the word and their fixed positions:
  - A is fixed in position 2
  - E is fixed in position 4
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: L (cannot be in 2, 4, or 5)
- Positions left to fill: 1, 3, 5
- L must go in one of these positions, and must be in 1 or 3 (since 5 is excluded by feedback)
- We need two more consonants (since A and E are already placed, and L must be placed)

Let's list possible placements:
- Position 1: could be L or another consonant
- Position 3: could be L or another consonant
- Position 5: must be a consonant (since E is already in 4 and L is not allowed here)

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2
- Has E in position 4
- Contains L in position 1 or 3
- Uses only allowed letters (no S, T, R, Y, P, D)

Let's try possible combinations:
1. L in position 1:
   - Word pattern: L _ A _ E
   - Need a consonant for position 3
   - Possible consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, V, W, etc.
   - Example: L _ A _ E → ""LANCE"" (but C is allowed, N is allowed)
   - Check: L, A, N, C, E
   - A is in 2 ✓, E is in 4 ✓, L is in 1 (valid), N and C are new
   - ""LANCE"" is a valid word.

2. L in position 3:
   - Word pattern: _ _ A L E
   - Need a consonant for position 1 and 5
   - Example: ""BLAME"" (B and M are allowed)
   - Check: B, L, A, M, E
   - A is in 2 ✓, E is in 4 ✓, L is in 3 (valid), B and M are new
   - ""BLAME"" is a valid word.

Between these two, ""BLAME"" seems simpler and uses more common letters (B, L, A, M, E).

Let's choose ""BLAME"".

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination covers a good spread of frequent letters and positions, giving us maximum information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: x → S is not in the word at all.
- L: - → L is in the word but not in position 2.
- A: - → A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T: x → T is not in the word at all.
- E: - → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, T
- Letters that ARE in the word: L, A, E (each somewhere other than their original positions)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains L, A, E
2. Does NOT contain S or T
3. Places L, A, E in new positions (not 2, 3, 5 respectively)

Good consonants to try next: R, N, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, O, U (but we already have E)

Let’s try a word that rearranges L, A, E and adds two new consonants. A common pattern is to use R and N.

Candidate word: ""REALM""
Check:
- Letters: R, E, A, L, M
- Contains L, A, E (positions 4, 3, 2 respectively)
- No S or T
- New positions for known letters: L was in 2 → now 4; A was in 3 → now 3 (but feedback said A is not in 3, so this is bad)
Oops, A is still in position 3, which is invalid.

Next candidate: ""CLEAR""
Check:
- Letters: C, L, E, A, R
- Contains L, A, E (positions 2, 4, 3 respectively)
- No S or T
- New positions for known letters: L was in 2 → now 2 (invalid, same position)
Next candidate: ""ELDER""
Check:
- Letters: E, L, D, E, R
- Contains L, A? No A → invalid
Next candidate: ""LEARN""
Check:
- Letters: L, E, A, R, N
- Contains L, A, E (positions 1, 2, 3 respectively)
- No S or T
- New positions for known letters: L was in 2 → now 1 (valid), A was in 3 → now 3 (invalid)
Next candidate: ""REALE"" – not a valid word
Next candidate: ""ELARA"" – not a valid word
Next candidate: ""EARLY""
Check:
- Letters: E, A, R, L, Y
- Contains L, A, E (positions 4, 2, 1 respectively)
- No S or T
- New positions for known letters: L was in 2 → now 4 (valid), A was in 3 → now 2 (valid), E was in 5 → now 1 (valid)
This seems valid.

- A: ✓ → A is in the word and in position 2.
- R: x → R is not in the word.
- L: - → L is in the word but not in position 4.
- Y: x → Y is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, T, R, Y
- Letters that ARE in the word: A (position 2), E (somewhere except 1), L (somewhere except 2 or 4)

Positions:
- Position 2: A (fixed)
- Positions 1, 3, 4, 5: still unknown, but must contain E and L plus two new consonants.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A in position 2.
2. Contains E and L somewhere else (not 1, not 4 for E; not 2 or 4 for L).
3. Does not contain S, T, R, Y.
4. Uses other common consonants like N, C, D, M, P, etc.

Possible consonants left: N, C, D, M, P, G, H, B, F, K, etc.

Let’s try to place E and L in valid positions:
- E could be in 3, 4, or 5 (but not 1).
- L could be in 1, 3, or 5 (but not 2 or 4).

A good candidate is ""PLANE"":
- P, L, A, N, E
- A is in position 2 ✓
- L is in position 1 (valid, since L was in 2 and 4 before)
- E is in position 5 (valid, since E was in 5 before but feedback said E is not in 5, so this is bad)

Next candidate: ""LENA"" + one more letter → ""LENA"" is 4 letters; need 5. ""LENA"" + consonant: ""LENCH"" – but H is possible, but let's think better.

""PALE"" is 4 letters; need 5. ""PALE"" + consonant: ""PALED"" – D is allowed, let's check:
- P, A, L, E, D
- A in 2 ✓
- E in 4 (was in 5 before, so 4 is new)
- L in 3 (was in 2 and 4 before, 3 is new)
- No S, T, R, Y
- D is allowed
""PALED"" is a valid word.

Let me verify positions:
- Position 1: P (new)
- Position 2: A (fixed)
- Position 3: L (was in 2 and 4 before, now 3 is new)
- Position 4: E (was in 5 before, now 4 is new)
- Position 5: D (new)

   - Need a consonant for position 1 and 5
   - Example: ""BLAME"" (B and M are allowed)
   - Check: B, L, A, M, E
   - A is in 2 ✓, E is in 4 ✓, L is in 3 (valid), B and M are new
   - ""BLAME"" is a valid word.

Between these two, ""BLAME"" seems simpler and uses more common letters (B, L, A, M, E).

Let's choose ""BLAME"".

Current known facts:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, T, R, Y, P, D, M
- Letters that ARE in the word and their fixed positions:
  - A is fixed in position 2
  - E is fixed in position 4
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: L (cannot be in 2, 4, 5)
- Positions left to fill: 1, 3, 5
- L must go in one of these positions, and must be in 1 or 3 (since 5 is excluded by feedback)
- We need two more consonants (since A and E are already placed, and L must be placed)

Let's list possible placements:
1. L in position 1:
   - Word pattern: L _ A _ E
   - Need a consonant for position 3
   - Possible consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, K, N, V, W

   - A is in 2 ✓, E is in 4 ✓, L is in 3 (valid), C and V are new
   - ""CLAVE"" is a valid word.

Between these two, ""CLAVE"" uses C and V, both still allowed, and fits all constraints.
