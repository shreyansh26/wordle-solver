For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. 

Looking at common English letters, the most frequent are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A word that uses several of these is ""AROSE"". This gives me a good spread of high-frequency letters to start narrowing down possibilities.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E.
- DOES contain O, but not in the 3rd position (since O was in position 3 and got “-”).

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains O, but not in position 3.
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E.

Good letters to use next: common consonants not yet ruled out (T, N, L, C, D, G, H, M, P, etc.) and vowels other than O (but we already know O is in the word, so maybe another vowel like I or U).

A strong candidate is “POINT”:
- Uses P, O, I, N, T (all new letters except O).
- O is in position 2 (not 3), satisfying the feedback.
- No A, R, S, E.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. 

Looking at common English letters, the most frequent are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A word that uses several of these is ""AROSE"". This gives me a good spread of high-frequency letters to start narrowing down possibilities.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E.
- DOES contain O, but not in the 3rd position (since O was in position 3 and got “-”).

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains O, but not in position 3.
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E.

Good letters to use next: common consonants not yet ruled out (T, N, L, C, D, G, H, M, P, etc.) and vowels other than O (but we already know O is in the word, so maybe another vowel like I or U).

A strong candidate is “POINT”:
- Uses P, O, I, N, T (all new letters except O).
- O is in position 2 (not 3), satisfying the feedback.
- No A, R, S, E.

Let’s try POINT.

From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   – Letters ruled out: A, R, S, E  
   – O is in the word but NOT in position 3.

2. POINT → P(✓) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)  
   – P and O are in the word and in the correct positions (P1, O2).  
   – I, N, T are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Word starts with P, has O in position 2: P O _ _ _
- Letters still allowed: any except A, R, S, E, I, N, T  
- Remaining positions (3, 4, 5) must be filled from the unused letters.

Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, V, W, Y  
Good remaining vowels: U (since A, E, I are out and O is already used)

A simple candidate is “POUCH”:
- P O U C H  
- Uses new letters U, C, H (none of which are ruled out).  
- Keeps P and O in their correct spots.

Next: “POKY_” – but we need two letters.  
A valid word: “POKED” – but E and D are out.  
Another: “POLLY” – L is allowed, but L is allowed and L is allowed again (no duplicates yet).  
But L is allowed, and we have P O _ _ Y.

Let’s try “POLLY”:

- P O L L Y  
- L is allowed (not ruled out), and no other letters are out.  
- This is a valid English word.

Let’s go with POLLY.

We now know:

- Pattern: P O _ _ Y  (positions 1, 2, 5 locked)
- Letters ruled out so far: A, R, S, E, I, N, T, U, C, H, D, G, L  
- Still allowed letters (from the alphabet minus the above): B, F, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  

We need two more letters for positions 3 and 4, both from the still-allowed set.  
Common remaining consonants: B, F, J, K, M, V, W, X, Z  

A valid English word that fits P O _ _ Y and uses only allowed letters is “POKEY” (but K and E – E is out).  
Next: “POKY_” – but we need two letters.  
Another: “POXED” – but E and D are out.  
Another: “POVY_” – but V is allowed, but we need two letters.  

Let’s list valid 5-letter words that start with PO and end with Y, using only allowed letters:

- POBLY – not a word.  
- POKEY – K is allowed, but E is out.  
- POKED – D and E are out.  
- POXED – D and E are out.  
- POVY_ – V is allowed, but we need two letters.  
- POLLY – already tried, L is out.  

Wait, let’s think differently: the allowed letters are B, F, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.  
We need two letters for positions 3 and 4.  

Possible combinations:

- P O B _ Y → need a letter for position 4.  
- P O F _ Y → need a letter for position 4.  
- P O K _ Y → need a letter for position 4.  
- P O M _ Y → need a letter for position 4.  
- P O V _ Y → need a letter for position 4.  
- P O W _ Y → need a letter for position 4.  
- P O X _ Y → need a letter for position 4.  
- P O Z _ Y → need a letter for position 4.  

Looking for valid words:

- P O B _ Y → “POBLY” – not a word.  
- P O F _ Y → “POFY_” – not a word.  
- P O K _ Y → “POKEY” – but E is out.  
- P O M _ Y → “POMMY” – M is allowed, but M is allowed again.  
- P O V _ Y → “POVY_” – not a word.  
- P O W _ Y → “POWY_” – not a word.  
- P O X _ Y → “POXY_” – X is allowed, but we need two letters.  
- P O Z _ Y → “POZY_” – not a word.  

Wait, let’s try “POKED” – but D and E are out.  
Another: “POXED” – D and E are out.  
Another: “POVY_” – not a word.  

Let’s try “POKEY” – but E is out.  

Let me think of valid words that start with PO and end with Y, using only the allowed letters.  

Possible valid word: “POKED” – but D and E are out.  
Another: “POXED” – D and E are out.  
Another: “POVY_” – not a word.  
Another: “POZED” – Z and E are out.  

Let me list all valid 5-letter words starting with PO and ending with Y, using only letters not yet ruled out (B, F, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z).  

Looking up, the only common word is “POKEY” (but E is out).  
Another: “POKED” – E and D are out.  
Another: “POXED” – E and D are out.  

Wait, let me think of other combinations:  

- P O B _ Y → “POBLY” – not a word.  
- P O F _ Y → “POFY_” – not a word.  
- P O K _ Y → “POKEY” – E is out.  
- P O M _ Y → “POMMY” – M is allowed, but M is allowed again.  
- P O V _ Y → “POVY_” – not a word.  
- P O W _ Y → “POWY_” – not a word.  
- P O X _ Y → “POXY_” – X is allowed, but we need two letters.  
- P O Z _ Y → “POZY_” – not a word.  

Let me try “POMMY” – M is allowed, and we have P O _ _ Y.  
But M is allowed and we have P O M M Y – but we only need two letters.  

Wait, “POMMY” is P O M M Y – positions 3 and 4 are M and M.  
Letters used: P, O, M, M, Y.  
All letters are allowed (M is allowed, Y is allowed).  

Let me check:  
- P: allowed (already in position 1).  
- O: allowed (already in position 2).  
- M: allowed (not ruled out).  
- M: allowed (not ruled out).  
- Y: allowed (already in position 5).  

This seems valid.  

Another possibility: “POKED” – but D and E are out.  

Thus, the next guess is “POMMY”.
