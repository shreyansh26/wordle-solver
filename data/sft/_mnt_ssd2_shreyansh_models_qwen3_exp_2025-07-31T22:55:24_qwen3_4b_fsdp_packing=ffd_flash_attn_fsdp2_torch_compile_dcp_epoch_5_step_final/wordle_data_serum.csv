For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these letters to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

One of the most recommended starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of letters to work with and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities early on.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the correct first position (✓).
- L, A, T are not in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position (-).

So we know:
- Word starts with S.
- Contains E somewhere, but not at the end.
- Does NOT contain L, A, T.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Starts with S
2. Contains E in positions 2-4
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no L, A, T)

Good candidate letters to try next: R, N, I, O, U, C, H, M, P, etc.

Let’s pick a word that uses common remaining letters and places E in the second or third position. A good choice is “SERUM”:
- Starts with S
- Contains E in position 2
- Uses R, U, M (all still possible)
- No L, A, T
