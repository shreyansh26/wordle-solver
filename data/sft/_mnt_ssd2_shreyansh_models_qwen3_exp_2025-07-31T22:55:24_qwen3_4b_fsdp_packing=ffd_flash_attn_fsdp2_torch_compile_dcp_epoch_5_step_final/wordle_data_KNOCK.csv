### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. 

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (has S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (has C, R, A, N, E)
- CRISP (has C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (has A, D, I, E, U)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.

2. Use only untested letters for the remaining two positions  
3. Use common, high-frequency letters to maximize information  

Let’s look for a word that contains C, N, K plus two new letters.  
Possible candidates:
- “COCKY” – but Y is eliminated  
- “CHINK” – but I is eliminated  
- “KINCH” – but I and H are untested, but we already have N and K confirmed  
- “CONCH” – uses C, O, N, C, H (O and H are new)  

“CONCH” satisfies all constraints:
- Contains confirmed letters C, N, K (wait, no K here).  
Oops, we need to include K.  
Let’s try “KINCH”:
- K, I, N, C, H  
- I is eliminated, so this is invalid.  

Next try “KNOCK”:
- K, N, O, C, K  
- Uses confirmed letters K, N, C and new letters O.  

This seems perfect:
- Contains K, N, C (all confirmed)  
- Uses O (new vowel)  
- Uses K again to test if K appears twice (though we don’t know yet)  

So the next guess is CONCH, but it doesn’t have K.  
Let’s try “KNOCK” instead.

<guess>KNOCK</guess>",KNOCK,"So far we have:

Letters eliminated (x):  
S, L, A, T, E, R, I, M, P, B, U, Y  

Letters confirmed present (but position unknown):  
C, N, K  

We still need to test the remaining common consonants and vowels:  
Consonants: D, F, G, H, J, Q, V, W, X, Z  
Vowels: O  

We have three confirmed letters (C, N, K) and two unknown positions.  
A good next guess should:
1. Include all three confirmed letters (C, N, K)  
2. Use only untested letters for the remaining two positions  
3. Use common, high-frequency letters to maximize information
