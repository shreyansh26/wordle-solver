### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. A good first guess should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible

A classic strong first guess is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel in English)

This combination tests 5 distinct letters that appear frequently in English words, giving us good coverage for the next steps.

From the new feedback on MARLI:

- M(x) → M is not in the word.

- Letters that are in the word but in the wrong positions: I (cannot be in pos 5)
- Letters that are NOT in the word: S, T, E, F, N, K, M, R

We still need to place:

- The remaining positions (1, 3, 5) must be filled with letters we have not ruled out.

Available letters (common ones not yet ruled out): B, C, D, G, H, J, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a word pattern: _ A _ L _ with I somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 5 (but 5 is ruled out for I), so I must be in position 1 or 3.

Let’s try:
- Position 1: I → I A _ L _
- Position 3: _ A I L _

Looking for common words:
- I A _ L _: ""I A _ L _"" – not many common words.
- _ A I L _: ""B A I L Y"" – ""BAILY"" is a valid surname.
- ""PAILO"" – invalid.
- ""DAILE"" – invalid.
- ""CAILY"" – invalid.

""BAILY"" fits the pattern _ A I L _ with I in position 3 (allowed), and uses B and Y which are still possible.

Check if any letters are ruled out:
- B, Y: not yet ruled out.

So ""BAILY"" is a good next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. A good first guess should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible

A classic strong first guess is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel in English)

This combination tests 5 distinct letters that appear frequently in English words, giving us good coverage for the next steps.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word (x)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- T is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word contains L and A, but not S, T, or E.
- L is not in position 2 and A is not in position 3.
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep L and A in different positions
2. Introduce new common letters (R, N, I, O, etc.)
3. Avoid S, T, E

One strong candidate is ""FLANK"":
- F, N, K are new common letters
- L moves to position 2 (originally 2 was wrong, so 2 is now allowed)
- A moves to position 4 (originally 3 was wrong, so 4 is allowed)

From the two previous guesses we know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: S, T, E, F, N, K
2. Letters that ARE in the word but are in the wrong positions:
   - L (cannot be in position 2)
   - A (cannot be in position 3)
3. We still need to test other common consonants and vowels.

Remaining common consonants: R, D, G, H, M, P, B, C, etc.
Remaining common vowels: I, O, U (A is already known to be present, but not in position 3).

We need a word that:
- Contains L and A, but in different positions than before.
- Uses only letters we haven’t ruled out.
- Tests new common letters.

A good candidate is ""GRAIL"":
- G, R, I are new common letters.
- L is moved to position 4 (was 2 before).
- A is moved to position 3 (was 3 before, but feedback said A is in wrong position, so this is invalid).

Next candidate: ""CLAMP"":
- C, M, P are new common letters.
- L is in position 2 (was 2 before, so invalid).

Next candidate: ""BLAIR"":
- B, R, I are new common letters.
- L is in position 2 (invalid).

Next candidate: ""PLAID"":
- P, I, D are new common letters.
- L is in position 2 (invalid).

Next candidate: ""MARLI"":
- M, R, I, L are new letters (but L is in position 4, which is allowed).
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since A was only ruled out of position 3).

""MARLI"" is a valid 5-letter word meaning a type of fish, and it tests M, R, I while placing L and A in new positions.
