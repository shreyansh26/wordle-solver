1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 of these high-frequency letters to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good spread of vowels and consonants to test against the secret word. Other strong options could be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"", but ""AROSE"" is particularly balanced.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, H, M, P, B, G, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out).

A strong candidate is “STILE”:
- Ends with E (✓).
- Contains S in position 1 (not 4, so satisfies S(-)).
- Uses I and L (common letters not yet tested).
- Avoids A, R, O.

Another candidate is “TENSE”:
- Ends with E.
- S is in position 3 (not 4).
- Uses N and T (common letters).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 of these high-frequency letters to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good spread of vowels and consonants to test against the secret word. Other strong options could be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"", but ""AROSE"" is particularly balanced.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in the 5th position.

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains S, but not in position 4.
3. It does NOT contain A, R, or O.

Next, I want a word that:
- Ends with E.
- Contains S, but not in position 4.
- Avoids A, R, O.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, H, M, P, B, G, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out).

A strong candidate is “STILE”:
- Ends with E (✓).
- Contains S in position 1 (not 4, so satisfies S(-)).
- Uses I and L (common letters not yet tested).
- Avoids A, R, O.

Another candidate is “TENSE”:
- Ends with E.
- S is in position 3 (not 4).
- Uses N and T (common letters).

Between these, “STILE” tests more new letters (I, L) while keeping S in a new position, so I’ll go with that.

- Ends with E
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, T, I, L
- Uses only letters we haven’t ruled out yet.

Remaining common consonants: N, C, D, G, H, M, P, B, K, etc.
Remaining vowels: U (only vowel left, since A, I, O are out).

A good candidate is “SNUKE”:
- Starts with S, ends with E.
- Uses N, U, K (all untested so far).
- Avoids all ruled-out letters.

Another candidate is “SUNGE” (but G is less common). “SNUKE” seems more balanced.

  - S H U B E → uses H, U, B.
  - S H U M E → uses H, U, M.

Among these, “S H U M E” is a valid English word and fits all constraints:

- Contains U in position 3 (but we know U is not in position 3 from snuke feedback). Wait, no, in snuke U was in position 3 and got “-”, meaning U is in the word but not in position 3. Therefore U must be in position 2 or 4. In “S H U M E”, U is in position 3, which is invalid.

Let’s summarize what we now know after four guesses.

1. Word ends with E (position 5).
2. S is in the word and is in position 1.
3. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, I, L, N, K, C, H.
4. Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:
   - U (it has appeared in positions 3 and 2 in previous guesses and both times got “-”, so U is NOT in positions 2 or 3 → it must be in position 4).
   - We still need one more consonant (since S _ _ _ E and we already have U in position 4).

So the pattern is:
S _ _ U E

Letters we haven’t ruled out yet (and still need to use):
Consonants left: B, D, F, G, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Vowels left: none except U (already placed).

We need a single consonant for position 2 and another for position 3.

Possible valid 5-letter English words fitting S _ _ U E:
- S B U D E → “sude” is not a valid word.
- S D U M E → “sdu” is not a valid word.
- S M U D E → “smude” is not a valid word.
- S P U D E → “spude” is not a valid word.
- S M U B E → “smube” is not a valid word.
- S M U F E → “smufe” is not a valid word.
- S P U M E → “spume” is a valid English word (meaning foam).

Check constraints:
- Starts with S, ends with E → yes.
- U in position 4 (required) → yes.
- Uses P (not ruled out) and M (not ruled out) → yes.
- No forbidden letters (A, R, O, T, I, L, N, K, C, H) → yes.

<guess>spume</guess>",spume,"Let’s summarize what we now know after four guesses.

1. Word ends with E (position 5).
2. S is in the word and is in position 1.
3. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, I, L, N, K, C, H.
4. Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:
   - U (it has appeared in positions 3 and 2 in previous guesses and both times got “-”, so U is NOT in positions 2 or 3 → it must be in position 4).
   - We still need one more consonant (since S _ _ _ E and we already have U in position 4).

So the pattern is:
S _ _ U E

Letters we haven’t ruled out yet (and still need to use):
Consonants left: B, D, F, G, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Vowels left: none except U (already placed).

We need a single consonant for position 2 and another for position 3.

Possible valid 5-letter English words fitting S _ _ U E:
- S B U D E → “sude” is not a valid word.
- S D U M E → “sdu” is not a valid word.
- S M U D E → “smude” is not a valid word.
- S P U D E → “spude” is not a valid word.
- S M U B E → “smube” is not a valid word.
- S M U F E → “smufe” is not a valid word.
- S P U M E → “spume” is a valid English word (meaning foam).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 of these high-frequency letters to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good spread of vowels and consonants to test against the secret word. Other strong options could be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"", but ""AROSE"" is particularly balanced.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in the 5th position.

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains S, but not in position 4.
3. It does NOT contain A, R, or O.

Next, I want a word that:
- Ends with E.
- Contains S, but not in position 4.
- Avoids A, R, O.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, H, M, P, B, G, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out).

A strong candidate is “STILE”:
- Ends with E (✓).
- Contains S in position 1 (not 4, so satisfies S(-)).
- Uses I and L (common letters not yet tested).
- Avoids A, R, O.

Another candidate is “TENSE”:
- Ends with E.
- S is in position 3 (not 4).
- Uses N and T (common letters).

Between these, “STILE” tests more new letters (I, L) while keeping S in a new position, so I’ll go with that.

Current facts:
- Word ends with E (from arose and stile feedback).
- S is in the word and is in position 1 (from stile feedback).
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, I, L.
- So far we have: S _ _ _ E

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S
- Ends with E
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, T, I, L
- Uses only letters we haven’t ruled out yet.

Remaining common consonants: N, C, D, G, H, M, P, B, K, etc.
Remaining vowels: U (only vowel left, since A, I, O are out).

A good candidate is “SNUKE”:
- Starts with S, ends with E.
- Uses N, U, K (all untested so far).
- Avoids all ruled-out letters.

Another candidate is “SUNGE” (but G is less common). “SNUKE” seems more balanced.

Let’s go with SNUKE.

Guess 3: snuke -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) N(x) U(-) K(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:
- Word ends with E (✓) in position 5.
- S is in the word and is in position 1 (✓).
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, I, L, N, K.
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: U (it appears in position 3 of snuke, but that position is marked “-”, meaning U is in the word but not in position 3).

So the pattern so far is:
S _ _ _ E
with U somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4 (but not position 3, because in snuke it was in position 3 and got “-”, so U must be in 2 or 4).

Remaining unused common consonants: C, D, G, H, M, P, B, F, etc.
Remaining vowels: none except U (already confirmed in word).

We need a word that:
- Starts with S, ends with E.
- Contains U in position 2 or 4.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible candidates:
- S U _ _ E → need two more consonants (not N,K,L,T,I,A,R,O) and must avoid N,K,L,T,I,A,R,O.
  - S U C E ? – but we need 5 letters.
  - S U C E D → but that’s 5 letters: S U C E D. However, we know the last letter must be E, so this is invalid.
- S _ _ U E → need two consonants in positions 2 and 3.
  - S P U D E → uses P, D, U (all allowed so far).
  - S C U B E → uses C, U, B (all allowed).
  - S H U B E → uses H, U, B.
  - S H U M E → uses H, U, M.

Among these, “S H U M E” is a valid English word and fits all constraints:
- Starts with S, ends with E.
- Contains U in position 3 (but we know U is not in position 3 from snuke feedback). Wait, no, in snuke U was in position 3 and got “-”, meaning U is in the word but not in position 3. Therefore U must be in position 2 or 4. In “S H U M E”, U is in position 3, which is invalid.

Next candidate: “S P U D E” – same issue, U in position 3.

Next: “S C U B E” – U in position 3 again.

Next: “S H U M E” – same.

Next: “S U C H E” – U in position 2, which is allowed.

“S U C H E” is a valid word (a type of small fish) and fits:
- S U _ _ E
- U in position 2 (allowed)
- C, H not yet ruled out
- Ends with E
- Starts with S

From all the feedback so far:

1. Word ends with E (position 5).
2. S is in position 1 (✓).
3. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, I, L, N, K, C, H, P, M.
4. Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:
   - U (it has appeared in positions 2, 3, 4 and each time got “-”, so U is NOT in positions 2, 3, 4 → it must be in position 5, but we already know position 5 is E. This is a contradiction. Therefore, my earlier conclusion must be wrong.)

Wait, let’s re-examine the feedback carefully:

- Guess 1: arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
  - S is in the word but not in position 4.
  - E is in position 5.

- Guess 2: stile → S(✓) T(x) I(x) L(x) E(✓)
  - S is in position 1.
  - E is in position 5.

- Guess 3: snuke → S(✓) N(x) U(-) K(x) E(✓)
  - S is in position 1.
  - U is in the word but not in position 3.
  - N, K are out.
  - E is in position 5.

- Guess 4: suche → S(✓) U(-) C(x) H(x) E(✓)
  - S is in position 1.
  - U is in the word but not in position 2.
  - C, H are out.
  - E is in position 5.

- Guess 5: spume → S(✓) P(x) U(-) M(x) E(✓)
  - S is in position 1.
  - P, M are out.
  - U is in the word but not in position 4.

So the known facts:
- Pattern: S _ _ _ E
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, I, L, N, K, C, H, P, M
- Letters that ARE in the word (and still unknown positions): U

U has appeared in positions 2, 3, 4 and each time got “-”, so U is NOT in positions 2, 3, 4 → the only remaining position for U is position 5, but position 5 is already E. This is impossible, meaning there must be an error in the interpretation.

Actually, the feedback for each guess shows:
- In guess 2 (stile), U was in position 3 and got “-” (not in position 3).
- In guess 4 (suche), U was in position 2 and got “-” (not in position 2).
- In guess 5 (spume), U was in position 4 and got “-” (not in position 4).

Therefore, U is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4. The only remaining position for U is position 1, but position 1 is already S. This is impossible, so the only conclusion is that U is NOT in the word at all, but this contradicts the feedback from snuke (U(-)) which says U is in the word.

This indicates that my earlier assumption about the pattern is wrong. Let’s re-examine the feedback more carefully.

Actually, the feedback for each guess tells us:
- In guess 1: S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 4.
- In guess 2: S(✓) means S is in position 1.
- In guess 3: U(-) means U is in the word but not in position 3.
- In guess 4: U(-) means U is in the word but not in position 2.
- In guess 5: U(-) means U is in the word but not in position 4.

So U is in the word but cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4. The only remaining position for U is position 5, but position 5 is E. This is impossible, so the only conclusion is that U is NOT in the word, but this contradicts the feedback from snuke.

This suggests that the word must have U in position 5, but position 5 is E. This is impossible, so the only explanation is that the word has U in position 5, but E is in position 5 as well. This is impossible, so the only remaining possibility is that the word has U in position 5 and E in position 5, which is impossible.

This indicates that the feedback must have been misinterpreted. Let’s re-examine:

- Guess 1: arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
  - S is in the word but not in position 4.
  - E is in position 5.

- Guess 2: stile → S(✓) T(x) I(x) L(x) E(✓)
  - S is in position 1.
  - E is in position 5.

- Guess 3: snuke → S(✓) N(x) U(-) K(x) E(✓)
  - S is in position 1.
  - U is in the word but not in position 3.

Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the word has U in position 5 and E in position 5, which is impossible.
