### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that will give me maximum information about the letters in the secret word. A good starting word should include common vowels and consonants to quickly narrow down possibilities.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)

This combination helps test multiple high-frequency letters at once, giving good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on “arose” we have:

- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains R and E somewhere, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, O, or S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses R and E (and possibly other letters we haven’t tested yet).
2. Avoids A, O, S.
3. Places R and E in new positions.

Good consonants to test next: T, N, L, D, C, M, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, U (since A, O, E are partially confirmed).

A balanced word that satisfies these constraints is “TREND”:
- T, N, D are new consonants.
- R is now in position 1 (new from position 2).
- E is now in position 3 (new from position 5).

This should give us more information about the remaining letters.

From the three guesses we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S, T, N, D, F, I  
Letters that ARE in the word and their confirmed positions:
- R is in position 3 (✓)
- Y is in position 5 (✓)

Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: E  
(From guess 1 and 2, E was in the word but not in positions 5 and 3 respectively.)

So the pattern so far is: _ _ R _ Y  
We need to fill positions 1, 2, and 4 with letters that:
- Are not A, O, S, T, N, D, F, I  
- Include E somewhere (it must be in position 1 or 2 or 4, but position 4 is still open)

Available letters left: B, C, E, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y (but Y is already used in position 5)

Let’s test E in position 1 and 2 with common consonants.  
A word like “BERRY” would repeat R, but we already know R is fixed in position 3.  
A better choice is “CERBY” – but B is allowed and Y is already used.  
Actually, “CERBY” is invalid since Y is already used once.  
Let’s try “MERRY” – repeats R and Y, but Y is already in position 5.  
Better: “HERBY” – but H is allowed.  
But H and B are allowed, and E must be placed.

Wait, the pattern is _ _ R _ Y, and E must be in one of those four slots, but position 3 is R and 5 is Y, so E must be in 1, 2, or 4.  
Let’s try “BERGY” – but G is allowed, but Y is already in position 5.  
Actually, we can’t repeat Y.  
Let’s try “PERKY” – but K is allowed, and E is in position 2.  
But we need to check if P, E, R, K, Y are allowed.  
P is allowed, E is allowed, R is fixed in 3, K is allowed, Y is fixed in 5.  
This seems valid.

But let’s verify:
- Letters used: P, E, R, K, Y
- All letters are allowed (not in the forbidden list: A, O, S, T, N, D, F, I)
- R is in position 3 (✓)
- Y is in position 5 (✓)
- E is in position 2 (new position)

This seems like a good next guess.
