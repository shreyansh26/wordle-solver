### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information I can gain. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters are present or absent. 

Looking at common English letters, the vowels A, E, I, O, U are very frequent, as are consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A word that contains several of these common letters is likely to give useful feedback.

One such word is ""SLATE"":
- S: common consonant
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: common vowel

This covers 5 distinct letters, all of which are quite common in English words. The feedback from this guess should help narrow down the possible letters in the secret word.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x,” so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That immediately eliminates every word that contains any of these letters.  
I now need a 5-letter word that avoids S, L, A, T, E entirely.  
A good next guess should still be a common word with high-frequency letters not yet ruled out.  
The remaining most common letters are R, I, N, O, C, U, M, P, D, G, H, B, F, Y, K, W, V, X, Z, J, Q, X, etc.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

1. Letters **not** in the word: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, N  
2. Letters **in** the word and in the correct positions:  
   – O is in position 3 (third letter)  
   – Y is in position 5 (fifth letter)

So the pattern so far is:  
_ _ O _ Y

The remaining unused common letters (that haven’t been ruled out) include:  
D, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, B, F, J, Q, X, Z.

A good next guess should fit the pattern _ _ O _ Y and use only letters from the allowed set.  
A high-frequency word that fits is “DOUGH” but it has H and U which are still allowed.  
Another option is “FOGGY” but it repeats G.  
“BOGGY” repeats G again.  
“HOIST” has I and S but S is already ruled out.  
“MOIST” has I and S again.  
“POKEY” has K and E but E is ruled out.  
“VOGUE” has G and U but E is ruled out.  
“DOUGH” is still valid: D, O, U, G, H.  
But “DOUGH” uses O and Y in the correct positions, and D, U, G, H are all still allowed.  

Wait, let me double-check:

A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters are present or absent. \n\nLooking at common English letters, the vowels A, E, I, O, U are very frequent, as are consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A word that contains several of these common letters is likely to give useful feedback.\n\nOne such word is ""SLATE"":\n- S: common consonant\n- L: common consonant\n- A: common vowel\n- T: common consonant\n- E: common vowel\n\nThis covers 5 distinct letters, all of which are quite common in English words. The feedback from this guess should help narrow down the possible letters in the secret word.\n\n<guess>SLATE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x,” so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  \nThat immediately eliminates every word that contains any of these letters.  \nI now need a 5-letter word that avoids S, L, A, T, E entirely.  \nA good next guess should still be a common word with high-frequency letters not yet ruled out.  \nThe remaining most common letters are R, I, N, O, C, U, M, P, D, G, H, B, F, Y, K, W, V, X, Z, J, Q, X, etc.  \nA word like “CRONY” uses five of these letters and is a common, valid 5-letter word.\n\n<guess>CRONY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: CRONY -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) O(✓) N(x) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two previous guesses we now know:\n\n1.

From the feedback so far:

1. Letters not in the word: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, N, U, G, H  
2. Letters in the word and in the correct positions:  
   – O is in position 3  
   – Y is in position 5  

3. From DOUGH we also learned:  
   – D is in the word but NOT in position 1 (it’s marked “-”).

So the pattern is:  
_ _ O _ Y  
and D must appear somewhere in positions 2 or 4 (since position 1 is ruled out for D).

Remaining unused common letters (still allowed):  
B, F, I, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Z, etc.

We need a word that fits _ _ O _ Y and contains D in position 2 or 4.

Possible candidates:
- B O D _ Y → “BODGY” (G is ruled out)  
- F O D _ Y → “FODY” (only 4 letters)  
- I O D _ Y → “IODY” (not a word)  
- K O D _ Y → “KODY” (not a word)  
- M O D _ Y → “MODY” (not a word)  
- P O D _ Y → “PODY” (not a word)  
- V O D _ Y → “VODY” (not a word)  
- W O D _ Y → “WODY” (not a word)

Now check position 4:  
- B _ O D Y → “BOODY” (double D, but D is only required once)  
- F _ O D Y → “FOODY” (double D, but D is only required once)  
- I _ O D Y → “IOODY” (not a word)  
- K _ O D Y → “KOODY” (not a word)  
- M _ O D Y → “MOODY” (valid word)  
- P _ O D Y → “POODY” (not a word)  
- V _ O D Y → “VOODY” (not a word)  
- W _ O D Y → “WOODY” (valid word)

Between MOODY and WOODY, both fit the pattern and use allowed letters.  
MOODY uses D in position 4, which is still allowed.  
WOODY also uses D in position 4.

Both are valid, but let’s pick the more common one: MOODY.

Check letters: M, O, O, D, Y  
- M, D, Y are all still allowed.  
- O is in position 3 (✓).  
- Y is in position 5 (✓).  
- D is in position 4 (allowed, since position 1 is ruled out for D).

Therefore, MOODY is a good next guess.
