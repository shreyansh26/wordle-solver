For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, I, O, U, S, T, R, N, L. 

One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives me a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 1).
- L, A, T, E are NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
- The secret word contains an S somewhere, but NOT at the start.
- The letters L, A, T, E are excluded entirely.
- We still have no information about the other letters except that S is present.

To maximize information gain, I should choose a word that:
1. Keeps S in a different position (2, 3, 4, or 5).
2. Uses fresh, common letters not yet tested (like R, N, I, O, U, C, D, etc.).
3. Avoids L, A, T, E.

A good candidate is ""CRISP"":
- C, R, I, P are new letters.
- S is moved to position 3 (not the first position).
- No forbidden letters (L, A, T, E) are used.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, I, O, U, S, T, R, N, L. 

One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives me a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 1).
- L, A, T, E are NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
- The secret word contains an S somewhere, but NOT at the start.
- The letters L, A, T, E are excluded entirely.
- We still have no information about the other letters except that S is present.

To maximize information gain, I should choose a word that:
1. Keeps S in a different position (2, 3, 4, or 5).
2. Uses fresh, common letters not yet tested (like R, N, I, O, U, C, D, etc.).
3. Avoids L, A, T, E.

A good candidate is ""CRISP"":
- C, R, I, P are new letters.
- S is moved to position 3 (not the first position).
- No forbidden letters (L, A, T, E) are used.

K(x)  → K is NOT in the word  
Y(✓)  → Y is in the word AND is in position 5  

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ U _ S Y  (positions 2,4,5 fixed)
- Forbidden letters: L, A, T, E, C, R, I, P, O, N, D, M, K  
- Allowed letters left: B, F, G, H, J, Q, V, W, X, Z (plus U, S, Y already placed)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has the form ? U ? S Y  
- Uses only allowed letters for the remaining positions (1 and 3)

Looking at possible consonants for positions 1 and 3 from the allowed set:
- Position 1: B, F, G, H, J, V, W, X, Z  
- Position 3: B, F, G, H, J, V, W, X, Z  

Quick scan of common English words that fit ? U ? S Y:
- BUSSY (but S is already used in position 4, and double S might be allowed, but let's check if BUSSY is valid)
- FUSKY (K is forbidden)
- GUSLY (not a common word)
- HUSKY (K is forbidden)
- JUSKY (not a word)
- VUSKY (not a word)

Actually, ""BUSSY"" is a valid English word (a nickname or informal term). However, it has two S's, and we already have S in position 4. The word could have S in position 1 as well, but we need to check if that's allowed. Since S is confirmed in position 4 and we haven't ruled out S in position 1, ""BUSSY"" seems possible.

But let's think of another word. ""FUSKY"" is invalid (K), ""HUSKY"" is invalid (K), ""GUSLY"" isn't common. 

Wait, let's try ""BUSSY"" first. It fits the pattern B U S S Y, but we already have S in position 4. The word could have S in position 1, but we haven't ruled that out. However, the feedback for MUSKY only told us S is in position 4, not that it can't appear elsewhere. So ""BUSSY"" would be B U S S Y, with S in positions 1 and 4. This seems acceptable.

But let's look for a word with only one S (position 4) and other allowed letters. 

Looking at the allowed letters again, position 3 could be B, F, G, H, J, V, W, X, Z. 

Possible words:
- BUSSY (as above)
- FUSKY (invalid)
- GUSLY (invalid)
- HUSKY (invalid)
- JUSKY (invalid)
- VUSKY (invalid)

Actually, ""BUSSY"" is the only common word that fits. However, let's check if ""BUSSY"" is allowed. Yes, it's a valid English word.

But wait, let's consider ""BUSSY"" again. It has S in positions 1 and 4. Since we haven't ruled out S in position 1, this is possible. However, we want to test new letters. 

Another approach: position 1 could be B, F, G, H, J, V, W, X, Z. Position 3 must be from the same set. 

Looking for common words:
- B U B S Y → ""BUBSY"" (not a word)
- B U F S Y → ""BUFSY"" (not a word)
- B U G S Y → ""BUGSY"" (not a word)
- B U H S Y → ""BUHSY"" (not a word)
- B U J S Y → ""BUJSY"" (not a word)
- B U V S Y → ""BUVSY"" (not a word)
- B U W S Y → ""BUWSY"" (not a word)
- B U X S Y → ""BUXSY"" (not a word)
- B U Z S Y → ""BUZSY"" (not a word)

Similarly for other starting letters, it's hard to find common words. 

Let's try ""BUSSY"" again. It's the only common word that fits. However, let's check if ""BUSSY"" is allowed. Yes, it's a valid word. 

But let's think differently. Maybe the word is ""BUSSY"" or ""BUSSY"" is the only option. 

Alternatively, let's check if there's another word. 

Actually, ""BUSSY"" is correct. 

But let's verify if ""BUSSY"" is acceptable. Yes, it is. 

However, to be thorough, let's check if there's another word. 

Looking at position 1: B, F, G, H, J, V, W, X, Z  
Position 3: same set  

""BUSSY"" seems to be the only common word. 

Therefore, the next guess is ""BUSSY"".

- Forbidden letters: L, A, T, E, C, R, I, P, O, N, D, M, K  
- Allowed letters left: B, F, G, H, J, Q, V, W, X, Z (plus U, S, Y already placed)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has the form ? U ? S Y  
- Uses only allowed letters for the remaining positions (1 and 3)

Looking at possible consonants for positions 1 and 3 from the allowed set:
- Position 1: B, F, G, H, J, V, W, X, Z  
- Position 3: B, F, G, H, J, V, W, X, Z  

Quick scan of common English words that fit ? U ? S Y:
- BUSSY (but S is already used in position 4, and double S might be allowed, but let's check if BUSSY is valid)
- FUSKY (K is forbidden)
- GUSLY (not a common word)
- HUSKY (K is forbidden)
- JUSKY (not a word)
- VUSKY (not a word)

Actually, ""BUSSY"" is a valid English word (a nickname or informal term). However, it has two S's, and we already have S in position 4. The word could have S in position 1 as well, but we need to check if that's allowed. Since S is confirmed in position 4 and we haven't ruled out S in position 1, ""BUSSY"" seems possible.

But let's think of another word. ""FUSKY"" is invalid (K), ""HUSKY"" is invalid (K), ""GUSLY"" isn't common. 

Wait, let's try ""BUSSY"" first. It fits the pattern B U S S Y, but we already have S in position 4. The word could have S in position 1, but we haven't ruled that out. However, the feedback for MUSKY only told us S is in position 4, not that it can't appear elsewhere. So ""BUSSY"" would be B U S S Y, with S in positions 1 and 4. This seems acceptable.

But let's look for a word with only one S (position 4) and other allowed letters. 

Looking at the allowed letters again, position 3 could be B, F, G, H, J, V, W, X, Z. 

Possible words:
- BUSSY (as above)
- FUSKY (invalid)
- GUSLY (invalid)
- HUSKY (invalid)
- JUSKY (invalid)
- VUSKY (invalid)

Actually, ""BUSSY"" is the only common word that fits. However, let's check if ""BUSSY"" is allowed. Yes, it's a valid English word.

But wait, let's consider ""BUSSY"" again. It has S in positions 1 and 4. Since we haven't ruled out S in position 1, this is possible. However, we want to test new letters. 

Another approach: position 1 could be B, F, G, H, J, V, W, X, Z. Position 3 must be from the same set. 

Looking for common words:
- B U B S Y → ""BUBSY"" (not a word)
- B U F S Y → ""BUFSY"" (not a word)
- B U G S Y → ""BUGSY"" (not a word)
- B U H S Y → ""BUHSY"" (not a word)
- B U J S Y → ""BUJSY"" (not a word)
- B U V S Y → ""BUVSY"" (not a word)
- B U W S Y → ""BUWSY"" (not a word)
- B U X S Y → ""BUXSY"" (not a word)
- B U Z S Y → ""BUZSY"" (not a word)

Similarly for other starting letters, it's hard to find common words. 

Let's try ""BUSSY"" again. It's the only common word that fits. However, let's check if ""BUSSY"" is allowed. Yes, it's a valid word. 

But let's think differently. Maybe the word is ""BUSSY"" or ""BUSSY"" is the only option. 

Alternatively, let's check if there's another word. 

Actually, ""BUSSY"" is correct. 

But let's verify if ""BUSSY"" is acceptable. Yes, it is. 

However, to be thorough, let's check if there's another word. 

Looking at position 1: B, F, G, H, J, V, W, X, Z  
Position 3: same set  

""BUSSY"" seems to be the only common word. 

Therefore, the next guess is ""BUSSY"".",Guess 5: BUSSY -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(✓) S(✓) S(✓) Y(✓),FAIL

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, I, O, U, S, T, R, N, L. 

One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives me a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 1).
- L, A, T, E are NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
- The secret word contains an S somewhere, but NOT at the start.
- The letters L, A, T, E are excluded entirely.
- We still have no information about the other letters except that S is present.

To maximize information gain, I should choose a word that:
1. Keeps S in a different position (2, 3, 4, or 5).
2. Uses fresh, common letters not yet tested (like R, N, I, O, U, C, D, etc.).
3. Avoids L, A, T, E.

A good candidate is ""CRISP"":
- C, R, I, P are new letters.
- S is moved to position 3 (not the first position).
- No forbidden letters (L, A, T, E) are used.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - L, A, T, E are NOT in the word at all.

2. CRISP → C(x) R(x) I(x) S(✓) P(x)
   - S is now confirmed in position 4.
   - C, R, I, P are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Word structure: _ _ _ S _
- Forbidden letters: L, A, T, E, C, R, I, P
- Allowed letters (common ones): B, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, O, U, V, W, Y, etc.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Has S in position 4.
- Uses only allowed letters.
- Introduces as many new common letters as possible.

Candidate words:
- BONUS (B, O, U, S, N)
- MOUNT (M, O, U, N, T) → but T is forbidden.
- GUNSH (G, U, N, S, H) → H is allowed, but GUNSH isn't a common word.
- SOUND (S in position 4) → O, U, N, D are allowed.

SOUND fits perfectly:
- S in position 4 (✓).
- Uses O, U, N, D (all allowed).
- Common word.

Let's digest the latest feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - L, A, T, E are out.

2. CRISP → C(x) R(x) I(x) S(✓) P(x)
   - S is confirmed in position 4.
   - C, R, I, P are out.

3. SOUND → S(-) O(x) U(-) N(x) D(x)
   - S is NOT in position 1 (consistent with earlier feedback).
   - O is NOT in the word.
   - U is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - N and D are NOT in the word.

Summary of what we know:
- Position 4 is S.
- Forbidden letters so far: L, A, T, E, C, R, I, P, O, N, D
- U is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- Allowed letters still available: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus U).

We need a 5-letter word with:
- 4th letter S
- U somewhere (but not 3rd)
- Only letters from the allowed set

Possible positions for U: 1, 2, 4, or 5. But 4 is S, so 1, 2, or 5.

Let's try to construct a word:
- If U is in position 1: U _ _ S _
- If U is in position 2: _ U _ S _
- If U is in position 5: _ _ _ S U

Looking for common words that fit these patterns:
- U _ _ S _: ""USAGE"" (but A is forbidden), ""USERS"" (R is forbidden), ""UNISK"" (not a word)
- _ U _ S _: ""BUCKS"" (B, U, C, K, S) → C is forbidden
- _ _ _ S U: ""MUSKY"" (M, U, S, K, Y) → K and Y are allowed, S is in position 4, U is in position 2 (allowed)

""MUSKY"" seems to fit all constraints:
- 4th letter S
- U in position 2 (allowed)
- Uses M, K, Y (all allowed)
- No forbidden letters

Let's check:
- M: allowed
- U: allowed
- S: confirmed in position 4
- K: allowed
- Y: allowed

This looks good.

This seems acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s look for a word with only one S (position 4) and other allowed letters. \n\nLooking at the allowed letters again, position 3 could be B, F, G, H, J, V, W, X, Z. \n\nPossible words:\n- BUSSY (as above)\n- FUSKY (invalid)\n- GUSLY (invalid)\n- HUSKY (invalid)\n- JUSKY (invalid)\n- VUSKY (invalid)\n\nActually, ""BUSSY"" is the only common word that fits. However, let\'s check if ""BUSSY"" is allowed. Yes, it\'s a valid English word.\n\nBut wait, let\'s consider ""BUSSY"" again. It has S in positions 1 and 4. Since we haven\'t ruled out S in position 1, this is possible. However, we want to test new letters. \n\nAnother approach: position 1 could be B, F, G, H, J, V, W, X, Z. Position 3 must be from the same set. \n\nLooking for common words:\n- B U B S Y → ""BUBSY"" (not a word)\n- B U F S Y → ""BUFSY"" (not a word)\n- B U G S Y → ""BUGSY"" (not a word)\n- B U H S Y → ""BUHSY"" (not a word)\n- B U J S Y → ""BUJSY"" (not a word)\n- B U V S Y → ""BUVSY"" (not a word)\n- B U W S Y → ""BUWSY"" (not a word)\n- B U X S Y → ""BUXSY"" (not a word)\n- B U Z S Y → ""BUZSY"" (not a word)\n\nSimilarly for other starting letters, it\'s hard to find common words. \n\nLet\'s try ""BUSSY"" again. It\'s the only common word that fits. However, let\'s check if ""BUSSY"" is allowed. Yes, it\'s a valid word. \n\nBut let\'s think differently. Maybe the word is ""BUSSY"" or ""BUSSY"" is the only option. \n\nAlternatively, let\'s check if there\'s another word. \n\nActually, ""BUSSY"" is correct. \n\nBut let\'s verify if ""BUSSY"" is acceptable. Yes, it is. \n\nHowever, to be thorough, let\'s check if there\'s another word. \n\nLooking at position 1: B, F, G, H, J, V, W, X, Z  \nPosition 3: same set  \n\n""BUSSY"" seems to be the only common word. \n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""BUSSY"".\n\n<guess>BUSSY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: CRISP -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) I(x) S(✓) P(x)\nGuess 3: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(x) U(-) N(x) D(x)\nGuess 4: MUSKY -> FEEDBACK: M(x) U(✓) S(✓) K(x) Y(✓)\nGuess 5: BUSSY -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(✓) S(✓) S(✓) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
From the latest feedback on BUSSY:

B(x)  → B is NOT in the word  
U(✓)  → U is in the word AND is in position 2  
S(✓)  → S is in the word AND is in position 3  
S(✓)  → S is in the word AND is in position 4  
Y(✓)  → Y is in the word AND is in position 5  

So now we know the exact pattern:

_ U S S Y

Forbidden letters so far (from all previous guesses):
L, A, T, E, C, R, I, P, O, N, D, M, K, B

Allowed letters left for position 1 (only) from the remaining alphabet: F, G, H, J, V, W, X, Z

Looking for common 5-letter English words that fit the pattern ? U S S Y:

- FUSSY (F is allowed, not yet tested)
- GUSSY (not common)
- HUSKY (K is forbidden)
- JUSKY (not a word)
- VUSKY (not a word)
- WUSKY (not a word)
- XUSKY (not a word)
- ZUSKY (not a word)

The only valid common word left is ""FUSSY"".

Let's verify:
- F: allowed
- U: confirmed in position 2
- S: confirmed in positions 3 and 4
- S: confirmed in position 4
- Y: confirmed in position 5

""FUSSY"" fits perfectly.
