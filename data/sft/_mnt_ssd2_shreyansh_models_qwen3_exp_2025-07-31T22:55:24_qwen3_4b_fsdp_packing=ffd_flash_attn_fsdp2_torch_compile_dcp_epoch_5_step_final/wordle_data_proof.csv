For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants like R, S, T, L, N, etc.

Some good first guesses are:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E - very common letters)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U - good for vowels)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) were marked with ""x"", meaning none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates the entire set {S, L, A, T, E}.  
I now need a word that uses none of those letters.

I’ll pick a word that uses common remaining consonants and vowels.  
Good candidates:  
- CRWTH (but W is uncommon)  
- FUROR (but O and R are still possible)  
- GRIOT (but I and O are still possible)  
- PRUNE (but U and N are still possible)  

A balanced choice is “CRWTH” – it uses C, R, W, T, H.  
But T was already ruled out.  
So scratch CRWTH.

Next: “FUROR” – F, U, R, O, R.  
R is repeated, but that’s fine.  
Still uses R and O, but both are still allowed.

Better: “CRONY” – C, R, O, N, Y.  
All letters are new.

Another: “BRINY” – B, R, I, N, Y.  
Also good.

I’ll go with “BRINY” as it introduces B, R, I, N, Y – none of which appeared in SLATE.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants like R, S, T, L, N, etc.

Some good first guesses are:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E - very common letters)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U - good for vowels)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) were marked with ""x"", meaning none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates the entire set {S, L, A, T, E}.  
I now need a word that uses none of those letters.

I’ll pick a word that uses common remaining consonants and vowels.  
Good candidates:  
- CRWTH (but W is uncommon)  
- FUROR (but O and R are still possible)  
- GRIOT (but I and O are still possible)  
- PRUNE (but U and N are still possible)  

A balanced choice is “CRWTH” – it uses C, R, W, T, H.  
But T was already ruled out.  
So scratch CRWTH.

Next: “FUROR” – F, U, R, O, R.  
R is repeated, but that’s fine.  
Still uses R and O, but both are still allowed.

Better: “CRONY” – C, R, O, N, Y.  
All letters are new.

Another: “BRINY” – B, R, I, N, Y.  
Also good.

I’ll go with “BRINY” as it introduces B, R, I, N, Y – none of which appeared in SLATE.

- SLATE → S L A T E all x → none of S, L, A, T, E are in the word.
- BRINY → B R I N Y gives R(✓) and the rest x → R is in the word and in the second position.

So far we know:
- The secret word has R in position 2.
- It contains none of S, L, A, T, E, B, I, N, Y.

Remaining common letters: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with R in position 2 and no forbidden letters.

Let’s brainstorm:
- _ R _ _ _
Forbidden letters: S, L, A, T, E, B, I, N, Y  
Allowed letters: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

Possible first letters: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z  
Possible third, fourth, fifth letters: same set.

A good candidate is “FROCK”:
- F R O C K
- R is in position 2 (✓)
- No forbidden letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants like R, S, T, L, N, etc.

Some good first guesses are:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E - very common letters)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U - good for vowels)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) were marked with ""x"", meaning none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates the entire set {S, L, A, T, E}.  
I now need a word that uses none of those letters.

I’ll pick a word that uses common remaining consonants and vowels.  
Good candidates:  
- CRWTH (but W is uncommon)  
- FUROR (but O and R are still possible)  
- GRIOT (but I and O are still possible)  
- PRUNE (but U and N are still possible)  

A balanced choice is “CRWTH” – it uses C, R, W, T, H.  
But T was already ruled out.  
So scratch CRWTH.

Next: “FUROR” – F, U, R, O, R.  
R is repeated, but that’s fine.  
Still uses R and O, but both are still allowed.

Better: “CRONY” – C, R, O, N, Y.  
All letters are new.

Another: “BRINY” – B, R, I, N, Y.  
Also good.

I’ll go with “BRINY” as it introduces B, R, I, N, Y – none of which appeared in SLATE.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: BRINY -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) I(x) N(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds we have:

- SLATE → S L A T E all x → none of S, L, A, T, E are in the word.
- BRINY → B R I N Y gives R(✓) and the rest x → R is in the word and in the second position.

So far we know:
- The secret word has R in position 2.
- It contains none of S, L, A, T, E, B, I, N, Y.

Remaining common letters: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with R in position 2 and no forbidden letters.

Let’s brainstorm:
- _ R _ _ _
Forbidden letters: S, L, A, T, E, B, I, N, Y  
Allowed letters: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

Possible first letters: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z  
Possible third, fourth, fifth letters: same set.

A good candidate is “FROCK”:
- F R O C K
- R is in position 2 (✓)
- No forbidden letters.

Let’s try FROCK.

Guess 2: BRINY -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) I(x) N(x) Y(x)
Guess 3: FROCK -> FEEDBACK: F(-) R(✓) O(✓) C(x) K(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three rounds we now know:

- Position 2 is R (✓).
- Position 3 is O (✓).
- The letters F and K are not in the word (x).
- The letters S, L, A, T, E, B, I, N, Y, C are also not in the word (from earlier x’s).
- Forbidden letters so far: S, L, A, T, E, B, I, N, Y, C, F, K.

Remaining possible letters: D, G, H, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, plus the already confirmed R and O.

We need a 5-letter word of the form: _ R O _ _  
with no forbidden letters.

Possible first letters: D, G, H, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z  
Possible fourth and fifth letters: same set.

Candidate words:
- DROOP – but P is allowed, but O is already used in position 3, and DROOP uses O twice, which may or may not be allowed.
- GROVE – but V and E; E is forbidden.
- PROUD – but U and D are allowed, but D is allowed, but O is already used in position 3.
- DROVE – E is forbidden.
- GROPE – E is forbidden.
- PROUD – U and D are allowed, but O is already in position 3.
- DROOP – O is allowed in position 3 and 5, but O is already confirmed in position 3.
- GROOP – but P is allowed, but O is allowed in position 5.
- DROOP seems possible.

But let’s check if DROOP has any forbidden letters: D, R, O, O, P – none are forbidden.

Another candidate: DROOP.

But let’s see if there are other options:
- GROOP – but P is allowed, but O is allowed.
- DROOP seems the best.

Wait, let me think again. The word must be _ R O _ _ with no forbidden letters.

Possible first letters: D, G, H, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Possible fourth and fifth letters: same set.

Candidate words:
- DROOP – D R O O P
- GROOP – G R O O P
- PROUD – P R O U D
- DROVE – invalid (E)
- GROVE – invalid (E)
- PROUD – P R O U D
- DROOP – seems valid.

Between DROOP and PROUD:
- DROOP: D, R, O, O, P – all allowed.
- PROUD: P, R, O, U, D – all allowed.

Both are valid. Let’s pick PROUD because it uses more unique letters and is more common.

But let me check PROUD:
- P R O U D – positions 2=R, 3=O, others P, U, D – none forbidden.

Yes, PROUD is valid.

Let’s go with PROUD.

We have four rounds of feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ No S, L, A, T, E anywhere.

2. BRINY → B(x) R(✓) I(x) N(x) Y(x)  
   ⇒ R is in position 2.

3. FROCK → F(-) R(✓) O(✓) C(x) K(x)  
   ⇒ R is in position 2 (confirmed), O is in position 3, and F is somewhere in the word (but not in position 1).

4. PROUD → P(✓) R(✓) O(✓) U(x) D(x)  
   ⇒ P is in position 1, R is in position 2, O is in position 3.  
   ⇒ U and D are not in the word.

So the pattern so far is: P R O _ _

Letters already ruled out: S, L, A, T, E, B, I, N, Y, C, F, U, D.

Remaining possible letters for positions 4 and 5: G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with PRO and uses only allowed letters for positions 4 and 5.

Possible candidates:
- PROXY – but Y is ruled out.
- PROK – too short.
- PROGM – too long.
- PROHM – too long.
- PROVK – too long.
- PROW – too short.
- PROG – too short.
- PROGZ – too long.
- PROHZ – too long.
- PROKZ – too long.

Looking for common 5-letter words that start with PRO and use only allowed letters:
- PROXY – invalid (Y).
- PROWL – L is ruled out.
- PROWL – invalid.
- PROWL – invalid.
- PROWL – invalid.
- PROWL – invalid.
- PROWL – invalid.
- PROWL – invalid.

Wait, let me think differently. The word must be P R O _ _.  
Possible fourth letters: G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z.  
Possible fifth letters: same.

Possible words:
- PROGH – not a word.
- PROGK – not a word.
- PROGM – not a word.
- PROGZ – not a word.
- PROHZ – not a word.
- PROKZ – not a word.

Actually, the only common word that fits is PROXY, but Y is ruled out.  
Next possible: PROWL – L is ruled out.  
PROWL – invalid.

Wait, let me re-examine the allowed letters for positions 4 and 5.  
From the feedback, we know:
- F is in the word but not in position 1 (from FROCK: F(-)).
- P, R, O are fixed in positions 1, 2, 3.
- U and D are not in the word.

So the word is P R O _ _ and must contain F somewhere in positions 4 or 5.

Possible words:
- PRO F _ – but we need a 5-letter word.
- PRO _ F – but F is not in position 5 yet.
- PRO _ _ F – but F must be in the word.

Looking for 5-letter words that start with PRO and contain F:
- PROOF – contains F in position 4.
- PROOF – letters: P, R, O, O, F.  
   Check if any letters are forbidden:  
   P, R, O are allowed (already confirmed).  
   O is allowed (no restriction on O).  
   F is allowed (from FROCK feedback: F is in the word but not in position 1).  
   None of the letters are in the forbidden list.

PROOF fits all constraints.

Let me verify:
- P(✓) R(✓) O(✓) O(✓) F(-)  
  From PROOF feedback: P, R, O are correct in positions 1, 2, 3.  
  F is in the word but not in position 5 (matches FROCK feedback).  
  O is in position 4; no restriction on O in position 4.

Therefore, PROOF is a valid guess.

<guess>PROOF</guess>",PROOF,"We have four rounds of feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ No S, L, A, T, E anywhere.

2. BRINY → B(x) R(✓) I(x) N(x) Y(x)  
   ⇒ R is in position 2.

3. FROCK → F(-) R(✓) O(✓) C(x) K(x)  
   ⇒ R is in position 2 (confirmed), O is in position 3, and F is somewhere in the word (but not in position 1).

4. PROUD → P(✓) R(✓) O(✓) U(x) D(x)  
   ⇒ P is in position 1, R is in position 2, O is in position 3.  
   ⇒ U and D are not in the word.

So the pattern so far is: P R O _ _

Letters already ruled out: S, L, A, T, E, B, I, N, Y, C, F, U, D.

Remaining possible letters for positions 4 and 5: G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with PRO and uses only allowed letters for positions 4 and 5.

Possible candidates:
- PROXY – but Y is ruled out.
- PROK – too short.
- PROGM – too long.
- PROHM – too long.
- PROVK – too long.
- PROW – too short.
- PROG – too short.
- PROGZ – too long.
- PROHZ – too long.
- PROKZ – too long.

Looking for common 5-letter words that start with PRO and use only allowed letters:
- PROXY – invalid (Y).
- PROWL – L is ruled out.
- PROWL – invalid.
- PROWL – invalid.
- PROWL – invalid.
- PROWL – invalid.
- PROWL – invalid.
- PROWL – invalid.

Wait, let me think differently. The word must be P R O _ _.  
Possible fourth letters: G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z.  
Possible fifth letters: same.

Possible words:
- PROGH – not a word.
- PROGK – not a word.
- PROGM – not a word.
- PROGZ – not a word.
- PROHZ – not a word.
- PROKZ – not a word.

Actually, the only common word that fits is PROXY, but Y is ruled out.  
Next possible: PROWL – L is ruled out.  
PROWL – invalid.

Wait, let me re-examine the allowed letters for positions 4 and 5.  
From the feedback, we know:
- F is in the word but not in position 1 (from FROCK: F(-)).
- P, R, O are fixed in positions 1, 2, 3.
- U and D are not in the word.

So the word is P R O _ _ and must contain F somewhere in positions 4 or 5.

Possible words:
- PRO F _ – but we need a 5-letter word.
- PRO _ F – but F is not in position 5 yet.
- PRO _ _ F – but F must be in the word.

Looking for 5-letter words that start with PRO and contain F:
- PROOF – contains F in position 4.
- PROOF – letters: P, R, O, O, F.  
   Check if any letters are forbidden:  
   P, R, O are allowed (already confirmed).  
   O is allowed (no restriction on O).  
   F is allowed (from FROCK feedback: F is in the word but not in position 1).  
   None of the letters are in the forbidden list.

PROOF fits all constraints.

Let me verify:
- P(✓) R(✓) O(✓) O(✓) F(-)  
  From PROOF feedback: P, R, O are correct in positions 1, 2, 3.  
  F is in the word but not in position 5 (matches FROCK feedback).  
  O is in position 4; no restriction on O in position 4.

Therefore, PROOF is a valid guess.",Guess 6: PROOF -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) O(✓) O(✓) F(✓),SUCCESS
