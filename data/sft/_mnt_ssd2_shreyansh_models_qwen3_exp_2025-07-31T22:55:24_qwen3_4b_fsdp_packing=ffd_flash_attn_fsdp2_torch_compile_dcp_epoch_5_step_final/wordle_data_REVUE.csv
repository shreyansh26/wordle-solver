For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and which are not. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", ""ADIEU"", etc.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- 2 consonants (R, S) which are also quite common
This should give me good coverage of common letters to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.

- O(x) – O is NOT in the word.
- S(x) – S is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word AND in the 5th position.

So far we know:
- E is fixed in position 5.
- R is somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.
- No A, O, or S.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that contains R (but not in position 2) and avoids A, O, S. Good consonants to try next are T, N, L, C, D, etc.

Let’s try “R” in position 1: R _ _ _ E
Possible words: RIDE, RIDE is 4 letters, RIDE isn’t 5. RITEN? Not valid. RINSE – but S is out. RUTHE – not valid. RHEDE – not valid. RIDE is 4 letters, so this might not work.

Try R in position 3: _ _ R _ E
Possible words: CRANE – but A is out. DRIBE – not valid. FRIBE – not valid. PRIDE – P is allowed, D is allowed. PRIDE is valid and has R in position 3.

Check letters: P, R, I, D, E. No A, O, S. R is in position 3 (allowed). E is in position 5 (correct). This seems good.

Another option: TRIBE – T, R, I, B, E. R in position 2 is disallowed (from feedback), so TRIBE is out.

So PRIDE looks good: P, R, I, D, E. R is in position 3 (allowed), E is in position 5 (correct), no A, O, S.

Possible words:  
- RUBLE – but B is allowed, U is allowed, L is allowed, E is correct.  
  However, U is a vowel and hasn’t been ruled out yet.  
  RUBLE is valid.

- RUTHE – not valid.  
- RYTHE – not valid.

Try R in position 3: _ _ R _ E  
Possible words:  
- CRONE – but O is out.  
- GRATE – A is out.  
- HREDE – not valid.  
- LREDE – not valid.  
- BREDE – not valid.

Try R in position 4: _ _ _ R E  
Possible words:  
- FURRE – double R allowed, but U is allowed.  
- GURRE – not common.  
- LURRE – not common.  
- MURRE – not common.  
- VURRE – not common.  
- WURRE – not common.  
- YURRE – not common.  
- FURRE is the only common word here.

Between RUBLE and FURRE, RUBLE uses more common letters (B, U, L) and is more likely.

So RUBLE seems the best next guess.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

1. Letters that are **in** the word:  
   - R (position 1, confirmed)  
   - E (position 5, confirmed)

2. Letters that are **not** in the word:  
   A, O, S, P, I, D, B, L

3. Letters that **are** in the word but whose positions are still unknown:  
   - U (from RUBLE feedback: U is in the word but not in position 2)

4. Therefore, the word pattern so far is:  
   R _ _ _ E  
   with the letters still to place being:  
   – U (somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4)  
   – plus two more letters (not yet ruled out) that must be consonants or vowels we haven’t tried yet.

5. Common remaining consonants that have not been ruled out: C, F, G, H, K, M, N, T, V, W, Y, etc.  
   Common remaining vowels: none left except U (already accounted for).

6. We need to fill positions 2, 3, 4 with:  
   – one of them must be U  
   – the other two must be chosen from the remaining unused letters.

7. A quick scan of common 5-letter words that start with R, end with E, and contain U:

   - R U _ _ E → R U C E? → R U C E is 4 letters.  
   - R _ U _ E → R A U G E? → A is out.  
   - R _ _ U E → R U N K E? → R U N K E is not a valid word.  
   - R _ _ _ U E → no, word must be 5 letters.

   The only valid 5-letter word that fits R _ _ _ E, contains U, and uses only allowed letters is:

   R U C H E – but C and H are both still allowed, and the word is valid.

   However, let’s double-check if C and H have been ruled out.  
   From the feedback so far, the only letters ruled out are:  
   A, O, S, P, I, D, B, L.  
   C and H have not been tested yet, so they are still possible.

   Therefore, R U C H E is a valid candidate.

   Another candidate: R U C K E – but C and K are both allowed, and it’s a valid word.

   Between R U C H E and R U C K E, both are valid, but R U C H E is more common.

   However, let’s also consider if U could be in position 3:  
   R _ U _ E → R A U G E (A out), R I U G E (I out), R O U G E (O out), R U N G E (G and N allowed, but word not common).  
   R U N G E is not a standard word.

   If U is in position 4:  
   R _ _ U E → R A U G E (A out), R O U G E (O out), R I U G E (I out), R U N G E (not valid), R U C H E (valid).  
   So R U C H E is the only valid word we can construct that fits the constraints.

   Therefore, the next logical guess is R U C H E.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and which are not. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", ""ADIEU"", etc.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- 2 consonants (R, S) which are also quite common
This should give me good coverage of common letters to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- O(x) – O is NOT in the word.
- S(x) – S is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word AND in the 5th position.

So far we know:
- E is fixed in position 5.
- R is somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.
- No A, O, or S.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that contains R (but not in position 2) and avoids A, O, S. Good consonants to try next are T, N, L, C, D, etc.

Let’s try “R” in position 1: R _ _ _ E
Possible words: RIDE, RIDE is 4 letters, RIDE isn’t 5. RITEN? Not valid. RINSE – but S is out. RUTHE – not valid. RHEDE – not valid. RIDE is 4 letters, so this might not work.

Try R in position 3: _ _ R _ E
Possible words: CRANE – but A is out. DRIBE – not valid. FRIBE – not valid. PRIDE – P is allowed, D is allowed. PRIDE is valid and has R in position 3.

Check letters: P, R, I, D, E. No A, O, S. R is in position 3 (allowed). E is in position 5 (correct). This seems good.

Another option: TRIBE – T, R, I, B, E. R in position 2 is disallowed (from feedback), so TRIBE is out.

So PRIDE looks good: P, R, I, D, E. R is in position 3 (allowed), E is in position 5 (correct), no A, O, S.

Let’s go with PRIDE.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. E is fixed in position 5.
2. R is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from AROSE) and NOT in position 2 (from PRIDE).  
   So R must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
3. Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S, P, I, D.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that contains R (but not in position 2) and avoids A, O, S, P, I, D.

Remaining common consonants: B, C, F, G, H, L, M, N, T, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try R in position 1: R _ _ _ E  
Possible words:  
- RUBLE – but B is allowed, U is allowed, L is allowed, E is correct.  
  However, U is a vowel and hasn’t been ruled out yet.  
  RUBLE is valid.

- RUTHE – not valid.  
- RYTHE – not valid.

Try R in position 3: _ _ R _ E  
Possible words:  
- CRONE – but O is out.  
- GRATE – A is out.  
- HREDE – not valid.  
- LREDE – not valid.  
- BREDE – not valid.

Try R in position 4: _ _ _ R E  
Possible words:  
- FURRE – double R allowed, but U is allowed.  
- GURRE – not common.  
- LURRE – not common.  
- MURRE – not common.  
- VURRE – not common.  
- WURRE – not common.  
- YURRE – not common.  
- FURRE is the only common word here.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and which are not. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", ""ADIEU"", etc.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- 2 consonants (R, S) which are also quite common
This should give me good coverage of common letters to start narrowing down possibilities.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- O(x) – O is NOT in the word.
- S(x) – S is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word AND in the 5th position.

So far we know:
- E is fixed in position 5.
- R is somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.
- No A, O, or S.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that contains R (but not in position 2) and avoids A, O, S. Good consonants to try next are T, N, L, C, D, etc.

Let’s try “R” in position 1: R _ _ _ E
Possible words: RIDE, RIDE is 4 letters, RIDE isn’t 5. RITEN? Not valid. RINSE – but S is out. RUTHE – not valid. RHEDE – not valid. RIDE is 4 letters, so this might not work.

Try R in position 3: _ _ R _ E
Possible words: CRANE – but A is out. DRIBE – not valid. FRIBE – not valid. PRIDE – P is allowed, D is allowed. PRIDE is valid and has R in position 3.

Check letters: P, R, I, D, E. No A, O, S. R is in position 3 (allowed). E is in position 5 (correct). This seems good.

Another option: TRIBE – T, R, I, B, E. R in position 2 is disallowed (from feedback), so TRIBE is out.

So PRIDE looks good: P, R, I, D, E. R is in position 3 (allowed), E is in position 5 (correct), no A, O, S.

Let’s go with PRIDE.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. E is fixed in position 5.
2. R is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from AROSE) and NOT in position 2 (from PRIDE).  
   So R must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
3. Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S, P, I, D.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that contains R (but not in position 2) and avoids A, O, S, P, I, D.

Remaining common consonants: B, C, F, G, H, L, M, N, T, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try R in position 1: R _ _ _ E  
Possible words:  
- RUBLE – but B is allowed, U is allowed, L is allowed, E is correct.  
  However, U is a vowel and hasn’t been ruled out yet.  
  RUBLE is valid.

- RUTHE – not valid.  
- RYTHE – not valid.

Try R in position 3: _ _ R _ E  
Possible words:  
- CRONE – but O is out.  
- GRATE – A is out.  
- HREDE – not valid.  
- LREDE – not valid.  
- BREDE – not valid.

Try R in position 4: _ _ _ R E  
Possible words:  
- FURRE – double R allowed, but U is allowed.  
- GURRE – not common.  
- LURRE – not common.  
- MURRE – not common.  
- VURRE – not common.  
- WURRE – not common.  
- YURRE – not common.  
- FURRE is the only common word here.

Between RUBLE and FURRE, RUBLE uses more common letters (B, U, L) and is more likely.

So RUBLE seems the best next guess.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

1. Letters that are **in** the word:  
   - R (position 1, confirmed)  
   - E (position 5, confirmed)

2. Letters that are **not** in the word:  
   A, O, S, P, I, D, B, L

3. Letters that **are** in the word but whose positions are still unknown:  
   - U (from RUBLE feedback: U is in the word but not in position 2)

4. Therefore, the word pattern so far is:  
   R _ _ _ E  
   with the letters still to place being:  
   – U (somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4)  
   – plus two more letters (not yet ruled out) that must be consonants or vowels we haven’t tried yet.

5. Common remaining consonants that have not been ruled out: C, F, G, H, K, M, N, T, V, W, Y, etc.  
   Common remaining vowels: none left except U (already accounted for).

6. We need to fill positions 2, 3, 4 with:  
   – one of them must be U  
   – the other two must be chosen from the remaining unused letters.

7. A quick scan of common 5-letter words that start with R, end with E, and contain U:

   - R U _ _ E → R U C E? → R U C E is 4 letters.  
   - R _ U _ E → R A U G E? → A is out.  
   - R _ _ U E → R U N K E? → R U N K E is not a valid word.  
   - R _ _ _ U E → no, word must be 5 letters.

   The only valid 5-letter word that fits R _ _ _ E, contains U, and uses only allowed letters is:

   R U C H E – but C and H are both still allowed, and the word is valid.

   However, let’s double-check if C and H have been ruled out.  
   From the feedback so far, the only letters ruled out are:  
   A, O, S, P, I, D, B, L.  
   C and H have not been tested yet, so they are still possible.

   Therefore, R U C H E is a valid candidate.

   Another candidate: R U C K E – but C and K are both allowed, and it’s a valid word.

   Between R U C H E and R U C K E, both are valid, but R U C H E is more common.

   However, let’s also consider if U could be in position 3:  
   R _ U _ E → R A U G E (A out), R I U G E (I out), R O U G E (O out), R U N G E (G and N allowed, but word not common).  
   R U N G E is not a standard word.

   If U is in position 4:  
   R _ _ U E → R A U G E (A out), R O U G E (O out), R I U G E (I out), R U N G E (not valid), R U C H E (valid).  
   So R U C H E is the only valid word we can construct that fits the constraints.

   Therefore, the next logical guess is R U C H E.

From all the feedback so far:

1. Pattern: R _ U _ E
   - Position 1: R (✓)
   - Position 5: E (✓)
   - Position 3: U (must be here, because it was “-” in positions 2 and 4 and now must be in 3)
   - Positions 2 and 4: still unknown.

2. Letters already ruled out: A, O, S, P, I, D, B, L, C, H, N, G.

3. Remaining unused consonants: F, J, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

4. We need two distinct consonants for positions 2 and 4, drawn from the above list.

5. The only common 5-letter word that fits R _ U _ E and uses only allowed letters is:

   R U M P E – but P is already ruled out.

   R U T E – too short.

   R U F F E – double F is allowed, and F is still allowed.

   R U F F E is a valid word (a type of footwear).

   R U M P E – invalid (P out).

   R U T E – too short.

   R U K E – too short.

   R U V E – too short.

   R U F F E is the only valid 5-letter word that fits.

Therefore, the next guess must be RUFFE.
