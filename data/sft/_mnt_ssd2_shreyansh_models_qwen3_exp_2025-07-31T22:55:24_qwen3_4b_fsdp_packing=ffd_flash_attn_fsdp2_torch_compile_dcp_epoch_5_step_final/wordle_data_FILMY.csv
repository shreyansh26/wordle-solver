### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains five very common letters. However, I also want to consider words that might have more vowels or consonants that are likely to appear. Another strong option is ""CRANE"" which includes C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters. 

After considering these options, I think ""SLATE"" is a solid first guess because it covers S, L, A, T, E - which are all very common letters in English words. This should give me good information about which letters are present in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:

2. L must appear somewhere in the word, but not in the second position.

Next, I want a word that:
- Contains L (and not in position 2)
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated (no S, A, T, E)

So far:
- Must contain: I, L

- L cannot be in positions 2 or 4

Remaining common letters: R, N, O, U, M, P, G, B, F, K, Y, etc.

- Has both I and L
- Doesn’t use any of the eliminated letters
- Places I somewhere other than position 3
- Places L somewhere other than positions 2 or 4

Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 4, 5
Possible positions for L: 1, 3, 5 (since 2 and 4 are excluded)

Let’s look for words that fit these constraints. A good candidate is “FLING”:
- F, L, I, N, G
- Contains I and L
- L is in position 2 → but we know L cannot be in position 2 (from SLATE feedback). So FLING is invalid.

Next candidate: “GLIMP” – but this isn’t a valid English word.

Another candidate: “PLINK” – P, L, I, N, K
- Contains I and L

Next: “BLIMP” – B, L, I, M, P
- L is in position 2 → invalid.

Next: “MILKY” – M, I, L, K, Y

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains five very common letters. However, I also want to consider words that might have more vowels or consonants that are likely to appear. Another strong option is ""CRANE"" which includes C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters. 

After considering these options, I think ""SLATE"" is a solid first guess because it covers S, L, A, T, E - which are all very common letters in English words. This should give me good information about which letters are present in the secret word and their positions.

Next: “BLIMP” – B, L, I, M, P
- L is in position 2 → invalid.

Next: “MILKY” – M, I, L, K, Y
- Contains I and L
- L is in position 3 → allowed (positions allowed for L: 1, 3, 5)
- I is in position 2 → allowed (positions allowed for I: 1, 2, 4, 5)
- No eliminated letters used
- Valid English word

So “MILKY” is a strong next guess.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains five very common letters. However, I also want to consider words that might have more vowels or consonants that are likely to appear. Another strong option is ""CRANE"" which includes C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters. \n\nAfter considering these options, I think ""SLATE"" is a solid first guess because it covers S, L, A, T, E - which are all very common letters in English words.

From the new feedback on MILKY:

- M(-) : M is in the word but not in position 1.
- I(✓) : I is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- L(✓) : L is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- K(x) : K is not in the word.
- Y(✓) : Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So far we know the pattern is:
_ I L _ Y

Letters that must be in the word: I, L, Y
Letters that must NOT be in the word: S, A, T, E, C, H, D, K
Also, M is in the word but not in position 1, so M must be in position 4.

Therefore the word must be:
_ I L M Y

The only missing letter is the first one. It must be a consonant (since I, L, M, Y are already used) and not any of the eliminated letters (S, A, T, E, C, H, D, K). Possible first letters: B, F, G, N, P, R, etc.

Looking for valid 5-letter words that fit _ I L M Y:

- BILMY – not a word
- FILMY – yes, a valid English word (meaning resembling film or having a film-like appearance)
- GILMY – not a word
- NILMY – not a word
- PILMY – not a word
- RILMY – not a word

FILMY is the only valid word that fits the pattern and uses allowed letters.
