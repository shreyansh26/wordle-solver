### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters in different positions.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers different positions. This should give us good feedback on several key letters right away.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all (x)

So the secret word:
- contains the letter A (but not in the first position)
- does NOT contain R, O, S, or E

Good next step: pick a word that:
1. keeps the known letter A in a different position (2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th)
2. avoids R, O, S, E entirely
3. introduces new common letters to maximize information

A strong candidate is ""AUDIO"":

- Other letters from the remaining common ones: T, N, L, C, M, P, H, etc.

A good next guess should test new common letters while satisfying the constraints. Let's try ""TACIT"":
- T and C are new letters.
- A is in position 2 (new position).
- I is in position 4 (correct).
- C is new.
- T is new.

This tests three new letters (T, C, and the position of A) while keeping I fixed.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters in different positions.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers different positions. This should give us good feedback on several key letters right away.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all (x)

So the secret word:
- contains the letter A (but not in the first position)
- does NOT contain R, O, S, or E

Good next step: pick a word that:
1. keeps the known letter A in a different position (2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th)
2. avoids R, O, S, E entirely
3. introduces new common letters to maximize information

A strong candidate is ""AUDIO"":
- contains A in the 2nd position (new position)
- uses common letters U, I, D, T
- avoids R, O, S, E

Guess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(✓) O(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are not in the word.

2. audio → A(-) U(x) D(x) I(✓) O(x)
   - A is still in the word but not in position 1 (confirmed again).
   - I is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
   - U, D, O are not in the word.

So the secret word:
- has I in position 4.
- contains A somewhere other than position 1.
- does NOT contain R, O, S, E, U, D.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- I in position 4.
- A somewhere (positions 2, 3, 4, or 5; but position 4 is already I, so 2, 3, or 5).
- Other letters from the remaining common ones: T, N, L, C, M, P, H, etc.

A good next guess should test new common letters while satisfying the constraints. Let's try ""TACIT"":
- T and C are new letters.
- A is in position 2 (new position).
- I is in position 4 (correct).
- C is new.
- T is new.

This tests three new letters (T, C, and the position of A) while keeping I fixed.

From the latest feedback on TIGMA:

- T(✓) – position 1 is correct.
- I(✓) – position 2 is correct.
- G(x) – G is not in the word.
- M(x) – M is not in the word.
- A(✓) – position 5 is correct.

So the pattern is now:
T I _ _ A

Letters we know are NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, U, D, C, L, F, G, M  
Letters still allowed for positions 3 and 4: N, H, B, K, V, Y, W, P, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with TI and ends with A, with the middle two letters chosen from the allowed set.

Possible candidates:
- TINJA (but J is allowed, but J is rare)
- TIHNA (H is allowed, N is allowed)
- TIBNA (B is allowed, N is allowed)
- TIWNA (W is allowed, N is allowed)
- TIHMA (but M is excluded)
- TINWA (N, W allowed)
- TINJA (J allowed)

The most common remaining letters are N and H. A common word is TINJA, but it's less common. Another is TIHNA, but it's also uncommon. TINWA is uncommon. The most likely common word is TINJA.

But let's think of more common words: TIGRA is invalid (G,R excluded). TIBIA is invalid (B,I,A allowed but I is already in position 2). TIBIA is actually T I B I A – but I is already in position 2, so position 4 would be I again. But we know I is only in position 2, so TIBIA is invalid.

Another candidate: TIBIA is invalid because I is already in position 2 and we can't have I in position 4 (since I is only known to be in position 2 from feedback).

Wait, no: the feedback from TIGMA shows I is correct in position 2, but does not say anything about position 4. Actually, the feedback from TIGMA shows I(✓) in position 2, but the word pattern is T I _ _ A, so position 4 is still open. The previous feedback from AUDIO shows I(✓) in position 4, so we know I is in position 4. Wait, let me re-examine:

From AUDIO feedback: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(✓) O(x) – the I is in position 4, so the pattern is T _ _ I A.

But from TIGMA feedback: T(✓) I(✓) G(x) M(x) A(✓) – the I is in position 2, which contradicts the earlier conclusion that I is in position 4. This suggests a mistake in earlier interpretation.

Re-examining the feedback:

Guess 2: audio → positions: A(1) U(2) D(3) I(4) O(5) → feedback: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(✓) O(x). This means I is in position 4.

Guess 5: tigma → positions: T(1) I(2) G(3) M(4) A(5) → feedback: T(✓) I(✓) G(x) M(x) A(✓). This means:
- T is correct in position 1.
- I is correct in position 2.
- G is not in the word.
- M is not in the word.
- A is correct in position 5.

This contradicts the earlier conclusion that I is in position 4. The correct interpretation is that I is in position 2 (from TIGMA feedback) and in position 4 (from AUDIO feedback). This is impossible unless the word has two I's, which is possible.

So the word must have:
- T in position 1
- I in position 2
- I in position 4
- A in position 5
- Position 3 is unknown (but not G or M)

Thus the pattern is: T I _ I A

Letters allowed for position 3: N, H, B, K, V, Y, W, P, etc.

Possible words:
- TINIA – but N is allowed, I is allowed, A is allowed. However, ""TINIA"" is not a common word.
- TIHIA – H is allowed, but uncommon.
- TIBIA – B is allowed, I is allowed, A is allowed. ""TIBIA"" is a valid word (the bone in the leg).

""TIBIA"" fits all constraints:
- T I B I A
- T(1) ✓, I(2) ✓, B(3) new letter, I(4) ✓, A(5) ✓
- Letters used: T, I, B, I, A – none of the excluded letters (R, O, S, E, U, D, C, L, F, G, M) appear.
- ""TIBIA"" is a valid 5-letter English word.

Therefore, the next guess should be TIBIA.
