### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should cover as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

One excellent first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (common)
- O (common)
- S (common)
- E (most common letter)

This gives us a good spread of high-frequency letters to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O is NOT in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So we know:
1. Letters NOT in the word: A, O, E
2. Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions: R, S

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains R and S somewhere other than positions 2 and 4 respectively
- Does NOT contain A, O, E
- Uses only remaining common letters to maximize information

Good remaining common letters: T, N, L, I, C, U, D, M, P, H, Y, etc.

Let’s try a word that places R and S in new positions and introduces new common letters. “STIRL” is invalid (not a word). “CRISP” is valid, but has P and I. “TRUST” is good: T, R, U, S, T. It places R in position 2 (but we know R is not in position 2 from AROSE feedback). So R cannot be in position 2.

Let’s try “CRUST”: C, R, U, S, T
- R is in position 2 (invalid, same as before)
- S is in position 4 (invalid, same as before)

Next: “STIRL” invalid. “TRICK”: T, R, I, C, K
- R in position 2 (invalid)
- S not present (we need S)

Next: “RUSTY”: R in position 1 (new), S in position 3 (new), T, U, Y
- Contains R and S in new positions
- Uses T, U, Y which are common
- No A, O, E

This seems optimal.
