For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

Looking at these, I can form the word ""AROSE"" which contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E). This should give me good coverage to determine which of these letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) : A is in the word but not in position 1.

- O(x) : O is NOT in the word.
- S(x) : S is NOT in the word.

- Letters NOT in the word: O, S

We need a 5-letter word that contains A, R, E exactly once each, and does NOT contain O or S. Also, we must avoid placing A in position 1, R in position 2, and E in position 5.

A good next guess should place these known letters in new positions while introducing new common letters. Let's try to use T, N, L, I, etc.

One candidate is ""TRAIN"":
- T: new letter
- R: position 2 is forbidden, so this would put R in position 2 – bad.
Try ""RAISE"":
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- I: new letter
- S: forbidden (already excluded)

So ""RAISE"" is invalid because it uses S and E in forbidden positions.

Next candidate: ""REACT""

- E in position 2 (allowed)
- A in position 3 (allowed)
- C: new letter

Looking at these, I can form the word ""AROSE"" which contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E). This should give me good coverage to determine which of these letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

- A (must appear somewhere, but not in positions 1 or 3)
- R (must appear somewhere, but not in positions 2 or 1)
- E (must appear somewhere, but not in positions 5 or 2)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- O, S, C, T

So the secret word must contain exactly one A, one R, one E, and two other letters that are not O, S, C, T.

We need to place A, R, E in positions that have not been ruled out:
- A can be in positions 2, 4, or 5
- R can be in positions 3, 4, or 5
- E can be in positions 1, 3, or 4

We also need two new letters (not in {O, S, C, T}) that have not been used yet. Common unused letters include N, I, L, D, U, etc.

Let’s look for a word that:
- Contains A, R, E exactly once each
- Places A, R, E in allowed positions
- Uses two new letters from the remaining alphabet

One candidate is ""RANIE"":
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- N: new letter
- I: new letter
- E in position 5 (allowed)

But ""RANIE"" is not a valid English word.

Another candidate is ""EARLY"":
- E in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- R in position 3 (allowed)
- L: new letter
- Y: new letter

""EARLY"" is a valid 5-letter English word and satisfies all constraints:
- Contains A, R, E
- No O, S, C, T
- A is in position 2 (allowed)
- R is in position 3 (allowed)
- E is in position 1 (allowed)

From the new feedback on EARLY:
- E(✓) : E is in the word and in position 1.
- A(✓) : A is in the word and in position 2.
- R(-) : R is in the word but not in position 3.
- L(x) : L is not in the word.
- Y(x) : Y is not in the word.

So we now know:
- Word structure: E A _ _ _
- Must contain R somewhere, but not in position 3 (so R can be in positions 4 or 5)
- Letters NOT in the word: O, S, C, T, L, Y
- Remaining letters to choose: two more letters from the unused pool (not O, S, C, T, L, Y)

Common remaining letters: N, I, D, U, G, H, etc.

We need two distinct letters that haven't been ruled out and fit the pattern E A _ _ _.

Possible positions for R: 4 or 5.

Let's try:
- If R is in position 4: E A _ R _
- If R is in position 5: E A _ _ R

Let's list valid 5-letter words fitting these patterns:
1. E A _ R _ : examples: EARLY (already used), EARLY, EARLY, etc. (but L and Y are out). Need new letters.
   - EARNS: N is allowed, but S is out.
   - EARLY: L, Y out.
   - EARNE: E already in position 1.
   - EARLY is invalid, so need another word.

2. E A _ _ R :
   - E A _ _ R : possible words: EAGLE (G, L out), EARTH (H, T out), EAGER (G, E already in 1), EAGER is invalid because E is already used in 1 and we can't have two E's.
   - E A I N R : ""EANIR"" not a word.

   - E A N G R : ""EANGR"" not a word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

Looking at these, I can form the word ""AROSE"" which contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E). This should give me good coverage to determine which of these letters are in the secret word and their possible positions. 

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems like a strong first choice as it includes E, A, R, O, S which are all very common. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) : A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) : R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) : O is NOT in the word.
- S(x) : S is NOT in the word.
- E(-) : E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters in the word: A, R, E
- Letters NOT in the word: O, S
- Positions to avoid:
  – A not in position 1
  – R not in position 2
  – E not in position 5

We need a 5-letter word that contains A, R, E exactly once each, and does NOT contain O or S. Also, we must avoid placing A in position 1, R in position 2, and E in position 5.

A good next guess should place these known letters in new positions while introducing new common letters. Let's try to use T, N, L, I, etc.

One candidate is ""TRAIN"":
- T: new letter
- R: position 2 is forbidden, so this would put R in position 2 – bad.
Try ""RAISE"":
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- I: new letter
- S: forbidden (already excluded)
- E in position 5 (forbidden)
So ""RAISE"" is invalid because it uses S and E in forbidden positions.

Next candidate: ""REACT""
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- A in position 3 (allowed)
- C: new letter
- T: new letter
This uses A, R, E in allowed positions and introduces C and T.

This seems like a good second guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: REACT -> FEEDBACK: R(-) E(-) A(-) C(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word:
- A (must appear somewhere, but not in positions 1 or 3)
- R (must appear somewhere, but not in positions 2 or 1)
- E (must appear somewhere, but not in positions 5 or 2)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- O, S, C, T

So the secret word must contain exactly one A, one R, one E, and two other letters that are not O, S, C, T.

We need to place A, R, E in positions that have not been ruled out:
- A can be in positions 2, 4, or 5
- R can be in positions 3, 4, or 5
- E can be in positions 1, 3, or 4

We also need two new letters (not in {O, S, C, T}) that have not been used yet. Common unused letters include N, I, L, D, U, etc.

Let’s look for a word that:
- Contains A, R, E exactly once each
- Places A, R, E in allowed positions
- Uses two new letters from the remaining alphabet

One candidate is ""RANIE"":
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- N: new letter
- I: new letter
- E in position 5 (allowed)

But ""RANIE"" is not a valid English word.

Another candidate is ""EARLY"":
- E in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- R in position 3 (allowed)
- L: new letter
- Y: new letter

""EARLY"" is a valid 5-letter English word and satisfies all constraints:
- Contains A, R, E
- No O, S, C, T
- A is in position 2 (allowed)
- R is in position 3 (allowed)
- E is in position 1 (allowed)

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A, R, E are in the word but not in positions 1,2,5 respectively.
   - O and S are not in the word.

2. REACT → R(-) E(-) A(-) C(x) T(x)
   - R, E, A are in the word but not in positions 1,2,3 respectively.
   - C and T are not in the word.

3. EARLY → E(✓) A(✓) R(-) L(x) Y(x)
   - E is in position 1 (correct).
   - A is in position 2 (correct).
   - R is in the word but not in position 3.
   - L and Y are not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Starts with E
- Has A in position 2
- Contains R somewhere other than positions 1,2,3
- Does NOT contain O, S, C, T, L, Y
- Must be 5 letters.

Letters used so far: E, A, R  
Letters ruled out: O, S, C, T, L, Y  
Remaining common letters: N, I, D, U, G, M, B, F, H, K, P, V, W, X, Z

R must be in position 4 or 5.

Possible patterns:
E A _ R _  or  E A _ _ R

Let’s try to fill the blanks with remaining letters while keeping it a valid English word.

Option 1: E A _ R _

E A F N R → EAFNR not valid

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. Let me think differently—maybe R is in position 5.

Pattern: E A _ _ R

E A N D R → EANDR not valid

E A F I R → EAFIR not valid

Wait, ""EAGLE"" has E, A, G, L, E—but L is ruled out.
""EAGLE"" is invalid.

""EAGLE"" is invalid because L is ruled out.

""EAGER"" has E, A, G, E, R—but we already have E in position 1 and A in position 2, and G is allowed, R is in position 5 (allowed). Also, no O, S, C, T, L, Y.

""EAGER"" is a valid 5-letter English word and fits all constraints:
- E(✓) A(✓) _ _ R
- Contains R in position 5 (allowed)
- Uses G (new letter)
- No forbidden letters.

So the next guess should be ""EAGER"".
