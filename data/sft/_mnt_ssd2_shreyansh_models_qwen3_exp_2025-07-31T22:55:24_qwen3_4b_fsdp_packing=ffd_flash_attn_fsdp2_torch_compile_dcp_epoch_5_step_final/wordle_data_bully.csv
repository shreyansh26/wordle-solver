For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, etc. 

Some strong starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A, T, E are NOT in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word does NOT contain S, A, T, E
- It DOES contain L, but not in the 2nd position

Letters we can still use: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
We need a 5-letter word that has L somewhere other than position 2 and avoids S, A, T, E.

Good candidate letters to test next: R, O, I, N, U, C, D, etc.

Possible candidates:
- CLOUD (but has O, U, D - let's see)
- FLING (but has F, I, N, G - but L is in position 2 which is wrong)
- BROWN (B, R, O, W, N - L is missing)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has U in position 2.
2. Has L in position 3, 4, or 5.
3. Uses only letters from the still-allowed set.

Candidate words:
- BULKY (B, U, L, K, Y) – L in position 3, U in position 2, no forbidden letters.
- CULMS (C, U, L, M, S) – S is forbidden.
- FLUNK (F, L, U, N, K) – L in position 2, which is wrong.

- MULCH (M, U, L, C, H) – L in position 3, U in position 2, no forbidden letters.

Among these, BULKY, GULCH, and MULCH all fit the constraints. BULKY seems like the simplest choice.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, etc. 

Some strong starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with SLATE as it covers several common vowels and consonants, giving me good information about the letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A, T, E are NOT in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word does NOT contain S, A, T, E
- It DOES contain L, but not in the 2nd position

Letters we can still use: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
We need a 5-letter word that has L somewhere other than position 2 and avoids S, A, T, E.

Good candidate letters to test next: R, O, I, N, U, C, D, etc.

Possible candidates:
- CLOUD (but has O, U, D - let's see)
- FLING (but has F, I, N, G - but L is in position 2 which is wrong)
- BROWN (B, R, O, W, N - L is missing)
- GLOWY (G, L, O, W, Y - but L is in position 2 which is wrong)
- CLINK (C, L, I, N, K - L is in position 2 which is wrong)
- ROLLY (R, O, L, L, Y - L is in positions 3 and 4 - but position 2 is wrong)
- CRONY (C, R, O, N, Y - no L)
- LURID (L, U, R, I, D - L is in position 1 - this is valid)

LURID seems good: L in position 1 (valid), uses U, R, I, D which are common letters we haven't tested yet.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, etc. 

Some strong starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with SLATE as it covers several common vowels and consonants, giving me good information about the letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A, T, E are NOT in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word does NOT contain S, A, T, E
- It DOES contain L, but not in the 2nd position

Letters we can still use: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
We need a 5-letter word that has L somewhere other than position 2 and avoids S, A, T, E.

Good candidate letters to test next: R, O, I, N, U, C, D, etc.

Possible candidates:
- CLOUD (but has O, U, D - let's see)
- FLING (but has F, I, N, G - but L is in position 2 which is wrong)
- BROWN (B, R, O, W, N - L is missing)
- GLOWY (G, L, O, W, Y - but L is in position 2 which is wrong)
- CLINK (C, L, I, N, K - L is in position 2 which is wrong)
- ROLLY (R, O, L, L, Y - L is in positions 3 and 4 - but position 2 is wrong)
- CRONY (C, R, O, N, Y - no L)
- LURID (L, U, R, I, D - L is in position 1 - this is valid)

LURID seems good: L in position 1 (valid), uses U, R, I, D which are common letters we haven't tested yet.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: LURID -> FEEDBACK: L(-) U(✓) R(x) I(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we have:

Round 1 (SLATE):
- S, A, T, E are not in the word.
- L is in the word but not in position 2.

Round 2 (LURID):
- L is still in the word but not in position 1.
- U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- R, I, D are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: S, A, T, E, R, I, D
- Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:
  – U is in position 2 (✓)
  – L is somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5 (since it cannot be 1 or 2)

Letters still available: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the confirmed letters U and L.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has U in position 2.
2. Has L in position 3, 4, or 5.
3. Uses only letters from the still-allowed set.

Candidate words:
- BULKY (B, U, L, K, Y) – L in position 3, U in position 2, no forbidden letters.
- CULMS (C, U, L, M, S) – S is forbidden.
- FLUNK (F, L, U, N, K) – L in position 2, which is wrong.
- GULCH (G, U, L, C, H) – L in position 3, U in position 2, no forbidden letters.
- MULCH (M, U, L, C, H) – L in position 3, U in position 2, no forbidden letters.

Among these, BULKY, GULCH, and MULCH all fit the constraints. BULKY seems like the simplest choice.

<|im_start|>assistant
From the three rounds of feedback we now have:

Letters confirmed:
- B is in position 1 (✓)
- U is in position 2 (✓)
- L is in position 3 (✓)
- Y is in position 5 (✓)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
S, A, T, E, R, I, D, K

So the word has the form: B U L _ Y

We need a 5-letter word that starts with BUL and ends with Y, with the 4th letter being any letter that has not been ruled out.

Available letters for the 4th position: C, F, G, H, J, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

Candidate words:
- BULGY (G is allowed)
- BULMY (M is allowed)
- BULPY (P is allowed)

BULGY is the only common word in this list. All other letters (G, M, P) are valid but BULGY is the most likely.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From all feedback so far we know:

Confirmed letters and positions:
- B _ _ _ _ → B is in position 1 (✓)
- _ U L _ _ → U is in position 2 (✓), L is in position 3 (✓)
- _ _ _ _ Y → Y is in position 5 (✓)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
S, A, T, E, R, I, D, K, G

So the pattern is: B U L _ Y

Only the 4th letter is unknown.  
Allowed letters (not yet ruled out) for position 4: C, F, H, J, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

Common 5-letter English words that fit BUL-Y:
- BULMY (archaic, but valid)
- BULPY (not a common word)
- BULCY (not a word)
- BULNY (not a word)

The only common word left is BULMY.

Therefore, the next logical guess is BULMY.
