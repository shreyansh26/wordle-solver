### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess should use a mix of these common letters to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Looking at the frequency of letters in English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C. A word like ""SLATE"" uses S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. Another good option is ""AROSE"" or ""STARE"". 

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers several high-frequency consonants and vowels.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L is in the word and in position 2.
- A is in the word and in position 3.
- T and E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word has the pattern: _ L A _ _ with S somewhere in positions 2,3,4,5 (but positions 2 and 3 are already L and A, so S must be in 4 or 5).

Possible letters we still need to test: consonants like R, N, C, D, M, P, etc., and the remaining vowels I, O, U (since A is already used).

Good next guess should:
1. Keep L in position 2 and A in position 3.
2. Try S in position 4 or 5.
3. Introduce new common consonants and vowels to test.

A strong candidate is ""CLASP"":
- C (new consonant)
- L (correct in position 2)
- A (correct in position 3)
- S (to test in position 4)
- P (new consonant)

This tests C, S, P while maintaining the known L and A.
