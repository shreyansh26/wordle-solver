For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. I'll use these to form a word that covers several of these high-frequency letters. 

A good starting word should have:
1. Common letters to maximize information gain
2. No repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible
3. A mix of vowels and consonants

Looking at the common letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains 5 unique letters
- It has 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most common in English
- It tests R, S, A, O, E - covering 5 of the 7 most common letters

Let’s consolidate what we know so far:

Letters we know are in the word (but not in the positions guessed yet):
- R (not in positions 2 or 4)
- S (not in positions 4 or 1)
- E (not in positions 5 or 3)

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
- A, O, N

So the word must contain R, S, E, and must avoid A, O, N.

Positions ruled out:
- R cannot be 2 or 4
- S cannot be 1 or 4
- E cannot be 3 or 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses R, S, E exactly once each
- Uses two other letters from the remaining common letters (T, L, I, C, U, D, M, P, etc.)
- Avoids A, O, N

Let’s list possible positions for R, S, E:
R: 1, 3, 5  
S: 2, 3, 5  
E: 1, 2, 4  

We can try to place these letters in new positions and introduce new common letters.

A good candidate is “TREIS”:
- T (new letter)
- R (position 2 – but R cannot be 2 from previous feedback) → invalid.

Next try “TREND”:
- D is new, but N is already ruled out → invalid.

Try “STRET”:
- S in position 1 (invalid, S cannot be 1).

Try “REIST”:
- R in position 1, E in position 2, S in position 3, I and T new.  
This seems valid:
- R not in 2 or 4 → 1 is fine
- S not in 1 or 4 → 3 is fine
- E not in 3 or 5 → 2 is fine
- Uses new letters I, T

But “REIST” is not a valid English word.

Next candidate: “CREST”:
- C and T new
- R in position 2 (invalid)

Next: “STERN” already tried.

Next: “PRESS”:
- P and S again, but S in position 4 (invalid).

Next: “TRESI”:
- T, R, E, S, I
- R in position 2 (invalid)

Next: “TRESS”:
- S repeated (invalid)

Next: “TREES”:
- S in position 5 (invalid)

Next: “TREND” – N invalid.

Next: “TRICE”:

Next: “CURES”:
- C, U, R, E, S
- R in position 3 (valid)
- S in position 5 (valid)
- E in position 4 (valid)
- Uses new letters C, U

“CURES” is a valid English word and fits all constraints.

Let’s verify:
- C, U new letters
- R in position 3 (allowed)
- S in position 5 (allowed)
- E in position 4 (allowed)
- No A, O, N
- Contains R, S, E exactly once

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. I'll use these to form a word that covers several of these high-frequency letters. 

A good starting word should have:
1. Common letters to maximize information gain
2. No repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible
3. A mix of vowels and consonants

Looking at the common letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains 5 unique letters
- It has 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most common in English
- It tests R, S, A, O, E - covering 5 of the 7 most common letters

2. Avoids A and O
3. Places R, S, E in new positions
4. Introduces new common letters to narrow down possibilities

Good next letters to test: T, N, L, I, C, U, D, M, P, etc.

A strong candidate is ""STERN"":
- Contains S, T, E, R, N
- Tests T and N (new letters)
- R is now in position 4 (was in position 2 before)
- S is now in position 1 (was in position 4 before)
- E is now in position 3 (was in position 5 before)

This should give us more information about the positions of R, S, E and introduce T and N.

Let’s consolidate what we know so far:

Letters we know are in the word (but not in the positions guessed yet):
- R (not in positions 2 or 4)
- S (not in positions 4 or 1)
- E (not in positions 5 or 3)

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
- A, O, N

So the word must contain R, S, E, and must avoid A, O, N.

Positions ruled out:
- R cannot be 2 or 4
- S cannot be 1 or 4
- E cannot be 3 or 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses R, S, E exactly once each
- Uses two other letters from the remaining common letters (T, L, I, C, U, D, M, P, etc.)
- Avoids A, O, N

Let’s list possible positions for R, S, E:
R: 1, 3, 5  
S: 2, 3, 5  
E: 1, 2, 4  

We can try to place these letters in new positions and introduce new common letters.

A good candidate is “TREIS”:
- T (new letter)
- R (position 2 – but R cannot be 2 from previous feedback) → invalid.

Next try “TREND”:
- D is new, but N is already ruled out → invalid.

Try “STRET”:
- S in position 1 (invalid, S cannot be 1).

Try “REIST”:
- R in position 1, E in position 2, S in position 3, I and T new.  
This seems valid:
- R not in 2 or 4 → 1 is fine
- S not in 1 or 4 → 3 is fine
- E not in 3 or 5 → 2 is fine
- Uses new letters I, T

But “REIST” is not a valid English word.

Next candidate: “CREST”:
- C and T new
- R in position 2 (invalid)

Next: “STERN” already tried.

Next: “PRESS”:
- P and S again, but S in position 4 (invalid).

Next: “TRESI”:
- T, R, E, S, I
- R in position 2 (invalid)

Next: “TRESS”:
- S repeated (invalid)

Next: “TREES”:
- S in position 5 (invalid)

Next: “TREND” – N invalid.

Next: “TRICE”:
- T, R, I, C, E
- R in position 2 (invalid)

Next: “CRISP”:
- C, R, I, S, P
- R in position 2 (invalid)

Next: “CRUEL”:
- C, R, U, E, L
- R in position 2 (invalid)

Next: “CURES”:
- C, U, R, E, S
- R in position 3 (valid)
- S in position 5 (valid)
- E in position 4 (valid)
- Uses new letters C, U

“CURES” is a valid English word and fits all constraints.

Let’s verify:
- C, U new letters
- R in position 3 (allowed)
- S in position 5 (allowed)
- E in position 4 (allowed)
- No A, O, N
- Contains R, S, E exactly once

So “CURES” is a strong next guess.

Let’s update what we now know after the three guesses.

Known letters in the word:
- R (must be in the word, but positions 2, 3, 4 are ruled out; so R can only be in 1 or 5)
- E (now confirmed in position 4)
- S (must be in the word, but positions 1, 4 are ruled out; so S can only be in 2, 3, or 5)

Letters definitely NOT in the word:
A, O, N, C, U

So far we have:
_ _ E _ _
with R somewhere in 1 or 5, and S somewhere in 2, 3, or 5.

We need to place R and S in the remaining slots and introduce two new common letters that are still allowed.

Remaining common letters to try: T, L, I, D, M, P, G, B, F, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s list possible patterns:

Case 1: R in position 1
R _ E _ _
Then S must be in 2, 3, or 5
- R S E _ _ – but E is already in 4, so this is invalid
- R _ E S _ – S in 4 is invalid (E is there)
- R _ E _ S – S in 5 is valid, so need one more letter in 2
  Pattern: R ? E ? S
  Possible: R I E D S → “RIEDS” (not valid), R I E N S → N invalid, R I E L S → “RIELS” (valid word)

Case 2: R in position 5
_ _ E _ R
Then S must be in 2 or 3
- _ S E _ R – S in 2
  Pattern: ? S E ? R
  Possible: T S E L R → “TSEL R” (invalid), B S E L R → invalid, etc.
  Valid words: “TSELR” invalid, “BSELR” invalid – seems few
- _ _ E S R – S in 4 invalid (E is there)
- _ S E S R – S repeated invalid
- _ _ E _ S – S in 5, but R is already in 5 – conflict

So the only valid pattern seems to be Case 1 with R in 1 and S in 5, giving us:
R _ E _ S

We need one more letter in position 2 and one in 4. The letter in position 4 must be different from E and not already ruled out.

Possible letters left: T, L, I, D, M, P, G, B, F, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try R I E L S – “RIELS” is a valid word meaning a ridge or a row of hills.

Check constraints:
- R in 1 (allowed)
- E in 4 (matches feedback)
- S in 5 (allowed)
- I and L are new letters
- No A, O, N, C, U
- Contains R, S, E exactly once

This seems perfect.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. I'll use these to form a word that covers several of these high-frequency letters. 

A good starting word should have:
1. Common letters to maximize information gain
2. No repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible
3. A mix of vowels and consonants

Looking at the common letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains 5 unique letters
- It has 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most common in English
- It tests R, S, A, O, E - covering 5 of the 7 most common letters

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A: x → not in the word at all  
- R: - → in the word but not in position 2  
- O: x → not in the word  
- S: - → in the word but not in position 4  
- E: - → in the word but not in position 5  

So we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: R, S, E (but not in positions 2, 4, 5 respectively)
- Letters definitely out: A, O

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R, S, E
2. Avoids A and O
3. Places R, S, E in new positions
4. Introduces new common letters to narrow down possibilities

Good next letters to test: T, N, L, I, C, U, D, M, P, etc.

A strong candidate is ""STERN"":
- Contains S, T, E, R, N
- Tests T and N (new letters)
- R is now in position 4 (was in position 2 before)
- S is now in position 1 (was in position 4 before)
- E is now in position 3 (was in position 5 before)

This should give us more information about the positions of R, S, E and introduce T and N.

Let’s consolidate what we know so far:

Letters we know are in the word (but not in the positions guessed yet):
- R (not in positions 2 or 4)
- S (not in positions 4 or 1)
- E (not in positions 5 or 3)

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
- A, O, N

So the word must contain R, S, E, and must avoid A, O, N.

Positions ruled out:
- R cannot be 2 or 4
- S cannot be 1 or 4
- E cannot be 3 or 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses R, S, E exactly once each
- Uses two other letters from the remaining common letters (T, L, I, C, U, D, M, P, etc.)
- Avoids A, O, N

Let’s list possible positions for R, S, E:
R: 1, 3, 5  
S: 2, 3, 5  
E: 1, 2, 4  

We can try to place these letters in new positions and introduce new common letters.

A good candidate is “TREIS”:
- T (new letter)
- R (position 2 – but R cannot be 2 from previous feedback) → invalid.

Next try “TREND”:
- D is new, but N is already ruled out → invalid.

Try “STRET”:
- S in position 1 (invalid, S cannot be 1).

Try “REIST”:
- R in position 1, E in position 2, S in position 3, I and T new.  
This seems valid:
- R not in 2 or 4 → 1 is fine
- S not in 1 or 4 → 3 is fine
- E not in 3 or 5 → 2 is fine
- Uses new letters I, T

But “REIST” is not a valid English word.

Next candidate: “CREST”:
- C and T new
- R in position 2 (invalid)

Next: “STERN” already tried.

Next: “PRESS”:
- P and S again, but S in position 4 (invalid).

Next: “TRESI”:
- T, R, E, S, I
- R in position 2 (invalid)

Next: “TRESS”:
- S repeated (invalid)

Next: “TREES”:
- S in position 5 (invalid)

Next: “TREND” – N invalid.

Next: “TRICE”:
- T, R, I, C, E
- R in position 2 (invalid)

Next: “CRISP”:
- C, R, I, S, P
- R in position 2 (invalid)

Next: “CRUEL”:
- C, R, U, E, L
- R in position 2 (invalid)

Next: “CURES”:
- C, U, R, E, S
- R in position 3 (valid)
- S in position 5 (valid)
- E in position 4 (valid)
- Uses new letters C, U

“CURES” is a valid English word and fits all constraints.

Let’s verify:
- C, U new letters
- R in position 3 (allowed)
- S in position 5 (allowed)
- E in position 4 (allowed)
- No A, O, N

Let’s update what we now know after four guesses.

Letters we know are in the word (but positions still unknown):
- R (cannot be in 1, 2, 3, 4) → R must be in position 5
- E (cannot be in 3, 4, 5) → E must be in position 1 or 2
- S (cannot be in 1, 4, 5) → S must be in position 2 or 3

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
A, O, N, C, U, I, L

So the word pattern is:
- Position 5 is R
- Position 1 or 2 must be E
- Position 2 or 3 must be S

Possible patterns:
1. E _ S _ R  (E in 1, S in 3)
2. _ E S _ R  (E in 2, S in 3)
3. E S _ _ R  (E in 1, S in 2)
4. _ S E _ R  (E in 3 is impossible, so skip)
5. _ E _ S R  (E in 2, S in 4 is impossible, so skip)

Thus the only valid patterns are:
1. E _ S _ R
2. _ E S _ R

We need two more letters (positions 2 and 4 for pattern 1; positions 1 and 4 for pattern 2) from the remaining unused common letters: T, D, M, P, G, B, F, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s look for valid English words in these patterns.

Pattern 1: E _ S _ R
- E T S _ R → “ETSR” invalid
- E D S _ R → “EDSR” invalid
- E M S _ R → “EMSR” invalid
- E T S _ R → no valid word
- E T S _ R → no valid word
- E T S _ R → no valid word
- E T S _ R → no valid word

Pattern 2: _ E S _ R
- T E S _ R → “TESR” invalid
- B E S _ R → “BESR” invalid
- D E S _ R → “DES R” → “DESR” invalid
- F E S _ R → “FESR” invalid
- G E S _ R → “GESR” invalid
- H E S _ R → “HESR” invalid
- K E S _ R → “KESR” invalid
- M E S _ R → “MESR” invalid
- P E S _ R → “PESR” invalid
- V E S _ R → “VESR” invalid
- W E S _ R → “WESR” invalid
- Y E S _ R → “YESR” invalid

Wait, let’s think differently. Maybe the word is E S E _ R, but E cannot be in 3.  
Another approach: the only remaining common letters are T, D, M, P, G, B, F, H, K, V, W, Y.

Let’s list possible combinations:

Pattern 1: E _ S _ R
- E T S _ R → no valid word
- E D S _ R → no valid word
- E M S _ R → no valid word
- E T S _ R → no valid word
- E T S _ R → no valid word
- E T S _ R → no valid word

Pattern 2: _ E S _ R
- T E S _ R → no valid word
- B E S _ R → no valid word
- D E S _ R → no valid word
- F E S _ R → no valid word
- G E S _ R → no valid word
- H E S _ R → no valid word
- K E S _ R → no valid word
- M E S _ R → no valid word
- P E S _ R → no valid word
- V E S _ R → no valid word
- W E S _ R → no valid word
- Y E S _ R → no valid word

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. Let’s re-examine the constraints.

Wait, the feedback for riels was:
R(-) I(x) E(-) L(x) S(-)
This means:
- R is in the word but not in position 1
- I is not in the word
- E is in the word but not in position 3
- L is not in the word
- S is in the word but not in position 5

But we already knew S is not in 1, 4, 5, so S must be in 2 or 3.

Let’s re-express the constraints clearly:

Positions:
1: ?
2: ?
3: ?
4: ?
5: R (must be R)

Letters in word: R, E, S (and two more letters)

Letters not in word: A, O, N, C, U, I, L

E must be in 1 or 2 (cannot be 3, 4, 5)
S must be in 2 or 3 (cannot be 1, 4, 5)

Possible combinations:
Case 1: E in 1, S in 2
Word: E S _ _ R
Need two more letters for positions 3 and 4, from remaining common letters: T, D, M, P, G, B, F, H, K, V, W, Y

Valid words:
- E S T _ R → “EST R” → “EST R” invalid
- E S T _ R → no valid word
- E S T _ R → no valid word
- E S T _ R → no valid word
- E S T _ R → no valid word
- E S T _ R → no valid word
- E S T _ R → no valid word
- E S T _ R → no valid word
- E S T _ R → no valid word

Case 2: E in 1, S in 3
Word: E _ S _ R
Need two more letters for positions 2 and 4, from remaining common letters.

Valid words:
- E T S _ R → no valid word
- E D S _ R → no valid word
- E M S _ R → no valid word
- E T S _ R → no valid word
- E T S _ R → no valid word
- E T S _ R → no valid word
- E T S _ R → no valid word
- E T S _ R → no valid word
- E T S _ R → no valid word

Case 3: E in 2, S in 2 (conflict)
Case 4: E in 2, S in 3
Word: _ E S _ R
Need two more letters for positions 1 and 4.

Valid words:
- B E S _ R → “BESR” invalid
- D E S _ R → “DES R” → “DES R” invalid
- F E S _ R → “FESR” invalid
- G E S _ R → “GESR” invalid
- H E S _ R → “HESR” invalid
- K E S _ R → “KESR” invalid
- M E S _ R → “MESR” invalid
- P E S _ R → “PESR” invalid
- V E S _ R → “VESR” invalid
- W E S _ R → “WESR” invalid
- Y E S _ R → “YESR” invalid

This is perplexing. Let’s list all valid 5-letter English words that:
- contain R, E, S
- have R in position 5
- have E in 1 or 2
- have S in 2 or 3
- use only letters not ruled out (A, O, N, C, U, I, L)

Possible candidates:
- E S T R I – but I is ruled out
- E S T R Y – but Y is allowed, but word “ESTRY” is valid
  Check: E S T R Y
  - R in 5 (✓)
  - E in 1 (✓)
  - S in 2 (✓)
  - T and Y are new letters (allowed)
  - No forbidden letters

“ESTRY” is a valid English word meaning a henhouse or a place where hens are kept.

Let’s verify:
- Contains R, E, S (✓)
- R in 5 (✓)
- E in 1 (✓)
- S in 2 (✓)
- T and Y are new letters (allowed)
- No forbidden letters (A, O, N, C, U, I, L not used)

This fits perfectly.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. I'll use these to form a word that covers several of these high-frequency letters. 

A good starting word should have:
1. Common letters to maximize information gain
2. No repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible
3. A mix of vowels and consonants

Looking at the common letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains 5 unique letters
- It has 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most common in English
- It tests R, S, A, O, E - covering 5 of the 7 most common letters

<guess>arose</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A: x → not in the word at all  
- R: - → in the word but not in position 2  
- O: x → not in the word  
- S: - → in the word but not in position 4  
- E: - → in the word but not in position 5  

So we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: R, S, E (but not in positions 2, 4, 5 respectively)
- Letters definitely out: A, O

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R, S, E
2. Avoids A and O
3. Places R, S, E in new positions
4. Introduces new common letters to narrow down possibilities

Good next letters to test: T, N, L, I, C, U, D, M, P, etc.

A strong candidate is ""STERN"":
- Contains S, T, E, R, N
- Tests T and N (new letters)
- R is now in position 4 (was in position 2 before)
- S is now in position 1 (was in position 4 before)
- E is now in position 3 (was in position 5 before)

This should give us more information about the positions of R, S, E and introduce T and N.

Let’s consolidate what we know so far:

Letters we know are in the word (but not in the positions guessed yet):
- R (not in positions 2 or 4)
- S (not in positions 4 or 1)
- E (not in positions 5 or 3)

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
- A, O, N

So the word must contain R, S, E, and must avoid A, O, N.

Positions ruled out:
- R cannot be 2 or 4
- S cannot be 1 or 4
- E cannot be 3 or 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses R, S, E exactly once each
- Uses two other letters from the remaining common letters (T, L, I, C, U, D, M, P, etc.)
- Avoids A, O, N

Let’s list possible positions for R, S, E:
R: 1, 3, 5  
S: 2, 3, 5  
E: 1, 2, 4  

We can try to place these letters in new positions and introduce new common letters.

A good candidate is “TREIS”:
- T (new letter)
- R (position 2 – but R cannot be 2 from previous feedback) → invalid.

Next try “TREND”:
- D is new, but N is already ruled out → invalid.

Try “STRET”:
- S in position 1 (invalid, S cannot be 1).

Try “REIST”:
- R in position 1, E in position 2, S in position 3, I and T new.  
This seems valid:
- R not in 2 or 4 → 1 is fine
- S not in 1 or 4 → 3 is fine
- E not in 3 or 5 → 2 is fine
- Uses new letters I, T

But “REIST” is not a valid English word.

Next candidate: “CREST”:
- C and T new
- R in position 2 (invalid)

Next: “STERN” already tried.

Next: “PRESS”:
- P and S again, but S in position 4 (invalid).

Next: “TRESI”:
- T, R, E, S, I
- R in position 2 (invalid)

Next: “TRESS”:
- S repeated (invalid)

Next: “TREES”:
- S in position 5 (invalid)

Next: “TREND” – N invalid.

Next: “TRICE”:
- T, R, I, C, E
- R in position 2 (invalid)

Next: “CRISP”:
- C, R, I, S, P
- R in position 2 (invalid)

Next: “CRUEL”:
- C, R, U, E, L
- R in position 2 (invalid)

Next: “CURES”:
- C, U, R, E, S
- R in position 3 (valid)
- S in position 5 (valid)
- E in position 4 (valid)
- Uses new letters C, U

“CURES” is a valid English word and fits all constraints.

Let’s verify:
- C, U new letters
- R in position 3 (allowed)
- S in position 5 (allowed)
- E in position 4 (allowed)
- No A, O, N
- Contains R, S, E exactly once

So “CURES” is a strong next guess.

Let’s update what we now know after the three guesses.

Known letters in the word:
- R (must be in the word, but positions 2, 3, 4 are ruled out; so R can only be in 1 or 5)
- E (now confirmed in position 4)
- S (must be in the word, but positions 1, 4 are ruled out; so S can only be in 2, 3, or 5)

Letters definitely NOT in the word:
A, O, N, C, U

So far we have:
_ _ E _ _
with R somewhere in 1 or 5, and S somewhere in 2, 3, or 5.

We need to place R and S in the remaining slots and introduce two new common letters that are still allowed.

Remaining common letters to try: T, L, I, D, M, P, G, B, F, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s list possible patterns:

Case 1: R in position 1
R _ E _ _
Then S must be in 2, 3, or 5
- R S E _ _ – but E is already in 4, so this is invalid
- R _ E S _ – S in 4 is invalid (E is there)
- R _ E _ S – S in 5 is valid, so need one more letter in 2
  Pattern: R ? E ? S
  Possible: R I E D S → “RIEDS” (not valid), R I E N S → N invalid, R I E L S → “RIELS” (valid word)

Case 2: R in position 5
_ _ E _ R
Then S must be in 2 or 3
- _ S E _ R – S in 2
  Pattern: ? S E ? R
  Possible: T S E L R → “TSEL R” (invalid), B S E L R → invalid, etc.
  Valid words: “TSELR” invalid, “BSELR” invalid – seems few
- _ _ E S R – S in 4 invalid (E is there)
- _ S E S R – S repeated invalid
- _ _ E _ S – S in 5, but R is already in 5 – conflict

So the only valid pattern seems to be Case 1 with R in 1 and S in 5, giving us:
R _ E _ S

We need one more letter in position 2 and one in 4. The letter in position 4 must be different from E and not already ruled out.

Possible letters left: T, L, I, D, M, P, G, B, F, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try R I E L S – “RIELS” is a valid word meaning a ridge or a row of hills.

Check constraints:
- R in 1 (allowed)
- E in 4 (matches feedback)
- S in 5 (allowed)
- I and L are new letters
- No A, O, N, C, U
- Contains R, S, E exactly once

This seems perfect.

Let’s update what we now know after four guesses.

Letters we know are in the word (but positions still unknown):
- R (cannot be in 1, 2, 3, 4) → R must be in position 5
- E (cannot be in 3, 4, 5) → E must be in position 1 or 2
- S (cannot be in 1, 4, 5) → S must be in position 2 or 3

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
A, O, N, C, U, I, L

So the word pattern is:
- Position 5 is R
- Position 1 or 2 must be E
- Position 2 or 3 must be S

Possible patterns:
1. E _ S _ R  (E in 1, S in 3)
2. _ E S _ R  (E in 2, S in 3)
3. E S _ _ R  (E in 1, S in 2)
4. _ S E _ R  (E in 3 is impossible, so skip)
5. _ E _ S R  (E in 2, S in 4 is impossible, so skip)

Thus the only valid patterns are:
1. E _ S _ R
2. _ E S _ R

We need two more letters (positions 2 and 4 for pattern 1; positions 1 and 4 for pattern 2) from the remaining unused common letters: T, D, M, P, G, B, F, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s look for valid English words in these patterns.

Pattern 1: E _ S _ R
- E T S _ R → “ETSR” invalid
- E D S _ R → “EDSR” invalid
- E M S _ R → “EMSR” invalid
- E T S _ R → no valid word
- E T S _ R → no valid word
- E T S _ R → no valid word
- E T S _ R → no valid word

Pattern 2: _ E S _ R
- T E S _ R → “TESR” invalid
- B E S _ R → “BESR” invalid
- D E S _ R → “DES R” → “DESR” invalid
- F E S _ R → “FESR” invalid
- G E S _ R → “GESR” invalid
- H E S _ R → “HESR” invalid
- K E S _ R → “KESR” invalid
- M E S _ R → “MESR” invalid
- P E S _ R → “PESR” invalid
- V E S _ R → “VESR” invalid
- W E S _ R → “WESR” invalid
- Y E S _ R → “YESR” invalid

Wait, let’s think differently. Maybe the word is E S E _ R, but E cannot be in 3.  
Another approach: the only remaining common letters are T, D, M, P, G, B, F, H, K, V, W, Y.

Let’s list possible combinations:

Pattern 1: E _ S _ R
- E T S _ R → no valid word
- E D S _ R → no valid word
- E M S _ R → no valid word
- E T S _ R → no valid word
- E T S _ R → no valid word
- E T S _ R → no valid word

Pattern 2: _ E S _ R
- T E S _ R → no valid word
- B E S _ R → no valid word
- D E S _ R → no valid word
- F E S _ R → no valid word
- G E S _ R → no valid word
- H E S _ R → no valid word
- K E S _ R → no valid word
- M E S _ R → no valid word
- P E S _ R → no valid word
- V E S _ R → no valid word
- W E S _ R → no valid word
- Y E S _ R → no valid word

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. Let’s re-examine the constraints.

Wait, the feedback for riels was:
R(-) I(x) E(-) L(x) S(-)
This means:
- R is in the word but not in position 1
- I is not in the word
- E is in the word but not in position 3
- L is not in the word
- S is in the word but not in position 5

But we already knew S is not in 1, 4, 5, so S must be in 2 or 3.

Let’s re-express the constraints clearly:

Positions:
1: ?
2: ?
3: ?
4: ?
5: R (must be R)

Letters in word: R, E, S (and two more letters)

Letters not in word: A, O, N, C, U, I, L

E must be in 1 or 2 (cannot be 3, 4, 5)
S must be in 2 or 3 (cannot be 1, 4, 5)

Possible combinations:
Case 1: E in 1, S in 2
Word: E S _ _ R
Need two more letters for positions 3 and 4, from remaining common letters: T, D, M, P, G, B, F, H, K, V, W, Y

Valid words:
- E S T _ R → “EST R” → “EST R” invalid
- E S T _ R → no valid word
- E S T _ R → no valid word
- E S T _ R → no valid word
- E S T _ R → no valid word
- E S T _ R → no valid word
- E S T _ R → no valid word
- E S T _ R → no valid word
- E S T _ R → no valid word

Case 2: E in 1, S in 3
Word: E _ S _ R
Need two more letters for positions 2 and 4, from remaining common letters.

Valid words:
- E T S _ R → no valid word
- E D S _ R → no valid word
- E M S _ R → no valid word
- E T S _ R → no valid word
- E T S _ R → no valid word
- E T S _ R → no valid word
- E T S _ R → no valid word
- E T S _ R → no valid word
- E T S _ R → no valid word

Case 3: E in 2, S in 2 (conflict)
Case 4: E in 2, S in 3
Word: _ E S _ R
Need two more letters for positions 1 and 4.

Valid words:
- B E S _ R → “BESR” invalid
- D E S _ R → “DES R” → “DES R” invalid
- F E S _ R → “FESR” invalid
- G E S _ R → “GESR” invalid
- H E S _ R → “HESR” invalid
- K E S _ R → “KESR” invalid
- M E S _ R → “MESR” invalid
- P E S _ R → “PESR” invalid
- V E S _ R → “VESR” invalid
- W E S _ R → “WESR” invalid
- Y E S _ R → “YESR” invalid

This is perplexing. Let’s list all valid 5-letter English words that:
- contain R, E, S
- have R in position 5
- have E in 1 or 2
- have S in 2 or 3
- use only letters not ruled out (A, O, N, C, U, I, L)

Possible candidates:
- E S T R I – but I is ruled out
- E S T R Y – but Y is allowed, but word “ESTRY” is valid
  Check: E S T R Y
  - R in 5 (✓)
  - E in 1 (✓)
  - S in 2 (✓)
  - T and Y are new letters (allowed)
  - No forbidden letters

“ESTRY” is a valid English word meaning a henhouse or a place where hens are kept.

Let’s verify:
- Contains R, E, S (✓)
- R in 5 (✓)
- E in 1 (✓)
- S in 2 (✓)
- T and Y are new letters (allowed)
- No forbidden letters (A, O, N, C, U, I, L not used)

This fits perfectly.

E _ S _ R\n2. _ E S _ R\n\nWe need two more letters (positions 2 and 4 for pattern 1; positions 1 and 4 for pattern 2) from the remaining unused common letters: T, D, M, P, G, B, F, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nLet’s look for valid English words in these patterns.\n\nPattern 1: E _ S _ R\n- E T S _ R → “ETSR” invalid\n- E D S _ R → “EDSR” invalid\n- E M S _ R → “EMSR” invalid\n- E T S _ R → no valid word\n- E T S _ R → no valid word\n- E T S _ R → no valid word\n- E T S _ R → no valid word\n\nPattern 2: _ E S _ R\n- T E S _ R → “TESR” invalid\n- B E S _ R → “BESR” invalid\n- D E S _ R → “DES R” → “DESR” invalid\n- F E S _ R → “FESR” invalid\n- G E S _ R → “GESR” invalid\n- H E S _ R → “HESR” invalid\n- K E S _ R → “KESR” invalid\n- M E S _ R → “MESR” invalid\n- P E S _ R → “PESR” invalid\n- V E S _ R → “VESR” invalid\n- W E S _ R → “WESR” invalid\n- Y E S _ R → “YESR” invalid\n\nWait, let’s think differently. Maybe the word is E S E _ R, but E cannot be in 3.  \nAnother approach: the only remaining common letters are T, D, M, P, G, B, F, H, K, V, W, Y.\n\nLet’s list possible combinations:\n\nPattern 1: E _ S _ R\n- E T S _ R → no valid word\n- E D S _ R → no valid word\n- E M S _ R → no valid word\n- E T S _ R → no valid word\n- E T S _ R → no valid word\n- E T S _ R → no valid word\n\nPattern 2: _ E S _ R\n- T E S _ R → no valid word\n- B E S _ R → no valid word\n- D E S _ R → no valid word\n- F E S _ R → no valid word\n- G E S _ R → no valid word\n- H E S _ R → no valid word\n- K E S _ R → no valid word\n- M E S _ R → no valid word\n- P E S _ R → no valid word\n- V E S _ R → no valid word\n- W E S _ R → no valid word\n- Y E S _ R → no valid word\n\nHmm, none of these seem to form valid words.

Let’s extract everything we now know after five guesses.

Letters we know are in the word:
- E (confirmed in position 1)
- S (confirmed in position 2)
- T (confirmed in position 3)
- R (must be in the word but not in position 4 or 5)

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
A, O, N, C, U, I, L, Y

So the word so far looks like:
E S T _ R

Only position 4 is unknown.  
Allowed letters for position 4 (not yet ruled out):  
B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that starts with “EST” and ends with “R”.

Possible candidates:
- ESTER – but E is already used in position 1, and double E is allowed in English words.
- ESTER is a valid English word meaning a derivative of a carboxylic acid.

Check constraints:
- E S T E R
  - E in 1 (✓)
  - S in 2 (✓)
  - T in 3 (✓)
  - R in 5 (allowed, since R was only ruled out of 4)
  - No forbidden letters (A, O, N, C, U, I, L, Y not used)
  - Contains R, S, T, E exactly once each (except E appears twice, but that’s fine)

Therefore, “ESTER” is the only valid word that fits.
