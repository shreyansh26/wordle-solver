For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters are present or absent. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters to test more unique letters

This will help me quickly determine which vowels and consonants are in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.

From the three guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)  
   – O is fixed in position 3.  
   – S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. COINS → C(x) O(-) I(x) N(x) S(-)  
   – O is in the word but not in position 2 (confirmed by AROSE it’s in position 3).  
   – S is in the word but not in position 5.

3. STOMP → S(✓) T(x) O(✓) M(x) P(x)  
   – S is fixed in position 1.  
   – O is fixed in position 3.  
   – T, M, P are not in the word.

So the pattern is now: S _ O _ _

Letters already excluded: A, R, E, C, I, N, T, M, P.

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, L, K, V, W, Y  
Remaining common vowels: U (since A, E, I are out and O is used).

We need two more letters for positions 2 and 4.  
Position 2: any unused consonant or U.  
Position 4: any unused consonant or U.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters are present or absent. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters to test more unique letters

This will help me quickly determine which vowels and consonants are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.
- R(x) → R is NOT in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in the word AND in the correct position (3rd letter).
- S(-) → S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 4, so it must be in positions 1, 2, or 5).
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ O _ _
- Contains S (but not in position 4)
- Does NOT contain A, R, E

Next guess should:
1. Keep the O in position 3.
2. Test S in a new position (positions 1, 2, or 5).
3. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tested yet.

A good candidate is “POINT”:
- P and N are new letters.
- I is a new vowel.
- T is a new consonant.
- It places S in position 2 (new position) and keeps O in position 3.

However, we need to check if S is in the word. Since we know S is present but not in position 4, we can test it in position 2. 

Another good candidate is “COINS”:
- C and N are new.
- I is a new vowel.
- S is in position 5 (new position).
- O is in position 3 (correct).

This tests S in position 5 and introduces C, I, N.

I’ll go with COINS.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: COINS -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(-) I(x) N(x) S(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two pieces of feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
   - O is in the correct 3rd position.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - A, R, E are not in the word.

2. COINS → C(x) O(-) I(x) N(x) S(-)
   - O is in the word but not in position 2 (already known to be in position 3).
   - S is in the word but not in position 5 (already known to be in positions 1, 2, or 3 or 4? Wait, feedback says S(-) in position 5, so S is not in position 5).
   - C, I, N are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ _
- S is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5 (from AROSE and COINS). Therefore S must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- Letters excluded so far: A, R, E, C, I, N.
- Position 3 is O.

We need to place S in position 1, 2, or 3. Position 3 is already O, so S must be in position 1 or 2.

Let’s try S in position 1:
- Pattern: S _ O _ _
- We need two new consonants and one new vowel (since O is already used and A, E, I are excluded).
- Common remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, T, U, Y, etc.
- A good candidate is “STOMP”:
  - S in position 1 (new position).
  - T, O, M, P are new letters.
  - O is in position 3 (correct).
  - P and M are new consonants.
  - T is a new consonant.

This tests S in position 1, introduces T, M, P, and keeps O in position 3.

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
   - O is in position 3.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. COINS → C(x) O(-) I(x) N(x) S(-)
   - O is in the word but not in position 2 (already known to be in position 3).
   - S is in the word but not in position 5 (already known to be in positions 1, 2, or 3).

3. STOMP → S(✓) T(x) O(✓) M(x) P(x)
   - S is in position 1 (correct).
   - O is in position 3 (correct).
   - T, M, P are not in the word.

Current pattern: S _ O _ _

Letters already excluded: A, R, E, C, I, N, T, M, P.

Remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, L, U, Y, etc.

We need two more consonants and one more vowel. Since we have S and O fixed, and the remaining vowels are U (common) and Y (sometimes vowel), let’s try:

S U O _ _  → but we need two more letters. Let’s pick common consonants.

Good candidates: S U O D Y, S U O L D, S U O L Y, S U O L D, etc.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters are present or absent. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters to test more unique letters

This will help me quickly determine which vowels and consonants are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.
- R(x) → R is NOT in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in the word AND in the correct position (3rd letter).
- S(-) → S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 4, so it must be in positions 1, 2, or 5).
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ O _ _
- Contains S (but not in position 4)
- Does NOT contain A, R, E

Next guess should:
1. Keep the O in position 3.
2. Test S in a new position (positions 1, 2, or 5).
3. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tested yet.

A good candidate is “POINT”:
- P and N are new letters.
- I is a new vowel.
- T is a new consonant.
- It places S in position 2 (new position) and keeps O in position 3.

However, we need to check if S is in the word. Since we know S is present but not in position 4, we can test it in position 2. 

Another good candidate is “COINS”:
- C and N are new.
- I is a new vowel.
- S is in position 5 (new position).
- O is in position 3 (correct).

This tests S in position 5 and introduces C, I, N.

I’ll go with COINS.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: COINS -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(-) I(x) N(x) S(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two pieces of feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
   - O is in the correct 3rd position.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - A, R, E are not in the word.

2. COINS → C(x) O(-) I(x) N(x) S(-)
   - O is in the word but not in position 2 (already known to be in position 3).
   - S is in the word but not in position 5 (already known to be in positions 1, 2, or 3 or 4? Wait, feedback says S(-) in position 5, so S is not in position 5).
   - C, I, N are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ _
- S is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5 (from AROSE and COINS). Therefore S must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- Letters excluded so far: A, R, E, C, I, N.
- Position 3 is O.

We need to place S in position 1, 2, or 3. Position 3 is already O, so S must be in position 1 or 2.

Let’s try S in position 1:
- Pattern: S _ O _ _
- We need two new consonants and one new vowel (since O is already used and A, E, I are excluded).
- Common remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, T, U, Y, etc.
- A good candidate is “STOMP”:
  - S in position 1 (new position).
  - T, O, M, P are new letters.
  - O is in position 3 (correct).
  - P and M are new consonants.
  - T is a new consonant.

This tests S in position 1, introduces T, M, P, and keeps O in position 3.

A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters are present or absent.

Current known facts:
- Pattern: S _ O _ _
- Letters known NOT in the word: A, R, E, C, I, N, T, M, P
- Letters still available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
- We need two more letters (positions 2 and 5) from the available set.

Since we need a common English word, let’s pick two common remaining consonants. Good candidates: B, D, F, G, H, L, K, etc.

Possible words:
- S B O D _  → “SBOGD” (invalid)
- S H O W _  → “SHOW_” (but “SHOW” is 4 letters)
- S H O U L  → “SHOUL” (invalid)
- S H O W S  → “SHOWS” (valid 5-letter word, S already used twice, but allowed)
- S H O W S  fits the pattern S _ O _ _ and uses new letters H and W.

Check if H and W are available (yes, not excluded). “SHOWS” is a valid word.
