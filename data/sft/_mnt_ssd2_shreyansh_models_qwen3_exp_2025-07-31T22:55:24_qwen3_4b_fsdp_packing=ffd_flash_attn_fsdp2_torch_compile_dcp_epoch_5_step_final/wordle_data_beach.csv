### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters without repeating any letters. The word ""AROSE"" is a strong candidate because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives me a good chance to identify multiple letters and their positions in the secret word on the first guess.

3. Places A and E in new positions to test them
4. Introduces new common letters to narrow down possibilities

Good new letters to try: T, N, L, C, I, D, U, M, P, etc.

A candidate word that fits these criteria is ""EATIN"":
- E (position 1) - new position for E
- A (position 2) - new position for A
- T, I, N - new common letters
But ""EATIN"" isn't a valid 5-letter word.

Another candidate: ""EATEN""
- E (position 1) - new position for E

""EATEN"" is a valid word and fits all constraints.

- Does not contain R, O, S, T, N
- A is in position 3, 4, or 5
- E is in position 2, 3, or 5

Good remaining common letters to try: L, I, C, U, D, M, P, Y, B, G, H, K, F, W, V, X, Z (but we want common ones).

Let’s look for words that fit:
- A and E must be present
- No R, O, S, T, N
- A not in 1 or 2
- E not in 1 or 4

Possible positions:
- A: 3, 4, 5
- E: 2, 3, 5

Let’s try “EACHY” – but Y is less common and we have no info on it yet.
“EACHY” uses E, A, C, H, Y – but C and H are new letters, and positions:
E(1) – but E cannot be in 1
So discard.

Next candidate: “EACID” – but D is new, and positions:
E(1) again – invalid.

Next: “EAGLE” – but L is new, and positions:
E(1) again – invalid.

Next: “EAMEN” – N is ruled out.

- Contains A and E
- No R, O, S, T, N
- A is in position 3 (allowed)

This seems valid. Let’s check:
