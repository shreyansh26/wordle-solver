1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess should ideally include several of these common letters to quickly narrow down possibilities.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)

This combination gives us a high chance of hitting at least one or two correct letters in the secret word, providing valuable feedback for subsequent guesses. Other strong first guesses could include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"", but ""AROSE"" is particularly effective due to its mix of vowels and common consonants.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-): the letter A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): O is not in the word.
- S(x): S is not in the word.
- E(✓): the letter E is in the word and in the correct 5th position.

So the secret word ends with E and contains A somewhere (but not first). Also, we now know that R, O, S are not in the word.

Next step: choose a word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Contains A (but not in position 1).
3. Avoids R, O, S entirely.

Looking at common 5-letter words ending in E and containing A:
- TABLE – but T and L are possible, but we need to avoid R, O, S.
- CADET – C, D, T are possible, but A is in position 2, which is fine.
- VAGUE – but U is a vowel, and we already know E is present.
- PLATE – P, L, T are possible.
- GAFFE – G, F are possible.

A balanced choice that covers new common consonants and places A in a new position is ""PLATE"":
- P and L are common consonants.
- A is in position 2 (allowed since A is only known to be wrong in position 1).
- E is in position 5 (already confirmed correct).
- Avoids R, O, S.

This should give us good information about P, L, and the placement of A.

Let's consolidate what we know so far:

1. The word ends with E (position 5 is E).
2. The word contains A, but A is NOT in positions 1 or 3 (from arose and plate feedback).
3. The word does NOT contain R, O, S, P, T.
4. The word contains L, but L is NOT in position 2 (from plate feedback).

So far we have:
- _ _ _ _ E
- A is in position 2, 4, or 5 (but 5 is E), so A is in 2 or 4.
- L is in position 1, 3, or 5 (but 5 is E), so L is in 1 or 3.
- Forbidden letters: R, O, S, P, T.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E.
- Contains A in position 2 or 4.
- Contains L in position 1 or 3.
- Uses only allowed letters.

Let's try to build possible words:

Case 1: A in position 2
Then the word looks like: _ A _ _ E
We need L in position 1 or 3.
- If L in position 1: L A _ _ E
  - Need two more letters (positions 3 and 4) from allowed letters (not R, O, S, P, T).
  - Common consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, V, W, Y, etc.
  - Possible words: LACKE (but K and E are allowed, but LACKE is not a valid word), LAMBE, LANCE (but N is allowed), LANCE is valid.
  - LANCE: L A N C E – checks out: ends with E, contains A in position 2, contains L in position 1, uses only allowed letters.

Case 2: A in position 4
Then the word looks like: _ _ _ A E
We need L in position 1 or 3.
- If L in position 1: L _ _ A E
  - Need two more letters (positions 2 and 3) from allowed letters.
  - Possible words: LABBE (but B is allowed), LACAE (not valid), LAMAE (not valid), LANGE (valid).
  - LANGE: L A N G E – but A is in position 2 here, not 4. So this doesn't fit.
  - Actually, LANGE has A in position 2, so this doesn't fit the A in position 4 case.
  - So L _ _ A E: L A _ A E – but A can't repeat in position 4 if A is already in 2, but we don't know if A repeats. However, common words don't repeat A in this position.
  - Another possibility: L _ _ A E: L U _ A E – but U is allowed, but we need common consonants.
  - L U N A E – but LUNAE is not a word.
  - L U C A E – not valid.
  - So this case seems less promising.

Therefore, the most promising word is LANCE.

Let's verify:

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-): the letter A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): O is not in the word.
- S(x): S is not in the word.
- E(✓): the letter E is in the word and in the correct 5th position.

So the secret word ends with E and contains A somewhere (but not first). Also, we now know that R, O, S are not in the word.

Next step: choose a word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Contains A (but not in position 1).
3. Avoids R, O, S entirely.

Looking at common 5-letter words ending in E and containing A:
- TABLE – but T and L are possible, but we need to avoid R, O, S.
- CADET – C, D, T are possible, but A is in position 2, which is fine.
- VAGUE – but U is a vowel, and we already know E is present.
- PLATE – P, L, T are possible.
- GAFFE – G, F are possible.

A balanced choice that covers new common consonants and places A in a new position is ""PLATE"":
- P and L are common consonants.
- A is in position 2 (allowed since A is only known to be wrong in position 1).
- E is in position 5 (already confirmed correct).
- Avoids R, O, S.

This should give us good information about P, L, and the placement of A.

Let's consolidate what we know so far:

1. The word ends with E (position 5 is E).
2. The word contains A, but A is NOT in positions 1 or 3 (from arose and plate feedback).
3. The word does NOT contain R, O, S, P, T.
4. The word contains L, but L is NOT in position 2 (from plate feedback).

So far we have:
- _ _ _ _ E
- A is in position 2, 4, or 5 (but 5 is E), so A is in 2 or 4.
- L is in position 1, 3, or 5 (but 5 is E), so L is in 1 or 3.
- Forbidden letters: R, O, S, P, T.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E.
- Contains A in position 2 or 4.
- Contains L in position 1 or 3.
- Uses only allowed letters.

Let's try to build possible words:

Case 1: A in position 2
Then the word looks like: _ A _ _ E
We need L in position 1 or 3.
- If L in position 1: L A _ _ E
  - Need two more letters (positions 3 and 4) from allowed letters (not R, O, S, P, T).
  - Common consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, V, W, Y, etc.
  - Possible words: LACKE (but K and E are allowed, but LACKE is not a valid word), LAMBE, LANCE (but N is allowed), LANCE is valid.
  - LANCE: L A N C E – checks out: ends with E, contains A in position 2, contains L in position 1, uses only allowed letters.

Case 2: A in position 4
Then the word looks like: _ _ _ A E
We need L in position 1 or 3.
- If L in position 1: L _ _ A E
  - Need two more letters (positions 2 and 3) from allowed letters.
  - Possible words: LABBE (but B is allowed), LACAE (not valid), LAMAE (not valid), LANGE (valid).
  - LANGE: L A N G E – but A is in position 2 here, not 4. So this doesn't fit.
  - Actually, LANGE has A in position 2, so this doesn't fit the A in position 4 case.
  - So L _ _ A E: L A _ A E – but A can't repeat in position 4 if A is already in 2, but we don't know if A repeats. However, common words don't repeat A in this position.
  - Another possibility: L _ _ A E: L U _ A E – but U is allowed, but we need common consonants.
  - L U N A E – but LUNAE is not a word.
  - L U C A E – not valid.
  - So this case seems less promising.

Therefore, the most promising word is LANCE.

Let's verify:
- LANCE ends with E: ✓
- Contains A in position 2: ✓
- Contains L in position 1: ✓
- Does not contain any forbidden letters (R, O, S, P, T): ✓
- Is a valid 5-letter English word: ✓

Let's update our knowledge after the third guess:

1. Word ends with E (position 5).
2. Contains A, and now we know A is in position 2 (from lance feedback: A(✓) in position 2).
