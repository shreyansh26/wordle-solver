### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Words like ""AROSE,"" ""SLATE,"" or ""CRANE"" are popular choices. 

""AROSE"" is a good first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This helps quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word. 

However, since we want to avoid any bias towards specific letters, another strong option is ""SLATE"" which also covers common letters. 

Between these, ""AROSE"" gives slightly better coverage of vowels, so I'll go with that.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S but not in position 4 (where it appeared in AROSE).
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

Next step: pick a word that:
1. Includes S (but not in position 4).
2. Avoids A, R, O, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants to test: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

Possible candidate: ""STUNT""
- Contains S (not in position 4).
- Avoids A, R, O, E.
- Tests T, U, N (common letters).

Another candidate: ""SULKY"" - but Y is less common.
""SPIKY"" - but K is less common.
""SWING"" - G is less common.

""STUNT"" seems optimal.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Words like ""AROSE,"" ""SLATE,"" or ""CRANE"" are popular choices. 

""AROSE"" is a good first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This helps quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word. 

However, since we want to avoid any bias towards specific letters, another strong option is ""SLATE"" which also covers common letters. 

Between these, ""AROSE"" gives slightly better coverage of vowels, so I'll go with that.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S but not in position 4 (where it appeared in AROSE).
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

Next step: pick a word that:
1. Includes S (but not in position 4).
2. Avoids A, R, O, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants to test: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

Possible candidate: ""STUNT""
- Contains S (not in position 4).
- Avoids A, R, O, E.
- Tests T, U, N (common letters).

Another candidate: ""SULKY"" - but Y is less common.
""SPIKY"" - but K is less common.
""SWING"" - G is less common.

""STUNT"" seems optimal.

Current constraints:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, N
- Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions: S, T, U
- Positions already ruled out:
  – S cannot be in positions 1 or 4
  – T cannot be in positions 2 or 5
  – U cannot be in position 3

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S, T, U (each at least once)
2. Uses none of A, R, O, E, N
3. Places S, T, U in new, still-allowed positions

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: I (since A, O, E are out and U is already used)

Let’s try to place S, T, U in new spots:
- S could go in 2, 3, or 5
- T could go in 1, 3, or 4
- U could go in 1, 2, 4, or 5

A good candidate is “BUILD”:
- Contains B, U, I, L, D
- Uses none of the forbidden letters (A, R, O, E, N)
- Places:
  – U in position 2 (new spot)
  – I in position 3 (new vowel)
  – B, L, D in positions 1, 4, 5 (new consonants)

This tests new letters while respecting the constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Words like ""AROSE,"" ""SLATE,"" or ""CRANE"" are popular choices. 

""AROSE"" is a good first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This helps quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word. 

However, since we want to avoid any bias towards specific letters, another strong option is ""SLATE"" which also covers common letters. 

Between these, ""AROSE"" gives slightly better coverage of vowels, so I'll go with that.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S but not in position 4 (where it appeared in AROSE).
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

Next step: pick a word that:
1. Includes S (but not in position 4).
2. Avoids A, R, O, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants to test: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

Possible candidate: ""STUNT""
- Contains S (not in position 4).
- Avoids A, R, O, E.
- Tests T, U, N (common letters).

Another candidate: ""SULKY"" - but Y is less common.
""SPIKY"" - but K is less common.
""SWING"" - G is less common.

""STUNT"" seems optimal.

Current constraints:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, N
- Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions: S, T, U
- Positions already ruled out:
  – S cannot be in positions 1 or 4
  – T cannot be in positions 2 or 5
  – U cannot be in position 3

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S, T, U (each at least once)
2. Uses none of A, R, O, E, N
3. Places S, T, U in new, still-allowed positions

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: I (since A, O, E are out and U is already used)

Let’s try to place S, T, U in new spots:
- S could go in 2, 3, or 5
- T could go in 1, 3, or 4
- U could go in 1, 2, 4, or 5

A good candidate is “BUILD”:
- Contains B, U, I, L, D
- Uses none of the forbidden letters (A, R, O, E, N)
- Places:
  – U in position 2 (new spot)
  – I in position 3 (new vowel)
  – B, L, D in positions 1, 4, 5 (new consonants)

This tests new letters while respecting the constraints.

- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, N, B, I, L, D
- Letters that ARE in the word and their correct positions:
  – U must be in position 2
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: S, T
- Forbidden positions so far:
  – S cannot be in 1 or 4
  – T cannot be in 2 or 5
- Allowed positions for S: 2, 3, 5
  – But position 2 is already taken by U, so S must be in 3 or 5
- Allowed positions for T: 1, 3, 4
- Allowed letters left (excluding all eliminated ones): C, F, G, H, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the confirmed S, T, U.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has U in position 2.
2. Contains S and T somewhere in the remaining positions (3 or 5 for S, 1, 3, or 4 for T).
3. Uses only allowed letters.

Let’s list possible patterns:
- _ U _ _ _  (position 2 fixed)
- S and T must fit in the other four positions, respecting their forbidden spots.

Possible placements:
- If S is in position 3: _ U S _ _
  – T must be in 1 or 4
- If S is in position 5: _ U _ _ S
  – T must be in 1 or 3 or 4

Let’s try:
- _ U T _ S  (T in 3, S in 5)
  – Need two more letters from allowed set (C, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z)
  – A simple word: M U T A S  → but A is forbidden.
  – Try C U T S _  → need a fifth letter; no common word.
- _ U S _ T  (S in 3, T in 5)
  – Need two more letters; common word: C U S P T  → no.
  – Try C U S T _  → need a fifth letter; no.
- _ U _ T S  (S in 5, T in 4)
  – Need two more letters; common word: M U C K S  → K and C are allowed.
  – M U C K S  – check letters: M, U, C, K, S – none are forbidden. Also, positions:
    – U is correct in position 2.
    – S is in position 5 (allowed).
    – T is not used here, but we know T must be in the word. So this is invalid.
  – Try _ U _ S T  (S in 4, T in 5) – but S cannot be in 4.
- _ U _ T S  (S in 5, T in 4)
  – Need two more letters; common word: C U G G S  → but G is allowed, and we need T somewhere. Not valid.
- _ U _ _ S  (S in 5)
  – T must be in 1, 3, or 4
  – Try T U _ _ S  → need two more letters; common word: T U C K S  – T in 1, U in 2, C in 3, K in 4, S in 5 – none are forbidden. Check positions:
    – U is correct in 2.
    – T is in 1 (allowed).
    – S is in 5 (allowed).
    – C and K are allowed.
    – This is a valid word: TUCKS.

Let’s verify TUCKS against all constraints:
- Letters: T, U, C, K, S – none are in the forbidden list (A, R, O, E, N, B, I, L, D).
- U is in position 2 (✓).
- S is in position 5 (allowed, since S cannot be in 1 or 4).
- T is in position 1 (allowed, since T cannot be in 2 or 5).
- C and K are new letters to test.
- It is a valid 5-letter English word.

Therefore, TUCKS is a strong next guess.

From the feedback on MUSTY:
- M is NOT in the word (x).
- U is in the correct position (✓) → position 2 is U.
- S is in the correct position (✓) → position 3 is S.
- T is in the correct position (✓) → position 4 is T.
- Y is in the correct position (✓) → position 5 is Y.

So the secret word is now fully determined as:
_ U S T Y

We only need to find the first letter. The remaining allowed letters (from the alphabet excluding all eliminated ones: A, R, O, E, N, B, I, L, D, C, K, M) are F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that starts with one of these consonants and ends with ""USTY"". The only common word that fits is ""FUSTY"" – but this is not a standard English word. Checking other possibilities:
- GUSTY – G is allowed, and GUSTY is a recognized word.
- HUSTY – H is allowed, HUSTY is a surname but not common.
- PUSTY – not a word.
- VUSTY – not a word.
- WUSTY – not a word.
- JUSTY – not a word.

GUSTY is the only valid common word that fits.

Therefore, the next (and final) guess is GUSTY.
