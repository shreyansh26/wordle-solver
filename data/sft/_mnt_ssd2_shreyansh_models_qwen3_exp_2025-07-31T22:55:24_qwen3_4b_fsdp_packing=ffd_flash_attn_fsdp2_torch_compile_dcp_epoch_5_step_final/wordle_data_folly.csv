### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is a strong first choice because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives me maximum information about different letters and their positions, which will help narrow down possibilities efficiently.

From the feedback on “arose” we now know:
- A, R, S, E are **not** in the secret word at all.
- O is **in the word** but **not in the 3rd position**.

So the secret word:
- Contains O, but not in position 3.
- Does **not** contain A, R, S, E.

Next I want a word that:
1. Keeps the known letter O in a new position (1, 2, 4, or 5).
2. Avoids all eliminated letters (A, R, S, E).
3. Introduces new common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, Y  
Good remaining vowels: I, U, O (we already know O is in the word)

I’ll pick a word that places O in a new position and uses other common letters.  
“POINT” uses:
- P, N, T (common consonants)
- O (known to be in the word)
- I (another vowel we haven’t tested)

This should help confirm or eliminate P, N, T, I while re-locating O.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is a strong first choice because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives me maximum information about different letters and their positions, which will help narrow down possibilities efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose” we now know:
- A, R, S, E are **not** in the secret word at all.
- O is **in the word** but **not in the 3rd position**.

So the secret word:
- Contains O, but not in position 3.
- Does **not** contain A, R, S, E.

Next I want a word that:
1. Keeps the known letter O in a new position (1, 2, 4, or 5).
2. Avoids all eliminated letters (A, R, S, E).
3. Introduces new common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, Y  
Good remaining vowels: I, U, O (we already know O is in the word)

I’ll pick a word that places O in a new position and uses other common letters.  
“POINT” uses:
- P, N, T (common consonants)
- O (known to be in the word)
- I (another vowel we haven’t tested)

This should help confirm or eliminate P, N, T, I while re-locating O.

From the two rounds of feedback:

2. point → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)  
   - Letters eliminated: P, I, N, T  
   - Letter confirmed present and in the correct position: O in position 2

So the secret word is:
- 5 letters long  
- Contains O in position 2  
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T  

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, Y, W, etc.

I need a word with O in position 2 and no eliminated letters.  
Good candidates:  
- B O _ _ _ → “BOBBY” (but repeats B, unlikely)  
- C O _ _ _ → “COULD” (but D and L are still possible)  
- D O _ _ _ → “DOUBT” (but T is eliminated)

- M O _ _ _ → “MOULD” (U and D still possible)  
- U O _ _ _ → “USAGE” (S and A eliminated)

From the feedback on “arose” we now know:

Next I want a word that:
1. Keeps the known letter O in a new position (1, 2, 4, or 5).
2. Avoids all eliminated letters (A, R, S, E).
3. Introduces new common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, Y  
Good remaining vowels: I, U, O (we already know O is in the word)

I’ll pick a word that places O in a new position and uses other common letters.  
“POINT” uses:
- P, N, T (common consonants)
- O (known to be in the word)
- I (another vowel we haven’t tested)

This should help confirm or eliminate P, N, T, I while re-locating O.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   - Letters eliminated: A, R, S, E  
   - Letter confirmed present but wrong position: O (cannot be in position 3)

2. point → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)  
   - Letters eliminated: P, I, N, T  
   - Letter confirmed present and in the correct position: O in position 2

So the secret word is:
- 5 letters long  
- Contains O in position 2  
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T  

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, Y, W, etc.

I need a word with O in position 2 and no eliminated letters.  
Good candidates:  
- B O _ _ _ → “BOBBY” (but repeats B, unlikely)  
- C O _ _ _ → “COULD” (but D and L are still possible)  
- D O _ _ _ → “DOUBT” (but T is eliminated)  
- F O _ _ _ → “FOGGY” (G and Y still possible)  
- G O _ _ _ → “GOLLY” (L repeats)  
- H O _ _ _ → “HOMER” (but M and R are still possible, R is eliminated)  
- L O _ _ _ → “LOSER” (S is eliminated)  
- M O _ _ _ → “MOULD” (U and D still possible)  
- U O _ _ _ → “USAGE” (S and A eliminated)  

Best choice: “COULD” uses C, O (confirmed), U, L, D – none of which are eliminated and gives new info on C, U, L, D.

Let’s go with COULD.

From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   - Eliminated letters: A, R, S, E  
   - O is in the word but **not** in position 3.

2. point → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)  
   - Eliminated letters: P, I, N, T  
   - O is confirmed in position 2.

3. could → C(x) O(✓) U(x) L(✓) D(x)  
   - Eliminated letters: C, U, D  
   - L is confirmed in position 4.

So the secret word has the pattern: _ O _ L _  
Letters still allowed: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus any others not yet ruled out).

We need a 5-letter word that fits “_ O _ L _” and uses only the allowed letters.  
Possible candidates:
- BOBLY → not a valid word  
- FOGLY → not a valid word  
- HOMLY → not a valid word  
- JOLLY → uses J, O, L, L, Y – but Y is still allowed and repeats L which is already confirmed.  
- GOLLY → uses G, O, L, L, Y – same issue with L repeat.  
- BOLLY → uses B, O, L, L, Y – same issue.  
- MOBLY → not a valid word.

A valid word that fits: JOLLY.  
It uses J, O, L, L, Y – none of which are eliminated, and it places L in position 4 as required.

Let’s go with JOLLY.

Current confirmed facts:
- Word pattern: _ O L L Y (positions 2, 4, 5 are O, L, Y)
- Eliminated letters so far: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, C, U, D, J
- Still-allowed letters for positions 1 and 3: B, F, G, H, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z (plus any others not yet ruled out)

We need a 5-letter word that starts with one of these allowed letters and has the pattern ? O L L Y.

Scanning the dictionary for such words:
- B O L L Y → ""bolly"" (British slang for a young woman, valid word)
- F O L L Y → ""folly"" (valid)
- G O L L Y → ""golly"" (valid)
- H O L L Y → ""holly"" (valid)
- M O L L Y → ""molly"" (valid)

All these fit perfectly. Among them, ""holly"" is the most common English word, so I'll choose that.
