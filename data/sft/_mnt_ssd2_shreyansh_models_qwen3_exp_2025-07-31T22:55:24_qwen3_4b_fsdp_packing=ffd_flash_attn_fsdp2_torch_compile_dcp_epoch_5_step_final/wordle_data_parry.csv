For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
- It contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
- All letters are distinct, maximizing information gain
- These letters appear in many English words, so we'll get good feedback regardless of the secret word
- It's a valid 5-letter word

This will give me a good starting point to narrow down possibilities based on which letters are present or absent.

Let's consolidate the information we have so far.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O, S, E are not in the word.

From Guess 2 (TRAIL):
- T, I, L are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (consistent with previous feedback).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (so A must be in positions 2, 4, or 5).

Therefore, the secret word:
- Contains A (positions 2, 4, or 5)
- Contains R (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5)
- Does NOT contain: O, S, E, T, I, L

Remaining common letters we haven't ruled out: N, U, D, C, M, P, G, H, Y, K, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and R in allowed positions.
2. Uses only allowed letters (no O, S, E, T, I, L).
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Possible candidate: ""NURAR"" - but this repeats R and is unlikely.
Better candidate: ""CRANK"" - but K is less common and we haven't tested it.
Another candidate: ""MURAN"" - but U is common and N is common, and positions are open.

Wait, let's think systematically:
- A must be in 2, 4, or 5.
- R must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- Other letters must be from the remaining pool.

A good word that fits is ""CRAZY"":
- C, R, A, Z, Y
- R is in position 2 (allowed, since previous R was not in position 2 and this is a new position).
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since previous A was not in position 3).
- Uses common letters C, Z, Y.

But Z is less common. Another good candidate is ""MURAL"":
- M, U, R, A, L - but L is ruled out.

""CRANE"" is out.

""GRAPE"" - E is ruled out.

""GRAVY"" - V is less common.

""GRAFT"" - T is ruled out.

""GRAIN"" - I is ruled out.

""GRAND"" - D is common, N is common, A is in position 3 (allowed), R is in position 2 (allowed).

Wait, GRAND:
- G, R, A, N, D
- R is in position 2 (allowed, since previous R was not in position 2 and this is a new position).
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since previous A was not in position 3).
- Uses common letters G, N, D.

This seems like a solid next guess.

Let me verify:
- Does it use only allowed letters? G, R, A, N, D - none of O, S, E, T, I, L are present.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
- It contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
- All letters are distinct, maximizing information gain
- These letters appear in many English words, so we'll get good feedback regardless of the secret word
- It's a valid 5-letter word

This will give me a good starting point to narrow down possibilities based on which letters are present or absent.

- R is in the word but not in position 2 (consistent with previous feedback).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (so A must be in positions 2, 4, or 5).

Therefore, the secret word:
- Contains A (positions 2, 4, or 5)
- Contains R (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5)
- Does NOT contain: O, S, E, T, I, L

Remaining common letters we haven't ruled out: N, U, D, C, M, P, G, H, Y, K, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and R in allowed positions.
2. Uses only allowed letters (no O, S, E, T, I, L).
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Possible candidate: ""NURAR"" - but this repeats R and is unlikely.
Better candidate: ""CRANK"" - but K is less common and we haven't tested it.
Another candidate: ""MURAN"" - but U is common and N is common, and positions are open.

Wait, let's think systematically:
- A must be in 2, 4, or 5.
- R must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- Other letters must be from the remaining pool.

A good word that fits is ""CRAZY"":
- C, R, A, Z, Y
- R is in position 2 (allowed, since previous R was not in position 2 and this is a new position).
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since previous A was not in position 3).
- Uses common letters C, Z, Y.

But Z is less common. Another good candidate is ""MURAL"":
- M, U, R, A, L - but L is ruled out.

""CRANE"" - but E is ruled out.

""GRAIN"" - I and N are possible, but I is ruled out.

""CARDS"" - S is ruled out.

""CRANK"" - K is less common.

""CRAMP"" - P is less common.

""CRANE"" - E is ruled out.

""CRANE"" is out.

""GRAPE"" - E is ruled out.

""GRAVY"" - V is less common.

""GRAFT"" - T is ruled out.

""GRAIN"" - I is ruled out.

""GRAND"" - D is common, N is common, A is in position 3 (allowed), R is in position 2 (allowed).

Wait, GRAND:
- G, R, A, N, D
- R is in position 2 (allowed, since previous R was not in position 2 and this is a new position).
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since previous A was not in position 3).
- Uses common letters G, N, D.

This seems like a solid next guess.

Let me verify:
- Does it use only allowed letters? G, R, A, N, D - none of O, S, E, T, I, L are present.
- R is in position 2 (new position).
- A is in position 3 (new position).

Yes, this should give us good information.

From Guess 3 (GRAND):

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
- It contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
- All letters are distinct, maximizing information gain
- These letters appear in many English words, so we'll get good feedback regardless of the secret word
- It's a valid 5-letter word

This will give me a good starting point to narrow down possibilities based on which letters are present or absent.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(x) → O is not in the word
- S(x) → S is not in the word
- E(x) → E is not in the word

So the secret word:
- Contains A (but not at position 1)
- Contains R (but not at position 2)
- Does NOT contain O, S, or E

I want a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and R in different positions
2. Avoids O, S, E
3. Uses common remaining letters to maximize information

Good remaining common letters: T, N, L, I, C, U, D, M, P, etc.

A good candidate is ""TRAIL"":
- T, R, A, I, L
- R is now in position 2 (was position 2 in AROSE, so this tests R in a new position)
- A is now in position 3 (was position 1 in AROSE)
- Avoids O, S, E
- Uses common letters T and L

This should give us good new information.

Let's consolidate the information we have so far.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O, S, E are not in the word.

From Guess 2 (TRAIL):
- T, I, L are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (consistent with previous feedback).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (so A must be in positions 2, 4, or 5).

Therefore, the secret word:
- Contains A (positions 2, 4, or 5)
- Contains R (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5)
- Does NOT contain: O, S, E, T, I, L

Remaining common letters we haven't ruled out: N, U, D, C, M, P, G, H, Y, K, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and R in allowed positions.
2. Uses only allowed letters (no O, S, E, T, I, L).
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Possible candidate: ""NURAR"" - but this repeats R and is unlikely.
Better candidate: ""CRANK"" - but K is less common and we haven't tested it.
Another candidate: ""MURAN"" - but U is common and N is common, and positions are open.

Wait, let's think systematically:
- A must be in 2, 4, or 5.
- R must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- Other letters must be from the remaining pool.

A good word that fits is ""CRAZY"":
- C, R, A, Z, Y
- R is in position 2 (allowed, since previous R was not in position 2 and this is a new position).
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since previous A was not in position 3).
- Uses common letters C, Z, Y.

But Z is less common. Another good candidate is ""MURAL"":
- M, U, R, A, L - but L is ruled out.

""CRANE"" - but E is ruled out.

""GRAIN"" - I and N are possible, but I is ruled out.

""CARDS"" - S is ruled out.

""CRANK"" - K is less common.

""CRAMP"" - P is less common.

""CRANE"" - E is ruled out.

""CRANE"" is out.

""GRAPE"" - E is ruled out.

""GRAVY"" - V is less common.

""GRAFT"" - T is ruled out.

""GRAIN"" - I is ruled out.

""GRAND"" - D is common, N is common, A is in position 3 (allowed), R is in position 2 (allowed).

Wait, GRAND:
- G, R, A, N, D
- R is in position 2 (allowed, since previous R was not in position 2 and this is a new position).
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since previous A was not in position 3).
- Uses common letters G, N, D.

This seems like a solid next guess.

Let me verify:
- Does it use only allowed letters? G, R, A, N, D - none of O, S, E, T, I, L are present.
- R is in position 2 (new position).
- A is in position 3 (new position).

Yes, this should give us good information.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
- It contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
- All letters are distinct, maximizing information gain
- These letters appear in many English words, so we'll get good feedback regardless of the secret word
- It's a valid 5-letter word

This will give me a good starting point to narrow down possibilities based on which letters are present or absent.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(x) → O is not in the word
- S(x) → S is not in the word
- E(x) → E is not in the word

So the secret word:
- Contains A (but not at position 1)
- Contains R (but not at position 2)
- Does NOT contain O, S, or E

I want a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and R in different positions
2. Avoids O, S, E
3. Uses common remaining letters to maximize information

Good remaining common letters: T, N, L, I, C, U, D, M, P, etc.

A good candidate is ""TRAIL"":
- T, R, A, I, L
- R is now in position 2 (was position 2 in AROSE, so this tests R in a new position)
- A is now in position 3 (was position 1 in AROSE)
- Avoids O, S, E
- Uses common letters T and L

This should give us good new information.

Let's consolidate the information we have so far.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O, S, E are not in the word.

From Guess 2 (TRAIL):
- T, I, L are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (consistent with previous feedback).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (so A must be in positions 2, 4, or 5).

Therefore, the secret word:
- Contains A (positions 2, 4, or 5)
- Contains R (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5)
- Does NOT contain: O, S, E, T, I, L

Remaining common letters we haven't ruled out: N, U, D, C, M, P, G, H, Y, K, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and R in allowed positions.
2. Uses only allowed letters (no O, S, E, T, I, L).
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Possible candidate: ""NURAR"" - but this repeats R and is unlikely.
Better candidate: ""CRANK"" - but K is less common and we haven't tested it.
Another candidate: ""MURAN"" - but U is common and N is common, and positions are open.

Wait, let's think systematically:
- A must be in 2, 4, or 5.
- R must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- Other letters must be from the remaining pool.

A good word that fits is ""CRAZY"":
- C, R, A, Z, Y
- R is in position 2 (allowed, since previous R was not in position 2 and this is a new position).
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since previous A was not in position 3).
- Uses common letters C, Z, Y.

But Z is less common. Another good candidate is ""MURAL"":
- M, U, R, A, L - but L is ruled out.

""CRANE"" - but E is ruled out.

""GRAIN"" - I and N are possible, but I is ruled out.

""CARDS"" - S is ruled out.

""CRANK"" - K is less common.

""CRAMP"" - P is less common.

""CRANE"" - E is ruled out.

""CRANE"" is out.

""GRAPE"" - E is ruled out.

""GRAVY"" - V is less common.

""GRAFT"" - T is ruled out.

""GRAIN"" - I is ruled out.

""GRAND"" - D is common, N is common, A is in position 3 (allowed), R is in position 2 (allowed).

Wait, GRAND:
- G, R, A, N, D
- R is in position 2 (allowed, since previous R was not in position 2 and this is a new position).
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since previous A was not in position 3).
- Uses common letters G, N, D.

This seems like a solid next guess.

Let me verify:
- Does it use only allowed letters? G, R, A, N, D - none of O, S, E, T, I, L are present.
- R is in position 2 (new position).
- A is in position 3 (new position).

Yes, this should give us good information.

From Guess 3 (GRAND):
- G, N, D are NOT in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (consistent with earlier feedback).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (consistent with earlier feedback).

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: O, S, E, T, I, L, G, N, D
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, R
- Positions:
  - A cannot be in positions 1 or 3
  - R cannot be in positions 2
  - Remaining positions for A: 2, 4, 5
  - Remaining positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5

We still need three more letters from the remaining pool. The unused common letters include: C, F, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

2. Places A in position 2, 4, or 5
3. Places R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5

Let's look for words that fit these constraints. One promising candidate is ""CARUM"":
- C, A, R, U, M
- A is in position 2 (allowed)
- R is in position 3 (allowed)
- All letters are from the allowed set.

Another candidate is ""CURAR"" but that's not a valid English word. ""CRAVY"" isn't common. ""CARUM"" is a valid word (though rare, it's in the Scrabble dictionary).

""CARUM"" seems like the best next guess as it tests new letters (C, U, M) while respecting the positional constraints.

From Guess 5 (HARRY) we now have:

- A is in the word AND in position 2 (✓).
- R is in the word AND in positions 3 and 4 (both ✓).
- Y is in the word AND in position 5 (✓).
- H is NOT in the word.

So the secret word must be of the form: _ A R R Y

Letters we know are NOT in the word: O, S, E, T, I, L, G, N, D, C, U, M, H.

The only remaining letter for the first position from the allowed set is F, K, P, V, W, etc. The only valid 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ A R R Y is:

F A R R Y – but “FARRY” is not a valid English word.
K A R R Y – “KARRY” is not valid.
P A R R Y – “PARRY” is a valid English word.

Therefore, the only possible word left is “PARRY”.
