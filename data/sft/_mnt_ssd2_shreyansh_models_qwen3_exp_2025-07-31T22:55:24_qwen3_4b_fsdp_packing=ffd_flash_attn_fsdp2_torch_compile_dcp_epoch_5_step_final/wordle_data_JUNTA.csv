For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good spread of letters that are likely to appear in the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word (x)
- L is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- T is in the word and in position 4 (✓)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. T is fixed in position 4.
2. A exists somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 5.

A good next guess would use remaining common letters while satisfying these constraints. The word ""CRATE"" comes to mind:
- C, R, A, T, E → but E is excluded (from feedback).
- ""CRANT"" is invalid (not a word).
- ""PARTY"" → P, A, R, T, Y → T is in position 4, A is in position 2, and none of S, L, E are present. This seems valid.

Let's check:
- P: new letter
- A: known to be in word, now in position 2
- R: new letter
- T: confirmed in position 4

This tests new letters while respecting the constraints.

From the two rounds of feedback we now have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(x)
   – T is fixed in position 4.
   – A is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   – S, L, E are NOT in the word.

2. PARTY → P(x) A(-) R(x) T(✓) Y(x)
   – T is again confirmed in position 4.
   – A is in the word but NOT in position 2 (and we already knew it wasn’t in position 3 from SLATE).
   – P, R, Y are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- T is in position 4.
- A must be in position 1 or 5 (since it cannot be in 2, 3, or 4).
- Letters definitely absent: S, L, E, P, R, Y.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Has T in position 4.
- Has A in position 1 or 5.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (so no S, L, E, P, R, Y).

Good candidates:
- If A is in position 1: A _ _ T _
- If A is in position 5: _ _ _ T A

Let’s try A in position 1 first. A common consonant cluster is “BL”, but B and L are allowed (L was ruled out, so no). Next is “CK”: A C K T _ → “ACKT_” isn’t a word. “ACT” is 3 letters. “ACTON” is 6 letters. “ACTED” has E (ruled out). “ACTOR” has R (ruled out). “ACTIN” has I and N, both allowed, but N is last: ACTIN is 5 letters, ends in N. But we need A in position 1 and T in 4: ACTIN is A C T I N → T is in position 3, not 4. So that’s invalid.

Next, try A in position 5: _ _ _ T A. Possible words: “COTTA” (but has T twice, and we don’t know if T repeats). “BLOAT” has L (ruled out). “GLOAT” has L (ruled out). “FLOAT” has L (ruled out). “COBTA” isn’t a word. “MOTTA” is valid but has T twice. “MOTTA” is M O T T A → T is in position 3 and 4, which is possible, but we don’t know if T repeats. However, we can’t be sure.

Another approach: use common remaining letters. Remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, etc. Vowels left: A (known), I, O, U.

Try A in position 1: A _ _ T _
- A C K T _ → “ACKT_” not a word.
- A C H T _ → “ACHTE” is not a word.
- A C K T _ → same issue.
- A C H T _ → same.
- A C K T _ → same.

Try A in position 5: _ _ _ T A
- B O D T A → “BODTA” not a word.
- C O D T A → “CODTA” not a word.
- C O B T A → “COBTA” not a word.
- C O N T A → “CONTA” not a word.
- C O M T A → “COMTA” not a word.
- C O P T A → has P (ruled out).
- C O U T A → “COUTA” not a word.
- C O D T A → same.

Wait, let’s think of actual 5-letter words with T in position 4 and A in position 1 or 5.

A in position 1: A _ _ T _
- ACTON (but has O and N, T is 3rd, not 4th)
- ACTED (E ruled out)
- ACTOR (R ruled out)
- ACTIN (T is 3rd)
- ACTOR (R ruled out)
- ACTON (T is 3rd)
- ACTOR (R ruled out)

A in position 5: _ _ _ T A
- COTTA (T twice, but possible)
- GLOAT (L ruled out)
- FLOAT (L ruled out)
- BLOAT (L ruled out)
- MOTTA (possible)
- COTTA (possible)
- FOTTA (not a word)
- DITTA (not a word)

“MOTTA” is M O T T A → T is in positions 3 and 4. This would mean T is repeated, but we don’t have evidence against that. However, we want to test new letters.

Another candidate: “COBTA” isn’t a word. “CODTA” isn’t a word.

Let’s try A in position 1 with new letters: A C H T _ → “ACHTE” not a word. “ACHTE” is not valid.

Next, try A in position 5 with new letters: B O D T A → “BODTA” not a word. C O D T A → “CODTA” not a word.

“ACTON” is A C T O N → T is 3rd, not 4th.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good spread of letters that are likely to appear in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word (x)
- L is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- T is in the word and in position 4 (✓)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. T is fixed in position 4.
2. A exists somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 5.
3. S, L, E are not in the word at all.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Has T in the 4th position.
- Contains A in positions 1, 2, or 5.
- Does NOT contain S, L, or E.

A good next guess would use remaining common letters while satisfying these constraints. The word ""CRATE"" comes to mind:
- C, R, A, T, E → but E is excluded (from feedback).
- ""CRANT"" is invalid (not a word).
- ""PARTY"" → P, A, R, T, Y → T is in position 4, A is in position 2, and none of S, L, E are present. This seems valid.

Let's check:
- P: new letter
- A: known to be in word, now in position 2
- R: new letter
- T: confirmed in position 4
- Y: new letter

This tests new letters while respecting the constraints.

From the two previous guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(x)
   – T is locked in position 4.
   – A exists somewhere in the word but NOT in position 3.
   – S, L, E are NOT in the word.

2. PARTY → P(x) A(-) R(x) T(✓) Y(x)
   – T is still locked in position 4.
   – A exists somewhere in the word but NOT in position 2.
   – P, R, Y are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- T is in position 4.
- A must be in position 1 or 5 (since it cannot be in 2 or 3).
- Letters that are definitely out: S, L, E, P, R, Y.

We still need to test common consonants and vowels. Let’s look for a word that:
- Has T in position 4.
- Has A in position 1 or 5.
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

A good candidate is “BANAT” but that’s not a valid word.  
Next, “CANT” is 4 letters.  
Let’s try “BLOAT” but O is untested.  
A valid word that fits is “BLOAT”:
- B: new letter
- L: already ruled out (from SLATE feedback)
Oops, L is eliminated, so “BLOAT” is invalid.

Next candidate: “CATCH” – but C is fine, A in position 2 is invalid (from PARTY feedback).

Try “DRAFT”:
- D: new letter
- R: already ruled out (from PARTY feedback)
Invalid.

Try “GAULT”:
- G: new letter
- A: in position 2 – invalid (from PARTY feedback)

Try “VITAL”:
- V: new letter
- I: new vowel
- T: locked in position 4
- A: position 3 – invalid (from SLATE feedback)

Try “VITAL” – A in position 3 is invalid.

Try “FATAL”:
- F: new letter
- A: position 2 – invalid

Try “HATCH”:
- H: new letter
- A: position 2 – invalid

Try “MOUTH”:
- M: new letter
- O: new vowel
- U: new vowel
- T: position 4
- H: new letter

Check constraints:
- T in position 4 ✓
- A must be in word but not in positions 2 or 3 – but A is not in MOUTH.  
So MOUTH is invalid because A is missing.

We need a word that contains A in position 1 or 5 and T in position 4, using only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible words:
- “A” + _ + _ + T + _ → A _ _ T _
- _ _ _ T A

Letters still allowed: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (excluding S, L, E, P, R, Y).

A valid word fitting A _ _ T _ is “ADMIT”:
- A: position 1 ✓
- D: new letter
- M: new letter
- I: new vowel
- T: position 4 ✓

Check:
- Contains A (position 1) ✓
- Contains T (position 4) ✓
- No S, L, E, P, R, Y ✓

Another candidate is “ANGST” but S is eliminated.

“AMBIT”:
- A: position 1 ✓

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good spread of letters that are likely to appear in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word (x)
- L is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- T is in the word and in position 4 (✓)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. T is fixed in position 4.
2. A exists somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 5.
3. S, L, E are not in the word at all.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Has T in the 4th position.
- Contains A in positions 1, 2, or 5.
- Does NOT contain S, L, or E.

A good next guess would use remaining common letters while satisfying these constraints. The word ""CRATE"" comes to mind:
- C, R, A, T, E → but E is excluded (from feedback).
- ""CRANT"" is invalid (not a word).
- ""PARTY"" → P, A, R, T, Y → T is in position 4, A is in position 2, and none of S, L, E are present. This seems valid.

Let's check:
- P: new letter
- A: known to be in word, now in position 2
- R: new letter
- T: confirmed in position 4
- Y: new letter

This tests new letters while respecting the constraints.

   – A exists somewhere in the word but NOT in position 3.
   – S, L, E are NOT in the word.

   – T is still locked in position 4.
   – A exists somewhere in the word but NOT in position 2.
   – P, R, Y are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- T is in position 4.
- A must be in position 1 or 5 (since it cannot be in 2 or 3).
- Letters that are definitely out: S, L, E, P, R, Y.

We still need to test common consonants and vowels. Let’s look for a word that:
- Has T in position 4.
- Has A in position 1 or 5.
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

A good candidate is “BANAT” but that’s not a valid word.  
Next, “CANT” is 4 letters.  
Let’s try “BLOAT” but O is untested.  
A valid word that fits is “BLOAT”:
- B: new letter
- L: already ruled out (from SLATE feedback)
Oops, L is eliminated, so “BLOAT” is invalid.

Next candidate: “CATCH” – but C is fine, A in position 2 is invalid (from PARTY feedback).

Try “DRAFT”:
- D: new letter
- R: already ruled out (from PARTY feedback)
Invalid.

Try “GAULT”:
- G: new letter
- A: in position 2 – invalid (from PARTY feedback)

Try “VITAL”:

- T: locked in position 4
- A: position 3 – invalid (from SLATE feedback)

Try “VITAL” – A in position 3 is invalid.

Try “FATAL”:

- A: position 2 – invalid

Try “HATCH”:
- H: new letter
- A: position 2 – invalid

Try “MOUTH”:
- M: new letter
- O: new vowel
- U: new vowel
- T: position 4
- H: new letter

Check constraints:
- T in position 4 ✓
- A must be in word but not in positions 2 or 3 – but A is not in MOUTH.  
So MOUTH is invalid because A is missing.

We need a word that contains A in position 1 or 5 and T in position 4, using only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible words:
- “A” + _ + _ + T + _ → A _ _ T _
- _ _ _ T A

Letters still allowed: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (excluding S, L, E, P, R, Y).

A valid word fitting A _ _ T _ is “ADMIT”:
- A: position 1 ✓
- D: new letter
- M: new letter
- I: new vowel
- T: position 4 ✓

Check:
- Contains A (position 1) ✓
- Contains T (position 4) ✓
- No S, L, E, P, R, Y ✓

Another candidate is “ANGST” but S is eliminated.

“AMBIT”:
- A: position 1 ✓
- M: new letter
- B: new letter
- I: new vowel
- T: position 4 ✓

Both ADMIT and AMBIT are valid. Let’s choose ADMIT.

From all feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(x)

   – A exists but is NOT in position 3.
   – S, L, E are eliminated.

2. PARTY → P(x) A(-) R(x) T(✓) Y(x)
   – A exists but is NOT in position 2.
   – P, R, Y are eliminated.

3. ADMIT → A(-) D(x) M(x) I(x) T(-)
   – A is NOT in position 1.
   – T is NOT in position 5 (but we already know T is in position 4).
   – D, M, I are eliminated.

So far we know:
- T is in position 4.
- A must be in position 5 (since positions 1, 2, 3 are ruled out for A).
- Eliminated letters: S, L, E, P, R, Y, D, M, I.

Remaining letters: A (must be in position 5), T (position 4), and the rest can be from: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ _ _ T A.

Possible valid words:
- BLOAT – but L is eliminated.
- CATCH – C, A, T, C, H. A is in position 2 (invalid).
- FOUNT – O, U, N, T. F, O, U, N, T – but A is missing.
- GLOAT – L eliminated.
- HUMAT – not a word.
- KNOTA – not a word.
- NOVA T – not 5 letters.

Wait, we need a word that ends in TA and has T in position 4. The only common English word fitting _ _ _ T A is ""BLOAT"" but L is out, ""GLOAT"" but L is out, ""HUMAT"" is invalid, ""FOUNT"" is missing A. 

Looking again, ""BLOAT"" is invalid (L out), ""GLOAT"" invalid (L out). 

Wait, the pattern is _ _ _ T A, so the word must be something like ""FOUNT"" but that ends in T, not TA. 

Actually, we need _ _ _ T A, so the word must be ""FOUNT"" plus A, but that doesn't fit. 

Looking at remaining letters, the only possible valid word seems to be ""BLOAT"" but L is eliminated. 

Wait, let me check again. The pattern is _ _ _ T A, and the remaining letters are B, C, F, G, H, J, K, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Possible words:
- B, C, F, G, H, J, K, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z plus T in position 4 and A in position 5.

Looking at these, ""FOUNT"" is F, O, U, N, T – but that ends in T, not TA. 

""NOVA"" is 4 letters. 

""BOAST"" – but S is eliminated. 

""FOCAL"" – C is allowed, but A is in position 3 (invalid). 

""COBALT"" – too long. 

""FOCAL"" – A in position 3 invalid. 

""JOKER"" – R eliminated.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good spread of letters that are likely to appear in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word (x)
- L is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- T is in the word and in position 4 (✓)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. T is fixed in position 4.
2. A exists somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 5.
3. S, L, E are not in the word at all.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Has T in the 4th position.
- Contains A in positions 1, 2, or 5.
- Does NOT contain S, L, or E.

A good next guess would use remaining common letters while satisfying these constraints. The word ""CRATE"" comes to mind:
- C, R, A, T, E → but E is excluded (from feedback).
- ""CRANT"" is invalid (not a word).
- ""PARTY"" → P, A, R, T, Y → T is in position 4, A is in position 2, and none of S, L, E are present. This seems valid.

Let's check:
- P: new letter
- A: known to be in word, now in position 2
- R: new letter
- T: confirmed in position 4
- Y: new letter

This tests new letters while respecting the constraints.

From the two previous guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(x)
   – T is locked in position 4.
   – A exists somewhere in the word but NOT in position 3.
   – S, L, E are NOT in the word.

2. PARTY → P(x) A(-) R(x) T(✓) Y(x)
   – T is still locked in position 4.
   – A exists somewhere in the word but NOT in position 2.
   – P, R, Y are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- T is in position 4.
- A must be in position 1 or 5 (since it cannot be in 2 or 3).
- Letters that are definitely out: S, L, E, P, R, Y.

We still need to test common consonants and vowels. Let’s look for a word that:
- Has T in position 4.
- Has A in position 1 or 5.
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

A good candidate is “BANAT” but that’s not a valid word.  
Next, “CANT” is 4 letters.  
Let’s try “BLOAT” but O is untested.  
A valid word that fits is “BLOAT”:
- B: new letter
- L: already ruled out (from SLATE feedback)
Oops, L is eliminated, so “BLOAT” is invalid.

Next candidate: “CATCH” – but C is fine, A in position 2 is invalid (from PARTY feedback).

Try “DRAFT”:
- D: new letter
- R: already ruled out (from PARTY feedback)
Invalid.

Try “GAULT”:
- G: new letter
- A: in position 2 – invalid (from PARTY feedback)

Try “VITAL”:
- V: new letter
- I: new vowel
- T: locked in position 4
- A: position 3 – invalid (from SLATE feedback)

Try “VITAL” – A in position 3 is invalid.

Try “FATAL”:
- F: new letter
- A: position 2 – invalid

Try “HATCH”:
- H: new letter
- A: position 2 – invalid

Try “MOUTH”:
- M: new letter
- O: new vowel
- U: new vowel
- T: position 4
- H: new letter

Check constraints:
- T in position 4 ✓
- A must be in word but not in positions 2 or 3 – but A is not in MOUTH.  
So MOUTH is invalid because A is missing.

We need a word that contains A in position 1 or 5 and T in position 4, using only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible words:
- “A” + _ + _ + T + _ → A _ _ T _
- _ _ _ T A

Letters still allowed: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (excluding S, L, E, P, R, Y).

A valid word fitting A _ _ T _ is “ADMIT”:
- A: position 1 ✓
- D: new letter
- M: new letter
- I: new vowel
- T: position 4 ✓

Check:
- Contains A (position 1) ✓
- Contains T (position 4) ✓
- No S, L, E, P, R, Y ✓

Another candidate is “ANGST” but S is eliminated.

“AMBIT”:
- A: position 1 ✓
- M: new letter
- B: new letter
- I: new vowel
- T: position 4 ✓

Both ADMIT and AMBIT are valid. Let’s choose ADMIT.
