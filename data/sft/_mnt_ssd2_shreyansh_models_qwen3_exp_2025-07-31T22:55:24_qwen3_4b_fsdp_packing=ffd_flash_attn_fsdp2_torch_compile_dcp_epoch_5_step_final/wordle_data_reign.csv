### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"" are popular starting choices because they include frequently used letters.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give good coverage to narrow down the secret word quickly.

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)

Interpretation of feedback so far:

1. Letters known NOT in the word: A, O, S, B, Y  
2. Letters known TO be in the word: E (and it’s in position 2)  
3. Letter R is in the word but is NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (because in both guesses it got “-” in those spots).  
   Therefore R must be in position 1 or 5.

4. The word has the pattern:  
   _ E _ _ _  (E is locked in position 2)  
   and R must appear once more, in position 1 or 5.

So the word must be either:  
R E _ _ _  or  _ E _ _ R

We need to pick a word that fits one of these patterns, uses only letters not yet eliminated, and introduces new common letters to test.

Candidate words:

- R E _ _ _ : “REIGN”, “RELIC”, “REBEL”, “REGAL” – but these use eliminated letters (G, L, I, C, etc.) or have duplicates.  
- _ E _ _ R : “LEPER”, “HEPER” (invalid), “PEPER” (invalid), “FEVER” (F, V not eliminated), “KEPER” (invalid), “MEPER” (invalid), “NEPER” (invalid), “WEPER” (invalid), “PEPER” (invalid).  

“FEVER” is valid: F, E, V, E, R.  
Check constraints:  
- Letters: F, E, V, E, R – none are in the eliminated set {A, O, S, B, Y}.  
- R is in position 5 (allowed).  
- E is in position 2 (matches the feedback).  
- Introduces F and V, which are new letters.

From all feedback so far:

1. Eliminated letters: A, O, S, B, Y, F, V  
2. Confirmed letters: E (fixed in position 2)  
3. R is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (because it got “-” in each of those spots in guesses 1, 2, 3).  
   Therefore R must be in position 1.

So the word has the pattern:  
R E _ _ _

We need a 5-letter word starting with RE, using only letters not yet eliminated, and introducing new letters to test.

Available letters (not yet used and not eliminated): C, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, W, X, Z

Candidate words:
- RELIC – uses L, I, C (all allowed)  
- RELAX – uses A (eliminated) – invalid  
- RELAY – uses A, Y (both eliminated) – invalid  
- REGAL – uses G, A, L (A eliminated) – invalid  
- REBEL – uses B (eliminated) – invalid  
- REMIX – uses M, I, X – valid  
- REPAY – uses P, A, Y (A, Y eliminated) – invalid  
- REACH – uses C, H – valid  
- RECKON – too long  
- RECKS – too short  
- REEK – too short  
- REIGN – uses G, I, N – valid  
- RELIC, REIGN, REMIX, REACH, RECKS, REIGN, etc.

Pick one that introduces new common letters. Let’s try “REIGN” (R E I G N).  
- R is in position 1 (allowed).  
- E is in position 2 (fixed).  
- I, G, N are new letters.  
- None of these letters are in the eliminated set.

This should help narrow down the remaining positions.
