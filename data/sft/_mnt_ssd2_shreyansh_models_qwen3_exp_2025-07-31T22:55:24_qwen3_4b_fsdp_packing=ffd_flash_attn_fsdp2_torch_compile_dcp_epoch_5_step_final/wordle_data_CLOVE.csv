### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E - very common letters)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E - good vowel coverage)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U - good vowel coverage)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers very common letters and gives good vowel coverage (A, E) plus S, L, T.

From the feedback so far:

- Pattern: C L O _ E
- Letters confirmed: C, L, O, E (all in their correct positions)
- Letter eliminated: N (not in the word at all)

We need a 5-letter word that starts with ""CLO"" and ends with ""E"", with the fourth letter being any letter that hasn’t been tried yet and isn’t N.

Possible letters for position 4 (not used yet): B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common English words:
- CLOKE – not a valid English word.
- CLOVE – valid word meaning a small fruit or the scent of cloves.
- CLOPE – not standard.
- CLOPE – not standard.
- CLOPE – not standard.

The only common valid word is ""CLOVE"". Let’s check:
- C(✓) L(✓) O(✓) V(?) E(✓)
- V hasn’t been tried yet, and it fits the pattern.

Therefore, the next logical guess is CLOVE.
