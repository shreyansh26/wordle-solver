1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these to quickly identify which letters are present or absent.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good spread of frequently used letters to help narrow down possibilities efficiently.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- L, A, T are not in the word at all (x)

1. The word starts with S.
2. The word contains an E somewhere other than the last letter.
3. The letters L, A, T are excluded.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S

- Does not contain L, A, or T

Common consonants left to try: R, N, C, H, D, G, B, M, P, etc.
Common vowels left to try: I, O, U (since A is out, and E is already known to be in the word).

Let's think of words that fit:
- S _ _ E _ or S _ E _ _
- Avoid L, A, T

Examples:
- SIREN (but has R and N, and E in position 4)
- SHIRE (but has H and I, E in position 4)
- SNORE (N, O, E in position 4)
- SKEIN (but has K, I, N, E in position 4)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these to quickly identify which letters are present or absent.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good spread of frequently used letters to help narrow down possibilities efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in the first position (✓)
- L, A, T are not in the word at all (x)
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position (-)

So we know:
1. The word starts with S.
2. The word contains an E somewhere other than the last letter.
3. The letters L, A, T are excluded.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S
- Has an E somewhere except position 5
- Does not contain L, A, or T

Common consonants left to try: R, N, C, H, D, G, B, M, P, etc.
Common vowels left to try: I, O, U (since A is out, and E is already known to be in the word).

Let's think of words that fit:
- S _ _ E _ or S _ E _ _
- Avoid L, A, T

Examples:
- SIREN (but has R and N, and E in position 4)
- SHIRE (but has H and I, E in position 4)
- SNORE (N, O, E in position 4)
- SKEIN (but has K, I, N, E in position 4)
- SPOKE (P, O, K, E in position 4)

""SHIRE"" seems good because it uses S, H, I, R, E and fits all constraints:
- Starts with S
- E is in position 4 (not last)
- No L, A, T

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

1. Fixed letters so far:
   - Position 1: S (✓)
   - Position 2: E (✓)

2. Letters that must appear somewhere in the word (but not yet placed):
   - R (from SEROW feedback: R is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4)

3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
   - L, A, T, H, I, U, M, O

4. Still-allowed letters (consonants and vowels):
   - Vowels left: none (E is fixed; A, I, O, U are out)
   - Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, K, N, P, V, W, Y

5. R must therefore appear in position 5 (since it cannot appear in positions 3 or 4).

6. So the word pattern is now:
   S E _ _ R

7. We need to fill positions 3 and 4 with letters from the allowed set (B, C, D, F, G, K, N, P, V, W, Y).

8. Common 5-letter words that fit S E _ _ R:
   - SEWER (but W is allowed and E is already in position 2)
   - SEPER (not a valid word)
   - SECRU (invalid)
   - SEKUR (invalid)
   - SEDAR (invalid)
   - SEGER (invalid)
   - SEDER (invalid)
   - SEVER (valid word, uses V and E; but E is already in position 2)
   - SEWER (valid word, uses W and E; E is already in position 2)

   The only valid common word left is SEWER.

Check against constraints:
- S(✓) E(✓) W(?) E(?) R(✓)
   - W is allowed (not yet excluded)
   - E is already in position 2; the second E is not a problem because letters can repeat unless the feedback says otherwise. However, in Wordle, the feedback only tells you about the presence/absence of each letter in the word, not about duplicates. So SEWER is acceptable.

Thus, the next guess is SEWER.

<guess>SEWER</guess>",SEWER,"Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

1. Fixed letters so far:
   - Position 1: S (✓)
   - Position 2: E (✓)

2. Letters that must appear somewhere in the word (but not yet placed):
   - R (from SEROW feedback: R is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4)

3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
   - L, A, T, H, I, U, M, O

4. Still-allowed letters (consonants and vowels):
   - Vowels left: none (E is fixed; A, I, O, U are out)
   - Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, K, N, P, V, W, Y

5. R must therefore appear in position 5 (since it cannot appear in positions 3 or 4).

6. So the word pattern is now:
   S E _ _ R

7. We need to fill positions 3 and 4 with letters from the allowed set (B, C, D, F, G, K, N, P, V, W, Y).

8. Common 5-letter words that fit S E _ _ R:
   - SEWER (but W is allowed and E is already in position 2)
   - SEPER (not a valid word)
   - SECRU (invalid)
   - SEKUR (invalid)
   - SEDAR (invalid)
   - SEGER (invalid)
   - SEDER (invalid)
   - SEVER (valid word, uses V and E; but E is already in position 2)
   - SEWER (valid word, uses W and E; E is already in position 2)

   The only valid common word left is SEWER.

Check against constraints:
- S(✓) E(✓) W(?) E(?) R(✓)
   - W is allowed (not yet excluded)
   - E is already in position 2; the second E is not a problem because letters can repeat unless the feedback says otherwise. However, in Wordle, the feedback only tells you about the presence/absence of each letter in the word, not about duplicates. So SEWER is acceptable.

Thus, the next guess is SEWER.",Guess 5: SEWER -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) E(✓) W(✓) E(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
