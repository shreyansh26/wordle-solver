For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. Some good starting words include ""AROSE,"" ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""ADIEU."" Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly effective because it includes common vowels (A, O, E) and consonants (R, S) that appear frequently in English words. This gives us a broad initial sample to work with.

Let's go with ""AROSE"" as our first guess.

- A: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- O: in the word but wrong position (-)
- S: in the word but wrong position (-)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:

- The word does NOT contain A, R, or E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O and S somewhere other than 3rd and 4th positions.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and E are out, O is in but already used).

A good next guess is “POINT”:
- Uses P, O, I, N, T – none of A, R, E.
- O is in position 2 (not 3, so satisfies feedback).
- S is not used, so we can test new letters while keeping O and S in mind for later placement.

This should give us new information about P, I, N, T while respecting the constraints.

This gives us a broad initial sample to work with.\n\nLet\'s go with ""AROSE"" as our first guess.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A: not in the word (x)\n- R: not in the word (x)\n- O: in the word but wrong position (-)\n- S: in the word but wrong position (-)\n- E: not in the word (x)\n\nSo we know:\n- The word contains O and S, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.\n- The word does NOT contain A, R, or E.\n\nWe need a 5-letter word that:\n1.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

1. Pattern so far: _ O _ _ _ (O is locked in position 2).
2. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, E, P, I, N, T, L, K, Y.
3. Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions:
   - S: not in positions 1 or 4 (from AROSE and SULKY feedback)
   - U: not in position 2 (already known), but it is in the word (from SULKY feedback)
4. Therefore, S must be in position 3 or 5.
5. U must be in position 1, 3, or 5 (since 2 is O and 2 is already ruled out for U).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has the pattern: _ O _ _ _
- Contains both S and U (but not in their previously excluded positions)
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible positions:
- S can be in 3 or 5
- U can be in 1, 3, or 5 (but not the same spot as S)

Let’s try:
- If S is in 3: then U must be in 1 or 5
  - U O S _ _  (but S is already in 3, so U would be in 1 or 5)
  - _ O S _ _  (but U must be in 1 or 5)
  - _ O S _ U
- If S is in 5: then U must be in 1 or 3
  - U O _ _ S
  - _ O U _ S

We also need to test new consonants for the remaining spots. Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, M, V, W, etc.

Let’s try the pattern _ O S _ U (S in 3, U in 5):
- Need a letter for position 4. Remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, M, V, W
- Try “BOSUM” – but M is allowed, U is allowed, but we have to check if all letters are unused.
  - B: not yet excluded
  - O: confirmed
  - S: confirmed
  - U: confirmed
  - M: not yet excluded
  - But “BOSUM” is not a valid English word.

Next try “COULD” – but L is excluded.

Next try “FOCUS” – but C is allowed, but U is in 4 (allowed), but we need to check:
  - F: allowed
  - O: allowed
  - U: allowed
  - C: allowed
  - S: allowed
  - Pattern: _ O _ _ _ with U in 4, S in 5:
    - F O U C S – but C is allowed, S is allowed, but we need to check if this fits the pattern.
    - But this would be F O U C S, which is 5 letters, but S is in 5 (allowed), U is in 3 (allowed).
    - However, this uses C in 4, which is allowed.

But we need to check if this fits the constraints:
- Pattern: _ O _ _ _ (O in 2)
- Letters: F, O, U, C, S
- All letters are allowed (not in the excluded list)
- S is in 5 (allowed)
- U is in 3 (allowed)
- This seems valid.

However, “FOCUS” is a valid word. Let’s use it.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. Some good starting words include ""AROSE,"" ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""ADIEU."" Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly effective because it includes common vowels (A, O, E) and consonants (R, S) that appear frequently in English words. This gives us a broad initial sample to work with.

Let's go with ""AROSE"" as our first guess.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- O: in the word but wrong position (-)
- S: in the word but wrong position (-)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word contains O and S, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, or E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O and S somewhere other than 3rd and 4th positions.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and E are out, O is in but already used).

A good next guess is “POINT”:
- Uses P, O, I, N, T – none of A, R, E.
- O is in position 2 (not 3, so satisfies feedback).
- S is not used, so we can test new letters while keeping O and S in mind for later placement.

This should give us new information about P, I, N, T while respecting the constraints.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on POINT:
- P: not in the word (x)
- O: in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so O is 2nd letter.
- I: not in the word (x)
- N: not in the word (x)
- T: not in the word (x)

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ O _ _ _
- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, E, P, I, N, T
- Letters that ARE in the word: O (position 2), and from AROSE we also know S is in the word but not in position 4.

We still need to test other common letters for positions 1, 3, 4, 5. Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, V, W, Y, etc. Good remaining vowels: U (since A, E, I are out).

We must place S somewhere other than position 4, so possible positions for S: 1, 3, or 5.

Let’s try a word that places S in position 1 and tests common letters for positions 3, 4, 5. A good candidate is “SOUND”:
- S is in position 1 (not 4, so acceptable)
- O is already confirmed in position 2
- U, N, D are new letters to test
- N is already excluded, so this won’t work.

Next try “SULKY”:
- S in 1, O in 2, U, L, K are new letters
- No excluded letters used
- S is in a new position (1)

This seems valid.

Let’s go with “SULKY”.
