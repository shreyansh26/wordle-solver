For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, T, N, S, L, etc.)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information gained

Some of the best starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- ROAST (contains R, O, A, S, T)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 very common consonants (S, T, L), giving us good coverage of the alphabet.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word (x)
- L is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) at position 3
- T is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So we know:
- The word has the pattern _ _ A _ _
- It contains E somewhere (but not at position 5)
- It does NOT contain S, L, or T

Good letters to try next: A (already placed), E, R, N, I, O, C, D, etc.

A strong second guess should:
1. Keep A in position 3
2. Place E in a new position (positions 1, 2, or 4)
3. Introduce new common consonants

Candidate words:
- CRAPE (C, R, P, E, A) – but P might be less common
- DRAIN (D, R, I, N, A) – but A is in position 3, so this doesn’t fit
- CRANE – fits pattern _ _ A _ _ (C R A N E), but E is in position 5 which we know is wrong
- GRATE – G R A T E – T is already ruled out
- CRAVE – C R A V E – V is less common
- BRAVE – B R A V E – V is less common

Actually, we need to place E in positions 1, 2, or 4. Let’s try:
- CRAVE – C R A V E – but E is in position 5 (invalid)
- GRAPE – G R A P E – same issue
- CRAPE – C R A P E – same issue

Wait, let’s try:

Hmm, let’s try:
- CRAVE – E in position 5 (invalid)
- CRAPE – E in position 5 (invalid)
- CRAVE – same

Let me think differently: A is in position 3, E must be in positions 1, 2, or 4.

Possible patterns:
- E _ A _ _
- _ E A _ _
- _ _ A E _

Let’s pick a word that fits one of these and introduces new common letters.

Option 1: E _ A _ _
- EARLY – but L is ruled out
- EAGER – G, R, E in positions 2 and 5
- EARTH – T is ruled out
- EAGER – fits E A G E R – but G and R are good
- EAGER – positions: E(1) A(3) G(4) E(5) R(5) – but E(5) is invalid

Option 2: _ E A _ _

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, T, N, S, L, etc.)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information gained

Some of the best starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- ROAST (contains R, O, A, S, T)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 very common consonants (S, T, L), giving us good coverage of the alphabet.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word (x)
- L is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) at position 3
- T is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So we know:
- The word has the pattern _ _ A _ _
- It contains E somewhere (but not at position 5)
- It does NOT contain S, L, or T

Good letters to try next: A (already placed), E, R, N, I, O, C, D, etc.

A strong second guess should:
1. Keep A in position 3
2. Place E in a new position (positions 1, 2, or 4)
3. Introduce new common consonants

Candidate words:
- CRAPE (C, R, P, E, A) – but P might be less common
- DRAIN (D, R, I, N, A) – but A is in position 3, so this doesn’t fit
- CRANE – fits pattern _ _ A _ _ (C R A N E), but E is in position 5 which we know is wrong
- GRATE – G R A T E – T is already ruled out
- CRAVE – C R A V E – V is less common
- BRAVE – B R A V E – V is less common

Actually, we need to place E in positions 1, 2, or 4. Let’s try:
- CRAVE – C R A V E – but E is in position 5 (invalid)
- GRAPE – G R A P E – same issue
- CRAPE – C R A P E – same issue

Wait, let’s try:
- CRANE – but E is in position 5 (invalid)
- CRANE – no, E is in position 5 (invalid)
- CRAVE – E is in position 5 (invalid)

Hmm, let’s try:
- CRAVE – E in position 5 (invalid)
- CRAPE – E in position 5 (invalid)
- CRAVE – same

Let me think differently: A is in position 3, E must be in positions 1, 2, or 4.

Possible patterns:
- E _ A _ _
- _ E A _ _
- _ _ A E _

Let’s pick a word that fits one of these and introduces new common letters.

Option 1: E _ A _ _
- EARLY – but L is ruled out
- EAGER – G, R, E in positions 2 and 5
- EARTH – T is ruled out
- EAGER – fits E A G E R – but G and R are good
- EAGER – positions: E(1) A(3) G(4) E(5) R(5) – but E(5) is invalid

Option 2: _ E A _ _
- BREAD – B R E A D – A is in position 4 (invalid)
- GREEN – G R E E N – A is missing
- TREND – T ruled out
- TREND – invalid

Option 3: _ _ A E _
- CRAVE – E is in position 5 (invalid)
- CRAPE – same
- CRAVE – same

Let’s try:
- GRAPE – G R A P E – E is in position 5 (invalid)
- GRAPE – invalid

Wait, let’s try:
- CRANE – E is in position 5 (invalid)
- CRANE – invalid

Let’s try:
- CRAVE – E is in position 5 (invalid)
- CRAVE – invalid

Let me think of a word with A in position 3, E in position 1 or 2, and new letters.

Option: E A R L Y – but L ruled out
Option: E A R G Y – but G and Y might be less common
Option: E A R D Y – same
Option: E A R N Y – same

Option: R E A D Y – A is in position 3, E in position 2
- READY – R E A D Y – A is in position 3, E in position 2, new letters D and Y
- Letters used: R, E, A, D, Y
- No S, L, T
- E is in position 2 (valid)
- A is in position 3 (valid)

This seems good.

Another option: R E A D Y – same as above

Let’s go with READY.
