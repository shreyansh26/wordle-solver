### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives me a good spread of letters to test against the secret word. I'll use ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

This uses A, R, E in new positions and avoids O and S.

   - C and T are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- The word contains A, R, E
- The word does NOT contain O, S, C, T
- Positions ruled out so far:
  - R cannot be in position 1 or 2
  - E cannot be in position 2 or 5
  - A cannot be in position 1 or 3

We still need to place A, R, E and introduce new letters that are not yet ruled out. The remaining common letters are B, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s look for a word that:
- Uses A, R, E in new positions
- Introduces two new letters from the allowed set
- Has no O, S, C, T

One candidate is “GRAPE”:
- G (new)
- R in position 2 (was ruled out for position 1, but position 2 is still allowed)
- A in position 3 (was ruled out for position 3 → so this is invalid)

Another candidate is “RAISE”:
- R in position 1 (ruled out) → invalid

Next candidate: “EARLY”
- E in position 1 (new)
- A in position 2 (new)
- R in position 3 (new)
- L (new)
- Y (new)
This avoids all ruled-out letters and places A, R, E in new positions.

Let me verify:
- E: not in 2 or 5 → 1 is allowed
- A: not in 1 or 3 → 2 is allowed
- R: not in 1 or 2 → 3 is allowed
- No O, S, C, T → good

I’ll go with EARLY.

From the three rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - Letters known to be in the word: A, R, E
   - Letters known NOT to be in the word: O, S

2. REACT → R(-) E(-) A(-) C(x) T(x)
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 1
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 2
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 3
   - C and T are NOT in the word

3. EARLY → E(-) A(✓) R(-) L(x) Y(x)
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 1
   - A is in the word AND in position 2 (✓)
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 3
   - L and Y are NOT in the word

Summary of what we know:
- The word contains A, R, E
- The word does NOT contain O, S, C, T, L, Y
- Position constraints:
  - A is fixed in position 2
  - E is NOT in positions 1, 2, 5
  - R is NOT in positions 1, 2, 3
  - Remaining letters must come from the allowed set: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, N, P, U, V, W, etc.

So far:
Position 1: ?
Position 2: A
Position 3: ?
Position 4: ?
Position 5: ?

We need to place E and R in the remaining positions while respecting their constraints.

- E cannot be in 1, 2, 5 → must be in position 3 or 4
- R cannot be in 1, 2, 3 → must be in position 4 or 5

Let’s consider possible placements:

Case 1:
E in position 3
R must be in position 4 or 5
- If R in 4: word is _ A E R _
- If R in 5: word is _ A E _ R

Case 2:
E in position 4
R must be in position 5
- word is _ A _ E R

We need to fill the remaining positions (1 and 3/4/5) with letters from the allowed set and ensure no duplicates.

Let’s try Case 1a: _ A E R _
Possible letters for positions 1 and 5 from allowed set (B, D, F, G, H, I, M, N, P, U, V, W, etc.)
We need a valid 5-letter word.

Possible candidates:
- B A E R ? → B A E R D (BAERD – not a word)
- D A E R ? → D A E R ? – not a word
- F A E R ? → not a word
- G A E R ? → not a word
- H A E R ? → not a word
- M A E R ? → not a word
- N A E R ? → not a word
- P A E R ? → not a word
- U A E R ? → not a word
- V A E R ? → not a word
- W A E R ? → not a word

Case 1b: _ A E _ R
Possible letters for positions 1 and 4 from allowed set.
Example:
- B A E D R → B A E D R (not a word)
- D A E M R → not a word
- F A E N R → not a word
- G A E N R → not a word
- H A E N R → not a word
- M A E N R → not a word
- N A E D R → not a word
- P A E D R → not a word
- U A E D R → not a word
- V A E D R → not a word
- W A E D R → not a word

Case 2: _ A _ E R
Possible letters for positions 1 and 3.
Example:
- B A D E R → B A D E R (valid word)
- D A M E R → not a word
- F A M E R → not a word
- G A M E R → not a word
- H A M E R → not a word
- M A D E R → not a word
- N A M E R → not a word
- P A M E R → not a word
- U A M E R → not a word
- V A M E R → not a word
- W A M E R → not a word

The only valid word I can find that fits all constraints is B A D E R.

Let’s verify:
- Letters: B, A, D, E, R
- Contains A, R, E (✓)
- Does NOT contain O, S, C, T, L, Y (✓)
- Position 2 is A (✓)
- E is in position 4 (allowed, not in 1,2,5)
- R is in position 5 (allowed, not in 1,2,3)
- No duplicates, all letters are allowed.

Therefore, B A D E R is a valid next guess.
