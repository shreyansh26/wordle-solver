### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll pick a word that uses several of these high-frequency letters to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

A good first guess should:
1. Use common letters
2. Avoid repeating letters
3. Be a valid 5-letter word

Looking at these criteria, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice:
- Uses 5 distinct common letters
- Contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 consonants (R, S)
- Is a valid English word

This will help me quickly determine which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and R.
2. Does not contain O, S, or E.
3. Places A somewhere other than position 1.
4. Places R somewhere other than position 2.

Good candidate letters (excluding O, S, E): A, R, plus common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

Let me try ""TRAIL"":
- T, R, A, I, L
- Contains both A and R.
- Does not contain O, S, or E.
- A is in position 3 (allowed).
- R is in position 2 (but the feedback said R is not in position 2). So RAIL is invalid because R would be in position 2.

Next try ""TRAIN"":

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll pick a word that uses several of these high-frequency letters to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

A good first guess should:
1. Use common letters
2. Avoid repeating letters
3. Be a valid 5-letter word

Looking at these criteria, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice:
- Uses 5 distinct common letters
- Contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 consonants (R, S)
- Is a valid English word

This will help me quickly determine which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains A and R, but not O, S, or E.
- A cannot be in position 1, and R cannot be in position 2.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and R.
2. Does not contain O, S, or E.
3. Places A somewhere other than position 1.
4. Places R somewhere other than position 2.

Good candidate letters (excluding O, S, E): A, R, plus common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

Let me try ""TRAIL"":
- T, R, A, I, L
- Contains both A and R.
- Does not contain O, S, or E.
- A is in position 3 (allowed).
- R is in position 2 (but the feedback said R is not in position 2). So RAIL is invalid because R would be in position 2.

Next try ""TRAIN"":
- T, R, A, I, N
- R is in position 2 (again invalid).

Next try ""RATIO"":
- R, A, T, I, O → contains O (invalid).

Next try ""FRANK"":
- F, R, A, N, K
- A is in position 3 (allowed).
- R is in position 2 (invalid).

Next try ""CRANK"":
- C, R, A, N, K
- R is in position 2 (invalid).

Next try ""BRAND"":
- B, R, A, N, D
- R is in position 2 (invalid).

Next try ""DRANK"":
- D, R, A, N, K
- R is in position 2 (invalid).

Next try ""GRAIN"":
- G, R, A, I, N
- R is in position 2 (invalid).

Next try ""RADIO"":
- R, A, D, I, O → contains O (invalid).

Next try ""TARAN"":
- T, A, R, A, N → contains A twice (but we don't know if duplicates are possible; this might not be ideal).

Next try ""PRANK"":
- P, R, A, N, K
- R is in position 2 (invalid).

Next try ""GRASP"":
- Contains S (invalid).

Next try ""CRATE"":
- Contains E (invalid).

Next try ""RATCH"":
- Contains T, C, H (but R is in position 1, A in 2, T in 3, C in 4, H in 5).
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- R is in position 1 (allowed, since feedback only said R is not in position 2).
- Does not contain O, S, E.
- Valid word.

So ""RATCH"" seems like a good next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RATCH -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) T(x) C(x) H(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on RATCH:
- R(✓) – R is in the word and in the correct first position.
- A(✓) – A is in the word and in the correct second position.
- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- C(x) – C is not in the word.
- H(x) – H is not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word starts with RA.
- It does NOT contain T, C, or H.
- It does NOT contain O, S, E (from Guess 1).
- It does NOT contain the letters O, S, E, T, C, H.

Remaining common letters we can still use: A, R, plus common consonants like N, L, D, M, P, B, F, G, K, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with RA and uses none of the eliminated letters (O, S, E, T, C, H).

Possible letters for positions 3, 4, 5: A, R, N, L, D, M, P, B, F, G, K, I, U, Y, etc.

Let’s list some valid words starting with RA:
- RAGAN (but G and N are allowed, but A repeats – not ideal)
- RABID (contains B, I, D – none eliminated)
- RAPID (contains P, I, D – none eliminated)
- RAVEN (contains V, E – E eliminated)
- RALLY (contains L, L – but L is allowed)
- RANCH (contains N, C – C eliminated)
- RAPID seems good: R A P I D
- RABID: R A B I D

Both RAPID and RABID fit the constraints. Let’s choose RAPID as it uses P and D which are common.

Check letters: R, A, P, I, D – none are in the eliminated list (O, S, E, T, C, H). Starts with RA. All correct.
