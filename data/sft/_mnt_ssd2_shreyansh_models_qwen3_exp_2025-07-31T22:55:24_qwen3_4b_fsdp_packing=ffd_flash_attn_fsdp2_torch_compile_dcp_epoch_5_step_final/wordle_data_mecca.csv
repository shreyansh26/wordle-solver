### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is a strong candidate because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (very common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to test their presence in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- R is not in the word at all
- O is not in the word at all
- S is not in the word at all

From the two rounds of feedback:

   - E is not in position 5.

2. tenet → T(x) E(✓) N(x) E(-) T(x)

   - E is still not in position 5 (so it must be in position 2, 3, or 4).
   - T is not in the word at all.
   - N is not in the word at all.

Current constraints:
- Letters known to be in the word: A, E
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, O, S, T, N
- E must be in position 2 (from the second guess).
- A must be in position 3, 4, or 5 (cannot be position 1, and position 5 is still possible for A).
- Need to introduce new common letters that haven’t been tested yet: common consonants left include L, C, D, G, H, M, P, etc.

A good next guess would:
- Fix E in position 2.
- Place A in a new position (3, 4, or 5).
- Use new common consonants for the remaining positions.

Candidate words:
- “A” in position 3: e.g., “LEACA” – but “LEACA” isn’t a valid word.
- “A” in position 4: e.g., “MEACH” – “MEACH” is a valid word (Scottish surname).

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters. \n\nLooking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is a strong candidate because it contains:\n- A (very common vowel)\n- R (very common consonant)\n- O (common vowel)\n- S (very common consonant)\n- E (most common letter in English)\n\nThis gives us a good spread of common letters to test their presence in the secret word.\n\n<guess>arose</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first)\n- R is not in the word at all\n- O is not in the word at all\n- S is not in the word at all\n- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not last)\n\nSo the secret word:\n- Contains A and E, but not R, O, S\n- A is not in position 1, and E is not in position 5\n\nNext guess should:\n1.

From all feedback so far:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - Contains A and E; A not in position 1, E not in position 5.

2. tenet → T(x) E(✓) N(x) E(-) T(x)
   - Confirms E is in position 2.
   - E is still not in position 5 (so it must be in position 2, 3, or 4).

3. leach → L(x) E(✓) A(-) C(✓) H(x)
   - Confirms E is in position 2.
   - Confirms C is in position 4.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (and not in position 1 from before, so A must be in position 4 or 5).
   - L and H are not in the word.

Current constraints:
- Word structure: _ E _ C _ (positions 2 and 4 fixed).
- A must be in position 4 or 5. But position 4 is already C, so A must be in position 5.
- Letters still unused and common: D, G, M, P, etc.
- Letters known absent: R, O, S, T, N, L, H.

So the word looks like: _ E _ C A.

Possible first letters: D, G, M, P, etc.
Possible third letters: D, G, M, P, etc.

Candidate words:
- DECCA – but D and E are both allowed, and C is already in position 4, so DECCA is invalid (double C).
- GEMCA – not a valid word.
- MELCA – not a valid word.
- PECMA – not a valid word.

Looking for valid 5-letter words matching _ E _ C A:
- M E C A – but that’s 4 letters.
- P E C A – but that’s 4 letters.
- D E C A – but that’s 4 letters.
- G E C A – but that’s 4 letters.

Wait, let me think differently: the word must be _ E _ C A. Valid words:
- ""GEMCA"" – invalid.
- ""PECCA"" – invalid.
- ""MECCA"" – valid word (Mecca, the city).

MECCA fits:
- M (not ruled out).
- E in position 2 (confirmed).
- C in position 4 (confirmed).
- C in position 5? No, position 4 is C and position 5 is A. MECCA is M E C C A, which would have C in position 4 and 5, but our feedback shows C is in position 4 and not in position 5. So MECCA is invalid because C would appear twice, and we have no info about second C.

Next candidate: ""PECCA"" – same issue.

Another candidate: ""GECCA"" – same issue.

Wait, let me list valid 5-letter words ending in ""E C A"":
- ""BECAN"" – but N is ruled out.
- ""DECAY"" – Y is allowed, but position 4 must be C.
- ""FECAL"" – L is ruled out.
- ""MECCA"" – already discussed.
- ""PECCA"" – same.
- ""WECMA"" – not a word.

Actually, the correct pattern is _ E _ C A, so the word must be:
- First letter: any unused common letter (D, G, M, P, etc.)
- Second letter: E (fixed)
- Third letter: any unused common letter (D, G, M, P, etc.)
- Fourth letter: C (fixed)
- Fifth letter: A (fixed)

Valid words:
- ""MECCA"" – invalid (double C).
- ""PECCA"" – invalid.
- ""GECCA"" – invalid.
- ""DECCA"" – invalid (double C).

Wait, let me think of valid words with pattern _ E _ C A:
- ""BECAN"" – N ruled out.
- ""DECAY"" – Y is allowed, but position 4 must be C.
- ""FECAL"" – L ruled out.
- ""GEMCA"" – invalid.
- ""PECCA"" – invalid.
- ""WECMA"" – invalid.

Hmm, seems like the only valid word fitting _ E _ C A is ""MECCA"", but it has a second C which we haven't confirmed. However, ""MECCA"" is a valid word and the only candidate that fits the pattern, so I'll go with that.

But wait, ""MECCA"" has C in position 4 and 5, but we have no info about the second C. However, the feedback for leach shows C in position 4 and not in position 5 (H(x) at position 5). So MECCA is invalid.

I must have missed a word. Let me check again:
- ""GEMCA"" – invalid.
- ""PECCA"" – invalid.
- ""MECCA"" – invalid.
- ""DECCA"" – invalid.

Another candidate: ""BECAN"" – N ruled out.
""DECAY"" – Y is allowed, but position 4 must be C.
""FECAL"" – L ruled out.
""GEMCA"" – invalid.
""PECCA"" – invalid.
""WECMA"" – invalid.

Wait, let me try ""GEMCA"" – invalid.
""PECCA"" – invalid.
""MECCA"" – invalid.

Actually, the correct word must be _ E _ C A. The only valid word I can think of is ""MECCA"", but it has a second C. However, ""MECCA"" is a valid word and the only candidate fitting the pattern. Given the constraints, I'll proceed with ""MECCA"".

But wait, let me double-check: the pattern is _ E _ C A. The word ""MECCA"" is M E C C A, which has C in positions 4 and 5. The feedback for leach shows C in position 4 and not in position 5 (H(x) at position 5), so the second C is allowed. Therefore, ""MECCA"" is valid.

Thus, the next guess is MECCA.
</think>

Based on the feedback:
- E is confirmed in position 2.
- C is confirmed in position 4.
- A must be in position 5 (since position 3 is ruled out for A and position 1 is ruled out for A).
- The remaining letters must be chosen from unused common letters (D, G, M, P, etc.).

The only valid 5-letter word fitting _ E _ C A is ""MECCA"".
