### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel in English)

This combination should give me good coverage of likely letters and their positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- L is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L
- Letters that ARE in the word (but positions unknown): A, T, E

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, T, E (but not in the positions they occupied in SLATE: A3, T4, E5)
2. Does NOT contain S or L
3. Uses other common letters to test new possibilities

Good candidates would use the remaining common letters: R, N, I, O, U, D, C, M, etc.

Let’s try to place A, T, E in new positions and add two new common consonants. A word like ""RAISE"" comes to mind, but it has S which we know is out. ""TREAD"" uses T, E, A but has D and R. However, we already know T is in the word but not in position 4 (from SLATE feedback). In ""TREAD"", T would be in position 1, which is new. Let me check:
- T(1) - new position
- R - new
- E(3) - new position (originally 5)
- A(4) - new position (originally 3)
- D - new

This seems valid. However, let me think of another word that might be better. ""METER"" has E twice, which might not be optimal. ""EATER"" has E twice as well. ""TEARD"" is not a valid word. 

Another good candidate is ""TREND"":

This uses all the known letters in new positions and introduces R, N, D which are common.

- E (must appear, now at position 2)

2. TREND → T(✓) R(x) E(-) N(-) D(x)
   - T is now in the correct first position (✓).
   - R and D are not in the word (x).
   - E is still in the word but not in position 3.
   - N is in the word but not in position 4.

So far we know:
- Correct letters: T (fixed in position 1)
- Letters that must appear somewhere: A, E, N
- Letters that are out: S, L, R, D

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with T
- Contains A, E, N (each at least once, in unknown positions)
- Does not contain S, L, R, D

Possible letters left to test: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A good candidate is ""TENET"":
- T (✓ at position 1)
- E (must appear, now at position 2)
- N (must appear, now at position 3)
- E (repeats E)
- T (repeats T)

This uses the known letters A, E, N (but we haven't placed A yet). Wait, we must include A somewhere. Let me rethink.

We need to include A, E, N, T (with T fixed at 1). So positions 2-5 must contain A, E, N, and one more letter (since T is already at 1).

A valid word is ""TENGA"":
- T (✓ at 1)
- E (position 2)
- N (position 3)
- G (new)
- A (position 5)

This satisfies all constraints.

Another option is ""TANGY"" but Y is less common. ""TENGA"" seems better.

Let me go with ""TENGA"".

From all feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(-) E(-)
   - Letters not in the word: S, L
   - Letters in the word but misplaced: A, T, E

2. TREND → T(✓) R(x) E(-) N(-) D(x)
   - T is now correctly placed at position 1.
   - R and D are not in the word.
   - E is in the word but not in position 3.
   - N is in the word but not in position 4.

3. TENGA → T(✓) E(-) N(-) G(x) A(-)
   - T remains correctly at position 1.
   - E is still in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.
   - N is still in the word but not in positions 3 or 4.
   - G is not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in positions 3 or 5.

So we know:
- Word starts with T
- Must contain A, E, N (each at least once, but positions still unknown)
- Must not contain: S, L, R, D, G
- A can't be in positions 3 or 5 → must be in 2 or 4
- E can't be in positions 2 or 3 → must be in 4 or 5
- N can't be in positions 3 or 4 → must be in 2 or 5

Let’s list possible positions for each letter:
- Position 1: T (fixed)
- Position 2: A or N
- Position 3: must be one of the remaining letters (not S,L,R,D,G)
- Position 4: A or E or N
- Position 5: E or N or A (but A can't be here, so E or N)

We need to place A, E, N in positions 2-5 without conflict.

One possible arrangement:
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: new letter (must be from remaining: B, C, F, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y)
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: N

This gives T A _ E N

We need a valid 5-letter word starting with T, having A in 2, E in 4, N in 5, and a consonant in 3. The only common word that fits is ""TACEN"" (but not valid) or ""TAPEN"" (invalid). Let me think of real words.

Another arrangement:
- Position 2: N
- Position 3: new letter
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: E

This gives T N _ A E

A valid word is ""TNAKE"" (invalid). ""TNAKE"" isn't a word. ""TNAKE"" → no.

Another arrangement:
- Position 2: N
- Position 3: new letter
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: A

This gives T N _ E A

A valid word is ""TNECA"" (invalid). ""TNECA"" → no.

Let me try ""TAPEN"" (invalid). ""TACEN"" (invalid). 

Wait, let's list possible consonants for position 3: B, C, F, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y.

Possible words:
- T A B E N → ""TABEN"" (invalid)
- T A C E N → ""TACEN"" (invalid)
- T A F E N → ""TAFEN"" (invalid)
- T A H E N → ""TAHEN"" (invalid)
- T A K E N → ""TAKEN"" (valid!)

""TAKEN"" fits:
- T at 1 (✓)
- A at 2 (allowed)
- K (new, allowed)
- E at 4 (allowed)
- N at 5 (allowed)

No conflicts with previous feedback. This seems like the best next guess.

Based on the feedback, the word starts with T and must contain A, E, N in some positions. The constraints narrow it down to ""TAKEN"".
