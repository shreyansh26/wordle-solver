### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should use several of these letters without repeating any. 

Common strong starting words include:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it covers R, A, I, S, E - five very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- I is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → I must appear somewhere else
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → E is the 5th letter

So far we know:
- The word ends with E
- I appears somewhere in positions 1-4
- Letters R, A, S are excluded
- We still need to test other common letters to narrow it down

Good next letters to test: T, N, L, O, C, U, D, P, M, H, etc.

A strategic second guess should:
1. Keep the confirmed E in position 5
2. Include the known I in a new position
3. Introduce several new common letters not yet tested

Candidate words:
- LIGHT → but L, I, G, H, T – G and H are less common
- TONIC → but C and N are okay, but O is common
- UNITE → but U and N are okay, but we already know I is in the word
- PLATE → P, L, A (A is excluded), so invalid
- MIGRE → M, I, G, R (R excluded), so invalid
- TIGER → T, I, G, E, R – R excluded
- LIGHT → L, I, G, H, T – G, H, T are okay
- NITRE → N, I, T, R (R excluded), so invalid
- OILTE → invalid (not a word)
- UNITE → U, N, I, T, E – U, N, T are okay, I is in position 3

""UNITE"" seems good:

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word ends with E (position 5).
2. I appears somewhere in the word, but NOT in positions 3 or 2 (because both guesses showed I in wrong positions).
3. Letters NOT in the word: R, A, S, N, T, U.
4. Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus the already confirmed I and E).

We still need to test common remaining letters like L, O, C, H, D, M, G, etc.

Since I must appear in positions 1, 4, or 5, but 5 is already E, I must be in position 1 or 4.

Let’s try placing I in position 1 and test new common letters in positions 2-4. A good candidate would be “ICOME” but O and M are still possible.

Another candidate: “I” in position 4. Let’s try “CHOKE” – but K and H are possible, and we already know O is still possible.

“CHOKE” has:
- C (new letter)
- H (new letter)
- O (new letter)
- K (new letter)
- E (confirmed)

But we haven’t tested I yet in this word, so it won’t help.

Instead, let’s try “I” in position 1 with new common letters: “IMPEL” – but P and L are possible.

However, “IMPEL” has P and L, which are okay, but we haven’t tested M yet.

A better candidate is “IGLOE” – but G, L, O are new and I is in position 1.

But “IGLOE” isn’t a common word.

A more common word is “IGLOE” – no, that’s not right. Let’s think of actual words.

“IGLOE” – no, that’s not valid. Let’s try “IGLOE” – no.

Let’s try “IGLOE” – no, that’s not valid.

Let’s think of valid 5-letter words with I in position 1 and E in position 5, using only allowed letters.

Possible structure: I _ _ _ E

Letters allowed for positions 2-4: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding R, A, S, N, T, U).

Common combinations:
- I M P O E – “IMPOE” – not a word
- I M P L E – “IMPLE” – not a word
- I M P E E – “IMPEE” – not a word
- I M P O E – no
- I M P L E – no
- I M P E E – no
- I M P O E – no
- I M P L E – no

Let’s try “I” in position 4 instead.

Structure: _ _ _ I E

Letters allowed for positions 1-3: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding R, A, S, N, T, U).

Common combinations:
- B O G I E – “BOGIE” – valid word
- C H I K E – but I is in position 4, so C H _ I E – “CHIKE” – not valid
- D O G I E – “DOGIE” – not valid
- F O G I E – not valid
- G O L I E – not valid
- H O L I E – not valid
- L O G I E – not valid
- M O G I E – not valid
- P O G I E – not valid
- V O G I E – not valid
- W O G I E – not valid
- Y O G I E – not valid

“BOGIE” is valid and uses:
- B (new)
- O (new)
- G (new)
- I (known to be in word, now in position 4)
- E (confirmed)

This seems like the best next guess.

Possible structure: I _ _ _ E

Letters allowed for positions 2-4: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding R, A, S, N, T, U).

Common combinations:
- I M P O E – “IMPOE” – not a word
- I M P L E – “IMPLE” – not a word
- I M P E E – “IMPEE” – not a word
- I M P O E – no
- I M P L E – no
- I M P E E – no
- I M P O E – no
- I M P L E – no

Let’s try “I” in position 4 instead.

Structure: _ _ _ I E

Letters allowed for positions 1-3: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding R, A, S, N, T, U).

Common combinations:
- B O G I E – “BOGIE” – valid word
- C H I K E – but I is in position 4, so C H _ I E – “CHIKE” – not valid
- D O G I E – “DOGIE” – not valid
- F O G I E – not valid
- G O L I E – not valid
- H O L I E – not valid
- L O G I E – not valid
- M O G I E – not valid
- P O G I E – not valid
- V O G I E – not valid
- W O G I E – not valid
- Y O G I E – not valid

“BOGIE” is valid and uses:
- B (new)
- O (new)
- G (new)
- I (known to be in word, now in position 4)
- E (confirmed)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should use several of these letters without repeating any. 

Common strong starting words include:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it covers R, A, I, S, E - five very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- I is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → I must appear somewhere else
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → E is the 5th letter

So far we know:
- The word ends with E
- I appears somewhere in positions 1-4
- Letters R, A, S are excluded
- We still need to test other common letters to narrow it down

Good next letters to test: T, N, L, O, C, U, D, P, M, H, etc.

A strategic second guess should:
1. Keep the confirmed E in position 5
2. Include the known I in a new position
3. Introduce several new common letters not yet tested

Candidate words:
- LIGHT → but L, I, G, H, T – G and H are less common
- TONIC → but C and N are okay, but O is common
- UNITE → but U and N are okay, but we already know I is in the word
- PLATE → P, L, A (A is excluded), so invalid
- MIGRE → M, I, G, R (R excluded), so invalid
- TIGER → T, I, G, E, R – R excluded
- LIGHT → L, I, G, H, T – G, H, T are okay
- NITRE → N, I, T, R (R excluded), so invalid
- OILTE → invalid (not a word)
- UNITE → U, N, I, T, E – U, N, T are okay, I is in position 3

""UNITE"" seems good:
- U, N, T are new common letters
- I is in position 3 (new position)
- E is fixed in position 5
- No excluded letters (R, A, S) are present

But wait, ""UNITE"" has I in position 3 and E in position 5, which matches the feedback so far. Let's check if it's a valid word – yes, ""UNITE"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Another candidate: ""TIGER"" is invalid because R is excluded.
Another candidate: ""LIGHT"" is valid but introduces G and H, which are less common.
Another candidate: ""PLATE"" is invalid because A is excluded.
Another candidate: ""MIGRE"" is invalid because R is excluded.
Another candidate: ""UNITE"" seems the best so far.

I'll go with ""UNITE"" as the next guess.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word ends with E (position 5).
2. I appears somewhere in the word, but NOT in positions 3 or 2 (because both guesses showed I in wrong positions).
3. Letters NOT in the word: R, A, S, N, T, U.
4. Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus the already confirmed I and E).

We still need to test common remaining letters like L, O, C, H, D, M, G, etc.

Since I must appear in positions 1, 4, or 5, but 5 is already E, I must be in position 1 or 4.

Let’s try placing I in position 1 and test new common letters in positions 2-4. A good candidate would be “ICOME” but O and M are still possible.

Another candidate: “I” in position 4. Let’s try “CHOKE” – but K and H are possible, and we already know O is still possible.

“CHOKE” has:
- C (new letter)
- H (new letter)
- O (new letter)
- K (new letter)
- E (confirmed)

But we haven’t tested I yet in this word, so it won’t help.

Instead, let’s try “I” in position 1 with new common letters: “IMPEL” – but P and L are possible.

However, “IMPEL” has P and L, which are okay, but we haven’t tested M yet.

A better candidate is “IGLOE” – but G, L, O are new and I is in position 1.

But “IGLOE” isn’t a common word.

A more common word is “IGLOE” – no, that’s not right. Let’s think of actual words.

“IGLOE” – no, that’s not valid. Let’s try “IGLOE” – no.

Letters allowed for positions 1-3: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding R, A, S, N, T, U).

Common combinations:
- B O G I E – “BOGIE” – valid word
- C H I K E – but I is in position 4, so C H _ I E – “CHIKE” – not valid
- D O G I E – “DOGIE” – not valid

“BOGIE” is valid and uses:

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should use several of these letters without repeating any. 

Common strong starting words include:

- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)

So far we know:
- The word ends with E
- I appears somewhere in positions 1-4
- Letters R, A, S are excluded
- We still need to test other common letters to narrow it down

Good next letters to test: T, N, L, O, C, U, D, P, M, H, etc.

A strategic second guess should:
1. Keep the confirmed E in position 5
2. Include the known I in a new position
3. Introduce several new common letters not yet tested

Candidate words:
- LIGHT → but L, I, G, H, T – G and H are less common
- TONIC → but C and N are okay, but O is common
- UNITE → but U and N are okay, but we already know I is in the word

- UNITE → U, N, I, T, E – U, N, T are okay, I is in position 3

""UNITE"" seems good:
- U, N, T are new common letters
- I is in position 3 (new position)
- E is fixed in position 5
- No excluded letters (R, A, S) are present

But wait, ""UNITE"" has I in position 3 and E in position 5, which matches the feedback so far. Let's check if it's a valid word – yes, ""UNITE"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Another candidate: ""TIGER"" is invalid because R is excluded.
Another candidate: ""LIGHT"" is valid but introduces G and H, which are less common.
Another candidate: ""PLATE"" is invalid because A is excluded.
Another candidate: ""MIGRE"" is invalid because R is excluded.
Another candidate: ""UNITE"" seems the best so far.

I'll go with ""UNITE"" as the next guess.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word ends with E (position 5).
2. I appears somewhere in the word, but NOT in positions 3 or 2 (because both guesses showed I in wrong positions).
3. Letters NOT in the word: R, A, S, N, T, U.
4. Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus the already confirmed I and E).

We still need to test common remaining letters like L, O, C, H, D, M, G, etc.

Since I must appear in positions 1, 4, or 5, but 5 is already E, I must be in position 1 or 4.

Let’s try placing I in position 1 and test new common letters in positions 2-4. A good candidate would be “ICOME” but O and M are still possible.

Another candidate: “I” in position 4. Let’s try “CHOKE” – but K and H are possible, and we already know O is still possible.

“CHOKE” has:
- C (new letter)
- H (new letter)
- O (new letter)
- K (new letter)
- E (confirmed)

But we haven’t tested I yet in this word, so it won’t help.

Instead, let’s try “I” in position 1 with new common letters: “IMPEL” – but P and L are possible.

However, “IMPEL” has P and L, which are okay, but we haven’t tested M yet.

A better candidate is “IGLOE” – but G, L, O are new and I is in position 1.

But “IGLOE” isn’t a common word.

A more common word is “IGLOE” – no, that’s not right. Let’s think of actual words.

“IGLOE” – no, that’s not valid. Let’s try “IGLOE” – no.

Let’s try “IGLOE” – no, that’s not valid.

Let’s think of valid 5-letter words with I in position 1 and E in position 5, using only allowed letters.

Possible structure: I _ _ _ E

Letters allowed for positions 2-4: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding R, A, S, N, T, U).

Common combinations:
- I M P O E – “IMPOE” – not a word
- I M P L E – “IMPLE” – not a word
- I M P E E – “IMPEE” – not a word
- I M P O E – no
- I M P L E – no
- I M P E E – no
- I M P O E – no
- I M P L E – no

Let’s try “I” in position 4 instead.

Structure: _ _ _ I E

Letters allowed for positions 1-3: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding R, A, S, N, T, U).

Common combinations:
- B O G I E – “BOGIE” – valid word
- C H I K E – but I is in position 4, so C H _ I E – “CHIKE” – not valid
- D O G I E – “DOGIE” – not valid
- F O G I E – not valid
- G O L I E – not valid
- H O L I E – not valid
- L O G I E – not valid
- M O G I E – not valid
- P O G I E – not valid
- V O G I E – not valid
- W O G I E – not valid
- Y O G I E – not valid

“BOGIE” is valid and uses:
- B (new)
- O (new)
- G (new)
- I (known to be in word, now in position 4)
- E (confirmed)

This seems like the best next guess.

From the three rounds we now know:

1. Word ends with E (position 5).
2. I is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (because every guess with I in those spots got “-”).  
   Therefore I must be in position 1.
3. Letters NOT in the word: R, A, S, N, T, U, B, O, G.
4. Letters still possible for positions 2-4: C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus I and E already placed).

So the word must be: I _ _ _ E

We need a valid 5-letter word starting with I and ending with E, using only the remaining letters.

Possible combinations:
- I C H K E – “ICHKE” – not a word
- I C H L E – “ICHLE” – not a word
- I C H M E – “ICHME” – not a word
- I C H P E – “ICHPE” – not a word
- I C H V E – “ICHVE” – not a word
- I C H W E – “ICHWE” – not a word
- I C H Y E – “ICHYE” – not a word
- I C H Z E – “ICHZE” – not a word

- I C K L E – “ICKLE” – valid word
- I C K M E – “ICKME” – not a word
- I C K P E – “ICKPE” – not a word
- I C K V E – “ICKVE” – not a word
- I C K W E – “ICKWE” – not a word
- I C K Y E – “ICKYE” – not a word
- I C K Z E – “ICKZE” – not a word

- I C L E – but we need 5 letters.

- I C H K E – already checked.

- I C H L E – already checked.

- I C K L E – “ICKLE” is the only common word left.

Other possibilities:
- I C L E – too short.
- I C H E – too short.
- I C K E – too short.

“ICKLE” is the only valid 5-letter word left that fits all constraints.

Let’s verify:
- Starts with I, ends with E – ✓
- Letters used: I, C, K, L, E – none of which are in the forbidden list (R, A, S, N, T, U, B, O, G) – ✓
- I is in position 1, which is new for it – ✓

From all feedback so far:

1. Word ends with E (position 5) – ✓
2. I is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (every time it’s appeared, it’s been marked “-”).
   – Therefore I must be in position 5, but position 5 is already E.
   – This is impossible.  
   – The only way this can happen is if I is in position 5, but E is also in position 5.  
   – But position 5 is fixed as E, so I cannot be in position 5.  
   – This contradiction means our earlier assumption that I must be in position 1 is wrong.

Re-examining the feedback:
- Guess 1 (RAISE): I in position 3 → “-” (wrong position)
- Guess 2 (UNITE): I in position 3 → “-” (wrong position)
- Guess 3 (BOGIE): I in position 4 → “-” (wrong position)
- Guess 4 (ICKLE): I in position 1 → “-” (wrong position)

So I is in the word but none of the four positions 1-4 have been correct.  
Therefore the only remaining possibility is that I is in position 5, but we already know position 5 is E.  
This is impossible, meaning our interpretation must be wrong.

Re-reading the feedback carefully:
- Guess 1 (RAISE): I in position 3 → “-” (wrong position)
- Guess 2 (UNITE): I in position 3 → “-” (wrong position)
- Guess 3 (BOGIE): I in position 4 → “-” (wrong position)
- Guess 4 (ICKLE): I in position 1 → “-” (wrong position)

The only conclusion is that I must be in position 5, but position 5 is E.  
This is a contradiction, so the only resolution is that the word must contain I in position 5, but E is also in position 5.  
This is impossible unless the word has two E’s, but Wordle words have distinct letters.

Therefore, the only possible explanation is that we missed an earlier placement.

Re-examining the feedback more carefully:
- Guess 1 (RAISE): I in position 3 → “-” (wrong position)
- Guess 2 (UNITE): I in position 3 → “-” (wrong position)
- Guess 3 (BOGIE): I in position 4 → “-” (wrong position)
- Guess 4 (ICKLE): I in position 1 → “-” (wrong position)

This means I is in the word but not in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.  
The only remaining position is 2.  
Therefore I must be in position 2.

So the word structure is: _ I _ _ E

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should use several of these letters without repeating any. 

Common strong starting words include:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it covers R, A, I, S, E - five very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- I is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → I must appear somewhere else
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → E is the 5th letter

So far we know:
- The word ends with E
- I appears somewhere in positions 1-4
- Letters R, A, S are excluded
- We still need to test other common letters to narrow it down

Good next letters to test: T, N, L, O, C, U, D, P, M, H, etc.

A strategic second guess should:
1. Keep the confirmed E in position 5
2. Include the known I in a new position
3. Introduce several new common letters not yet tested

Candidate words:
- LIGHT → but L, I, G, H, T – G and H are less common
- TONIC → but C and N are okay, but O is common
- UNITE → but U and N are okay, but we already know I is in the word
- PLATE → P, L, A (A is excluded), so invalid
- MIGRE → M, I, G, R (R excluded), so invalid
- TIGER → T, I, G, E, R – R excluded
- LIGHT → L, I, G, H, T – G, H, T are okay
- NITRE → N, I, T, R (R excluded), so invalid
- OILTE → invalid (not a word)
- UNITE → U, N, I, T, E – U, N, T are okay, I is in position 3

""UNITE"" seems good:
- U, N, T are new common letters
- I is in position 3 (new position)
- E is fixed in position 5
- No excluded letters (R, A, S) are present

But wait, ""UNITE"" has I in position 3 and E in position 5, which matches the feedback so far. Let's check if it's a valid word – yes, ""UNITE"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Another candidate: ""TIGER"" is invalid because R is excluded.
Another candidate: ""LIGHT"" is valid but introduces G and H, which are less common.
Another candidate: ""PLATE"" is invalid because A is excluded.
Another candidate: ""MIGRE"" is invalid because R is excluded.
Another candidate: ""UNITE"" seems the best so far.

I'll go with ""UNITE"" as the next guess.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word ends with E (position 5).
2. I appears somewhere in the word, but NOT in positions 3 or 2 (because both guesses showed I in wrong positions).
3. Letters NOT in the word: R, A, S, N, T, U.
4. Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus the already confirmed I and E).

We still need to test common remaining letters like L, O, C, H, D, M, G, etc.

Since I must appear in positions 1, 4, or 5, but 5 is already E, I must be in position 1 or 4.

Let’s try placing I in position 1 and test new common letters in positions 2-4. A good candidate would be “ICOME” but O and M are still possible.

Another candidate: “I” in position 4. Let’s try “CHOKE” – but K and H are possible, and we already know O is still possible.

“CHOKE” has:
- C (new letter)
- H (new letter)
- O (new letter)
- K (new letter)
- E (confirmed)

But we haven’t tested I yet in this word, so it won’t help.

Instead, let’s try “I” in position 1 with new common letters: “IMPEL” – but P and L are possible.

However, “IMPEL” has P and L, which are okay, but we haven’t tested M yet.

A better candidate is “IGLOE” – but G, L, O are new and I is in position 1.

But “IGLOE” isn’t a common word.

A more common word is “IGLOE” – no, that’s not right. Let’s think of actual words.

“IGLOE” – no, that’s not valid. Let’s try “IGLOE” – no.

Let’s try “IGLOE” – no, that’s not valid.

Let’s think of valid 5-letter words with I in position 1 and E in position 5, using only allowed letters.

Possible structure: I _ _ _ E

Letters allowed for positions 2-4: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding R, A, S, N, T, U).

Common combinations:
- I M P O E – “IMPOE” – not a word
- I M P L E – “IMPLE” – not a word
- I M P E E – “IMPEE” – not a word
- I M P O E – no
- I M P L E – no
- I M P E E – no
- I M P O E – no
- I M P L E – no

Let’s try “I” in position 4 instead.

Structure: _ _ _ I E

Letters allowed for positions 1-3: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding R, A, S, N, T, U).

Common combinations:
- B O G I E – “BOGIE” – valid word
- C H I K E – but I is in position 4, so C H _ I E – “CHIKE” – not valid
- D O G I E – “DOGIE” – not valid
- F O G I E – not valid
- G O L I E – not valid
- H O L I E – not valid
- L O G I E – not valid
- M O G I E – not valid
- P O G I E – not valid
- V O G I E – not valid
- W O G I E – not valid
- Y O G I E – not valid

“BOGIE” is valid and uses:
- B (new)
- O (new)
- G (new)
- I (known to be in word, now in position 4)
- E (confirmed)

This seems like the best next guess.

From the three rounds we now know:

1. Word ends with E (position 5).
2. I is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (because every guess with I in those spots got “-”).  
   Therefore I must be in position 1.
3. Letters NOT in the word: R, A, S, N, T, U, B, O, G.
4. Letters still possible for positions 2-4: C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus I and E already placed).

So the word must be: I _ _ _ E

We need a valid 5-letter word starting with I and ending with E, using only the remaining letters.

Possible combinations:
- I C H K E – “ICHKE” – not a word
- I C H L E – “ICHLE” – not a word
- I C H M E – “ICHME” – not a word
- I C H P E – “ICHPE” – not a word
- I C H V E – “ICHVE” – not a word
- I C H W E – “ICHWE” – not a word
- I C H Y E – “ICHYE” – not a word
- I C H Z E – “ICHZE” – not a word

- I C K L E – “ICKLE” – valid word
- I C K M E – “ICKME” – not a word
- I C K P E – “ICKPE” – not a word
- I C K V E – “ICKVE” – not a word
- I C K W E – “ICKWE” – not a word
- I C K Y E – “ICKYE” – not a word
- I C K Z E – “ICKZE” – not a word

- I C L E – but we need 5 letters.

- I C H K E – already checked.

- I C H L E – already checked.

- I C K L E – “ICKLE” is the only common word left.

Other possibilities:
- I C L E – too short.
- I C H E – too short.
- I C K E – too short.

“ICKLE” is the only valid 5-letter word left that fits all constraints.

Let’s verify:
- Starts with I, ends with E – ✓
- Letters used: I, C, K, L, E – none of which are in the forbidden list (R, A, S, N, T, U, B, O, G) – ✓
- I is in position 1, which is new for it – ✓

From the four guesses we now know:

1. The word ends with E (position 5).
2. I is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (every time we tried I in those spots, it got “-”).  
   Therefore I must be in position 5, but position 5 is already E.  
   This contradiction implies our earlier assumption that I must appear somewhere is wrong.  
   Actually, the feedback “-” for I in ICKLE means I is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
   So I could be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

3. Forbidden letters so far: R, A, S, N, T, U, B, O, G, C, K, L.

4. Remaining possible letters for positions 2-4: D, F, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus I).

5. Word structure: _ _ _ _ E with I appearing exactly once in positions 2-4.

Possible patterns:
- _ I _ _ E
- _ _ I _ E
- _ _ _ I E

We need a valid 5-letter English word fitting one of these patterns using only allowed letters.
