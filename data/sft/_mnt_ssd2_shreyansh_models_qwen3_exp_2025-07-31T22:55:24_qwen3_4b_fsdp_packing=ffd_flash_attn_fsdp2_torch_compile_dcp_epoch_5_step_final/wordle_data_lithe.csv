### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these common letters without repeating any letters, so we can quickly identify which letters are present and their positions.

One such word is ""AROSE"":
- Contains 5 unique common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
- All letters are very frequent in English words
- This will help us quickly determine which of these common letters are in the secret word and possibly their positions

This is a strong starting guess that should give us good information about the presence and positions of several key letters.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word and in the correct final position (✓).

So the secret word ends with E and does NOT contain A, R, O, S.  
We now know:
- Last letter = E
- Avoid A, R, O, S in all positions

Next guess should:
1. Keep E in the last position.
2. Use new, common letters that weren’t tried yet (e.g., T, N, L, I, C, D, U, etc.).
3. Avoid A, R, O, S entirely.

A good candidate is “UNTIE”:

- Word pattern: _ _ T _ E
- Letters definitely absent: A, R, O, S, U, N
- Letters definitely present: T, E (positions 3 and 5)
- Letter I is somewhere in the word but NOT at position 4.

- Uses I in either position 1 or 2.
- Uses fresh common letters for the other spots.

Let’s consolidate the information we now have.

Known facts:
1. Pattern: _ I T _ E  (positions 2, 3, 5 are locked in)
2. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, N, M
3. Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions we still need to determine:
   - H (from HITME feedback: H(-) – so H is in the word but not in position 1)
   - I (already placed in position 2)
   - T (already placed in position 3)
   - E (already placed in position 5)

So H must appear in either position 4 or 5, but position 5 is already E, so H must be in position 4.

Therefore the word must be _ I T H E.

Now we only need to determine the first letter. It must be a single letter that:
- Has NOT appeared anywhere before (so not A, R, O, S, U, N, M, I, T, E, H)
- Is a valid starting letter for a 5-letter English word ending in ITHE.

Common letters left: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible first letters: B, C, D, F, G, L, P, V, W, Y

Quick scan of common words:
- BITE? No, ends in ITE
- CITE? No, ends in ITE
- DITE? Not a word
- FITE? Not a word
- GITE? Not a word
- LITE? Yes! LITE is a valid 5-letter word ending in ITHE? Wait, LITE is 4 letters. Wait, we need 5 letters ending in ITHE.

Wait, the pattern is _ I T H E, so the word must be 5 letters ending in ITHE. Let me think of words ending in ITHE:

- BITHE? Not a word
- CITHE? Not a word
- FITHE? Not a word
- GITHE? Not a word
- HITHE? Not a word
- JITHE? Not a word
- KITHE? Not a word
- LITHE? Yes! LITHE is a valid 5-letter word ending in ITHE.

Check LITHE:
- L: new letter, not in forbidden list
- I: already known in position 2
- T: already known in position 3
- H: already known in position 4
- E: already known in position 5

This fits perfectly. LITHE is the only common word that fits the pattern _ I T H E.

Therefore the next guess should be LITHE.

Based on the feedback so far, the secret word must be of the form _ I T H E. The only common 5-letter English word that fits this exact pattern is LITHE.
