3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information I can gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with multiple common letters in different positions to quickly identify which letters are in the word.

One of the best starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants. This will help me quickly determine which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so it must be in positions 2-5).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

Since R, O, S, E are out, I need a new set of letters. I want to test other common consonants and vowels. Good remaining consonants include T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc. Vowels left are I, U (since A is confirmed, and O, E are out).

A strong next guess would be a word that uses A in a different spot and introduces several new common letters. ""AUDIO"" is a good candidate because it uses A in position 2, and introduces I, U, D, T. This will help me test the presence of these new letters and potentially narrow down positions for A.

Another option is ""UNTIL"" but that uses T and L which are also good, but AUDIO covers more unique letters. I'll go with AUDIO.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information I can gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with multiple common letters in different positions to quickly identify which letters are in the word.

One of the best starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants. This will help me quickly determine which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so it must be in positions 2-5).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

Since R, O, S, E are out, I need a new set of letters. I want to test other common consonants and vowels. Good remaining consonants include T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc. Vowels left are I, U (since A is confirmed, and O, E are out).

A strong next guess would be a word that uses A in a different spot and introduces several new common letters. ""AUDIO"" is a good candidate because it uses A in position 2, and introduces I, U, D, T. This will help me test the presence of these new letters and potentially narrow down positions for A.

Another option is ""UNTIL"" but that uses T and L which are also good, but AUDIO covers more unique letters. I'll go with AUDIO.

From the feedback so far:
1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   – A is in the word but not in position 1.  
   – R, O, S, E are not in the word.

2. AUDIO → A(-) U(-) D(-) I(x) O(x)  
   – A is still in the word but not in position 1 (confirmed).  
   – U is in the word but not in position 2.  
   – D is in the word but not in position 3.  
   – I and O are not in the word (confirmed).  
   – O is already ruled out.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E, I, O  
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, U, D  
- Positions still possible for A: 2, 3, 4, 5  
- Positions still possible for U: 1, 3, 4, 5  
- Positions still possible for D: 1, 2, 4, 5  

We need a new word that:
- Uses A, U, D (each in a new position)  
- Introduces at least one new letter (since we’ve only tested 5 letters so far, and the word must be 5 letters, we need to test new ones to narrow down).  
- Avoids R, S, E, I, O.

Good remaining common letters: T, N, L, C, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, Y, etc.

A good next word would be “CLOUD” but we already know O is out.  
Another option is “MOUND” – but O is out.  
How about “PLAID”? That uses P, L, A, I, D. But I is already out.  
“DRAFT” – R is out.  
“DUTCH” – C, H are new, and we can test positions for D, U, A.

Let’s try “DUTCH”:
- D in position 1 (new position for D)  
- U in position 2 (new position for U)  
- T is new  
- C is new  
- H is new  

This tests 3 known letters (A, U, D) in new positions and introduces T, C, H.

Current known facts:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E, I, O, T, C, H, P, L, M  
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, U  
- Positions:
  – U is fixed in position 3 (✓).  
  – A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (from earlier feedback).  
  – Wait:  
    – From AROSE: A(-) → not position 1  
    – From AUDIO: A(-) → not position 1 (again)  
    – From PLUMA: A(-) → not position 5  
    – From DUTCH: A is not tested in position 3, so A could be 3, but U is already in 3.  
    – From AUDIO: A(-) → not position 1  
    – From DUTCH: A is not tested in positions 2 or 3  
    – From PLUMA: A(-) → not position 5  
    – So A must be in position 2 or 3, but position 3 is U.  
    – Therefore A must be in position 2.  

So the word has the pattern: _ A U _ _

We still need to test the remaining two positions (1 and 4 or 5) with letters not yet ruled out.  
Available letters (common ones): B, D, F, G, K, N, Y, W, etc.

Possible patterns:

- _ A U D _  
- _ A U _ D  

Let’s try D A U _ _ first.  
We need a letter for position 4 and 5.  
Available letters: B, F, G, K, N, Y, W, etc.  
A valid word: D A U N Y → “DAUNY” (not a common word).

How about D A U G H? – H is out.  
D A U N B – no.  
D A U N G – no.  
D A U N K – no.  
D A U N Y – no.  

Next pattern: _ A U D _  
We need a letter for position 1 and 5.  
Available letters: B, F, G, K, N, Y, W, etc.  
Possible words: B A U D Y – “BAUDY” (valid).  
F A U D Y – “FAUDY” (valid).  
G A U D Y – “GAUDY” (valid).  
K A U D Y – “KAUDY” (valid, but less common).  
N A U D Y – “NAUDY” (valid, but less common).  

Among these, “GAUDY” is a common English word.  
Let’s test it.

<guess>GAUDY</guess>",GAUDY,"Current known facts:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E, I, O, T, C, H, P, L, M  
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, U  
- Positions:
  – U is fixed in position 3 (✓).  
  – A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (from earlier feedback).  
  – Wait:  
    – From AROSE: A(-) → not position 1  
    – From AUDIO: A(-) → not position 1 (again)  
    – From PLUMA: A(-) → not position 5  
    – From DUTCH: A is not tested in position 3, so A could be 3, but U is already in 3.  
    – From AUDIO: A(-) → not position 1  
    – From DUTCH: A is not tested in positions 2 or 3  
    – From PLUMA: A(-) → not position 5  
    – So A must be in position 2 or 3, but position 3 is U.  
    – Therefore A must be in position 2.  

So the word has the pattern: _ A U _ _

We still need to test the remaining two positions (1 and 4 or 5) with letters not yet ruled out.  
Available letters (common ones): B, D, F, G, K, N, Y, W, etc.  
We know D is in the word (from earlier feedback), so D must occupy position 1 or 4 or 5.  

Possible patterns:
- D A U _ _  
- _ A U D _  
- _ A U _ D  

Let’s try D A U _ _ first.  
We need a letter for position 4 and 5.  
Available letters: B, F, G, K, N, Y, W, etc.  
A valid word: D A U N Y → “DAUNY” (not a common word).  
Another: D A U N _ → “DAUN_” – no common word.  
How about D A U G H? – H is out.  
D A U N B – no.  
D A U N G – no.  
D A U N K – no.  
D A U N Y – no.  

Next pattern: _ A U D _  
We need a letter for position 1 and 5.  
Available letters: B, F, G, K, N, Y, W, etc.  
Possible words: B A U D Y – “BAUDY” (valid).  
F A U D Y – “FAUDY” (valid).  
G A U D Y – “GAUDY” (valid).  
K A U D Y – “KAUDY” (valid, but less common).  
N A U D Y – “NAUDY” (valid, but less common).  

Among these, “GAUDY” is a common English word.  
Let’s test it.",Guess 5: GAUDY -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) A(✓) U(✓) D(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
