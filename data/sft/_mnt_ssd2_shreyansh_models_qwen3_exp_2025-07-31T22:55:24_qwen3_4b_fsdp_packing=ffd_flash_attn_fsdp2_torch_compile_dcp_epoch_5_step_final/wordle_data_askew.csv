### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained from the feedback. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with a mix of these letters to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters: A, R, O, S, E. This gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word, regardless of their positions. Another good option is ""STARE"" or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly more balanced.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is correct in position 1.
- R is NOT in the word.
- O is NOT in the word.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the secret word looks like:
A _ _ _ _

Letters we know are in the word: S, E
Letters we know are NOT in the word: R, O

Positions:
- Position 1: A (fixed)
- Position 4: not S
- Position 5: not E

We need a 5-letter word starting with A, containing both S and E, and avoiding R and O. Let's think of possible words:
- A S E _ _  → but we need 5 letters
- A _ S E _  → possible
- A _ _ S E → but E cannot be last
- A _ S _ E → but E cannot be last

Possible words:
- A S E T _  → but we need to include S and E
- A S E N T → but we don't know N or T yet
- A S E T H → but H is not confirmed
- A S E N T → seems possible
- A S E T _ → but we need 5 letters

Another approach: since S and E must appear somewhere in positions 2-4 (since 5 is ruled out for E and 4 is ruled out for S), and we have to avoid R and O.

Possible words:
- A S E N T → A S E N T
- A S E D _ → but we need 5 letters
- A S E N _ → but we need 5 letters
- A S E N T → seems valid
- A S E N _ → but we need 5 letters
- A S E N T → this is a valid word

Let me check other possibilities:
- A S E N T → A S E N T
- A S E N _ → but we need 5 letters
- A S E N T → this seems like the best fit

I'll go with A S E N T as the next guess.

   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. ASENT → A(✓) S(✓) E(-) N(x) T(x)
   - A is still fixed in position 1.
   - S is now confirmed in position 2.
   - E is in the word but not in position 3 (since feedback shows E(-) here).
   - N and T are not in the word.

So far the pattern is: A S _ _ _

Letters still unknown: positions 3, 4, 5.
Letters we know are in the word: E (must appear once, not in position 3 or 5, so it must be in position 4).
Letters we know are not in the word: R, O, N, T.

Thus the word must be: A S E _ _

Now we need a 5-letter word starting with A S E _ _ that uses only letters not yet ruled out (i.e., not R, O, N, T).

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for valid 5-letter words starting with ASE:
- ASER_ → but R is ruled out.
- ASEB_ → not a valid word.
- ASER_ → R ruled out.
- ASEK_ → not valid.
- ASE_ _ → need to find a valid word.

Valid English words starting with ASE:
- ASEAN (but N is ruled out)
- ASELS (but L and S are allowed, but S is already in position 2)
- ASHES (but H and S are allowed)

- Letters used: A, S, I, D, E
- All letters are allowed (I, D not ruled out)
- E is in position 5, but earlier feedback said E(-) in position 5 (from AROSE), so E cannot be in position 5.

Oops, that’s a conflict. ASIDE has E in position 5, which is ruled out.

This seems valid.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained from the feedback. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with a mix of these letters to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters: A, R, O, S, E. This gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word, regardless of their positions. Another good option is ""STARE"" or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly more balanced.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is correct in position 1.
- R is NOT in the word.
- O is NOT in the word.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the secret word looks like:
A _ _ _ _

Letters we know are in the word: S, E
Letters we know are NOT in the word: R, O

Positions:
- Position 1: A (fixed)
- Position 4: not S
- Position 5: not E

We need a 5-letter word starting with A, containing both S and E, and avoiding R and O. Let's think of possible words:
- A S E _ _  → but we need 5 letters
- A _ S E _  → possible
- A _ _ S E → but E cannot be last
- A _ S _ E → but E cannot be last

Possible words:
- A S E T _  → but we need to include S and E
- A S E N T → but we don't know N or T yet
- A S E T H → but H is not confirmed
- A S E N T → seems possible
- A S E T _ → but we need 5 letters

Another approach: since S and E must appear somewhere in positions 2-4 (since 5 is ruled out for E and 4 is ruled out for S), and we have to avoid R and O.

Possible words:
- A S E N T → A S E N T
- A S E D _ → but we need 5 letters
- A S E N _ → but we need 5 letters
- A S E N T → seems valid
- A S E N _ → but we need 5 letters
- A S E N T → this is a valid word

Let me check other possibilities:
- A S E N T → A S E N T
- A S E N _ → but we need 5 letters
- A S E N T → this seems like the best fit

I'll go with A S E N T as the next guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: ASENT -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) S(✓) E(-) N(x) T(x)

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - A is fixed in position 1.
   - R and O are not in the word.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. ASENT → A(✓) S(✓) E(-) N(x) T(x)
   - A is still fixed in position 1.
   - S is now confirmed in position 2.
   - E is in the word but not in position 3 (since feedback shows E(-) here).
   - N and T are not in the word.

So far the pattern is: A S _ _ _

Letters still unknown: positions 3, 4, 5.
Letters we know are in the word: E (must appear once, not in position 3 or 5, so it must be in position 4).
Letters we know are not in the word: R, O, N, T.

Thus the word must be: A S E _ _

Now we need a 5-letter word starting with A S E _ _ that uses only letters not yet ruled out (i.e., not R, O, N, T).

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for valid 5-letter words starting with ASE:
- ASER_ → but R is ruled out.
- ASEB_ → not a valid word.
- ASER_ → R ruled out.
- ASEK_ → not valid.
- ASE_ _ → need to find a valid word.

Valid English words starting with ASE:
- ASEAN (but N is ruled out)
- ASELS (but L and S are allowed, but S is already in position 2)
- ASHES (but H and S are allowed)
- ASIDE (but D and I are allowed)
- ASEPT (but P and T are allowed, but T is ruled out)
- ASHES (H and S are allowed)
- ASIDE (I and D are allowed)

From these, the most common and valid word is ASIDE.

Checking letters:
- A S I D E
- Letters used: A, S, I, D, E
- All letters are allowed (I, D not ruled out)
- E is in position 5, but earlier feedback said E(-) in position 5 (from AROSE), so E cannot be in position 5.

Oops, that’s a conflict. ASIDE has E in position 5, which is ruled out.

Next possible word: ASHES
- A S H E S
- E appears twice, but we don’t know if E is duplicated.
- Letters used: A, S, H, E, S
- S is already in position 2, and S can appear again (no rule against it yet).
- E is in position 4, which is allowed (since E(-) in position 5 from AROSE means E is not in 5, but 4 is fine).

This seems valid.

Another possibility: ASKED
- A S K E D
- Letters: A, S, K, E, D
- E in position 4 (allowed), no ruled-out letters used.

Between ASHES and ASKED, both are valid. ASKED seems more common.

Let me choose ASKED.

From the three rounds of feedback we now have:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - A is fixed in position 1.
   - R and O are not in the word.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. ASENT → A(✓) S(✓) E(-) N(x) T(x)
   - A is still fixed in position 1.
   - S is confirmed in position 2.
   - E is in the word but not in position 3 (since feedback shows E(-) here).
   - N and T are not in the word.

3. ASKED → A(✓) S(✓) K(✓) E(✓) D(x)
   - A is still fixed in position 1.
   - S is confirmed in position 2.
   - K is in the word and in position 3.
   - E is confirmed in position 4.
   - D is not in the word.

So the current pattern is: A S K E _

We only need to determine the final letter (position 5).  
Letters already ruled out: R, O, N, T, D  
Letters still allowed: any letter except those five, and we know the word must be valid.

Looking for valid 5-letter words that start with A S K E _:
- ASKEY (Y is allowed)
- ASKER (R is ruled out)
- ASKEW (W is allowed)

Between ASKEY and ASKEW, both are valid. ASKEW is more common, so I’ll guess ASKEW.
