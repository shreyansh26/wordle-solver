### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the word and which are not. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, T, R, O, L, N, S, etc. 

Looking at these common letters, the word ""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because it contains five very common letters: A, R, O, S, E. This should give me good information about which of these letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on ""arose"":

- A, R, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word looks like: _ _ O _ _

1. Has O in the third position.
2. Does not contain A, R, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the word and which are not. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, T, R, O, L, N, S, etc. 

Looking at these common letters, the word ""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because it contains five very common letters: A, R, O, S, E. This should give me good information about which of these letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- O is in the word and in the correct position (third letter).
- A, R, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word looks like: _ _ O _ _

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in the third position.
2. Does not contain A, R, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good letters to try next: T, N, L, I, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

A strong second guess would be ""POINT"":
- P, I, N, T are all common letters not yet tested.
- O is already known to be in position 3, so the word is _ _ O _ _.
- ""POINT"" fits this pattern perfectly: _ _ O _ _.

Let's try ""POINT"".

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
   - Word pattern: _ _ O _ _
   - Letters ruled out: A, R, S, E

2. point → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(-)
   - Word pattern still: _ _ O _ _
   - Letters ruled out: P, I, N
   - T is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 5).

So we now know:
- Third letter is O.
- T exists somewhere in the word, but not in position 5.
- Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding the already ruled-out letters).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 3.
- Contains T somewhere (not position 5).
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

A good next guess should test new common letters while respecting the constraints. Let's try ""GLOAT"":
- G, L, A, O, T.
- O is in position 3 (✓).
- T is in position 5, but we know T cannot be in position 5 (from point feedback). So GLOAT is invalid because T would be in position 5.

Next candidate: ""HOTEL"":
- H, O, T, E, L.
- E is already ruled out (from arose feedback).

Next candidate: ""CLOUT"":
- C, L, O, U, T.
- O is in position 3 (✓).
- T is in position 5, which is invalid (cannot be position 5).

Next candidate: ""FLOUT"":
- F, L, O, U, T.
- O is in position 3 (✓).
- T is in position 5, which is invalid.

Next candidate: ""MOTIF"":
- M, O, T, I, F.
- I is ruled out (from point feedback).

Next candidate: ""MOTEL"":
- M, O, T, E, L.
- E is ruled out.

Next candidate: ""BLOAT"":
- B, L, O, A, T.
- A is ruled out.

Next candidate: ""DROIT"":
- D, R, O, I, T.
- R and I are ruled out.

Next candidate: ""GROUT"":
- G, R, O, U, T.
- R is ruled out.

Next candidate: ""HOTLY"":
- H, O, T, L, Y.
- O is in position 3 (✓).
- T is in position 2 (valid, since T cannot be in position 5).
- Letters used: H, O, T, L, Y — none of which are ruled out.

This looks valid. Let's try ""HOTLY"".

The only valid word I can think of is TOOTH, which fits T O O T H. But we need to check if O is allowed to repeat. The feedback didn't indicate any restriction against repeated letters, so TOOTH is a possibility.

Another candidate: TOMAH is invalid. TONKH is invalid. TOBHA is invalid.

The valid word seems to be TOOTH.

Let me verify:
- T(✓) position 1
- O(✓) position 2
- O(?) position 3 (not yet tested, but allowed)
- T(?) position 4 (not yet tested, but allowed)
- H(✓) position 5

TOOTH is a valid English word and fits the pattern T O _ _ H.

Therefore, my next guess is TOOTH.

<guess>tooth</guess>",tooth,"From the latest feedback:

- T(✓) at position 1
- O(✓) at position 2
- H(✓) at position 5
- Letters ruled out so far: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, L, Y, U, C

So the pattern is now:
T O _ _ H

We still need to fill positions 3 and 4 with letters not yet ruled out. Available letters (excluding the already excluded ones) include B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Possible 5-letter words fitting T O _ _ H:

- TOOTH (but O is already used in position 2, and O is allowed to repeat)
