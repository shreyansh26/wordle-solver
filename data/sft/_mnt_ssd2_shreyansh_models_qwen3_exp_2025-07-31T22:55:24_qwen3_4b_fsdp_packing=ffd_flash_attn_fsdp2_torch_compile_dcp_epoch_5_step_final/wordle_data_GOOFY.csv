### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). 

One of the most effective starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel in English)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter in the secret word and can help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are marked ""x"", meaning none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates the entire set of letters: S, L, A, T, E.

I now need a word that uses **none of those five letters** and still contains common remaining letters to maximize information gain.  
Good candidates are words with letters like R, I, N, O, U, C, H, M, P, etc.  
One strong choice is ""CHURN"":
- C, H, U, R, N are all new letters.
- It has two common vowels (U, sometimes I) and three common consonants (C, H, R, N).

The only letter that has appeared in the feedback at least once is O, which was marked “-” (in the word but wrong position).

Remaining unused common letters include: B, F, G, K, P, V, Y, plus the vowels O (already known to be present) and the consonants J, Q, X, Z (which are less likely).

A good next word should:
1. Contain O (since it’s confirmed in the word).
2. Avoid all eliminated letters (S, L, A, T, E, C, H, U, R, N, M, I, D, W).
3. Use new common letters to maximize information.

A strong candidate is “BOGOF”:
- B, G, F are new letters.
- O is included (must be in the word).
- F is a common consonant.
- B and G are also common.

However, “BOGOF” is not a valid English word.  
A valid word that fits the constraints is “FOGGY”:
- F, G, Y are new letters.
- O is included.
- G is repeated, but that’s acceptable.

But “FOGGY” has two G’s, which might not be optimal.  
A better choice is “BOGUS”:
- B, G, U, S.  
  But U and S are already eliminated.

Next, “BOGGY”:
- B, G, Y are new.
- G is repeated.

A better balanced word is “VOGUE”:
- V, G, U, E.  
  U and E are eliminated.

Next candidate: “POGUE” – U and E eliminated.

“BOGIE” – I and E eliminated.

“GOOFY” – F and Y are new, but O is correct, and G is new.

“GOOFY”:
- G, F, Y are new.
- O is correct (and not in position 4).
- F is new.
- Y is new.

This seems optimal.

Let me check if “GOOFY” is a valid 5-letter word – yes, it is.

So the next guess is GOOFY.
</think>

<guess>GOOFY</guess>",GOOFY,"From the three previous guesses we have eliminated the following letters:
- S, L, A, T, E (from SLATE)
- C, H, U, R, N (from CHURN)
- M, I, D, W (from MIDOW)

The only letter that has appeared in the feedback at least once is O, which was marked “-” (in the word but wrong position).  
That means O is somewhere in the secret word, but not in position 4.

Remaining unused common letters include: B, F, G, K, P, V, Y, plus the vowels O (already known to be present) and the consonants J, Q, X, Z (which are less likely).

A good next word should:
1. Contain O (since it’s confirmed in the word).
2. Avoid all eliminated letters (S, L, A, T, E, C, H, U, R, N, M, I, D, W).
3. Use new common letters to maximize information.
