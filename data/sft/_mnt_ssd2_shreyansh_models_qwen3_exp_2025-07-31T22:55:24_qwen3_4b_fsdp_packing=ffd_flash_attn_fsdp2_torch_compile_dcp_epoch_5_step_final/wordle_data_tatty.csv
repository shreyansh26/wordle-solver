For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. 

A good opening word should:
1. Use common vowels (E, A, O, I)
2. Use common consonants (R, S, T, N, L)
3. Avoid repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible

Looking at these criteria, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most common in English
- No repeating letters
- It tests 5 distinct letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words

This should give me good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. 

A good opening word should:
1. Use common vowels (E, A, O, I)
2. Use common consonants (R, S, T, N, L)
3. Avoid repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible

Looking at these criteria, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most common in English
- No repeating letters
- It tests 5 distinct letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words

This should give me good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter A somewhere (positions 2-5).
2. The letters R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.
3. The remaining letters we haven’t tested yet include: T, L, N, I, U, D, C, M, P, etc.

I want a new 5-letter word that:
- Keeps the A in a different position (not first).
- Uses new letters that haven’t been ruled out.
- Still tests common letters to narrow things down quickly.

A good candidate is “PLAIN”:
- P, L, I, N are all new letters.
- A is moved to position 2, satisfying the feedback.
- All letters are common and useful for narrowing possibilities.

A good candidate is “GUMBA”:
- G, U, M, B are all new letters.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. 

A good opening word should:
1. Use common vowels (E, A, O, I)
2. Use common consonants (R, S, T, N, L)
3. Avoid repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible

Looking at these criteria, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most common in English
- No repeating letters
- It tests 5 distinct letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words

This should give me good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter A somewhere (positions 2-5).
2. The letters R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.
3. The remaining letters we haven’t tested yet include: T, L, N, I, U, D, C, M, P, etc.

I want a new 5-letter word that:
- Keeps the A in a different position (not first).
- Uses new letters that haven’t been ruled out.
- Still tests common letters to narrow things down quickly.

A good candidate is “PLAIN”:
- P, L, I, N are all new letters.
- A is moved to position 2, satisfying the feedback.
- All letters are common and useful for narrowing possibilities.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLAIN -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are not in the word.

2. PLAIN → P(x) L(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - P, L, I, N are not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word must contain the letter A, but not in positions 1 or 3.
- The letters R, O, S, E, P, L, I, N are absent.
- Still-untested common letters: T, U, D, C, M, G, B, F, H, K, Y, W, V, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2, 4, or 5 (since it can’t be 1 or 3).
- Uses only letters that have not been ruled out.
- Tests new, common letters to narrow possibilities.

A good candidate is “GUMBA”:
- G, U, M, B are all new letters.
- A is in position 5 (allowed by feedback).
- All letters are among the most common remaining ones.

Let’s verify:
- G, U, M, B are not in any previous guess.
- A is allowed in position 5.
- No forbidden letters (R, O, S, E, P, L, I, N) are used.

Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLAIN -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)
Guess 3: GUMBA -> FEEDBACK: G(x) U(x) M(x) B(x) A(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word, not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are out.

2. PLAIN → P(x) L(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   - A is in the word, not in position 3.
   - P, L, I, N are out.

3. GUMBA → G(x) U(x) M(x) B(x) A(-)
   - A is in the word, not in position 5.
   - G, U, M, B are out.

Summary of what we know:
- The word contains the letter A, and A is NOT in positions 1, 3, or 5.
- Therefore A must be in position 2 or 4.
- Forbidden letters: R, O, S, E, P, L, I, N, G, U, M, B.
- Still-allowed letters: T, D, C, F, H, K, V, W, Y, plus any others not yet tried.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2 or 4.
- Uses only allowed letters.
- Tests new, common letters.

Let’s try A in position 2 first. A good candidate is “DATCH”:
- D, T, C, H are all allowed and common.
- A is in position 2.
- No forbidden letters appear.

Let’s check: D, A, T, C, H – none are in the forbidden list. This seems like a strong next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLAIN -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)
Guess 3: GUMBA -> FEEDBACK: G(x) U(x) M(x) B(x) A(-)
Guess 4: DATCH -> FEEDBACK: D(x) A(✓) T(✓) C(x) H(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on DATCH:

- D(x) → D is not in the word.
- A(✓) → A is in the word and is in position 2 (correct).
- T(✓) → T is in the word and is in position 3 (correct).
- C(x) → C is not in the word.
- H(x) → H is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word structure: _ A T _ _
- Forbidden letters: R, O, S, E, P, L, I, N, G, U, M, B, D, C, H
- Still-allowed letters: T (already used in position 3), plus any others not yet ruled out (e.g., F, K, V, W, Y, etc.).

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 5, using only allowed letters. Since T is already used in position 3, we can’t repeat it unless the word contains two Ts, but that’s unlikely. So positions 1 and 5 must be filled from the remaining allowed letters.

Looking for common 5-letter words matching _ A T _ _ with allowed letters:
- F A T _ _ → FAT?? – FAT?F, FAT?K, FAT?Y, FAT?V, etc. FAT?F is “FATTF” (invalid), FAT?K is “FATTK” (invalid), FAT?Y is “FATTY” (valid word).
- K A T _ _ → KAT?? – KAT?F, KAT?K, KAT?Y, etc. KAT?Y is “KATTY” (valid word).
- V A T _ _ → VAT?? – VAT?F, VAT?K, VAT?Y, etc. VAT?Y is “VATTY” (invalid), VAT?K is “VATTK” (invalid), VAT?F is “VATTF” (invalid).
- W A T _ _ → WAT?? – WAT?F, WAT?K, WAT?Y, etc. WAT?Y is “WATTY” (invalid).

Between FATTY and KATTY, both are valid. Let’s pick FATTY first as it uses F and Y, both of which are still allowed.

Check FATTY:
- Letters: F, A, T, T, Y.
- A is in position 2 (✓).
- T is in position 3 (✓).
- F and Y are not yet ruled out.
- No forbidden letters appear.

This seems like the best next guess.
