### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, etc.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- It has 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English
- It doesn't repeat any letters, maximizing information gain

This should give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities for the next guesses based on the feedback.

Let's update what we know after both guesses.

From arose:  
- A is in the word but not in position 1.  
- S is in the word but not in position 4.  
- E is in the word but not in position 5.  
- R and O are not in the word.  

From steal:  
- S is in the word but not in position 1.  
- T is not in the word.  
- E is in the word but not in position 3.  
- A is in the word and is in position 4 (✓).  
- L is not in the word.

Combining both sets of information:

Letters we know are in the word: A, S, E  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: R, O, T, L  

Positions we know:  
- A is in position 4.  
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4.  
- E is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5.

So far the pattern is:  
_ _ _ A _

We still need to place S and E in the remaining positions (1, 2, 3, 5) while respecting the constraints.

Possible positions for S: 2 or 3 (cannot be 1 or 4)  
Possible positions for E: 1 or 2 (cannot be 3 or 5)

Let's try to construct a valid word.  
Option 1:  
- Position 1: E  
- Position 2: S  
- Position 3: ?  
- Position 4: A  
- Position 5: ?  

We need two more letters. The remaining letters must not include R, O, T, L.  
Let's pick common consonants: N, D, C, M, etc.

A word that fits: E S _ A _  
Example: ""ESCAP"" – but P is allowed and we need 5 letters.  
""ESCAP"" is not a valid word.  
""ESCAR"" – R is invalid.  
""ESCH"" – too short.  
""ESMA"" – too short.  
""ESPA"" – too short.  
""ESSES"" – has S twice, but we don't know if S is repeated.  
""ESSEN"" – N is allowed, but E is in position 1 (allowed), S in position 2 (allowed), E in position 3 (invalid, E cannot be in 3).  
""ESSAY"" – Y is allowed, but A is already in position 4.  
""ESSAY"" would be E S S A Y – but S is in position 2 and 3, which might be possible, but let's see if we can find a valid word without repeating letters.

Another approach:  
We have positions 1,2,3,5 left.  
We need to place S and E in these, plus two other letters not in {R,O,T,L}.  
Let's try S in position 2 and E in position 1:  
E S _ A _  
We need two more letters. Let's pick N and D: ""ESNAD"" – not a word.  
""ESNAP"" – not a word.  
""ESCAR"" – R invalid.  
""ESCAR"" is invalid.  
""ESSEN"" – E in 1, S in 2, S in 3, E in 4 (but E cannot be in 4, it's in 4 already).  
Wait, E is in 1, S in 2, and we need two more letters.  
""ESCAP"" – not a word.  
""ESCAR"" – R invalid.  
""ESSES"" – S twice, but we don't know if S is repeated.  
""ESSES"" is a word but has S twice.  
""ESSES"" would be E S S E S – but E cannot be in 5 (from arose feedback), and S cannot be in 4 (from arose feedback).  
But in ""ESSES"", E is in 1 and 4, and S is in 2 and 3.  
This seems possible, but let's see if there's a simpler word.

Alternative:  
S in position 3 and E in position 2:  
_ E S A _  
We need two more letters in positions 1 and 5.  
Let's try N and D: ""NESAD"" – not a word.  
""NESAS"" – not a word.  
""NESPA"" – not a word.  
""NESCA"" – not a word.  
""NESSE"" – not a word.  
""NESSE"" – E is in 5 which is invalid (E cannot be in 5).  

Alternative:  
E in position 2 and S in position 3:  
_ E S A _  
Again, need two more letters.  
""NESEA"" – not a word.  
""SEESA"" – not a word.  

Alternative:  
E in position 5 – but E cannot be in 5 (from arose feedback).  
So E must be in 1 or 2.  

Let me try a different approach:  
We have pattern _ _ _ A _  
We need to place S and E in the remaining positions.  
Possible positions for S: 2,3  
Possible positions for E: 1,2  

Let's try E in 1 and S in 2:  
E S _ A _  
We need two more letters.  
Let's pick N and D: ""ESNAD"" – not a word.  
""ESNAP"" – not a word.  
""ESCAR"" – R invalid.  
""ESCAP"" – not a word.  

Let me try E in 1 and S in 3:  
E _ S A _  
Need two more letters.  
""ENSA"" – too short.  
""ENSA_"" – need a 5th letter.  
""ENSA_"" – let's think of valid words:  
""ENSAY"" – Y is allowed, but E is in 1, N in 2, S in 3, A in 4, Y in 5.  
Check constraints:  
- E in 1: allowed (not 3 or 5)  
- S in 3: allowed (not 1 or 4)  
- A in 4: correct  
- No R, O, T, L – N and Y are allowed  
""ENSAY"" is a valid word.  

But let me check if there's a simpler word.  
Another option:  
S in 2 and E in 1:  
E S _ A _  
We need two more letters.  
""ESCAP"" – not a word.  
""ESCAR"" – R invalid.  
""ESSES"" – S twice, but possible.  
""ESSES"" is a valid word.  

Between ""ENSAY"" and ""ESSES"", ""ESSES"" seems simpler.  
Let me choose ""ESSES"" as it uses S twice which might help confirm if S is repeated.  

But wait, let me think again:  
From arose: S is in the word but not in position 4.  
From steal: S is in the word but not in position 1.  
So S could be in 2,3,5.  
From ""ESSES"": S is in 2,3,5 – but we don't know if S is repeated.  

A better word might be ""ESCAP"" – but not valid.  
""ESCAP"" is not a valid word.  
""ESCAR"" – R invalid.  
""ESSEN"" – E in 1, S in 2, S in 3, E in 4 (invalid), N in 5 – but A is in 4.  
So ""ESSEN"" is invalid.  

Another option:  
S in 3 and E in 2:  
_ E S A _  
Need two more letters.  
""NESEA"" – not a word.  
""SEESA"" – not a word.  

Let me try ""EASSE"" – but A is in 4, so ""EASSE"" would be E A S S E – but A is in 2, which is allowed, but we need A in 4.  
So ""EASSE"" is invalid.  

Let me think of valid words:  
""ESSAY"" – E S S A Y – but Y is allowed, E is in 1, S in 2, S in 3, A in 4, Y in 5.  
Check constraints:  
- A in 4: correct  
- S in 2 and 3: allowed (not 1 or 4)  
- E in 1: allowed (not 3 or 5)  
- No R, O, T, L – N and Y are not needed here, but letters used are E, S, A, Y – none of the forbidden letters.  
""ESSAY"" is a valid word.  

This seems the best option so far.  
Let me verify:  
- A is in 4 (✓)  
- S is in 2 and 3 (allowed positions)  
- E is in 1 (allowed)  
- No R, O, T, L – correct  
""ESSAY"" is a valid 5-letter word.
</think>

Based on the feedback so far, we know:
- A is in position 4.
- S and E must appear somewhere in the remaining positions (1,2,3,5) while avoiding their previously excluded spots.
- Forbidden letters: R, O, T, L.

A valid word that satisfies these constraints is:

<guess>essay</guess>",essay,"Let's update what we know after both guesses.

From arose:  
- A is in the word but not in position 1.  
- S is in the word but not in position 4.  
- E is in the word but not in position 5.  
- R and O are not in the word.  

From steal:  
- S is in the word but not in position 1.  
- T is not in the word.  
- E is in the word but not in position 3.  
- A is in the word and is in position 4 (✓).  
- L is not in the word.

Combining both sets of information:

Letters we know are in the word: A, S, E  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: R, O, T, L  

Positions we know:  
- A is in position 4.  
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4.  
- E is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5.

So far the pattern is:  
_ _ _ A _

We still need to place S and E in the remaining positions (1, 2, 3, 5) while respecting the constraints.

Possible positions for S: 2 or 3 (cannot be 1 or 4)  
Possible positions for E: 1 or 2 (cannot be 3 or 5)

Let's try to construct a valid word.  
Option 1:  
- Position 1: E  
- Position 2: S  
- Position 3: ?  
- Position 4: A  
- Position 5: ?  

We need two more letters. The remaining letters must not include R, O, T, L.  
Let's pick common consonants: N, D, C, M, etc.

A word that fits: E S _ A _  
Example: ""ESCAP"" – but P is allowed and we need 5 letters.  
""ESCAP"" is not a valid word.  
""ESCAR"" – R is invalid.  
""ESCH"" – too short.  
""ESMA"" – too short.  
""ESPA"" – too short.  
""ESSES"" – has S twice, but we don't know if S is repeated.  
""ESSEN"" – N is allowed, but E is in position 1 (allowed), S in position 2 (allowed), E in position 3 (invalid, E cannot be in 3).  
""ESSAY"" – Y is allowed, but A is already in position 4.  
""ESSAY"" would be E S S A Y – but S is in position 2 and 3, which might be possible, but let's see if we can find a valid word without repeating letters.

Another approach:  
We have positions 1,2,3,5 left.  
We need to place S and E in these, plus two other letters not in {R,O,T,L}.  
Let's try S in position 2 and E in position 1:  
E S _ A _  
We need two more letters. Let's pick N and D: ""ESNAD"" – not a word.  
""ESNAP"" – not a word.  
""ESCAR"" – R invalid.  
""ESCAR"" is invalid.  
""ESSEN"" – E in 1, S in 2, S in 3, E in 4 (but E cannot be in 4, it's in 4 already).  
Wait, E is in 1, S in 2, and we need two more letters.  
""ESCAP"" – not a word.  
""ESCAR"" – R invalid.  
""ESSES"" – S twice, but we don't know if S is repeated.  
""ESSES"" is a word but has S twice.  
""ESSES"" would be E S S E S – but E cannot be in 5 (from arose feedback), and S cannot be in 4 (from arose feedback).  
But in ""ESSES"", E is in 1 and 4, and S is in 2 and 3.  
This seems possible, but let's see if there's a simpler word.

Alternative:  
S in position 3 and E in position 2:  
_ E S A _  
We need two more letters in positions 1 and 5.  
Let's try N and D: ""NESAD"" – not a word.  
""NESAS"" – not a word.  
""NESPA"" – not a word.  
""NESCA"" – not a word.  
""NESSE"" – not a word.  
""NESSE"" – E is in 5 which is invalid (E cannot be in 5).  

Alternative:  
E in position 2 and S in position 3:  
_ E S A _  
Again, need two more letters.  
""NESEA"" – not a word.  
""SEESA"" – not a word.  

Alternative:  
E in position 5 – but E cannot be in 5 (from arose feedback).  
So E must be in 1 or 2.  

Let me try a different approach:  
We have pattern _ _ _ A _  
We need to place S and E in the remaining positions.  
Possible positions for S: 2,3  
Possible positions for E: 1,2  

Let's try E in 1 and S in 2:  
E S _ A _  
We need two more letters.  
Let's pick N and D: ""ESNAD"" – not a word.  
""ESNAP"" – not a word.  
""ESCAR"" – R invalid.  
""ESCAP"" – not a word.  

Let me try E in 1 and S in 3:  
E _ S A _  
Need two more letters.  
""ENSA"" – too short.  
""ENSA_"" – need a 5th letter.  
""ENSA_"" – let's think of valid words:  
""ENSAY"" – Y is allowed, but E is in 1, N in 2, S in 3, A in 4, Y in 5.  
Check constraints:  
- E in 1: allowed (not 3 or 5)  
- S in 3: allowed (not 1 or 4)  
- A in 4: correct  
- No R, O, T, L – N and Y are allowed  
""ENSAY"" is a valid word.  

But let me check if there's a simpler word.  
Another option:  
S in 2 and E in 1:  
E S _ A _  
We need two more letters.  
""ESCAP"" – not a word.  
""ESCAR"" – R invalid.  
""ESSES"" – S twice, but possible.  
""ESSES"" is a valid word.  

Between ""ENSAY"" and ""ESSES"", ""ESSES"" seems simpler.  
Let me choose ""ESSES"" as it uses S twice which might help confirm if S is repeated.  

But wait, let me think again:  
From arose: S is in the word but not in position 4.  
From steal: S is in the word but not in position 1.  
So S could be in 2,3,5.  
From ""ESSES"": S is in 2,3,5 – but we don't know if S is repeated.  

A better word might be ""ESCAP"" – but not valid.  
""ESCAP"" is not a valid word.  
""ESCAR"" – R invalid.  
""ESSEN"" – E in 1, S in 2, S in 3, E in 4 (invalid), N in 5 – but A is in 4.  
So ""ESSEN"" is invalid.  

Another option:  
S in 3 and E in 2:  
_ E S A _  
Need two more letters.  
""NESEA"" – not a word.  
""SEESA"" – not a word.  

Let me try ""EASSE"" – but A is in 4, so ""EASSE"" would be E A S S E – but A is in 2, which is allowed, but we need A in 4.  
So ""EASSE"" is invalid.  

Let me think of valid words:  
""ESSAY"" – E S S A Y – but Y is allowed, E is in 1, S in 2, S in 3, A in 4, Y in 5.  
Check constraints:  
- A in 4: correct  
- S in 2 and 3: allowed (not 1 or 4)  
- E in 1: allowed (not 3 or 5)  
- No R, O, T, L – N and Y are not needed here, but letters used are E, S, A, Y – none of the forbidden letters.  
""ESSAY"" is a valid word.  

This seems the best option so far.  
Let me verify:  
- A is in 4 (✓)  
- S is in 2 and 3 (allowed positions)  
- E is in 1 (allowed)  
- No R, O, T, L – correct  
""ESSAY"" is a valid 5-letter word.Based on the feedback so far, we know:
- A is in position 4.
- S and E must appear somewhere in the remaining positions (1,2,3,5) while avoiding their previously excluded spots.
- Forbidden letters: R, O, T, L.

A valid word that satisfies these constraints is:",Guess 3: essay -> FEEDBACK: E(✓) S(✓) S(✓) A(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
