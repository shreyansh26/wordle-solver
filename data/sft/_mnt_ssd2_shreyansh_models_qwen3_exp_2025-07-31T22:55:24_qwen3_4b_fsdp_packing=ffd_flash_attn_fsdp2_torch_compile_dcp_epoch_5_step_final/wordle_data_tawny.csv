### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. 

Some common starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel in English)

This should give me good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
- L(x) – L is not in the word at all.
- A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3, so it must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- T(-) – T is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 4, so it must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5).
- E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- Letters definitely absent: S, L, E.
- Letters definitely present: A, T.
- Positions to test: we need to place A and T in new positions while keeping the word valid.

We also want to introduce new common letters to maximize information gain. Good next letters to test might be R, N, I, O, U, C, etc.

A good second guess would be a word that:
1. Contains both A and T in new positions.
2. Introduces new common letters (e.g., R, N, I, O).
3. Avoids S, L, E.

A candidate word is “TRAIN”:
- T is now in position 1 (new position for T).
- A is now in position 3 (new position for A).
- Introduces R, I, N (all common letters not yet tested).

Let’s check:
- T in position 1: new position for T.
- A in position 3: new position for A.
- R, I, N: new letters to test.

This seems optimal for gathering more information.

Some common starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel in English)

This should give me good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

So far we know:
- Word starts with T.
- Contains A and N somewhere, but A cannot be in position 3 and N cannot be in position 5.
- Does not contain: S, L, E, R, I.

We need a 5-letter word starting with T, containing both A and N, avoiding the banned letters, and placing A and N in new positions.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5 (cannot be 1 or 3)
Possible positions for N: 2, 3, 4 (cannot be 1 or 5)

Let’s try to construct a word:
- T _ _ _ _
- Must include A and N in allowed positions.

A simple candidate is T A N _ _ or T _ A N _ or T _ _ A N, etc.

But we need to avoid R, I, S, L, E.

Let’s try T A N G Y:
- T(✓) at position 1
- A at position 2 (new position)
- N at position 3 (new position)
- G and Y are new letters to test
- No banned letters used

This seems like a good third guess to test A in position 2 and N in position 3, while introducing G and Y.

Let's digest the latest feedback:

1. T(✓) at position 1 – confirmed.
2. A(✓) at position 2 – confirmed.
3. N(-) – N is in the word but NOT in position 3.
4. G(x) – G is NOT in the word.
5. Y(✓) at position 5 – confirmed.

So far we have:
- T A _ _ Y
- Must contain N somewhere, but not at position 3.
- Forbidden letters so far: S, L, E, R, I, G.

Possible positions for N: 3 or 4 (since 1 and 2 are taken, and 5 is Y).

Let’s test N at position 4:
- T A _ N Y

Now we need a letter for position 3. We haven’t used D, H, M, O, P, U, etc. A common letter that fits is D, making T A D N Y. But “TADNY” isn’t a valid English word.

Next, let’s try N at position 3:
- T A N _ Y

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with TAN and ends with Y. The word “TANGY” was already tried (in TANGY) and G was invalid. The next common word is “TANLY” – not valid. “TANNY” – ends with Y but has N twice, and N at position 3 is forbidden. 

Looking for valid words: “TANLY” is invalid, “TANNY” has N at position 3 (forbidden). The only valid word that fits T A _ N Y is “TANNY” but N at 3 is forbidden. 

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the word is T A _ _ Y with N somewhere else. We know N is in the word but not at 3. So N must be at 4 (since 3 is forbidden). Then the word is T A _ N Y. The missing letter must be a common consonant not yet used. The only common letter left is D, making T A D N Y – invalid. 

Looking back, maybe I missed a word. The word “TANLY” isn’t valid. The word “TANNY” is valid but N is at 3 (forbidden). 

Actually, the word “TANNY” is valid but N is at position 3, which is forbidden. So we need another approach.

Wait, let me list valid 5-letter words starting with T A _ _ Y:
- TANLY – invalid
- TANNY – valid but N at 3 is forbidden
- TAPNY – invalid
- TAWNY – valid!

“TAWNY”:
- T A W N Y
- T(✓) at 1
- A(✓) at 2
- W is new
- N at 4 (allowed, since N can’t be at 3)
- Y at 5 (✓)

This fits all constraints.

So the next guess is TAWNY.
