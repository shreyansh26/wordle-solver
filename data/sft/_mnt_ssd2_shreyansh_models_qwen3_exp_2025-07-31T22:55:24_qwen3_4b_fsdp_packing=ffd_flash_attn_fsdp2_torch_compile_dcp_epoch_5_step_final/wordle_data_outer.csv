Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I want to include as many of these as possible in my first guess.

A good first guess would be ""AROSE"" because it contains:

- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)

- E (most common letter in English)

This combination should give me good information about which of these common letters are in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, S
- Letters that ARE in the word: R, O, E
- Positions to avoid for those letters: R≠2, O≠3, E≠5

I want a new guess that:
1. Keeps R, O, E (since they’re confirmed in the word).
2. Places them in new positions to test their correct spots.
3. Adds new common letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is “REORE”:
- R at 1st position (new spot for R)
- E at 2nd position (new spot for E)
- O at 3rd position (new spot for O, but feedback said O≠3, so this would be bad)

Oops, that fails because O is not allowed at 3rd. Let’s try “ROGER”:
- R at 1st (new spot)
- O at 2nd (new spot)
- G (new letter)
- E at 4th (new spot)
- R at 5th (new spot for R)

This tests R in 1st and 5th, O in 2nd, E in 4th, and introduces G.

Another good option is “ROGER” since it tests many new positions for the known letters and adds G. Let’s go with “ROGER”.

Let’s consolidate what we now know.

Letters that are in the word (✓ or - feedback):
- R (must appear at least twice; one is in position 5, so another R must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4)
- O (must appear at least once; it is not in position 2 or 3)
- E (must appear at least once; it is in position 4)

Letters that are NOT in the word:

Positions we know:
- Position 5 = R
- Position 4 = E

So the pattern so far is: _ _ _ E R

We still need to place the second R somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3, and we still need to place the O somewhere it has not been tried (positions 1, 4, or 5 are already ruled out for O; 4 is E, 5 is R, so O must be in 1 or 3).

Let’s try to form a valid 5-letter word that fits _ _ _ E R, contains an extra R, and places O in a new spot.

Possible placements:
- If O is in position 1: O _ _ E R
  - We need an R in position 2 or 3. If R is in 2: O R _ E R → but that would give us O R _ E R, and we need a 5-letter word. The word “ORBER” isn’t valid. “ORPER” isn’t valid either.
  - If R is in 3: O _ R E R → “ORPER” again isn’t valid.

- If O is in position 3: _ _ O E R
  - We need an R in position 1 or 2.
    - R _ O E R → “ROPER” is a valid word (variant spelling of “roper”).
    - _ R O E R → “_ROER” isn’t a valid word.

So the only valid candidate seems to be “ROPER”.

Check:
- R at 1 (new spot)
- O at 3 (new spot)
- E at 4 (confirmed)
- R at 5 (confirmed)
- P is a new letter to test.

This should give us information about the remaining letters.

- E (must appear at least once; it is in position 4)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- A, S, G

Positions we know:
- Position 5 = R
- Position 4 = E

So the pattern so far is: _ _ _ E R

We still need to place the second R somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3, and we still need to place the O somewhere it has not been tried (positions 1, 4, or 5 are already ruled out for O; 4 is E, 5 is R, so O must be in 1 or 3).

Let’s try to form a valid 5-letter word that fits _ _ _ E R, contains an extra R, and places O in a new spot.

Possible placements:
- If O is in position 1: O _ _ E R
  - We need an R in position 2 or 3. If R is in 2: O R _ E R → but that would give us O R _ E R, and we need a 5-letter word. The word “ORBER” isn’t valid. “ORPER” isn’t valid either.
  - If R is in 3: O _ R E R → “ORPER” again isn’t valid.

- If O is in position 3: _ _ O E R
  - We need an R in position 1 or 2.
    - R _ O E R → “ROPER” is a valid word (variant spelling of “roper”).
    - _ R O E R → “_ROER” isn’t a valid word.

So the only valid candidate seems to be “ROPER”.

Check:
- R at 1 (new spot)
- O at 3 (new spot)
- E at 4 (confirmed)
- R at 5 (confirmed)
- P is a new letter to test.

This should give us information about the remaining letters.

From all feedback so far:

Letters that are definitely in the word:
- R (must appear at least twice, and we now know one R is in position 5 and another R is not in positions 1, 2, or 3 from roger and roper feedback)
- O (must appear at least once, but cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5)
- E (must appear at least once, and we know it is in position 4)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- A, S, G, P

Positions we know:
- Position 5 = R
- Position 4 = E

O cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5, and position 4 is E, so O must be in position 1 or 3.

We also know from roger and roper that:
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (because both guesses gave R(-) for those positions), so the only remaining spot for the second R is position 3.

Therefore:
- Position 3 = R
- Position 4 = E
- Position 5 = R

That gives us the pattern: _ _ R E R

O must be in position 1 (since position 3 is already R and position 4 is E).

So the word must be: O _ R E R

The only valid 5-letter word that fits this pattern is ""ORER"" but that's only 4 letters. Wait, let me think again.

Actually, the pattern is _ _ R E R, with O in position 1, so it would be O _ R E R. The missing letter is position 2. We haven't tested any letters in position 2 yet, and we know it must be a letter that is not A, S, G, P, R, O, or E. Common letters left include B, C, D, F, H, I, K, L, M, N, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for valid 5-letter words that fit O _ R E R:
- O B R E R → ""obrer"" is not a word.
- O C R E R → ""ocrer"" is not a word.
- O D R E R → ""odrer"" is not a word.
- O F R E R → ""ofrer"" is not a word.
- O K R E R → ""okrer"" is not a word.
- O L R E R → ""olrer"" is not a word.
- O M R E R → ""omrer"" is not a word.
- O N R E R → ""onrer"" is not a word.
- O T R E R → ""otrer"" is not a word.
- O W R E R → ""owrer"" is not a word.

Wait, this seems problematic. Let me re-examine the constraints.

From roger and roper:
- R(-) in position 1 means R is not in position 1.
- R(-) in position 2 means R is not in position 2.
- R(-) in position 3 means R is not in position 3 (but we already have R in position 5, so this is consistent).
- R(✓) in position 5 means R is in position 5.

O(-) in position 2 and position 3 means O is not in positions 2 or 3.

E(✓) in position 4 means E is in position 4.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ E R

We know:
- O must be in position 1 (since positions 2, 3, 4, 5 are ruled out for O, and position 4 is E).
- We need an extra R somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3. But position 1 is O, so R must be in position 2 or 3.
- However, from roger and roper, R cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from the (-) feedback), which leaves no place for the second R. This is a contradiction.

This suggests I made an error in interpreting the feedback. Let me re-examine the feedback:

Guess 1: arose → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: roger → R(-) O(-) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Guess 3: roper → R(-) O(-) P(x) E(✓) R(✓)

From roger:
- R(-) in position 1 means R is not in position 1.
- O(-) in position 2 means O is not in position 2.
- G(x) means G is not in the word.
- E(✓) in position 4 means E is in position 4.
- R(✓) in position 5 means R is in position 5.

From roper:
- R(-) in position 1 again (consistent).
- O(-) in position 3 means O is not in position 3.
- P(x) means P is not in the word.
- E(✓) in position 4 again (consistent).
- R(✓) in position 5 again (consistent).

So the pattern is: _ _ _ E R

Letters known to be in the word: R, O, E
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, S, G, P

Positions ruled out:
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3 (from roger and roper feedback), but we know R is in position 5, so that's fine.
- O cannot be in positions 2, 3, 5 (from roger and roper feedback), and position 4 is E, so O must be in position 1.

Therefore:
- Position 1 = O
- Position 4 = E
- Position 5 = R

We need a letter for position 2 and 3. We have not tested any letters in these positions yet, and they must be letters not yet ruled out.

Possible letters for positions 2 and 3: B, C, D, F, H, I, K, L, M, N, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for valid 5-letter words that fit O _ _ E R:
- O B B E R → ""obb er"" is not a word.
- O B L E R → ""oble r"" is not a word.
- O C K E R → ""ocker"" is a valid word.
- O C K E R: C and K are new letters to test.

This seems like a good next guess because it tests C and K in positions 2 and 3 while keeping O, E, R in their known positions.
</think>

Based on the feedback, we now know:
- The word ends in ""ER"" (positions 4 and 5 are E and R).
- O must be in position 1 (cannot be in 2, 3, or 5).
- We need two new letters for positions 2 and 3 that have not been ruled out.

A valid word fitting these constraints is ""OCKER"".

1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I want to include as many of these as possible in my first guess.

A good first guess would be ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination should give me good information about which of these common letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, S
- Letters that ARE in the word: R, O, E
- Positions to avoid for those letters: R≠2, O≠3, E≠5

I want a new guess that:
1. Keeps R, O, E (since they’re confirmed in the word).
2. Places them in new positions to test their correct spots.
3. Adds new common letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is “REORE”:
- R at 1st position (new spot for R)
- E at 2nd position (new spot for E)
- O at 3rd position (new spot for O, but feedback said O≠3, so this would be bad)

Oops, that fails because O is not allowed at 3rd. Let’s try “ROGER”:
- R at 1st (new spot)
- O at 2nd (new spot)
- G (new letter)
- E at 4th (new spot)
- R at 5th (new spot for R)

This tests R in 1st and 5th, O in 2nd, E in 4th, and introduces G.

Another good option is “ROGER” since it tests many new positions for the known letters and adds G. Let’s go with “ROGER”.

Let’s consolidate what we now know.

Letters that are in the word (✓ or - feedback):
- R (must appear at least twice; one is in position 5, so another R must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4)
- O (must appear at least once; it is not in position 2 or 3)
- E (must appear at least once; it is in position 4)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- A, S, G

Positions we know:
- Position 5 = R
- Position 4 = E

So the pattern so far is: _ _ _ E R

We still need to place the second R somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3, and we still need to place the O somewhere it has not been tried (positions 1, 4, or 5 are already ruled out for O; 4 is E, 5 is R, so O must be in 1 or 3).

Let’s try to form a valid 5-letter word that fits _ _ _ E R, contains an extra R, and places O in a new spot.

Possible placements:
- If O is in position 1: O _ _ E R
  - We need an R in position 2 or 3. If R is in 2: O R _ E R → but that would give us O R _ E R, and we need a 5-letter word. The word “ORBER” isn’t valid. “ORPER” isn’t valid either.
  - If R is in 3: O _ R E R → “ORPER” again isn’t valid.

- If O is in position 3: _ _ O E R
  - We need an R in position 1 or 2.
    - R _ O E R → “ROPER” is a valid word (variant spelling of “roper”).
    - _ R O E R → “_ROER” isn’t a valid word.

So the only valid candidate seems to be “ROPER”.

Check:
- R at 1 (new spot)
- O at 3 (new spot)
- E at 4 (confirmed)
- R at 5 (confirmed)
- P is a new letter to test.

This should give us information about the remaining letters.

Actually, the pattern is _ _ R E R, with O in position 1, so it would be O _ R E R. The missing letter is position 2. We haven't tested any letters in position 2 yet, and we know it must be a letter that is not A, S, G, P, R, O, or E. Common letters left include B, C, D, F, H, I, K, L, M, N, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for valid 5-letter words that fit O _ R E R:
- O B R E R → ""obrer"" is not a word.
- O C R E R → ""ocrer"" is not a word.
- O D R E R → ""odrer"" is not a word.
- O F R E R → ""ofrer"" is not a word.
- O K R E R → ""okrer"" is not a word.
- O L R E R → ""olrer"" is not a word.
- O M R E R → ""omrer"" is not a word.
- O N R E R → ""onrer"" is not a word.
- O T R E R → ""otrer"" is not a word.
- O W R E R → ""owrer"" is not a word.

Wait, this seems problematic. Let me re-examine the constraints.

From roger and roper:
- R(-) in position 1 means R is not in position 1.
- R(-) in position 2 means R is not in position 2.
- R(-) in position 3 means R is not in position 3 (but we already have R in position 5, so this is consistent).
- R(✓) in position 5 means R is in position 5.

O(-) in position 2 and position 3 means O is not in positions 2 or 3.

E(✓) in position 4 means E is in position 4.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ E R

We know:
- O must be in position 1 (since positions 2, 3, 4, 5 are ruled out for O, and position 4 is E).
- We need an extra R somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3. But position 1 is O, so R must be in position 2 or 3.
- However, from roger and roper, R cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from the (-) feedback), which leaves no place for the second R. This is a contradiction.

This suggests I made an error in interpreting the feedback. Let me re-examine the feedback:

Guess 1: arose → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: roger → R(-) O(-) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Guess 3: roper → R(-) O(-) P(x) E(✓) R(✓)

From roger:
- R(-) in position 1 means R is not in position 1.
- O(-) in position 2 means O is not in position 2.
- G(x) means G is not in the word.
- E(✓) in position 4 means E is in position 4.
- R(✓) in position 5 means R is in position 5.

From roper:
- R(-) in position 1 again (consistent).
- O(-) in position 3 means O is not in position 3.
- P(x) means P is not in the word.
- E(✓) in position 4 again (consistent).
- R(✓) in position 5 again (consistent).

So the pattern is: _ _ _ E R

Letters known to be in the word: R, O, E
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, S, G, P

Positions ruled out:
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3 (from roger and roper feedback), but we know R is in position 5, so that's fine.
- O cannot be in positions 2, 3, 5 (from roger and roper feedback), and position 4 is E, so O must be in position 1.

Therefore:
- Position 1 = O
- Position 4 = E
- Position 5 = R

We need a letter for position 2 and 3. We have not tested any letters in these positions yet, and they must be letters not yet ruled out.

Possible letters for positions 2 and 3: B, C, D, F, H, I, K, L, M, N, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for valid 5-letter words that fit O _ _ E R:
- O B B E R → ""obb er"" is not a word.
- O B L E R → ""oble r"" is not a word.
- O C K E R → ""ocker"" is a valid word.
- O C K E R: C and K are new letters to test.

This seems like a good next guess because it tests C and K in positions 2 and 3 while keeping O, E, R in their known positions.Based on the feedback, we now know:
- The word ends in ""ER"" (positions 4 and 5 are E and R).
- O must be in position 1 (cannot be in 2, 3, or 5).
- We need two new letters for positions 2 and 3 that have not been ruled out.

A valid word fitting these constraints is ""OCKER"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I want to include as many of these as possible in my first guess.

A good first guess would be ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination should give me good information about which of these common letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, S
- Letters that ARE in the word: R, O, E
- Positions to avoid for those letters: R≠2, O≠3, E≠5

I want a new guess that:
1. Keeps R, O, E (since they’re confirmed in the word).
2. Places them in new positions to test their correct spots.
3. Adds new common letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is “REORE”:
- R at 1st position (new spot for R)
- E at 2nd position (new spot for E)
- O at 3rd position (new spot for O, but feedback said O≠3, so this would be bad)

Oops, that fails because O is not allowed at 3rd. Let’s try “ROGER”:
- R at 1st (new spot)
- O at 2nd (new spot)
- G (new letter)
- E at 4th (new spot)
- R at 5th (new spot for R)

This tests R in 1st and 5th, O in 2nd, E in 4th, and introduces G.

Another good option is “ROGER” since it tests many new positions for the known letters and adds G. Let’s go with “ROGER”.

Let’s consolidate what we now know.

Letters that are in the word (✓ or - feedback):
- R (must appear at least twice; one is in position 5, so another R must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4)
- O (must appear at least once; it is not in position 2 or 3)
- E (must appear at least once; it is in position 4)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- A, S, G

Positions we know:
- Position 5 = R
- Position 4 = E

So the pattern so far is: _ _ _ E R

We still need to place the second R somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3, and we still need to place the O somewhere it has not been tried (positions 1, 4, or 5 are already ruled out for O; 4 is E, 5 is R, so O must be in 1 or 3).

Let’s try to form a valid 5-letter word that fits _ _ _ E R, contains an extra R, and places O in a new spot.

Possible placements:
- If O is in position 1: O _ _ E R
  - We need an R in position 2 or 3. If R is in 2: O R _ E R → but that would give us O R _ E R, and we need a 5-letter word. The word “ORBER” isn’t valid. “ORPER” isn’t valid either.
  - If R is in 3: O _ R E R → “ORPER” again isn’t valid.

- If O is in position 3: _ _ O E R
  - We need an R in position 1 or 2.
    - R _ O E R → “ROPER” is a valid word (variant spelling of “roper”).
    - _ R O E R → “_ROER” isn’t a valid word.

So the only valid candidate seems to be “ROPER”.

Check:
- R at 1 (new spot)
- O at 3 (new spot)
- E at 4 (confirmed)
- R at 5 (confirmed)
- P is a new letter to test.

This should give us information about the remaining letters.

O cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5, and position 4 is E, so O must be in position 1 or 3.

We also know from roger and roper that:
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (because both guesses gave R(-) for those positions), so the only remaining spot for the second R is position 3.

Therefore:
- Position 3 = R
- Position 4 = E
- Position 5 = R

That gives us the pattern: _ _ R E R

O must be in position 1 (since position 3 is already R and position 4 is E).

So the word must be: O _ R E R

The only valid 5-letter word that fits this pattern is ""ORER"" but that's only 4 letters. Wait, let me think again.

Actually, the pattern is _ _ R E R, with O in position 1, so it would be O _ R E R. The missing letter is position 2. We haven't tested any letters in position 2 yet, and we know it must be a letter that is not A, S, G, P, R, O, or E. Common letters left include B, C, D, F, H, I, K, L, M, N, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for valid 5-letter words that fit O _ R E R:
- O B R E R → ""obrer"" is not a word.
- O C R E R → ""ocrer"" is not a word.
- O D R E R → ""odrer"" is not a word.
- O F R E R → ""ofrer"" is not a word.
- O K R E R → ""okrer"" is not a word.
- O L R E R → ""olrer"" is not a word.
- O M R E R → ""omrer"" is not a word.
- O N R E R → ""onrer"" is not a word.
- O T R E R → ""otrer"" is not a word.
- O W R E R → ""owrer"" is not a word.

Wait, this seems problematic. Let me re-examine the constraints.

From roger and roper:
- R(-) in position 1 means R is not in position 1.
- R(-) in position 2 means R is not in position 2.
- R(-) in position 3 means R is not in position 3 (but we already have R in position 5, so this is consistent).
- R(✓) in position 5 means R is in position 5.

O(-) in position 2 and position 3 means O is not in positions 2 or 3.

E(✓) in position 4 means E is in position 4.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ E R

We know:
- O must be in position 1 (since positions 2, 3, 4, 5 are ruled out for O, and position 4 is E).
- We need an extra R somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3. But position 1 is O, so R must be in position 2 or 3.
- However, from roger and roper, R cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from the (-) feedback), which leaves no place for the second R. This is a contradiction.

This suggests I made an error in interpreting the feedback. Let me re-examine the feedback:

Guess 1: arose → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: roger → R(-) O(-) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Guess 3: roper → R(-) O(-) P(x) E(✓) R(✓)

From roger:
- R(-) in position 1 means R is not in position 1.
- O(-) in position 2 means O is not in position 2.
- G(x) means G is not in the word.
- E(✓) in position 4 means E is in position 4.
- R(✓) in position 5 means R is in position 5.

From roper:
- R(-) in position 1 again (consistent).
- O(-) in position 3 means O is not in position 3.
- P(x) means P is not in the word.
- E(✓) in position 4 again (consistent).
- R(✓) in position 5 again (consistent).

So the pattern is: _ _ _ E R

Letters known to be in the word: R, O, E
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, S, G, P

Positions ruled out:
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3 (from roger and roper feedback), but we know R is in position 5, so that's fine.
- O cannot be in positions 2, 3, 5 (from roger and roper feedback), and position 4 is E, so O must be in position 1.

Therefore:
- Position 1 = O
- Position 4 = E
- Position 5 = R

We need a letter for position 2 and 3. We have not tested any letters in these positions yet, and they must be letters not yet ruled out.

Possible letters for positions 2 and 3: B, C, D, F, H, I, K, L, M, N, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for valid 5-letter words that fit O _ _ E R:
- O B B E R → ""obb er"" is not a word.
- O B L E R → ""oble r"" is not a word.
- O C K E R → ""ocker"" is a valid word.
- O C K E R: C and K are new letters to test.

This seems like a good next guess because it tests C and K in positions 2 and 3 while keeping O, E, R in their known positions.Based on the feedback, we now know:
- The word ends in ""ER"" (positions 4 and 5 are E and R).
- O must be in position 1 (cannot be in 2, 3, or 5).
- We need two new letters for positions 2 and 3 that have not been ruled out.

A valid word fitting these constraints is ""OCKER"".

From the latest feedback on ""OCKER"":

- O(✓) at position 1 → O is correct and in the right spot.
- C(x) at position 2 → C is not in the word.
- K(x) at position 3 → K is not in the word.
- E(✓) at position 4 → E is correct and in the right spot.
- R(✓) at position 5 → R is correct and in the right spot.

So the word pattern is now fully determined:

O _ _ E R

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with O, ends with ER, and has a second letter that has not been ruled out. The letters ruled out so far are: A, S, G, P, C, K.

The only remaining common consonants for position 2 are B, D, F, H, L, M, N, T, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking at common English words that fit O _ _ E R:

- OBBER (but B is allowed, and ""obber"" is a variant spelling of ""obb"" meaning to knock)
- OBBER (not a standard word)
- ODDER (not a word)
- OFTER (valid word)
- OWDER (valid word)
- ONDER (not a word)
- OXFER (not a word)
- OYSTER (but that's 6 letters)
- OZTER (not a word)

The most common and valid words are ""OFTER"" and ""OWDER"".

""OFTER"" is a common word meaning ""more often"".
""OWDER"" is less common but still valid.

Between these, ""OFTER"" is more likely to be the secret word given the constraints. Let's try ""OFTER"".

- E(✓) at position 4 → E is correct and in the right spot.
- N(x) at position 5 → N is not in the word.

So the word pattern is now fully determined:

O T _ E R

We need a 5-letter word that starts with OT, ends with ER, and has a single letter in position 3 that has not been ruled out. The letters ruled out so far include: A, S, G, P, C, K, F, N.

Common consonants left for position 3: B, D, H, L, M, R, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking at valid English words that fit OT _ E R:

- OTTER (T in position 3 is already correct, but we need a letter in position 3)
- OTTER is the only common word that fits OT _ E R with T in position 3, but position 3 is already T.

Wait, the pattern is O T _ E R, so position 3 must be a single letter. The only common word that fits is ""OTTER"", but that would be O T T E R, which has T in position 3 and 4. However, we have E in position 4, so the word must be O T _ E R.

The only valid 5-letter word that fits OT _ E R is ""OTTER"", but that would require position 3 to be T, which is already in position 4. This seems conflicting.

Rechecking the pattern: O(✓) T(✓) _ (unknown) E(✓) R(✓). So positions 1,3,4,5 are fixed as O, _, E, R. Position 2 is T from the feedback.

Wait, the feedback for ""often"" shows:

O(✓) F(x) T(✓) E(✓) N(x)

This means:
- Position 1: O is correct (✓)
- Position 2: F is not in the word (x)
- Position 3: T is correct (✓)
- Position 4: E is correct (✓)
- Position 5: N is not in the word (x)

So the pattern is O _ T E R, not O T _ E R. I misread the positions earlier.

Therefore, the word pattern is:

O _ T E R

We need a 5-letter word that starts with O, has T in position 3, E in position 4, and R in position 5. The only common word that fits is ""OTTER"", but that would be O T T E R, which has T in position 2 and 3. However, our pattern is O _ T E R, so position 2 must be a different letter.

Looking for words that fit O _ T E R:

- O B T E R (not a word)
- O D T E R (not a word)
- O H T E R (not a word)
- O L T E R (not a word)
- O M T E R (not a word)
- O P T E R (P is ruled out)
- O V T E R (not a word)
- O W T E R (not a word)

The only valid word that fits is ""OTTER"", but that would require position 2 to be T, which conflicts with our pattern. This suggests I must have made an error in interpreting the feedback.

Re-examining the feedback for ""often"":

Guess 5: often -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) F(x) T(✓) E(✓) N(x)

This means:
- Position 1: O is correct (✓)
- Position 2: F is not in the word (x)
- Position 3: T is correct (✓)
- Position 4: E is correct (✓)
- Position 5: N is not in the word (x)

So the pattern is O _ T E R, with position 3 being T. The only valid word that fits this pattern is ""OTTER"", but that would have T in position 2 and 3, which conflicts with the pattern. This indicates there is no common word that fits, but ""OTTER"" is the only possibility.

However, ""OTTER"" is O T T E R, which would mean positions 1:O, 2:T, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R. But according to the feedback, position 3 is T (✓), so this is possible.

The pattern is O _ T E R, so position 2 is unknown, but in ""OTTER"" it's T. Since T has not been ruled out for position 2, this must be the word.

Therefore, the correct word is ""OTTER"".

The only valid 5-letter word that fits OT _ E R is ""OTTER"", but that would require position 3 to be T, which is already in position 4. This seems conflicting.

Rechecking the pattern: O(✓) T(✓) _ (unknown) E(✓) R(✓). So positions 1,3,4,5 are fixed as O, _, E, R. Position 2 is T from the feedback.

Wait, the feedback for ""often"" shows:

O(✓) F(x) T(✓) E(✓) N(x)

This means:
- Position 1: O is correct (✓)
- Position 2: F is not in the word (x)
- Position 3: T is correct (✓)
- Position 4: E is correct (✓)
- Position 5: N is not in the word (x)

So the pattern is O _ T E R, not O T _ E R. I misread the positions earlier.

Therefore, the word pattern is:

O _ T E R

We need a 5-letter word that starts with O, has T in position 3, E in position 4, and R in position 5. The only common word that fits is ""OTTER"", but that would be O T T E R, which has T in position 2 and 3. However, our pattern is O _ T E R, so position 2 must be a different letter.

Looking for words that fit O _ T E R:

- O B T E R (not a word)
- O D T E R (not a word)
- O H T E R (not a word)
- O L T E R (not a word)
- O M T E R (not a word)
- O P T E R (P is ruled out)
- O V T E R (not a word)
- O W T E R (not a word)

The only valid word that fits is ""OTTER"", but that would require position 2 to be T, which conflicts with our pattern. This suggests I must have made an error in interpreting the feedback.

Re-examining the feedback for ""often"":

Guess 5: often -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) F(x) T(✓) E(✓) N(x)

This means:
- Position 1: O is correct (✓)
- Position 2: F is not in the word (x)
- Position 3: T is correct (✓)
- Position 4: E is correct (✓)
- Position 5: N is not in the word (x)

So the pattern is O _ T E R, with position 3 being T. The only valid word that fits this pattern is ""OTTER"", but that would have T in position 2 and 3, which conflicts with the pattern. This indicates there is no common word that fits, but ""OTTER"" is the only possibility.

However, ""OTTER"" is O T T E R, which would mean positions 1:O, 2:T, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R. But according to the feedback, position 3 is T (✓), so this is possible.

The pattern is O _ T E R, so position 2 is unknown, but in ""OTTER"" it's T. Since T has not been ruled out for position 2, this must be the word.

Therefore, the correct word is ""OTTER"".Based on the feedback, the pattern is O _ T E R. The only valid 5-letter word that fits this pattern is:",Guess 6: otter -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) T(-) T(✓) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL
