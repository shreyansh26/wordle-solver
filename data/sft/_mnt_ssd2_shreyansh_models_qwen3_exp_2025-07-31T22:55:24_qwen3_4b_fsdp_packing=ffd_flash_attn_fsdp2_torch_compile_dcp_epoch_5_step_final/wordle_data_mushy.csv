### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess should have a mix of these letters to quickly identify which letters are present or absent.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions. The letters S, A, E, L, T are all quite frequent in English words, so this should help narrow down the possibilities efficiently.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess should have a mix of these letters to quickly identify which letters are present or absent.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions. The letters S, A, E, L, T are all quite frequent in English words, so this should help narrow down the possibilities efficiently.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: present but wrong position (-)
- L, A, T, E: all absent (x)

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E
- DOES contain S, but not in the first position

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has S somewhere other than the first letter
2. Does not contain L, A, T, E
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, H, D, M, P, B, G, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out)

A strong candidate is ""SHIRK"":
- S is in position 2 (not first)
- H, I, R, K are all common letters not yet ruled out
- Uses two vowels (I) and three consonants (H, R, K)
- No L, A, T, E

From the latest feedback on SHUMY:

- S(-)  → S is in the word but NOT in position 1
- H(-) → H is in the word but NOT in position 2
- U(-) → U is in the word but NOT in position 3
- M(-) → M is in the word but NOT in position 4
- Y(✓) → Y is in the word and is in position 5

So the secret word:
- Ends with Y
- Contains S, H, U, M somewhere in positions 1-4, but none of them in the positions just ruled out
- Does NOT contain any of the eliminated letters (L, A, T, E, I, R, K, O, W, N, P)

Remaining allowed letters: D, C, F, G, V

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has Y as the last letter
- Uses S, H, U, M exactly once each (no repeats)
- Places S not in position 1, H not in position 2, U not in position 3, M not in position 4
- Uses only allowed letters

Possible permutations of S, H, U, M in positions 1-4, respecting the positional bans, and adding one of D, C, F, G, V.

Let’s list valid permutations:

1. S cannot be in pos 1
2. H cannot be in pos 2
3. U cannot be in pos 3
4. M cannot be in pos 4

We need to place S, H, U, M in positions 1-4 with these restrictions.

Possible valid permutations:
- H _ _ _  (H in pos 1)
- _ S _ _  (S in pos 2)
- _ _ S _  (S in pos 3)
- _ _ _ S  (S in pos 4)  → but S cannot be in pos 1, so pos 4 is allowed

But we must also respect the other bans:
- H cannot be in pos 2
- U cannot be in pos 3
- M cannot be in pos 4

Let’s try:
- H _ _ _  (H in pos 1)
  - Remaining letters: S, U, M
  - S cannot be in pos 2
  - U cannot be in pos 3
  - M cannot be in pos 4
  - Possible: H U S M  → but U in pos 2 is allowed, S in pos 3 is allowed, M in pos 4 is banned
  - H S U M  → S in pos 2 is banned
  - H U M S  → U in pos 2 allowed, M in pos 3 allowed, S in pos 4 allowed
  - H M U S  → M in pos 2 allowed, U in pos 3 banned
  - H S M U  → S in pos 2 banned
  - H M S U  → M in pos 2 allowed, S in pos 3 allowed, U in pos 4 allowed
  - So valid: H U M S, H M S U

- _ H _ _  (H in pos 2)  → but H cannot be in pos 2 → invalid
- _ _ H _  (H in pos 3)
  - S cannot be in pos 1
  - U cannot be in pos 3 (already H here)
  - M cannot be in pos 4
  - Possible: S U H M → but S in pos 1 is banned
  - U S H M → S in pos 2 allowed, H in pos 3 allowed, M in pos 4 banned
  - S M H U → S in pos 1 banned
  - M S H U → S in pos 2 allowed, H in pos 3 allowed, U in pos 4 allowed
  - U M H S → U in pos 1 allowed, M in pos 2 allowed, H in pos 3 allowed, S in pos 4 allowed
  - So valid: M S H U, U M H S

- _ _ _ H  (H in pos 4)  → but H cannot be in pos 2, but pos 4 is allowed
  - Remaining letters: S, U, M
  - S cannot be in pos 1
  - U cannot be in pos 3
  - M cannot be in pos 4 (already H here)
  - Possible: S U M H → S in pos 1 banned
  - S M U H → S in pos 1 banned
  - U S M H → S in pos 2 allowed, M in pos 3 allowed, H in pos 4 allowed
  - U M S H → M in pos 2 allowed, S in pos 3 allowed, H in pos 4 allowed
  - M S U H → S in pos 2 allowed, U in pos 3 banned
  - M U S H → U in pos 2 allowed, S in pos 3 allowed, H in pos 4 allowed
  - So valid: U S M H, U M S H, M U S H

Now, for each valid permutation, we need to add one of D, C, F, G, V in the remaining position. However, we already have 4 letters (S, H, U, M) and need a 5-letter word, so we must have one more letter. Wait, the word must be 5 letters total, and we know it ends with Y. So the first four positions must be exactly S, H, U, M in some order, and the fifth is Y.

But we have only 4 letters (S, H, U, M) to place in positions 1-4, each exactly once. So the word is _ _ _ _ Y, with the first four letters being a permutation of S, H, U, M that satisfies the positional bans.

From the permutations above, the valid ones are:

1. H U M S Y  → but this would be 5 letters, but we already have S, H, U, M plus Y. Wait, the word must be 5 letters, so positions 1-4 are S, H, U, M in some order, position 5 is Y.

So the valid permutations are:

- H U M S Y  → H U M S Y
- H M S U Y
- M S H U Y
- U M H S Y
- U S M H Y
- M U S H Y

Now check which of these are valid English words:

- HUMSY – not a word
- HMUSY – not a word
- MS H U Y – not a word
- UMHSY – not a word
- USM HY – not a word
- MUSHY – yes, this is a valid word

MUSHY:
- Letters: M, U, S, H, Y
- Ends with Y
- Contains S, H, U, M
- Positions:
  - M in pos 1 (allowed)
  - U in pos 2 (allowed)
  - S in pos 3 (allowed)
  - H in pos 4 (allowed)
  - Y in pos 5 (matches feedback)

All constraints satisfied.
