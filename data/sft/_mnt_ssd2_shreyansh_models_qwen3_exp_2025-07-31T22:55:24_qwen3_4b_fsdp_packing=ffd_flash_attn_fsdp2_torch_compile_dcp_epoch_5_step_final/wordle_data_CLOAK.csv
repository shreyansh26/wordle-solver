For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

Let's digest the new feedback on COBIA:

C(✓) → C is correct and in position 1.
O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 2.
B(x) → B is not in the word.
I(x) → I is not in the word.
A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 5.

From the two guesses we now know:
- The word starts with C.
- The word has an O somewhere, but not in position 2 or 3 (since it was marked “-” in both COBIA and AROSE).
- The word has an A somewhere, but not in positions 1 or 5.
- The word does NOT contain R, S, E, B, or I.

So far the word looks like: C _ _ _ _ with O and A somewhere in positions 2,3,4,5 (but O can't be 2 or 3, and A can't be 1 or 5).

Possible positions for O: 4 or 5.
Possible positions for A: 2 or 3 or 4 (but not 5).

Let’s try a word that:
- Starts with C.
- Has O in position 4.
- Has A in position 2.
- Uses only letters we haven’t ruled out yet.

A candidate is “CAPOD” (but D isn’t ruled out, and we’d like to test common letters). Another is “CADO” but it’s 4 letters. Wait, let’s think of real 5-letter words.

How about “CABOT”?
- C is correct in position 1.
- A is in position 2 (allowed, not ruled out).
- B is not in the word (already ruled out).
- O is in position 4 (allowed, since O was only “-” in position 2 and 3).
- T is new.

But B is already ruled out (from COBIA), so CABOT is invalid.

Next candidate: “CAGOT” – but G and T are new, and A is in position 2, O in position 4.

“CAGOT” seems valid, but let me think of a more common word.

“CABAL” – but B is ruled out.

“CABOT” – B ruled out.

“CAMPO” – P and M are new, but O in position 4 and A in position 2.

“CAMPO” seems good: C A M P O.

Let’s check:
- C in position 1: ✓
- A in position 2: allowed (not 1 or 5).
- M, P, O: new letters to test.
- O in position 4: allowed (not 2 or 3).
- No B, I, R, S, E.

This seems like a strong next guess.

Let’s summarize the current constraints:

1. First letter is C (from COBIA and CAMPO).
2. The word contains:
   - O (but not in positions 2, 3, or 4 — because O was “-” in those positions).
   - A (but not in positions 1, 2, or 5 — because A was “-” in those positions).
3. Letters already ruled out: R, S, E, B, I, M, P.

So far the pattern is: C _ _ _ _ with O and A placed somewhere.

The remaining possible positions:
- O must be in position 5 (only spot left).
- A must be in position 3 (only spot left among 2,3,4,5 that hasn’t been ruled out for A).

Thus the word must be: C _ A _ O.

Now we need two more letters for positions 2 and 4, using only letters not yet ruled out. The remaining unused common letters include D, F, G, H, K, L, N, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A common word fitting C _ A _ O is “CADDO” (but D is repeated and less common), “CHATO” (but H is allowed and T is allowed). Another is “CABDO” but B is ruled out. “CAGDO” is not a word. “CADO” is 4 letters.

The most common valid 5-letter word that fits C _ A _ O is “CHATO” (but H and T are both allowed). However, “CHATO” is less common.

Another candidate: “CADO” is 4 letters. “CABDO” invalid. “CAGDO” invalid. “CAMDO” invalid (M ruled out). “CANDO” is valid and uses N and D, both allowed.

“CANDO”:
- C ✓
- A in position 3 (allowed)
- N and D are new letters
- O in position 5 (allowed)
- No ruled-out letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So far we know:
- The word has an O in the 3rd position.
- The word contains A, but not in position 1.
- The word does not contain R, S, or E.

Next, I need a word that:
1. Has O in the 3rd spot.
2. Contains A somewhere else (positions 2, 4, or 5).
3. Avoids R, S, E.

A good candidate is ""COBIA"":
- C, B, I are new letters to test.
- O is in position 3 (matches).
- A is in position 5 (not position 1, so acceptable).
- No R, S, or E.

This should give us more information about the remaining letters.

<|im_end|>

Let's digest the new feedback on COBIA:

C(✓) → C is correct and in position 1.
O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 2.
B(x) → B is not in the word.
I(x) → I is not in the word.
A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 5.

From the two guesses we now know:
- The word starts with C.
- The word has an O somewhere, but not in position 2 or 3 (since it was marked “-” in both COBIA and AROSE).
- The word has an A somewhere, but not in positions 1 or 5.
- The word does NOT contain R, S, E, B, or I.

So far the word looks like: C _ _ _ _ with O and A somewhere in positions 2,3,4,5 (but O can't be 2 or 3, and A can't be 1 or 5).

Possible positions for O: 4 or 5.
Possible positions for A: 2 or 3 or 4 (but not 5).

Let’s try a word that:
- Starts with C.
- Has O in position 4.
- Has A in position 2.
- Uses only letters we haven’t ruled out yet.

A candidate is “CAPOD” (but D isn’t ruled out, and we’d like to test common letters). Another is “CADO” but it’s 4 letters. Wait, let’s think of real 5-letter words.

How about “CABOT”?
- C is correct in position 1.
- A is in position 2 (allowed, not ruled out).
- B is not in the word (already ruled out).
- O is in position 4 (allowed, since O was only “-” in position 2 and 3).
- T is new.

But B is already ruled out (from COBIA), so CABOT is invalid.

Next candidate: “CAGOT” – but G and T are new, and A is in position 2, O in position 4.

“CAGOT” seems valid, but let me think of a more common word.

“CABAL” – but B is ruled out.

“CABOT” – B ruled out.

“CAMPO” – P and M are new, but O in position 4 and A in position 2.

“CAMPO” seems good: C A M P O.

Let’s check:
- C in position 1: ✓
- A in position 2: allowed (not 1 or 5).
- M, P, O: new letters to test.
- O in position 4: allowed (not 2 or 3).
- No B, I, R, S, E.

This seems like a strong next guess.

From the feedback so far:

1. First letter is C (✓ in every guess).
2. Letters in the word: O and A.
3. Positions ruled out:
   - O cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (because it was “-” in those positions in previous guesses).  
     This leaves no place for O, which is impossible unless we misread.

Wait—let me re-examine the feedback carefully.

Guess 1: AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)  
   – O is correct in position 3.

Guess 2: COBIA → C(✓) O(-) B(x) I(x) A(-)  
   – O is in the word but wrong position (not 2).

Guess 3: CAMPO → C(✓) A(-) M(x) P(x) O(-)  
   – O is in the word but wrong position (not 5).

Guess 4: CANDO → C(✓) A(-) N(x) D(x) O(-)  
   – O is in the word but wrong position (not 4).

So O is definitely in position 3 (from Guess 1), and every other guess has marked O as “-” in positions 2, 4, 5. This is consistent with O being in position 3.

Similarly for A:
- Guess 1: A(-) → A is in the word but not position 1.
- Guess 2: A(-) → A is in the word but not position 5.
- Guess 3: A(-) → A is in the word but not position 2.
- Guess 4: A(-) → A is in the word but not position 3 (but we already know position 3 is O, so this is consistent).

Therefore A must be in position 4.

So the word is: C _ O A _.

Letters ruled out so far: R, S, E, B, I, M, P, N, D.

Remaining possible letters for positions 2 and 5: common consonants like F, G, H, K, L, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for 5-letter words of the form C _ O A _:

- CHOLA – but H and L are allowed, but O is in position 3, A in 4, so CHOLA is C H O A L → fits C _ O A _.
- COGAL – not a common word.
- CROAK – R is ruled out.

   – O is in the word but wrong position (not 5).

Guess 4: CANDO → C(✓) A(-) N(x) D(x) O(-)  
   – O is in the word but wrong position (not 4).

So O is definitely in position 3 (from Guess 1), and every other guess has marked O as “-” in positions 2, 4, 5. This is consistent with O being in position 3.

Similarly for A:
- Guess 1: A(-) → A is in the word but not position 1.
- Guess 2: A(-) → A is in the word but not position 5.
- Guess 3: A(-) → A is in the word but not position 2.
- Guess 4: A(-) → A is in the word but not position 3 (but we already know position 3 is O, so this is consistent).

Therefore A must be in position 4.

So the word is: C _ O A _.

Letters ruled out so far: R, S, E, B, I, M, P, N, D.

Remaining possible letters for positions 2 and 5: common consonants like F, G, H, K, L, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for 5-letter words of the form C _ O A _:

- CHOLA – but H and L are allowed, but O is in position 3, A in 4, so CHOLA is C H O A L → fits C _ O A _.
- COGAL – not a common word.
- CROAK – R is ruled out.
- CLOAK – L and K are allowed, fits C L O A K.

“CLOAK” seems the most common word fitting C _ O A _ with allowed letters.",Guess 5: CLOAK -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) L(✓) O(✓) A(✓) K(✓),SUCCESS
