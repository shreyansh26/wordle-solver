1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use several of these without repeating letters.

Some excellent starting words include:
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (contains C, R, I, S, P)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it uses 5 very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and covers a good range of vowels and consonants.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) were marked ""x"", meaning none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That tells us we can eliminate every word that contains any of those five letters.

Now we need a fresh set of common letters that avoid S, L, A, T, E.  
Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F, K, V, W, Y, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U.

A good next guess should use several of these new common letters.  
One strong candidate is ""CRONY"" — it uses C, R, O, N, Y, all of which haven’t been ruled out yet.  
Another could be ""ROUND"" or ""CHIMP"", but ""CRONY"" gives us a nice mix of vowels and consonants while avoiding the eliminated letters.

We have two pieces of feedback so far:

   Confirms R is in the word and in the correct 2nd position.  
   Eliminates C, O, N, Y.

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern: _ R _ _ _  
- Letters already ruled out: S, L, A, T, E, C, O, N, Y

Remaining common letters (avoiding the eliminated set) include:
Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  
Vowels: I, U  

We want a word that:
- Has R in the 2nd position.  
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.  
- Uses common remaining letters to maximize information.

Candidate words:
- BRISK → uses B, R, I, S, K → but S is eliminated.  
- GRIND → uses G, R, I, N, D → N is eliminated.  
- PRICK → uses P, R, I, C, K → C is eliminated.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use several of these without repeating letters.

Some excellent starting words include:
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (contains C, R, I, S, P)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it uses 5 very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and covers a good range of vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) were marked ""x"", meaning none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That tells us we can eliminate every word that contains any of those five letters.

Now we need a fresh set of common letters that avoid S, L, A, T, E.  
Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F, K, V, W, Y, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U.

A good next guess should use several of these new common letters.  
One strong candidate is ""CRONY"" — it uses C, R, O, N, Y, all of which haven’t been ruled out yet.  
Another could be ""ROUND"" or ""CHIMP"", but ""CRONY"" gives us a nice mix of vowels and consonants while avoiding the eliminated letters.

I’ll go with CRONY.

We have two pieces of feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)  
   Eliminates S, L, A, T, E.

2. CRONY → C(x) R(✓) O(x) N(x) Y(x)  
   Confirms R is in the word and in the correct 2nd position.  
   Eliminates C, O, N, Y.

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern: _ R _ _ _  
- Letters already ruled out: S, L, A, T, E, C, O, N, Y

Remaining common letters (avoiding the eliminated set) include:
Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  
Vowels: I, U  

We want a word that:
- Has R in the 2nd position.  
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.  
- Uses common remaining letters to maximize information.

Candidate words:
- BRISK → uses B, R, I, S, K → but S is eliminated.  
- GRIND → uses G, R, I, N, D → N is eliminated.  
- PRICK → uses P, R, I, C, K → C is eliminated.  
- DRIFT → uses D, R, I, F, T → T is eliminated.  
- FRUIT → uses F, R, U, I, T → T is eliminated.  
- BRUISE → too long.  
- GRUFT → not a common word.  
- DRUID → uses D, R, U, I, D → all allowed letters.  
- PRUIN → uses P, R, U, I, N → N is eliminated.  
- BRUIN → uses B, R, U, I, N → N is eliminated.  

Best remaining common word: DRUID  
Letters: D, R, U, I, D  
All letters are allowed (D, R, U, I have not been ruled out).  
It tests D (twice), U, I, and keeps R in the correct position.

Another good candidate is GRIND but N is eliminated.  
DRUID seems optimal.

I’ll go with DRUID.

Consonants: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

- 3rd letter: U (fixed)

- Eliminated letters so far: S, L, A, T, E, C, O, N, Y, D, I, M, P

We need a 5-letter word that starts with GRU and uses only letters not yet eliminated.  
Remaining common consonants: B, F, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z  
Remaining vowels: none left (A, E, I, O ruled out)

Possible endings:
- GRUBS – S eliminated  
- GRUNT – N eliminated  
- GRUMP – already tried  
- GRUFF – F allowed, but double F may not be optimal  
- GRUFT – not a common word  
- GRUIN – I eliminated  
- GRUSH – S eliminated  
- GRUFT – not common  
- GRUIN – I eliminated  
- GRUFT – not common  
- GRUIN – I eliminated  

The only common word left is GRUFF.  
Letters: G, R, U, F, F  
F has not been eliminated, and this is a valid word.

Another candidate: GRUFT is invalid.  
GRUBS, GRUNT, GRUMP, GRUSH all have eliminated letters.  
Thus, GRUFF is the only remaining common word.

I’ll guess GRUFF.
