So far we know:
- The word is _ L A _ E (positions 2, 3, 5 are fixed)
- Letters not in the word: S, T
- We still need to determine letters for positions 1 and 4.

Good candidates for position 1 (first letter) should be common consonants that are not S or T. Possible letters: R, N, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good candidates for position 4 (fourth letter) should be common consonants or vowels not yet tested. Possible letters: R, N, D, C, M, P, etc.

4. Still need to determine:

   - Position 4: any letter except S, T, F, M, and also not the same as position 1 (no repeats unless the word has duplicate letters, which is possible but unlikely)

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Pattern so far: _ L A _ E  
   (positions 2, 3, 5 are locked in)

2. Letters that are NOT in the word: S, T, F, M  
   (because they all got “x” feedback)

3. Letters that ARE in the word and in the correct spots: L, A, E  
   (already confirmed)

4. Still need to determine:  
   - Position 1: any letter except S, T, F, M  
   - Position 4: any letter except S, T, F, M, and also not the same as position 1 (no repeats unless the word has duplicate letters, which is possible but unlikely)

5. Common 5-letter words that fit _ L A _ E and avoid S, T, F, M:

   - BLADE (B, L, A, D, E) – B and D are new, valid  
   - CLADE (C, L, A, D, E) – C and D are new  
   - GLADE (G, L, A, D, E) – G and D are new  
   - PLATE (P, L, A, T, E) – T already ruled out  
   - GRADE (G, R, A, D, E) – G, R, D are new  
   - GRADE is actually _ L A _ E? No – GRADE is G R A D E, which would fit _ L A _ E only if R was in position 2, but L is already fixed in position 2. So GRADE is invalid here.

   Valid options left: BLADE, CLADE, GLADE

6. Among these, BLADE uses B and D – both common letters not yet tested.  
   CLADE uses C and D – C is slightly less common but still fine.  
   GLADE uses G and D – G is a bit less common.

   BLADE seems the most straightforward choice as it introduces B and D, both of which are very common letters.

Therefore, the next logical guess is BLADE.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common starting words often include letters like A, E, T, R, O, L, N, S, I, etc. 

A good first guess should:
1. Use common letters that appear frequently in English words
2. Avoid repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible
3. Include vowels to help identify vowel positions

Popular first guesses include words like:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - but this has less common letters
- ROAST (R, O, A, S, T)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it contains very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and tests 5 unique letters, giving good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- L(✓) – L is in the word and in the correct (second) position.
- A(✓) – A is in the word and in the correct (third) position.
- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in the correct (fifth) position.

So far we know:
- The word is _ L A _ E (positions 2, 3, 5 are fixed)
- Letters not in the word: S, T
- We still need to determine letters for positions 1 and 4.

Good candidates for position 1 (first letter) should be common consonants that are not S or T. Possible letters: R, N, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good candidates for position 4 (fourth letter) should be common consonants or vowels not yet tested. Possible letters: R, N, D, C, M, P, etc.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit the pattern _ L A _ E:
- FLAME – F is new, M is new
- GLADE – G is new, D is new
- CLAVE – C is new, V is new
- BLAME – B is new, M is new
- PLATE – P is new, T is already ruled out
- GRADE – G is new, D is new

Among these, FLAME, GLADE, CLAVE, BLAME, GRADE are all valid. I'll choose FLAME as it introduces F and M, both of which are fairly common letters not yet tested.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common starting words often include letters like A, E, T, R, O, L, N, S, I, etc. 

A good first guess should:
1. Use common letters that appear frequently in English words
2. Avoid repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible
3. Include vowels to help identify vowel positions

Popular first guesses include words like:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - but this has less common letters
- ROAST (R, O, A, S, T)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it contains very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and tests 5 unique letters, giving good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- L(✓) – L is in the word and in the correct (second) position.
- A(✓) – A is in the word and in the correct (third) position.
- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in the correct (fifth) position.

So far we know:
- The word is _ L A _ E (positions 2, 3, 5 are fixed)
- Letters not in the word: S, T
- We still need to determine letters for positions 1 and 4.

Good candidates for position 1 (first letter) should be common consonants that are not S or T. Possible letters: R, N, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good candidates for position 4 (fourth letter) should be common consonants or vowels not yet tested. Possible letters: R, N, D, C, M, P, etc.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit the pattern _ L A _ E:
- FLAME – F is new, M is new
- GLADE – G is new, D is new
- CLAVE – C is new, V is new
- BLAME – B is new, M is new
- PLATE – P is new, T is already ruled out
- GRADE – G is new, D is new

Among these, FLAME, GLADE, CLAVE, BLAME, GRADE are all valid. I'll choose FLAME as it introduces F and M, both of which are fairly common letters not yet tested.

Guess 2: FLAME -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(✓) A(✓) M(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Pattern so far: _ L A _ E  
   (positions 2, 3, 5 are locked in)

2. Letters that are NOT in the word: S, T, F, M  
   (because they all got “x” feedback)

3. Letters that ARE in the word and in the correct spots: L, A, E  
   (already confirmed)

4. Still need to determine:  
   - Position 1: any letter except S, T, F, M  
   - Position 4: any letter except S, T, F, M, and also not the same as position 1 (no repeats unless the word has duplicate letters, which is possible but unlikely)

5. Common 5-letter words that fit _ L A _ E and avoid S, T, F, M:

   - BLADE (B, L, A, D, E) – B and D are new, valid  
   - CLADE (C, L, A, D, E) – C and D are new  
   - GLADE (G, L, A, D, E) – G and D are new  
   - PLATE (P, L, A, T, E) – T already ruled out  
   - GRADE (G, R, A, D, E) – G, R, D are new  
   - GRADE is actually _ L A _ E? No – GRADE is G R A D E, which would fit _ L A _ E only if R was in position 2, but L is already fixed in position 2. So GRADE is invalid here.

   Valid options left: BLADE, CLADE, GLADE

6. Among these, BLADE uses B and D – both common letters not yet tested.  
   CLADE uses C and D – C is slightly less common but still fine.  
   GLADE uses G and D – G is a bit less common.

   BLADE seems the most straightforward choice as it introduces B and D, both of which are very common letters.

Therefore, the next logical guess is BLADE.
