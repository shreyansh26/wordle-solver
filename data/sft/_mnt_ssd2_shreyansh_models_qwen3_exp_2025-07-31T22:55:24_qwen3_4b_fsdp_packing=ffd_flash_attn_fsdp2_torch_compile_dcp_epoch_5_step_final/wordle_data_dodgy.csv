For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers several common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and has a good balance of vowels and consonants. This should help narrow down possibilities effectively.

All five letters in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) are marked ""x"", so none of them appear in the secret word at all.  
That immediately eliminates all words containing any of those five letters.  
We need a fresh set of letters that avoids C, R, A, N, E entirely.

Some common letters that remain: S, T, L, O, U, I, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

A good second-guess strategy is to pick a word that introduces a new set of common letters while avoiding the known ""x"" letters.  
One strong candidate is ""STOIC"" (S, T, O, I, C), but C is already eliminated.  
Next, ""STOOL"" (S, T, O, O, L) avoids all eliminated letters and tests S, T, O, L.

Let me go with ""STOOL"" as it covers four new common letters (S, T, O, L) and repeats one for extra information.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

- Letters **not** in the word at all: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, L  
- Letter **in** the word but **not** in the positions we guessed: O (appears twice, but both times in positions 3 and 4, so O must be in positions 1 or 2 or 5)

- contain the letter O (but not in positions 3 or 4)
- contain no letters from the eliminated set: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, L

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y  
Remaining vowels: I, U (O is already known)

A good next guess should:
1. Place O in a new position (positions 1, 2, or 5)
2. Introduce several new common consonants and one vowel

Candidate words:
- ""BOBBY"" – uses B, O, Y, but repeats B and Y (not ideal)
- ""FOGGY"" – uses F, G, O, Y (but G repeats)
- ""MOPED"" – uses M, O, P, E, D – but E is eliminated

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers several common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and has a good balance of vowels and consonants. This should help narrow down possibilities effectively.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) are marked ""x"", so none of them appear in the secret word at all.  
That immediately eliminates all words containing any of those five letters.  
We need a fresh set of letters that avoids C, R, A, N, E entirely.

Some common letters that remain: S, T, L, O, U, I, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

A good second-guess strategy is to pick a word that introduces a new set of common letters while avoiding the known ""x"" letters.  
One strong candidate is ""STOIC"" (S, T, O, I, C), but C is already eliminated.  
Next, ""STOOL"" (S, T, O, O, L) avoids all eliminated letters and tests S, T, O, L.

Let me go with ""STOOL"" as it covers four new common letters (S, T, O, L) and repeats one for extra information.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

- Letters **not** in the word at all: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, L  
- Letter **in** the word but **not** in the positions we guessed: O (appears twice, but both times in positions 3 and 4, so O must be in positions 1 or 2 or 5)

So the word must:
- contain the letter O (but not in positions 3 or 4)
- contain no letters from the eliminated set: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, L

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y  
Remaining vowels: I, U (O is already known)

A good next guess should:
1. Place O in a new position (positions 1, 2, or 5)
2. Introduce several new common consonants and one vowel

Candidate words:
- ""BOBBY"" – uses B, O, Y, but repeats B and Y (not ideal)
- ""FOGGY"" – uses F, G, O, Y (but G repeats)
- ""MOPED"" – uses M, O, P, E, D – but E is eliminated
- ""HOIST"" – uses H, O, I, S, T – S and T are eliminated
- ""DOUBT"" – uses D, O, U, B, T – T is eliminated
- ""PODGY"" – uses P, O, D, G, Y (all letters are still allowed)

""PODGY"" places O in position 2 and tests P, D, G, Y – all new letters. This seems optimal.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers several common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and has a good balance of vowels and consonants. This should help narrow down possibilities effectively.

Here is some previous feedback:

All five letters in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) are marked ""x"", so none of them appear in the secret word at all.  
That immediately eliminates all words containing any of those five letters.  
We need a fresh set of letters that avoids C, R, A, N, E entirely.

Some common letters that remain: S, T, L, O, U, I, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

A good second-guess strategy is to pick a word that introduces a new set of common letters while avoiding the known ""x"" letters.  
One strong candidate is ""STOIC"" (S, T, O, I, C), but C is already eliminated.  
Next, ""STOOL"" (S, T, O, O, L) avoids all eliminated letters and tests S, T, O, L.

- Letter **in** the word but **not** in the positions we guessed: O (appears twice, but both times in positions 3 and 4, so O must be in positions 1 or 2 or 5)

So the word must:
- contain the letter O (but not in positions 3 or 4)
- contain no letters from the eliminated set: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, L

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y

A good next guess should:
1. Place O in a new position (positions 1, 2, or 5)
2. Introduce several new common consonants and one vowel

Candidate words:

From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters **not** in the word at all:  
   C, R, A, N, E, S, T, L, P, Y

2. Letters **in** the word and **in the correct positions** (from Guess 3):  
   - Position 2: O  
   - Positions 3, 4, 5: D, G, Y (in that exact order)

So the pattern is: _ O D G Y

We need to find a 5-letter word that ends in ODGY and uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Remaining allowed letters (not in the eliminated list):  
B, F, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a consonant for the first letter.  
Common consonants still allowed: B, F, H, M, W, etc.

Possible first letters:  
- B → BODGY (valid word)  
- F → FODGY (not a standard word)  
- H → HODGY (not standard)  
- M → M ODGY (not a word)  
- W → WODGY (not a word)  

The only standard word that fits is **BODGY**.

Let’s verify:  
- B is allowed (not in the eliminated list).  
- O, D, G, Y are already confirmed in their correct positions.  
- BODGY is a recognized 5-letter English word.

Therefore, the next and likely final guess is BODGY.

From the four rounds we now know:

1. Letters **not** in the word at all:  
   C, R, A, N, E, S, T, L, P, Y, B

2. Letters **in** the word and **in the correct positions** (from Guess 3 and 4):  
   - Position 2: O  
   - Positions 3, 4, 5: D, G, Y (in that exact order)

So the pattern is: _ O D G Y

We still need a first-letter consonant from the remaining allowed set:  
F, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We’re looking for a 5-letter word that ends in ODGY.  
The only common English word that fits this pattern is **HODGY** (but H is still allowed).  
Let’s check:  
- H is not in the eliminated list.  
- HODGY is a recognized word.

Therefore, the next and final guess is HODGY.
