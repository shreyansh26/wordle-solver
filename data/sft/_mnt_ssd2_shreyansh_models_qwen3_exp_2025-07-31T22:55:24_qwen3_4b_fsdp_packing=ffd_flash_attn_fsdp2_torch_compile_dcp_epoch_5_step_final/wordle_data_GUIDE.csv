### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first guess should use these letters to maximize information gain.

One of the most popular and effective first guesses is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter)

This combination covers 5 distinct common letters and can help identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word and in the correct 5th position (✓).

So the secret word ends with E and contains none of S, L, A, T.

Good letters to try next: common consonants not yet ruled out (R, N, C, D, P, M, etc.) and the vowel I or O (since A is ruled out).

A strong next guess should:
1. End with E.
2. Use new common letters.
3. Avoid S, L, A, T.

Possible candidates: ""CRONE"", ""PRONE"", ""DROVE"", ""MORSE"" (but S is ruled out), ""FRIED"", ""GRIPE"", etc.

""CRONE"" is good because it uses C, R, O, N (all untested common letters) and ends with E.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that uses none of the eliminated letters. Let's look for words like:
- D I E ? E  (but that's 4 letters)
- P I E ? E
- M I D E
- H I D E
- G I D E
- P U D E
- M U D E

A good candidate is ""MIDGE"" - it ends with E, uses M, I, D, G (all still possible), and is a valid word.

- Letters already ruled out: S, L, A, T, C, R, O, N, M.
- Letters that are in the word but in wrong positions: I, D, G.

So the word must contain I, D, G somewhere in the first four positions, and it must end with E.

Possible patterns:
- _ _ _ I E  (but I is in wrong position, so I can't be 4th)
- _ _ D I E  (but I is in wrong position, so I can't be 4th)
- _ _ G I E  (same issue)
- _ D I G E  (but G is in wrong position, so G can't be 4th)
- _ I D G E  (but G is in wrong position, so G can't be 4th)

We need a permutation of I, D, G in positions 1-4, with E in 5, and none of the eliminated letters.

Possible permutations:
1. D I G _ E  → but G is in wrong position (was 4th in MIDGE), so G can't be 3rd.
2. D G I _ E  → G is 2nd, I is 3rd - both are allowed.
3. G I D _ E  → G is 1st, I is 2nd, D is 3rd - all allowed.
4. I D G _ E  → I is 1st, D is 2nd, G is 3rd - all allowed.
5. I G D _ E  → I is 1st, G is 2nd, D is 3rd - all allowed.
6. G D I _ E  → G is 1st, D is 2nd, I is 3rd - all allowed.

Looking at the remaining letters (not yet eliminated): B, F, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to pick a letter for the 4th position (since 5th is E). Common letters left: B, K, P, U, etc.

Let's try ""PIDGE"":
- P, I, D, G, E
- P is allowed (not eliminated)
- I, D, G are confirmed present
- Ends with E
- No eliminated letters
- Pattern: P I D G E - this uses I, D, G in new positions (I 2nd, D 3rd, G 4th)

This seems like a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first guess should use these letters to maximize information gain.

One of the most popular and effective first guesses is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter)

This combination covers 5 distinct common letters and can help identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word and in the correct 5th position (✓).

So the secret word ends with E and contains none of S, L, A, T.

Good letters to try next: common consonants not yet ruled out (R, N, C, D, P, M, etc.) and the vowel I or O (since A is ruled out).

A strong next guess should:
1. End with E.
2. Use new common letters.
3. Avoid S, L, A, T.

Possible candidates: ""CRONE"", ""PRONE"", ""DROVE"", ""MORSE"" (but S is ruled out), ""FRIED"", ""GRIPE"", etc.

""CRONE"" is good because it uses C, R, O, N (all untested common letters) and ends with E.

So far we know:
- The word ends with E.
- Letters S, L, A, T, C, R, O, N are NOT in the word.

Remaining common letters that are still possible: D, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, plus the vowels I and U (since A and O are out).

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that uses none of the eliminated letters. Let's look for words like:
- D I E ? E  (but that's 4 letters)
- P I E ? E
- M I D E
- H I D E
- G I D E
- P U D E
- M U D E
- D I D E
- etc.

A good candidate is ""MIDGE"" - it ends with E, uses M, I, D, G (all still possible), and is a valid word.

Let's verify:
- M, I, D, G, E
- None of S, L, A, T, C, R, O, N are present.
- Ends with E.

This seems like a strong next guess to gather more information.

From all feedback so far:

- The word ends with E (✓ at position 5).
- Letters already ruled out: S, L, A, T, C, R, O, N, M, P.
- Letters that are in the word but in wrong positions: I, D, G.

So the word must contain I, D, G somewhere in positions 1-4, and it must end with E.  
The eliminated letters include all common consonants and vowels except:  
Vowels left: I, U (A, O ruled out).  
Consonants left: B, F, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to place I, D, G in positions 1-4, and fill the remaining spot with one of the allowed consonants.

Possible patterns:
- _ _ _ I E  → I cannot be 4th (from MIDGE feedback).
- _ _ D I E  → I cannot be 4th.
- _ _ G I E  → I cannot be 4th.
- _ D I G E  → G cannot be 4th (from MIDGE feedback).
- _ G I D E  → G cannot be 2nd (from PIDGE feedback).
- _ I D G E  → G cannot be 4th (from MIDGE feedback).
- _ I G D E  → G cannot be 3rd (from PIDGE feedback).
- _ D G I E  → G is 3rd, I is 4th → I cannot be 4th.
- _ G D I E  → G is 1st, D is 2nd, I is 3rd → all positions are new.
- _ I D G E  → G is 4th → invalid (from MIDGE feedback).
- _ I G D E  → G is 3rd → invalid (from PIDGE feedback).

The only valid pattern left is:
G D I _ E  → G is 1st, D is 2nd, I is 3rd, and the 4th letter must be one of the remaining consonants: B, F, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words ending with E, containing G, D, I in positions 1-3, and one of those consonants in position 4:

- G D I B E → not a word.
- G D I F E → not a word.
- G D I H E → not a word.
- G D I K E → not a word.
- G D I V E → ""GIVE"" is 4 letters.
- G D I W E → not a word.

Wait, let's re-examine the pattern. The letters I, D, G must all appear, but they don't have to be in that specific order. We need to permute I, D, G in positions 1-4 while ensuring no letter is in the same spot as before.

From PIDGE feedback:
- I was in position 2 → cannot be 2nd.
- D was in position 3 → cannot be 3rd.
- G was in position 4 → cannot be 4th.

So valid positions for I, D, G are:
- I: 1, 3, 4
- D: 1, 2, 4
- G: 1, 2, 3

We need a permutation of I, D, G in positions 1-4 with these restrictions and one extra consonant in the remaining spot.

Possible permutations:
1. G D I _ E  → G1, D2, I3 → valid (positions not reused).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|>

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first guess should use these letters to maximize information gain.

One of the most popular and effective first guesses is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter)

This combination covers 5 distinct common letters and can help identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word and in the correct 5th position (✓).

So the secret word ends with E and contains none of S, L, A, T.

Good letters to try next: common consonants not yet ruled out (R, N, C, D, P, M, etc.) and the vowel I or O (since A is ruled out).

A strong next guess should:
1. End with E.
2. Use new common letters.
3. Avoid S, L, A, T.

Possible candidates: ""CRONE"", ""PRONE"", ""DROVE"", ""MORSE"" (but S is ruled out), ""FRIED"", ""GRIPE"", etc.

""CRONE"" is good because it uses C, R, O, N (all untested common letters) and ends with E.

So far we know:
- The word ends with E.
- Letters S, L, A, T, C, R, O, N are NOT in the word.

Remaining common letters that are still possible: D, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, plus the vowels I and U (since A and O are out).

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that uses none of the eliminated letters. Let's look for words like:
- D I E ? E  (but that's 4 letters)
- P I E ? E
- M I D E
- H I D E
- G I D E
- P U D E
- M U D E
- D I D E
- etc.

A good candidate is ""MIDGE"" - it ends with E, uses M, I, D, G (all still possible), and is a valid word.

Let's verify:
- M, I, D, G, E
- None of S, L, A, T, C, R, O, N are present.
- Ends with E.

This seems like a strong next guess to gather more information.

From the new feedback:

- The word ends with E (confirmed again).
- Letters already ruled out: S, L, A, T, C, R, O, N, M.
- Letters that are in the word but in wrong positions: I, D, G.

So the word must contain I, D, G somewhere in the first four positions, and it must end with E.

Possible patterns:
- _ _ _ I E  (but I is in wrong position, so I can't be 4th)
- _ _ D I E  (but I is in wrong position, so I can't be 4th)
- _ _ G I E  (same issue)
- _ D I G E  (but G is in wrong position, so G can't be 4th)
- _ I D G E  (but G is in wrong position, so G can't be 4th)

We need a permutation of I, D, G in positions 1-4, with E in 5, and none of the eliminated letters.

Possible permutations:
1. D I G _ E  → but G is in wrong position (was 4th in MIDGE), so G can't be 3rd.
2. D G I _ E  → G is 2nd, I is 3rd - both are allowed.
3. G I D _ E  → G is 1st, I is 2nd, D is 3rd - all allowed.
4. I D G _ E  → I is 1st, D is 2nd, G is 3rd - all allowed.
5. I G D _ E  → I is 1st, G is 2nd, D is 3rd - all allowed.
6. G D I _ E  → G is 1st, D is 2nd, I is 3rd - all allowed.

Looking at the remaining letters (not yet eliminated): B, F, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to pick a letter for the 4th position (since 5th is E). Common letters left: B, K, P, U, etc.

Let's try ""PIDGE"":
- P, I, D, G, E
- P is allowed (not eliminated)
- I, D, G are confirmed present
- Ends with E
- No eliminated letters
- Pattern: P I D G E - this uses I, D, G in new positions (I 2nd, D 3rd, G 4th)

This seems like a valid next guess.

So far we know:

- The word ends with E.
- Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, R, O, N, M, P.
- Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions: I, D, G.

That means I, D, and G must appear somewhere in the first four positions, but none of them can be in the exact positions they occupied in the earlier guesses:

- I was in position 2 in MIDGE and PIDGE → I cannot be in position 2.
- D was in position 3 in MIDGE and PIDGE → D cannot be in position 3.
- G was in position 4 in MIDGE and PIDGE → G cannot be in position 4.

So the pattern must be: positions 1, 2, 3, 4 contain I, D, G (each exactly once) plus one new letter that hasn’t been ruled out yet. The new letter must be from the remaining unused alphabet (B, F, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Let’s list all possible permutations of I, D, G with one additional allowed letter in positions 1-4, and see which forms a valid 5-letter English word ending in E.

Possible new letters: B, F, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try inserting each new letter into every possible spot and check if any permutation forms a valid word:

1. Insert B:
   - B I D G E → “BIDGE” – not a valid English word.
   - I B D G E → “IBDGE” – invalid.
   - D I B G E → “DIBGE” – invalid.
   - G I B D E → “GIBDE” – invalid.
   - I G B D E → “IGBDE” – invalid.
   - D G I B E → “DGIBE” – invalid.
   - etc. – none valid.

2. Insert F:
   - F I D G E → “FIDGE” – valid word (past tense of “fiddle”).

Let’s verify:
- F is not in the eliminated list.
- I, D, G are all in the word and in new positions (I 2nd, D 3rd, G 4th – none of these were positions 2, 3, 4 in earlier guesses, respectively).
- Ends with E.

Therefore, “FIDGE” is a valid next guess.
