For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring letters like A, E, I, O, U, R, S, T, L, N. 

One of the most common 5-letter words is ""AROSE"" which contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. This should give me good information about which of these letters are in the word and their positions.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E) or ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E). However, ""AROSE"" covers more of the high-frequency letters. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess because it maximizes the chance of hitting multiple correct letters early on.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 1)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 2)
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- contains both A and R, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively
- does NOT contain O, S, or E

Next guess should:
1. Keep A and R in different positions
2. Avoid O, S, E
3. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tested yet (like T, N, L, I, C, D, etc.)

A good candidate is “TRAIN”:

This tests several new letters while keeping A and R in different positions.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring letters like A, E, I, O, U, R, S, T, L, N. 

One of the most common 5-letter words is ""AROSE"" which contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. This should give me good information about which of these letters are in the word and their positions.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E) or ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E). However, ""AROSE"" covers more of the high-frequency letters. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess because it maximizes the chance of hitting multiple correct letters early on.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 1)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 2)
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- contains both A and R, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively
- does NOT contain O, S, or E

Next guess should:
1. Keep A and R in different positions
2. Avoid O, S, E
3. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tested yet (like T, N, L, I, C, D, etc.)

A good candidate is “TRAIN”:
- T (new letter)
- R (still in the word, now in position 2)
- A (still in the word, now in position 3)
- I (new letter)
- N (new letter)

This tests several new letters while keeping A and R in different positions.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - O, S, E are not in the word.

2. TRAIN → T(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   - T, I, N are not in the word.
   - R is still in the word but not in position 2 (confirmed).
   - A is still in the word but not in position 3 (confirmed).

So far we know:
- Letters definitely absent: O, S, E, T, I, N
- Letters definitely present: A, R (but not in positions 1, 3 for A; not in position 2 for R)
- Remaining unused common letters: D, L, C, U, M, P, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and R
- Does not contain O, S, E, T, I, N
- Places A somewhere other than positions 1 or 3
- Places R somewhere other than position 2

Let’s try “CRAMP”:
- C, M, P are new letters
- Contains A and R
- A is in position 2 (allowed)
- R is in position 3 (allowed)

This seems like a good next guess to test new letters while respecting the constraints.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters NOT in the word (from every feedback):
O, S, E, T, I, N, C, P, L

Letters that ARE in the word (but whose exact positions are still unknown):
A, R, M

Position constraints:
- A is NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 → therefore A must be in position 5.
- R is NOT in positions 2, 3, 5 → therefore R must be in position 1 or 4.
- M is NOT in positions 3, 4 → therefore M must be in position 1, 2, or 5. But position 5 is already taken by A, so M must be in position 1 or 2.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- ends with A (position 5 fixed)
- contains R in position 1 or 4
- contains M in position 1 or 2
- uses only letters not yet ruled out: A, R, M, plus any of the remaining common letters (D, U, G, H, Y, K, B, F, V, W, etc.)

Let’s list possible patterns:

Case 1: R in position 1
- R _ _ _ A
  - M must be in position 2
  - So word starts with R M _ _ A
  - Need two more letters (positions 3 and 4) from allowed set (D, U, G, H, Y, K, B, F, V, W)
  - Possible: R M D U A → “RM DUA” (invalid), R M U D A → “RMUDA” (invalid), etc. No valid English word here.

Case 2: R in position 4
- _ _ _ R A
  - M must be in position 1 or 2
  - Subcase 2a: M in position 1
    - M _ _ R A
    - Need two letters for positions 2 and 3 from allowed set
    - Possible: M U N R A → “MUNRA” (invalid), M U D R A → “MUDRA” (valid word)
  - Subcase 2b: M in position 2
    - _ M _ R A
    - Need letters for positions 1 and 3
    - Possible: D M U R A → “DMURA” (invalid), G M U R A → “GMURA” (invalid), etc. No valid English word found.

The only valid candidate that fits is “MUDRA”:
- M U D R A
- Ends with A (position 5)
- R is in position 4 (allowed)
- M is in position 1 (allowed)
- Uses only allowed letters (M, U, D, R, A)

Let’s double-check against all constraints:
- Does it contain A, R, M? Yes.
- Does it avoid every forbidden letter? Yes (O, S, E, T, I, N, C, P, L are absent).
- Does it respect position constraints? Yes.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring letters like A, E, I, O, U, R, S, T, L, N. 

One of the most common 5-letter words is ""AROSE"" which contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. This should give me good information about which of these letters are in the word and their positions.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E) or ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E). However, ""AROSE"" covers more of the high-frequency letters. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess because it maximizes the chance of hitting multiple correct letters early on.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 1)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 2)
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- contains both A and R, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively
- does NOT contain O, S, or E

Next guess should:
1. Keep A and R in different positions
2. Avoid O, S, E
3. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tested yet (like T, N, L, I, C, D, etc.)

A good candidate is “TRAIN”:
- T (new letter)
- R (still in the word, now in position 2)
- A (still in the word, now in position 3)
- I (new letter)
- N (new letter)

This tests several new letters while keeping A and R in different positions.

Guess 2: TRAIN -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - O, S, E are not in the word.

2. TRAIN → T(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   - T, I, N are not in the word.
   - R is still in the word but not in position 2 (confirmed).
   - A is still in the word but not in position 3 (confirmed).

So far we know:
- Letters definitely absent: O, S, E, T, I, N
- Letters definitely present: A, R (but not in positions 1, 3 for A; not in position 2 for R)
- Remaining unused common letters: D, L, C, U, M, P, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and R
- Does not contain O, S, E, T, I, N
- Places A somewhere other than positions 1 or 3
- Places R somewhere other than position 2

Let’s try “CRAMP”:
- C, M, P are new letters
- Contains A and R
- A is in position 2 (allowed)
- R is in position 3 (allowed)

This seems like a good next guess to test new letters while respecting the constraints.

Current constraints:

Letters NOT in the word: O, S, E, T, I, N, C, P  
Letters definitely in the word: A, R, M (but each in wrong positions so far)

Known positions:
- A is NOT in positions 1, 3  
- R is NOT in positions 2, 3  
- M is NOT in position 4

Remaining unused common letters: D, L, U, G, H, Y, K, B, F, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- contains A, R, M
- does NOT contain any of the forbidden letters
- places A, R, M in positions they have NOT been tried yet

Possible positions for each:
- A: 2, 4, 5
- R: 1, 4, 5
- M: 1, 2, 3, 5

Let’s look for words that satisfy these constraints. One candidate is “ARMYD” but that’s not a valid word. Another is “MURAL”:
- M, U, R, A, L
- Contains A, R, M
- Does NOT contain any forbidden letters
- A is in position 4 (allowed)
- R is in position 3 (but R was previously in position 3 and got “-” so position 3 is forbidden for R) → invalid.

Next candidate: “MARRY” – contains two R’s, but we already know R is in the word once, not sure if duplicates are allowed.

Try “DRAMA”:
- D, R, A, M, A
- Contains A, R, M
- A is in positions 2 and 5 (allowed)
- R is in position 2 (but R was previously in position 2 and got “-” so position 2 is forbidden for R) → invalid.

Next: “ARMAD” – not a valid word.

Next: “LAMAR”:
- L, A, M, A, R
- Contains A, R, M
- A is in positions 2 and 4 (allowed)
- R is in position 5 (allowed)
- M is in position 3 (allowed)
- Letters used: L, A, M, A, R – all allowed and none forbidden.

This seems valid.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters NOT in the word (from every feedback):
O, S, E, T, I, N, C, P, L

Letters that ARE in the word (but whose exact positions are still unknown):
A, R, M

Position constraints:
- A is NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 → therefore A must be in position 5.
- R is NOT in positions 2, 3, 5 → therefore R must be in position 1 or 4.
- M is NOT in positions 3, 4 → therefore M must be in position 1, 2, or 5. But position 5 is already taken by A, so M must be in position 1 or 2.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- ends with A (position 5 fixed)
- contains R in position 1 or 4
- contains M in position 1 or 2
- uses only letters not yet ruled out: A, R, M, plus any of the remaining common letters (D, U, G, H, Y, K, B, F, V, W, etc.)

Let’s list possible patterns:

Case 1: R in position 1
- R _ _ _ A
  - M must be in position 2
  - So word starts with R M _ _ A
  - Need two more letters (positions 3 and 4) from allowed set (D, U, G, H, Y, K, B, F, V, W)
  - Possible: R M D U A → “RM DUA” (invalid), R M U D A → “RMUDA” (invalid), etc. No valid English word here.

Case 2: R in position 4
- _ _ _ R A
  - M must be in position 1 or 2
  - Subcase 2a: M in position 1
    - M _ _ R A
    - Need two letters for positions 2 and 3 from allowed set
    - Possible: M U N R A → “MUNRA” (invalid), M U D R A → “MUDRA” (valid word)
  - Subcase 2b: M in position 2
    - _ M _ R A
    - Need letters for positions 1 and 3
    - Possible: D M U R A → “DMURA” (invalid), G M U R A → “GMURA” (invalid), etc. No valid English word found.

The only valid candidate that fits is “MUDRA”:
- M U D R A
- Ends with A (position 5)
- R is in position 4 (allowed)
- M is in position 1 (allowed)
- Uses only allowed letters (M, U, D, R, A)

Let’s double-check against all constraints:
- Does it contain A, R, M? Yes.
- Does it avoid every forbidden letter? Yes (O, S, E, T, I, N, C, P, L are absent).
- Does it respect position constraints? Yes.

The only valid word we found is “UMBRA”:
- U M B R A
- Ends with RA (positions 4-5 correct)
- Contains M and U
- M is in position 2 (allowed)
- U is in position 1 (allowed)
- Uses only allowed letters (no forbidden letters)

Let’s double-check:
- U, M, B, R, A
- Forbidden letters: O, S, E, T, I, N, C, P, L, D – none of these are present.
- M is not in position 1 (it’s in 2) – OK
- U is not in position 2 (it’s in 1) – OK
- R and A are in correct positions – OK

Therefore, “UMBRA” is the logical next guess.",Guess 6: UMBRA -> FEEDBACK: U(✓) M(✓) B(✓) R(✓) A(✓),SUCCESS
