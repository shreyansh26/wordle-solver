For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters to quickly identify which ones are in the word.

Looking at common 5-letter words with high-frequency letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice. It contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. This will help me quickly determine which of these key letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word.
- S is in the word and in position 4.
- E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Position 4 is S.
- The word contains A, but not in position 1.
- The word does NOT contain R, O, or E.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- S in position 4.
- A somewhere else (positions 2, 3, or 5).
- No R, O, or E.

Possible patterns:
_ _ _ S _
with A in one of positions 2, 3, or 5.

Let’s think of words that fit:
- If A is in position 2: _ A _ S _
- If A is in position 3: _ _ A S _
- If A is in position 5: _ _ _ S A

Common words fitting these patterns:
- “MADLY” – but L is uncommon.
- “PASTA” – but T is common, and A is in position 5.
- “FASHI” – not a word.
- “WASPS” – but S is already used in position 4, and we don’t know if double S is allowed.

“PASTA” seems good because:
- P, A, S, T are common letters.
- S is in position 4.
- A is in position 2.
- No R, O, or E.

But wait – the feedback said S is in position 4, so “PASTA” has S in position 3, which would conflict. That’s wrong.

Let me rethink:
We need S in position 4, A somewhere else, and no R, O, E.

Good candidates:
- “HASTA” – but T is common, and A is in position 5.
- “CASKS” – but S is in position 4 and 5, and we don’t know about double S.
- “WASPS” – same issue with double S.

“HASTA”:
- H, A, S, T, A – but S is in position 3, not 4. Not good.

“WASPS”:
- W, A, S, P, S – S in position 3 and 5, but we need S in 4.

“MASHA” – but A is in position 5, and S in 3, not 4.

“SALSA” – S in 1, 4, 5 – but we need S in 4.

“PLASH” – P, L, A, S, H – S in 4, A in 3. This fits:
- S in 4 (✓)
- A in 3 (allowed, since feedback only said A is in word but not in position 1)
- No R, O, E.

“PLASH” is a valid word and fits all constraints.

Based on the feedback, I need a word with S in position 4, containing A but not in position 1, and avoiding R, O, E. A good candidate is “PLASH”.

Looking at common 5-letter words with high-frequency letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice. It contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. This will help me quickly determine which of these key letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word.
- S is in the word and in position 4.
- E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Position 4 is S.
- The word contains A, but not in position 1.
- The word does NOT contain R, O, or E.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- S in position 4.
- A somewhere else (positions 2, 3, or 5).
- No R, O, or E.

Possible patterns:
_ _ _ S _
with A in one of positions 2, 3, or 5.

Let’s think of words that fit:
- If A is in position 2: _ A _ S _
- If A is in position 3: _ _ A S _
- If A is in position 5: _ _ _ S A

Common words fitting these patterns:
- “MADLY” – but L is uncommon.
- “PASTA” – but T is common, and A is in position 5.
- “FASHI” – not a word.
- “WASPS” – but S is already used in position 4, and we don’t know if double S is allowed.

“PASTA” seems good because:
- P, A, S, T are common letters.
- S is in position 4.
- A is in position 2.
- No R, O, or E.

But wait – the feedback said S is in position 4, so “PASTA” has S in position 3, which would conflict. That’s wrong.

Let me rethink:
We need S in position 4, A somewhere else, and no R, O, E.

Good candidates:
- “HASTA” – but T is common, and A is in position 5.
- “CASKS” – but S is in position 4 and 5, and we don’t know about double S.
- “WASPS” – same issue with double S.

“HASTA”:
- H, A, S, T, A – but S is in position 3, not 4. Not good.

“WASPS”:
- W, A, S, P, S – S in position 3 and 5, but we need S in 4.

“MASHA” – but A is in position 5, and S in 3, not 4.

“SALSA” – S in 1, 4, 5 – but we need S in 4.

“PLASH” – P, L, A, S, H – S in 4, A in 3. This fits:
- S in 4 (✓)
- A in 3 (allowed, since feedback only said A is in word but not in position 1)
- No R, O, E.

“PLASH” is a valid word and fits all constraints.Based on the feedback, I need a word with S in position 4, containing A but not in position 1, and avoiding R, O, E. A good candidate is “PLASH”.

Guess 2: plash -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(✓) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on “plash”:

- P(x) – P is not in the word at all.
- L(✓) – L is in the word and in position 2.
- A(✓) – A is in the word and in position 3.
- S(✓) – S is in the word and in position 4.
- H(✓) – H is in the word and in position 5.

So the secret word has the exact pattern: _ L A S H.

Only the first letter is unknown. The remaining letters must be a single consonant that hasn’t been ruled out yet. From prior feedback, we know:
- R, O, E are not in the word.
- P is not in the word.
- Letters already placed: L, A, S, H.

Possible first letters (common consonants not yet excluded): B, C, D, F, G, K, M, N, T, W, Y, etc.

Looking for common 5-letter words ending in “LASH”:
- “BLASH” – not a valid English word.
- “CLASH” – valid word.
- “FLASH” – valid word.
- “GLASH” – not valid.
- “PLASH” – already used.
- “SLASH” – valid word (but S is already used in position 4, so double S is possible).
- “TLASH” – not valid.

Among the valid options, “CLASH”, “FLASH”, and “SLASH” are all possible. “CLASH” is the most common one, so I’ll choose it next.

Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word.
- S is in the word and in position 4.
- E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Position 4 is S.
- The word contains A, but not in position 1.
- The word does NOT contain R, O, or E.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- S in position 4.
- A somewhere else (positions 2, 3, or 5).
- No R, O, or E.

Possible patterns:
_ _ _ S _
with A in one of positions 2, 3, or 5.

Let’s think of words that fit:
- If A is in position 2: _ A _ S _
- If A is in position 3: _ _ A S _
- If A is in position 5: _ _ _ S A

Common words fitting these patterns:
- “MADLY” – but L is uncommon.
- “PASTA” – but T is common, and A is in position 5.
- “FASHI” – not a word.
- “WASPS” – but S is already used in position 4, and we don’t know if double S is allowed.

“PASTA” seems good because:
- P, A, S, T are common letters.
- S is in position 4.
- A is in position 2.
- No R, O, or E.

But wait – the feedback said S is in position 4, so “PASTA” has S in position 3, which would conflict. That’s wrong.

Let me rethink:
We need S in position 4, A somewhere else, and no R, O, E.

Good candidates:
- “HASTA” – but T is common, and A is in position 5.
- “CASKS” – but S is in position 4 and 5, and we don’t know about double S.
- “WASPS” – same issue with double S.

“HASTA”:
- H, A, S, T, A – but S is in position 3, not 4. Not good.

“WASPS”:
- W, A, S, P, S – S in position 3 and 5, but we need S in 4.

“MASHA” – but A is in position 5, and S in 3, not 4.

“SALSA” – S in 1, 4, 5 – but we need S in 4.

“PLASH” – P, L, A, S, H – S in 4, A in 3. This fits:
- S in 4 (✓)
- A in 3 (allowed, since feedback only said A is in word but not in position 1)
- No R, O, E.

“PLASH” is a valid word and fits all constraints.Based on the feedback, I need a word with S in position 4, containing A but not in position 1, and avoiding R, O, E. A good candidate is “PLASH”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters to quickly identify which ones are in the word.

Looking at common 5-letter words with high-frequency letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice. It contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. This will help me quickly determine which of these key letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word.
- S is in the word and in position 4.
- E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Position 4 is S.
- The word contains A, but not in position 1.
- The word does NOT contain R, O, or E.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- S in position 4.
- A somewhere else (positions 2, 3, or 5).
- No R, O, or E.

Possible patterns:
_ _ _ S _
with A in one of positions 2, 3, or 5.

Let’s think of words that fit:
- If A is in position 2: _ A _ S _
- If A is in position 3: _ _ A S _
- If A is in position 5: _ _ _ S A

Common words fitting these patterns:
- “MADLY” – but L is uncommon.
- “PASTA” – but T is common, and A is in position 5.
- “FASHI” – not a word.
- “WASPS” – but S is already used in position 4, and we don’t know if double S is allowed.

“PASTA” seems good because:
- P, A, S, T are common letters.
- S is in position 4.
- A is in position 2.
- No R, O, or E.

But wait – the feedback said S is in position 4, so “PASTA” has S in position 3, which would conflict. That’s wrong.

Let me rethink:
We need S in position 4, A somewhere else, and no R, O, E.

Good candidates:
- “HASTA” – but T is common, and A is in position 5.
- “CASKS” – but S is in position 4 and 5, and we don’t know about double S.
- “WASPS” – same issue with double S.

“HASTA”:
- H, A, S, T, A – but S is in position 3, not 4. Not good.

“WASPS”:
- W, A, S, P, S – S in position 3 and 5, but we need S in 4.

“MASHA” – but A is in position 5, and S in 3, not 4.

“SALSA” – S in 1, 4, 5 – but we need S in 4.

“PLASH” – P, L, A, S, H – S in 4, A in 3. This fits:
- S in 4 (✓)
- A in 3 (allowed, since feedback only said A is in word but not in position 1)
- No R, O, E.

“PLASH” is a valid word and fits all constraints.Based on the feedback, I need a word with S in position 4, containing A but not in position 1, and avoiding R, O, E. A good candidate is “PLASH”.

- A(✓) – A is in the word and in position 3.
- S(✓) – S is in the word and in position 4.
- H(✓) – H is in the word and in position 5.

So the secret word has the exact pattern: _ L A S H.

Only the first letter is unknown. The remaining letters must be a single consonant that hasn’t been ruled out yet. From prior feedback, we know:
- R, O, E are not in the word.
- P is not in the word.
- Letters already placed: L, A, S, H.

Possible first letters (common consonants not yet excluded): B, C, D, F, G, K, M, N, T, W, Y, etc.

Looking for common 5-letter words ending in “LASH”:
- “BLASH” – not a valid English word.
- “CLASH” – valid word.
- “FLASH” – valid word.
- “GLASH” – not valid.
- “PLASH” – already used.
- “SLASH” – valid word (but S is already used in position 4, so double S is possible).
- “TLASH” – not valid.

Among the valid options, “CLASH”, “FLASH”, and “SLASH” are all possible. “CLASH” is the most common one, so I’ll choose it next.

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, K, M, N, T, W, Y, etc.

- B L A S H – “BLASH” is not a valid word.

This fits:\n- S in 4 (✓)\n- A in 3 (allowed, since feedback only said A is in word but not in position 1)\n- No R, O, E.\n\n“PLASH” is a valid word and fits all constraints.Based on the feedback, I need a word with S in position 4, containing A but not in position 1, and avoiding R, O, E.

From all feedback so far, the exact pattern of the secret word is:

Position 1: unknown (but not A, C, E, F, O, P, R, B)
Positions 2-5: L A S H

Letters already ruled out for position 1: A, C, E, F, O, P, R, B

Remaining common consonants for position 1: D, G, K, M, N, T, W, Y

Looking for valid 5-letter English words that fit _ L A S H:

- D L A S H → “DLASH” (invalid)
- G L A S H → “GLASH” (invalid)
- K L A S H → “KLASH” (invalid)
- M L A S H → “MLASH” (invalid)
- N L A S H → “NLASH” (invalid)
- T L A S H → “TLASH” (invalid)
- W L A S H → “WLASH” (invalid)
- Y L A S H → “YLASH” (invalid)

None of these are valid English words. This suggests the only remaining possibility is a less common word or a non-word, which is impossible. 

Rechecking the feedback carefully:
- Every guess so far has confirmed positions 2-5 as L A S H.
- The only remaining valid English word that fits _ L A S H is “BLASH”, but it’s invalid.
- This indicates the secret word must be “BLASH” despite the dictionary issue, or there’s an error in prior steps.

However, the only consistent conclusion is that the secret word is “BLASH”, as all other first letters have been ruled out. Since this is the only remaining possibility, the word must be “BLASH”.

But since “BLASH” is not in standard word lists, the correct word must be “BLASH” as per the feedback. Therefore, the final guess is:
