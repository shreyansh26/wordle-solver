For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that combines several of these common letters in different positions to help identify which letters are in the secret word.

A good starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

Letters that are NOT in the word (and therefore cannot appear in positions 4 or 5):

Remaining common consonants that haven’t been ruled out: N, D, P, B, G, H, K, V, W, Y
Remaining vowels: I, U (O is already out)

We need a 5-letter word that starts with “REA” and uses only letters from the allowed set.

Possible candidates:
- REAPI (but I is a vowel, and we haven’t ruled out I)
- REARD (but D is allowed)
- REAPS (but S is excluded)
- REAVE (but V and E are allowed, but S is excluded)
- REAID (but I is allowed)
- REAGS (but S is excluded)

Looking for the most common remaining letters, let’s try “REAPI” – but “API” isn’t a common English ending. Instead, let’s try “REAPS” – but S is excluded. Next, “REAID” – but I is allowed, but “ID” is a common ending.

However, “REAID” isn’t a valid English word. Let’s think of valid words:

Valid words starting with “REA”:

- REAVE (valid, but V is allowed)

“REAVE” is a valid word meaning to rob or steal. It uses:
- R (✓)
- E (✓)
- A (✓)
- V (new letter, not excluded)
- E (already confirmed, but duplicate E is allowed)

But “REAVE” has E in position 5, which is allowed since E is only excluded from position 5 in the earlier feedback (no, earlier feedback only said E(-) in position 5, meaning E is in the word but not in position 5. So E is allowed in positions 1-4, but position 5 is excluded. Wait, let’s recheck:

From Guess 1 (AROSE): E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 5.
From Guess 2 (REACT): E(✓) in position 2 means E is in the word AND in position 2.
So E is confirmed in position 2, and cannot appear anywhere else (since it’s already placed there). Therefore, E cannot appear in position 4 or 5.

So the word must be R E A _ _ with letters not in {O, S, C, T, L, M} and no additional E.

Remaining letters for positions 4 and 5: N, D, P, B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, I, U.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that combines several of these common letters in different positions to help identify which letters are in the secret word.

A good starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x): O is not in the word.
- S(x): S is not in the word.
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters that are in the word: A, R, E
- Letters that are NOT in the word: O, S
- Positions to avoid:
  - A cannot be in position 1
  - R cannot be in position 2
  - E cannot be in position 5

Next, I want a word that:
1. Contains A, R, E
2. Does NOT contain O or S
3. Places A, R, E in new positions
4. Introduces new common letters (T, N, L, etc.) to gather more info

A good candidate is ""RAISE"":
- R in position 1 (new position for R)
- A in position 2 (new position for A)
- I (new common letter)
- S (but S is already excluded, so this is bad)
Oops, S is excluded. Let's try ""TARRE"":
- T (new letter)
- A (position 2)
- R (position 3)
- R (position 4)
- E (position 5) – but E cannot be in position 5, so this is bad.

Next candidate: ""REACT"":
- R in position 1
- E in position 2
- A in position 3
- C (new letter)
- T (new letter)

This avoids all excluded letters (O, S) and places A, R, E in new positions. It also introduces C and T.

- E(✓): E is in the word AND in position 2.
- A(✓): A is in the word AND in position 3.
- C(x): C is NOT in the word.
- T(x): T is NOT in the word.

So we now know the exact pattern:
R E A _ _

Letters confirmed: R, E, A (positions 1, 2, 3)
Letters excluded: O, S, C, T
We still need two more letters for positions 4 and 5.

Good remaining common consonants: N, L, D, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since O is excluded)

Let’s try a word that fits R E A _ _ and uses new common letters.
""READS"" is out because S is excluded.
""REALM"":
- R E A L M
- L and M are new letters, neither excluded.
- This seems like a solid next guess.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with “REA” and uses only letters from the allowed set.

Possible candidates:

- REARD (but D is allowed)
- REAPS (but S is excluded)
- REAVE (but V and E are allowed, but S is excluded)
- REAID (but I is allowed)
- REAGS (but S is excluded)

Looking for the most common remaining letters, let’s try “REAPI” – but “API” isn’t a common English ending. Instead, let’s try “REAPS” – but S is excluded. Next, “REAID” – but I is allowed, but “ID” is a common ending.

However, “REAID” isn’t a valid English word. Let’s think of valid words:

Valid words starting with “REA”:
- REACT (C and T excluded)
- REALM (L and M excluded)
- REAVE (V and E allowed, but E is already in position 2)
- REAPS (S excluded)
- REARD (not a word)
- REAVE (valid, but V is allowed)

“REAVE” is a valid word meaning to rob or steal. It uses:
- R (✓)
- E (✓)
- A (✓)
- V (new letter, not excluded)
- E (already confirmed, but duplicate E is allowed)

But “REAVE” has E in position 5, which is allowed since E is only excluded from position 5 in the earlier feedback (no, earlier feedback only said E(-) in position 5, meaning E is in the word but not in position 5. So E is allowed in positions 1-4, but position 5 is excluded. Wait, let’s recheck:

From Guess 1 (AROSE): E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 5.
From Guess 2 (REACT): E(✓) in position 2 means E is in the word AND in position 2.
So E is confirmed in position 2, and cannot appear anywhere else (since it’s already placed there). Therefore, E cannot appear in position 4 or 5.

So the word must be R E A _ _ with letters not in {O, S, C, T, L, M} and no additional E.

Remaining letters for positions 4 and 5: N, D, P, B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, I, U.

Possible valid words:
- REAND (not a word)
- REAPD (not a word)
- REAVY (V and Y allowed)
- REAID (not a word)
- REABY (not a word)
- REAGY (not a word)
- REAPI (not a word)
- REAUK (not a word)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that combines several of these common letters in different positions to help identify which letters are in the secret word.

A good starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x): O is not in the word.
- S(x): S is not in the word.
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters that are in the word: A, R, E
- Letters that are NOT in the word: O, S
- Positions to avoid:
  - A cannot be in position 1
  - R cannot be in position 2
  - E cannot be in position 5

Next, I want a word that:
1. Contains A, R, E
2. Does NOT contain O or S
3. Places A, R, E in new positions
4. Introduces new common letters (T, N, L, etc.) to gather more info

A good candidate is ""RAISE"":
- R in position 1 (new position for R)
- A in position 2 (new position for A)
- I (new common letter)
- S (but S is already excluded, so this is bad)
Oops, S is excluded. Let's try ""TARRE"":
- T (new letter)
- A (position 2)
- R (position 3)
- R (position 4)
- E (position 5) – but E cannot be in position 5, so this is bad.

Next candidate: ""REACT"":
- R in position 1
- E in position 2
- A in position 3
- C (new letter)
- T (new letter)

This avoids all excluded letters (O, S) and places A, R, E in new positions. It also introduces C and T.

Guess 2: REACT -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(✓) A(✓) C(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on REACT:
- R(✓): R is in the word AND in position 1.
- E(✓): E is in the word AND in position 2.
- A(✓): A is in the word AND in position 3.
- C(x): C is NOT in the word.
- T(x): T is NOT in the word.

So we now know the exact pattern:
R E A _ _

Letters confirmed: R, E, A (positions 1, 2, 3)
Letters excluded: O, S, C, T
We still need two more letters for positions 4 and 5.

Good remaining common consonants: N, L, D, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since O is excluded)

Let’s try a word that fits R E A _ _ and uses new common letters.
""READS"" is out because S is excluded.
""REALM"":
- R E A L M
- L and M are new letters, neither excluded.
- This seems like a solid next guess.

We now have the exact pattern: R E A _ _

Letters already confirmed:
- R (position 1)
- E (position 2)
- A (position 3)

Letters that are NOT in the word (and therefore cannot appear in positions 4 or 5):
- O, S, C, T, L, M

Remaining common consonants that haven’t been ruled out: N, D, P, B, G, H, K, V, W, Y
Remaining vowels: I, U (O is already out)

We need a 5-letter word that starts with “REA” and uses only letters from the allowed set.

Possible candidates:
- REAPI (but I is a vowel, and we haven’t ruled out I)
- REARD (but D is allowed)
- REAPS (but S is excluded)
- REAVE (but V and E are allowed, but S is excluded)
- REAID (but I is allowed)
- REAGS (but S is excluded)

Looking for the most common remaining letters, let’s try “REAPI” – but “API” isn’t a common English ending. Instead, let’s try “REAPS” – but S is excluded. Next, “REAID” – but I is allowed, but “ID” is a common ending.

However, “REAID” isn’t a valid English word. Let’s think of valid words:

Valid words starting with “REA”:
- REACT (C and T excluded)
- REALM (L and M excluded)
- REAVE (V and E allowed, but E is already in position 2)
- REAPS (S excluded)
- REARD (not a word)
- REAVE (valid, but V is allowed)

“REAVE” is a valid word meaning to rob or steal. It uses:
- R (✓)
- E (✓)
- A (✓)
- V (new letter, not excluded)
- E (already confirmed, but duplicate E is allowed)

But “REAVE” has E in position 5, which is allowed since E is only excluded from position 5 in the earlier feedback (no, earlier feedback only said E(-) in position 5, meaning E is in the word but not in position 5. So E is allowed in positions 1-4, but position 5 is excluded. Wait, let’s recheck:

From Guess 1 (AROSE): E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 5.
From Guess 2 (REACT): E(✓) in position 2 means E is in the word AND in position 2.
So E is confirmed in position 2, and cannot appear anywhere else (since it’s already placed there). Therefore, E cannot appear in position 4 or 5.

So the word must be R E A _ _ with letters not in {O, S, C, T, L, M} and no additional E.

Remaining letters for positions 4 and 5: N, D, P, B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, I, U.

Possible valid words:
- REAND (not a word)
- REAPD (not a word)
- REAVY (V and Y allowed)
- REAID (not a word)
- REABY (not a word)
- REAGY (not a word)
- REAPI (not a word)
- REAUK (not a word)
- REAVY (valid word, meaning heavy or of heavy weight)

“REAVY” is a valid word meaning heavy or of heavy weight. It uses:
- R (✓)
- E (✓)
- A (✓)
- V (new letter, not excluded)
- Y (new letter, not excluded)

This seems like the best next guess.

- The 4th letter is R but in the wrong position (it must NOT be R in position 4).
- Therefore, the 4th letter is NOT R.

2. Is not R (because R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 4)
3. Makes a valid 5-letter word R E A _ Y

Possible remaining consonants for position 4: N, D, P, B, G, H, K, W, F, etc.

- REAND – not valid
- REAPY – P is allowed, REAPY is valid (though obscure)
- REARY – already tried, R is invalid here
- REAWY – not valid
- REAXY – not valid
- REAZY – not valid
- REAYA – not valid
- REAZY – not valid

The only valid word left seems to be REAPY, but it's quite obscure. However, there's another valid word: REAKY (though K is allowed and REAKY is valid). Let me verify:

- REAKY: R E A K Y
  - K is not excluded
  - Fits pattern R E A _ Y
  - All letters confirmed or allowed

Therefore, REAKY is a better, more common word to try next.

<guess>REAKY</guess>",REAKY,"From the latest feedback on REARY:
- R(✓) E(✓) A(✓) R(-) Y(✓)

We now know:
- The exact pattern is R E A _ Y
- The 4th letter is R but in the wrong position (it must NOT be R in position 4).
- Therefore, the 4th letter is NOT R.

Letters already confirmed:
- R (positions 1 and 4 must be different)
- E (position 2)
- A (position 3)
- Y (position 5)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- O, S, C, T, L, M, V

We need a single letter for position 4 that:
1. Has not been excluded (so not O, S, C, T, L, M, V)
2. Is not R (because R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 4)
3. Makes a valid 5-letter word R E A _ Y
