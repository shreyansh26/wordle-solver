For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should cover as many of these as possible.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of high-frequency letters without repeating any letters, which helps narrow down possibilities efficiently.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A, R, O, S are all NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.
- Contains E somewhere other than the 5th position.

Good letters to try next: common consonants that haven’t been ruled out yet, like T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc. Also, since E is in the word but not in the last spot, we should place E in one of the first four positions.

A strong next word would use new common letters while incorporating E in a different spot. Let’s try “UNTIE”:
- U, N, T, I are all new letters.
- E is placed in the 4th position (not the 5th), satisfying the feedback that E is in the word but not at position 5.

This gives us maximum new information about four fresh letters while repositioning E.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should cover as many of these as possible.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of high-frequency letters without repeating any letters, which helps narrow down possibilities efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A, R, O, S are all NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.
- Contains E somewhere other than the 5th position.

Good letters to try next: common consonants that haven’t been ruled out yet, like T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc. Also, since E is in the word but not in the last spot, we should place E in one of the first four positions.

A strong next word would use new common letters while incorporating E in a different spot. Let’s try “UNTIE”:
- U, N, T, I are all new letters.
- E is placed in the 4th position (not the 5th), satisfying the feedback that E is in the word but not at position 5.

This gives us maximum new information about four fresh letters while repositioning E.

From the two guesses we have:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)

   – Confirms E is in the word but **not** in position 5.

2. untie → U(x) N(x) T(✓) I(x) E(-)  
   – Eliminates U, N, I.  
   – Confirms T is in the word **and** in position 3.  
   – Confirms E is in the word but **not** in position 5 (same as before).

So far we know:
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, S, U, N, I  
- Letters confirmed in the word: T (position 3), E (somewhere in positions 1–4)  
- Remaining common letters to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
- Keep T in position 3.  
- Place E in a new position (1, 2, or 4).  
- Introduce new common consonants.

Let’s try “THEME”:
- T is in position 3 (✓).  
- E is in positions 1 and 4 (new positions).  
- H and M are new letters to test.

This gives us information about H and M while repositioning E and confirming T.

Letters eliminated so far:

Letters confirmed in the word:

- T (must be in position 3, because only position 3 got ✓)

So the pattern is: _ E T _ _

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 5.  
Allowed letters (not yet eliminated): B, C, D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc.  
We want common consonants to maximize information.  
Good candidates: B, C, D, G, K, Y, etc.

Let’s pick a word that fits _ E T _ _ and uses two new common letters.  
A good choice is “BETSY”:
- B and S are new letters.
- E and T are already confirmed in positions 2 and 3.
- S is not yet eliminated.

But S was eliminated in guess 1.  
So we need two letters from the still-allowed set.

Try “CETYL”:

- G and Y are new.

This seems acceptable.

But let’s check if T can appear twice.  
The rules don’t forbid duplicates, so it’s possible.

“GETTY” fits _ E T _ _ and uses G and Y.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of high-frequency letters without repeating any letters, which helps narrow down possibilities efficiently.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A, R, O, S are all NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.
- Contains E somewhere other than the 5th position.

Good letters to try next: common consonants that haven’t been ruled out yet, like T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc. Also, since E is in the word but not in the last spot, we should place E in one of the first four positions.

A strong next word would use new common letters while incorporating E in a different spot. Let’s try “UNTIE”:
- U, N, T, I are all new letters.
- E is placed in the 4th position (not the 5th), satisfying the feedback that E is in the word but not at position 5.

This gives us maximum new information about four fresh letters while repositioning E.

- Keep T in position 3.  
- Place E in a new position (1, 2, or 4).  
- Introduce new common consonants.

Let’s try “THEME”:
- T is in position 3 (✓).  
- E is in positions 1 and 4 (new positions).  
- H and M are new letters to test.

This gives us information about H and M while repositioning E and confirming T.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters eliminated so far:
A, R, O, S, U, N, I, H, M

Letters confirmed in the word:
- T (must appear somewhere, but not in position 1 or 3)
- E (must appear somewhere, but not in positions 3 or 5)

Positions we know:
- Position 3 is NOT T (from theme feedback: T(-))
- Position 3 is NOT E (from theme feedback: E(-) at position 3)

So E must be in position 2 or 4.

Possible T positions: 2, 4, 5 (since 1 and 3 are ruled out)

Remaining common consonants not yet tested: B, C, D, F, G, L, P, Y, etc.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Keeps E in a new spot (position 2 or 4)
- Keeps T in a new spot (positions 2, 4, or 5)
- Introduces new common letters

A good candidate is “PETAL”:
- P and L are new letters.
- E is in position 2 (new spot).
- T is in position 4 (new spot).

This tests P, L, E, T while respecting the constraints.

Let’s update what we know after all four guesses.

Letters eliminated so far:
A, R, O, S, U, N, I, H, M, P, L

Letters confirmed in the word:
- E (must be in position 2, because only position 2 got ✓)
- T (must be in position 3, because only position 3 got ✓)

So the pattern is: _ E T _ _

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 5.  
Allowed letters (not yet eliminated): B, C, D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc.  
We want common consonants to maximize information.  
Good candidates: B, C, D, G, K, Y, etc.

Let’s pick a word that fits _ E T _ _ and uses two new common letters.  
A good choice is “BETSY”:
- B and S are new letters.
- E and T are already confirmed in positions 2 and 3.
- S is not yet eliminated.

But S was eliminated in guess 1.  
So we need two letters from the still-allowed set.

Let’s try “BETON”:
- O and N are eliminated.  
No good.

Try “CETYL”:
- L is eliminated.  
No good.

Try “GETTY”:
- T is already in position 3, but double T is allowed.  
- G and Y are new.

This seems acceptable.

But let’s check if T can appear twice.  
The rules don’t forbid duplicates, so it’s possible.

“GETTY” fits _ E T _ _ and uses G and Y.

Another option: “FETID”:
- I is eliminated.  
No good.

“VETCO”:
- O is eliminated.  
No good.

“YETID”:
- I is eliminated.  
No good.

“WETLY”:
- L is eliminated.  
No good.

“VETTA”:
- A is eliminated.  
No good.

“BETTY”:
- T is allowed twice.
- B and Y are new.

This seems good.

Between “GETTY” and “BETTY”, both fit.  
“BETTY” uses B and Y, both still allowed.

Let’s go with “BETTY”.

From all feedback so far:

- Eliminated letters: A, R, O, S, U, N, I, H, M, P, L, B
- Confirmed letters in exact positions:
  - Position 2: E
  - Position 3: T
  - Position 4: T
  - Position 5: Y

So the word pattern is: _ E T T Y

Only position 1 is unknown.  
Allowed letters for position 1 (not yet eliminated): C, D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with one of these and ends with ETTY.  
Common letters left: C, D, F, G, K, W

Checking possible first letters:
- C: “CETTY” – valid word (a type of hat or a name)
- D: “DETTY” – valid word (a name)
- F: “FETTY” – valid word (slang for “fatty”)
- G: “GETTY” – valid word (a name)
- K: “KETTY” – valid word (a name)
- W: “WETTY” – valid word (slang for “wetty”)

Among these, “CETTY” and “GETTY” are the most common English words.  
Between them, “CETTY” is more frequently used in word lists.

Let’s guess “CETTY”.
