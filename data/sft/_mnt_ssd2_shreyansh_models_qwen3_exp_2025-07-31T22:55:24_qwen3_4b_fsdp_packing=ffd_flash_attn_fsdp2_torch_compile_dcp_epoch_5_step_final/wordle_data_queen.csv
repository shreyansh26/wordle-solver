### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with several of these high-frequency letters to quickly identify which letters are present or absent.

A strong starting word would be ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good spread of common letters to test in different positions.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with several of these high-frequency letters to quickly identify which letters are present or absent.

A strong starting word would be ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good spread of common letters to test in different positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: x (not in the word at all)
- R: x (not in the word at all)
- O: x (not in the word at all)
- S: x (not in the word at all)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: A, R, O, S
- Letter definitely present: E (but not in the 5th position)

Next step: pick a word that:
1. Contains E in a position other than 5th
2. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no A, R, O, S)
3. Uses common remaining letters to maximize information

Good remaining common letters: T, N, L, I, C, D, U, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, Y, W, V, X, Z, Q, J.

A strong second guess would be ""UNTIE"" because:
- Uses E in the 4th position (not 5th, satisfying the feedback)
- Uses U, N, T, I which are common and not yet tested
- No forbidden letters (A, R, O, S)

Remaining common letters that are still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the confirmed letters E, U, N.

We need a word that:
- Contains E, U, N (each in a new position)

A good candidate is ""UNKEY"":
- U in position 1 (new position for U)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with several of these high-frequency letters to quickly identify which letters are present or absent.

A strong starting word would be ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good spread of common letters to test in different positions.

- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: A, R, O, S
- Letter definitely present: E (but not in the 5th position)

Next step: pick a word that:
1. Contains E in a position other than 5th
2. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no A, R, O, S)
3. Uses common remaining letters to maximize information

Good remaining common letters: T, N, L, I, C, D, U, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, Y, W, V, X, Z, Q, J.

A strong second guess would be ""UNTIE"" because:
- Uses E in the 4th position (not 5th, satisfying the feedback)
- Uses U, N, T, I which are common and not yet tested
- No forbidden letters (A, R, O, S)

This tests three confirmed letters in new positions and introduces two fresh letters (K, Y) to gather more information.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback so far:

Letters we know are NOT in the word:  
A, R, O, S, T, I, K, Y

Letters we know ARE in the word:  
E (and it’s in position 4)

Letters we know are in the word but whose positions are still unknown:  
U and N

So the secret word looks like: _ _ _ E _  
and must contain both U and N somewhere in the remaining four slots (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).

We have 25 letters still allowed (excluding A, R, O, S, T, I, K, Y).  
We want to test new common letters while respecting the constraints.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Places E in position 4 (confirmed)
- Places U and N in new positions (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5)
- Uses other allowed letters to gather more info

A good candidate is “UNFED”:
- U in position 1 (new position for U)
- N in position 2 (new position for N)
- F and D are allowed and common
- E is in position 4 (matches the known placement)

This tests three new letters (F, D) while repositioning U and N.

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word (x):  
A, R, O, S, T, I, K, Y, F, D

Letters IN the word (✓ or -) and their confirmed positions:  
E is locked in position 4.

Letters IN the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:  
U and N (both have received “-” feedback, meaning they are in the word but not in the positions they occupied so far).

Positions already ruled out for U:  
- Guess 1 (AROSE): U was in position 1 → U cannot be in position 1  
- Guess 2 (UNTIE): U was in position 1 → still cannot be in position 1  
- Guess 3 (UNKEY): U was in position 1 → still cannot be in position 1  
- Guess 4 (UNFED): U was in position 1 → still cannot be in position 1  

So U must be in positions 2, 3, or 5.

Positions already ruled out for N:  
- Guess 2 (UNTIE): N was in position 2 → N cannot be in position 2  
- Guess 3 (UNKEY): N was in position 2 → still cannot be in position 2  
- Guess 4 (UNFED): N was in position 2 → still cannot be in position 2  

So N must be in positions 1, 3, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has E in position 4
- Contains both U and N somewhere in the remaining slots (positions 1, 2, 3, 5)
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no A, R, O, S, T, I, K, Y, F, D)

Remaining common allowed letters: B, C, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Let’s try to place U and N in new positions and fill the rest with new common letters.

One possibility is “BUNGE”:
- B (new)
- U (position 2, new for U)
- N (position 3, new for N)
- G (new)
- E (position 4, confirmed)

This satisfies all constraints.

Let’s summarize the new information from Guess 5 (BUNGE):

- B(x) → B is not in the word  
- U(✓) → U is in position 2  
- N(-) → N is in the word but not in position 3  
- G(x) → G is not in the word  
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5 (it was already confirmed in position 4)

So far we know:
- E is fixed in position 4  
- U is fixed in position 2  
- N is somewhere in positions 1, 5 (since positions 2,3 are ruled out)  
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, T, I, K, Y, F, D, B, G  

We need a 5-letter word of the form: _ U _ E _  
with N appearing once in either position 1 or 5, and the remaining letters chosen only from the allowed set {C, H, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z} (and N itself).

Let’s list possible patterns:
1. N U _ E _  
2. _ U _ E N  

We’ll pick a word that uses fresh common letters and satisfies the constraints.  
Candidate: “NUCLE”  
- N in position 1  
- U in position 2  
- C, L, E (E is already placed)  
- Letters C, L are allowed.  

Check:  
N, U, C, L, E – none of the forbidden letters appear.  
This fits the pattern N U _ E _ and tests new letters C and L.

Thus, the next guess is NUCLE.
