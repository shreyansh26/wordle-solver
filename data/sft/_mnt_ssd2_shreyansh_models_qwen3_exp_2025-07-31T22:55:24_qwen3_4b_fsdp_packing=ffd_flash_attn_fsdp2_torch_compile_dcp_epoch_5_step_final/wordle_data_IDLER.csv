### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is a strong choice because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E). This will help me quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

A quick scan of common words fitting _ _ _ E R:
- D I E R (but I is allowed, and D is allowed) → DIER is a word (past participle of die).
- C H E R Y → but Y is allowed, but position 5 is R, so this would be C H E R Y → but that's 5 letters and ends in Y, not R. Wait, we need _ _ _ E R.
- C H E E R → but E is already in position 4, and we can't have another E in position 3 because that would be two E's and we don't know if that's allowed. Also, C, H, E, E, R would have E in position 3 and 4, but we don't know if duplicates are allowed.
- B I G E R → B, I, G are allowed, E is in position 4, R in position 5. This seems valid.
- C L E R K → but K is allowed, but position 5 is R, so this would be C L E R K → but ends in K, not R. Not valid.
- F I G E R → F, I, G are allowed, E in 4, R in 5. This seems valid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

   - E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

2. ENTER → E(-) N(x) T(x) E(✓) R(✓)
   - N and T are NOT in the word.
   - E is in the word and is in position 4.
   - R is in the word and is in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters in the word: E (position 4), R (position 5).
- Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S, N, T.
- Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- Positions 1, 2, 3 are still unknown.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has E in position 4 and R in position 5.
- Uses only letters from the allowed set.
- Avoids any of the ruled-out letters.

Possible patterns: _ _ _ E R

Let's think of common letters for positions 1-3. Good candidates: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

A quick scan of common words fitting _ _ _ E R:
- D I E R (but I is allowed, and D is allowed) → DIER is a word (past participle of die).
- C H E R Y → but Y is allowed, but position 5 is R, so this would be C H E R Y → but that's 5 letters and ends in Y, not R. Wait, we need _ _ _ E R.
- C H E E R → but E is already in position 4, and we can't have another E in position 3 because that would be two E's and we don't know if that's allowed. Also, C, H, E, E, R would have E in position 3 and 4, but we don't know if duplicates are allowed.
- B I G E R → B, I, G are allowed, E is in position 4, R in position 5. This seems valid.
- C L E R K → but K is allowed, but position 5 is R, so this would be C L E R K → but ends in K, not R. Not valid.
- F I G E R → F, I, G are allowed, E in 4, R in 5. This seems valid.
- B U G E R → B, U, G are allowed, E in 4, R in 5. This seems valid.

Among these, ""BIGER"" isn't a common word. ""FIGER"" isn't a word. ""BUGER"" isn't a word. ""CHER"" is 4 letters. ""CHERRY"" is 6 letters. 

Looking at common words: ""CHER"" is 4 letters. ""CIDER"" has I and D allowed, but ends in R. Let me check ""CIDER"":
- C, I, D, E, R → positions: C (1), I (2), D (3), E (4), R (5). This fits all constraints:
  - E is in position 4 (✓)
  - R is in position 5 (✓)
  - Letters used: C, I, D are allowed.
  - No ruled-out letters (A, O, S, N, T are absent).

""CIDER"" seems like a good next guess.

Let's summarize what we now know after the three guesses.

Letters in the word:
- E is in position 4 (from both Guess 2 and Guess 3)
- R is in position 5 (from both Guess 2 and Guess 3)

Letters NOT in the word:
A, O, S, N, T, C

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions we still need to determine:
I (from Guess 3 feedback I(-) - it is in the word but not in position 2)
D (from Guess 3 feedback D(-) - it is in the word but not in position 3)

So the word has the form:
_ _ _ E R
and must contain both I and D somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3, but:
- I cannot be in position 2
- D cannot be in position 3

Possible positions for I and D:
I can be in positions 1 or 3
D can be in positions 1 or 2

Let's list the possible combinations:

Case 1: I in position 1
Then D must be in position 2
Word: I D _ E R → need a letter for position 3 that is allowed (not A,O,S,N,T,C)
Allowed letters for position 3: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
We need a common letter here. Let's try common ones first:
- I D B E R → ""IDBER"" - not a word
- I D G E R → ""IDGER"" - not a word
- I D L E R → ""IDLER"" - this is a valid word (someone who idles)
- I D M E R → ""IDMER"" - not a word
- I D P E R → ""IDPER"" - not a word

Case 2: I in position 3
Then D must be in position 1 or 2
Subcase 2a: D in position 1
Word: D _ I E R → need a letter for position 2 (not A,O,S,N,T,C)
Allowed letters for position 2: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible common letters:
- D B I E R → ""DBIER"" - not a word
- D F I E R → ""DFIER"" - not a word
- D G I E R → ""DGIER"" - not a word
- D H I E R → ""DHIER"" - not a word
- D K I E R → ""DKIER"" - not a word
- D L I E R → ""DLIER"" - not a word
- D M I E R → ""DMIER"" - not a word
- D P I E R → ""DPIER"" - not a word

Subcase 2b: D in position 2
Word: _ D I E R → need a letter for position 1 (not A,O,S,N,T,C)
Allowed letters for position 1: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible common letters:
- B D I E R → ""BDIER"" - not a word
- F D I E R → ""FDIER"" - not a word
- G D I E R → ""GDIER"" - not a word
- H D I E R → ""HDIER"" - not a word
- J D I E R → ""JDIER"" - not a word
- K D I E R → ""KDIER"" - not a word
- L D I E R → ""LDIER"" - not a word
- M D I E R → ""MDIER"" - not a word
- P D I E R → ""PDIER"" - not a word

The only valid word we found in Case 1 is ""IDLER"". Let's check if ""IDLER"" is a valid 5-letter word - yes, it is.

Therefore, ""IDLER"" is the next logical guess.
