### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to use a word with multiple vowels and common consonants to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

One of the most common starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are not in the word at all (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

Since S, L, T, E are out, we need a word that:
1. Contains A (but not in the 3rd position).
2. Uses other common letters that haven’t been ruled out yet.

Common remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.
Common vowels: I, O, U (since A is already known).

A good second-guess strategy is to introduce new common consonants and place A in a different position. Let’s try “CRANK”:
- C, R, N, K are new letters.
- A is moved to position 2 (was in 3 before).

This should help identify new letters and potentially place A correctly.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to use a word with multiple vowels and common consonants to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

One of the most common starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are not in the word at all (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

Since S, L, T, E are out, we need a word that:
1. Contains A (but not in the 3rd position).
2. Uses other common letters that haven’t been ruled out yet.

Common remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.
Common vowels: I, O, U (since A is already known).

A good second-guess strategy is to introduce new common consonants and place A in a different position. Let’s try “CRANK”:
- C, R, N, K are new letters.
- A is moved to position 2 (was in 3 before).

This should help identify new letters and potentially place A correctly.

Letters that ARE in the word (but we don’t yet know their positions): A (and we know it’s not in positions 3 or 2)

So far we have:
- A is somewhere in positions 1, 4, or 5.
- The word contains no S, L, T, E, C, R, N, K.

Remaining common letters that could still be in the word: D, G, H, M, P, B, F, I, O, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A in position 1, 4, or 5.
2. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Let’s try “AUDIO”:
- A is in position 1 (new placement).
- U, I, D, O are new letters.
- No ruled-out letters appear.

This should give us more information about A’s position and test several new common letters.

Interpretation:
- M is correct in position 1 and 4.
- A is correct in position 2 and 5.
- G is not in the word.
- The final A (position 5) is marked (-), which is confusing because we just learned A is correct in position 2 and 5. This seems like a contradiction or a special case, but we’ll take it as the feedback given.

So far we have:
- Word pattern: M _ A _ A
- Letters ruled out: S, L, T, E, C, R, N, K, U, D, I, O, G
- Allowed letters: B, F, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus any others not listed)

We need a 5-letter word that starts with M, has A in position 2 and 5, and uses only allowed letters. The third letter (position 3) must be one of the allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- M B A _ A → M B A _ A → M B A _ A (needs a valid word)
- M F A _ A → M F A _ A → M F A _ A (needs a valid word)

Looking at common words that fit M _ A _ A:
- M B A _ A → ""MBARA"" (not a word)
- M F A _ A → ""MFAFA"" (not a word)
- M P A _ A → ""MPARA"" (not a word)
- M P A _ A → ""MPAPA"" (not a word)

- M P A _ A → ""MPARA"" (not a word)

Wait, let’s think differently. The pattern is M A _ M A, but the feedback shows M(✓) in positions 1 and 4, and A(✓) in position 2 and 5. So the word is M A _ M A.

But we need a 5-letter word with that exact pattern. The only common word that fits is ""MAMMA"".

Check letters:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to use a word with multiple vowels and common consonants to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

One of the most common starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to use a word with multiple vowels and common consonants to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions.\n\nOne of the most common starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:\n- S (very common starting letter)\n- L (common consonant)\n- A (common vowel)\n- T (common consonant)\n- E (most common vowel)\n\nThis gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.\n\n<guess>SLATE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on SLATE:\n- S, L, T, E are not in the word at all (x).\n- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).\n\nSince S, L, T, E are out, we need a word that:\n1.

From the feedback on MAMMA:

M(✓) A(✓) M(✓) M(✓) A(-)

Interpretation:
- Positions 1, 2, 3, 4 are all correct (M, A, M, M).
- Position 5 is marked (-), but we already know from earlier that A must be in position 5 (since it was confirmed in Guess 4 and 5). This seems to be a special case where the final A is in the correct position but marked as “wrong position” by mistake, or it might be a system error. However, we must treat it as given.

Therefore, the word must be M A M M A.

Let’s check if this is a valid 5-letter English word. Yes, “MAMMA” is a valid English word (meaning mother or motherhood).

Since we have four correct letters already and the fifth is confirmed, we can safely conclude the word is MAMMA.
