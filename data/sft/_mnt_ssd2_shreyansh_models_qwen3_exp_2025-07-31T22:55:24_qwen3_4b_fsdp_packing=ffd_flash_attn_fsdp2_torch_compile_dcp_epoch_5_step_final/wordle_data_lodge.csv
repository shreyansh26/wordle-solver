### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, like vowels and common consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should give us good coverage of common letters and positions to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, like vowels and common consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should give us good coverage of common letters and positions to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: not in the word (x)
- L: in the word but wrong position (-)
- A: not in the word (x)
- T: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word and in the correct position (✓)

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains L somewhere in positions 2-4.
3. It does NOT contain S, A, or T.

To maximize information, I want a word that:
- keeps E in position 5
- moves L to a new position (2-4)
- avoids S, A, T
- introduces new common letters

Possible candidates: 
- BLEND (but has N and D which are less common)
- PLUME (but P and U are less common)
- GLEAM (but A is excluded)
- CLEFT (but T is excluded)
- BLEED (but E is already in position 5)

A better choice is ""BLEND"" because:
- B, L, N, D are common letters
- L is now in position 2 (new position)
- E is kept in position 5
- Avoids S, A, T

Guess 2: BLEND -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(-) E(-) N(x) D(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s summarize what we now know:

1. Position 5 = E (from SLATE feedback).
2. L is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from BLEND feedback: L(-) in position 2 and (-) again in position 3).  
   So L must be in position 1 or 4.
3. Letters NOT in the word: S, A, T, B, N, D.
4. Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: L, E (already fixed at position 5), and possibly others.

We need a word that:
- Ends with E.
- Contains L in position 1 or 4.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no S, A, T, B, N, D).
- Introduces new common letters to maximize information.

Candidate words:
- CLEFT – but T is excluded.
- GLEAM – A is excluded.
- FLUME – F, U, M are still allowed, and L is in position 2 (but position 2 was already ruled out for L), so this is invalid.
- CLIME – C, L, I, M, E. L is in position 2 (again invalid for L).
- FLICK – C, K are allowed, but L is in position 2 (invalid).
- CLEVE – C, L, E, V, E. L is in position 2 (invalid).
- GLEAM – A excluded.
- LIEVE – L in position 1, I, E, V, E. All letters allowed, and L is in position 1 (valid).

“LIEVE” satisfies all constraints:
- Ends with E.
- L in position 1 (new position).
- No forbidden letters (S, A, T, B, N, D).
- Introduces I and V to test new common letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, like vowels and common consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should give us good coverage of common letters and positions to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: not in the word (x)
- L: in the word but wrong position (-)
- A: not in the word (x)
- T: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word and in the correct position (✓)

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains L somewhere in positions 2-4.
3. It does NOT contain S, A, or T.

To maximize information, I want a word that:
- keeps E in position 5
- moves L to a new position (2-4)
- avoids S, A, T
- introduces new common letters

Possible candidates: 
- BLEND (but has N and D which are less common)
- PLUME (but P and U are less common)
- GLEAM (but A is excluded)
- CLEFT (but T is excluded)
- BLEED (but E is already in position 5)

A better choice is ""BLEND"" because:
- B, L, N, D are common letters
- L is now in position 2 (new position)
- E is kept in position 5
- Avoids S, A, T

Guess 2: BLEND -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(-) E(-) N(x) D(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s summarize what we now know:

1. Position 5 = E (from SLATE feedback).
2. L is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from BLEND feedback: L(-) in position 2 and (-) again in position 3).  
   So L must be in position 1 or 4.
3. Letters NOT in the word: S, A, T, B, N, D.
4. Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: L, E (already fixed at position 5), and possibly others.

We need a word that:
- Ends with E.
- Contains L in position 1 or 4.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no S, A, T, B, N, D).
- Introduces new common letters to maximize information.

Candidate words:
- CLEFT – but T is excluded.
- GLEAM – A is excluded.
- FLUME – F, U, M are still allowed, and L is in position 2 (but position 2 was already ruled out for L), so this is invalid.
- CLIME – C, L, I, M, E. L is in position 2 (again invalid for L).
- FLICK – C, K are allowed, but L is in position 2 (invalid).
- CLEVE – C, L, E, V, E. L is in position 2 (invalid).
- GLEAM – A excluded.
- LIEVE – L in position 1, I, E, V, E. All letters allowed, and L is in position 1 (valid).

“LIEVE” satisfies all constraints:
- Ends with E.
- L in position 1 (new position).
- No forbidden letters (S, A, T, B, N, D).
- Introduces I and V to test new common letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: BLEND -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(-) E(-) N(x) D(-)
Guess 3: LIEVE -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) I(x) E(-) V(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on LIEVE:
- L is now confirmed in position 1 (✓).
- E is confirmed in position 5 (✓).
- I is NOT in the word (x).
- V is NOT in the word (x).
- The second E in position 4 is marked (-), which means E is in the word but NOT in position 4. However, we already know E is in position 5, so this just confirms the single E at position 5.

So far we know:
- Word structure: L _ _ _ E
- Letters NOT in the word: S, A, T, B, N, D, I, V
- Letters still allowed (and still present): L (position 1), E (position 5)
- We need to fill positions 2, 3, 4 with letters from the remaining alphabet, avoiding the banned letters.

Remaining common letters that haven’t been ruled out: C, F, G, H, K, M, P, R, U, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with L, ends with E, and uses only allowed letters. Let’s brainstorm:
- L _ _ _ E
  - LUMEN (but N is banned)
  - LUGES (S is banned)
  - LUMPE (P is allowed, but U, M are allowed)
  - LUGES – S banned
  - LUMEN – N banned
  - LUMPE – P is allowed, but U and M are allowed; however, P is allowed and hasn’t been tested yet.
  - LUMPE seems valid: L U M P E – but P is allowed, U is allowed, M is allowed.

Another candidate: LUMEN – N banned.

Another: LUMPE – seems valid.

Another: LUGES – S banned.

Another: LUMPE seems the best so far.

Let’s check LUMPE:
- L: position 1 (✓)
- U: allowed
- M: allowed
- P: allowed
- E: position 5 (✓)
- No banned letters.

Thus, LUMPE is a valid next guess.

- L _ _ _ E
  - L C H E E → but double E is possible, but we don’t know yet.
  - L C H E E → but E is already in position 5, so this would be L C H E E, which is valid if double E is allowed.
