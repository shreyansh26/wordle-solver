### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess should ideally have a mix of these letters to quickly identify which ones are in the word and their positions.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common letter)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good spread of common letters that can quickly help narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: not in the word (x)
- L: in the word but wrong position (-)
- A: in the correct position (✓) – so A is the 3rd letter
- T: not in the word (x)
- E: not in the word (x)

So the word looks like: _ _ A _ _

Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, T, E  
Letters we know ARE in the word (but positions unknown): L (somewhere except position 2), and A (fixed in position 3)

Next guess should:
1. Keep A in position 3.
2. Try new letters to test other common ones.
3. Place L in a different position than 2 (so 1, 3, 4, or 5).
4. Avoid S, T, E.

Good candidates: CRANK, FLANK, GLAND, PLANK, PRANK, etc.

Let’s pick CRANK:
- C: new letter
- R: new letter
- A: correct position
- N: new letter
- K: new letter
- Places L in position 4 (different from 2)
- Avoids S, T, E

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
   - A is fixed in position 3.
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 2.
   - S, T, E are NOT in the word.

2. CRANK → C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) K(x)
   - C is in position 1.
   - R is in position 2.
   - A is in position 3 (confirmed again).
   - N and K are NOT in the word.

So the pattern so far is:
C R A _ _

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out): all except S, T, E, N, K.

We still need to place L somewhere in the remaining two positions (4 or 5), and we need two more letters that are not yet excluded.

Possible candidates:
- CRAIL (but I is allowed, L is allowed)
- CRAUL (but U is allowed, L is allowed)
- CRAML (but M is allowed, L is allowed)
- CRAVL (but V is allowed, L is allowed)
- CRAWL (W is allowed, L is allowed)

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit CRA _ _ with L in position 4 or 5:
