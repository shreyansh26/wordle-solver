For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good starting word often includes vowels and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N, etc. 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common ending letter)
- E (most common vowel in English)

This combination maximizes the chance of getting hits on common letters and provides good coverage for different positions.

Current constraints:

2. Letters NOT in the word: L, A, E, P, O, R
3. Letter T is in the word but NOT in position 4 (from SPORT feedback).  
   However, we already know T is in position 4 (from SLATE feedback).  
   This seems contradictory—let me re-read the feedback carefully.

SPORT feedback: S(✓) P(x) O(x) R(x) T(-)  
- ✓ means S is correct in position 1.  
- (-) means T is in the word but NOT in position 5.  
- From SLATE we already know T is in position 4 (✓).  
  Therefore, the word is S _ _ T _ with T fixed in position 4, and the final letter is NOT T.

So the word structure is: S _ _ T _

Letters still allowed: all except L, A, E, P, O, R  
Remaining common consonants: N, C, D, G, H, M, B, F, K, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I, U

I need a 5-letter word that fits S _ _ T _ with the above constraints.  
Candidate words:  
- SCINT (but I is a vowel, N is consonant, C is consonant) – but SCINT isn’t valid.  
- SHIRT – but R is excluded.  
- SKINT – but N is allowed, K is allowed, I is allowed.  
- SINTH – not a word.  
- SPLIT – P is excluded.  
- STINT – T is excluded from position 5, but this would be S T I N T – T is already in position 4, so duplicate T is possible?  
  However, STINT would be S T I N T – but position 2 is T, which conflicts with our pattern S _ _ T _.  
  So STINT doesn’t fit.

Another candidate: SKINT  
- S ✓, K new, I new, N new, T ✓.  
  Pattern: S K I N T – but T is in position 5, which conflicts with our known T in position 4.  
  So SKINT is invalid.

Another candidate: SINTH – not a word.  
Another: SINGT – not a word.  
Another: SITNT – not a word.

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words that start with S, have T in position 4, and no L, A, E, P, O, R.

Possible words:  
- S C I T Y – but Y is allowed, and C, I, Y are new.  
  Pattern: S C I T Y – T is in position 4, Y is new.  
  This seems valid.

- S C U T T – but T is already in position 4, and we can’t have duplicate T unless allowed, but we don’t know.  
  Also, C, U are new.

- S H I T S – but H, I, S are new, but S is already in position 1, and we can have duplicate S?  
  However, S is already confirmed in position 1, and the word can have other S’s.

SCITY is not a word.

- A (common vowel)
- T (common ending letter)
- E (most common vowel in English)

Letters still allowed: all except L, A, E, P, O, R  
Remaining common consonants: N, C, D, G, H, M, B, F, K, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I, U

I need a 5-letter word that fits S _ _ T _ with the above constraints.  
Candidate words:  
- SCINT (but I is a vowel, N is consonant, C is consonant) – but SCINT isn’t valid.  
- SHIRT – but R is excluded.  
- SKINT – but N is allowed, K is allowed, I is allowed.  
- SINTH – not a word.  
- SPLIT – P is excluded.  
- STINT – T is excluded from position 5, but this would be S T I N T – T is already in position 4, so duplicate T is possible?  
  However, STINT would be S T I N T – but position 2 is T, which conflicts with our pattern S _ _ T _.  
  So STINT doesn’t fit.

Another candidate: SKINT  
- S ✓, K new, I new, N new, T ✓.  
  Pattern: S K I N T – but T is in position 5, which conflicts with our known T in position 4.  
  So SKINT is invalid.

Another candidate: SINTH – not a word.  
Another: SINGT – not a word.  
Another: SITNT – not a word.

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words that start with S, have T in position 4, and no L, A, E, P, O, R.

Possible words:  
- S C I T Y – but Y is allowed, and C, I, Y are new.  
  Pattern: S C I T Y – T is in position 4, Y is new.  
  This seems valid.

- S C U T T – but T is already in position 4, and we can’t have duplicate T unless allowed, but we don’t know.  
  Also, C, U are new.

- S H I T S – but H, I, S are new, but S is already in position 1, and we can have duplicate S?  
  However, S is already confirmed in position 1, and the word can have other S’s.

But let’s pick the most common letters first.  
SCITY is not a word.  
S C I T Y – no, that’s not a word.  
S C U T T – not common.  
S H I T S – valid word, but S is repeated.  
S H I T S – pattern: S H I T S – T is in position 4, S in position 5.  
But we have no restriction against duplicate letters.

Another candidate: S M I T H – but H is allowed, M is allowed, I is allowed.  
Pattern: S M I T H – T is in position 4, H is new.  
This is a valid word.

Let’s go with SMITH:
- S ✓, M new, I new, T ✓, H new.  
  Pattern: S M I T H – T is in position 4, H is new, no forbidden letters.Based on the feedback so far:
- S and T are locked in positions 1 and 4 respectively.
- Forbidden letters: L, A, E, P, O, R.
- The word must be S _ _ T _.

A good next guess is SMITH, which tests new consonants (M) and vowels (I) while keeping S and T fixed.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good starting word often includes vowels and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N, etc. 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common ending letter)
- E (most common vowel in English)

This combination maximizes the chance of getting hits on common letters and provides good coverage for different positions.

<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1.
- T is correct in position 4.
- L, A, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word looks like: S _ _ T _  
and must NOT contain L, A, or E.

Next, I want a word that keeps S and T in their correct spots and introduces new common letters. Good consonants to test next are R, N, C, H, M, P, etc. Good vowels to test are I, O, U (since A and E are out).

A good candidate is ""SPORT"":
- S stays in position 1.
- P is new and common.
- O is new and a vowel.
- R is new and common.
- T stays in position 4.

This tests P, O, R while keeping S and T fixed.

Current constraints:
1. Word pattern: S _ _ T I   (positions 1, 4, 5 are locked)
2. Letters NOT in the word: L, A, E, P, O, R, M, H, C, U
3. From SCUTI feedback:
   - U is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   - However, U is already excluded from position 3 (because we know U is in the word but not in position 3, and positions 1,4,5 are locked).  
   This implies U must be in position 2 or 3.  
   But positions 1,4,5 are locked, so U must be in position 2.

Thus the word must be S U _ T I.

Letters still allowed (excluding the banned list):  
Consonants left: N, D, G, B, F, K, etc.  
Vowels left: none (A, E, O, U are excluded, I is already in position 5).

We need a 5-letter word of the form S U _ T I.

Candidate words:
- S U N T I – not a word.
- S U D T I – not a word.
- S U G T I – not a word.
- S U B T I – not a word.
- S U F T I – not a word.
- S U K T I – not a word.

Looking at valid English words of the form S U _ T I:
- S U I T I – not valid.
- S U N T I – invalid.
- S U B T I – invalid.

Wait, let me think differently: maybe I misinterpreted the feedback.  
From SCUTI: S(✓) C(x) U(x) T(✓) I(-)  
- This means:  
  - S is correct in position 1.  
  - C is not in the word.  
  - U is not in the word (contradiction with earlier feedback where I was in the word but not in position 3).  
  - T is correct in position 4.  
  - I is in the word but not in position 5.  

This suggests that I is in the word but not in position 5, and U is not in the word.  
Therefore, the word pattern is S _ _ T _ with I somewhere in positions 2 or 3.  

Re-evaluate:
1. Word pattern: S _ _ T _  
2. Letters NOT in the word: L, A, E, P, O, R, M, H, C, U  
3. From SMITH feedback: I is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   Therefore, I must be in position 2.  
   So the word must be S I _ T _.  

Letters still allowed: N, D, G, B, F, K, etc.  
We need a 5-letter word of the form S I _ T _.

Candidate words:
- S I N T _ – need a 5-letter word ending in T.  
  S I N T H – H is banned.  
  S I N T S – S is allowed, but is SINTS a word? No.  
  S I N T A – A is banned.

- S I G T _ – not matching S I _ T _.  

- S I V E T – E is banned.  
- S I V E T – no.  

Wait, let me list valid 5-letter words of the form S I _ T _:
- S I X T _ – X is allowed, but we need 5 letters.  
  S I X T E – E is banned.  
  S I X T Y – Y is allowed.  
  S I X T Y – pattern: S I X T Y – but T is supposed to be in position 4, so S I X T Y would have T in position 4 and Y in position 5.  
  This fits S I X T Y – letters: S, I, X, T, Y.  
  Check banned list: X and Y are not banned.  

This seems valid.

Another candidate: S I V T _ – no word.  
S I V E T – E banned.  
S I V Y T – no.  

Thus, the most promising word is S I X T Y.

But let me verify:
- S I X T Y:  
  S (✓), I (new), X (new), T (✓), Y (new).  
  Pattern: S I X T Y – positions 1,4,5: S, T, Y.  
  I is in position 2, which is allowed (not position 3).  
  No banned letters.  

This seems to fit all constraints.
