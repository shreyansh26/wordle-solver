For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. Common starting letters include S, T, R, N, L, etc., while common vowels are A, E, I, O, U. A good balance is to use a word with common consonants and vowels.

A popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common letter)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to test against the secret word.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) were marked “x”, meaning none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
So we can safely eliminate every word that contains S, L, A, T, or E.

To maximize information, we want a new 5-letter word that uses entirely different letters, preferably common ones.  
Good candidates avoid the eliminated letters and include other high-frequency consonants and vowels.  
Popular remaining consonants: R, N, C, H, M, D, B, G, P, F  
Remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are gone)

A balanced choice is “CRIMP”:
- C, R, I, M, P are all still possible.
- It tests the common letters C, R, M, P, plus the vowel I.

This should give us useful feedback on new letters and help narrow down the remaining possibilities.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

- Eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, M, P  
- Confirmed letters: I is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in the 3rd spot in CRIMP and is now marked “-”).

1. Contain the letter I somewhere other than position 3.
2. Use only letters not yet eliminated: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus I).

We still need to test several common consonants and the remaining vowels (O, U).  
Good candidates should include:
- High-frequency consonants: N, D, B, G, H
- The remaining vowel O or U

A word that fits these constraints and tests new letters is “HOUND”:
- H, O, U, N, D are all still possible.
- I is not used, but we already know it must appear somewhere, so this guess will still be informative.

- I cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 → I must be in position 4 or 5.
- N cannot be in position 4 → N must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Available letters (not yet eliminated): B, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus I and N.

We still need to test several common consonants and the remaining vowel (none left except I, which we know is present).

A good next guess should:
- Include both I and N in allowed positions.
- Use other high-frequency remaining letters (B, F, G, K, V, W, etc.).

Let’s try “FINKY”:
- F, I, N, K, Y are all still possible.
- I is in position 2 (allowed, since I can be in 2).
- N is in position 3 (allowed, since N can be in 3).
- This tests new letters F, K, Y while confirming I and N.

However, we should also consider that I must be in 4 or 5. Let’s instead try “BINGO” but O is eliminated. Next option: “WINGY” – W, I, N, G, Y. This also places I in 2 (allowed) and N in 3 (allowed).

But we can do better by ensuring I is in 4 or 5. Let’s try “FINGY” – F, I, N, G, Y. I is in 2 (allowed), N in 3 (allowed). This still tests F, G, Y.

Actually, let’s try “FINKY” again – F, I, N, K, Y. I in 2 (allowed), N in 3 (allowed). This seems good.

But to maximize new information, let’s try “FINGY” or “WINGY”. Let’s choose “FINGY”:

- F, I, N, G, Y
- I in 2 (allowed)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- Tests new letters F, G, Y.

This seems optimal.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. Common starting letters include S, T, R, N, L, etc., while common vowels are A, E, I, O, U. A good balance is to use a word with common consonants and vowels.

A popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common letter)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to test against the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) were marked “x”, meaning none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
So we can safely eliminate every word that contains S, L, A, T, or E.

To maximize information, we want a new 5-letter word that uses entirely different letters, preferably common ones.  
Good candidates avoid the eliminated letters and include other high-frequency consonants and vowels.  
Popular remaining consonants: R, N, C, H, M, D, B, G, P, F  
Remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are gone)

A balanced choice is “CRIMP”:
- C, R, I, M, P are all still possible.
- It tests the common letters C, R, M, P, plus the vowel I.

This should give us useful feedback on new letters and help narrow down the remaining possibilities.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

- Eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, M, P  
- Confirmed letters: I is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in the 3rd spot in CRIMP and is now marked “-”).

So the secret word must:
1. Contain the letter I somewhere other than position 3.
2. Use only letters not yet eliminated: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus I).

We still need to test several common consonants and the remaining vowels (O, U).  
Good candidates should include:
- High-frequency consonants: N, D, B, G, H
- The remaining vowel O or U

A word that fits these constraints and tests new letters is “HOUND”:
- H, O, U, N, D are all still possible.
- I is not used, but we already know it must appear somewhere, so this guess will still be informative.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. Common starting letters include S, T, R, N, L, etc., while common vowels are A, E, I, O, U. A good balance is to use a word with common consonants and vowels.

A popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common letter)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to test against the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) were marked “x”, meaning none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
So we can safely eliminate every word that contains S, L, A, T, or E.

To maximize information, we want a new 5-letter word that uses entirely different letters, preferably common ones.  
Good candidates avoid the eliminated letters and include other high-frequency consonants and vowels.  
Popular remaining consonants: R, N, C, H, M, D, B, G, P, F  
Remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are gone)

A balanced choice is “CRIMP”:
- C, R, I, M, P are all still possible.
- It tests the common letters C, R, M, P, plus the vowel I.

This should give us useful feedback on new letters and help narrow down the remaining possibilities.

- Eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, M, P  
- Confirmed letters: I is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in the 3rd spot in CRIMP and is now marked “-”).

So the secret word must:
1. Contain the letter I somewhere other than position 3.
2. Use only letters not yet eliminated: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus I).

A word that fits these constraints and tests new letters is “HOUND”:

Let’s summarize what we now know:

1. Eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, M, P, H, O, U, D  
2. Confirmed letters:
   - I is in the word, but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 (because it was marked “-” in positions 3 and 1 respectively).  
   - N is in the word but not in position 4 (it was marked “-” there).

So the word must contain both I and N, and we know:
- I cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 → I must be in position 4 or 5.
- N cannot be in position 4 → N must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Available letters (not yet eliminated): B, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus I and N.

We still need to test several common consonants and the remaining vowel (none left except I, which we know is present).

A good next guess should:
- Include both I and N in allowed positions.
- Use other high-frequency remaining letters (B, F, G, K, V, W, etc.).

Let’s try “FINKY”:
- F, I, N, K, Y are all still possible.
- I is in position 2 (allowed, since I can be in 2).
- N is in position 3 (allowed, since N can be in 3).
- This tests new letters F, K, Y while confirming I and N.

However, we should also consider that I must be in 4 or 5. Let’s instead try “BINGO” but O is eliminated. Next option: “WINGY” – W, I, N, G, Y. This also places I in 2 (allowed) and N in 3 (allowed).

But we can do better by ensuring I is in 4 or 5. Let’s try “FINGY” – F, I, N, G, Y. I is in 2 (allowed), N in 3 (allowed). This still tests F, G, Y.

Actually, let’s try “FINKY” again – F, I, N, K, Y. I in 2 (allowed), N in 3 (allowed). This seems good.

But to maximize new information, let’s try “FINGY” or “WINGY”. Let’s choose “FINGY”:

- F, I, N, G, Y
- I in 2 (allowed)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- Tests new letters F, G, Y.

This seems optimal.

From the new feedback:

- F, G are eliminated.
- I is now correct in position 2 (✓).
- N is now correct in position 3 (✓).
- Y is correct in position 5 (✓).

So the pattern so far is: _ I N _ Y

Letters still allowed (not yet eliminated): B, D, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z plus the already confirmed I, N, Y.

We need to fill positions 1 and 4 with letters from the remaining set. Common consonants left include B, D, J, K, V, W.

Let’s look for 5-letter words that fit the pattern _ I N _ Y.

Possible candidates:
- B I N D Y → B, N, D, Y are allowed.
- J I N G Y → G is eliminated.
- K I N D Y → K, N, D, Y are allowed.
- V I N D Y → V, N, D, Y are allowed.
- W I N D Y → W, N, D, Y are allowed.

Among these, ""BINDY"" uses B, N, D, Y which are all still allowed, and it’s a valid word. This seems like the most promising next guess.
