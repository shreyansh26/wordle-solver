### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. A good starting word often contains vowels and frequently used consonants. Common choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE has S, L, A, T, E (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE has C, R, A, N, E (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- AROSE has A, R, O, S, E (covers A, R, O, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), giving me good coverage of possible letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(-): O is in the word but in the wrong position (not 3rd).
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.
- E(-): E is in the word but in the wrong position (not 5th).

So we know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: R, S
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, O, E (each must move to a different position)

We need a 5-letter word that contains A, O, E and excludes R and S, with each of those letters not in the positions they occupied in AROSE (1st for A, 3rd for O, 5th for E).

Possible positions:
- A cannot be 1st
- O cannot be 3rd
- E cannot be 5th

Let me think of words that fit these constraints and still contain A, O, E.

One such word is ""EAGLE"":
- Letters: E, A, G, L, E
- Contains A, O? No, O is missing. So this doesn't work.

Another word: ""EVOKE"":
- Contains E, V, O, K, E
- Contains O and E, but A is missing. Not good.

How about ""OCEAN"":
- Contains O, C, E, A, N
- Contains A, O, E
- Check positions:
  - A is 4th (originally 1st) – okay
  - O is 1st (originally 3rd) – okay
  - E is 3rd (originally 5th) – okay
- No R or S – good
- All letters are valid

This seems to fit all constraints.

2. The letters that ARE in the word: O, E, A (and A cannot be 4th)
3. The letters that ARE NOT in the word: R, S, C, N
4. We still need two more letters (positions 2 and 5) that are not R, S, C, N, and must be chosen from the remaining alphabet.

Possible letters left (excluding R, S, C, N): A, B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know A must appear somewhere (from the feedback), but cannot be 4th. So A must be in position 2 or 5.

Let’s try to form a word that fits O _ E _ _ with A in position 2 or 5.

Option 1: A in position 2 → O A E _ _
We need a letter for position 5. Let’s pick a common consonant. Possible choices: D, L, T, M, etc.

- O A E D _ → but we need a 5-letter word. ""OAE"" is not a common start. Maybe ""OAE"" + something? Not many words fit here.

Option 2: A in position 5 → O _ E _ A
We need a letter for position 2. Let’s try common consonants: B, D, L, M, P, T, etc.

- O B E _ A → ""OB"" is common, but ""OBE"" + ? → ""OBE"" + ""TA"" → ""OBETA""? Not a valid word.
- O D E _ A → ""ODE"" + ? → ""ODEMA""? No.
- O L E _ A → ""OLE"" + ? → ""OLEMA""? No.
- O P E _ A → ""OPE"" + ? → ""OPERA""? That’s 5 letters: O P E R A. But R is NOT in the word (from earlier feedback). So ""OPERA"" is invalid.

Let’s try another consonant for position 2: T
- O T E _ A → ""OT"" + ""E"" + ? → ""OTERA""? No.
- O M E _ A → ""OME"" + ? → ""OMEGA""? That’s 5 letters: O M E G A. Let’s check:
  - Starts with O ✓
  - Has E in 3rd position ✓
  - Contains A in 5th position ✓
  - No R, S, C, N ✓
  - All letters are valid.

""OMEGA"" seems to fit all constraints.

- O(1) ✓ (matches feedback)
- M(2) – not yet tested, but not excluded
- E(3) ✓ (matches feedback)
- G(4) – not yet tested, but not excluded
