For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, T, R, S, O, L, N, etc. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains 5 very common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

Let me think about the letters: A, R, O, S, E. These are all very common in English words and will give good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(✓) – A is correct in the first position.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(✓) – O is correct in the third position.
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
- E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- The word starts with A.
- The word has O in the third position.
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E.
- Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with A, has O in the third position, and does not contain R, S, or E. Some good candidates are:
- ADOBE – but contains E (invalid)
- ALOOF – contains O in third position, no R/S/E
- ANGEL – contains E (invalid)
- AMBRO – not a valid word
- ADOPT – contains T and P, but no R/S/E
- APOCAL – too long
- ALOOF – valid word, fits all constraints

Let’s try ALOOF.
