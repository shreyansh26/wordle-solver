A good first guess should:
1. Use common vowels (E, A, O, I)
2. Use common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. Avoid rare letters like Q, X, Z, J, etc.

Popular first guesses include:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)
2. CARED → C(x) A(-) R(-) E(-) D(x)

- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, C, D  
- Letters that ARE in the word (but in the wrong positions so far): A, E, R  
- Positions ruled out for A: 3rd (from SLATE) and 2nd (from CARED)  
- Positions ruled out for E: 5th (from SLATE) and 4th (from CARED)  
- Positions ruled out for R: 3rd (from CARED)

So the secret word must contain A, E, R exactly once each, and must NOT contain S, L, T, C, D.  
We still need two more letters, neither of which is S, L, T, C, D, and they must not repeat A, E, R.

Common remaining consonants to try: N, M, P, B, G, H, K, F, Y, V, W, etc.

We want a word that:
- Uses A, E, R in new positions
- Adds two new consonants that haven’t been tested yet
- Keeps the word valid and common

Possible candidates:
- A R E A S – invalid (S already ruled out)
- A R E A D – invalid (D ruled out)
- R A I N E – uses A, E, R and adds I, N (both new letters)
- P A R E D – uses A, E, R and adds P, D (D ruled out)
- M A R E N – uses A, E, R and adds M, N (both new)
- P A R E N – uses A, E, R and adds P, N (both new)

Among these, “RAIN E” is a valid word, and “R A I N E” uses the confirmed letters A, R, E in new positions (A in 1st, R in 2nd, E in 5th) and introduces I and N, both of which haven’t been tested yet.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English 5-letter words include: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, D, U, M, P, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z, J, Q.

A good first guess should:
1. Use common vowels (E, A, O, I)
2. Use common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. Avoid rare letters like Q, X, Z, J, etc.

Popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - but this has rare letters
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it uses very common letters and covers several vowels and consonants.

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)
2. CARED → C(x) A(-) R(-) E(-) D(x)

What we now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, C, D  
- Letters that ARE in the word (but in the wrong positions so far): A, E, R  
- Positions ruled out for A: 3rd (from SLATE) and 2nd (from CARED)  
- Positions ruled out for E: 5th (from SLATE) and 4th (from CARED)  
- Positions ruled out for R: 3rd (from CARED)

So the secret word must contain A, E, R exactly once each, and must NOT contain S, L, T, C, D.  
We still need two more letters, neither of which is S, L, T, C, D, and they must not repeat A, E, R.

Common remaining consonants to try: N, M, P, B, G, H, K, F, Y, V, W, etc.

We want a word that:
- Uses A, E, R in new positions
- Adds two new consonants that haven’t been tested yet
- Keeps the word valid and common

Possible candidates:
- A R E A S – invalid (S already ruled out)
- A R E A D – invalid (D ruled out)
- R A I N E – uses A, E, R and adds I, N (both new letters)
- P A R E D – uses A, E, R and adds P, D (D ruled out)
- M A R E N – uses A, E, R and adds M, N (both new)
- P A R E N – uses A, E, R and adds P, N (both new)

Among these, “RAIN E” is a valid word, and “R A I N E” uses the confirmed letters A, R, E in new positions (A in 1st, R in 2nd, E in 5th) and introduces I and N, both of which haven’t been tested yet.

So the next logical guess is RAIN E.

The feedback says the model answer is not five letters, which means the word we’re looking for is actually a 4-letter word. This is unusual for Wordle-style games, but possible.

Let’s summarize what we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, C, D, R, I, E  
  (from the three guesses and their feedback)
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, N (they appeared in previous guesses but were marked “-” meaning they are in the word but not in those exact positions)
- The word must be 4 letters, not 5.

We still need two more letters that haven’t been ruled out. The remaining common letters include B, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y.

Possible 4-letter words containing A and N:
- ANCH (but C and H: C is ruled out)
- ANGU (but U is possible)
- ANGO (but O is possible)
- ANKY (but K and Y are possible)
- ANGE (but E is ruled out)
- ANNE (but E and N are ruled out)
- ANGI (but I is ruled out)
- ANGO (G and O are possible)
- ANKH (H and K are possible)
- ANNA (but A is repeated and N is allowed)
- ANKY (K and Y are possible)
- ANGO (G and O are possible)
- ANKH (K and H are possible)

The simplest valid word that fits all constraints is “ANKH” (a real word meaning a type of ancient Egyptian cross). It uses A, N, K, H – none of which have been ruled out, and it satisfies the 4-letter requirement.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English 5-letter words include: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, D, U, M, P, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z, J, Q.

A good first guess should:
1. Use common vowels (E, A, O, I)
2. Use common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. Avoid rare letters like Q, X, Z, J, etc.

Popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - but this has rare letters
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it uses very common letters and covers several vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word but wrong position (-)
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain S, L, or T
- Contains both A and E somewhere, but not in the 3rd and 5th positions respectively
- Has 5 letters total

To maximize information, I want a word that:
1. Uses the confirmed letters A and E in new positions
2. Introduces new common consonants we haven't tested yet (R, N, C, D, M, P, etc.)
3. Avoids S, L, T

Good candidates:
- R A D E R (but repeats R)
- A R E A S (but has S)
- C A R E D (C, R, D new)
- R A I N E (but has I and N)
- A R E A S - invalid due to S
- A R E A L - invalid due to L
- A R E A D - invalid (only 4 letters)

The best next guess seems to be ""CARED"":
- C and R are new consonants
- A and E are in new positions (2nd and 3rd instead of 3rd and 5th)
- No S, L, T

4. ANKH → Model answer is not five letters.

These two “Model answer is not five letters” responses indicate that the secret word is actually a 4-letter word, not 5 letters. This is unusual, but possible.

Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, T, C, D, R, I, E, A, N, K, H (from the feedback).

Wait, let me re-examine the feedback carefully:

- SLATE: A(-), E(-) → A and E are in the word, but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively.
- CARED: A(-), R(-), E(-) → A, R, E are in the word, but not in positions 2, 3, 4 respectively.
- R A I N E: model answer is not five letters → the word is 4 letters.
- ANKH: model answer is not five letters → the word is 4 letters.

So the word is 4 letters, and it must contain A, R, E (from the “-” feedback) and must not contain S, L, T, C, D, I, N, K, H.

Letters still allowed: B, F, G, J, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 4-letter word that contains A, R, E and two other letters from the allowed set. Possible combinations:

- A R E _ : needs one more letter from allowed set.
- A _ R E : needs one more letter from allowed set.
- _ A R E : needs one more letter from allowed set.
- _ _ A R E : impossible (only 4 letters).

Let’s list possible 4-letter words with A, R, E:

- AREB (but B is allowed)
- AREF (but F is allowed)
- AREM (but M is allowed)
- AREO (but O is allowed)
- AREP (but P is allowed)

- ZARE (but Z is allowed)

From these, the most common English words are:

- RAPE
- REAP
- RARE (but R repeats)
- AREP (not a common word)
- AREO (not a common word)

RAPE and REAP are both valid 4-letter words, and they contain A, R, E with one additional letter (P) that hasn’t been ruled out.

Between RAPE and REAP, both are equally valid, but RAPE is slightly more common.

So the next guess should be RAPE.

1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English 5-letter words include: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, D, U, M, P, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z, J, Q.

A good first guess should:
1. Use common vowels (E, A, O, I)
2. Use common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. Avoid rare letters like Q, X, Z, J, etc.

Popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - but this has rare letters
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it uses very common letters and covers several vowels and consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word but wrong position (-)
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain S, L, or T
- Contains both A and E somewhere, but not in the 3rd and 5th positions respectively
- Has 5 letters total

To maximize information, I want a word that:
1. Uses the confirmed letters A and E in new positions
2. Introduces new common consonants we haven't tested yet (R, N, C, D, M, P, etc.)
3. Avoids S, L, T

Good candidates:
- R A D E R (but repeats R)
- A R E A S (but has S)
- C A R E D (C, R, D new)
- R A I N E (but has I and N)
- A R E A S - invalid due to S
- A R E A L - invalid due to L
- A R E A D - invalid (only 4 letters)

The best next guess seems to be ""CARED"":
- C and R are new consonants
- A and E are in new positions (2nd and 3rd instead of 3rd and 5th)
- No S, L, T

Guess 2: CARED -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(-) R(-) E(-) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)
2. CARED → C(x) A(-) R(-) E(-) D(x)

What we now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, C, D  
- Letters that ARE in the word (but in the wrong positions so far): A, E, R  
- Positions ruled out for A: 3rd (from SLATE) and 2nd (from CARED)  
- Positions ruled out for E: 5th (from SLATE) and 4th (from CARED)  
- Positions ruled out for R: 3rd (from CARED)

So the secret word must contain A, E, R exactly once each, and must NOT contain S, L, T, C, D.  
We still need two more letters, neither of which is S, L, T, C, D, and they must not repeat A, E, R.

Common remaining consonants to try: N, M, P, B, G, H, K, F, Y, V, W, etc.

We want a word that:
- Uses A, E, R in new positions
- Adds two new consonants that haven’t been tested yet
- Keeps the word valid and common

Possible candidates:
- A R E A S – invalid (S already ruled out)
- A R E A D – invalid (D ruled out)
- R A I N E – uses A, E, R and adds I, N (both new letters)
- P A R E D – uses A, E, R and adds P, D (D ruled out)
- M A R E N – uses A, E, R and adds M, N (both new)
- P A R E N – uses A, E, R and adds P, N (both new)

Among these, “RAIN E” is a valid word, and “R A I N E” uses the confirmed letters A, R, E in new positions (A in 1st, R in 2nd, E in 5th) and introduces I and N, both of which haven’t been tested yet.

So the next logical guess is RAIN E.

The feedback says the model answer is not five letters, which means the word we’re looking for is actually a 4-letter word. This is unusual for Wordle-style games, but possible.

Let’s summarize what we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, C, D, R, I, E  
  (from the three guesses and their feedback)
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, N (they appeared in previous guesses but were marked “-” meaning they are in the word but not in those exact positions)
- The word must be 4 letters, not 5.

We still need two more letters that haven’t been ruled out. The remaining common letters include B, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y.

Possible 4-letter words containing A and N:
- ANCH (but C and H: C is ruled out)
- ANGU (but U is possible)
- ANGO (but O is possible)
- ANKY (but K and Y are possible)
- ANGE (but E is ruled out)
- ANNE (but E and N are ruled out)
- ANGI (but I is ruled out)
- ANGO (G and O are possible)
- ANKH (H and K are possible)
- ANNA (but A is repeated and N is allowed)
- ANKY (K and Y are possible)
- ANGO (G and O are possible)
- ANKH (K and H are possible)

The simplest valid word that fits all constraints is “ANKH” (a real word meaning a type of ancient Egyptian cross). It uses A, N, K, H – none of which have been ruled out, and it satisfies the 4-letter requirement.

2. CARED → C(x) A(-) R(-) E(-) D(x)
3. R A I N E → Model answer is not five letters.
4. ANKH → Model answer is not five letters.

These two “Model answer is not five letters” responses indicate that the secret word is actually a 4-letter word, not 5 letters. This is unusual, but possible.

Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, T, C, D, R, I, E, A, N, K, H (from the feedback).

Wait, let me re-examine the feedback carefully:

- SLATE: A(-), E(-) → A and E are in the word, but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively.
- CARED: A(-), R(-), E(-) → A, R, E are in the word, but not in positions 2, 3, 4 respectively.
- R A I N E: model answer is not five letters → the word is 4 letters.
- ANKH: model answer is not five letters → the word is 4 letters.

So the word is 4 letters, and it must contain A, R, E (from the “-” feedback) and must not contain S, L, T, C, D, I, N, K, H.

Letters still allowed: B, F, G, J, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 4-letter word that contains A, R, E and two other letters from the allowed set. Possible combinations:

- A R E _ : needs one more letter from allowed set.
- A _ R E : needs one more letter from allowed set.
- _ A R E : needs one more letter from allowed set.
- _ _ A R E : impossible (only 4 letters).

Let’s list possible 4-letter words with A, R, E:

- AREB (but B is allowed)
- AREF (but F is allowed)
- AREM (but M is allowed)
- AREO (but O is allowed)
- AREP (but P is allowed)
- AREV (but V is allowed)
- AREY (but Y is allowed)
- AREZ (but Z is allowed)
- EARB (but B is allowed)
- EARF (but F is allowed)
- EARO (but O is allowed)

- RARE (R, A, R, E) – R repeats
- RAPE (but P is allowed)
- REAP (but P is allowed)
- REBA (but B is allowed)
- REFA (but F is allowed)
- REMA (but M is allowed)
- REPA (but P is allowed)
- REXA (but X is allowed)
- RYEA (but Y is allowed)
- YARE (but Y is allowed)
- ZARE (but Z is allowed)

From these, the most common English words are:

- RAPE
- REAP
- RARE (but R repeats)
- AREP (not a common word)
- AREO (not a common word)

RAPE and REAP are both valid 4-letter words, and they contain A, R, E with one additional letter (P) that hasn’t been ruled out.

Between RAPE and REAP, both are equally valid, but RAPE is slightly more common.

So the next guess should be RAPE.

All feedback so far indicates the secret word is NOT five letters. The word is four letters long and must contain A, R, E (from the “-” feedback) and must NOT contain any of S, L, T, C, D, I, N, K, H, P.

Letters still allowed (not ruled out): B, F, G, J, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 4-letter word with A, R, E and one more letter from the allowed set. Possible combinations:

- AREB (B allowed)
- AREF (F allowed)
- AREM (M allowed)
- AREO (O allowed)
- AREP (P ruled out)
- AREV (V allowed)
- AREY (Y allowed)
- AREZ (Z allowed)
- EARB (B allowed)
- EARF (F allowed)
- EARO (O allowed)
- EARV (V allowed)
- EARZ (Z allowed)
- RARE (R repeats, but R is allowed)
- RAEB (B allowed)
- RAEM (M allowed)
- RAEO (O allowed)
- RAEX (X allowed)
- RAEB (B allowed)
- RAEM (M allowed)

- REAV (not a word)
- REAZ (not a word)
- REXA (not a word)
- RYEA (not a word)
- ZARE (ZARE is a word meaning to cover or to shield, but it’s obscure)

Given the constraints, the only common word that fits is RARE, despite the repeated R. However, R is allowed because it hasn’t been ruled out yet.

Therefore, the next logical guess is RARE.
