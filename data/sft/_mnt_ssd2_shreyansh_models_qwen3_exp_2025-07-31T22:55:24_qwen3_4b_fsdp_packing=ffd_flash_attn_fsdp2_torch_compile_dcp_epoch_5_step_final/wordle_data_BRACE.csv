### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to use a word with a mix of these common letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

Current knowledge:
- Pattern: _ R A _ E  (positions 2, 3, 5 are fixed)
- Letters not in the word: S, L, T, G, P, N
- C is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1, so it must be in position 4)

Thus the word must be _ R A C E

The only common 5-letter word that fits is ""RACED"" but D hasn't been tested yet. However, we know from the feedback that N is not in the word, so the fourth letter must be C and the first letter must be a new letter not yet tried.

Looking at common first letters not yet used: B, D, F, H, K, M, V, W, Y

A valid word that fits _ R A C E is ""BRACE"", ""CRACE"" (invalid), ""DRACE"" (invalid), etc. The only common valid word is ""BRACE"".

Check letters:
- B: new letter
- R: correct position
- A: correct position
- C: correct position (from feedback C was in word but wrong place, so now in position 4)
- E: correct position

Therefore, ""BRACE"" is the logical next guess.
