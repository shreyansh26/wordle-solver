1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible

Some excellent starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (contains A, U, D, I, O)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a very common word that tests S, L, A, T, E - covering several of the most frequent letters in English.

From the feedback:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was 1st, so it must be 2nd-5th)

Good next guesses would test new consonants and vowels while keeping E fixed. Since S must appear once more, we can place it in position 2, 3, or 4 and fill the remaining slots with new letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible

Some excellent starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (contains A, U, D, I, O)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a very common word that tests S, L, A, T, E - covering several of the most frequent letters in English.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)

From the feedback:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was 1st, so it must be 2nd-5th)
- E is in the word and in the correct 5th position
- L, A, T are not in the word at all

So the pattern so far is: _ _ _ _ E  
and we know S is somewhere in positions 2-4.

Good next guesses would test new consonants and vowels while keeping E fixed. Since S must appear once more, we can place it in position 2, 3, or 4 and fill the remaining slots with new letters.  
A strong candidate is ""SHINE"" because:
- It keeps E in the 5th spot
- Places S in the 2nd spot (testing S in a new position)
- Introduces H, I, N as new letters to test

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. E is definitely in the 5th position (✓).
2. S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 2 (it was wrong in both guesses), so S must be in position 3 or 4.
3. Letters L, A, T, H, I, N are NOT in the word at all.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ E  
with S somewhere in slot 3 or 4.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that contains S in slot 3 or 4, and uses only letters that have not been ruled out (so no L, A, T, H, I, N).

Good remaining consonants to test: R, C, D, B, M, P, G, F, K, etc.

Let’s try placing S in slot 3 and build around it:
- _ _ S _ E  
We need two new letters for slots 1 and 2. A common pattern is ""B"" or ""C"" as the first letter.  
A good candidate is ""CRUSE"":
- C (new letter)
- R (new letter)
- U (new vowel)
- S (known to be in word, position 3)

CRUSE uses only letters not yet ruled out and places S in position 3.

Let’s look for words ending in “S E”:
- B O S E → “BOSE” (valid word, 4 letters) – too short.
- D O S E → “DOSE” (valid word) – uses D and O, both allowed.
- F O S E → “FOSE” (valid, though uncommon).
- G O S E → “GOSE” (valid, but rare).
- M O S E → “MOSE” (valid, but rare).
- P O S E → “POSE” (valid, common word).

“POSE” is a common word that fits perfectly:
- P (new letter)
- O (new vowel)
- S (known to be in 4th position)
- E (known correct 5th position)

No letters are repeated or ruled out.

The feedback for POSE was “Model answer is not five letters.”  
That means the word we are trying to guess is NOT “POSE,” and the system is giving us no further information about POSE.  
This tells us the word must be a five-letter word that:
- Ends in “SE” (because S is in 4th and E is 5th).
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no L, A, T, H, I, N, C, R, U).

Letters still available: B, D, F, G, K, M, P, V, W, Y, plus the vowels O (only vowel left).

So the pattern is: _ _ _ S E  
We need a valid 5-letter English word ending in “SE” that uses only the still-allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- BOSE (but it’s 4 letters).
- DOSE (valid, 5 letters).
- FUSE (but U is ruled out).
- GOSE (valid, 5 letters).
- MOSE (valid, 5 letters).
-POSE (already tried).
- WOSE (valid, 5 letters).

Among these, “DOSE” is the most common and uses only allowed letters.

Therefore, the next logical guess is DOSE.

Wait, let’s list all valid 5-letter English words ending in “S E” and check the letters:

- BOSE – 4 letters.
- DOSE – 5 letters, but D is ruled out.
- FUSE – U is ruled out.
- GOSE – G is allowed, O is ruled out.
- MOSE – M is allowed, O is ruled out.

- VOSE – V is allowed, O is ruled out.
- WOSE – W is allowed, O is ruled out.
- YOSE – Y is allowed, O is ruled out.

Hmm, none of the common words fit. Let’s think of less common words:

- B Y S E – “BYSE” – not a word.
- F K S E – “FKSE” – not a word.
- G K S E – “GKSE” – not a word.
- M K S E – “MKSE” – not a word.

- M Y S E – “MYSE” – not a word.
- V Y S E – “VYSE” – not a word.
- W Y S E – “WYSE” – not a word.

Wait, let me double-check the allowed letters: B, F, G, K, M, V, W, Y.

The only valid 5-letter English word ending in “S E” using these letters is “W Y S E” – but “WYSE” is not a common word. However, “WYSE” is actually a valid English word meaning “to be wise” or “to be of sound mind,” though it’s quite rare.

Given the constraints, “WYSE” is the only candidate left. However, since it’s very uncommon, let me reconsider.

Another approach: maybe the word is “M Y S E” – but that’s not a word either.

Wait, let me check “M Y S E” – no, that’s not correct.

Actually, the only valid word left is “W Y S E,” but it’s extremely rare. Let me think if I missed any.

Looking back, the pattern is _ _ _ S E with allowed letters B, F, G, K, M, V, W, Y.

Possible combinations:
- B K S E – not a word.
- B F S E – not a word.
- B G S E – not a word.
- B M S E – not a word.
- B V S E – not a word.

This is perplexing. It appears there are no common 5-letter English words ending in “S E” using only the allowed letters. Let me reconsider the allowed letters.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in ruling out letters. Let me list again:

Ruled out letters: L, A, T, H, I, N, C, R, U, P, D, O.

Allowed letters: B, F, G, K, M, V, W, Y, plus the vowels E (already used) and S (already used).
