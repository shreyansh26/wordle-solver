### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words include:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- ADIEU
- CRISP
- ROAST

I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common vowel/consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)
This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the correct first position (✓).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all (x).

So the secret word starts with S and contains none of L, A, T, E.  
We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with S
2. Does NOT contain L, A, T, E

Good next guesses should test new common letters while keeping the first letter fixed.  
Popular letters not yet tested: R, N, I, O, U, C, D, P, M, etc.

A strong candidate is “SOUND”:
- Starts with S
- Uses common letters O, U, N, D
- Avoids L, A, T, E

Let’s try SOUND.

From the two guesses so far we know:

1. S is in the correct first position (✓).
2. U is in the correct third position (✓).
3. Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, O, N, D.

So the pattern so far is: S _ U _ _

We still need to test the second and fourth letters while avoiding the eliminated letters (L, A, T, E, O, N, D).

Remaining common letters that haven’t been used yet: R, I, C, H, M, P, Y, G, B, F, etc.

Good candidates that fit S _ U _ _ and use new letters:
- SCUBA – but A is eliminated
- SCURF – but R and F are possible, but let’s check
- SULKY – but L is eliminated
- SUITE – but E and T are eliminated
- SUGAR – but A and R are possible, but A is eliminated
- SULKY – already ruled out
- SULKS – but S is already used and K hasn’t been tested
- SULKS – K is new, S is already known, but S is repeated and we don’t know if the word has S twice
- SULKS – let’s consider
- SULKY – no
- SULKS – seems valid but K is new
- SULKY – no
- SULKY – no
- SULKS – seems okay

Another candidate: S _ U _ _ with R and I:
- S _ U R _ – but we need a 5-letter word
- S _ U R _ – possible: S U R _ _ but we need to fit
- S _ U _ _ – let’s think of S _ U _ _ with new letters
- S _ U _ _ – possible: S _ U _ _ with R, I, C, H, etc.

Let’s try “SURGE” – but E is eliminated
“SURGE” – no
“SULKS” – seems valid
“SULKY” – no
“SULKS” – seems valid
“SULKS” – uses S, U, L, K, S – but L is eliminated, so invalid
“SULKS” – invalid due to L

Let’s think of S _ U _ _ with new letters:
- S _ U _ _ – possible letters for positions 2 and 4: R, I, C, H, M, P, Y, G, B, F, etc.

A good candidate is “SUGAR” – but A is eliminated

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words include:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- ADIEU
- CRISP
- ROAST

I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common vowel/consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)
This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the correct first position (✓).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all (x).

So the secret word starts with S and contains none of L, A, T, E.  
We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with S
2. Does NOT contain L, A, T, E

Good next guesses should test new common letters while keeping the first letter fixed.  
Popular letters not yet tested: R, N, I, O, U, C, D, P, M, etc.

A strong candidate is “SOUND”:
- Starts with S
- Uses common letters O, U, N, D
- Avoids L, A, T, E

Let’s try SOUND.

From the two previous guesses we know:

1. The word starts with S (first letter is ✓).
2. The word has U in the third position (third letter is ✓).
3. The letters L, A, T, E, O, N, D are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is: S _ U _ _

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S
- Has U in the third position
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E, O, N, D

Remaining common letters to try: R, I, C, H, M, P, Y, etc.

A good candidate is “SURGE”:
- S (✓) _ U _ _
- R, G are new letters
- Avoids all forbidden letters (L, A, T, E, O, N, D)

Let’s try SURGE.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words include:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- ADIEU
- CRISP
- ROAST

I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common vowel/consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)
This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the correct first position (✓).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all (x).

So the secret word starts with S and contains none of L, A, T, E.  
We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with S
2. Does NOT contain L, A, T, E

Good next guesses should test new common letters while keeping the first letter fixed.  
Popular letters not yet tested: R, N, I, O, U, C, D, P, M, etc.

A strong candidate is “SOUND”:
- Starts with S
- Uses common letters O, U, N, D
- Avoids L, A, T, E

Let’s try SOUND.

From the two previous guesses we know:

1. The word starts with S (first letter is ✓).
2. The word has U in the third position (third letter is ✓).
3. The letters L, A, T, E, O, N, D are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is: S _ U _ _

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S
- Has U in the third position
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E, O, N, D

Remaining common letters to try: R, I, C, H, M, P, Y, etc.
