### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. A good starting word often includes vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly strong because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- 2 common consonants (R, S) which appear frequently in English words
- No repeating letters, which helps eliminate multiple possibilities at once

This combination should give us good coverage of common letters and positions to narrow down the secret word efficiently.

Possible positions:
- A must be in 4 or 5
- T must be in 4 or 5 (cannot be 2 or 3)
- U must be in 2 or 3 or 5 (cannot be 4)

Let’s list possible combinations:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. A good starting word often includes vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly strong because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- 2 common consonants (R, S) which appear frequently in English words
- No repeating letters, which helps eliminate multiple possibilities at once

This combination should give us good coverage of common letters and positions to narrow down the secret word efficiently.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-)  → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is NOT in the word.
- O(x) → O is NOT in the word.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, S
- Positions to avoid: A not in 1, S not in 4

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and S
- Does NOT contain R, O, or E
- Places A somewhere other than 1st
- Places S somewhere other than 4th

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.
Good vowels to try: I, U (since A is already confirmed and O/E are out)

Let's try a word that uses A and S in new positions and adds common consonants. ""STAIN"" comes to mind:
- S in position 1 (allowed, since only position 4 is forbidden for S)
- T, I, N are new letters
- A in position 3 (allowed, since only position 1 is forbidden for A)
- No R, O, or E

This should give us more information about positions 2, 3, 4, 5.

  – A cannot be in positions 1 or 3.

We still need three more letters (positions 2, 4, 5) that are not R, O, E, I, N and must include T and A in valid spots.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5  
Possible positions for T: 3, 4, 5 (cannot be 2)

Let’s try placing A in position 2 and T in position 3. That gives us S A T _ _.  
We need one more letter for position 5 that is not any of the excluded letters and is common. Good candidates: L, C, D, M, P, etc.

A simple word that fits: SATUM (but U is allowed). However, SATUM is obscure.

Better choice: SATIN – but N is excluded.

Next: SATAL – but L is allowed, A is already used. SATAL is valid.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters in the word (confirmed):
- S (position 1, fixed)
- A (must appear, but not in positions 1,2,3)
- T (must appear, but not in positions 2,3)
- U (must appear, but not in position 4)

Letters NOT in the word:
- R, O, E, I, N, M, L, F

Forbidden positions:
- S is already at 1.
- A cannot be in 1,2,3 → must be in 4 or 5
- T cannot be in 2,3 → must be in 4 or 5
- U cannot be in 4 → must be in 2,3, or 5

We have 5 slots: 1(S), 2, 3, 4, 5
We need to place A, T, U in 2,3,4,5 with the above constraints.

Possible placements:

Case 1: A in 4
Then T and U must go in 2,3,5 with:
- T can be in 5 (cannot be 2,3)
- U can be in 2,3,5

Subcases:
- T in 5, U in 2 → word: S U _ A T
- T in 5, U in 3 → word: S _ U A T
- T in 5, U in 5 → impossible (T and U can’t both be in 5)

Case 2: A in 5
Then T and U must go in 2,3,4 with:
- T can be in 4 (cannot be 2,3)
- U can be in 2,3,4

Subcases:
- T in 4, U in 2 → word: S U _ _ A
- T in 4, U in 3 → word: S _ U T A
- T in 4, U in 4 → impossible (T and U can’t both be in 4)

Now we need to fill the remaining blank with a letter that is NOT in the forbidden list. The remaining allowed letters (not yet excluded) are: B, C, D, G, H, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

- S_Y_U_T_A – “syuta” not a word

None of these seem to form valid English words. This suggests we need to re-examine our constraints or consider that the remaining blank might be a less common letter.

Looking back, we missed a key point: the word must be a valid 5-letter English word. The only common English word that fits all constraints is “SULTA,” but we already know F is not in the word and F was in sulfa. However, “SULTA” is not a valid English word.

Upon closer inspection, the valid English word that fits is “SULTA” is not valid, but “SULTA” is actually a valid word in some dictionaries (e.g., a type of sandal). However, more commonly, the word we are looking for is “SULTA” or “SULTA” is not recognized.

Re-evaluating, the most likely valid word that fits all constraints is “SULTA.” However, since we know L and F are not in the word, let’s try a different approach.

Looking at the remaining allowed letters: B, C, D, G, H, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A valid English word that fits the pattern S _ U T A is “SULTA” (but L is excluded) or “SULTA” is not valid. Another possibility is “SULTA” is not valid, but “SULTA” is not a word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. A good starting word often includes vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly strong because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- 2 common consonants (R, S) which appear frequently in English words
- No repeating letters, which helps eliminate multiple possibilities at once

This combination should give us good coverage of common letters and positions to narrow down the secret word efficiently.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-)  → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is NOT in the word.
- O(x) → O is NOT in the word.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, S
- Positions to avoid: A not in 1, S not in 4

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and S
- Does NOT contain R, O, or E
- Places A somewhere other than 1st
- Places S somewhere other than 4th

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.
Good vowels to try: I, U (since A is already confirmed and O/E are out)

Let's try a word that uses A and S in new positions and adds common consonants. ""STAIN"" comes to mind:
- S in position 1 (allowed, since only position 4 is forbidden for S)
- T, I, N are new letters
- A in position 3 (allowed, since only position 1 is forbidden for A)
- No R, O, or E

This should give us more information about positions 2, 3, 4, 5.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: stain -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on ""stain"":

- S(✓)  → S is in position 1 (locked in).
- T(-)  → T is in the word but not in position 2.
- A(-)  → A is in the word but not in position 3.
- I(x)  → I is NOT in the word.
- N(x)  → N is NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: S (position 1), T, A
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E, I, N
- Forbidden positions:
  – S is already fixed at 1.
  – T cannot be in position 2.
  – A cannot be in positions 1 or 3.

We still need three more letters (positions 2, 4, 5) that are not R, O, E, I, N and must include T and A in valid spots.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5  
Possible positions for T: 3, 4, 5 (cannot be 2)

Let’s try placing A in position 2 and T in position 3. That gives us S A T _ _.  
We need one more letter for position 5 that is not any of the excluded letters and is common. Good candidates: L, C, D, M, P, etc.

A simple word that fits: SATUM (but U is allowed). However, SATUM is obscure.

Better choice: SATIN – but N is excluded.

Next: SATAL – but L is allowed, A is already used. SATAL is valid.

But SATAL has two As, which might be redundant.

Let’s try SATUM instead. It’s valid and uses common letters.

Another option: SATUL – but L is allowed.

Let’s go with SATUM as it’s straightforward.

Check constraints:
- S at 1 ✓
- A at 2 ✓ (not 1 or 3)
- T at 3 ✓ (not 2)
- U and M are new letters, not excluded.

Thus, SATUM is a valid next guess.

Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)

Guess 3: satum -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(-) T(-) U(-) M(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on ""satum"":

- S(✓)  → S is still confirmed at position 1.
- A(-)  → A is in the word but not in position 2.
- T(-)  → T is in the word but not in position 3.
- U(-)  → U is in the word but not in position 4.
- M(x)  → M is NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: S (pos 1), A, T, U
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E, I, N, M
- Forbidden positions:
  – S is fixed at 1
  – A cannot be in 1, 2, or 3
  – T cannot be in 2 or 3
  – U cannot be in 4

We need to place A, T, U in positions 2,3,4,5 while respecting the above constraints.

Possible positions:
- A must be in 4 or 5
- T must be in 4 or 5 (cannot be 2 or 3)
- U must be in 2 or 3 or 5 (cannot be 4)

Let’s list possible combinations:

Case 1: A in 4
Then T and U must go into 2,3,5 with T in 5 (since T cannot be 2 or 3). Then U must be in 2 or 3.
- T in 5, U in 2 → word: S U _ A T
- U in 3 → word: S _ U A T

Case 2: A in 5
Then T and U must go into 2,3,4 with T in 4 (since T cannot be 2 or 3). Then U must be in 2 or 3.
- T in 4, U in 2 → word: S U _ _ A
- U in 3 → word: S _ U T A

Now we need to fill the remaining blank with a letter not excluded (not R,O,E,I,N,M). Common consonants left: L, C, D, P, etc.

Let’s pick the most common remaining consonant: L.

Possible words:
- S U L A T → ""sulat"" – not a valid English word
- S U _ A T → ""s _ _ a t"" – need valid word
- S _ U A T → ""s _ u a t"" – need valid word
- S _ U T A → ""s _ u t a"" – need valid word

Looking at valid English words that fit:

- SULTA – not common
- SULFA – not common
- SULFA is a valid word (antibiotic), but let's see if it fits constraints:
  - S(1) ✓
  - U(2) ✓ (not forbidden)
  - L(3) – new letter
  - F(4) – new letter
  - A(5) – allowed (not in 1,2,3)

But F hasn't been tested yet and is allowed.

Another valid word: SULTA – not common
Another: SULFA

Let’s try SULFA.

Check constraints:
- S(1) ✓
- U(2) – allowed (not forbidden)
- L(3) – new, allowed
- F(4) – new, allowed
- A(5) – allowed (not in 1,2,3)

But F hasn't been tested yet and is allowed.

However, we might prefer a more common word. Another candidate: SULTA is obscure.

Another approach: let’s try placing A in 5, T in 4, U in 2:
S U _ T A → need a letter for position 3 (not excluded). Let’s try C: S U C T A – not a word.
Try D: S U D T A – not a word.
Try P: S U P T A – not a word.

Try placing A in 4, T in 5, U in 2: S U _ A T → need a letter for position 3. Try L: S U L A T – not a word.
Try C: S U C A T – not a word.

Try placing A in 4, U in 3, T in 5: S _ U A T → need a letter for position 2. Try L: S L U A T – not a word.
Try C: S C U A T – not a word.

Try placing A in 5, U in 3, T in 4: S _ U T A → need a letter for position 2. Try L: S L U T A – not a word.
Try C: S C U T A – not a word.

Wait, let’s think of valid English words that fit the constraints:
- SULTA – not valid
- SULFA – valid (antibiotic)
- SULFA seems to be the best fit.

Another valid word: SULTA is not valid, but SULFA is.

Let’s go with SULFA.Based on the feedback, the secret word starts with S and contains A, T, U in unknown positions. The constraints are:
- S is fixed at position 1.
- A cannot be in 1,2,3.
- T cannot be in 2,3.
- U cannot be in 4.

The valid word that fits these constraints is SULFA.

From the feedback so far:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   – R, O, E are not in the word.
   – A is in the word but not in position 1.
   – S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. stain → S(✓) T(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   – S is in position 1.
   – T is in the word but not in position 2.
   – A is in the word but not in position 3.
   – I, N are not in the word.

3. satum → S(✓) A(-) T(-) U(-) M(x)
   – S is confirmed at position 1.
   – A is in the word but not in position 2.
   – T is in the word but not in position 3.
   – U is in the word but not in position 4.
   – M is not in the word.

4. sulfa → S(✓) U(-) L(x) F(x) A(-)
   – S is confirmed at position 1.
   – U is in the word but not in position 2.
   – L, F are not in the word.
   – A is in the word but not in position 5.

Summary of constraints:
- Letters known to be in the word: S, A, T, U
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, O, E, I, N, M, L, F
- Position constraints:
  – S is fixed at position 1.
  – A cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (because it’s excluded from 1,2,3 and 5 in the last guess), so A must be in position 4.
  – T cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from stain and satum), so T must be in position 5.
  – U cannot be in positions 2 or 4 (from satum and sulfa), so U must be in position 3.

Thus the only possible arrangement is:
S _ U A T

The blank (position 2) must be a letter not yet ruled out. The remaining unused letters are: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a common English word that fits S _ U A T. The only common word that fits is “squat”.

Check constraints:
- S at 1 ✓
- Q (new letter) at 2 – allowed
- U at 3 ✓
- A at 4 ✓
- T at 5 ✓

No excluded letters are used, and all constraints are satisfied.
