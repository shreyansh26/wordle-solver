For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and helps me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, I, O, U, R, S, T, L, N. 

One of the most common 5-letter words in English is ""AROSE"" because it contains several of these high-frequency letters. Let's go with that as my first guess.

So the secret word is now known to be:
- S _ R E _
- Letters already confirmed: S, R, E
- Letters already ruled out: A, O, T, I, N
- We need two more letters for positions 2 and 5, chosen from remaining common letters not yet ruled out.

Common remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits S _ R E _ and uses only allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
- S C R E _ → ""SCREE"" (but E is already in 4, and E in 5 would be allowed, but SCREE is valid)
- S P R E _ → ""SPREE"" (but P is allowed, E in 5 is allowed)

- ""SWREE"" – invalid

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and helps me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, I, O, U, R, S, T, L, N. 

One of the most common 5-letter words in English is ""AROSE"" because it contains several of these high-frequency letters. Let's go with that as my first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- O: not in the word (x)
- S: in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- E: in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains R, S, E
- Does NOT contain A or O
- R is not in position 2
- S is not in position 4
- E is not in position 5

I want a new word that:
1. Uses R, S, E
2. Avoids A and O
3. Keeps R, S, E in positions that haven't been ruled out
4. Uses other common letters to help narrow things down

A good candidate is ""RESET"":
- R in position 1 (not ruled out)
- E in position 2 (not ruled out)
- S in position 3 (not ruled out)
- E in position 4 (not ruled out)
- T in position 5 (new letter to test)

This tests new positions for R, S, E and introduces T.

Guess 2: reset -> FEEDBACK: R(-) E(-) S(-) E(✓) T(x)

<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on RESET:
- R(-): still in the word, but not in position 1
- E(-): still in the word, but not in position 2
- S(-): still in the word, but not in position 3
- E(✓): E is in position 4 (correct position)
- T(x): T is not in the word

So the secret word:
- Contains R, S, E
- E is fixed in position 4
- R is not in position 1 or 2
- S is not in position 3 or 4
- Does NOT contain A, O, T

Possible positions:
- Position 1: can't be R (from RESET feedback) and can't be A, O, T
- Position 2: can't be R, E
- Position 3: can't be S
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- Position 5: can't be E, T

I need a 5-letter word with E in position 4, using R and S somewhere else, avoiding A, O, T.

Candidate words:
- ""SERVE"" – but S is in position 1 (allowed), E in 4 (fixed), R in 2 (but R was in 2 in AROSE and marked wrong, so R can't be in 2). So SERVE has R in 2 – invalid.
- ""VERSE"" – V is new, but R is in 2 – invalid.
- ""CRESE"" – C is new, but E in 4, R in 1, S in 3. R in 1 was not ruled out (RESET had R in 1 marked wrong, but that's position 1, so R could be elsewhere). However, S in 3 was marked wrong in RESET (S was in 3 and marked wrong), so S can't be in 3. In CRESE, S is in 3 – invalid.
- ""CRISP"" – P is new, but S is in 4 (invalid, E is in 4).
- ""DRESS"" – S in 5 (allowed), but S in 3 is invalid.
- ""FRESH"" – H is new, but S in 3 is invalid.
- ""PRESS"" – P is new, S in 3 and 5 – S in 3 invalid.
- ""BRISE"" – B is new, R in 1 (allowed), I is new, S in 3 (invalid).
- ""DRIVE"" – D is new, R in 1 (allowed), I is new, V is new, E in 4 (fixed). This seems valid: R in 1 (not ruled out), S not present – but we know S must be in the word. So invalid.
- ""SIREN"" – N is new, but S in 1 (allowed), I in 2 (allowed), R in 3 (allowed), E in 4 (fixed), N in 5 (allowed). This uses S, R, E with E fixed in 4 and avoids A, O, T. Also S is in 1 (not ruled out), R in 3 (not ruled out), S not in 3 (valid), etc.

""SIREN"" seems valid.

Wait, let's re-examine the feedback carefully:
- SKREE has E in position 5 marked as (-), meaning the letter E is in the word but not in position 5. However, we already know E is in position 4 (from SIREN feedback). This implies there is only one E in the word, at position 4. Therefore, the pattern is S _ R E _.

Letters already ruled out: A, O, T, I, N, K
Letters already confirmed: S, R, E in positions 1, 3, 4 respectively

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with S, has R in position 3 and E in position 4, uses only allowed letters, and is not any of the previous guesses.

Possible patterns: S _ R E _

Possible letters for position 2 and 5 (from remaining common letters): B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and helps me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, I, O, U, R, S, T, L, N. 

One of the most common 5-letter words in English is ""AROSE"" because it contains several of these high-frequency letters. Let's go with that as my first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- O: not in the word (x)
- S: in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- E: in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains R, S, E
- Does NOT contain A or O
- R is not in position 2
- S is not in position 4
- E is not in position 5

I want a new word that:
1. Uses R, S, E
2. Avoids A and O
3. Keeps R, S, E in positions that haven't been ruled out
4. Uses other common letters to help narrow things down

A good candidate is ""RESET"":
- R in position 1 (not ruled out)
- E in position 2 (not ruled out)
- S in position 3 (not ruled out)
- E in position 4 (not ruled out)
- T in position 5 (new letter to test)

This tests new positions for R, S, E and introduces T.

Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: reset -> FEEDBACK: R(-) E(-) S(-) E(✓) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on RESET:
- R(-): still in the word, but not in position 1
- E(-): still in the word, but not in position 2
- S(-): still in the word, but not in position 3
- E(✓): E is in position 4 (correct position)
- T(x): T is not in the word

So the secret word:
- Contains R, S, E
- E is fixed in position 4
- R is not in position 1 or 2
- S is not in position 3 or 4
- Does NOT contain A, O, T

Possible positions:
- Position 1: can't be R (from RESET feedback) and can't be A, O, T
- Position 2: can't be R, E
- Position 3: can't be S
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- Position 5: can't be E, T

I need a 5-letter word with E in position 4, using R and S somewhere else, avoiding A, O, T.

Candidate words:
- ""SERVE"" – but S is in position 1 (allowed), E in 4 (fixed), R in 2 (but R was in 2 in AROSE and marked wrong, so R can't be in 2). So SERVE has R in 2 – invalid.
- ""VERSE"" – V is new, but R is in 2 – invalid.
- ""CRESE"" – C is new, but E in 4, R in 1, S in 3. R in 1 was not ruled out (RESET had R in 1 marked wrong, but that's position 1, so R could be elsewhere). However, S in 3 was marked wrong in RESET (S was in 3 and marked wrong), so S can't be in 3. In CRESE, S is in 3 – invalid.
- ""CRISP"" – P is new, but S is in 4 (invalid, E is in 4).
- ""DRESS"" – S in 5 (allowed), but S in 3 is invalid.
- ""FRESH"" – H is new, but S in 3 is invalid.
- ""PRESS"" – P is new, S in 3 and 5 – S in 3 invalid.
- ""BRISE"" – B is new, R in 1 (allowed), I is new, S in 3 (invalid).
- ""DRIVE"" – D is new, R in 1 (allowed), I is new, V is new, E in 4 (fixed). This seems valid: R in 1 (not ruled out), S not present – but we know S must be in the word. So invalid.
- ""SIREN"" – N is new, but S in 1 (allowed), I in 2 (allowed), R in 3 (allowed), E in 4 (fixed), N in 5 (allowed). This uses S, R, E with E fixed in 4 and avoids A, O, T. Also S is in 1 (not ruled out), R in 3 (not ruled out), S not in 3 (valid), etc.

""SIREN"" seems valid.

Common remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits S _ R E _ and uses only allowed letters.

Looking for valid words:
- ""SCREE"" – valid, uses C and E
- ""SPREE"" – valid, uses P and E
- ""SHREE"" – invalid
- ""SKREE"" – valid, uses K and E
- ""SWREE"" – invalid
- ""SMREE"" – invalid
- ""SBREE"" – invalid
- ""SDREE"" – invalid
- ""SFREE"" – invalid
- ""SGREE"" – invalid

Among these, ""SCREE"", ""SPREE"", and ""SKREE"" are all valid. I'll choose ""SKREE"" because it uses K, which hasn't been tested yet.

From the feedback on SPREE:
- S(✓) – correct in position 1
- P(x) – P is NOT in the word
- R(✓) – correct in position 3
- E(✓) – correct in position 4
- E(-) – the second E is in the word but not in position 5

So the pattern is still:
S _ R E _

Letters already ruled out: A, O, T, I, N, K, P
Letters already confirmed: S, R, E in positions 1, 3, 4 respectively

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits S _ R E _ using only allowed letters. Remaining common letters for positions 2 and 5: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, V, W, Y.

Possible words:
- S C R E _ → ""SCREE"" (but E is already in 4, and E in 5 would be allowed, but SCREE is valid)
- S B R E _ → ""SBREE"" (invalid)
- S D R E _ → ""SDREE"" (invalid)

- S L R E _ → ""SLERE"" (invalid)
- S M R E _ → ""SMREE"" (invalid)
- S W R E _ → ""SWREE"" (invalid)
- S F R E _ → ""SFREE"" (invalid)
- S G R E _ → ""SGREE"" (invalid)
- S U R E _ → ""SURE_"" (invalid)
- S V R E _ → ""SVREE"" (invalid)
- S Y R E _ → ""SYREE"" (invalid)

The only valid word left is ""SCREE"". 

However, we need to check if ""SCREE"" has been tried before. From the history:
- SKREE (Guess 4) was tried, and it was marked S(✓) K(x) R(✓) E(✓) E(-)
- SPREE (Guess 5) was tried, and it was marked S(✓) P(x) R(✓) E(✓) E(-)

""SCREE"" has not been tried yet. It fits the pattern S _ R E _ and uses allowed letters.

Therefore, the next guess should be SCREE.
