### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities quickly. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these common letters to maximize information gain. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because:
- It contains 5 distinct letters (A, R, O, S, E)
- All are among the most common letters in English
- This gives us a good chance to hit at least one correct letter in the first guess

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so R is the second letter
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so O is somewhere else, not the third position
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so E is the fifth letter

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ R _ _ E
- Must contain O somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4
- Cannot contain A or S

Next guess should:
1. Keep R in position 2 and E in position 5
2. Try O in a new position (positions 1, 3, or 4)
3. Use other common letters that haven’t been ruled out

Good candidates: ORATE, ORGUE, ORBEE, etc. ORATE uses O in position 1, which is new. Let’s try ORATE.

From the two guesses so far:

1. arose → A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)  
   - Pattern: _ R _ _ E  
   - Letters known to be in the word: R (pos 2), O, E (pos 5)  
   - Letters known NOT in the word: A, S  

2. orate → O(-) R(✓) A(x) T(✓) E(✓)  
   - Confirms R (pos 2), E (pos 5) again.  
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
   - T is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
   - A is NOT in the word (already known).

So we now have:
- Fixed letters: R (pos 2), E (pos 5)  
- Must include O somewhere other than position 1 or 3 (since O was in pos 3 in arose and marked “wrong position”, and now in pos 1 in orate and marked “wrong position”)  
  ⇒ O must be in position 4.  
- Must include T somewhere other than position 4 (since T was in pos 4 in orate and marked “wrong position”)  
  ⇒ T must be in position 1 or 3.  

Current pattern:  
- pos 1: ? (T or other)  
- pos 2: R  
- pos 3: ? (T or other)  
- pos 4: O  
- pos 5: E  

We need to test T in position 1 or 3.  
- If T is in pos 1: T R _ O E  
- If T is in pos 3: _ R T O E  

Common 5-letter words fitting these patterns:
- TRITE (but I is not yet confirmed)  
- BROKE (but B is untested)  
- FROZE (Z is less common)  
- PROTE (not a word)  
- TRITE seems valid and tests T in pos 1.

From the feedback so far:

1. arose → A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)  
   - Pattern: _ R _ _ E  
   - Letters known in word: R (pos 2), O, E (pos 5)  
   - Letters known NOT in word: A, S  

2. orate → O(-) R(✓) A(x) T(✓) E(✓)  
   - Confirms R (pos 2), E (pos 5) again.  
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
   - T is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
   - A is NOT in the word (already known).

3. trite → T(-) R(✓) I(x) T(✓) E(✓)  
   - Confirms R (pos 2), E (pos 5) again.  
   - T is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
   - I is NOT in the word (already known).  
   - The second T is in position 4 and marked ✓, so T must be in position 4.

Now we have:
- Pattern: _ R _ T E  
- Must contain O (from arose and orate feedback)  
  ⇒ O must be in position 3 (since positions 1, 2, 4, 5 are fixed or ruled out).  
- Letters already ruled out: A, S, I  
- Letters already used: R, O, T, E  

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ R O T E.

Common words fitting this pattern:
- BROTE – not a valid English word  
- PROTE – not a valid English word  
- FROZE – but Z is not yet ruled out; however, FROZE would be F R O Z E, which doesn’t fit _ R O T E.  
- CROTE – not a word  
- GROTE – not a word  
- DROTE – not a word  
- MROTE – not a word  
- HROTE – not a word  
- WROTE – W R O T E is a valid English word!

Let’s verify:
- W R O T E:  
  - W: untested, but possible.  
  - R: confirmed pos 2.  
  - O: confirmed in word and must be pos 3.  
  - T: confirmed pos 4.  
  - E: confirmed pos 5.

This fits all constraints.
