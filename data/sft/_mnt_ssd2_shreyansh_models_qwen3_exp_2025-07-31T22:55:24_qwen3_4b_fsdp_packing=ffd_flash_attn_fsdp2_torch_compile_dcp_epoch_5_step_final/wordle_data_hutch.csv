For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess should cover as many of these common letters as possible without repeating letters.

Some strong first guesses are:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a very common word and includes 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 very common consonants (S, L, T).

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: x → not in the word
- L: x → not in the word
- A: x → not in the word
- T: - → in the word but not in the 4th position
- E: x → not in the word

So we know:
- The word contains T somewhere, but not in position 4.
- It does NOT contain S, L, A, or E.

Next, I want to try a word that:
1. Includes T in a different position (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).
2. Uses new common letters (since S, L, A, E are ruled out).
3. Uses other frequent consonants and vowels.

Common letters left to try: R, I, N, O, U, C, H, M, P, D, G, etc.

A good candidate is ""TRIUM"" (but that's 5 letters and T is in position 1, which is allowed). However, ""TRIUM"" might not be a valid English word. Another option is ""ROUND"" – it has T? No, it doesn't. ""CRIMP"" – has T? No. ""PRIMO"" – has T? No. ""TUNIC"" – has T in position 1.

""TUNIC"" is a valid word (a garment) and uses:
- T in position 1 (allowed since T wasn't in position 4 before)
- U, N, I, C – all new letters we haven't tried yet.

This seems like a strong next guess.

Summary of what we know so far:

Letters in the word (from feedback):
- U is in position 2 (✓).
- T is in the word but NOT in position 1 or 4 (- twice).
- C is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).

Letters NOT in the word (from feedback):
- S, L, A, E, N, I.

So the word looks like: _ U _ _ _ with T and C somewhere else, and the remaining letters must be chosen from the unused pool: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Constraints:
- T cannot be in position 1 or 4 → possible positions: 2, 3, or 5.
- C cannot be in position 5 → possible positions: 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- Position 2 is already U.

So:
- Position 2 = U.
- T must be in 3 or 5.
- C must be in 1, 3, or 4 (but 3 could be T or C).

Possible patterns:
1. _ U C _ _  (C in 3, T in 5)
2. _ U _ T _  (T in 4 is invalid, so this is invalid)
3. _ U _ _ C  (C in 5 is invalid)
4. C U _ _ _  (C in 1, T in 3 or 5)
5. _ U C T _  (C in 3, T in 4 is invalid)
6. _ U T _ C  (T in 3, C in 5 is invalid)
7. _ U _ C T  (C in 4, T in 5)

Valid patterns:
- _ U C _ T
- C U _ _ _
- _ U _ C T

Now, we need to pick a word that fits one of these patterns and uses only allowed letters.

Let's try pattern _ U _ C T:
- Position 1: any allowed letter (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z)
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: any allowed letter (but not C or T)
- Position 4: C
- Position 5: T

Looking for common English words:
- ""B U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""D U M P T"" – not a word.
- ""M U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""P U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""G U I C T"" – I is invalid.
- ""F U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""H U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""R U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""W U C K T"" – not a word.

Pattern C U _ _ _:
- C U _ _ _
- C U B B E – E is invalid.
- C U R V E – E is invalid.
- C U R V Y – Y is allowed, but this is 5 letters: C U R V Y – but position 5 is Y, not C.
Wait, pattern is C U _ _ _, so:
- C U B B Y – B is allowed, Y is allowed: ""CUBBY"" is a word.
- C U R V Y – ""CURVY"" is not a standard word.
- C U R T Y – T is in position 4 (invalid), and Y is allowed.

Pattern _ U _ _ C:
- T cannot be in position 5, so this is invalid.
Pattern _ U C _ T:
- ""G U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""H U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""M U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""P U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""R U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""W U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""B U C K T"" – not a word.

Pattern _ U _ C T:
- ""B U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""D U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""F U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""G U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""H U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""J U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""K U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""M U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""P U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""Q U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""R U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""S U C K T"" – S is invalid.
- ""T U C K T"" – T is in position 1 (invalid).
- ""V U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""W U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""X U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""Y U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""Z U C K T"" – not a word.

Pattern C U _ _ _:
- ""CUBBY"" is a valid word: C U B B Y
- Check letters: C, U, B, B, Y – all allowed.
- Check constraints:
  - U is in position 2 (✓)
  - T is not in position 1 or 4, and it's not in this word (but we don't know if T is in the word; we only know T is in the word and not in 1 or 4). Wait, the feedback says T is in the word but not in 1 or 4, so T must be in 3 or 5. In CUBBY, T is not present, so this would contradict the feedback. Therefore CUBBY is invalid.

Wait, we must include T somewhere. So the pattern must include T in 3 or 5.

Let's re-examine:
We have to include T somewhere (not 1 or 4), and C somewhere (not 5).

So possible patterns:
- _ U T _ C  (T in 3, C in 5 – but C cannot be in 5)
- _ U _ T _  (T in 4 – invalid)
- _ U _ _ C  (C in 5 – invalid)
- _ U C T _  (C in 3, T in 4 – invalid)
- _ U _ C T  (C in 4, T in 5)
- C U T _ _  (C in 1, T in 3)
- _ U C _ T  (C in 3, T in 5)

Valid patterns:
- C U T _ _  (C in 1, T in 3)
- _ U C _ T  (C in 3, T in 5)

Looking for words in these patterns:

Pattern C U T _ _:
- C U T B E – E invalid
- C U T B Y – ""CUTBY"" – not a word
- C U T D Y – ""CUTDY"" – not a word
- C U T G Y – ""CUTGY"" – not a word
- C U T H Y – ""CUTHY"" – not a word
- C U T J Y – ""CUTJY"" – not a word
- C U T K Y – ""CUTKY"" – not a word
- C U T M Y – ""CUTMY"" – not a word
- C U T P Y – ""CUTPY"" – not a word
- C U T R Y – ""CUTRY"" – not a word
- C U T V Y – ""CUTVY"" – not a word
- C U T W Y – ""CUTWY"" – not a word
- C U T X Y – ""CUTXY"" – not a word
- C U T Y Y – ""CUTYY"" – not a word
- C U T Z Y – ""CUTZY"" – not a word

Pattern _ U C _ T:
- B U C K T – not a word
- D U C K T – not a word
- F U C K T – not a word
- G U C K T – not a word
- H U C K T – not a word
- J U C K T – not a word
- K U C K T – not a word
- M U C K T – not a word
- P U C K T – not a word
- Q U C K T – not a word
- R U C K T – not a word
- S U C K T – S invalid
- T U C K T – T in 1 invalid
- V U C K T – not a word
- W U C K T – not a word
- X U C K T – not a word
- Y U C K T – not a word
- Z U C K T – not a word

This is problematic. It seems like we're not finding valid words. Let's re-examine the constraints.

Wait, the feedback from TUNIC was T(-) U(✓) N(x) I(x) C(-). This means:
- T is in the word but not in position 1.
- U is in position 2.
- C is in the word but not in position 5.
- N and I are not in the word.

So the word must contain T and C, with:
- U fixed in position 2.
- T not in position 1 or 4.
- C not in position 5.

Possible positions for T: 2, 3, 5 (but 2 is U, so 3 or 5).
Possible positions for C: 1, 3, 4 (but 3 could be T).

So:
- If T is in 3, then C can be in 1 or 4.
- If T is in 5, then C can be in 1, 3, or 4.

Let's list possible patterns:
1. C U T _ _  (C in 1, T in 3)
2. _ U C T _  (C in 3, T in 4 – invalid)
3. _ U T C _  (T in 3, C in 4)
4. _ U _ C T  (C in 4, T in 5)
5. C U _ _ T  (C in 1, T in 5)
6. _ U _ T C  (T in 4 – invalid)

Valid patterns:
- C U T _ _  (C in 1, T in 3)
- _ U T C _  (T in 3, C in 4)
- _ U _ C T  (C in 4, T in 5)
- C U _ _ T  (C in 1, T in 5)

- C U Z W T – not a word
- C U Z X T – not a word
- C U Z Y T – not a word

This is extremely limited. The only valid words we found were ""BUTCH"" and ""DUTCH"" in pattern _ U T C _.

""BUTCH"" and ""DUTCH"" both fit:
- B U T C H: B, U, T, C, H – all allowed letters.
- D U T C H: D, U, T, C, H – all allowed letters.

Between these, ""DUTCH"" is more common and likely the intended word.

<guess>DUTCH</guess>
</think>

Based on the feedback that U is in position 2, T and C are in the word but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively, and ruling out S, L, A, E, N, I, the most logical next guess is:

<guess>DUTCH</guess>",DUTCH,"Summary of what we know so far:

Letters in the word (from feedback):
- U is in position 2 (✓).
- T is in the word but NOT in position 1 or 4 (- twice).
- C is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).

Letters NOT in the word (from feedback):
- S, L, A, E, N, I.

So the word looks like: _ U _ _ _ with T and C somewhere else, and the remaining letters must be chosen from the unused pool: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Constraints:
- T cannot be in position 1 or 4 → possible positions: 2, 3, or 5.
- C cannot be in position 5 → possible positions: 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- Position 2 is already U.

So:
- Position 2 = U.
- T must be in 3 or 5.
- C must be in 1, 3, or 4 (but 3 could be T or C).

Possible patterns:
1. _ U C _ _  (C in 3, T in 5)
2. _ U _ T _  (T in 4 is invalid, so this is invalid)
3. _ U _ _ C  (C in 5 is invalid)
4. C U _ _ _  (C in 1, T in 3 or 5)
5. _ U C T _  (C in 3, T in 4 is invalid)
6. _ U T _ C  (T in 3, C in 5 is invalid)
7. _ U _ C T  (C in 4, T in 5)

Valid patterns:
- _ U C _ T
- C U _ _ _
- _ U _ C T

Now, we need to pick a word that fits one of these patterns and uses only allowed letters.

Let's try pattern _ U _ C T:
- Position 1: any allowed letter (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z)
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: any allowed letter (but not C or T)
- Position 4: C
- Position 5: T

Looking for common English words:
- ""B U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""D U M P T"" – not a word.
- ""M U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""P U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""G U I C T"" – I is invalid.
- ""F U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""H U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""R U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""W U C K T"" – not a word.

Pattern C U _ _ _:
- C U _ _ _
- C U B B E – E is invalid.
- C U R V E – E is invalid.
- C U R V Y – Y is allowed, but this is 5 letters: C U R V Y – but position 5 is Y, not C.
Wait, pattern is C U _ _ _, so:
- C U B B Y – B is allowed, Y is allowed: ""CUBBY"" is a word.
- C U R V Y – ""CURVY"" is not a standard word.
- C U R T Y – T is in position 4 (invalid), and Y is allowed.

Pattern _ U _ _ C:
- T cannot be in position 5, so this is invalid.
Pattern _ U C _ T:
- ""G U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""H U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""M U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""P U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""R U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""W U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""B U C K T"" – not a word.

Pattern _ U _ C T:
- ""B U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""D U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""F U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""G U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""H U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""J U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""K U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""M U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""P U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""Q U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""R U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""S U C K T"" – S is invalid.
- ""T U C K T"" – T is in position 1 (invalid).
- ""V U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""W U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""X U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""Y U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""Z U C K T"" – not a word.

Pattern C U _ _ _:
- ""CUBBY"" is a valid word: C U B B Y
- Check letters: C, U, B, B, Y – all allowed.
- Check constraints:
  - U is in position 2 (✓)
  - T is not in position 1 or 4, and it's not in this word (but we don't know if T is in the word; we only know T is in the word and not in 1 or 4). Wait, the feedback says T is in the word but not in 1 or 4, so T must be in 3 or 5. In CUBBY, T is not present, so this would contradict the feedback. Therefore CUBBY is invalid.

Wait, we must include T somewhere. So the pattern must include T in 3 or 5.

Let's re-examine:
We have to include T somewhere (not 1 or 4), and C somewhere (not 5).

So possible patterns:
- _ U T _ C  (T in 3, C in 5 – but C cannot be in 5)
- _ U _ T _  (T in 4 – invalid)
- _ U _ _ C  (C in 5 – invalid)
- _ U C T _  (C in 3, T in 4 – invalid)
- _ U _ C T  (C in 4, T in 5)
- C U T _ _  (C in 1, T in 3)
- _ U C _ T  (C in 3, T in 5)

Valid patterns:
- C U T _ _  (C in 1, T in 3)
- _ U C _ T  (C in 3, T in 5)

Looking for words in these patterns:

Pattern C U T _ _:
- C U T B E – E invalid
- C U T B Y – ""CUTBY"" – not a word
- C U T D Y – ""CUTDY"" – not a word
- C U T G Y – ""CUTGY"" – not a word
- C U T H Y – ""CUTHY"" – not a word
- C U T J Y – ""CUTJY"" – not a word
- C U T K Y – ""CUTKY"" – not a word
- C U T M Y – ""CUTMY"" – not a word
- C U T P Y – ""CUTPY"" – not a word
- C U T R Y – ""CUTRY"" – not a word
- C U T V Y – ""CUTVY"" – not a word
- C U T W Y – ""CUTWY"" – not a word
- C U T X Y – ""CUTXY"" – not a word
- C U T Y Y – ""CUTYY"" – not a word
- C U T Z Y – ""CUTZY"" – not a word

Pattern _ U C _ T:
- B U C K T – not a word
- D U C K T – not a word
- F U C K T – not a word
- G U C K T – not a word
- H U C K T – not a word
- J U C K T – not a word
- K U C K T – not a word
- M U C K T – not a word
- P U C K T – not a word
- Q U C K T – not a word
- R U C K T – not a word
- S U C K T – S invalid
- T U C K T – T in 1 invalid
- V U C K T – not a word
- W U C K T – not a word
- X U C K T – not a word
- Y U C K T – not a word
- Z U C K T – not a word

This is problematic. It seems like we're not finding valid words. Let's re-examine the constraints.

Wait, the feedback from TUNIC was T(-) U(✓) N(x) I(x) C(-). This means:
- T is in the word but not in position 1.
- U is in position 2.
- C is in the word but not in position 5.
- N and I are not in the word.

So the word must contain T and C, with:
- U fixed in position 2.
- T not in position 1 or 4.
- C not in position 5.

Possible positions for T: 2, 3, 5 (but 2 is U, so 3 or 5).
Possible positions for C: 1, 3, 4 (but 3 could be T).

So:
- If T is in 3, then C can be in 1 or 4.
- If T is in 5, then C can be in 1, 3, or 4.

Let's list possible patterns:
1. C U T _ _  (C in 1, T in 3)
2. _ U C T _  (C in 3, T in 4 – invalid)
3. _ U T C _  (T in 3, C in 4)
4. _ U _ C T  (C in 4, T in 5)
5. C U _ _ T  (C in 1, T in 5)
6. _ U _ T C  (T in 4 – invalid)

This is extremely limited. The only valid words we found were ""BUTCH"" and ""DUTCH"" in pattern _ U T C _.

""BUTCH"" and ""DUTCH"" both fit:
- B U T C H: B, U, T, C, H – all allowed letters.
- D U T C H: D, U, T, C, H – all allowed letters.

Between these, ""DUTCH"" is more common and likely the intended word.

<guess>DUTCH</guess>Based on the feedback that U is in position 2, T and C are in the word but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively, and ruling out S, L, A, E, N, I, the most logical next guess is:",Guess 3: DUTCH -> FEEDBACK: D(x) U(✓) T(✓) C(✓) H(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess should cover as many of these common letters as possible without repeating letters.

Some strong first guesses are:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a very common word and includes 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 very common consonants (S, L, T).

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: x → not in the word
- L: x → not in the word
- A: x → not in the word
- T: - → in the word but not in the 4th position
- E: x → not in the word

So we know:
- The word contains T somewhere, but not in position 4.
- It does NOT contain S, L, A, or E.

Next, I want to try a word that:
1. Includes T in a different position (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).
2. Uses new common letters (since S, L, A, E are ruled out).
3. Uses other frequent consonants and vowels.

Common letters left to try: R, I, N, O, U, C, H, M, P, D, G, etc.

A good candidate is ""TRIUM"" (but that's 5 letters and T is in position 1, which is allowed). However, ""TRIUM"" might not be a valid English word. Another option is ""ROUND"" – it has T? No, it doesn't. ""CRIMP"" – has T? No. ""PRIMO"" – has T? No. ""TUNIC"" – has T in position 1.

""TUNIC"" is a valid word (a garment) and uses:
- T in position 1 (allowed since T wasn't in position 4 before)
- U, N, I, C – all new letters we haven't tried yet.

This seems like a strong next guess.

Summary of what we know so far:

Letters in the word (from feedback):
- U is in position 2 (✓).
- T is in the word but NOT in position 1 or 4 (- twice).
- C is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).

Letters NOT in the word (from feedback):
- S, L, A, E, N, I.

So the word looks like: _ U _ _ _ with T and C somewhere else, and the remaining letters must be chosen from the unused pool: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Constraints:
- T cannot be in position 1 or 4 → possible positions: 2, 3, or 5.
- C cannot be in position 5 → possible positions: 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- Position 2 is already U.

So:
- Position 2 = U.
- T must be in 3 or 5.
- C must be in 1, 3, or 4 (but 3 could be T or C).

Possible patterns:
1. _ U C _ _  (C in 3, T in 5)
2. _ U _ T _  (T in 4 is invalid, so this is invalid)
3. _ U _ _ C  (C in 5 is invalid)
4. C U _ _ _  (C in 1, T in 3 or 5)
5. _ U C T _  (C in 3, T in 4 is invalid)
6. _ U T _ C  (T in 3, C in 5 is invalid)
7. _ U _ C T  (C in 4, T in 5)

Valid patterns:
- _ U C _ T
- C U _ _ _
- _ U _ C T

Now, we need to pick a word that fits one of these patterns and uses only allowed letters.

Let's try pattern _ U _ C T:
- Position 1: any allowed letter (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z)
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: any allowed letter (but not C or T)
- Position 4: C
- Position 5: T

Looking for common English words:
- ""B U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""D U M P T"" – not a word.
- ""M U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""P U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""G U I C T"" – I is invalid.
- ""F U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""H U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""R U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""W U C K T"" – not a word.

Pattern C U _ _ _:
- C U _ _ _
- C U B B E – E is invalid.
- C U R V E – E is invalid.
- C U R V Y – Y is allowed, but this is 5 letters: C U R V Y – but position 5 is Y, not C.
Wait, pattern is C U _ _ _, so:
- C U B B Y – B is allowed, Y is allowed: ""CUBBY"" is a word.
- C U R V Y – ""CURVY"" is not a standard word.
- C U R T Y – T is in position 4 (invalid), and Y is allowed.

Pattern _ U _ _ C:
- T cannot be in position 5, so this is invalid.
Pattern _ U C _ T:
- ""G U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""H U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""M U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""P U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""R U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""W U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""B U C K T"" – not a word.

Pattern _ U _ C T:
- ""B U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""D U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""F U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""G U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""H U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""J U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""K U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""M U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""P U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""Q U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""R U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""S U C K T"" – S is invalid.
- ""T U C K T"" – T is in position 1 (invalid).
- ""V U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""W U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""X U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""Y U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""Z U C K T"" – not a word.

Pattern C U _ _ _:
- ""CUBBY"" is a valid word: C U B B Y
- Check letters: C, U, B, B, Y – all allowed.
- Check constraints:
  - U is in position 2 (✓)
  - T is not in position 1 or 4, and it's not in this word (but we don't know if T is in the word; we only know T is in the word and not in 1 or 4). Wait, the feedback says T is in the word but not in 1 or 4, so T must be in 3 or 5. In CUBBY, T is not present, so this would contradict the feedback. Therefore CUBBY is invalid.

Wait, we must include T somewhere. So the pattern must include T in 3 or 5.

Let's re-examine:
We have to include T somewhere (not 1 or 4), and C somewhere (not 5).

So possible patterns:
- _ U T _ C  (T in 3, C in 5 – but C cannot be in 5)
- _ U _ T _  (T in 4 – invalid)
- _ U _ _ C  (C in 5 – invalid)
- _ U C T _  (C in 3, T in 4 – invalid)
- _ U _ C T  (C in 4, T in 5)
- C U T _ _  (C in 1, T in 3)
- _ U C _ T  (C in 3, T in 5)

Valid patterns:
- C U T _ _  (C in 1, T in 3)
- _ U C _ T  (C in 3, T in 5)

- X U C K T – not a word
- Y U C K T – not a word
- Z U C K T – not a word

This is problematic. It seems like we're not finding valid words. Let's re-examine the constraints.

Wait, the feedback from TUNIC was T(-) U(✓) N(x) I(x) C(-). This means:
- T is in the word but not in position 1.
- U is in position 2.
- C is in the word but not in position 5.
- N and I are not in the word.

So the word must contain T and C, with:
- U fixed in position 2.
- T not in position 1 or 4.
- C not in position 5.

Possible positions for T: 2, 3, 5 (but 2 is U, so 3 or 5).
Possible positions for C: 1, 3, 4 (but 3 could be T).

So:
- If T is in 3, then C can be in 1 or 4.
- If T is in 5, then C can be in 1, 3, or 4.

Let's list possible patterns:
1. C U T _ _  (C in 1, T in 3)
2. _ U C T _  (C in 3, T in 4 – invalid)
3. _ U T C _  (T in 3, C in 4)
4. _ U _ C T  (C in 4, T in 5)
5. C U _ _ T  (C in 1, T in 5)
6. _ U _ T C  (T in 4 – invalid)

Valid patterns:
- C U T _ _  (C in 1, T in 3)
- _ U T C _  (T in 3, C in 4)
- _ U _ C T  (C in 4, T in 5)
- C U _ _ T  (C in 1, T in 5)

This is extremely limited. The only valid words we found were ""BUTCH"" and ""DUTCH"" in pattern _ U T C _.

""BUTCH"" and ""DUTCH"" both fit:
- B U T C H: B, U, T, C, H – all allowed letters.
- D U T C H: D, U, T, C, H – all allowed letters.

Between these, ""DUTCH"" is more common and likely the intended word.

<guess>DUTCH</guess>Based on the feedback that U is in position 2, T and C are in the word but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively, and ruling out S, L, A, E, N, I, the most logical next guess is:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess should cover as many of these common letters as possible without repeating letters.

Some strong first guesses are:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a very common word and includes 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 very common consonants (S, L, T).

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: x → not in the word
- L: x → not in the word
- A: x → not in the word
- T: - → in the word but not in the 4th position
- E: x → not in the word

So we know:
- The word contains T somewhere, but not in position 4.
- It does NOT contain S, L, A, or E.

Next, I want to try a word that:
1. Includes T in a different position (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).
2. Uses new common letters (since S, L, A, E are ruled out).
3. Uses other frequent consonants and vowels.

Common letters left to try: R, I, N, O, U, C, H, M, P, D, G, etc.

A good candidate is ""TRIUM"" (but that's 5 letters and T is in position 1, which is allowed). However, ""TRIUM"" might not be a valid English word. Another option is ""ROUND"" – it has T? No, it doesn't. ""CRIMP"" – has T? No. ""PRIMO"" – has T? No. ""TUNIC"" – has T in position 1.

""TUNIC"" is a valid word (a garment) and uses:
- T in position 1 (allowed since T wasn't in position 4 before)
- U, N, I, C – all new letters we haven't tried yet.

This seems like a strong next guess.

Summary of what we know so far:

Letters in the word (from feedback):
- U is in position 2 (✓).
- T is in the word but NOT in position 1 or 4 (- twice).
- C is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).

Letters NOT in the word (from feedback):
- S, L, A, E, N, I.

So the word looks like: _ U _ _ _ with T and C somewhere else, and the remaining letters must be chosen from the unused pool: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Constraints:
- T cannot be in position 1 or 4 → possible positions: 2, 3, or 5.
- C cannot be in position 5 → possible positions: 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- Position 2 is already U.

So:
- Position 2 = U.
- T must be in 3 or 5.
- C must be in 1, 3, or 4 (but 3 could be T or C).

Possible patterns:
1. _ U C _ _  (C in 3, T in 5)
2. _ U _ T _  (T in 4 is invalid, so this is invalid)
3. _ U _ _ C  (C in 5 is invalid)
4. C U _ _ _  (C in 1, T in 3 or 5)
5. _ U C T _  (C in 3, T in 4 is invalid)
6. _ U T _ C  (T in 3, C in 5 is invalid)
7. _ U _ C T  (C in 4, T in 5)

Valid patterns:
- _ U C _ T
- C U _ _ _
- _ U _ C T

Now, we need to pick a word that fits one of these patterns and uses only allowed letters.

Let's try pattern _ U _ C T:
- Position 1: any allowed letter (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z)
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: any allowed letter (but not C or T)
- Position 4: C
- Position 5: T

Looking for common English words:
- ""B U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""D U M P T"" – not a word.
- ""M U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""P U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""G U I C T"" – I is invalid.
- ""F U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""H U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""R U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""W U C K T"" – not a word.

Pattern C U _ _ _:
- C U _ _ _
- C U B B E – E is invalid.
- C U R V E – E is invalid.
- C U R V Y – Y is allowed, but this is 5 letters: C U R V Y – but position 5 is Y, not C.
Wait, pattern is C U _ _ _, so:
- C U B B Y – B is allowed, Y is allowed: ""CUBBY"" is a word.
- C U R V Y – ""CURVY"" is not a standard word.
- C U R T Y – T is in position 4 (invalid), and Y is allowed.

Pattern _ U _ _ C:
- T cannot be in position 5, so this is invalid.
Pattern _ U C _ T:
- ""G U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""H U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""M U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""P U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""R U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""W U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""B U C K T"" – not a word.

Pattern _ U _ C T:
- ""B U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""D U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""F U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""G U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""H U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""J U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""K U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""M U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""P U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""Q U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""R U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""S U C K T"" – S is invalid.
- ""T U C K T"" – T is in position 1 (invalid).
- ""V U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""W U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""X U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""Y U C K T"" – not a word.
- ""Z U C K T"" – not a word.

Pattern C U _ _ _:
- ""CUBBY"" is a valid word: C U B B Y
- Check letters: C, U, B, B, Y – all allowed.
- Check constraints:
  - U is in position 2 (✓)
  - T is not in position 1 or 4, and it's not in this word (but we don't know if T is in the word; we only know T is in the word and not in 1 or 4). Wait, the feedback says T is in the word but not in 1 or 4, so T must be in 3 or 5. In CUBBY, T is not present, so this would contradict the feedback. Therefore CUBBY is invalid.

Wait, we must include T somewhere. So the pattern must include T in 3 or 5.

Let's re-examine:
We have to include T somewhere (not 1 or 4), and C somewhere (not 5).

So possible patterns:
- _ U T _ C  (T in 3, C in 5 – but C cannot be in 5)
- _ U _ T _  (T in 4 – invalid)
- _ U _ _ C  (C in 5 – invalid)
- _ U C T _  (C in 3, T in 4 – invalid)
- _ U _ C T  (C in 4, T in 5)
- C U T _ _  (C in 1, T in 3)
- _ U C _ T  (C in 3, T in 5)

Valid patterns:
- C U T _ _  (C in 1, T in 3)
- _ U C _ T  (C in 3, T in 5)

Looking for words in these patterns:

Pattern C U T _ _:
- C U T B E – E invalid
- C U T B Y – ""CUTBY"" – not a word
- C U T D Y – ""CUTDY"" – not a word
- C U T G Y – ""CUTGY"" – not a word
- C U T H Y – ""CUTHY"" – not a word
- C U T J Y – ""CUTJY"" – not a word
- C U T K Y – ""CUTKY"" – not a word
- C U T M Y – ""CUTMY"" – not a word
- C U T P Y – ""CUTPY"" – not a word
- C U T R Y – ""CUTRY"" – not a word
- C U T V Y – ""CUTVY"" – not a word
- C U T W Y – ""CUTWY"" – not a word
- C U T X Y – ""CUTXY"" – not a word
- C U T Y Y – ""CUTYY"" – not a word
- C U T Z Y – ""CUTZY"" – not a word

Pattern _ U C _ T:
- B U C K T – not a word
- D U C K T – not a word
- F U C K T – not a word
- G U C K T – not a word
- H U C K T – not a word
- J U C K T – not a word
- K U C K T – not a word
- M U C K T – not a word
- P U C K T – not a word
- Q U C K T – not a word
- R U C K T – not a word
- S U C K T – S invalid
- T U C K T – T in 1 invalid
- V U C K T – not a word
- W U C K T – not a word
- X U C K T – not a word
- Y U C K T – not a word
- Z U C K T – not a word

This is problematic. It seems like we're not finding valid words. Let's re-examine the constraints.

Wait, the feedback from TUNIC was T(-) U(✓) N(x) I(x) C(-). This means:
- T is in the word but not in position 1.
- U is in position 2.
- C is in the word but not in position 5.
- N and I are not in the word.

So the word must contain T and C, with:
- U fixed in position 2.
- T not in position 1 or 4.
- C not in position 5.

Possible positions for T: 2, 3, 5 (but 2 is U, so 3 or 5).
Possible positions for C: 1, 3, 4 (but 3 could be T).

So:
- If T is in 3, then C can be in 1 or 4.
- If T is in 5, then C can be in 1, 3, or 4.

Let's list possible patterns:
1. C U T _ _  (C in 1, T in 3)
2. _ U C T _  (C in 3, T in 4 – invalid)
3. _ U T C _  (T in 3, C in 4)
4. _ U _ C T  (C in 4, T in 5)
5. C U _ _ T  (C in 1, T in 5)
6. _ U _ T C  (T in 4 – invalid)

Valid patterns:
- C U T _ _  (C in 1, T in 3)
- _ U T C _  (T in 3, C in 4)
- _ U _ C T  (C in 4, T in 5)
- C U _ _ T  (C in 1, T in 5)

This is extremely limited. The only valid words we found were ""BUTCH"" and ""DUTCH"" in pattern _ U T C _.

""BUTCH"" and ""DUTCH"" both fit:
- B U T C H: B, U, T, C, H – all allowed letters.
- D U T C H: D, U, T, C, H – all allowed letters.

Between these, ""DUTCH"" is more common and likely the intended word.

<guess>DUTCH</guess>Based on the feedback that U is in position 2, T and C are in the word but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively, and ruling out S, L, A, E, N, I, the most logical next guess is:

<guess>DUTCH</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)
Guess 2: TUNIC -> FEEDBACK: T(-) U(✓) N(x) I(x) C(-)
Guess 3: DUTCH -> FEEDBACK: D(x) U(✓) T(✓) C(✓) H(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:

Guess 3: DUTCH → D(x) U(✓) T(✓) C(✓) H(✓)

This tells us:

- D is not in the word.
- U is in position 2 (✓).
- T is in position 3 (✓).
- C is in position 4 (✓).
- H is in position 5 (✓).

So the word structure is: _ U T C H.

We only need to determine the first letter.  
Letters already ruled out: S, L, A, E, N, I, D.

Common consonants for the first letter: B, F, G, J, K, M, P, R, V, W, Y, Z.

Possible valid 5-letter words ending in ""UTCH"":

- BUTCH
- GUTCH (not a word)
- HUTCH
- JUTCH (not a word)
- KUTCH (not a word)
- MUTCH (not a word)
- PITCH (but ends in ""ITCH"", not ""UTCH"")
- RUTCH (not a word)
- VUTCH (not a word)
- WUTCH (not a word)
- YUTCH (not a word)
- ZUTCH (not a word)

The only common English word that fits is ""BUTCH"".

Therefore, the secret word must be BUTCH.

This confirms the exact pattern _ U T C H, but now we know B is not the first letter.  
We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with any letter except S, L, A, E, N, I, D, B, and ends with U T C H.

Letters still allowed for the first position:
