### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word with multiple vowels and consonants that appear frequently. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify or eliminate vowels quickly
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English

This should give me good feedback on many of the most common letters in English words, helping narrow down possibilities efficiently.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we now know:
1. The word does NOT contain A, R, S, E.
2. The word DOES contain O, but not in position 3.
3. The remaining letters to consider (common ones) are B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A good second guess should:
- Keep the O in a different position (not 3rd).
- Use new common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out.
- Avoid any of A, R, S, E.

Possible candidate words:
- BLOWN (B, L, O, W, N) – uses new letters and keeps O in position 3 is avoided (here O is 2nd).
- CLOUD (C, L, O, U, D) – similar reasoning.
- DITCH (D, I, T, C, H) – avoids all ruled-out letters and introduces I, T, C, H.

Let’s pick CLOUD because:
- It keeps O in position 2 (not 3rd).
- It introduces C, L, U, D which are all still in play.
- It avoids every ruled-out letter (A, R, S, E).

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, L, U, D  
Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions:  
- O (cannot be in positions 3 or 4)  
- C (cannot be in position 1)

So the word:
- Contains O and C  
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E, L, U, D  
- O is not in positions 3 or 4 → possible positions: 1, 2, 5  
- C is not in position 1 → possible positions: 2, 3, 4, 5  

We also need three more letters that haven’t been ruled out. Common remaining consonants: B, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, T, V, W, Y  
Common remaining vowels: I (only vowel left besides O)

A good next guess should:
- Use O and C in allowed positions  
- Introduce new common letters  
- Avoid every ruled-out letter

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word with multiple vowels and consonants that appear frequently. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify or eliminate vowels quickly
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English

This should give me good feedback on many of the most common letters in English words, helping narrow down possibilities efficiently.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we now know:
1. The word does NOT contain A, R, S, E.
2. The word DOES contain O, but not in position 3.
3. The remaining letters to consider (common ones) are B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A good second guess should:
- Keep the O in a different position (not 3rd).
- Use new common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out.
- Avoid any of A, R, S, E.

Possible candidate words:
- BLOWN (B, L, O, W, N) – uses new letters and keeps O in position 3 is avoided (here O is 2nd).
- CLOUD (C, L, O, U, D) – similar reasoning.
- DITCH (D, I, T, C, H) – avoids all ruled-out letters and introduces I, T, C, H.

Let’s pick CLOUD because:
- It keeps O in position 2 (not 3rd).
- It introduces C, L, U, D which are all still in play.
- It avoids every ruled-out letter (A, R, S, E).

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   – A, R, S, E are not in the word at all.
   – O is in the word but not in position 3.

2. CLOUD → C(-) L(x) O(-) U(x) D(x)
   – C is in the word but not in position 1.
   – L, U, D are not in the word.
   – O is in the word but not in position 3 again (consistent with earlier).

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, L, U, D
- Letters that ARE in the word: C, O
- Positions we have ruled out for C: 1
- Positions we have ruled out for O: 3

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both C and O
- Does NOT contain any of A, R, S, E, L, U, D
- Places C somewhere other than position 1
- Places O somewhere other than position 3

Good remaining consonants to try: B, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, T, V, W, Y
Good remaining vowels: I, O (O already confirmed), plus Y sometimes functions as vowel.

Let’s brainstorm words:
- B O C K Y (but K and Y are allowed, but let’s check positions: C is 3rd, O is 2nd – both allowed so far)
- C O W N Y (but C is 1st, which is ruled out)
- C O B B Y (C 1st again ruled out)
- C O M B Y (C 1st ruled out)
- P O C K Y (C 3rd, O 2nd – both allowed)
- B O C K S (but S is ruled out)
- P O C H Y (C 3rd, O 2nd – both allowed)
- M O C K Y (C 3rd, O 2nd – both allowed)
- N O C K Y (C 3rd, O 2nd – both allowed)

Let’s pick one that uses fresh letters and fits all constraints. “PICKY” uses P, I, C, K, Y – none of which are ruled out, and C is 3rd, O isn’t used here. Wait, we must use O. Let’s pick “POCKY”:
- P, O, C, K, Y
- Contains O (2nd position, allowed)
- Contains C (3rd position, allowed)
- No ruled-out letters
- All letters allowed

So POCKY is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word with multiple vowels and consonants that appear frequently. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify or eliminate vowels quickly
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English

This should give me good feedback on many of the most common letters in English words, helping narrow down possibilities efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we now know:
1. The word does NOT contain A, R, S, E.
2. The word DOES contain O, but not in position 3.
3. The remaining letters to consider (common ones) are B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A good second guess should:
- Keep the O in a different position (not 3rd).
- Use new common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out.
- Avoid any of A, R, S, E.

Possible candidate words:
- BLOWN (B, L, O, W, N) – uses new letters and keeps O in position 3 is avoided (here O is 2nd).
- CLOUD (C, L, O, U, D) – similar reasoning.
- DITCH (D, I, T, C, H) – avoids all ruled-out letters and introduces I, T, C, H.

Let’s pick CLOUD because:
- It keeps O in position 2 (not 3rd).
- It introduces C, L, U, D which are all still in play.
- It avoids every ruled-out letter (A, R, S, E).

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word with multiple vowels and consonants that appear frequently. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify or eliminate vowels quickly
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English

This should give me good feedback on many of the most common letters in English words, helping narrow down possibilities efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we now know:
1. The word does NOT contain A, R, S, E.
2. The word DOES contain O, but not in position 3.
3. The remaining letters to consider (common ones) are B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A good second guess should:
- Keep the O in a different position (not 3rd).
- Use new common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out.
- Avoid any of A, R, S, E.

Possible candidate words:
- BLOWN (B, L, O, W, N) – uses new letters and keeps O in position 3 is avoided (here O is 2nd).
- CLOUD (C, L, O, U, D) – similar reasoning.
- DITCH (D, I, T, C, H) – avoids all ruled-out letters and introduces I, T, C, H.

Let’s pick CLOUD because:
- It keeps O in position 2 (not 3rd).
- It introduces C, L, U, D which are all still in play.
- It avoids every ruled-out letter (A, R, S, E).

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   – A, R, S, E are not in the word at all.
   – O is in the word but not in position 3.

2. CLOUD → C(-) L(x) O(-) U(x) D(x)
   – C is in the word but not in position 1.
   – L, U, D are not in the word.
   – O is in the word but not in position 3 again (consistent with earlier).

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, L, U, D
- Letters that ARE in the word: C, O
- Positions we have ruled out for C: 1
- Positions we have ruled out for O: 3

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both C and O
- Does NOT contain any of A, R, S, E, L, U, D
- Places C somewhere other than position 1
- Places O somewhere other than position 3

Good remaining consonants to try: B, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, T, V, W, Y
Good remaining vowels: I, O (O already confirmed), plus Y sometimes functions as vowel.

Let’s brainstorm words:
- B O C K Y (but K and Y are allowed, but let’s check positions: C is 3rd, O is 2nd – both allowed so far)
- C O W N Y (but C is 1st, which is ruled out)
- C O B B Y (C 1st again ruled out)
- C O M B Y (C 1st ruled out)
- P O C K Y (C 3rd, O 2nd – both allowed)
- B O C K S (but S is ruled out)
- P O C H Y (C 3rd, O 2nd – both allowed)
- M O C K Y (C 3rd, O 2nd – both allowed)
- N O C K Y (C 3rd, O 2nd – both allowed)

Let’s pick one that uses fresh letters and fits all constraints. “PICKY” uses P, I, C, K, Y – none of which are ruled out, and C is 3rd, O isn’t used here. Wait, we must use O. Let’s pick “POCKY”:
- P, O, C, K, Y
- Contains O (2nd position, allowed)
- Contains C (3rd position, allowed)
- No ruled-out letters
- All letters allowed

So POCKY is a valid next guess.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   – Letters not in the word: A, R, S, E
   – O is in the word but not in position 3.

2. CLOUD → C(-) L(x) O(-) U(x) D(x)
   – Letters not in the word: L, U, D
   – C is in the word but not in position 1.
   – O is in the word but not in position 3 (consistent with above).

3. POCKY → P(x) O(✓) C(-) K(x) Y(x)
   – Letters not in the word: P, K, Y
   – O is in the word and is in the correct position 2.
   – C is in the word but not in position 3.

So we now know:
- Word has the pattern: _ O _ _ _
- Contains C, but C cannot be in positions 1 or 3 → C must be in position 4 or 5.
- Cannot contain: A, R, S, E, L, U, D, P, K, Y

We need a 5-letter word that:

Let’s summarize everything we now know after five guesses.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   – Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E  
   – O is in the word but NOT in position 3.

2. CLOUD → C(-) L(x) O(-) U(x) D(x)  
   – Letters NOT in the word: L, U, D  
   – C is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
   – O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (consistent with above).

3. POCKY → P(x) O(✓) C(-) K(x) Y(x)  
   – Letters NOT in the word: P, K, Y  
   – O is in position 2 (✓).  
   – C is in the word but NOT in position 3.

4. BOINC → B(x) O(✓) I(-) N(-) C(✓)  
   – Letters NOT in the word: B  
   – O is in position 2 (✓).  
   – I is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   – N is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
   – C is in the word and is in the correct position 5.

So the word looks like: _ O _ _ C  
Letters already confirmed: O in 2, C in 5  
Letters known to be in the word but whose positions are still unknown: I, N  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, S, E, L, U, D, P, K, Y, B  

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Has the pattern: _ O _ _ C  
- Contains both I and N somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (but not where the feedback ruled them out: I not in 3, N not in 4)  
- Uses only the allowed letters (no A, R, S, E, L, U, D, P, K, Y, B)

Allowed remaining letters: C, F, G, H, I, M, N, T, V, W, plus the vowels O (already placed) and the new consonants.

We need to place I and N in positions 1, 3, or 4, with the constraints:
- I cannot be in position 3  
- N cannot be in position 4  

Possible placements:
- I in 1, N in 3 or 4 (but N cannot be in 4 → N in 3) → pattern: I O N _ C  
- I in 3 (but I cannot be in 3) → invalid  
- I in 4, N in 1 or 3 → pattern: N O _ I C or _ O N I C (but N cannot be in 4, which is already satisfied)

So the only valid pattern is I O N _ C or N O _ I C.

Looking for valid English words:
- I O N _ C → IONIC (but I is in position 1, O in 2, N in 3, I in 4, C in 5) – but we already have C in 5, and we need a 5-letter word. IONIC fits the pattern _ O _ _ C? No, IONIC is I O N I C – positions: 1-I, 2-O, 3-N, 4-I, 5-C. This fits _ O _ _ C (positions 1,3,4 are I, N, I), and it uses only allowed letters. But we have to check if IONIC uses any forbidden letters: A,R,S,E,L,U,D,P,K,Y,B – none. So IONIC is a candidate.

- N O _ I C → NO...IC – possible words: NOVIC (but NOVIC isn’t a common word), NOMIC (not common), etc. IONIC seems the best.

Thus, the next logical guess is IONIC.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)

   – O is in the word but NOT in position 3.

2. CLOUD → C(-) L(x) O(-) U(x) D(x)  
   – Letters NOT in the word: L, U, D  
   – C is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
   – O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (consistent with above).

3. POCKY → P(x) O(✓) C(-) K(x) Y(x)  
   – Letters NOT in the word: P, K, Y  
   – O is in position 2 (✓).  
   – C is in the word but NOT in position 3.

4. BOINC → B(x) O(✓) I(-) N(-) C(✓)  
   – Letters NOT in the word: B  
   – O is in position 2 (✓).  
   – I is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   – N is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
   – C is in the word and is in the correct position 5.

So the word looks like: _ O _ _ C  
Letters already confirmed: O in 2, C in 5  
Letters known to be in the word but whose positions are still unknown: I, N  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, S, E, L, U, D, P, K, Y, B  

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Has the pattern: _ O _ _ C  
- Contains both I and N somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (but not where the feedback ruled them out: I not in 3, N not in 4)  
- Uses only the allowed letters (no A, R, S, E, L, U, D, P, K, Y, B)

Allowed remaining letters: C, F, G, H, I, M, N, T, V, W, plus the vowels O (already placed) and the new consonants.

We need to place I and N in positions 1, 3, or 4, with the constraints:
- I cannot be in position 3  
- N cannot be in position 4  

Possible placements:
- I in 1, N in 3 or 4 (but N cannot be in 4 → N in 3) → pattern: I O N _ C  
- I in 3 (but I cannot be in 3) → invalid  
- I in 4, N in 1 or 3 → pattern: N O _ I C or _ O N I C (but N cannot be in 4, which is already satisfied)

So the only valid pattern is I O N _ C or N O _ I C.

Looking for valid English words:
- I O N _ C → IONIC (but I is in position 1, O in 2, N in 3, I in 4, C in 5) – but we already have C in 5, and we need a 5-letter word. IONIC fits the pattern _ O _ _ C? No, IONIC is I O N I C – positions: 1-I, 2-O, 3-N, 4-I, 5-C. This fits _ O _ _ C (positions 1,3,4 are I, N, I), and it uses only allowed letters. But we have to check if IONIC uses any forbidden letters: A,R,S,E,L,U,D,P,K,Y,B – none. So IONIC is a candidate.

- N O _ I C → NO...IC – possible words: NOVIC (but NOVIC isn’t a common word), NOMIC (not common), etc. IONIC seems the best.

Thus, the next logical guess is IONIC.",Guess 6: IONIC -> FEEDBACK: I(✓) O(✓) N(✓) I(✓) C(✓),SUCCESS
