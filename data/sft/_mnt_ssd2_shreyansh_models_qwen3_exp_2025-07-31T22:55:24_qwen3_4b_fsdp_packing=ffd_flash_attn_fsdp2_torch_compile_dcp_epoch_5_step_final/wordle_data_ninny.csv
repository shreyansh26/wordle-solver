For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good starting word should have frequently used vowels and consonants. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" uses S, L, A, T, E (common letters)
- ""CRANE"" uses C, R, A, N, E
- ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E
- ""ADIEU"" uses A, D, I, E, U (good for vowels)

I think ""SLATE"" is a strong choice because it includes very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and can help identify vowels and consonants early. This should give me good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good starting word should have frequently used vowels and consonants. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" uses S, L, A, T, E (common letters)
- ""CRANE"" uses C, R, A, N, E
- ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E
- ""ADIEU"" uses A, D, I, E, U (good for vowels)

I think ""SLATE"" is a strong choice because it includes very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and can help identify vowels and consonants early. This should give me good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a large chunk of the alphabet.  
Now I need a fresh set of common letters that aren’t in SLATE.  
The most frequent letters in English are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C.  
Since S, L, A, T are out, I’ll pick from the remaining: E, R, O, N, I, C, U, D, P, M, etc.

I want a word that:
- Uses new, common letters
- Doesn’t repeat any letters
- Has a good chance of hitting vowels or common consonants

A good candidate is “CRONE”:
- C, R, O, N, E – all new letters
- Contains two vowels (O, E) and three consonants (C, R, N)
- Common in English
- Doesn’t repeat any letters

This should give me information about C, R, O, N, E.

From the feedback so far:
- SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)  
  → None of S, L, A, T, E appear in the secret word.

- CRONE → C(x) R(x) O(x) N(✓) E(x)  
  → N is the only letter that is correct and in the correct position.

So far we know:
- The word is 5 letters long.
- The 4th letter is N.
- The letters S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O are NOT in the word at all.

Remaining common letters (excluding the eliminated ones):  
D, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has N in the 4th position.
2. Uses only letters not yet eliminated.
3. Uses common letters to maximize information.

Candidate words:
- MOUND (M, O, U, N, D) – but O is eliminated.
- POUND (P, O, U, N, D) – O is eliminated.
- HOUND (H, O, U, N, D) – O is eliminated.
- WOUND (W, O, U, N, D) – O is eliminated.
- MOUND, POUND, etc., all use O which is out.

Next candidate:  
- MINDY (M, I, N, D, Y) – uses M, I, N, D, Y (all allowed).  
- PINGY (P, I, N, G, Y) – uses P, I, N, G, Y (all allowed).  
- MINGY (M, I, N, G, Y) – same letters.

Among these, ""PINGY"" uses P, I, N, G, Y – all allowed and common.

Current known facts:
1. Pattern: _ I N _ Y (positions 2,3,5 are fixed as I, N, Y)
2. Eliminated letters so far: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, P, G, M, D
3. Still allowed letters: B, F, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, etc. (plus any others not yet listed)
4. We need two more consonants for positions 1 and 4 from the remaining allowed set.

Candidate words fitting _ I N _ Y:
- FIN DY → F, I, N, D, Y – but D is already eliminated.
- BIN DY → B, I, N, D, Y – D is eliminated.
- VIN DY → V, I, N, D, Y – D is eliminated.
- HIN DY → H, I, N, D, Y – D is eliminated.
- KIN DY → K, I, N, D, Y – D is eliminated.
- WIN DY → W, I, N, D, Y – D is eliminated.
- JIN DY → J, I, N, D, Y – D is eliminated.
- YIN DY → Y, I, N, D, Y – D is eliminated.
- BIN DY → B, I, N, D, Y – D is eliminated.
- VIN DY → V, I, N, D, Y – D is eliminated.

Wait, all these have D in position 4, which is eliminated. So we need a different letter for position 4.

Allowed letters for position 4: B, F, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, etc.

Possible combinations:
- F I N U Y → F, I, N, U, Y – all allowed.
- B I N U Y → B, I, N, U, Y – all allowed.
- V I N U Y → V, I, N, U, Y – all allowed.
- H I N U Y → H, I, N, U, Y – all allowed.

Among these, ""FINUY"" is not a valid English word. ""BINUY"" is not valid. ""VINUY"" is not valid. ""HINUY"" is not valid.

Another approach: look for actual English words of the form _ I N _ Y.

Possible valid words:
- FIN DY – but D is eliminated.
- MIN DY – D is eliminated.
- BIN DY – D is eliminated.
- VIN DY – D is eliminated.
- HIN DY – D is eliminated.
- KIN DY – D is eliminated.
- WIN DY – D is eliminated.

Hmm, seems like D is the only remaining consonant for position 4, but D is eliminated. This suggests we need to re-examine allowed letters.

Wait, position 4: allowed letters are any not eliminated. From earlier eliminations: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, P, G, M, D are out. So position 4 can be B, F, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, etc.

Looking for valid English words:
- FIN UY – not a word.
- BIN UY – not a word.
- VIN UY – not a word.
- HIN UY – not a word.

Another candidate: ""FINNY"" – but Y is already in position 5, and double Y is possible. However, ""FINNY"" would be F, I, N, N, Y – but we have N in position 3, and double N is allowed. However, we have no information about double letters yet.

""FINNY"" uses F, I, N, N, Y – all letters allowed (F, I, N, Y not eliminated, and N is allowed to repeat).

This seems like a valid guess.

But let's check if there are other possibilities. Another candidate: ""HINNY"" – H, I, N, N, Y – all allowed.

Between ""FINNY"" and ""HINNY"", ""FINNY"" is more common.

Let's choose ""FINNY"".

- B I N U Y → B, I, N, U, Y – all allowed.
- V I N U Y → V, I, N, U, Y – all allowed.
- H I N U Y → H, I, N, U, Y – all allowed.

Among these, ""FINUY"" is not a valid English word. ""BINUY"" is not valid. ""VINUY"" is not valid. ""HINUY"" is not valid.

Another approach: look for actual English words of the form _ I N _ Y.

Possible valid words:
- FIN DY – but D is eliminated.
- MIN DY – D is eliminated.
- BIN DY – D is eliminated.
- VIN DY – D is eliminated.
- HIN DY – D is eliminated.
- KIN DY – D is eliminated.
- WIN DY – D is eliminated.

Hmm, seems like D is the only remaining consonant for position 4, but D is eliminated. This suggests we need to re-examine allowed letters.

Wait, position 4: allowed letters are any not eliminated. From earlier eliminations: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, P, G, M, D are out. So position 4 can be B, F, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, etc.

Looking for valid English words:
- FIN UY – not a word.
- BIN UY – not a word.
- VIN UY – not a word.
- HIN UY – not a word.

Another candidate: ""FINNY"" – but Y is already in position 5, and double Y is possible. However, ""FINNY"" would be F, I, N, N, Y – but we have N in position 3, and double N is allowed. However, we have no information about double letters yet.

""FINNY"" uses F, I, N, N, Y – all letters allowed (F, I, N, Y not eliminated, and N is allowed to repeat).

This seems like a valid guess.

But let's check if there are other possibilities. Another candidate: ""HINNY"" – H, I, N, N, Y – all allowed.

Between ""FINNY"" and ""HINNY"", ""FINNY"" is more common.

Let's choose ""FINNY"".",Guess 5: FINNY -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(✓) N(✓) N(✓) Y(✓),FAIL

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good starting word should have frequently used vowels and consonants. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" uses S, L, A, T, E (common letters)
- ""CRANE"" uses C, R, A, N, E
- ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E
- ""ADIEU"" uses A, D, I, E, U (good for vowels)

I think ""SLATE"" is a strong choice because it includes very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and can help identify vowels and consonants early. This should give me good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a large chunk of the alphabet.  
Now I need a fresh set of common letters that aren’t in SLATE.  
The most frequent letters in English are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C.  
Since S, L, A, T are out, I’ll pick from the remaining: E, R, O, N, I, C, U, D, P, M, etc.

I want a word that:
- Uses new, common letters
- Doesn’t repeat any letters
- Has a good chance of hitting vowels or common consonants

A good candidate is “CRONE”:
- C, R, O, N, E – all new letters
- Contains two vowels (O, E) and three consonants (C, R, N)
- Common in English
- Doesn’t repeat any letters

This should give me information about C, R, O, N, E.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CRONE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) O(x) N(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:
- SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)  
  → None of S, L, A, T, E appear in the secret word.

- CRONE → C(x) R(x) O(x) N(✓) E(x)  
  → N is the only letter that is correct and in the correct position.

So far we know:
- The word is 5 letters long.
- The 4th letter is N.
- The letters S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O are NOT in the word at all.

Remaining common letters (excluding the eliminated ones):  
D, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has N in the 4th position.
2. Uses only letters not yet eliminated.
3. Uses common letters to maximize information.

Candidate words:
- MOUND (M, O, U, N, D) – but O is eliminated.
- POUND (P, O, U, N, D) – O is eliminated.
- HOUND (H, O, U, N, D) – O is eliminated.
- WOUND (W, O, U, N, D) – O is eliminated.
- MOUND, POUND, etc., all use O which is out.

Next candidate:  
- MINDY (M, I, N, D, Y) – uses M, I, N, D, Y (all allowed).  
- PINGY (P, I, N, G, Y) – uses P, I, N, G, Y (all allowed).  
- MINGY (M, I, N, G, Y) – same letters.

Among these, ""PINGY"" uses P, I, N, G, Y – all allowed and common.

Let’s go with PINGY.

From the new feedback:

PINGY → P(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(x) Y(✓)

Interpretation:
- P, G are NOT in the word (x).
- I is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So far we know:
- The word is _ I N _ Y
- Letters already eliminated: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, P, G
- Still allowed letters: D, F, H, K, M, U, V, W, B, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has the pattern _ I N _ Y
2. Uses only letters not yet eliminated.
3. Uses common letters to maximize information.

Candidate words:
- MIN DY (M, I, N, D, Y) – D is still allowed.
- FIN DY (F, I, N, D, Y) – F and D still allowed.
- BIN DY (B, I, N, D, Y) – B and D still allowed.
- VIN DY (V, I, N, D, Y) – V and D still allowed.
- MIN DY seems the most common.

Let’s choose MIN DY.

Current known facts:
1. Pattern: _ I N _ Y (positions 2,3,5 are fixed as I, N, Y)
2. Eliminated letters so far: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, P, G, M, D
3. Still allowed letters: B, F, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, etc. (plus any others not yet listed)
4. We need two more consonants for positions 1 and 4 from the remaining allowed set.

Candidate words fitting _ I N _ Y:
- FIN DY → F, I, N, D, Y – but D is already eliminated.
- BIN DY → B, I, N, D, Y – D is eliminated.
- VIN DY → V, I, N, D, Y – D is eliminated.
- HIN DY → H, I, N, D, Y – D is eliminated.
- KIN DY → K, I, N, D, Y – D is eliminated.
- WIN DY → W, I, N, D, Y – D is eliminated.
- JIN DY → J, I, N, D, Y – D is eliminated.
- YIN DY → Y, I, N, D, Y – D is eliminated.
- BIN DY → B, I, N, D, Y – D is eliminated.
- VIN DY → V, I, N, D, Y – D is eliminated.

Wait, all these have D in position 4, which is eliminated. So we need a different letter for position 4.

Allowed letters for position 4: B, F, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, etc.

Possible combinations:
- F I N U Y → F, I, N, U, Y – all allowed.
- B I N U Y → B, I, N, U, Y – all allowed.
- V I N U Y → V, I, N, U, Y – all allowed.
- H I N U Y → H, I, N, U, Y – all allowed.

Among these, ""FINUY"" is not a valid English word. ""BINUY"" is not valid. ""VINUY"" is not valid. ""HINUY"" is not valid.

Another approach: look for actual English words of the form _ I N _ Y.

Possible valid words:
- FIN DY – but D is eliminated.
- MIN DY – D is eliminated.
- BIN DY – D is eliminated.
- VIN DY – D is eliminated.
- HIN DY – D is eliminated.
- KIN DY – D is eliminated.
- WIN DY – D is eliminated.

Hmm, seems like D is the only remaining consonant for position 4, but D is eliminated. This suggests we need to re-examine allowed letters.

Wait, position 4: allowed letters are any not eliminated. From earlier eliminations: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, P, G, M, D are out. So position 4 can be B, F, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, etc.

Looking for valid English words:
- FIN UY – not a word.
- BIN UY – not a word.
- VIN UY – not a word.
- HIN UY – not a word.

Another candidate: ""FINNY"" – but Y is already in position 5, and double Y is possible. However, ""FINNY"" would be F, I, N, N, Y – but we have N in position 3, and double N is allowed. However, we have no information about double letters yet.

""FINNY"" uses F, I, N, N, Y – all letters allowed (F, I, N, Y not eliminated, and N is allowed to repeat).

This seems like a valid guess.

But let's check if there are other possibilities. Another candidate: ""HINNY"" – H, I, N, N, Y – all allowed.

Between ""FINNY"" and ""HINNY"", ""FINNY"" is more common.

Let's choose ""FINNY"".

From the new feedback:

FINNY → F(x) I(✓) N(✓) N(✓) Y(✓)

Interpretation:
- F is NOT in the word (x).
- I, N, N, Y are in the word and in the correct positions (positions 2,3,4,5).

So the pattern is now:
_ I N N Y

Letters already eliminated:
S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, P, G, M, D, F

Allowed letters for position 1 (first letter): any letter not yet eliminated, except those already used in the pattern. The remaining allowed letters include B, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, etc.

Looking for valid English words of the form ?INNY:
- BINNY – not a valid word.
- HINNY – not a valid word.
- VINNY – not a valid word.
- WINNY – not a valid word.
- BINNY – not valid.
- HINNY – not valid.
- KINNY – not valid.
- JINNY – not valid.
- QUINNY – too long.
- VINTY – doesn’t fit _INNY.

Wait, let me think differently: the pattern is _ I N N Y. The only common word that fits is “WINNY” (a nickname), but that’s not standard. Another possibility is “MINNY” – but M is eliminated.

Actually, the only valid English word that fits _ I N N Y is “WINNY” (though it’s informal). However, there is a valid word “VINNY” as a name, but it’s not standard.

Another candidate: “BINNY” – not valid.

Wait, let me check the allowed letters again. Position 1 can be B, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Looking for valid words:
- WINNY – informal, but exists.
- VINNY – proper noun (name).
- BINNY – not valid.
- HINNY – not valid.

The most plausible standard word is “WINNY” (though it’s informal), but let’s verify if there’s any other.

Another candidate: “QUINNY” – too long.

Upon reflection, the only valid English word fitting _ I N N Y is “WINNY”. However, since “WINNY” is informal, let’s consider “VINNY” as a proper noun, but the game likely expects a common word.

Rechecking: the pattern is _ I N N Y. The only common word is “WINNY”.

But let me verify if there are any other possibilities. Another candidate: “QUINNY” is 6 letters. “BINNY” is not valid. “HINNY” is not valid.

Therefore, the only valid guess is “WINNY”.

But wait, let me check if “MINNY” is valid – no, M is eliminated. “FINNY” already used.

Hence, the only remaining valid word is “WINNY”.

However, let me think if I missed any letters. Position 1 allowed: B, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Another candidate: “VINNY” – proper noun (name), but acceptable.

FINNY → F(x) I(✓) N(✓) N(✓) Y(✓)

Interpretation:
- F is NOT in the word (x).
- I, N, N, Y are in the word and in the correct positions (positions 2,3,4,5).

So the pattern is now:
_ I N N Y

Letters already eliminated:
S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, P, G, M, D, F

Allowed letters for position 1 (first letter): any letter not yet eliminated, except those already used in the pattern. The remaining allowed letters include B, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, etc.

Looking for valid English words of the form ?INNY:
- BINNY – not a valid word.
- HINNY – not a valid word.
- VINNY – not a valid word.
- WINNY – not a valid word.
- BINNY – not valid.
- HINNY – not valid.
- KINNY – not valid.
- JINNY – not valid.
- QUINNY – too long.
- VINTY – doesn’t fit _INNY.

Wait, let me think differently: the pattern is _ I N N Y. The only common word that fits is “WINNY” (a nickname), but that’s not standard. Another possibility is “MINNY” – but M is eliminated.

Actually, the only valid English word that fits _ I N N Y is “WINNY” (though it’s informal). However, there is a valid word “VINNY” as a name, but it’s not standard.

Another candidate: “BINNY” – not valid.

Wait, let me check the allowed letters again. Position 1 can be B, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Looking for valid words:
- WINNY – informal, but exists.
- VINNY – proper noun (name).
- BINNY – not valid.
- HINNY – not valid.

The most plausible standard word is “WINNY” (though it’s informal), but let’s verify if there’s any other.

Another candidate: “QUINNY” – too long.

Upon reflection, the only valid English word fitting _ I N N Y is “WINNY”. However, since “WINNY” is informal, let’s consider “VINNY” as a proper noun, but the game likely expects a common word.

Rechecking: the pattern is _ I N N Y. The only common word is “WINNY”.

But let me verify if there are any other possibilities. Another candidate: “QUINNY” is 6 letters. “BINNY” is not valid. “HINNY” is not valid.

Therefore, the only valid guess is “WINNY”.

But wait, let me check if “MINNY” is valid – no, M is eliminated. “FINNY” already used.

Hence, the only remaining valid word is “WINNY”.

However, let me think if I missed any letters. Position 1 allowed: B, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Another candidate: “VINNY” – proper noun (name), but acceptable.

Between “WINNY” and “VINNY”, “WINNY” is more common.

Thus, the next guess is “WINNY”.",Guess 6: WINNY -> FEEDBACK: W(x) I(✓) N(✓) N(✓) Y(✓),FAIL
