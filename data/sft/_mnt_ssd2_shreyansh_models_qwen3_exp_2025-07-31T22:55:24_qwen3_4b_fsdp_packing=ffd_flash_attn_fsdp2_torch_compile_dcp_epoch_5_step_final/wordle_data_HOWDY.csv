### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in English to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use several of these to quickly identify which letters are present or absent.

A popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

From the two previous guesses we know:

- Letters NOT in the word at all: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N  
- Letters confirmed to be in the word:  
  – O (and it is in the correct position, so it must be the 2nd letter).  
  – D (but NOT in the 5th position).

So the secret word looks like: _ O _ _ _  
and must contain D somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O as the second letter.
2. Contains D somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.
3. Uses only letters that have NOT been ruled out (no S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N).

Available letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
We need common consonants and vowels. The remaining common vowels are I and possibly Y.

Let’s list possible candidates:
- D O _ _ _ (D in position 1): “DOING” – uses I and G, both allowed.
- _ O D _ _ (D in position 3): “BODGE” – but E is ruled out. “CODER” – R is ruled out. “FODOR” – R is ruled out. “GODLY” – L is ruled out. “HODAD” – A is ruled out. “JODHP” – P is allowed but uncommon. “MODYL” – L is ruled out. “PONDY” – N is ruled out. “VODKA” – A, K, A are allowed but A is ruled out. “WODEN” – N, E are ruled out.
- _ O _ D _ (D in position 4): “BOGAD” – G, A, D are allowed but A is ruled out. “COBID” – I is allowed. “DOBID” – B, I, D are allowed. “FOGID” – G, I, D are allowed. “GOBID” – B, I, D are allowed. “HOBBY” – B, Y are allowed but Y is vowel. “JOBBY” – J, B, Y are allowed but uncommon. “MOBID” – B, I, D are allowed. “POBID” – B, I, D are allowed. “VOGID” – G, I, D are allowed. “WOBBY” – B, Y are allowed but uncommon.

Among these, “DOING” is a common word and fits all constraints:
- D O I N G  
- O is in position 2 (correct).  
- D is in position 1 (allowed).  
- I and N are allowed (not ruled out).  
- G is allowed (not ruled out).  
- No forbidden letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in English to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use several of these to quickly identify which letters are present or absent.

A popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x”, meaning none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates every word containing any of those five letters.  
To maximize information, I now need a word that uses completely different, still-common letters.  
The next most frequent letters are R, I, N, O, U, D, C, M, P, G, H, B, F, K, V, W, Y.  
I’ll pick a word that uses several of these, avoiding S, L, A, T, E entirely.  
A strong candidate is “ROUND” (R, O, U, N, D) – it uses five entirely new letters and covers a good mix of common consonants and vowels.

<|im_end|>

From the two previous guesses we know:

- Letters NOT in the word at all: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N  
- Letters confirmed to be in the word:  
  – O (and it is in the correct position, so it must be the 2nd letter).  
  – D (but NOT in the 5th position).

So the secret word looks like: _ O _ _ _  
and must contain D somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O as the second letter.
2. Contains D somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.
3. Uses only letters that have NOT been ruled out (no S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N).

Available letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
We need common consonants and vowels. The remaining common vowels are I and possibly Y.

Let’s list possible candidates:
- D O _ _ _ (D in position 1): “DOING” – uses I and G, both allowed.
- _ O D _ _ (D in position 3): “BODGE” – but E is ruled out. “CODER” – R is ruled out. “FODOR” – R is ruled out. “GODLY” – L is ruled out. “HODAD” – A is ruled out. “JODHP” – P is allowed but uncommon. “MODYL” – L is ruled out. “PONDY” – N is ruled out. “VODKA” – A, K, A are allowed but A is ruled out. “WODEN” – N, E are ruled out.
- _ O _ D _ (D in position 4): “BOGAD” – G, A, D are allowed but A is ruled out. “COBID” – I is allowed. “DOBID” – B, I, D are allowed. “FOGID” – G, I, D are allowed. “GOBID” – B, I, D are allowed. “HOBBY” – B, Y are allowed but Y is vowel. “JOBBY” – J, B, Y are allowed but uncommon. “MOBID” – B, I, D are allowed. “POBID” – B, I, D are allowed. “VOGID” – G, I, D are allowed. “WOBBY” – B, Y are allowed but uncommon.

Among these, “DOING” is a common word and fits all constraints:
- D O I N G  
- O is in position 2 (correct).  
- D is in position 1 (allowed).  
- I and N are allowed (not ruled out).  
- G is allowed (not ruled out).  
- No forbidden letters.

2. Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:

   - Y must be in position 5 (✓ from BOBBY).  
   - D is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (from ROUND, DOING, BOBBY).  
     Therefore D must be in position 2, but position 2 is already O.  
     This contradiction implies D cannot be in the word.  
     However, ROUND and DOING both showed D(-), meaning D is in the word but not in those positions.  
     The only remaining position for D is position 2, but position 2 is O.  
     This is impossible, so our earlier assumption must be wrong.

DOING: D(-) O(✓) I(x) N(x) G(x)  
BOBBY: B(x) O(✓) B(x) B(x) Y(✓)

From ROUND: D(-) means D is in the word but NOT in position 5.  
From DOING: D(-) means D is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
From BOBBY: no D shown, so D could be in positions 2, 3, or 4.  
But position 2 is O (✓), so D must be in position 3 or 4.

Also, from BOBBY: Y is in position 5 (✓).

So the pattern is: _ O _ _ Y with D in position 3 or 4.

Allowed letters (not ruled out): C, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus O and Y already placed.

None of these are common words. Let’s re-examine the allowed letters.

Wait, the only letters not yet ruled out are: C, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits _ O _ _ Y with D in position 3 or 4 and only those letters.

The only common word that fits is “CODDY” (variant spelling of “cuddy”), but it’s uncommon.

However, let’s check if we missed any letters. The letters ruled out are:  
S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, I, G, B, F, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Z.

Wait, F, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Z are still allowed.  
The only remaining consonants are C, D.

So the word must use C and D.

Possible words:  
- CODDY  
- DOCKY – but K is allowed, but O is in position 2, so DOCKY would be D O C K Y – but D would be in position 1, which was ruled out.  
- CODKY – not a word.  
- COCKY – but K is allowed, but O is in position 2, so COCKY would be C O C K Y – but D is required.  
- COBKY – not a word.  

The only valid word seems to be CODDY.

But let’s double-check:  
CODDY uses C, O, D, D, Y.  
All letters are allowed (C, D, O, Y).  
Positions: C (1), O (2), D (3), D (4), Y (5).  
This fits the constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is CODDY.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in English to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use several of these to quickly identify which letters are present or absent.

A popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x”, meaning none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates every word containing any of those five letters.  
To maximize information, I now need a word that uses completely different, still-common letters.  
The next most frequent letters are R, I, N, O, U, D, C, M, P, G, H, B, F, K, V, W, Y.  
I’ll pick a word that uses several of these, avoiding S, L, A, T, E entirely.  
A strong candidate is “ROUND” (R, O, U, N, D) – it uses five entirely new letters and covers a good mix of common consonants and vowels.

From the two previous guesses we know:

- Letters NOT in the word at all: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N  
- Letters confirmed to be in the word:  
  – O (and it is in the correct position, so it must be the 2nd letter).  
  – D (but NOT in the 5th position).

So the secret word looks like: _ O _ _ _  
and must contain D somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O as the second letter.
2. Contains D somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.
3. Uses only letters that have NOT been ruled out (no S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N).

Available letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
We need common consonants and vowels. The remaining common vowels are I and possibly Y.

Let’s list possible candidates:
- D O _ _ _ (D in position 1): “DOING” – uses I and G, both allowed.
- _ O D _ _ (D in position 3): “BODGE” – but E is ruled out. “CODER” – R is ruled out. “FODOR” – R is ruled out. “GODLY” – L is ruled out. “HODAD” – A is ruled out. “JODHP” – P is allowed but uncommon. “MODYL” – L is ruled out. “PONDY” – N is ruled out. “VODKA” – A, K, A are allowed but A is ruled out. “WODEN” – N, E are ruled out.
- _ O _ D _ (D in position 4): “BOGAD” – G, A, D are allowed but A is ruled out. “COBID” – I is allowed. “DOBID” – B, I, D are allowed. “FOGID” – G, I, D are allowed. “GOBID” – B, I, D are allowed. “HOBBY” – B, Y are allowed but Y is vowel. “JOBBY” – J, B, Y are allowed but uncommon. “MOBID” – B, I, D are allowed. “POBID” – B, I, D are allowed. “VOGID” – G, I, D are allowed. “WOBBY” – B, Y are allowed but uncommon.

Among these, “DOING” is a common word and fits all constraints:
- D O I N G  
- O is in position 2 (correct).  
- D is in position 1 (allowed).  
- I and N are allowed (not ruled out).  
- G is allowed (not ruled out).  
- No forbidden letters.

2. Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:  
   - O must be in position 2 (✓ from both ROUND and DOING).  
   - D is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 5 (from ROUND and DOING).  
     Therefore D must be in position 3 or 4.

3. Remaining allowed letters (not yet ruled out):  
   B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the vowels already confirmed (O) and the consonants we haven’t tested yet.

None of these are common words. Let’s re-examine the allowed letters.

Wait, the only letters not yet ruled out are: C, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits _ O _ _ Y with D in position 3 or 4 and only those letters.

The only common word that fits is “CODDY” (variant spelling of “cuddy”), but it’s uncommon.

However, let’s check if we missed any letters. The letters ruled out are:  
S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, I, G, B, F, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Z.

Wait, F, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Z are still allowed.  
The only remaining consonants are C, D.

So the word must use C and D.

Possible words:  
- CODDY  
- DOCKY – but K is allowed, but O is in position 2, so DOCKY would be D O C K Y – but D would be in position 1, which was ruled out.  
- CODKY – not a word.  
- COCKY – but K is allowed, but O is in position 2, so COCKY would be C O C K Y – but D is required.  
- COBKY – not a word.  

The only valid word seems to be CODDY.

But let’s double-check:  
CODDY uses C, O, D, D, Y.  
All letters are allowed (C, D, O, Y).  
Positions: C (1), O (2), D (3), D (4), Y (5).  
This fits the constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is CODDY.

   - Y must be in position 5 (✓ from BOBBY, CODDY).

     Therefore D must be in position 1 or 2.  
     Position 2 is already O, so D must be in position 1.

3. Pattern so far: D O _ _ Y

4. Remaining allowed letters (not ruled out): C, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
