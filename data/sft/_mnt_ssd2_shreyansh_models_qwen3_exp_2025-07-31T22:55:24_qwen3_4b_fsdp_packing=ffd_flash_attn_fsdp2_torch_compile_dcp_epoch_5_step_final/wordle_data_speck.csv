For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N, etc. A good opening word should have a mix of these letters to quickly narrow down possibilities.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and the vowels will help us quickly identify which vowels are present in the secret word.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" which has S, L, T (consonants) and A, E (vowels). However, ""AROSE"" might be slightly better because it covers more vowels and common consonants. 

After considering these options, ""AROSE"" seems like the best first guess to maximize information.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So we know:
- The word contains S and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, or O.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both S and E.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O.
3. S is not in position 4, and E is not in position 5.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels to try: I, U (since A and O are ruled out).

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints. A word like “STEIN” comes to mind:
- Contains S and E.
- Does not contain A, R, or O.
- S is in position 1 (not 4), E is in position 3 (not 5).

Another possibility is “UNTIE”:
- Contains U, N, T, I, E.
- Has E in position 5, which we know is wrong, so this is bad.

“SILEN”:
- Contains S, I, L, E, N.
- S is in position 1 (not 4), E is in position 4 (not 5).
- Does not contain A, R, or O.

Both “STEIN” and “SILEN” seem valid. “STEIN” uses common letters and positions S and E in new spots, so I’ll go with that.

- Letters confirmed in the word: S, E.
- Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N, etc. A good opening word should have a mix of these letters to quickly narrow down possibilities.

This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and the vowels will help us quickly identify which vowels are present in the secret word.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" which has S, L, T (consonants) and A, E (vowels). However, ""AROSE"" might be slightly better because it covers more vowels and common consonants. 

After considering these options, ""AROSE"" seems like the best first guess to maximize information.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So we know:
- The word contains S and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, or O.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both S and E.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O.
3. S is not in position 4, and E is not in position 5.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels to try: I, U (since A and O are ruled out).

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints. A word like “STEIN” comes to mind:
- Contains S and E.
- Does not contain A, R, or O.
- S is in position 1 (not 4), E is in position 3 (not 5).

Another possibility is “UNTIE”:
- Contains U, N, T, I, E.
- Has E in position 5, which we know is wrong, so this is bad.

“SILEN”:
- Contains S, I, L, E, N.
- S is in position 1 (not 4), E is in position 4 (not 5).
- Does not contain A, R, or O.

Both “STEIN” and “SILEN” seem valid. “STEIN” uses common letters and positions S and E in new spots, so I’ll go with that.

<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on STEIN:
- S is correct in position 1 (✓).
- E is correct in position 3 (✓).
- T, I, N are not in the word (x).

So far we know:
- Word starts with S.
- Third letter is E.
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, I, N.
- Letters confirmed in the word: S, E.
- Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word of the form S _ E _ _ that does NOT contain A, R, O, T, I, N.

Possible consonants for positions 2, 4, 5: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible vowels for positions 2, 4, 5: U (since A, O, I are ruled out).

Let’s look for common words:
- S U E _ _ : “SUEDE” (but D and E are okay, but E is already used in position 3, and we don’t know about D)
- S _ E _ _ : “SLEEK” (but K is okay, but E is already used in position 3)
- S _ E _ _ : “SPECK” (but P, C, K are okay)
- S _ E _ _ : “SHEEP” (but H, P are okay, but E is already used in position 3)
- S _ E _ _ : “SWEET” (but W, T are okay, but T is ruled out)

Looking at these, “SUEDE” seems plausible:
- S _ E _ _ : S U E D E
- Letters: S, U, E, D, E
- S is in position 1 (✓), E is in position 3 (✓)
- Does not contain A, R, O, T, I, N
- Uses U and D which are still possible

Another option is “SPECK”:
- S P E C K
- S in 1, E in 3
- Uses P, C, K which are still possible

Between these, “SPECK” might be better because it uses more common letters. Let’s try SPECK.

But wait, let me double-check:
- SPECK: S, P, E, C, K
- S in 1 (✓), E in 3 (✓)
- No A, R, O, T, I, N
- P, C, K are still possible

This seems valid. However, let me think if there’s a more common word. Another option is “SLEEK”:
- S L E E K
- S in 1 (✓), E in 3 (✓)
- L, E, K are still possible
- But E appears twice, which might be possible

Between SPECK and SLEEK, SLEEK seems more common. Let’s go with SLEEK.

Wait, but let me check the letters again:
- SLEEK: S, L, E, E, K
- S in 1 (✓), E in 3 (✓)
- L, K are still possible
- Does not contain A, R, O, T, I, N

Yes, this seems valid. However, I need to make sure that the word is valid. SLEEK is a valid 5-letter word.

Therefore, my next guess is SLEEK.

Let's consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

1. Fixed letters:

2. Letters NOT in the word at all:

   - From Guess 3: L

3. Letters that are in the word but whose exact positions we still don't know:
   - E appears in position 3 (✓) but also shows up in Guess 3 as E(-) in position 4, meaning the second E is not in position 4. So the word has two E's, one in position 3 and another somewhere else, but not position 4.

4. Therefore the pattern so far is:
   S _ E _ K
   with the second letter (position 2) and the fourth letter (position 4) still unknown.

5. Possible letters for positions 2 and 4:
   - Cannot be: A, R, O, T, I, N, L
   - Can be: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
   - Also, since we know there is another E somewhere, and position 4 cannot be E (from E(-)), the second E must be in position 2.

6. So the word must be:
   S E E _ K

7. Now we just need a valid 5-letter word that fits S E E _ K and uses only allowed letters for position 4.

Possible letters for position 4: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking at common words:
- SEEK? No, that's 4 letters.
- SEEBS? No, too long.
- SEEMS? No, M is allowed but S is already used.
- SEEKS? Yes, that's a valid word: S E E K S
   - Pattern: S E E K S

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N, etc. A good opening word should have a mix of these letters to quickly narrow down possibilities.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S).

Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N, etc. A good opening word should have a mix of these letters to quickly narrow down possibilities.\n\nLooking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and the vowels will help us quickly identify which vowels are present in the secret word.\n\nAnother strong option is ""SLATE"" which has S, L, T (consonants) and A, E (vowels).

Let's summarize everything we now know after four guesses.

1. Fixed positions:
   - Position 1: S (✓)  (from STEIN and SLEEK)
   - Position 3: E (✓)  (from STEIN and SLEEK)
   - Position 5: K (✓)  (from SLEEK)

2. Letters NOT in the word at all:
   - A, R, O (from AROSE)
   - T, I, N (from STEIN)
   - L (from SLEEK)
   - K (from SEEKS) is NOT in position 4
   - S (from SEEKS) is NOT in position 5

3. Letters that are in the word but whose positions we still don't know:
   - E appears in positions 3 and 4 (from SEEKS feedback: E(-) in position 2 and E(✓) in position 3). Actually, the feedback for SEEKS was:
     - S(✓) E(-) E(✓) K(-) S(-)
     - So position 2 is E(-): E is in the word but not in position 2.
     - Position 4 is K(-): K is in the word but not in position 4.
     - Position 5 is S(-): S is in the word but not in position 5 (but we already know S is in position 1, so this is consistent).
   - Therefore the word has:
     - S _ E _ K
     - with an additional E somewhere (since E(-) in position 2 means there's another E not in position 2, but we already have E in position 3, so the second E must be in position 2 or 4, but position 2 is E(-) meaning it's not there, and position 4 is K(-) meaning it's not there. Wait, this seems contradictory. Let me re-examine the feedback carefully.

   The SEEKS feedback:
   - S(✓)  (position 1 is correct)
   - E(-)  (position 2: E is in the word but not here)
   - E(✓)  (position 3: E is correct here)
   - K(-)  (position 4: K is in the word but not here)
   - S(-)  (position 5: S is in the word but not here)

   From this:
   - The word must have S in position 1, E in position 3, and K somewhere (but not in position 4). Since position 5 is S(-), K cannot be in position 5 either (because position 5 is S(-), not K). So K must be in position 2 or 4, but position 4 is K(-), so K must be in position 2.

   Therefore the pattern is:
   S K E _ K
   But wait, position 5 is S(-), so position 5 cannot be S, but we already have K in position 2 and 5 would be K? No, the pattern would be S K E _ K, but that's 5 letters: S K E _ K, which is S K E _ K. But position 5 would be K, but from SEEKS feedback, position 5 is S(-), which means position 5 is NOT S, but it could be K. However, we already know from SLEEK that position 5 is K (✓). This seems conflicting.

   Let me re-examine the feedback step by step:

   - From SLEEK (positions 1-5): S(✓) L(x) E(✓) E(-) K(✓)
     - Position 1: S ✓
     - Position 2: L x (so L is not in the word)
     - Position 3: E ✓
     - Position 4: E (-) meaning E is in the word but not here (so the second E is not in position 4)
     - Position 5: K ✓

   - From SEEKS (positions 1-5): S(✓) E(-) E(✓) K(-) S(-)
     - Position 1: S ✓
     - Position 2: E (-) meaning E is in the word but not here (so the second E is not in position 2)
     - Position 3: E ✓
     - Position 4: K (-) meaning K is in the word but not here (so K is not in position 4)
     - Position 5: S (-) meaning S is in the word but not here (but we already know S is in position 1, so this is consistent)

   Combining these:
   - The word has S in position 1, E in position 3, K in position 5 (from SLEEK).
   - From SEEKS, position 4 is K(-), so K cannot be in position 4, but we already have K in position 5, so that's fine.
   - The word must have another E somewhere, but positions 2 and 4 cannot have E (from SEEKS: position 2 is E(-) and position 4 is K(-), but position 4 is K(-) not E(-), so the only remaining place for the second E is position 2. However, position 2 is E(-) meaning E is not in position 2. This is a contradiction.

   This suggests that the word must have only one E (position 3) and no other E. But from SEEKS, position 2 is E(-) meaning E is in the word but not here, which would imply there is another E. This seems conflicting.

   Let me re-examine the SEEKS feedback:
   - Position 2: E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 2.
   - Position 3: E(✓) means E is in position 3.
   - So the word must have at least two E's: one in position 3 and another somewhere else (positions 1,4,5). But position 1 is S, position 5 is K (from SLEEK), so the second E must be in position 4. But from SEEKS, position 4 is K(-) meaning K is in the word but not here, which doesn't directly say about E. Wait, the feedback for position 4 in SEEKS is K(-), which only tells us K is in the word but not in position 4. It doesn't say anything about E in position 4.

   So the word has:
   - S _ E _ K
   - with an additional E somewhere, and from SEEKS we know:
     - E is not in position 2 (from E(-) in position 2)
     - K is not in position 4 (from K(-) in position 4)
   Therefore the second E must be in position 4.

   So the pattern is:
   S _ E E K

   Now we just need a valid 5-letter word that fits S _ E E K.

   Possible letters for position 2: any letter not in the forbidden list (A, R, O, T, I, N, L, and also not E because we already have E in positions 3 and 4).

   Looking at common words:
   - S C E E K (SCEEK) – not a valid word.
   - S B E E K (SBEAK) – not valid.
   - S P E E K (SPEEK) – not valid.
   - S M E E K (SMEEK) – not valid.
   - S G E E K (SGEEK) – not valid.
   - S H E E K (SHEEK) – not valid.
   - S F E E K (SFEAK) – not valid.
   - S V E E K (SVEEK) – not valid.
   - S W E E K (SWEAK) – not valid.
   - S Y E E K (SYEEK) – not valid.
   - S D E E K (SDEEK) – not valid.

   Hmm, none of these seem to be valid English words. This suggests my earlier assumption might be wrong. Let me re-examine the constraints.

   From SEEKS:
   - Position 2: E(-) – E is in the word but not here.
   - Position 3: E(✓) – E is in position 3.
   - Position 4: K(-) – K is in the word but not here.
   - Position 5: S(-) – S is in the word but not here (but we already know S is in position 1, so this is consistent).

   From SLEEK:
   - Position 5: K(✓) – K is in position 5.

   Therefore the word is:
   S _ E _ K
   with:
   - E in position 3 (✓)
   - K in position 5 (✓)
   - E is in the word but not in position 2 (from SEEKS)
   - K is in the word but not in position 4 (from SEEKS, but K is already in position 5, so this is fine)
   - S is in the word but not in position 5 (consistent)

   The only remaining place for the second E is position 4, because positions 1,2,3,5 are S, _, E, K. But position 4 is the only spot left for another E. However, from SEEKS, position 4 is K(-), which only tells us K is not in position 4, but doesn't restrict E. So the word could be S _ E E K.

   The only valid English word that fits S _ E E K is ""SPEEK"" (variant spelling of speak), but that's not standard. Another possibility is ""SHEEK"" (variant of speak), but again non-standard.

   This suggests there might be an error in my interpretation. Let me check if there's another approach.

   Alternative interpretation: the word has only one E (position 3), and the E(-) in position 2 simply indicates that E is in the word but not in position 2 (which is already satisfied since E is in position 3). Similarly, the K(-) in position 4 just confirms K is not in position 4 (which is already satisfied since K is in position 5). Therefore the word is S _ E _ K with positions 2 and 4 still unknown.

   Possible letters for positions 2 and 4 (excluding forbidden letters A, R, O, T, I, N, L):
   - Position 2: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
   - Position 4: same set, but must form a valid word.

   Looking for valid words:
   - S C E D K – not a word
   - S C E D K – no
   - S C E M K – no
   - S C E D K – no
   - S C E D K – no
   - S C E D K – no
   - S C E D K – no

   This seems impossible. Let me check if I missed any constraints.

   Re-examining all feedback:

   - AROSE: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - STEIN: S(✓) T(x) E(✓) I(x) N(x)
   - SLEEK: S(✓) L(x) E(✓) E(-) K(✓)
   - SEEKS: S(✓) E(-) E(✓) K(-) S(-)

   From this:
   - S is fixed in position 1
   - E is fixed in position 3
   - K is fixed in position 5
   - The word has no A, R, O, T, I, N, L
   - The word must have another E (from E(-) in position 2 of SEEKS)
   - Therefore the word must be S _ E E K

   The only valid English word that fits is ""SPEEK"" (variant of speak), but that's not standard. Another possibility is ""SHEEK"" (variant of speak), but again non-standard.

   This suggests the word might be ""SPEAK"":
   - S P E A K
   - But A is forbidden (from AROSE: A(x))

   ""SPECK"":
   - S P E C K
   - C is allowed, P is allowed
   - But does this fit all constraints?
     - S in position 1 (✓)
     - E in position 3 (✓)
     - K in position 5 (✓)
     - No A, R, O, T, I, N, L
     - No extra E required, but we have to check if E(-) in position 2 of SEEKS implies another E. If the word has only one E (position 3), then the E(-) in position 2 just means E is not in position 2, which is true. The K(-) in position 4 just means K is not in position 4, which is true. The S(-) in position 5 just means S is not in position 5, which is true.

   Therefore ""SPECK"" fits all constraints:
   - S P E C K
   - S in 1 (✓)
   - E in 3 (✓)
   - K in 5 (✓)
   - No A, R, O, T, I, N, L
   - No forbidden letters in positions 2 and 4 (P and C are allowed)

   This seems to be the valid word.
</think>

Based on the feedback, the word has the pattern S _ E _ K with no A, R, O, T, I, N, L, and no additional E required (since E(-) in position 2 only means E is not there, and E is already in position 3). The remaining positions 2 and 4 must be filled with allowed letters to form a valid word. The word ""SPECK"" fits all constraints.

<guess>SPECK</guess>",SPECK,"Let's summarize everything we now know after four guesses.

1. Fixed positions:
   - Position 1: S (✓)  (from STEIN and SLEEK)
   - Position 3: E (✓)  (from STEIN and SLEEK)
   - Position 5: K (✓)  (from SLEEK)

2. Letters NOT in the word at all:
   - A, R, O (from AROSE)
   - T, I, N (from STEIN)
   - L (from SLEEK)
   - K (from SEEKS) is NOT in position 4
   - S (from SEEKS) is NOT in position 5

3. Letters that are in the word but whose positions we still don't know:
   - E appears in positions 3 and 4 (from SEEKS feedback: E(-) in position 2 and E(✓) in position 3). Actually, the feedback for SEEKS was:
     - S(✓) E(-) E(✓) K(-) S(-)
     - So position 2 is E(-): E is in the word but not in position 2.
     - Position 4 is K(-): K is in the word but not in position 4.
     - Position 5 is S(-): S is in the word but not in position 5 (but we already know S is in position 1, so this is consistent).
   - Therefore the word has:
     - S _ E _ K
     - with an additional E somewhere (since E(-) in position 2 means there's another E not in position 2, but we already have E in position 3, so the second E must be in position 2 or 4, but position 2 is E(-) meaning it's not there, and position 4 is K(-) meaning it's not there. Wait, this seems contradictory. Let me re-examine the feedback carefully.

   The SEEKS feedback:
   - S(✓)  (position 1 is correct)
   - E(-)  (position 2: E is in the word but not here)
   - E(✓)  (position 3: E is correct here)
   - K(-)  (position 4: K is in the word but not here)
   - S(-)  (position 5: S is in the word but not here)

   From this:
   - The word must have S in position 1, E in position 3, and K somewhere (but not in position 4). Since position 5 is S(-), K cannot be in position 5 either (because position 5 is S(-), not K). So K must be in position 2 or 4, but position 4 is K(-), so K must be in position 2.

   Therefore the pattern is:
   S K E _ K
   But wait, position 5 is S(-), so position 5 cannot be S, but we already have K in position 2 and 5 would be K? No, the pattern would be S K E _ K, but that's 5 letters: S K E _ K, which is S K E _ K. But position 5 would be K, but from SEEKS feedback, position 5 is S(-), which means position 5 is NOT S, but it could be K. However, we already know from SLEEK that position 5 is K (✓). This seems conflicting.

   Let me re-examine the feedback step by step:

   - From SLEEK (positions 1-5): S(✓) L(x) E(✓) E(-) K(✓)
     - Position 1: S ✓
     - Position 2: L x (so L is not in the word)
     - Position 3: E ✓
     - Position 4: E (-) meaning E is in the word but not here (so the second E is not in position 4)
     - Position 5: K ✓

   - From SEEKS (positions 1-5): S(✓) E(-) E(✓) K(-) S(-)
     - Position 1: S ✓
     - Position 2: E (-) meaning E is in the word but not here (so the second E is not in position 2)
     - Position 3: E ✓
     - Position 4: K (-) meaning K is in the word but not here (so K is not in position 4)
     - Position 5: S (-) meaning S is in the word but not here (but we already know S is in position 1, so this is consistent)

   Combining these:
   - The word has S in position 1, E in position 3, K in position 5 (from SLEEK).
   - From SEEKS, position 4 is K(-), so K cannot be in position 4, but we already have K in position 5, so that's fine.
   - The word must have another E somewhere, but positions 2 and 4 cannot have E (from SEEKS: position 2 is E(-) and position 4 is K(-), but position 4 is K(-) not E(-), so the only remaining place for the second E is position 2. However, position 2 is E(-) meaning E is not in position 2. This is a contradiction.

   This suggests that the word must have only one E (position 3) and no other E. But from SEEKS, position 2 is E(-) meaning E is in the word but not here, which would imply there is another E. This seems conflicting.

   Let me re-examine the SEEKS feedback:
   - Position 2: E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 2.
   - Position 3: E(✓) means E is in position 3.
   - So the word must have at least two E's: one in position 3 and another somewhere else (positions 1,4,5). But position 1 is S, position 5 is K (from SLEEK), so the second E must be in position 4. But from SEEKS, position 4 is K(-) meaning K is in the word but not here, which doesn't directly say about E. Wait, the feedback for position 4 in SEEKS is K(-), which only tells us K is in the word but not in position 4. It doesn't say anything about E in position 4.

   So the word has:
   - S _ E _ K
   - with an additional E somewhere, and from SEEKS we know:
     - E is not in position 2 (from E(-) in position 2)
     - K is not in position 4 (from K(-) in position 4)
   Therefore the second E must be in position 4.

   So the pattern is:
   S _ E E K

   Now we just need a valid 5-letter word that fits S _ E E K.

   Possible letters for position 2: any letter not in the forbidden list (A, R, O, T, I, N, L, and also not E because we already have E in positions 3 and 4).

   Looking at common words:
   - S C E E K (SCEEK) – not a valid word.
   - S B E E K (SBEAK) – not valid.
   - S P E E K (SPEEK) – not valid.
   - S M E E K (SMEEK) – not valid.
   - S G E E K (SGEEK) – not valid.
   - S H E E K (SHEEK) – not valid.
   - S F E E K (SFEAK) – not valid.
   - S V E E K (SVEEK) – not valid.
   - S W E E K (SWEAK) – not valid.
   - S Y E E K (SYEEK) – not valid.
   - S D E E K (SDEEK) – not valid.

   Hmm, none of these seem to be valid English words. This suggests my earlier assumption might be wrong. Let me re-examine the constraints.

   From SEEKS:
   - Position 2: E(-) – E is in the word but not here.
   - Position 3: E(✓) – E is in position 3.
   - Position 4: K(-) – K is in the word but not here.
   - Position 5: S(-) – S is in the word but not here (but we already know S is in position 1, so this is consistent).

   From SLEEK:
   - Position 5: K(✓) – K is in position 5.

   Therefore the word is:
   S _ E _ K
   with:
   - E in position 3 (✓)
   - K in position 5 (✓)
   - E is in the word but not in position 2 (from SEEKS)
   - K is in the word but not in position 4 (from SEEKS, but K is already in position 5, so this is fine)
   - S is in the word but not in position 5 (consistent)

   The only remaining place for the second E is position 4, because positions 1,2,3,5 are S, _, E, K. But position 4 is the only spot left for another E. However, from SEEKS, position 4 is K(-), which only tells us K is not in position 4, but doesn't restrict E. So the word could be S _ E E K.

   The only valid English word that fits S _ E E K is ""SPEEK"" (variant spelling of speak), but that's not standard. Another possibility is ""SHEEK"" (variant of speak), but again non-standard.

   This suggests there might be an error in my interpretation. Let me check if there's another approach.

   Alternative interpretation: the word has only one E (position 3), and the E(-) in position 2 simply indicates that E is in the word but not in position 2 (which is already satisfied since E is in position 3). Similarly, the K(-) in position 4 just confirms K is not in position 4 (which is already satisfied since K is in position 5). Therefore the word is S _ E _ K with positions 2 and 4 still unknown.

   Possible letters for positions 2 and 4 (excluding forbidden letters A, R, O, T, I, N, L):
   - Position 2: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
   - Position 4: same set, but must form a valid word.

   Looking for valid words:
   - S C E D K – not a word
   - S C E D K – no
   - S C E M K – no
   - S C E D K – no
   - S C E D K – no
   - S C E D K – no
   - S C E D K – no

   This seems impossible. Let me check if I missed any constraints.

   Re-examining all feedback:

   - AROSE: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - STEIN: S(✓) T(x) E(✓) I(x) N(x)
   - SLEEK: S(✓) L(x) E(✓) E(-) K(✓)
   - SEEKS: S(✓) E(-) E(✓) K(-) S(-)

   From this:
   - S is fixed in position 1
   - E is fixed in position 3
   - K is fixed in position 5
   - The word has no A, R, O, T, I, N, L
   - The word must have another E (from E(-) in position 2 of SEEKS)
   - Therefore the word must be S _ E E K

   The only valid English word that fits is ""SPEEK"" (variant of speak), but that's not standard. Another possibility is ""SHEEK"" (variant of speak), but again non-standard.

   This suggests the word might be ""SPEAK"":
   - S P E A K
   - But A is forbidden (from AROSE: A(x))

   ""SPECK"":
   - S P E C K
   - C is allowed, P is allowed
   - But does this fit all constraints?
     - S in position 1 (✓)
     - E in position 3 (✓)
     - K in position 5 (✓)
     - No A, R, O, T, I, N, L
     - No extra E required, but we have to check if E(-) in position 2 of SEEKS implies another E. If the word has only one E (position 3), then the E(-) in position 2 just means E is not in position 2, which is true. The K(-) in position 4 just means K is not in position 4, which is true. The S(-) in position 5 just means S is not in position 5, which is true.

   Therefore ""SPECK"" fits all constraints:
   - S P E C K
   - S in 1 (✓)
   - E in 3 (✓)
   - K in 5 (✓)
   - No A, R, O, T, I, N, L
   - No forbidden letters in positions 2 and 4 (P and C are allowed)

   This seems to be the valid word.Based on the feedback, the word has the pattern S _ E _ K with no A, R, O, T, I, N, L, and no additional E required (since E(-) in position 2 only means E is not there, and E is already in position 3). The remaining positions 2 and 4 must be filled with allowed letters to form a valid word. The word ""SPECK"" fits all constraints.",Guess 5: SPECK -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(✓) E(✓) C(✓) K(✓),SUCCESS
