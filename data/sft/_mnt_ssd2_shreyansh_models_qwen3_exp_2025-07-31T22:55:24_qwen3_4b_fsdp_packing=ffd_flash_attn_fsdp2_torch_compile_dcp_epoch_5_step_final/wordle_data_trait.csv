### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should include several of these.

Common strong starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains five very common letters and covers vowels (A, O, E) and several consonants (R, S).

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1, so it must be in positions 2-5).
- R(✓): R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- O(x), S(x), E(x): O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Contains an A somewhere in positions 1,3,4,5.
- Does not contain O, S, or E.

Next step: choose a word that keeps R in position 2 and introduces new common letters while respecting the constraints. Good consonants left to test: T, N, L, D, C, M, P, etc. Good vowels left to test: I, U (since A is already confirmed but in wrong spot).

Possible candidates:
- TRAIL (but has L, which is fine, but I need to check if A is in the right spot)
- PRANK (but N and K are less common)
- BRISK (but S is already ruled out)
- DRINK (but N, I, K)
- TRAMP (but P and M are less common)

A better choice would be ""TRAIN"":
- T (new consonant)

From all feedback so far we have:

1. arose → A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   – R is fixed in position 2.
   – A is in the word but not in position 1.
   – O, S, E are not in the word.

2. train → T(✓) R(✓) A(✓) I(✓) N(x)
   – T is fixed in position 1.
   – R is fixed in position 2.
   – A is fixed in position 3.
   – I is fixed in position 4.
   – N is not in the word.

3. trail → T(✓) R(✓) A(✓) I(✓) L(x)
   – T, R, A, I are confirmed in their positions.
   – L is not in the word.

So the pattern is now:
T R A I _

Letters already ruled out: O, S, E, N, L.  
Letters already used and confirmed: T, R, A, I.  
Remaining common consonants: D, C, M, P, etc.

The only remaining letter that forms a valid 5-letter word with “TRAI” is D, giving “TRAIT” (a valid English word meaning “to give a false appearance”).  
Therefore, the next logical guess is “TRAIT”.
