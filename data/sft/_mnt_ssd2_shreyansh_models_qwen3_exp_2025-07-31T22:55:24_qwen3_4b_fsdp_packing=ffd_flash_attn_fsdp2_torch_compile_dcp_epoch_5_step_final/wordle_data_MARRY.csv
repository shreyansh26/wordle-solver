- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. 

Looking at these common letters, I can form the word ""AROSE"" which contains:
- A (very common starting letter)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give me good coverage to determine which of these common letters are present in the secret word and their positions.

Letters that ARE in the word (positions still unknown):
R (cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 1)
A (cannot be in positions 1 or 3; it is confirmed in position 2)

So the word looks like: _ A _ _ Y

Letters still allowed (from the remaining alphabet):

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2
- Y in position 5
- R somewhere in positions 4 or 3 (since it cannot be in 1, 2, or 5)
- The remaining two letters must be from the still-allowed set

Possible patterns:
- _ A _ R Y

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. 

Looking at these common letters, I can form the word ""AROSE"" which contains:
- A (very common starting letter)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give me good coverage to determine which of these common letters are present in the secret word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains A and R, but neither is in their original positions (1 and 2 respectively).
- The word does NOT contain O, S, or E.

Next, I need a word that:
1. Uses A and R in different positions than 1 and 2.
2. Avoids O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

A good candidate is “TRAIL”:
- T, I, L are new letters.
- A is now in position 3 (was 1, so new position).
- R is now in position 2 (was 2, but feedback said R is not in position 2, so this is invalid).

Oops, R in position 2 is invalid. Let’s try “TRAIN”:
- T, I, N are new letters.
- A is in position 2 (was 1, so new position).
- R is in position 3 (was 2, so new position).

This satisfies all constraints.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
O, S, E, T, I, N

Letters that ARE in the word (but positions are unknown):
A (cannot be in position 1 or 3)
R (cannot be in position 2 or 3)

Remaining unused common letters that haven’t been ruled out: D, L, M, P, U, C, G, H, K, Y, B, F, J, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and R, but not in positions 1/3 for A or 2/3 for R.
2. Uses only the still-allowed letters.

Let’s look for words that place A in 2,4, or 5 and R in 1,4, or 5, while filling the rest with allowed letters.

Candidate: “DRAMA” – but M is allowed, and A is in 2 and 4 (both new positions), R is in 3 (invalid because R cannot be in 3 from TRAIN feedback).

Candidate: “GRAIN” – but I and N are already ruled out.

Candidate: “CRAMP” – C, P are allowed, but A is in 3 (invalid for A).

Candidate: “CARDS” – S is out.

Candidate: “DARMA” – A is in 2 and 4, R is in 3 (invalid).

Candidate: “RALLY” – R is in 1 (allowed), A is in 2 and 4 (allowed), but L is allowed and Y is allowed. This looks valid.

Check positions:
R in 1 (new position, allowed)
A in 2 (new position, allowed)
A in 4 (new position, allowed)
L in 3 (new letter)
L in 5 (new letter)

All constraints satisfied.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. 

Looking at these common letters, I can form the word ""AROSE"" which contains:
- A (very common starting letter)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give me good coverage to determine which of these common letters are present in the secret word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains A and R, but neither is in their original positions (1 and 2 respectively).
- The word does NOT contain O, S, or E.

Next, I need a word that:
1. Uses A and R in different positions than 1 and 2.
2. Avoids O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

A good candidate is “TRAIL”:
- T, I, L are new letters.
- A is now in position 3 (was 1, so new position).
- R is now in position 2 (was 2, but feedback said R is not in position 2, so this is invalid).

Oops, R in position 2 is invalid. Let’s try “TRAIN”:
- T, I, N are new letters.
- A is in position 2 (was 1, so new position).
- R is in position 3 (was 2, so new position).

This satisfies all constraints.

Guess 2: TRAIN -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
O, S, E, T, I, N

Letters that ARE in the word (but positions are unknown):
A (cannot be in position 1 or 3)
R (cannot be in position 2 or 3)

Remaining unused common letters that haven’t been ruled out: D, L, M, P, U, C, G, H, K, Y, B, F, J, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and R, but not in positions 1/3 for A or 2/3 for R.
2. Uses only the still-allowed letters.

Let’s look for words that place A in 2,4, or 5 and R in 1,4, or 5, while filling the rest with allowed letters.

Candidate: “DRAMA” – but M is allowed, and A is in 2 and 4 (both new positions), R is in 3 (invalid because R cannot be in 3 from TRAIN feedback).

Candidate: “GRAIN” – but I and N are already ruled out.

Candidate: “CRAMP” – C, P are allowed, but A is in 3 (invalid for A).

Candidate: “CARDS” – S is out.

Candidate: “DARMA” – A is in 2 and 4, R is in 3 (invalid).

Candidate: “RALLY” – R is in 1 (allowed), A is in 2 and 4 (allowed), but L is allowed and Y is allowed. This looks valid.

Check positions:
R in 1 (new position, allowed)
A in 2 (new position, allowed)
A in 4 (new position, allowed)
L in 3 (new letter)
L in 5 (new letter)

All constraints satisfied.

Current knowledge:

Letters that are NOT in the word:
O, S, E, T, I, N, L

Letters that ARE in the word (positions still unknown):
R (cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 1)
A (cannot be in positions 1 or 3; it is confirmed in position 2)
Y (cannot be in position 5)

Confirmed positions so far:
- Position 2 is A
- Position 5 is Y

So the word looks like: _ A _ _ Y

Letters still allowed (from the remaining alphabet):
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2
- Y in position 5
- R somewhere in positions 4 or 3 (since it cannot be in 1, 2, or 5)
- The remaining two letters must be from the still-allowed set

Possible patterns:
- _ A _ R Y
- _ A R _ Y

Looking for valid English words that fit these patterns:

1. _ A _ R Y
   - C A R R Y – but R is in position 3 and 4 (but we only have one R)
   - D A R R Y – same issue
   - F A R R Y – same issue
   - G A R R Y – same issue
   - H A R R Y – same issue
   - K A R R Y – same issue
   - M A R R Y – same issue
   - P A R R Y – same issue
   - W A R R Y – same issue
   - B A R R Y – same issue
   - C A R R Y – already seen
   - D A R R Y – already seen
   - etc. – all have two R’s, but we only know one R exists.

2. _ A R _ Y
   - B A R G Y – valid word, uses B and G (both allowed)
   - C A R G Y – valid word, uses C and G
   - D A R G Y – valid word, uses D and G
   - F A R G Y – valid word, uses F and G
   - G A R G Y – uses G twice (allowed)
   - H A R G Y – uses H and G
   - M A R G Y – uses M and G
   - P A R G Y – uses P and G
   - W A R G Y – uses W and G
   - etc.

Among these, ""BARGY"" is a valid word and uses new letters B and G.

Check positions:
- B in 1 (new, allowed)
- A in 2 (confirmed)
- R in 3 (allowed, since R can be in 3)
- G in 4 (new, allowed)
- Y in 5 (confirmed)

This fits all constraints.

From the five rounds we now know:

Confirmed positions:
- Position 2 = A
- Position 3 = R
- Position 5 = Y

Confirmed letters not in the word at all:
O, S, E, T, I, N, L, G, B, D, K

So the word pattern is: _ A R _ Y

Allowed letters for positions 1 and 4 (from the remaining alphabet):
C, F, H, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a valid 5-letter English word that fits the pattern ? A R ? Y.
