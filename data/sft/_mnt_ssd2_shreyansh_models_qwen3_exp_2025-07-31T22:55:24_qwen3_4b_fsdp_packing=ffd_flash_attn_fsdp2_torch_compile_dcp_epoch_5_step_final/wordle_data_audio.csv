### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some popular choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses several of these. 

""SLATE"" uses S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. This should give me good coverage of the alphabet and help me narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but NOT in position 3.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A somewhere except the third position.
2. Does NOT contain S, L, T, E.

Good remaining letters to test: R, N, I, C, O, U, D, G, H, M, P, etc.

A word that uses several high-frequency letters not yet tested and places A in a different position is “CRANK”:
- C, R, N, K are new letters.
- A is in position 2 (not 3), satisfying the feedback.

Let’s try CRANK.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - S, L, T, E are absent.

2. CRANK → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) K(x)
   - A is still in the word but not in position 3 (same as before).
   - C, R, N, K are absent.

So far we know:
- The word contains A, and A is NOT in position 3.
- The word does NOT contain: S, L, T, E, C, R, N, K.

Letters still available: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, J, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is excluded).
- Uses only the remaining letters.

A good candidate is “FAITH”:
- F, I, T, H are new letters.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- Does not use any excluded letters.

But wait, T is already excluded (from SLATE feedback). So FAITH is invalid because it contains T.

Next candidate: “MADAM” – but this repeats A and M, and M is allowed. However, it has two A’s, which might not be optimal.

Better: “HUMID” – uses H, U, M, I, D. A is not in this word, so this won’t work.

We need a word that must contain A. Let’s try “DAMAS” – but S is excluded.

“MAGMA” – uses M, G, A, M, A. A is in positions 3 and 5. Position 3 is excluded, so this is invalid.

“GAMMA” – same issue with position 3.

“BAMBO” – but O is allowed, B is allowed, A is in position 1 (allowed). But O is not excluded.

Actually, let’s list possible positions for A:
- Position 1: word starts with A.
- Position 2: A is second letter.
- Position 4: A is fourth letter.
- Position 5: A is last letter.

Let’s try “AUDIO”:
- A is first letter (allowed).
- U, D, I, O are new letters.
- No excluded letters.

This seems good.
