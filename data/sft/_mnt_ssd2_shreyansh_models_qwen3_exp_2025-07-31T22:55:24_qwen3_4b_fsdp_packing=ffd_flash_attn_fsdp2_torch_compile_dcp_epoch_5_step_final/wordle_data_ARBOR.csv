### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to use a word with a mix of these common letters to maximize information gain.

One of the most common starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common ending letter)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word at all (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but NOT in the 3rd position.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, or E.

Since A is present, let’s look for a word that:
1. Uses A somewhere other than position 3.
2. Avoids S, L, T, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common consonants: R, N, C, H, D, M, P, B, G, F, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A is already known).

A good candidate is “CRANK”:
- C, R, N, K are common and not yet ruled out.
- A is in position 4 (not position 3).
- No S, L, T, E.

Let’s try CRANK.

Let’s summarize what we know so far.

Letters that are NOT in the word at all (x):
S, L, T, E, C, N, K

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
A (must NOT be in position 3)  
R (must be in position 2, because R(✓) in CRANK means it is in the correct spot)

So the word has the form:
_ R _ _ _

and must contain A somewhere, but NOT in position 3.  
That means A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

We also know the remaining letters must not be any of the eliminated ones (S, L, T, E, C, N, K).  
So possible letters left include: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus A and R.

We need a common English 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ R _ _ _ and contains A in one of the allowed positions (1, 4, 5).

Let’s list possible candidates:
- A R _ _ _ : ARDOR, ARBOR, ARGON, ARGUS, ARROW, ARGOT, etc.
- _ R A _ _ : BRAGS, DRAGS, FRAGS, GRASP, PRANK (but N,K are out), TRAMP (but T is out), etc.
- _ R _ A _ : BRISK (but S,K are out), DRAMA (but M is okay, A is in position 4), GRASP (but S is out), PRANK (N,K out), etc.
- _ R _ _ A : BRISK (S,K out), DRAMA (but M is okay, A in position 5), GRASP (S out), etc.

Among these, the most common and valid words are:
- DRAMA (D, R, A, M, A) – contains A in position 3, but position 3 is already ruled out for A (from SLATE feedback). So A cannot be in position 3.
- ARGOT (A, R, G, O, T) – T is eliminated.
- ARBOR (A, R, B, O, R) – contains A in position 1.
- BRAGS (B, R, A, G, S) – S is eliminated.
- GRASP (G, R, A, S, P) – S is eliminated.
- PRANK (P, R, A, N, K) – N, K are eliminated.
- ARGON (A, R, G, O, N) – N is eliminated.
- ARGUS (A, R, G, U, S) – S is eliminated.
- ARGOT (A, R, G, O, T) – T is eliminated.

The only remaining valid word that fits all constraints is:
- ARBOR (A, R, B, O, R) – A is in position 1 (allowed), R is in position 2 (correct), B, O are new letters, no eliminated letters appear.

Let’s go with ARBOR.

So the word has the form:

and must contain A somewhere, but NOT in position 3.  
That means A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

We also know the remaining letters must not be any of the eliminated ones (S, L, T, E, C, N, K).

- _ R _ _ A : BRISK (S,K out), DRAMA (but M is okay, A in position 5), GRASP (S out), etc.

Among these, the most common and valid words are:
- DRAMA (D, R, A, M, A) – contains A in position 3, but position 3 is already ruled out for A (from SLATE feedback). So A cannot be in position 3.
- ARGOT (A, R, G, O, T) – T is eliminated.
- ARBOR (A, R, B, O, R) – contains A in position 1.
- BRAGS (B, R, A, G, S) – S is eliminated.
- GRASP (G, R, A, S, P) – S is eliminated.
- PRANK (P, R, A, N, K) – N, K are eliminated.
- ARGON (A, R, G, O, N) – N is eliminated.
- ARGUS (A, R, G, U, S) – S is eliminated.
- ARGOT (A, R, G, O, T) – T is eliminated.
