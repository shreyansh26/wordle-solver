### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English are vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N, etc. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is a strong first guess because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions, which should help narrow down the secret word efficiently.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word AND in the correct position (✓) at position 2
- A is in the word but NOT in the correct position (✓) – so A is somewhere else
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word AND in the correct position (✓) at position 5

So we now know:
- Word pattern: _ L _ _ E
- Letters definitely present: L, A, E
- Letters definitely absent: S, T

Next, I want a word that:
1. Fits the pattern _ L _ _ E
2. Contains A somewhere (but not in position 3, since A was in position 3 and marked “wrong position”)
3. Uses other common letters not yet tested (R, N, I, O, C, etc.)
4. Avoids S and T entirely

A good candidate is “FLAME”:
- F: new letter
- L: already confirmed at position 2
- A: confirmed present, but now in position 3 (was in 3 before but feedback said “wrong position”, so this is a new position)
- M: new letter
- E: confirmed at position 5

This should give us more information about positions 1, 3, and 4 while testing new letters.

1. SLATE → S(x) L(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
   - Pattern: _ L _ _ E
   - Letters known: L (pos 2), A (somewhere), E (pos 5)
   - Letters absent: S, T

2. FLAME → F(✓) L(✓) A(✓) M(x) E(✓)
   - Pattern still: _ L _ _ E
   - Now we know:
     - F is in the word and in the correct position (pos 1)
     - A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (since FLAME had A in pos 3 and feedback was “✓” meaning it’s in the word but wrong position; but in FLAME A was in position 3 and feedback was “✓” meaning it is in the word but not in that position. However, in SLATE A was in position 3 and feedback was “✓” meaning it is in the word but not in that position. Wait, actually in SLATE the feedback for A was “✓” meaning it is in the word but not in position 3. In FLAME the feedback for A was “✓” meaning it is in the word but not in position 3 again. So A is in the word but not in position 3. So A must be in position 4.

   - M is not in the word (x)
   - E is in position 5 (✓)

So the pattern is now: F L _ A E

We need a 5-letter word that starts with FL and ends with AE, with A in position 4. The only common word fitting this pattern is “FLAKE”.

Let’s check:
- F: pos 1 ✓
- L: pos 2 ✓
- A: pos 4 (new position)
- K: new letter
- E: pos 5 ✓

This should confirm the remaining letters.
