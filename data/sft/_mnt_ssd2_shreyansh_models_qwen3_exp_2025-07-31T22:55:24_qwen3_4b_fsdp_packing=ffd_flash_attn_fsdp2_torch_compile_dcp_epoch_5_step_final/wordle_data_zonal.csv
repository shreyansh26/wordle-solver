For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities quickly. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters to maximize the chance of getting hits.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This should give us valuable information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R is not in the word at all (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (not 3rd).
- S and E are not in the word (x).

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, O (and possibly others we haven’t tested yet)

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and O (in different positions from before).
2. Avoids R, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, D, C, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and O are already confirmed).

A good candidate is “TAOIN”:
- Uses T, A, O, I, N.
- Places A in position 2 (was 1st before) and O in position 3 (was 3rd before) – both are wrong positions, so they’ll give us new placement info.
- Uses N and I, which are common and haven’t been tested yet.
- Avoids R, S, E.

This should help us narrow down the word effectively.

Actually, in Guess 3 (COUND) the N was in position 4 and marked “-”, meaning N is in the word but not in position 4. So N could be in positions 1, 2, or 5.

“PLANO” has:
- P(1), L(2), A(3) – but A cannot be in 3 (from Guess 1 and 3). So this is invalid.

Let’s try “LANCO”:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities quickly. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters to maximize the chance of getting hits.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This should give us valuable information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R is not in the word at all (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (not 3rd).
- S and E are not in the word (x).

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, O (and possibly others we haven’t tested yet)

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and O (in different positions from before).
2. Avoids R, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, D, C, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and O are already confirmed).

A good candidate is “TAOIN”:
- Uses T, A, O, I, N.
- Places A in position 2 (was 1st before) and O in position 3 (was 3rd before) – both are wrong positions, so they’ll give us new placement info.
- Uses N and I, which are common and haven’t been tested yet.
- Avoids R, S, E.

This should help us narrow down the word effectively.

Positions we have ruled out:
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 2
- O cannot be in positions 3 or 4
- N cannot be in position 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, O, N exactly once each (no repeats of these letters)
- Does NOT contain R, S, E, T, I
- Places A somewhere other than 1 or 2
- Places O somewhere other than 3 or 4
- Places N somewhere other than 5

Remaining common consonants we haven’t ruled out: C, D, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels we haven’t ruled out: U (since A and O are already confirmed)

A good candidate that satisfies all constraints is “COUND”:
- C, U, N, D are all new letters
- It contains A (position 3) and O (position 4) in new spots
- N is in position 3, which is allowed
- No forbidden letters appear

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities quickly. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters to maximize the chance of getting hits.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This should give us valuable information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R is not in the word at all (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (not 3rd).
- S and E are not in the word (x).

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, O (and possibly others we haven’t tested yet)

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and O (in different positions from before).
2. Avoids R, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, D, C, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and O are already confirmed).

A good candidate is “TAOIN”:
- Uses T, A, O, I, N.
- Places A in position 2 (was 1st before) and O in position 3 (was 3rd before) – both are wrong positions, so they’ll give us new placement info.
- Uses N and I, which are common and haven’t been tested yet.
- Avoids R, S, E.

This should help us narrow down the word effectively.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E, T, I  
Letters that ARE in the word: A, O, N (each confirmed in the wrong position so far)

Positions we have ruled out:
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 2
- O cannot be in positions 3 or 4
- N cannot be in position 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, O, N exactly once each (no repeats of these letters)
- Does NOT contain R, S, E, T, I
- Places A somewhere other than 1 or 2
- Places O somewhere other than 3 or 4
- Places N somewhere other than 5

Remaining common consonants we haven’t ruled out: C, D, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels we haven’t ruled out: U (since A and O are already confirmed)

A good candidate that satisfies all constraints is “COUND”:
- C, U, N, D are all new letters
- It contains A (position 3) and O (position 4) in new spots
- N is in position 3, which is allowed
- No forbidden letters appear

From the three rounds we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E, T, I, C, U, D  
Letters that ARE in the word: A, O, N (each confirmed in the wrong position so far)

Positions we have ruled out:
- A cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from Guess 1: A was 1st, Guess 2: A was 2nd, Guess 3: A was 3rd)
- O cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (from Guess 1: O was 3rd, Guess 3: O was 4th)
- N cannot be in positions 3 or 5 (from Guess 2: N was 5th, Guess 3: N was 4th)

So far:
- A must be in position 4 or 5
- O must be in position 1, 2, or 5 (but 5 is also possible for A)
- N must be in position 1, 2, or 4 (but 4 is also possible for A)

We still need two more letters, and the only remaining common consonants are L, M, P, Y, etc.  
A good candidate that satisfies all constraints is “PLANO”:
- P, L are new letters
- A is in position 4 (allowed)
- O is in position 5 (allowed)
- N is in position 3 (but wait, N was ruled out for position 3 in Guess 3 feedback: N was 4th and marked “-” so position 3 is allowed for N? Let me double-check.)

Actually, in Guess 3 (COUND) the N was in position 4 and marked “-”, meaning N is in the word but not in position 4. So N could be in positions 1, 2, or 5.

“PLANO” has:
- P(1), L(2), A(3) – but A cannot be in 3 (from Guess 1 and 3). So this is invalid.

Let’s try “LANCO”:
- L(1), A(2) – but A cannot be in 2 (from Guess 2). Invalid.

“PANOR” – but R is ruled out.

“NOBLE” – but B and L are okay, E is ruled out.

“NAPAL” – but A is repeated and A cannot be in 1 or 2.

Let’s try “PAULN” – but N is 5th, which is allowed, and A is 2nd – but A cannot be 2nd. Invalid.

Let’s try “ALOHA” – but A is repeated and H is okay, but we have no info on H yet. Also A is 1st and 2nd – but A cannot be 1st or 2nd. Invalid.

Let’s try “PONAL” – but A is 3rd, which is invalid.

Let’s try “OLANA” – but A is 4th and 5th, which is invalid.

Let’s try “PANOY” – but Y is okay, but O is 1st, A is 3rd – invalid.

Let’s try “LONNA” – but A is 4th and 5th, and N is 3rd – invalid.

Let’s try “PLANO” again – A is 3rd – invalid.

Let’s try “MANGO”:
- M(1), A(2) – but A cannot be 2nd. Invalid.

“MOLAN”:
- M(1), O(2), L(3), A(4), N(5)
- A is 4th (allowed)
- O is 2nd (allowed)
- N is 5th (allowed)
- No forbidden letters
- Uses new letters M, L

This seems valid.

From the latest feedback:

Positions:
- 1: G(x) → G is not in the word
- 2: O(✓) → O is in the word and in position 2
- 3: N(✓) → N is in the word and in position 3
- 4: A(✓) → A is in the word and in position 4
- 5: L(✓) → L is in the word and in position 5

So the word must be: _ O N A L

Only the first letter is unknown.  
Letters already ruled out: R, S, E, T, I, C, U, D, M, G  
Remaining common consonants for position 1: B, F, H, J, K, P, V, W, Y, Z

Looking for valid 5-letter words that fit _ONAL:
- BONAL – not a recognized word
- FONAL – not a word
- HONAL – not a word
- JONAL – not a word
- KONAL – not a word
- PONAL – not a word
