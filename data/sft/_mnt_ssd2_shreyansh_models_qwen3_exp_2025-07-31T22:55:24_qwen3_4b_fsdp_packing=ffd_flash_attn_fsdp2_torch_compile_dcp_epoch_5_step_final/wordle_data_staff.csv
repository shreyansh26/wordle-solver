2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. 

Looking at common letters in English: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C.

A word that uses several of these common letters is ""AROSE"". It contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. This should give me good information about which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" but AROSE covers more vowels and common consonants. I'll go with ""AROSE"".

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is somewhere else).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so S is somewhere else).
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
Letters to avoid: R, O, E  
Letters that are in the word: A, S  
Positions of A and S are unknown (they are not in the first and fourth positions respectively).

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- contains both A and S  
- does not contain R, O, or E  
- places A and S in new positions (not 1st and 4th respectively).

Good candidate letters left: T, N, L, I, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

Let’s try a word that places A and S in different spots and uses other common consonants. A good choice is “SLANT”:
- S is now in position 1 (was 4 before)  
- L, N, T are new letters  
- A is now in position 3 (was 1 before)  

This should help narrow down the remaining letters and positions.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. 

Looking at common letters in English: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C.

A word that uses several of these common letters is ""AROSE"". It contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. This should give me good information about which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" but AROSE covers more vowels and common consonants. I'll go with ""AROSE"".

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is somewhere else).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so S is somewhere else).
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
Letters to avoid: R, O, E  
Letters that are in the word: A, S  
Positions of A and S are unknown (they are not in the first and fourth positions respectively).

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- contains both A and S  
- does not contain R, O, or E  
- places A and S in new positions (not 1st and 4th respectively).

Good candidate letters left: T, N, L, I, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

Let’s try a word that places A and S in different spots and uses other common consonants. A good choice is “SLANT”:
- S is now in position 1 (was 4 before)  
- L, N, T are new letters  
- A is now in position 3 (was 1 before)  

This should help narrow down the remaining letters and positions.

From the new feedback on SLANT:
- S(✓) – the S is in the correct first position.
- L(x) – L is not in the word.
- A(✓) – the A is in the correct third position.
- N(x) – N is not in the word.
- T(-) – T is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 5th).

So far we know:
1. First letter is S.
2. Third letter is A.
3. The word contains T, but T is not in the 5th position.
4. Letters to avoid so far: R, O, E, L, N.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S
- Has A in the 3rd position
- Contains T somewhere except the 5th position
- Does not contain R, O, E, L, N

Possible letters left: T, U, I, C, D, M, P, etc.

Since T must be in positions 2 or 4 (because 1,3,5 are taken by S,A,? and T cannot be in 5), let's try T in position 2 or 4.

A good candidate is ""STAMP"":
- S in 1, T in 2, A in 3, M and P are new letters.
- This places T in position 2 (allowed) and introduces new letters M and P.

Let's check if this fits all constraints:
- S ✓, A ✓ (positions 1 and 3 correct)
- T is in position 2 (not 5, so okay)
- No R, O, E, L, N

""STAMP"" seems like a good next guess.

- Does not contain R, O, E, L, N

Possible letters left: T, U, I, C, D, M, P, etc.

Since T must be in positions 2 or 4 (because 1,3,5 are taken by S,A,? and T cannot be in 5), let's try T in position 2 or 4.

A good candidate is ""STAMP"":
- S in 1, T in 2, A in 3, M and P are new letters.
- This places T in position 2 (allowed) and introduces new letters M and P.

Let's check if this fits all constraints:
- S ✓, A ✓ (positions 1 and 3 correct)
- T is in position 2 (not 5, so okay)
- No R, O, E, L, N

""STAMP"" seems like a good next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)

Guess 3: STAMP -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) A(✓) M(x) P(x)

From the latest feedback on STAMP:

- S(✓) – first letter is correct (position 1).
- T(✓) – second letter is correct (position 2).
- A(✓) – third letter is correct (position 3).
- M(x) – M is not in the word at all.
- P(x) – P is not in the word at all.

So the pattern we now know is:

S T A _ _

and the last two letters must be chosen from letters that have not been ruled out so far. Letters already excluded are: R, O, E, L, N, M, P.

We still need two more letters for positions 4 and 5. Common remaining consonants are C, D, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc., and vowels left are I, U.

Let’s think of words that fit STA _ _ and use only allowed letters. Possible endings:

- STAIN – but I and N: N is excluded.
- STARK – R is excluded.
- STAGY – G and Y are allowed.
- STASH – H is allowed, but S is already used twice (but that’s okay since letters can repeat unless ruled out).
- STADI – D and I are allowed.

STADI is a valid 5-letter word meaning a stadium (plural of stadium). It fits:

- S T A D I
- All letters are allowed (D and I not excluded).
- Uses only remaining allowed letters.

Therefore, STADI is a good next guess.

From the feedback so far:

- First three letters are locked in: S T A _ _
- Letters already ruled out: R, O, E, L, N, M, P, D, I

Remaining unused letters (common ones): C, G, H, K, V, W, Y, U

We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5. The word must be a real 5-letter English word that starts with STA and uses only the remaining letters.

Possible endings:

- STACH – not a valid word.
- STAGY – valid word (a style of dress).
- STASH – uses S twice (allowed), but S is already used.
- STAWY – not valid.
- STACY – C and Y are allowed, but Y is sometimes vowel-like.
- STAGY is valid and fits the pattern.

Let’s check STAGY:

- S T A G Y
- G and Y are both allowed.
- STAGY is a recognized word (a type of dress or a style).

Therefore, STAGY is the logical next guess.
