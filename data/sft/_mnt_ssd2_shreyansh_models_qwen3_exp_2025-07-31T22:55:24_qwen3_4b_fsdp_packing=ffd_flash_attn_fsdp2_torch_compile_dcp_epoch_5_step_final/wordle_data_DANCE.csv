### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, I, O, U, R, S, T, L, N, etc. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common letter overall)

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting several letters in the secret word early on.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T are not in the word at all (x).
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position (-).
- E is in the word and in the 5th position (✓).

So the word ends with E and contains an A somewhere other than position 3. Since S, L, T are out, we need to pick new letters.

I should avoid S, L, T and look for other common letters. Let’s try a word that:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Has A in a different spot (positions 1, 2, 4).
- Uses other common letters like R, N, I, O, C, etc.

A good candidate is “CRANE”:

- Ends with E.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(✓)

   – A is somewhere in the word but not in position 3.

2. CRANE → C(-) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(✓)

   – R is not in the word (x).
   – A is in the word but not in position 3 (again).
   – N is in the word but not in position 4.
   – E is still in position 5 (✓).

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, R
- Letters that ARE in the word: C, A, N, E
- E is fixed at position 5.
- A must appear in positions 1, 2, or 4 (since it cannot be 3 or 5).
- C must appear in positions 2, 3, 4 (cannot be 1).
- N must appear in positions 1, 2, 3 (cannot be 4).

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that contains C, A, N, and one more letter (which must be different from S, L, T, R).

Let’s list possible positions:
- Position 5: E (fixed)
- Position 1, 2, 3, 4 must contain C, A, N, and one other letter.

Possible arrangements:
- C, A, N can be in positions 1-4 in any order, but respecting the restrictions above.

One valid arrangement: C in position 2, A in position 4, N in position 1 → N C A _ E
That gives the word “NCAxE” – but we need a valid English word. “NCAxE” isn’t valid, so let’s think of real words.

Another arrangement: N in position 1, C in position 2, A in position 4 → N C A _ E → “NCAxE” again invalid.

Let’s try A in position 2, C in position 3, N in position 1 → N A C _ E → “NACxE” invalid.

Next: A in position 2, N in position 3, C in position 4 → _ A N C E → “_ANCE” – valid words: “BANCE” (invalid), “MANCE” (invalid), “PANCE” (invalid), “WANCE” (invalid), “HANCE” (invalid), “VANCE” (valid English word).

“VANCE”:
- V (new letter)
- A (position 2 – allowed)
- N (position 3 – allowed)
- C (position 4 – allowed)
- E (position 5 – fixed)

This satisfies all constraints:
- No S, L, T, R.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, I, O, U, R, S, T, L, N, etc. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:\n- S (very common starting letter)\n- L (common consonant)\n- A (most common vowel)\n- T (very common ending letter)\n- E (most common letter overall)\n\nThis combination gives me a good chance of hitting several letters in the secret word early on.\n\n<guess>SLATE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on SLATE:\n- S, L, T are not in the word at all (x).\n- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position (-).\n- E is in the word and in the 5th position (✓).\n\nSo the word ends with E and contains an A somewhere other than position 3.

From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, R, V
- Letters that ARE in the word and in the correct positions: A (position 2), N (position 3), C (position 4), E (position 5)
- The word has the pattern: _ A N C E

The only letter we still need to determine is the first letter (position 1). It must be a consonant (since A, N, C, E are already used and we can’t repeat letters we know are not in the word).

Common first letters for 5-letter words ending in “ANCE” include:
- B (BANCE – not a valid word)
- D (DANCE – valid word)
- F (FANCE – not a valid word)
- G (GANCE – not a valid word)
- H (HANCE – not a valid word)
- J (JANCE – not a valid word)
- K (KANCE – not a valid word)
- M (MANCE – not a valid word)
- P (PANCE – not a valid word)
- W (WANCE – not a valid word)
- Y (YANCE – not a valid word)

The only valid English word that fits the pattern is “DANCE”.

Therefore, the correct word must be DANCE.
