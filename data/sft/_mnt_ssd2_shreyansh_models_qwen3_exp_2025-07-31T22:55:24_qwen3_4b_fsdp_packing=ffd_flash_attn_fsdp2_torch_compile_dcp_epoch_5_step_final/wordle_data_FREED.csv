### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to pick a word with a mix of these common letters to test multiple possibilities at once.

One such word is ""AROSE"":
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S).
- This gives us a good chance of hitting one or more letters in the secret word right away.
- The letters A, R, O, S, E are all very common in English words.

This should provide strong feedback for our next guesses based on the results.

Let’s digest the new feedback on “rebel”:

1. R(-) – the letter R is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
2. E(-) – the letter E is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
3. B(x) – B is NOT in the word.  
4. E(✓) – the letter E is in position 4.  
5. L(x) – L is NOT in the word.

Combining everything we now know:

- Pattern: _ _ _ E _ (E is fixed in position 4)
- Word must contain R somewhere (but not in position 1)
- Word must contain E (already fixed in position 4)
- Letters NOT allowed: A, O, S, B, L

So the word looks like: _ _ _ E _ with R somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends in E (position 4)
- Has R in position 2, 3, or 5
- Does NOT contain A, O, S, B, L

Let’s brainstorm possibilities:
- If R is in position 2: R _ _ E _
- If R is in position 3: _ _ R E _
- If R is in position 5: _ _ _ E R

Looking for common words:
- “RIDGE” – but D and G are allowed, and R is in position 1 (forbidden)
- “PRIET” – not a valid word
- “CRUEL” – L is forbidden
- “GREED” – D is allowed, but R is in position 2, E in 4, and no forbidden letters. Let’s check:
  - G, R, E, E, D – all letters are allowed (not A, O, S, B, L)
  - Pattern: G R _ E _ – but we need R in position 2 or 3. G R E E D has R in position 2, E in 4, which fits.

Wait, let me verify:
- G R E E D: letters are G, R, E, E, D
- R is in position 2 (allowed, since R is only forbidden in position 1)
- E is in position 4 (matches the feedback)
- Does not contain A, O, S, B, L – correct
- It is a valid English word.

But let me think if there’s another word that uses different letters. Another possibility is “TREED”:
- T, R, E, E, D – all allowed letters
- R in position 2 (allowed)
- E in position 4 (matches)
- No forbidden letters

Between “GREED” and “TREED”, both fit. I’ll go with “TREED” as it uses T and D which haven’t been tested yet.

But wait, let me double-check constraints:
- Pattern: _ _ _ E _
- R must be in 2, 3, or 5
- TREED: T R E E D
  - R in position 2 (allowed)
  - E in position 4 (matches)
  - No forbidden letters (A, O, S, B, L absent)
  - Valid word

This seems solid.

- “GREED” – D is allowed, but R is in position 2, E in 4, and no forbidden letters. Let’s check:
  - G, R, E, E, D – all letters are allowed (not A, O, S, B, L)
  - Pattern: G R _ E _ – but we need R in position 2 or 3. G R E E D has R in position 2, E in 4, which fits.

Wait, let me verify:
- G R E E D: letters are G, R, E, E, D
- R is in position 2 (allowed, since R is only forbidden in position 1)
- E is in position 4 (matches the feedback)
- Does not contain A, O, S, B, L – correct
- It is a valid English word.

But let me think if there’s another word that uses different letters. Another possibility is “TREED”:
- T, R, E, E, D – all allowed letters
- R in position 2 (allowed)
- E in position 4 (matches)
- No forbidden letters

Between “GREED” and “TREED”, both fit. I’ll go with “TREED” as it uses T and D which haven’t been tested yet.

But wait, let me double-check constraints:
- Pattern: _ _ _ E _
- R must be in 2, 3, or 5
- TREED: T R E E D
  - R in position 2 (allowed)
  - E in position 4 (matches)
  - No forbidden letters (A, O, S, B, L absent)
  - Valid word

This seems solid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to pick a word with a mix of these common letters to test multiple possibilities at once.

One such word is ""AROSE"":
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S).
- This gives us a good chance of hitting one or more letters in the secret word right away.
- The letters A, R, O, S, E are all very common in English words.

This should provide strong feedback for our next guesses based on the results.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the correct position (✓) – so the word starts with R
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so the word contains an E, but not in the 5th position

So far we know:
1. Pattern: R _ _ _ _
2. Contains E somewhere in positions 2-4
3. Does NOT contain A, O, S

We need a new 5-letter word that starts with R, has E somewhere in positions 2-4, and avoids A, O, S.

Possible candidates:
- R E _ _ _ (E in position 2)
- R _ E _ _
- R _ _ E _

Let’s pick a word that tests new common letters while satisfying these constraints. ""REBEL"" is a good choice:
- Starts with R
- Has E in position 2
- Uses B, E, L (all common letters)
- Avoids A, O, S

Guess 2: rebel -> FEEDBACK: R(-) E(-) B(x) E(✓) L(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s digest the new feedback on “rebel”:

1. R(-) – the letter R is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
2. E(-) – the letter E is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
3. B(x) – B is NOT in the word.  
4. E(✓) – the letter E is in position 4.  
5. L(x) – L is NOT in the word.

Combining everything we now know:

- Pattern: _ _ _ E _ (E is fixed in position 4)
- Word must contain R somewhere (but not in position 1)
- Word must contain E (already fixed in position 4)
- Letters NOT allowed: A, O, S, B, L

So the word looks like: _ _ _ E _ with R somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends in E (position 4)
- Has R in position 2, 3, or 5
- Does NOT contain A, O, S, B, L

Let’s brainstorm possibilities:
- If R is in position 2: R _ _ E _
- If R is in position 3: _ _ R E _
- If R is in position 5: _ _ _ E R

Looking for common words:
- “RIDGE” – but D and G are allowed, and R is in position 1 (forbidden)
- “PRIET” – not a valid word
- “CRUEL” – L is forbidden
- “GREED” – D is allowed, but R is in position 2, E in 4, and no forbidden letters. Let’s check:
  - G, R, E, E, D – all letters are allowed (not A, O, S, B, L)
  - Pattern: G R _ E _ – but we need R in position 2 or 3. G R E E D has R in position 2, E in 4, which fits.

Wait, let me verify:
- G R E E D: letters are G, R, E, E, D
- R is in position 2 (allowed, since R is only forbidden in position 1)
- E is in position 4 (matches the feedback)
- Does not contain A, O, S, B, L – correct
- It is a valid English word.

But let me think if there’s another word that uses different letters. Another possibility is “TREED”:
- T, R, E, E, D – all allowed letters
- R in position 2 (allowed)
- E in position 4 (matches)
- No forbidden letters

Between “GREED” and “TREED”, both fit. I’ll go with “TREED” as it uses T and D which haven’t been tested yet.

But wait, let me double-check constraints:
- Pattern: _ _ _ E _
- R must be in 2, 3, or 5
- TREED: T R E E D
  - R in position 2 (allowed)
  - E in position 4 (matches)
  - No forbidden letters (A, O, S, B, L absent)
  - Valid word

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to pick a word with a mix of these common letters to test multiple possibilities at once.

One such word is ""AROSE"":
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S).
- This gives us a good chance of hitting one or more letters in the secret word right away.
- The letters A, R, O, S, E are all very common in English words.

This should provide strong feedback for our next guesses based on the results.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the correct position (✓) – so the word starts with R
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so the word contains an E, but not in the 5th position

So far we know:
1. Pattern: R _ _ _ _
2. Contains E somewhere in positions 2-4
3. Does NOT contain A, O, S

We need a new 5-letter word that starts with R, has E somewhere in positions 2-4, and avoids A, O, S.

Possible candidates:
- R E _ _ _ (E in position 2)
- R _ E _ _
- R _ _ E _

Let’s pick a word that tests new common letters while satisfying these constraints. ""REBEL"" is a good choice:
- Starts with R
- Has E in position 2
- Uses B, E, L (all common letters)
- Avoids A, O, S

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: rebel -> FEEDBACK: R(-) E(-) B(x) E(✓) L(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s digest the new feedback on “rebel”:

1. R(-) – the letter R is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
2. E(-) – the letter E is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
3. B(x) – B is NOT in the word.  
4. E(✓) – the letter E is in position 4.  
5. L(x) – L is NOT in the word.

Combining everything we now know:

- Pattern: _ _ _ E _ (E is fixed in position 4)
- Word must contain R somewhere (but not in position 1)
- Word must contain E (already fixed in position 4)
- Letters NOT allowed: A, O, S, B, L

So the word looks like: _ _ _ E _ with R somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends in E (position 4)
- Has R in position 2, 3, or 5
- Does NOT contain A, O, S, B, L

Let’s brainstorm possibilities:
- If R is in position 2: R _ _ E _
- If R is in position 3: _ _ R E _
- If R is in position 5: _ _ _ E R

Looking for common words:
- “RIDGE” – but D and G are allowed, and R is in position 1 (forbidden)
- “PRIET” – not a valid word
- “CRUEL” – L is forbidden
- “GREED” – D is allowed, but R is in position 2, E in 4, and no forbidden letters. Let’s check:
  - G, R, E, E, D – all letters are allowed (not A, O, S, B, L)
  - Pattern: G R _ E _ – but we need R in position 2 or 3. G R E E D has R in position 2, E in 4, which fits.

Wait, let me verify:
- G R E E D: letters are G, R, E, E, D
- R is in position 2 (allowed, since R is only forbidden in position 1)
- E is in position 4 (matches the feedback)
- Does not contain A, O, S, B, L – correct
- It is a valid English word.

But let me think if there’s another word that uses different letters. Another possibility is “TREED”:
- T, R, E, E, D – all allowed letters
- R in position 2 (allowed)
- E in position 4 (matches)
- No forbidden letters

Between “GREED” and “TREED”, both fit. I’ll go with “TREED” as it uses T and D which haven’t been tested yet.

But wait, let me double-check constraints:
- Pattern: _ _ _ E _
- R must be in 2, 3, or 5
- TREED: T R E E D
  - R in position 2 (allowed)
  - E in position 4 (matches)
  - No forbidden letters (A, O, S, B, L absent)
  - Valid word

This seems solid.
