For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants like R, S, T, N, L. 

A good first guess would be ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel in English)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test positions and frequencies.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: R, O, S
- Letters we must include: A, E

We need a word that:
1. Contains both A and E
2. Does not contain R, O, S
3. Has A not in position 1
4. Has E not in position 5

A good next guess should test new common consonants while satisfying these constraints. Let's try ""AUDIO"":
- Contains A and E (A in 2nd, E not present) → no, we need both A and E.
Let's try ""ADEPT"":
- Contains A and E (A in 1st, E in 2nd) → A is in 1st position, which is invalid.
Let's try ""EJECT"":
- Contains E and J, C, T. We need A.
Let's try ""ELATE"":
- Contains E, L, A, T, E. A is in 3rd, E in 1st and 5th. But E is in 5th position, which is invalid.

From the two guesses so far we know:

1. Letters not in the word at all: R, O, S, T
2. Letters that are in the word but whose exact positions we still don’t know:
   – A (not in positions 1 or 2)
   – E (not in positions 4 or 5)
3. A single letter that we now know is in the correct position: C in position 3
4. Therefore the word has the form: _ _ C _ _

We also know that:
- The word must contain both A and E somewhere in the remaining two blanks (positions 1, 2, 4, 5), but:
  – A cannot be in position 1 or 2
  – E cannot be in position 4 or 5

That leaves:
- A must be in position 4 or 5
- E must be in position 1 or 2

Let’s list all possible patterns that fit:
Pattern A: E _ C A _  → but position 5 is still open, and we have only A and E confirmed so far. We need to check if this is a valid word.
Pattern B: E _ C _ A  → same idea
Pattern C: _ E C A _  → A in 4, E in 2
Pattern D: _ E C _ A  → A in 5, E in 2
Pattern E: A _ C E _  → but A cannot be in position 1 or 2, so invalid
Pattern F: _ A C E _  → A in 2, invalid
Pattern G: A _ C E _  → same
Pattern H: _ _ C E A  → E in 4, invalid

So the valid patterns are:
- E _ C A _ (but we don’t know the 2nd and 5th letters yet)
- _ E C A _
- _ E C _ A

Let’s look for real 5-letter words that fit these patterns and do not contain R, O, S, T.

Looking at pattern _ E C A _:
- Possible words: BECAU (invalid), PECAU (invalid), CECAU (invalid) – none seem valid.
- Maybe “PEACH” – but it has H, which we haven’t tested yet. However, we need to check if it contains A and E in the correct positions.
  – P E A C H: A is in 3rd, which is invalid (C is in 3rd).
- “MECCA”: M E C C A – C is in 3rd, A is in 5th. This fits:
  – M E C C A: positions are 1:M, 2:E, 3:C, 4:C, 5:A
  – Contains A (position 5) and E (position 2), and C is in correct position.
  – No R, O, S, T.

Pattern _ E C _ A:
- Possible words: BECAU (invalid), PECAU (invalid), CECAU (invalid) – none seem valid.
- “PEACH” again doesn’t fit.

Pattern E _ C A _:
- E _ C A _ – let’s think of words:
  – E G C A _ – no
  – E N C A _ – no
  – E X C A _ – no
  – E D C A _ – no
  – E B C A _ – no

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants like R, S, T, N, L. 

A good first guess would be ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel in English)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test positions and frequencies.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: R, O, S
- Letters we must include: A, E
- Positions to avoid: A not in 1st, E not in 5th

We need a word that:
1. Contains both A and E
2. Does not contain R, O, S
3. Has A not in position 1
4. Has E not in position 5

A good next guess should test new common consonants while satisfying these constraints. Let's try ""AUDIO"":
- Contains A and E (A in 2nd, E not present) → no, we need both A and E.
Let's try ""ADEPT"":
- Contains A and E (A in 1st, E in 2nd) → A is in 1st position, which is invalid.
Let's try ""EJECT"":
- Contains E and J, C, T. We need A.
Let's try ""ELATE"":
- Contains E, L, A, T, E. A is in 3rd, E in 1st and 5th. But E is in 5th position, which is invalid.
Let's try ""TACET"":
- Contains T, A, C, E, T. A is in 2nd, E in 4th. No R, O, S. This seems valid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants like R, S, T, N, L. 

A good first guess would be ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel in English)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test positions and frequencies.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: R, O, S
- Letters we must include: A, E
- Positions to avoid: A not in 1st, E not in 5th

We need a word that:
1. Contains both A and E
2. Does not contain R, O, S
3. Has A not in position 1
4. Has E not in position 5

A good next guess should test new common consonants while satisfying these constraints. Let's try ""AUDIO"":
- Contains A and E (A in 2nd, E not present) → no, we need both A and E.
Let's try ""ADEPT"":
- Contains A and E (A in 1st, E in 2nd) → A is in 1st position, which is invalid.
Let's try ""EJECT"":
- Contains E and J, C, T. We need A.
Let's try ""ELATE"":
- Contains E, L, A, T, E. A is in 3rd, E in 1st and 5th. But E is in 5th position, which is invalid.
Let's try ""TACET"":

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants like R, S, T, N, L. 

A good first guess would be ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel in English)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test positions and frequencies.

- Letters to avoid: R, O, S
- Letters we must include: A, E

We need a word that:
1. Contains both A and E
2. Does not contain R, O, S
3. Has A not in position 1
4. Has E not in position 5

A good next guess should test new common consonants while satisfying these constraints. Let's try ""AUDIO"":

Let's try ""ADEPT"":
- Contains A and E (A in 1st, E in 2nd) → A is in 1st position, which is invalid.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: TACET -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(-) C(✓) E(-) T(x)

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S are not in the word.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. TACET → T(x) A(-) C(✓) E(-) T(x)
   - T is not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 2.
   - C is in the word and in position 3.
   - E is in the word but not in position 4.

So far we know:
- Letters that must appear: A, C, E (with A not in 1st or 2nd, C in 3rd, E not in 4th or 5th)
- Letters that must NOT appear: R, O, S, T
- Positions to consider: 1st (A not here), 2nd (A not here), 3rd (C here), 4th (E not here), 5th (E not here)

The remaining positions to fill are 1st, 2nd, and 5th. We need two more letters that are not R, O, S, T. Common consonants left: N, L, D, G, B, etc.

Let’s try to place A in position 3? No, C is already in 3. A can be in 4 or 5, but E can’t be in 5. So A must be in 4 or 5. But E can’t be in 4 or 5, so E must be in 1 or 2.

Let’s try to place E in position 1:
E _ C _ _
A must go in 4 or 5, but E is in 1, so A must be in 4 or 5. Let’s try A in 4:
E _ C A _
Now we need a consonant for position 2 and 5. Available consonants: N, L, D, G, B, etc.

Let’s try E N C A L:
- E in 1, N in 2, C in 3, A in 4, L in 5.
Check constraints:
- A is in 4 (allowed)
- C is in 3 (matches ✓)
- E is in 1 (allowed)
- No R, O, S, T
- All letters are valid
This seems to fit.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: TACET -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(-) C(✓) E(-) T(x)

From the new feedback on ENCAL:

E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 1  
N(x) → N is not in the word  
C(✓) → C is in the word and in position 3 (matches previous ✓)  
A(✓) → A is in the word and in position 4 (new info)  
L(x) → L is not in the word  

Summary of what we now know:

Letters that must appear: A, C, E (positions: C in 3, A in 4, E somewhere)  
Letters that must NOT appear: R, O, S, T, N, L  

Positions left to fill: 1st, 2nd, 5th  
- E cannot be in 1st or 4th or 5th (from earlier feedback) – but we just saw it’s not in 1st.  
  So E must be in position 2.

So the word looks like:  
_ E C A _

We need one more consonant for position 1 and 5. Available consonants (not R, O, S, T, N, L):  
D, G, B, F, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s pick a common consonant for position 1 and 5.  
A good candidate is D for both positions:  
D E C A D

Check constraints:
- D is allowed (not in forbidden list)  
- E is in position 2 (allowed)  
- C is in position 3 (matches ✓)  
- A is in position 4 (matches ✓)  
- D is allowed in position 5  
- No forbidden letters used  

This seems like the correct word.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters that must appear: A, C, E (with positions: C in 3, A in 4)
- Letters that must NOT appear: R, O, S, T, N, L
- E must be in position 2 (since it cannot be in 1, 4, or 5)

So the pattern is: _ E C A _

We need a consonant for position 1 and 5.  
Available consonants (not in forbidden list): D, G, B, F, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

A common 5-letter word fitting this pattern is “DECAY”:
- D in 1, E in 2, C in 3, A in 4, Y in 5
- All letters are allowed
- Matches the required pattern

Therefore, the next logical guess is DECAY.
