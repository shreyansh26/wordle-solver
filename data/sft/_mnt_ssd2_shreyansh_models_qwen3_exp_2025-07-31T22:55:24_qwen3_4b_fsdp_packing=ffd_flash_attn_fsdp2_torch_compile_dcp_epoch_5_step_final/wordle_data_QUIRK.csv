### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many letters early on. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, T, R, S, etc. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give me good information about several key letters in the secret word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many letters early on. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, T, R, S, etc. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give me good information about several key letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- O: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So we now know:
1. The word does NOT contain A, O, S, E.
2. The word DOES contain R, but not in the 2nd position.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains R (but not in position 2)
- Does NOT contain A, O, S, E
- Uses other common letters to maximize information

Good remaining letters to try: T, N, I, L, U, D, C, M, P, Y, etc.

A strong next guess would use common consonants and vowels while respecting the constraints. Let's try ""TRIUM"":
- T (common consonant)
- R (must be present, not in position 2)
- I (common vowel)
- U (common vowel)
- M (common consonant)

This gives us coverage of several new letters while placing R in a different position (position 1 here).

  - I is in position 3 (from trium)
  - U is in the word but not in position 4 (from trium)

So far we know:
- Position 3 = I
- Must contain R, I, U
- R cannot be in position 2
- U cannot be in position 4
- Letters already ruled out: A, O, S, E, T, M

Remaining common letters to try: N, L, D, C, P, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has I in position 3
2. Contains R and U somewhere else
3. Does not use any of the ruled-out letters
4. Uses new common letters to maximize information

Possible structure: _ _ I _ _
Possible placements for R and U:
- R could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but 3 is I), so 1, 4, or 5
- U could be in 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but 3 is I), so 1, 2, or 5

Let's try to place R and U in new positions and add new common letters. A good candidate is ""CRUIZ"":
- C (new consonant)
- R (must be present, position 2 is ruled out, so position 1 is okay)
- U (must be present, position 4 is ruled out, so position 2 is okay)
- I (fixed in position 3)
- Z (new letter)

But ""CRUIZ"" has Z which is less common. A better choice might be ""CRUEL"":
- C (new)
- R (position 2 is ruled out, so position 1 is okay)
- U (position 2 is okay)
- I (position 3)
- L (new consonant)

This uses common letters and satisfies all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many letters early on. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, T, R, S, etc. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give me good information about several key letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- O: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So we now know:
1. The word does NOT contain A, O, S, E.
2. The word DOES contain R, but not in the 2nd position.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains R (but not in position 2)
- Does NOT contain A, O, S, E
- Uses other common letters to maximize information

Good remaining letters to try: T, N, I, L, U, D, C, M, P, Y, etc.

A strong next guess would use common consonants and vowels while respecting the constraints. Let's try ""TRIUM"":
- T (common consonant)
- R (must be present, not in position 2)
- I (common vowel)
- U (common vowel)
- M (common consonant)

This gives us coverage of several new letters while placing R in a different position (position 1 here).

Guess 2: trium -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) I(✓) U(-) M(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Current constraints:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S, E, T, M
- Letters that ARE in the word: R, I, U
  - R is not in position 2 (from arose) and not in position 2 (from trium)
  - I is in position 3 (from trium)
  - U is in the word but not in position 4 (from trium)

So far we know:
- Position 3 = I
- Must contain R, I, U
- R cannot be in position 2
- U cannot be in position 4
- Letters already ruled out: A, O, S, E, T, M

Remaining common letters to try: N, L, D, C, P, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has I in position 3
2. Contains R and U somewhere else
3. Does not use any of the ruled-out letters
4. Uses new common letters to maximize information

Possible structure: _ _ I _ _
Possible placements for R and U:
- R could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but 3 is I), so 1, 4, or 5
- U could be in 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but 3 is I), so 1, 2, or 5

Let's try to place R and U in new positions and add new common letters. A good candidate is ""CRUIZ"":
- C (new consonant)
- R (must be present, position 2 is ruled out, so position 1 is okay)
- U (must be present, position 4 is ruled out, so position 2 is okay)
- I (fixed in position 3)
- Z (new letter)

But ""CRUIZ"" has Z which is less common. A better choice might be ""CRUEL"":
- C (new)
- R (position 2 is ruled out, so position 1 is okay)
- U (position 2 is okay)
- I (position 3)
- L (new consonant)

This uses common letters and satisfies all constraints.

Current constraints from all feedback:

Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S, E, T, M, C, L  
Letters that ARE in the word: R, I, U  
Positional restrictions:
- R is not in position 2 (from arose) and not in position 2 (from trium) and not in position 2 (from cruel) → R cannot be in position 2  
- I is in position 3 (from trium)  
- U is in the word but not in position 4 (from trium) and not in position 3 (from cruel) → U cannot be in positions 3 or 4  

So far the word looks like: _ _ I _ _  
We still need to place R and U in the remaining positions (1, 4, 5) while respecting the above rules.

Possible placements:
- R could be in 1, 4, or 5  
- U could be in 1, 2, or 5 (but not 3 or 4)  

Let’s try to find a word that:
1. Has I in position 3  
2. Uses R and U in allowed positions  
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (remaining common letters: N, D, P, Y, etc.)

A good candidate is ""DRUIY"":
- D (new letter)  
- R (position 2 is ruled out, so position 1 is okay)  
- U (position 2 is allowed)  
- I (position 3)  
- Y (new letter)

This satisfies all constraints and tests two new common letters (D and Y).

Another candidate could be ""PRUIN"":
- P (new)  
- R (position 1)  
- U (position 2)  
- I (position 3)  
- N (new)

Both are valid, but ""DRUIY"" seems slightly more common. Let’s go with ""DRUIY"".

From all feedback so far we know:

Letters NOT in the word:  
A, O, S, E, T, M, C, L, D, Y  

Letters that ARE in the word:  
R, I, U  

Positional restrictions:
- R is not in position 2 (from arose, trium, cruel, druiy) → cannot be in position 2  
- I is in the word but we have not yet confirmed its exact position (from trium: I was in position 3 and got “-”, meaning it is in the word but not in position 3)  
- U is in the word but not in positions 3, 4, or 5 (from trium, cruel, druiy) → U must be in position 1 or 2  
- We still need to place R and I in the remaining positions while respecting all constraints.

Current word skeleton:  
_ _ _ _ _  
Allowed positions for U: 1 or 2  
Allowed positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5 (cannot be 2)  
Allowed positions for I: 1, 2, 4, 5 (cannot be 3)

We have not yet tested the letters N, P, B, G, F, H, etc.

Let’s try to construct a word that:
- Uses U in position 1 (since it’s allowed and we haven’t tried it there)  
- Uses R in position 3 (a new position for R)  
- Uses I in position 4 (a new position for I)  
- Fills the remaining slots with unused common letters.

A valid candidate is “UNRIP”:
- U (position 1)  
- N (new letter)  
- R (position 3)  
- I (position 4)  
- P (new letter)

This satisfies all constraints:
- U is in position 1 (allowed)  
- R is in position 3 (allowed)  
- I is in position 4 (allowed)  
- No ruled-out letters are used.

Another candidate could be “BURIN”:
- B (new)  
- U (position 2)  
- R (position 3)  
- I (position 4)  
- N (new)

Both are valid, but “UNRIP” uses more common letters (N, P) and keeps U in position 1 which we haven’t tested yet.
