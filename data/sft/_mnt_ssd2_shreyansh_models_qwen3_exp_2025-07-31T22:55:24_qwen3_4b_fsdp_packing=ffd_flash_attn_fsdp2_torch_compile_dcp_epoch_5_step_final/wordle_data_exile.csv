### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained from the feedback. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English
- No repeating letters, so we can test 5 distinct letters
- The letters are in positions that will help us identify which vowels and consonants are present

Summary of known facts:
1. Word ends with E.
2. Contains I, but I is not in positions 3 or 4 (because in UNTIE it was in position 3 and marked wrong, and in WIDGE it was in position 2 and still wrong).
   Therefore I must be in position 1 or 2.
3. Excluded letters so far: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, W, D, G.

Remaining common letters: B, C, F, H, K, L, M, P, V, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing I in position 1 or 2, and using only the allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
- I _ _ _ E
- _ I _ _ E

Let’s brainstorm:
- I _ _ _ E: “ICING” – but C, N, G are excluded; N, G already out. “IBLEE” – not valid.
- _ I _ _ E: “MICEY” – not valid. “BICEP” – not ending in E. “PILCH” – not ending in E. “CLIME” – C, L, M, E; I in position 3 – but I can’t be in 3. “CLIME” is invalid because I is in 3 and already ruled out.

Wait, let’s list valid words ending in E, containing I in 1 or 2, avoiding all excluded letters.

Valid candidates:
- “FIBER” – but B, F, E, R; R is excluded.
- “MICEY” – not valid.
- “PICKY” – not valid.
- “BLIME” – B, L, I, M, E – all allowed letters. I is in position 3 – but we know I cannot be in 3. So this is invalid.

Another approach: try I in position 1 or 2.

I _ _ _ E:
- I _ _ _ E: “ICING” – invalid (N, G excluded).
- “ICED” – too short.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained from the feedback. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English
- No repeating letters, so we can test 5 distinct letters
- The letters are in positions that will help us identify which vowels and consonants are present

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are not in the word (x).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter, E).

So the secret word ends with E and contains none of A, R, O, S.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Ends with E
2. Uses none of A, R, O, S
3. Uses common remaining letters to maximize information

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A, O are ruled out)

A good candidate is ""UNTIE"":
- Ends with E
- Uses U, N, T, I (none of A, R, O, S)
- Common letters

3. Uses common remaining letters to maximize information

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A, O are ruled out)

A good candidate is ""UNTIE"":
- Ends with E
- Uses U, N, T, I (none of A, R, O, S)
- Common letters

From the new feedback on UNTIE:
- U, N, T are not in the word (x).
- I is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- E is still correctly placed at the end (✓).

So we now know:
- Word ends with E.
- Contains the letter I somewhere in positions 1-4 (but not position 4).
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, U, N, T.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tested yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing I, and avoiding all excluded letters. A good candidate is “WIDGE”:

From the new feedback on WIDGE:

- E is confirmed in position 5 (✓).

Summary of known facts:
1. Word ends with E.
2. Contains I, but I is not in positions 3 or 4 (because in UNTIE it was in position 3 and marked wrong, and in WIDGE it was in position 2 and still wrong).
   Therefore I must be in position 1 or 2.
3. Excluded letters so far: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, W, D, G.

Remaining common letters: B, C, F, H, K, L, M, P, V, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing I in position 1 or 2, and using only the allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
- I _ _ _ E
- _ I _ _ E

Let’s brainstorm:
- I _ _ _ E: “ICING” – but C, N, G are excluded; N, G already out. “IBLEE” – not valid.
- _ I _ _ E: “MICEY” – not valid. “BICEP” – not ending in E. “PILCH” – not ending in E. “CLIME” – C, L, M, E; I in position 3 – but I can’t be in 3. “CLIME” is invalid because I is in 3 and already ruled out.

Wait, let’s list valid words ending in E, containing I in 1 or 2, avoiding all excluded letters.

Valid candidates:
- “FIBER” – but B, F, E, R; R is excluded.
- “MICEY” – not valid.
- “PICKY” – not valid.
- “BLIME” – B, L, I, M, E – all allowed letters. I is in position 3 – but we know I cannot be in 3. So this is invalid.

Another approach: try I in position 1 or 2.

I _ _ _ E:
- I _ _ _ E: “ICING” – invalid (N, G excluded).
- “ICED” – too short.
- “ICEL” – not a word.

_ I _ _ E:
- “CIGIE” – not a word.
- “HIMIE” – not a word.
- “LIMEY” – L, I, M, E, Y – all allowed. I is in position 2 – this is acceptable.

“LIMEY”:
- L, I, M, E, Y – none of the excluded letters.
- Ends with E.
- Contains I in position 2 – which is allowed (we only know I is not in 3 or 4, so 2 is fine).

This seems like a valid next guess.

- I is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
- M is not in the word (x).  
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
- Y is not in the word (x).

Summary of what we now know:
1. Word ends with E (from Guess 1).
2. Contains I, L, and E somewhere, but none of them are in the positions they appeared in LIMEY:
   - I cannot be in position 2.
   - L cannot be in position 1.
   - E cannot be in position 4.
3. Excluded letters so far: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, W, D, G, M, Y.

Remaining common letters: B, C, F, H, K, P, V, Z.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing I, L, and E (but E is already fixed at position 5), and avoiding all excluded letters. Also, I must not be in position 2, L must not be in position 1, and E must not be in position 4 (but it’s already in position 5, so that’s fine).

Possible patterns:
- _ _ L _ E  (L in position 3)
- _ L _ _ E  (L in position 2) – but I cannot be in position 2, so this is possible if I is elsewhere.
- L _ _ _ E – but L cannot be in position 1.

Let’s try to place I and L in valid positions.

Option 1: L in position 3
Word: _ _ L _ E
We need I somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4 (but I cannot be in 2), so I could be in 1 or 4.
- I _ L _ E: “I” as first letter. Remaining letters must be from allowed set (B, C, F, H, K, P, V, Z). Possible: “ICL”… but we need 5 letters. “ICL” doesn’t fit.
- _ I L _ E: “_ I L _ E”. Need two more letters. Example: “H I L L E” – but double L is allowed? Not sure, but let’s check. “HILLE” is not a valid word.
- _ _ L I E: “_ _ L I E”. Need first two letters. Example: “P L I E” – but we need 5 letters. “P L I E” is only 4 letters.

Option 2: L in position 2
Word: _ L _ _ E
I must be in position 1 or 4 (cannot be in 2).
- I L _ _ E: “I L _ _ E”. Need two more letters. Example: “I L C E” – but we need 5 letters. “I L C E” is 4 letters. “I L C E” is not a word.
- _ L _ I E: “_ L _ I E”. Need first and third letters. Example: “B L A I E” – but A is excluded. “B L C I E” – not a word. “P L U I E” – U is excluded.

Option 3: L in position 4
Word: _ _ _ L E
I must be in position 1, 2, or 3 (cannot be in 2). So I could be in 1 or 3.
- I _ _ L E: “I _ _ L E”. Need two more letters. Example: “I B C L E” – not a word. “I C K L E” – “ICKLE” is a valid word. Let’s check:
   - I, C, K, L, E – none of the excluded letters.
   - I is in position 1 (allowed, since it was in position 2 in LIMEY and is now in 1).
   - L is in position 4 (allowed, since it was in position 1 in LIMEY and is now in 4).
   - E is in position 5 (correct, as known).
   - C, K are allowed.
   - No excluded letters.

“ICKLE” seems valid.

Let’s verify:
- I: position 1 (allowed)
- C: allowed
- K: allowed
- L: position 4 (allowed)
- E: position 5 (correct)

This fits all constraints.
