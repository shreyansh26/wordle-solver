1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and consonants that appear often. The word ""SLATE"" is a popular choice for this reason because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common letter)
- E (the most common vowel)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to test.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 (✓)
- L is in the word but wrong position (-)
- A is in the word but wrong position (-)
- T and E are not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. Word starts with S
2. Contains L and A somewhere after position 1
3. Does NOT contain T or E

Next guess should:
- Keep S in position 1
- Place L and A in new positions (not where they were)
- Introduce other common letters not yet tested

Good candidate letters to test next: R, I, N, C, H, etc.

Let’s try S + A + L + R + I: “SALIR” – but that’s not a valid English word.

A valid word that fits: S + A + L + R + I → “SALTY” – but T is excluded.

Next idea: S + A + L + R + N → “SALON” – valid English word.

Check positions:
- S stays in 1
- A moves from 3 to 2
- L moves from 2 to 3
- O and N are new letters

This tests new letters while repositioning known letters.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and consonants that appear often. The word ""SLATE"" is a popular choice for this reason because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common letter)
- E (the most common vowel)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to test.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and consonants that appear often. The word ""SLATE"" is a popular choice for this reason because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common letter)
- E (the most common vowel)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to test.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 (✓)
- L is in the word but wrong position (-)
- A is in the word but wrong position (-)
- T and E are not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. Word starts with S
2. Contains L and A somewhere after position 1
3. Does NOT contain T or E

Next guess should:
- Keep S in position 1
- Place L and A in new positions (not where they were)
- Introduce other common letters not yet tested

Good candidate letters to test next: R, I, N, C, H, etc.

Let’s try S + A + L + R + I: “SALIR” – but that’s not a valid English word.

A valid word that fits: S + A + L + R + I → “SALTY” – but T is excluded.

Next idea: S + A + L + R + N → “SALON” – valid English word.

Check positions:
- S stays in 1
- A moves from 3 to 2
- L moves from 2 to 3
- O and N are new letters

This tests new letters while repositioning known letters.

Guess 2: SALON -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(✓) L(✓) O(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on SALON:
- S(✓) – still correct in position 1
- A(✓) – now correct in position 2
- L(✓) – now correct in position 3
- O(x) – O is not in the word
- N(x) – N is not in the word

So the word so far is: S A L _ _

Letters we still need to test for positions 4 and 5:
- Must avoid T, E, O, N
- Must include any remaining letters we haven’t ruled out

Common remaining consonants: R, C, D, G, H, M, P, etc.
Common remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already used)

We need a valid 5-letter word starting with SAL. Possible endings:
- SALID – but D is okay, but I is already in position 4
- SALTY – but T is ruled out
- SALCH – not a word
- SALIG – not a word
- SALIM – not a word
- SALIP – not a word
- SALIR – not a word
- SALUG – not a word
- SALUD – not a word
- SALUM – not a word
- SALUM – not a word
- SALUM – not a word

Looking at actual English words starting with SAL:
- SALAD – but D is okay, but we haven’t tested D yet
- SALAD – D is new, but we already know A is in position 2
- SALAD – fits S A L A D, but we know A is already in position 2, so A in position 4 would be new
- SALAD – but we don’t know if A is repeated

Actually, the word could be SALAD, but we need to test D and see if A is repeated.

But let’s think of other words:
- SALTY – T ruled out
- SALAD – possible
- SALAD – let’s try SALAD

Check:
- S A L A D
- S(✓) A(✓) L(✓) A(?) D(?)
- We don’t know if A is repeated, but it’s a valid word

But we could also try SALID – but D is okay, but I is okay, but SALID is not a common word.

Another option: SALUM – not common
SALID – not common
SALAD – common

Let’s go with SALAD to test the last two letters.
