### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should have a mix of these letters to maximize information gain.

One excellent first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter in the right position or identifying several letters that are in the word but misplaced, helping narrow down the possibilities for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, S
- Letters definitely in the word (but not in their current positions): O, E
- Positions we can rule out for O and E:
  – O cannot be in position 3
  – E cannot be in position 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both O and E
2. Does NOT contain A, R, or S
3. Places O and E in positions other than their previous ones

Possible letters we can still use: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s try to place O and E in new positions. A good next guess should also introduce new common letters to maximize information. The word ""OCEAN"" has:
- O in position 1 (new for O)
- E in position 3 (new for E)
- C, N are new letters
- A is already ruled out, so this is invalid.

Next, ""COELE"" – but E is in position 5, which is invalid for E.

Let’s try ""EPOCH"":
- E in position 1 (new for E)
- O in position 2 (new for O)
- P, C, H are new letters
- Contains both E and O
- Does not contain A, R, or S
- Valid positions for E and O

This seems like a strong second guess.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters definitely in the word but in wrong positions: E, O

Positions we have ruled out:

- O cannot be in positions 3 or 4

1. Contains both E and O  
2. Does NOT contain any of A, R, S, P, C, H  
3. Places E somewhere other than 1 or 5 and O somewhere other than 3 or 4

A better choice is “MOTEK” – but K is also uncommon.  
“BLOKE” – contains B, L, K, E, O.  
Check positions:
- E is in position 4 (allowed)  
- O is in position 3 (forbidden) → reject.

Next: “MOTEY” → O in 1 (allowed), E in 5 (forbidden) → reject.

“LODEY” → O in 2 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), but D, Y are new.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should have a mix of these letters to maximize information gain.

One excellent first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter in the right position or identifying several letters that are in the word but misplaced, helping narrow down the possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, S
- Letters definitely in the word (but not in their current positions): O, E
- Positions we can rule out for O and E:
  – O cannot be in position 3
  – E cannot be in position 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both O and E
2. Does NOT contain A, R, or S
3. Places O and E in positions other than their previous ones

Possible letters we can still use: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s try to place O and E in new positions. A good next guess should also introduce new common letters to maximize information. The word ""OCEAN"" has:
- O in position 1 (new for O)
- E in position 3 (new for E)
- C, N are new letters
- A is already ruled out, so this is invalid.

Next, ""COELE"" – but E is in position 5, which is invalid for E.

Let’s try ""EPOCH"":
- E in position 1 (new for E)
- O in position 2 (new for O)
- P, C, H are new letters
- Contains both E and O
- Does not contain A, R, or S
- Valid positions for E and O

This seems like a strong second guess.

- E must be in position 4 (since 3 is ruled out by boeuf and 2 is taken by O, and 5 is ruled out by arose).
- Letters already eliminated: A, R, S, P, C, H, B, U, F.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2

- Only letters from the allowed set
- Introduce new common letters to maximize info

Candidate: “DONGE” – but G and E are allowed, but E must be in position 4, so “DONGE” has E in position 5, which is invalid.

Next: “GONIE” – but I is allowed, and E in position 5 is invalid.

Next: “LONGE” – E in 5 invalid.

Next: “MONGE” – same issue.

Next: “TONIE” – E in 5 invalid.

Next: “DOING” – O in 2, E in 4, but G and N are new. However, “DOING” has E in position 4 and O in position 2, which fits. Let me check:
- D, O, I, N, G – all allowed.
- O in 2 (✓)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should have a mix of these letters to maximize information gain.

One excellent first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter in the right position or identifying several letters that are in the word but misplaced, helping narrow down the possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, S
- Letters definitely in the word (but not in their current positions): O, E
- Positions we can rule out for O and E:
  – O cannot be in position 3
  – E cannot be in position 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both O and E
2. Does NOT contain A, R, or S
3. Places O and E in positions other than their previous ones

Possible letters we can still use: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s try to place O and E in new positions. A good next guess should also introduce new common letters to maximize information. The word ""OCEAN"" has:
- O in position 1 (new for O)
- E in position 3 (new for E)
- C, N are new letters
- A is already ruled out, so this is invalid.

Next, ""COELE"" – but E is in position 5, which is invalid for E.

Let’s try ""EPOCH"":
- E in position 1 (new for E)
- O in position 2 (new for O)
- P, C, H are new letters
- Contains both E and O
- Does not contain A, R, or S
- Valid positions for E and O

This seems like a strong second guess.

From the two guesses we have:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
   – A, R, S are not in the word.
   – O and E are in the word but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively.

2. epoch → E(-) P(x) O(-) C(x) H(x)
   – P, C, H are not in the word.
   – E is in the word but not in position 1.
   – O is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, P, C, H
- Letters definitely in the word: O, E
- Positions ruled out:
  – O cannot be in positions 2 or 3
  – E cannot be in positions 1 or 5

We still need to place O and E in the remaining valid spots and introduce new common letters to maximize information. Possible positions for O: 1, 4, 5  
Possible positions for E: 2, 3, 4

Let’s try a word that:
- Contains both O and E in allowed positions
- Uses new common letters (B, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, N, T, U, etc.)
- Avoids all ruled-out letters

A good candidate is ""BOEUF"":
- B, U, F are new letters
- O in position 2 (allowed)
- E in position 3 (allowed)
- No ruled-out letters appear

From all feedback so far:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
   – A, R, S are out.
   – O and E are in the word, but O not in position 3, E not in position 5.

2. epoch → E(-) P(x) O(-) C(x) H(x)
   – P, C, H are out.
   – O not in position 2, so O can only be 1, 4, or 5.
   – E not in position 1, so E can be 2, 3, or 4.

3. boeuf → B(x) O(✓) E(-) U(x) F(x)
   – B, U, F are out.
   – O is now confirmed in position 2.
   – E is in the word but not in position 3.

So we have:
- O fixed at position 2.
- E must be in position 4 (since 3 is ruled out by boeuf and 2 is taken by O, and 5 is ruled out by arose).
- Letters already eliminated: A, R, S, P, C, H, B, U, F.
- Remaining common letters to try: D, G, I, K, L, M, N, T, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2
- E in position 4
- Only letters from the allowed set
- Introduce new common letters to maximize info

Candidate: “DONGE” – but G and E are allowed, but E must be in position 4, so “DONGE” has E in position 5, which is invalid.

Next: “GONIE” – but I is allowed, and E in position 5 is invalid.

Next: “LONGE” – E in 5 invalid.

Next: “MONGE” – same issue.

Next: “TONIE” – E in 5 invalid.

Next: “DOING” – O in 2, E in 4, but G and N are new. However, “DOING” has E in position 4 and O in position 2, which fits. Let me check:
- D, O, I, N, G – all allowed.
- O in 2 (✓)
- E in 4 (✓)
- New letters: D, I, N, G.

This seems valid.
