From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: x → not in the word at all  
- L: x → not in the word at all  
- A: - → A is in the word but not in position 3  
- T: x → not in the word at all  
- E: x → not in the word at all  

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: S, L, T, E  
- Letter A is present but not in position 3.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains the letter A (but not in the 3rd position).  
2. Does NOT contain S, L, T, or E.  
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Common remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, P, M, B, G, H, etc.  
Common vowels: A (already confirmed), I, O, U.

A good next guess should test several new letters while satisfying the constraints.  
""CRANK"" is a good candidate:
- C, R, N, K are new letters to test.  
- A is included (and not in position 3, since it’s in position 2).  
- No S, L, T, E.

Another strong option is ""ROUND"":
- R, O, U, N, D – tests R, O, U, N, D.  
- No S, L, T, E.  
- A is not used here, but we still have information to gain.

I’ll go with ""CRANK"" because it tests C, R, N, K while confirming A’s position and avoiding the eliminated letters.

2. Place A in a new position (positions 2 or 5 are still open).  
3. Place R in a new position (positions 1, 3, 4, 5 are still open).  
4. Use fresh letters to test as many new consonants and vowels as possible.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should include several of these.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test positions and frequencies. Other strong options might be ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", ""AROSE"", etc., but ""SLATE"" is widely considered optimal for first guesses.

C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) K(x)  
→ Letters eliminated: C, N, K  
→ R is in the word but not in position 2.  
→ A is in the word but not in position 3 (confirmed again).

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, C, N, K  
- Letters definitely in the word: A, R  
- A cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from SLATE and CRANK).  
- R cannot be in position 2.

We still need to test other common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Include A and R (since we know they’re in the word).  
2. Place A in a new position (positions 2 or 5 are still open).  
3. Place R in a new position (positions 1, 3, 4, 5 are still open).  
4. Use fresh letters to test as many new consonants and vowels as possible.

Let’s try “DRAFT”:
- D, F, T: T is already eliminated, so skip.  
→ “DRAFT” is invalid because T is out.

Next candidate: “GRAVY” – but Y is less common and we don’t know about it yet.  
Better to stick with common letters.

Try “RADIO”:
- R, A, D, I, O  
→ R is in position 1 (new position), A is in position 2 (new position), D, I, O are fresh letters.

This tests:
- R in position 1 (allowed)  
- A in position 2 (allowed)  
- D, I, O (new letters)  
- No eliminated letters.

“RADIO” is a valid 5-letter word and satisfies all constraints.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should include several of these.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test positions and frequencies. Other strong options might be ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", ""AROSE"", etc., but ""SLATE"" is widely considered optimal for first guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: x → not in the word at all  
- L: x → not in the word at all  
- A: - → A is in the word but not in position 3  
- T: x → not in the word at all  
- E: x → not in the word at all  

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: S, L, T, E  
- Letter A is present but not in position 3.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains the letter A (but not in the 3rd position).  
2. Does NOT contain S, L, T, or E.  
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Common remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, P, M, B, G, H, etc.  
Common vowels: A (already confirmed), I, O, U.

A good next guess should test several new letters while satisfying the constraints.  
""CRANK"" is a good candidate:
- C, R, N, K are new letters to test.  
- A is included (and not in position 3, since it’s in position 2).  
- No S, L, T, E.

Another strong option is ""ROUND"":
- R, O, U, N, D – tests R, O, U, N, D.  
- No S, L, T, E.  
- A is not used here, but we still have information to gain.

I’ll go with ""CRANK"" because it tests C, R, N, K while confirming A’s position and avoiding the eliminated letters.

Current constraints:
- Position 2 is A.
- R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- Remaining positions (1, 3, 4, 5) must be filled with letters not yet eliminated.

Let’s try to place R in position 3 and fill the rest with fresh letters.

Candidate: “GRAFY” – but Y is less common and we haven’t tested it yet.
Candidate: “FARMS” – S is eliminated.
Candidate: “HARPY” – P and Y are untested, but Y is less common.
Candidate: “MARCH” – C and H are untested, but C is eliminated.
Candidate: “HARPY” seems best among these, but let’s pick a more common word.

Candidate: “HARRY” – R is repeated, but we don’t know if R is unique.
Candidate: “HARPY” is valid but uses Y.
Candidate: “HARMY” – M and Y are untested.

Let’s try “HARMY”:
- H, M, Y are new.
- A is in position 2.
- R is in position 4 (allowed).
- No eliminated letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should include several of these.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test positions and frequencies. Other strong options might be ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", ""AROSE"", etc., but ""SLATE"" is widely considered optimal for first guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: x → not in the word at all  
- L: x → not in the word at all  
- A: - → A is in the word but not in position 3  
- T: x → not in the word at all  
- E: x → not in the word at all  

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: S, L, T, E  
- Letter A is present but not in position 3.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains the letter A (but not in the 3rd position).  
2. Does NOT contain S, L, T, or E.  
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Common remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, P, M, B, G, H, etc.  
Common vowels: A (already confirmed), I, O, U.

A good next guess should test several new letters while satisfying the constraints.  
""CRANK"" is a good candidate:
- C, R, N, K are new letters to test.  
- A is included (and not in position 3, since it’s in position 2).  
- No S, L, T, E.

Another strong option is ""ROUND"":
- R, O, U, N, D – tests R, O, U, N, D.  
- No S, L, T, E.  
- A is not used here, but we still have information to gain.

I’ll go with ""CRANK"" because it tests C, R, N, K while confirming A’s position and avoiding the eliminated letters.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: CRANK -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) K(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 (SLATE):  
S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)  
→ Letters eliminated: S, L, T, E  
→ A is in the word but not in position 3.

Round 2 (CRANK):  
C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) K(x)  
→ Letters eliminated: C, N, K  
→ R is in the word but not in position 2.  
→ A is in the word but not in position 3 (confirmed again).

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, C, N, K  
- Letters definitely in the word: A, R  
- A cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from SLATE and CRANK).  
- R cannot be in position 2.

We still need to test other common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Include A and R (since we know they’re in the word).  
2. Place A in a new position (positions 2 or 5 are still open).  
3. Place R in a new position (positions 1, 3, 4, 5 are still open).  
4. Use fresh letters to test as many new consonants and vowels as possible.

Let’s try “DRAFT”:
- D, F, T: T is already eliminated, so skip.  
→ “DRAFT” is invalid because T is out.

Next candidate: “GRAVY” – but Y is less common and we don’t know about it yet.  
Better to stick with common letters.

Try “RADIO”:
- R, A, D, I, O  
→ R is in position 1 (new position), A is in position 2 (new position), D, I, O are fresh letters.

This tests:
- R in position 1 (allowed)  
- A in position 2 (allowed)  
- D, I, O (new letters)  
- No eliminated letters.

“RADIO” is a valid 5-letter word and satisfies all constraints.

We know:
- A is fixed in position 2.
- R must be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (since it cannot be in 1 or 2).
- We need to fill positions 1, 3, 4, 5 with letters not yet eliminated.

Good remaining consonants: B, F, G, H, M, P, U, V, W, Y  
Good remaining vowels: U (since A is already used).

Let’s try to place R in position 3 and pick fresh letters for the other spots.

Candidate: “BRAVO”
- B, V, O are new.

From the five rounds of feedback:

Eliminated letters: S, L, T, E, C, N, K, D, I, B, V, H, M, Y  
Confirmed letters in the word: A (must be in position 2), R (must be in position 3, 4, or 5)  
Letters still untested and common: F, G, P, U, W

Current constraints:
- Position 2 is A.
- R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- Remaining positions (1, 3, 4, 5) must be filled with letters from {F, G, P, U, W}.

Let’s list possible placements:

1. If R is in position 3: word pattern is _ A R _ _
   Possible letters for positions 1, 4, 5: F, G, P, U, W (no repeats)
   Example: F A R G U → “FARGU” (not a valid word)
   Example: P A R U F → “PARUF” (not a valid word)

2. If R is in position 4: word pattern is _ A _ R _
   Possible letters for positions 1, 3, 5: F, G, P, U, W
   Example: F A U R G → “FAURG” (not a valid word)
   Example: P A U R F → “PAURF” (not a valid word)

3. If R is in position 5: word pattern is _ A _ _ R
   Possible letters for positions 1, 3, 4: F, G, P, U, W
   Example: F A U G R → “FAUGR” (not a valid word)
   Example: P A U G R → “PAUGR” (not a valid word)

None of the combinations above form valid English words. This suggests we need to revisit our assumption that R must be in positions 3, 4, or 5. However, from the feedback:
- In BRAVO (positions 1-5): B(x) R(-) A(-) V(x) O(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- In HARMY (positions 1-5): H(x) A(✓) R(-) M(-) Y(-) → R is in the word but not in position 3.

Thus, R cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5. The only remaining position is 4. Therefore, the word must be _ A _ R _.

Now, we need to fill positions 1, 3, 5 with letters from the remaining untested set {F, G, P, U, W} without repeating letters.

Valid English word fitting _ A _ R _:
- F A U R G → “FAURG” (invalid)
- P A U R F → “PAURF” (invalid)
- G A U R F → “GAURF” (invalid)

Wait, let’s list all valid 5-letter words of the form _ A _ R _ using only F, G, P, U, W.

Valid words:
- P A U R F → “PAURF” (invalid)
- G A U R F → “GAURF” (invalid)
- F A U R G → “FAURG” (invalid)

None of these are valid. This indicates we may have missed a letter or misinterpreted the feedback. Let’s re-examine the feedback carefully.

From Guess 5 (HARMY):
H(x) A(✓) R(-) M(-) Y(-)  
- H is eliminated.  
- A is in position 2 (confirmed).  
- R is in the word but not in position 3.  
- M is in the word but not in position 4.  
- Y is in the word but not in position 5.

Wait! This means:
- R is in the word but not in position 3.  
- M is in the word but not in position 4.  
- Y is in the word but not in position 5.

So we have three confirmed letters: A (position 2), R, M, Y.  
Positions:
- 1: unknown (not eliminated)  
- 2: A  
- 3: unknown (not eliminated)  
- 4: unknown (not eliminated)  
- 5: unknown (not eliminated)

Letters still untested and allowed: F, G, P, U, W

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2.  
- Contains R, M, Y somewhere.  
- Uses only letters from {F, G, P, U, W} plus A, R, M, Y.

Possible word: “FARMY”  
Check:
- F, A, R, M, Y  
- A is in position 2.  
- R, M, Y are present.  
- No eliminated letters.  
- Valid word.

Thus, “FARMY” is the logical next guess.

Wait, let’s list all valid 5-letter words of the form _ A _ R _ using only F, G, P, U, W.

Valid words:
- P A U R F → “PAURF” (invalid)
- G A U R F → “GAURF” (invalid)
- F A U R G → “FAURG” (invalid)

None of these are valid. This indicates we may have missed a letter or misinterpreted the feedback. Let’s re-examine the feedback carefully.

From Guess 5 (HARMY):
H(x) A(✓) R(-) M(-) Y(-)  
- H is eliminated.  
- A is in position 2 (confirmed).  
- R is in the word but not in position 3.  
- M is in the word but not in position 4.  
- Y is in the word but not in position 5.

Wait! This means:
- R is in the word but not in position 3.  
- M is in the word but not in position 4.  
- Y is in the word but not in position 5.

So we have three confirmed letters: A (position 2), R, M, Y.  
Positions:
- 1: unknown (not eliminated)  
- 2: A  
- 3: unknown (not eliminated)  
- 4: unknown (not eliminated)  
- 5: unknown (not eliminated)

Letters still untested and allowed: F, G, P, U, W

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2.  
- Contains R, M, Y somewhere.  
- Uses only letters from {F, G, P, U, W} plus A, R, M, Y.

Possible word: “FARMY”  
Check:
- F, A, R, M, Y  
- A is in position 2.  
- R, M, Y are present.  
- No eliminated letters.  
- Valid word.

Thus, “FARMY” is the logical next guess.",Guess 6: FARMY -> FEEDBACK: F(x) A(✓) R(-) M(-) Y(-),FAIL
