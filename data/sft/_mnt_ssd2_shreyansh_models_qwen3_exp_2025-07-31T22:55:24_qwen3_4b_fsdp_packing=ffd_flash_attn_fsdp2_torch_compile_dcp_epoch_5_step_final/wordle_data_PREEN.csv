For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, providing useful information for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
1. The word does NOT contain S, L, A, T.
2. The word DOES contain E, but not in the 5th position.

Next, I want to test new common letters while avoiding the eliminated ones (S, L, A, T). Good remaining consonants include R, N, C, H, M, P, etc., and vowels include I, O, U. Since E is confirmed, I’ll place it in a different position and introduce other common letters.

A good candidate is “CHORE”:
- C, H, O, R are all new letters not yet tested.
- E is moved to the 4th position (avoiding the 5th).

Summary of what we know so far:

2. Confirmed letters: R, E (both present but in wrong positions)
3. R is not in position 4 (from CHORE feedback)

- Contains both R and E
- Does NOT contain any of the eliminated letters (S,L,A,T,C,H,O)
- Places R somewhere other than position 4
- Places E somewhere other than position 5

Remaining common letters include: N, I, U, D, M, P, G, B, F, K, Y, W, V, etc.

Let’s try to place R in position 2 and E in position 3, forming a pattern like _ R E _ _ or _ _ R E _ or _ _ _ R E (but E can’t be last).  
A word that fits is “DREWS” but W and S are still possible; however, S is eliminated.  
Another candidate is “BREED” but D is still possible and E would be in position 4 and 5, but E can’t be last.  
A better fit is “DRIER” – but I is still possible, R is in position 2 (allowed), E is in position 3 (allowed), and no eliminated letters.  
However, “DRIER” has R in position 2 and 4, but R can’t be in 4.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, providing useful information for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are all not in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
1. The word does NOT contain S, L, A, T.
2. The word DOES contain E, but not in the 5th position.

Next, I want to test new common letters while avoiding the eliminated ones (S, L, A, T). Good remaining consonants include R, N, C, H, M, P, etc., and vowels include I, O, U. Since E is confirmed, I’ll place it in a different position and introduce other common letters.

A good candidate is “CHORE”:
- C, H, O, R are all new letters not yet tested.
- E is moved to the 4th position (avoiding the 5th).

Summary of what we know so far:
1. Eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, C, H, O
2. Confirmed letters: R, E (both present but in wrong positions)
3. R is not in position 4 (from CHORE feedback)
4. E is not in position 5 (from SLATE feedback)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both R and E
- Does NOT contain any of the eliminated letters (S,L,A,T,C,H,O)
- Places R somewhere other than position 4
- Places E somewhere other than position 5

Remaining common letters include: N, I, U, D, M, P, G, B, F, K, Y, W, V, etc.

Let’s try to place R in position 2 and E in position 3, forming a pattern like _ R E _ _ or _ _ R E _ or _ _ _ R E (but E can’t be last).  
A word that fits is “DREWS” but W and S are still possible; however, S is eliminated.  
Another candidate is “BREED” but D is still possible and E would be in position 4 and 5, but E can’t be last.  
A better fit is “DRIER” – but I is still possible, R is in position 2 (allowed), E is in position 3 (allowed), and no eliminated letters.  
However, “DRIER” has R in position 2 and 4, but R can’t be in 4.  
Let’s try “DRIVE” – D, R, I, V, E.  
- R is in position 2 (allowed)  
- E is in position 5 (not allowed, from SLATE)  
So that fails.  

Next candidate: “FRIED” – F, R, I, E, D  
- R in 2 (allowed)  
- E in 4 (allowed)  
- No eliminated letters  
This seems valid.

Let’s go with “FRIED”.

From the latest feedback on PRUNE:

- P(✓) – P is correct in position 1.
- R(✓) – R is correct in position 2 (already known).
- U(x) – U is not in the word.
- N(-) – N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5 (already known).

Current confirmed pattern: P R _ _ _

Confirmed letters still in play: R (position 2), E (somewhere except 5), N (somewhere except 4).

Letters already eliminated: S, L, A, T, C, H, O, F, I, D, U.

Remaining possible letters for positions 3 and 5: B, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (but P is already used in position 1).

We need two letters for positions 3 and 5, one of which must be N (since N is in the word) and one of which must be E (since E is in the word), with the constraints:
- N cannot be in position 4 (already satisfied since position 4 is open).
- E cannot be in position 5 (already satisfied).

Possible combinations:
- Position 3: N, position 5: E → PRN_E (but we need a valid word).
- Position 3: E, position 5: N → PRE_N (but N cannot be in position 4, so position 5 is fine).

Looking at common words that fit P R E _ N: “PREON” is not a word. “PRENT” is not a word. “PREMN” is not a word. 

Looking at common words that fit P R N _ E: “PRUNE” was already guessed, and U is eliminated. “PRANE” is not a word. “PRINE” is not a word. 

Looking at common words that fit P R E _ _ with N in position 5: “PRENT” is not a word. “PREON” is not a word. 

Looking at other possibilities: Maybe N is in position 3 and E is in position 5, but E cannot be in position 5. 

Wait, let me re-examine the constraints:
- Pattern: P R _ _ _
- Must include N (not in position 4)
- Must include E (not in position 5)

So positions 3 and 5 must be N and E in some order, but E cannot be in position 5. Therefore, E must be in position 3 and N must be in position 5.

Thus, the word must be P R E _ N.

Looking for valid 5-letter words that fit P R E _ N:
- PREON – not a word.
- PRENT – not a word.
- PREMN – not a word.
- PREYN – not a word.
- PREZN – not a word.

Hmm, none of these seem to be valid. Let me think differently. Maybe N is in position 3 and E is in position 4, but E is already confirmed in position 4 from FRIED feedback. Wait, no, E is confirmed in position 4 from FRIED feedback (E(✓) in position 4). So position 4 is E.

Thus the pattern is P R _ E _.

We need position 3 and 5. N must be in the word but not in position 4 (already satisfied), and E is already in position 4. So position 3 and 5 must be filled with remaining letters, one of which is N.

So possible words:
- P R N E _ – but we need a letter for position 5, and N must be used. But N is already in position 3.
Wait, we have to use N somewhere, but E is already in position 4. So positions 3 and 5 must be filled with N and another letter, but N can be in position 3 or 5.

Looking for valid words:
- P R N E _ – but we need a letter for position 5. Maybe P R N E K? Not a word.
- P R E N _ – but position 5 can be N, but N cannot be in position 4 (already satisfied). So P R E N _ – but we need a letter for position 5. Maybe P R E N D? D is eliminated.
- P R E N T? T is eliminated.
- P R E N G? Not a word.
- P R E N B? Not a word.
- P R E N M? Not a word.

This seems tricky. Let me re-examine the constraints:
- Pattern: P R _ E _
- Must include N (not in position 4)
- Must include E (already in position 4)
- Letters available for positions 3 and 5: B, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (but P is already used in position 1)

So positions 3 and 5 must be N and one other letter, with N not in position 4 (already satisfied).

Possible combinations:
- Position 3: N, position 5: B → PRN E B – not a word.
- Position 3: N, position 5: G → PRN E G – not a word.
- Position 3: N, position 5: K → PRN E K – not a word.
- Position 3: N, position 5: M → PRN E M – not a word.
- Position 3: N, position 5: V → PRN E V – not a word.
- Position 3: N, position 5: W → PRN E W – not a word.
- Position 3: N, position 5: Y → PRN E Y – not a word.
- Position 3: B, position 5: N → PRB E N – not a word.
- Position 3: G, position 5: N → PRG E N – not a word.
- Position 3: J, position 5: N → PRJ E N – not a word.
- Position 3: K, position 5: N → PRK E N – not a word.
- Position 3: M, position 5: N → PRM E N – not a word.
- Position 3: Q, position 5: N → PRQ E N – not a word.
- Position 3: V, position 5: N → PRV E N – not a word.
- Position 3: W, position 5: N → PRW E N – not a word.
- Position 3: X, position 5: N → PRX E N – not a word.
- Position 3: Y, position 5: N → PRY E N – not a word.
- Position 3: Z, position 5: N → PRZ E N – not a word.

This seems impossible. Let me re-examine the constraints.

Wait, the feedback on PRUNE says:
- P(✓) – position 1 correct.
- R(✓) – position 2 correct.
- U(x) – U not in word.
- N(-) – N is in word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in word but not in position 5.

But from FRIED feedback we had:
- E(✓) – E is in position 4.

So position 4 is definitely E. Therefore the pattern is P R _ E _.

We need to place N somewhere in positions 3 or 5, because N must be in the word (from PRUNE feedback).

Thus the word must be P R N E _ or P R _ E N.

Looking for valid words:
- P R N E _ – but we need a letter for position 5. Maybe P R N E K? Not a word.
- P R _ E N – we need a letter for position 3. Possible letters: B, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (but P is already used in position 1).

Possible words:
- P R B E N – not a word.
- P R G E N – not a word.

Wait, the word must be P R _ E _ with N somewhere. The only possible valid word I can think of is ""PRUNE"" itself, but that was already guessed. 

Let me try a different approach. Maybe N is in position 3 and the word is P R N E _. But we need a letter for position 5. The only common letter left is M, making ""PRNEM"" which is not a word. 

Alternatively, maybe N is in position 5 and the word is P R _ E N. The only common letter for position 3 is B, making ""PRBEN"" which is not a word. 

This seems impossible. I must have made an error in interpreting the feedback. Let me re-examine the feedback carefully.

From PRUNE feedback:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, providing useful information for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are all not in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
1. The word does NOT contain S, L, A, T.
2. The word DOES contain E, but not in the 5th position.

Next, I want to test new common letters while avoiding the eliminated ones (S, L, A, T). Good remaining consonants include R, N, C, H, M, P, etc., and vowels include I, O, U. Since E is confirmed, I’ll place it in a different position and introduce other common letters.

A good candidate is “CHORE”:
- C, H, O, R are all new letters not yet tested.
- E is moved to the 4th position (avoiding the 5th).

Summary of what we know so far:
1. Eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, C, H, O
2. Confirmed letters: R, E (both present but in wrong positions)
3. R is not in position 4 (from CHORE feedback)
4. E is not in position 5 (from SLATE feedback)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both R and E
- Does NOT contain any of the eliminated letters (S,L,A,T,C,H,O)
- Places R somewhere other than position 4
- Places E somewhere other than position 5

Remaining common letters include: N, I, U, D, M, P, G, B, F, K, Y, W, V, etc.

Let’s try to place R in position 2 and E in position 3, forming a pattern like _ R E _ _ or _ _ R E _ or _ _ _ R E (but E can’t be last).  
A word that fits is “DREWS” but W and S are still possible; however, S is eliminated.  
Another candidate is “BREED” but D is still possible and E would be in position 4 and 5, but E can’t be last.  
A better fit is “DRIER” – but I is still possible, R is in position 2 (allowed), E is in position 3 (allowed), and no eliminated letters.  
However, “DRIER” has R in position 2 and 4, but R can’t be in 4.  
Let’s try “DRIVE” – D, R, I, V, E.  
- R is in position 2 (allowed)  
- E is in position 5 (not allowed, from SLATE)  
So that fails.  

Next candidate: “FRIED” – F, R, I, E, D  
- R in 2 (allowed)  
- E in 4 (allowed)  
- No eliminated letters  
This seems valid.

Let’s go with “FRIED”.

Guess 3: FRIED -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) I(x) E(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on FRIED:

- F(x) – F is not in the word.
- R(✓) – R is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2).
- I(x) – I is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word AND in the correct position (position 4).
- D(x) – D is not in the word.

So far we know:
1. The word has the pattern: _ R _ E _
2. Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, H, O, F, I, D
3. Letters still possible: B, G, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 5.  
Looking at common 5-letter words that fit _ R _ E _ and use only the remaining letters, a good candidate is “BRIBE” but B is allowed and we can repeat B. However, we need to check if B is allowed (it hasn’t been ruled out).  
Another option is “GRUBE” but U is allowed.  
A more common word is “BRIBE” but we might want to avoid repeating B.  
A better, more common word is “GRIBE” but G is allowed.  
Actually, “BRIBE” is valid, but let’s pick “GRIBE” instead.  
However, “GRIBE” isn’t a common word.  
A common word is “BRIBE” but we might want to check.  
Let me think of another.  
A valid word is “BRIBE” but let’s check: B, R, I, B, E – but I is already ruled out.  
Oops, that’s invalid.  
Next candidate: “PRUNE” – P, R, U, N, E.  
Check letters: P, R, U, N, E – none of these are eliminated.  
This fits perfectly: _ R _ E _ with R in 2 and E in 4.  
So “PRUNE” is a valid next guess.

From the latest feedback on PRUNE:

- P(✓) – P is in the word and in the correct position (1st letter).
- R(✓) – R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd letter).
- U(x) – U is not in the word.
- N(-) – N is in the word but in the wrong position.
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So far we know the word looks like:
P R _ _ _

Letters still possible (not yet ruled out): B, G, J, K, M, N, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (but S, L, A, T, C, H, O, F, I, D are already ruled out).

We need to place N and E somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5, while avoiding any already eliminated letters.

Looking at common English words that fit PR _ _ _:

- PRIME – I is eliminated.
- PRONE – O is eliminated.
- PRUNE – already tried.
- PRIST – S is eliminated.
- PRIZE – Z is allowed, but I is eliminated.
- PRONG – G is allowed, but O is eliminated.
- PRYED – D is eliminated.
- PRYED – E is already in the word but in wrong position.

Wait, we know E is in the word but in the wrong position (from SLATE and PRUNE feedback). Since E was in position 4 in PRUNE and marked (-), it must be in position 3 or 5.

Similarly, N is in the word but in the wrong position (from PRUNE feedback), so it must be in position 3, 4, or 5, but not position 4 (since PRUNE had N in position 4).

Possible patterns:
P R E _ _  (E in position 3)
P R _ E _  (E in position 4 – but PRUNE had E in position 5 marked (-), so this is invalid)
P R _ _ E  (E in position 5)

But PRUNE had E in position 5 marked (-), so E cannot be in position 5. Therefore E must be in position 3.

So the word looks like:
P R E _ _

We still need to place N somewhere. N is in the word but not in position 4 (from PRUNE), so it can be in position 3 or 5. But position 3 is already E, so N must be in position 5.

Thus the word must be:
P R E _ N

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit P R E _ N:

- PREON – not a valid English word.
- PRENT – not a valid English word.
- PREEN – valid word.

Check letters:
P, R, E, E, N – all letters are still possible (not eliminated).

Therefore the next guess should be PREEN.
