For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. 

Some good starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". These words contain common letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, C, N, etc. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain R, S, or E.
- Contains A (but not in position 1) and O (but not in position 3).

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no R, S, E).
2. Places A somewhere other than position 1.
3. Places O somewhere other than position 3.
4. Introduces new common letters to maximize information gain.

Good consonants still available: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.
Good vowels still available: A, O, I, U (since E is out).

A word like ""AUDIO"" would use A and O in new positions and introduce I and U, but it has O in position 2 (allowed) and A in position 2 (allowed). However, it's not very common.

A better choice is ""AUDIO"" but let me think of a more common word. ""TAINT"" has A in position 2 (allowed) and T, I, N. But it has A twice, which might not be optimal.

Another option is ""PLATO"" but it's not common. 

The word ""AUDIO"" seems reasonable, but let me think of something else. 

""OUTDO"" uses O in position 1 (allowed) and A in position 4 (allowed), introduces U and D. 

""OUTDO"" is a valid word and seems good.

But let me check: does it use any ruled-out letters? No R, S, E. Good.

Another option: ""AUDIO"" is similar.

I'll go with ""AUDIO"" as it uses A and O in new positions and introduces U and I.

But let me think of a more common word. ""AUDIO"" is okay.

Actually, ""AUDIO"" is a valid word and seems good.

But let me consider ""AUDIO"" vs ""OUTDO"". Both are good, but ""AUDIO"" has more vowels.

Good remaining vowels: A, O (already known), plus Y (sometimes a vowel).
Good remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, V, W, etc.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain R, S, or E.
- Contains A (but not in position 1) and O (but not in position 3).

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no R, S, E).
2. Places A somewhere other than position 1.
3. Places O somewhere other than position 3.
4. Introduces new common letters to maximize information gain.

Good consonants still available: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.
Good vowels still available: A, O, I, U (since E is out).

A word like ""AUDIO"" would use A and O in new positions and introduce I and U, but it has O in position 2 (allowed) and A in position 2 (allowed). However, it's not very common.

A better choice is ""AUDIO"" but let me think of a more common word. ""TAINT"" has A in position 2 (allowed) and T, I, N. But it has A twice, which might not be optimal.

Another option is ""PLATO"" but it's not common. 

The word ""AUDIO"" seems reasonable, but let me think of something else. 

""OUTDO"" uses O in position 1 (allowed) and A in position 4 (allowed), introduces U and D. 

""OUTDO"" is a valid word and seems good.

But let me check: does it use any ruled-out letters? No R, S, E. Good.

Another option: ""AUDIO"" is similar.

I'll go with ""AUDIO"" as it uses A and O in new positions and introduces U and I.

But let me think of a more common word. ""AUDIO"" is okay.

Actually, ""AUDIO"" is a valid word and seems good.

But let me consider ""AUDIO"" vs ""OUTDO"". Both are good, but ""AUDIO"" has more vowels.

I'll go with ""AUDIO"".

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.
   - R, S, E are not in the word.

2. AUDIO → A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(-)
   - A is still in the word but not in position 1 (confirmed).
   - O is still in the word but not in position 3 (confirmed).
   - U, D, I are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Forbidden letters: R, S, E, U, D, I
- Required letters: A (not position 1), O (not position 3)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and O.
- Does not contain R, S, E, U, D, I.
- A is not in position 1.
- O is not in position 3.

Available letters (excluding forbidden ones): A, B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to place A and O in positions other than 1 and 3 respectively. Let's look for common consonants and vowels.

Good remaining vowels: A, O (already known), plus Y (sometimes a vowel).
Good remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, V, W, etc.

Possible word structure:
- Position 1: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Position 2: any letter except forbidden
- Position 3: not O
- Position 4: any letter
- Position 5: any letter

Let's think of words that fit these constraints. A common word is ""NOBLE"":
- N, O, B, L, E → but E is forbidden.
Next: ""COBALT"" is 6 letters.
""POINT"" has I (forbidden).
""PLANT"" has I (forbidden).
""NOTAR"" has R (forbidden).
""NOBLE"" has E (forbidden).
""NOVAK"" has K, but K is allowed.
""NOVAK"" - check letters: N, O, V, A, K. All allowed. A is in position 4 (allowed), O is in position 2 (allowed). This seems good.

Another option: ""NOVAK"" or ""NOVAC"" (but C is allowed). Both fit.

I'll go with ""NOVAK"" as a strong candidate.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after three guesses.

Letters we have ruled out completely (never appear):
R, S, E, U, D, I, V, K

Letters we know are in the word:
- A (cannot be in positions 1 or 4)
- O (cannot be in positions 2 or 3)

So A must be in position 2, 3, or 5, and O must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

Remaining available letters (excluding the above):
B, C, F, G, H, J, L, M, N, P, Q, T, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and O
- Uses only the remaining letters
- Places A and O in allowed positions

Possible positions:
A: 2, 3, 5
O: 1, 4, 5

Let’s try to find a word that satisfies these constraints.

A simple approach is to try placing A in position 2 and O in position 1, then fill the rest with allowed consonants.

Word structure: O _ A _ _

Looking for real words that fit:
- O B A _ _ → “OBATE” (invalid), “OBAMA” (invalid), “OBATS” (invalid)
- O C A _ _ → “OCARI” (invalid)
- O L A _ _ → “OLASP” (invalid)
- O M A _ _ → “OMAHA” (valid)

OMAHA:
- Letters: O, M, A, H, A
- Contains A and O
- A is in position 3 (allowed)
- O is in position 1 (allowed)
- All letters are from the allowed set

This seems like a solid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. 

Some good starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". These words contain common letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, C, N, etc. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are present in the secret word.

- Does NOT contain R, S, or E.
- Contains A (but not in position 1) and O (but not in position 3).

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no R, S, E).
2. Places A somewhere other than position 1.

Let’s summarize everything we now know after four guesses.

Letters that are **never** in the word:
R, S, E, U, D, I, V, K, M, H

Letters that **are** in the word:
- A (cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5) → only position 2 is left for A.
- O (cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3) → positions 4 or 5 are left for O.

So the word must be of the form:
_ A _ _ O   or   _ A _ O _

Available letters (excluding the ruled-out set):
B, C, F, G, J, L, N, P, Q, T, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter English word that:
- Has A in position 2
- Has O in position 4 or 5
- Uses only the allowed letters

Let’s list possible patterns:

1. _ A _ _ O
2. _ A _ O _

Looking for common words that fit these patterns:

Pattern 1: _ A _ _ O
- B A _ _ O → “BAKED” (invalid), “BAKED” (E out), “BALDO” (invalid), “BALMY” (invalid), “BANJO” (invalid), “BANCO” (valid)
- C A _ _ O → “CANOE” (E out), “CABAL” (invalid)
- F A _ _ O → “FABIO” (valid)

- N A _ O _ → “NAKED” (E out), “NAKED” (E out)
- P A _ O _ → “PACED” (E out), “PACED” (E out)
- T A _ O _ → “TACET” (E out), “TACET” (E out)
- W A _ O _ → “WACKO” (invalid)

From the valid candidates:
- BALTO
- BAKED (invalid due to E)
- CABOT
- FABIO
- GABBO
- TABOO
- WACKO
- CABOT (C, A, B, O, T) – all letters allowed, positions fit.

CABOT is a valid 5-letter word and uses only allowed letters.

Let’s check CABOT:
- C A B O T
- A is in position 2 (correct)
- O is in position 4 (correct)
- C, B, T are all allowed letters.

Therefore, CABOT is the best next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. 

Some good starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". These words contain common letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, C, N, etc. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain R, S, or E.
- Contains A (but not in position 1) and O (but not in position 3).

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no R, S, E).
2. Places A somewhere other than position 1.
3. Places O somewhere other than position 3.
4. Introduces new common letters to maximize information gain.

Good consonants still available: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.
Good vowels still available: A, O, I, U (since E is out).

A word like ""AUDIO"" would use A and O in new positions and introduce I and U, but it has O in position 2 (allowed) and A in position 2 (allowed). However, it's not very common.

A better choice is ""AUDIO"" but let me think of a more common word. ""TAINT"" has A in position 2 (allowed) and T, I, N. But it has A twice, which might not be optimal.

Another option is ""PLATO"" but it's not common. 

The word ""AUDIO"" seems reasonable, but let me think of something else. 

""OUTDO"" uses O in position 1 (allowed) and A in position 4 (allowed), introduces U and D. 

""OUTDO"" is a valid word and seems good.

But let me check: does it use any ruled-out letters? No R, S, E. Good.

Another option: ""AUDIO"" is similar.

I'll go with ""AUDIO"" as it uses A and O in new positions and introduces U and I.

But let me think of a more common word. ""AUDIO"" is okay.

Actually, ""AUDIO"" is a valid word and seems good.

But let me consider ""AUDIO"" vs ""OUTDO"". Both are good, but ""AUDIO"" has more vowels.

I'll go with ""AUDIO"".

Guess 2: AUDIO -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.
   - R, S, E are not in the word.

2. AUDIO → A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(-)
   - A is still in the word but not in position 1 (confirmed).
   - O is still in the word but not in position 3 (confirmed).
   - U, D, I are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Forbidden letters: R, S, E, U, D, I
- Required letters: A (not position 1), O (not position 3)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and O.
- Does not contain R, S, E, U, D, I.
- A is not in position 1.
- O is not in position 3.

Available letters (excluding forbidden ones): A, B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to place A and O in positions other than 1 and 3 respectively. Let's look for common consonants and vowels.

Good remaining vowels: A, O (already known), plus Y (sometimes a vowel).
Good remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, V, W, etc.

Possible word structure:
- Position 1: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Position 2: any letter except forbidden
- Position 3: not O
- Position 4: any letter
- Position 5: any letter

Let's think of words that fit these constraints. A common word is ""NOBLE"":
- N, O, B, L, E → but E is forbidden.
Next: ""COBALT"" is 6 letters.
""POINT"" has I (forbidden).
""PLANT"" has I (forbidden).
""NOTAR"" has R (forbidden).
""NOBLE"" has E (forbidden).
""NOVAK"" has K, but K is allowed.
""NOVAK"" - check letters: N, O, V, A, K. All allowed. A is in position 4 (allowed), O is in position 2 (allowed). This seems good.

Another option: ""NOVAK"" or ""NOVAC"" (but C is allowed). Both fit.

I'll go with ""NOVAK"" as a strong candidate.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after three guesses.

Letters we have ruled out completely (never appear):
R, S, E, U, D, I, V, K

Letters we know are in the word:
- A (cannot be in positions 1 or 4)
- O (cannot be in positions 2 or 3)

So A must be in position 2, 3, or 5, and O must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

Remaining available letters (excluding the above):
B, C, F, G, H, J, L, M, N, P, Q, T, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and O
- Uses only the remaining letters
- Places A and O in allowed positions

Possible positions:
A: 2, 3, 5
O: 1, 4, 5

Let’s try to find a word that satisfies these constraints.

A simple approach is to try placing A in position 2 and O in position 1, then fill the rest with allowed consonants.

Word structure: O _ A _ _

Looking for real words that fit:
- O B A _ _ → “OBATE” (invalid), “OBAMA” (invalid), “OBATS” (invalid)
- O C A _ _ → “OCARI” (invalid)
- O L A _ _ → “OLASP” (invalid)
- O M A _ _ → “OMAHA” (valid)

OMAHA:
- Letters: O, M, A, H, A
- Contains A and O
- A is in position 3 (allowed)
- O is in position 1 (allowed)
- All letters are from the allowed set

This seems like a solid next guess.

Letters that are **never** in the word:
R, S, E, U, D, I, V, K, M, H

Letters that **are** in the word:
- A (cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5) → only position 2 is left for A.
- O (cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3) → positions 4 or 5 are left for O.

So the word must be of the form:
_ A _ _ O   or   _ A _ O _

Available letters (excluding the ruled-out set):
B, C, F, G, J, L, N, P, Q, T, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter English word that:
- Has A in position 2
- Has O in position 4 or 5
- Uses only the allowed letters

Let’s list possible patterns:

1. _ A _ _ O
2. _ A _ O _

Looking for common words that fit these patterns:

Pattern 1: _ A _ _ O
- B A _ _ O → “BAKED” (invalid), “BAKED” (E out), “BALDO” (invalid), “BALMY” (invalid), “BANJO” (invalid), “BANCO” (valid)
- C A _ _ O → “CANOE” (E out), “CABAL” (invalid)
- F A _ _ O → “FABIO” (valid)
- G A _ _ O → “GABBO” (valid)
- J A _ _ O → “JABOO” (invalid)
- L A _ _ O → “LABOR” (R out), “LACRO” (invalid)
- N A _ _ O → “NAKED” (E out), “NAKED” (E out), “NACRO” (invalid)
- P A _ _ O → “PACED” (E out), “PACED” (E out), “PAKED” (invalid)
- T A _ _ O → “TACET” (E out), “TACET” (E out), “TABOO” (valid)
- W A _ _ O → “WACKO” (valid)
- Y A _ _ O → “YACON” (invalid), “YACON” (invalid)

Pattern 2: _ A _ O _
- B A _ O _ → “BAKED” (E out), “BAKED” (E out), “BALTO” (valid)
- C A _ O _ → “CABOT” (valid)
- F A _ O _ → “FACET” (E out), “FACET” (E out)
- G A _ O _ → “GABOT” (invalid)
- L A _ O _ → “LABOR” (R out), “LABOR” (R out)
- N A _ O _ → “NAKED” (E out), “NAKED” (E out)
- P A _ O _ → “PACED” (E out), “PACED” (E out)
- T A _ O _ → “TACET” (E out), “TACET” (E out)
- W A _ O _ → “WACKO” (invalid)

From the valid candidates:
- BALTO
- BAKED (invalid due to E)
- CABOT
- FABIO
- GABBO
- TABOO
- WACKO
- CABOT (C, A, B, O, T) – all letters allowed, positions fit.

CABOT is a valid 5-letter word and uses only allowed letters.

Let’s check CABOT:
- C A B O T
- A is in position 2 (correct)
- O is in position 4 (correct)
- C, B, T are all allowed letters.

Therefore, CABOT is the best next guess.

These words contain common letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, C, N, etc. \n\nI\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S).

C(x) → C is NOT in the word

B(x) → B is NOT in the word  
O(✓) → O is in the word AND in position 4

_ A _ O _
