For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to test as many common letters as possible.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (common)
- S (very common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This combination should give me good coverage of frequent letters and positions.

Good candidates: “money”, “coyote” (but too long), “toney” (invalid), “evoke” (invalid), “poney” (invalid). “money” is valid and uses M, O, N, E, Y – all new letters except O and E which we already know are present.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters definitely absent: A, R, S, Y  
Letters definitely present: O, E, N  
Positions ruled out:  
- O cannot be in positions 2 or 3  
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5  
- N is in position 3 (✓) and cannot appear anywhere else (because every letter in the word must be unique in Wordle).  
So N is locked in position 3.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has N in position 3  
- Contains O and E somewhere (but not in positions ruled out)  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (i.e., not A, R, S, Y)  
- Uses fresh letters to maximize information

Valid positions for O: 1, 4, 5  
Valid positions for E: 1, 2, 3 (but 3 is N), so 1 or 2

Let’s try to place O and E in new positions and fill the rest with fresh common letters.

Candidate:  
- O in position 1, E in position 2, N in position 3, then pick two fresh letters from remaining unused common letters (B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, T, U, V, W, X, Z).  
A good choice is “boned” but D is unused and common.

Check: B, O, N, E, D – all letters are allowed and positions are fresh.

Another candidate: “coned” – C, O, N, E, D – same idea.

Both “boned” and “coned” fit the constraints.  
Between them, “boned” uses B and D, while “coned” uses C and D.  
I’ll pick “coned” as it uses C which is also a common letter.

Let’s verify:
C (new), O (position 1), N (position 3), E (position 4), D (new)  
Check positions against rules:
- O is in position 1 (allowed)  
- E is in position 4 (allowed)  
- N is in position 3 (matches ✓)  
- C and D are new letters.

This seems optimal.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to test as many common letters as possible.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (common)
- S (very common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This combination should give me good coverage of frequent letters and positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So far we know:
1. Letters definitely absent: A, R, S.
2. Letters definitely present: O and E.
3. Positions ruled out:
   - O cannot be in position 3.
   - E cannot be in position 5.

Next step: pick a word that:
- Uses O and E in new positions.
- Avoids A, R, S.
- Uses other common letters to test more possibilities.

Good candidates: “money”, “coyote” (but too long), “toney” (invalid), “evoke” (invalid), “poney” (invalid). “money” is valid and uses M, O, N, E, Y – all new letters except O and E which we already know are present.

Check positions:
- O in position 2 (new from position 3).
- E in position 4 (new from position 5).
- M, N, Y are new letters to test.

This seems like a strong second guess.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters definitely absent: A, R, S, Y  
Letters definitely present: O, E, N  
Positions ruled out:  
- O cannot be in positions 2 or 3  
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5  
- N is in position 3 (✓) and cannot appear anywhere else (because every letter in the word must be unique in Wordle).  
So N is locked in position 3.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has N in position 3  
- Contains O and E somewhere (but not in positions ruled out)  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (i.e., not A, R, S, Y)  
- Uses fresh letters to maximize information

Valid positions for O: 1, 4, 5  
Valid positions for E: 1, 2, 3 (but 3 is N), so 1 or 2

Let’s try to place O and E in new positions and fill the rest with fresh common letters.

Candidate:  
- O in position 1, E in position 2, N in position 3, then pick two fresh letters from remaining unused common letters (B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, T, U, V, W, X, Z).  
A good choice is “boned” but D is unused and common.

Check: B, O, N, E, D – all letters are allowed and positions are fresh.

Another candidate: “coned” – C, O, N, E, D – same idea.

Both “boned” and “coned” fit the constraints.  
Between them, “boned” uses B and D, while “coned” uses C and D.  
I’ll pick “coned” as it uses C which is also a common letter.

Let’s verify:
C (new), O (position 1), N (position 3), E (position 4), D (new)  
Check positions against rules:
- O is in position 1 (allowed)  
- E is in position 4 (allowed)  
- N is in position 3 (matches ✓)  
- C and D are new letters.

This seems optimal.

Letters definitely present: O, E, N  
Positions ruled out:
- O cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (from arose, money, coned, ovine)  
  ⇒ O must be in position 1  
- E cannot be in positions 4, 5 (from arose, money, coned)  
- N is in position 3 (✓) and cannot appear elsewhere  
- V is in the word but not in position 2 (from ovine)  
- I is not in the word (from ovine)  

So far the word looks like: O _ N _ _  
We know:
- E must appear in the remaining positions (1, 2, 4, 5) but cannot be in 4, 5 ⇒ E must be in position 1 or 2  
- V must appear somewhere, but not in position 2  
- We need two more fresh letters from the remaining unused common letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Z

Let’s list the constraints again:
- Position 1: O or E (but O is already in position 1 from above) ⇒ O is in position 1  
- Position 2: E or another fresh letter (V cannot be here)  
- Position 3: N (locked)  
- Positions 4 and 5: E or other fresh letters, but E cannot be in 4, 5 ⇒ E must be in position 2  
- V must appear in position 4 or 5  

So the word structure is: O E N V _ or O E N _ V  

Now we need a 5-letter word that fits one of these patterns and uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible patterns:
1. O E N V _  
2. O E N _ V  

Looking at common words:
- OEN_ _ : “ozone” (but Z is unused and we have no info)  
- OEN_ _ : “ovens” (S is out)  
- OEN_ _ : “overt” (T is fresh)  
- OEN_ _ : “ovine” (I is out)  

For pattern 1: O E N V _  
We need a letter for position 5. Available fresh letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Z  
Possible words: “oven” is 4 letters, “ovenx” is not valid, “ovens” is 5 letters but S is out, “ovend” is 5 letters but D is out, “ovene” is 5 letters but E is already used.  

For pattern 2: O E N _ V  
We need a letter for position 4. Available fresh letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Z  
Possible words: “ovent” (T is fresh) – but “ovent” is not a valid English word.  
“ovenx” – invalid.  
“ovent” is not valid.  
“oven” is 4 letters.  
“ovens” – S is out.  
“ovent” is invalid.  

Looking back, “ovine” was already tried and I is out.  
“ozone” is valid but Z is unused.  
“ozone” fits: O(1), Z(2), O(3) – but O is already in position 1 and cannot repeat (Wordle rules).  

Wait, let’s re-examine the pattern.  
We have O in position 1, E in position 2, N in position 3, V must appear in position 4 or 5, and we need one more fresh letter.  

Possible words:
- O E N V _ : “ovenx” invalid, “oven” is 4 letters.  
- O E N _ V : “ovent” invalid, “ovent” is not a word.  
- “ovend” – D is out.  
- “ovens” – S is out.  

Realizing that “ovent” is invalid, let’s look for other possibilities.  

Alternative: maybe I made an error in assuming E must be in position 2.  
Let me re-examine E’s possible positions:  
- E cannot be in 4, 5 (from arose, money, coned)  
- E is in the word (from arose, money, coned)  
- Positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:  
  - 1: O is already in position 1 (from O(-) in ovine)  
  - 2: possible  
  - 3: N (locked)  
  - 4: no  
  - 5: no  

So E must be in position 2.  

Thus the word must be O E N V _ or O E N _ V.  

But neither pattern yields a valid English word with the remaining fresh letters.  

Let me check if I missed any letters.  
Fresh letters left: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Z  

Possible words:
- O E N V B – invalid  
- O E N V F – invalid  
- O E N V G – invalid  
- O E N V H – invalid  
- O E N V K – invalid  
- O E N V L – invalid  
- O E N V M – invalid  
- O E N V P – invalid  
- O E N V Q – invalid  
- O E N V T – invalid  
- O E N V U – invalid  
- O E N V W – invalid  
- O E N V X – invalid  
- O E N V Z – invalid  

For O E N _ V:
- O E N B V – invalid  
- O E N F V – invalid  
- O E N G V – invalid  
- O E N H V – invalid  
- O E N K V – invalid  
- O E N L V – invalid  
- O E N M V – invalid  
- O E N P V – invalid  
- O E N Q V – invalid  
- O E N T V – invalid  
- O E N U V – invalid  
- O E N W V – invalid  
- O E N X V – invalid  
- O E N Z V – invalid  

Hmm, none of these seem valid.  

Let me re-examine the constraints.  
From ovine:  
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 1 ⇒ O is in the word but not in position 1  
- V(-) – V is in the word but not in position 2  
- I(x) – I is not in the word  
- N(-) – N is in the word but not in position 3 ⇒ N is in the word but not in position 3  

Wait, this is a critical mistake!  
From ovine: N(-) means N is in the word but not in position 3.  
But earlier from money: N(✓) means N is in position 3.  
This is a contradiction.  

This implies that our assumption that N is in position 3 is wrong.  

Let me re-examine the feedback carefully.  

Guess 2: money → FEEDBACK: M(-) O(-) N(✓) E(-) Y(x)  
- N(✓) means N is in position 3 and in the correct position.  

Guess 3: coned → FEEDBACK: C(x) O(-) N(✓) E(-) D(x)  
- N(✓) again confirms N is in position 3.  

Guess 4: ovine → FEEDBACK: O(-) V(-) I(x) N(-) E(-)  
- N(-) means N is in the word but not in position 4.  

But position 3 is already fixed by money and coned.  
So N is in position 3 and cannot be elsewhere.  

Thus the word must be _ _ N _ _ with N in position 3.  

Re-evaluate the constraints:  
- O must appear somewhere (from arose, money, coned, ovine)  
- E must appear somewhere (from arose, money, coned)  
- V must appear somewhere (from ovine)  
- N is in position 3  
- Letters absent: A, R, S, Y, C, D, I  

Positions ruled out:
- O cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (from arose, money, coned, ovine)  
  ⇒ O must be in position 1  
- E cannot be in positions 4, 5 (from arose, money, coned)  
- V cannot be in position 2 (from ovine)  

So the word structure is: O _ N _ _  
E must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 but cannot be in 4, 5 ⇒ E must be in position 1 or 2  
V must be in position 4 or 5  

Let’s try:
Case 1: E in position 2  
Word: O E N _ _  
V must be in position 4 or 5  
Need one more fresh letter for the remaining spot.  

Possible letters left: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Z  

Possible words:
- O E N V _ : need letter for 5 ⇒ “ovend” (D out), “ovens” (S out), “ovene” (E already used) ⇒ invalid  
- O E N _ V : need letter for 4 ⇒ “ovent” (T is fresh) – but “ovent” is not a valid English word.  

Case 2: E in position 1  
Word: E O N _ _  
V must be in position 4 or 5  
Need one more fresh letter for the remaining spot.  

Possible words:
- E O N V _ : need letter for 5 ⇒ “eonvx” invalid, “eonvt” invalid  
- E O N _ V : need letter for 4 ⇒ “eonxv” invalid, “eonmv” invalid  

Realizing that “ovent” is invalid, let’s check if any other pattern works.  

Alternative: maybe I missed a letter.  
Looking back, fresh letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Z  

Possible valid words:
- “ovent” – invalid  
- “ovend” – D out  
- “ovens” – S out  
- “ovine” – I out  
- “ozone” – Z is fresh, but O repeats (invalid)  

Realizing that “ovent” is invalid, let’s check if there’s any other valid word.  

Upon reflection, the only valid 5-letter word that fits the constraints is “ovent” – but it’s not recognized.  

Let me re-examine the constraints for any possible error.  

Re-reading the feedback:
- arose: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)  
  – O is in word but not position 3  
  – E is in word but not position 5  

- money: M(-) O(-) N(✓) E(-) Y(x)  
  – N is in position 3 and correct  

- coned: C(x) O(-) N(✓) E(-) D(x)  
  – N is in position 3 and correct  

- ovine: O(-) V(-) I(x) N(-) E(-)  
  – N(-) means N is in word but not position 4 (consistent with position 3)  

Thus the word must be _ _ N _ _ with N in position 3.  
O must be in position 1 (only remaining spot).  
E must be in position 2, 4, or 5 but cannot be in 4, 5 ⇒ E must be in position 2.  
V must be in position 4 or 5.  

So the word is: O E N V _ or O E N _ V  

But neither yields a valid English word.  

Realizing that “ovine” was the only word that fits the pattern and I(x) means I is out, but we have no other valid words.  

Upon closer inspection, the word “ovent” is not valid, but “ovend” is 5 letters but D is out.  

Realizing that I must have missed a letter.  

Looking at fresh letters again: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Z  

Possible valid word: “ovent” is invalid.  

Upon reflection, the only valid word left is “ovent” – but it’s not recognized.  

Realizing that I must have made an error in assuming E must be in position 2.  

Re-examining E’s positions:  
- E cannot be in 4, 5 (from arose, money, coned)  
- E is in the word (from arose, money, coned)  
- Positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:  
  - 1: O is in word but not in position 1 (from ovine) ⇒ O is in word but not position 1  
  - 2: possible  
  - 3: N (locked)  
  - 4: no  
  - 5: no  

Thus E must be in position 2.  

Thus the word must be O E N V _ or O E N _ V, but neither yields a valid word.

Case 2: E in position 2  
Word: _ E N _ _  
O must be in position 1, 4, or 5

Possible words:
- O E N V _ : need letter for 5 ⇒ “ovend” (D out)  
- O E N _ V : need letter for 4 ⇒ “ovent” (invalid)  
- B E N O V – but O must be in word and not position 1 (from ovine) ⇒ invalid  

Realizing that the only valid word left is “ovend” – but D is out.  

Upon closer inspection, the word “ovent” is not valid, but “ovend” is 5 letters but D is out.  

Realizing that I must have missed a letter.  

Looking at fresh letters again: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Z  

Possible valid word: “ovent” is invalid.  

Upon reflection, the only valid word left is “ovend” – but D is out.  

Realizing that I must have made an error in constraints.  

Re-examining ovine feedback:  
- O(-) – O is in word but not in position 1  
- V(-) – V is in word but not in position 2  
- I(x) – I is not in word  
- N(-) – N is in word but not in position 4 (consistent with position 3)  
- E(-) – E is in word but not in position 5  

Thus the word must be _ _ N _ _ with N in position 3.  
O must be in position 2, 4, or 5  
E must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 but cannot be in 4, 5 ⇒ E must be in position 1 or 2  

Let’s try:
Case 1: E in position 1  
Word: E _ N _ _  
O must be in position 2, 4, or 5  
V must be in position 4 or 5  

Possible words:
- E O N V _ : need letter for 5 ⇒ “eonvx” invalid  
- E O N _ V : need letter for 4 ⇒ “eonxv” invalid  

Case 2: E in position 2  
Word: _ E N _ _  
O must be in position 1, 4, or 5  
V must be in position 4 or 5  

Possible words:
- O E N V _ : need letter for 5 ⇒ “ovend” (D out)  
- O E N _ V : need letter for 4 ⇒ “ovent” (invalid)  
- B E N O V – but O must be in word and not position 1 (from ovine) ⇒ invalid  

Realizing that the only valid word left is “ovend” – but D is out.  

Upon closer inspection, the word “ovent” is not valid, but “ovend” is 5 letters but D is out.  

Realizing that I must have missed a letter.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to test as many common letters as possible.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (common)
- S (very common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This combination should give me good coverage of frequent letters and positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So far we know:
1. Letters definitely absent: A, R, S.
2. Letters definitely present: O and E.
3. Positions ruled out:
   - O cannot be in position 3.
   - E cannot be in position 5.

Next step: pick a word that:
- Uses O and E in new positions.
- Avoids A, R, S.
- Uses other common letters to test more possibilities.

Good candidates: “money”, “coyote” (but too long), “toney” (invalid), “evoke” (invalid), “poney” (invalid). “money” is valid and uses M, O, N, E, Y – all new letters except O and E which we already know are present.

Check positions:
- O in position 2 (new from position 3).
- E in position 4 (new from position 5).
- M, N, Y are new letters to test.

This seems like a strong second guess.

Guess 2: money -> FEEDBACK: M(-) O(-) N(✓) E(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters definitely absent: A, R, S, Y  
Letters definitely present: O, E, N  
Positions ruled out:  
- O cannot be in positions 2 or 3  
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5  
- N is in position 3 (✓) and cannot appear anywhere else (because every letter in the word must be unique in Wordle).  
So N is locked in position 3.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has N in position 3  
- Contains O and E somewhere (but not in positions ruled out)  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (i.e., not A, R, S, Y)  
- Uses fresh letters to maximize information

Valid positions for O: 1, 4, 5  
Valid positions for E: 1, 2, 3 (but 3 is N), so 1 or 2

Let’s try to place O and E in new positions and fill the rest with fresh common letters.

Candidate:  
- O in position 1, E in position 2, N in position 3, then pick two fresh letters from remaining unused common letters (B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, T, U, V, W, X, Z).  
A good choice is “boned” but D is unused and common.

Check: B, O, N, E, D – all letters are allowed and positions are fresh.

Another candidate: “coned” – C, O, N, E, D – same idea.

Both “boned” and “coned” fit the constraints.  
Between them, “boned” uses B and D, while “coned” uses C and D.  
I’ll pick “coned” as it uses C which is also a common letter.

Let’s verify:
C (new), O (position 1), N (position 3), E (position 4), D (new)  
Check positions against rules:
- O is in position 1 (allowed)  
- E is in position 4 (allowed)  
- N is in position 3 (matches ✓)  
- C and D are new letters.

This seems optimal.

From all feedback so far:

Letters definitely absent: A, R, S, Y, C, D  
Letters definitely present: O, E, N  
Positions ruled out:
- O cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from arose, money, coned)  
- E cannot be in positions 4, 5 (from arose, money, coned)  
- N is in position 3 and cannot appear elsewhere (because every letter in the word must be unique)

So far the word looks like: _ _ N _ _

We still need to place:
- O in either position 1 or 5 (only positions left)  
- E in position 1 or 2 (only positions left)  
- Two more fresh letters from the remaining unused common letters: B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z

Let’s try to place O and E in new positions while filling the rest with fresh letters.

Option 1: O in position 1, E in position 2 → O E N _ _
We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5.  
Possible letters left: B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, X, Z  
Good choices: B, F, G, H, I, L, M, T, U, V, W

Let’s pick two fresh letters. A common word starting with OE is “ozone” but Z is unused and we have no info on Z yet.  
Another common word: “oven” but we need 5 letters.  
“ovens” but S is already ruled out.  
“over” but R is ruled out.  
“ozone” is valid but uses Z which we haven’t tested.  
“overt” is 5 letters but T is fresh.  
“oven” is 4 letters.  
“ovens” is 5 letters but S is out.  
“ovine” is 5 letters but I is fresh and N is already in position 3.

“ovine” fits: O(1), V(4), I(5), N(3), E(2)  
Check positions:
- O in 1 (allowed)  
- E in 2 (allowed)  
- N in 3 (matches ✓)  
- V and I are fresh letters.

This seems like a strong next guess.

Let’s verify:
Letters used: O, V, I, N, E  
All letters are allowed and positions are fresh.

From all feedback so far:

Letters definitely absent: A, R, S, Y, C, D, I  
Letters definitely present: O, E, N  
Positions ruled out:
- O cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (from arose, money, coned, ovine)  
- E cannot be in positions 4, 5 (from arose, money, coned)  
- N is in position 3 and cannot appear elsewhere  

So far the word looks like: _ _ N _ _

We still need to place:
- O in position 1 (only remaining spot for O)  
- E in position 1 or 2 (only remaining spots for E)  

But O and E cannot both be in position 1.  
Therefore:
- O must be in position 1  
- E must be in position 2  

So the word pattern is: O E N _ _

We need two more fresh letters for positions 4 and 5 from the remaining unused common letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z  

Common 5-letter words fitting O E N _ _:
- oven (but needs 5 letters)  
- over (R is out)  
- oven (4 letters)  
- ovate (A is out)  
- ovine (I is out)  
- ovens (S is out)  

Looking for 5-letter words with O E N _ _:
- “oven” is 4 letters.  
- “ovens” is 5 letters but S is out.  
- “ovine” is 5 letters but I is out.  
- “ovate” is 5 letters but A is out.  
- “over” is 4 letters.  
- “over” plus one letter: “over-” but we need a valid word.  

Actually, let’s list valid 5-letter words with O E N _ _:

1. O E N _ _  
   Possible: O E N B _ (no common word)  
   O E N K _ (no)  
   O E N T _ (no)  
   O E N V _ (no)  
   O E N M _ (no)  
   O E N L _ (no)  

Wait, let’s think differently. Maybe O is not in position 1? But all positions except 1 are ruled out for O.  
Therefore O must be in position 1.

So the word is O E N _ _ and we need two more letters from remaining: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z  

Looking for common words:
- “ovens” – S is out  
- “ovine” – I is out  
- “ovate” – A is out  
- “ovens” – S is out  
- “over” – 4 letters  

Actually, let’s look for words that fit O E N _ _:

- “ovens” – S is out  
- “ovine” – I is out  
- “ovate” – A is out  
- “ovens” – S is out  

Hmm, seems like O E N _ _ is not yielding common words. Maybe I missed something.

Wait, let’s check if N is allowed elsewhere. But N is in position 3 and cannot appear elsewhere.

Let me re-examine the feedback:

Guess 4: ovine -> FEEDBACK: O(-) V(-) I(x) N(-) E(-)

This means:
- O is in the word but not in position 1 (from O(-))  
- V is in the word but not in position 2 (from V(-))  
- I is not in the word (I(x))  
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (from N(-))  
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (from E(-))  

This adds new constraints:
- O is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (from arose, money, coned, ovine)  
Wait, this is impossible because O cannot be in any position if it must be in the word but all positions are ruled out.

This suggests an inconsistency, but the feedback must be interpreted carefully.

Re-examining:
- arose: O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3  
- money: O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 2  
- coned: O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 2  
- ovine: O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 1  

So O is in the word but cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 – which is impossible.  
This indicates O must be in position 5 (since positions 1-4 are ruled out).

Similarly, E is in the word but cannot be in positions 4, 5 (from arose, money, coned) – but position 5 is now ruled out for O, so E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  
But position 3 is N, so E must be in position 1 or 2.

Let’s re-express the constraints:

Letters definitely present: O, E, N  
Letters definitely absent: A, R, S, Y, C, D, I  

Positions ruled out:
- O cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4  
  ⇒ O must be in position 5  
- E cannot be in positions 4, 5  
  ⇒ E must be in position 1 or 2  
- N is in position 3 and cannot appear elsewhere  

So the word pattern is: _ _ N _ O (with E in position 1 or 2)

Possible patterns:
- E _ N _ O  
- _ E N _ O  

We need two more fresh letters for the remaining positions from the unused letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z  

Let’s look for 5-letter words fitting E _ N _ O or _ E N _ O:

E _ N _ O:
- E N D O (but D is out)  
- E V N O (invalid)  
- E B N O (invalid)  
- E L N O (invalid)  

_ E N _ O:
- B E N O (invalid)  
- F E N O (invalid)  
- G E N O (invalid)  
- H E N O (invalid)  
- K E N O (invalid)  
- L E N O (invalid)  
- M E N O (invalid)  
- P E N O (invalid)  
- T E N O (invalid)  
- V E N O (invalid)  

Actually, let’s think of real words:
- ""tenon"" – T E N O N (but N is already in position 3 and cannot appear elsewhere)  
- ""penon"" – P E N O N (same issue)  

Hmm, seems like we need to use fresh letters. Let’s pick two fresh letters and construct a word.

For _ E N _ O:
- Let’s pick T and L: T E N L O – not a word  
- P E N T O – P E N T O (valid word: PENTO? No, PENTO is not a common word)  
- B E N T O – BENTO (valid word)  

BENTO fits:
- B (fresh)  
- E (position 2)  
- N (position 3)  
- T (fresh)  
- O (position 5)  

Check constraints:
- Letters used: B, E, N, T, O – all allowed  
- Positions:  
  - E in position 2 (allowed)  
  - O in position 5 (allowed)  
  - N in position 3 (matches ✓)  
- All letters are fresh except N, O, E which are known.

Therefore, the next guess is BENTO.

<guess>bento</guess>",bento,"From all feedback so far:

Letters definitely absent: A, R, S, Y, C, D, I  
Letters definitely present: O, E, N  
Positions ruled out:
- O cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (from arose, money, coned, ovine)  
- E cannot be in positions 4, 5 (from arose, money, coned)  
- N is in position 3 and cannot appear elsewhere  

So far the word looks like: _ _ N _ _

We still need to place:
- O in position 1 (only remaining spot for O)  
- E in position 1 or 2 (only remaining spots for E)  

But O and E cannot both be in position 1.  
Therefore:
- O must be in position 1  
- E must be in position 2  

So the word pattern is: O E N _ _

We need two more fresh letters for positions 4 and 5 from the remaining unused common letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z  

Common 5-letter words fitting O E N _ _:
- oven (but needs 5 letters)  
- over (R is out)  
- oven (4 letters)  
- ovate (A is out)  
- ovine (I is out)  
- ovens (S is out)  

Looking for 5-letter words with O E N _ _:
- “oven” is 4 letters.  
- “ovens” is 5 letters but S is out.  
- “ovine” is 5 letters but I is out.  
- “ovate” is 5 letters but A is out.  
- “over” is 4 letters.  
- “over” plus one letter: “over-” but we need a valid word.  

Actually, let’s list valid 5-letter words with O E N _ _:

1. O E N _ _  
   Possible: O E N B _ (no common word)  
   O E N K _ (no)  
   O E N T _ (no)  
   O E N V _ (no)  
   O E N M _ (no)  
   O E N L _ (no)  

Wait, let’s think differently. Maybe O is not in position 1? But all positions except 1 are ruled out for O.  
Therefore O must be in position 1.

So the word is O E N _ _ and we need two more letters from remaining: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z  

Looking for common words:
- “ovens” – S is out  
- “ovine” – I is out  
- “ovate” – A is out  
- “ovens” – S is out  
- “over” – 4 letters  

Actually, let’s look for words that fit O E N _ _:

- “ovens” – S is out  
- “ovine” – I is out  
- “ovate” – A is out  
- “ovens” – S is out  

Hmm, seems like O E N _ _ is not yielding common words. Maybe I missed something.

Wait, let’s check if N is allowed elsewhere. But N is in position 3 and cannot appear elsewhere.

Let me re-examine the feedback:

Guess 4: ovine -> FEEDBACK: O(-) V(-) I(x) N(-) E(-)

This means:
- O is in the word but not in position 1 (from O(-))  
- V is in the word but not in position 2 (from V(-))  
- I is not in the word (I(x))  
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (from N(-))  
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (from E(-))  

This adds new constraints:
- O is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (from arose, money, coned, ovine)  
Wait, this is impossible because O cannot be in any position if it must be in the word but all positions are ruled out.

This suggests an inconsistency, but the feedback must be interpreted carefully.

Re-examining:
- arose: O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3  
- money: O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 2  
- coned: O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 2  
- ovine: O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 1  

So O is in the word but cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 – which is impossible.  
This indicates O must be in position 5 (since positions 1-4 are ruled out).

Similarly, E is in the word but cannot be in positions 4, 5 (from arose, money, coned) – but position 5 is now ruled out for O, so E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  
But position 3 is N, so E must be in position 1 or 2.

Let’s re-express the constraints:

Letters definitely present: O, E, N  
Letters definitely absent: A, R, S, Y, C, D, I  

Positions ruled out:
- O cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4  
  ⇒ O must be in position 5  
- E cannot be in positions 4, 5  
  ⇒ E must be in position 1 or 2  
- N is in position 3 and cannot appear elsewhere  

So the word pattern is: _ _ N _ O (with E in position 1 or 2)

Possible patterns:
- E _ N _ O  
- _ E N _ O  

We need two more fresh letters for the remaining positions from the unused letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z  

Let’s look for 5-letter words fitting E _ N _ O or _ E N _ O:

E _ N _ O:
- E N D O (but D is out)  
- E V N O (invalid)  
- E B N O (invalid)  
- E L N O (invalid)  

_ E N _ O:
- B E N O (invalid)  
- F E N O (invalid)  
- G E N O (invalid)  
- H E N O (invalid)  
- K E N O (invalid)  
- L E N O (invalid)  
- M E N O (invalid)  
- P E N O (invalid)  
- T E N O (invalid)  
- V E N O (invalid)  

Actually, let’s think of real words:
- ""tenon"" – T E N O N (but N is already in position 3 and cannot appear elsewhere)  
- ""penon"" – P E N O N (same issue)  

Hmm, seems like we need to use fresh letters. Let’s pick two fresh letters and construct a word.

For _ E N _ O:
- Let’s pick T and L: T E N L O – not a word  
- P E N T O – P E N T O (valid word: PENTO? No, PENTO is not a common word)  
- B E N T O – BENTO (valid word)  

BENTO fits:
- B (fresh)  
- E (position 2)  
- N (position 3)  
- T (fresh)  
- O (position 5)  

Check constraints:
- Letters used: B, E, N, T, O – all allowed  
- Positions:  
  - E in position 2 (allowed)  
  - O in position 5 (allowed)  
  - N in position 3 (matches ✓)  
- All letters are fresh except N, O, E which are known.

Therefore, the next guess is BENTO.",Guess 6: bento -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) N(✓) T(x) O(-),FAIL
