### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

After considering options, ""SLATE"" is a strong first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common ending letter)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word and will provide useful feedback for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the secret word ends with E.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Does NOT contain S, L, A, T.

Common consonants left to use: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, R, V, W, Y, etc.
Common vowels left to use: I, O, U (since A is out).

A good second guess should test several new common letters. Let’s try a word like “CRIME”:
- Ends with E (matches the known final letter).
- Uses C, R, I, M – none of which were in SLATE.
- Tests the common letters C, R, I, M.

Another option is “PRIME” or “CRONE”, but “CRIME” seems slightly more balanced.

Let’s summarize everything we now know after three guesses.

1. Word ends with E (from SLATE and CRIME feedback).
2. Forbidden letters (never appear): S, L, A, T, C, I, D.
3. Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions:
   - R (from CRIME: not in position 2; from MORED: not in position 3)
   - M (from CRIME: not in position 4; from MORED: not in position 1)
   - O (from MORED: not in position 2)
4. Therefore:
   - R must be in position 4 or 5 (since it cannot be 1, 2, or 3).
   - M must be in position 2 or 5 (since it cannot be 1 or 4).
   - O must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (since it cannot be 2).

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that contains both R and M, and O somewhere, without using any forbidden letters.

Possible positions:
- If R is in position 4: word looks like _ _ _ R E
- If R is in position 5: word looks like _ _ _ _ E (but then R must be in position 5)

Let’s try R in position 4: _ _ _ R E
Then M must be in position 2 or 5. Position 5 is E, so M must be in position 2.
Then O must be in position 1 or 3.

Option 1: O in position 1, M in position 2, R in position 4:
O M _ R E → need a letter for position 3 that is allowed (not S,L,A,T,C,I,D). Allowed letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Let’s pick a common one like N: OM_NRE → OM_NRE doesn’t make sense. Wait, we need a valid word.

Option 2: O in position 3, M in position 2, R in position 4:
_ M O R E → need a letter for position 1. Allowed letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Valid word: B M O R E → “BMORE” isn’t valid. N M O R E → “NMORE” isn’t valid. Let’s try “BMORE” – no, that’s not a word. “GMORE” – no. “HMORE” – no. “PMORE” – no. “KMORE” – no. “FMORE” – no. “JMORE” – no. “YMORE” – no. “VMORE” – no. “WMORE” – no. “XMORE” – no. “ZMORE” – no. “QMORE” – no. “UMORE” – no. “UMORE” is not valid.

Hmm, maybe R is in position 5 instead:
Word looks like _ _ _ _ E with R in position 5: _ _ _ _ R E → but that’s 6 letters. Wait, no, position 5 is E, so R cannot be in position 5. Therefore R must be in position 4, and M must be in position 2, and O must be in position 1 or 3.

Let’s try O in position 1, M in position 2, R in position 4:
O M _ R E → need a letter for position 3 that is allowed and makes a valid word. Possible letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Let’s try N: O M N R E → “OMNRE” isn’t valid. Try G: O M G R E → “OMGRE” isn’t valid. Try H: O M H R E → “OMHRE” isn’t valid. Try K: O M K R E → “OMKRE” isn’t valid. Try P: O M P R E → “OMPRE” isn’t valid. Try B: O M B R E → “OMBRE” – that’s a valid word (French for “shadow” or a type of makeup).

Let’s check if “OMBRE” fits all constraints:
- Ends with E: ✓
- Contains R and M: ✓
- R is in position 4 (was wrong in positions 2 and 3, now in 4): ✓
- M is in position 2 (was wrong in positions 1 and 4, now in 2): ✓
- O is in position 1 (was wrong in position 2, now in 1): ✓
- Forbidden letters: S,L,A,T,C,I,D – none are present: ✓

“OMBRE” seems to satisfy all conditions.
