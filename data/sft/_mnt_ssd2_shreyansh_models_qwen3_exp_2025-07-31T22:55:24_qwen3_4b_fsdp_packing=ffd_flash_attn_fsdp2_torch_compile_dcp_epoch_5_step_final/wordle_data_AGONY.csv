### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many letters quickly. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, etc. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback so far:

1. arose → A(✓) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
   - Pattern: A _ O _ _
   - Excluded letters: R, S, E

2. aloft → A(✓) L(x) O(✓) F(x) T(x)
   - Pattern still: A _ O _ _
   - Additional excluded letters: L, F, T

3. among → A(✓) M(x) O(✓) N(✓) G(-)
   - Pattern: A _ O N _
   - Excluded letters: M
   - G is in the word but not in position 5 (so G must be in position 2 or 4)
   - N is in the word and in the correct position 4

So the confirmed pattern is: A _ O N _ and G must be in position 2 or 4. But position 4 is already N, so G must be in position 2.

Therefore the word must be A G O N _.

Now we need a 5-letter word that starts with AGON and ends with a letter not yet excluded. Letters already excluded: R, S, E, L, F, T, M. Remaining possible consonants: D, H, C, P, Y, etc. Common endings for AGON: AGONY, AGONZ (not a word), AGONS (not a word), AGONI (not a word), AGOND (not a word). The only valid common word is AGONY.

Check: AGONY – letters A, G, O, N, Y. None of these letters are in the excluded list. It fits the pattern A G O N Y. This should give us the final letter Y.

Let’s guess AGONY.
