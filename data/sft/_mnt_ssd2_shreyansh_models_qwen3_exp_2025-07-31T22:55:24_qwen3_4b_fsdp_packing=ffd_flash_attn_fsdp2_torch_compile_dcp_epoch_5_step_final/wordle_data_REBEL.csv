For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (covers R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose SLATE because it contains 5 very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) that appear frequently in English words, giving us good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word.

From all feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)
   - L is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2
   - E is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5
   - S, A, T are NOT in the word

2. LINED → L(-) I(x) N(x) E(✓) D(x)
   - E is confirmed in position 4 (✓)
   - L is in the word but not in position 1
   - I, N, D are NOT in the word

3. GLOVE → G(x) L(-) O(x) V(x) E(-)
   - E is in position 4 (✓) — consistent
   - L is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3
   - G, O, V are NOT in the word

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ _ E _
- L must be in position 5 (only remaining spot)
- Forbidden letters: S, A, T, I, N, D, G, O, V
- Remaining common letters to test: B, C, F, H, K, M, P, Q, R, U, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word ending in L, with E in position 4, and avoiding all forbidden letters. Possible candidates:
- B L E E L → invalid (double E)
- C L E E L → invalid
- F L E E L → invalid
- P L E E L → invalid
- M E E L → 4 letters

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (covers R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose SLATE because it contains 5 very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) that appear frequently in English words, giving us good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word (x)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is not in the word (x)
- T is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains L and E somewhere (but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively)
- Does NOT contain S, A, or T

Letters we still need to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

A good next guess should:
1. Keep L and E in different positions
2. Introduce several new common letters
3. Avoid S, A, T

Possible candidates:
- LEARN (but has A which is ruled out)
- LINED (has I, N, D - none ruled out yet)
- LEVER (has V, R - but E is already ruled out in position 5)
- LINED seems good: L in position 1 (different from SLATE's position 2), E in position 2 (different from SLATE's position 5), and introduces I, N, D

<guess>LINED</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: LINED -> FEEDBACK: L(-) I(x) N(x) E(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)
   - L is in the word but not in position 2
   - E is in the word but not in position 5
   - S, A, T are NOT in the word

2. LINED → L(-) I(x) N(x) E(✓) D(x)
   - E is in position 4 (✓)
   - L is in the word but not in position 1
   - I, N, D are NOT in the word

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern _ _ _ E _ (E is fixed in position 4)
- L is somewhere in positions 3 or 5 (since it cannot be 1 or 2)
- Forbidden letters: S, A, T, I, N, D
- We still need to test common remaining letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

A good next guess should:
- Keep E in position 4
- Place L in position 3 or 5
- Introduce several new common letters

Candidate words:
- BLOKE (but K is less common)
- CLOVE (but V is less common)
- GLOVE (G and V)
- PROLE (P, R, O, L, E)
- MELON (but N is forbidden)
- FROZE (but Z is less common)

PROLE seems good:
- P, R, O are new letters
- L is in position 4 (but E is in position 4, so this would conflict) → Actually, L would be in position 4, which is E's spot → bad placement.

Next try: GLOVE
- G, O, V are new
- L is in position 3 (allowed)
- E is in position 4 (fixed)
- V is new

GLOVE looks good.

From the three rounds of feedback we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)
   - L is in the word but not in position 2
   - E is in the word but not in position 5
   - S, A, T are NOT in the word

2. LINED → L(-) I(x) N(x) E(✓) D(x)
   - E is in position 4 (✓)
   - L is in the word but not in position 1
   - I, N, D are NOT in the word

3. GLOVE → G(x) L(-) O(x) V(x) E(-)
   - G, O, V are NOT in the word
   - L is in the word but not in position 3
   - E is in the word but not in position 5 (already known)

Current knowledge:
- The word has the pattern _ _ _ E _ (E is fixed in position 4)
- L is in position 5 (since it cannot be 1, 2, or 3)
- Forbidden letters so far: S, A, T, I, N, D, G, O, V
- Remaining common letters to test: B, C, F, H, K, M, P, R, U, W, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
- Keep E in position 4
- Place L in position 5
- Introduce several new common letters in positions 1, 2, 3

Candidate words:
- BENCH (but N is forbidden)
- CREAK (but A is forbidden)
- FLECK (but C, K are new)
- PLECK (but C, K are new)
- WREAK (but A is forbidden)
- BRECK (but C, K are new)
- CREPT (but T is forbidden)
- FLECK, PLECK, BRECK all fit the pattern _ _ _ E L with new letters

FLECK seems good:
- F, C, K are new letters
- L is in position 5 (allowed)
- E is in position 4 (fixed)

However, C is not yet ruled out, and F, K are new. Let's go with FLECK.

But wait, let me check: FLECK has F, L, E, C, K. L is in position 3, but we know L cannot be in position 3 (from GLOVE feedback). So FLECK is invalid.

Next candidate: PLECK
- P, L, E, C, K
- L is in position 2, which is allowed (positions 1,2,3,4,5 - L cannot be 1,2,3 from feedback, but wait: from SLATE L(-) means not position 2, from LINED L(-) means not position 1, from GLOVE L(-) means not position 3. So L can only be in position 4 or 5. But position 4 is E, so L must be in position 5. Therefore, L must be in position 5.

Thus the pattern is _ _ _ E L

So the word is _ _ _ E L

Now we need to fill positions 1,2,3 with letters not yet ruled out.

Forbidden letters: S, A, T, I, N, D, G, O, V

Remaining common letters: B, C, F, H, K, M, P, R, U, W, Y, etc.

We need three distinct letters from this set.

Possible combinations:
- B, R, E, L → but E is already used in position 4, so B, R, ?
- C, H, E, L → C, H, ?
- P, R, E, L → P, R, ?
- B, R, E, L → B, R, ?
- C, R, E, L → C, R, ?
- B, R, E, L → B, R, ?

Let's think of valid 5-letter words ending in EL:
- BREAD → but A is forbidden
- BREED → D is forbidden
- BRECK → K is new
- BRENT → T is forbidden
- CREEL → C, R, E, E, L → but E is already in position 4, so duplicate E is allowed, but let's check letters: C, R, E, E, L. C and R are new, E is allowed, L is allowed. This seems valid.

CREEL:
- C (new)
- R (new)
- E (already known in position 4, but duplicate allowed)
- E (duplicate)
- L (known in position 5)

But duplicate E might not be optimal, but it's valid.

Another candidate: BRECK
- B (new)
- R (new)
- E (known in position 4, but duplicate allowed)
- C (new)
- K (new)

BRECK is a valid word and uses three new letters (B, R, C, K) but has duplicate E. However, since E is already fixed in position 4, having another E in position 3 is acceptable.

Between CREEL and BRECK, CREEL uses C and R which are common. Let's go with CREEL.

But let me check if CREEL is a valid word. Yes, it is (a small fish or a type of reed).

Thus, the next guess should be CREEL.

- P, R, E, L → P, R, ?
- B, R, E, L → B, R, ?
- C, R, E, L → C, R, ?
- B, R, E, L → B, R, ?

Let's think of valid 5-letter words ending in EL:
- BREAD → but A is forbidden
- BREED → D is forbidden
- BRECK → K is new
- BRENT → T is forbidden
- CREEL → C, R, E, E, L → but E is already in position 4, so duplicate E is allowed, but let's check letters: C, R, E, E, L. C and R are new, E is allowed, L is allowed. This seems valid.

CREEL:
- C (new)
- R (new)
- E (already known in position 4, but duplicate allowed)
- E (duplicate)
- L (known in position 5)

But duplicate E might not be optimal, but it's valid.

Another candidate: BRECK
- B (new)
- R (new)
- E (known in position 4, but duplicate allowed)
- C (new)
- K (new)

BRECK is a valid word and uses three new letters (B, R, C, K) but has duplicate E. However, since E is already fixed in position 4, having another E in position 3 is acceptable.

Between CREEL and BRECK, CREEL uses C and R which are common. Let's go with CREEL.

But let me check if CREEL is a valid word. Yes, it is (a small fish or a type of reed).

Thus, the next guess should be CREEL.",Guess 5: CREEL -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) E(-) E(✓) L(✓),FAIL

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (covers R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose SLATE because it contains 5 very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) that appear frequently in English words, giving us good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word (x)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is not in the word (x)
- T is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains L and E somewhere (but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively)
- Does NOT contain S, A, or T

Letters we still need to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

A good next guess should:
1. Keep L and E in different positions
2. Introduce several new common letters
3. Avoid S, A, T

Possible candidates:
- LEARN (but has A which is ruled out)
- LINED (has I, N, D - none ruled out yet)
- LEVER (has V, R - but E is already ruled out in position 5)
- LINED seems good: L in position 1 (different from SLATE's position 2), E in position 2 (different from SLATE's position 5), and introduces I, N, D

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: LINED -> FEEDBACK: L(-) I(x) N(x) E(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)
   - L is in the word but not in position 2
   - E is in the word but not in position 5
   - S, A, T are NOT in the word

2. LINED → L(-) I(x) N(x) E(✓) D(x)
   - E is in position 4 (✓)
   - L is in the word but not in position 1
   - I, N, D are NOT in the word

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern _ _ _ E _ (E is fixed in position 4)
- L is somewhere in positions 3 or 5 (since it cannot be 1 or 2)
- Forbidden letters: S, A, T, I, N, D
- We still need to test common remaining letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

A good next guess should:
- Keep E in position 4
- Place L in position 3 or 5
- Introduce several new common letters

Candidate words:
- BLOKE (but K is less common)
- CLOVE (but V is less common)
- GLOVE (G and V)
- PROLE (P, R, O, L, E)
- MELON (but N is forbidden)
- FROZE (but Z is less common)

PROLE seems good:
- P, R, O are new letters
- L is in position 4 (but E is in position 4, so this would conflict) → Actually, L would be in position 4, which is E's spot → bad placement.

Next try: GLOVE
- G, O, V are new
- L is in position 3 (allowed)
- E is in position 4 (fixed)
- V is new

GLOVE looks good.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three rounds of feedback we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)
   - L is in the word but not in position 2
   - E is in the word but not in position 5
   - S, A, T are NOT in the word

2. LINED → L(-) I(x) N(x) E(✓) D(x)
   - E is in position 4 (✓)
   - L is in the word but not in position 1
   - I, N, D are NOT in the word

3. GLOVE → G(x) L(-) O(x) V(x) E(-)
   - G, O, V are NOT in the word
   - L is in the word but not in position 3
   - E is in the word but not in position 5 (already known)

Current knowledge:
- The word has the pattern _ _ _ E _ (E is fixed in position 4)
- L is in position 5 (since it cannot be 1, 2, or 3)
- Forbidden letters so far: S, A, T, I, N, D, G, O, V
- Remaining common letters to test: B, C, F, H, K, M, P, R, U, W, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
- Keep E in position 4
- Place L in position 5
- Introduce several new common letters in positions 1, 2, 3

Candidate words:
- BENCH (but N is forbidden)
- CREAK (but A is forbidden)
- FLECK (but C, K are new)
- PLECK (but C, K are new)
- WREAK (but A is forbidden)
- BRECK (but C, K are new)
- CREPT (but T is forbidden)
- FLECK, PLECK, BRECK all fit the pattern _ _ _ E L with new letters

FLECK seems good:
- F, C, K are new letters
- L is in position 5 (allowed)
- E is in position 4 (fixed)

However, C is not yet ruled out, and F, K are new. Let's go with FLECK.

But wait, let me check: FLECK has F, L, E, C, K. L is in position 3, but we know L cannot be in position 3 (from GLOVE feedback). So FLECK is invalid.

Next candidate: PLECK
- P, L, E, C, K
- L is in position 2, which is allowed (positions 1,2,3,4,5 - L cannot be 1,2,3 from feedback, but wait: from SLATE L(-) means not position 2, from LINED L(-) means not position 1, from GLOVE L(-) means not position 3. So L can only be in position 4 or 5. But position 4 is E, so L must be in position 5. Therefore, L must be in position 5.

Thus the pattern is _ _ _ E L

So the word is _ _ _ E L

Now we need to fill positions 1,2,3 with letters not yet ruled out.

Forbidden letters: S, A, T, I, N, D, G, O, V

Remaining common letters: B, C, F, H, K, M, P, R, U, W, Y, etc.

We need three distinct letters from this set.

Possible combinations:
- B, R, E, L → but E is already used in position 4, so B, R, ?
- C, H, E, L → C, H, ?
- P, R, E, L → P, R, ?
- B, R, E, L → B, R, ?
- C, R, E, L → C, R, ?
- B, R, E, L → B, R, ?

Let's think of valid 5-letter words ending in EL:
- BREAD → but A is forbidden
- BREED → D is forbidden
- BRECK → K is new
- BRENT → T is forbidden
- CREEL → C, R, E, E, L → but E is already in position 4, so duplicate E is allowed, but let's check letters: C, R, E, E, L. C and R are new, E is allowed, L is allowed. This seems valid.

CREEL:
- C (new)
- R (new)
- E (already known in position 4, but duplicate allowed)
- E (duplicate)
- L (known in position 5)

But duplicate E might not be optimal, but it's valid.

Another candidate: BRECK
- B (new)
- R (new)
- E (known in position 4, but duplicate allowed)
- C (new)
- K (new)

BRECK is a valid word and uses three new letters (B, R, C, K) but has duplicate E. However, since E is already fixed in position 4, having another E in position 3 is acceptable.

Between CREEL and BRECK, CREEL uses C and R which are common. Let's go with CREEL.

But let me check if CREEL is a valid word. Yes, it is (a small fish or a type of reed).

Thus, the next guess should be CREEL.

Let's consolidate everything we now know after five guesses.

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)
   - L is in the word but not in position 2
   - E is in the word but not in position 5
   - S, A, T are NOT in the word

2. LINED → L(-) I(x) N(x) E(✓) D(x)
   - E is in position 4 (✓)
   - L is in the word but not in position 1
   - I, N, D are NOT in the word

3. GLOVE → G(x) L(-) O(x) V(x) E(-)
   - G, O, V are NOT in the word
   - L is in the word but not in position 3
   - E is in the word but not in position 5 (already known)

4. CREEL → C(x) R(-) E(-) E(✓) L(✓)
   - C is NOT in the word
   - R is in the word but not in position 2
   - E is in the word but not in position 3 (but we already know E is in position 4, so this is consistent)
   - E is in position 4 (✓)
   - L is in position 5 (✓)

Current knowledge:
- Pattern: _ _ _ E L  (positions 4 and 5 are fixed)
- Letters that must appear: R (from R(-) in CREEL)
- Letters that are NOT in the word: S, A, T, I, N, D, G, O, V, C
- Remaining available letters: B, F, H, K, M, P, U, W, Y, etc.
- R must be in positions 1, 3 (since it cannot be in 2, and positions 4 and 5 are E and L)

So the word is either:
- R _ _ E L  (R in position 1)
- _ _ R E L  (R in position 3)
