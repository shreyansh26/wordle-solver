### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Common starting words in Wordle often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"" are popular choices. 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should provide good coverage for the first guess.

Let's extract the new information from Guess 3 (CABAS):

- C(x): C is NOT in the word.
- A(✓) in position 2: A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- B(x): B is NOT in the word.
- A(✓) in position 4: A is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- S(-): S is in the word but in the wrong position (it is not in position 5).

So we now know:
1. The word has A in positions 2 and 4. That gives the pattern: _ A _ A _.
2. S is somewhere in the word but NOT in position 5 (from CABAS feedback) and NOT in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from earlier feedback). The only remaining spot for S is position 3.
3. Forbidden letters so far: R, O, E, T, I, C, B.
4. Allowed letters (still possible): D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the confirmed A and S.

Therefore, the pattern is _ A S A _ and we need a 5-letter word that fits this pattern and uses only allowed letters.

Looking at possible letters for positions 1 and 5:
- Position 1: cannot be A, S (already placed), and must be from the allowed set.
- Position 5: same restrictions.

Possible words:
- DASAL (but L is allowed, but this isn't a valid word)
- FASAL (invalid)
- HASAL (invalid)
- MASAL (invalid)
- NASAL (N, A, S, A, L) – check if this is a valid word: yes, ""NASAL"" is valid.
- PASAL (invalid)
- WASAL (invalid)

""NASAL"" fits:
- N in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (correct)
- S in position 3 (allowed, since S must be in position 3)
- A in position 4 (correct)
- L in position 5 (allowed)
- No forbidden letters.
