### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities early. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring letters like A, E, T, R, S, etc. 

One of the most common 5-letter words is ""AROSE"" because it contains several very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and can help quickly identify which of these letters are present in the secret word. This gives us good coverage for the first guess.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems to be the most balanced choice among common words. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in position 1
- R is in the word but not in position 2
- O is in the word but not in position 3
- S is in the word and is in position 4
- E is not in the word at all

So we know:
- S is fixed in position 4
- The letters A, R, O are somewhere in the remaining four positions (1,2,3,5), but not in their original spots (A≠1, R≠2, O≠3)
- E can be eliminated

A good next guess should:
1. Keep S in position 4
2. Move A, R, O to new positions
3. Introduce new common letters to test

Possible candidates:
- STORM: keeps S in position 4, moves O to 3 (but O can't be in 3), so this is bad
- ROAST: keeps S in 4, moves R to 1, O to 2, A to 3 - all new positions
- STARE: but E is out
- STORM: already saw O can't be in 3
- CRANK: has new letters C, N, K but misses O and R
- STORM: same issue with O
- STORM is bad because O would be in position 3 again

ROAST seems best:
- R in 1 (not 2)
- O in 2 (not 3)
- A in 3 (not 1)
- S in 4 (correct)
- T is new

This tests new positions for A, R, O and introduces T.
