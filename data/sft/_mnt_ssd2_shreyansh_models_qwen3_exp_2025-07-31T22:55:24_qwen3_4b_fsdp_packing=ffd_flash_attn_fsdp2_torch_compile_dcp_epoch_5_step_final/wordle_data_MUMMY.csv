### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these common letters to maximize the information gained.

Looking at these common letters, ""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (common)
- S (common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This combination should give good coverage of common letters and positions, helping me narrow down possibilities efficiently.

All five letters in ""arose"" (A, R, O, S, E) are marked as ""x"", meaning none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates every word containing any of those five letters.  
So I now need a 5-letter English word that uses none of A, R, O, S, E.

Common letters not yet ruled out include: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z, J, Q.

A good next guess should be:
- 5 distinct letters (to maximize information)
- From the remaining pool
- Preferably using common consonants and vowels that haven’t been tested

Let’s pick a word that uses common letters like T, N, I, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K.

A strong candidate is ""UNTIL"":
- U, N, T, I, L are all common letters not yet ruled out
- It tests 5 unique letters
- It gives good coverage of vowels (U, I) and consonants (N, T, L)

This should provide useful feedback to narrow down the remaining possibilities.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these common letters to maximize the information gained.

Looking at these common letters, ""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (common)
- S (common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This combination should give good coverage of common letters and positions, helping me narrow down possibilities efficiently.

All five letters in ""arose"" (A, R, O, S, E) are marked as ""x"", meaning none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates every word containing any of those five letters.  
So I now need a 5-letter English word that uses none of A, R, O, S, E.

Common letters not yet ruled out include: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z, J, Q.

A good next guess should be:
- 5 distinct letters (to maximize information)
- From the remaining pool
- Preferably using common consonants and vowels that haven’t been tested

Let’s pick a word that uses common letters like T, N, I, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K.

A strong candidate is ""UNTIL"":
- U, N, T, I, L are all common letters not yet ruled out
- It tests 5 unique letters
- It gives good coverage of vowels (U, I) and consonants (N, T, L)

This should provide useful feedback to narrow down the remaining possibilities.

So far we know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, L
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are unknown: U (somewhere, but not in position 1)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains the letter U (and not in position 1)
2. Uses only letters that have not been ruled out (so no A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, L)
3. Uses new letters to maximize information

Remaining common letters (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has U in positions 2-5
- Uses only allowed letters

Good candidate letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, W, Y

Let’s try to form a word that uses several of these.  
A simple choice is “BUCKY”:
- B, U, C, K, Y
- U is in position 2
- All letters are allowed
- It introduces 4 new letters (B, C, K, Y) and re-uses U

Another option is “MUFFY” but F is repeated and we don’t know if F is allowed.  
“BUCKY” seems better because it tests 4 new letters plus U.

Let’s go with “BUCKY”.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these common letters to maximize the information gained.

Looking at these common letters, ""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (common)
- S (common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This combination should give good coverage of common letters and positions, helping me narrow down possibilities efficiently.

All five letters in ""arose"" (A, R, O, S, E) are marked as ""x"", meaning none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates every word containing any of those five letters.  
So I now need a 5-letter English word that uses none of A, R, O, S, E.

Common letters not yet ruled out include: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z, J, Q.

A good next guess should be:
- 5 distinct letters (to maximize information)
- From the remaining pool
- Preferably using common consonants and vowels that haven’t been tested

Let’s pick a word that uses common letters like T, N, I, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K.

A strong candidate is ""UNTIL"":
- U, N, T, I, L are all common letters not yet ruled out
- It tests 5 unique letters
- It gives good coverage of vowels (U, I) and consonants (N, T, L)

This should provide useful feedback to narrow down the remaining possibilities.

So far we know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, L
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are unknown: U (somewhere, but not in position 1)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains the letter U (and not in position 1)
2. Uses only letters that have not been ruled out (so no A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, L)
3. Uses new letters to maximize information

Remaining common letters (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has U in positions 2-5
- Uses only allowed letters

Good candidate letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, W, Y

Let’s try to form a word that uses several of these.  
A simple choice is “BUCKY”:
- B, U, C, K, Y
- U is in position 2
- All letters are allowed
- It introduces 4 new letters (B, C, K, Y) and re-uses U

Another option is “MUFFY” but F is repeated and we don’t know if F is allowed.  
“BUCKY” seems better because it tests 4 new letters plus U.

Let’s go with “BUCKY”.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: until -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(x) T(x) I(x) L(x)
Guess 3: buck_y -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The feedback says ""Model answer is not five letters,"" which means the word I guessed (BUCKY) is not valid. I must have made a typo or used an invalid word. The correct word should be five letters. Let me pick a valid five-letter word that contains U (but not in position 1) and only uses letters not ruled out yet.

Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, L  
Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

A valid five-letter word that uses U (not in position 1) and only allowed letters is “MUFFY”.  
- M, U, F, F, Y  
- U is in position 2  
- All letters are allowed  
- It tests new letters F and Y

Let me try “MUFFY”.

Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: until -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(x) T(x) I(x) L(x)

Guess 4: muffy -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) U(✓) F(x) F(x) Y(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   → Letters A, R, O, S, E are **not** in the word.

2. until → U(-) N(x) T(x) I(x) L(x)  
   → Letters N, T, I, L are **not** in the word.  
   → U is in the word but **not** in position 1.

3. buck_y → invalid (not five letters)  
   → We tried “BUCKY” but it wasn’t valid.  
   → We need a **valid** five-letter word.

4. muffy → M(✓) U(✓) F(x) F(x) Y(✓)  
   → M is in position 1 and correct.  
   → U is in position 2 and correct.  
   → Y is in position 5 and correct.  
   → F is not in the word.

So far we know the pattern:  
M _ U _ Y  
Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, L, F  
Letters still allowed: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a valid five-letter word that fits M _ U _ Y and uses only allowed letters.  
Possible candidates:  
- M U U M Y → but we already know U is only once (from feedback).  
- M U C K Y → C, K are allowed.  
- M U D G Y → D, G are allowed.  
- M U B Y → too short.  
- M U V Y → too short.  
- M U P Y → too short.  
- M U H Y → too short.

The only valid five-letter word fitting M _ U _ Y with allowed letters is **MUCKY**.

Check:  
M(✓) U(✓) C(allowed) K(allowed) Y(✓)  
All letters are valid and match the feedback.

Let’s guess MUCKY.
