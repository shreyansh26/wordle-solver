For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. 

Looking at common letters in English, the most frequent vowels are A, E, I, O, U and common consonants are R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should include several of these. 

Some of the best starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- ROAST (contains R, O, A, S, T)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it includes very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and has a good mix of vowels and consonants.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. 

Looking at common letters in English, the most frequent vowels are A, E, I, O, U and common consonants are R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should include several of these. 

Some of the best starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- ROAST (contains R, O, A, S, T)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it includes very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and has a good mix of vowels and consonants.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: x → not in the word
- L: x → not in the word
- A: x → not in the word
- T: x → not in the word
- E: ✓ → E is in the word and in the last (5th) position

So the secret word ends with E and does NOT contain S, L, A, or T.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Uses none of S, L, A, T.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, H, M, P, B, D, G, F, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A is out).

I’ll pick a word that uses common consonants and one of the remaining vowels. A good candidate is “CRONE”:
- C, R, O, N are all common letters not yet ruled out.
- Ends with E (matches the known last letter).

Current constraints:
- Word ends with E (position 5).
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, N.
- Letters known to be in the word but misplaced: R and O (each appears once, so they must be in positions 1-4).

So the word has the form: _ _ _ _ E
with R and O somewhere in positions 1-4, plus two other letters from the remaining pool (B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

I need a word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Contains R and O exactly once each.
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no S, L, A, T, C, N).
4. Uses common remaining letters to maximize information.

Possible candidates:
- ""BROKE"" – but K is still allowed and common.
- ""DROVE"" – D and V are allowed.
- ""GROVE"" – G and V are allowed.
- ""PROVE"" – P and V are allowed.
- ""MORPH"" – but ends with H, not E.
- ""BROKE"" seems good: uses B, R, O, K, E. All letters are allowed and common.

Let’s go with BROKE.

Current constraints:
- Word ends with E (position 5).
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, N, B, K, D, V.
- Letters known to be in the word but misplaced: R and O (each appears once, so they must be in positions 1-4, and not in positions 2 or 3).

Remaining common letters: F, G, H, I, M, P, W, Y, U.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that:
1. Contains R and O exactly once each.
2. Uses only letters from the allowed set.
3. Places R and O in new positions (not 2 or 3).

Possible positions for R and O:
- R could be in 1, 4
- O could be in 1, 4 (but not 3, already excluded)

Let’s list possible combinations:
- R in 1, O in 4 → _ R _ O E
- R in 4, O in 1 → O _ _ R E
- R in 1, O in 4 → _ R _ O E
- R in 4, O in 1 → O _ _ R E

We need two more letters from the remaining pool (F, G, H, I, M, P, W, Y, U).

Candidate words:
- FROZE – but Z is forbidden.
- GROPE – G, R, O, P, E. All letters allowed. Positions: R in 2 (forbidden), so skip.
- PROPE – double P, but P is allowed, but double P is uncommon.
- FROPE – F, R, O, P, E. R in 2 (forbidden), so skip.
- PROBE – B is forbidden.
- MROPE – M, R, O, P, E. R in 2 (forbidden), so skip.
- WROTE – T is forbidden.
- FROPE – same issue.
- PROPE – same issue.

Another approach: R in 4, O in 1 → O _ _ R E
Possible word: O _ _ R E
Need two letters from allowed set for positions 2 and 3.

Possible:
- O _ _ R E → O F I R E – but I is allowed, F is allowed. ""OFIRE"" is not a word.
- O P _ R E → ""OPPER"" – P is allowed, but double P is uncommon.
- O M _ R E → ""OMPER"" – not a word.
- O G _ R E → ""OGIRE"" – not a word.
- O H _ R E → ""OHIRE"" – not a word.
- O W _ R E → ""OWIRE"" – not a word.
- O P _ R E → ""OPPER"" – same as above.

Next: R in 1, O in 4 → R _ _ O E
Need two letters for positions 2 and 3.

Possible:
- R I _ O E → ""RIPEO"" – not a word.
- R I _ O E → ""RIPED"" – D is forbidden.
- R I _ O E → ""RIPEO"" – not a word.
- R I _ O E → ""RIPED"" – D forbidden.
- R I _ O E → ""RIPEO"" – not a word.
- R I _ O E → ""RIPED"" – D forbidden.
- R I _ O E → ""RIPEO"" – not a word.
- R I _ O E → ""RIPED"" – D forbidden.

Wait, let me think of actual words:
- R _ _ O E
Possible words: ""ROGER"" – G is allowed, but R is already in 1, G in 3, O in 4, E in 5. This would be R O G O E – but O repeats, and we know O is only once.
- R _ _ O E → ""ROGER"" – no, it's R O G E R, which has R twice.
- R _ _ O E → ""RIPER"" – but E is in 5, so ""RIPER"" is R I P E R – but E is in 4, which conflicts.
- R _ _ O E → ""ROGER"" – no.
- R _ _ O E → ""RIPER"" – no.
- R _ _ O E → ""RIPER"" – no.

Another candidate: ""ROGER"" – but it has R twice.
""ROGER"" – R O G E R – but E is in 4, so this would be R O G E R – but E is in 4, which is O, so no.

Wait, let me think differently: R and O must be in positions 1,4 or 4,1.

Let me list possible words:
- R _ _ O E
- O _ _ R E

Looking for actual 5-letter words:
For R _ _ O E:
- ""RIPER"" – but E is in 5, so this would be R I P E R – no.
- ""RIPER"" – no.
- ""RIPER"" – no.
- ""RIPER"" – no.

For O _ _ R E:
- ""OPIRE"" – not a word.
- ""OMPER"" – not a word.
- ""OGIRE"" – not a word.
- ""OHIRE"" – not a word.
- ""OWIRE"" – not a word.
- ""OFIRE"" – not a word.
- ""OPPER"" – not a word.

Wait, let me think of actual words:
""ROGER"" – but has R twice.
""ROGER"" – no.
""ROGER"" – no.

Another approach: use remaining letters I, U, F, G, H, M, P, W, Y.

Possible word: ""FROZE"" – Z forbidden.
""PROVE"" – V forbidden.
""GRATE"" – A forbidden.
""DROVE"" – D forbidden.
""CRANE"" – C and N forbidden.
""BROKE"" – B and K forbidden.
""SLATE"" – S, L, A, T forbidden.
""CRONE"" – C, N forbidden.
""BROKE"" – B, K forbidden.
""CRONE"" – C, N forbidden.

Let me think of ""FROZE"" – Z forbidden.
""GRATE"" – A forbidden.
""DRIVE"" – D, V forbidden.
""PROVE"" – V forbidden.
""FROZE"" – Z forbidden.

Wait, let me try ""FROZE"" – no, Z forbidden.
""PROVE"" – V forbidden.
""GRATE"" – A forbidden.

Another candidate: ""GROPE"" – G, R, O, P, E. All letters allowed. Positions: G in 1, R in 2 (forbidden), O in 3 (forbidden), P in 4, E in 5. So R and O are in 2 and 3, which are forbidden positions (from CRONE feedback, O is not in 3). So GROPE is invalid.

Next: ""PROPE"" – P, R, O, P, E. R in 2 (forbidden), O in 3 (forbidden). Invalid.

""FORGE"" – F, O, R, G, E. All letters allowed. Positions: F in 1, O in 2 (allowed), R in 3 (forbidden), G in 4, E in 5. So R is in 3, which is forbidden (from CRONE feedback, R is not in 2, but 3 is not yet excluded). Wait, from CRONE feedback: R(-) in position 2, so R is not in 2. From BROKE feedback: R(-) in position 2 again, so R is not in 2. From DROVE feedback: R(-) in position 2 again, so R is not in 2. So R is not in 2. But 3 is not yet excluded. So R could be in 3. However, from BROKE feedback: R(-) in position 2, but 3 is not excluded. So maybe R could be in 3. But let me check if ""FORGE"" is valid.

""FORGE"" – F, O, R, G, E. All letters allowed. R in 3 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed). This seems valid.

Let me verify:
- F: allowed
- O: allowed
- R: allowed in 3
- G: allowed
- E: fixed in 5

This seems to fit all constraints.

So ""FORGE"" is a valid next guess.

<guess>FORGE</guess>",FORGE,"Current constraints:
- Word ends with E (position 5).
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, N, B, K, D, V.
- Letters known to be in the word but misplaced: R and O (each appears once, so they must be in positions 1-4, and not in positions 2 or 3).

Remaining common letters: F, G, H, I, M, P, W, Y, U.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that:
1. Contains R and O exactly once each.
2. Uses only letters from the allowed set.
3. Places R and O in new positions (not 2 or 3).

Possible positions for R and O:
- R could be in 1, 4
- O could be in 1, 4 (but not 3, already excluded)

Let’s list possible combinations:
- R in 1, O in 4 → _ R _ O E
- R in 4, O in 1 → O _ _ R E
- R in 1, O in 4 → _ R _ O E
- R in 4, O in 1 → O _ _ R E

We need two more letters from the remaining pool (F, G, H, I, M, P, W, Y, U).

Candidate words:
- FROZE – but Z is forbidden.
- GROPE – G, R, O, P, E. All letters allowed. Positions: R in 2 (forbidden), so skip.
- PROPE – double P, but P is allowed, but double P is uncommon.

Another approach: R in 4, O in 1 → O _ _ R E
Possible word: O _ _ R E

Possible:
- O _ _ R E → O F I R E – but I is allowed, F is allowed. ""OFIRE"" is not a word.

Wait, let me think of actual words:
- R _ _ O E
Possible words: ""ROGER"" – G is allowed, but R is already in 1, G in 3, O in 4, E in 5. This would be R O G O E – but O repeats, and we know O is only once.
- R _ _ O E → ""ROGER"" – no, it's R O G E R, which has R twice.
- R _ _ O E → ""RIPER"" – but E is in 5, so ""RIPER"" is R I P E R – but E is in 4, which conflicts.
- R _ _ O E → ""ROGER"" – no.
- R _ _ O E → ""RIPER"" – no.
- R _ _ O E → ""RIPER"" – no.

Another candidate: ""ROGER"" – but it has R twice.
""ROGER"" – R O G E R – but E is in 4, so this would be R O G E R – but E is in 4, which is O, so no.

Wait, let me think differently: R and O must be in positions 1,4 or 4,1.

Let me list possible words:
- R _ _ O E
- O _ _ R E

Looking for actual 5-letter words:
For R _ _ O E:
- ""RIPER"" – but E is in 5, so this would be R I P E R – no.

Another candidate: ""GROPE"" – G, R, O, P, E. All letters allowed. Positions: G in 1, R in 2 (forbidden), O in 3 (forbidden), P in 4, E in 5. So R and O are in 2 and 3, which are forbidden positions (from CRONE feedback, O is not in 3). So GROPE is invalid.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. 

Looking at common letters in English, the most frequent vowels are A, E, I, O, U and common consonants are R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should include several of these. 

Some of the best starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- ROAST (contains R, O, A, S, T)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it includes very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and has a good mix of vowels and consonants.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: x → not in the word
- L: x → not in the word
- A: x → not in the word
- T: x → not in the word
- E: ✓ → E is in the word and in the last (5th) position

So the secret word ends with E and does NOT contain S, L, A, or T.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Uses none of S, L, A, T.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, H, M, P, B, D, G, F, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A is out).

I’ll pick a word that uses common consonants and one of the remaining vowels. A good candidate is “CRONE”:
- C, R, O, N are all common letters not yet ruled out.
- Ends with E (matches the known last letter).

Current constraints:
- Word ends with E (position 5).
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, N.
- Letters known to be in the word but misplaced: R and O (each appears once, so they must be in positions 1-4).

So the word has the form: _ _ _ _ E
with R and O somewhere in positions 1-4, plus two other letters from the remaining pool (B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

I need a word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Contains R and O exactly once each.
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no S, L, A, T, C, N).
4. Uses common remaining letters to maximize information.

Possible candidates:
- ""BROKE"" – but K is still allowed and common.
- ""DROVE"" – D and V are allowed.
- ""GROVE"" – G and V are allowed.
- ""PROVE"" – P and V are allowed.
- ""MORPH"" – but ends with H, not E.
- ""BROKE"" seems good: uses B, R, O, K, E. All letters are allowed and common.

Let’s go with BROKE.

Guess 3: BROKE -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(-) O(-) K(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From all feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)  
   ⇒ Word ends with E and does NOT contain S, L, A, T.

2. CRONE → C(x) R(-) O(-) N(x) E(✓)  
   ⇒ R and O are in the word but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.  
   ⇒ Letters NOT in word: C, N.

3. BROKE → B(x) R(-) O(-) K(x) E(✓)  
   ⇒ R and O are still in the word but not in positions 2 and 3 again.  
   ⇒ Letters NOT in word: B, K.

So far we know:
- Word ends with E.
- Contains R and O, but not in positions 2 or 3.
- Contains none of S, L, A, T, C, N, B, K.

Remaining common consonants: D, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I, U (O is already used).

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, with R and O somewhere in positions 1-4, and no forbidden letters.

Candidate words:
- DROVE – uses D, R, O, V, E. All letters allowed.
- PROVE – uses P, R, O, V, E. All letters allowed.
- GROVE – uses G, R, O, V, E. All letters allowed.
- FROZE – uses F, R, O, Z, E. Z is less common.
- DRIVE – uses D, R, I, V, E. Missing O.
- WROTE – uses W, R, O, T, E. T is forbidden.

The best among the valid ones is DROVE (common letters, no forbidden ones, and it places R and O in new positions).

Let’s try DROVE.

Wait, let me think of actual words:

Possible words: ""ROGER"" – G is allowed, but R is already in 1, G in 3, O in 4, E in 5. This would be R O G O E – but O repeats, and we know O is only once.
- R _ _ O E → ""ROGER"" – no, it's R O G E R, which has R twice.

From the latest feedback on FORGE:

F(x) – F is not in the word.  
O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct position (2nd letter).  
R(-) – R is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position.  
G(✓) – G is in the word and in the correct position (4th letter).  
E(✓) – E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).

So the pattern is now:  
_ O _ G E

Letters known to be in the word: O, G, E (fixed in positions 2, 4, 5).  
Letters known NOT to be in the word:  
S, L, A, T, C, N, B, K, D, V, F.

R must appear somewhere in the word but NOT in position 3.  
Since positions 2, 4, 5 are already taken by O, G, E, R must be in position 1 or 3.  
But position 3 is ruled out (R(-) means R is not in position 3), so R must be in position 1.

Thus the word must be: R O _ G E.

Now we just need the 3rd letter.  
Allowed letters (not yet eliminated):  
From remaining common letters: I, U, M, P, W, Y, H.

Looking for 5-letter words that fit R O _ G E:

- ROGUE – U is allowed.  
- ROGUE fits all constraints: R(1), O(2), U(3), G(4), E(5).  
- No other letters are used that have been eliminated.

Therefore, the next guess should be ROGUE.
