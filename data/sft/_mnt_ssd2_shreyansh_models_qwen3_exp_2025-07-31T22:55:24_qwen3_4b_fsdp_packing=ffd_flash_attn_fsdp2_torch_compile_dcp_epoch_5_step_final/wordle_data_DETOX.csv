- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should use these letters without repeating any.

Looking at common 5-letter words with these letters, ""SLATE"" is a strong choice because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common)
- E (most common letter)

This combination covers 5 distinct common letters, giving us maximum potential information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Let’s summarize everything we now know after three guesses:

Letters that are NOT in the word:  
S, L, A, R, N, I, C

Letters that ARE in the word:  
T, E, D (each appears exactly once)

Positions ruled out so far:
- T cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 → the only remaining spot is position 3.
- E cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 5 → the only remaining spot is position 3 or 4.  
  But position 3 is already taken by T, so E must be in position 4.
- D cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 5 → the only remaining spots are 1 or 3.  
  Position 3 is taken by T, so D must be in position 1.

So the word must look like:  
D _ T E _

We need one more letter that has not been ruled out (not S, L, A, R, N, I, C).  
Good remaining letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s pick a common letter like G and form the word “DGTE_”.  
A valid 5-letter word fitting this pattern is “DGTE_” → “DGTE_” is not a valid word, so let’s try “DGT E_” → “DGT E_” is invalid.  
Let’s try “D T E D _” → invalid.

Wait, the pattern is D _ T E _.  
Let’s try “D O T E M” → D O T E M is a valid word (a type of mushroom).  
Check letters: D, O, T, E, M — none of the ruled-out letters (S, L, A, R, N, I, C) are present.  
This fits perfectly.

So the next guess is “D O T E M”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should use these letters without repeating any.

Looking at common 5-letter words with these letters, ""SLATE"" is a strong choice because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common)
- E (most common letter)

This combination covers 5 distinct common letters, giving us maximum potential information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: x → S is not in the word.
- L: x → L is not in the word.
- A: x → A is not in the word.
- T: - → T is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E: - → E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So we know:
- The word contains T and E.
- T is not in position 4.
- E is not in position 5.
- The letters S, L, A are not in the word.

To maximize information, we should pick a word that:
1. Includes T and E.
2. Places T in a different position (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).
3. Places E in a different position (positions 1, 2, 3, or 4).
4. Avoids S, L, A entirely.
5. Uses other common letters to test new possibilities.

Good candidate letters to test next: R, N, I, C, O, U, D, etc.

A word that satisfies these constraints is ""TREND"":
- T in position 1 (new position for T).
- E in position 2 (new position for E).
- R, N, D are new letters to test.

Let's consolidate what we know so far:

Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, R, N  
Letters that ARE in the word: T, E, D  
Positions ruled out:
- T cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (from SLATE and TREND feedback).
- E cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (from SLATE and TREND feedback).
- D cannot be in position 5 (from TREND feedback).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains T, E, D exactly once each.
- T must be in position 2, 3, or 5.
- E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
- D must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (i.e., not S, L, A, R, N).

Good remaining letters to test: C, I, O, U, Y, G, H, K, M, P, etc.

Let’s try to construct a word:
- Place T in position 3 (middle slot).
- Place E in position 1 (first slot).
- Place D in position 2 (second slot).
- Now we need two more distinct letters that haven’t been used yet and fit the constraints.

A valid word that fits: E D T _ _  
Possible letters left: C, I, O, U, Y, G, H, K, M, P, etc.

Let’s pick “EDGEY”:
- E (1), D (2), G (3), E (4), Y (5) — but E is already used and we can’t reuse it.
- “EDICT”:
  - E (1), D (2), I (3), C (4), T (5).  
  - T is in position 5 (allowed), E in 1 (allowed), D in 2 (allowed).  
  - All letters are new or already confirmed (I, C are new).  
  - This seems valid.

Thus the pattern becomes:
D E T _ _

The only missing letter must be O (since O is confirmed in the word and cannot be in position 2, and position 4 is still open).  
Therefore, the word is D E T O _.

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with DET and ends with a letter not yet ruled out.  
The only common letter left that fits is Y (forming ""DETOY"") or another valid ending, but ""DETOY"" is not a standard word.  
However, ""DETRO"" is not valid either.  
Wait, let's list valid words that fit DET _ _:

- DETOX (but X is not ruled out, and O is already placed in position 4)
- DETRO (invalid)
- DETON (invalid, N is ruled out)
- DETOL (invalid, L is ruled out)
- DETON is invalid because N is ruled out
- DETOX is valid and uses X, which is not yet ruled out.

But we have O in position 4, so the word must be DET O _.

Looking at valid words:
- DETOX fits: D E T O X
- DETON is invalid (N ruled out)
- DETOL is invalid (L ruled out)
- DETRO is invalid
- DETOX is the only valid word left.

Therefore, the next guess is DETOX.",Guess 5: DETOX -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) E(✓) T(✓) O(✓) X(✓),SUCCESS
