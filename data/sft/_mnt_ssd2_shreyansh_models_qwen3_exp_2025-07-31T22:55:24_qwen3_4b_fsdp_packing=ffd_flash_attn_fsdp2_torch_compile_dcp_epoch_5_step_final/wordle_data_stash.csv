For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word with these common letters to maximize the chance of getting hits.

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good spread of common letters that can quickly reveal information about the secret word.

3. Contains T (but not in position 4)
4. Does NOT contain L or E

I need a new 5-letter word starting with S, containing both A and T, but not L or E. Also, since A cannot be in position 3, and T cannot be in position 4, I should place them in different positions.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5
Possible positions for T: 2, 3, 5 (since 4 is excluded)

Let me think of words that fit these constraints. One possibility is ""STAMP"":
- Starts with S
- Contains A (position 2)
- Contains T (position 2) – wait, but T can't be in position 2 if A is there? No, positions can overlap as long as the constraints are met. Actually, the feedback only tells us about the positions in SLATE, not about overlaps. So ""STAMP"" would have:
  - S(✓) in position 1
  - T in position 2 (not position 4, so this is allowed)
  - A in position 3 (but feedback said A is not in position 3, so this is invalid)

Another option: ""SATIN""
- S(✓) position 1
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- T in position 3 (allowed)
- I and N are new letters
- Contains neither L nor E

This seems valid.

Let me verify:

- E is not in the word (x)

So far we know:
1. Word starts with S
2. Contains A (but not in position 3)
3. Contains T (but not in position 4)
4. Does NOT contain L or E

I need a new 5-letter word starting with S, containing both A and T, but not L or E. Also, since A cannot be in position 3, and T cannot be in position 4, I should place them in different positions.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5
Possible positions for T: 2, 3, 5 (since 4 is excluded)

Let me think of words that fit these constraints. One possibility is ""STAMP"":
- Starts with S
- Contains A (position 2)
- Contains T (position 2) – wait, but T can't be in position 2 if A is there? No, positions can overlap as long as the constraints are met. Actually, the feedback only tells us about the positions in SLATE, not about overlaps. So ""STAMP"" would have:
  - S(✓) in position 1
  - T in position 2 (not position 4, so this is allowed)
  - A in position 3 (but feedback said A is not in position 3, so this is invalid)

Another option: ""SATIN""
- S(✓) position 1
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- T in position 3 (allowed)
- I and N are new letters
- Contains neither L nor E

This seems valid.

Let me verify:
- S ✓ position 1
- A is in word but not position 3 – here it's in position 2, so this is fine
- T is in word but not position 4 – here it's in position 3, so this is fine
- No L or E

""SATIN"" looks good.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the new feedback on SATIN:
- S is still correct in position 1 (✓)
- A is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-)  [previously it was not in position 3]
- T is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-)  [previously it was not in position 4]
- I and N are NOT in the word (x)

So we now know:
1. Word starts with S
2. Contains A (positions 3 or 5 only, since 2 and 3 are excluded)
3. Contains T (positions 2, 3, 4, 5 – but 3 is excluded, so 2, 4, or 5)
4. Does NOT contain L, E, I, N

Possible positions:
- A must be in 3 or 5
- T must be in 2, 4, or 5 (but 5 is also possible for A, so need to check overlaps)

Let me try to construct a word that satisfies:
- S _ _ _ _
- A in 3 or 5
- T in 2, 4, or 5 (but not conflicting with A)

Option 1: A in position 3
Then T must be in 2 or 4 or 5, but 5 is open.

Example: S T A _ _  – but then T is in 2, A in 3 (allowed)
Need two more letters that are not L, E, I, N.

Possible word: ""STARE"" – but E is excluded (from SLATE feedback).
""STARK"" – K is allowed, R is allowed, but check constraints:
- S ✓
- T in 2 (allowed)
- A in 3 (allowed)
- R and K are new letters
- Contains no L, E, I, N
This seems valid.

Option 2: A in position 5
Then T must be in 2, 4, or 5 (but 5 is A), so T in 2 or 4.

Example: S _ _ T A
Need two more letters (positions 2 and 3) not L, E, I, N.

Possible word: ""STRAA"" – but A is repeated and not allowed.
""S T R T A"" – invalid.
""S P R T A"" – P and R allowed, but check constraints:
- S ✓
- T in 4 (allowed)
- A in 5 (allowed)
- P and R are new letters
- No L, E, I, N
This seems valid.

Between ""STARK"" and ""SPRTA"", ""STARK"" is a common word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word with these common letters to maximize the chance of getting hits.

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good spread of common letters that can quickly reveal information about the secret word.

From the latest feedback on STAMP:
- S(✓) T(✓) A(✓) M(x) P(x)

So we now know:
1. The word starts with STA.
2. Positions 4 and 5 must be letters that are NOT in the forbidden set: L, E, I, N, R, K, M, P.
3. The remaining letters allowed for positions 4 and 5 are: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, O, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but S and T are already used in positions 1-3, so they can't appear again).

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with STA and has two distinct letters in positions 4 and 5 from the allowed set.

Looking at common words:
- STAB_ : B is allowed, but we need a 5-letter word. STAB_ is 4 letters.
- STAG_ : G is allowed. STAG_ is 4 letters.
- STAY_ : Y is allowed. STAY_ is 4 letters.
- STA_ _ : need two more letters.

Possible words:
- STASH: S is already used in position 1, and S can't repeat because we have no indication it's allowed in position 4. Also, H is allowed.
- STAND: N is forbidden.
- STARS: R is forbidden.
- STAYS: S is already used in position 1, and S can't repeat.
- STAXX: X is allowed, but this is not a common word.
- STACY: C and Y are allowed, but this is 5 letters: S T A C Y.

Checking STACY:
- S T A C Y
- C and Y are allowed (not in forbidden list)
- No repeats of S, T, A in positions 4 and 5 (C and Y are new)
- This is a valid 5-letter word.

Another possibility is STACY, but let's verify if there's a more common word. STAXY isn't common. STACH isn't a word. STASH is a word, but S is already used in position 1 and we have no indication it can repeat. STACY seems the best fit.

Therefore, the next guess is STACY.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word with these common letters to maximize the chance of getting hits.

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good spread of common letters that can quickly reveal information about the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 (✓)
- L is not in the word at all (x)
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- T is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- E is not in the word (x)

So far we know:
1. Word starts with S
2. Contains A (but not in position 3)
3. Contains T (but not in position 4)
4. Does NOT contain L or E

I need a new 5-letter word starting with S, containing both A and T, but not L or E. Also, since A cannot be in position 3, and T cannot be in position 4, I should place them in different positions.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5
Possible positions for T: 2, 3, 5 (since 4 is excluded)

Let me think of words that fit these constraints. One possibility is ""STAMP"":
- Starts with S
- Contains A (position 2)
- Contains T (position 2) – wait, but T can't be in position 2 if A is there? No, positions can overlap as long as the constraints are met. Actually, the feedback only tells us about the positions in SLATE, not about overlaps. So ""STAMP"" would have:
  - S(✓) in position 1
  - T in position 2 (not position 4, so this is allowed)
  - A in position 3 (but feedback said A is not in position 3, so this is invalid)

Another option: ""SATIN""
- S(✓) position 1
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- T in position 3 (allowed)
- I and N are new letters
- Contains neither L nor E

This seems valid.

Let me verify:
- S ✓ position 1
- A is in word but not position 3 – here it's in position 2, so this is fine
- T is in word but not position 4 – here it's in position 3, so this is fine
- No L or E

""SATIN"" looks good.

Guess 2: SATIN -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(-) T(-) I(x) N(x)

<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on SATIN:
- S is still correct in position 1 (✓)
- A is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-)  [previously it was not in position 3]
- T is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-)  [previously it was not in position 4]
- I and N are NOT in the word (x)

So we now know:
1. Word starts with S
2. Contains A (positions 3 or 5 only, since 2 and 3 are excluded)
3. Contains T (positions 2, 3, 4, 5 – but 3 is excluded, so 2, 4, or 5)
4. Does NOT contain L, E, I, N

Possible positions:
- A must be in 3 or 5
- T must be in 2, 4, or 5 (but 5 is also possible for A, so need to check overlaps)

Let me try to construct a word that satisfies:
- S _ _ _ _
- A in 3 or 5
- T in 2, 4, or 5 (but not conflicting with A)

Option 1: A in position 3
Then T must be in 2 or 4 or 5, but 5 is open.

Example: S T A _ _  – but then T is in 2, A in 3 (allowed)
Need two more letters that are not L, E, I, N.

Possible word: ""STARE"" – but E is excluded (from SLATE feedback).
""STARK"" – K is allowed, R is allowed, but check constraints:
- S ✓
- T in 2 (allowed)
- A in 3 (allowed)
- R and K are new letters
- Contains no L, E, I, N
This seems valid.

Option 2: A in position 5
Then T must be in 2, 4, or 5 (but 5 is A), so T in 2 or 4.

Example: S _ _ T A
Need two more letters (positions 2 and 3) not L, E, I, N.

Possible word: ""STRAA"" – but A is repeated and not allowed.
""S T R T A"" – invalid.
""S P R T A"" – P and R allowed, but check constraints:
- S ✓
- T in 4 (allowed)
- A in 5 (allowed)
- P and R are new letters
- No L, E, I, N
This seems valid.

Between ""STARK"" and ""SPRTA"", ""STARK"" is a common word.

So far we know:
1. Word starts with STA
2. Letters not in the word: L, E, I, N, R, K
3. Positions 4 and 5 are still unknown, but they must be letters not in the forbidden list.

Forbidden letters: L, E, I, N, R, K
Allowed letters: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
But we already have S, T, A used, and positions 4 and 5 must be from the allowed set.

We need two distinct letters (or possibly the same letter if allowed) for positions 4 and 5, avoiding the forbidden ones.

Possible endings:
- STAD_ : D is allowed, but then we need another letter.
- STAG_ : G is allowed.
- STAP_ : P is allowed.
- STAY_ : Y is allowed.
- STA_ _ : need two more letters.

Looking for common words:
- STAMP: P is allowed, M is allowed. Check constraints:
  - S T A M P
  - No forbidden letters (L, E, I, N, R, K)
  - Positions 4 and 5 are M and P, which are allowed.
  - This seems valid.

Let me verify:
- S ✓ position 1
- T ✓ position 2

From the feedback on STACY:
- S(✓) T(✓) A(✓) C(x) Y(x)

So we now know:
1. The word starts with STA.
2. Letters NOT in the word: L, E, I, N, R, K, M, P, C, Y.
3. Positions 4 and 5 must be letters from the remaining allowed set: B, D, F, G, H, J, O, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Z (but S and T are already used in positions 1-3, so they can't appear again).

We need a 5-letter word starting with STA and ending with two distinct letters from the remaining allowed set. The only common word that fits is STASH, but S is already used in position 1 and we have no indication it can repeat. Another possibility is STAVO, but that's not a valid word. 

Looking at the allowed letters, the only remaining common letters are B, D, F, G, H, O, U, V, W, X, Z. The most plausible word is STAVO, but it's not valid. The correct word must be STASH, even though S repeats. However, since we have no feedback against repeating S, and STASH is a valid word, we'll use it.

But wait, STASH has S in position 4, which is allowed because we have no indication that S can't repeat. However, we have no feedback against it. The only valid word left seems to be STASH. 

Let me check again: the remaining letters are B, D, F, G, H, J, O, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Z. The only valid 5-letter word starting with STA is STASH (S T A S H). 

But S is already in position 1, and we have no feedback against it being in position 4. Therefore, STASH is the logical next guess.

However, another possibility is STAVO, but that's not a valid word. The correct word must be STASH.

But wait, let me re-examine the allowed letters. The remaining letters for positions 4 and 5 are B, D, F, G, H, J, O, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Z. The only valid 5-letter word starting with STA and using two of these letters is STASH (S T A S H). 

Therefore, the next guess is STASH.
