For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This can help me quickly determine which vowels are present and their positions, as well as test the consonants R and S.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" which also uses common letters. However, ""AROSE"" might be slightly better for vowel coverage. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
1. Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.
2. Contains S somewhere other than position 4.
3. Has 5 letters, no repeats of A, R, O, E.

Good letters to test next: common consonants and vowels we haven’t tried yet. Vowels left: I, U. Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, Y, etc.

A word that uses S in a new position and tests new common letters is “STINT”:
- S in position 1 (new position).
- T and N are common letters not yet tested.
- I is a new vowel.
- Second T is okay since we don’t know if T repeats yet.

This should give us info on S’s correct position and test T, N, I.

From the new feedback on STINT:

So far we know:

2. Letters not in the word: A, R, O, E, T, N
3. Still need to test common remaining consonants and vowels: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

We need two more letters for positions 2 and 4-5. Common remaining vowels: U, Y. Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P.

A good next guess should:
- Keep S in position 1 and I in position 3.
- Use new letters for positions 2, 4, 5.
- Prefer common letters to maximize information.

Possible candidates:
- S C I D Y (but Y is a vowel here, and D is common)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This can help me quickly determine which vowels are present and their positions, as well as test the consonants R and S.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" which also uses common letters. However, ""AROSE"" might be slightly better for vowel coverage. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
1. Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.
2. Contains S somewhere other than position 4.
3. Has 5 letters, no repeats of A, R, O, E.

Good letters to test next: common consonants and vowels we haven’t tried yet. Vowels left: I, U. Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, Y, etc.

A word that uses S in a new position and tests new common letters is “STINT”:
- S in position 1 (new position).
- T and N are common letters not yet tested.
- I is a new vowel.
- Second T is okay since we don’t know if T repeats yet.

This should give us info on S’s correct position and test T, N, I.

From the new feedback on STINT:
- S is in the word AND in the correct first position (✓).
- I is in the word AND in the correct third position (✓).
- T, N, and the second T are NOT in the word (x).

So far we know:
1. Word pattern: S _ I _ _
2. Letters not in the word: A, R, O, E, T, N
3. Still need to test common remaining consonants and vowels: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

We need two more letters for positions 2 and 4-5. Common remaining vowels: U, Y. Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P.

A good next guess should:
- Keep S in position 1 and I in position 3.
- Use new letters for positions 2, 4, 5.
- Prefer common letters to maximize information.

Possible candidates:
- S C I D Y (but Y is a vowel here, and D is common)
- S P I C Y (but P and C are good, Y is vowel)
- S L I C E (but E is already ruled out)
- S P I D E (E out)
- S L I D E (E out)

Best choice seems ""SPICY"":
- S in 1 (✓)
- P (new consonant)
- I in 3 (✓)
- C (new consonant)
- Y (new vowel)

This tests P, C, Y while keeping S and I in their correct spots.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
1. Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.
2. Contains S somewhere other than position 4.
3. Has 5 letters, no repeats of A, R, O, E.

Good letters to test next: common consonants and vowels we haven’t tried yet. Vowels left: I, U. Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, Y, etc.

A word that uses S in a new position and tests new common letters is “STINT”:
- S in position 1 (new position).
- T and N are common letters not yet tested.
- I is a new vowel.
- Second T is okay since we don’t know if T repeats yet.

This should give us info on S’s correct position and test T, N, I.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STINT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) I(✓) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on STINT:
- S is in the word AND in the correct first position (✓).
- I is in the word AND in the correct third position (✓).
- T, N, and the second T are NOT in the word (x).

So far we know:
1. Word pattern: S _ I _ _
2. Letters not in the word: A, R, O, E, T, N
3. Still need to test common remaining consonants and vowels: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

We need two more letters for positions 2 and 4-5. Common remaining vowels: U, Y. Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P.

A good next guess should:
- Keep S in position 1 and I in position 3.
- Use new letters for positions 2, 4, 5.
- Prefer common letters to maximize information.

Possible candidates:
- S C I D Y (but Y is a vowel here, and D is common)
- S P I C Y (but P and C are good, Y is vowel)
- S L I C E (but E is already ruled out)
- S P I D E (E out)
- S L I D E (E out)

Best choice seems ""SPICY"":
- S in 1 (✓)
- P (new consonant)
- I in 3 (✓)
- C (new consonant)
- Y (new vowel)

This tests P, C, Y while keeping S and I in their correct spots.

Current constraints:
- Word pattern: S _ I _ _
- Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, E, T, N, P, C, Y
- Still need letters for positions 2, 4, 5 from remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with:
S _ I _ _
using only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- S M I L E → E is out
- S L I D E → E is out
- S H I L D → H, L, D are allowed
- S H I V E → E is out
- S L I V E → E is out
- S M I L K → K is allowed, but we have no info on K yet
- S H I L K → K is allowed
- S M I L K is a valid word but K hasn't been tested
- S H I L D is also valid

Between these, ""SHILD"" is a valid word (though less common), but ""SHILD"" is not a standard English word. ""SMITH"" is invalid because T is out. ""SHILD"" is not valid. 

Wait, let's list valid English words:
- S M I L K (valid)
- S H I L K (valid)
- S M I L E (invalid)
- S L I D E (invalid)
- S H I L D (invalid)
- S L I V E (invalid)

The only valid remaining common words are S M I L K and S H I L K. Between these, ""SMITH"" is invalid due to T, so ""SMITH"" is out. 

""SMILK"" is a valid word (a noun meaning milk) and uses S, M, I, L, K. All letters are allowed. 

Therefore, the best next guess is ""SMILK"".

Current constraints:
- Pattern: S _ I L _
- Letters ruled out so far: A, R, O, E, T, N, P, C, Y, M, K
- Letters still allowed: B, D, F, G, H, J, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (plus any others not yet tested)

Positions left to fill: 2 and 5.

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form S _ I L _.

Possible candidates:
- S H I L K → K is out
- S H I L D → H, D are allowed
- S H I L B → B is allowed
- S D I L B → Doesn't fit pattern
- S H I L F → F is allowed
- S H I L G → G is allowed
- S H I L U → U is allowed
- S H I L V → V is allowed
- S H I L W → W is allowed
- S H I L X → X is allowed
- S H I L Z → Z is allowed

Among these, ""SHILD"" is not a standard word, ""SHILB"" is not a word, etc. The valid English word that fits is ""SHILD"" (archaic) but is not commonly accepted. The next valid word is ""SHILK"" but K is out. 

Actually, let's list all valid 5-letter English words matching S _ I L _:
- SHILD (archaic)
- SHILL (but L is already in position 4, so SHILL would be S H I L L, but we don't know about double L)
- S H I L D is not a word
- S H I L F is not a word
- S H I L G is not a word
- S H I L U is not a word
- S H I L V is not a word
- S H I L W is not a word
- S H I L X is not a word
- S H I L Z is not a word

The only valid English word left is ""SHILL"" (S H I L L), but we don't know if L repeats. However, since L is already confirmed in position 4, ""SHILL"" would place L in position 5 as well. 

But ""SHILL"" is a valid word. Let's check:
- S (✓) H (new) I (✓) L (✓) L (new)

But we don't have info on double L. However, given the constraints, ""SHILL"" is the only valid word left. 

Wait, another word: ""SPLIT"" but T is out. ""SHIVE"" but E is out. ""SHIVE"" is invalid. 

Actually, let's think differently: the pattern is S _ I L _. The only valid word that fits is ""SHILL"" (S H I L L). 

Therefore, the next guess is ""SHILL"".
