### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following information from previous feedback:

- Secret word length: 5 letters.
- Excluded letters (not in the word at all): C, R, A, E, M, O, D, Y.
- Confirmed letters:
  * S is correct in position 1.
  * U is correct in position 3.
  * N is in the word but not in positions 3, 4, or 4 (from earlier feedback). Therefore N can only be in position 2 or 5.
- No other letters have been confirmed.

Thus the pattern is:

1 S 2 ? 3 U 4 ? 5 ?

with N occupying either position 2 or 5.

A valid English word that fits this pattern and uses only allowed letters is **SNUGG**:
- S in position 1 (matches known S).
- N in position 2 (places N where it can be).
- U in position 3 (matches known U).
- G in position 4 (a new letter to test).
- G in position 5 (another test of G).

This guess respects all constraints and introduces a new letter (G) for further narrowing.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E) which will give useful information about the secret word’s letters and positions.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, and E are not in the secret word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (the fourth letter of CRANE).

Thus the next guess must include N in a different position (1, 2, 3, or 5) and avoid C, R, A, E. I’ll choose a common word that satisfies these constraints: **MOUND** (M‑O‑U‑N‑D). This places N at position 4, which is allowed, and introduces new letters to test.

We know from previous feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, E, M, O, D are not in the secret word.
- Letter U is correct in position 3.
- Letter N is in the word but not in positions 3 (from second guess) or 4 (from first guess). Therefore N can be in position 1, 2, or 5.
We need a new 5‑letter word with U at the third spot, containing N in one of the allowed positions, and avoiding the excluded letters. “SUNNY” fits: S U N N Y, with U at position 3 and N at positions 3 and 4 (both allowed). It also introduces new letters S and Y for further testing.
