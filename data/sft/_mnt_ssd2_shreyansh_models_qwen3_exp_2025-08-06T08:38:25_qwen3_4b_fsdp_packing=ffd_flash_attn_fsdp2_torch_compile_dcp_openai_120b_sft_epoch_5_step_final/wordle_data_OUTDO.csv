### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial guess that is a common five‑letter English word. A good opening guess is “CRANE” because it contains a mix of common consonants and vowels, which will give useful information about the secret word’s letters and positions.

The first guess “CRANE” showed that none of its letters (C, R, A, N, E) appear in the secret word. Therefore, the next guess must avoid those letters entirely. I’ll choose a common five‑letter word using different letters. “GHOST” contains G, H, O, S, T, none of which were ruled out, so it’s a valid next guess.

We know from previous feedback:

“BUTOM” (B U T O M) satisfies:
- Contains O (4th) and T (3rd), avoiding their forbidden spots.
- Uses only new letters B, U, M besides O and T, none of which have been eliminated.

We have the following confirmed information:

- U is correct in position 2.
- T is correct in position 3.
- O is in the word but not in position 4 (from BUTOM) and not in position 3 (from GHOST). The remaining possible positions for O are 1 or 5.

Thus the pattern is: _ U T _ _.  
O must be either at position 1 or position 5.  
We need a valid English word fitting the pattern that does not use any eliminated letters.

The word **OUTDO** fits:
