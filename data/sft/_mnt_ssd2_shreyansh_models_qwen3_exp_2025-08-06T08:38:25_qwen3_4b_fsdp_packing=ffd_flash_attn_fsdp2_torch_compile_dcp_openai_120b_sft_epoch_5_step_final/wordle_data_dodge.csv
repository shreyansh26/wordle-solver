### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the secret word ends with E (position 5 is correct). The letters C, R, A, N are not in the word at all. For the next guess we should keep E in the fifth position and choose new letters that haven't been ruled out. A good candidate is **SLIDE** (S L I D E), which introduces four fresh letters while keeping E fixed.

We have the following feedback:

- Position 1: D is correct (✓).
- Position 2: O is correct (✓).
- Position 3: V is not in the word (x).
- Position 4: E is not in the word (‑) – meaning E exists elsewhere, but not at position 4. Since we already know E is at position 5, this just confirms that.
- Position 5: Y is not in the word (x).

Thus the secret word must be of the form **D O _ _ E**, with the third and fourth letters not being V or Y. All previously eliminated letters are C, R, A, N, S, L, I, V, Y. We need a valid English word that fits the pattern.
