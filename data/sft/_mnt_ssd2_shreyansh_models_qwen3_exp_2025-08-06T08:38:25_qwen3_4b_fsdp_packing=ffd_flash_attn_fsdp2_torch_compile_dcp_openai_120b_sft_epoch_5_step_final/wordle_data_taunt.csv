### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters. ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it includes frequently used letters C, R, A, N, and E.

We know:
- N is correct in position 4.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- C, R, E are not in the word.

We need a new 5‑letter word with N at the fourth slot, containing A elsewhere (not third), and avoiding C, R, E.  
A good candidate is **BALMY** (B A L M Y): N is fourth, A is second, and none of the excluded letters appear.

We have the following feedback:
- From CRANE: N is correct in position 4; A is in the word but not in position 3; C, R, E are not in the word.
- From BALMY: A is correct in position 2; B, L, M, Y are not in the word.

Thus the secret word pattern is: _ A _ N _.  
Letters that cannot appear: C, R, E, B, L, M, Y.  
We need a common 5‑letter word fitting the pattern without using any forbidden letters.

Possible candidates include:
- HAZON (H A Z O N) – fits the pattern, uses only new letters H, Z, O.
- PAINT (P A I N T) – also fits, but contains T which we have no info about yet; both are valid.

Choosing HAZON introduces three new letters (H, Z, O) that we have not tested, giving us more information for the next round.

- Position 4 is definitely **N** (confirmed by CRANE, PAINd, and STANK).

- Letter **S**, **P**, **D**, **K**, **C**, **R**, **E**, **B**, **L**, **M**, **Y**, **H**, **Z**, **O**, **I** are not in the word (all marked “x”).

Thus the secret word fits the pattern: _ A _ N _.  
We need to place **T** somewhere other than position 2, and introduce new letters to test remaining possibilities.

A good candidate is **TANGN** (T A N G N):

- A and N are already confirmed in the correct spots.
- G is a new letter to test.
- The second N at position 5 is allowed and will give information about duplicate Ns.
