### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following information from feedback:

- Secret word length 5.
- Letters confirmed in the word: **R**, **E**, **O**.
- Positions confirmed:
  * **E** is correct at position 4.
  * **R** is correct at position 5.
- **O** is in the word but not at position 2; it can be at position 1 or 3.
- Letters known NOT in the word: **C**, **A**, **N**, **V**.

Thus the pattern is: _ _ _ E R, with **O** occupying either the 1st or 3rd slot.

A word that satisfies all constraints and introduces new letters is **MOVER**:
- M (new letter, not excluded) at position 1.
- O at position 3 (allowed, since O isn’t at position 2).
- V is not allowed, but V is at position 4 in “MOVER” – actually, V is not in the secret word, so this guess will give an “x” for V, which we already know.
- E at position 4 and R at position 5 match the confirmed letters.

This guess will test the remaining unknown letters (M) and confirm the placement of O.

We know from the feedback:
- C, A, N are not in the secret word.
- R and E are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in “CRANE” (R is not 2nd, E is not 5th).

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R and E in different positions, avoids C, A, N, and introduces new letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is **ROVER**:
- Contains R (positions 1 and 5) – none of which conflict with the known position restrictions.
- Contains E at position 4, which is allowed (E was only ruled out from position 5).
- Introduces new letters O and V to test additional possibilities.

We have the following information from feedback:

- Secret word length 5.
- Letters confirmed in the word: **R**, **E**, **O**.
- Positions confirmed:
  * **E** is correct at position 4.
  * **R** is correct at position 5.
- **O** is in the word but not at position 2; it can be at position 1 or 3.
- Letters known NOT in the word: **C**, **A**, **N**, **V**.

Thus the pattern is: _ _ _ E R, with **O** occupying either the 1st or 3rd slot.

A word that satisfies all constraints and introduces new letters is **MOVER**:
- M (new letter, not excluded) at position 1.
- O at position 3 (allowed, since O isn’t at position 2).
- V is not allowed, but V is at position 4 in “MOVER” – actually, V is not in the secret word, so this guess will give an “x” for V, which we already know.
- E at position 4 and R at position 5 match the confirmed letters.

This guess will test the remaining unknown letters (M) and confirm the placement of O.

We have the following confirmed information:

- Position 5 = R (✓)
- Letter O is in the word but not at positions 2 or 3 (both gave “-”). So O must be at position 1.
Thus the word pattern is **O _ _ E R**.

Letters known not to be in the word: C, A, N, V, M, and also the letters that received “x” in earlier guesses: C, A, N, V, M.

We need a common English word fitting O??ER without using any excluded letters. “OPIER” (a surname) fits: O‑P‑I‑E‑R, uses only allowed letters. It also introduces two new letters (P and I) to test.

So the next guess will be “OPIER”.
