### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Letters C, R, A, N, E, G, H, O are not in the secret word.
- Letters S and T are in the word but not in positions 4 (S) and 5 (T) from the guess GHOST.

Thus S cannot be 4th, T cannot be 5th. We need a 5‑letter word using only allowed letters (B, D, F, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z) that includes S and T in permissible spots.

The word “STUMP” fits:
- S is 1st (allowed)
- T is 2nd (allowed, not 5th)
- U, M, P are from the allowed set.
All letters are unused in prior guesses, so it’s a valid next guess.

We have the following information:

- Letters not in the word (marked x): C, R, A, N, E, G, H, O, M, P, U.
- Letters in the word (marked -): S, T, and another letter (U was marked x in the latest guess, so only S and T are confirmed).
- Position constraints:
  * S is in the word but not in positions 1 (from STUMP) or 4 (from GHOST). So S can be in positions 2, 3, or 5.
  * T is in the word but not in positions 2 (from STUMP) or 5 (from GHOST). So T can be in positions 1, 3, or 4.
  * The third “-” in guess 3 was U, which we know is not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word that contains both S and T, respects those position limits, and uses only letters that have not been ruled out.

The word **BLAST** fits all conditions:
- B, L, A, S, T are the letters.
- A is already known to be absent, so this seems problematic.
- Wait, actually A was marked x in the first guess, so BLAST cannot be used.

Trying another candidate that avoids all excluded letters, we find **STIFF**:
- Contains S (position 1) – allowed.
- Contains T (position 2) – allowed (T is not prohibited from position 2).
- Remaining letters I, F are not among the excluded set.

Thus **STIFF** satisfies all constraints and is a valid next guess.

I need to start the game with a valid 5‑letter English word. A good opening guess is a common word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to gather useful information. “CRANE” includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), which should give a broad spread of feedback.

The feedback from the first guess “CRANE” showed that none of its letters (C, R, A, N, E) are present in the secret word. Therefore, the next guess must avoid all of those letters. I’ll choose a common five‑letter word composed of different letters. “GHOST” uses G, H, O, S, T, none of which have been ruled out yet, so it’s a good candidate for the next guess.

- S cannot be in positions 1,4 (from GHOST and STIFF) → possible positions 2,3,5.
- T cannot be in positions 2,5 (from GHOST and STUCK) → possible positions 1,3,4.
- U cannot be in position 3 (from STUMP) → possible positions 1,2,4,5.

We need a 5‑letter word containing S, T, U and two other letters that are not excluded (C,R,A,N,E,G,H,O,M,P,I,F,K). The word **STUDD** fits:
- S at position 1 (allowed),
- T at position 2 (allowed),
- U at position 3 (allowed, U is not prohibited from this spot),
- D at positions 4 and 5 (D is not excluded).

Thus STUDD satisfies all constraints and is a valid guess.",Guess 6: STUDD -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) U(-) D(x) D(x),FAIL
