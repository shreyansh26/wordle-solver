### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback:

- From CRANE: C, A, N are not in the word. R and E are in the word but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.

  * R at position 1 is wrong → R is in the word but not at position 1.
  * O at position 2 is correct → O is fixed at position 2.
  * V is not in the word.
  * E at position 4 is correct → E is fixed at position 4.
  * R at position 5 is correct → R is also at position 5.

Thus the secret word pattern is: _ O _ E R.

Letters already placed: O (2), E (4), R (5). Excluded letters: C, A, N, V.  
We need a valid English word matching the pattern and using new letters for positions 1 and 3.

Possible candidates include **FORCE** (F O R C E) and **GORES** (G O R E S). Both satisfy the pattern and avoid excluded letters. I will guess **FORCE** to test F and C.

We know from the first guess CRANE that:
- C, A, N are not in the secret word.
- R and E are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in CRANE (R not in position 2, E not in position 5).

We need a new five‑letter word that includes R and E in different positions, and avoids C, A, N. A good candidate is **ROVER**:
- Contains R (positions 1 and 5) and E (position 4), satisfying the placement constraints.
- Uses only allowed letters (O, V are new and not ruled out).
Thus we will guess ROVER.

We have the following feedback:

- From CRANE: C, A, N are not in the word. R and E are in the word but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.
- From ROVER: 
  * R at position 1 is wrong → R is in the word but not at position 1.
  * O at position 2 is correct → O is fixed at position 2.
  * V is not in the word.
  * E at position 4 is correct → E is fixed at position 4.
  * R at position 5 is correct → R is also at position 5.

Thus the secret word pattern is: _ O _ E R.

Letters already placed: O (2), E (4), R (5). Excluded letters: C, A, N, V.  
We need a valid English word matching the pattern and using new letters for positions 1 and 3.

Possible candidates include **FORCE** (F O R C E) and **GORES** (G O R E S). Both satisfy the pattern and avoid excluded letters. I will guess **FORCE** to test F and C.

- From FORCE: F and C are not in the word; O (position 2) and E (position 4) remain correct; the R at position 3 is wrong.

Thus the secret word pattern is: _ O _ E R.

Letters that cannot be used: A, C, F, N, V, and also the R that was guessed at positions 1 and 3 (but R is already known to be at position 5).  

We need a valid English word matching the pattern with new letters for positions 1 and 3.  
The word **GORES** fits perfectly:
- G O R E S → matches _ O _ E R,
- Uses letters G and S which have not been ruled out,
- Contains the required R at position 3 (which is allowed, as only the R at position 5 is fixed).

Therefore the next guess is GORES.

We have determined the pattern is _ O _ E R based on feedback:

We have the following feedback:

- From CRANE: C, A, N are not in the word. R and E are in the word but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.

  * V is not in the word.
  * E at position 4 is correct → E is fixed at position 4.
  * R at position 5 is correct → R is also at position 5.

Thus the secret word pattern is: _ O _ E R.
