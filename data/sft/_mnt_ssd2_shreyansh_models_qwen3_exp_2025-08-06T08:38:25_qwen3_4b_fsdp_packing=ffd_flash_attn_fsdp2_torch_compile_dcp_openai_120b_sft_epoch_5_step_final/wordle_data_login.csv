### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

We have the following information from previous guesses:

- Letters C, R, A, E, B, U, T, S, H, and also the letter N are not in the word.
- The letter G is correct and in the third position (G✓).
- N is in the word but not in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from the three “-” marks). Therefore N must be in position 2 or 5.
- I is in the word but not in position 2, so I can be in positions 1, 4, or 5.

We need a five‑letter word with G at the third spot, containing N (pos2 or pos5) and I (pos1, pos4, or pos5), using only letters that have not been ruled out.

A suitable candidate is **MIGON**:
- Pattern: M I G O N → G is at position 3.
- I is at position 2 (allowed, since I just can’t be position 2? Wait, no: the feedback from NIGHT showed I(-) meaning I is in the word but not at position 2. Therefore I cannot be at position 2. So MIGON places I at position 2, which violates that rule.

Oops, that’s a mistake. Let’s try a different word that satisfies all constraints.

How about **WINGO**?
- Positions: W (1), I (2), N (3), G (4), O (5)
- G is not at position 3, so it doesn’t match the known G✓.
- N is at position 3, which we know is invalid.
- I is at position 2, which is forbidden.

So WINGO is not acceptable.

We need a word with G at position 3, N at position 5 (since N cannot be 1,2,3,4), and I at position 1 or 4.

The word **DINGO** fits:
- D I N G O → position 3 is G (correct).
- N is at position 3, but wait that’s not allowed (N cannot be in positions 1‑4). So DINGO is invalid.

Another option is **KIGAN** (K I G A N):
- G is at position 3 (correct).
- N is at position 5 (allowed).
- I is at position 2 (not allowed, I cannot be in position 2).
Thus still invalid.

What about **KIGLY** (K I G L Y)? G is correct at position 3, I is at position 2 (still forbidden), so no.

We need I to be in position 1, 4, or 5 (but not 2). If we put I at position 1, the pattern becomes I _ G _ _. With N at position 5, it becomes I _ G _ N. A common English word that fits is **IGGYN** (I‑G‑G‑Y‑N). This respects all constraints:
- G is at position 3.
- N is at position 5 (not 1‑4).
- I is at position 1 (not position 2).
- All other letters (G, Y) have not been ruled out.

Thus IGGYN is a valid next guess.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes the vowel A and the common consonants C, R, N, and E, giving useful information about the secret word’s letters and positions.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
We know from the first guess CRANE that letters C, R, A, and E are not in the secret word. The letter N is in the word but not in position 4 (the position it occupied in CRANE). Therefore our next guess must include N in a different position and avoid C, R, A, E. A good candidate is “BUNTS”, which places N in the third position and introduces new letters B, U, T, S for further information.

We have two guesses:
1. CRANE → C, R, A, E are not in the word; N is present but not in position 4.
2. BUNTS → B, U, T, S are not in the word; N is present but also not in position 3.

Thus N cannot be in positions 3 or 4, and cannot be any of C,R,A,E,B,U,T,S. The remaining letters for N are limited, but we can choose a word that includes N in a new position (e.g., position 1) and uses only letters not yet ruled out. “NIGHT” places N at the start and introduces I, G, H, T. T is already known to be absent, but we’ll still test the other letters. This will give us more information about the remaining unknown letters.

We have the following information from previous guesses:

- Letters C, R, A, E, B, U, T, S, H, and also the letter N are not in the word.
- The letter G is correct and in the third position (G✓).
- N is in the word but not in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from the three “-” marks). Therefore N must be in position 2 or 5.
- I is in the word but not in position 2, so I can be in positions 1, 4, or 5.

We need a five‑letter word with G at the third spot, containing N (pos2 or pos5) and I (pos1, pos4, or pos5), using only letters that have not been ruled out.

A suitable candidate is **MIGON**:
- Pattern: M I G O N → G is at position 3.
- I is at position 2 (allowed, since I just can’t be position 2? Wait, no: the feedback from NIGHT showed I(-) meaning I is in the word but not at position 2. Therefore I cannot be at position 2. So MIGON places I at position 2, which violates that rule.

Oops, that’s a mistake. Let’s try a different word that satisfies all constraints.

How about **WINGO**?
- Positions: W (1), I (2), N (3), G (4), O (5)
- G is not at position 3, so it doesn’t match the known G✓.
- N is at position 3, which we know is invalid.
- I is at position 2, which is forbidden.

So WINGO is not acceptable.

We need a word with G at position 3, N at position 5 (since N cannot be 1,2,3,4), and I at position 1 or 4.

The word **DINGO** fits:
- D I N G O → position 3 is G (correct).
- N is at position 3, but wait that’s not allowed (N cannot be in positions 1‑4). So DINGO is invalid.

Another option is **KIGAN** (K I G A N):
- G is at position 3 (correct).
- N is at position 5 (allowed).
- I is at position 2 (not allowed, I cannot be in position 2).
Thus still invalid.

What about **KIGLY** (K I G L Y)? G is correct at position 3, I is at position 2 (still forbidden), so no.

We need I to be in position 1, 4, or 5 (but not 2). If we put I at position 1, the pattern becomes I _ G _ _. With N at position 5, it becomes I _ G _ N. A common English word that fits is **IGGYN** (I‑G‑G‑Y‑N). This respects all constraints:
- G is at position 3.
- N is at position 5 (not 1‑4).
- I is at position 1 (not position 2).
- All other letters (G, Y) have not been ruled out.

Thus IGGYN is a valid next guess.

- I is in the word but not at positions 1 or 2, so it must be at position 4.

Let’s try a different word that satisfies all constraints.\n\nHow about **WINGO**?\n- Positions: W (1), I (2), N (3), G (4), O (5)\n- G is not at position 3, so it doesn’t match the known G✓.\n- N is at position 3, which we know is invalid.\n- I is at position 2, which is forbidden.\n\nSo WINGO is not acceptable.\n\nWe need a word with G at position 3, N at position 5 (since N cannot be 1,2,3,4), and I at position 1 or 4.\n\nThe word **DINGO** fits:\n- D I N G O → position 3 is G (correct).\n- N is at position 3, but wait that’s not allowed (N cannot be in positions 1‑4). So DINGO is invalid.\n\nAnother option is **KIGAN** (K I G A N):\n- G is at position 3 (correct).\n- N is at position 5 (allowed).\n- I is at position 2 (not allowed, I cannot be in position 2).\nThus still invalid.\n\nWhat about **KIGLY** (K I G L Y)? G is correct at position 3, I is at position 2 (still forbidden), so no.\n\nWe need I to be in position 1, 4, or 5 (but not 2). If we put I at position 1, the pattern becomes I _ G _ _. With N at position 5, it becomes I _ G _ N. A common English word that fits is **IGGYN** (I‑G‑G‑Y‑N). This respects all constraints:\n- G is at position 3.\n- N is at position 5 (not 1‑4).\n- I is at position 1 (not position 2).\n- All other letters (G, Y) have not been ruled out.\n\nThus IGGYN is a valid next guess.\n\n<guess>IGGYN</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: BUNTS -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(x) N(-) T(x) S(x)\nGuess 3: NIGHT -> FEEDBACK: N(-) I(-) G(✓) H(x) T(x)\nGuess 4: IGGYN -> FEEDBACK: I(-) G(-) G(✓) Y(x) N(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback:\n- G is correct at position 3.\n- N is correct at position 5.\n- I is in the word but not at positions 1 or 2, so it must be at position 4.\n- The second G (from IGGYN) was marked “-”, meaning the letter G appears elsewhere, but we already have G at position\u202f3, so the extra G may be a duplicate and we’ll treat it as a single G.\nThus the word pattern is _ _ G I N.\n\nA common English word fitting this pattern and using only letters not yet ruled out is **SUGIN** (S‑U‑G‑I‑N).

We have determined the pattern _ _ G I N with the third, fourth, and fifth letters fixed as G, I, N. The first two letters must be letters not yet ruled out. The feedback tells us that S, U, B, R, A, E, T, H, Y, C are not in the word. The remaining plausible letters for the first two positions are P, D, K, L, M, O, V, W, X, Z, etc. A common English word fitting the pattern is **P O G I N** (a slang term for a person with a high IQ). Both P and O have not been excluded, so this guess will test the remaining possibilities.
