### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Letters that are in the word but not in the guessed positions:
  * A – not in positions 1, 2, or 3 → A can be in position 4 or 5.
  * R – not in positions 1 or 2 → R can be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
  * O – not in positions 3 or 5 → O can be in positions 1, 2, or 4.
- We need a 5‑letter English word containing A, R, and O, respecting those position constraints, plus two other letters that are not excluded.

The word **AROMA** satisfies all conditions:
- A is in positions 2 and 5 (both allowed, not 1‑3).
- R is in position 3 (allowed, not 1 or 2).
- O is in position 4 (allowed, not 3 or 5).
- The remaining letters are M and A, which are not excluded.

Thus AROMA is a valid next guess.

We have gathered feedback from four guesses:

1. **CRANE** → C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)  
   → C, N, E are not in the word. R is in the word but not in position 2. A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. **RATIO** → R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(-)  
   → T, I are not in the word. R is in the word but not in position 1. A is in the word but not in position 2. O is in the word but not in position 5.

3. **ALLOY** → A(-) L(-) L(-) O(-) Y(x)  
   → Y is not in the word. A is in the word but not in position 1. L is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3. O is in the word but not in position 4.

4. **AROMA** → A(-) R(-) O(-) M(-) A(-)  
   → M is in the word but not in position 4. A is in the word but not in positions 1 or 5. R is in the word but not in position 2. O is in the word but not in position 3.

---

### Consolidated Constraints:
- **Letters confirmed present**: A, R, O, L, M.
- **Positions**:
  * A cannot be in positions 1,2,3,5 → **A must be in position 4**.
  * R cannot be in positions 1 or 2 → **R can be in 3,4,5**; but position 4 is A, so R ∈ {3,5}.
  * O cannot be in positions 3 or 5 → **O can be in 1,2,4**; position 4 is A, so O ∈ {1,2}.
  * L cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → **L can be in 1,4,5**; position 4 is A, so L ∈ {1,5}.
  * M cannot be in position 4 → already satisfied; also not in position 4, so M can be in 1,2,3,5.

### Trying a Word That Fits All Constraints:
The pattern **_ O _ A _** satisfies:
- O in position 2 (allowed).
- A in position 4 (required).
- Positions 1,3,5 are still open for L, R, M.

The word **MOLAR** fits perfectly:
- M 1 (allowed, not position 4)
- O 2 (allowed)
- L 3 (allowed, L not in 2 or 3)
- A 4 (required)
- R 5 (allowed, R not in 1 or 2)

All letters are from the confirmed set, and every position respects the earlier clues.

Thus the next guess should be **MOLAR**.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

We know from the feedback:

- R and A are in the word but not in the positions they were guessed (R not in position 2, A not in position 3).

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R and A in different positions, and avoids C, N, E. “RATIO” fits: it contains R (position 1) and A (position 2), and uses only letters not ruled out.

We need a 5‑letter word containing R, A, O plus two other letters, respecting those position constraints.

- O is in position 3 (allowed, not position 5).
- L is another filler letter.
- Y is another filler letter.

All excluded letters (C, N, E, T, I) are avoided. Thus ALLOY is a valid next guess.

We have the following confirmed information from the feedback:

- Position 1: M is correct (✓).
- Position 2: O is correct (✓).
- Position 4: A is correct (✓).
- Letter L is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from ALLOY and MOLAR). Therefore L must be in position 5.
- Letter R is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 5 (from AROMA and MOLAR). The only remaining open slot is position 3.

Thus the word must be **M O R A L**.

We will guess that word.
