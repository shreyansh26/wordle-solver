### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to get useful information. “CRANE” is a good starter: it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and the two most frequent vowels (A, E). This should give a solid baseline for the first feedback.

We know from the feedback:
- C, A, N are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R and E in different positions, avoids C, A, N, and tests new letters.  
“ROVER” fits: it contains R (positions 1 and 5) and E (position 4), respects the position constraints, and introduces O and V for further clues.

We have the following feedback:

- From CRANE: C, A, N are not in the word; R and E are present but in wrong positions.
- From ROVER: O is correct at position 2, E is correct at position 4, R is correct at position 5.  
  The R at position 1 is marked “-”, which is consistent because we already have the correct R at position 5.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern: _ O _ E R.

Letters known to be absent: C, A, N, V.  
We need a common 5‑letter word matching _ O _ E R that does not contain any of those letters.

“POWER” fits perfectly:
- P O W E R → positions 1‑5 are P O W E R.
- O is at position 2, E at 4, R at 5 – matching the confirmed letters.
- P and W have not been ruled out yet.
- No forbidden letters appear.

Therefore the next guess should be “POWER”.
