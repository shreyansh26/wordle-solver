### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback that the secret word does not contain C, R, or A. It does contain N and E, but N is not in position 4 and E is not in position 5 (their positions in “CRANE”). Therefore, we need a new 5‑letter word that includes N and E in different positions, avoids C, R, A, and introduces new letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is **SLENT**:
- N is now in position 5 (different from position 4).
- E is now in position 3 (different from position 5).
- It adds the letters S, L, and T for further clues.

We have the following feedback:

- From guess 1 (CRANE): C, R, A are not in the word; N and E are in the word but in wrong positions.
- From guess 2 (SLENT): S is correct in position 1; E is correct in position 3; N is in the word but not in position 5; L and T are not in the word.

Thus the secret word must be of the form **S _ E _ _**, contain an N somewhere other than position 5 (so position 2 or 4), and must avoid the letters C, R, A, L, T.

A common English word that satisfies all these constraints is **SHEEN**:
- S in position 1 (✓)
- E in position 3 (✓)
- N in position 4 (allowed, not position 5)
- No prohibited letters appear.

Therefore the next guess should be “SHEEN”.
