### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the secret word pattern from feedback:
- Position 1: G (correct)
- Position 4: E (correct)
- Positions 2, 3, 5 are unknown.
Letters ruled out so far: C,R,A,N,S,L,P,T,B,U,M,I,V,N (and also the letters from previous guesses). Remaining possible letters include D, F, H, J, K, O, Q, W, X, Y, Z, plus any not yet tested.

We need a valid English word of the form G _ _ E _. A common candidate is **GOUGE** (G‑O‑U‑G‑E). This uses only allowed letters (O, U, G) and fits the pattern. It will test three new letters (O, U, G) and confirm the known positions.

Thus the next guess is GOUGE.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a valid 5‑letter English word. A good opening guess is a word that contains common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to gather information. ""CRANE"" is a popular starter word for this reason.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the first guess CRANE we learned:
- C, R, A, N are not in the secret word.
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So the next guess must avoid C, R, A, N, and place E somewhere other than the last slot. Choosing a common word with new letters will give more information. “SLEPT” fits: it contains E in the 3rd position and introduces S, L, P, T, none of which have been ruled out.

We know from previous feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, S, L, P, T are not in the secret word.
- Letter E is in the word but not in positions 3 (from guess2) nor 5 (from guess1). So E must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
We need a new 5‑letter word that includes E in one of those allowed spots and uses only letters not yet ruled out. “BEGUM” places E at position 2 and introduces B, G, U, M, all of which are still possible.

We have the following feedback:

- Letter E is in the word but not in positions 2, 3, or 5 → E must be in position 1 or 4.
- Letter G is in the word but not in position 3 → G can be in positions 1,2,4,5 (but not 3).

We need a 5‑letter word that contains both E and G, respects those position constraints, and uses only letters not ruled out.

The word **GIVEN** fits:
- G is in position 1 (allowed).
- E is in position 4 (allowed).
- The remaining letters I, V, N are not among the excluded letters.

Thus “GIVEN” is a valid next guess.
