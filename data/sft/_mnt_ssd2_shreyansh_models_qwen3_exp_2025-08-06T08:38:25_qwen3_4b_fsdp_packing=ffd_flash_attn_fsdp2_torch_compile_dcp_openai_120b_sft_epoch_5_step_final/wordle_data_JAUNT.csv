### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback:

Thus the secret word must have:
- A at position 2
- N at position 4
- No letters C, R, E, G, I, S anywhere
- The remaining letters (positions 1, 3, 5) must be chosen from other common letters.

A good candidate that fits these constraints is **MANNA** (M A N N A). It uses only allowed letters, places A and N correctly, and introduces new letters (M) to test further.

So the next guess will be MANNA.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: GAINS -> FEEDBACK: G(x) A(✓) I(x) N(✓) S(x)
Guess 3: MANNA -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(✓) N(-) N(✓) A(-)

We have the following feedback:

- From CRANE: N is correct at position 4; A is in the word but not at position 3; C, R, E are not in the word.
- From GAINS: A is correct at position 2; N is correct at position 4; G, I, S are not in the word.
- From MANNA: 
  * Position 1 (M) is not in the word.
  * Position 2 (A) is correct.
  * Position 3 (N) is in the word but not at position 3 → N cannot be at position 3.
  * Position 4 (N) is correct.
  * Position 5 (A) is in the word but not at position 5 → A cannot be at position 5.

Thus the secret word must have:
- A at position 2.
- N at position 4.
- No A at positions 3 or 5.
- No N at position 3.
- Excluded letters: C, R, E, G, I, S, M, plus any letters shown as “x” in earlier guesses.

A common 5‑letter word satisfying all these constraints is **UNWED** (U N W E D). It places A and N correctly, avoids all excluded letters, and respects the position restrictions.

So the next guess will be UNWED.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes frequently used letters C, R, A, N, and E.

We know:
- N is correct at position 4.
- A is in the word but not at position 3.
- C, R, and E are not in the word.

We need a new 5‑letter word with N in the fourth spot, containing A somewhere other than the third position, and avoiding C, R, and E. “GAINS” fits: G A I N S (N is fourth, A is second, and it contains none of the excluded letters).

We have the following feedback:

- From guess 2 (GAINS): G, I, and S are not in the word, A is correct in position 2, N is correct in position 4.

Thus the secret word must have:
- A at position 2
- N at position 4
- No letters C, R, E, G, I, S anywhere
- The remaining letters (positions 1, 3, 5) must be chosen from other common letters.

A good candidate that fits these constraints is **MANNA** (M A N N A). It uses only allowed letters, places A and N correctly, and introduces new letters (M) to test further.

So the next guess will be MANNA.
