### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following information from previous feedback:

- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, L, B, U, I, S.
- Letters that are in the word but misplaced:
  * A is in the word, but not in positions 1, 3, or 5 (it was in positions 1 and 3 in previous guesses and got “-”).
  * M is in the word, but not in positions 2, 4, or 5 (it was in positions 2 and 4 in previous guesses and got “-”).

Thus the remaining possible positions are:
- A can be in position 2 or 4.
- M can be in position 1, 3, or 4 (but not 2,4,5).

We need a new 5‑letter word that contains A and M, respects those position constraints, and uses only letters not yet ruled out.

The word **MADAM** fits perfectly:
- M is at positions 1 and 5 (both allowed for M).
- A is at positions 2 and 4 (both allowed for A).
- The other letters D and the repeated A are not among the excluded letters.

Therefore, the next guess will be “MADAM”.

We have gathered all feedback:

- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, L, B, U, I, S, D.
- A is in the word, confirmed at position 2 (from MADAM feedback). A is not in positions 1,3,4,5.
- M is in the word, not in positions 1,2,4,5 (from previous “-” marks). So M must be at position 3.
- The remaining two letters must be chosen from the unused alphabet (A, M, and letters not ruled out).

Thus the pattern is: _ A M _ _.  
A common English word fitting this pattern and using only allowed letters is **WAMPI** (W A M P I).  
- W, P are not excluded.  
- I is excluded, so this word actually contains an I and is invalid.

Therefore the next guess will be “WAMBY”.

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

We know from the first feedback that the secret word does not contain C, R, N, or E. The letter A is present but not in the third position. Therefore our next guess must include A in a different slot (1,2,4, or 5) and avoid the excluded letters. Choosing a common word with A in a new position and other allowed letters will give us more information.
