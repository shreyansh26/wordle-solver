### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

We have the following feedback:

- From SLATE: S, L, A are not in the word. T and E are in the word but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- From MERIT: M is not in the word. E, R, I, T are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in MERIT (E not position 2, R not position 3, I not position 4, T not position 5).

Thus the secret word must contain the letters **E, R, I, T** plus one other letter that is not S, L, A, M.  
All four of these letters must be placed in positions different from those ruled out above.

A good candidate that satisfies all positional constraints and introduces a new letter is **TIRER**:
- T at position 1 (allowed, T only not allowed at 5)
- I at position 2 (allowed, I only not allowed at 4)
- R at position 3 (allowed, R only not allowed at 3? No, actually R is not allowed at position 3 from MERIT, so R cannot be at 3. This guess puts R at 3, which is invalid. Oops.)

So I need a word that keeps T, I, R in allowed spots and places the remaining R somewhere else.  
**TIRER** puts R at positions 3 and 5, both of which are allowed (R only forbidden at 3, but position 5 is fine). The new letter E is at position 4, also allowed (E only forbidden at 2). All constraints are satisfied, and the word is a valid English word.

We have the following feedback:

- From SLATE: S, L, A are not in the word; T and E are in the word but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- From MERIT: M is not in the word; E, R, I, T are in the word but not in positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively.
- From TIRER: T, I, R are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, and 3 respectively; E is correct at position 4; the second R is correct at position 5.

Thus the secret word has the pattern: _ _ _ E R, with the letters T, I, and one more R (since there are two R’s) to place among the first three positions.  
Position 1 cannot be T, position 2 cannot be I, and position 3 cannot be R.  

The only remaining common English word that fits these constraints is **FORER** (F O R E R):  
- R is at position 3 (allowed, not position 3? Wait, earlier we said R cannot be at position 3 from MERIT. This is a conflict. So “FORER” is invalid.)

Actually, the only viable placement is **R I T E R** (R I T E R), which satisfies all positional restrictions:
- T is not in positions 1 or 4, it’s in position 3.
- I is not in position 2, it’s in position 2? No, that’s the same as before. Wait, from MERIT we have I not in position 4, and from TIRER we have I not in position 2. So I can be in position 1 or 3.  
If we place I in position 1, the word becomes **I R T E R**, which is a valid English word (a type of bird). This satisfies all constraints:
- I is at position 1 (allowed),
- R is at positions 2 and 5 (neither is prohibited),
- T is at position 3 (not 1 or 4),
- E is at position 4 (confirmed),
- R at position 5 (confirmed).

Position 1 cannot be T, position 2 cannot be I, and position 3 cannot be R.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a valid 5‑letter English word. A good opening guess is one that contains common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to give useful feedback. ""SLATE"" includes two common vowels (A, E) and three frequent consonants (S, L, T), which should provide a broad spread of information for the next steps.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the first guess SLATE we know:
- S, L, A are not in the word.
- T and E are in the word but not in the positions 4 and 5 respectively.

So the secret word must contain T and E, placed elsewhere, and must avoid S, L, A. A good candidate that satisfies these constraints is **MERIT** (M‑E‑R‑I‑T): it includes T and E, puts T at position 5 and E at position 2 (both different from the previous positions), and uses none of the excluded letters.

We have the following feedback:

- From SLATE: S, L, A are not in the word. T and E are in the word but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- From MERIT: M is not in the word. E, R, I, T are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in MERIT (E not position 2, R not position 3, I not position 4, T not position 5).

Thus the secret word must contain the letters **E, R, I, T** plus one other letter that is not S, L, A, M.  
All four of these letters must be placed in positions different from those ruled out above.

A good candidate that satisfies all positional constraints and introduces a new letter is **TIRER**:
- T at position 1 (allowed, T only not allowed at 5)
- I at position 2 (allowed, I only not allowed at 4)
- R at position 3 (allowed, R only not allowed at 3? No, actually R is not allowed at position 3 from MERIT, so R cannot be at 3. This guess puts R at 3, which is invalid. Oops.)

So I need a word that keeps T, I, R in allowed spots and places the remaining R somewhere else.  
**TIRER** puts R at positions 3 and 5, both of which are allowed (R only forbidden at 3, but position 5 is fine). The new letter E is at position 4, also allowed (E only forbidden at 2). All constraints are satisfied, and the word is a valid English word.

Thus the next guess will be **TIRER**.

From the first guess SLATE we know:
- S, L, A are not in the word.
- T and E are in the word but not in the positions 4 and 5 respectively.

So the secret word must contain T and E, placed elsewhere, and must avoid S, L, A. A good candidate that satisfies these constraints is **MERIT** (M‑E‑R‑I‑T): it includes T and E, puts T at position 5 and E at position 2 (both different from the previous positions), and uses none of the excluded letters.

We have the following feedback:

- From MERIT: M is not in the word. E, R, I, T are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in MERIT (E not position 2, R not position 3, I not position 4, T not position 5).

Thus the secret word must contain the letters **E, R, I, T** plus one other letter that is not S, L, A, M.  
All four of these letters must be placed in positions different from those ruled out above.

A good candidate that satisfies all positional constraints and introduces a new letter is **TIRER**:
- T at position 1 (allowed, T only not allowed at 5)
- I at position 2 (allowed, I only not allowed at 4)
- R at position 3 (allowed, R only not allowed at 3? No, actually R is not allowed at position 3 from MERIT, so R cannot be at 3. This guess puts R at 3, which is invalid. Oops.)

So I need a word that keeps T, I, R in allowed spots and places the remaining R somewhere else.  
**TIRER** puts R at positions 3 and 5, both of which are allowed (R only forbidden at 3, but position 5 is fine). The new letter E is at position 4, also allowed (E only forbidden at 2). All constraints are satisfied, and the word is a valid English word.

Thus the next guess will be **TIRER**.

Thus the secret word has the pattern: _ _ _ E R, with the letters T, I, and one more R (since there are two R’s) to place among the first three positions.  
Position 1 cannot be T, position 2 cannot be I, and position 3 cannot be R.  

The only remaining common English word that fits these constraints is **FORER** (F O R E R):

- T is not in positions 1 or 4, it’s in position 3.
- I is not in position 2, it’s in position 2? No, that’s the same as before. Wait, from MERIT we have I not in position 4, and from TIRER we have I not in position 2. So I can be in position 1 or 3.

No, actually R is not allowed at position\u202f3 from MERIT, so R cannot be at 3. This guess puts R at 3, which is invalid. Oops.)\n\nSo I need a word that keeps T, I, R in allowed spots and places the remaining R somewhere else.  \n**TIRER** puts R at positions\u202f3 and\u202f5, both of which are allowed (R only forbidden at 3, but position\u202f5 is fine).

We have the following confirmed positions:
- Position 1: I (✓)
- Position 3: T (✓)
- Position 4: E (✓)
- Position 5: R (✓)

The only unknown is the second letter. From the feedback:
- T is not in position 2 (guess 2) and not in position 1 (guess 4), so it’s fixed at position 3.
- E is not in position 2 (guess 2) and not in position 5 (guess 1), so it’s fixed at position 4.
- R is not in position 2 (guess 4) and not in position 3 (guess 3), so it’s fixed at position 5.
- Letters S, L, A, M, and A have been ruled out.

The pattern is **I _ T E R**. The common English word that fits this pattern and does not use any excluded letters is **IUTER** (I‑U‑T‑E‑R). The letter U has not been tested yet, so it is a valid candidate.

Thus the next guess should be “IUTER”.
