### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels. ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E) that will give useful information about the secret word.

We know from the feedback that the letters C, R, A, and N are not in the secret word at all. The letter E is in the word but not in the 5th position. Therefore, our next guess must include E somewhere in positions 1‑4 and must avoid using C, R, A, or N. A good candidate that satisfies these constraints is **DEMIT** (D‑E‑M‑I‑T), which places E in the second position and uses only letters we haven’t ruled out.

We have eliminated letters C, R, A, N, D, I, T. The letters E and M are confirmed in the word but not in the positions they appeared in the guesses:
- E is not in position 5 (from CRANE) and not in position 2 (from DEMIT).
- M is not in position 3 (from DEMIT).

We need a 5‑letter word containing both E and M, respecting those position restrictions, and using only letters not yet ruled out. “SMELT” fits:
- Contains E (position 3) and M (position 2), both allowed.
- Uses letters S, L, T which are not excluded.
Thus it’s a valid next guess.

We have the following feedback:

1. **CRANE** → C, R, A, N are not in the word; E is in the word but not in position 5.
2. **DEMIT** → D, I, T are not in the word; E is in the word but not in position 2; M is in the word but not in position 3.
3. **SMELT** → S, B, U are not in the word; L is in the word but not in position 4; M is in the word but not in position 2; E is in the word but not in position 3.
4. **MOBUE** → M is in the word but not in position 1; O is correct at position 2; B, U are not in the word; E is in the word but not in position 5.
5. **LOOMY** → L is in the word but not in position 1; O is correct at position 2; the second O is in the word but not at position 3; M is in the word but not in position 4; Y is not in the word.

From this we deduce:
- **O** is fixed at position 2.
- **E** cannot be in positions 2, 3, 5, so it must be in position 1 or 4.
- **M** cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, so it must be in position 5.
- **L** cannot be in positions 1 or 4, and position 2 is already O, so L must be in position 3.
- The extra O (the second O in “LOOMY”) is a duplicate O; since O is already at position 2, the only remaining place for another O is position 4.

Thus the word pattern is:

1 ? 2 O 3 L 4 O 5 M

The only common English word that fits this pattern and uses only letters not ruled out is **POLYM** (a type of polymer). It satisfies all positional constraints and introduces a new letter P, which has not been excluded.

Therefore the next guess should be “POLYM”.
