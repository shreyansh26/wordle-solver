### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following constraints from previous feedback:

- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, P, T, S, L.
- Letters that are in the word: A, D, E.
- Position restrictions:
  * A cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 4 → possible positions: 2 or 5.
  * D cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 5 → possible positions: 1 or 3.
  * E cannot be in positions 3, 4, or 5 → possible positions: 1 or 2.

Trying to satisfy all at once, the only viable arrangement is:
- Position 1 = D
- Position 2 = E
- Position 3 = A
- Position 4 = any new letter (not excluded)
- Position 5 = any new letter (not excluded)

Thus the pattern **D E A _ _** works. A common English word fitting this pattern and using only allowed letters is **DEAFY** (D‑E‑A‑F‑Y).

This guess will test the remaining unknown letters F and Y while keeping the known placements correct.

We have the following feedback so far:

- Excluded letters (not in the word): C, R, N, P, T, S, L, F, Y.
- Confirmed letters and positions:
  * E is correct at position 2 (✓).
  * D is in the word but not at positions 1, 2, 5 → D can be at position 3 or 4.
  * A is in the word but not at positions 2, 3, 4 → A can be at position 1 or 5.

Thus the pattern is either **A E D _ _** or **_ E _ D A**.

A common English word that fits the second pattern and uses only allowed letters is **BEIDA** (B E I D A). This places:
- E at position 2 (matches the known ✓).
- D at position 4 (allowed).
- A at position 5 (allowed).
- Introduces new letters B and I, which have not been ruled out.

Therefore, the next guess should be “BEIDA”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess:
- C, R, N are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes A and E in different positions, avoids C, R, N, and tests new letters. “ADEPT” fits: A in position 1, E in position 3, and introduces D, P, T for further clues while respecting the known constraints.
