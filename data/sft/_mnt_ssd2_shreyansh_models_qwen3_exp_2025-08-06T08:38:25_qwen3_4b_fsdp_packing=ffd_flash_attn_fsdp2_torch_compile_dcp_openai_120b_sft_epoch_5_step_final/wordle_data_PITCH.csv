### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have two guesses so far:
1. CRANE → C(-) means C is in the word but not in position 1.
2. SCOUT → C(-) again (C not in position 2), and T(-) means T is in the word but not in position 5.

Thus the secret word must contain **C** and **T**, with:
- C allowed in positions 3‑5 (cannot be 1 or 2).
- T allowed in positions 1‑4 (cannot be 5).

All letters marked “x” (R, A, N, E, S, O, U) are excluded.

A good next guess should:
- Include C and T in permissible positions.
- Introduce new letters to gather more information.
- Avoid the excluded letters.

The word **MIGHT** fits:
- C is at position 3 (allowed).
- T is at position 4 (allowed).
- New letters M, I, G are not among the excluded set.
- No prohibited letters appear.

Therefore, the next guess is “MIGHT”.

We have two guesses so far:
1. CRANE → C(-) means C is in the word but not in position 1.
2. SCOUT → C(-) again (C not in position 2), and T(-) means T is in the word but not in position 5.

Thus the secret word must contain **C** and **T**, with:
- C allowed in positions 3‑5 (cannot be 1 or 2).
- T allowed in positions 1‑4 (cannot be 5).

All letters marked “x” (R, A, N, E, S, O, U) are excluded.

A good next guess should:
- Include C and T in permissible positions.
- Introduce new letters to gather more information.
- Avoid the excluded letters.

The word **MIGHT** fits:
- C is at position 3 (allowed).
- T is at position 4 (allowed).
- New letters M, I, G are not among the excluded set.
- No prohibited letters appear.

Therefore, the next guess is “MIGHT”.

We have the following feedback:

1. CRANE → C(-) → C is in the word but not in position 1.
2. SCOUT → C(-) → C is not in position 2; T(-) → T is in the word but not in position 5.
3. MIGHT → I(✓) → I is correct at position 2; H(-) → H is in the word but not in position 4; T(-) → T is in the word but not in position 5.

Thus far:
- Position 2 = **I**.
- Letters **C, T, H** are in the word.
- Position restrictions:
  * C cannot be 1 or 2 → possible positions 3, 4, 5.
  * T cannot be 5 → possible positions 1, 3, 4.
  * H cannot be 4 → possible positions 1, 3, 5.
- Excluded letters (marked x): R, A, N, E, S, O, U, M, G.

We need a 5‑letter word that:
- Has I at the second slot.
- Contains C, T, and H in allowed positions.
- Uses only allowed letters for the remaining slot.

The word **LIGHT** fits perfectly:
- L I G H T
- I is in position 2 (✓).
- H is in position 4 (not position 4, so H(-) is satisfied).
- T is in position 5 (not position 5, so T(-) is satisfied).
- C is in position 3 (allowed for C).
- All other letters (L, G) are not excluded.

Therefore the next guess should be **LIGHT**.

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

We have determined the following from the feedback:

- Position 2 is **I** (✓ from multiple guesses).
- **C** is correct at position 4 (✓ from guess 5).
- **T** is in the word but not in positions 1,4,5 → must be position 3.
- **H** is in the word but not in positions 4,5 → must be position 1.
- The remaining unknown letter is at position 5 and cannot be any of the eliminated letters (R, A, N, E, S, O, U, M, G, L, K).

Thus the pattern is **H I T C _**. The only common English word fitting this pattern is **HITCH** (with H repeated). The second H has not been ruled out, so this is a valid next guess.

Now we make the guess.
