### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback:

1. **CRANE** → C, R, A are not in the word; N and E are present but in wrong spots.
2. **MENDS** → M, S are not in the word; N, E are present but still in wrong spots; D is present but in wrong spot.
3. **TUNED** → T is not in the word; U is present but in wrong spot; N is present but in wrong spot; E is correct at position 4; D is correct at position 5.

From this we deduce:
- **E** is definitely at position 4.
- **D** is definitely at position 5.
- **U** is in the word but not at position 2 → possible positions 1, 3, 5 (5 already D, so 1 or 3).

- The remaining unknown letter is not any of the eliminated letters (C,R,A,M,S,T).

Putting N at position 1, we have the pattern **N _ _ E D**.

- N at position 1,
- O (a still‑possible letter) at position 2,

- Letters that are in the word: N, E.
- Positional restrictions:
  * N cannot be in positions 3 or 4 → N can be in 1, 2, or 5.
  * E cannot be in positions 2 or 5 → E can be in 1, 3, or 4.
- We need a valid 5‑letter English word containing N and E in allowed spots and using only allowed letters for the remaining three positions.

The word **TUNED** fits:
- Contains N (position 2) and E (position 4), both respecting the restrictions.
- Uses only letters T, U, N, E, D, none of which have been ruled out.
- Is a common English word.

Thus the next guess is “TUNED”.

We have the following feedback:

1. **CRANE** → C, R, A are not in the word; N and E are present but in wrong spots.
2. **MENDS** → M, S are not in the word; N, E are present but still in wrong spots; D is present but in wrong spot.
3. **TUNED** → T is not in the word; U is present but in wrong spot; N is present but in wrong spot; E is correct at position 4; D is correct at position 5.

From this we deduce:
- **E** is definitely at position 4.
- **D** is definitely at position 5.
- **U** is in the word but not at position 2 → possible positions 1, 3, 5 (5 already D, so 1 or 3).
- **N** is in the word but not at positions 2, 3, 4 → possible positions 1 or 5 (5 already D, so N must be at position 1).
- The remaining unknown letter is not any of the eliminated letters (C,R,A,M,S,T).

Putting N at position 1, we have the pattern **N _ _ E D**.  
The word **NOLDE** (an archaic term for “old”) fits:
- N at position 1,
- O (a still‑possible letter) at position 2,
- L at position 3,
- E at position 4,
- D at position 5.

Thus “NOLDE” satisfies all known constraints and is a valid English word.

We have determined the secret word pattern from the last feedback:
- Position 1: U (✓)
- Position 2: N (✓)
- Position 3: unknown, but I is not correct.
- Position 4: E (✓)
- Position 5: D (✓)

Thus the word is **UN?ED**. The only common English word fitting this pattern and not using any eliminated letters is **UNWED** (meaning unmarried). The letter W has not been ruled out, so this is a valid next guess.
