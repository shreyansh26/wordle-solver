### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the following from the feedback:

- N is confirmed at position 3.
- R is confirmed at position 5.
- E is in the word but cannot be in positions 1, 3, 5 → possible positions 2 or 4.
- I is in the word but cannot be in positions 4 or 5 → possible positions 1, 2, or 3 (but position 3 is already N, so positions 1 or 2).
- L, C, A, D, S, T are not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word of the form _ _ N _ R that contains both E and I in the allowed spots.  
The word **INFER** fits perfectly:
- I at position 1 (allowed),
- N at position 2 (allowed, and it matches the known N at position 3? Wait, no—this is a conflict.)

Actually, **INFER** places N at position 2, which contradicts the earlier confirmed N at position 3.  
So we need a word with N third, R fifth, and the other letters respecting the constraints.

A word that satisfies all constraints is **ENRIF**:
- E at position 1 (allowed),
- N at position 2 (allowed),
- R at position 3 (R cannot be at 3, so this is invalid).

Hmm, still a conflict.  
The correct placement is N at position 3 and R at position 5.  
A valid English word that meets all known constraints is **INURY**:
- I at position 1 (allowed),
- N at position 2 (allowed),
- U at position 3 (U is a new letter, not excluded),
- R at position 4 (R is not at 4, so allowed),
- Y at position 5 (R is at 5, allowed).

Thus **INURY** satisfies all the positional restrictions derived from the feedback.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a valid 5‑letter English word. A common opening guess that covers a variety of common letters is **CRANE**. This will give information about the presence and positions of C, R, A, N, and E in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_start|>assistant
From the first feedback:
- C and A are not in the word.
- R, N, and E are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in “CRANE” (positions 2, 4, and 5 respectively).

So the secret word must contain R, N, and E, each in a different position from those three. I’ll choose a word that includes these letters in new positions and avoids C and A. “RENDS” fits: R is at position 1, N at position 2, E at position 3, and introduces D and S for further clues.

We have confirmed that the letter N is correct at position 3. The letters R and E are in the word but not in the positions they appeared in the previous guesses. Specifically:
- R cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
- E cannot be in positions 3 or 5.

A good candidate that satisfies these constraints and keeps N in the third slot is **RELIN** (R‑E‑L‑I‑N). This word respects all known placements and introduces new letters L and I for further clues.

We have confirmed:
- N is correct at position 3.
- R is in the word but not in positions 1,2,3 → possible positions 4 or 5.
- E is in the word but not in positions 3,5 → possible positions 1,2,4.
- I is in the word but not in position 4 → possible positions 1,2,3,5.
- Letters eliminated: C, A, D, S, L.

We need a 5‑letter word with N third, containing R, E, I, respecting those position restrictions, and using a fifth letter not yet ruled out.  
The word **ENTIR** (E N T I R) satisfies all constraints:
- N is third.
- R is fifth (allowed).
- E is first (allowed).
- I is fourth (not fourth previously, so allowed).
- T is a new letter not yet excluded.

Thus, “ENTIR” is a valid next guess.
