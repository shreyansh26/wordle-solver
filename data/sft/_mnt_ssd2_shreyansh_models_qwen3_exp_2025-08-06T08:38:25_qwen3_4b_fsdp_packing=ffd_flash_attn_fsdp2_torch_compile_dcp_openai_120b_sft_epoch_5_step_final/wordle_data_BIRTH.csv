### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have eliminated letters C, A, N, E, S, P, O. The letters R and T are confirmed to be in the word, but not in the positions they occupied in previous guesses:
- R is not in positions 2 or 4.
- T is not in position 5.

We need a five‑letter word using only the remaining letters (B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z) that contains R and T in allowed spots.

The word **RUTHY** fits:
- R is at position 1 (allowed).
- T is at position 3 (allowed, not position 5).
- The other letters U, H, Y are all from the allowed set and have not been ruled out.

Thus “RUTHY” is a valid next guess.

We have the following feedback:

- From SPORT: S, P, O are not in the word; R is still not in position 4; T is in the word but not in position 5.
- From RUTHY: U and Y are not in the word; R is not in position 1; T is not in position 3; H is in the word but not in position 4.

So far we know the secret word must contain the letters **R, T, H** plus two other letters that are not among the eliminated set {C, A, N, E, S, P, O, U, Y}.  

Position constraints:
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 4 → possible positions: 3 or 5.
- T cannot be in positions 3 or 5 → possible positions: 1 or 2.
- H cannot be in position 4.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **THIRK**:
- T is in position 1 (allowed).
- H is in position 2 (allowed, not position 4).
- R is in position 3 (allowed).
- I and K are new letters not yet ruled out.

Thus “THIRK” is a valid next guess.

We know from the first guess CRANE that:
- C, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
- Excludes C, A, N, E.
- Includes R in a different position (1, 3, 4, or 5).

A good candidate is **SPORT**:
- Contains R at position 4 (different from position 2).
- Uses only letters S, P, O, R, T, none of which have been ruled out.
- Is a common English word.

Thus we’ll guess SPORT.

- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, E, S, P, O, U, Y, K, L.
- I is correct at position 2.
- H is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 4 → must be position 3 or 5.
- R is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 → must be position 3 or 5.
- T is in the word but not in positions 1, 3, 5 → must be position 2 or 4, but position 2 is I, so T must be position 4.

Thus far the pattern is: _ I _ T _.  
H and R must occupy the remaining slots (positions 3 and 5). Since H cannot be position 4 and R cannot be position 4, the only way to satisfy all constraints is to place H at position 3 and R at position 5.

The word **DIGHT** fits this pattern (D I G H T) and uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Therefore, the next guess should be “DIGHT”.
