### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback:
- C is not in the word.
- R is correct at position 2.
- A is in the word but not at position 3.
- N is in the word but not at position 4.
- E is not in the word.

So the secret word pattern is: _ R _ _ _.  
It must contain A and N, placed elsewhere.  
A cannot be in slot 3, N cannot be in slot 4.  

A good candidate is **ARSON**:
- A at position 1 (allowed)
- R at position 2 (matches the known correct spot)
- S at position 3 (unknown)
- O at position 4 (unknown)
- N at position 5 (allowed, since N just can’t be at 4)

This guess respects all constraints and introduces new letters (S, O) to test.
