### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback:
- C and A are not in the word.
- R, N, and E are in the word but none are in the positions they occupied in “CRANE”:
  * R cannot be in position 2.
  * N cannot be in position 4.
  * E cannot be in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R, N, and E, avoids C and A, and respects those position constraints.

The word **NERVE** fits:
- Contains N (pos 1, allowed), E (pos 2, allowed), R (pos 3, allowed), V (new letter), E (pos 5, but we already know E exists elsewhere, so this duplicate is fine).
- No C or A.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R, N, and E, avoids C and A, and respects those position constraints.

The word **NERVE** fits:
- Contains N (pos 1, allowed), E (pos 2, allowed), R (pos 3, allowed), V (new letter), E (pos 5, but we already know E exists elsewhere, so this duplicate is fine).
- No C or A.

Thus “NERVE” is a valid next guess.

From the feedback:
- E is correct at position 2 (E✓).
- R is in the word but not at positions 2 or 3 (R‑ from both guesses).
- N is in the word but not at positions 1 or 4 (N‑ from both guesses).
- Letters C, A, V are not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word with pattern _ E _ _ _, containing R and N, respecting the position restrictions, and avoiding C, A, V.

The word **RENDS** fits:
- R at position 1 (allowed, R not prohibited there).
- E at position 2 (matches the confirmed correct spot).
- N at position 3 (allowed, N not prohibited there).
- D and S are new letters not ruled out.

Thus “RENDS” is a valid next guess.

- Positions 4 and 5 are still unknown.

Letters ruled out so far: C, A, V, D, S, and also any letters that received an “x”.  
Possible remaining letters can be any other alphabet letters not excluded.

A common English word that fits the pattern **R E N _ _** and uses only allowed letters is **RENAL** (meaning relating to the kidney). The letters L and A have not been excluded (A was only excluded from position 3, but position 5 is still open). This makes “RENAL” a valid candidate.

Thus the next guess should be “RENAL”.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes a variety of frequent letters (C, R, A, N, E) and will give useful information about which letters are present and their positions.

We know from the feedback:
- C and A are not in the word.
- R, N, and E are in the word but none are in the positions they occupied in “CRANE”:
  * R cannot be in position 2.
  * N cannot be in position 4.
  * E cannot be in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R, N, and E, avoids C and A, and respects those position constraints.

The word **NERVE** fits:
