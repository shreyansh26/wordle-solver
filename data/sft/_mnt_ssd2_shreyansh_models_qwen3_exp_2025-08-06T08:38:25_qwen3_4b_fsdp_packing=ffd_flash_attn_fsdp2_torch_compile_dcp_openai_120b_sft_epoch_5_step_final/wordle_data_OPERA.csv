### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

  * A is not in position 2 (from “RAISE”) nor position 3 (from “CRANE”).
  * E is not in position 4 (from “RAISE”) nor position 5 (from “CRANE”).

Thus the remaining possible positions are:

We know from the feedback:
- C and N are not in the word.
- R, A, and E are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in “CRANE” (positions 2, 3, and 5 respectively).

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R, A, and E in different positions, and avoids C and N.  
A good candidate is **RAISE**:
- R is at position 1 (different from position 2).
- A is at position 2 (different from position 3).
- E is at position 4 (different from position 5).
- No C or N are present.

Thus “RAISE” satisfies all constraints and gives us fresh letters to test.

We have the following information from previous guesses:

- Letters **C, N, I, S** are not in the secret word.
- Letters **R, A, E** are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in the guesses:
  * R is not in position 1 (from “RAISE”) nor position 2 (from “CRANE”).
  * A is not in position 2 (from “RAISE”) nor position 3 (from “CRANE”).
  * E is not in position 4 (from “RAISE”) nor position 5 (from “CRANE”).

Thus the remaining possible positions are:
- R can be in 3 or 5.
- A can be in 1 or 4.
- E can be in 1, 2, or 3 (but not 4 or 5).

A common English word that satisfies all these constraints is **ADDER**:
- A is in position 1 (allowed).
- D is a filler letter (not excluded).
- D is also a filler letter (allowed).
- E is in position 4 (allowed).
- R is in position 5 (allowed).

All letters comply with the known presence and position restrictions, and no forbidden letters are used.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

We have the following information from previous feedback:

- Excluded letters: C, N, I, S, D, G, T.
- Confirmed letters: R, A, E.
- Position constraints:
  * E is confirmed at position 3 (from TREAS feedback).
  * R cannot be in positions 1,2,5 → possible positions 3 or 4. Since position 3 is already E, R must be at position 4.
  * A cannot be in positions 1,2,3,4 → the only remaining slot is position 5.

Thus the secret word must follow the pattern: _ _ E R A.

We need a valid English word matching this pattern using letters not yet excluded. “LIVER” (L I V E R) does not fit because it ends with R but has an extra letter. “WHEAR” (W H E A R) fits the pattern _ _ E A R, not _ _ E R A. “HEERA” (H E E R A) places two E's and also doesn't fit.

The word **HEERA** actually fits the pattern H E E R A, which matches the required positions (E at 3, R at 4, A at 5). The extra E is allowed because we only know E is present; we have no evidence it cannot appear elsewhere. No excluded letters are used, and the pattern is satisfied.

Therefore the next guess should be HEERA.

  * A cannot be in positions 1,2,3,4 → the only remaining slot is position 5.

Thus the secret word must follow the pattern: _ _ E R A.

We need a valid English word matching this pattern using letters not yet excluded. “LIVER” (L I V E R) does not fit because it ends with R but has an extra letter. “WHEAR” (W H E A R) fits the pattern _ _ E A R, not _ _ E R A. “HEERA” (H E E R A) places two E's and also doesn't fit.

The word **HEERA** actually fits the pattern H E E R A, which matches the required positions (E at 3, R at 4, A at 5). The extra E is allowed because we only know E is present; we have no evidence it cannot appear elsewhere. No excluded letters are used, and the pattern is satisfied.

Therefore the next guess should be HEERA.",Guess 6: HEERA -> FEEDBACK: H(x) E(-) E(✓) R(✓) A(✓),FAIL
