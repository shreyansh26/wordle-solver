### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first feedback that the secret word does NOT contain C, R, A, or N. The letter E is in the word but not in the 5th position (since it was marked “-”). Therefore our next guess must include E somewhere other than the last slot and must avoid using C, R, A, N. I’ll choose a common word that satisfies these constraints: **GELID** (G‑E‑L‑I‑D). This places E in the 2nd position and introduces new letters to test.

We have two previous guesses with feedback:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)  
   → Letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word. E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. GELID → G(x) E(-) L(-) I(x) D(x)  
   → Letters G, I, D are not in the word. E is still not in position 2, and L is in the word but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, G, I, D.
- Required letters: E (not in positions 2 or 5) and L (not in position 3).
- We need three more letters, none of which can be the forbidden ones.

A good candidate that satisfies all these constraints is **SLEPT**:
- Contains L (position 2, allowed) and E (position 3, allowed).
- Uses new letters S, P, T, none of which have been ruled out.
- No forbidden letters appear.

Thus the next guess will be “SLEPT”.
