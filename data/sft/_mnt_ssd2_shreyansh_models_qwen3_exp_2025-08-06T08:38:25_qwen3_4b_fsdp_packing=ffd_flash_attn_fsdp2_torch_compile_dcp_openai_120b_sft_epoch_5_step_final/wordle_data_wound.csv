### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a valid 5‑letter English word. I'll choose a common word that contains a mix of common letters to get useful feedback. ""CRANE"" is a good starter.

From the first guess CRANE we learned:
- C, R, A, and E are not in the secret word.
- N is correct and in the fourth position.

Thus the secret word has the form _ _ _ N _. I need a new 5‑letter word that places N in the fourth slot and avoids C, R, A, E. “SHINY” fits: S H I N Y, with N as the fourth letter and none of the excluded letters.

We know N is correct in the fourth position. Letters C,R,A,E,S,H,I,Y are not in the word. We need a word of form ___N_. Choose a common word that fits and avoids the excluded letters. ""MOUND"" (M O U N D) satisfies: N is fourth, and M, O, U, D have not been ruled out yet.
