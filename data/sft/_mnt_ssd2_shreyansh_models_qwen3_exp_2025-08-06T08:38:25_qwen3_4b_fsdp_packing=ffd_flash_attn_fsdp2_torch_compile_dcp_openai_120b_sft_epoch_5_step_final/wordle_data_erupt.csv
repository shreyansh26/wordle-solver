### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback:
- R is correct at position 2.
- E is in the word but not at position 5.
- C, A, N are not in the word at all.

We need a new 5‑letter word with R in the second spot, containing E somewhere other than the fifth position, and avoiding C, A, N.  
A good candidate is **FROES** (F R O E S): it fits all constraints and introduces new letters (F, O, S) to gather more information.

We know:
- R is correct at position 2.
- E is in the word but not at positions 5 or 4 (from both guesses). So E can be at position 1 or 3.
- Letters C, A, N, F, O, S are not in the word.

We need a new word with R in the second slot, containing E at position 1 or 3, and using only letters not ruled out.  
A good candidate is **ERUPT** (E R U P T): it places E at position 1, keeps R at position 2, and introduces three new letters (U, P, T) that haven’t been tested yet.
