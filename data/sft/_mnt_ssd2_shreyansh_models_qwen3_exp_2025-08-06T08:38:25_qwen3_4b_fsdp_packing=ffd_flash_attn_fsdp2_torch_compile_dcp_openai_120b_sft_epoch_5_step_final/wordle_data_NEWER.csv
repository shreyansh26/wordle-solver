### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- From NERDS: N is correct at position 1; E is correct at position 2; R is present but not in position 3; D and S are not in the word.

Thus the secret word looks like:
1 N 2 E 3 ? 4 ? 5 ?

R must be somewhere other than positions 2, 3, 5, so it can only be at position 4. Therefore the pattern is **N E _ R _**.

All eliminated letters are {S, L, A, T, C, I, M, D}. The remaining unused letters include P, K, O, U, Y, etc. A common English word fitting the pattern is **NEPER** (N‑E‑P‑E‑R), which uses only allowed letters and places R at position 4.

Thus the next guess should be “NEPER”.

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters. ""SLATE"" is a good starter because it includes frequently used letters S, L, A, T, and E, giving useful information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

The feedback tells me that the letters S, L, A, and T are not in the secret word at all. The letter E is in the word but not in the fifth position (since it got a “-”). Therefore my next guess should avoid using S, L, A, T, and place E somewhere other than the last slot. A good candidate is **CRIME** (C‑R‑I‑M‑E), which satisfies these constraints and introduces four new letters to test.

We know from feedback:
- Letters S, L, A, T, C, I, M are not in the word.
- Letter E is in the word but not in positions 5 (from SLATE) nor 5 (from CRIME) → E cannot be in position 5.
- Letter R is in the word but not in position 2.

We need a 5‑letter word containing E and R, respecting those position restrictions, and using only letters not ruled out.  
The word **NERDS** fits:
- Contains E (position 2) and R (position 3), both allowed.
- Uses letters N, D, S which have not been eliminated.
Thus it is a valid next guess.
