### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from feedback:
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- T is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- L and A are not in the word.

We need a new 5‑letter word containing S, T, and E in different positions than those ruled out, and avoiding L and A. “STERN” fits:
- S in position 1 (allowed, S just can’t be 1).
- T in position 2 (allowed, T just can’t be 4).
- E in position 3 (allowed, E just can’t be 5).
- R and N fill the remaining spots and are not prohibited letters.

Thus “STERN” is a valid next guess.

We have confirmed letters:
- T is correct at position 2 (✓).
- S is in the word but not at positions 1 or 2 (from both guesses), so S can be 3,4,5.
- E is in the word but not at positions 3 or 5 (from both guesses), so E can be 1 or 4.
- Letters L, A, R, N are not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word with T fixed at the second spot, containing S and E in allowed positions, and using only letters not ruled out.

The word **ETHOS** fits:
- Pattern: E (pos1) – allowed for E.
- T (pos2) – confirmed correct.
- H (pos3) – new letter, not excluded.
- O (pos4) – new letter, not excluded.
- S (pos5) – allowed for S (not 1 or 2).

All constraints are satisfied, so ETHOS is a valid next guess.
