### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed:
- Position 2 = E (from LEMON and TEdit).
- Position 4 = I (from TEdit, I got ✓).
- Letter D is in the word but not at position 3 (from TEdit, D got “-”). So D can be at position 1 or 5.
- Letter T is in the word but not at positions 1, 5, or 3 (from BEGUT and TEdit). The only remaining slot is position 4, but that’s already I. This contradiction suggests a possible misinterpretation of the feedback. Rechecking TEdit: T at position 1 was “-”, meaning T is elsewhere; T at position 5 was “-”, meaning T is not at 5. So T must be at position 3. Therefore the pattern is _ E T I _.  
- D cannot be at position 3, so D must be at position 1 or 5.  
A common English word fitting “_ETI_” with D at position 1 is **DETIT** (D‑E‑T‑I‑T). It satisfies all constraints and uses only letters not ruled out.
