### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common consonants and vowels. ""SLATE"" is a good starter because it includes the frequent letters S, L, T and the vowels A, E.

We know the secret word starts with S and ends with E. Letters L, A, and T are not in the word at all. We need a new 5‑letter word fitting the pattern S _ _ _ E without using L, A, or T. A common candidate is ""SPINE"" (S‑P‑I‑N‑E), which satisfies all constraints.

We have the pattern:
- Position 1: S (correct)
- Position 5: E (correct)
- Letters P, L, A, T are not in the word.
- Letters I and N are in the word but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.

Thus I and N must occupy positions 2 or 4 (cannot be 1 or 5). A word that fits S _ _ _ E, includes I and N in allowed spots, and avoids the excluded letters is **SINGE** (S I N G E). This places I at position 2 and N at position 3, satisfying the constraints.
