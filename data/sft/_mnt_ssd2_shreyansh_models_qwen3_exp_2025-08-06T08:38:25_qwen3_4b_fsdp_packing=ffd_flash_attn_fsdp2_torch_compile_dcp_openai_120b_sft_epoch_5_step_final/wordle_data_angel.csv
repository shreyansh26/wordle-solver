### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed letters A, N, E are in the secret word, each in a different position than they appeared in prior guesses.

Constraints:
- A cannot be in position 3.
- N cannot be in positions 3 or 4.
- E cannot be in positions 2 or 5.

We need a 5‑letter word containing A, N, E plus two other letters (not C, R, M, D, S).  
The word **ANGLE** fits all constraints:
- A at position 1 (allowed).
- N at position 2 (allowed).
- G at position 3 (new letter).
- L at position 4 (new letter).
- E at position 5 (allowed).

Thus ANGLE is a valid next guess.

We have the following confirmed information from previous feedback:

- Position 1: A is correct (✓).
- Position 2: N is correct (✓).
- Position 3: G is correct (✓).
- Position 4: L is present but not in this position (-).
- Position 5: E is present but not in this position (-).

Thus the secret word follows the pattern **A N G _ _**, with the remaining letters being L and E, but L cannot be in position 4 and E cannot be in position 5. The only way to place L and E while respecting these constraints is to have **L in position 5** and **E in position 4**.

Therefore the word must be **ANGLE**. Since we have already guessed “ANGLE” and received feedback confirming the first three letters, the next logical step is to guess the word we know is correct.

We have confirmed the first three letters are A, N, G.  
From previous feedback:
- L is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in positions 2, 4, or 5.
Thus the only remaining slot for E is position 1, but position 1 is already A.  
This contradiction suggests the secret word does **not** contain L and E, and we have misinterpreted the feedback.

The correct pattern is **A N G _ _** with the last two letters being any unused letters not previously ruled out. A common English word fitting this pattern is **ANGRY** (A‑N‑G‑R‑Y). This respects all prior feedback (no C, R, M, D, S, etc.) and introduces new letters R and Y for further testing.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a valid 5‑letter English word. A common opening guess that contains a mix of common letters and vowels is “CRANE”. This will give useful information about the presence and positions of C, R, A, N, and E in the secret word.

We know from the feedback that the secret word does NOT contain C or R. It does contain A, N, and E, but none of them are in the positions they appeared in ""CRANE"": A is not in position 3, N is not in position 4, and E is not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes A, N, and E in different positions, and avoids C and R. A good candidate is **MENDS**:
- M E N D S
- Contains A? No, but we can still test the remaining letters.
- Contains N and E in new spots (N is now position 3, E is now position 2).
- No C or R.

This guess will tell us whether M and D and S are in the secret word and also confirm the new positions for N and E.
