### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed letters R, N, and E are in the secret word but not in the positions they appeared in previous guesses.

- R cannot be in positions 1 (from guess2) or 2 (from guess1). So R can be 3,4,5.
- N cannot be in positions 3 (guess2) or 4 (guess1). So N can be 1,2,5.
- E cannot be in positions 2 (guess2) or 5 (guess1). So E can be 1,3,4.

We need a valid 5‑letter word containing R, N, E in allowed spots and two other letters that haven't been ruled out.  
The word **NERVE** fits:
- N in position 1 (allowed)
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- R in position 3 (allowed)
- V and E in positions 4 and 5 (new letters, no conflict)

Thus “NERVE” is a good next guess.

We have determined the allowed positions for each letter:

- **N** cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 4 → possible positions: 2 or 5  
- **E** cannot be in positions 2, 5, or 4 → possible positions: 1 or 3  
- **R** cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 → possible positions: 4 or 5  

A word that respects these constraints and uses only allowed letters is **EERIN**:
- E at position 1 (allowed)
- E at position 2 (allowed)
- R at position 4 (allowed)
- I and N at positions 3 and 5 (both allowed)

Thus “EERIN” is a valid next guess.

We have gathered all constraints from previous feedback:

- **Letters confirmed in the word**: R, N, E, I (each marked with “-”).
- **Letters ruled out**: C, A, D, S, V, (duplicate E from guess4 shows E is not at position 5).
- **Position restrictions**:
  - **E** cannot be in positions 1,2,4,5 → **E must be in position 3**.
  - **R** cannot be in positions 1,2,3,4 → **R must be in position 5**.
  - **N** cannot be in positions 1,3,4,5 → **N must be in position 2**.
  - **I** cannot be in position 5 → **I can be in position 1 or 4**.

Putting these together, the pattern is:

1 ? 2 N 3 E 4 ? 5 R

The only common English word fitting this pattern and using the remaining allowed letters (I, plus another letter not yet ruled out) is **INFER** (I N F E R).

Thus the next logical guess is “INFER”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback:
- C and A are not in the word.
- R, N, and E are in the word but none are in the positions they occupied in ""CRANE"":
  * R is not in position 2.
  * N is not in position 4.
  * E is not in position 5.
We need a new guess that includes R, N, and E in different positions, avoids C and A, and tests other letters.  
""RENDS"" places R in position 1, E in position 2, N in position 3, and introduces D and S for further clues.

We have confirmed letters R, N, and E are in the secret word but not in the positions they appeared in previous guesses.

- R cannot be in positions 1 (from guess2) or 2 (from guess1). So R can be 3,4,5.
- N cannot be in positions 3 (guess2) or 4 (guess1). So N can be 1,2,5.
- E cannot be in positions 2 (guess2) or 5 (guess1). So E can be 1,3,4.

We need a valid 5‑letter word containing R, N, E in allowed spots and two other letters that haven't been ruled out.  
The word **NERVE** fits:
- N in position 1 (allowed)
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- R in position 3 (allowed)
- V and E in positions 4 and 5 (new letters, no conflict)

Thus “NERVE” is a good next guess.

- The secret contains at least two E’s; the only remaining open slot for an E is position 4 (position 3 is already occupied by a required letter).
- The remaining unknown letter (not yet placed) must be R, since R is known to be in the word but cannot be in positions 1‑4 (from earlier feedback), so it must be at position 5.

Thus the pattern is **I N _ E R**.
