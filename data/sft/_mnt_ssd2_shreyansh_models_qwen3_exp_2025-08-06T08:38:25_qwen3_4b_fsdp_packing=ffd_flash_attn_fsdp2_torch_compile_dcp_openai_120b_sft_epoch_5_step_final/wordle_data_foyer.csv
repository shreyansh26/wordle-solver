We have determined the secret word pattern is _ O _ E R, with letters O in position 2, E in position 4, and R in position 5. Excluded letters so far are C, A, N, V, P, W, G, D, plus any letters that appeared as “x”. The remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 3 are among B, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, S, T, U, X, Y, Z.

A common English word that fits the pattern and uses only allowed letters is **STOER** (a type of storage). It places S at position 1 and T at position 3, both of which have not been ruled out.

Thus the next guess should be “STOER”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback:
- C, A, N are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R and E in different positions (avoiding the forbidden spots) and avoids C, A, N. “ROVER” fits: it has R at positions 1 and 5 (both allowed), E at position 4 (allowed), and uses only letters O and V which haven’t been ruled out.

A common word fitting the pattern _ O _ E R is **POWER** (P O W E R). It introduces two new letters, P and W, which have not been ruled out.
