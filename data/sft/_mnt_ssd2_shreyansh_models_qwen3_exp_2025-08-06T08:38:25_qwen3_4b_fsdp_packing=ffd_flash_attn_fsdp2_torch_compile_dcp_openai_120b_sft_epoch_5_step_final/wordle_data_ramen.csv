### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback:

- From SLATE: S, L, T are not in the word; A and E are present but in wrong spots.
- From ADEPT: D, P, T are not in the word; A and E are still present but still in wrong spots.
- From EARNS: E is present but wrong spot (position 1); A is correct in position 2; R, N are present but wrong spots; S is not in the word.

Thus the secret word must have:
- A fixed at position 2.
- E somewhere other than position 1.
- R and N each in positions different from where they appeared in EARNS (R not position 3, N not position 4).
- Excluded letters: S, L, T, D, P, plus any letters shown as “x”.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **MANIA**:
- Position 2 is A (✓).
- Contains E? No, but we haven’t eliminated E entirely—actually we need an E somewhere else. Oops, that’s a problem. “MANIA” does not contain E.

Let’s try another candidate that includes E and meets all positional restrictions.  
**BAYOU** fits:
- A is at position 2 (✓).
- E is at position 3 (allowed, not position 1).
- R is not at position 3 (it’s absent here, which is fine).
- N is not at position 4 (it’s absent here, also fine).
- All letters (B, Y, O, U) are not among the eliminated set.

Therefore “BAYOU” is a valid next guess.

We have the following feedback:

- From SLATE: S, L, T are not in the word; A and E are present but in wrong spots.
- From ADEPT: D, P, T are not in the word; A and E are still present but still in wrong spots.
- From EARNS: E is present but wrong spot (position 1); A is correct in position 2; R, N are present but wrong spots; S is not in the word.

Thus the secret word must have:
- A fixed at position 2.
- E somewhere other than position 1.
- R and N each in positions different from where they appeared in EARNS (R not position 3, N not position 4).
- Excluded letters: S, L, T, D, P, plus any letters shown as “x”.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **MANIA**:
- Position 2 is A (✓).
- Contains E? No, but we haven’t eliminated E entirely—actually we need an E somewhere else. Oops, that’s a problem. “MANIA” does not contain E.

Let’s try another candidate that includes E and meets all positional restrictions.  
**BAYOU** fits:
- A is at position 2 (✓).
- E is at position 3 (allowed, not position 1).
- R is not at position 3 (it’s absent here, which is fine).
- N is not at position 4 (it’s absent here, also fine).
- All letters (B, Y, O, U) are not among the eliminated set.

Therefore “BAYOU” is a valid next guess.

We have the following confirmed information:

- Letter **R** is in the word but not in position 3 (‑ from EARNS).
- Letter **N** is in the word but not in position 4 (‑ from EARNS).
- Letter **E** is in the word but not in positions 1, 3, 5 (‑ from SLATE, EARNS, BAYOU). So **E** must be in position 2 or 4. Position 2 is already **A**, so **E** must be in position 4.
- Excluded letters: S, L, T, D, P, B, Y, O, U, plus any letters marked “x”.

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
