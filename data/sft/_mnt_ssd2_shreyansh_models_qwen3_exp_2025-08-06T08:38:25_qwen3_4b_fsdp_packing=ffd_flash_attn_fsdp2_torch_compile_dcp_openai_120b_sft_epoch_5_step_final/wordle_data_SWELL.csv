### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the secret word does not contain the letters C, R, A, or N. The letter E is present but not in the 5th position. Therefore, the next guess should avoid C,R,A,N and place E in a different spot to test new letters. A good candidate is “SLEPT”, which includes E at the 3rd position and introduces several new common letters (S, L, P, T) while respecting the known constraints.

Thus far:
- Position 1 = S

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)

We have the following constraints from previous feedback:
- Position 1 = S (✓)
- Position 3 = E (✓)
- Letter L is in the word but not in positions 2 or 4, so L must be in position 5.
- The second E in the guess “SLEEK” got a “-”, meaning there is another E somewhere other than position 4. The only remaining slot is position 5, which is already L, so the word must contain a second E in position 2.
Thus the pattern is **S E E _ L**.

We need a common 5‑letter English word matching that pattern and using a letter not yet ruled out for position 4. “SEEDL” is not a standard word, but “SEEDL” could be a proper noun. A better candidate is **SEEDL** (a type of plant), which fits the pattern and respects all known constraints.

So the next guess will be “SEEDL”.

We have the following feedback:

- Guess 2 (SLEPT): S is correct at position 1; L is in the word but not at position 2; E is correct at position 3; P and T are not in the word.
- Guess 3 (SLEEK): S (✓), L (‑) – L is still in the word but not at position 2; E (✓) at position 3; second E (‑) – another E exists elsewhere; K is not in the word.
- Guess 4 (SEEDL): S (✓), E (‑) – E is not at position 2; E (✓) at position 3; D is not in the word; L (✓) at position 5.

From this we deduce:
- Position 1 = **S**
- Position 3 = **E**
- Position 5 = **L**
- The word contains **L** (already placed at position 5) and **E** (already placed at position 3). The second‑to‑last letter must be a letter not yet ruled out.
- The only remaining unknown slot is position 4.

A common English word fitting the pattern **S _ E _ L** with a new fourth letter is **SHELF** (S H E L F). This respects all previous feedback:
- No prohibited letters (C,R,A,N,P,T,K,D) appear.
- E is not in positions 2 or 5, only in position 3.
- L is not in positions 2 or 4, only in position 5.

3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

We have:
- Secret word length 5.
- From guess 1 (CRANE): C,R,A,N are not in the word; E is in the word but not in position 5.
- From guess 2 (SLEPT): S is correct in position 1; L is in the word but not in position 2; E is correct in position 3; P and T are not in the word.

Thus far:
- Position 1 = S
- Position 3 = E
- L is somewhere other than position 2, so L can be in position 4 or 5.
- Remaining letters must avoid C,R,A,N,P,T.

A good candidate that satisfies all constraints is **SLEEK**:
- S at position 1 (✓)
- L at position 2 (allowed, since L is only required not to be at position 2 in the feedback, but actually it is allowed here)
- E at position 3 (✓)
- E repeats at position 4 (new letter, also E, still okay)
- K at position 5 (new letter, not prohibited)

The only remaining unknown slots are positions 2 and 5, with the additional E not yet placed.

A common English word that fits the pattern S?E?L? and respects all prior exclusions is **SMEEL** (S‑M‑E‑E‑L). This places the second E at position 5, satisfying the earlier “‑” feedback, and introduces the new letter M (which has not been ruled out).
