### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the secret word contains N and E, but not in the positions they appeared in previous guesses.  
- N cannot be in positions 2 (from ENJOY) or 4 (from CRANE).  
- E cannot be in positions 1 (from ENJOY) or 5 (from CRANE).  

Thus possible placements are:  
- N: positions 1, 3, or 5  
- E: positions 2, 3, or 4  

A word that respects these constraints and uses only allowed letters is **LEVEL** (L E V E L):  
- E is in positions 2 and 4 (both allowed).  
- N is not present, but we already know N is in the word, so this guess will confirm N’s location.

We have determined the constraints:
- The secret word contains N and E.
- N cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 5 → possible positions: 1 or 3.
- E cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 → possible positions: 3.
Thus the pattern must be _ _ E _ _. N must occupy position 3 (the only remaining spot) or 1 (but position 1 would conflict with other constraints). The only viable pattern is N in position 3 and E in position 3, which is impossible, so N must be in position 1 and E in position 3.

The word must therefore be of the form **N _ E _ _**, using only letters not ruled out (C,R,A,J,O,Y,L,V are excluded). A common English word fitting this pattern is **NEXUS** (N‑E‑X‑U‑S).

This guess will test the remaining unknown letters while respecting all known constraints.

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

- N cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 5 → possible positions: 1 or 3.
- E cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 → possible positions: 3.
Thus the pattern must be _ _ E _ _. N must occupy position 3 (the only remaining spot) or 1 (but position 1 would conflict with other constraints). The only viable pattern is N in position 3 and E in position 3, which is impossible, so N must be in position 1 and E in position 3.

The word must therefore be of the form **N _ E _ _**, using only letters not ruled out (C,R,A,J,O,Y,L,V are excluded). A common English word fitting this pattern is **NEXUS** (N‑E‑X‑U‑S).

This guess will test the remaining unknown letters while respecting all known constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback:
- C, R, A are not in the word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes N and E in different positions (avoiding those forbidden spots) and avoids C, R, A. “ENJOY” places E at position 1 and N at position 2, satisfying the constraints and introduces new letters J, O, Y for more information.

We know the secret word contains N and E, but not in the positions they appeared in previous guesses.  
- N cannot be in positions 2 (from ENJOY) or 4 (from CRANE).  
- E cannot be in positions 1 (from ENJOY) or 5 (from CRANE).  

Thus possible placements are:  
- N: positions 1, 3, or 5  
- E: positions 2, 3, or 4  

A word that respects these constraints and uses only allowed letters is **LEVEL** (L E V E L):  
- E is in positions 2 and 4 (both allowed).  
- N is not present, but we already know N is in the word, so this guess will confirm N’s location.  

All other letters (L, V) are not ruled out yet, making “LEVEL” a good next guess.
