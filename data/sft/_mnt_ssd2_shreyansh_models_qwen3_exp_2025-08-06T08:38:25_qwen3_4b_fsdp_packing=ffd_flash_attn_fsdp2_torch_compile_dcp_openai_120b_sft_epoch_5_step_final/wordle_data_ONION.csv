### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined that the secret word contains the letter N, but not in positions 3, 4, or 5 (from previous feedback). Therefore N must be in position 1 or position 2.

All other letters tried (C, R, A, E, L, U, G, S) are confirmed absent. We need a new guess that:
- Places N in position 1 or 2.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Choosing **NIGHT** places N in position 1 and introduces four fresh letters (I, G, H, T). Among these, G has been eliminated, but we can still learn about I, H, and T. This guess will test the placement of N and three new letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells me that C, R, A, and E are not in the secret word. The letter N is in the word but not in the fourth position (the position it occupied in ""CRANE""). I need a new five‑letter word that:
- Contains N in a different position (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th).
- Excludes C, R, A, and E entirely.

A good candidate is **LUNGS**:
- N is in the second position, satisfying the requirement that N is present but not fourth.
- The other letters L, U, G, S have not been ruled out yet.
Thus this guess will test four new letters while keeping N in a permissible spot.

We have determined that the secret word contains the letter N, but not in positions 3, 4, or 5 (from previous feedback). Therefore N must be in position 1 or position 2.

All other letters tried (C, R, A, E, L, U, G, S) are confirmed absent. We need a new guess that:
- Places N in position 1 or 2.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Choosing **NIGHT** places N in position 1 and introduces four fresh letters (I, G, H, T). Among these, G has been eliminated, but we can still learn about I, H, and T. This guess will test the placement of N and three new letters.
