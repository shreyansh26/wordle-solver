### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback:

- From CRANE: C, A, N are not in the word. R and E are present but in wrong spots.

  * Position 3 (D) is wrong → D is not in the word.
  * Position 4 (E) is correct → E is at position 4.
  * Position 5 (R) is wrong → R is not at position 5.

We have the following feedback:

- From CRANE: C, A, N are not in the word. R and E are present but in wrong spots.
- From RIDER: 
  * Position 1 (R) is wrong → R is not at position 1.
  * Position 2 (I) is wrong → I is not in the word.
  * Position 3 (D) is wrong → D is not in the word.
  * Position 4 (E) is correct → E is at position 4.
  * Position 5 (R) is wrong → R is not at position 5.

Thus:
- E is confirmed at the 4th letter.
- R is somewhere else, but not positions 1, 2, 4, 5 → must be position 3.
- Excluded letters: C, A, N, I, D.

We need a word of the form **__R_E** using only letters not excluded. A common English word fitting this pattern is **FORGE** (F O R G E).

This guess will test new letters F and G while keeping the known correct placements of R and E.

- From FORGE: R is correct at position 3. G is present but not at position 4. E is present but not at position 5. F, O are absent.

Thus the secret word must be of the form **_ _ R _ _** with:

We have the following feedback:

- From CRANE: C, A, N are not in the word. R and E are present but in wrong spots.
- From RIDER: E is correct at position 4. R is present but not in positions 1, 2, 5. I, D are absent.
- From FORGE: R is correct at position 3. G is present but not at position 4. E is present but not at position 5. F, O are absent.
- From GREET: 
  * G is present but not at position 1 → G cannot be position 1.
  * R is present but not at position 2 → R cannot be position 2 (already satisfied by earlier info).
  * E is present but not at position 3 → E cannot be position 3 (already satisfied by earlier info).
  * E at position 4 is correct.
  * T at position 5 is correct.

Thus the secret word must be of the form **_ _ R _ T** with E fixed at position 4 and G somewhere other than positions 1 and 4. The only remaining slot for G is position 2 (position 1 is ruled out, position 3 is R, position 4 is E, position 5 is T). Therefore the pattern is **_ G R E T**.

A common English word that fits this pattern and uses only letters not ruled out is **WGRIT** (a type of plant). No other common word matches the pattern with allowed letters, so we guess that word to confirm the final letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
