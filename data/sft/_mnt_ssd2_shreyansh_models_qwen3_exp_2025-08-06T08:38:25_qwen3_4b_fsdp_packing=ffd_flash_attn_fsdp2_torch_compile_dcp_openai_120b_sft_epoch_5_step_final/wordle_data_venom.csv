### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial 5‑letter word. A good opening guess is one that contains common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to gather useful information. ""CRANE"" is a popular starter word for this reason.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
We know from the feedback:
- C, R, A are not in the secret word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes N and E in different positions, avoids C, R, A, and tries new letters to gather more information. “NEXUS” places N at position 1 and E at position 2, satisfying the constraints and introduces X, U, S for testing.

We know from feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, X, U, S are not in the word.
- E is correct at position 2.
- N is in the word but not at positions 1 or 4; therefore N can be at position 3 or 5.
We need a word with E in the second slot and N in position 3 or 5, using only letters not ruled out. “MENDS” fits: M E N D S (E is second, N is third, and none of the letters are excluded). This will test new letters M, D, and S while respecting all constraints.

We have the following confirmed information:

- Letters **N** and **E** are the only confirmed letters; all other letters are still possible.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern: _ **E** **N** _ _.  
We need a valid English word using only allowed letters (any except the excluded ones) and placing N and E correctly. “KENOT” (K‑E‑N‑O‑T) satisfies the pattern and uses only letters not yet ruled out. It will test new letters K, O, and T while keeping the known correct positions fixed.

We have confirmed letters:

From PENNY feedback: the N at position 4 got a “-”, meaning N is in the word but not at position 4. This suggests the secret contains another N elsewhere, likely at position 1 (since positions 2 and 3 are already E and N). 

Thus the word pattern is **N E N O _**.  
We need a valid English word fitting this pattern with a new letter at the last position that hasn’t been ruled out (C,R,A,X,U,S,M,D,K,T,P,Y are excluded). “NENON” matches the pattern and uses only allowed letters, making it a strong candidate.
