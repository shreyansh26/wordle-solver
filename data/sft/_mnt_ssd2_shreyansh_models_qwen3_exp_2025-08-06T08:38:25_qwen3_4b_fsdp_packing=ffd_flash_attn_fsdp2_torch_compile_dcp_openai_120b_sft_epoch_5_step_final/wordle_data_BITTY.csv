### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following information from feedback:

- Confirmed letters:
  * I is correct in position 2 (I ✓).
  * T is in the word but not in positions 1, 4, 5 (from multiple “-” marks). Therefore T must be in position 3.
- No other letters have been confirmed.

Thus the secret word pattern is: _ I T _ _.  
All remaining letters must come from the alphabet excluding the excluded set. Viable letters for the unknown slots include B, D, F, J, K, O, Q, U, V, Y, Z, etc.

A common English word that fits the pattern and uses only allowed letters is **FIFTY** (F I T F Y).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes frequently used letters C, R, A, N, and E, giving useful information about the secret word.

The feedback tells me that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E appear in the secret word. I need a new guess that avoids those letters entirely. I’ll choose a common word with different letters to gather more information. “MIGHT” uses M, I, G, H, T – none of which have been ruled out yet, so it’s a good candidate for the next guess.

We know from feedback:
- Letters C,R,A,N,E,M,G,H are not in the word.
- I is correct in position 2.
- T is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a 5‑letter word with I as the second letter, containing T somewhere other than the fifth slot, and avoiding the excluded letters. “SPLIT” fits: S P I L T (I is second, T is fourth, and none of the letters are among the excluded ones).

We have the following information from feedback:

- Excluded letters (not in the word): C, R, A, N, E, M, G, H, S, P, L.
- Confirmed letters:
  * I is correct in position 2 (I ✓).
  * T is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5 (T - from SPLIT). Therefore T must be in position 1 or 3.
- No other letters have been confirmed.

We need a 5‑letter word with I as the second letter, containing T in position 1 or 3, and using only letters that have not been ruled out.

The word **TWIXT** fits perfectly:
- Pattern: T W I X T → I is in the second slot.
- T appears in positions 1 and 5, satisfying the requirement that T is in the word and not in positions 4 or 5.
- The letters W, X, and the second T have not been excluded.

Thus TWIXT is a valid next guess.
