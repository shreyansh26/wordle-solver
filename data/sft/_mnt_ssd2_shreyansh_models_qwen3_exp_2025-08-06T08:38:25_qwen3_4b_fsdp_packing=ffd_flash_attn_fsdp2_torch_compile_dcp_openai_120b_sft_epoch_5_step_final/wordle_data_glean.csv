### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following information from previous guesses:

- Letters that are in the word: A, N, E, L.
- Position constraints:
  * E is confirmed at position 3 (from ANELO).
  * A cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (from CRANE and ANELO).
  * N cannot be in positions 2 or 4 (from CRANE and ANELO).
  * L cannot be in position 4 (from ANELO).

A good candidate that satisfies all these constraints and introduces a new letter is **LUNGE**:
- Pattern L U N G E fits the known positions (E at 5, N at 3).
- L is placed at position 1, which is allowed.
- U and G are new letters to test.

We have the following information from previous guesses:

- Letters not in the word: C, R, O.
- Letters that are in the word: A, N, E, L.
- Position constraints:
  * E is confirmed at position 3 (from ANELO).
  * A cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (from CRANE and ANELO).
  * N cannot be in positions 2 or 4 (from CRANE and ANELO).
  * L cannot be in position 4 (from ANELO).

A good candidate that satisfies all these constraints and introduces a new letter is **LUNGE**:
- Pattern L U N G E fits the known positions (E at 5, N at 3).
- L is placed at position 1, which is allowed.
- U and G are new letters to test.

Thus the next guess is LUNGE.

We have the following information from previous guesses:

- Letters that are in the word: A, N, E, L, G.
- Position constraints:
  * E is confirmed at position 5 (from ANELO and LUNGE).
  * A cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (from CRANE and ANELO).
  * N cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4 (from CRANE, ANELO, LUNGE); thus N must be at position 1.
  * L cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (from ANELO and LUNGE); possible positions are 2 or 3.
  * G cannot be in position 4 (from LUNGE); possible positions are 1, 2, or 3.

Considering the pattern **N _ _ _ E**, we need to place A, L, and G in the remaining slots while respecting their constraints.  
A plausible arrangement is **N A L G E**, which satisfies all known restrictions and forms a valid English word (NALGE). This also tests the new letter G in position 3 and L in position 3.

Thus the next guess should be “NALGE”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the secret word does NOT contain C or R. It does contain A, N, and E, but none of them are in the positions they were in the guess “CRANE”:
- A is not in position 3
- N is not in position 4
- E is not in position 5

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes A, N, and E in different positions, avoids C and R, and introduces two new letters to test. “ANELO” (A‑N‑E‑L‑O) satisfies these conditions:
- A is in position 1 (allowed)
- N is in position 2 (allowed)
- E is in position 3 (allowed)
- L and O are new letters to test.
Thus it is a valid next guess.
