### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the secret word pattern is _ E _ _ _. The confirmed letters are:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common consonants and vowels. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes the frequent letters C, R, N and the vowels A and E, giving useful information about both consonants and vowel positions.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
We know from the first guess CRANE that C, R, A, N are not in the secret word, and E is in the word but not in position 5. Therefore the next guess must avoid C, R, A, N entirely, and must place E somewhere other than the fifth slot. A good candidate is “SLEET”: it contains E at positions 3 and 4, and uses only new letters (S, L, T) that haven’t been ruled out.

We have ruled out letters C, R, A, N, S, L, T because they received an “x”. The letter E is known to be in the word but not in positions 3, 4, or 5 (from both guesses). Therefore E must be in position 1 or 2.  

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
- Contains an E in position 1 or 2.
- Uses only letters that have not been excluded.
- Introduces new letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is **EPOXY**:
- E is at position 1 (allowed).
- P, O, X, Y are all letters we have not yet tested.
- The word is a common English word.

This guess will tell us whether E is indeed at position 1 and will introduce four fresh letters for further narrowing.
