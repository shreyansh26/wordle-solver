### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback:

  * E is correct at position 4.
  * R is also not in position 5 (the second R got “✓” only at position 5 if the secret had an R there, but we know it must be elsewhere).
  * O and V are not in the word.

Thus far we know:

We have the following feedback:

- From CRANE: C, A, N are not in the word. R and E are in the word but in wrong positions.
- From ROVER: 
  * R is in the word but not in position 1 (the first R got “-”).
  * E is correct at position 4.
  * R is also not in position 5 (the second R got “✓” only at position 5 if the secret had an R there, but we know it must be elsewhere).
  * O and V are not in the word.

Thus far we know:
- Positions 4 = E, 5 = R.
- The secret contains only one R (since the second R got “✓” at position 5, and the first R got “-”).
- No C, A, N, O, V.

We need a 5‑letter word of the form _ _ _ E R that does not contain any excluded letters and places the R at position 5. “SPERM” fits perfectly:
- S, P, E, R, M are all allowed.
- E is at position 4, R at position 5.
- No C, A, N, O, V appear.

Therefore the next guess should be “SPERM”.

We have the following feedback:

- From CRANE: C, A, N are not in the word. R and E are in the word but in wrong positions.
- From ROVER: E is correct at position 4, R is correct at position 5, and O, V are not in the word.
- From SPERM: S, P, M are not in the word; E is present but not at position 3; R is present but not at position 1.

Combining these:
- Position 4 = **E**
- Position 5 = **R**
- Letters **C, A, N, O, V, S, P, M** are ruled out.
- The remaining unknown letters (positions 1‑3) must be chosen from the alphabet excluding the ruled‑out letters.

A common English word that fits the pattern **___ER** with E at position 4 and R at position 5, and uses only allowed letters, is **WHYER** (W H Y E R). This introduces three new letters (W, H, Y) that have not been tested yet and respects all constraints.

Thus the next guess should be “WHYER”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the secret word does NOT contain C, A, or N. It does contain R and E, but R is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5. We need a new guess that includes R and E in different positions, and introduces new letters to test. “ROVER” places R at positions 1 and 5 (both different from position 2) and puts E at position 4 (different from position 5).
