### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback:

- From guess 1 (CRANE): C and A are not in the word. R, N, and E are in the word but not in the positions 2, 4, and 5 respectively.
- From guess 2 (RENDS): R, E, N, D are all in the word but not in the positions they occupied in that guess (R not 1, E not 2, N not 3, D not 4). S is not in the word.

Thus the secret word must contain the letters **R, E, N, D** plus one additional letter that is not C, A, or S.  
All letters must avoid the forbidden positions:
- R cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
- E cannot be in positions 2 or 5.
- N cannot be in positions 3 or 4.
- D cannot be in position 4.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **NERDY**:
- N in position 1 (allowed),
- E in position 2 (allowed),
- R in position 3 (allowed),
- D in position 4 (allowed),
- Y in position 5 (a new letter, not prohibited).

Therefore, the next guess should be “NERDY”.

I need to start the game with a valid 5‑letter English word. A common opening guess that contains a mix of common letters is “CRANE”. This will give useful information about which letters are present and their positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the first guess CRANE we learned:
- C and A are not in the word.
- R, N, and E are in the word but each is in a different position than guessed.
  - R cannot be in position 2.
  - N cannot be in position 4.
  - E cannot be in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R, N, and E, avoids C and A, and places those letters in positions different from the ones they occupied in CRANE. The word “RENDS” fits:
- R is in position 1 (allowed).
- E is in position 2 (allowed).
- N is in position 3 (allowed).
- D and S are new letters that haven’t been ruled out.

Thus “RENDS” is a valid next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: RENDS -> FEEDBACK: R(-) E(-) N(-) D(-) S(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
We have the following feedback:

- From guess 1 (CRANE): C and A are not in the word. R, N, and E are in the word but not in the positions 2, 4, and 5 respectively.
- From guess 2 (RENDS): R, E, N, D are all in the word but not in the positions they occupied in that guess (R not 1, E not 2, N not 3, D not 4). S is not in the word.

Thus the secret word must contain the letters **R, E, N, D** plus one additional letter that is not C, A, or S.  
All letters must avoid the forbidden positions:
- R cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
- E cannot be in positions 2 or 5.
- N cannot be in positions 3 or 4.
- D cannot be in position 4.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **NERDY**:
- N in position 1 (allowed),
- E in position 2 (allowed),
- R in position 3 (allowed),
- D in position 4 (allowed),
- Y in position 5 (a new letter, not prohibited).

Therefore, the next guess should be “NERDY”.

We have determined the secret word must contain the letters R, E, N, D plus one other letter. All positions are forbidden based on previous feedback:

- R cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 → must be 4 or 5.
- E cannot be in positions 2, 5 → can be 1, 3, or 4.
- N cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 4 → can be 2 or 5.
- D cannot be in positions 3, 4 → can be 1, 2, or 5.

The only common 5‑letter word that satisfies these position constraints and includes R, E, N, D is **DERBY**:
- D at position 1 (allowed)
- E at position 2 (allowed)
- R at position 3 (allowed)
- B at position 4 (new letter, not prohibited)
- Y at position 5 (allowed)

Thus the next guess should be “DERBY”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Guess 3 (NERDY): N(-) E(-) R(-) D(-) Y(x) → N, E, R, D still misplaced; Y not in word.
- Guess 4 (DERBY): D(-) E(-) R(-) B(x) Y(x) → D, E, R misplaced; B, Y not in word.
- Guess 5 (ENDOR): E(-) N(✓) D(✓) O(x) R(✓) → N is correct at position 2, D correct at position 3, R correct at position 5; E is in the word but not at position 1; O not in word; the dash on E means it’s elsewhere (positions 4 or 5, but 5 is R, so position 4).

Thus the pattern is: _ N D E R.

The only common English word fitting that pattern is **INDER** (a surname). No other plausible word fits the known letters and position constraints.

So the next guess should be “INDER”.",Guess 6: INDER -> FEEDBACK: I(x) N(✓) D(✓) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL
