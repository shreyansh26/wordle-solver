### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Letters C, R, E, V, L are not in the word (x from previous guesses).

Thus the pattern is A _ _ I N.  
A common English word fitting this pattern is **AMISS** (A‑M‑I‑S‑S), which respects all constraints and introduces new letters M and S for further testing.

So the next guess will be AMISS.

We have the following confirmed information:

- Position 1 = A (✓ from ANVIL and AMISS).
- Position 4 = I (✓ from ANVIL).
- Letter N is in the word but not in positions 2 or 4 (‑ from ANVIL), and not in position 1 (already A). The only remaining slot is position 5, so N must be at the end.
- Letter M is in the word but not at position 2 (‑ from AMISS). It cannot be at position 1 (A) or 4 (I), so M can be at position 3 or 5. Position 5 is already N, so M must be at position 3.
- Letters C, R, E, V, L, S are not in the word (x from previous guesses).

Thus the pattern is **A ? M I N**.  
A common English word fitting this pattern and using only letters not yet ruled out is **AMONG** (A‑M‑O‑N‑G). It satisfies all constraints and introduces new letters O and G for further testing.

Therefore the next guess should be “AMONG”.

- N is in the word but not at positions 2 or 4; the only remaining slot is position 5.

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes the vowel A and the common letters C, R, N, and E, giving useful information about the secret word.

We know from the first guess CRANE that:
- C, R, and E are not in the secret word.
- A and N are in the word but not in the positions they were guessed (A not in position 3, N not in position 4).

We need a new five‑letter word that includes A and N in different positions, and avoids C, R, and E. A good candidate is **ANVIL**:
- A is in position 1 (different from position 3).
- N is in position 2 (different from position 4).
- The other letters V, I, L have not been ruled out yet.
Thus this guess will give us more information about the remaining letters.
