### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the secret word pattern from feedback:
- Position 2 is A (confirmed).
- Position 5 is E (confirmed).
- Letters C, R, N, P, U, S are not in the word.
Thus the word looks like _ A _ _ E, with the remaining letters being any except the excluded ones.

We need a new guess that respects the known positions and introduces new letters to test. A good candidate is **BALMY**:
- B, L, M are new letters not yet tried.
- A stays in position 2.
- Y is a new letter for position 4.
This will give information about three fresh letters while keeping the confirmed placements.

We have confirmed:
- Position 2 is A (✓ from PAUSE).
- Position 5 is E (✓ from PAUSE and CRANE).
- Letter L is in the word but not in position 3 (‑ from BALMY). Since positions 2 and 5 are taken, L must be in position 1 or 4.
- Excluded letters: C, R, N, P, U, S, B, M, Y, plus any letters marked x.

We need a word of the form _ A _ _ E containing L (not at position 3) and using only allowed letters.  
The word **LADGE** fits:
- L at position 1 (allowed, not position 3).
- A at position 2 (confirmed).
- D and G are new letters not yet ruled out.
- E at position 5 (confirmed).

Thus LADGE is a valid next guess.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants. ""CRANE"" is a popular opening guess in Wordle‑style games because it tests the letters C, R, A, N, and E, covering two common vowels (A, E) and three frequent consonants.

<|im_start|>assistant
We know from the feedback that:
- C, R, N are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is correct in position 5.

Thus the secret word pattern is _ _ _ _ E, with A somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4.  
We need a new guess that respects these constraints and introduces new letters to test.  
Choosing **PAUSE** gives:
- P, U, S are new letters to test.
- A is placed in position 2 (allowed, since A cannot be position 3).
- E remains in position 5 (already confirmed correct).

This guess adheres to all known constraints and adds three fresh letters for more information.
