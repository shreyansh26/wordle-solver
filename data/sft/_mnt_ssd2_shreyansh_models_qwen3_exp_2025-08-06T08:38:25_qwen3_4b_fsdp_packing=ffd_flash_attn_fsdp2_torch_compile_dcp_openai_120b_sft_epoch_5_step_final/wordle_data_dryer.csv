- Position 1: D (✓ from guess 3)
- Position 2: R (✓ from all guesses)
- Position 4: E (✓ from guess 2)

Letters eliminated (not in the word): C, A, N, T, I, O, V, plus any other letters marked x.

Remaining unknown positions are 3 and 5. We need a word of the form D R _ E _. The common English word that fits is **DRESS** (D‑R‑E‑S‑S). It uses allowed letters (E and S have not been ruled out) and respects all previous feedback.

Thus the next guess should be DRESS.

We have confirmed:
- Position 1: D (✓)
- Position 2: R (✓)
- Position 4: E (✓)

Letters eliminated (not in the word): C, A, N, T, I, O, V, S, plus any other letters marked x.

Remaining unknown letters for positions 3 and 5 must be chosen from the unused alphabet (e.g., B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z).

We need a valid English word of the form D R _ E _. The word **DRYER** fits perfectly:
- D at 1, R at 2 (already confirmed)
- Y at 3 (not yet ruled out)
- E at 4 (confirmed)
- R at 5 (allowed, and R is known to be in the word)

Thus ""DRYER"" is a logical next guess.
