### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following information:

- Letters not in the word (x): C, R, A, N, E, G, H, T, L, B, S.
- Letters in the word but wrong positions (-): M (not in positions 1 or 3), I (not in positions 2 or 3).

Thus the secret word must contain **M** and **I**, with the following position restrictions:
- M cannot be in positions 1 or 3 → possible positions: 2, 4, 5.
- I cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → possible positions: 1, 4, 5.

All other letters must be chosen from the remaining alphabet (excluding the eliminated letters). A common English word that satisfies these constraints is **IMPOSSIBLE**:
- I is at position 1 (allowed).
- M is at position 3 (not allowed). Oops, that violates the M restriction.

Try another candidate. **IMMUTABLE**:
- I at position 1 (allowed).
- M at positions 2 and 3 (both not allowed). No good.

How about **IMMINENT**?
- I at position 1 (allowed).
- M at positions 3 and 4 (both not allowed). Still no.

We need a word with I and M in allowed slots and three other letters not yet ruled out.  
The word **IMMOBILE** works:
- I is at position 1 (allowed).
- M is at positions 2 and 3 (both allowed, since M can be 2 or 4 or 5).
- Remaining letters O, B, L, E are all still possible.

Thus “IMMOBILE” satisfies all known constraints and is a valid English word.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels. ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E) that will give useful information about the secret word.

The first guess ""CRANE"" showed that none of its letters (C, R, A, N, E) appear in the secret word. Therefore the next guess must avoid all of those letters. I’ll choose a common word using different letters, such as “MIGHT” (M, I, G, H, T), which contains none of the excluded letters.

We know from previous feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, G, H, T are not in the word.
- Letters M and I are in the word but not in the positions they were guessed:
  * M was guessed in position 1 → M cannot be position 1.
  * I was guessed in position 2 → I cannot be position 2.

We need a 5‑letter word that includes M and I in other positions and uses only letters not ruled out.  
The word **LIMBS** fits:
- Contains I (position 2) – allowed.
- Contains M (position 3) – allowed.
- Uses only letters L, I, M, B, S, none of which have been eliminated.
Thus it satisfies all constraints.
