### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed letters:
- Position 4 = N (from CRANE and SLING)
- Position 5 = E (from CRANE and SLING)

From TOVEN feedback:
- O is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 4 (already satisfied by position 5).
- N is in the word but not in position 5 (already satisfied by position 4).

Excluded letters (not in the word): C, R, A, S, L, I, G, T, V, and also letters from previous guesses that got an “x”: C,R,A,S,L,I,G,T,V.

Thus the secret word must be of the form __O_N or _O__N (since O cannot be in position 2) and must end with N‑E. A common English word fitting these constraints is **PHONY** (P‑H‑O‑N‑Y): O is in position 3, N is in position 4, E is in position 5, and none of the letters are excluded.

Therefore the next guess should be PHONY.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- C, R, A are not in the word.
- N is correct in position 4.
- E is correct in position 5.

So the secret word fits the pattern _ _ _ N E, with no C, R, or A anywhere. I need a common 5‑letter word ending with “NE” that uses only letters not excluded. “SLINGNE” is not a word, but “SLING” fits the pattern and uses only new letters. This will test S, L, I, G.

We know the secret word ends with N at position 4 and E at position 5 (pattern ___NE). Letters C, R, A, S, L, I, G are confirmed absent. We need a word fitting ___NE using only remaining letters. “TOVEN” (T O V E N) matches the pattern, uses only allowed letters, and introduces three new letters (T, O, V) to test further.

We have the pattern from feedback:

- Position 4 = N (confirmed)
- Position 5 = E (confirmed)
- Letter O is in the word but not in position 2.
- Letter E is in the word but not in position 4 (already satisfied by position 5).
- Letter N is in the word but not in position 5 (already satisfied by position 4).
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, S, L, I, G, T, V.

We need a 5‑letter word ending in “NE”, containing O (not at position 2) and possibly other allowed letters.  
“MOUNDNE” (M O U N D N E) fits:
- Ends with N‑E.
- Contains O at position 2 (allowed, since O is only required to be present, not necessarily to be elsewhere).
- Uses only letters not excluded (M, O, U, D, N, E).
Thus it will test the remaining unknown letters while respecting all known constraints.

Thus the word fits the pattern __ O N E.

A common English word that matches this pattern and uses only letters not excluded is **MOONE** (M‑O‑O‑N‑E). It places O at position 3, keeps N at 4 and E at 5, and introduces only the allowed letter M.
