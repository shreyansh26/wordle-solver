### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the secret word contains R, A, and E, but not C or N. From the feedback:
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R, A, and E in different positions, and avoids C and N. “PEARL” fits:
- P E A R L
- E is at position 2 (allowed),
- A is at position 3 (not allowed) → this would conflict, so actually PEARL is invalid.
Try “REALM”: R E A L M.
- R is at position 1 (allowed),
- E is at position 2 (allowed),
- A is at position 3 (still not allowed),
- No C or N.

Thus we need a word that places A somewhere other than position 3. “TARES” (T A R E S) satisfies all constraints:
- Contains R, A, E.
- R is at position 3 (not position 2).
- A is at position 2 (not position 3).
- E is at position 4 (not position 5).
- No C or N.

Therefore the next guess should be “TARES”.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters. ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it includes frequently used letters C, R, A, N, and E, giving useful information about the secret word.

We know the secret word contains R, A, and E, but not C or N. From the feedback:
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R, A, and E in different positions, and avoids C and N. “PEARL” fits:
- P E A R L
- E is at position 2 (allowed),
- A is at position 3 (not allowed) → this would conflict, so actually PEARL is invalid.
Try “REALM”: R E A L M.
- R is at position 1 (allowed),
- E is at position 2 (allowed),
- A is at position 3 (still not allowed),
- No C or N.

Thus we need a word that places A somewhere other than position 3. “TARES” (T A R E S) satisfies all constraints:
- Contains R, A, E.
- R is at position 3 (not position 2).
- A is at position 2 (not position 3).
- E is at position 4 (not position 5).
- No C or N.

Therefore the next guess should be “TARES”.

We know from the feedback:

- Position 4 is E (✓).
- Letters C, N, T, S are not in the word.
Thus the secret word fits the pattern _ A R E _. We need a common English word that matches this pattern and does not use any excluded letters. “WAREO” (W A R E O) satisfies all constraints, using only allowed letters.

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK
