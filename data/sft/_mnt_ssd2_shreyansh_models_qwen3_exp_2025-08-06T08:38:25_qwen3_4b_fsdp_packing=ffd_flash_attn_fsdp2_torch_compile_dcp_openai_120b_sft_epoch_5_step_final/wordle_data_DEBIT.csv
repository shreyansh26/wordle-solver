### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the secret word does NOT contain the letters C, R, A, or N. The letter E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position (since it got a “-”). Therefore our next guess must include E in a position other than 5, and avoid using C, R, A, N altogether.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
We know from the feedback that the secret word does NOT contain the letters C, R, A, or N. The letter E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position (since it got a “-”). Therefore our next guess must include E in a position other than 5, and avoid using C, R, A, N altogether.

A good candidate is **SLEPT**:
- Contains E in the 3rd position (allowed).
- Uses only letters S, L, P, T besides E, none of which have been ruled out.
- Is a valid English 5‑letter word.

Thus we will guess “SLEPT”.

We have the following feedback:

- From guess 1 (CRANE): C, R, A, N are not in the word. E is in the word but not in position 5.
- From guess 2 (SLEPT): S and L are not in the word. P is not in the word. T is correct in position 5. E is in the word but not in position 3.

Thus:
- Position 5 = T.
- The letter E must be somewhere in positions 1‑4, but not positions 3 or 5.
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, S, L, P.
- Remaining possible letters: B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5‑letter word ending in T, containing E in one of the allowed spots, and using only allowed letters.  
“BEGOT” fits perfectly:
- Pattern: B E G O T → T is at position 5.
- E is at position 2 (allowed).
- Letters B, G, O are not excluded.

Therefore the next guess is “BEGOT”.

- Guess 3 (BEGOT): B is in the word but not in position 1. E is correct in position 2. G, O are not in the word. T is correct in position 5.

Thus the secret word must follow the pattern: _ E _ _ T, contain the letter B somewhere other than the first position, and avoid the excluded letters {C,R,A,N,S,L,P,G,O}.  

A common English word that satisfies all these constraints is **FEBIT**:
- F E B I T fits the pattern.
- B is in position 3 (not position 1).
- No excluded letters are used.
- E is in position 2 (allowed) and T is in position 5 (confirmed).

Therefore the next guess should be “FEBIT”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Position 4 is I (✓ from FEBIT).
- Position 5 is T (✓ from FEBIT).
- Position 1 is still unknown, but it cannot be any of the letters that have been marked as not in the word: C, R, A, N, S, L, P, G, O, F, H. It also cannot be B (since B was marked as present but wrong at position 1 in BEGOT).

The only common English word that fits the pattern _ E B I T with those constraints is **DEBIT** (D E B I T). D has not been ruled out, and “debit” is a valid, frequently used word.

Thus the next guess should be DEBIT.",Guess 6: DEBIT -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) E(✓) B(✓) I(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
