### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the letters C, R, A, and E are not in the secret word. The letter N is present but not in the fourth position (the position it occupied in “CRANE”). Therefore the next guess should:
- Exclude C, R, A, E.
- Include N in a different position (1, 2, 3, or 5).

A good candidate is **SUNNY**:
- Contains N at the third position (different from position 4).

We have the following constraints from feedback:

- Letters C, R, A, E, S, U, T, H, G are not in the word.
- Y is correct at position 5.
- N is correct at position 3.
- I is in the word but not at position 3.
- The second N in the guess “SUNNY” was marked “-”, confirming N exists elsewhere (already placed at position 3).
- No other letters have been identified yet.

Thus the pattern is **_ _ N _ Y** with I occupying either position 1 or 2 (or both).  
A common English word fitting this pattern and using only allowed letters is **INBOX** (I N B O X).  
This respects all known constraints and introduces new letters B, O, X for further testing.

So the next guess will be “INBOX”.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes frequently used letters C, R, A, N, and E, giving useful information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

We know from the feedback that the letters C, R, A, and E are not in the secret word. The letter N is present but not in the fourth position (the position it occupied in “CRANE”). Therefore the next guess should:
- Exclude C, R, A, E.
- Include N in a different position (1, 2, 3, or 5).

A good candidate is **SUNNY**:
- Contains N at the third position (different from position 4).
- Uses only letters S, U, N, Y besides the N, none of which have been ruled out.

Thus we will guess “SUNNY”.

- Y is at position 5 (matches).
- I is at position 2 (not position 1).
- N is at position 3 (not position 3? No, that would conflict. Wait, N is at position 3 in DINKY, which matches the earlier confirmation that N is at position 3. The “-” feedback for N in earlier guesses only indicated N was elsewhere, but we already have N fixed at position 3.
- K is at position 4 (not position 3).
- D is at position 1 (not position 5).

All constraints are satisfied, and “DINKY” is a valid five‑letter word.

Therefore the next guess should be **DINKY**.",Guess 6: DINKY -> FEEDBACK: D(x) I(✓) N(✓) K(✓) Y(✓),FAIL
