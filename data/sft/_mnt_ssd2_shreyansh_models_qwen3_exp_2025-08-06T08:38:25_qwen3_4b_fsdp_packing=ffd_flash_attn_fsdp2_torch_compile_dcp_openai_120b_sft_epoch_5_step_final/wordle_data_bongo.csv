### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following confirmed information:

- Letter O is in the word but not in position 3 (O‑). The only remaining open slots are positions 2, 4, or 5, so O must be in one of those.
- Letter R is not in the word (x).
- Letters eliminated so far: C, R, A, E, M, I, T, Y, U, S, W, plus any others marked x.
- Remaining possible letters include D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, X, Z, etc.

We need a word of the form **B _ N _ _** that contains O (not in position 3) and uses only allowed letters.  
The word **BINGO** fits perfectly:
- B in position 1 (✓)
- I in position 2 (new letter, allowed)
- N in position 3 (✓)
- G in position 4 (new letter, allowed)
- O in position 5 (places O in a new slot, satisfying the “‑” feedback)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a valid 5‑letter English word. I’ll choose a common word that contains a mix of common letters to get useful feedback. “CRANE” is a good starter.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the first guess CRANE we learned:
- C, R, A, E are not in the secret word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

So the next guess must avoid C, R, A, E and place N in a different position (1, 2, 3, or 5). I’ll choose a word that includes N in a new spot and introduces several new letters to gather more information. “MINTY” places N at position 3 and adds M, I, T, Y for testing.

We know from feedback:
