### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Contain **A**, **L**, **E** somewhere other than the positions they occupied in PALEO (A not in position 2, L not in position 3, E not in position 4).

We know from the first feedback that the secret word does NOT contain C, R, or N. It DOES contain A and E, but A is NOT in the 3rd position and E is NOT in the 5th position. 

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes A and E in different positions (avoiding the prohibited spots) and avoids C, R, N. A good candidate is **PALEO**:
- Positions: P(1) A(2) L(3) E(4) O(5)
- A is in position 2 (allowed), E is in position 4 (allowed), and none of the forbidden letters appear.

We have the following feedback so far:
- From CRANE: C, R, N are not in the word; A and E are in the word but in wrong spots.
- From PALEO: P is correct at position 1; A, L, E are in the word but in wrong spots; O is not in the word.

Thus the secret word must:
- Start with **P**.
- Contain **A**, **L**, **E** somewhere other than the positions they occupied in PALEO (A not in position 2, L not in position 3, E not in position 4).
- Exclude letters C, R, N, O.

A good candidate that satisfies all these constraints is **PLEAD**:
- P is at position 1 (✓).
- L is at position 2 (allowed, not position 3).
- E is at position 3 (allowed, not position 4).
- A is at position 4 (allowed, not position 2).
- D is a new letter not ruled out.

Therefore the next guess should be “PLEAD”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
