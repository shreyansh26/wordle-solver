### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

We have the following feedback:

- From SLEET: S, T are not in the word. L is in the word but not in position 2. One E is in the word but not in position 3, and the second E is correct in position 4.

Thus the secret word must:
- Contain the letters **E** (positions 1, 3, or 4) and **L** (positions 1, 3, or 5, but not 2).
- Have an **E** fixed at position 4.
- Exclude the letters C, R, A, N, S, T.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **FELIX**:
- Pattern: F E L I X → E is at position 2, L at position 3, and the fourth letter is E (matching the ✓).
- None of the forbidden letters appear.
- It is a valid English word.

We have the following information from previous feedback:

- Letters not in the word (marked x): C, R, A, N, S, T, F, I, X.
- Letters in the word but misplaced (marked -):
  * E appears in the word, but not in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from CRANE and FELIX). So E can only be in position 1 or 4.
  * L appears in the word, but not in positions 2 or 3 (from SLEET and FELIX). So L can be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- E is correctly placed at position 4 (from SLEET, where the fourth letter was E and marked ✓).

Thus the word must have:
- E at the 4th position.
- L somewhere in positions 1, 5, or 4 (but not 2 or 3). Since position 4 is already E, L must be at position 1 or 5.
- No forbidden letters.

A common English word that satisfies all these constraints is **BLEED**:
- B L E E D → L is at position 2 (which is not allowed). Oops, that doesn’t work.

Try another candidate. **DELAY** fits:
- D E L A Y → E is at position 2 (not allowed). No good.

**DELVE** → E at 2, L at 3, both not allowed.

**LEVEL** → E at 2 and 4, L at 3, also not allowed.

**LEVEE** → L at 1, E at 2,4, still conflicts.

We need a word with L at position 1 or 5 and E at position 4, using only allowed letters.  
The word **LUCKY** fits:
- L (position 1, allowed)
- U, C (C is forbidden), K, Y (all allowed)
- E is not present, but we already have E at position 4 from earlier feedback. So this doesn’t satisfy the presence of E.

Wait, we must have an E at position 4. A word that satisfies all constraints is **PLEBE** (P‑L‑E‑B‑E):
- L is at position 2 (still not allowed). No good.

Another approach: the only remaining allowed letters are B, D, E, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S (no), T (no), U, V, W, X (no), Y, Z. We need a word with L at 1 or 5, E at 4, and no forbidden letters.

The word **BLEED** fits:
- B L E E D → L at position 2 (still not allowed). No.

**DELLY** → D E L L Y → E at 2 (not allowed).

**VELDT** → V E L D T → E at 2, T not allowed.

**LEVEL** → E at 2, L at 3, not allowed.

**LEVEE** → L at 1, E at 2,4, L at 5, still E at 2.

It seems the only viable word that meets all constraints is **PLEBE** (L at position 2, which is not allowed). This suggests there may be no valid word under the current constraints, but the game must have a solution.

Alternatively, maybe the feedback was misinterpreted. Let’s recheck:

- From SLEET: L was marked “-”, meaning L is in the word but not at position 2. So L could be at 1,3,4,5. From FELIX: L was also “-”, so L cannot be at 3. Thus L can be at 1,4,5.

- We have an E at position 4 (✓).

- L cannot be at 1,4,5? No, L can be at 1,4,5 but not at 2 or 3. If L is at position 1, that works.

So a word with L at 1, E at 4, and no forbidden letters would solve the puzzle. The word **LOWEL** (L‑O‑W‑E‑L) fits:
- L is at position 1 (allowed).
- E is at position 4 (correct).
- No letters are C, R, A, N, S, T, F, I, X, etc.

Thus the next guess should be “LOWEL”.

Another approach: the only remaining allowed letters are B, D, E, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S (no), T (no), U, V, W, X (no), Y, Z. We need a word with L at 1 or 5, E at 4, and no forbidden letters.

The word **BLEED** fits:
- B L E E D → L at position 2 (still not allowed). No.

**DELLY** → D E L L Y → E at 2 (not allowed).

**VELDT** → V E L D T → E at 2, T not allowed.

**LEVEL** → E at 2, L at 3, not allowed.

**LEVEE** → L at 1, E at 2,4, L at 5, still E at 2.

It seems the only viable word that meets all constraints is **PLEBE** (L at position 2, which is not allowed). This suggests there may be no valid word under the current constraints, but the game must have a solution.

Alternatively, maybe the feedback was misinterpreted. Let’s recheck:

- From SLEET: L was marked “-”, meaning L is in the word but not at position 2. So L could be at 1,3,4,5. From FELIX: L was also “-”, so L cannot be at 3. Thus L can be at 1,4,5.

- We have an E at position 4 (✓).

- L cannot be at 1,4,5? No, L can be at 1,4,5 but not at 2 or 3. If L is at position 1, that works.

So a word with L at 1, E at 4, and no forbidden letters would solve the puzzle. The word **LOWEL** (L‑O‑W‑E‑L) fits:
- L is at position 1 (allowed).
- E is at position 4 (correct).
- No letters are C, R, A, N, S, T, F, I, X, etc.

Thus the next guess should be “LOWEL”.",Guess 4: LOWEL -> FEEDBACK: L(-) O(✓) W(✓) E(✓) L(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The first guess CRANE gave feedback that C, R, A, and N are not in the secret word, while E is in the word but not in the 5th position. Therefore the next guess must avoid C, R, A, N entirely and place E somewhere other than the last slot. A good candidate is “SLEET”: it contains E at positions 3 and 4, and uses only letters not ruled out.

Guess 2: SLEET -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) E(-) E(✓) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
We have the following feedback:

- From CRANE: C, R, A, N are not in the word. E is in the word but not in position 5.
- From SLEET: S, T are not in the word. L is in the word but not in position 2. One E is in the word but not in position 3, and the second E is correct in position 4.

Thus the secret word must:
- Contain the letters **E** (positions 1, 3, or 4) and **L** (positions 1, 3, or 5, but not 2).
- Have an **E** fixed at position 4.
- Exclude the letters C, R, A, N, S, T.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **FELIX**:
- Pattern: F E L I X → E is at position 2, L at position 3, and the fourth letter is E (matching the ✓).
- None of the forbidden letters appear.
- It is a valid English word.

Therefore the next guess will be “FELIX”.

Guess 3: FELIX -> FEEDBACK: F(x) E(-) L(-) I(x) X(x)
<|im_end|>

We have the following information from previous feedback:

- Letters not in the word (marked x): C, R, A, N, S, T, F, I, X.
- Letters in the word but misplaced (marked -):
  * E appears in the word, but not in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from CRANE and FELIX). So E can only be in position 1 or 4.
  * L appears in the word, but not in positions 2 or 3 (from SLEET and FELIX). So L can be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- E is correctly placed at position 4 (from SLEET, where the fourth letter was E and marked ✓).

Thus the word must have:
- E at the 4th position.
- L somewhere in positions 1, 5, or 4 (but not 2 or 3). Since position 4 is already E, L must be at position 1 or 5.
- No forbidden letters.

A common English word that satisfies all these constraints is **BLEED**:
- B L E E D → L is at position 2 (which is not allowed). Oops, that doesn’t work.

**LEVEE** → L at 1, E at 2,4, still conflicts.

We need a word with L at position 1 or 5 and E at position 4, using only allowed letters.  
The word **LUCKY** fits:
- L (position 1, allowed)
- U, C (C is forbidden), K, Y (all allowed)
- E is not present, but we already have E at position 4 from earlier feedback. So this doesn’t satisfy the presence of E.

Wait, we must have an E at position 4. A word that satisfies all constraints is **PLEBE** (P‑L‑E‑B‑E):

**VELDT** → V E L D T → E at 2, T not allowed.

**LEVEL** → E at 2, L at 3, not allowed.

**LEVEE** → L at 1, E at 2,4, L at 5, still E at 2.

It seems the only viable word that meets all constraints is **PLEBE** (L at position 2, which is not allowed). This suggests there may be no valid word under the current constraints, but the game must have a solution.

Alternatively, maybe the feedback was misinterpreted. Let’s recheck:

- From SLEET: L was marked “-”, meaning L is in the word but not at position 2. So L could be at 1,3,4,5. From FELIX: L was also “-”, so L cannot be at 3. Thus L can be at 1,4,5.

- We have an E at position 4 (✓).

- L cannot be at 1,4,5? No, L can be at 1,4,5 but not at 2 or 3. If L is at position 1, that works.

So a word with L at 1, E at 4, and no forbidden letters would solve the puzzle. The word **LOWEL** (L‑O‑W‑E‑L) fits:
- L is at position 1 (allowed).
- E is at position 4 (correct).
- No letters are C, R, A, N, S, T, F, I, X, etc.

Thus the next guess should be “LOWEL”.

We have the following feedback:

- Guess 1 (CRANE): C, R, A, N are not in the word; E is in the word but not in position 5.
- Guess 2 (SLEET): S, T are not in the word; L is in the word but not in position 2; one E is in the word but not in position 3; the second E is correct in position 4.
- Guess 3 (FELIX): F, I, X are not in the word; E is in the word but not in position 2; L is in the word but not in position 3.
- Guess 4 (LOWEL): L is in the word but not in position 1; O is correct in position 2; W is correct in position 3; E is correct in position 4; the final L is correct in position 5.

From these clues:
- The secret word has the pattern **_ O W E L**.
- The first letter cannot be C, R, A, N, S, T, F, I, X, L, or any letter already ruled out.
- The only common English word that fits this pattern is **HOWEL** (a type of stone wall).

Thus the next guess should be “HOWEL”.
