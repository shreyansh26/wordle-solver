### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the first feedback:
- C and N are not in the word.
- R, A, and E are in the word but each is in a different position than guessed.

So we need a new guess that includes R, A, and E in different spots, and avoids C and N. “RAVEL” satisfies this:
- R is in position 1 (different from position 2).
- A is in position 2 (different from position 3).
- E is in position 4 (different from position 5).
- It adds new letters V and L to test additional possibilities.

- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5 → possible positions 1, 2, or 3.  

We need a word that places R, A, and E in allowed spots and fills the remaining two slots with letters we haven’t tested yet.  

The word **EXTRA** fits:
- E is at position 1 (allowed),
- X is a new test letter,
- T is another new test letter,
- R is at position 4 (allowed),
- A is at position 5 (allowed).

This guess will confirm the exact positions of R, A, and E and test two new letters.

We have determined the possible positions for R, A, and E based on the feedback:

- **E** cannot be in positions 1, 4, or 5 → possible positions: 2 or 3.  
- **R** cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 4 → possible positions: 3 or 5.  
- **A** cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 → possible positions: 1 or 4.

The only arrangement that satisfies all these constraints is:
- Position 1 = A
- Position 2 = E
- Position 3 = R
- Positions 4 and 5 are still unknown.

A common English word fitting this pattern is **AERIE** (A E R I E). It places A, E, and R in the allowed spots and introduces new letters I and E for the remaining positions.

Thus the next guess should be “AERIE”.

We have determined the secret word pattern based on feedback:

- Position 2 is definitely **E** (from AERIE feedback).
- **A** cannot be in positions 1,2,3,5 → must be at position 4.
- **R** cannot be in positions 1,2,3,4 → must be at position 5.
- The remaining letters (positions 1 and 3) must be letters not yet ruled out.

Thus the word pattern is: _ E _ A R.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters. ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it includes frequently used letters C, R, A, N, and E, giving useful information for the next steps.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the first feedback:
- C and N are not in the word.
- R, A, and E are in the word but each is in a different position than guessed.

So we need a new guess that includes R, A, and E in different spots, and avoids C and N. “RAVEL” satisfies this:
- R is in position 1 (different from position 2).
- A is in position 2 (different from position 3).
- E is in position 4 (different from position 5).
- It adds new letters V and L to test additional possibilities.
Thus “RAVEL” is a logical next guess.

We know the secret word contains the letters R, A, and E, each in a different position from those they appeared in the previous guesses.  
- R cannot be in positions 1 or 2 → possible positions 3, 4, or 5.  
- A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → possible positions 1, 4, or 5.  
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5 → possible positions 1, 2, or 3.  

We need a word that places R, A, and E in allowed spots and fills the remaining two slots with letters we haven’t tested yet.  

The word **EXTRA** fits:
- E is at position 1 (allowed),
- X is a new test letter,
- T is another new test letter,
- R is at position 4 (allowed),
- A is at position 5 (allowed).

This guess will confirm the exact positions of R, A, and E and test two new letters.
