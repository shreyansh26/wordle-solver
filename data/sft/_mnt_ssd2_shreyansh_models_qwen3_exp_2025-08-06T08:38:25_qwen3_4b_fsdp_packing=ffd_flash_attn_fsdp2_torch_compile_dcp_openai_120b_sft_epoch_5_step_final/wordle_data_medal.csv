### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the letters that are definitely in the secret word: A, D, E, L.  
From the feedback we know:
- A cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 → A must be in position 4 or 5.
- D cannot be in positions 2 or 5 → D can be in positions 1, 3, or 4.
- E cannot be in positions 3, 4, or 5 → E must be in position 1 or 2.
- L cannot be in position 3 → L can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **ELLDA**:
- E at position 1 (allowed),
- L at positions 2 and 3 (both allowed, and L isn’t in position 3),
- D at position 4 (allowed),
- A at position 5 (allowed).

All letters are from the allowed set, and the word is a valid English word (a type of plant). This guess will test the remaining unknown letter and confirm the positions of the known letters.

We have determined the letters that must be in the secret word: A, D, E, L.  
From the feedback, we know the following position restrictions:

- **A** cannot be in positions 1,2,3,5 → A must be in position 4.  
- **D** cannot be in positions 2,4,5 → D can be in position 1 or 3.  
- **E** cannot be in positions 1,3,4,5 → E must be in position 2.  
- **L** cannot be in positions 2,3 → L can be in positions 1,4,5 (but position 4 is already A, so L can be 1 or 5).

Thus the pattern is:  
_ E _ A _  
with D at position 1 or 3, and L at position 1 or 5.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **DELAY** (D E L A Y).  
- D is at position 1 (allowed).  
- E is at position 2 (required).  
- L is at position 3 (allowed).

- Y is a new letter that hasn’t been ruled out.

Therefore the next guess should be “DELAY”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback:
- C, R, N are not in the word.
- A and E are in the word but not in the positions they were guessed (A not in position 3, E not in position 5).

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes A and E in different positions, and avoids C, R, N. A good candidate is **ADEPT**:
- Contains A (position 1) and E (position 3), both different from their previous spots.
- Uses only letters that haven’t been ruled out.
Thus we’ll guess ADEPT.

We have the following information from feedback:

- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, P, T.
- Letters that are in the word but misplaced:
  * A is in the word, but not in positions 1 or 3.
  * D is in the word, but not in position 2.
  * E is in the word, but not in positions 3 or 5.

We need a 5‑letter English word that contains A, D, and E, respects those position restrictions, and avoids the excluded letters.  

The word **VALED** fits perfectly:
- V A L E D
- Contains A (position 2, allowed), D (position 5, allowed), E (position 4, allowed).
- No prohibited letters are used.
Thus it is a valid next guess.
