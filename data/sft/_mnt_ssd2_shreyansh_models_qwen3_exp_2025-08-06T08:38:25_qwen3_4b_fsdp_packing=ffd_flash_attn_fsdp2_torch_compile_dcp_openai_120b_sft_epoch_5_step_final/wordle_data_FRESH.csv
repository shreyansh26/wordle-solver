### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We need a valid 5‑letter English word matching that pattern, using none of the excluded letters.  
A good candidate is **GREED** (G R E E D), which fits the pattern and introduces only new letters G and D (both not yet ruled out).

So the next guess will be GREED.

We have determined the following from previous feedback:

- Position 2 is definitely **R** (✓ in all guesses).
- Position 3 is definitely **E** (✓ in guess 4).
- Position 4 cannot be **E** (‑ in guess 4) and cannot be **E** from earlier guesses, so it’s something else.
- Position 1 cannot be **C, A, N, T, I, D, G** (all got x).
- Position 5 cannot be **D** (x in guess 4) and cannot be **E** (‑ in guess 2), and also not any of the eliminated letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
We know from the first feedback:
- R is correct at position 2.
- E is in the word but not at position 5.
- C, A, N are not in the word.

We need a new 5‑letter word with R in the second slot, containing E somewhere other than the fifth slot, and avoiding C, A, N. “TRIED” fits these constraints (T R I E D): R is in position 2, E is in position 4, and it uses none of the excluded letters.

We have determined from previous feedback:
- Position 2 must be R (✓).
- The letter E is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5 (both gave “-”). Therefore E can only be in position 1 or 3.
- Letters C, A, N, T, I, D are not in the word (all got “x”).

We need a 5‑letter word with R in the second slot, E in slot 1 or 3, and using none of the excluded letters.  
The word **ERUPT** fits:
- E is in position 1 (allowed).
- R is in position 2 (required).
- U, P, T are new letters not yet ruled out.
Thus it will give us new information about the remaining letters.
