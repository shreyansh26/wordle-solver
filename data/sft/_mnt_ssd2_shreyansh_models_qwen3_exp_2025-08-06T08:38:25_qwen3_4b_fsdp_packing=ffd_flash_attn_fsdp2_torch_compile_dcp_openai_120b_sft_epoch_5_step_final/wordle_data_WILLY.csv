### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, M, G, H, T are not in the word.
- Letter I is correct and in the second position.

Thus the secret word pattern is _ I _ _ _. Remaining possible letters are B, D, F, J, K, L, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a common 5‑letter word with I as the second letter using only those allowed letters. “D I S K O” (D I S K O) fits: D, S, K, O are all allowed, and I is correctly placed. This will test four new letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Guess 2 (MIGHT): I is correct in position 2; all other letters (M,G,H,T) are x.
- Guess 3 (DISKO): I is correct in position 2; D,S,K,O are x.
- Guess 4 (QUIZZ): I is marked “-”, meaning I is in the word but not in position 3. L is marked “-”, meaning L is in the word but not in position 2. Q, U, Z are x.
- Guess 5 (FLIPS): I is marked “-”, confirming I is not in position 3. L is marked “-”, confirming L is not in position 2. F, P, S are x.

Thus far we know:
- I is in the word, and must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (not 2 or 3).
