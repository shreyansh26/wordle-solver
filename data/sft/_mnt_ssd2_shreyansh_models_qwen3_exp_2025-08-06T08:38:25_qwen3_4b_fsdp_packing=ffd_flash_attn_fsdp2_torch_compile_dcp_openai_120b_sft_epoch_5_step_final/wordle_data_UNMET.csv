### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback:
- C, R, A are not in the word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a new five‑letter word that includes N and E in different positions, avoids C, R, A, and tries new letters to gather more information.

The word **ENJOY** fits:
- Contains E (position 1) and N (position 2), satisfying the “wrong positions” clues.
- Uses new letters J, O, Y to test additional possibilities.
- No prohibited letters (C, R, A) appear.
