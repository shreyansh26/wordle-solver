### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback:

- From CRANE: C, A, N are not in the word; R and E are present but in wrong spots (R not position 2, E not position 5).
- From RULER: 
  * R at position 1 → wrong (so R is elsewhere).
  * U at position 2 → correct (U is fixed).
  * L is not in the word.
  * E at position 4 → correct.
  * R at position 5 → wrong (R is not at position 5).

Thus the secret word pattern is: _ U _ E _.  
Letters known to be absent: C, A, N, L.  
Letters known to be present: R (must be in position 3, the only remaining slot), U (position 2), E (position 4).  

So the word must fit the pattern _ U R E _. A common English word that matches is **BURER** (a type of sausage). It uses new letters B and R (duplicate R is allowed) and respects all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess should be “BURER”.

Thus the secret word pattern is: _ U _ E _.  
Letters known to be absent: C, A, N, L.  
Letters known to be present: R (must be in position 3, the only remaining slot), U (position 2), E (position 4).  

So the word must fit the pattern _ U R E _. A common English word that matches is **BURER** (a type of sausage). It uses new letters B and R (duplicate R is allowed) and respects all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess should be “BURER”.

We have the following feedback:

- From CRANE: C, A, N are not in the word; R and E are present but not in those positions.
- From RULER: U is correct at position 2, E is correct at position 4, R is correct at position 5, and L is not in the word.
- From BURER: B is not in the word; U, E, and R are confirmed at positions 2, 4, 5 respectively; the R at position 3 got a “-”, meaning R is elsewhere (already satisfied by position 5).

Thus the secret word pattern is **_ U _ E R**, with letters C, A, N, L, B ruled out.  
A common English word that fits this pattern and uses only allowed letters is **PURER** (P U R E R). It respects all known constraints and introduces a new letter P for further testing.

Therefore, the next guess should be “PURER”.

We have determined the secret word pattern is _ U _ E R. The letters confirmed not in the word are C, A, N, L, B, P. The letters confirmed present are U (position 2), E (position 4), R (position 5). The R at position 3 in previous guesses got a “-”, which is consistent with R being at position 5.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

We know from the first guess CRANE that:
- C, A, N are not in the secret word.
- R and E are in the word but are in the wrong positions (R cannot be position 2, E cannot be position 5).

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R and E in different positions, avoids C, A, N, and tests new letters. “RULER” fits: it contains R (positions 1 and 5) and E (position 4), respects the position constraints, and introduces U and L for additional information.

We have the following feedback:

- From CRANE: C, A, N are not in the word; R and E are present but in wrong spots (R not position 2, E not position 5).
- From RULER: 
  * R at position 1 → wrong (so R is elsewhere).
  * U at position 2 → correct (U is fixed).
  * L is not in the word.
  * E at position 4 → correct.
  * R at position 5 → wrong (R is not at position 5).

Thus the secret word pattern is: _ U _ E _.  
Letters known to be absent: C, A, N, L.  
Letters known to be present: R (must be in position 3, the only remaining slot), U (position 2), E (position 4).
