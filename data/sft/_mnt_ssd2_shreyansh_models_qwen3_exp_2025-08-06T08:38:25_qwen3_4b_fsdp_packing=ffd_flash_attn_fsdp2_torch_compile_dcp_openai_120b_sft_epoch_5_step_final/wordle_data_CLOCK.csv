We have confirmed the first three letters: C (position 1), L (position 2), O (position 3).  
All other letters tried so far (R, A, N, E, T, H, U, D, W) are not in the word.  

We need a word of the form **C L O _ _** using only letters not yet eliminated.  
A common English word fitting this pattern is **CLOUT** (C L O U T).  
However, we know from previous feedback that **U** and **T** are not in the word, so this guess would give incorrect information.  

We need a word that introduces two new letters while keeping the confirmed prefix.  
“CLOPS” (C L O P S) fits the pattern and uses letters P and S, which have not been tried and are not excluded.

Thus the next guess should be **CLOPS**.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the first letter is C and the letters R, A, N, E are not in the word at all. I need a new 5‑letter word starting with C that avoids those letters. ""CLOTH"" fits: C L O T H, none of the excluded letters appear.

Eliminated letters from previous guesses: R, A, N, E, T, H, U, D (all marked x).  

We need a word of the form **C L O _ _** using only letters not yet excluded.  
A common English word fitting this pattern is **CLOWN** (C L O W N).  
Letters W and N have not been ruled out yet, so this guess is valid.
