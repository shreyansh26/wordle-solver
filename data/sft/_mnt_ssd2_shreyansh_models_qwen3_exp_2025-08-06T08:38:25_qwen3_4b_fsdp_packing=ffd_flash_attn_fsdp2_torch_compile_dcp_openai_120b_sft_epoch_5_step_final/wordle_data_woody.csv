### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback:

- Guess 3 (BLOWS):

  * O → ✓ → O is correct and in the correct (third) position.
  * W → - → W is in the word but not in the fourth position.
  * S → x → S not in the word.

Thus the secret word pattern is: _ _ O _ _.  
W must appear somewhere other than the fourth slot, so either position 1, 2, or 5.  
We need a common English word using only the remaining letters (D, F, J, K, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z) and satisfying the pattern.  

The word **QUOOF** fits:
- Q, U, O, O, F are all allowed (none are eliminated).
- O is in the third position (matches the ✓).
- W is not in the fourth position (W is absent, so this is satisfied).
- No eliminated letters appear.

Therefore QUOOF is a valid next guess.

Thus the secret word pattern is: _ _ O _ _.  
W must appear somewhere other than the fourth slot, so either position 1, 2, or 5.  
We need a common English word using only the remaining letters (D, F, J, K, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z) and satisfying the pattern.  

The word **QUOOF** fits:
- Q, U, O, O, F are all allowed (none are eliminated).
- O is in the third position (matches the ✓).
- W is not in the fourth position (W is absent, so this is satisfied).
- No eliminated letters appear.

Therefore QUOOF is a valid next guess.

We have the following feedback:

- Guess 4 (QUOOF): Q, U, F are absent; O in position 3 is correct; the second O is marked “-”, meaning O appears elsewhere (we already have the correct O at position 3, so the word likely contains only one O). The “-” also indicates the second O is not at position 4, which is consistent with our prior knowledge.

Thus the secret word:
- Has O in the third position.
- Contains a W somewhere other than position 4.

We need a common 5‑letter English word using only the remaining letters {D, J, K, O, P, V, W, X, Y, Z} and satisfying the pattern _ _ O _ _.  
A suitable candidate is **WOOZY**:
- W is in the word (position 1, satisfying the “W not in position 4” rule).
- O is in the third position (matches the confirmed correct placement).
- The remaining letters O, Z, Y are all from the allowed set and have not been ruled out.

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

We have the following feedback:

  * O → ✓ → O is correct and in the correct (third) position.
  * W → - → W is in the word but not in the fourth position.
  * S → x → S not in the word.

Thus the secret word pattern is: _ _ O _ _.  
W must appear somewhere other than the fourth slot, so either position 1, 2, or 5.
