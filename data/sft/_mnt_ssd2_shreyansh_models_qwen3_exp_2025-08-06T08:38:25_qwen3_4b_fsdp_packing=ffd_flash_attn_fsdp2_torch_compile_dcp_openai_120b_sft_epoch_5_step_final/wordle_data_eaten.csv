### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback:
- C and R are not in the word.
- A, N, and E are in the word but each is in a different position than in “CRANE”.

So we need a new 5‑letter word that includes A, N, and E, avoids C and R, and places those letters in positions other than 3, 4, and 5 respectively.  
The word **ENACT** satisfies these constraints:
- Contains A, N, and E.
- Positions: E(1), N(2), A(3), C(4), T(5).  
  Here, A is not in position 3, N is not in position 2, and E is not in position 1 (all differ from the previous positions in “CRANE”).
- No C or R.

Thus “ENACT” is a valid next guess.

We have the following information:

- From guess 1 (CRANE): C and R are not in the word. A, N, and E are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in CRANE.
- From guess 2 (ENACT): 
  * E is correct in position 1.
  * N, A, and T are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in ENACT.
  * C is not in the word (already known).

Thus:
- Position 1 = **E**.
- The letters **A**, **N**, and **T** must appear in the remaining four positions, each in a different position than they were in ENACT (A ≠ 3, N ≠ 2, T ≠ 5).
- Letters **C** and **R** are ruled out entirely.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **EXALT**:
- E is at position 1 (matches the known correct placement).
- X is a filler letter that is not prohibited.
- A is at position 2 (allowed, since A cannot be at 3 or 5).
- L is a filler letter.
- T is at position 5 (allowed, since T cannot be at 5).

All letters are permissible, and the placement respects the previous feedback.

Therefore the next guess should be “EXALT”.

I need to start the game with an initial guess. A common opening word that contains a mix of common letters is **CRANE**. This will give me information about several frequent letters (C, R, A, N, E) and their positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
We know from the feedback:
- C and R are not in the word.
- A, N, and E are in the word but each is in a different position than in “CRANE”.

So we need a new 5‑letter word that includes A, N, and E, avoids C and R, and places those letters in positions other than 3, 4, and 5 respectively.  
The word **ENACT** satisfies these constraints:
- Contains A, N, and E.
- Positions: E(1), N(2), A(3), C(4), T(5).  
  Here, A is not in position 3, N is not in position 2, and E is not in position 1 (all differ from the previous positions in “CRANE”).
- No C or R.

Thus “ENACT” is a valid next guess.

Guess 2: ENACT -> FEEDBACK: E(✓) N(-) A(-) C(x) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
We have the following information:

- From guess 1 (CRANE): C and R are not in the word. A, N, and E are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in CRANE.
- From guess 2 (ENACT): 
  * E is correct in position 1.
  * N, A, and T are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in ENACT.
  * C is not in the word (already known).

Thus:
- Position 1 = **E**.
- The letters **A**, **N**, and **T** must appear in the remaining four positions, each in a different position than they were in ENACT (A ≠ 3, N ≠ 2, T ≠ 5).
- Letters **C** and **R** are ruled out entirely.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **EXALT**:
- E is at position 1 (matches the known correct placement).
- X is a filler letter that is not prohibited.
- A is at position 2 (allowed, since A cannot be at 3 or 5).
- L is a filler letter.
- T is at position 5 (allowed, since T cannot be at 5).

All letters are permissible, and the placement respects the previous feedback.

Therefore the next guess should be “EXALT”.

We have the following constraints from previous feedback:

- Position 1 is **E** (confirmed).
- Letters **A**, **N**, **T** are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in prior guesses:
  * A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → possible positions 4 or 5.
  * N cannot be in positions 2 or 4 → possible positions 3 or 5.
  * T cannot be in positions 5 or 4 → possible positions 2 or 3.
- Letters **C**, **R**, **X**, **L** are not in the word.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **EATON**:
- E is at position 1 (✓).
- A is at position 2 (allowed, not prohibited).
- T is at position 3 (allowed, not prohibited).
- O is a filler letter not ruled out.
- N is at position 5 (allowed, not prohibited).

Thus “EATON” fits every clue.
