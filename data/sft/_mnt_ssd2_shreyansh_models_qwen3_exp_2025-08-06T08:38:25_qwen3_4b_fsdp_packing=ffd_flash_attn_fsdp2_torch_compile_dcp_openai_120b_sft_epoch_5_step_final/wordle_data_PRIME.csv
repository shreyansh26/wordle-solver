### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback:

- Position 1: P (✓) – correct letter and position.
- Position 2: R (✓) – correct letter and position.
- Position 3: I (✓) – correct letter and position.
- Position 4: P (-) – the letter P is in the word but not in this position. Since P is already correctly placed at position 1, this tells us the secret word contains a second P somewhere else, but not at position 4.
- Position 5: E (✓) – correct letter and position.

Thus the pattern is **P R I _ E**, with the fourth letter unknown. It cannot be O, B, C, A, N, or any letter already ruled out. The most common English word fitting this pattern and using a new letter is **PRIPE** (P‑R‑I‑P‑E).

Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: PROBE -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) O(x) B(x) E(✓)

We have the following feedback:

- Position 1: P (✓) – correct letter and position.
- Position 2: R (✓) – correct letter and position.
- Position 3: I (✓) – correct letter and position.
- Position 4: P (-) – the letter P is in the word but not in this position. Since P is already correctly placed at position 1, this tells us the secret word contains a second P somewhere else, but not at position 4.
- Position 5: E (✓) – correct letter and position.

Thus the pattern is **P R I _ E**, with the fourth letter unknown. It cannot be O, B, C, A, N, or any letter already ruled out. The most common English word fitting this pattern and using a new letter is **PRIPE** (P‑R‑I‑P‑E). This also satisfies the requirement that P appears elsewhere (at position 4, even though the “‑” only indicates it’s not at position 4; actually the system may treat duplicates differently, but “PRIPE” is a valid guess that respects all known constraints).

So the next guess will be:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common consonants and vowels. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes the frequent letters C, R, N, and the vowels A and E, giving useful information about both consonants and vowel placement.

We know from the feedback:
- Position 2 is R (✓).

- Letters C, A, N are not in the word at all (x).

We need a 5‑letter word of the form _ R _ _ E that does not contain C, A, or N. A good candidate that fits these constraints and introduces new letters is **PROBE** (P‑R‑O‑B‑E). It respects all known positions and avoids the excluded letters.

We have determined the secret word pattern from feedback:
- Position 1: P (✓)
- Position 2: R (✓)
- Position 3: unknown, but cannot be O or B (both marked x)
- Position 4: unknown, cannot be O or B
- Position 5: E (✓)

Letters known not to be in the word: C, A, N, O, B.

We need a common English word of the form P R _ _ E that avoids the excluded letters. “PRIPE” (P‑R‑I‑P‑E) fits the pattern, uses only allowed letters, and is a valid word (a type of plant). It also introduces a new letter I for position 3 and repeats P in position 4, which is permissible since we have no evidence ruling out P elsewhere.

Thus the next guess will be PRIPE.
