### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From earlier feedback:
- R is in the word but not at positions 1, 2, or 3 → R must be at position 5.
- E is in the word but not at positions 4 or 5 → E cannot be at position 5 (already satisfied) and cannot be at 4 (already satisfied). So E could be at position 1 or 3.
- No letters C, N, V, L, T, G are in the word.

Thus the pattern is either _ A E _ R or _ A _ E R.

A common English word fitting the second pattern and using only unused letters is **MAKER** (M A K E R). It places E at position 3 and introduces new letters M and K, which we have no information about yet.

So the next guess should be MAKER.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
We know from the feedback:
- C and N are not in the word.
- R, A, and E are in the word but not in the positions they were guessed (R not in position 2, A not in position 3, E not in position 5).

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R, A, and E in different positions, avoids C and N, and introduces two new letters to gather more information.  
The word **RAVEL** fits:
- R is at position 1 (allowed).
- A is at position 2 (allowed).
- V and L are new letters (to test).
- E is at position 4 (allowed, since E cannot be at position 5).
All constraints are satisfied, so we will guess “RAVEL”.
