### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters. ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it includes frequently used letters C, R, A, N, and E, giving useful information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

We know from previous feedback that the letters C, R, A, N, E, M, I, G, H are not in the secret word. The letter T is in the word but not in position 5 (since it was marked “-” in “MIGHT”). Therefore the secret word must contain T somewhere in positions 1‑4, and all other letters must be chosen from the remaining alphabet (B, D, F, J, K, L, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z). A common five‑letter word meeting these constraints is **BLOST** (B‑L‑O‑S‑T), which places T at position 5 and thus would give a “-” again, but we need to test T’s exact position. To confirm, we should guess a word that puts T in a different spot, such as **STOMP** (S‑T‑O‑M‑P). This will tell us whether T belongs in position 2 and also test new letters O and M (both still unknown). The next guess will be “STOMP”.
