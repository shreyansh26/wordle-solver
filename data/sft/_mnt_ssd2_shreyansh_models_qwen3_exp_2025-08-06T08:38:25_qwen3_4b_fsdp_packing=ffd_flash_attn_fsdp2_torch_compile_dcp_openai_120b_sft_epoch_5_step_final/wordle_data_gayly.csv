### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback so far:
- From SLATE: S, T, E are not in the word; L and A are in the word but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
- From ALBUM: B, U, M are not in the word; A and L are still in the word but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
- From KALOR: K, O, R are not in the word; A is correct at position 2; L is in the word but not at position 3.

Combining these:
- Position 2 is definitely **A**.
- L cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 3 (duplicate), so L must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- Eliminated letters: S, T, E, B, U, M, K, O, R.
- Remaining possible letters: C, D, F, G, H, I, J, L, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus A already placed).

We need a 5‑letter English word with A at the second spot and L somewhere else, using only allowed letters.  
A good candidate is **LAPIN** (L A P I N):
- L is at position 1 (allowed).
- A is at position 2 (confirmed).
- P, I, N are new letters not yet ruled out.

Thus this guess will test L’s exact position and introduce three fresh letters.

I need to start the game with a valid 5‑letter English word. A good opening guess is a word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to gather useful information. “SLATE” includes two common consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E), which should give a solid baseline for the first feedback.

We know from the first guess:
- S, T, E are not in the word.
- L and A are in the word but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes L and A in different positions, and avoids S, T, E. “ALBUM” fits: it contains A (position 1) and L (position 2), both different from the previous positions, and uses only new letters B, U, M which haven’t been ruled out.

We have confirmed letters:

Eliminated letters: S, T, E, B, U, M.

We need a 5‑letter word containing both A and L, respecting those position constraints, and using only letters not yet eliminated.

The word **KALOR** fits:
- Contains A (position 2, allowed) and L (position 3, allowed).
- Uses new letters K, O, R, none of which have been ruled out.
