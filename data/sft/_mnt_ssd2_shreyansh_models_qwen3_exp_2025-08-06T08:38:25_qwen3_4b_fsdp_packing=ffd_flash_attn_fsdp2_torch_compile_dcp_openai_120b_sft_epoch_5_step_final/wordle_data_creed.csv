1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes frequently used letters C, R, A, N, and E, giving useful information for the next steps.

We know the secret word starts with C and R in the first two positions (C✓, R✓). The letter A is not in the word, nor is N. The letter E is in the word but not in the fifth position (E-). Therefore E must be in position 3 or 4.

We need a new 5‑letter word that keeps C and R in the first two spots, includes E in position 3 or 4, and avoids A and N. “CROES” (C‑R‑O‑E‑S) fits: it keeps C and R, places E at position 4, and introduces new letters O and S for more information while respecting the exclusions.

We have determined the secret word pattern from feedback:
- Position 1: C (correct)
- Position 2: R (correct)
- Position 4: E (correct)
- Positions 3 and 5 are unknown.
Letters known not to be in the word: A, N, O, S.
We need a word that keeps C, R, E in their correct spots and introduces new letters for positions 3 and 5 to gather more information. “CRUEL” fits: C‑R‑U‑E‑L, with U and L being untested letters and not among the excluded set.
