### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the secret word contains the letters R, N, and E, but each is in a different position than they appeared in “CRANE”. Specifically:
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Letters C and A are not in the word at all.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R, N, and E, respects those position restrictions, and introduces two new letters to gather more information.  
The word **NERVE** fits:
- Contains N, E, R, V, B.
- N is in position 1 (allowed, not 4).
- E appears in positions 2 and 5 (both allowed, not 5 for the second E).
- R is in position 3 (allowed, not 2).
- No prohibited letters (C, A) are present.
Thus “NERVE” is a valid next guess.

From the feedback:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common consonants and vowels. “CRANE” is a good opening guess because it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), giving useful information about the secret word’s letters and positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
We know from the feedback that the secret word contains the letters R, N, and E, but each is in a different position than they appeared in “CRANE”. Specifically:
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Letters C and A are not in the word at all.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R, N, and E, respects those position restrictions, and introduces two new letters to gather more information.  
The word **NERVE** fits:
- Contains N, E, R, V, B.
- N is in position 1 (allowed, not 4).
- E appears in positions 2 and 5 (both allowed, not 5 for the second E).
- R is in position 3 (allowed, not 2).
- No prohibited letters (C, A) are present.
Thus “NERVE” is a valid next guess.

From the feedback:
- Letters C, A, V are not in the word.
- R, N, E are in the word but not in the positions they appeared in the guesses.
  * R cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
  * N cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
  * E cannot be in positions 2, 5, or both positions 2 and 5 (the second E got a “-” again, so E is only at position 5).
Thus the secret word must have E at the 5th spot, R at position 1 or 4, and N at position 2 or 3 (but not 1 or 4).  

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **RENDS**:
- R is at position 1 (allowed).
- E is at position 2 (allowed, not prohibited) and also at position 5 (required).
- N is at position 3 (allowed).
- D and S are new letters to test.

This guess will confirm the exact positions of R, N, and E while introducing two fresh letters.

We have the following information from the feedback:

- Letters **C, A, V, D** are not in the secret word.
- Letters **R, N, E, S** are in the word.
- Position restrictions:
  * R cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 → R must be in position 4 or 5.
  * N cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 4 → N must be in position 2 or 5.
  * E cannot be in positions 2, 5, or both → E must be in position 1 or 3.
  * S cannot be in position 5 → S can be in positions 1‑4 but not 5.

We need a 5‑letter word that places R, N, E, S in allowed spots and introduces a new letter.

The word **SENRI** fits all constraints:
- S at position 1 (allowed),
- E at position 2 (allowed),
- N at position 3 (allowed),
- R at position 4 (allowed),
- I is a new letter not yet ruled out.

Thus “SENRI” is a valid next guess.

We have determined the exact positions for four letters:

- S is correct at position 1 (✓).
- R cannot be in positions 1‑4, so it must be at position 5.
- E cannot be in positions 2, 5, or both, so it must be at position 3.
- N cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5, leaving only position 2.

Thus the secret word follows the pattern **S N E _ R**.  
A common English word that fits this pattern is **SNICK** (S‑N‑I‑C‑K), where the fourth letter is a new candidate (C) and the fifth is R as required.

So we guess **SNICK**.

- Position 1: **S** (confirmed by ✓)
- Position 2: **N** (confirmed by ✓)

All other letters tried (R, E, D, V, I, C, K) have been marked as not in the word or in the wrong spot, leaving only the unused letters to fill positions 3‑5.

A common English word that fits the pattern **S N _ _ _** and uses only letters not yet ruled out is **SNOUT** (S‑N‑O‑U‑T). This satisfies all prior clues and introduces three new letters (O, U, T) for further testing.

Thus the next guess should be SNOUT.
