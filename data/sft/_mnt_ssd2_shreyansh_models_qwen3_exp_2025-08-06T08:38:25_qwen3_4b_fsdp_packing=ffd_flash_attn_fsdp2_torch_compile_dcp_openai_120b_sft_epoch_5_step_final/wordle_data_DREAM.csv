### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback:
- C and N are not in the word.
- R is correct at position 2.
- A and E are in the word but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively.

So the pattern is: _ R _ _ _. A must be somewhere other than position 3, and E somewhere other than position 5. Choosing a word that places A and E in new spots while respecting those constraints, “ERROR” fits:
- R is at position 2 (✓).
- A is at position 4 (allowed).
- E is at position 3 (allowed, not position 5).
- No C or N are present.

Combining:
- Position 2 = R (confirmed).
- The letter A must be somewhere other than positions 3 or 5.
- The letter E must be somewhere other than positions 1 or 5.

- A is not in the word, so it’s fine.
- No C, N, or O appear.

We have the following feedback:

- Position 2 is definitely **R** (✓ from all guesses).
- Letters **C, N, O, I** are not in the word.
- The letter **A** is in the word but not in position 3.
- The letter **E** is in the word but not in positions 1, 4, 5 (so it must be position 2 or 3). Since position 2 is already R, **E** must be at position 3.
- The letter **D** is in the word but not at position 3.
- There are three extra R’s in the guesses (second R in ERROR, third R in ERROR, and fifth R in RIDER) that are not in the correct spots, so the word contains **at least three R’s**.

Putting this together:
- Position 2 = R
- Position 3 = E
- D must be at position 1 or 5 (cannot be 2,3,4).  
  If D is at position 1, the pattern is **D R E _ _** with an R still needed.  
  If D is at position 5, the pattern is **_ R E _ D** with an R still needed.
- A must be at position 1 or 4 (cannot be 2,3,5).

The word **RIDER** fits all constraints:
- R at position 2, E at position 3.
- D at position 4 (allowed, not position 3).
- A at position 1 (allowed, not position 3).
- Contains three R’s (positions 1, 2, 5).

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- C and N are not in the word.
- R is correct at position 2.
- A and E are in the word but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively.

So the pattern is: _ R _ _ _. A must be somewhere other than position 3, and E somewhere other than position 5. Choosing a word that places A and E in new spots while respecting those constraints, “ERROR” fits:
- R is at position 2 (✓).
- A is at position 4 (allowed).
- E is at position 3 (allowed, not position 5).
- No C or N are present.

Thus “ERROR” is a valid next guess.

We have the following feedback:

- From guess 1 (CRANE): C is not in the word, R is correct at position 2, A is in the word but not at position 3, N is not in the word, E is in the word but not at position 5.
- From guess 2 (ERROR): E is in the word but not at position 1, R is correct at position 2, the second R is in the word but not at position 3, O is not in the word, and the third R is in the word but not at position 5.

Combining:
- Position 2 = R (confirmed).
- The letter A must be somewhere other than positions 3 or 5.
- The letter E must be somewhere other than positions 1 or 5.
- There are at least two R’s in the word (positions 2 and 3 or 2 and 4, etc.).
- Letters C, N, and O are ruled out.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **RIDER**:
- Pattern: R I D E R
- Position 2 = R (✓).
- E is at position 4 (allowed, not 1 or 5).
- A is not in the word, so it’s fine.
- No C, N, or O appear.
- Contains two R’s (positions 1 and 5), satisfying the “R present but wrong positions” clues.

Thus “RIDER” is a valid next guess.

We have the following feedback:

- Position 2 is definitely **R** (✓ from all guesses).
- Letters **C, N, O, I** are not in the word.
- The letter **A** is in the word but not in position 3.
- The letter **E** is in the word but not in positions 1, 4, 5 (so it must be position 2 or 3). Since position 2 is already R, **E** must be at position 3.
- The letter **D** is in the word but not at position 3.
- There are three extra R’s in the guesses (second R in ERROR, third R in ERROR, and fifth R in RIDER) that are not in the correct spots, so the word contains **at least three R’s**.

Putting this together:
- Position 2 = R
- Position 3 = E
- D must be at position 1 or 5 (cannot be 2,3,4).  
  If D is at position 1, the pattern is **D R E _ _** with an R still needed.  
  If D is at position 5, the pattern is **_ R E _ D** with an R still needed.
- A must be at position 1 or 4 (cannot be 2,3,5).

The word **RIDER** fits all constraints:
- R at position 2, E at position 3.
- D at position 4 (allowed, not position 3).
- A at position 1 (allowed, not position 3).
- Contains three R’s (positions 1, 2, 5).

Thus **RIDER** is a valid next guess.

We have determined the following from the feedback:

- Position 2 is definitely **R**.
- The word contains **A**, **D**, and **E**.
- **A** cannot be in positions 1, 3, 5 → must be position 4.
- **D** cannot be in positions 3 or 4 → can be position 1 or 5.
- **E** cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 → must be position 1 or 2. Since position 2 is R, **E** must be position 1.
- There are **three R’s** in the word (from the extra R marks), so another R must appear in position 5.

Thus the pattern is **E R _ A R** with **D** in the remaining slot (position 3). The only common English word fitting this pattern is **ERDAR**.

I will guess that word.

We have the following feedback:

- Position 2 is definitely **R** (✓ in all guesses).
- Position 4 is definitely **A** (✓ in guess 5).
- The letter **E** is in the word but cannot be in positions 1,2,3,4 (from earlier “-” marks). Therefore **E** must be at position 5.
- The letter **D** is in the word but cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (from “-” marks). The only remaining slot is position 1, so **D** must be at position 1.
- The word contains three R’s (from the extra “-” marks on R). We already have an R at position 2, and the pattern suggests a second R at position 5. The third R must appear elsewhere, but the only remaining slot (position 3) is already occupied by a letter we know is not R. This contradiction implies that the third R is actually at position 1, which is already D. This is only possible if the game treats D and R as the same letter, which is unlikely.

Given the constraints, the only common English word that fits the pattern **D R _ A E** with a valid third letter is **DRAPE** (D‑R‑A‑P‑E). This satisfies all known positions and avoids the R‑count issue by placing the extra R at position 5, which is not marked as a problem.

Thus the next guess should be **DRAPE**.
