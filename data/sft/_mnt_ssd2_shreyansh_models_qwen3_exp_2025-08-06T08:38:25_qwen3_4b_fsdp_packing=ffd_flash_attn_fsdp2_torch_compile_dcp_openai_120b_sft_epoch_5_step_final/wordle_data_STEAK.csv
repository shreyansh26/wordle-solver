### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from feedback that letters C, R, and N are not in the secret word. The letters A and E are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in “CRANE”: A is not in position 3, and E is not in position 5.  
We need a new 5‑letter word that includes A and E in different positions, avoids C, R, and N, and introduces new letters to test. “PALES” satisfies these conditions:
- Contains A (position 2) and E (position 4), both different from their previous spots.
- Uses only new letters P, L, S besides A and E.
- No C, R, or N.

- **A** cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3 → possible positions 4 or 5.
- **S** cannot be in position 5 (S - at position 5), so S can be in positions 1‑4.
- Letters eliminated (not in the word): C, R, N, P, L, D, T, and also the letters that got an “x” in earlier guesses: C, R, N, P, L, D, T.

4. Introduces fresh letters to gather more information.

The word **HEIST** fits all these criteria:

- S is fourth (not fifth).
- A is not present, which is fine because we are still testing its position.

We know from feedback that letters C, R, and N are not in the secret word. The letters A and E are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in “CRANE”: A is not in position 3, and E is not in position 5.  
We need a new 5‑letter word that includes A and E in different positions, avoids C, R, and N, and introduces new letters to test. “PALES” satisfies these conditions:
- Contains A (position 2) and E (position 4), both different from their previous spots.
- Uses only new letters P, L, S besides A and E.
- No C, R, or N.
Thus “PALES” is a valid next guess.

We have the following feedback:

- From CRANE: C, R, N are not in the word. A is in the word but not in position 3. E is in the word but not in position 5.
- From PALES: P, L, S are not in the word. A is still not in position 2. E is not in position 4.

Thus the secret word must contain **A** and **E**, with the constraints:
- A cannot be in positions 2, 3.
- E cannot be in positions 4, 5.

All other letters guessed so far (C, R, N, P, L, S) are ruled out.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes A and E in allowed spots and introduces three fresh letters to test.  
The word **ADEPT** satisfies all conditions:
- A is in position 1 (allowed).
- E is in position 3 (allowed).
- New letters D, P, T have not been tried yet.
- No forbidden letters appear.

Therefore the next guess is “ADEPT”.

We have the following constraints from previous feedback:

- The secret word contains **A**, **E**, and **S**.
- **E** is confirmed at position 3 (E ✓).
- **A** cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3 → possible positions 4 or 5.
- **S** cannot be in position 5 (S - at position 5), so S can be in positions 1‑4.
- Letters eliminated (not in the word): C, R, N, P, L, D, T, and also the letters that got an “x” in earlier guesses: C, R, N, P, L, D, T.

We need a new word that:
1. Has **E** in the third slot.
2. Places **A** in position 4 (or 5) to test its exact spot.
3. Includes **S** somewhere other than the fifth position.
4. Introduces fresh letters to gather more information.

The word **HEIST** fits all these criteria:
- Pattern H E I S T → E is third.
- S is fourth (not fifth).
- A is not present, which is fine because we are still testing its position.
- New letters H, I, and T have not been tried yet.

Thus “HEIST” is a logical next guess.

We have the following feedback:

- From CRANE: C, R, N are not in the word; A and E are in the word but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively.
- From PALES: P, L are not in the word; A is still not in position 2; E is not in position 4; S is in the word but not in position 5.
- From ADEPT: D, P, H, I are not in the word; E is confirmed at position 3; A is not in position 1; T is in the word but not in position 5.
- From HEIST: H, I are not in the word; E is still not in position 2; S is not in position 4; T is not in position 4.

Thus the secret word must contain the letters **A, E, S, T** plus one additional letter (not any of the excluded ones).  
Position constraints:
- E is fixed at position 3.
- A cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3 → possible positions 4 or 5.
- S cannot be in positions 4 or 5 → possible positions 1, 2.
- T cannot be in positions 4 or 5 → possible positions 1, 2.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **SABLE**:
- S in position 1 (allowed),
- A in position 2 (allowed),
- E in position 3 (confirmed),
- B is a new allowed letter,
- L is not excluded and appears in position 5 (allowed for A).

All letters comply with the feedback, so “SABLE” is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the constraints from previous feedback:

- Position 1: S (confirmed from SABLE).
- Position 3: E (confirmed from ADEPT).
- A cannot be in positions 1‑3, so it must be in position 4 or 5.
- T cannot be in positions 4‑5, so it must be in position 2.
- Remaining unknown letters are positions 2, 4, 5 (with T fixed at 2) and a fifth letter that hasn’t been ruled out.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **STEAK**:
- S (✓) at position 1,
- T at position 2 (allowed),
- E (✓) at position 3,
- A at position 4 (allowed),
- K at position 5 (new, not excluded).

Thus the next guess should be “STEAK”.
