### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback:
- Position 1 is S (correct).
- L, A, and E are not in the word.
- T is in the word but not in position 4.

So the secret word looks like: S _ _ _ _.  
We need a new word that keeps S in the first spot, includes T somewhere other than the fourth position, and avoids L, A, and E.

A good candidate is **STORM**:
- Starts with S.
- Contains T in position 2 (acceptable).
- Uses new letters O, R, M which we have no information about yet.
- Contains none of the excluded letters L, A, or E.

Thus we will guess “STORM”.

We have the following confirmed information:
- Position 1 = S (✓ from both guesses).
- Position 3 = O (✓ from guess 2).
- Position 4 = R (✓ from guess 2).
- Letter T is in the word but not in positions 2 or 4 (‑ from both guesses). Since positions 1, 3, 4 are already fixed, the only remaining spot for T is position 5.
- Letters L, A, E, M are not in the word (x from guesses).

Thus the pattern is **S _ O R T**.  
A common English word that fits this pattern is **SPORT**.

We will guess that word.
