### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A word that fits is **BEAMS**:
- B (new), E (position 1, allowed), A (position 3, allowed), M (new), S (new).
All letters are permissible and the placement respects the constraints.

Thus the next guess will be BEAMS.

We have confirmed letters:
- A is in the word, but not in positions 2, 3, or 3 (duplicate). So A can be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- E is in the word, but not in positions 1, 4, or 5. So E can be in position 2 or 3.

All other letters tried (S, L, T, C, N, D, B, M) are not in the word.

We need a word that places A and E in allowed spots and introduces new letters to test.  
A good candidate is **EARTH**:
- E in position 1 (allowed, since E only cannot be 1 from previous feedback? Wait no: feedback showed E(-) at position 1 in BEAMS, meaning E is in the word but not at position 1. So E cannot be position 1.  
Thus E must be position 2 or 3.  

Choosing **EAGLE**:
- E at position 2 (allowed)
- A at position 3 (allowed)
- Introduces new letters G, L, and repeats E/A, giving useful information about the remaining letters.

So the next guess will be EAGLE.

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

We know from the feedback that the secret word does NOT contain the letters S, L, or T. It DOES contain the letters A and E, but A is NOT in the third position and E is NOT in the fifth position (the positions they occupied in “SLATE”).  

We need a new guess that includes A and E in different positions, and introduces new letters to test.  
A good candidate is **CANED**:
- A is now in position 2 (different from position 3).
- E is now in position 4 (different from position 5).
- It adds the fresh letters C, N, and D for further clues.
