### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback:
- C and N are not in the word.
- R, A, and E are in the word but each is in the wrong position relative to the guess “CRANE”.
Thus:
- R cannot be in position 2.
- A cannot be in position 3.
- E cannot be in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R, A, and E in different positions, and avoids C and N.  
A good candidate is **RAGED**:
- R is in position 1 (allowed).
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since A was wrong at position 3).
- G and D fill the remaining spots without using C or N.

We have the following information from feedback:

- Letters not in the word: C, N, G, D.
- A is correct in position 2.
- E is correct in position 4.
- R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2, and also not in position 1 from the second guess, so R can be in position 3 or 5.
- No other letters have been confirmed.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern: _ A _ E _.  
R must occupy either the 3rd or 5th slot.

A word that satisfies all these constraints and uses only allowed letters is **SAYER**:
- S A Y E R → A is in position 2, E in position 4, R in position 5 (both allowed).
- No prohibited letters (C, N, G, D) appear.

Therefore the next guess should be “SAYER”.

- A cannot be in position 3.
- E cannot be in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R, A, and E in different positions, and avoids C and N.  
A good candidate is **RAGED**:
- R is in position 1 (allowed).
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since A was wrong at position 3).
- G and D fill the remaining spots without using C or N.
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since E was wrong at position 5).

This guess will test the remaining possibilities while respecting all known constraints.

We have the following information from feedback:

- Letters not in the word: C, N, G, D.
- A is correct in position 2.
- E is correct in position 4.
- R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2, and also not in position 1 from the second guess, so R can be in position 3 or 5.
- No other letters have been confirmed.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern: _ A _ E _.  
R must occupy either the 3rd or 5th slot.

A word that satisfies all these constraints and uses only allowed letters is **SAYER**:
- S A Y E R → A is in position 2, E in position 4, R in position 5 (both allowed).
- No prohibited letters (C, N, G, D) appear.

Therefore the next guess should be “SAYER”.

- Letters C, N, G, D, S, Y are not in the word.
- R cannot be in positions 1 or 2, already placed at 5.
Thus the word looks like _ A _ E R.

We need a common 5‑letter English word matching that pattern and using only letters not ruled out. “FAKER” fits perfectly:
F A K E R
- F and K have not been eliminated.
- Positions: 1 F, 2 A, 3 K, 4 E, 5 R match the known constraints.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

We know from the feedback:
- C and N are not in the word.
- R, A, and E are in the word but each is in the wrong position relative to the guess “CRANE”.
Thus:
- R cannot be in position 2.
- A cannot be in position 3.
- E cannot be in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R, A, and E in different positions, and avoids C and N.
