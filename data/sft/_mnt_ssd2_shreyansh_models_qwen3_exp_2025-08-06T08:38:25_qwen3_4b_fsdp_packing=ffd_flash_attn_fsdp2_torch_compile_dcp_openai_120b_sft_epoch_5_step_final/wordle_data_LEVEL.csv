### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Choosing a word with common letters will give more information. “SLEPT” uses S, L, E, P, T, all of which are still possible, and puts E in the third position, satisfying the requirement.

We have eliminated letters C, R, A, N, S, P, T (all marked x).  
We know E is in the word but not in positions 3 or 5 (from both guesses).  
L is in the word but not in position 2 (feedback “-” on guess 2).  

Thus the secret word must contain **E** and **L**, with:
- E allowed in positions 1, 2, or 4.
- L allowed in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2).

We need a valid 5‑letter word using only the remaining letters (B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z) and satisfying those position constraints.

The word **BELL** fits:
- Contains L (positions 3 and 5) – both are allowed (L not in position 2).
- Contains E (position 2) – allowed (E not in 3 or 5).
- Uses only allowed letters (B, E, L).

Therefore “BELL” is a good next guess.
