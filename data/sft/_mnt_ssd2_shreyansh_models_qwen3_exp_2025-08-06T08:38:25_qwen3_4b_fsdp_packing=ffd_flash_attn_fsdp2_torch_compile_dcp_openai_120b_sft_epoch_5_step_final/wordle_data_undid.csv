### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, Y, B, T, S, plus any letters marked x. Remaining possible letters are D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

From previous feedback:
- N is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 (from CRONY and BUNTS).
- U is in the word but not in position 2 (from BUNTS).

We need a 5‑letter word using only allowed letters, containing N and U, respecting those position restrictions, and using three other allowed letters.

The word **MUNNI** fits:
- Contains N (positions 3 and 5) – not in 3 or 4.
- Contains U in position 2 – not position 2 (actually U is at position 2, which matches the “U(-)” clue that it is in the word but not at position 2? Wait, this seems contradictory. Let me check again.

Wait, the feedback for BUNTS was:
- B(x) – not in word
- U(-) – U is in the word but not in position 2.
- N(-) – N is in the word but not in position 3.
- T(x) – not in word
- S(x) – not in word

Thus U cannot be in position 2, and N cannot be in position 3.

The word **MUNNI** has U in position 2, which violates the “U(-)” clue. Therefore MUNNI is invalid.

We need a word with U not in position 2 and N not in positions 3 or 4. A good candidate is **UNZIP**:
- U at position 1 (allowed)
- N at position 2 (allowed)
- Z, I, P are new letters not yet ruled out.

All letters are from the allowed set, and the position constraints are satisfied. This guess will test the remaining unknown letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial 5‑letter guess. A good opening word contains common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to gather useful information. ""SLATE"" is a popular starter word that includes two common vowels (A, E) and frequent consonants (S, L, T). I'll use that as my first guess.

We have determined the secret word layout from previous feedback:

Letters known not to be in the word: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, Y, B, T, S, Z, P, and also the letters that received an “x” in earlier guesses (S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, Y, B, Z, P). The only remaining unknown slot is position 3, and it must be a letter that hasn’t been eliminated.

Possible remaining letters include D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, and possibly others like N or U if duplication is allowed (but we have no evidence for that yet). To test a common letter that hasn’t been ruled out, I will guess **UNNIX** (U N N I X), which keeps the known correct letters in place and introduces the new letter X in position 5 while also checking if N appears a second time.
