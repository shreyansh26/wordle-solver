### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a valid 5‑letter English word. A good opening guess is a word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels to get useful information. ""CRANE"" is a popular starter because it includes two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E). I'll use that as my first guess.

From the first feedback:
- C is not in the word.
- A is not in the word.
- R, N, and E are in the word but not in the positions they were guessed (R not in position 2, N not in position 4, E not in position 5).

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R, N, and E in different positions, and avoids C and A.  
A good candidate is **RENDS**:
- R is at position 1 (different from position 2).
- E is at position 2 (different from position 5).
- N is at position 3 (different from position 4).
- It adds D and S as new letters to test other possibilities.

We know:
- Position 1 = R (✓)
- Position 2 = E (✓)
- Letter N is in the word but not at position 3 (‑) → N can be at 4 or 5.
- Letter S is in the word but not at position 5 (‑) → S can be at 3 or 4.
- Letters C, A, D are not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word starting with “RE”, containing N and S in allowed spots, and using a new fifth letter that isn’t excluded.  
The word **RESIN** fits:
- R (1) ✓, E (2) ✓
- S at position 3 (allowed, not 5)
- I at position 4 (new letter, not excluded)
- N at position 5 (allowed, not 3)

Thus RESIN is a valid next guess.
