### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial 5‑letter guess. A good opening word contains common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to gather information.

We know from the first feedback:
- C and N are not in the word.
- R, A, and E are in the word but not in the positions they were guessed (R not in position 2, A not in position 3, E not in position 5).

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R, A, and E in different positions, avoids C and N, and tries new letters to gather more information. “RAVEL” (R‑A‑V‑E‑L) satisfies these constraints:
- R is at position 1 (different from position 2).

Thus the pattern is **A E R A E**. A common English word fitting this pattern is **AERAE** (an archaic term for “air”). This uses only letters we know are present and avoids the excluded letters C, N, V, L, X, T. It also tests whether a second A and a second E are in the secret word.

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial 5‑letter guess. A good opening word contains common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to gather information. ""CRANE"" is a frequently used starter in word‑guessing games because it includes the common vowel ""A"" and frequently occurring consonants C, R, N, and E. This should give me useful feedback for the next steps.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
We know from the first feedback:
- C and N are not in the word.
- R, A, and E are in the word but not in the positions they were guessed (R not in position 2, A not in position 3, E not in position 5).

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R, A, and E in different positions, avoids C and N, and tries new letters to gather more information. “RAVEL” (R‑A‑V‑E‑L) satisfies these constraints:
- R is at position 1 (different from position 2).
- A is at position 2 (different from position 3).
- E is at position 4 (different from position 5).
- It introduces new letters V and L to test.

Thus “RAVEL” is a good next guess.

Guess 2: RAVEL -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) V(x) E(-) L(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
We have the following constraints from feedback:
- Letters C, N, V, L are not in the word.
- Letters R, A, E are in the word but not in the positions they appeared in the guesses:
  * R cannot be in positions 1 (from RAVEL) or 2 (from CRANE).
  * A cannot be in positions 2 (from RAVEL) or 3 (from CRANE).
  * E cannot be in positions 4 (from RAVEL) or 5 (from CRANE).

We need a new word that includes R, A, E in allowed positions and introduces new letters to test.  
The word **EXTRA** fits:
- Positions: E(1), X(2), T(3), R(4), A(5)
- E is not in positions 1 or 5 (both disallowed), but position 1 is allowed.
- R is not in positions 1 or 2, and now it’s in position 4 (allowed).
- A is not in positions 2 or 3, and now it’s in position 5 (allowed).
- New letters X and T give fresh information.

Thus “EXTRA” is a valid next guess.

Guess 3: EXTRA -> FEEDBACK: E(-) X(x) T(x) R(-) A(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
We have determined the allowed positions for the letters R, A, and E based on the feedback:

- **R** cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 4 → possible positions: 3 or 5  
- **A** cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 → possible positions: 1 or 4  
- **E** cannot be in positions 1, 4, or 5 → possible positions: 2 or 3  

The only arrangement that satisfies all constraints is:
- Position 1 = A  
- Position 2 = E  
- Position 3 = R  
- Position 4 = A (duplicate A is allowed)  
- Position 5 = E  

Thus the pattern is **A E R A E**. A common English word fitting this pattern is **AERAE** (an archaic term for “air”). This uses only letters we know are present and avoids the excluded letters C, N, V, L, X, T. It also tests whether a second A and a second E are in the secret word.

So the next guess is:

We have the following feedback:

- From guess 1 (CRANE): C and N are not in the word; R, A, E are present but in wrong spots.
- From guess 2 (RAVEL): V and L are not in the word; R, A, E still present, just not in those positions.
- From guess 3 (EXTRA): X and T are not in the word; R, A, E still present.
- From guess 4 (AERAE): A(-) at position 1 means A is in the word but not at position 1; E(-) at position 2 means E is in the word but not at position 2; R(-) at position 3 means R is in the word but not at position 3; A(✓) at position 4 tells us that the fourth letter is A; E(-) at position 5 means E is in the word but not at position 5.

From these clues:
- The fourth letter is A.
- E cannot be in positions 1, 2, 5 → must be in position 3.
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3 → must be in position 5.
- The only remaining slot (position 1) must be an E, because we know an E is somewhere else (position 3) and we cannot place another E at position 5.

Thus the secret word has the pattern **E E R A R**.  
A common English word that fits this pattern is **EERAR** (a surname, though rare). It uses only letters we have confirmed (E, R, A) and respects all positional constraints.

Therefore the next guess should be “EERAR”.

We have determined the exact positions for three letters:
- Position 4 is A (confirmed by AERAE).
- Position 5 is R (confirmed by EERAR).
- Position 3 is E (the only remaining spot for E after eliminating positions 1, 2, 5).

Thus the secret word fits the pattern **_ _ E A R**.

Letters known to be in the word: A, E, R.  
Letters known to be absent: C, N, V, L, X, T, and also the first two positions cannot be E (E(-) at position 1) and cannot be R (R(-) at position 1).

A common English word that matches **_ _ E A R** and uses only allowed letters is **SHARE** (S‑H‑E‑A‑R).

This guess will test the remaining two letters (S and H) while keeping the known correct letters in place.
