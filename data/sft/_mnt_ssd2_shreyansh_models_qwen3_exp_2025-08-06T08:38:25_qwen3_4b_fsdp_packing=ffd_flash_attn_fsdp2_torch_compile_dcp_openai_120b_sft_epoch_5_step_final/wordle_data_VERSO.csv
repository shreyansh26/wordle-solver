### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback:
- The letter **E** is correct in position 2 (✓).
- The letter **S** is in the word but not in positions 1 or 3 (both gave “-”). It could be in position 4 or 5.
- Letters **L, A, T, N, D** are not in the word.

We need a 5‑letter word with **E** as the second letter, containing **S** in position 4 or 5, and avoiding the excluded letters.  
A good candidate is **MOUSE** (M‑O‑U‑S‑E):  
- E is in position 5, which is allowed (the only known restriction is E not being in position 5 from the first guess, but that was a “‑”, meaning E exists elsewhere, not that it cannot be in position 5).  
- S appears in position 4, satisfying the requirement that S is present but not in positions 1 or 3.  
- No forbidden letters (L, A, T, N, D) appear.

Thus we will guess “MOUSE”.

We have the following constraints from feedback:

- Position 4 is **S** (green check in “MOUSE”).
- The letter **O** is in the word but not in position 2 (yellow from “MOUSE”).
- Letters **L, A, T, N, D, M, U** are not in the word.

A common English word that satisfies all these constraints is **EXPOS**:

- E is in position 2, S in position 4, O is present (pos4) and not in position 2.

- Letters that are NOT in the word: L, A, T, N, D, M, U, X, P, and also from “EXPOS” we know E is not at position 1 and O is not at position 4.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters. “SLATE” is a good starter because it includes frequently used letters S, L, A, T, and E, giving useful information about the secret word’s composition and positions.

We know from the first guess SLATE that:
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- L, A, and T are not in the word at all.

We need a new five‑letter word that includes S and E, places them in different positions than before, and avoids L, A, T. “SENDS” fits: it contains S (position 3) and E (position 2), neither of which conflict with the known constraints, and it uses only new letters (N, D) that haven’t been ruled out.

We have determined the secret word contains the letters S, E, O, V, and R, each in a specific position:

- S is confirmed at position 4.
- E is confirmed at position 2.
- O is confirmed at position 3.
- V is confirmed at position 1.
- R is confirmed at position 5.

Thus the word pattern is **V E O S R**. The only common English word fitting this pattern is **VEOSSR**, which is not a standard word. The next logical step is to guess the most likely common word that matches the known letters and positions, even if it is not a perfect fit, to gain more information.

The best candidate is **VERSO** (a term meaning “turned around” or “reversed”). It fits the pattern V E O S R except for the last letter, giving us a chance to test whether the final letter is R or something else.
