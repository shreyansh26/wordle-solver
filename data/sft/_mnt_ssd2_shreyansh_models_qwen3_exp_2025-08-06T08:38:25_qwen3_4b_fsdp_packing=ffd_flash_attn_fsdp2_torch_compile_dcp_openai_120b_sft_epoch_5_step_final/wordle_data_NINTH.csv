### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback:

- From CRANE: C, R, A, E are not in the word; N is in the word but not in position 4.
- From NIGHT: N is correct in position 1, I is correct in position 2, G is not in the word, H and T are in the word but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.

Thus the secret word pattern is:
1 N, 2 I, ? ? ?, ? ? ?
H must be somewhere other than position 4, and T must be somewhere other than position 5.

A word that satisfies all constraints and uses only allowed letters is **NIGHT** (positions 1 N, 2 I, 3 G is disallowed, so no). Wait, G is excluded, so that doesn’t work.

Next candidate: **NUTTY** (N U T T Y). This places N at 1, I is already at 2, so it keeps the known correct letters. It introduces U and Y, which haven’t been ruled out, and places T at positions 3 and 4, which is allowed (T is not at 5). This guess will test the remaining unknown letters while respecting all constraints.

The feedback tells us that C, R, A, and E are not in the secret word, while N is present but not in the 4th position. Therefore the next guess must include N in a different slot (1,2,3, or 5) and avoid C, R, A, E entirely. I’ll choose a common word that satisfies these constraints: “NIGHT”. It places N in the first position and uses only letters (I, G, H, T) that haven’t been ruled out.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: NIGHT -> FEEDBACK: N(✓) I(✓) G(x) H(-) T(-)

We have the following feedback:

- From CRANE: C, R, A, E are not in the word; N is in the word but not in position 4.
- From NIGHT: N is correct in position 1, I is correct in position 2, G is not in the word, H and T are in the word but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.

Thus the secret word pattern is:
1 N, 2 I, ? ? ?, ? ? ?
H must be somewhere other than position 4, and T must be somewhere other than position 5.

A word that satisfies all constraints and uses only allowed letters is **NIGHT** (positions 1 N, 2 I, 3 G is disallowed, so no). Wait, G is excluded, so that doesn’t work.

Next candidate: **NUTTY** (N U T T Y). This places N at 1, I is already at 2, so it keeps the known correct letters. It introduces U and Y, which haven’t been ruled out, and places T at positions 3 and 4, which is allowed (T is not at 5). This guess will test the remaining unknown letters while respecting all constraints.

The remaining unknown positions are 3 and 5. H must occupy one of them (since it cannot be position 4). The other slot can be any unused letter that hasn’t been ruled out.

A common English word that fits the pattern N I _ T _ and places H at position 5 is **NIGHT**. This will test whether H belongs at position 5 and also check a new letter (the second G, which is already known not to be correct).

Thus the next guess is NIGHT.
