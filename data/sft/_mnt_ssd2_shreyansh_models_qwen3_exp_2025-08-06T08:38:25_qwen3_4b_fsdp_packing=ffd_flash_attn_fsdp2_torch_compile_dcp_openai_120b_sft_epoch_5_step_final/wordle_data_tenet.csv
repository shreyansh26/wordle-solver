### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the secret word pattern from previous feedback:

- Position 2 is **E** (confirmed by VENOM).
- Position 3 is **N** (confirmed by LUNGE and VENOM).
- Positions 1, 4, 5 are unknown, but we know letters C, R, A, L, U, G, V, O, M are not in the word.
- The word must contain the letters N and E (already placed) and cannot contain any of the excluded letters.

A common English word that fits the pattern _ E N _ _ and uses only allowed letters is **DENIM** (D E N I M). It introduces three new letters (D, I, M) that have not been tested yet.

Thus the next guess should be “DENIM”.

From the first feedback:
- C, R, A are not in the word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes N and E in different positions (not 4 for N, not 5 for E) and avoids C, R, A. “LUNGE” fits: L U N G E (N at position 3, E at position 5, no prohibited letters). This will test the remaining letters L, U, G.
