### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the secret word pattern from feedback:
- Position 3 is D (✓ from RIDER).
- Position 4 is E (✓ from RIDER).
- Position 5 is R (✓ from RIDER).
- Letters C, A, N, I are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (from CRANE) and also not in position 2 from RIDER, which is already satisfied by R being at position 5.
Thus the word must be of the form __DER, with the first two letters not being R or any excluded letters.

A common English word fitting this pattern is **SHERD** (S H E R D). It introduces new letters S and H while keeping the known D‑E‑R ending and respecting all exclusions.

Therefore the next guess is SHERD.

Guess 2: RIDER -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) D(✓) E(✓) R(✓)

We have determined the secret word pattern from feedback:
- Position 3 is D (✓ from RIDER).
- Position 4 is E (✓ from RIDER).
- Position 5 is R (✓ from RIDER).
- Letters C, A, N, I are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (from CRANE) and also not in position 2 from RIDER, which is already satisfied by R being at position 5.
Thus the word must be of the form __DER, with the first two letters not being R or any excluded letters.

A common English word fitting this pattern is **SHERD** (S H E R D). It introduces new letters S and H while keeping the known D‑E‑R ending and respecting all exclusions.

Therefore the next guess is SHERD.

We have the following feedback:

- From CRANE: C, A, N are not in the word; R and E are in the word but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.
- From RIDER: D is correct at position 3, E is correct at position 4, R is correct at position 5. The R in position 1 got a “-”, confirming R is not at position 1; I is not in the word.
- From SHERD: S and H are not in the word; E at position 3 got a “-”, meaning E is elsewhere (already known to be at position 4); R at position 5 got a “-”, which is consistent with the earlier “✓” at position 5; D at position 5 got a “-”, meaning D is not at position 5 (already satisfied because D is at position 3).

Thus the confirmed pattern is **_ _ D E R**.  
Excluded letters so far: C, A, N, I, S, H, plus any letters shown as “x”.  
We need a common 5‑letter English word fitting **??DER** with new letters for positions 1 and 2.

A suitable word is **TODER** (T O D E R). It respects all constraints and introduces two fresh letters (T and O) to test.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess (CRANE) that:
- C, A, N are not in the secret word.
- R and E are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in CRANE (R is not in position 2, E is not in position 5).

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R and E in different positions, and avoids C, A, N. A good candidate is **RIDER**:
- R appears in positions 1 and 5 (neither is position 2).
- E appears in position 4 (not position 5).
- No prohibited letters C, A, N are used.

Thus RIDER satisfies all constraints and gives us fresh letters to test.
