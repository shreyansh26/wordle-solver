### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From guess 4 (RODEO), O at position 5 got “-”, meaning O is in the word but not at position 5. Since we already have O at position 2, the secret likely contains only one O, so the extra O at position 5 is not correct.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial 5‑letter guess. I'll choose a common word that contains a mix of common letters to get useful feedback. ""CRANE"" is a good starter.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
We know from the feedback:
- C, A, N are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a new guess that includes R and E in different positions (avoiding the forbidden spots) and introduces new letters to test. “RELIT” places R at position 1 and E at position 2, both allowed, and adds L, I, T for more information.

Guess 2: RELIT -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(-) L(x) I(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
We know:
- R is correct at position 1 (✓).
- E is in the word but not at positions 2 or 5 (both gave “-”).
- Letters C, A, N, L, I, T are not in the word.
Thus E must be at position 3 or 4.

We need a new word that keeps R in the first spot, places E in one of those allowed spots, and introduces new letters to test.  
Choosing **RHEUM** gives:
- R at position 1 (maintains known correct spot).
- E at position 3 (allowed).
- New letters H, U, M to gather more information.
All letters are permissible (none are excluded).

So the next guess is “RHEUM”.

We have confirmed that the first letter is R (✓).  
E is in the word but cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (all gave “-”), so E must be in position 4.  

All letters marked “x” (C, A, N, L, I, T, H, U, M) are not in the word.  

Thus the pattern is: **R _ _ E _** with the remaining letters to choose from being any not excluded. A common English word fitting this pattern is **RODEO** (R‑O‑D‑E‑O). It uses only allowed letters and places E correctly at position 4.

So the next guess should be “RODEO”.
