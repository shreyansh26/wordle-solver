### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Thus the secret word pattern is: _ I _ T Y.

Excluded letters (cannot appear anywhere): C, R, A, N, E, M, G, H, S, F.

We need a valid 5‑letter word fitting the pattern, using only letters not excluded, and containing no C,R,A,N,E,M,G,H,S,F.

Possible candidates:
- PITY? (P I T Y) → only 4 letters, not 5.
- BITY? (B I T Y) → not a standard word.
- DITTY (D I T T Y) → fits pattern, uses D (allowed) and repeats T (allowed). No excluded letters.

“DITTY” satisfies all constraints and is a common English word.

Therefore the next guess should be DITTY.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The first guess CRANE had all letters marked as not in the word (x). Therefore the secret word contains none of C, R, A, N, or E. I need a new 5‑letter word using only letters outside that set. Choosing a common word with varied letters will give the most information. “MIGHT” uses M, I, G, H, T, all of which are allowed, and includes a mix of consonants and a vowel.

We know:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, M, G, H are not in the word.
- I is correct at position 2.
- T is in the word but not at position 5 (from “T(-)” in guess 2).

We need a 5‑letter word with I in the second slot, containing T somewhere other than the fifth slot, and using only letters not ruled out.

The word **SIFTY** fits:
- Pattern: S I F T Y → I is in position 2.
- T is in position 4 (not position 5).
- All letters (S, I, F, T, Y) are allowed (none are among the excluded letters).

Thus SIFTY is a valid next guess.
