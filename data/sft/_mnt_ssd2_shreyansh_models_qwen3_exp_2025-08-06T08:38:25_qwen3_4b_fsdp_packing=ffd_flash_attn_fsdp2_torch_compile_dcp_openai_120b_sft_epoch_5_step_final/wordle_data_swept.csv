### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial 5‑letter guess. A good opening word uses common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to give useful feedback. “CRANE” is a popular starter because it contains the common vowel ‘A’ and frequent consonants ‘C’, ‘R’, and ‘N’. I’ll use that as my first guess.

We have the following feedback:
- From CRANE: C, R, A, N are not in the word; E is present but not in position 5.
- From SLEPT: S is correct in position 1; L is not in the word; E is correct in position 3; P is correct in position 4; T is correct in position 5.

Thus the secret word must be of the form **S _ E P T**, with the second letter still unknown. It cannot be any of the letters that were marked absent (C, R, A, N, L). The only common English word that fits this pattern is **SHEPT** (past tense of “sheep”). The letter H has not been ruled out yet, so this is a valid next guess.
