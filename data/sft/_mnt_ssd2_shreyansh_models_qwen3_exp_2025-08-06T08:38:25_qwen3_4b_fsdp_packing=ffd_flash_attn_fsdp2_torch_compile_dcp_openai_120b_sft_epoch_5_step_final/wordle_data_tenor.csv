### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Letters C, A, D, S are not in the word.
- E is correct at position 2.

- R is in the word but not at positions 1 or 2, so R must be at position 4 or 5.

A common English word fitting this pattern is **VENOM** (V E N O M), where R is not present, but we can test new letters V, O, M while keeping E and N fixed.

- Position 2 = E (confirmed)

- R is in the word but cannot be in positions 1,2,4,5 (from earlier feedback), so R must be position 3, but position 3 is N. Contradiction, meaning our earlier assumption that R is present is wrong? Or there's a mistake in reasoning.

Wait, actually from the first guess CRANE we have R(-) meaning R is in the word but not in position 2. From guess RENDS we have R(-) meaning R is in the word but not in position 1. Therefore R cannot be in positions 1 or 2. Positions 3,4,5 are already N, O, and unknown. If R is not in the word, then the feedback “R(-)” was a mistake? Or maybe the secret word does not contain R, and the “-” just indicates the letter exists elsewhere. No, the rules say “-” means the letter is in the word but not in that position. So R must be somewhere else.

But positions 2,3,4,5 are E, N, O, and unknown, and position 1 is still unknown. The only remaining slot for R is position 1. Let’s try that.

We have pattern _ E N O _. A common English word fitting this pattern is **FENOM** (a type of plant). It places R at position 1, satisfying the earlier constraints, and introduces a new letter F at position 1 and M at position 5 to test.

1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

“RENDS” (R‑E‑N‑D‑S) satisfies these constraints:
- R is now in position 1 (was 2nd before).
- E is now in position 2 (was 5th before).
- N is now in position 3 (was 4th before).
- It introduces new letters D and S for further clues.
Thus “RENDS” is a valid next guess.

We know from previous feedback:
- Letters C, A, D, S are not in the word.
- E is correct at position 2.
- N is correct at position 3.
- R is in the word but not at positions 1 or 2, so R must be at position 4 or 5.

Thus the pattern is _ E N _ _ with R occupying either the 4th or 5th slot.  
A common English word fitting this pattern is **VENOM** (V E N O M), where R is not present, but we can test new letters V, O, M while keeping E and N fixed.

Therefore the next guess should be VENOM.

We have determined the secret word pattern from feedback:
- Position 2 = E (confirmed)
- Position 3 = N (confirmed)
- Position 4 = O (confirmed)
- R is in the word but cannot be in positions 1,2,4,5 (from earlier feedback), so R must be position 3, but position 3 is N. Contradiction, meaning our earlier assumption that R is present is wrong? Or there's a mistake in reasoning.

Wait, actually from the first guess CRANE we have R(-) meaning R is in the word but not in position 2. From guess RENDS we have R(-) meaning R is in the word but not in position 1. Therefore R cannot be in positions 1 or 2. Positions 3,4,5 are already N, O, and unknown. If R is not in the word, then the feedback “R(-)” was a mistake? Or maybe the secret word does not contain R, and the “-” just indicates the letter exists elsewhere. No, the rules say “-” means the letter is in the word but not in that position. So R must be somewhere else.

But positions 2,3,4,5 are E, N, O, and unknown, and position 1 is still unknown. The only remaining slot for R is position 1. Let’s try that.

We have pattern _ E N O _. A common English word fitting this pattern is **FENOM** (a type of plant). It places R at position 1, satisfying the earlier constraints, and introduces a new letter F at position 1 and M at position 5 to test.

Thus the next guess should be FENOM.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- C and A are not in the word.
- R, N, and E are in the word but not in the positions they occupied in “CRANE” (2nd, 4th, and 5th respectively).

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R, N, and E in different positions, and avoids C and A.  
“RENDS” (R‑E‑N‑D‑S) satisfies these constraints:
- R is now in position 1 (was 2nd before).
- E is now in position 2 (was 5th before).
- N is now in position 3 (was 4th before).
- It introduces new letters D and S for further clues.
Thus “RENDS” is a valid next guess.
