### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Thus the secret word must fit the pattern: _ O V E R.

The only common English words matching this pattern are **FOVER** and **GOVER** (a misspelling of “govern”). Both satisfy all known constraints, and we have no information to distinguish them yet.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a valid 5‑letter English word. A common opening guess that contains a mix of common letters is “CRANE”. This will give useful information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the first feedback:
- C, A, N are not in the word.
- R and E are in the word but not in the positions they were guessed (R not in position 2, E not in position 5).

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R and E in different positions, and avoids C, A, N. A good candidate is **ROVER**:
- Contains R (positions 1 and 5) – neither is position 2.
- Contains E in position 4 – not position 5.
- Uses only letters O, V besides R and E, none of which have been ruled out.
Thus it satisfies all constraints and will give useful new information.

Guess 2: ROVER -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) V(✓) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|>

We have the following feedback:

- From CRANE: C, A, N are not in the word. R and E are in the word but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.
- From ROVER: Position 2 is O (correct), position 3 is V (correct), position 4 is E (correct), position 5 is R (correct). The first R in ROVER is marked “-”, which confirms that the only R is at position 5, not at position 1.

Thus the secret word must fit the pattern: _ O V E R.

The only common English words matching this pattern are **FOVER** and **GOVER** (a misspelling of “govern”). Both satisfy all known constraints, and we have no information to distinguish them yet.

I will guess **FOVER** to test the first letter.
