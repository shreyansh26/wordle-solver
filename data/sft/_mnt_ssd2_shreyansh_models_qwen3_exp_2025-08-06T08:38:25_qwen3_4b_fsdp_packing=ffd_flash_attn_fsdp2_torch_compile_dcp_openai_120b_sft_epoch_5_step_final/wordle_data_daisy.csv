### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have eliminated letters C, R, N, E, G, L, O, T from the secret word. The letter A is known to be in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 (it was in position 3 of CRANE and position 4 of GLOAT). Therefore A must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
- Contains A (not in positions 3 or 4).
- Uses only letters that have not been ruled out.

A good candidate is **BASIC**:
- Positions: B A S I C
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- Other letters (B, S, I) have not been eliminated.
- C has been eliminated, so we must avoid it. Wait, that’s a problem.

Let’s try another word that includes A and only uses allowed letters. “FAITH” fits:
- Contains A (position 2).
- Uses letters F, A, I, T, H, none of which have been eliminated.

Thus “FAITH” is a valid next guess.

We have the following feedback:

- From CRANE: C, R, N, E are not in the word; A is present but not in position 3.
- From GLOAT: G, L, O, T are not in the word; A is still present (position 4 was wrong).
- From FAITH: F, T, H are not in the word; A is correct at position 2; I is correct at position 3.

Thus the secret word has pattern _ A I _ _.  
Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, G, L, O, T, F, H.  
Allowed letters for the remaining slots are any not eliminated (e.g., B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

A common English word fitting the pattern is **MAIZE** (M A I Z E).  
However, we must check if any letters are eliminated:
- M, A, I are allowed.
- Z is allowed (not eliminated).
- E was eliminated earlier (from CRANE). ❌

Therefore **MAIZE** is invalid because it contains E.

Next candidate: **MAIFS** (M A I F S).  
Letters M, A, I are allowed. F is eliminated (from FAITH). ❌

Another candidate: **BAIDS** (B A I D S). All letters are allowed and the word is valid. This fits the pattern and avoids all eliminated letters.

Thus the next guess should be **BAIDS**.

We have established the following constraints from previous feedback:

- Position 2 is A (✓ from FAITH).
- Position 3 is I (✓ from FAITH).
- D is in the word but not at position 4 (D(-) from BAIDS).
- S is in the word but not at position 5 (S(-) from BAIDS).
- Letters eliminated: C, R, N, E, G, L, O, T, F, H, B, and also from SADIST we learned that SADIST is not the secret word, so we keep the earlier constraints.
- Positions 1, 4, 5 must be filled with the remaining letters, respecting D ≠ 4 and S ≠ 5.

A common English word that fits the pattern ? A I ? ? and includes both D and S (in allowed spots) is **MAIDS**:
- M (allowed, not eliminated) at position 1
- A at position 2 (✓)
- I at position 3 (✓)
- D at position 4 (D is allowed here)
- S at position 5 (S is allowed here)

Thus “MAIDS” satisfies all known constraints and is a valid next guess.
