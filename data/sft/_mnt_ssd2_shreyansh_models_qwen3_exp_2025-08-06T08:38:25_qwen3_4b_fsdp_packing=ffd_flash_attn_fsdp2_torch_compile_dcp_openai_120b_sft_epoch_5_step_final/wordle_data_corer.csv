### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the secret word starts with C (C is correct in position 1).  
The letter R is in the word but not in position 2, so R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.  
The letter E is in the word but not in position 5, so E can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.  
Letters A and N are not in the word, so we avoid them.

A good candidate that satisfies these constraints is **COWER**:

Position 3 is still unknown. From previous guesses, letters that are NOT in the word: A, N, W, G. The only common English word fitting the pattern C O _ E R with those constraints is **COZER** (a verb meaning to churn or work). The letter Z has not been ruled out, so it's a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters. ""CRANE"" is a good opening guess because it includes frequently used letters C, R, A, N, E and will give useful information about the secret word.

We know the secret word starts with C (C is correct in position 1).  
The letter R is in the word but not in position 2, so R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.  
The letter E is in the word but not in position 5, so E can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.  
Letters A and N are not in the word, so we avoid them.

A good candidate that satisfies these constraints is **COWER**:
- C is at position 1 (✓)
- R is at position 4 (allowed, not position 2)
- E is at position 3 (allowed, not position 5)
- No A or N appear.

Thus “COWER” is a valid next guess.

We have determined the secret word pattern from feedback:
- Position 1: C (✓)
- Position 2: O (✓)
- Position 3: unknown, but cannot be W (x) and cannot be A, N, W (from earlier x marks). Also not R or E unless they appear elsewhere, but R is already at position 5 and E at position 4.
- Position 4: E (✓)
- Position 5: R (✓)

Thus the word is C O _ E R. The common English word fitting this pattern is **COGER** (a verb meaning to churn or stir). The middle letter G has not been ruled out, so this is a valid next guess.
