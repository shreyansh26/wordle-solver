### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the fixed letters:
- Position 2 = A (✓ from RAILS and BAITH)
- Position 3 = I (✓ from RAILS and BAITH)

All letters marked x are not in the word: C, N, E, L, S, B, T, H.

R is known to be in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 (from CRANE and RAILS), so R must be in position 4 or 5.

We need a 5‑letter word of the form _ A I _ _. Placing R at position 4 gives the pattern _ A I R _. A common English word fitting this pattern and using only allowed letters is **GAIRD** (G A I R D). This satisfies all constraints.

Thus the next guess is GAIRD.

We have the following confirmed information:

- Position 2 = A (✓ from guesses 2, 3, 4)
- Position 3 = I (✓ from guesses 2, 3, 4)
- Position 4 = R (✓ from guess 4)
- Letter D is in the word but not in position 5 (D‑), so D must be in position 1.
- Letters eliminated (marked x): C, N, E, L, S, B, T, H, G.

Thus the pattern is **D A I R _**.  
The only common English word fitting this pattern is **DAIRY**, with Y in the final position, a letter not yet ruled out.

Therefore the next guess should be ""DAIRY"".
