### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback:
- Letters S, L, A, T, E, C, R, Y are not in the word.
- N is correct in position 4.
- O is in the word but not in position 3.

Thus the secret word pattern is _ _ _ N _. O must be in one of the positions 1, 2, or 5.

We need a word that:
- Has N in the fourth spot.
- Contains O somewhere other than the third spot.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

The word **DUNNO** fits:
- D (new), U (new), N (correct at position 3, but we can also have N elsewhere), N (position 4, correct), O (position 5, satisfying O’s presence and avoiding position 3).

We have the following feedback:

- From SLATE: S, L, A, T, E are not in the word.
- From CRONY: C, R, Y are not in the word; N is correct at position 4; O is in the word but not at position 3.
- From DUNNO: N is correct at position 4; O is in the word but not at position 5; D, U, and N (the third‑position N) are in the word but not at the positions they occupied in DUNNO.

Thus the secret word must contain the letters **D, U, N, O** plus one additional letter that hasn’t been ruled out.  
Position 4 is fixed as **N**.  
O cannot be in positions 3, 4, 5, so O must be in position 1 or 2.  
D cannot be in position 1; U cannot be in position 2; the third‑position N is already known to be elsewhere, so we can treat that N as just a duplicate and place the remaining letters freely.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **OUNDY**:
- O in position 1 (allowed),
- U in position 2 (allowed),
- N in position 3 (allowed, and we know an N exists here),
- D in position 5 (allowed, D is not in position 1),
- Y in position 5 (Y is not ruled out, and we need a fifth letter).

All letters are permissible, and the pattern fits the known information.

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

We have the following feedback:

- From SLATE: S, L, A, T, E are not in the word.
- From CRONY: C, R, Y are not in the word; N is correct at position 4; O is in the word but not at position 3.
- From DUNNO: N is correct at position 4; O is in the word but not at position 5; D, U, and N (the third‑position N) are in the word but not at the positions they occupied in DUNNO.

Thus the secret word must contain the letters **D, U, N, O** plus one additional letter that hasn’t been ruled out.  
Position 4 is fixed as **N**.  
O cannot be in positions 3, 4, 5, so O must be in position 1 or 2.  
D cannot be in position 1; U cannot be in position 2; the third‑position N is already known to be elsewhere, so we can treat that N as just a duplicate and place the remaining letters freely.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **OUNDY**:
- O in position 1 (allowed),
- U in position 2 (allowed),
- N in position 3 (allowed, and we know an N exists here),
- D in position 5 (allowed, D is not in position 1),
- Y in position 5 (Y is not ruled out, and we need a fifth letter).

All letters are permissible, and the pattern fits the known information.

Therefore, the next guess is:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with an initial guess. A common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters is “SLATE”. This will give me information about several frequent letters (S, L, A, T, E) and their positions.

The feedback tells me that none of the letters S, L, A, T, or E appear in the secret word. I need a new five‑letter guess using only letters that haven’t been ruled out. Choosing common letters that haven’t been eliminated will give me the most information. “CRONY” uses C, R, O, N, Y – all are still possible, so it’s a good next guess.

We know from the feedback:
- Letters S, L, A, T, E, C, R, Y are not in the word.
- N is correct in position 4.
- O is in the word but not in position 3.

Thus the secret word pattern is _ _ _ N _. O must be in one of the positions 1, 2, or 5.

We need a word that:
- Has N in the fourth spot.
- Contains O somewhere other than the third spot.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

The word **DUNNO** fits:
- D (new), U (new), N (correct at position 3, but we can also have N elsewhere), N (position 4, correct), O (position 5, satisfying O’s presence and avoiding position 3).

All letters are allowed, so DUNNO is a valid next guess.
