### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following confirmed information:
- Position 2 is A (from BALMY feedback).
- Position 4 is N (from CRANE feedback).
- Letters C, R, E, B, L, M, Y are not in the word.
- A is not in position 3 (already satisfied by A being in position 2).
We need a word of the form _ A _ N _. The word “HAVAN” (H A V A N) fits:
- H at position 1 (allowed),
- A at position 2 (matches the known A),
- V at position 3 (allowed, not a prohibited letter),
- A at position 4 (allowed, not prohibited),
- N at position 5 (matches the known N).
All prohibited letters are avoided, so “HAVAN” is a valid next guess.

We have confirmed:

- Position 4 is N (from CRANE).
- Letters C, R, E, B, L, M, Y, H, V are not in the word.
- A is not in positions 3 or 4 (from HAVAN).
- N is not in position 5 (from HAVAN).

Thus the pattern is _ A _ N _. The remaining unknown letters (positions 1,3,5) must be chosen from the unused alphabet (D, F, G, I, J, K, O, P, Q, S, T, U, W, X, Z, etc.) and cannot include any excluded letters.

A common English word fitting this pattern is **DASAN** (D A S A N). It respects all constraints:
- Position 2 = A, position 4 = N.
- No prohibited letters appear.
- A is not in positions 3 or 4.
- N is not in position 5.

Therefore, the next guess will be DASAN.

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

I need to start the game with an initial 5‑letter guess. A good opening word contains common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information. ""CRANE"" is a popular starter because it includes the frequent letters C, R, A, N, and E. I'll use that as my first guess.

<|im_start|>assistant
We know from the feedback:
- N is correct in position 4.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- C, R, and E are not in the word at all.

We need a new 5‑letter word with N as the fourth letter, containing A in a different position (1, 2, or 5), and avoiding C, R, and E.  
The word **BALMY** fits:
- B A L M Y → N is fourth.
- A is in position 2 (not position 3).
- No C, R, or E appear.

Thus BALMY is a valid next guess.
