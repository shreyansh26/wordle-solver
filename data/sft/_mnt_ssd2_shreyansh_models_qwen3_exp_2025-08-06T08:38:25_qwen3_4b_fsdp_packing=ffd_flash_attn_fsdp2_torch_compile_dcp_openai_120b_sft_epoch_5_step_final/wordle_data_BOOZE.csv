### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Thus the secret word must be of the form **_ O _ _ E**, using none of the letters that have been marked absent: C, R, A, N, S, L, I, D, M, U.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells me that only the last letter E is correct and in the right place, while C, R, A, and N are not in the word at all. I need a new five‑letter word that ends with E and avoids using C, R, A, N. A good candidate is **SLIDE** (S‑L‑I‑D‑E), which satisfies those constraints.

We have determined that only the last letter E is correct and in the correct position. All other letters from previous guesses (C,R,A,N,S,L,I,D) are not in the word at all. So the secret word must be of the form _ _ _ _ E, using none of those excluded letters. A common English word that fits is **MOUSE** (M O U S E).

We have the following feedback:

- From CRANE: only the last letter **E** is correct (position 5).
- From SLIDE: only the last letter **E** is correct (position 5).
- From MOUSE: the second letter **O** is correct (position 2), and the last letter **E** is confirmed again (position 5). All other letters (M, S, U) are not in the word.

Thus the secret word must be of the form **_ O _ _ E**, using none of the letters that have been marked absent: C, R, A, N, S, L, I, D, M, U.

A common English word that fits this pattern and avoids the forbidden letters is **GOUGE** (G‑O‑U‑G‑E). It uses only new letters (G, O, U, E) with O in position 2 and E in position 5.

So the next guess will be “GOUGE”.
