### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback from the first guess tells me that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E appear in the secret word.

We have confirmed:

From earlier feedback:
- T is in the word but not at positions 3 or 4, so T must be at position 5.
- O is in the word but not at positions 4 or 5, so O can be at position 3.
Thus the pattern is **M O O _ T**.

A common English word fitting **M O O _ T** is **MOONT** (M‑O‑O‑N‑T). The letter N has been ruled out (from CRANE), so that doesn't work. The next viable candidate is **MOOLT** (M‑O‑O‑L‑T). L hasn't been ruled out, and “moolt” is a valid English word (a type of fish).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common consonants and vowels. ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it includes the frequent letters C, R, N and the vowels A and E, giving useful information about the secret word’s letters and positions.

The feedback from the first guess tells me that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E appear in the secret word. I need a new guess that avoids all those letters and introduces fresh letters to gather more information. A good candidate is “MIGHT,” which uses M, I, G, H, T—none of which have been ruled out yet. This will help identify any of those letters in the secret word and also test new consonants and a vowel.

We know the secret word has M in position 1 and T in position 5, and letters I, G, H, C, R, A, N, E are ruled out. We need a word of form M _ _ _ T using only letters not yet excluded. “MOTTO” fits: M O T T O. It introduces O (still unknown) and repeats T, which is allowed. No excluded letters appear.

We have confirmed letters:
- Position 1: M (✓)
- Position 2: O (✓)

From guess 3 (MOTTO):
- T at position 3 got “-”, meaning T is in the word but not at position 3.
- T at position 4 also got “-”, same reason.
- O at position 5 got “-”, meaning O is in the word but not at position 5.

Thus the secret word must contain:
- M at position 1
- O at position 2
- Another O somewhere not at position 5 (could be position 3 or 4)
- T somewhere not at positions 3 or 4 (could be position 3 or 4 if the extra O is elsewhere, but more likely position 3 or 4 would be O and T would be position 5, which is ruled out. So T must be position 3 or 4, and the remaining slot would be another letter).

A common English word that fits these constraints is **MOIST**:
- M (pos1) ✓
- O (pos2) ✓
- I (pos3) – allowed (I hasn’t been ruled out)
- S (pos4) – allowed
- T (pos5) ✓

All letters are permissible, and the placement satisfies the known “-” feedbacks. Therefore the next guess should be “MOIST”.
