### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from feedback that letters C, R, and A are not in the secret word. Letters N and E are in the word but are not in the positions they occupied in “CRANE” (N was 4th, E was 5th). Therefore N cannot be 4th and E cannot be 5th.

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
- Contains N and E (to keep those confirmed letters).
- Does not place N in position 4 or E in position 5.
- Avoids the excluded letters C, R, A.

A good candidate is **BENDS**:
- Positions: B 1, E 2, N 3, D 4, S 5
- Contains N and E, respects the position constraints, and uses only new letters (B, D, S) that haven’t been ruled out.

Thus we’ll guess “BENDS”.

We know from feedback that letters C, R, and A are not in the secret word. Letters N and E are in the word but are not in the positions they occupied in “CRANE” (N was 4th, E was 5th). Therefore N cannot be 4th and E cannot be 5th.

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
- Contains N and E (to keep those confirmed letters).
- Does not place N in position 4 or E in position 5.
- Avoids the excluded letters C, R, A.

A good candidate is **BENDS**:
- Positions: B 1, E 2, N 3, D 4, S 5
- Contains N and E, respects the position constraints, and uses only new letters (B, D, S) that haven’t been ruled out.

Thus we’ll guess “BENDS”.

We have confirmed letters:

- E is in the word but not in positions 2 (from BENDS) or 5 (from CRANE). So E can be 1, 3, or 4.

Eliminated letters: C, R, A, B, D, S.

We need a 5‑letter word containing N and E in allowed spots and three new letters that haven’t been ruled out.

Word **UNITE** fits:
- U (new), N (position 2 – allowed), I (new), T (new), E (position 4 – allowed).
- No eliminated letters appear.

Thus UNITE is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
