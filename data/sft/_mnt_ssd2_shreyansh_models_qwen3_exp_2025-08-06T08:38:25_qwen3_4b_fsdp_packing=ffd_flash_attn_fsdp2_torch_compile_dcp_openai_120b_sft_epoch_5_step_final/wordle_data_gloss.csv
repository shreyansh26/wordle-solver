### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following confirmed information:
- Position 1 = G (✓ from GUILD and GOLFS).
- Position 5 = S (✓ from GOLFS).
- Letter O is in the word but not at position 2 (‑ from GOLFS). So O must be at position 3 or 4.
- Letter L is in the word but not at positions 2 or 4 (‑ from GUILD and GOLFS). So L can only be at position 3.
- All other letters guessed so far (C,R,A,N,E,M,I,H,T,U,D,F) are not in the word.

Thus the pattern is:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common consonants and vowels, giving useful information for the next steps. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes the frequent letters C, R, N and the vowels A and E.

The first guess ""CRANE"" showed that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E appear in the secret word. Therefore the next guess must avoid all of those letters. I’ll choose a common word with five different letters that are not any of the excluded ones. “MIGHT” uses M, I, G, H, T—all of which are still possible, so it’s a good candidate for the next guess.

We know from previous feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, M, I, H, T are not in the secret word.
- Letter G is in the word but not in position 3.

Thus the secret word must contain G (in position 1, 2, 4, or 5) and only letters that have not been ruled out. Choose a common word that includes G in a new position and uses only allowed letters. ""GUILD"" fits: G is at position 1, and U, L, I, D are all still possible (none have been marked absent). This will test several new letters while keeping G in a different spot.

We have the following feedback:

1. CRANE → all letters (C,R,A,N,E) are not in the word.
2. MIGHT → M, I, H, T are not in the word; G is in the word but not in position 3.
3. GUILD → G is correct at position 1; U, I, D are not in the word; L is in the word but not in position 4.

Thus the secret word must:
- Start with **G**.
- Contain **L** somewhere other than position 4 (so positions 2, 3, or 5).
- Exclude the letters C,R,A,N,E,M,I,H,T,U,D.
- Use only letters that haven’t been ruled out.

A common word satisfying these constraints is **GOLFS**:
- G is at position 1 (matches known ✓).
- L is at position 2 (L is present, not at position 4).
- O, F, S are new letters not yet eliminated.

Therefore, the next guess should be “GOLFS”.
