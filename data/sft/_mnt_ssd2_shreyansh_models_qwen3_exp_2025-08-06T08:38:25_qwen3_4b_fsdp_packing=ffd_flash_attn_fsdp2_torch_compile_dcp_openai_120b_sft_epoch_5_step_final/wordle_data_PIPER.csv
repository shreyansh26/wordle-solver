### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following confirmed information from feedback:

- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, O, V.
- Letter R is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.
- Letter E is correctly placed at position 4.
- The letter R also appears elsewhere (since it got a “‑” in the first guess), but we already have it fixed at position 5, so the extra R is likely a red herring; we don’t need a second R.
- No other letters have been confirmed.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern: _ _ _ E R.

We need a common 5‑letter word ending in “ER” with an E in the fourth slot and using only letters that haven’t been ruled out.  
“SMILER” (S M I L E R) satisfies all constraints and introduces three new letters (S, M, I) for further testing.

So the next guess will be “SMILER”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels, to get useful information about the secret word. ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it includes the frequent consonants C, R, N and the vowels A and E.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_start|>assistant
We know from the feedback:
- C, A, N are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a new guess that includes R and E in different positions, avoids C, A, N, and tests new letters. “ROVER” places R at positions 1 and 5 (both allowed) and puts E at position 4, satisfying the constraints while introducing O and V for more information.

We have the following confirmed information from feedback:

- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, O, V.
- Letter R is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.
- Letter E is correctly placed at position 4.
- The letter R also appears elsewhere (since it got a “‑” in the first guess), but we already have it fixed at position 5, so the extra R is likely a red herring; we don’t need a second R.
- No other letters have been confirmed.

Thus the secret word fits the pattern: _ _ _ E R.

We need a common 5‑letter word ending in “ER” with an E in the fourth slot and using only letters that haven’t been ruled out.  
“SMILER” (S M I L E R) satisfies all constraints and introduces three new letters (S, M, I) for further testing.

So the next guess will be “SMILER”.
