### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have:

  * M is not in the word.
  * I is correct at position 2.
  * G is not in the word.
  * H is not in the word.
  * T is in the word but not at position 5.

Thus the secret word must have I as the second letter, contain a T somewhere in positions 1‑4, and must avoid the letters C,R,A,N,E,M,G,H.  

A good next guess should keep I in the second slot, include T in a different position (not the fifth), and test new letters while respecting the exclusions.  
The word **SITTY** fits:
- Pattern: S I T T Y → I is in position 2.

We have determined the secret word pattern from feedback:
- Position 2 is I (✓ from MIGHT and SITTY).
- Position 3 is T (✓ from SITTY).
- Position 4 is T (✓ from SITTY).
- Position 5 is Y (✓ from SITTY).
- Position 1 is not S (x from SITTY) and also not any letters previously marked absent: C,R,A,N,E,M,G,H,S.
The only common English word fitting the pattern _ I T T Y with those constraints is **PITTY** (P I T T Y). P has not been ruled out, so this is a valid next guess.

We have determined the secret word pattern from feedback:
- Position 2 is I (✓ from MIGHT and SITTY).
- Position 3 is T (✓ from SITTY).
- Position 4 is T (✓ from SITTY).
- Position 5 is Y (✓ from SITTY).
- Position 1 cannot be any of the letters previously marked absent: C,R,A,N,E,M,G,H,S,P. The remaining plausible letters that can start a common English word of the form _ITTY are B (BITTY) and D (DITTY). Both are valid; we will test one of them.
