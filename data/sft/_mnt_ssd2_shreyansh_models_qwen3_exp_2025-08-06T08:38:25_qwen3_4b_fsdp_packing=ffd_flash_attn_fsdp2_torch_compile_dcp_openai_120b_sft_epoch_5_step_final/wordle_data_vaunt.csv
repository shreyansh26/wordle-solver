### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

- A is correct at position 2 (from BANON).
- N is also present elsewhere (both N’s in BANON got “-”), so the secret word contains at least two N’s, one at position 4 and another at a different position.
- A is only in the word at position 2 (the “-” on A in CRANE tells us it’s not elsewhere).

Thus the pattern is: _ A _ N _.  
We need a common 5‑letter word that fits this pattern and includes a second N.  
“LANNU” (a name meaning “I am”) satisfies all constraints and uses only letters not ruled out.

So the next guess will be **LANNU**.

We have the following feedback:

- From CRANE: N is correct at position 4; A is in the word but not at position 3; C, R, E are not in the word.
- From BANON: A is correct at position 2; N is in the word but not at positions 3 or 5; B, O are not in the word.
- From LANNU: A is correct at position 2; N is correct at position 4; U is in the word but not at position 5; L is not in the word.

Thus the pattern is:

1 ? 2 A 3 ? 4 N 5 ?

U must be at position 1 or 3 (not 2,4,5).  
We need a common English word fitting _ A _ N _ with U in slot 1 or 3 and no forbidden letters (C,R,E,B,O,L).  

The word **MAUNA** (a Hawaiian term for a mountain) fits perfectly:
- M A U N A → positions 2 A, 4 N, U at position 3.
- Uses only allowed letters (M, A, U, N) and avoids the excluded ones.

Therefore the next guess should be “MAUNA”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a valid 5‑letter English word. A good opening guess is a word that contains common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to get useful feedback. “CRANE” is a popular starter word for this reason.

We know from the feedback:
- C, R, and E are not in the word.
- N is correct in position 4.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

Thus the secret word pattern is _ _ _ N _. A cannot be at position 3, so it can be at 1, 2, or 5. A good candidate that satisfies these constraints and uses common letters is **BANON** (B A N O N). This places A at position 2 and keeps N at position 4, while introducing new letters B and O for further clues.

We have the following constraints from feedback:

- Letters not in the word: C, R, E, B, O.
- N is correct at position 4 (from CRANE).
- A is correct at position 2 (from BANON).
- N is also present elsewhere (both N’s in BANON got “-”), so the secret word contains at least two N’s, one at position 4 and another at a different position.
- A is only in the word at position 2 (the “-” on A in CRANE tells us it’s not elsewhere).

Thus the pattern is: _ A _ N _.

- From LANNU: A is correct at position 2; N is correct at position 4; U is in the word but not at position 5; L is not in the word.
