### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a valid 5‑letter English word. A good opening guess is a word that contains common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information. “CRANE” is a popular starter word for this reason.

All letters from the first guess (C, R, A, N, E) are confirmed absent. I need a new 5‑letter word that avoids those letters entirely and uses other common letters to gather more information. “MIGHT” contains M, I, G, H, T, none of which have been ruled out, so it’s a good candidate for the next guess.

We know from previous feedback:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, G, H, T are not in the word.
- Letter I is correct in position 2.
- Letter M is in the word but not in position 1.

Thus the secret word pattern is: _ I _ _ _. M must appear in positions 3, 4, or 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word with I in the second slot, containing M (not at the first position), and avoiding the eliminated letters. A good candidate is **DIMLY**:
- D I M L Y
- I is in the correct second position.
- M is present in the third position (not the first), satisfying the “‑” feedback.
- D, L, Y have not been ruled out.

This guess will test the remaining unknown letters while respecting all constraints.
