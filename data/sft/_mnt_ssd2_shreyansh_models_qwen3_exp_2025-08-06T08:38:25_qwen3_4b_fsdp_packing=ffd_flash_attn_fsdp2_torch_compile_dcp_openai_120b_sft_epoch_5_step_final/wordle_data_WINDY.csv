### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells us that the letters C, R, A, and E are not in the secret word. The letter N is in the word but not in position 4 (the fourth slot of CRANE).

- D is in the word but not in position 1, so D must be in position 4.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a valid 5‑letter English word. I’ll choose a common word that contains a mix of common letters to get useful feedback. “CRANE” is a good starter.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The feedback tells us that the letters C, R, A, and E are not in the secret word. The letter N is in the word but not in position 4 (the fourth slot of CRANE). Therefore, the next guess must include N in a different position and avoid C, R, A, and E. I’ll choose a common word that satisfies these constraints: **MINTY** (N is in the third position, and none of the excluded letters appear).

We have determined the secret word pattern from feedback:
- Position 2 is I (✓)
- Position 3 is N (✓)
- Position 5 is Y (✓)
- Positions 1 and 4 are still unknown.
Letters confirmed not in the word: C, R, A, E, M, T.
We need a word matching _ I N _ Y without using those excluded letters. “FINNY” fits: F I N N Y, uses only new letters F and repeats N (allowed) and ends with Y. It also avoids all eliminated letters.
Thus the next guess is FINNY.

We have the pattern from feedback:
- Position 2 is I (✓)
- Position 3 is N (✓)
- Position 5 is Y (✓)
- Position 1 cannot be F (from FINNY) and cannot be any previously eliminated letters (C,R,A,E,M,T,F).
- Position 4 is not N (the N in position 4 of FINNY got a “‑”, meaning N is elsewhere, which we already have at position 3).

Thus the secret word is of the form _ I N _ Y, with the first letter not F and not any eliminated letters, and the fourth letter not N.

A common English word fitting this pattern is **DINGY** (D I N G Y). It uses only new letters D and G for the unknown slots and avoids all letters that have been ruled out.

Therefore, the next guess should be DINGY.
