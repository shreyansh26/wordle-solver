### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed:
- Position 4 = E (✓ from RIDER and POWER)
- Position 5 = R (✓ from RIDER and POWER)
- R is not in positions 1 or 2 (both gave “-”), so R is only at position 5.
- E is not in position 5 (from CRANE’s “-”), which is already satisfied.
- Excluded letters (marked x): C, A, N, I, D, P, O, W.

We need a word of the form ___ER using only letters not excluded. Viable candidates include **TIMER** (T I M E R) and **FIRER** (F I R E R). Both fit the pattern and avoid the excluded letters. I’ll choose **TIMER** to test T, I, and M.

If the secret word contains I, the feedback will indicate it’s in the word but not in position 2, which will help locate it. If I is not in the word, we’ll know the next letters must avoid I.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the first guess CRANE that:
- C, A, N are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R and E in different positions, avoids C, A, N, and tries new letters to gather more information. “RIDER” fits: it contains R (positions 1 and 5) and E (position 4), respects the position restrictions, and introduces I and D as new letters.

We have the following confirmed information:

- Position 5 = R (from RIDER feedback ✓).
- Letter R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 (from both guesses). It is already correctly placed at position 5, so we only need to respect that.
- Letters C, A, N, I, D are not in the word (all marked x).
- Letter E is not in position 5 (already satisfied by E at position 4).

We need a 5‑letter word of the form _ _ _ E R that does not contain any excluded letters. “POWER” fits:
- P O W E R → positions 1‑5 are P O W E R.
- Contains no C, A, N, I, D.
- E is at position 4, R at position 5.
- Introduces new letters P and O to test additional possibilities.
