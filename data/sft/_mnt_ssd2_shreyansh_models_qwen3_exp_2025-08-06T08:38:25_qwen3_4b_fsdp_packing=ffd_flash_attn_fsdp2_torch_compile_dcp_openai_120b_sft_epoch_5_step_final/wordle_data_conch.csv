### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback:

- Guess 1 (CRANE): C is correct in position 1, N is in the word but not in position 4, R, A, and E are not in the word.
- Guess 2 (CONDO): C is correct in position 1, O is correct in position 2, N is correct in position 3, D is not in the word, and the second O is present elsewhere (so O is in the word, already placed at position 2).

Thus the secret word pattern is:

1 C 2 O 3 N 4 ? 5 ?

Letters known to be absent: R, A, E, D.  
Letters confirmed present: C, O, N (already placed).  
We need to choose new letters for positions 4 and 5 that are not among the excluded letters.

A good candidate is **COUCH**:
- Keeps the known correct letters C, O, N in the first three spots.
- Introduces a new letter U (position 4) and another new letter H (position 5), both of which have not been ruled out.
- Uses only common letters, giving us useful information for the next round.

So the next guess will be “COUCH”.

A good candidate that fits the pattern and uses a new letter is **CYNIC** (C O N I C). This introduces the new letter I and keeps the known correct letters in place, giving us useful information about the fourth position and whether the final C is repeated.

I need to start the game with a valid 5‑letter English word. I'll choose a common word that contains a mix of common letters to get useful feedback. ""CRANE"" is a good starter.

Here is some previous feedback:

We know the secret word starts with C (C is correct in position 1). The letters R, A, and E are not in the word at all. The letter N is in the word but not in position 4, so it must be in position 2, 3, or 5. We need a new 5‑letter word that:
- Has C as the first letter.
- Contains N in one of the allowed positions (2, 3, or 5).
- Does not use R, A, or E.
Choosing “CONDO” gives C‑O‑N‑D‑O, placing N in position 3 and introducing new letters O and D for further information.

We have the following feedback:

- Guess 1 (CRANE): C is correct in position 1, N is in the word but not in position 4, R, A, and E are not in the word.
- Guess 2 (CONDO): C is correct in position 1, O is correct in position 2, N is correct in position 3, D is not in the word, and the second O is present elsewhere (so O is in the word, already placed at position 2).

Thus the secret word pattern is:

1 C 2 O 3 N 4 ? 5 ?

Letters known to be absent: R, A, E, D.  
Letters confirmed present: C, O, N (already placed).  
We need to choose new letters for positions 4 and 5 that are not among the excluded letters.

A good candidate is **COUCH**:
- Keeps the known correct letters C, O, N in the first three spots.
- Introduces a new letter U (position 4) and another new letter H (position 5), both of which have not been ruled out.
- Uses only common letters, giving us useful information for the next round.

So the next guess will be “COUCH”.

We have the following feedback:

- Guess 1 (CRANE): C is correct in position 1, N is in the word but not in position 4, R, A, and E are not in the word.
- Guess 2 (CONDO): C is correct in position 1, O is correct in position 2, N is correct in position 3, D is not in the word, and the second O is present elsewhere (so O is in the word, already placed at position 2).
- Guess 3 (COUCH): C is correct in position 1, O is correct in position 2, U is not in the word, the second C is present elsewhere (confirms C is in the word, already at position 1), and H is correct in position 5.

Thus the pattern is:

1 C 2 O 3 N 4 ? 5 H

The only unknown letter is at position 4. It cannot be U, R, A, E, D, or any letter already ruled out. The most common remaining letters are B, F, G, I, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc.

A good candidate that fits the pattern and uses a new letter is **CYNIC** (C O N I C). This introduces the new letter I and keeps the known correct letters in place, giving us useful information about the fourth position and whether the final C is repeated.

So the next guess will be “CYNIC”.

We have the following feedback:

- Guess 1 (CRANE): C is correct in position 1; N is in the word but not in position 4; R, A, E are not in the word.
- Guess 2 (CONDO): C (pos1) and O (pos2) are correct; N is correct at pos3; D is not in the word; the second O is present elsewhere (confirms O is in the word, already placed at pos2).
- Guess 3 (COUCH): C (pos1) and O (pos2) correct; H (pos5) correct; U not in the word; the second C is present elsewhere (confirms C is in the word, already at pos1).
- Guess 4 (CYNIC): C (pos1) correct; N (pos3) correct; the second C is present elsewhere (still pos1); Y and I are not in the word.

Thus the pattern is:

1 C 2 O 3 N 4 ? 5 H

Letters confirmed absent: R, A, E, D, U, Y, I.  
We need a valid English word fitting C O N _ H with a new fourth letter that hasn’t been ruled out.

Possible candidates: **CONCH** (C‑O‑N‑C‑H) introduces a second C at position 4, which is allowed and hasn't been excluded. This fits the pattern and is a common word.

So the next guess is “CONCH”.
