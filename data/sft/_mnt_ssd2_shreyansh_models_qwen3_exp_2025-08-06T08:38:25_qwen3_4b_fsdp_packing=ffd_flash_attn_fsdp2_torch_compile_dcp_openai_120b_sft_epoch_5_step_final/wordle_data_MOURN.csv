### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed letters:

R is in the word but cannot be in positions 1,2,3 (all gave “-”), so R must be in position 4.

Thus the word pattern is **M O _ R N**.

Letters already ruled out: C, A, E, I, D, S, P, H, plus the second O (since the O at position 2 got a “-” in guess 3, indicating O appears elsewhere, which is already satisfied by position 2). The remaining unknown letter (position 3) must be a letter not previously excluded.

Common words fitting the pattern include **MOTRN** (not a real word) and **MORGN** (slang for “morning”). The only standard English word that fits is **MORGU** (a type of moth, though obscure). Alternatively, **MORAN** (a type of warrior) fits the pattern M O R A N, but A is known to be absent.

Given the constraints and common vocabulary, the best guess is **MORGU**.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters. ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it includes frequently used letters C, R, A, N, and E.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
We know from the first feedback:
- C, A, E are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

We need a new 5‑letter word that includes R and N in different positions, avoids C, A, E, and tries new letters to narrow down the solution.

The word **RINDS** satisfies these constraints:
- Contains R (position 1, not position 2) and N (position 3, not position 4).
- Uses only new letters I, D, S besides R and N.
- No prohibited letters C, A, or E appear.

Thus “RINDS” is a valid next guess.

We have confirmed letters:
- R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2.
- N is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4.
Excluded letters: C, A, E, I, D, S.

We need a 5‑letter word containing R and N in allowed spots and three new letters not excluded.  
A good candidate is **MORON**:
- R is at position 3 (allowed).
- N is at position 5 (allowed).
- All other letters (M, O) are not excluded and are common letters.

Thus we guess MORON.

From the feedback:
- Positions 1 and 2 are confirmed as M and O (M✓, O✓).
- N is confirmed at position 5 (N✓).
- R is in the word but not in positions 1,2,3 → must be position 4.
- The second O is marked “-”, meaning O appears elsewhere (already satisfied by position 2).

Thus the word pattern is **M O _ R N**.  
A common English word fitting this pattern is **MORPH** (M‑O‑R‑P‑H).  
P and H have not been ruled out yet.

So the next guess will be MORPH.
