### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The word **RIGEL** fits:
- R at position 1 (✓).
- I at position 2 (allowed).
- G at position 3 (new test letter).
- E at position 4 (allowed, not 2 or 5).
- L at position 5 (present in guess, but we already know L is not in the word; the feedback will clarify if it’s “x”).  

This guess respects all known constraints and introduces a new letter (G) for further narrowing.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: RELIT -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(-) L(x) I(-) T(x)
Guess 3: RIGEL -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) I(✓) G(x) E(✓) L(x)

We have the following feedback:

- Guess 1 (CRANE): C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)  
  → C, A, N are not in the word. R is in the word but not in position 2. E is in the word but not in position 5.

- Guess 2 (RELIT): R(✓) E(-) L(x) I(-) T(x)  
  → R is correct at position 1. E is in the word but not in position 2. L and T are not in the word. I is in the word but not in position 4.

- Guess 3 (RIGEL): R(✓) I(✓) G(x) E(✓) L(x)  
  → Positions 1 = R, 2 = I, 4 = E are confirmed. G and L are not in the word.

Thus the pattern is **R I _ E _**.  
The remaining unknown letters are at positions 3 and 5.  
We know the word must contain only letters that have not been ruled out: B, D, F, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly repeats of known letters).

A common English word fitting the pattern is **RIVET** (R I V E T). It uses new letters V and T, one of which (T) is already known to be absent, but the feedback will clarify whether T appears in position 5. This guess will test V and confirm the placement of T.

So the next guess is:

We know the secret word does not contain C, A, or N. It does contain R and E, but R is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5. We need a new guess that includes R and E in different positions and introduces new letters to test. “RELIT” places R at position 1 and E at position 2, satisfying the constraints, and adds L, I, T for further clues.

We have:

We need a 5‑letter word starting with R, containing E and I in allowed spots, and using two new letters to test.  
The word **RIGEL** fits:
- R at position 1 (✓).

- G at position 3 (new test letter).
- E at position 4 (allowed, not 2 or 5).
