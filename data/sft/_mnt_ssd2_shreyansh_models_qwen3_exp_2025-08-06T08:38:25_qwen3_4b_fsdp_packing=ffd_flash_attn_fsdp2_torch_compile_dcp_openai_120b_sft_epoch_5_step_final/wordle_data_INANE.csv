We have confirmed that the secret word ends with “ANE”: A in position 3, N in position 4, E in position 5.  
From the fourth guess “TONNE”, the feedback showed that the N in position 4 is correct (✓), while the N in position 2 is marked “-”, meaning there is an N elsewhere (already satisfied by the N in position 4) and that the N at position 2 is not in the secret word.  
Thus the first two letters must be letters that are not C, R, P, L, S, H, T, O, and also not N (except possibly a second N, but the feedback suggests only one N).  

A common English word fitting the pattern **??ANE** with allowed letters is **VIANA** (V I A N A). This uses only letters not yet excluded and respects the known positions.

Therefore, the next guess should be:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The feedback tells me that the secret word has A in the 3rd position, N in the 4th, and E in the 5th. Letters C and R are not in the word at all. So the pattern is __ANE.

We have confirmed the secret word ends with A N E (positions 3‑5).  
From VIANA feedback: V is not in the word, I is in the word but not in position 2, and the second A (position 5) is present but not in position 5, meaning the word contains at least two A’s (A at position 3 and another elsewhere).  
Thus the pattern is **_ _ A N A** with an I somewhere other than position 2 (so position 1 or 4).  
A common English word fitting this pattern is **MINNA** (M I N N A):  
- Position 1 = M (allowed)  
- Position 2 = I (satisfies I being present, not in position 2)  
- Position 3 = A (matches known A)  
- Position 4 = N (matches known N)  
- Position 5 = A (second A, satisfies the “present but not at 5” clue)  

Therefore the next guess should be MINNA.
