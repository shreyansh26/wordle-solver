### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following information from feedback:

- Letters C, R, A, E, M, T are not in the secret word (x).
- Letter I is correct at position 2 (✓).
- Letter N is correct at position 3 (✓) and also appears elsewhere (‑). Since the N at position 5 in the second guess was marked “‑”, the secret word contains at least two Ns, one at position 3 and another not at position 5. Therefore the second N must be at position 1 or 4.
- No other letters have been confirmed.

We need a 5‑letter word that:
1. Has I in the second slot.
2. Has N in the third slot.
3. Contains a second N in position 1 or 4.
4. Does not use any eliminated letters (C,R,A,E,M,T).

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **UNION**:
- U N I O N → pattern matches _ N I _ N.
- Uses only allowed letters (U, O are not eliminated).
- Places the required I, N, and a second N in the allowed positions.

Thus the next guess will be “UNION”.
