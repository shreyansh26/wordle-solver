### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have determined the exact positions of four letters:
- Position 2 = R (✓ from both guesses)
- Position 3 = A (✓)
- Position 4 = C (✓)
- Position 5 = E (✓)

The only unknown is the first letter. The feedback tells us that the letter C is in the word but not in position 1 (from the first guess), so C cannot be the first letter. The first position must be a letter that fits the pattern _RACE and forms a valid English word. The common word that fits is **GRACE** (G‑R‑A‑C‑E). No prior feedback rules out G, so this is a logical next guess.
