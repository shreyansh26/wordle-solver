### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

1. CRANE → all letters marked x → none of C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
2. MIGHT → feedback is M(x), I(✓), G(✓), H(✓), T(✓).

From the second guess we know the secret word has I in position 2, G in position 3, H in position 4, and T in position 5. The first letter is not M and cannot be any of the letters we already eliminated (C,R,A,N,E,M). A common English word that fits the pattern _I G H T is “LIGHT” (L I G H T).

We have determined the secret word pattern is _ I G H T based on previous feedback. The first letter cannot be M, L, S, C, R, A, N, or E. The remaining plausible letters that form a common English word are D, P, or W. Among these, ""DIGIT"" is a standard word and fits the pattern perfectly, while ""PIGTY"" is not a valid English word. Therefore, the best next guess is ""DIGIT"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

All letters from the first guess (C, R, A, N, E) are marked as not present in the secret word. Therefore, the next guess must avoid those letters entirely. I’ll choose a common 5‑letter word using different letters. “MIGHT” contains M, I, G, H, T, none of which were used before, so it’s a valid next guess.

We have feedback from two guesses:

1. CRANE → all letters marked x → none of C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
2. MIGHT → feedback is M(x), I(✓), G(✓), H(✓), T(✓).

From the second guess we know the secret word has I in position 2, G in position 3, H in position 4, and T in position 5. The first letter is not M and cannot be any of the letters we already eliminated (C,R,A,N,E,M). A common English word that fits the pattern _I G H T is “LIGHT” (L I G H T). L has not been ruled out, so this is a valid next guess.

We have determined the secret word pattern from previous feedback:
- Positions 2‑5 are fixed: I (✓), G (✓), H (✓), T (✓).
- The first letter is not M, L, C, R, A, N, E (all marked x).
- We need a common 5‑letter word of the form _ I G H T.

Possible candidates include ""SIGHT"" (S I G H T) and ""DIGIT"" (D I G I T). Both fit the pattern and avoid eliminated letters. Choosing a word that introduces a new first letter will give the most information, so I will guess ""SIGHT"".

Therefore the first letter must be a new candidate that hasn't been ruled out. The word “PIGTY” is not a standard English word, but “PIGTH” is also not common.
