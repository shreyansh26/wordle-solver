### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have confirmed the first three letters: C (position 1), R (position 2), A (position 3).  
From guess 3 (CRACK), the fourth letter was marked “C (-)”, meaning C is in the word but not in position 4. Since we already have a C at position 1, this indicates there is a second C somewhere else, likely at position 5 (the only remaining slot).  
The letter K was marked “x”, so it is not in the word.  
Thus the pattern is **C R A _ C**.  
A common English word fitting this pattern is **CRACK** (C R A C K), but K is excluded. The next most common candidate is **CRASH**, which would be C R A S H, but S and H are also excluded.  
The only remaining plausible word is **CRAMP** (C R A M P), which fits the pattern, uses only new letters (M, P) not yet ruled out, and is a valid English word.  
Therefore I will guess **CRAMP**.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know the first three letters are C, R, A in the correct positions. The fourth and fifth letters are not N or E. We need a common English word starting with ""CRA"". Possible candidates include ""CRASH"" and ""CRACK"". Both fit the known letters and avoid the excluded letters. I'll choose ""CRASH"" as the next guess.

We have confirmed the first three letters: C (position 1), R (position 2), A (position 3).  
From guess 3 (CRACK), the fourth letter was marked “C (-)”, meaning C is in the word but not in position 4. Since we already have a C at position 1, this indicates there is a second C somewhere else, likely at position 5 (the only remaining slot).  
The letter K was marked “x”, so it is not in the word.  
Thus the pattern is **C R A _ C**.  
A common English word fitting this pattern is **CRACK** (C R A C K), but K is excluded. The next most common candidate is **CRASH**, which would be C R A S H, but S and H are also excluded.  
The only remaining plausible word is **CRAMP** (C R A M P), which fits the pattern, uses only new letters (M, P) not yet ruled out, and is a valid English word.  
Therefore I will guess **CRAMP**.
