### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

All letters from the first guess (C, R, A, N, E) are confirmed absent, so the next word must avoid those letters entirely. I’ll choose a common five‑letter word using different letters. “MIGHT” uses M, I, G, H, T – none of which were ruled out, so it’s a valid next guess.

We have eliminated letters C, R, A, N, E, M, I, G, H. The letter T is present but not in position 5.

Choose a common word fitting these constraints. “BLOTS” uses B, L, O, T, S – all allowed, and places T in position 4, satisfying the “wrong position” clue. This guess will test several new letters.

We have the following feedback so far:
- Letters C, R, A, N, E, M, I, G, H, B, L are not in the word.
- O is correct in position 3.
- T is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5 (from BLOTS) and not in position 5 (from MIGHT). Therefore T can be in position 1 or 2.
- S is in the word but not in position 5 (from BLOTS).

We need a 5‑letter word with O at the third spot, containing both T and S (with T in position 1 or 2 and S in position 1‑4 but not 5), and using only letters that haven’t been ruled out.

A suitable word is **STOOP**:
- Position 1 = S (allowed, not position 5)
- Position 2 = T (allowed, T is in position 2)
- Position 3 = O (confirmed correct)
- Positions 4‑5 = O P (both letters are not ruled out)

This guess will test the remaining unknown letters while respecting all constraints.
