### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We know from the feedback that the secret word contains the letter C, but not in the first position. The letters R, A, N, and E are not in the word at all. Therefore, the next guess must include C somewhere other than the first slot and must avoid using R, A, N, and E. A good candidate is “SCOUT,” which places C in the second position and introduces new letters S, O, U, and T to gather more information.

- From SCOUT: C is still not in positions 1 or 2; T is in the word but not in position 5.
- From PICKT: I is correct in position 2; C is not in position 3; T is not in position 4.

Thus far:
- Position 2 = I (fixed).
- C must be in position 4 or 5.
- T must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (but not 5 or 4 if C is there).
- Letters ruled out: R, A, N, E, S, O, U, P, K (and also any repeats of those).

We need a word of the form _ I _ _ _. It should contain C and T in the allowed spots and avoid the excluded letters.

A suitable candidate is **LIVIT**:
- L I V I T
- Position 2 = I (matches known correct placement).
- Contains T at position 5 (allowed, since T is not prohibited from 5 unless another rule conflicts; actually T is only prohibited from 5 by the SCOUT feedback, which we already satisfied by putting T at 5).
- Contains C? No, but we have not yet confirmed C’s location. Wait, this guess does not include C. That’s a problem.

We need a guess that includes C and T in the allowed positions. The word **LICTS** fits:
- L I C T S
- Position 2 = I (correct).
- C is at position 3 (allowed, since C cannot be 1,2,3? No, earlier we determined C can be 3,4,5, but the feedback shows C is not at 3 in PICKT, so C must be 4 or 5. Therefore LICTS with C at 3 is invalid.)

Ah, mistake. From PICKT we know C is not at position 3. So C must be at 4 or 5.  
Looking for a word with I at position 2, C at 4 or 5, T at 1,3, or (if C is at 5) 4, and no excluded letters.

The word **THICK** fits:
- T (position 1) – allowed (T not prohibited from 1).
- H (position 2) – not excluded.
- I (position 3) – allowed.
- C (position 4) – allowed (C can be at 4).
- K (position 5) – not excluded.

All letters satisfy the constraints, and the word is a valid English word. This guess will confirm the exact positions of C and T and test the remaining letters H and K.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common consonants and vowels. ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it includes two frequent consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E) in different positions, giving useful information for the next steps.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
We know from the feedback that the secret word contains the letter C, but not in the first position. The letters R, A, N, and E are not in the word at all. Therefore, the next guess must include C somewhere other than the first slot and must avoid using R, A, N, and E. A good candidate is “SCOUT,” which places C in the second position and introduces new letters S, O, U, and T to gather more information.

We have confirmed letters:
- C is in the word, but not in positions 1 or 2 (from CRANE and SCOUT feedback). So C can be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- T is in the word, but not in position 5 (from SCOUT feedback). So T can be in positions 1‑4, but not 5.

Excluded letters (not in the word): R, A, N, E, S, O, U.

We need a 5‑letter word containing C and T in allowed spots and three other letters that are not excluded.  
A good candidate is **PICKT**:
- C is in position 3 (allowed).
- T is in position 4 (allowed, not position 5).
- The remaining letters P, I, K are all allowed (none are excluded).

Thus this guess will test the positions of C and T further and introduce three new letters.

We have the following feedback:

- From CRANE: C is in the word but not in position 1.
- From SCOUT: C is still not in positions 1 or 2; T is in the word but not in position 5.
- From PICKT: I is correct in position 2; C is not in position 3; T is not in position 4.

Thus far:
- Position 2 = I (fixed).
- C must be in position 4 or 5.
- T must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (but not 5 or 4 if C is there).
- Letters ruled out: R, A, N, E, S, O, U, P, K (and also any repeats of those).

We need a word of the form _ I _ _ _. It should contain C and T in the allowed spots and avoid the excluded letters.

A suitable candidate is **LIVIT**:
- L I V I T
- Position 2 = I (matches known correct placement).
- Contains T at position 5 (allowed, since T is not prohibited from 5 unless another rule conflicts; actually T is only prohibited from 5 by the SCOUT feedback, which we already satisfied by putting T at 5).
- Contains C? No, but we have not yet confirmed C’s location. Wait, this guess does not include C. That’s a problem.

We need a guess that includes C and T in the allowed positions. The word **LICTS** fits:
- L I C T S
- Position 2 = I (correct).
- C is at position 3 (allowed, since C cannot be 1,2,3? No, earlier we determined C can be 3,4,5, but the feedback shows C is not at 3 in PICKT, so C must be 4 or 5. Therefore LICTS with C at 3 is invalid.)

Ah, mistake. From PICKT we know C is not at position 3. So C must be at 4 or 5.  
Looking for a word with I at position 2, C at 4 or 5, T at 1,3, or (if C is at 5) 4, and no excluded letters.

The word **THICK** fits:
- T (position 1) – allowed (T not prohibited from 1).
- H (position 2) – not excluded.
- I (position 3) – allowed.
- C (position 4) – allowed (C can be at 4).
- K (position 5) – not excluded.

All letters satisfy the constraints, and the word is a valid English word. This guess will confirm the exact positions of C and T and test the remaining letters H and K.

We have the following feedback:

- Guess 1 (CRANE): C is in the word but not first; R, A, N, E are not in the word.
- Guess 2 (SCOUT): C still not first; T is in the word but not fifth; S, O, U are not in the word.
- Guess 3 (PICKT): I is correct in the second position; C is in the word but not third; P, K are not in the word.
- Guess 4 (THICK): C is correct in the fourth position; I is in the word but not third; T is in the word but not first; H is in the word but not second; K is not in the word.

From this we deduce:
- Position 2 = I (fixed).
- Position 4 = C (fixed).
- Position 5 ≠ T, Position 1 ≠ T, Position 3 ≠ H, Position 2 ≠ H, Position 5 ≠ H.
- The only remaining unknown letters are positions 1, 3, and 5, which must be chosen from letters not yet ruled out (e.g., B, D, F, G, J, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z) and must avoid the excluded letters {R, A, N, E, S, O, U, P, K}.
- The word must contain T somewhere (positions 1‑3) and also contain H (position 3 or 5, but not position 2). The pattern **_ I _ C _** with H at position 5 satisfies all constraints and places T at position 3.
- A common English word fitting **_ I _ C H** is **DITCH** (D I T C H).

Thus the next guess should be “DITCH”.

We have deduced the exact positions of four letters:
- Position 2 = I (from PICKT and DITCH)
- Position 3 = T (from DITCH)
- Position 4 = C (from THICK and DITCH)
- Position 5 = H (from THICK and DITCH)

Thus the secret word follows the pattern **_ I T C H**.

Letters known not to be in the word: R, A, N, E, S, O, U, P, K, D, and also any letters that received an “x” in earlier guesses. The only common English word fitting the pattern **_ITCH** with a new first letter that hasn’t been ruled out is **MITCH** (a surname, also used as a proper noun in some contexts). No other plausible common word fits the constraints.

Therefore the next guess should be “MITCH”.
