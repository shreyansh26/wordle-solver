### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common 5‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes a vowel (A, E) and frequently used consonants (C, R, N). This will give useful information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

The feedback tells me that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word. I need a new 5‑letter guess that avoids those letters entirely. I’ll choose a common word with different letters to gather more information. “MIGHT” uses M, I, G, H, T, none of which have been ruled out yet.

We have determined from the feedback that the secret word has I, G, H, T in positions 2‑5 respectively, and the first letter is not C, R, A, N, E, M.

We have confirmed the pattern _ I G H T with I in position 2, G in 3, H in 4, T in 5. The first letter cannot be C, R, A, N, E, M, L, or R. The only common English word fitting this pattern is **IGHT** (I‑G‑H‑T), but that would make the first letter I, giving the word IIGHT, which is not a valid English word. Therefore the only remaining plausible word is **SIGHT** (S‑I‑G‑H‑T), which fits the pattern and uses a first letter S that has not been ruled out. We will guess that.
