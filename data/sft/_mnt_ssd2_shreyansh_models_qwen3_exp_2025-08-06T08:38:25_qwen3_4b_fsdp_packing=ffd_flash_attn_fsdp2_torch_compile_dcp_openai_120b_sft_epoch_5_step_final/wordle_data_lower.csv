### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback:

- From CRANE: C, A, N are not in the word. R is in the word but not in position 2. E is in the word but not in position 5.
- From RIDER: D and I are not in the word. E is correct in position 4. R is correct in position 5. R is also present elsewhere (the first‑letter R got a “‑”, confirming R exists in the word, already placed at position 5).

Thus the secret word must:
- Have **E** at position 4.
- Have **R** at position 5.
- Exclude the letters C, A, N, D, I.
- Contain no other R (since we only have one R confirmed at position 5).

We need a 5‑letter word of the form _ _ _ E R using only allowed letters. “POWER” fits perfectly: P O W E R, with E at 4 and R at 5, and none of its letters are among the excluded ones.

So the next guess will be “POWER”.
