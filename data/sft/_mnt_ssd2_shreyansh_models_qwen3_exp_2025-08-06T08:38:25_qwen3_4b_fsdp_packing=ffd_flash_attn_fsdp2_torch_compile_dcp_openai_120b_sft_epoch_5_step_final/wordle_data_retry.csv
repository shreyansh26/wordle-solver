### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters and vowels. ""CRANE"" is a popular opening guess in Wordle‑style games because it covers two common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E). This should give useful information about which letters are present and their positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
We know from the feedback:
- C, A, N are not in the word.
- R and E are in the word but not in the positions they were guessed (R not in position 2, E not in position 5).

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
- Excludes C, A, N.
- Includes R (not in position 2) and E (not in position 5).
- Introduces new letters to gather more information.

The word **SHRED** satisfies these conditions:
- Contains R (position 3) and E (position 4), both different from their previous positions.
- Uses new letters S, H, D to test additional possibilities.
- Avoids the excluded letters C, A, N.

Thus we will guess “SHRED”.

We have the following constraints from previous feedback:

- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, S, H, D.
- Letter R is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.
- Letter E is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5.

We need a new 5‑letter word that:
1. Contains R and E.
2. Places R only in positions 1, 4, or 5.
3. Places E only in positions 1, 2, or 3.
4. Uses only letters that have not been ruled out.

A good candidate is **EERIE**:
- E is in positions 1 and 3 (both allowed).
- R is in position 4 (allowed).
- All other letters (I) are not excluded.

Thus “EERIE” satisfies all constraints and introduces a new letter (I) for further testing.

We have the following constraints from previous feedback:

- Excluded letters: C, A, N, S, H, D, I.
- Letter E is in the word:
  * Position 2 is confirmed as E (from EERIE feedback).
  * E cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (all gave “-”).
- Letter R is in the word but not in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from earlier “-” feedback). Therefore R can only be in position 1 or position 5.
- No other letters have been confirmed.

We need a 5‑letter word with pattern:
- Position 2 = E
- R at position 1 or 5
- All other letters must be from the allowed set (B, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, R).

A valid word that satisfies these constraints is **FREER** (F R E E R):

- R is at position 5 (allowed)
- Uses only allowed letters (F and a second R are not excluded)

Thus the next guess should be “FREER”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

- Letter T is in the word but not at position 5 (‑ from guess 5). It also cannot be at position 2 (occupied by E) and cannot be at position 1 (R). So T must be at position 3 or 4.

All letters marked x are not in the word: C, A, N, S, H, D, I, F, B, U.

Thus the pattern is **R E _ _ _** with T at position 3 or 4, and the remaining two letters must be chosen from the allowed set {G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, T} (and possibly another R or E).

A common English word fitting these constraints is **REGOT**:
- R (pos1) ✓
- E (pos2) ✓
- G (pos3) – new letter
- O (pos4) – new letter
- T (pos5) – T not at position5 (‑ from guess5), so T must be at pos3 or 4. This guess places T at pos5, which is invalid, so REGOT does not satisfy the constraints.

Trying another word: **RETRO**:
- R (pos1) ✓
- E (pos2) ✓
- T (pos3) – places T at position 3 (allowed)
- R (pos4) – allowed (duplicate R)
- O (pos5) – new letter

This word satisfies all known constraints (R and E in correct spots, T not at position 5, no excluded letters). It is a valid English word.

Thus the next guess should be RETRO.
