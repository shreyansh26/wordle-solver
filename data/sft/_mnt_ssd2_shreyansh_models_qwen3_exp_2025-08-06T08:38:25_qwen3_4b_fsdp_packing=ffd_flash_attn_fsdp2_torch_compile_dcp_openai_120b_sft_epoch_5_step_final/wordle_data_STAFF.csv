### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- Position 4: unknown, but M and P are not in the word (x from guess 4).
- Position 5: unknown, but P is not in the word (x from guess 4).

All letters that have been marked x (not in the word) are: C, R, N, E, G, L, W, O, D, M, P.  
Letters already used and confirmed are S, T, A.

We need a word of the form **S T A _ _** that does not contain any of the eliminated letters.  
A common English word fitting this pattern is **STAKE** (S‑T‑A‑K‑E).  
However, we must check if **E** is allowed. From the first guess, E was marked x, so it cannot be used.  

The next viable candidate is **STASH** (S‑T‑A‑S‑H). It fits the pattern, uses only allowed letters (S repeats, which is fine), and introduces a new letter H for position 5. This will test whether the fourth letter is also S and whether H belongs in the word.

Thus the next guess should be “STASH”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a valid 5‑letter English word. A common starter that contains a mix of common letters is “CRANE”. This will give useful information about the presence and positions of C, R, A, N, and E in the secret word.

We know from the first guess that:
- C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word.
- A is correct and in the third position.

Thus the secret word has the form __A__ with none of the letters C, R, N, E appearing elsewhere.

We need a new 5‑letter word that respects this pattern and uses only letters not ruled out. “GLASS” fits:
- Pattern G L A S S matches __A__.
- It introduces new letters G, L, and S, none of which have been eliminated.
- Repeating S is allowed unless proven otherwise.

Therefore, “GLASS” is a valid next guess.

We have the following information:
- Position 3 is definitely A (from both guesses).
- Letters C, R, N, E, G, L are not in the word.
- Letter S is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5 (both gave “-”). Therefore S must be in position 1 or 2.
- No other letters have been confirmed.

We need a 5‑letter word of the form __A__ that includes S in position 1 or 2 and uses only letters not ruled out.  
A good candidate is **SWORD**:
- S in position 1 (satisfies the S requirement).
- Word pattern S W O R D fits __A__ with A in the third slot.
- The letters W, O, R, D have not been eliminated.

Thus “SWORD” is a valid next guess.

- The fifth letter cannot be H and also cannot be any x letters.

Possible remaining letters for positions 4‑5 are: B, F, I, J, K, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z, plus repeats of S, T, A.
