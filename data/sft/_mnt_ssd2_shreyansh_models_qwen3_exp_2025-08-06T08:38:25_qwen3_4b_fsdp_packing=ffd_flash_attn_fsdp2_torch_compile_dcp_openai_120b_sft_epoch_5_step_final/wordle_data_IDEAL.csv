### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

We have the following feedback:

- From CRANE: C, R, N are not in the word. A and E are present but in wrong positions (A not position 3, E not position 5).
- From TABLE: T and B are not in the word. A is still present but still not position 2 (so A cannot be positions 2 or 3). L is present but not position 4. E is still present but not position 5 (so E cannot be positions 2 or 5).

Thus the secret word must contain the letters **A, E, L** and two other letters that are not among {C,R,N,T,B}.  
Position constraints:
- A: cannot be 2 or 3 → possible positions 1, 4, 5.
- E: cannot be 2 or 5 → possible positions 1, 3, 4.
- L: cannot be 4 → possible positions 1, 2, 3, 5.

A word that satisfies all these constraints and uses only allowed letters is **LEAST**:
- L in position 1 (allowed),
- E in position 2 (allowed, not 2 or 5? Wait, E cannot be 2. Oh no, conflict here.)

Actually **LEAST** puts E at position 2, which is prohibited. I need a word that respects all constraints.

Consider **PALED**:
- P A L E D
- A is at position 2 (still prohibited). No good.

Try **ALIVE**:
- A L I V E
- A at 1 (allowed), L at 2 (allowed), E at 5 (prohibited). No good.

Try **ALLEY**:
- A L E L Y
- A at 1 (allowed), L at 2 and 4 (allowed), E at 3 (allowed). No prohibited letters. Uses only allowed letters (P not used, etc.). This satisfies all constraints.

Thus the next guess should be **ALLEY**.

We have determined that the secret word contains the letters A, L, and E, each in a different position than they appeared in previous guesses. The constraints are:
- A cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 → must be position 4 or 5.
- L cannot be in positions 2 or 4 → can be 1, 3, or 5.
- E cannot be in positions 3 or 5 → can be 1, 2, or 4.

A word that satisfies all these constraints and uses only allowed letters is **LEASE** (L E A S E):
- L is in position 1 (allowed).
- E appears in positions 2 and 5 (both allowed).
- A is in position 3 (still allowed, though we know it should be 4 or 5; this guess will test that).
- S is a new letter not ruled out.

Thus “LEASE” is a valid next guess.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need to start the game with a common five‑letter word that contains a mix of common letters. “CRANE” is a good starter because it includes frequently used letters C, R, A, N, and E.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
We know the secret word does not contain C, R, or N. It does contain A and E, but A is not in position 3 and E is not in position 5 (their positions in CRANE). We need a new 5‑letter word that includes A and E in different spots and avoids C, R, N. “TABLE” fits: T A B L E, with A in position 2 and E in position 5, satisfying the constraints and introducing new letters T, B, L for further clues.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: TABLE -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(-) B(x) L(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
We have the following feedback:

- From CRANE: C, R, N are not in the word. A and E are present but in wrong positions (A not position 3, E not position 5).
- From TABLE: T and B are not in the word. A is still present but still not position 2 (so A cannot be positions 2 or 3). L is present but not position 4. E is still present but not position 5 (so E cannot be positions 2 or 5).

Thus the secret word must contain the letters **A, E, L** and two other letters that are not among {C,R,N,T,B}.  
Position constraints:
- A: cannot be 2 or 3 → possible positions 1, 4, 5.
- E: cannot be 2 or 5 → possible positions 1, 3, 4.
- L: cannot be 4 → possible positions 1, 2, 3, 5.

A word that satisfies all these constraints and uses only allowed letters is **LEAST**:
- L in position 1 (allowed),
- E in position 2 (allowed, not 2 or 5? Wait, E cannot be 2. Oh no, conflict here.)

Actually **LEAST** puts E at position 2, which is prohibited. I need a word that respects all constraints.

Consider **PALED**:
- P A L E D
- A is at position 2 (still prohibited). No good.

Try **ALIVE**:
- A L I V E
- A at 1 (allowed), L at 2 (allowed), E at 5 (prohibited). No good.

Try **ALLEY**:
- A L E L Y
- A at 1 (allowed), L at 2 and 4 (allowed), E at 3 (allowed). No prohibited letters. Uses only allowed letters (P not used, etc.). This satisfies all constraints.

Thus the next guess should be **ALLEY**.

We have determined that the secret word contains the letters A, L, and E, each in a different position than they appeared in previous guesses. The constraints are:
- A cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 → must be position 4 or 5.
- L cannot be in positions 2 or 4 → can be 1, 3, or 5.
- E cannot be in positions 3 or 5 → can be 1, 2, or 4.

A word that satisfies all these constraints and uses only allowed letters is **LEASE** (L E A S E):
- L is in position 1 (allowed).
- E appears in positions 2 and 5 (both allowed).
- A is in position 3 (still allowed, though we know it should be 4 or 5; this guess will test that).
- S is a new letter not ruled out.

Thus “LEASE” is a valid next guess.

We have determined the secret word must contain the letters A, L, and E, each in a different position than previously tried. The constraints are:

- **A** cannot be in positions 1,2,3 → must be 4 or 5.
- **L** cannot be in positions 1,2,4 → can be 3 or 5.
- **E** cannot be in positions 2,3,5 → can be 1 or 4.

A word that satisfies all these constraints and uses only allowed letters is **EAGLE**:
- E is at position 1 (allowed).
- A is at position 2 (still allowed, though we know it should be 4 or 5; this guess will confirm).
- G is a new letter not ruled out.
- L is at position 4 (allowed).
- E is at position 5 (allowed).

Thus “EAGLE” is a valid next guess.

We have determined the secret word must contain the letters A, L, and E, each in a different position than previously tried. The constraints are:

- **A** cannot be in positions 1,2,3 → must be 4 or 5.
- **L** cannot be in positions 1,2,4 → can be 3 or 5.
- **E** cannot be in positions 1,2,3,5 → must be 4.

Thus the word pattern is: _ _ _ E _.  
A must be at position 5 (since 4 is taken by E and 5 is the only remaining spot for A).  
L must be at position 3 (the only remaining spot for L).

So the pattern becomes: _ _ L E A.

A common English word that fits this pattern and uses only letters not ruled out is **FULLY** (F U L L Y). It respects all positional constraints and introduces new letters F, U, Y for further testing.

Therefore the next guess is:
