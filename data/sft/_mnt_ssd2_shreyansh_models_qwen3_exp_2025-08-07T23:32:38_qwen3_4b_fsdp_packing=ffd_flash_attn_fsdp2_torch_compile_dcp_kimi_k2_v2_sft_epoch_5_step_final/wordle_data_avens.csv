### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good first guess should use as many of these as possible while avoiding repeats. 

Popular strategic choices include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it covers five very common letters (A, R, I, S, E) and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on ARISE:

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. A is fixed in the first position.
2. S is fixed in the fifth position (from ALOES feedback: S(✓)).
3. E is in the word but NOT in the 4th position (from ALOES: E(-)).
4. Letters R, I, L, O are NOT in the word at all.
5. The word pattern so far: A _ _ _ S, with E somewhere in positions 2 or 3.

Possible placements of E:
- E in 2nd: A E _ _ S
- E in 3rd: A _ E _ S

We need three more letters (positions 2/3/4 or 2/4/3) that are:
- Not R, I, L, O
- Not already used (A, E, S)

Common remaining consonants: N, T, D, C, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.

Let’s try E in 2nd: A E _ _ S
Need two consonants for positions 3 and 4, avoiding forbidden letters.
Example: A E N D S → ""AENDS"" (invalid, not a word)
A E N T S → ""AENTS"" (invalid)
A E M B S → ""AEMBS"" (invalid)
A E M T S → ""AEMTS"" (invalid)
A E N C S → ""AENCS"" (invalid)

Try E in 3rd: A _ E _ S
Example: A N E T S → ""ANETS"" (invalid)
A M E N S → ""AMENS"" (valid word, but rare)
A C E N S → ""ACENS"" (invalid)
A B E N S → ""ABENS"" (invalid)
A D E N S → ""ADENS"" (invalid)
A G E N S → ""AGENS"" (invalid)
A T E N S → ""ATENS"" (invalid)

Another pattern: A _ _ E S (but E would be 4th, which is forbidden).

Wait, we have:
- A _ _ _ S
- E must be in 2nd or 3rd.

Let’s list valid 5-letter words fitting A _ E _ S:
- A F E L S (invalid, L forbidden)
- A C E T S (invalid, T allowed, but ""ACETS"" not a word)
- A M E N S (valid, but ""AMENS"" is plural of amen, obscure)
- A D E N S (invalid)
- A B E N S (invalid)
- A G E N S (invalid)
- A P E C S (invalid)
- A P E R S (invalid, R forbidden)
- A T E N S (invalid)
- A N E T S (invalid)

Hmm, none obvious. Try E in 2nd: A E _ _ S
Valid words:
- A E G I S (invalid, I forbidden)
- A E G I S (invalid)
- A E G I S (invalid)
- A E G I S (invalid)

Wait, ""AEGIS"" has I (forbidden). 

Another approach: use remaining common letters: N, T, D, C, M, P, B, G, H, K.

Try A N E T S → ""ANETS"" (invalid)
A N E D S → ""ANEDS"" (invalid)
A T E N S → ""ATENS"" (invalid)
A M E N S → ""AMENS"" (valid, but obscure)

Alternatively, maybe E is in 3rd and we use T in 4th:
A B E T S → ""ABETS"" (valid word!)

Check constraints:
- A(✓) B E T S
- S is 5th (✓)
- E is 3rd (allowed, since E(-) only forbids 4th)
- B and T are new letters, not forbidden
- No R, I, L, O

""ABETS"" is a valid English word meaning ""cheats"" or ""deceives"".

This seems like the best next guess.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good first guess should use as many of these as possible while avoiding repeats. 

Popular strategic choices include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it covers five very common letters (A, R, I, S, E) and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ARISE:
- A is in the correct first position.
- R is not in the word at all.
- I is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So far we know:
- The word starts with A.
- It contains S and E, but S is not in position 4 and E is not in position 5.
- It does not contain R or I.

We need a 5-letter word starting with A, containing S and E, avoiding positions 4 for S and 5 for E, and avoiding letters R and I.

Possible structure: A _ _ _ _ with S and E somewhere inside, but S not in 4th and E not in 5th.

Let's think of words:
- A S _ _ E (but E would be in 5th, which is invalid)
- A _ S _ E (E in 5th invalid)
- A _ _ S E (E in 5th invalid)
- A _ _ E S (S in 5th, possible)
- A S E _ _ (S in 2nd, E in 3rd, possible)
- A _ S E _ (S in 3rd, E in 4th, possible)

Looking for words:
- A S E _ _ : Could be ""ASENS"" (but not a valid word), ""ASELS"" (no), ""ASEMS"" (no)
- A _ S E _ : ""ABUSE"" (but U is allowed), ""ACRES"" (R is invalid), ""ADSET"" (no), ""AGUES"" (no), ""AMUSE"" (U is allowed)
- A _ _ E S : ""ABASE"" (but A is already fixed in 1st), ""ACETS"" (no), ""AGLES"" (no), ""ALOES"" (O allowed), ""AMNES"" (no), ""ANDES"" (N allowed), ""AUDIO"" (no)

""ALOES"" seems valid: A L O E S
- Starts with A (✓)
- Contains S and E (✓)
- S is in 5th position (allowed, since feedback only said S is not in 4th)
- E is in 4th position (allowed, since feedback only said E is not in 5th)
- No R or I (✓)

Another option: ""AMUSE"" - A M U S E
- S is in 4th (invalid per feedback)
- E is in 5th (invalid per feedback)

""AGUES"" - A G U E S
- E in 4th (ok), S in 5th (ok), no R or I.

But ""ALOES"" seems better as it uses more common letters.

I'll go with ALOES.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. A is fixed in the first position.
2. S is fixed in the fifth position (from ALOES feedback: S(✓)).
3. E is in the word but NOT in the 4th position (from ALOES: E(-)).
4. Letters R, I, L, O are NOT in the word at all.
5. The word pattern so far: A _ _ _ S, with E somewhere in positions 2 or 3.

Possible placements of E:
- E in 2nd: A E _ _ S
- E in 3rd: A _ E _ S

We need three more letters (positions 2/3/4 or 2/4/3) that are:
- Not R, I, L, O
- Not already used (A, E, S)

Common remaining consonants: N, T, D, C, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.

Let’s try E in 2nd: A E _ _ S
Need two consonants for positions 3 and 4, avoiding forbidden letters.
Example: A E N D S → ""AENDS"" (invalid, not a word)
A E N T S → ""AENTS"" (invalid)
A E M B S → ""AEMBS"" (invalid)
A E M T S → ""AEMTS"" (invalid)
A E N C S → ""AENCS"" (invalid)

Example: A N E T S → ""ANETS"" (invalid)
A M E N S → ""AMENS"" (valid word, but rare)
A C E N S → ""ACENS"" (invalid)
A B E N S → ""ABENS"" (invalid)
A D E N S → ""ADENS"" (invalid)
A G E N S → ""AGENS"" (invalid)
A T E N S → ""ATENS"" (invalid)

- A G E N S (invalid)
- A P E C S (invalid)
- A P E R S (invalid, R forbidden)
- A T E N S (invalid)

Hmm, none obvious. Try E in 2nd: A E _ _ S
Valid words:
- A E G I S (invalid, I forbidden)
- A E G I S (invalid)
- A E G I S (invalid)

- A _ _ S E (E in 5th invalid)
- A _ _ E S (S in 5th, possible)
- A S E _ _ (S in 2nd, E in 3rd, possible)
- A _ S E _ (S in 3rd, E in 4th, possible)

Looking for words:
- A S E _ _ : Could be ""ASENS"" (but not a valid word), ""ASELS"" (no), ""ASEMS"" (no)
- A _ S E _ : ""ABUSE"" (but U is allowed), ""ACRES"" (R is invalid), ""ADSET"" (no), ""AGUES"" (no), ""AMUSE"" (U is allowed)
- A _ _ E S : ""ABASE"" (but A is already fixed in 1st), ""ACETS"" (no), ""AGLES"" (no), ""ALOES"" (O allowed), ""AMNES"" (no), ""ANDES"" (N allowed), ""AUDIO"" (no)

""ALOES"" seems valid: A L O E S
- Starts with A (✓)
- Contains S and E (✓)
- S is in 5th position (allowed, since feedback only said S is not in 4th)
- E is in 4th position (allowed, since feedback only said E is not in 5th)
- No R or I (✓)

Another option: ""AMUSE"" - A M U S E
- S is in 4th (invalid per feedback)
- E is in 5th (invalid per feedback)

""AGUES"" - A G U E S
- E in 4th (ok), S in 5th (ok), no R or I.

But ""ALOES"" seems better as it uses more common letters.

I'll go with ALOES.

Guess 2: ALOES -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(x) O(x) E(-) S(✓)

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. A is fixed in the first position.
2. S is fixed in the fifth position (from ALOES feedback: S(✓)).
3. E is in the word but NOT in the 4th position (from ALOES: E(-)).
4. Letters R, I, L, O are NOT in the word at all.
5. The word pattern so far: A _ _ _ S, with E somewhere in positions 2 or 3.

Possible placements of E:
- E in 2nd: A E _ _ S
- E in 3rd: A _ E _ S

We need three more letters (positions 2/3/4 or 2/4/3) that are:
- Not R, I, L, O
- Not already used (A, E, S)

Common remaining consonants: N, T, D, C, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.

Let’s try E in 2nd: A E _ _ S
Need two consonants for positions 3 and 4, avoiding forbidden letters.
Example: A E N D S → ""AENDS"" (invalid, not a word)
A E N T S → ""AENTS"" (invalid)
A E M B S → ""AEMBS"" (invalid)
A E M T S → ""AEMTS"" (invalid)
A E N C S → ""AENCS"" (invalid)

Try E in 3rd: A _ E _ S
Example: A N E T S → ""ANETS"" (invalid)
A M E N S → ""AMENS"" (valid word, but rare)
A C E N S → ""ACENS"" (invalid)
A B E N S → ""ABENS"" (invalid)
A D E N S → ""ADENS"" (invalid)
A G E N S → ""AGENS"" (invalid)
A T E N S → ""ATENS"" (invalid)

Another pattern: A _ _ E S (but E would be 4th, which is forbidden).

Wait, we have:
- A _ _ _ S
- E must be in 2nd or 3rd.

Let’s list valid 5-letter words fitting A _ E _ S:
- A F E L S (invalid, L forbidden)
- A C E T S (invalid, T allowed, but ""ACETS"" not a word)
- A M E N S (valid, but ""AMENS"" is plural of amen, obscure)
- A D E N S (invalid)
- A B E N S (invalid)
- A G E N S (invalid)
- A P E C S (invalid)
- A P E R S (invalid, R forbidden)
- A T E N S (invalid)
- A N E T S (invalid)

Hmm, none obvious. Try E in 2nd: A E _ _ S
Valid words:
- A E G I S (invalid, I forbidden)
- A E G I S (invalid)
- A E G I S (invalid)
- A E G I S (invalid)

Wait, ""AEGIS"" has I (forbidden). 

Another approach: use remaining common letters: N, T, D, C, M, P, B, G, H, K.

Try A N E T S → ""ANETS"" (invalid)
A N E D S → ""ANEDS"" (invalid)
A T E N S → ""ATENS"" (invalid)
A M E N S → ""AMENS"" (valid, but obscure)

Alternatively, maybe E is in 3rd and we use T in 4th:
A B E T S → ""ABETS"" (valid word!)

Check constraints:
- A(✓) B E T S
- S is 5th (✓)
- E is 3rd (allowed, since E(-) only forbids 4th)
- B and T are new letters, not forbidden
- No R, I, L, O

""ABETS"" is a valid English word meaning ""cheats"" or ""deceives"".

This seems like the best next guess.

We need two more letters for positions 2 and 4, chosen from the remaining alphabet excluding the forbidden letters. Remaining common consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible words fitting A _ E _ S:
- A C E N S → ""ACENS"" (invalid)
- A C E D S → ""ACEDS"" (invalid)
- A F E D S → ""AFEDS"" (invalid)
- A G E N S → ""AGENS"" (invalid)

- A N E T S → ""ANETS"" (invalid)
- A N E D S → ""ANEDS"" (invalid)
- A N E C S → ""AN ECS"" (invalid)

- A P E C S (invalid)
- A P E D S (invalid)
- A P E R S (invalid, R forbidden)
- A W E S E (invalid)
- A M E N S seems the only valid one left.

But ""AMENS"" is a valid word (plural of ""amen"" in religious contexts).

Check constraints:
- A(✓) M E N S
- S is 5th (✓)
- E is 3rd (✓)
- M and N are new letters, not forbidden
- No R, I, L, O, B, T

Thus, ""AMENS"" is the only valid word left that fits all constraints.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good first guess should use as many of these as possible while avoiding repeats. 

Popular strategic choices include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it covers five very common letters (A, R, I, S, E) and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ARISE:
- A is in the correct first position.
- R is not in the word at all.
- I is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So far we know:
- The word starts with A.
- It contains S and E, but S is not in position 4 and E is not in position 5.
- It does not contain R or I.

We need a 5-letter word starting with A, containing S and E, avoiding positions 4 for S and 5 for E, and avoiding letters R and I.

Possible structure: A _ _ _ _ with S and E somewhere inside, but S not in 4th and E not in 5th.

Let's think of words:
- A S _ _ E (but E would be in 5th, which is invalid)
- A _ S _ E (E in 5th invalid)

- A _ _ E S (S in 5th, possible)
- A S E _ _ (S in 2nd, E in 3rd, possible)
- A _ S E _ (S in 3rd, E in 4th, possible)

Looking for words:
- A S E _ _ : Could be ""ASENS"" (but not a valid word), ""ASELS"" (no), ""ASEMS"" (no)
- A _ S E _ : ""ABUSE"" (but U is allowed), ""ACRES"" (R is invalid), ""ADSET"" (no), ""AGUES"" (no), ""AMUSE"" (U is allowed)
- A _ _ E S : ""ABASE"" (but A is already fixed in 1st), ""ACETS"" (no), ""AGLES"" (no), ""ALOES"" (O allowed), ""AMNES"" (no), ""ANDES"" (N allowed), ""AUDIO"" (no)

""ALOES"" seems valid: A L O E S
- Starts with A (✓)
- Contains S and E (✓)
- S is in 5th position (allowed, since feedback only said S is not in 4th)
- E is in 4th position (allowed, since feedback only said E is not in 5th)
- No R or I (✓)

Another option: ""AMUSE"" - A M U S E
- S is in 4th (invalid per feedback)
- E is in 5th (invalid per feedback)

""AGUES"" - A G U E S
- E in 4th (ok), S in 5th (ok), no R or I.

But ""ALOES"" seems better as it uses more common letters.

I'll go with ALOES.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: ALOES -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(x) O(x) E(-) S(✓)

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. A is fixed in the first position.
2. S is fixed in the fifth position (from ALOES feedback: S(✓)).
3. E is in the word but NOT in the 4th position (from ALOES: E(-)).
4. Letters R, I, L, O are NOT in the word at all.
5. The word pattern so far: A _ _ _ S, with E somewhere in positions 2 or 3.

Possible placements of E:
- E in 2nd: A E _ _ S
- E in 3rd: A _ E _ S

We need three more letters (positions 2/3/4 or 2/4/3) that are:
- Not R, I, L, O
- Not already used (A, E, S)

Common remaining consonants: N, T, D, C, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.

Let’s try E in 2nd: A E _ _ S
Need two consonants for positions 3 and 4, avoiding forbidden letters.
Example: A E N D S → ""AENDS"" (invalid, not a word)
A E N T S → ""AENTS"" (invalid)
A E M B S → ""AEMBS"" (invalid)
A E M T S → ""AEMTS"" (invalid)
A E N C S → ""AENCS"" (invalid)

Try E in 3rd: A _ E _ S
Example: A N E T S → ""ANETS"" (invalid)
A M E N S → ""AMENS"" (valid word, but rare)
A C E N S → ""ACENS"" (invalid)
A B E N S → ""ABENS"" (invalid)
A D E N S → ""ADENS"" (invalid)
A G E N S → ""AGENS"" (invalid)
A T E N S → ""ATENS"" (invalid)

Another pattern: A _ _ E S (but E would be 4th, which is forbidden).

Wait, we have:
- A _ _ _ S
- E must be in 2nd or 3rd.

Let’s list valid 5-letter words fitting A _ E _ S:
- A F E L S (invalid, L forbidden)
- A C E T S (invalid, T allowed, but ""ACETS"" not a word)
- A M E N S (valid, but ""AMENS"" is plural of amen, obscure)
- A D E N S (invalid)
- A B E N S (invalid)
- A G E N S (invalid)
- A P E C S (invalid)
- A P E R S (invalid, R forbidden)
- A T E N S (invalid)
- A N E T S (invalid)

Hmm, none obvious. Try E in 2nd: A E _ _ S
Valid words:
- A E G I S (invalid, I forbidden)
- A E G I S (invalid)
- A E G I S (invalid)
- A E G I S (invalid)

Wait, ""AEGIS"" has I (forbidden). 

Another approach: use remaining common letters: N, T, D, C, M, P, B, G, H, K.

Try A N E T S → ""ANETS"" (invalid)
A N E D S → ""ANEDS"" (invalid)
A T E N S → ""ATENS"" (invalid)
A M E N S → ""AMENS"" (valid, but obscure)

Alternatively, maybe E is in 3rd and we use T in 4th:
A B E T S → ""ABETS"" (valid word!)

Check constraints:
- A(✓) B E T S
- S is 5th (✓)
- E is 3rd (allowed, since E(-) only forbids 4th)
- B and T are new letters, not forbidden
- No R, I, L, O

""ABETS"" is a valid English word meaning ""cheats"" or ""deceives"".

This seems like the best next guess.

2. ALOES → A(✓) L(x) O(x) E(-) S(✓)
3. ABETS → A(✓) B(x) E(✓) T(x) S(✓)

What we know:
- Position 1: A (fixed)
- Position 5: S (fixed)
- Position 3: E (fixed)
- Forbidden letters so far: R, I, L, O, B, T
- Word pattern: A _ E _ S

We need two more letters for positions 2 and 4, chosen from the remaining alphabet excluding the forbidden letters. Remaining common consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible words fitting A _ E _ S:
- A C E N S → ""ACENS"" (invalid)
- A C E D S → ""ACEDS"" (invalid)
- A F E D S → ""AFEDS"" (invalid)
- A G E N S → ""AGENS"" (invalid)

- A M E N S → ""AMENS"" (valid but obscure)
- A N E C S → ""AN ECS"" (invalid)
- A N E D S → ""ANEDS"" (invalid)
- A N E T S → ""ANETS"" (invalid)
- A N E D S → ""ANEDS"" (invalid)
- A N E C S → ""AN ECS"" (invalid)

Wait, let's list valid English words fitting A _ E _ S:
- A C E D S (invalid)
- A F E D S (invalid)
- A G E N S (invalid)
- A M E N S (valid, plural of ""amen"")
- A N E C S (invalid)
- A N E D S (invalid)
- A N E T S (invalid)
- A P E C S (invalid)
- A P E D S (invalid)
- A P E R S (invalid, R forbidden)
- A W E S E (invalid)
- A M E N S seems the only valid one left.

But ""AMENS"" is a valid word (plural of ""amen"" in religious contexts).

Check constraints:
- A(✓) M E N S
- S is 5th (✓)
- E is 3rd (✓)
- M and N are new letters, not forbidden
- No R, I, L, O, B, T

Thus, ""AMENS"" is the only valid word left that fits all constraints.

From the feedback so far:

- Position 1: A (fixed)
- Position 3: E (fixed)
- Position 5: S (fixed)
- Position 4: N (fixed)
- Forbidden letters: R, I, L, O, B, T, M

So the word pattern is now: A _ E N S

We only need a single letter for position 2, chosen from remaining letters (excluding the forbidden ones). Remaining common letters: C, D, F, G, H, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Valid English words fitting A _ E N S:
- A C E N S (invalid, ""ACENS"" not a word)
- A D E N S (invalid)
- A F E N S (invalid)
- A G E N S (invalid)
- A H E N S (invalid)
- A K E N S (invalid)
- A P E N S (invalid)
- A V E N S (invalid)
- A W E N S (invalid)
- A Y E N S (invalid)

Wait, let's think differently. The word must be A _ E N S. The only valid English word I can recall is ""AGENS"" (but it's not common) or ""ACENS"" (invalid). However, ""ACENS"" is not a valid word. 

Actually, let me double-check: ""ACENS"" is not recognized. The correct word fitting this pattern is ""ACENS"" (invalid), ""ADENS"" (invalid), etc. 

But ""ACENS"" is not valid. The only valid word seems to be ""AGENS"" (which is also obscure). 

Wait, let me think of ""ACENS"" - no. 

Actually, the correct word is ""ACENS"" (invalid). 

But I realize now - the only valid word fitting A _ E N S is ""ACENS"" (invalid), ""ADENS"" (invalid), etc. 

This suggests I might have missed something. Let me re-examine:

Valid 5-letter words ending in ""E N S"":
- AGENS (invalid)
- AGUES (invalid, U not yet tested)
- AGNES (valid, ""AGNES"" is a name but also a word)

""AGNES"" fits:
- A G E N S
- G is not forbidden (forbidden: R, I, L, O, B, T, M)
- All other positions match (A, E, N, S)
- ""AGNES"" is a valid English word (name and surname)

Thus, ""AGNES"" is the correct guess.

From the feedback on AGNES:
- A(✓) G(x) N(-) E(-) S(✓)

What we now know:

1. Fixed positions:
   - Position 1: A
   - Position 5: S

2. Letters in the word but wrong positions:
   - N is in the word but NOT in position 4
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 3

3. Forbidden letters so far:
   R, I, L, O, B, T, M, G

4. Word pattern so far: A _ _ _ S with E and N somewhere inside.

Possible positions for E and N:
- E cannot be in position 3
- N cannot be in position 4

So possible placements:
- E in position 2 or 4
- N in position 2, 3 or 4 (but not 4 if E is there)

But since we have only 3 unknown positions (2,3,4) and two letters to place (E and N), let's list possibilities:

Pattern: A _ _ _ S

Case 1: E in position 2
   A E _ _ S
   Then N must be in 3 or 4
   - A E N _ S → but N cannot be in 4 (from AGNES feedback), so N must be in 3 → A E N _ S
   - A E _ N S → but E cannot be in 3 (already satisfied), N in 4 is forbidden, so invalid

Case 2: E in position 4
   A _ _ E S
   Then N must be in 2 or 3
   - A N _ E S
   - A _ N E S

Now we need to fill the remaining position with a letter not yet forbidden (not R, I, L, O, B, T, M, G).

Remaining common letters: C, D, F, H, K, P, V, W, Y

Let's check valid English words:

From Case 1: A E N _ S
   - AEN_S → ""AENIS"" (invalid), ""AENCS"" (invalid), etc. No valid words.

From Case 2: A N _ E S
   - A N C E S → ""ANCES"" (valid word: archaic past participle of ""an"" but not common)
   - A N D E S → ""ANDES"" (valid word: Andes mountains)
   - A N F E S → invalid
   - A N H E S → invalid
   - A N K E S → invalid
   - A N P E S → invalid
   - A N V E S → invalid
   - A N W E S → invalid
   - A N Y E S → invalid

Between ""ANDES"" and ""ANCES"", ""ANDES"" is clearly the valid word.

Check constraints:
- A N D E S
- A(✓) N D E S
- N is in position 2 (allowed, since N was only forbidden in 4)
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since E was only forbidden in 3)
- D is new and not forbidden
- All other constraints satisfied

Thus, the correct guess is ""ANDES"".

<guess>ANDES</guess>",ANDES,"From the feedback on AGNES:
- A(✓) G(x) N(-) E(-) S(✓)

What we now know:

1. Fixed positions:
   - Position 1: A
   - Position 5: S

2. Letters in the word but wrong positions:
   - N is in the word but NOT in position 4
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 3

3. Forbidden letters so far:
   R, I, L, O, B, T, M, G

4. Word pattern so far: A _ _ _ S with E and N somewhere inside.

Possible positions for E and N:
- E cannot be in position 3
- N cannot be in position 4

So possible placements:
- E in position 2 or 4
- N in position 2, 3 or 4 (but not 4 if E is there)

But since we have only 3 unknown positions (2,3,4) and two letters to place (E and N), let's list possibilities:

Pattern: A _ _ _ S

Case 1: E in position 2
   A E _ _ S
   Then N must be in 3 or 4
   - A E N _ S → but N cannot be in 4 (from AGNES feedback), so N must be in 3 → A E N _ S
   - A E _ N S → but E cannot be in 3 (already satisfied), N in 4 is forbidden, so invalid

Case 2: E in position 4
   A _ _ E S
   Then N must be in 2 or 3
   - A N _ E S
   - A _ N E S

Now we need to fill the remaining position with a letter not yet forbidden (not R, I, L, O, B, T, M, G).

Remaining common letters: C, D, F, H, K, P, V, W, Y

Let's check valid English words:

From Case 1: A E N _ S
   - AEN_S → ""AENIS"" (invalid), ""AENCS"" (invalid), etc. No valid words.

From Case 2: A N _ E S
   - A N C E S → ""ANCES"" (valid word: archaic past participle of ""an"" but not common)
   - A N D E S → ""ANDES"" (valid word: Andes mountains)
   - A N F E S → invalid
   - A N H E S → invalid
   - A N K E S → invalid
   - A N P E S → invalid
   - A N V E S → invalid
   - A N W E S → invalid
   - A N Y E S → invalid

Between ""ANDES"" and ""ANCES"", ""ANDES"" is clearly the valid word.

Check constraints:
- A N D E S
- A(✓) N D E S
- N is in position 2 (allowed, since N was only forbidden in 4)
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since E was only forbidden in 3)
- D is new and not forbidden
- All other constraints satisfied

Thus, the correct guess is ""ANDES"".",Guess 6: ANDES -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) N(-) D(x) E(-) S(✓),FAIL
