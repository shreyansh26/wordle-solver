1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by covering as many common letters as possible. A good strategy is to choose a word with frequently used letters in the English language. Common letters include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L is not in the word.
- A is not in the word.
- T is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:

- Does NOT contain L, A, or T.
- S is not in position 1.
- E is not in position 5.

Next, we want to:
1. Keep S and E (since they are confirmed).
2. Avoid L, A, T.
3. Try new common letters to maximize information gain.

Good next letters to test: R, I, N, O, U, C, H, etc.

A strong candidate is ""SHINE"":
- S in position 1 (but we know S is not in position 1 from feedback, so this is risky).
Another candidate is ""RISEN"":
- R, I, S, E, N.
- S is in position 3 (possible, since S can't be in 1 or 5 from feedback, but we don't know about 3).

- E (and it is in position 4)

Letters known NOT to be in the word:

So the pattern so far is:
_ _ _ E _

Possible positions for S:
- Positions 2 or 4 (but 4 is already E), so only position 2 is left for S.

So the word must look like: _ S _ E _

We still need three more letters, none of which can be L, A, T, R, I, N.

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y

We need two more consonants and one more vowel (since we have S and E already). The vowels left are O, U (A and I are out).

Let's think of common 5-letter words fitting _ S _ E _ with no forbidden letters.

Possible candidates:
- ""HOUSE"" - but H, O, U, S, E. Check: H, O, U are allowed, S and E are correct. Pattern: _ S _ E _ - but HOUSE is H O U S E, which is H(1), O(2), U(3), S(4), E(5). Doesn't fit _ S _ E _ because S is in 4 and E in 5, but E must be in 4. So no.

- ""MUSLE"" - but L is forbidden.

- ""FUSE"" - too short.

- ""SPEKE"" - but E is in 4, so S P E K E - but that's 5 letters, but E must be in 4, so S P _ E _.

Letters allowed: any except L, A, T, R, I, N

Possible letters for position 1: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible letters for position 3: same list

Let's think of common words:
- ""HOUSE"" - doesn't fit pattern
- ""MOSHE"" - but H is allowed, but is it a word? Maybe not common
- ""KSE"" - no
- ""PSE"" - no
- ""DULSE"" - but L is forbidden
- ""CUSE"" - no
- ""MUSE"" - too short
- ""GUSLE"" - L forbidden
- ""WUSLE"" - L forbidden
- ""HUSLE"" - L forbidden

Wait, maybe ""HOUSE"" was wrong, let's think differently.

Actually, the pattern is _ S _ E _ with E fixed in position 4.

Possible words:
- ""BUSED"" - but D is allowed, B, U, S, E, D. Pattern: B S U E D - but E is in 4, so this is B S U E D - but this is 5 letters: B(1), S(2), U(3), E(4), D(5). This fits _ S _ E _.

Check letters: B, S, U, E, D. None are forbidden (L, A, T, R, I, N are out). This seems valid.

Current constraints:

Letters known to be in the word:
- S (but not in positions 1, 3, or 5)
- E (and it is in position 4)

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
- L, A, T, R, I, N

So the pattern so far is:
_ _ _ E _

Possible positions for S:
- Positions 2 or 4 (but 4 is already E), so only position 2 is left for S.

So the word must look like: _ S _ E _

We still need three more letters, none of which can be L, A, T, R, I, N.

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y

We need two more consonants and one more vowel (since we have S and E already). The vowels left are O, U (A and I are out).

Let's think of common 5-letter words fitting _ S _ E _ with no forbidden letters.

Possible candidates:
- ""HOUSE"" - but H, O, U, S, E. Check: H, O, U are allowed, S and E are correct. Pattern: _ S _ E _ - but HOUSE is H O U S E, which is H(1), O(2), U(3), S(4), E(5). Doesn't fit _ S _ E _ because S is in 4 and E in 5, but E must be in 4. So no.

- ""MUSLE"" - but L is forbidden.

- ""FUSE"" - too short.

- ""SPEKE"" - but E is in 4, so S P E K E - but that's 5 letters, but E must be in 4, so S P _ E _.

Wait, let's think systematically:

Pattern: _ S _ E _

Letters allowed: any except L, A, T, R, I, N

Possible letters for position 1: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible letters for position 3: same list

Let's think of common words:
- ""HOUSE"" - doesn't fit pattern
- ""MOSHE"" - but H is allowed, but is it a word? Maybe not common
- ""KSE"" - no
- ""PSE"" - no
- ""DULSE"" - but L is forbidden
- ""CUSE"" - no
- ""MUSE"" - too short
- ""GUSLE"" - L forbidden
- ""WUSLE"" - L forbidden
- ""HUSLE"" - L forbidden

Wait, maybe ""HOUSE"" was wrong, let's think differently.

Actually, the pattern is _ S _ E _ with E fixed in position 4.

Possible words:
- ""BUSED"" - but D is allowed, B, U, S, E, D. Pattern: B S U E D - but E is in 4, so this is B S U E D - but this is 5 letters: B(1), S(2), U(3), E(4), D(5). This fits _ S _ E _.

Check letters: B, S, U, E, D. None are forbidden (L, A, T, R, I, N are out). This seems valid.

Another option: ""CUSED"" - but C, U, S, E, D - same pattern.

""BUSED"" seems more common.

Let's update our constraints based on the new feedback:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by covering as many common letters as possible. A good strategy is to choose a word with frequently used letters in the English language. Common letters include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L is not in the word.
- A is not in the word.
- T is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E.
- Does NOT contain L, A, or T.
- S is not in position 1.
- E is not in position 5.

Next, we want to:
1. Keep S and E (since they are confirmed).
2. Avoid L, A, T.
3. Try new common letters to maximize information gain.

Good next letters to test: R, I, N, O, U, C, H, etc.

A strong candidate is ""SHINE"":
- S in position 1 (but we know S is not in position 1 from feedback, so this is risky).
Another candidate is ""RISEN"":
- R, I, S, E, N.
- S is in position 3 (possible, since S can't be in 1 or 5 from feedback, but we don't know about 3).
- E is in position 4 (possible, since E can't be in 5 but could be in 4).
- Introduces R, I, N which are common.

""RISEN"" seems good as it tests R, I, N while keeping S and E in new positions.

Let's extract every constraint from the four guesses so far.

Letters that MUST be in the word:
- E (position 4 is locked)
- S (must appear somewhere, but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

Wait, that's impossible: S cannot be in any position.  
The feedback for POSSE shows S(-) in both positions 3 and 4, meaning S is in the word but NOT in those positions.  
But position 5 is the only remaining slot for S, and the feedback for S(-) in position 5 implies S is NOT in position 5 either.

This contradiction means our earlier assumption was wrong: S cannot be in the word at all, yet every guess has marked S as ""-"" (present but wrong place). The only resolution is that S must be in the word, and the only position left is position 5, but the feedback says S is NOT in position 5. This is a paradox.

Re-examining the feedback for POSSE:
- P(x) – P is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in position 2.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

But we already know from RISEN that E is in position 4 (✓). So E is in position 4, and from POSSE E(-) in position 5 is redundant (E is already confirmed in 4). The critical new info is:
- O is in position 2 (✓).
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4.
- E is in position 4 (already known).

So the word pattern now is:
_ O _ E _

S must fit in position 1 or 5. From earlier feedback:
- S cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (from SLATE S(-) in 1, RISEN S(-) in 3, BUSED S(-) in 3, POSSE S(-) in 3 and 4).  
Wait, let's list all S positions and their feedback:
- SLATE: S(-) in position 1 → S not in 1.
- RISEN: S(-) in position 3 → S not in 3.
- BUSED: S(-) in position 3 → S not in 3 (duplicate).
- POSSE: S(-) in positions 3 and 4 → S not in 3 or 4.

So S can only be in position 2 or 5. But position 2 is O (✓), so S must be in position 5.

Therefore the word must be: _ O _ E S

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
L, A, T, R, I, N, U, D, P.

Remaining allowed letters for positions 1 and 3: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y, plus O and E are already placed.

Common 5-letter words fitting _ O _ E S:
- ""HOUSE"" – H, O, U, S, E → U is forbidden.
- ""MOOSE"" – M, O, O, S, E → second O is allowed, but we need _ O _ E S, so MOOSE is M O O E S – fits! Check letters: M, O, O, E, S. All allowed.
- ""COVES"" – C, O, V, E, S – but E must be in position 4, so C O V E S – fits! Letters: C, O, V, E, S – all allowed.
- ""FOGES"" – not a common word.
- ""GOGES"" – not a word.
- ""HOMES"" – H, O, M, E, S – but E must be in position 4, so H O M E S – fits! Letters: H, O, M, E, S – all allowed.

Between ""COVES"", ""HOMES"", and ""MOOSE"", ""HOMES"" is the most common word and fits perfectly.

Let's verify:
- H: not forbidden
- O: in position 2 (✓)
- M: not forbidden
- E: in position 4 (✓)
- S: in position 5 (must be here based on constraints)

This satisfies every constraint.

Letters that MUST be in the word:
- E (position 4 is locked)

Re-examining the feedback for POSSE:
- P(x) – P is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in position 2.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

But we already know from RISEN that E is in position 4 (✓). So E is in position 4, and from POSSE E(-) in position 5 is redundant (E is already confirmed in 4). The critical new info is:
- O is in position 2 (✓).
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4.
- E is in position 4 (already known).

So the word pattern now is:
_ O _ E _

S must fit in position 1 or 5. From earlier feedback:
- S cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (from SLATE S(-) in 1, RISEN S(-) in 3, BUSED S(-) in 3, POSSE S(-) in 3 and 4).  
Wait, let's list all S positions and their feedback:
- SLATE: S(-) in position 1 → S not in 1.
- RISEN: S(-) in position 3 → S not in 3.
- BUSED: S(-) in position 3 → S not in 3 (duplicate).
- POSSE: S(-) in positions 3 and 4 → S not in 3 or 4.

So S can only be in position 2 or 5. But position 2 is O (✓), so S must be in position 5.

Therefore the word must be: _ O _ E S

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
L, A, T, R, I, N, U, D, P.

Remaining allowed letters for positions 1 and 3: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y, plus O and E are already placed.

Common 5-letter words fitting _ O _ E S:
- ""HOUSE"" – H, O, U, S, E → U is forbidden.
- ""MOOSE"" – M, O, O, S, E → second O is allowed, but we need _ O _ E S, so MOOSE is M O O E S – fits! Check letters: M, O, O, E, S. All allowed.
- ""COVES"" – C, O, V, E, S – but E must be in position 4, so C O V E S – fits! Letters: C, O, V, E, S – all allowed.
- ""FOGES"" – not a common word.
- ""GOGES"" – not a word.
- ""HOMES"" – H, O, M, E, S – but E must be in position 4, so H O M E S – fits! Letters: H, O, M, E, S – all allowed.

Between ""COVES"", ""HOMES"", and ""MOOSE"", ""HOMES"" is the most common word and fits perfectly.

Let's verify:
- H: not forbidden
- O: in position 2 (✓)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by covering as many common letters as possible. A good strategy is to choose a word with frequently used letters in the English language. Common letters include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L is not in the word.
- A is not in the word.
- T is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E.
- Does NOT contain L, A, or T.
- S is not in position 1.
- E is not in position 5.

Next, we want to:
1. Keep S and E (since they are confirmed).
2. Avoid L, A, T.
3. Try new common letters to maximize information gain.

Good next letters to test: R, I, N, O, U, C, H, etc.

A strong candidate is ""SHINE"":
- S in position 1 (but we know S is not in position 1 from feedback, so this is risky).
Another candidate is ""RISEN"":
- R, I, S, E, N.
- S is in position 3 (possible, since S can't be in 1 or 5 from feedback, but we don't know about 3).
- E is in position 4 (possible, since E can't be in 5 but could be in 4).
- Introduces R, I, N which are common.

""RISEN"" seems good as it tests R, I, N while keeping S and E in new positions.

Current constraints:

Letters known to be in the word:
- S (but not in positions 1, 3, or 5)
- E (and it is in position 4)

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
- L, A, T, R, I, N

So the pattern so far is:
_ _ _ E _

Possible positions for S:
- Positions 2 or 4 (but 4 is already E), so only position 2 is left for S.

So the word must look like: _ S _ E _

We still need three more letters, none of which can be L, A, T, R, I, N.

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y

We need two more consonants and one more vowel (since we have S and E already). The vowels left are O, U (A and I are out).

Let's think of common 5-letter words fitting _ S _ E _ with no forbidden letters.

Possible candidates:
- ""HOUSE"" - but H, O, U, S, E. Check: H, O, U are allowed, S and E are correct. Pattern: _ S _ E _ - but HOUSE is H O U S E, which is H(1), O(2), U(3), S(4), E(5). Doesn't fit _ S _ E _ because S is in 4 and E in 5, but E must be in 4. So no.

- ""MUSLE"" - but L is forbidden.

- ""FUSE"" - too short.

- ""SPEKE"" - but E is in 4, so S P E K E - but that's 5 letters, but E must be in 4, so S P _ E _.

Wait, let's think systematically:

Pattern: _ S _ E _

Letters allowed: any except L, A, T, R, I, N

Possible letters for position 1: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible letters for position 3: same list

Let's think of common words:
- ""HOUSE"" - doesn't fit pattern
- ""MOSHE"" - but H is allowed, but is it a word? Maybe not common
- ""KSE"" - no
- ""PSE"" - no
- ""DULSE"" - but L is forbidden
- ""CUSE"" - no
- ""MUSE"" - too short
- ""GUSLE"" - L forbidden
- ""WUSLE"" - L forbidden
- ""HUSLE"" - L forbidden

Wait, maybe ""HOUSE"" was wrong, let's think differently.

Actually, the pattern is _ S _ E _ with E fixed in position 4.

Possible words:
- ""BUSED"" - but D is allowed, B, U, S, E, D. Pattern: B S U E D - but E is in 4, so this is B S U E D - but this is 5 letters: B(1), S(2), U(3), E(4), D(5). This fits _ S _ E _.

Check letters: B, S, U, E, D. None are forbidden (L, A, T, R, I, N are out). This seems valid.

Another option: ""CUSED"" - but C, U, S, E, D - same pattern.

""BUSED"" seems more common.

Let's go with ""BUSED"".

Let's update our constraints based on the new feedback:

Letters known to be in the word:
- S (but not in positions 1, 3, or 5)
- E (and it is in position 4)

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
- L, A, T, R, I, N, U, D

So the pattern so far is:
_ _ _ E _

Possible positions for S:
- Positions 2 or 4 (but 4 is E), so only position 2 is left for S.

Therefore the word must look like: _ S _ E _

We still need two more letters for positions 1 and 3, none of which can be any of the forbidden letters (L, A, T, R, I, N, U, D).

Remaining common letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, V, W, Y

We need two letters from this set for positions 1 and 3. Let's think of common 5-letter words fitting the pattern _ S _ E _:

Possible candidates:
- ""MOSSE"" - but O is allowed, M is allowed, S is in 2, E in 4. But this has S twice, which is possible. However, let's check if M and O are allowed - yes, they are.
- ""HOSSE"" - H is allowed, O is allowed, but ""HOSSE"" isn't a common word.
- ""KOSSE"" - not a word.
- ""COSSE"" - not a word.
- ""FOSSE"" - yes, ""fosse"" is a word (a narrow channel).
- ""POSSE"" - yes, ""posse"" is a word.
- ""WOSSE"" - no.
- ""GOSSE"" - no.
- ""MOSSE"" - yes, ""mosse"" is a word (a type of grass).

Between ""POSSE"" and ""MOSSE"", ""POSSE"" is more common.

Let's verify:
- P, O, S, S, E
- P is allowed (not in forbidden list)
- O is allowed
- S is confirmed in word (position 2)
- E is confirmed in position 4
- No forbidden letters used.

Therefore, ""POSSE"" is a valid next guess.

Let's extract every constraint from the four guesses so far.

Letters that MUST be in the word:
- E (position 4 is locked)
- S (must appear somewhere, but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

Wait, that's impossible: S cannot be in any position.  
The feedback for POSSE shows S(-) in both positions 3 and 4, meaning S is in the word but NOT in those positions.  
But position 5 is the only remaining slot for S, and the feedback for S(-) in position 5 implies S is NOT in position 5 either.

This contradiction means our earlier assumption was wrong: S cannot be in the word at all, yet every guess has marked S as ""-"" (present but wrong place). The only resolution is that S must be in the word, and the only position left is position 5, but the feedback says S is NOT in position 5. This is a paradox.

Re-examining the feedback for POSSE:
- P(x) – P is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in position 2.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

But we already know from RISEN that E is in position 4 (✓). So E is in position 4, and from POSSE E(-) in position 5 is redundant (E is already confirmed in 4). The critical new info is:
- O is in position 2 (✓).
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4.
- E is in position 4 (already known).

So the word pattern now is:
_ O _ E _

S must fit in position 1 or 5. From earlier feedback:
- S cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (from SLATE S(-) in 1, RISEN S(-) in 3, BUSED S(-) in 3, POSSE S(-) in 3 and 4).  
Wait, let's list all S positions and their feedback:
- SLATE: S(-) in position 1 → S not in 1.
- RISEN: S(-) in position 3 → S not in 3.
- BUSED: S(-) in position 3 → S not in 3 (duplicate).
- POSSE: S(-) in positions 3 and 4 → S not in 3 or 4.

So S can only be in position 2 or 5. But position 2 is O (✓), so S must be in position 5.

Therefore the word must be: _ O _ E S

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
L, A, T, R, I, N, U, D, P.

Remaining allowed letters for positions 1 and 3: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y, plus O and E are already placed.

- ""HOUSE"" – H, O, U, S, E → U is forbidden.
- ""MOOSE"" – M, O, O, S, E → second O is allowed, but we need _ O _ E S, so MOOSE is M O O E S – fits! Check letters: M, O, O, E, S. All allowed.
- ""COVES"" – C, O, V, E, S – but E must be in position 4, so C O V E S – fits! Letters: C, O, V, E, S – all allowed.
- ""FOGES"" – not a common word.
- ""GOGES"" – not a word.
- ""HOMES"" – H, O, M, E, S – but E must be in position 4, so H O M E S – fits! Letters: H, O, M, E, S – all allowed.

Between ""COVES"", ""HOMES"", and ""MOOSE"", ""HOMES"" is the most common word and fits perfectly.

Let's verify:
- H: not forbidden
- O: in position 2 (✓)
- M: not forbidden
- E: in position 4 (✓)
- S: in position 5 (must be here based on constraints)

This satisfies every constraint.

From the latest feedback:

HOMES → H(x) O(✓) M(x) E(✓) S(✓)

This tells us:
- H is NOT in the word.
- O is in position 2 (✓).
- M is NOT in the word.
- E is in position 4 (✓).
- S is in position 5 (✓).

So the pattern is now fully determined:
_ O _ E S

Letters that must be used:
- O in position 2
- E in position 4
- S in position 5

Letters that cannot appear anywhere:
L, A, T, R, I, N, U, D, P, H, M

The only remaining positions are 1 and 3. We need two letters from the allowed set: B, C, F, G, K, V, W, Y.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit _ O _ E S:
- BOGES – but G is allowed, B is allowed. Check: B, O, G, E, S – all letters allowed.
- COVES – C, O, V, E, S – V is allowed.
- FOGES – not a common word.
- GOGES – not a word.
- WOGES – not a word.
- YOGES – Y is allowed, J is not needed here.

The most common word fitting this pattern is ""BOGES"" or ""COVES"". Between these, ""BOGES"" is valid and uses allowed letters.

Let's verify:
- B: not forbidden
- O: in position 2 (✓)
- G: not forbidden
- E: in position 4 (✓)
- S: in position 5 (✓)

This satisfies all constraints.
