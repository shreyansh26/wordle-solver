### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate or confirm many possibilities at once.

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters include: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use several of these.

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This should give good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- R: x → not in the word
- O: - → in the word but not in position 3
- S: - → in the word but not in position 4
- E: - → in the word but not in position 5

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A or R.
- Contains O, S, and E, but none of them are in the positions they occupied in AROSE (positions 3, 4, 5 respectively).

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses O, S, and E in different positions.
- Avoids A and R.
- Uses two new letters (since we only know three letters are present).

Common letters not yet used: T, N, L, I, C, D, U, M, P, B, etc.

Let’s try to place O, S, and E in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, excluding their previous positions:

- E cannot be in position 5.

A good candidate is ""STONE"":

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate or confirm many possibilities at once.

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters include: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use several of these.

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This should give good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: x → not in the word
- R: x → not in the word
- O: - → in the word but not in position 3
- S: - → in the word but not in position 4
- E: - → in the word but not in position 5

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A or R.
- Contains O, S, and E, but none of them are in the positions they occupied in AROSE (positions 3, 4, 5 respectively).

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses O, S, and E in different positions.
- Avoids A and R.
- Uses two new letters (since we only know three letters are present).

Common letters not yet used: T, N, L, I, C, D, U, M, P, B, etc.

Let’s try to place O, S, and E in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, excluding their previous positions:
- O cannot be in position 3.
- S cannot be in position 4.
- E cannot be in position 5.

A good candidate is ""STONE"":
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since it was in position 4 before).
- T is a new letter.
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since it was in position 3 before).
- N is a new letter.
- E is in position 5 (but E was in position 5 in AROSE and got ""-"", so this is invalid).

Next candidate: ""SONIC""
- S in position 1 (allowed).
- O in position 2 (allowed).
- N is new.
- I is new.
- C is new.
But we know E must be in the word, so this misses E.

Next candidate: ""OCEAN""
- O in position 1 (allowed).
- C is new.
- E in position 3 (allowed).
- A is invalid (from feedback).
- N is new.

Next candidate: ""PELOS""
- P is new.
- E in position 2 (allowed).
- L is new.
- O in position 3 is invalid (from feedback).
- S in position 5 (allowed, since it was in position 4 before).

Next candidate: ""SPOKE""
- S in position 1 (allowed).
- P is new.
- O in position 3 is invalid.
- K is new.
- E in position 5 is invalid.

Next candidate: ""POSED""
- P is new.
- O in position 2 (allowed).
- S in position 3 (allowed, since it was in position 4 before).
- E in position 4 (allowed, since it was in position 5 before).
- D is new.

This seems valid:
- Uses O, S, E in new positions.
- Adds P and D (new letters).
- No A or R.

Let me re-examine the constraints we have so far:
- Fixed letters: _ O _ E _
- Letters in word: S (not in position 3)
- Letters eliminated: A, R, P, D

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2 and E in position 4
- Contains S somewhere (positions 1, 3, or 5, but not 3)
- Uses only remaining letters (no A, R, P, D)

Possible structures:
1. S O _ E _

Looking for common words: B O X E S, C O W E S, F O G E S, M O W E S, T O W E S, etc.
TOWES is not a valid word, but TOWES is a surname but not common. MOWES is also not valid. COVES is a valid word (C, O, V, E, S). C is a new letter, V is a new letter.

Let's check COVES:
- C (new)
- O (✓ position 2)
- V (new)
- E (✓ position 4)
- S (position 5, allowed since S was only excluded from position 3)

This seems valid and introduces two new letters (C, V).

Alternative: S O _ E _
- S (position 1)
- O (position 2)
- _ (position 3, must be a new letter, not S)
- E (position 4)
- _ (position 5, must be a new letter, not S)

Possible words: S O N E S (but S is repeated at end, which is allowed), S O T E S, S O L E S (but this was rejected earlier), etc.

SONES is not a valid word, but S O T E S is a valid word (archaic for ""sow"").

- Has O in position 2 and E in position 4
- Contains S somewhere (positions 1, 3, or 5, but not 3)
- Uses only remaining letters (no A, R, P, D)

Possible structures:
1. S O _ E _
2. _ O _ E S
3. _ O S E _

Let's try structure 2 first (S in position 5):
- _ O _ E S
Looking for common words: B O X E S, C O W E S, F O G E S, M O W E S, T O W E S, etc.
TOWES is not a valid word, but TOWES is a surname but not common. MOWES is also not valid. COVES is a valid word (C, O, V, E, S). C is a new letter, V is a new letter.

Let's check COVES:
- C (new)
- O (✓ position 2)
- V (new)
- E (✓ position 4)
- S (position 5, allowed since S was only excluded from position 3)

This seems valid and introduces two new letters (C, V).

Alternative: S O _ E _
- S (position 1)
- O (position 2)
- _ (position 3, must be a new letter, not S)
- E (position 4)
- _ (position 5, must be a new letter, not S)

Possible words: S O N E S (but S is repeated at end, which is allowed), S O T E S, S O L E S (but this was rejected earlier), etc.

SONES is not a valid word, but S O T E S is a valid word (archaic for ""sow"").

Between COVES and SOTES (S O T E S), COVES seems more common and valid.

Let's go with COVES.

From Guess 4 (COVES) we now know:

- C and V are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in position 2 (✓).
- E is in position 4 (✓).
- S is in position 5 (✓).

So the secret word is of the form: _ O _ E S

Letters eliminated so far: A, R, P, D, C, V  
Letters confirmed present: O, E, S (in positions 2, 4, 5 respectively)

We still need to fill positions 1 and 3 with letters that have not been ruled out.  
Common remaining letters: B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, T, U, W, Y, etc.

Let’s list 5-letter words that fit the pattern _ O _ E S:

- B O I E S  (valid, but “BOIES” is plural of “boye” – uncommon)
- B O K E S  (not a standard word)
- F O G E S  (valid – past tense of “foge” in some contexts, but rare)

- L O N E S  (valid – plural of “lone”)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate or confirm many possibilities at once.

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters include: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use several of these.

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This should give good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: x → not in the word
- R: x → not in the word
- O: - → in the word but not in position 3
- S: - → in the word but not in position 4
- E: - → in the word but not in position 5

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A or R.
- Contains O, S, and E, but none of them are in the positions they occupied in AROSE (positions 3, 4, 5 respectively).

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses O, S, and E in different positions.
- Avoids A and R.
- Uses two new letters (since we only know three letters are present).

Common letters not yet used: T, N, L, I, C, D, U, M, P, B, etc.

Let’s try to place O, S, and E in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, excluding their previous positions:
- O cannot be in position 3.
- S cannot be in position 4.
- E cannot be in position 5.

A good candidate is ""STONE"":
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since it was in position 4 before).
- T is a new letter.
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since it was in position 3 before).
- N is a new letter.
- E is in position 5 (but E was in position 5 in AROSE and got ""-"", so this is invalid).

Next candidate: ""SONIC""
- S in position 1 (allowed).
- O in position 2 (allowed).
- N is new.
- I is new.
- C is new.
But we know E must be in the word, so this misses E.

Next candidate: ""OCEAN""
- O in position 1 (allowed).
- C is new.
- E in position 3 (allowed).
- A is invalid (from feedback).
- N is new.

Next candidate: ""PELOS""
- P is new.
- E in position 2 (allowed).
- L is new.
- O in position 3 is invalid (from feedback).
- S in position 5 (allowed, since it was in position 4 before).

Next candidate: ""SPOKE""
- S in position 1 (allowed).
- P is new.
- O in position 3 is invalid.
- K is new.
- E in position 5 is invalid.

Next candidate: ""POSED""
- P is new.
- O in position 2 (allowed).
- S in position 3 (allowed, since it was in position 4 before).
- E in position 4 (allowed, since it was in position 5 before).
- D is new.

This seems valid:
- Uses O, S, E in new positions.
- Adds P and D (new letters).
- No A or R.

Candidate words:

- O in position 2 (✓)
- L is new

I made a typo in my guess. I wrote ""SOL ES"" which is not 5 letters. I need to correct that.

Let me re-examine the constraints we have so far:
- Fixed letters: _ O _ E _
- Letters in word: S (not in position 3)
- Letters eliminated: A, R, P, D

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2 and E in position 4
- Contains S somewhere (positions 1, 3, or 5, but not 3)
- Uses only remaining letters (no A, R, P, D)

Possible structures:
1. S O _ E _
2. _ O _ E S
3. _ O S E _

Let's try structure 2 first (S in position 5):
- _ O _ E S
Looking for common words: B O X E S, C O W E S, F O G E S, M O W E S, T O W E S, etc.
TOWES is not a valid word, but TOWES is a surname but not common. MOWES is also not valid. COVES is a valid word (C, O, V, E, S). C is a new letter, V is a new letter.

Let's check COVES:
- C (new)
- O (✓ position 2)
- V (new)
- E (✓ position 4)
- S (position 5, allowed since S was only excluded from position 3)

This seems valid and introduces two new letters (C, V).

Alternative: S O _ E _
- S (position 1)
- O (position 2)
- _ (position 3, must be a new letter, not S)
- E (position 4)
- _ (position 5, must be a new letter, not S)

Possible words: S O N E S (but S is repeated at end, which is allowed), S O T E S, S O L E S (but this was rejected earlier), etc.

SONES is not a valid word, but S O T E S is a valid word (archaic for ""sow"").

Between COVES and SOTES (S O T E S), COVES seems more common and valid.

The feedback from Guess 5 (""HOL ES"") was rejected because it is not a valid 5-letter English word.  
The correct pattern we now know is: _ O _ E S  
We need a single valid 5-letter word that matches this pattern.

Common valid words fitting _ O _ E S:
- B O I E S (valid, though uncommon)
- F O G E S (valid, but rare)
- G O L E S (valid, but uncommon)
- L O N E S (valid, but rare)
