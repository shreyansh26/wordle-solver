### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)

   - Letters NOT in word: R, O

2. STEAK → S(-) T(-) E(-) A(-) K(x)
   - S is still in word (but not in position 1 or 4)
   - E is still in word (but not in position 2 or 5)
   - A is still in word (but not in position 3 or 1)
   - T is in word (but not in position 2)
   - K is NOT in word

So far we know the secret word contains: A, S, E, T  
and does NOT contain: R, O, K

Position constraints:
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 3 → possible positions: 2, 4, 5
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4 → possible positions: 2, 3, 5
- E cannot be in positions 2 or 5 → possible positions: 1, 3, 4
- T cannot be in position 2 → possible positions: 1, 3, 4, 5

We need a 5-letter word that uses A, S, E, T exactly once each (since we only have 4 distinct letters so far) plus one more letter that hasn’t been ruled out yet (must be from the remaining alphabet excluding R, O, K).

A good candidate is “STATE”:
- Letters used: S, T, A, T, E – but T is repeated, which may not be optimal for elimination.

Instead, let’s try “STEAD”:
- Letters: S, T, E, A, D
- D is a new letter not yet tested.
- Positions:
  - S in 1 → but S cannot be in 1 (from STEAK feedback) → invalid.

Next candidate: “EASTS” – but S is repeated and S cannot be in 5 (no restriction yet, but repetition isn’t ideal).

Better: “TEASE”
- Letters: T, E, A, S, E – E is repeated.

Let’s try “SEATS” – again S is repeated.

Another approach: since we have 4 letters (A, S, E, T) and need 5 positions, one of them must be repeated or we need a new letter. Since we have only 4 unique letters, one will repeat.

A valid word with no repeats except one letter is “STEAL” – but L hasn’t been tested and we already know A is in word. However, in STEAL:
- A is in position 4 (allowed)
- S in 1 (not allowed) → invalid.

Next: “PEAST” – P is new.
- P in 1, E in 2 (not allowed), so invalid.

Next: “TASSE” – S is in 4 (not allowed).

Next: “STEAM” – M is new, but A in 3 (not allowed).

Next: “TEASE” – E is in 2 (not allowed).

Next: “EASTS” – S in 5 (allowed), E in 1 (allowed), A in 2 (allowed), T in 4 (allowed), S in 5 (allowed). This seems valid.

Check positions:
- E in 1: allowed (E cannot be in 2 or 5)
- A in 2: allowed (A cannot be in 1 or 3)
- S in 3: allowed (S cannot be in 1 or 4)
- T in 4: allowed (T cannot be in 2)

A valid word with no repeats except one letter is “STEAL” – but L hasn’t been tested and we already know A is in word. However, in STEAL:
- A is in position 4 (allowed)
- S in 1 (not allowed) → invalid.

Next: “PEAST” – P is new.
- P in 1, E in 2 (not allowed), so invalid.

Next: “TASSE” – S is in 4 (not allowed).

Next: “STEAM” – M is new, but A in 3 (not allowed).

Next: “TEASE” – E is in 2 (not allowed).

Next: “EASTS” – S in 5 (allowed), E in 1 (allowed), A in 2 (allowed), T in 4 (allowed), S in 5 (allowed). This seems valid.

Check positions:
- E in 1: allowed (E cannot be in 2 or 5)
- A in 2: allowed (A cannot be in 1 or 3)
- S in 3: allowed (S cannot be in 1 or 4)
- T in 4: allowed (T cannot be in 2)
- S in 5: allowed (S cannot be in 1 or 4)

This fits all constraints.

From the new feedback on EASTS:
- E is in word but not in position 1
- A is in word but not in position 2
- S is in word but not in position 3
- T is in position 4 (✓)
- S is in position 5 (✓)

So we now know:
- Letters in word: A, S, E, T
- Letters NOT in word: R, O, K
- Positions:
  - T is fixed in position 4
  - S is fixed in position 5
  - E is in word but not in positions 1,2,5 → must be in 3
  - A is in word but not in positions 1,2,3 → must be in 5, but 5 is already S → contradiction

Wait, this indicates an inconsistency. Let me re-examine:

From EASTS feedback:
- E(-) means E is in word but not in position 1
- A(-) means A is in word but not in position 2
- S(-) means S is in word but not in position 3
- T(✓) means T is in position 4
- S(✓) means S is in position 5

So:
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: S
- E must be in position 3 (since it can't be 1 or 5, and 2 is not yet ruled out for E, but from STEAK E was in position 2 but marked (-), so E can't be in 2 either. Thus E must be in 3)
- A must be in position 1 (since it can't be 1,2,3 from previous feedback, but position 5 is S. Wait, this seems conflicting.)

Let me re-summarize constraints:

Known letters: A, S, E, T
Known positions:
- T is in position 4 (✓)
- S is in position 5 (✓)
Thus word structure: _ _ _ T S

E must be in word but not in positions 1,2,5 (from feedback)
- From AROSE: E(-) means E not in 5 (already)
- From STEAK: E(-) means E not in 2
- From EASTS: E(-) means E not in 1
Thus E must be in position 3

A must be in word but not in positions 1,2,3 (from feedback)
- From AROSE: A(-) means A not in 1
- From STEAK: A(-) means A not in 3
- From EASTS: A(-) means A not in 2
Thus A must be in position 4 or 5, but 4 is T and 5 is S → impossible

This contradiction implies an error in interpretation. Re-examining feedback:

From EASTS:
- E(-) means E is in word but not in position 1
- A(-) means A is in word but not in position 2
- S(-) means S is in word but not in position 3
- T(✓) means T is in position 4
- S(✓) means S is in position 5

Thus:
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: S
- E must be in position 2 or 3
- A must be in position 1 or 3

But from previous feedback:
- From AROSE: A(-) means A not in 1
- From STEAK: A(-) means A not in 3
Thus A cannot be in 1 or 3, but must be in 1-5, and positions 4,5 are taken → impossible

This suggests the only possible word structure is _ A _ T S, but A cannot be in 2 (from EASTS A(-)), so this is invalid.

Rechecking constraints:
- E must be in 2 or 3
- A must be in 1 or 3, but cannot be in 1 or 3 → impossible

This indicates the secret word must contain an additional letter not yet ruled out, as we've only identified 4 distinct letters. However, we have 5 positions and 4 letters, so one letter must repeat. The only letters we know are A, S, E, T. The fifth letter must be one of the remaining letters not yet tested (not R, O, K).

Possible fifth letter: D, L, N, P, U, etc.

Looking for 5-letter words ending in TS with E and A in positions 2 or 3:
- E A _ T S → ""EAITS"" (invalid)
- _ E A T S → ""BEATS"" (B not tested)
- _ A E T S → ""HAETS"" (invalid)
- A E _ T S → ""AE...S"" (invalid)

Next candidate: ""BEATS""

  - E in 2 (allowed - not ruled out)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in position 1
- R is not in the word at all
- O is not in the word at all
- S is in the word but not in position 4
- E is in the word but not in position 5

So we know:
- Letters not in the word: R, O
- Letters in the word (somewhere): A, S, E
- A cannot be in position 1
- S cannot be in position 4
- E cannot be in position 5

We need a new 5-letter word that uses A, S, E (and possibly other letters not yet ruled out) while respecting the positional constraints.

A good next guess is ""STEAK"":
- It contains S, E, A
- S is in position 1 (allowed since S cannot only be in position 4)
- E is in position 2 (allowed since E cannot only be in position 5)
- A is in position 3 (allowed since A cannot only be in position 1)
- T and K are new letters that might help narrow things down

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - Letters in word (but wrong positions): A, S, E
   - Letters NOT in word: R, O

2. STEAK → S(-) T(-) E(-) A(-) K(x)
   - S is still in word (but not in position 1 or 4)
   - E is still in word (but not in position 2 or 5)
   - A is still in word (but not in position 3 or 1)
   - T is in word (but not in position 2)
   - K is NOT in word

So far we know the secret word contains: A, S, E, T  
and does NOT contain: R, O, K

Position constraints:
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 3 → possible positions: 2, 4, 5
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4 → possible positions: 2, 3, 5
- E cannot be in positions 2 or 5 → possible positions: 1, 3, 4
- T cannot be in position 2 → possible positions: 1, 3, 4, 5

We need a 5-letter word that uses A, S, E, T exactly once each (since we only have 4 distinct letters so far) plus one more letter that hasn’t been ruled out yet (must be from the remaining alphabet excluding R, O, K).

A good candidate is “STATE”:
- Letters used: S, T, A, T, E – but T is repeated, which may not be optimal for elimination.

Instead, let’s try “STEAD”:
- Letters: S, T, E, A, D
- D is a new letter not yet tested.
- Positions:
  - S in 1 → but S cannot be in 1 (from STEAK feedback) → invalid.

Next candidate: “EASTS” – but S is repeated and S cannot be in 5 (no restriction yet, but repetition isn’t ideal).

Better: “TEASE”
- Letters: T, E, A, S, E – E is repeated.

Let’s try “SEATS” – again S is repeated.

Another approach: since we have 4 letters (A, S, E, T) and need 5 positions, one of them must be repeated or we need a new letter. Since we have only 4 unique letters, one will repeat.

A valid word with no repeats except one letter is “STEAL” – but L hasn’t been tested and we already know A is in word. However, in STEAL:
- A is in position 4 (allowed)
- S in 1 (not allowed) → invalid.

Next: “PEAST” – P is new.
- P in 1, E in 2 (not allowed), so invalid.

Next: “TASSE” – S is in 4 (not allowed).

Next: “STEAM” – M is new, but A in 3 (not allowed).

Next: “TEASE” – E is in 2 (not allowed).

Next: “EASTS” – S in 5 (allowed), E in 1 (allowed), A in 2 (allowed), T in 4 (allowed), S in 5 (allowed). This seems valid.

Check positions:
- E in 1: allowed (E cannot be in 2 or 5)
- A in 2: allowed (A cannot be in 1 or 3)
- S in 3: allowed (S cannot be in 1 or 4)
- T in 4: allowed (T cannot be in 2)
- S in 5: allowed (S cannot be in 1 or 4)

- A(-) means A is in word but not in position 2
- S(-) means S is in word but not in position 3
- T(✓) means T is in position 4

So:
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: S
- E must be in position 3 (since it can't be 1 or 5, and 2 is not yet ruled out for E, but from STEAK E was in position 2 but marked (-), so E can't be in 2 either. Thus E must be in 3)
- A must be in position 1 (since it can't be 1,2,3 from previous feedback, but position 5 is S. Wait, this seems conflicting.)

Let me re-summarize constraints:

Known letters: A, S, E, T
Known positions:
- T is in position 4 (✓)
- S is in position 5 (✓)
Thus word structure: _ _ _ T S

E must be in word but not in positions 1,2,5 (from feedback)
- From AROSE: E(-) means E not in 5 (already)
- From STEAK: E(-) means E not in 2
- From EASTS: E(-) means E not in 1
Thus E must be in position 3

A must be in word but not in positions 1,2,3 (from feedback)
- From AROSE: A(-) means A not in 1
- From STEAK: A(-) means A not in 3
- From EASTS: A(-) means A not in 2

- A(-) means A is in word but not in position 2
- S(-) means S is in word but not in position 3

Thus:
- Position 4: T

- E must be in position 2 or 3
- A must be in position 1 or 3

But from previous feedback:
- From AROSE: A(-) means A not in 1
- From STEAK: A(-) means A not in 3
Thus A cannot be in 1 or 3, but must be in 1-5, and positions 4,5 are taken → impossible

This suggests the only possible word structure is _ A _ T S, but A cannot be in 2 (from EASTS A(-)), so this is invalid.

Rechecking constraints:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in position 1
- R is not in the word at all
- O is not in the word at all
- S is in the word but not in position 4
- E is in the word but not in position 5

So we know:
- Letters not in the word: R, O
- Letters in the word (somewhere): A, S, E
- A cannot be in position 1
- S cannot be in position 4
- E cannot be in position 5

We need a new 5-letter word that uses A, S, E (and possibly other letters not yet ruled out) while respecting the positional constraints.

A good next guess is ""STEAK"":
- It contains S, E, A
- S is in position 1 (allowed since S cannot only be in position 4)
- E is in position 2 (allowed since E cannot only be in position 5)
- A is in position 3 (allowed since A cannot only be in position 1)
- T and K are new letters that might help narrow things down

Guess 2: STEAK -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) E(-) A(-) K(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - Letters in word (but wrong positions): A, S, E
   - Letters NOT in word: R, O

2. STEAK → S(-) T(-) E(-) A(-) K(x)
   - S is still in word (but not in position 1 or 4)
   - E is still in word (but not in position 2 or 5)
   - A is still in word (but not in position 3 or 1)
   - T is in word (but not in position 2)
   - K is NOT in word

So far we know the secret word contains: A, S, E, T  
and does NOT contain: R, O, K

Position constraints:
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 3 → possible positions: 2, 4, 5
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4 → possible positions: 2, 3, 5
- E cannot be in positions 2 or 5 → possible positions: 1, 3, 4
- T cannot be in position 2 → possible positions: 1, 3, 4, 5

We need a 5-letter word that uses A, S, E, T exactly once each (since we only have 4 distinct letters so far) plus one more letter that hasn’t been ruled out yet (must be from the remaining alphabet excluding R, O, K).

A good candidate is “STATE”:
- Letters used: S, T, A, T, E – but T is repeated, which may not be optimal for elimination.

Instead, let’s try “STEAD”:
- Letters: S, T, E, A, D
- D is a new letter not yet tested.
- Positions:
  - S in 1 → but S cannot be in 1 (from STEAK feedback) → invalid.

Next candidate: “EASTS” – but S is repeated and S cannot be in 5 (no restriction yet, but repetition isn’t ideal).

Better: “TEASE”
- Letters: T, E, A, S, E – E is repeated.

Let’s try “SEATS” – again S is repeated.

Another approach: since we have 4 letters (A, S, E, T) and need 5 positions, one of them must be repeated or we need a new letter. Since we have only 4 unique letters, one will repeat.

A valid word with no repeats except one letter is “STEAL” – but L hasn’t been tested and we already know A is in word. However, in STEAL:
- A is in position 4 (allowed)
- S in 1 (not allowed) → invalid.

Next: “PEAST” – P is new.
- P in 1, E in 2 (not allowed), so invalid.

Next: “TASSE” – S is in 4 (not allowed).

Next: “STEAM” – M is new, but A in 3 (not allowed).

Next: “TEASE” – E is in 2 (not allowed).

Next: “EASTS” – S in 5 (allowed), E in 1 (allowed), A in 2 (allowed), T in 4 (allowed), S in 5 (allowed). This seems valid.

Check positions:
- E in 1: allowed (E cannot be in 2 or 5)
- A in 2: allowed (A cannot be in 1 or 3)
- S in 3: allowed (S cannot be in 1 or 4)
- T in 4: allowed (T cannot be in 2)
- S in 5: allowed (S cannot be in 1 or 4)

From the new feedback on EASTS:
- E is in word but not in position 1
- A is in word but not in position 2
- S is in word but not in position 3
- T is in position 4 (✓)
- S is in position 5 (✓)

So we now know:
- Letters in word: A, S, E, T
- Letters NOT in word: R, O, K
- Positions:
  - T is fixed in position 4
  - S is fixed in position 5
  - E is in word but not in positions 1,2,5 → must be in 3
  - A is in word but not in positions 1,2,3 → must be in 5, but 5 is already S → contradiction

Wait, this indicates an inconsistency. Let me re-examine:

From EASTS feedback:
- E(-) means E is in word but not in position 1
- A(-) means A is in word but not in position 2
- S(-) means S is in word but not in position 3
- T(✓) means T is in position 4
- S(✓) means S is in position 5

So:
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: S
- E must be in position 3 (since it can't be 1 or 5, and 2 is not yet ruled out for E, but from STEAK E was in position 2 but marked (-), so E can't be in 2 either. Thus E must be in 3)
- A must be in position 1 (since it can't be 1,2,3 from previous feedback, but position 5 is S. Wait, this seems conflicting.)

Let me re-summarize constraints:

Known letters: A, S, E, T
Known positions:
- T is in position 4 (✓)
- S is in position 5 (✓)
Thus word structure: _ _ _ T S

E must be in word but not in positions 1,2,5 (from feedback)
- From AROSE: E(-) means E not in 5 (already)
- From STEAK: E(-) means E not in 2
- From EASTS: E(-) means E not in 1
Thus E must be in position 3

A must be in word but not in positions 1,2,3 (from feedback)
- From AROSE: A(-) means A not in 1
- From STEAK: A(-) means A not in 3
- From EASTS: A(-) means A not in 2
Thus A must be in position 4 or 5, but 4 is T and 5 is S → impossible

This contradiction implies an error in interpretation. Re-examining feedback:

From EASTS:
- E(-) means E is in word but not in position 1
- A(-) means A is in word but not in position 2
- S(-) means S is in word but not in position 3
- T(✓) means T is in position 4
- S(✓) means S is in position 5

Thus:
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: S
- E must be in position 2 or 3
- A must be in position 1 or 3

But from previous feedback:
- From AROSE: A(-) means A not in 1
- From STEAK: A(-) means A not in 3
Thus A cannot be in 1 or 3, but must be in 1-5, and positions 4,5 are taken → impossible

This suggests the only possible word structure is _ A _ T S, but A cannot be in 2 (from EASTS A(-)), so this is invalid.

Rechecking constraints:
- E must be in 2 or 3
- A must be in 1 or 3, but cannot be in 1 or 3 → impossible

This indicates the secret word must contain an additional letter not yet ruled out, as we've only identified 4 distinct letters. However, we have 5 positions and 4 letters, so one letter must repeat. The only letters we know are A, S, E, T. The fifth letter must be one of the remaining letters not yet tested (not R, O, K).

Possible fifth letter: D, L, N, P, U, etc.

Looking for 5-letter words ending in TS with E and A in positions 2 or 3:

- Position 2: E
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: S

We know the letters in the word are E, A, T, S (and one more letter in position 1). From previous feedback, letters not in the word are R, O, K, B. The remaining possible letters for position 1 are consonants not yet used (e.g., C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.).

Looking for 5-letter words matching the pattern _ E A T S:
- C: ""CEATS"" (invalid)
- D: ""DEATS"" (invalid)
- F: ""FEATS"" (valid word)
- G: ""GEATS"" (invalid)
- H: ""HEATS"" (valid word)
- L: ""LEATS"" (invalid)
- M: ""MEATS"" (valid word)
- N: ""NEATS"" (valid word)
- P: ""PEATS"" (valid word)
- U: ""UEATS"" (invalid)
- V: ""VEATS"" (invalid)
- W: ""WEATS"" (invalid)
- Y: ""YEATS"" (invalid)

Among these, ""FEATS"", ""HEATS"", ""MEATS"", ""NEATS"", ""PEATS"" are all valid. Since we have only one letter left to determine (position 1), any of these would be correct. However, we need to choose one to guess. 

""FEATS"" is a common word, so I'll go with that.
