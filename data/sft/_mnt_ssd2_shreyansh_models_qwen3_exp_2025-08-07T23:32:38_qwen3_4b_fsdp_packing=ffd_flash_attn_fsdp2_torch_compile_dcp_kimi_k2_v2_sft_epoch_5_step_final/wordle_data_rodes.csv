### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters in English. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these common letters as possible while avoiding duplicates. 

One of the best starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: most common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common letter in English

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to test against the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(-) : S is in the word but in the wrong position (not first)
- L(x) : L is not in the word at all
- A(x) : A is not in the word at all
- T(x) : T is not in the word at all
- E(-) : E is in the word but in the wrong position (not fifth)

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: L, A, T
- Letters that must appear somewhere: S, E
- S cannot be in position 1
- E cannot be in position 5

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S and E
2. Does not contain L, A, T
3. Has S not in position 1
4. Has E not in position 5

Good remaining consonants to try: R, N, C, H, D, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A is out)

Let's try ""SHINE"":
- S is in position 1 (but feedback said S is in wrong position, so this is bad)
  
Try ""CRISP"":
- Doesn't contain E, so no.

Try ""RISEN"":
- Contains S and E
- S is in position 4 (allowed)
- E is in position 5 (but feedback says E is not in position 5) - so this is bad.

Try ""SENOR"":
- S in position 1 (bad)

Try ""CHISE"":
- S in position 4 (ok), E in position 5 (bad)

Try ""HUMPS"":
- Doesn't have E

Try ""PRESS"":
- S in position 5 (ok), E in position 3 (ok), but has S twice - not ideal

Try ""SPERM"":
- S in position 1 (bad)

Try ""SENOR"" - same issue.

Let's try ""ROSES"":
- S in position 4 (ok), E in position 3 (ok), no L/A/T - this seems good.

But we might want to test more new letters. Another option is ""SHINE"" but S is first. 

Wait, let's try ""RISEN"" but move E to position 2:
""RISEN"" - E is 5th, so no.

""CRISP"" - no E.

""DRIPS"" - no E.

""SNORE"":
- S in position 1 (bad)

""SNORE"" - same.

""ROSES"" seems best so far:
- R, O, S, E, S
- Contains S and E
- S not in position 1
- E in position 4 (ok)
- No L, A, T
- Tests new letters R, O

But double S is less ideal. Let's try ""ROSES"" anyway since it's a valid word.

Alternatively, ""ROSES"" is fine for testing.

Another option: ""CHIDE"":
- C, H, I, D, E
- No S - bad.

""CHIME"":

""SPICE"":

""CRISP"" - no E.

""CHIME"" - no S.

""SHINE"" - S in position 1 (bad).

""RISEN"" - E in position 5 (bad).

""ROSES"" seems to be the best available option that includes S and E without L/A/T and respects the position constraints.

But let's try ""CHISE"":
- C, H, I, S, E
- S in position 4 (ok)

""CHISE"" - E in 5 is bad.

""SHINE"" - S in 1 is bad.

- S is in positions 3 and 5 - position 3 is ok (not 1)
- E is in position 4 - ok (not 5)

This seems acceptable.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters in English. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these common letters as possible while avoiding duplicates. 

One of the best starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: most common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common letter in English

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to test against the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(-) : S is in the word but in the wrong position (not first)
- L(x) : L is not in the word at all
- A(x) : A is not in the word at all
- T(x) : T is not in the word at all
- E(-) : E is in the word but in the wrong position (not fifth)

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: L, A, T
- Letters that must appear somewhere: S, E
- S cannot be in position 1
- E cannot be in position 5

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S and E
2. Does not contain L, A, T
3. Has S not in position 1
4. Has E not in position 5

Good remaining consonants to try: R, N, C, H, D, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A is out)

Let's try ""SHINE"":
- S is in position 1 (but feedback said S is in wrong position, so this is bad)
  
Try ""CRISP"":
- Doesn't contain E, so no.

Try ""RISEN"":
- Contains S and E
- S is in position 4 (allowed)
- E is in position 5 (but feedback says E is not in position 5) - so this is bad.

Try ""SENOR"":
- S in position 1 (bad)

Try ""CHISE"":
- S in position 4 (ok), E in position 5 (bad)

Try ""HUMPS"":
- Doesn't have E

Try ""PRESS"":
- S in position 5 (ok), E in position 3 (ok), but has S twice - not ideal

Try ""SPERM"":
- S in position 1 (bad)

Try ""SENOR"" - same issue.

Let's try ""ROSES"":
- S in position 4 (ok), E in position 3 (ok), no L/A/T - this seems good.

But we might want to test more new letters. Another option is ""SHINE"" but S is first. 

Wait, let's try ""RISEN"" but move E to position 2:
""RISEN"" - E is 5th, so no.

""CRISP"" - no E.

""DRIPS"" - no E.

""SNORE"":
- S in position 1 (bad)

""SNORE"" - same.

""ROSES"" seems best so far:
- R, O, S, E, S
- Contains S and E
- S not in position 1
- E in position 4 (ok)
- No L, A, T
- Tests new letters R, O

But double S is less ideal. Let's try ""ROSES"" anyway since it's a valid word.

Alternatively, ""ROSES"" is fine for testing.

Another option: ""CHIDE"":
- C, H, I, D, E
- No S - bad.

""CHIME"":
- No S - bad.

""SPICE"":
- S in position 1 (bad)

""SPICE"" - bad.

""CRISP"" - no E.

""PRISM"":
- No E.

""PRIZE"":
- Z is uncommon, but let's see:
  - P, R, I, Z, E
  - S is missing - bad.

""BRINE"":
- B, R, I, N, E
- No S - bad.

""CRANE"":
- No S - bad.

""DRONE"":
- No S - bad.

""FROND"":
- No S - bad.

""GRIME"":
- No S - bad.

""PRIME"":
- No S - bad.

""TRICE"":
- T is out - bad.

""WRIST"":
- T is out - bad.

""WRISE"":
- W, R, I, S, E
- S in position 4 (ok)
- E in position 5 (bad)

""WRIST"" - T is out.

""CRISP"" - no E.

""CHIME"" - no S.

""SHINE"" - S in position 1 (bad).

""RISEN"" - E in position 5 (bad).

""ROSES"" seems to be the best available option that includes S and E without L/A/T and respects the position constraints.

But let's try ""CHISE"":
- C, H, I, S, E
- S in position 4 (ok)
- E in position 5 (bad)

""CHISE"" - E in 5 is bad.

""SHINE"" - S in 1 is bad.

""SNORE"" - S in 1 is bad.

""SNORE"" - same.

""ROSES"" seems to be the only valid option that includes both S and E without L/A/T and with S not in position 1 and E not in position 5.

Wait, let's try ""ROSES"":
- R(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), S(5)
- S is in positions 3 and 5 - position 3 is ok (not 1)
- E is in position 4 - ok (not 5)
- No L, A, T
- Tests R, O, S, E

This seems acceptable.

Another option: ""ROSES"" or ""CHISE"" (but E in 5 is bad).

""CHISE"" - E in 5 is bad.

""ROSES"" seems the best.

But let's try ""ROSES"" as it's a valid word and fits all constraints.

Final choice: ""ROSES""

Scanning common words that fit R O _ E S:\n   - ROBES\n   - ROUES (rare)\n   - RODES (but D is allowed)\n   - ROLES (but L is forbidden)\n   - ROSES (already guessed)\n   - ROVES\n   - ROPES\n   - ROKES\n   - RONES\n\n   The most common and valid English word among these is ROBES.\n\n<guess>ROBES</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: ROSES -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) S(✓)\nGuess 3: ROBES -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) O(✓) B(x) E(✓) S(✓)\n'}]","<think>
From the feedback so far:

- Positions locked: R(1) O(2) _ (3) E(4) S(5) → R O _ E S
- Letters known NOT in the word: L, A, T, B
- Therefore, the only remaining unknown is the third letter, and it must be a letter not in {L, A, T, B}.

Common consonants/vowels still allowed: C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for a 5-letter word that fits R O _ E S:
- RODES – but D is allowed, and RODES is a valid word (plural of road).  
- ROUES – uncommon, but valid (plural of rove).  
- ROVES – valid (past tense of rove).  
- ROPES – valid.  
- ROKES – valid (plural of rok, a type of fish).  
- RONES – valid (plural of ron, a unit of length in some contexts).

The most common and likely answer is RODES, as it’s the everyday word.
