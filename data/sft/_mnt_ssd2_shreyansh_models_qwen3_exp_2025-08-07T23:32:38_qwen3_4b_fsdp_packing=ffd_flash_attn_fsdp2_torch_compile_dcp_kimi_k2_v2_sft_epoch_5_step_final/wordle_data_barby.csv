For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent in English 5-letter words

This gives us good coverage to gather initial information about which letters might be in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (position 1).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (position 2).
- O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains A and R, but neither is in its original spot (A not in position 1, R not in position 2).
- The letters O, S, E are excluded.

Next, I want a new guess that:
1. Keeps A and R (since they’re confirmed present).
2. Moves A and R to different positions than before.
3. Introduces new common letters that haven’t been tested yet.

A good candidate is “TRAIN”:
- T, I, N are new letters not tested before.
- A is moved to position 3 (was 1).
- R is moved to position 2 (was 2) – wait, that’s the same position as before, which is bad. Let me rethink.

Better option: “RATIO”
- R is in position 1 (was 2) – allowed since it’s a new position.
- A is in position 2 (was 1) – allowed.
- T, I, O are new letters, but O is excluded. So RATIO is invalid.

Next: “CRANE”
- C, N, E are new, but E is excluded. Invalid.

Next: “GRAIN”
- G, I, N are new.
- A is in position 2 (was 1) – allowed.
- R is in position 1 (was 2) – allowed.

- A is in position 2 and is correct there (✓).
- R is in position 3 and is correct there (✓).
- The second A is in position 4 but is not in the word (-).

So now we know:
- Word pattern: _ A R _ _
- Letters confirmed present: A (position 2), R (position 3)
- Letters confirmed absent: O, S, E, G, I, N, C, T
- Remaining possible letters (from the alphabet excluding the absent ones): B, D, F, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A in position 2 and R in position 3.
2. Uses only allowed letters.
3. The other two positions (1 and 5) must be filled with letters not yet ruled out.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent in English 5-letter words

This gives us good coverage to gather initial information about which letters might be in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (position 1).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (position 2).
- O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains A and R, but neither is in its original spot (A not in position 1, R not in position 2).
- The letters O, S, E are excluded.

Next, I want a new guess that:
1. Keeps A and R (since they’re confirmed present).
2. Moves A and R to different positions than before.
3. Introduces new common letters that haven’t been tested yet.

A good candidate is “TRAIN”:
- T, I, N are new letters not tested before.
- A is moved to position 3 (was 1).
- R is moved to position 2 (was 2) – wait, that’s the same position as before, which is bad. Let me rethink.

Better option: “RATIO”
- R is in position 1 (was 2) – allowed since it’s a new position.
- A is in position 2 (was 1) – allowed.
- T, I, O are new letters, but O is excluded. So RATIO is invalid.

Next: “CRANE”
- C, N, E are new, but E is excluded. Invalid.

Next: “GRAIN”
- G, I, N are new.
- A is in position 2 (was 1) – allowed.
- R is in position 1 (was 2) – allowed.

This looks good. Let me verify:
- Letters: G, R, A, I, N – none of O, S, E.
- A and R are in new positions.

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word, but not in position 1.
   - R is in the word, but not in position 2.
   - O, S, E are not in the word.

2. GRAIN → G(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   - G, I, N are not in the word.
   - R is in the word, but not in position 1.
   - A is in the word, but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely present: A, R
- Letters definitely absent: O, S, E, G, I, N
- Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5 (since it can’t be 1 or 3)
- Possible positions for R: 3, 4, 5 (since it can’t be 1 or 2)

We need a word that:
- Uses A and R in new positions.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (i.e., from the remaining alphabet excluding O, S, E, G, I, N).
- Common remaining letters: T, L, D, C, B, M, F, H, K, U, Y, etc.

A good candidate is “CARAT”:
- C, T are new letters.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- R is in position 3 (allowed).
- All letters are allowed so far.

Let’s check:
- C: new, allowed
- A: allowed position 2
- R: allowed position 3
- A: allowed position 4
- T: new, allowed

No conflicts with previous feedback.

From Guess 4 HARDY we now know:

H(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(x) Y(✓)

- H and D are NOT in the word.
- A is in position 2 and is correct there (✓).
- R is in position 3 and is correct there (✓).
- Y is in position 5 and is correct there (✓).

So the word pattern is: _ A R _ Y

Letters we know are NOT in the word so far:
O, S, E, G, I, N, C, T, H, D

Remaining possible letters (from the alphabet excluding the above):
B, F, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A in position 2 and R in position 3.
2. Has Y in position 5.
3. Uses only allowed letters in positions 1 and 4.

Possible pattern: ? A R ? Y

Let’s think of common words fitting this pattern:
- B A R B Y – but B is repeated and BARBY is a valid name, but let’s check letters: B is allowed.
- B A R K Y – B, K are allowed, but is BARKY a word? It’s not common.
- F A R M Y – F, M are allowed, but FARMY is not a word.
- L A R K Y – L, K are allowed, but LARKY is not a word.
- M A R K Y – M, K are allowed, but MARKY is not a word.
- P A R K Y – P, K are allowed, but PARKY is not a word.
- V A R K Y – V, K are allowed, but VARKY is not a word.
- W A R P Y – W, P are allowed, but WARPY is not a word.
- B A R R Y – B is allowed, but BARRY is a valid name.

The most plausible common word seems to be BARRY (though it’s a name), but let’s check if there are any other common words. Another possibility is BAGGY, but G is excluded. 

Looking again, the only common word that fits is BARRY.

But wait, let’s double-check:
- B: allowed
- A: position 2 correct
- R: position 3 correct
- R: position 4 (but we have Y in position 5), so BARRY has R in position 4, which would conflict with our pattern _ A R _ Y. Actually, BARRY would be B A R R Y, which has R in position 3 and 4, but we need _ A R _ Y. So position 4 must be a single letter, not R. 

So we need: ? A R ? Y where the first and fourth letters are different.

Looking again:
- B A R B Y – fits _ A R _ Y: B A R B Y
  - B is allowed
  - A in 2, R in 3, Y in 5
  - Fourth letter B is allowed

BARBY is a valid word (short for Barbara).

Other possibilities:
- F A R F Y – FARFY is not a word.
- L A R L Y – LARLY is not a word.
- M A R M Y – MARMY is not a word.
- P A R P Y – PARPY is not a word.
- V A R V Y – VARVY is not a word.

Thus, BARBY seems to be the best candidate.
