### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters in the English language. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these common letters as possible without repeating any letters. 

Some popular starting words include:
- AROSE
- STARE
- CRANE
- SLATE
- CRISP
- ADIEU

Looking at these options, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains 5 unique letters (A, R, O, S, E) that are all very common. This gives us the best chance to identify multiple correct letters and their positions early in the game.

The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C.

From the three guesses we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word:  
A, R, O, S, I, L, T, B, C  

Letters that ARE in the word and in the correct positions:  
E in position 2, N in position 3  

Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions:  
H (from BENCH feedback: H(-))

So the word looks like: _ E N _ _  
and must also contain H somewhere in positions 1, 4, or 5.

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):  
D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus H.

We need a 5-letter word of the form ? E N ? ? that contains H and uses only the allowed letters.

Possible candidates:  
- HENGY  
- HENGI  
- HENNA (but A is out)  
- HENCE (but C is out)  
- HENJO  
- HENKY  
- HENRU  
- HENNA (invalid)  
- HENKY (valid)  
- HENGI (invalid, I is out)  
- HENJO (invalid, J is out but allowed)  
- HENRU (invalid, R is out)  

The only valid ones seem to be HENKY, HENJO, HENGY, HENRU (but R is out), HENNA (A out).  

From these, HENKY is a valid English word (a variant spelling of “hanky” or slang for “hanky-panky”).  
HENJO is not a standard English word.  
HENGY is not a standard English word.  
HENRU is not a standard English word.  

Thus, the best valid candidate is HENKY.

However, to ensure we pick a recognized word, let’s double-check:  
HENKY is recognized in some dictionaries as a slang term.  
HENCH is a valid word (meaning a follower or henchman), but C is out.  
HENCE is invalid (C out).  

Another possibility: HENUP (not a word), HENGO (not a word), HENNY (valid, Y is allowed).  

HENNY is a valid word (short for Henry or a name).  

Between HENKY and HENNY, HENNY is more standard.  

But let’s verify HENNY:  
H E N N Y  
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
- E is in position 2 (correct)  
- N is in position 3 (correct)  
- H is in position 1 (new position)  
- Y is new  
- Second N is new  

This fits all constraints.  

Therefore, HENNY is a valid next guess.
