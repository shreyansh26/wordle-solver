### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

One of the best starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us a good spread of vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English words, which should help us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in the 3rd position.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Includes A somewhere other than position 3.
- Excludes S, L, T, E.

Good remaining consonants to test: R, N, C, D, P, M, B, F, G, H, K, etc.
Good vowels to test: I, O, U (since A is already confirmed).

A strong second guess should introduce new common letters while placing A in a different spot. Let’s try “RADIO”:
- R (common consonant)
- A (known to be in word, now in position 2)
- D (common consonant)
- I (common vowel)
- O (common vowel)

This tests A in position 2 and brings in R, D, I, O.

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. \n\nOne of the best starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:\n- S (very common)\n- L (common)\n- A (most common vowel)\n- T (common)\n- E (most common letter overall)\n\nThis gives us a good spread of vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English words, which should help us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.\n\n<guess>SLATE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on SLATE:\n- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x).\n- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).\n\nSo the secret word:\n- Contains the letter A, but not in the 3rd position.\n- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E.\n\nWe need a 5-letter word that:\n- Includes A somewhere other than position 3.\n- Excludes S, L, T, E.\n\nGood remaining consonants to test: R, N, C, D, P, M, B, F, G, H, K, etc.\nGood vowels to test: I, O, U (since A is already confirmed).\n\nA strong second guess should introduce new common letters while placing A in a different spot.

From the three rounds of feedback we now have:

1. Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, R, D, O, C, B.
2. Letters that ARE in the word:
   - A (position 2 is fixed: A✓)
   - I (somewhere, but not in positions 3 or 4)
   - N (somewhere, but not in position 5)

So the pattern so far is:
_ A _ _ _

And we know:
- I must be in position 1 or 5 (since it can't be in 3 or 4).
- N must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (since it can't be in 5).

We also need to test new consonants: good candidates are F, G, H, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Let’s try placing I in position 1 and N in position 3: “I A N _ _”.

We need two more consonants, avoiding the excluded letters. Let’s try G and K: “IANGK” – not a valid word.  
Try “IANGY” – not valid.  
Try “IANGH” – not valid.  

Next, try placing N in position 4 and I in position 5: “_ A _ N I”.

We need two consonants for positions 1 and 3. Let’s try M and P: “M A P N I” – not a word.  
Try “G A M N I” – not a word.  
Try “H A M N I” – not a word.  

Try placing N in position 3 and I in position 1: “I A N _ _”.

We need two consonants for positions 4 and 5. Let’s try G and K: “I A N G K” – not valid.  
Try “I A N G Y” – not valid.  

Try placing I in position 1 and N in position 4: “I A _ N _”.

We need consonants for positions 3 and 5. Let’s try M and K: “I A M N K” – not valid.  
Try “I A M N Y” – not valid.  

Try placing N in position 3 and I in position 5: “_ A N _ I”.

We need consonants for positions 1 and 4. Let’s try M and G: “M A N G I” – this is a valid word!

Check letters:
- M: new, allowed
- A: position 2 ✓
- N: position 3 (allowed, since N can be here)
- G: new, allowed
- I: position 5 (allowed, since I can be here)

This seems like a good next guess.
