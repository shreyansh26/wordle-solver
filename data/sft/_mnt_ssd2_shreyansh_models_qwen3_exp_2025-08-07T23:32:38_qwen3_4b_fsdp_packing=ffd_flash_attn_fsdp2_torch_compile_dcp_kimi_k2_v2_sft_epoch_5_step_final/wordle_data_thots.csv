### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters
- Covers letters that appear in many 5-letter words

This gives me maximum information about which letters might be in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓), so the word has an O in the 3rd position.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-), so S appears somewhere other than the 4th position.

3. Avoid A, R, E.
4. Use new common letters to maximize information.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters
- Covers letters that appear in many 5-letter words

This gives me maximum information about which letters might be in the secret word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓), so the word has an O in the 3rd position.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-), so S appears somewhere other than the 4th position.

Letters known to be absent: A, R, E  
Letters known to be present: O (position 3), S (somewhere else).

Next guess should:
1. Keep O in position 3.
2. Include S in a different position (1st, 2nd, or 5th).
3. Avoid A, R, E.
4. Use new common letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is “SPOIL”:
- S in 1st position (new position for S).
- P and I are common consonants and vowels we haven’t tested yet.
- O stays in 3rd position.
- L is another common consonant we haven’t tested.

From the two guesses so far we know:

Letters not in the word: A, R, E, P, I, L  
Letters definitely in the word: O (position 3), S (somewhere else)

Positions ruled out for S:
- 4th position (AROSE)
- 1st position (SPOIL)

So S must be in position 2 or 5.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 3
- S in position 2 or 5
- No A, R, E, P, I, L
- Only letters we haven’t tested yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s try S in position 2. Then the pattern is _ S _ O _.

A common word fitting this pattern is “BESOM” but E is excluded.  
“DUSKO” is not a valid word.  
“HUSKS” – S is in position 5 here, so let’s try S in position 5 instead.

Pattern: _ _ O _ S

Common word: “MOSHS” – not valid.  
“BONGO” – O already fixed in 3rd.  
“TANGO” – A excluded.  
“COWPS” – P excluded.  
“HUMPS” – P excluded.  
“JOKES” – E excluded.  
“KNOBS” – K, N, B, S valid, O in 3rd.  
“KNOBS” is a valid word.

Check letters: K, N, O, B, S – none are in the excluded list.  
S is in position 5 (new position), O stays in 3rd.

Let’s update what we now know after four guesses.

Letters NOT in the word (✗):
A, R, E, P, I, L, K, N, B, C, U

Letters definitely IN the word (✓):
O (must be in position 3), S (must be in position 5)

Letters whose status is still unknown:
D, F, G, H, J, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

From Guess 4 (HOCUS):
- H is in the word but NOT in position 1 (-)
- O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-)  (we already knew O is in position 3)
- C, U are not in the word (already listed above)
- S is in position 5 (✓)

So the word structure is: _ _ O _ S
and the letters in positions 1 and 2 must be chosen from the still-allowed letters:
D, F, G, H, J, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

We also know H is in the word but not in position 1, so H must be in position 2.

Thus the pattern is: _ H O _ S

We need a single letter for position 1 from the remaining allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- DHO _ S → DHOS? (not a word)
- FHO _ S → FHOS? (not a word)
- GHO _ S → GHOS? (not a word)
- JHO _ S → JHOS? (not a word)
- MHO _ S → MHOS? (not a word)
- THO _ S → THOS? (not a word)
- VHO _ S → VHOS? (not a word)
- WHO _ S → WHO?S (not a word)
- Other combinations also fail.

Wait, let’s try actual English words that fit _ H O _ S.

Scanning:
- THOSE – E is excluded
- WHOS? – not valid
- SHOCK – S already used in position 5
- SHOWN – N is excluded
- SHOUT – U is excluded
- SHOUL – not 5 letters
- SHOGI – I is excluded
- SHOGY – Y is allowed, but SHOGY is not a standard word
- SHOCK – already considered
- SHOTS – T is allowed, SHOTS is a valid word

Check SHOTS:
- S is already fixed in position 5
- H is in position 2 (allowed)
- O is in position 3 (fixed)
- T is allowed
- S is repeated – but the game allows repeated letters unless proven otherwise.

But we have no evidence that S is repeated, so let’s avoid repeats for now.

Another candidate: THOSE – E excluded  
Another: JHOS? – not a word  
Another: MHOS? – not a word  
Another: VHOS? – not a word  
Another: WHOS? – not a word  
Another: YHOS? – not a word  
Another: DHOS? – not a word  
Another: FHOS? – not a word  
Another: GHOS? – not a word  

Actually, let’s try a different approach: look for valid 5-letter words of the form _ H O _ S.

Valid words:
- THOSE – E excluded  
- SHOTS – S repeats, but valid  
- SHOGI – I excluded  
- SHOGY – Y allowed, but not a common word  
- SHOUL – not 5 letters  
- SHOCK – C excluded  
- SHOWN – N excluded  
- SHOUT – U excluded  

The only remaining valid word is SHOTS, despite the S repeat. Since we have no evidence against repeats and it fits all constraints, let’s try it.

But we already have S in position 5, and SHOTS has S in position 1 and 5. The game rules don’t forbid repeats unless feedback indicates otherwise. Since we have no feedback against repeats, SHOTS is the only valid candidate.

However, let’s check if there’s a word without repeats:  
Looking again, the only possible word seems to be SHOTS.  
Thus we proceed with SHOTS.

But wait, let’s verify:  
Letters in SHOTS: S, H, O, T, S  
- S is allowed in positions 1 and 5  
- H is allowed in position 2  
- O is allowed in position 3  
- T is allowed in position 4  

No conflicts with previous feedback.

Therefore, the next guess is SHOTS.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters
- Covers letters that appear in many 5-letter words

This gives me maximum information about which letters might be in the secret word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓), so the word has an O in the 3rd position.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-), so S appears somewhere other than the 4th position.

Letters known to be absent: A, R, E  
Letters known to be present: O (position 3), S (somewhere else).

Next guess should:
1. Keep O in position 3.
2. Include S in a different position (1st, 2nd, or 5th).
3. Avoid A, R, E.
4. Use new common letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is “SPOIL”:
- S in 1st position (new position for S).
- P and I are common consonants and vowels we haven’t tested yet.
- O stays in 3rd position.
- L is another common consonant we haven’t tested.

Guess 2: SPOIL -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) O(✓) I(x) L(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses so far we know:

Letters not in the word: A, R, E, P, I, L  
Letters definitely in the word: O (position 3), S (somewhere else)

Positions ruled out for S:
- 4th position (AROSE)
- 1st position (SPOIL)

So S must be in position 2 or 5.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 3
- S in position 2 or 5
- No A, R, E, P, I, L
- Only letters we haven’t tested yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s try S in position 2. Then the pattern is _ S _ O _.

A common word fitting this pattern is “BESOM” but E is excluded.  
“DUSKO” is not a valid word.  
“HUSKS” – S is in position 5 here, so let’s try S in position 5 instead.

Pattern: _ _ O _ S

Common word: “MOSHS” – not valid.  
“BONGO” – O already fixed in 3rd.  
“TANGO” – A excluded.  
“COWPS” – P excluded.  
“HUMPS” – P excluded.  
“JOKES” – E excluded.  
“KNOBS” – K, N, B, S valid, O in 3rd.  
“KNOBS” is a valid word.

Check letters: K, N, O, B, S – none are in the excluded list.  
S is in position 5 (new position), O stays in 3rd.

Let’s go with KNOBS.

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, E, P, I, L, K, N, B  
Letters definitely IN the word: O (position 3), S (position 5)

So the word has the fixed pattern: _ _ O _ S

Remaining unused letters that are still possible:  
C, D, F, G, H, J, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need two more distinct letters for positions 1 and 2, chosen from the allowed set, to form a valid English word ending in “O_S”.

Scanning common 5-letter words that fit _ _ O _ S:

- DOCUS – not a word  
- DOCUS – plural of “doc” is not 5 letters  
- HOCUS – valid word (a type of magic)  
- HOCUS – letters H, O, C, U, S – none are excluded  
- JOKUS – not a word  
- MOCUS – not a word  
- TOCUS – not a word  
- VOCUS – not a word  
- YOCUS – not a word  

HOCUS is the only valid candidate that fits the pattern and uses only allowed letters.

Guess 4: HOCUS -> FEEDBACK: H(-) O(-) C(x) U(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>

Let’s update what we now know after four guesses.

Letters NOT in the word (✗):
A, R, E, P, I, L, K, N, B, C, U

Letters definitely IN the word (✓):
O (must be in position 3), S (must be in position 5)

Letters whose status is still unknown:
D, F, G, H, J, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

From Guess 4 (HOCUS):
- H is in the word but NOT in position 1 (-)
- O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-)  (we already knew O is in position 3)
- C, U are not in the word (already listed above)
- S is in position 5 (✓)

So the word structure is: _ _ O _ S
and the letters in positions 1 and 2 must be chosen from the still-allowed letters:
D, F, G, H, J, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

We also know H is in the word but not in position 1, so H must be in position 2.

Thus the pattern is: _ H O _ S

We need a single letter for position 1 from the remaining allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- DHO _ S → DHOS? (not a word)
- FHO _ S → FHOS? (not a word)
- GHO _ S → GHOS? (not a word)
- JHO _ S → JHOS? (not a word)
- MHO _ S → MHOS? (not a word)
- THO _ S → THOS? (not a word)
- VHO _ S → VHOS? (not a word)
- WHO _ S → WHO?S (not a word)
- Other combinations also fail.

Wait, let’s try actual English words that fit _ H O _ S.

Scanning:
- THOSE – E is excluded
- WHOS? – not valid
- SHOCK – S already used in position 5
- SHOWN – N is excluded
- SHOUT – U is excluded
- SHOUL – not 5 letters
- SHOGI – I is excluded
- SHOGY – Y is allowed, but SHOGY is not a standard word
- SHOCK – already considered
- SHOTS – T is allowed, SHOTS is a valid word

Check SHOTS:
- S is already fixed in position 5
- H is in position 2 (allowed)
- O is in position 3 (fixed)
- T is allowed
- S is repeated – but the game allows repeated letters unless proven otherwise.

But we have no evidence that S is repeated, so let’s avoid repeats for now.

Another candidate: THOSE – E excluded  
Another: JHOS? – not a word  
Another: MHOS? – not a word  
Another: VHOS? – not a word  
Another: WHOS? – not a word  
Another: YHOS? – not a word  
Another: DHOS? – not a word  
Another: FHOS? – not a word  
Another: GHOS? – not a word  

Actually, let’s try a different approach: look for valid 5-letter words of the form _ H O _ S.

Valid words:
- THOSE – E excluded  
- SHOTS – S repeats, but valid  
- SHOGI – I excluded  
- SHOGY – Y allowed, but not a common word  
- SHOUL – not 5 letters  
- SHOCK – C excluded  
- SHOWN – N excluded  
- SHOUT – U excluded  

The only remaining valid word is SHOTS, despite the S repeat. Since we have no evidence against repeats and it fits all constraints, let’s try it.

But we already have S in position 5, and SHOTS has S in position 1 and 5. The game rules don’t forbid repeats unless feedback indicates otherwise. Since we have no feedback against repeats, SHOTS is the only valid candidate.

However, let’s check if there’s a word without repeats:  
Looking again, the only possible word seems to be SHOTS.  
Thus we proceed with SHOTS.

But wait, let’s verify:  
Letters in SHOTS: S, H, O, T, S  
- S is allowed in positions 1 and 5  
- H is allowed in position 2  
- O is allowed in position 3  
- T is allowed in position 4  

No conflicts with previous feedback.

Therefore, the next guess is SHOTS.

From the latest feedback (SHOTS):

Positions:
1: S (-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 1  
2: H (✓) – H is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2)  
3: O (✓) – O is in the word AND in the correct position (position 3)  
4: T (✓) – T is in the word AND in the correct position (position 4)  
5: S (✓) – S is in the word AND in the correct position (position 5)  

So the word is now fully determined except for position 1.  
We know:
- Position 1 ≠ S (from S(-) in position 1)  
- Position 1 must be a letter not yet ruled out (not in {A, R, E, P, I, L, K, N, B, C, U})  
- Position 1 must form a valid 5-letter word with the fixed pattern: _ H O T S  

The only remaining candidate letter for position 1 that forms a valid English word is D, giving the word DOHOT… wait, that’s not a word.  
Let me list all possible single letters for position 1 that make a real word ending in HOT S.

Valid English words ending in HOT S:
- JHOTS – not a word  
- MHOTS – not a word  
- VHOTS – not a word  
- WHOTS – not a word  
- DHOTS – not a word  
- FHOTS – not a word  
- GHOTS – not a word  
- THOTS – not a word  
- YHOTS – not a word  
- ZHOTS – not a word  

Wait, the only real word that ends in HOT S is “JHOTS” (a variant spelling of “jousts” in some contexts) but that’s obscure.  
However, the word “JHOTS” is not in standard dictionaries.

But there is a standard word: “JHOTS” is not valid.  
Actually, the only valid word that fits _ H O T S is “JHOTS” which is not valid.  
Let me re-examine the allowed letters.

Allowed letters for position 1: D, F, G, J, M, Q, V, W, Y, Z (excluding already excluded letters).

Looking up valid 5-letter words ending in HOT S:
- JHOTS – invalid  
- THOTS – invalid  
- DHOTS – invalid  
- FHOTS – invalid  

Wait, the word “THOSE” ends in OSE, not HOT S.  
I realize now: the correct word is “THOTS” which is not valid.  
But there is a valid word: “JHOTS” is not valid.

Actually, the only valid word is “JHOTS” which is not in standard dictionaries.  
But looking at Scrabble dictionaries, the word “JHOTS” is not valid.  
The word “THOTS” is also not valid.

This suggests I may have made an error earlier.  
Let me re-examine the pattern.

From the feedback:
- Position 2: H (✓)  
- Position 3: O (✓)  
- Position 4: T (✓)  
- Position 5: S (✓)  

So the word is: _ H O T S  

The only remaining valid English word that fits this pattern is “JHOTS”, but that is not recognized.  
However, in standard Scrabble lists, the word “JHOTS” is not valid.  
The word “THOTS” is also not valid.

This implies the only possible word is “JHOTS”, but since it’s not valid, I must have missed something.

Wait, let me re-examine the allowed letters for position 1.  
The excluded letters are: A, R, E, P, I, L, K, N, B, C, U, S (for position 1).  
Valid letters for position 1: D, F, G, H, J, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But position 2 is already H, so position 1 cannot be H (no repeats).  
Thus possible letters: D, F, G, J, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for valid words:  
- DHOST – not a word  
- FHOST – not a word  
- GHOST – valid word!  
- JHOTS – not a word  
- MHOTS – not a word  
- THOTS – not a word  

The word “GHOST” is valid and fits the pattern _ H O T S.

I realize now that “GHOST” is the correct word.  
Let me verify:  
G, H, O, T, S – none of these letters are excluded except S in position 1, but S is allowed in position 1 only if it’s not marked (-).  
From earlier feedback, S is not in position 1 (S(-) in position 1 from SHOTS), but S is allowed in other positions.  
However, in GHOST, S is in position 5 (✓), so this is acceptable.

Thus the word must be GHOST.

3: O (✓) – O is in the word AND in the correct position (position 3)  
4: T (✓) – T is in the word AND in the correct position (position 4)  
5: S (✓) – S is in the word AND in the correct position (position 5)  

So the word is now fully determined except for position 1.  
We know:
- Position 1 ≠ S (from S(-) in position 1)  
- Position 1 must be a letter not yet ruled out (not in {A, R, E, P, I, L, K, N, B, C, U})  
- Position 1 must form a valid 5-letter word with the fixed pattern: _ H O T S  

The only remaining candidate letter for position 1 that forms a valid English word is D, giving the word DOHOT… wait, that’s not a word.  
Let me list all possible single letters for position 1 that make a real word ending in HOT S.

Valid English words ending in HOT S:
- JHOTS – not a word  
- MHOTS – not a word  
- VHOTS – not a word  
- WHOTS – not a word  
- DHOTS – not a word  
- FHOTS – not a word  
- GHOTS – not a word  
- THOTS – not a word  
- YHOTS – not a word  
- ZHOTS – not a word  

Wait, the only real word that ends in HOT S is “JHOTS” (a variant spelling of “jousts” in some contexts) but that’s obscure.  
However, the word “JHOTS” is not in standard dictionaries.

But there is a standard word: “JHOTS” is not valid.  
Actually, the only valid word that fits _ H O T S is “JHOTS” which is not valid.  
Let me re-examine the allowed letters.

Allowed letters for position 1: D, F, G, J, M, Q, V, W, Y, Z (excluding already excluded letters).

Looking up valid 5-letter words ending in HOT S:
- JHOTS – invalid  
- THOTS – invalid  
- DHOTS – invalid  
- FHOTS – invalid  

Wait, the word “THOSE” ends in OSE, not HOT S.  
I realize now: the correct word is “THOTS” which is not valid.  
But there is a valid word: “JHOTS” is not valid.

Actually, the only valid word is “JHOTS” which is not in standard dictionaries.  
But looking at Scrabble dictionaries, the word “JHOTS” is not valid.  
The word “THOTS” is also not valid.

This suggests I may have made an error earlier.  
Let me re-examine the pattern.

From the feedback:
- Position 2: H (✓)  
- Position 3: O (✓)  
- Position 4: T (✓)  
- Position 5: S (✓)  

So the word is: _ H O T S  

The only remaining valid English word that fits this pattern is “JHOTS”, but that is not recognized.  
However, in standard Scrabble lists, the word “JHOTS” is not valid.  
The word “THOTS” is also not valid.

This implies the only possible word is “JHOTS”, but since it’s not valid, I must have missed something.

Wait, let me re-examine the allowed letters for position 1.  
The excluded letters are: A, R, E, P, I, L, K, N, B, C, U, S (for position 1).  
Valid letters for position 1: D, F, G, H, J, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But position 2 is already H, so position 1 cannot be H (no repeats).  
Thus possible letters: D, F, G, J, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for valid words:  
- DHOST – not a word  
- FHOST – not a word  
- GHOST – valid word!  
- JHOTS – not a word  
- MHOTS – not a word  
- THOTS – not a word  

The word “GHOST” is valid and fits the pattern _ H O T S.

I realize now that “GHOST” is the correct word.  
Let me verify:  
G, H, O, T, S – none of these letters are excluded except S in position 1, but S is allowed in position 1 only if it’s not marked (-).  
From earlier feedback, S is not in position 1 (S(-) in position 1 from SHOTS), but S is allowed in other positions.  
However, in GHOST, S is in position 5 (✓), so this is acceptable.

Thus the word must be GHOST.",Guess 6: GHOST -> FEEDBACK: G(x) H(✓) O(✓) S(-) T(-),FAIL
