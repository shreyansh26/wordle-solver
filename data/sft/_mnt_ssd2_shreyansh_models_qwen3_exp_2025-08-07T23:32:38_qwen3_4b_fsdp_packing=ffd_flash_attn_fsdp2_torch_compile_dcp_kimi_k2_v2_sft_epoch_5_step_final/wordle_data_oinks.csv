### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", etc. 

Looking at these options:
- ""AROSE"" has A, R, O, S, E - covers common vowels and consonants.
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E - also very common letters.
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E - another strong choice.

1. Letters that are NOT in the word (from both guesses): A, R, E, U, D

- Places them only in allowed positions.
- Fills the remaining two slots with two distinct letters from the allowed set.

Possible positions for O: 1, 4, 5  
Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", etc. 

Looking at these options:
- ""AROSE"" has A, R, O, S, E - covers common vowels and consonants.
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E - also very common letters.
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E - another strong choice.

- Has O not in position 3 and S not in position 4.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I’ll try a word like “POINT”:
- P, I, N, T are allowed.
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since it can’t be 3).
- S is not in POINT, so this guess doesn’t test S in another position. I need a word that includes S.

Let me try “SOUND”:
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since it can’t be 4).
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since it can’t be 3).
- U, N, D are allowed letters.

This tests S in position 1 and O in position 2, while avoiding the excluded letters.

Let’s consolidate what we know so far:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word (from both guesses): A, R, E, U, D  
2. Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong positions so far): O, S, N  
   - From AROSE: O is not in position 3, S is not in position 4  
   - From SOUND: S is not in position 1, O is not in position 2, N is not in position 4  

So the secret word contains O, S, N exactly once each, and avoids A, R, E, U, D.

Positions we have ruled out:
- O cannot be in 2 or 3
- S cannot be in 1 or 4
- N cannot be in 4

Remaining letters (besides O, S, N) that are allowed: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses O, S, N exactly once each.
- Places them only in allowed positions.
- Fills the remaining two slots with two distinct letters from the allowed set.

Let’s try to place O, S, N in allowed spots.

Possible positions for O: 1, 4, 5  
Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5  
Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3, 5  

A good candidate is “SONIC”:
- S in 1 – but S cannot be in 1 (from SOUND feedback) – discard.

Try “SNOWY”:
- S in 1 – again invalid.

Try “WISON”:
- S in 3 (allowed), O in 2 – but O cannot be in 2 (from SOUND) – discard.

Try “NOSYL” – not a valid word.

Try “TONIC”:
- T, I, C are allowed.
- O in 2 – invalid.

Try “CLOPS”:
- C, L, P allowed.
- O in 2 – invalid.

Try “STONY”:
- S in 1 – invalid.

Try “SONGS” – repeats S.

Try “SPOON” – repeats O.

Try “SNORT” – R is excluded.

Try “SNOWS” – repeats S.

Try “STONY” – S in 1.

Try “TISON” – T, I allowed.
- T I S O N
- S in 3 (allowed), O in 4 (allowed), N in 5 (allowed).
- All letters are allowed.

“TISON” is a valid English word (a type of fish).

Let’s check positions:
- S is in 3 – allowed (not 1 or 4)
- O is in 4 – allowed (not 2 or 3)
- N is in 5 – allowed (not 4)
- T and I are new letters from allowed set.

This seems valid.

Let’s summarize everything we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word  
A, R, E, U, D, T

Letters that ARE in the word  
I (fixed in position 2)  
O, S, N (each appears once, but in wrong positions so far)

Position constraints  
- I is locked in position 2.  
- O cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4 (from SOUND and TISON feedback).  
  ⇒ O must be in position 1 or 5.  
- S cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4 (from SOUND and TISON feedback).  
  ⇒ S must be in position 2 or 5.  
  But position 2 is already taken by I, so S must be in position 5.  
- N cannot be in positions 4, 5 (from SOUND and TISON feedback).  
  ⇒ N must be in positions 1, 3.  

We have the pattern so far:  
_ I _ _ _  

and we know:  
- S is in position 5 → _ I _ _ S  
- O must be in position 1 (only remaining spot) → O I _ _ S  
- N must be in position 3 → O I N _ S  

The missing letter (position 4) must be a new letter not yet excluded and not already used (O, I, N, S).  
Allowed letters left: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form O I N ? S.

Looking up, “OINFS” is not a word, “OINCS” is not a word, but “OINAS” is invalid (A excluded).  
However, “OINYS” is not a word.  
Wait, let me think of actual English words fitting O I N _ S.

Possible candidates:  
- OINAS – invalid (A excluded)  
- OINIS – invalid (I already used)  
- OINOS – “Oinos” is an archaic term for wine, but not common.  
- OINBS – not a word.  
- OINKS – “oinks” is slang for pig noises, but acceptable in word lists.

“OINKS” is a valid English word and fits the pattern:  
O(1) I(2) N(3) K(4) S(5).

Check constraints:  
- O is in position 1 (allowed).  
- I is in position 2 (fixed).  
- N is in position 3 (allowed).  
- S is in position 5 (allowed).  
- K is a new allowed letter.

Therefore, the next guess is “OINKS”.
