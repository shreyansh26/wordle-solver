- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, T, R, S, N, L, etc. Some popular choices are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), giving us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Vowels left: I, U (since O is already known to be present).

A strong second guess would be something like ""POINT"":
- P: new letter
- O: known to be in the word
- I: new vowel
- N: new letter
- T: new letter

This tests O in position 2 and introduces several new letters.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), giving us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- O: in the word but wrong position (-)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word does NOT contain A, R, S, or E.
- It DOES contain O, but not in position 3.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains O (but not in position 3).
2. Does NOT contain A, R, S, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Vowels left: I, U (since O is already known to be present).

A strong second guess would be something like ""POINT"":
- P: new letter
- O: known to be in the word
- I: new vowel
- N: new letter
- T: new letter

This tests O in position 2 and introduces several new letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(-) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on POINT:

- P: not in the word (x)
- O: in the word and in the correct position 2 (✓)
- I: not in the word (x)
- N: in the word but wrong position (-)
- T: in the word but wrong position (-)

So we now know:
1. The word has the form _ O _ _ _
2. It contains N and T somewhere, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
3. It does NOT contain A, R, S, E, P, I.

Remaining consonants to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: U (since O is fixed in position 2 and A, E, I are out).

We need a word that:
- Has O in position 2
- Contains both N and T (but N not in 4, T not in 5)
- Uses only allowed letters

Possible positions for N and T:
- N could be in 1, 3, or 5
- T could be in 1, 3, or 4

Let's try to place N and T in new positions. A good candidate is ""COUNT"":
- C: new letter
- O: confirmed in position 2
- U: new vowel
- N: in position 4 (but feedback said N is wrong position, so this is invalid)
Oops, N is in position 4 which we know is wrong.

Next try: ""DONUT"":
- D: new letter
- O: position 2
- N: position 3 (allowed)
- U: new vowel
- T: position 5 (but feedback says T is wrong position, so this is invalid)

Next try: ""MOUNT"":
- M: new letter
- O: position 2
- U: new vowel
- N: position 4 (invalid, same as COUNT)

Next try: ""TONIC"" - but I is out.

Next try: ""BONGO"" - but O is already in position 2, and this has O twice which might not be efficient.

Next try: ""FONNT"" - invalid, not a word.

Let's systematically place N and T:
Possible positions for N: 1, 3, 5
Possible positions for T: 1, 3, 4

We need to avoid N in 4 and T in 5.

Try N in 1, T in 3: _ O N T _ - but then we need a 5th letter. ""NOINT"" is invalid.

Try N in 3, T in 1: T O N _ _ - ""TONAL"" has A out.

Try N in 3, T in 4: _ O N T _ - ""CONUT"" is invalid.

Try N in 5, T in 1: T O _ _ N - ""TOTEN"" has E out.

Try N in 5, T in 3: _ O T _ N - ""COTYN"" is invalid.

Try N in 5, T in 4: _ O _ T N - ""BOTYN"" is invalid.

Let's try ""DONUT"" again but note N is in 4 which is invalid.

Alternative: ""BUNNY"" - but Y is allowed, but N is in 4 invalid.

Next try: ""GONNA"" - has A out.

Next try: ""HONKY"" - K and Y allowed, but N in 4 invalid.

Next try: ""JONNY"" - J and Y allowed, N in 4 invalid.

Next try: ""LONER"" - E and R out.

Next try: ""MONKS"" - S out.

Next try: ""TONIC"" - I out.

Next try: ""WONKY"" - same as HONKY.

Let's try ""TONAL"" - A out.

Next try: ""TONDO"" - D and O, but O is already in position 2.

Next try: ""TONIC"" - I out.

Next try: ""TONKA"" - A out.

Next try: ""TONY"" - too short.

Next try: ""TONDU"" - U is allowed, but ""TONDU"" is not a valid word.

Next try: ""TONED"" - E out.

Next try: ""TONAL"" - A out.

Next try: ""TONIC"" - I out.

Next try: ""TONKA"" - A out.

Next try: ""TONYO"" - not valid.

Next try: ""TONDY"" - not valid.

Let's try ""CONUT"" - N in 4 invalid.

Next try: ""CONDO"" - O is already in position 2.

Next try: ""CONGA"" - A out.

Next try: ""CONKY"" - K and Y allowed, N in 4 invalid.

Next try: ""CONTO"" - O is already in position 2.

Next try: ""CONUT"" - N in 4 invalid.

Next try: ""DONUT"" - N in 4 invalid.

Next try: ""FONDO"" - O in position 2, but ""FONDO"" is valid.

""FONDO"":
- F: new letter
- O: position 2
- N: position 3 (allowed)
- D: new letter
- O: position 5 - but O is already in position 2, and we don't know if O appears twice.

However, ""FONDO"" is a valid word meaning a type of fishing net. It uses:
- O in position 2 (confirmed)
- N in position 3 (allowed)
- F and D are new letters
- Second O is possible but not necessary.

This seems like a good third guess to test F, D, and confirm N's position.

Let’s list what we now know:

1. Word pattern: _ O _ _ _   (O is fixed in position 2)
2. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I, F, D
3. Letters that ARE in the word: O (already placed), N, T
4. N and T must appear somewhere else in the word (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5) and cannot be in the positions they were tried before:
   - N was tried in position 3 (FONDO) and was marked “-” (wrong position), so N cannot be in 3 → N must be in 1, 4, or 5.
   - T was tried in position 5 (POINT) and was marked “-”, so T cannot be in 5 → T must be in 1, 3, or 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2
- Contains both N and T in the remaining allowed positions
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no A, R, S, E, P, I, F, D)

Allowed letters left: B, C, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y, plus O (already used), N, T.

Possible positions for N and T:
- N: 1, 4, 5
- T: 1, 3, 4
- They cannot both be in position 4, so they must occupy three distinct positions among 1, 3, 4, 5 with N in 1/4/5 and T in 1/3/4.

Let’s try to place N and T while filling the remaining slots with allowed consonants.

Option 1: N in 1, T in 3 → N O T _ _ → need two more letters in positions 4 and 5 from allowed set.  
   Example: N O T U L → “NOTUL” – invalid (not a word).  
   N O T U M → “NOTUM” – invalid.  
   N O T U N → “NOTUN” – invalid.  
   N O T U C → “NOTUC” – invalid.  
   N O T U G → “NOTUG” – invalid.  
   N O T U B → “NOTUB” – invalid.  

Option 2: N in 1, T in 4 → N O _ T _ → need letters for 3 and 5.  
   N O U T Y – “NOUTY” – invalid.  
   N O L T Y – “NOLTY” – invalid.  
   N O C T Y – “NOCTY” – invalid.  
   N O M T Y – “NOMTY” – invalid.  

Option 3: N in 4, T in 1 → T O _ N _ → need letters for 3 and 5.  
   T O U N Y – “TOUNY” – invalid.  
   T O C N Y – “TOCNY” – invalid.  
   T O L N Y – “TOLNY” – invalid.  

Option 4: N in 4, T in 3 → _ O T N _ → need letters for 1 and 5.  
   C O T N Y – “COTNY” – invalid.  
   G O T N Y – “GOTNY” – invalid.  
   H O T N Y – “HOTNY” – invalid.

Option 9: N in 1, T in 4 and use U:  
   N O U T _ – “NOUT_” – invalid.  

Option 10: N in 4, T in 3 and use U:  
   _ O T N U – “_OTNU” – invalid.  

Option 11: N in 5, T in 1 and use U:  
   T O _ _ N → T O U C N – invalid.  

Option 12: N in 5, T in 3 and use U:  
   _ O T _ N → _ O T U N – “_OTUN” – invalid.  

Option 13: N in 5, T in 4 and use U:  
   _ O _ T N → _ O U T N – “_OUTN” – invalid.  

Let me think of real 5-letter words that fit:  
- “TONGY” – invalid.  
- “TONGU” – invalid.  
- “TONIC” – I out.

Try “GONUT” – same issue.  

Try “HONUT” – same.  

Try “MONUT” – same.  

Try “TONUL” – invalid.  

Try “TONKY” – K and Y allowed, N in 4 (allowed), T in 1 (allowed).  
“TONKY” is a valid word (a type of fish).  

Check:  
- T in 1 (allowed)  
- O in 2 (fixed)  
- N in 4 (allowed)  
- K in 3 (new letter)  
- Y in 5 (new letter)  

No forbidden letters.  

So “TONKY” is a valid next guess.

Try “MONUT” – same.  

Try “TONUL” – invalid.  

Try “TONKY” – K and Y allowed, N in 4 (allowed), T in 1 (allowed).  
“TONKY” is a valid word (a type of fish).  

Check:  
- T in 1 (allowed)  
- O in 2 (fixed)  
- N in 4 (allowed)  
- K in 3 (new letter)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, T, R, S, N, L, etc. Some popular choices are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), giving us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- O: in the word but wrong position (-)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word does NOT contain A, R, S, or E.
- It DOES contain O, but not in position 3.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains O (but not in position 3).
2. Does NOT contain A, R, S, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Vowels left: I, U (since O is already known to be present).

A strong second guess would be something like ""POINT"":
- P: new letter
- O: known to be in the word
- I: new vowel
- N: new letter
- T: new letter

This tests O in position 2 and introduces several new letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(-) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on POINT:

- P: not in the word (x)
- O: in the word and in the correct position 2 (✓)
- I: not in the word (x)
- N: in the word but wrong position (-)
- T: in the word but wrong position (-)

So we now know:
1. The word has the form _ O _ _ _
2. It contains N and T somewhere, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
3. It does NOT contain A, R, S, E, P, I.

Remaining consonants to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: U (since O is fixed in position 2 and A, E, I are out).

We need a word that:
- Has O in position 2
- Contains both N and T (but N not in 4, T not in 5)
- Uses only allowed letters

Possible positions for N and T:
- N could be in 1, 3, or 5
- T could be in 1, 3, or 4

Let's try to place N and T in new positions. A good candidate is ""COUNT"":
- C: new letter
- O: confirmed in position 2
- U: new vowel
- N: in position 4 (but feedback said N is wrong position, so this is invalid)
Oops, N is in position 4 which we know is wrong.

Next try: ""DONUT"":
- D: new letter
- O: position 2
- N: position 3 (allowed)
- U: new vowel
- T: position 5 (but feedback says T is wrong position, so this is invalid)

Next try: ""MOUNT"":
- M: new letter
- O: position 2
- U: new vowel
- N: position 4 (invalid, same as COUNT)

Next try: ""TONIC"" - but I is out.

Next try: ""BONGO"" - but O is already in position 2, and this has O twice which might not be efficient.

Next try: ""FONNT"" - invalid, not a word.

Let's systematically place N and T:
Possible positions for N: 1, 3, 5
Possible positions for T: 1, 3, 4

We need to avoid N in 4 and T in 5.

Try N in 1, T in 3: _ O N T _ - but then we need a 5th letter. ""NOINT"" is invalid.

Try N in 3, T in 1: T O N _ _ - ""TONAL"" has A out.

Try N in 3, T in 4: _ O N T _ - ""CONUT"" is invalid.

Try N in 5, T in 1: T O _ _ N - ""TOTEN"" has E out.

Try N in 5, T in 3: _ O T _ N - ""COTYN"" is invalid.

Try N in 5, T in 4: _ O _ T N - ""BOTYN"" is invalid.

Let's try ""DONUT"" again but note N is in 4 which is invalid.

Alternative: ""BUNNY"" - but Y is allowed, but N is in 4 invalid.

Next try: ""GONNA"" - has A out.

Next try: ""HONKY"" - K and Y allowed, but N in 4 invalid.

Next try: ""JONNY"" - J and Y allowed, N in 4 invalid.

Next try: ""LONER"" - E and R out.

Next try: ""MONKS"" - S out.

Next try: ""TONIC"" - I out.

Next try: ""WONKY"" - same as HONKY.

Let's try ""TONAL"" - A out.

Next try: ""TONDO"" - D and O, but O is already in position 2.

Next try: ""TONIC"" - I out.

Next try: ""TONKA"" - A out.

Next try: ""TONY"" - too short.

Next try: ""TONDU"" - U is allowed, but ""TONDU"" is not a valid word.

Next try: ""TONED"" - E out.

Next try: ""TONAL"" - A out.

Next try: ""TONIC"" - I out.

Next try: ""TONKA"" - A out.

Next try: ""TONYO"" - not valid.

Next try: ""TONDY"" - not valid.

Let's try ""CONUT"" - N in 4 invalid.

Next try: ""CONDO"" - O is already in position 2.

Next try: ""CONGA"" - A out.

Next try: ""CONKY"" - K and Y allowed, N in 4 invalid.

Next try: ""CONTO"" - O is already in position 2.

Next try: ""CONUT"" - N in 4 invalid.

Next try: ""DONUT"" - N in 4 invalid.

Next try: ""FONDO"" - O in position 2, but ""FONDO"" is valid.

""FONDO"":
- F: new letter
- O: position 2
- N: position 3 (allowed)
- D: new letter
- O: position 5 - but O is already in position 2, and we don't know if O appears twice.

However, ""FONDO"" is a valid word meaning a type of fishing net. It uses:
- O in position 2 (confirmed)
- N in position 3 (allowed)
- F and D are new letters
- Second O is possible but not necessary.

This seems like a good third guess to test F, D, and confirm N's position.

Let’s list what we now know:

1. Word pattern: _ O _ _ _   (O is fixed in position 2)
2. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I, F, D
3. Letters that ARE in the word: O (already placed), N, T
4. N and T must appear somewhere else in the word (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5) and cannot be in the positions they were tried before:
   - N was tried in position 3 (FONDO) and was marked “-” (wrong position), so N cannot be in 3 → N must be in 1, 4, or 5.
   - T was tried in position 5 (POINT) and was marked “-”, so T cannot be in 5 → T must be in 1, 3, or 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2
- Contains both N and T in the remaining allowed positions
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no A, R, S, E, P, I, F, D)

Allowed letters left: B, C, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y, plus O (already used), N, T.

Possible positions for N and T:
- N: 1, 4, 5
- T: 1, 3, 4
- They cannot both be in position 4, so they must occupy three distinct positions among 1, 3, 4, 5 with N in 1/4/5 and T in 1/3/4.

Let’s try to place N and T while filling the remaining slots with allowed consonants.

Option 1: N in 1, T in 3 → N O T _ _ → need two more letters in positions 4 and 5 from allowed set.  
   Example: N O T U L → “NOTUL” – invalid (not a word).  
   N O T U M → “NOTUM” – invalid.  
   N O T U N → “NOTUN” – invalid.  
   N O T U C → “NOTUC” – invalid.  
   N O T U G → “NOTUG” – invalid.  
   N O T U B → “NOTUB” – invalid.  

Option 2: N in 1, T in 4 → N O _ T _ → need letters for 3 and 5.  
   N O U T Y – “NOUTY” – invalid.  
   N O L T Y – “NOLTY” – invalid.  
   N O C T Y – “NOCTY” – invalid.  
   N O M T Y – “NOMTY” – invalid.  

Option 3: N in 4, T in 1 → T O _ N _ → need letters for 3 and 5.  
   T O U N Y – “TOUNY” – invalid.  
   T O C N Y – “TOCNY” – invalid.  
   T O L N Y – “TOLNY” – invalid.  

Option 4: N in 4, T in 3 → _ O T N _ → need letters for 1 and 5.  
   C O T N Y – “COTNY” – invalid.  
   G O T N Y – “GOTNY” – invalid.  
   H O T N Y – “HOTNY” – invalid.  

Option 5: N in 5, T in 1 → T O _ _ N → need letters for 3 and 4.  
   T O U C N – “TOUCN” – invalid.  
   T O L C N – “TOLCN” – invalid.  
   T O M C N – “TOMCN” – invalid.  

Option 6: N in 5, T in 3 → _ O T _ N → need letters for 1 and 4.  
   C O T U N – “COTUN” – invalid.  
   G O T U N – “GOTUN” – invalid.  
   H O T U N – “HOTUN” – invalid.  

Option 7: N in 5, T in 4 → _ O _ T N → need letters for 1 and 3.  
   C O U T N – “COU TN” – invalid.  
   G O U T N – “GOU TN” – invalid.  
   H O U T N – “HOU TN” – invalid.  

Option 8: N in 1, T in 3 and use U for one of the blanks:  
   N O T U _ – “NOTU_” – invalid.  

Option 9: N in 1, T in 4 and use U:  
   N O U T _ – “NOUT_” – invalid.  

Option 10: N in 4, T in 3 and use U:  
   _ O T N U – “_OTNU” – invalid.  

Option 11: N in 5, T in 1 and use U:  
   T O _ _ N → T O U C N – invalid.  

Option 12: N in 5, T in 3 and use U:  
   _ O T _ N → _ O T U N – “_OTUN” – invalid.  

Option 13: N in 5, T in 4 and use U:  
   _ O _ T N → _ O U T N – “_OUTN” – invalid.  

Let me think of real 5-letter words that fit:  
- “TONGY” – invalid.  
- “TONGU” – invalid.  
- “TONIC” – I out.  
- “TONAL” – A out.  
- “TONKA” – A out.  
- “TONDO” – already tried.  
- “TONNE” – E out.  
- “TONER” – E, R out.  
- “TONYA” – A out.  

Real words left:  
- “TONIC” – I out.  
- “TONAL” – A out.  
- “TONKA” – A out.  
- “TONNE” – E out.  
- “TONER” – E, R out.  

Wait, let’s try “CONUT” – N is in 4 (allowed), T in 5 (but T cannot be in 5).  

Try “GONUT” – same issue.  

Try “HONUT” – same.  

Try “MONUT” – same.  

Try “TONUL” – invalid.  

Try “TONKY” – K and Y allowed, N in 4 (allowed), T in 1 (allowed).  
“TONKY” is a valid word (a type of fish).  

Check:  
- T in 1 (allowed)  
- O in 2 (fixed)  
- N in 4 (allowed)  
- K in 3 (new letter)  
- Y in 5 (new letter)  

No forbidden letters.  

So “TONKY” is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, T, R, S, N, L, etc. Some popular choices are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), giving us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- O: in the word but wrong position (-)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word does NOT contain A, R, S, or E.
- It DOES contain O, but not in position 3.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains O (but not in position 3).
2. Does NOT contain A, R, S, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Vowels left: I, U (since O is already known to be present).

A strong second guess would be something like ""POINT"":
- P: new letter
- O: known to be in the word
- I: new vowel
- N: new letter
- T: new letter

This tests O in position 2 and introduces several new letters.

Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(-) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on POINT:

- P: not in the word (x)
- O: in the word and in the correct position 2 (✓)
- I: not in the word (x)
- N: in the word but wrong position (-)
- T: in the word but wrong position (-)

So we now know:
1. The word has the form _ O _ _ _
2. It contains N and T somewhere, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
3. It does NOT contain A, R, S, E, P, I.

Remaining consonants to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: U (since O is fixed in position 2 and A, E, I are out).

We need a word that:
- Has O in position 2
- Contains both N and T (but N not in 4, T not in 5)
- Uses only allowed letters

Possible positions for N and T:
- N could be in 1, 3, or 5
- T could be in 1, 3, or 4

Let's try to place N and T in new positions. A good candidate is ""COUNT"":
- C: new letter
- O: confirmed in position 2
- U: new vowel
- N: in position 4 (but feedback said N is wrong position, so this is invalid)
Oops, N is in position 4 which we know is wrong.

Next try: ""DONUT"":
- D: new letter
- O: position 2
- N: position 3 (allowed)
- U: new vowel
- T: position 5 (but feedback says T is wrong position, so this is invalid)

Next try: ""MOUNT"":
- M: new letter
- O: position 2
- U: new vowel
- N: position 4 (invalid, same as COUNT)

Next try: ""TONIC"" - but I is out.

Next try: ""BONGO"" - but O is already in position 2, and this has O twice which might not be efficient.

Next try: ""FONNT"" - invalid, not a word.

Let's systematically place N and T:
Possible positions for N: 1, 3, 5
Possible positions for T: 1, 3, 4

We need to avoid N in 4 and T in 5.

Try N in 1, T in 3: _ O N T _ - but then we need a 5th letter. ""NOINT"" is invalid.

Try N in 3, T in 1: T O N _ _ - ""TONAL"" has A out.

Try N in 3, T in 4: _ O N T _ - ""CONUT"" is invalid.

Try N in 5, T in 1: T O _ _ N - ""TOTEN"" has E out.

Try N in 5, T in 3: _ O T _ N - ""COTYN"" is invalid.

Try N in 5, T in 4: _ O _ T N - ""BOTYN"" is invalid.

Let's try ""DONUT"" again but note N is in 4 which is invalid.

Alternative: ""BUNNY"" - but Y is allowed, but N is in 4 invalid.

Next try: ""GONNA"" - has A out.

Next try: ""HONKY"" - K and Y allowed, but N in 4 invalid.

Next try: ""JONNY"" - J and Y allowed, N in 4 invalid.

Next try: ""LONER"" - E and R out.

Next try: ""MONKS"" - S out.

Next try: ""TONIC"" - I out.

Next try: ""WONKY"" - same as HONKY.

Let's try ""TONAL"" - A out.

Next try: ""TONDO"" - D and O, but O is already in position 2.

Next try: ""TONIC"" - I out.

Next try: ""TONKA"" - A out.

Next try: ""TONY"" - too short.

Next try: ""TONDU"" - U is allowed, but ""TONDU"" is not a valid word.

Next try: ""TONED"" - E out.

Next try: ""TONAL"" - A out.

Next try: ""TONIC"" - I out.

Next try: ""TONKA"" - A out.

Next try: ""TONYO"" - not valid.

Next try: ""TONDY"" - not valid.

Let's try ""CONUT"" - N in 4 invalid.

Next try: ""CONDO"" - O is already in position 2.

Next try: ""CONGA"" - A out.

Next try: ""CONKY"" - K and Y allowed, N in 4 invalid.

Next try: ""CONTO"" - O is already in position 2.

Next try: ""CONUT"" - N in 4 invalid.

Next try: ""DONUT"" - N in 4 invalid.

Next try: ""FONDO"" - O in position 2, but ""FONDO"" is valid.

""FONDO"":
- F: new letter
- O: position 2
- N: position 3 (allowed)
- D: new letter
- O: position 5 - but O is already in position 2, and we don't know if O appears twice.

However, ""FONDO"" is a valid word meaning a type of fishing net. It uses:
- O in position 2 (confirmed)
- N in position 3 (allowed)
- F and D are new letters
- Second O is possible but not necessary.

This seems like a good third guess to test F, D, and confirm N's position.

Let’s list what we now know:

1. Word pattern: _ O _ _ _   (O is fixed in position 2)
2. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I, F, D
3. Letters that ARE in the word: O (already placed), N, T
4. N and T must appear somewhere else in the word (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5) and cannot be in the positions they were tried before:
   - N was tried in position 3 (FONDO) and was marked “-” (wrong position), so N cannot be in 3 → N must be in 1, 4, or 5.
   - T was tried in position 5 (POINT) and was marked “-”, so T cannot be in 5 → T must be in 1, 3, or 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2
- Contains both N and T in the remaining allowed positions
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no A, R, S, E, P, I, F, D)

Allowed letters left: B, C, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y, plus O (already used), N, T.

Possible positions for N and T:
- N: 1, 4, 5
- T: 1, 3, 4
- They cannot both be in position 4, so they must occupy three distinct positions among 1, 3, 4, 5 with N in 1/4/5 and T in 1/3/4.

Let’s try to place N and T while filling the remaining slots with allowed consonants.

Option 1: N in 1, T in 3 → N O T _ _ → need two more letters in positions 4 and 5 from allowed set.  
   Example: N O T U L → “NOTUL” – invalid (not a word).  
   N O T U M → “NOTUM” – invalid.

   N O C T Y – “NOCTY” – invalid.  
   N O M T Y – “NOMTY” – invalid.  

Option 3: N in 4, T in 1 → T O _ N _ → need letters for 3 and 5.  
   T O U N Y – “TOUNY” – invalid.  
   T O C N Y – “TOCNY” – invalid.  
   T O L N Y – “TOLNY” – invalid.

   C O T N Y – “COTNY” – invalid.  
   G O T N Y – “GOTNY” – invalid.  
   H O T N Y – “HOTNY” – invalid.  

Option 5: N in 5, T in 1 → T O _ _ N → need letters for 3 and 4.  
   T O U C N – “TOUCN” – invalid.  
   T O L C N – “TOLCN” – invalid.  
   T O M C N – “TOMCN” – invalid.  

Option 6: N in 5, T in 3 → _ O T _ N → need letters for 1 and 4.  
   C O T U N – “COTUN” – invalid.  
   G O T U N – “GOTUN” – invalid.  
   H O T U N – “HOTUN” – invalid.  

Option 7: N in 5, T in 4 → _ O _ T N → need letters for 1 and 3.  
   C O U T N – “COU TN” – invalid.  
   G O U T N – “GOU TN” – invalid.  
   H O U T N – “HOU TN” – invalid.  

Option 8: N in 1, T in 3 and use U for one of the blanks:  
   N O T U _ – “NOTU_” – invalid.  

Option 9: N in 1, T in 4 and use U:  
   N O U T _ – “NOUT_” – invalid.  

Option 10: N in 4, T in 3 and use U:  
   _ O T N U – “_OTNU” – invalid.  

Option 11: N in 5, T in 1 and use U:  
   T O _ _ N → T O U C N – invalid.  

Option 12: N in 5, T in 3 and use U:  
   _ O T _ N → _ O T U N – “_OTUN” – invalid.  

Option 13: N in 5, T in 4 and use U:  
   _ O _ T N → _ O U T N – “_OUTN” – invalid.  

Let me think of real 5-letter words that fit:  
- “TONGY” – invalid.  
- “TONGU” – invalid.  
- “TONIC” – I out.  
- “TONAL” – A out.  
- “TONKA” – A out.  
- “TONDO” – already tried.  
- “TONNE” – E out.  
- “TONER” – E, R out.  
- “TONYA” – A out.  

Real words left:  
- “TONIC” – I out.  
- “TONAL” – A out.  
- “TONKA” – A out.  
- “TONNE” – E out.  
- “TONER” – E, R out.  

Wait, let’s try “CONUT” – N is in 4 (allowed), T in 5 (but T cannot be in 5).  

Try “GONUT” – same issue.  

Try “HONUT” – same.  

Try “MONUT” – same.  

Try “TONUL” – invalid.  

Try “TONKY” – K and Y allowed, N in 4 (allowed), T in 1 (allowed).  
“TONKY” is a valid word (a type of fish).  

Check:  
- T in 1 (allowed)  
- O in 2 (fixed)  
- N in 4 (allowed)  
- K in 3 (new letter)  
- Y in 5 (new letter)  

No forbidden letters.  

So “TONKY” is a valid next guess.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after four guesses.

1. Word pattern: _ O _ _ _   (O is fixed in position 2)
2. Letters that are NOT in the word (x feedback):  
   A, R, S, E, P, I, F, D, K, Y
3. Letters that ARE in the word (✓ or - feedback):  
   O (position 2), N, T
4. Positions ruled out so far for N and T:
   - N: cannot be in 3 (FONDO), 4 (TONKY)  
     ⇒ N must be in 1 or 5
   - T: cannot be in 1 (TONKY), 5 (POINT)  
     ⇒ T must be in 3 or 4

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2
- Contains both N and T in the remaining allowed positions
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out

Allowed letters (excluding the x-list):  
B, C, G, H, L, M, U, V, W, plus the required N and T.

Possible placements:
- N in 1, T in 3 or 4
- N in 5, T in 3 or 4

Let’s enumerate valid patterns:

Pattern 1: N O T _ _   (T in 3)  
   Need letters for 4 and 5 from allowed set.  
   N O T U L – invalid  
   N O T U M – invalid  
   N O T U B – invalid  
   N O T U C – invalid  
   N O T U G – invalid  
   N O T U H – invalid  
   N O T U L – invalid  
   Real word check: “NOTUM” – invalid, “NOTCH” – C and H allowed but pattern is N O T _ _ → “NOTCH” has T in 3 and C/H in 4/5 → valid word.  
   “NOTCH” uses N(1), O(2), T(3), C(4), H(5) – all allowed.

Pattern 2: N O _ T _   (T in 4)  
   N O U T Y – invalid (Y out)  
   N O L T U – invalid  
   Real word check: “NOVIT” – invalid  
   “NOVIT” – V, I – I out.  
   “NOVIT” invalid.  
   “NOVUL” – invalid.  
   “NOVUM” – invalid.  
   “NOVUS” – S out.  
   No valid words here.

Pattern 3: _ O T _ _   (T in 3)  
   N cannot be in 1 here because N must be in 1 or 5.  
   If N in 5: _ O T _ N  
   Need letter for 4:  
   C O T U N – invalid  
   G O T U N – invalid  
   H O T U N – invalid  
   Real word check: “GOTUN” – invalid.  
   “COTUN” – invalid.  
   “HOTUN” – invalid.  
   No valid words.

Pattern 4: _ O _ T _   (T in 4)  
   N must be in 5: _ O _ T N  
   Need letters for 1 and 3:  
   C O U T N – invalid  
   G O U T N – invalid  
   H O U T N – invalid  
   Real word check: “GOUTN” – invalid.  
   “HOUTN” – invalid.  
   No valid words.

Pattern 5: N O _ _ T   (T in 5) – but T cannot be in 5 (POINT feedback).  
   Invalid.

Pattern 6: N O _ T _ – already checked.

Only valid candidate is “NOTCH” from Pattern 1.

Check “NOTCH”:
- N in 1 (allowed)  
- O in 2 (fixed)  
- T in 3 (allowed)  
- C in 4 (allowed)  
- H in 5 (allowed)  
- No forbidden letters.  
- Real word.

Therefore, the next guess is “NOTCH”.

3. Letters known NOT to be in the word (from all x-feedback):  
   A, R, S, E, P, I, F, D, K, Y, C, H
4. Remaining allowed letters for positions 4 and 5:  
   B, G, L, M, U, V, W

We need a 5-letter word that starts with NOT and ends with two letters from the allowed set.

Possible endings:
- NOT + B: NOTB_ – invalid
- NOT + G: NOTG_ – invalid
- NOT + L: NOTL_ – invalid
- NOT + M: NOTM_ – invalid
- NOT + U: NOTU_ – invalid
- NOT + V: NOTV_ – invalid
- NOT + W: NOTW_ – invalid

Real words that fit:
- NOTUM – invalid (U and M allowed, but “NOTUM” is a real word, but we have U in 4 and M in 5)  
  Check letters: N(✓), O(✓), T(✓), U(allowed), M(allowed) – no forbidden letters.

- NOTCH – already tried (C and H are out).

- NOTUM – valid word, uses allowed letters.

Therefore, the only remaining valid word is “NOTUM”.

Check:
- N(1) ✓, O(2) ✓, T(3) ✓, U(4) allowed, M(5) allowed.
- No forbidden letters.
