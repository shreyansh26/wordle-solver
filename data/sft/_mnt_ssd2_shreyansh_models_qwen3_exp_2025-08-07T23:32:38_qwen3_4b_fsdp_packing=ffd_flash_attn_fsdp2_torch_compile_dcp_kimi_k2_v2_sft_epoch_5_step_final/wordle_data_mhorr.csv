For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once. Common starting words include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", ""AUDIO"", etc. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A word like ""AROSE"" uses 5 of these high-frequency letters, giving good coverage. However, ""SLATE"" is another strong choice because it includes S, L, A, T, E - which are all very common.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers A, R, O, S, E - five of the most frequent letters in English words, providing a good foundation for subsequent guesses based on the feedback received.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: x → not in the word
- R: - → in the word but not in position 2
- O: ✓ → in the word and in position 3
- S: x → not in the word
- E: x → not in the word

- BORON (but has two O's and N is less common)
- CORGI (but C and G are less common)
- TORON (but has two O's and N is less common)

A better choice is ""FRONT"" because:
- Keeps O in position 3
- Places R in position 2 (but feedback says R is NOT in position 2, so this is bad)
Wait, that's a mistake - R can't be in position 2.

Let me rethink:
- O is fixed in position 3
- R must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but 3 is O, so 1, 4, or 5)

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A, S, E are NOT in the word.
- O is in position 3 (✓).
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).

From Guess 2 (ROUND):
- R is in the word but NOT in position 1 (-) (so R must be in 3, 4, or 5).
- O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-) (but we already know it’s in position 3 from Guess 1, so this is consistent).
- U, N, D are NOT in the word.

Summary of constraints:
1. Word length = 5.
2. Position 3 = O.
3. R is in the word, but NOT in positions 1 or 2 → R must be in position 4 or 5.
4. Forbidden letters so far: A, S, E, U, N, D.
5. Still need to test other common letters: T, I, L, C, M, P, etc.

Possible patterns:
- _ _ O R _
- _ _ O _ R

Let’s pick a word that fits one of these patterns and introduces new common letters.

Option 1: _ _ O R _ → e.g., FLOUR (but F, L are okay, U is forbidden).
Option 2: _ _ O _ R → e.g., BORIC (but C is okay, I is okay, B is okay).

A good candidate is “BROIL”:
- B, I, L are new letters.
- R is in position 4 (allowed).
- O is in position 3 (correct).
- No forbidden letters.

Another candidate is “CORGI” (but G is less common).
“BROIL” seems better.

But wait: does “BROIL” use any forbidden letters? B, R, O, I, L – none of A, S, E, U, N, D. Good.

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A word like ""AROSE"" uses 5 of these high-frequency letters, giving good coverage. However, ""SLATE"" is another strong choice because it includes S, L, A, T, E - which are all very common.

Possible candidates:
- FRONT (but F and N are less common)
- BORON (but has two O's and N is less common)
- CORGI (but C and G are less common)
- TORON (but has two O's and N is less common)

A better choice is ""FRONT"" because:
- Keeps O in position 3
- Places R in position 2 (but feedback says R is NOT in position 2, so this is bad)
Wait, that's a mistake - R can't be in position 2.

Let me rethink:
- O is fixed in position 3
- R must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but 3 is O, so 1, 4, or 5)
- Avoid A, S, E

Good candidates:
- ROUND (R in 1, O in 3, uses U, N, D - all new letters)
- BROKE (but has E which is out)
- CROOK (has O twice and K is less common)
- DROOL (has O twice and L is okay, but O is already known)

""ROUND"" seems best:
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- O in position 3 (correct)
- Uses new letters U, N, D
- No A, S, E

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A, S, E are NOT in the word.
- O is in position 3 (✓).
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).

From Guess 2 (ROUND):
- R is in the word but NOT in position 1 (-) (so R must be in 3, 4, or 5).
- O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-) (but we already know it’s in position 3 from Guess 1, so this is consistent).
- U, N, D are NOT in the word.

Summary of constraints:
1. Word length = 5.
2. Position 3 = O.
3. R is in the word, but NOT in positions 1 or 2 → R must be in position 4 or 5.
4. Forbidden letters so far: A, S, E, U, N, D.
5. Still need to test other common letters: T, I, L, C, M, P, etc.

Possible patterns:
- _ _ O R _
- _ _ O _ R

Let’s pick a word that fits one of these patterns and introduces new common letters.

Option 1: _ _ O R _ → e.g., FLOUR (but F, L are okay, U is forbidden).
Option 2: _ _ O _ R → e.g., BORIC (but C is okay, I is okay, B is okay).

A good candidate is “BROIL”:
- B, I, L are new letters.
- R is in position 4 (allowed).
- O is in position 3 (correct).
- No forbidden letters.

Another candidate is “CORGI” (but G is less common).
“BROIL” seems better.

But wait: does “BROIL” use any forbidden letters? B, R, O, I, L – none of A, S, E, U, N, D. Good.

Let’s go with BROIL.

- Forbidden letters: A, S, E, U, N, D, B, I, L.

Possible patterns:

Let’s look for 5-letter words that fit one of these patterns, use only allowed letters, and introduce new common letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once. Common starting words include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", ""AUDIO"", etc. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A word like ""AROSE"" uses 5 of these high-frequency letters, giving good coverage. However, ""SLATE"" is another strong choice because it includes S, L, A, T, E - which are all very common.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers A, R, O, S, E - five of the most frequent letters in English words, providing a good foundation for subsequent guesses based on the feedback received.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: x → not in the word
- R: - → in the word but not in position 2
- O: ✓ → in the word and in position 3
- S: x → not in the word
- E: x → not in the word

So we know:
- The word has an O in the 3rd position.
- It contains an R somewhere other than position 2.
- It does NOT contain A, S, or E.

To maximize new information, I want a word that:
1. Keeps O in position 3.
2. Includes R but not in position 2.
3. Uses new common letters (T, N, L, I, etc.) that haven't been tested yet.

Possible candidates:
- FRONT (but F and N are less common)
- BORON (but has two O's and N is less common)
- CORGI (but C and G are less common)
- TORON (but has two O's and N is less common)

A better choice is ""FRONT"" because:
- Keeps O in position 3
- Places R in position 2 (but feedback says R is NOT in position 2, so this is bad)
Wait, that's a mistake - R can't be in position 2.

Let me rethink:
- O is fixed in position 3
- R must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but 3 is O, so 1, 4, or 5)
- Avoid A, S, E

Good candidates:
- ROUND (R in 1, O in 3, uses U, N, D - all new letters)

Let’s update what we now know after four guesses.

Known facts:
1. Position 3 is definitely O.
2. R is in the word but cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 4 (from ROUND and FROTH feedback).
   - Therefore R must be in position 5.
3. Forbidden letters so far: A, S, E, U, N, D, B, I, L, F, T.
4. Position 5 must be R.
5. Remaining positions 1, 2, 4 must be filled with letters not yet ruled out.
   Allowed letters (common ones): C, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Pattern so far: _ _ O _ R

We need a valid 5-letter word fitting this pattern, using only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- CORNY (but N is forbidden)
- GORGY (but G twice, Y okay)
- MORPH (but P, H okay, but F is forbidden)
- WORTH (but T is forbidden)
- PORCH (but C, H okay, P, O, R, C, H – C is okay, H is okay)
- HOPOR (not a word)
- MOPAR (but A is forbidden)
- COPRA (but A is forbidden)
- VORRY (not a word)
- CORYR (not a word)
- HORDE (but D, E forbidden)
- GORGE (but E forbidden)
- HORNY (but N forbidden)
- COPRO (not a word)
- MOROR (not a word)
- PORRO (not a word)
- VORON (not a word)
- MOPRA (not a word)
- COPRA (not a word)

The only valid word that fits is ""PORCH"":
- P, O, R, C, H
- All letters are allowed (none in forbidden list)
- Pattern _ _ O _ R → P O R C H → positions: P(1), O(3), R(5), C(4), H(2) – but that would be P H O C R, which is not a word.

Wait, let's list positions correctly:
Word must be: [1] [2] O [4] R

PORCH: P(1), O(3), R(5) – but the word is P-O-R-C-H, which is P(1), O(2), R(3), C(4), H(5) – doesn't fit.

Looking again:
We need _ _ O _ R

Valid words:
- CORNY – N forbidden
- GORGE – E forbidden
- HORDE – D, E forbidden
- MOPAR – A forbidden
- PORCH – doesn't fit pattern
- VORRY – not a word
- COPRA – A forbidden
- MORPH – H, P, M okay, but F is forbidden (MORPH has no F)
Wait, MORPH: M, O, R, P, H – none forbidden, and pattern M O R P H – positions: M(1), O(3), R(5), P(4), H(2) – fits _ _ O _ R.

So MORPH is valid:
- M(1), O(3), R(5)
- P(4), H(2)
- Letters: M, O, R, P, H – none forbidden.

Let's check if any other word is better. Another candidate is ""GOURD"" but D is forbidden.
Another is ""GORY"" but that's 4 letters.
Another is ""GROPE"" but E is forbidden.
Another is ""CROOK"" but O is repeated and K is okay, but O is already in 3, and word would be C R O O K – but O is already in 3, and we don't know about second O, but CROOK is valid, but let's see:
C R O O K – positions: C(1), R(2) – but R cannot be in 2 (from AROSE feedback). So CROOK is invalid.

Thus, MORPH is the best next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once. Common starting words include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", ""AUDIO"", etc. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A word like ""AROSE"" uses 5 of these high-frequency letters, giving good coverage. However, ""SLATE"" is another strong choice because it includes S, L, A, T, E - which are all very common.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers A, R, O, S, E - five of the most frequent letters in English words, providing a good foundation for subsequent guesses based on the feedback received.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: x → not in the word
- R: - → in the word but not in position 2
- O: ✓ → in the word and in position 3
- S: x → not in the word
- E: x → not in the word

So we know:
- The word has an O in the 3rd position.
- It contains an R somewhere other than position 2.
- It does NOT contain A, S, or E.

To maximize new information, I want a word that:
1. Keeps O in position 3.
2. Includes R but not in position 2.
3. Uses new common letters (T, N, L, I, etc.) that haven't been tested yet.

Possible candidates:
- FRONT (but F and N are less common)
- BORON (but has two O's and N is less common)
- CORGI (but C and G are less common)
- TORON (but has two O's and N is less common)

A better choice is ""FRONT"" because:
- Keeps O in position 3
- Places R in position 2 (but feedback says R is NOT in position 2, so this is bad)
Wait, that's a mistake - R can't be in position 2.

Let me rethink:
- O is fixed in position 3
- R must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but 3 is O, so 1, 4, or 5)
- Avoid A, S, E

Good candidates:
- ROUND (R in 1, O in 3, uses U, N, D - all new letters)
- BROKE (but has E which is out)
- CROOK (has O twice and K is less common)
- DROOL (has O twice and L is okay, but O is already known)

""ROUND"" seems best:
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- O in position 3 (correct)
- Uses new letters U, N, D
- No A, S, E

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A, S, E are NOT in the word.
- O is in position 3 (✓).
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).

From Guess 2 (ROUND):
- R is in the word but NOT in position 1 (-) (so R must be in 3, 4, or 5).
- O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-) (but we already know it’s in position 3 from Guess 1, so this is consistent).
- U, N, D are NOT in the word.

Summary of constraints:
1. Word length = 5.
2. Position 3 = O.
3. R is in the word, but NOT in positions 1 or 2 → R must be in position 4 or 5.
4. Forbidden letters so far: A, S, E, U, N, D.
5. Still need to test other common letters: T, I, L, C, M, P, etc.

Possible patterns:
- _ _ O R _
- _ _ O _ R

Let’s pick a word that fits one of these patterns and introduces new common letters.

Option 1: _ _ O R _ → e.g., FLOUR (but F, L are okay, U is forbidden).
Option 2: _ _ O _ R → e.g., BORIC (but C is okay, I is okay, B is okay).

A good candidate is “BROIL”:
- B, I, L are new letters.
- R is in position 4 (allowed).
- O is in position 3 (correct).
- No forbidden letters.

Another candidate is “CORGI” (but G is less common).
“BROIL” seems better.

But wait: does “BROIL” use any forbidden letters? B, R, O, I, L – none of A, S, E, U, N, D. Good.

Let’s go with BROIL.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A, S, E are NOT in the word.
- O is in position 3 (✓).
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).

From Guess 2 (ROUND):
- U, N, D are NOT in the word.
- R is NOT in position 1 (-) (already knew it’s not in 2).
- O is NOT in position 2 (-) (but we already know it’s in 3).

From Guess 3 (BROIL):
- B, I, L are NOT in the word.
- R is NOT in position 2 (-) (already knew).
- O is still in position 3 (✓).

So far we have:
- Position 3 = O (fixed).
- R must be in the word, but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 3 → R must be in position 4 or 5.
- Forbidden letters: A, S, E, U, N, D, B, I, L.

Still need to test common letters: T, C, M, P, F, G, H, K, Y, etc.

Possible patterns:
- _ _ O R _   (R in 4)
- _ _ O _ R   (R in 5)

Let’s look for 5-letter words that fit one of these patterns, use only allowed letters, and introduce new common letters.

For _ _ O R _:
- Possible: FROTH (but H is okay, T is okay, F is okay, but O is 3, R is 4, H is 5)
- Check letters: F, R, O, T, H – none forbidden. Good.

For _ _ O _ R:
- Possible: MORTY (but Y is okay, M, O, R, T – but T is okay, but M is okay)
- Check letters: M, O, R, T, Y – none forbidden.

Between FROTH and MORTY, both are valid. FROTH uses F, T, H – all common and new.

Let’s pick FROTH.

Known facts:
1. Position 3 is definitely O.
2. R is in the word but cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 4 (from ROUND and FROTH feedback).
   - Therefore R must be in position 5.
3. Forbidden letters so far: A, S, E, U, N, D, B, I, L, F, T.
4. Position 5 must be R.
5. Remaining positions 1, 2, 4 must be filled with letters not yet ruled out.
   Allowed letters (common ones): C, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Pattern so far: _ _ O _ R

We need a valid 5-letter word fitting this pattern, using only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- CORNY (but N is forbidden)
- GORGY (but G twice, Y okay)
- MORPH (but P, H okay, but F is forbidden)
- WORTH (but T is forbidden)
- PORCH (but C, H okay, P, O, R, C, H – C is okay, H is okay)
- HOPOR (not a word)
- MOPAR (but A is forbidden)
- COPRA (but A is forbidden)
- VORRY (not a word)
- CORYR (not a word)
- HORDE (but D, E forbidden)
- GORGE (but E forbidden)
- HORNY (but N forbidden)
- COPRO (not a word)
- MOROR (not a word)
- PORRO (not a word)
- VORON (not a word)
- MOPRA (not a word)
- COPRA (not a word)

The only valid word that fits is ""PORCH"":
- P, O, R, C, H
- All letters are allowed (none in forbidden list)
- Pattern _ _ O _ R → P O R C H → positions: P(1), O(3), R(5), C(4), H(2) – but that would be P H O C R, which is not a word.

Wait, let's list positions correctly:
Word must be: [1] [2] O [4] R

PORCH: P(1), O(3), R(5) – but the word is P-O-R-C-H, which is P(1), O(2), R(3), C(4), H(5) – doesn't fit.

Looking again:
We need _ _ O _ R

Valid words:
- CORNY – N forbidden
- GORGE – E forbidden
- HORDE – D, E forbidden
- MOPAR – A forbidden
- PORCH – doesn't fit pattern
- VORRY – not a word
- COPRA – A forbidden
- MORPH – H, P, M okay, but F is forbidden (MORPH has no F)
Wait, MORPH: M, O, R, P, H – none forbidden, and pattern M O R P H – positions: M(1), O(3), R(5), P(4), H(2) – fits _ _ O _ R.

So MORPH is valid:
- M(1), O(3), R(5)
- P(4), H(2)
- Letters: M, O, R, P, H – none forbidden.

Let's check if any other word is better. Another candidate is ""GOURD"" but D is forbidden.
Another is ""GORY"" but that's 4 letters.
Another is ""GROPE"" but E is forbidden.
Another is ""CROOK"" but O is repeated and K is okay, but O is already in 3, and word would be C R O O K – but O is already in 3, and we don't know about second O, but CROOK is valid, but let's see:
C R O O K – positions: C(1), R(2) – but R cannot be in 2 (from AROSE feedback). So CROOK is invalid.

Thus, MORPH is the best next guess.

A word like ""AROSE"" uses 5 of these high-frequency letters, giving good coverage. However, ""SLATE"" is another strong choice because it includes S, L, A, T, E - which are all very common.\n\nI\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers A, R, O, S, E - five of the most frequent letters in English words, providing a good foundation for subsequent guesses based on the feedback received.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A: x → not in the word\n- R: - → in the word but not in position 2\n- O: ✓ → in the word and in position 3\n- S: x → not in the word\n- E: x → not in the word\n\nSo we know:\n- The word has an O in the 3rd position.\n- It contains an R somewhere other than position 2.\n- It does NOT contain A, S, or E.\n\nTo maximize new information, I want a word that:\n1.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after five guesses.

1. Position 3 is O (✓ from AROSE and confirmed in every guess).
2. R is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 4, or 5 (from BROIL, FROTH, MORPH feedback).
   - Therefore R must be in position 1.
3. Forbidden letters so far: A, S, E, U, N, D, B, I, L, F, T, P.
4. Position 1 must be R (from point 2).
5. Pattern so far: R _ O _ _

We need a valid 5-letter word starting with R, with O in position 3, and using only letters not yet ruled out.

Allowed letters (common ones): C, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible candidates:
- R O _ _ _ with O in 3: R O C K Y, R O G U E (but U is forbidden), R O G O T (not a word), R O C K S (S is forbidden), R O C K Y (Y is allowed), R O K E S (E, S forbidden), R O V E R (E forbidden), R O W E L (E, L forbidden), R O V E R (E forbidden), R O C K Y (valid).

ROCKY:
- R(1), O(3), C(4), K(5), Y(2) – fits pattern R _ O _ _.
- Letters: R, O, C, K, Y – none forbidden.

Another candidate: R O C K S – but S is forbidden.
R O C K Y is the only valid word left.

Let’s verify:
- R is allowed in position 1 (✓ from MORPH feedback).
- O is allowed in position 3 (✓).
- C, K, Y are not forbidden.

Thus, the next guess should be ROCKY.
