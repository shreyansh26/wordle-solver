### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AROSE."" 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), which should provide good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (position 1).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains an A, but not in position 1.
- It does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has an A somewhere other than position 1.
2. Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, B, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A is already used and E, O are out).

Let me try a word like ""TAINT"":
- T, N, I are new letters.
- A is in position 2 (not 1), satisfying the feedback.
- It doesn't use R, O, S, E.

But wait, ""TAINT"" has two Ts and an I, but that might not be optimal. Let me think of a word with more unique letters.

Another option: ""PAINT""
- P, N, I, T are new.
- A in position 2.
- No R, O, S, E.

This seems better as it introduces more new letters.

   - P, I, N are not in the word.
   - A is in position 2 (✓).

So far we know:
- Word must contain A in position 2.
- Word must contain T somewhere other than position 5.
- Word does NOT contain: R, O, S, E, P, I, N.

Remaining letters to consider: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2.
- T somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).
- Only letters from the allowed set.

Let's think of possible words:
- T _ A _ _  (T in position 1)
- _ A T _ _  (T in position 3)
- _ A _ T _  (T in position 4)

Examples:
- T A _ _ _  (T and A in positions 1 and 2) - but A is already fixed in position 2, so this is TA***.
- _ A T _ _  - like BATUM (but U is allowed)
- _ A _ T _  - like CATAM (but M is allowed)

Let's try ""BATUM"":
- B, U, M are new letters.
- A in position 2 (✓).
- T in position 3 (not 5, so ✓).
- No forbidden letters.

But ""BATUM"" might be obscure. Let's try ""GAMUT"":
- G, M, U are new.
- A in position 2 (✓).
- T in position 5 (but feedback says T is not in position 5, so this is invalid).

Next option: ""MAMUT"" - but this has two Ms and T in position 5 (invalid).

Next: ""TAMMY"" - but Y is allowed, but T is in position 1, A in 2, M in 3 and 4, Y in 5. This seems okay, but has repeated M.

Better: ""TALUK"" - but K is allowed, but this might be obscure.

Let's try ""TALUK"" - but not sure.

Another approach: list possible words with A in position 2 and T in 1,3,4.

Possible words:
- T A _ _ _  - like TABBY (but B and Y are allowed)
- _ A T _ _  - like BATON (but N is forbidden)
- _ A _ T _  - like CATAM (but M is allowed)

""TABBY"" seems possible:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

- Only letters from the allowed set.

Let's think of possible words:
- T _ A _ _  (T in position 1)
- _ A T _ _  (T in position 3)
- _ A _ T _  (T in position 4)

Examples:
- T A _ _ _  (T and A in positions 1 and 2) - but A is already fixed in position 2, so this is TA***.
- _ A T _ _  - like BATUM (but U is allowed)
- _ A _ T _  - like CATAM (but M is allowed)

Let's try ""BATUM"":
- B, U, M are new letters.
- A in position 2 (✓).
- T in position 3 (not 5, so ✓).
- No forbidden letters.

But ""BATUM"" might be obscure. Let's try ""GAMUT"":
- G, M, U are new.
- A in position 2 (✓).
- T in position 5 (but feedback says T is not in position 5, so this is invalid).

Next option: ""MAMUT"" - but this has two Ms and T in position 5 (invalid).

Next: ""TAMMY"" - but Y is allowed, but T is in position 1, A in 2, M in 3 and 4, Y in 5. This seems okay, but has repeated M.

Better: ""TALUK"" - but K is allowed, but this might be obscure.

Let's try ""TALUK"" - but not sure.

Another approach: list possible words with A in position 2 and T in 1,3,4.

Possible words:
- T A _ _ _  - like TABBY (but B and Y are allowed)
- _ A T _ _  - like BATON (but N is forbidden)
- _ A _ T _  - like CATAM (but M is allowed)

""TABBY"" seems possible:
- T in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (✓)
- B, B, Y are new letters
- No forbidden letters

But ""TABBY"" has B twice. Let's try ""TACET"" - but E is forbidden.

""TALUK"" - but not common.

Let's try ""TAMMY"" - but Y is allowed.

Actually, let's think of ""TAMMY"" as a valid guess.

But to be more systematic, let's try ""TAMMY"":
- T in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (✓)
- M, M, Y - all allowed
- No forbidden letters

This seems acceptable.

From the new feedback on TAMMY:

- M(x) : M is NOT in the word.
- M(x) : M is NOT in the word.
- Y(✓) : Y is in position 5.

So we now know:
- Word pattern: _ A _ _ Y
- Must contain T somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (since T is not in 1 or 5).
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, P, I, N, M.
- Allowed letters so far: A (fixed in pos 2), T (must be in pos 3 or 4), Y (fixed in pos 5), plus any other letters not forbidden.

Possible positions for T:
- Position 3: _ A T _ Y
- Position 4: _ A _ T Y

We need to fill the remaining blanks with letters not in the forbidden set. Remaining allowed consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z. Vowels left: U (since A and Y are used, and E, O, I are forbidden).

Let's consider:
- _ A T _ Y: Possible first letter (must be consonant) and third letter (must be consonant or U). For example:
  - BATTY (but T is in pos 3, which is allowed)
  - CATTY (but C is allowed)
  - GATTY (but G is allowed)

- _ A _ T Y: Possible first letter and third letter:
  - BACTY (but B, A, C, T, Y - C is allowed)
  - FATTY (but F is allowed)

""BATTY"" seems like a valid word and fits all constraints:
- B (allowed), A (pos 2 ✓), T (pos 3, allowed), T (repeated, but allowed), Y (pos 5 ✓).
- No forbidden letters.

Let's verify:
- Letters in BATTY: B, A, T, T, Y
- Forbidden letters: R, O, S, E, P, I, N, M - none of these are in BATTY.
- T is in pos 3 (not 1 or 5), A in pos 2, Y in pos 5.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AROSE."" 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), which should provide good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (position 1).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains an A, but not in position 1.
- It does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has an A somewhere other than position 1.
2. Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, B, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A is already used and E, O are out).

Let me try a word like ""TAINT"":
- T, N, I are new letters.
- A is in position 2 (not 1), satisfying the feedback.
- It doesn't use R, O, S, E.

But wait, ""TAINT"" has two Ts and an I, but that might not be optimal. Let me think of a word with more unique letters.

Another option: ""PAINT""
- P, N, I, T are new.
- A in position 2.
- No R, O, S, E.

This seems better as it introduces more new letters.

- Word must contain T somewhere other than position 5.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AROSE."" 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), which should provide good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (position 1).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains an A, but not in position 1.
- It does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has an A somewhere other than position 1.
2. Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, B, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A is already used and E, O are out).

Let me try a word like ""TAINT"":
- T, N, I are new letters.
- A is in position 2 (not 1), satisfying the feedback.
- It doesn't use R, O, S, E.

But wait, ""TAINT"" has two Ts and an I, but that might not be optimal. Let me think of a word with more unique letters.

Another option: ""PAINT""
- P, N, I, T are new.
- A in position 2.
- No R, O, S, E.

This seems better as it introduces more new letters.

From the two pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

2. PAINT → P(x) A(✓) I(x) N(x) T(-)
   - P, I, N are not in the word.
   - A is in position 2 (✓).
   - T is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Word must contain A in position 2.
- Word must contain T somewhere other than position 5.
- Word does NOT contain: R, O, S, E, P, I, N.

Remaining letters to consider: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2.
- T somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).
- Only letters from the allowed set.

Let's think of possible words:
- T _ A _ _  (T in position 1)
- _ A T _ _  (T in position 3)
- _ A _ T _  (T in position 4)

Examples:
- T A _ _ _  (T and A in positions 1 and 2) - but A is already fixed in position 2, so this is TA***.
- _ A T _ _  - like BATUM (but U is allowed)
- _ A _ T _  - like CATAM (but M is allowed)

Let's try ""BATUM"":
- B, U, M are new letters.
- A in position 2 (✓).
- T in position 3 (not 5, so ✓).
- No forbidden letters.

But ""BATUM"" might be obscure. Let's try ""GAMUT"":
- G, M, U are new.
- A in position 2 (✓).
- T in position 5 (but feedback says T is not in position 5, so this is invalid).

Next option: ""MAMUT"" - but this has two Ms and T in position 5 (invalid).

Next: ""TAMMY"" - but Y is allowed, but T is in position 1, A in 2, M in 3 and 4, Y in 5. This seems okay, but has repeated M.

Better: ""TALUK"" - but K is allowed, but this might be obscure.

Let's try ""TALUK"" - but not sure.

Another approach: list possible words with A in position 2 and T in 1,3,4.

Possible words:
- T A _ _ _  - like TABBY (but B and Y are allowed)
- _ A T _ _  - like BATON (but N is forbidden)
- _ A _ T _  - like CATAM (but M is allowed)

""TABBY"" seems possible:
- T in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (✓)
- B, B, Y are new letters
- No forbidden letters

But ""TABBY"" has B twice. Let's try ""TACET"" - but E is forbidden.

""TALUK"" - but not common.

Let's try ""TAMMY"" - but Y is allowed.

Actually, let's think of ""TAMMY"" as a valid guess.

But to be more systematic, let's try ""TAMMY"":
- T in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (✓)
- M, M, Y - all allowed
- No forbidden letters

This seems acceptable.

- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, P, I, N, M.
- Allowed letters so far: A (fixed in pos 2), T (must be in pos 3 or 4), Y (fixed in pos 5), plus any other letters not forbidden.

Possible positions for T:
- Position 3: _ A T _ Y
- Position 4: _ A _ T Y

We need to fill the remaining blanks with letters not in the forbidden set. Remaining allowed consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z. Vowels left: U (since A and Y are used, and E, O, I are forbidden).

Let's consider:

  - CATTY (but C is allowed)
  - GATTY (but G is allowed)

- _ A _ T Y: Possible first letter and third letter:
  - BACTY (but B, A, C, T, Y - C is allowed)
  - FATTY (but F is allowed)

""BATTY"" seems like a valid word and fits all constraints:
- B (allowed), A (pos 2 ✓), T (pos 3, allowed), T (repeated, but allowed), Y (pos 5 ✓).
- No forbidden letters.

Let's verify:
- Letters in BATTY: B, A, T, T, Y
- Forbidden letters: R, O, S, E, P, I, N, M - none of these are in BATTY.
- T is in pos 3 (not 1 or 5), A in pos 2, Y in pos 5.

From the feedback on CATTY:
- C(x) : C is NOT in the word.
- A(✓) : A is in position 2 (already known).
- T(✓) : T is in position 3.
- T(✓) : T is in position 4.
- Y(✓) : Y is in position 5.

So the word pattern is still _ A T T Y, and the only remaining unknown is the first letter.  
Letters already eliminated (from all feedback) include: R, O, S, E, P, I, N, M, B, C.  
The remaining possible first letters (consonants not yet ruled out) are: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Common English 5-letter words ending in “ATTY” with the first letter among these remaining consonants are:
- DATTY – not a valid English word.
- FATTY – valid and very common.
- GATTY – not standard.
- HATTY – not standard.
- LATTY – not standard.
- WATTY – not standard.

Thus, the only reasonable candidate left is FATTY.
