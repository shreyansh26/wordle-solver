Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives me a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the word.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better letter frequency distribution for English words.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O, S, E are not in the word at all (x)

So we know:
- The word contains A and R, but not O, S, or E.
- A is not in position 1, and R is not in position 2.

Next, I want to test new consonants and the remaining vowels (I, U) while placing A and R in new positions. A good candidate is ""TRAIN"":
- T is a new consonant.
- R is moved to position 2 (was position 2 in AROSE, so this is a new position).
- A is moved to position 3 (was position 1 in AROSE).
- I is a new vowel.
- N is a new consonant.

This should help narrow down the remaining letters and positions.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

- A (wrong in positions 1 and 3)
- R (wrong in positions 2 and 2 again)

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
O, S, E, T, I, N

B C D F G H J K L M P Q U V W X Y Z

We still need to place A and R somewhere in the 5-letter word.  
A is NOT in positions 1 or 3.  
R is NOT in position 2.

Let’s pick a word that:
- uses A and R in new positions,
- introduces a few new consonants,
- avoids all the eliminated letters.

A good candidate is “CRAMP”:
- C, M, P are new consonants.
- R is in position 2 (but we already know it can’t be in position 2).  
Oops, that violates the R constraint.

Try “DRAPE” – but E is eliminated.

Try “GRAIN” – but I and N are eliminated.

Try “BARKY” – but K and Y are okay, but we need to test A and R positions.

Let’s try “BARKY”:
- B, K, Y are new.
- A is in position 2 (new position).
- R is in position 3 (new position).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives me a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the word.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better letter frequency distribution for English words.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O, S, E are not in the word at all (x)

So we know:
- The word contains A and R, but not O, S, or E.
- A is not in position 1, and R is not in position 2.

Next, I want to test new consonants and the remaining vowels (I, U) while placing A and R in new positions. A good candidate is ""TRAIN"":
- T is a new consonant.
- R is moved to position 2 (was position 2 in AROSE, so this is a new position).
- A is moved to position 3 (was position 1 in AROSE).
- I is a new vowel.
- N is a new consonant.

This should help narrow down the remaining letters and positions.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters that ARE in the word (but still in unknown positions):
- A (wrong in positions 1 and 3)
- R (wrong in positions 2 and 2 again)

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
O, S, E, T, I, N

So the remaining possible letters are:
B C D F G H J K L M P Q U V W X Y Z

We still need to place A and R somewhere in the 5-letter word.  
A is NOT in positions 1 or 3.  
R is NOT in position 2.

Let’s pick a word that:
- uses A and R in new positions,
- introduces a few new consonants,
- avoids all the eliminated letters.

A good candidate is “CRAMP”:
- C, M, P are new consonants.
- R is in position 2 (but we already know it can’t be in position 2).  
Oops, that violates the R constraint.

Try “DRAPE” – but E is eliminated.

Try “GRAIN” – but I and N are eliminated.

Try “BARKY” – but K and Y are okay, but we need to test A and R positions.

Let’s try “BARKY”:
- B, K, Y are new.
- A is in position 2 (new position).
- R is in position 3 (new position).

This satisfies all constraints so far.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives me a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the word.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better letter frequency distribution for English words.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O, S, E are not in the word at all (x)

So we know:
- The word contains A and R, but not O, S, or E.
- A is not in position 1, and R is not in position 2.

Next, I want to test new consonants and the remaining vowels (I, U) while placing A and R in new positions. A good candidate is ""TRAIN"":
- T is a new consonant.
- R is moved to position 2 (was position 2 in AROSE, so this is a new position).
- A is moved to position 3 (was position 1 in AROSE).
- I is a new vowel.
- N is a new consonant.

This should help narrow down the remaining letters and positions.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters that ARE in the word (but still in unknown positions):
- A (wrong in positions 1 and 3)
- R (wrong in positions 2 and 2 again)

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
O, S, E, T, I, N

So the remaining possible letters are:
B C D F G H J K L M P Q U V W X Y Z

We still need to place A and R somewhere in the 5-letter word.  
A is NOT in positions 1 or 3.  
R is NOT in position 2.

Let’s pick a word that:
- uses A and R in new positions,
- introduces a few new consonants,
- avoids all the eliminated letters.

A good candidate is “CRAMP”:
- C, M, P are new consonants.
- R is in position 2 (but we already know it can’t be in position 2).  
Oops, that violates the R constraint.

Try “DRAPE” – but E is eliminated.

Try “GRAIN” – but I and N are eliminated.

Try “BARKY” – but K and Y are okay, but we need to test A and R positions.

Let’s try “BARKY”:
- B, K, Y are new.
- A is in position 2 (new position).
- R is in position 3 (new position).

This satisfies all constraints so far.

Guess 3: BARKY -> FEEDBACK: B(-) A(✓) R(✓) K(x) Y(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the latest feedback:

1. B(-) – B is in the word but not in position 1.
2. A(✓) – A is in position 2 (correct).
3. R(✓) – R is in position 3 (correct).
4. K(x) – K is not in the word.
5. Y(✓) – Y is in position 5 (correct).

So the current known pattern is:
- Position 1: unknown (but not B, not any of O,S,E,T,I,N,K)
- Position 2: A (fixed)
- Position 3: R (fixed)
- Position 4: unknown (not any of O,S,E,T,I,N,K,B)
- Position 5: Y (fixed)

Letters still allowed for positions 1 and 4: from the remaining alphabet excluding O,S,E,T,I,N,K,B. Common remaining letters: C,D,F,G,H,J,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- has A in position 2
- has R in position 3
- has Y in position 5
- has valid letters in positions 1 and 4
- uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Possible candidates:
- C R A _ Y → CRA_Y: CRAZY (Z is allowed)
- D R A _ Y → DR_A_Y: DRAGY (invalid)
- F R A _ Y → FR_A_Y: FRAY_ (needs 5 letters)
- G R A _ Y → GRA_Y: GRAZY (invalid)
- H R A _ Y → HR_A_Y: HRAGY (invalid)
- L R A _ Y → LR_A_Y: LRAGY (invalid)
- M R A _ Y → MR_A_Y: MRAGY (invalid)
- P R A _ Y → PR_A_Y: PRAGY (invalid)
- C R A Z Y → CRAZY (valid word)

CRAZY fits all constraints:
- C in position 1 (allowed)
- R in position 3 (correct)
- A in position 2 (correct)
- Z in position 4 (allowed)
- Y in position 5 (correct)

From the latest feedback:

1. C(✓) – C is in position 1 (correct).
2. R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
3. A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3.
4. Z(x) – Z is not in the word.
5. Y(✓) – Y is in position 5 (correct).

Current known pattern:
- Position 1: C (fixed)
- Position 2: unknown (not R, since R can’t be here)
- Position 3: unknown (not A, since A can’t be here)
- Position 4: unknown
- Position 5: Y (fixed)

Letters eliminated so far: O, S, E, T, I, N, K, Z  
Letters confirmed in word: C (pos 1), A, R, Y (pos 5)

Positions A and R still need to be placed:
- A cannot be in position 3 (from CRAZY feedback) and cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (from earlier feedback), so A must be in position 2 or 4.
- R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE and TRAIN feedback) and cannot be in position 3 (from BARKY feedback), so R must be in position 2 or 4.

But:
- If A is in position 2, then R must be in position 4 (since it can’t be in 2 or 3).
- If A is in position 4, then R must be in position 2 (since it can’t be in 2 or 3).

Let’s test these two possibilities.

Possibility 1: A in position 2, R in position 4
Pattern: C A _ R Y
The missing letter (position 3) must be from remaining allowed letters: D, F, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X (excluding already eliminated letters).
Common consonants: D, F, G, H, L, M, P.
Possible words: CADRY (invalid), CAFRY (invalid), CAGRY (invalid), CAHRY (invalid), CALRY (invalid), CAMRY (valid word).

Possibility 2: A in position 4, R in position 2
Pattern: C R _ A Y
The missing letter (position 3) must be from remaining allowed letters.
Possible words: CRW A Y (invalid), CRU A Y (invalid), CRUAY (invalid), etc. – nothing obvious.

Possibility 1 seems more promising. CAMRY is a valid English word meaning a luxury car.

3. M(x) – M is not in the word.
4. R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 4.
5. Y(✓) – position 5 is correct.

So the pattern is now:
C A _ _ Y
with the remaining letters to fill positions 3 and 4.

Letters we know are in the word: C, A, R, Y  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: O, S, E, T, I, N, K, Z, M

R must be placed in either position 3 or 4 (it cannot be in 2 or 5, and we’ve already ruled out 1 and 4 in previous guesses).

Let’s list valid 5-letter words that fit C A _ _ Y and contain R in position 3 or 4:

- C A R _ Y → CAR_Y: CARBY (invalid), CARRY (valid word, but Y is already in position 5, so this would repeat Y which is not allowed in position 4).
- C A _ R Y → CA_R_Y: CAJRY (invalid), CALRY (invalid), CAPRY (invalid), etc. – nothing valid.

Wait, let’s check C A R R Y – invalid (double R).

Actually, the only valid word that fits C A _ _ Y and includes R is CARRY, but that would have Y in both position 4 and 5, which is impossible since each letter appears only once per word.

Rechecking: the word must be C A _ _ Y with R appearing exactly once in position 3 or 4.

Valid options:
- C A R B Y (invalid, B is allowed but word not common)
- C A R D Y (invalid)
- C A R F Y (invalid)
- C A R G Y (invalid)
- C A R H Y (invalid)
- C A R L Y (invalid)
- C A R P Y (invalid)
- C A R V Y (invalid)

None of these are valid English words. This suggests an error in earlier steps.

Re-examining: the word must be C A _ _ Y with R appearing in position 3 or 4, and using only allowed letters.

Looking at remaining allowed letters for position 3 and 4: D, F, G, H, J, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X (excluding M, etc.)

Possible valid words:
- C A R D Y – invalid
- C A R V Y – invalid
- C A R P Y – invalid
- C A R B Y – invalid
- C A R G Y – invalid

Hmm, none seem valid. Let’s reconsider R placement.

Actually, the word must be C A _ _ Y with R in position 3 or 4.

Looking up valid words: the only common word fitting this is CARRY, but as noted, it would have Y twice.

Wait, let’s list all valid 5-letter words starting with CA and ending with Y:

- CADDY – invalid (no R)
- CAFFE – invalid
- CAGGY – invalid
- CAJUN – invalid
- CALYX – invalid
- CAMBY – invalid
- CANBY – invalid

- CATTY – invalid
- CATSY – invalid
- CAULK – invalid
- CALYX – invalid
- CAVILY – invalid
- CAVITY – invalid
- CAVY – too short

It appears there are no common 5-letter words starting with CA and ending with Y that contain R. This implies an inconsistency, likely due to an error in earlier steps.

Rechecking earlier feedback:
- From CAMRY: R is in the word but not in position 4.
- From CRAZY: R is in the word but not in position 2.
- From BARKY: R is in position 3 (but feedback was R(✓) which was actually position 3 correct, then in CRAZY it was R(-) meaning R is in word but not position 2. This seems conflicting.

Wait, let’s re-examine BARKY feedback:
BARKY -> B(-) A(✓) R(✓) K(x) Y(✓)
This means R is in position 3 (correct), not that it’s in the word but wrong position. So R is fixed in position 3.

Thus the pattern is:
C A R _ Y

Now we need a valid 5-letter word C A R _ Y.

Possible words:
- C A R B Y – invalid
- C A R D Y – invalid
- C A R F Y – invalid
- C A R G Y – invalid
- C A R H Y – invalid
- C A R L Y – invalid
- C A R M Y – invalid (M is eliminated)

- C A R S Y – invalid (S eliminated)
- C A R T Y – invalid (T eliminated)
- C A R V Y – invalid
- C A R W Y – invalid
- C A R Z Y – invalid (Z eliminated)

The only valid word here is CARRY, but it repeats Y which is already in position 5. This suggests the word must be CARRY, despite the double Y.

However, in standard Wordle rules, letters can repeat, and CARRY is a valid word. Given the constraints, CARRY is the only possibility.

Therefore, the next guess is CARRY.

The only valid word here is CARRY, but it repeats Y which is already in position 5. This suggests the word must be CARRY, despite the double Y.

However, in standard Wordle rules, letters can repeat, and CARRY is a valid word. Given the constraints, CARRY is the only possibility.

Therefore, the next guess is CARRY.",Guess 6: CARRY -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) R(-) Y(✓),FAIL
