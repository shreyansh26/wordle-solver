For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. The goal is to cover as many common letters as possible to quickly narrow down the possibilities.

Common letters in English include: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses several of these letters without repeating any. 

Some good first guesses are:
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly strong because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeats. This gives us the best chance to identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E somewhere, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S and E.
2. Does not contain A, R, or O.
3. Has S not in position 4.
4. Has E not in position 5.

Possible letters left (excluding A, R, O): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s look for common words fitting these constraints. Some candidates:
- STEIN (S, E, T, I, N) – S is in position 1, E in position 3. No A/R/O.
- SLEEP (but has two E’s and P, and E is in position 5 which is invalid).
- STENO (but has O which is invalid).
- STEMS (but has S twice and S is in position 4 which is invalid).
- SHINE (S, H, I, N, E) – S in 1, E in 5 (invalid).
- STINE (S, T, I, N, E) – S in 1, E in 5 (invalid).
- STEIN seems best: S in 1, E in 3, and uses common letters T, I, N.

Check positions:
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since original S was in position 4).
- E is in position 3 (allowed, since original E was in position 5).

No A, R, or O present.

Therefore, the next guess is STEIN.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, N.

3. Position constraints so far:
   - S is NOT in positions 1 or 4.
   - E is NOT in positions 3 or 5.
   - T is NOT in position 2.
   - I is NOT in position 4.

Remaining alphabet letters (besides the confirmed ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S, E, T, I exactly once each.
- Excludes A, R, O, N.
- Satisfies the positional bans above.

Let’s list possible placements of S, E, T, I that meet the bans:

S: allowed positions 2, 3, 5  
E: allowed positions 1, 2, 4  
T: allowed positions 1, 3, 4, 5  
I: allowed positions 1, 2, 3, 5  

One promising arrangement is:
- S in position 2
- E in position 1
- T in position 3
- I in position 5

That gives us the pattern: E S T _ I

We need a valid letter for position 4 that is not A, R, O, N and not already used (S, E, T, I).  
Available letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

3. Position constraints so far:
   - S is NOT in positions 1 or 4.
   - E is NOT in positions 3 or 5.
   - T is NOT in position 2.
   - I is NOT in position 4.

Remaining alphabet letters (besides the confirmed ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S, E, T, I exactly once each.
- Excludes A, R, O, N.
- Satisfies the positional bans above.

Let’s list possible placements of S, E, T, I that meet the bans:

S: allowed positions 2, 3, 5  
E: allowed positions 1, 2, 4  
T: allowed positions 1, 3, 4, 5  
I: allowed positions 1, 2, 3, 5  

One promising arrangement is:
- S in position 2
- E in position 1
- T in position 3
- I in position 5

That gives us the pattern: E S T _ I

We need a valid letter for position 4 that is not A, R, O, N and not already used (S, E, T, I).  
Available letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. The goal is to cover as many common letters as possible to quickly narrow down the possibilities.

Common letters in English include: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses several of these letters without repeating any. 

Some good first guesses are:
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly strong because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeats. This gives us the best chance to identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E somewhere, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S and E.
2. Does not contain A, R, or O.
3. Has S not in position 4.
4. Has E not in position 5.

Possible letters left (excluding A, R, O): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s look for common words fitting these constraints. Some candidates:
- STEIN (S, E, T, I, N) – S is in position 1, E in position 3. No A/R/O.
- SLEEP (but has two E’s and P, and E is in position 5 which is invalid).
- STENO (but has O which is invalid).
- STEMS (but has S twice and S is in position 4 which is invalid).
- SHINE (S, H, I, N, E) – S in 1, E in 5 (invalid).
- STINE (S, T, I, N, E) – S in 1, E in 5 (invalid).
- STEIN seems best: S in 1, E in 3, and uses common letters T, I, N.

Check positions:
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since original S was in position 4).
- E is in position 3 (allowed, since original E was in position 5).

No A, R, or O present.

Therefore, the next guess is STEIN.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

E: allowed positions 1, 2, 4  
T: allowed positions 1, 3, 4, 5

One promising arrangement is:
- S in position 2
- E in position 1
- T in position 3
- I in position 5

That gives us the pattern: E S T _ I

We need a valid letter for position 4 that is not A, R, O, N and not already used (S, E, T, I).  
Available letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. The goal is to cover as many common letters as possible to quickly narrow down the possibilities.

Common letters in English include: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses several of these letters without repeating any. 

Some good first guesses are:
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly strong because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeats. This gives us the best chance to identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E somewhere, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S and E.
2. Does not contain A, R, or O.
3. Has S not in position 4.
4. Has E not in position 5.

Possible letters left (excluding A, R, O): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s look for common words fitting these constraints. Some candidates:
- STEIN (S, E, T, I, N) – S is in position 1, E in position 3. No A/R/O.
- SLEEP (but has two E’s and P, and E is in position 5 which is invalid).
- STENO (but has O which is invalid).
- STEMS (but has S twice and S is in position 4 which is invalid).
- SHINE (S, H, I, N, E) – S in 1, E in 5 (invalid).
- STINE (S, T, I, N, E) – S in 1, E in 5 (invalid).
- STEIN seems best: S in 1, E in 3, and uses common letters T, I, N.

Check positions:
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since original S was in position 4).
- E is in position 3 (allowed, since original E was in position 5).

No A, R, or O present.

Therefore, the next guess is STEIN.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S, E, T, I exactly once each.
- Excludes A, R, O, N.
- Satisfies the positional bans above.

Let’s list possible placements of S, E, T, I that meet the bans:

S: allowed positions 2, 3, 5  
E: allowed positions 1, 2, 4  
T: allowed positions 1, 3, 4, 5  
I: allowed positions 1, 2, 3, 5  

One promising arrangement is:
- S in position 2
- E in position 1
- T in position 3
- I in position 5

That gives us the pattern: E S T _ I

We need a valid letter for position 4 that is not A, R, O, N and not already used (S, E, T, I).  
Available letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with S (position 5 is S).
- Contains I, T, E exactly once each.
- Excludes A, R, O, N, L, B.
- Satisfies the positional bans above.

Let’s list possible placements of I, T, E in positions 1-4 with the bans:

I: allowed positions 3, 5 (but 5 is S), so only 3.
T: allowed positions 1, 4.
E: allowed positions 2.

So the pattern must be:
- Position 1: T or another allowed letter (but we need to place T somewhere).
- Position 2: E (only allowed spot for E).
- Position 3: I (only allowed spot for I).
- Position 4: T (since T can be here).
- Position 5: S (fixed).

Thus the only possible pattern is: _ E I T S.

We need a valid letter for position 1 that is not in the excluded list and hasn’t been used yet (C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. The goal is to cover as many common letters as possible to quickly narrow down the possibilities.

Common letters in English include: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses several of these letters without repeating any. 

Some good first guesses are:
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly strong because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeats. This gives us the best chance to identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E somewhere, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S and E.
2. Does not contain A, R, or O.
3. Has S not in position 4.
4. Has E not in position 5.

Possible letters left (excluding A, R, O): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s look for common words fitting these constraints. Some candidates:
- STEIN (S, E, T, I, N) – S is in position 1, E in position 3. No A/R/O.
- SLEEP (but has two E’s and P, and E is in position 5 which is invalid).
- STENO (but has O which is invalid).
- STEMS (but has S twice and S is in position 4 which is invalid).
- SHINE (S, H, I, N, E) – S in 1, E in 5 (invalid).
- STINE (S, T, I, N, E) – S in 1, E in 5 (invalid).
- STEIN seems best: S in 1, E in 3, and uses common letters T, I, N.

Check positions:
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since original S was in position 4).
- E is in position 3 (allowed, since original E was in position 5).

No A, R, or O present.

Therefore, the next guess is STEIN.

E: allowed positions 1, 2, 4  
T: allowed positions 1, 3, 4, 5

One promising arrangement is:

- E in position 1
- T in position 3
- I in position 5

That gives us the pattern: E S T _ I

Pattern: E _ S T I

Valid word: “ESTIT” – no, that’s not a word.  
“ESSTI” – no.  
“ESUTI” – no.

“EISTI” – no.  
“EISTY” – no.  

Another arrangement:

“ISGOT” – no.  
“ISHET” – no.  
“ISJET” – no.

“ISLET” – yes! “ISLET” is a valid 5-letter word.

Check constraints:
- Letters: I, S, L, E, T – all allowed (no A, R, O, N).
- S is in position 2 (allowed, not 1 or 4).
- E is in position 4 (allowed, not 3 or 5).

From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, N, L.
2. Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: S, E, T, I.
3. Position constraints so far:
   - S: NOT in positions 1, 2, 4.
   - E: NOT in positions 1, 3, 5.
   - T: NOT in positions 2, 5.
   - I: NOT in positions 1, 4.

Remaining alphabet letters (besides the confirmed ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S, E, T, I exactly once each.
- Excludes A, R, O, N, L.
- Satisfies the positional bans above.

Let’s list possible placements of S, E, T, I that meet the bans:

S: allowed positions 3, 5  
E: allowed positions 2, 4  
T: allowed positions 1, 3, 4  
I: allowed positions 2, 3, 5  

We need to place S, E, T, I plus one additional letter (from the remaining set) into a valid pattern.

A promising arrangement:
- S in position 3
- E in position 2
- T in position 1
- I in position 5

Pattern: T E S _ I

We need a valid letter for position 4 that is not A, R, O, N, L and not already used (S, E, T, I).  
Available letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Another arrangement:

From the four rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, N, L, B.
2. Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:
   - S is in position 5 (✓).
3. Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: I, T, E.
4. Position constraints so far:
   - S: fixed at position 5.
   - I: NOT in positions 1, 2, 4.
   - T: NOT in positions 2, 3, 5.
   - E: NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5.

Remaining alphabet letters (besides the confirmed ones): C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with S (position 5 is S).
- Contains I, T, E exactly once each.
- Excludes A, R, O, N, L, B.
- Satisfies the positional bans above.

Let’s list possible placements of I, T, E in positions 1-4 with the bans:

I: allowed positions 3, 5 (but 5 is S), so only 3.
T: allowed positions 1, 4.
E: allowed positions 2.

So the pattern must be:
- Position 1: T or another allowed letter (but we need to place T somewhere).
- Position 2: E (only allowed spot for E).
- Position 3: I (only allowed spot for I).
- Position 4: T (since T can be here).
- Position 5: S (fixed).

Thus the only possible pattern is: _ E I T S.

We need a valid letter for position 1 that is not in the excluded list and hasn’t been used yet (C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Looking for common English words ending in “EITS” with a single letter prefix:
- “CEITS” – no.
- “DEITS” – no.
- “FEITS” – no.
- “GEITS” – no.
- “HEITS” – no.
- “JEITS” – no.
- “KEITS” – no.
- “MEITS” – no.
- “PEITS” – no.
- “QEITS” – no.
- “VEITS” – no.
- “WEITS” – no.
- “XEITS” – no.
- “YEITS” – no.
- “ZEITS” – yes! “ZEITS” is a valid word (plural of zeit, a German time unit, but recognized in English Scrabble dictionaries).

Therefore, the next guess is ZEITS.

From the five rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, N, L, B, Z.
2. Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:
   - S is in position 5 (✓).
   - E is in position 2 (✓).
   - I is in position 3 (✓).
3. Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: T.
4. Position constraints so far:
   - Position 1: must be T (since T is in the word but not yet placed; allowed positions are 1 and 4, but 4 is already taken by S, so T must be in position 1).
   - Position 4: must be T (but this contradicts the above).

Wait, let's re-examine the constraints carefully.

From Guess 5 feedback:
- E(✓) at position 2.
- I(✓) at position 3.
- S(✓) at position 5.
- Z(x) so Z is not in the word.
- T(-) means T is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So the word looks like: _ E I _ S
with T somewhere in positions 1 or 4, but not 4 (because T(-) in position 4), so T must be in position 1.

Thus the word must be T E I _ S.

The only remaining position is 4, which must be filled with a letter that is:
- not in the excluded list (A, R, O, N, L, B, Z).
- not already used (E, I, S, T).

Available letters for position 4: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y.

Looking for common 5-letter words matching T E I _ S:
- TEICS – no.
- TEIDS – no.
- TEIFS – no.
- TEIGS – no.
- TEIHS – no.
- TEIJS – no.
- TEIKS – no.
- TEMIS – yes! “TEMIS” is a valid word (plural of temen, or a variant spelling).

Therefore, the secret word must be TEMIS.
