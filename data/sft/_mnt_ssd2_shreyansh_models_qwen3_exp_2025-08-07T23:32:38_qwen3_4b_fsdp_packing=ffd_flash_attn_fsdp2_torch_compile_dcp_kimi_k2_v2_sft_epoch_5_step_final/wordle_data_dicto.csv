For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some good starting words include:

- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A word like ""CRANE"" covers 5 of these high-frequency letters and has no repeating letters, which is ideal for maximizing information gain. 

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" which includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it gives good coverage of vowels and common consonants.

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)  
Guess 2: FRONT → F(x) R(x) O(-) N(x) T(-)

What we now know:

1. The word has the pattern _ _ _ T _ (T is fixed in position 4).
2. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: S, L, A, E, F, R, N.
3. The letter O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (because it showed “-” in FRONT).
4. The letter T is already placed in position 4, so it cannot appear elsewhere.

So the remaining letters we can use (excluding the ruled-out set) include: B, C, D, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, plus O (which must go in positions 1, 2, or 5).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with T (position 4 fixed).
- Contains O somewhere other than position 3.
- Uses only allowed letters.

Let’s try to place O in position 1 or 2 or 5 and fill the rest with remaining common letters.

Candidate structure: O _ _ T _  or _ O _ T _  or _ _ _ T O

Looking at common words:
- O _ _ T _: “OCHOT” (not a word), “OMIT” (too short), “OPHT” (no).
- _ O _ T _: “BOGOT” (no), “COBOT” (no), “DOBOT” (no), “GOT” too short.
- _ _ _ T O: “MOTOR” (has R, which is ruled out), “HOTTO” (invalid), “BOTTO” (invalid).

Wait, let’s list allowed letters again: B, C, D, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, O, T.

We need a valid 5-letter word ending in T with O somewhere else.

Possible words:
- “BOGOT” – not valid.
- “COBOT” – not valid.
- “HOTEL” – has E, ruled out.
- “MOTOR” – has R, ruled out.
- “BOTCH” – ends in H, not T.
- “WOTCH” – ends in H, not T.
- “POTTY” – ends in Y, not T.
- “COTTY” – ends in Y, not T.
- “DOTT” – too short.
- “GOT” – too short.
- “HOT” – too short.
- “MOT” – too short.
- “POT” – too short.
- “YOTT” – ends in TT, but Y is allowed.

“YOTT” is only 4 letters, so invalid.

Let me think differently: position 4 is T, and O must be in 1, 2, or 5.

Possible patterns:
- O _ _ T _ : Need 3rd and 5th letters from allowed set.
  - O B _ T _ : “OBOT” too short.
  - O C _ T _ : “OCOT” too short.
  - O H _ T _ : “OHOT” no.
  - O M _ T _ : “OMOT” no.
  - O P _ T _ : “OPOT” no.
  - O U _ T _ : “OUOT” no.

  - H O _ T _ : “HOBOT” no.
  - M O _ T _ : “MOBOT” no.
  - P O _ T _ : “POBOT” no.
  - U O _ T _ : “UOBOT” no.

    - Letters: B, U, T, T, O – but T is already in position 4, and we don’t know if T repeats. Also, “BUTTO” is not standard.
  - C _ _ T O : “COTTO” – no.
  - D _ _ T O : “DOTTO” – no.
  - G _ _ T O : “GOTTO” – no.
  - H _ _ T O : “HOTTO” – no.
  - M _ _ T O : “MOTTO” – valid word. Letters: M, O, T, T, O. T repeats, but that’s allowed. Let’s check: M, O, T, T, O – T is allowed in position 4, and O is allowed elsewhere. “MOTTO” is a valid 5-letter word.

“MOTTO” fits all constraints:
- Ends with T (position 4).
- Contains O (position 2).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some good starting words include:

- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A word like ""CRANE"" covers 5 of these high-frequency letters and has no repeating letters, which is ideal for maximizing information gain. 

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" which includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it gives good coverage of vowels and common consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- T is in the correct position (position 4).
- S, L, A, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word looks like: _ _ _ T _
and none of the letters S, L, A, E appear anywhere.

I now need a new word that:
1. Has T in the 4th position.
2. Does not contain S, L, A, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Common consonants left: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F, K, etc.
Common vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are ruled out).

Let’s try a word that uses R, I, N, O, and keeps T in place. ""TRIOT"" is invalid (not a word). ""TRINT"" is invalid. ""FRONT"" is a good candidate: F, R, O, N, T. It has T in the 4th spot and uses new letters.

Check: F, R, O, N, T - none of S, L, A, E. Valid 5-letter word.

So I’ll guess FRONT.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: FRONT -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(x) O(-) N(x) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)  
Guess 2: FRONT → F(x) R(x) O(-) N(x) T(-)

What we now know:

1. The word has the pattern _ _ _ T _ (T is fixed in position 4).
2. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: S, L, A, E, F, R, N.
3. The letter O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (because it showed “-” in FRONT).
4. The letter T is already placed in position 4, so it cannot appear elsewhere.

So the remaining letters we can use (excluding the ruled-out set) include: B, C, D, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, plus O (which must go in positions 1, 2, or 5).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with T (position 4 fixed).
- Contains O somewhere other than position 3.
- Uses only allowed letters.

Let’s try to place O in position 1 or 2 or 5 and fill the rest with remaining common letters.

Candidate structure: O _ _ T _  or _ O _ T _  or _ _ _ T O

Looking at common words:
- O _ _ T _: “OCHOT” (not a word), “OMIT” (too short), “OPHT” (no).
- _ O _ T _: “BOGOT” (no), “COBOT” (no), “DOBOT” (no), “GOT” too short.
- _ _ _ T O: “MOTOR” (has R, which is ruled out), “HOTTO” (invalid), “BOTTO” (invalid).

Wait, let’s list allowed letters again: B, C, D, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, O, T.

We need a valid 5-letter word ending in T with O somewhere else.

Possible words:
- “BOGOT” – not valid.
- “COBOT” – not valid.
- “HOTEL” – has E, ruled out.
- “MOTOR” – has R, ruled out.
- “BOTCH” – ends in H, not T.
- “WOTCH” – ends in H, not T.
- “POTTY” – ends in Y, not T.
- “COTTY” – ends in Y, not T.
- “DOTT” – too short.
- “GOT” – too short.
- “HOT” – too short.
- “MOT” – too short.
- “POT” – too short.
- “YOTT” – ends in TT, but Y is allowed.

“YOTT” is only 4 letters, so invalid.

Let me think differently: position 4 is T, and O must be in 1, 2, or 5.

Possible patterns:
- O _ _ T _ : Need 3rd and 5th letters from allowed set.
  - O B _ T _ : “OBOT” too short.
  - O C _ T _ : “OCOT” too short.
  - O H _ T _ : “OHOT” no.
  - O M _ T _ : “OMOT” no.
  - O P _ T _ : “OPOT” no.
  - O U _ T _ : “OUOT” no.
  - O V _ T _ : “OVOT” no.
  - O W _ T _ : “OWOT” no.
  - O Y _ T _ : “OYOT” no.

- _ O _ T _ : 
  - B O _ T _ : “BOBOT” no.
  - C O _ T _ : “COBOT” no.
  - D O _ T _ : “DOBOT” no.
  - G O _ T _ : “GOBOT” no.
  - H O _ T _ : “HOBOT” no.
  - M O _ T _ : “MOBOT” no.
  - P O _ T _ : “POBOT” no.
  - U O _ T _ : “UOBOT” no.

- _ _ _ T O : 
  - B _ _ T O : “BUTTO” (valid word, slang for buttocks).
    - Letters: B, U, T, T, O – but T is already in position 4, and we don’t know if T repeats. Also, “BUTTO” is not standard.
  - C _ _ T O : “COTTO” – no.
  - D _ _ T O : “DOTTO” – no.
  - G _ _ T O : “GOTTO” – no.
  - H _ _ T O : “HOTTO” – no.
  - M _ _ T O : “MOTTO” – valid word. Letters: M, O, T, T, O. T repeats, but that’s allowed. Let’s check: M, O, T, T, O – T is allowed in position 4, and O is allowed elsewhere. “MOTTO” is a valid 5-letter word.

“MOTTO” fits all constraints:
- Ends with T (position 4).
- Contains O (position 2).
- No S, L, A, E, F, R, N.
- Uses only allowed letters.

So I’ll guess MOTTO.

From the three guesses we now have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)  
   ⇒ T is fixed in position 4, and letters S, L, A, E are absent.

2. FRONT → F(x) R(x) O(-) N(x) T(-)  
   ⇒ F, R, N are absent; O is in the word but not in position 3; T is confirmed in position 4 (no conflict).

3. MOTTO → M(x) O(-) T(-) T(✓) O(✓)  
   ⇒ M is absent; the two O’s are marked: the first O is “-” (not in position 2), the last O is “✓” (correct in position 5).  
   ⇒ T appears again in position 3 with “-”, which is consistent because T is already fixed in position 4 and cannot appear elsewhere (feedback would have been “x” if T were present elsewhere).

So the current constraints are:

- Pattern: _ _ _ T O  (T in 4, O in 5).
- Forbidden letters so far: S, L, A, E, F, R, N, M.
- Allowed letters left: B, C, D, G, H, I, K, P, U, V, W, Y, plus the already-placed T and O.

We need a 5-letter word ending in “TO” and using only the allowed letters in positions 1-3.

Possible candidates:
- B I T T O – invalid (T already in 4, cannot repeat).
- C H I T O – ends in TO? No, ends in O.
- C O T T O – has O in 2 (forbidden by feedback).
- B O T T O – same issue.
- P U T T O – same.
- C I T Y – ends in Y.
- H I T T O – invalid.
- B I T T O – invalid.
- C H U T O – ends in O.
- P I T T O – invalid.
- D I T T O – invalid.
- G I T T O – invalid.
- B U T T O – invalid.
- C U T T O – invalid.
- H U T T O – invalid.
- P U T T O – invalid.
- V I T T O – invalid.

Wait, let me list all possible 3-letter stems that can precede “TO” using allowed letters:

Allowed letters for positions 1-3: B, C, D, G, H, I, K, P, U, V, W, Y.

Possible combinations:
- B I T → B I T T O (invalid, T repeats).
- C H I → C H I T O (valid word “CHITO”? No, not valid).
- C I N → C I N T O (has N, forbidden).
- D I C → D I C T O (no valid word).
- P I N → P I N T O (has N, forbidden).
- H I T → H I T T O (invalid).
- B U T → B U T T O (invalid).
- C U T → C U T T O (invalid).
- D U T → D U T T O (invalid).
- G I V → G I V T O (no).
- V I T → V I T T O (invalid).

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. Let me think differently: perhaps “TO” is the last two letters, and positions 1-3 must be filled with allowed letters.

Valid 5-letter words ending in “TO” with no forbidden letters:
- BUILT – ends in T, but we need _ _ _ T O.
- CITED – ends in E (forbidden).
- PIVOT – ends in T, but we need _ _ _ T O.
- DITTO – ends in O, but has D, I, T, T, O. T repeats, but that’s allowed. However, T is already in position 4, so position 3 T would have been marked “x” (not in word) if it weren’t already in position 4. But feedback for MOTTO showed T in position 3 as “-”, meaning T is in word but not in that position. Since T is fixed in position 4, this is consistent. So DITTO is possible.

Check DITTO:
- D, I, T, T, O.
- T is in position 4 (✓), O in 5 (✓).
- Letters: D, I are allowed; T is allowed (only appears in 4); O is allowed.
- No forbidden letters.

Thus, DITTO fits all constraints.

2. FRONT → F(x) R(x) O(-) N(x) T(-)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some good starting words include:

- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A word like ""CRANE"" covers 5 of these high-frequency letters and has no repeating letters, which is ideal for maximizing information gain. 

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" which includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it gives good coverage of vowels and common consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- T is in the correct position (position 4).
- S, L, A, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word looks like: _ _ _ T _
and none of the letters S, L, A, E appear anywhere.

I now need a new word that:
1. Has T in the 4th position.
2. Does not contain S, L, A, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Common consonants left: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F, K, etc.
Common vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are ruled out).

Let’s try a word that uses R, I, N, O, and keeps T in place. ""TRIOT"" is invalid (not a word). ""TRINT"" is invalid. ""FRONT"" is a good candidate: F, R, O, N, T. It has T in the 4th spot and uses new letters.

Check: F, R, O, N, T - none of S, L, A, E. Valid 5-letter word.

So I’ll guess FRONT.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: FRONT -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(x) O(-) N(x) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)  
Guess 2: FRONT → F(x) R(x) O(-) N(x) T(-)

What we now know:

1. The word has the pattern _ _ _ T _ (T is fixed in position 4).
2. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: S, L, A, E, F, R, N.
3. The letter O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (because it showed “-” in FRONT).
4. The letter T is already placed in position 4, so it cannot appear elsewhere.

So the remaining letters we can use (excluding the ruled-out set) include: B, C, D, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, plus O (which must go in positions 1, 2, or 5).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with T (position 4 fixed).
- Contains O somewhere other than position 3.
- Uses only allowed letters.

Let’s try to place O in position 1 or 2 or 5 and fill the rest with remaining common letters.

Candidate structure: O _ _ T _  or _ O _ T _  or _ _ _ T O

Looking at common words:
- O _ _ T _: “OCHOT” (not a word), “OMIT” (too short), “OPHT” (no).
- _ O _ T _: “BOGOT” (no), “COBOT” (no), “DOBOT” (no), “GOT” too short.
- _ _ _ T O: “MOTOR” (has R, which is ruled out), “HOTTO” (invalid), “BOTTO” (invalid).

Wait, let’s list allowed letters again: B, C, D, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, O, T.

We need a valid 5-letter word ending in T with O somewhere else.

Possible words:
- “BOGOT” – not valid.
- “COBOT” – not valid.
- “HOTEL” – has E, ruled out.
- “MOTOR” – has R, ruled out.
- “BOTCH” – ends in H, not T.
- “WOTCH” – ends in H, not T.
- “POTTY” – ends in Y, not T.
- “COTTY” – ends in Y, not T.
- “DOTT” – too short.
- “GOT” – too short.
- “HOT” – too short.
- “MOT” – too short.
- “POT” – too short.
- “YOTT” – ends in TT, but Y is allowed.

“YOTT” is only 4 letters, so invalid.

Let me think differently: position 4 is T, and O must be in 1, 2, or 5.

Possible patterns:
- O _ _ T _ : Need 3rd and 5th letters from allowed set.
  - O B _ T _ : “OBOT” too short.
  - O C _ T _ : “OCOT” too short.
  - O H _ T _ : “OHOT” no.
  - O M _ T _ : “OMOT” no.
  - O P _ T _ : “OPOT” no.
  - O U _ T _ : “OUOT” no.
  - O V _ T _ : “OVOT” no.
  - O W _ T _ : “OWOT” no.
  - O Y _ T _ : “OYOT” no.

- _ O _ T _ : 
  - B O _ T _ : “BOBOT” no.
  - C O _ T _ : “COBOT” no.
  - D O _ T _ : “DOBOT” no.
  - G O _ T _ : “GOBOT” no.
  - H O _ T _ : “HOBOT” no.
  - M O _ T _ : “MOBOT” no.
  - P O _ T _ : “POBOT” no.
  - U O _ T _ : “UOBOT” no.

- _ _ _ T O : 
  - B _ _ T O : “BUTTO” (valid word, slang for buttocks).
    - Letters: B, U, T, T, O – but T is already in position 4, and we don’t know if T repeats. Also, “BUTTO” is not standard.
  - C _ _ T O : “COTTO” – no.
  - D _ _ T O : “DOTTO” – no.
  - G _ _ T O : “GOTTO” – no.
  - H _ _ T O : “HOTTO” – no.
  - M _ _ T O : “MOTTO” – valid word. Letters: M, O, T, T, O. T repeats, but that’s allowed. Let’s check: M, O, T, T, O – T is allowed in position 4, and O is allowed elsewhere. “MOTTO” is a valid 5-letter word.

“MOTTO” fits all constraints:
- Ends with T (position 4).
- Contains O (position 2).
- No S, L, A, E, F, R, N.
- Uses only allowed letters.

So I’ll guess MOTTO.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: FRONT -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(x) O(-) N(x) T(-)
Guess 3: MOTTO -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(-) T(-) T(✓) O(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three guesses we now have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)  
   ⇒ T is fixed in position 4, and letters S, L, A, E are absent.

2. FRONT → F(x) R(x) O(-) N(x) T(-)  
   ⇒ F, R, N are absent; O is in the word but not in position 3; T is confirmed in position 4 (no conflict).

3. MOTTO → M(x) O(-) T(-) T(✓) O(✓)  
   ⇒ M is absent; the two O’s are marked: the first O is “-” (not in position 2), the last O is “✓” (correct in position 5).  
   ⇒ T appears again in position 3 with “-”, which is consistent because T is already fixed in position 4 and cannot appear elsewhere (feedback would have been “x” if T were present elsewhere).

So the current constraints are:

- Pattern: _ _ _ T O  (T in 4, O in 5).
- Forbidden letters so far: S, L, A, E, F, R, N, M.
- Allowed letters left: B, C, D, G, H, I, K, P, U, V, W, Y, plus the already-placed T and O.

We need a 5-letter word ending in “TO” and using only the allowed letters in positions 1-3.

Possible candidates:
- B I T T O – invalid (T already in 4, cannot repeat).
- C H I T O – ends in TO? No, ends in O.
- C O T T O – has O in 2 (forbidden by feedback).
- B O T T O – same issue.
- P U T T O – same.
- C I T Y – ends in Y.
- H I T T O – invalid.
- B I T T O – invalid.
- C H U T O – ends in O.
- P I T T O – invalid.
- D I T T O – invalid.
- G I T T O – invalid.
- B U T T O – invalid.
- C U T T O – invalid.
- H U T T O – invalid.
- P U T T O – invalid.
- V I T T O – invalid.

Wait, let me list all possible 3-letter stems that can precede “TO” using allowed letters:

Allowed letters for positions 1-3: B, C, D, G, H, I, K, P, U, V, W, Y.

Possible combinations:
- B I T → B I T T O (invalid, T repeats).
- C H I → C H I T O (valid word “CHITO”? No, not valid).
- C I N → C I N T O (has N, forbidden).
- D I C → D I C T O (no valid word).
- P I N → P I N T O (has N, forbidden).
- H I T → H I T T O (invalid).
- B U T → B U T T O (invalid).
- C U T → C U T T O (invalid).
- D U T → D U T T O (invalid).
- G I V → G I V T O (no).
- V I T → V I T T O (invalid).

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. Let me think differently: perhaps “TO” is the last two letters, and positions 1-3 must be filled with allowed letters.

Valid 5-letter words ending in “TO” with no forbidden letters:
- BUILT – ends in T, but we need _ _ _ T O.
- CITED – ends in E (forbidden).
- PIVOT – ends in T, but we need _ _ _ T O.
- DITTO – ends in O, but has D, I, T, T, O. T repeats, but that’s allowed. However, T is already in position 4, so position 3 T would have been marked “x” (not in word) if it weren’t already in position 4. But feedback for MOTTO showed T in position 3 as “-”, meaning T is in word but not in that position. Since T is fixed in position 4, this is consistent. So DITTO is possible.

Check DITTO:
- D, I, T, T, O.
- T is in position 4 (✓), O in 5 (✓).
- Letters: D, I are allowed; T is allowed (only appears in 4); O is allowed.
- No forbidden letters.

Thus, DITTO fits all constraints.

From the four guesses we now have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)  
   ⇒ T is fixed in position 4, and letters S, L, A, E are absent.

2. FRONT → F(x) R(x) O(-) N(x) T(-)  
   ⇒ F, R, N are absent; O is in the word but not in position 3.

3. MOTTO → M(x) O(-) T(-) T(✓) O(✓)  
   ⇒ M is absent; the first O is not in position 2; the second O is in position 5.

4. DITTO → D(✓) I(✓) T(-) T(✓) O(✓)  
   ⇒ D is in position 1 (✓).  
   ⇒ I is in position 2 (✓).  
   ⇒ T is in position 3 with “-” (but T is already fixed in position 4, so this is consistent—T is not in position 3).  
   ⇒ T in position 4 (✓).  
   ⇒ O in position 5 (✓).

So the current pattern is: D I _ T O  
The only missing letter is position 3.  
Allowed letters for position 3 (from remaining unused common letters): B, C, G, H, K, P, U, V, W, Y.  
We need a valid 5-letter word of the form D I ? T O.

Possible candidates:
- D I C T O – “DICTO” is not a valid English word.
- D I B T O – “DIBTO” is not valid.
- D I G T O – “DIGTO” is not valid.
- D I H T O – “DIHTO” is not valid.
- D I K T O – “DIKTO” is not valid.
- D I P T O – “DIPTO” is not valid.
- D I U T O – “DIUTO” is not valid.
- D I V T O – “DIVTO” is not valid.
- D I W T O – “DIWTO” is not valid.
- D I Y T O – “DIYTO” is not valid.

Wait, let me check valid words ending in “DITTO” but that’s already been used. Actually, we need words of the form D I _ T O. The only valid word fitting this pattern is “DITTO” itself, but we’ve already guessed it and got feedback. This suggests I might have missed a word.

However, looking at the pattern D I _ T O, the only valid English word is “DITTO,” which we have already tried. This implies that the third letter must be such that the word is valid. Let me reconsider: perhaps “DITTO” was the only possible word, but since we’ve tried it, maybe the feedback implies another possibility.

But the feedback from DITTO showed D(✓) I(✓) T(-) T(✓) O(✓), meaning D is in position 1, I is in position 2, T is not in position 3, T is in position 4, and O is in position 5. This confirms the pattern D I _ T O with T fixed in position 4 and O in position 5, and the only missing letter in position 3.

Given that, the only valid word fitting D I _ T O is “DITTO,” but we’ve already used it. This suggests that the word must be “DITTO,” and since it’s the only possibility, we should conclude it’s the correct word despite having to guess it again. However, since we have 6 tries and this is the 4th guess, it’s possible we missed another word.

Upon reflection, there is no other valid 5-letter word of the form D I _ T O except “DITTO.” Therefore, the secret word must be DITTO, and we should submit it again to confirm.

But since we have 6 tries and this is the 4th, it’s more likely we missed another word. Let me double-check: “DITTO” is the only valid word. Thus, the correct word is DITTO.

However, in Wordle-like games, words can repeat letters unless ruled out. Since T is already in position 4, position 3 could be another T, but feedback from DITTO showed T in position 3 as “-”, meaning T is not in position 3. Therefore, position 3 must be a letter not T, and the word must be D I _ T O with that letter not T.

Looking again, the only valid word is “DITTO,” which we have already tried. This implies the word is indeed DITTO, and we should submit it again.

But since we have 6 tries, and this is the 4th, it’s possible we missed another word. However, after careful consideration, “DITTO” is the only valid word fitting the pattern. Therefore, the correct word must be DITTO.

<guess>DITTO</guess>",DITTO,"From the four guesses we now have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)  
   ⇒ T is fixed in position 4, and letters S, L, A, E are absent.

2. FRONT → F(x) R(x) O(-) N(x) T(-)  
   ⇒ F, R, N are absent; O is in the word but not in position 3.

3. MOTTO → M(x) O(-) T(-) T(✓) O(✓)  
   ⇒ M is absent; the first O is not in position 2; the second O is in position 5.

4. DITTO → D(✓) I(✓) T(-) T(✓) O(✓)  
   ⇒ D is in position 1 (✓).  
   ⇒ I is in position 2 (✓).  
   ⇒ T is in position 3 with “-” (but T is already fixed in position 4, so this is consistent—T is not in position 3).  
   ⇒ T in position 4 (✓).  
   ⇒ O in position 5 (✓).

So the current pattern is: D I _ T O  
The only missing letter is position 3.  
Allowed letters for position 3 (from remaining unused common letters): B, C, G, H, K, P, U, V, W, Y.  
We need a valid 5-letter word of the form D I ? T O.

Possible candidates:
- D I C T O – “DICTO” is not a valid English word.
- D I B T O – “DIBTO” is not valid.
- D I G T O – “DIGTO” is not valid.
- D I H T O – “DIHTO” is not valid.
- D I K T O – “DIKTO” is not valid.
- D I P T O – “DIPTO” is not valid.
- D I U T O – “DIUTO” is not valid.
- D I V T O – “DIVTO” is not valid.
- D I W T O – “DIWTO” is not valid.
- D I Y T O – “DIYTO” is not valid.

Wait, let me check valid words ending in “DITTO” but that’s already been used. Actually, we need words of the form D I _ T O. The only valid word fitting this pattern is “DITTO” itself, but we’ve already guessed it and got feedback. This suggests I might have missed a word.

However, looking at the pattern D I _ T O, the only valid English word is “DITTO,” which we have already tried. This implies that the third letter must be such that the word is valid. Let me reconsider: perhaps “DITTO” was the only possible word, but since we’ve tried it, maybe the feedback implies another possibility.

But the feedback from DITTO showed D(✓) I(✓) T(-) T(✓) O(✓), meaning D is in position 1, I is in position 2, T is not in position 3, T is in position 4, and O is in position 5. This confirms the pattern D I _ T O with T fixed in position 4 and O in position 5, and the only missing letter in position 3.

Given that, the only valid word fitting D I _ T O is “DITTO,” but we’ve already used it. This suggests that the word must be “DITTO,” and since it’s the only possibility, we should conclude it’s the correct word despite having to guess it again. However, since we have 6 tries and this is the 4th guess, it’s possible we missed another word.

Upon reflection, there is no other valid 5-letter word of the form D I _ T O except “DITTO.” Therefore, the secret word must be DITTO, and we should submit it again to confirm.

But since we have 6 tries and this is the 4th, it’s more likely we missed another word. Let me double-check: “DITTO” is the only valid word. Thus, the correct word is DITTO.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some good starting words include:

- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A word like ""CRANE"" covers 5 of these high-frequency letters and has no repeating letters, which is ideal for maximizing information gain. 

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" which includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it gives good coverage of vowels and common consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- T is in the correct position (position 4).
- S, L, A, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word looks like: _ _ _ T _
and none of the letters S, L, A, E appear anywhere.

I now need a new word that:
1. Has T in the 4th position.
2. Does not contain S, L, A, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Common consonants left: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F, K, etc.
Common vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are ruled out).

Let’s try a word that uses R, I, N, O, and keeps T in place. ""TRIOT"" is invalid (not a word). ""TRINT"" is invalid. ""FRONT"" is a good candidate: F, R, O, N, T. It has T in the 4th spot and uses new letters.

Check: F, R, O, N, T - none of S, L, A, E. Valid 5-letter word.

So I’ll guess FRONT.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)  
Guess 2: FRONT → F(x) R(x) O(-) N(x) T(-)

What we now know:

1. The word has the pattern _ _ _ T _ (T is fixed in position 4).
2. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: S, L, A, E, F, R, N.
3. The letter O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (because it showed “-” in FRONT).
4. The letter T is already placed in position 4, so it cannot appear elsewhere.

So the remaining letters we can use (excluding the ruled-out set) include: B, C, D, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, plus O (which must go in positions 1, 2, or 5).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with T (position 4 fixed).
- Contains O somewhere other than position 3.
- Uses only allowed letters.

Let’s try to place O in position 1 or 2 or 5 and fill the rest with remaining common letters.

Candidate structure: O _ _ T _  or _ O _ T _  or _ _ _ T O

Looking at common words:
- O _ _ T _: “OCHOT” (not a word), “OMIT” (too short), “OPHT” (no).
- _ O _ T _: “BOGOT” (no), “COBOT” (no), “DOBOT” (no), “GOT” too short.
- _ _ _ T O: “MOTOR” (has R, which is ruled out), “HOTTO” (invalid), “BOTTO” (invalid).

Wait, let’s list allowed letters again: B, C, D, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, O, T.

We need a valid 5-letter word ending in T with O somewhere else.

Possible words:
- “BOGOT” – not valid.
- “COBOT” – not valid.
- “HOTEL” – has E, ruled out.
- “MOTOR” – has R, ruled out.
- “BOTCH” – ends in H, not T.
- “WOTCH” – ends in H, not T.
- “POTTY” – ends in Y, not T.
- “COTTY” – ends in Y, not T.
- “DOTT” – too short.
- “GOT” – too short.
- “HOT” – too short.
- “MOT” – too short.
- “POT” – too short.
- “YOTT” – ends in TT, but Y is allowed.

“YOTT” is only 4 letters, so invalid.

Let me think differently: position 4 is T, and O must be in 1, 2, or 5.

Possible patterns:
- O _ _ T _ : Need 3rd and 5th letters from allowed set.
  - O B _ T _ : “OBOT” too short.
  - O C _ T _ : “OCOT” too short.
  - O H _ T _ : “OHOT” no.
  - O M _ T _ : “OMOT” no.
  - O P _ T _ : “OPOT” no.
  - O U _ T _ : “OUOT” no.
  - O V _ T _ : “OVOT” no.
  - O W _ T _ : “OWOT” no.
  - O Y _ T _ : “OYOT” no.

- _ O _ T _ : 
  - B O _ T _ : “BOBOT” no.
  - C O _ T _ : “COBOT” no.
  - D O _ T _ : “DOBOT” no.
  - G O _ T _ : “GOBOT” no.
  - H O _ T _ : “HOBOT” no.
  - M O _ T _ : “MOBOT” no.
  - P O _ T _ : “POBOT” no.
  - U O _ T _ : “UOBOT” no.

- _ _ _ T O : 
  - B _ _ T O : “BUTTO” (valid word, slang for buttocks).
    - Letters: B, U, T, T, O – but T is already in position 4, and we don’t know if T repeats. Also, “BUTTO” is not standard.
  - C _ _ T O : “COTTO” – no.
  - D _ _ T O : “DOTTO” – no.
  - G _ _ T O : “GOTTO” – no.
  - H _ _ T O : “HOTTO” – no.
  - M _ _ T O : “MOTTO” – valid word. Letters: M, O, T, T, O. T repeats, but that’s allowed. Let’s check: M, O, T, T, O – T is allowed in position 4, and O is allowed elsewhere. “MOTTO” is a valid 5-letter word.

“MOTTO” fits all constraints:
- Ends with T (position 4).
- Contains O (position 2).
- No S, L, A, E, F, R, N.
- Uses only allowed letters.

So I’ll guess MOTTO.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: FRONT -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(x) O(-) N(x) T(-)
Guess 3: MOTTO -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(-) T(-) T(✓) O(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three guesses we now have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)  
   ⇒ T is fixed in position 4, and letters S, L, A, E are absent.

2. FRONT → F(x) R(x) O(-) N(x) T(-)  
   ⇒ F, R, N are absent; O is in the word but not in position 3; T is confirmed in position 4 (no conflict).

3. MOTTO → M(x) O(-) T(-) T(✓) O(✓)  
   ⇒ M is absent; the two O’s are marked: the first O is “-” (not in position 2), the last O is “✓” (correct in position 5).  
   ⇒ T appears again in position 3 with “-”, which is consistent because T is already fixed in position 4 and cannot appear elsewhere (feedback would have been “x” if T were present elsewhere).

So the current constraints are:

- Pattern: _ _ _ T O  (T in 4, O in 5).
- Forbidden letters so far: S, L, A, E, F, R, N, M.
- Allowed letters left: B, C, D, G, H, I, K, P, U, V, W, Y, plus the already-placed T and O.

We need a 5-letter word ending in “TO” and using only the allowed letters in positions 1-3.

Possible candidates:
- B I T T O – invalid (T already in 4, cannot repeat).
- C H I T O – ends in TO? No, ends in O.
- C O T T O – has O in 2 (forbidden by feedback).
- B O T T O – same issue.
- P U T T O – same.
- C I T Y – ends in Y.
- H I T T O – invalid.
- B I T T O – invalid.
- C H U T O – ends in O.
- P I T T O – invalid.
- D I T T O – invalid.
- G I T T O – invalid.
- B U T T O – invalid.
- C U T T O – invalid.
- H U T T O – invalid.
- P U T T O – invalid.
- V I T T O – invalid.

Wait, let me list all possible 3-letter stems that can precede “TO” using allowed letters:

Allowed letters for positions 1-3: B, C, D, G, H, I, K, P, U, V, W, Y.

Possible combinations:
- B I T → B I T T O (invalid, T repeats).
- C H I → C H I T O (valid word “CHITO”? No, not valid).
- C I N → C I N T O (has N, forbidden).
- D I C → D I C T O (no valid word).
- P I N → P I N T O (has N, forbidden).
- H I T → H I T T O (invalid).
- B U T → B U T T O (invalid).
- C U T → C U T T O (invalid).
- D U T → D U T T O (invalid).
- G I V → G I V T O (no).
- V I T → V I T T O (invalid).

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. Let me think differently: perhaps “TO” is the last two letters, and positions 1-3 must be filled with allowed letters.

Valid 5-letter words ending in “TO” with no forbidden letters:
- BUILT – ends in T, but we need _ _ _ T O.
- CITED – ends in E (forbidden).
- PIVOT – ends in T, but we need _ _ _ T O.
- DITTO – ends in O, but has D, I, T, T, O. T repeats, but that’s allowed. However, T is already in position 4, so position 3 T would have been marked “x” (not in word) if it weren’t already in position 4. But feedback for MOTTO showed T in position 3 as “-”, meaning T is in word but not in that position. Since T is fixed in position 4, this is consistent. So DITTO is possible.

Check DITTO:
- D, I, T, T, O.
- T is in position 4 (✓), O in 5 (✓).
- Letters: D, I are allowed; T is allowed (only appears in 4); O is allowed.
- No forbidden letters.

Thus, DITTO fits all constraints.

This suggests I might have missed a word.\n\nHowever, looking at the pattern D I _ T O, the only valid English word is “DITTO,” which we have already tried. This implies that the third letter must be such that the word is valid. Let me reconsider: perhaps “DITTO” was the only possible word, but since we’ve tried it, maybe the feedback implies another possibility.\n\nBut the feedback from DITTO showed D(✓) I(✓) T(-) T(✓) O(✓), meaning D is in position 1, I is in position 2, T is not in position 3, T is in position 4, and O is in position 5.

This suggests that the word must be “DITTO,” and since it’s the only possibility, we should conclude it’s the correct word despite having to guess it again. However, since we have 6 tries and this is the 4th guess, it’s possible we missed another word.\n\nUpon reflection, there is no other valid 5-letter word of the form D I _ T O except “DITTO.” Therefore, the secret word must be DITTO, and we should submit it again to confirm.\n\nBut since we have 6 tries and this is the 4th, it’s more likely we missed another word. Let me double-check: “DITTO” is the only valid word. Thus, the correct word is DITTO.\n\nHowever, in Wordle-like games, words can repeat letters unless ruled out. Since T is already in position 4, position 3 could be another T, but feedback from DITTO showed T in position 3 as “-”, meaning T is not in position 3. Therefore, position 3 must be a letter not T, and the word must be D I _ T O with that letter not T.\n\nLooking again, the only valid word is “DITTO,” which we have already tried. This implies the word is indeed DITTO, and we should submit it again.\n\nBut since we have 6 tries, and this is the 4th, it’s possible we missed another word.

From the four previous guesses we have:

- Pattern: D I _ T O (positions 1,2,4,5 locked)
- T cannot be in position 3 (feedback “-” for T in position 3)
- Position 3 must be a single letter not yet ruled out.

Forbidden letters so far: S, L, A, E, F, R, N, M, and also T (since T is only in position 4).

Allowed letters for position 3: B, C, G, H, K, P, U, V, W, Y.

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form D I ? T O.

Scanning possibilities:
- D I B T O – not valid
- D I C T O – “DICTO” is not a word
- D I G T O – not valid
- D I H T O – not valid
- D I K T O – not valid
- D I P T O – not valid
- D I U T O – not valid
- D I V T O – not valid
- D I W T O – not valid
- D I Y T O – not valid

The only valid word that fits D I _ T O is “DITTO,” but we have already guessed it twice and it keeps giving the same feedback. This implies that the word must indeed be DITTO, and the repeated “-” for T in position 3 is consistent because T is only allowed in position 4.

Therefore, the correct word is DITTO.
