For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, etc. 

A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these common letters. Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- STARE
- AROSE
- RAISE

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This should give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3).
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5).

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S.
- Letters that ARE in the word: O and E (but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively).

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both O and E.
2. Does not contain A, R, or S.
3. Places O somewhere other than position 3 and E somewhere other than position 5.

Possible positions for O: 1, 2, 4, 5  
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 4  

Let’s try to place O in position 1 and E in position 2, and fill the remaining three slots with other common letters that haven’t been ruled out (avoiding A, R, S). Common remaining letters: T, N, L, I, C, D, etc.

A good candidate: ""O"" + ""E"" + ...  
""O"" ""E"" T _ _  
Possible endings: ""OET__"" – but OET__ isn’t a word.  
Try ""O"" ""T"" ""E"" _ _ – ""OT___"" – ""OTTER"" uses T twice and has no forbidden letters.  
But let’s try a word that spreads the letters better: ""O"" ""N"" ""E"" _ _ – ""ONE__"" – ""ONELY"" isn’t valid.  
Another approach: ""O"" ""T"" ""T"" ""E"" _ – ""OTTE_"" – ""OTTER"" again.  
Try ""O"" ""B"" ""E"" _ _ – ""OBE__"" – ""OBELI"" isn’t valid.  
Try ""O"" ""P"" ""E"" _ _ – ""OPE__"" – ""OPERA"" has A (forbidden).  
Try ""O"" ""U"" ""E"" _ _ – ""OUE__"" – not helpful.  
Try ""E"" ""O"" _ _ _ – ""E"" in position 1, ""O"" in position 2: ""E"" ""O"" _ _ _ – ""EOLID"" isn’t valid.  
Try ""E"" ""T"" ""O"" _ _ – ""ET___"" – ""ETC__"" – ""ETC..."" – ""ETC"" needs more.  
Try ""E"" ""L"" ""O"" _ _ – ""ELO__"" – ""ELOPE"" uses P (allowed), no forbidden letters.  
""ELOPE"" checks:
- Contains E and O.
- E is in position 1 (was in position 5 before, so new position).
- O is in position 3 (was in position 3 before, but feedback said O is in word but wrong position, so position 3 is invalid for O).  
Thus ""ELOPE"" is invalid for O placement.

Next try: ""O"" in position 2, ""E"" in position 3: _ ""O"" ""E"" _ _ – ""COEDS"" has S (forbidden).  
Try ""T"" ""O"" ""E"" _ _ – ""TOE__"" – ""TOEFL"" isn't valid.  
Try ""P"" ""O"" ""E"" _ _ – ""POE__"" – ""POETS"" has S.  
Try ""L"" ""O"" ""E"" _ _ – ""LOE__"" – ""LOES?"" not valid.

""E"" ""T"" ""T"" ""O"" _ – ""ETTO_"" – ""ETTOS"" has S.  
Try ""E"" ""N"" ""T"" ""O"" _ – ""ENTO_"" – ""ENTOM"" – but M is allowed, but ""ENTOM"" isn't a word.  
Try ""E"" ""L"" ""D"" ""O"" _ – ""ELDO_"" – ""ELDON"" – not common.  
Try ""O"" in position 5: _ _ _ _ ""O"" – then E must be in 1-4.

""OTTER"" uses T twice – allowed, since we only know T isn't forbidden.  
Check letters: O, T, T, E, R – R is forbidden (from AROSE feedback).  
Thus ""OTTER"" is invalid due to R.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 3, ""T"" in 4: ""O"" _ ""E"" ""T"" _ – ""OET__"" – ""OETTE"" – not valid.

No forbidden letters (A, R, S).  
O is in position 1 (was in 3 before – ok), E is in position 3 (was in 5 before – ok).  
""ODEON"" is a valid word.  
But let’s see if we can find a better word.

Check letters: B, O, E, U, F – no forbidden letters.  
O is in position 2 (was in 3 – ok), E is in position 3 (was in 5 – ok).  
""BOEUF"" is valid.  
But let’s try a more common word.

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, etc. 

A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these common letters. Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- STARE
- AROSE
- RAISE

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This should give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3).
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5).

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S.
- Letters that ARE in the word: O and E (but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively).

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both O and E.
2. Does not contain A, R, or S.
3. Places O somewhere other than position 3 and E somewhere other than position 5.

Possible positions for O: 1, 2, 4, 5  
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 4  

Let’s try to place O in position 1 and E in position 2, and fill the remaining three slots with other common letters that haven’t been ruled out (avoiding A, R, S). Common remaining letters: T, N, L, I, C, D, etc.

A good candidate: ""O"" + ""E"" + ...  
""O"" ""E"" T _ _  
Possible endings: ""OET__"" – but OET__ isn’t a word.  
Try ""O"" ""T"" ""E"" _ _ – ""OT___"" – ""OTTER"" uses T twice and has no forbidden letters.  
But let’s try a word that spreads the letters better: ""O"" ""N"" ""E"" _ _ – ""ONE__"" – ""ONELY"" isn’t valid.  
Another approach: ""O"" ""T"" ""T"" ""E"" _ – ""OTTE_"" – ""OTTER"" again.  
Try ""O"" ""B"" ""E"" _ _ – ""OBE__"" – ""OBELI"" isn’t valid.  
Try ""O"" ""P"" ""E"" _ _ – ""OPE__"" – ""OPERA"" has A (forbidden).  
Try ""O"" ""U"" ""E"" _ _ – ""OUE__"" – not helpful.  
Try ""E"" ""O"" _ _ _ – ""E"" in position 1, ""O"" in position 2: ""E"" ""O"" _ _ _ – ""EOLID"" isn’t valid.  
Try ""E"" ""T"" ""O"" _ _ – ""ET___"" – ""ETC__"" – ""ETC..."" – ""ETC"" needs more.  
Try ""E"" ""L"" ""O"" _ _ – ""ELO__"" – ""ELOPE"" uses P (allowed), no forbidden letters.  
""ELOPE"" checks:
- Contains E and O.
- E is in position 1 (was in position 5 before, so new position).
- O is in position 3 (was in position 3 before, but feedback said O is in word but wrong position, so position 3 is invalid for O).  
Thus ""ELOPE"" is invalid for O placement.

Next try: ""O"" in position 2, ""E"" in position 3: _ ""O"" ""E"" _ _ – ""COEDS"" has S (forbidden).  
Try ""T"" ""O"" ""E"" _ _ – ""TOE__"" – ""TOEFL"" isn't valid.  
Try ""P"" ""O"" ""E"" _ _ – ""POE__"" – ""POETS"" has S.  
Try ""L"" ""O"" ""E"" _ _ – ""LOE__"" – ""LOES?"" not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 4: _ _ _ ""O"" _ – E must be elsewhere.  
""E"" ""T"" ""T"" ""O"" _ – ""ETTO_"" – ""ETTOS"" has S.  
Try ""E"" ""N"" ""T"" ""O"" _ – ""ENTO_"" – ""ENTOM"" – but M is allowed, but ""ENTOM"" isn't a word.  
Try ""E"" ""L"" ""D"" ""O"" _ – ""ELDO_"" – ""ELDON"" – not common.  
Try ""O"" in position 5: _ _ _ _ ""O"" – then E must be in 1-4.  
""E"" ""L"" ""T"" ""O"" _ – ""ELTO_"" – not valid.  
Try ""E"" ""T"" ""C"" ""O"" _ – ""ETCO_"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 2, ""E"" in position 4: _ ""O"" _ ""E"" _ – ""COEDS"" has S.  
Try ""C"" ""O"" ""T"" ""E"" _ – ""COTE_"" – ""COTES"" has S.  
Try ""D"" ""O"" ""T"" ""E"" _ – ""DOTES"" has S.  
Try ""P"" ""O"" ""T"" ""E"" _ – ""POTES"" has S.  
Try ""B"" ""O"" ""T"" ""E"" _ – ""BOTED"" – not valid.  
Try ""C"" ""O"" ""M"" ""E"" _ – ""COME"" is 4 letters.  
Try ""C"" ""O"" ""V"" ""E"" _ – ""COVE"" is 4 letters.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 2: ""O"" ""E"" _ _ _ – ""OEB__"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 3: ""O"" _ ""E"" _ _ – ""OCEAN"" has A.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 4: ""O"" _ _ ""E"" _ – ""ONELY"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 2: ""O"" ""E"" _ _ _ – ""OEDIP"" – has D, I, P – but ""OEDIP"" isn't valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 2, and common letters: ""O"" ""E"" ""T"" ""T"" ""Y"" – ""OETTY"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 2, ""T"" in 3: ""O"" ""E"" ""T"" _ _ – ""OET__"" – ""OETKI"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 2, ""T"" in 4: ""O"" ""E"" _ ""T"" _ – ""OETT_"" – ""OETTE"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 2, ""T"" in 5: ""O"" ""E"" _ _ ""T"" – ""OEXXT"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 3, ""T"" in 2: ""O"" ""T"" ""E"" _ _ – ""OT___"" – ""OTTER"" – valid word, but O is in position 1 (was in 3 before), E is in position 3 (was in 5 before).  
""OTTER"" uses T twice – allowed, since we only know T isn't forbidden.  
Check letters: O, T, T, E, R – R is forbidden (from AROSE feedback).  
Thus ""OTTER"" is invalid due to R.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 3, ""T"" in 4: ""O"" _ ""E"" ""T"" _ – ""OET__"" – ""OETTE"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 3, ""N"" in 2: ""O"" ""N"" ""E"" _ _ – ""ONE__"" – ""ONELY"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 3, ""D"" in 2: ""O"" ""D"" ""E"" _ _ – ""ODE__"" – ""ODEON"" – has N, valid word.  
Check letters: O, D, E, O, N – O appears twice, but that's allowed.  
No forbidden letters (A, R, S).  
O is in position 1 (was in 3 before – ok), E is in position 3 (was in 5 before – ok).  
""ODEON"" is a valid word.  
But let’s see if we can find a better word.  
Try ""O"" in position 2, ""E"" in position 1: ""E"" ""O"" _ _ _ – ""EOLID"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 2, ""E"" in position 4: _ ""O"" _ ""E"" _ – ""COEDS"" has S.  
Try ""P"" ""O"" _ ""E"" _ – ""POE__"" – ""POETS"" has S.  
Try ""L"" ""O"" _ ""E"" _ – ""LOE__"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 2, ""E"" in position 3: _ ""O"" ""E"" _ _ – ""COEDS"" has S.  
Try ""C"" ""O"" ""E"" _ _ – ""COEDS"" has S.  
Try ""B"" ""O"" ""E"" _ _ – ""BOE__"" – ""BOEUF"" – has F, but F is allowed, but ""BOEUF"" is valid.  
Check letters: B, O, E, U, F – no forbidden letters.  
O is in position 2 (was in 3 – ok), E is in position 3 (was in 5 – ok).  
""BOEUF"" is valid.  
But let’s try a more common word.  
Try ""O"" in position 4, ""E"" in position 2: _ ""E"" _ ""O"" _ – ""CELOM"" – not valid.  
Try ""T"" ""E"" _ ""O"" _ – ""TE___"" – ""TELOS"" has S.  
Try ""P"" ""E"" _ ""O"" _ – ""PE___"" – ""PELOS"" has S.  
Try ""L"" ""E"" _ ""O"" _ – ""LE___"" – ""LEMON"" has M, N – valid word.  
Check letters: L, E, M, O, N – no forbidden letters.  
E is in position 2 (was in 5 – ok), O is in position 4 (was in 3 – ok).  
""LEMON"" is a valid word.  
This seems good.  
Let’s go with ""LEMON"".

Let’s consolidate what we now know after the two guesses.

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S
- Letters IN the word but in wrong positions: O, E

Guess 2: LEMON → L(-) E(-) M(x) O(-) N(-)
- Letters NOT in the word: M (adds to the list)
- Letters IN the word but in wrong positions: L, E, O, N

So the confirmed letters that must appear somewhere in the word are: E, O, L, N  
The forbidden letters so far: A, R, S, M

We now know:
- E is not in position 2 or 5
- O is not in position 3
- L is not in position 1
- N is not in position 5

We still need to place E, O, L, N plus one more letter that hasn’t been ruled out (must be from the remaining common letters: T, I, D, C, U, etc.).

A good strategy is to pick a word that:
1. Contains E, O, L, N
2. Uses only allowed letters
3. Places each of these four letters in a new, still-possible position

Let’s list possible positions for each:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5

E: cannot be 2 or 5 → possible 1,3,4
O: cannot be 3 → possible 1,2,4,5
L: cannot be 1 → possible 2,3,4,5
N: cannot be 5 → possible 1,2,3,4

We need to assign each of E,O,L,N to four different positions and pick one more letter from the remaining pool (T, I, D, C, U, etc.).

Let’s try a concrete arrangement:

Put N in position 1 (allowed), O in position 2 (allowed), L in position 3 (allowed), E in position 4 (allowed), and we need a fifth letter in position 5 that is allowed and hasn’t been used yet. The remaining letters must be from {T, I, D, C, U, ...}.

A common word that fits is “NOLTE” – but that’s not a valid English word.  
Another possibility: “CONEL” – invalid.  
“TONEL” – valid (a cask or barrel).  
“TONEL” uses T, O, N, E, L – all allowed letters, and positions:
- T: new letter, allowed
- O: position 2 (allowed)
- N: position 1 (allowed)
- E: position 4 (allowed)
- L: position 5 (allowed)

“TONEL” is a valid 5-letter English word and fits all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, etc. 

A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these common letters. Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- STARE
- AROSE
- RAISE

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This should give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3).
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5).

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S.
- Letters that ARE in the word: O and E (but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively).

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both O and E.
2. Does not contain A, R, or S.
3. Places O somewhere other than position 3 and E somewhere other than position 5.

Possible positions for O: 1, 2, 4, 5  
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 4  

Let’s try to place O in position 1 and E in position 2, and fill the remaining three slots with other common letters that haven’t been ruled out (avoiding A, R, S). Common remaining letters: T, N, L, I, C, D, etc.

A good candidate: ""O"" + ""E"" + ...  
""O"" ""E"" T _ _  
Possible endings: ""OET__"" – but OET__ isn’t a word.  
Try ""O"" ""T"" ""E"" _ _ – ""OT___"" – ""OTTER"" uses T twice and has no forbidden letters.  
But let’s try a word that spreads the letters better: ""O"" ""N"" ""E"" _ _ – ""ONE__"" – ""ONELY"" isn’t valid.  
Another approach: ""O"" ""T"" ""T"" ""E"" _ – ""OTTE_"" – ""OTTER"" again.  
Try ""O"" ""B"" ""E"" _ _ – ""OBE__"" – ""OBELI"" isn’t valid.  
Try ""O"" ""P"" ""E"" _ _ – ""OPE__"" – ""OPERA"" has A (forbidden).  
Try ""O"" ""U"" ""E"" _ _ – ""OUE__"" – not helpful.  
Try ""E"" ""O"" _ _ _ – ""E"" in position 1, ""O"" in position 2: ""E"" ""O"" _ _ _ – ""EOLID"" isn’t valid.  
Try ""E"" ""T"" ""O"" _ _ – ""ET___"" – ""ETC__"" – ""ETC..."" – ""ETC"" needs more.  
Try ""E"" ""L"" ""O"" _ _ – ""ELO__"" – ""ELOPE"" uses P (allowed), no forbidden letters.  
""ELOPE"" checks:
- Contains E and O.
- E is in position 1 (was in position 5 before, so new position).
- O is in position 3 (was in position 3 before, but feedback said O is in word but wrong position, so position 3 is invalid for O).  
Thus ""ELOPE"" is invalid for O placement.

Next try: ""O"" in position 2, ""E"" in position 3: _ ""O"" ""E"" _ _ – ""COEDS"" has S (forbidden).  
Try ""T"" ""O"" ""E"" _ _ – ""TOE__"" – ""TOEFL"" isn't valid.  
Try ""P"" ""O"" ""E"" _ _ – ""POE__"" – ""POETS"" has S.  
Try ""L"" ""O"" ""E"" _ _ – ""LOE__"" – ""LOES?"" not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 4: _ _ _ ""O"" _ – E must be elsewhere.  
""E"" ""T"" ""T"" ""O"" _ – ""ETTO_"" – ""ETTOS"" has S.  
Try ""E"" ""N"" ""T"" ""O"" _ – ""ENTO_"" – ""ENTOM"" – but M is allowed, but ""ENTOM"" isn't a word.  
Try ""E"" ""L"" ""D"" ""O"" _ – ""ELDO_"" – ""ELDON"" – not common.  
Try ""O"" in position 5: _ _ _ _ ""O"" – then E must be in 1-4.  
""E"" ""L"" ""T"" ""O"" _ – ""ELTO_"" – not valid.  
Try ""E"" ""T"" ""C"" ""O"" _ – ""ETCO_"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 2, ""E"" in position 4: _ ""O"" _ ""E"" _ – ""COEDS"" has S.  
Try ""C"" ""O"" ""T"" ""E"" _ – ""COTE_"" – ""COTES"" has S.  
Try ""D"" ""O"" ""T"" ""E"" _ – ""DOTES"" has S.  
Try ""P"" ""O"" ""T"" ""E"" _ – ""POTES"" has S.  
Try ""B"" ""O"" ""T"" ""E"" _ – ""BOTED"" – not valid.  
Try ""C"" ""O"" ""M"" ""E"" _ – ""COME"" is 4 letters.  
Try ""C"" ""O"" ""V"" ""E"" _ – ""COVE"" is 4 letters.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 2: ""O"" ""E"" _ _ _ – ""OEB__"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 3: ""O"" _ ""E"" _ _ – ""OCEAN"" has A.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 4: ""O"" _ _ ""E"" _ – ""ONELY"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 2: ""O"" ""E"" _ _ _ – ""OEDIP"" – has D, I, P – but ""OEDIP"" isn't valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 2, and common letters: ""O"" ""E"" ""T"" ""T"" ""Y"" – ""OETTY"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 2, ""T"" in 3: ""O"" ""E"" ""T"" _ _ – ""OET__"" – ""OETKI"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 2, ""T"" in 4: ""O"" ""E"" _ ""T"" _ – ""OETT_"" – ""OETTE"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 2, ""T"" in 5: ""O"" ""E"" _ _ ""T"" – ""OEXXT"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 3, ""T"" in 2: ""O"" ""T"" ""E"" _ _ – ""OT___"" – ""OTTER"" – valid word, but O is in position 1 (was in 3 before), E is in position 3 (was in 5 before).  
""OTTER"" uses T twice – allowed, since we only know T isn't forbidden.  
Check letters: O, T, T, E, R – R is forbidden (from AROSE feedback).  
Thus ""OTTER"" is invalid due to R.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 3, ""T"" in 4: ""O"" _ ""E"" ""T"" _ – ""OET__"" – ""OETTE"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 3, ""N"" in 2: ""O"" ""N"" ""E"" _ _ – ""ONE__"" – ""ONELY"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 3, ""D"" in 2: ""O"" ""D"" ""E"" _ _ – ""ODE__"" – ""ODEON"" – has N, valid word.  
Check letters: O, D, E, O, N – O appears twice, but that's allowed.  
No forbidden letters (A, R, S).  
O is in position 1 (was in 3 before – ok), E is in position 3 (was in 5 before – ok).  
""ODEON"" is a valid word.  
But let’s see if we can find a better word.  
Try ""O"" in position 2, ""E"" in position 1: ""E"" ""O"" _ _ _ – ""EOLID"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 2, ""E"" in position 4: _ ""O"" _ ""E"" _ – ""COEDS"" has S.  
Try ""P"" ""O"" _ ""E"" _ – ""POE__"" – ""POETS"" has S.  
Try ""L"" ""O"" _ ""E"" _ – ""LOE__"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 2, ""E"" in position 3: _ ""O"" ""E"" _ _ – ""COEDS"" has S.  
Try ""C"" ""O"" ""E"" _ _ – ""COEDS"" has S.  
Try ""B"" ""O"" ""E"" _ _ – ""BOE__"" – ""BOEUF"" – has F, but F is allowed, but ""BOEUF"" is valid.  
Check letters: B, O, E, U, F – no forbidden letters.  
O is in position 2 (was in 3 – ok), E is in position 3 (was in 5 – ok).  
""BOEUF"" is valid.  
But let’s try a more common word.  
Try ""O"" in position 4, ""E"" in position 2: _ ""E"" _ ""O"" _ – ""CELOM"" – not valid.  
Try ""T"" ""E"" _ ""O"" _ – ""TE___"" – ""TELOS"" has S.  
Try ""P"" ""E"" _ ""O"" _ – ""PE___"" – ""PELOS"" has S.  
Try ""L"" ""E"" _ ""O"" _ – ""LE___"" – ""LEMON"" has M, N – valid word.  
Check letters: L, E, M, O, N – no forbidden letters.  
E is in position 2 (was in 5 – ok), O is in position 4 (was in 3 – ok).  
""LEMON"" is a valid word.  
This seems good.  
Let’s go with ""LEMON"".

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: LEMON -> FEEDBACK: L(-) E(-) M(x) O(-) N(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s consolidate what we now know after the two guesses.

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S
- Letters IN the word but in wrong positions: O, E

Guess 2: LEMON → L(-) E(-) M(x) O(-) N(-)
- Letters NOT in the word: M (adds to the list)
- Letters IN the word but in wrong positions: L, E, O, N

So the confirmed letters that must appear somewhere in the word are: E, O, L, N  
The forbidden letters so far: A, R, S, M

We now know:
- E is not in position 2 or 5
- O is not in position 3
- L is not in position 1
- N is not in position 5

We still need to place E, O, L, N plus one more letter that hasn’t been ruled out (must be from the remaining common letters: T, I, D, C, U, etc.).

A good strategy is to pick a word that:
1. Contains E, O, L, N
2. Uses only allowed letters
3. Places each of these four letters in a new, still-possible position

Let’s list possible positions for each:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5

E: cannot be 2 or 5 → possible 1,3,4
O: cannot be 3 → possible 1,2,4,5
L: cannot be 1 → possible 2,3,4,5
N: cannot be 5 → possible 1,2,3,4

We need to assign each of E,O,L,N to four different positions and pick one more letter from the remaining pool (T, I, D, C, U, etc.).

Let’s try a concrete arrangement:

Put N in position 1 (allowed), O in position 2 (allowed), L in position 3 (allowed), E in position 4 (allowed), and we need a fifth letter in position 5 that is allowed and hasn’t been used yet. The remaining letters must be from {T, I, D, C, U, ...}.

A common word that fits is “NOLTE” – but that’s not a valid English word.  
Another possibility: “CONEL” – invalid.  
“TONEL” – valid (a cask or barrel).  
“TONEL” uses T, O, N, E, L – all allowed letters, and positions:
- T: new letter, allowed
- O: position 2 (allowed)
- N: position 1 (allowed)
- E: position 4 (allowed)
- L: position 5 (allowed)

“TONEL” is a valid 5-letter English word and fits all constraints.

From all feedback so far:

Forbidden letters: A, R, S, M  
Confirmed letters that must appear: E, O, L, N  
Each of E, O, L, N has been shown to be in the word but is currently in the wrong position.

Positions ruled out for each:

E: not 2, 5  
O: not 3  
L: not 1  
N: not 5  

We still need one more letter (since we have 4 letters confirmed).  
Allowed letters left (common ones): I, D, C, U, B, F, G, H, K, P, Y, etc.

We must place E, O, L, N plus one new letter in positions 1-5, respecting the above positional bans.

Let’s list possible positions for each of E, O, L, N:

One efficient way is to pick a word that uses all four confirmed letters plus one new letter, and whose letter placements avoid the banned positions.

Candidate: “OCEAN” – but A is forbidden.

Check positions:

C (new), O (pos 2 – allowed), N (pos 3 – allowed), E (pos 4 – allowed), D (new).  
But we must include L, which is required.  
So “CONED” misses L.

We must include all four confirmed letters: E, O, L, N.

Let’s try “NOBLE” – uses N, O, B, L, E.  
Positions: N(1 – allowed), O(2 – allowed), B(new), L(4 – allowed), E(5 – banned for E).  
E cannot be in 5, so invalid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, etc. 

A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these common letters. Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- STARE
- AROSE
- RAISE

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This should give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3).
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5).

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S.
- Letters that ARE in the word: O and E (but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively).

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both O and E.
2. Does not contain A, R, or S.
3. Places O somewhere other than position 3 and E somewhere other than position 5.

Possible positions for O: 1, 2, 4, 5  
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 4  

Let’s try to place O in position 1 and E in position 2, and fill the remaining three slots with other common letters that haven’t been ruled out (avoiding A, R, S). Common remaining letters: T, N, L, I, C, D, etc.

A good candidate: ""O"" + ""E"" + ...  
""O"" ""E"" T _ _  
Possible endings: ""OET__"" – but OET__ isn’t a word.  
Try ""O"" ""T"" ""E"" _ _ – ""OT___"" – ""OTTER"" uses T twice and has no forbidden letters.  
But let’s try a word that spreads the letters better: ""O"" ""N"" ""E"" _ _ – ""ONE__"" – ""ONELY"" isn’t valid.  
Another approach: ""O"" ""T"" ""T"" ""E"" _ – ""OTTE_"" – ""OTTER"" again.  
Try ""O"" ""B"" ""E"" _ _ – ""OBE__"" – ""OBELI"" isn’t valid.  
Try ""O"" ""P"" ""E"" _ _ – ""OPE__"" – ""OPERA"" has A (forbidden).  
Try ""O"" ""U"" ""E"" _ _ – ""OUE__"" – not helpful.  
Try ""E"" ""O"" _ _ _ – ""E"" in position 1, ""O"" in position 2: ""E"" ""O"" _ _ _ – ""EOLID"" isn’t valid.  
Try ""E"" ""T"" ""O"" _ _ – ""ET___"" – ""ETC__"" – ""ETC..."" – ""ETC"" needs more.  
Try ""E"" ""L"" ""O"" _ _ – ""ELO__"" – ""ELOPE"" uses P (allowed), no forbidden letters.  
""ELOPE"" checks:
- Contains E and O.
- E is in position 1 (was in position 5 before, so new position).
- O is in position 3 (was in position 3 before, but feedback said O is in word but wrong position, so position 3 is invalid for O).  
Thus ""ELOPE"" is invalid for O placement.

Next try: ""O"" in position 2, ""E"" in position 3: _ ""O"" ""E"" _ _ – ""COEDS"" has S (forbidden).  
Try ""T"" ""O"" ""E"" _ _ – ""TOE__"" – ""TOEFL"" isn't valid.  
Try ""P"" ""O"" ""E"" _ _ – ""POE__"" – ""POETS"" has S.  
Try ""L"" ""O"" ""E"" _ _ – ""LOE__"" – ""LOES?"" not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 4: _ _ _ ""O"" _ – E must be elsewhere.  
""E"" ""T"" ""T"" ""O"" _ – ""ETTO_"" – ""ETTOS"" has S.  
Try ""E"" ""N"" ""T"" ""O"" _ – ""ENTO_"" – ""ENTOM"" – but M is allowed, but ""ENTOM"" isn't a word.  
Try ""E"" ""L"" ""D"" ""O"" _ – ""ELDO_"" – ""ELDON"" – not common.  
Try ""O"" in position 5: _ _ _ _ ""O"" – then E must be in 1-4.  
""E"" ""L"" ""T"" ""O"" _ – ""ELTO_"" – not valid.  
Try ""E"" ""T"" ""C"" ""O"" _ – ""ETCO_"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 2, ""E"" in position 4: _ ""O"" _ ""E"" _ – ""COEDS"" has S.  
Try ""C"" ""O"" ""T"" ""E"" _ – ""COTE_"" – ""COTES"" has S.  
Try ""D"" ""O"" ""T"" ""E"" _ – ""DOTES"" has S.  
Try ""P"" ""O"" ""T"" ""E"" _ – ""POTES"" has S.  
Try ""B"" ""O"" ""T"" ""E"" _ – ""BOTED"" – not valid.  
Try ""C"" ""O"" ""M"" ""E"" _ – ""COME"" is 4 letters.  
Try ""C"" ""O"" ""V"" ""E"" _ – ""COVE"" is 4 letters.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 2: ""O"" ""E"" _ _ _ – ""OEB__"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 3: ""O"" _ ""E"" _ _ – ""OCEAN"" has A.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 4: ""O"" _ _ ""E"" _ – ""ONELY"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 2: ""O"" ""E"" _ _ _ – ""OEDIP"" – has D, I, P – but ""OEDIP"" isn't valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 2, and common letters: ""O"" ""E"" ""T"" ""T"" ""Y"" – ""OETTY"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 2, ""T"" in 3: ""O"" ""E"" ""T"" _ _ – ""OET__"" – ""OETKI"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 2, ""T"" in 4: ""O"" ""E"" _ ""T"" _ – ""OETT_"" – ""OETTE"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 2, ""T"" in 5: ""O"" ""E"" _ _ ""T"" – ""OEXXT"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 3, ""T"" in 2: ""O"" ""T"" ""E"" _ _ – ""OT___"" – ""OTTER"" – valid word, but O is in position 1 (was in 3 before), E is in position 3 (was in 5 before).  
""OTTER"" uses T twice – allowed, since we only know T isn't forbidden.  
Check letters: O, T, T, E, R – R is forbidden (from AROSE feedback).  
Thus ""OTTER"" is invalid due to R.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 3, ""T"" in 4: ""O"" _ ""E"" ""T"" _ – ""OET__"" – ""OETTE"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 3, ""N"" in 2: ""O"" ""N"" ""E"" _ _ – ""ONE__"" – ""ONELY"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 3, ""D"" in 2: ""O"" ""D"" ""E"" _ _ – ""ODE__"" – ""ODEON"" – has N, valid word.  
Check letters: O, D, E, O, N – O appears twice, but that's allowed.  
No forbidden letters (A, R, S).  
O is in position 1 (was in 3 before – ok), E is in position 3 (was in 5 before – ok).  
""ODEON"" is a valid word.  
But let’s see if we can find a better word.  
Try ""O"" in position 2, ""E"" in position 1: ""E"" ""O"" _ _ _ – ""EOLID"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 2, ""E"" in position 4: _ ""O"" _ ""E"" _ – ""COEDS"" has S.  
Try ""P"" ""O"" _ ""E"" _ – ""POE__"" – ""POETS"" has S.  
Try ""L"" ""O"" _ ""E"" _ – ""LOE__"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 2, ""E"" in position 3: _ ""O"" ""E"" _ _ – ""COEDS"" has S.  
Try ""C"" ""O"" ""E"" _ _ – ""COEDS"" has S.  
Try ""B"" ""O"" ""E"" _ _ – ""BOE__"" – ""BOEUF"" – has F, but F is allowed, but ""BOEUF"" is valid.  
Check letters: B, O, E, U, F – no forbidden letters.  
O is in position 2 (was in 3 – ok), E is in position 3 (was in 5 – ok).  
""BOEUF"" is valid.  
But let’s try a more common word.  
Try ""O"" in position 4, ""E"" in position 2: _ ""E"" _ ""O"" _ – ""CELOM"" – not valid.  
Try ""T"" ""E"" _ ""O"" _ – ""TE___"" – ""TELOS"" has S.  
Try ""P"" ""E"" _ ""O"" _ – ""PE___"" – ""PELOS"" has S.  
Try ""L"" ""E"" _ ""O"" _ – ""LE___"" – ""LEMON"" has M, N – valid word.  
Check letters: L, E, M, O, N – no forbidden letters.  
E is in position 2 (was in 5 – ok), O is in position 4 (was in 3 – ok).  
""LEMON"" is a valid word.  
This seems good.  
Let’s go with ""LEMON"".

Guess 2: LEMON -> FEEDBACK: L(-) E(-) M(x) O(-) N(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s consolidate what we now know after the two guesses.

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S
- Letters IN the word but in wrong positions: O, E

Guess 2: LEMON → L(-) E(-) M(x) O(-) N(-)
- Letters NOT in the word: M (adds to the list)
- Letters IN the word but in wrong positions: L, E, O, N

So the confirmed letters that must appear somewhere in the word are: E, O, L, N  
The forbidden letters so far: A, R, S, M

We now know:
- E is not in position 2 or 5
- O is not in position 3
- L is not in position 1
- N is not in position 5

We still need to place E, O, L, N plus one more letter that hasn’t been ruled out (must be from the remaining common letters: T, I, D, C, U, etc.).

A good strategy is to pick a word that:
1. Contains E, O, L, N
2. Uses only allowed letters
3. Places each of these four letters in a new, still-possible position

Let’s list possible positions for each:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5

E: cannot be 2 or 5 → possible 1,3,4
O: cannot be 3 → possible 1,2,4,5
L: cannot be 1 → possible 2,3,4,5
N: cannot be 5 → possible 1,2,3,4

We need to assign each of E,O,L,N to four different positions and pick one more letter from the remaining pool (T, I, D, C, U, etc.).

Let’s try a concrete arrangement:

Put N in position 1 (allowed), O in position 2 (allowed), L in position 3 (allowed), E in position 4 (allowed), and we need a fifth letter in position 5 that is allowed and hasn’t been used yet. The remaining letters must be from {T, I, D, C, U, ...}.

A common word that fits is “NOLTE” – but that’s not a valid English word.  
Another possibility: “CONEL” – invalid.  
“TONEL” – valid (a cask or barrel).  
“TONEL” uses T, O, N, E, L – all allowed letters, and positions:
- T: new letter, allowed
- O: position 2 (allowed)
- N: position 1 (allowed)
- E: position 4 (allowed)
- L: position 5 (allowed)

“TONEL” is a valid 5-letter English word and fits all constraints.

E cannot be in 5, so invalid.

Next try: “ONELY” – invalid word.

Try “LONER” – R is forbidden.

Try “ELOND” – invalid.

Try “OLIVE” – uses O, L, I, V, E.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, etc. 

A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these common letters. Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- STARE
- AROSE
- RAISE

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This should give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3).
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5).

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S.
- Letters that ARE in the word: O and E (but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively).

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both O and E.
2. Does not contain A, R, or S.
3. Places O somewhere other than position 3 and E somewhere other than position 5.

Possible positions for O: 1, 2, 4, 5  
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 4  

Let’s try to place O in position 1 and E in position 2, and fill the remaining three slots with other common letters that haven’t been ruled out (avoiding A, R, S). Common remaining letters: T, N, L, I, C, D, etc.

A good candidate: ""O"" + ""E"" + ...  
""O"" ""E"" T _ _  
Possible endings: ""OET__"" – but OET__ isn’t a word.  
Try ""O"" ""T"" ""E"" _ _ – ""OT___"" – ""OTTER"" uses T twice and has no forbidden letters.  
But let’s try a word that spreads the letters better: ""O"" ""N"" ""E"" _ _ – ""ONE__"" – ""ONELY"" isn’t valid.  
Another approach: ""O"" ""T"" ""T"" ""E"" _ – ""OTTE_"" – ""OTTER"" again.  
Try ""O"" ""B"" ""E"" _ _ – ""OBE__"" – ""OBELI"" isn’t valid.  
Try ""O"" ""P"" ""E"" _ _ – ""OPE__"" – ""OPERA"" has A (forbidden).  
Try ""O"" ""U"" ""E"" _ _ – ""OUE__"" – not helpful.  
Try ""E"" ""O"" _ _ _ – ""E"" in position 1, ""O"" in position 2: ""E"" ""O"" _ _ _ – ""EOLID"" isn’t valid.  
Try ""E"" ""T"" ""O"" _ _ – ""ET___"" – ""ETC__"" – ""ETC..."" – ""ETC"" needs more.  
Try ""E"" ""L"" ""O"" _ _ – ""ELO__"" – ""ELOPE"" uses P (allowed), no forbidden letters.  
""ELOPE"" checks:
- Contains E and O.
- E is in position 1 (was in position 5 before, so new position).
- O is in position 3 (was in position 3 before, but feedback said O is in word but wrong position, so position 3 is invalid for O).  
Thus ""ELOPE"" is invalid for O placement.

Next try: ""O"" in position 2, ""E"" in position 3: _ ""O"" ""E"" _ _ – ""COEDS"" has S (forbidden).  
Try ""T"" ""O"" ""E"" _ _ – ""TOE__"" – ""TOEFL"" isn't valid.  
Try ""P"" ""O"" ""E"" _ _ – ""POE__"" – ""POETS"" has S.  
Try ""L"" ""O"" ""E"" _ _ – ""LOE__"" – ""LOES?"" not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 4: _ _ _ ""O"" _ – E must be elsewhere.  
""E"" ""T"" ""T"" ""O"" _ – ""ETTO_"" – ""ETTOS"" has S.  
Try ""E"" ""N"" ""T"" ""O"" _ – ""ENTO_"" – ""ENTOM"" – but M is allowed, but ""ENTOM"" isn't a word.  
Try ""E"" ""L"" ""D"" ""O"" _ – ""ELDO_"" – ""ELDON"" – not common.  
Try ""O"" in position 5: _ _ _ _ ""O"" – then E must be in 1-4.  
""E"" ""L"" ""T"" ""O"" _ – ""ELTO_"" – not valid.  
Try ""E"" ""T"" ""C"" ""O"" _ – ""ETCO_"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 2, ""E"" in position 4: _ ""O"" _ ""E"" _ – ""COEDS"" has S.  
Try ""C"" ""O"" ""T"" ""E"" _ – ""COTE_"" – ""COTES"" has S.  
Try ""D"" ""O"" ""T"" ""E"" _ – ""DOTES"" has S.  
Try ""P"" ""O"" ""T"" ""E"" _ – ""POTES"" has S.  
Try ""B"" ""O"" ""T"" ""E"" _ – ""BOTED"" – not valid.  
Try ""C"" ""O"" ""M"" ""E"" _ – ""COME"" is 4 letters.  
Try ""C"" ""O"" ""V"" ""E"" _ – ""COVE"" is 4 letters.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 2: ""O"" ""E"" _ _ _ – ""OEB__"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 3: ""O"" _ ""E"" _ _ – ""OCEAN"" has A.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 4: ""O"" _ _ ""E"" _ – ""ONELY"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 2: ""O"" ""E"" _ _ _ – ""OEDIP"" – has D, I, P – but ""OEDIP"" isn't valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 2, and common letters: ""O"" ""E"" ""T"" ""T"" ""Y"" – ""OETTY"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 2, ""T"" in 3: ""O"" ""E"" ""T"" _ _ – ""OET__"" – ""OETKI"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 2, ""T"" in 4: ""O"" ""E"" _ ""T"" _ – ""OETT_"" – ""OETTE"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 2, ""T"" in 5: ""O"" ""E"" _ _ ""T"" – ""OEXXT"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 3, ""T"" in 2: ""O"" ""T"" ""E"" _ _ – ""OT___"" – ""OTTER"" – valid word, but O is in position 1 (was in 3 before), E is in position 3 (was in 5 before).  
""OTTER"" uses T twice – allowed, since we only know T isn't forbidden.  
Check letters: O, T, T, E, R – R is forbidden (from AROSE feedback).  
Thus ""OTTER"" is invalid due to R.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 3, ""T"" in 4: ""O"" _ ""E"" ""T"" _ – ""OET__"" – ""OETTE"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 3, ""N"" in 2: ""O"" ""N"" ""E"" _ _ – ""ONE__"" – ""ONELY"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 1, ""E"" in position 3, ""D"" in 2: ""O"" ""D"" ""E"" _ _ – ""ODE__"" – ""ODEON"" – has N, valid word.  
Check letters: O, D, E, O, N – O appears twice, but that's allowed.  
No forbidden letters (A, R, S).  
O is in position 1 (was in 3 before – ok), E is in position 3 (was in 5 before – ok).  
""ODEON"" is a valid word.  
But let’s see if we can find a better word.  
Try ""O"" in position 2, ""E"" in position 1: ""E"" ""O"" _ _ _ – ""EOLID"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 2, ""E"" in position 4: _ ""O"" _ ""E"" _ – ""COEDS"" has S.  
Try ""P"" ""O"" _ ""E"" _ – ""POE__"" – ""POETS"" has S.  
Try ""L"" ""O"" _ ""E"" _ – ""LOE__"" – not valid.  
Try ""O"" in position 2, ""E"" in position 3: _ ""O"" ""E"" _ _ – ""COEDS"" has S.  
Try ""C"" ""O"" ""E"" _ _ – ""COEDS"" has S.  
Try ""B"" ""O"" ""E"" _ _ – ""BOE__"" – ""BOEUF"" – has F, but F is allowed, but ""BOEUF"" is valid.  
Check letters: B, O, E, U, F – no forbidden letters.  
O is in position 2 (was in 3 – ok), E is in position 3 (was in 5 – ok).  
""BOEUF"" is valid.  
But let’s try a more common word.  
Try ""O"" in position 4, ""E"" in position 2: _ ""E"" _ ""O"" _ – ""CELOM"" – not valid.  
Try ""T"" ""E"" _ ""O"" _ – ""TE___"" – ""TELOS"" has S.  
Try ""P"" ""E"" _ ""O"" _ – ""PE___"" – ""PELOS"" has S.  
Try ""L"" ""E"" _ ""O"" _ – ""LE___"" – ""LEMON"" has M, N – valid word.  
Check letters: L, E, M, O, N – no forbidden letters.  
E is in position 2 (was in 5 – ok), O is in position 4 (was in 3 – ok).  
""LEMON"" is a valid word.  
This seems good.  
Let’s go with ""LEMON"".

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: LEMON -> FEEDBACK: L(-) E(-) M(x) O(-) N(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s consolidate what we now know after the two guesses.

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S
- Letters IN the word but in wrong positions: O, E

Guess 2: LEMON → L(-) E(-) M(x) O(-) N(-)
- Letters NOT in the word: M (adds to the list)
- Letters IN the word but in wrong positions: L, E, O, N

So the confirmed letters that must appear somewhere in the word are: E, O, L, N  
The forbidden letters so far: A, R, S, M

We now know:
- E is not in position 2 or 5
- O is not in position 3
- L is not in position 1
- N is not in position 5

We still need to place E, O, L, N plus one more letter that hasn’t been ruled out (must be from the remaining common letters: T, I, D, C, U, etc.).

A good strategy is to pick a word that:
1. Contains E, O, L, N
2. Uses only allowed letters
3. Places each of these four letters in a new, still-possible position

Let’s list possible positions for each:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5

E: cannot be 2 or 5 → possible 1,3,4
O: cannot be 3 → possible 1,2,4,5
L: cannot be 1 → possible 2,3,4,5
N: cannot be 5 → possible 1,2,3,4

We need to assign each of E,O,L,N to four different positions and pick one more letter from the remaining pool (T, I, D, C, U, etc.).

Let’s try a concrete arrangement:

Put N in position 1 (allowed), O in position 2 (allowed), L in position 3 (allowed), E in position 4 (allowed), and we need a fifth letter in position 5 that is allowed and hasn’t been used yet. The remaining letters must be from {T, I, D, C, U, ...}.

A common word that fits is “NOLTE” – but that’s not a valid English word.  
Another possibility: “CONEL” – invalid.  
“TONEL” – valid (a cask or barrel).  
“TONEL” uses T, O, N, E, L – all allowed letters, and positions:
- T: new letter, allowed
- O: position 2 (allowed)
- N: position 1 (allowed)
- E: position 4 (allowed)
- L: position 5 (allowed)

“TONEL” is a valid 5-letter English word and fits all constraints.

Guess 3: TONEL -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(-) N(-) E(-) L(-)
<|im_end|>

From all feedback so far:

Forbidden letters: A, R, S, M  
Confirmed letters that must appear: E, O, L, N  
Each of E, O, L, N has been shown to be in the word but is currently in the wrong position.

Positions ruled out for each:

E: not 2, 5  
O: not 3  
L: not 1  
N: not 5  

We still need one more letter (since we have 4 letters confirmed).  
Allowed letters left (common ones): I, D, C, U, B, F, G, H, K, P, Y, etc.

We must place E, O, L, N plus one new letter in positions 1-5, respecting the above positional bans.

Let’s list possible positions for each of E, O, L, N:

E: 1, 3, 4  
O: 1, 2, 4, 5  
L: 2, 3, 4, 5  
N: 1, 2, 3, 4  

We need to assign four different positions to E, O, L, N and pick one extra letter for the remaining spot.

One efficient way is to pick a word that uses all four confirmed letters plus one new letter, and whose letter placements avoid the banned positions.

Candidate: “OCEAN” – but A is forbidden.  
Candidate: “ELBOW” – W is allowed, but we have only 5 letters and must use E,O,L,N plus one new letter.

Let’s try “COLED” – invalid.  
“COBEN” – invalid.  
“PONED” – invalid.  
“CONED” – valid word, uses C, O, N, E, D.

Check positions:

C (new), O (pos 2 – allowed), N (pos 3 – allowed), E (pos 4 – allowed), D (new).  
But we must include L, which is required.  
So “CONED” misses L.

We must include all four confirmed letters: E, O, L, N.

Let’s try “NOBLE” – uses N, O, B, L, E.  
Positions: N(1 – allowed), O(2 – allowed), B(new), L(4 – allowed), E(5 – banned for E).  
E cannot be in 5, so invalid.

Next try: “ONELY” – invalid word.

Try “LONER” – R is forbidden.

Try “ELOND” – invalid.

Try “OLIVE” – uses O, L, I, V, E.  
Missing N.

Try “OCELOT” – too long, and T is allowed but we need 5 letters.

We need a 5-letter word that contains E, O, L, N plus one new letter, and respects the positional bans.

Let’s list possible positions:

We have four letters: E, O, L, N  
We need to place them in four positions, leaving one spot for a new letter.

Let’s try:

Place N in 1 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed), L in 5 (allowed), E in 3 (allowed).  
Then the 4th position needs a new letter.  
Word: N O _ L E → “NOL E _” – need a letter for position 4.  
“N O D L E” → “NODLE” – valid word.

Check letters: N, O, D, L, E – includes all required letters.  
Positions:  
N(1 – allowed), O(2 – allowed), D(new), L(5 – allowed), E(3 – allowed).  
All constraints satisfied.

So “NODLE” is a valid guess.

Next arrangement:

Put E in 1 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed), N in 3 (allowed), L in 5 (allowed), and put a new letter in 4.
