### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses these common letters without repeating any. 

Some good options would be:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid English word. This should give us good coverage for the first guess.

- SALSA (S is already used)  
- SCALD (D is fine)  

The most common valid word fitting S _ A I _ seems to be “SCALD” (C in position 2, D in position 5).  
Another valid word is “SCAMP” (C, M, P).  
Between these, “SCAMP” uses three new letters (C, M, P) and is a common word.

I’ll go with SCAMP.

Pattern check: S C A I M – all letters are allowed, and it’s a valid English word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses these common letters without repeating any. 

Some good options would be:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid English word. This should give us good coverage for the first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is NOT in the word at all.
- O(x): O is NOT in the word at all.
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x): E is NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E
- Letters that ARE in the word (but positions unknown): A, S
- We still need 3 more letters.

Good letters left to try: T, L, N, I, C, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, K, F, Y, W, V, X, Z, J, Q

Since A and S must appear somewhere, let’s try to place them in new positions and fill the remaining three slots with other common letters not yet eliminated.

Possible candidates:
- STAIN (but S is in position 1, which is allowed since we only know S is not in position 4)
- SLANT (S in position 1, A in position 2)
- STAND (S in position 1, A in position 2)
- SAINT (A in position 1, S in position 2)

I’ll choose “STAIN” because it places S in position 1 (new position), A in position 2 (new position), and uses common letters T, I, N that haven’t been eliminated.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E, T, N  
Letters that ARE in the word and their fixed positions:  
- S in position 1  
- A in position 3  
- I in position 4  

So the pattern so far is:  
S _ A I _

We still need a letter for position 2 and a letter for position 5, and they must be from the remaining unused common letters.  
Remaining common letters (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s pick two of the most frequent remaining letters to test.  
Good candidates for position 2: C, D, L, M, P, B  
Good candidates for position 5: C, D, L, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.

A quick scan of common 5-letter words that fit S _ A I _ gives:

- SCAIL (not a valid word)  
- SALTY (T is out)  
- SAILB (not a word)  
- SCAMP (but P is fine)  
- SABIN (B and N, but N is out)  
- SAGGI (not a word)  
- SALLY (L and Y, but Y is fine)  
- SCAMP (C, M, P – all still allowed)  
- SABIN (N is out)  
- SACKS (K and S, but S is already used in position 1)  
- SALSA (S is already used)  
- SCALD (D is fine)  

The most common valid word fitting S _ A I _ seems to be “SCALD” (C in position 2, D in position 5).  
Another valid word is “SCAMP” (C, M, P).  
Between these, “SCAMP” uses three new letters (C, M, P) and is a common word.

I’ll go with SCAMP.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses these common letters without repeating any. 

Some good options would be:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid English word. This should give us good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is NOT in the word at all.
- O(x): O is NOT in the word at all.
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x): E is NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E
- Letters that ARE in the word (but positions unknown): A, S
- We still need 3 more letters.

Good letters left to try: T, L, N, I, C, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, K, F, Y, W, V, X, Z, J, Q

Since A and S must appear somewhere, let’s try to place them in new positions and fill the remaining three slots with other common letters not yet eliminated.

Possible candidates:
- STAIN (but S is in position 1, which is allowed since we only know S is not in position 4)
- SLANT (S in position 1, A in position 2)
- STAND (S in position 1, A in position 2)
- SAINT (A in position 1, S in position 2)

I’ll choose “STAIN” because it places S in position 1 (new position), A in position 2 (new position), and uses common letters T, I, N that haven’t been eliminated.

Guess 2: STAIN -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) A(✓) I(✓) N(x)

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E, T, N  
Letters that ARE in the word and their fixed positions:  
- S in position 1  
- A in position 3  
- I in position 4  

So the pattern so far is:  
S _ A I _

We still need a letter for position 2 and a letter for position 5, and they must be from the remaining unused common letters.  
Remaining common letters (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s pick two of the most frequent remaining letters to test.  
Good candidates for position 2: C, D, L, M, P, B  
Good candidates for position 5: C, D, L, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.

A quick scan of common 5-letter words that fit S _ A I _ gives:

- SCAIL (not a valid word)  
- SALTY (T is out)  
- SAILB (not a word)  
- SCAMP (but P is fine)  
- SABIN (B and N, but N is out)  
- SAGGI (not a word)  
- SALLY (L and Y, but Y is fine)  
- SCAMP (C, M, P – all still allowed)  
- SABIN (N is out)  
- SACKS (K and S, but S is already used in position 1)  
- SALSA (S is already used)  
- SCALD (D is fine)  

The most common valid word fitting S _ A I _ seems to be “SCALD” (C in position 2, D in position 5).  
Another valid word is “SCAMP” (C, M, P).  
Between these, “SCAMP” uses three new letters (C, M, P) and is a common word.

I’ll go with SCAMP.

Pattern check: S C A I M – all letters are allowed, and it’s a valid English word.

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E, T, N, C, M  
Letters that ARE in the word and their fixed positions:  
- S in position 1  
- A in position 3  
- I in position 4  

So the pattern is:  
S _ A I _

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):  
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  

From Guess 3 we also learned:  
- P is in the word but NOT in position 5 (feedback: P(-))  

Therefore P must be in position 2.  
That fixes the pattern as:  
S P A I _

Now we just need a single letter for position 5 from the still-allowed set.  
Common remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, U, V, W, Y  

Valid 5-letter English words fitting S P A I _:

- SPAID (D)  
- SPAIK (K) – not a common word  
- SPAIL (L) – not common  
- SPAIG (G) – not common  
- SPAIV (V) – not a word  
- SPAIB (B) – not a word  

The only common valid word is SPAID.

Check:  
- S (✓) P (new) A (✓) I (✓) D (new)  
- All letters are allowed by current constraints.

So the next guess is SPAID.

Guess 4 was ""SPAI D"" which is 6 characters long (including space), so it's invalid.  
I need to re-express the correct pattern: S P A I _ with a single letter at the end.

Valid 5-letter English words fitting S P A I _ are limited.  
From earlier: SPAID is valid (past tense of ""spay""), but let me check if there's another common word.

- SPAID  
- SPAIK (rare)  
- SPAIL (rare)  

SPAI D was a typo; the correct word is SPAID.  
I'll submit SPAID again as it's the only common valid option.

However, ""SPAI K"" is invalid (K in position 5 is allowed).

SPAID was tried with D (ruled out).  
SPAIG is valid (Scottish for a ridge of hills).
