### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these as possible without repeating letters. 

Looking at these common letters, a strong candidate is ""AROSE"" because it contains A, R, O, S, E - five very common letters. This should give us good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O is NOT in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
- Letters not in the word: A, O
- Letters that ARE in the word: R, S, E
- These letters (R, S, E) are NOT in positions 2, 4, 5 respectively.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R, S, E
2. Does NOT contain A or O
3. Places R somewhere other than position 2
4. Places S somewhere other than position 4
5. Places E somewhere other than position 5

Good candidates should also introduce new common letters to test. Let's try ""TRIES"":
- Contains R, S, E
- T and I are new common letters
- R is in position 3 (not 2)
- S is in position 2 (not 4)
- E is in position 5 (but feedback said E is in the word but not in position 5 - so this is invalid)

Next option: ""REINS""
- Contains R, S, E
- New letters I, N
- R in position 1 (ok, not 2)
- S in position 3 (ok, not 4)
- E in position 2 (ok, not 5)

This seems valid and tests new letters while respecting the constraints.

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 (AROSE):
- A(x)  – A is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Round 2 (REINS):
- R(✓) – R is in the word AND in position 1.
- E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- I(-) – I is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- N(-) – N is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- S(✓) – S is in the word AND in position 5.

Summary of what we now know:
- Letters that are definitely in the word: R (position 1), S (position 5), E (somewhere), I (somewhere), N (somewhere).
- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, O.
- Positions still unknown: 2, 3, 4 (but E, I, N must occupy these without violating their “wrong position” clues).

Specific constraints:
1. Position 1 = R
2. Position 5 = S
3. E is NOT in position 2 or 5 → must be in 3 or 4.
4. I is NOT in position 3 → must be in 2 or 4.
5. N is NOT in position 4 → must be in 2 or 3.

We have three letters (E, I, N) to place in positions 2, 3, 4 with the above restrictions.

Let’s list possible permutations of E, I, N in positions 2-4:

1. E I N  → E in 2 (invalid, E not allowed in 2)
2. E N I  → E in 2 (invalid)
3. I E N  → E in 3 (ok), N in 4 (invalid, N not allowed in 4)
4. I N E  → I in 2 (ok), N in 3 (ok), E in 4 (ok)
5. N E I  → N in 2 (ok), E in 3 (ok), I in 4 (ok)
6. N I E  → N in 2 (ok), I in 3 (invalid, I not allowed in 3)

Valid permutations: I N E and N E I.

Therefore, the two possible patterns are:
- R I N E S
- R N E I S

We need to pick one of these two as the next guess. Since both fit all constraints, either is acceptable. I’ll choose “RINES”.
