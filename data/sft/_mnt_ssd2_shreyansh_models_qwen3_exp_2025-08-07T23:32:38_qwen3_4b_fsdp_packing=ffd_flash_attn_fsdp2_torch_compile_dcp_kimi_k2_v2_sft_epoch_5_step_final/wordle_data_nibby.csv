For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. The best strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. This helps us quickly eliminate or confirm many letters.

Common letters in English include: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, D, U, M, P, Y, W, F, H, G, K, V, B, Z, J, X, Q, L, C, N, S, T, R, E, A, I, O, U.

A good first guess should contain:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to maximize coverage

Some excellent first guesses include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)
- ROATE (covers R, O, A, T, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it includes S, L, A, T, E - covering 5 of the most common letters in English. It also has a good mix of consonants and vowels.

The feedback from SLATE shows that none of the letters S, L, A, T, E are in the secret word at all. This is very useful information because it eliminates 5 of the most common letters in English. 

Now we know:
- The word contains none of S, L, A, T, E.
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels.

Common letters not yet tested: R, I, N, O, U, C, D, M, P, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Use none of the eliminated letters (S, L, A, T, E)
2. Include several of the most common remaining letters
3. Avoid repeating any letters to maximize information gain

Looking at remaining common letters: R, I, N, O, U, C, D, M, P, Y

A strong candidate is ""CRONY"" - it includes C, R, O, N, Y, which are all high-frequency letters not yet tested. However, ""CRONY"" has Y at the end which might be less common. 

Another good option is ""ROUND"" - it includes R, O, U, N, D. This seems even better as it covers more of the top remaining consonants and vowels.

""ROUND"" uses:
- R (very common consonant)
- O (most common vowel)
- U (second most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- D (common consonant)

This gives us a broad coverage of untested letters in one guess.

- U (second most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- D (common consonant)

This gives us a broad coverage of untested letters in one guess.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are **not** in the word at all: S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D  
   (only N is still in play, but it’s in the wrong position).

2. N is in the word but **not** in the 4th position.

3. We still need to test the remaining common letters: C, G, H, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
- Use none of the eliminated letters.
- Place N in a different position (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th) to find its correct spot.
- Include several of the top remaining high-frequency letters.

Candidate words:
- “CHINK” – uses C, H, I, N, K (but N is still in 4th position, so it’s unhelpful).
- “MINCY” – uses M, I, N, C, Y (N in 3rd position, good).
- “PINGY” – uses P, I, N, G, Y (N in 3rd position, good).
- “WINKY” – uses W, I, N, K, Y (N in 3rd position, good).

Among these, “MINCY” gives us M, I, N, C, Y – covering four new high-frequency letters plus N in a new position.

Summary of what we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D, M, C  
   (only I and Y are confirmed to be in the word).

2. Letters that ARE in the word:  
   - I must be in position 2 (because it got ✓ in MINCY).  
   - Y must be somewhere (it got ✓, but we don’t know the exact position yet).  
   - N must be in the word but not in position 3 (it got “-” in both ROUND and MINCY).

3. Remaining positions to fill: 1, 3, 4, 5 (position 2 is fixed as I).

4. Remaining common letters to test: B, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus N (which we know is present but not in position 3).

5. Since N must appear somewhere else, possible positions for N: 1, 4, or 5.

6. We need a word that:
   - Has I in position 2.  
   - Has Y somewhere.  
   - Has N in position 1, 4, or 5.  
   - Uses only letters not yet eliminated (no S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D, M, C).

7. Candidate letters left: B, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus N and Y.

8. Let’s try to build a word:
   - Position 2 is I.  
   - Y could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.  
   - N could be in 1, 4, or 5 (but not 3).  
   - We need two more letters from the remaining pool.

9. One straightforward word that fits:  
   “JINGY” – but J is uncommon and we don’t know about it yet.  
   “PINGY” – P is okay, but we haven’t tested P.  
   “WINKY” – W is okay, but K is okay too.  
   “VINY” – too short.  
   “BINGY” – B is okay.  
   “FINGY” – F is okay.  
   “GINKY” – G is okay.

10. Among these, “WINKY” uses W, I, N, K, Y – all still possible letters, places N in position 3 (but we know N can’t be in 3), so that’s bad.  
    “BINGY” places N in position 3 – also bad.  
    “FINGY” – same issue.  
    “GINKY” – N in 3 – bad.  
    “PINGY” – N in 3 – bad.  
    “JINGY” – N in 3 – bad.  
    “VINY” – too short.  
    “WINDY” – D is eliminated.  
    “WINCY” – C is eliminated.  
    “WINKY” – N in 3 – bad.  
    “WIPNY” – not a word.  
    “WINKY” – K is okay, but N in 3 – bad.

11. Let’s try N in position 1: “NIXY” – too short.  
    “NINNY” – has N twice, but we don’t know if N repeats.  
    “NIXIE” – E is eliminated.  
    “NINNY” – not ideal.

12. Try N in position 4: “BINGY” – N in 3 – bad.  
    “FINGY” – N in 3 – bad.  
    “PINGY” – N in 3 – bad.  
    “WINGY” – N in 3 – bad.  
    “VINGY” – N in 3 – bad.  
    “JINGY” – N in 3 – bad.  
    “DINGY” – D is eliminated.

13. Try N in position 5: “BINGY” – N in 3 – bad.  
    “FINGY” – N in 3 – bad.  
    “PINGY” – N in 3 – bad.  
    “WINGY” – N in 3 – bad.  
    “VINGY” – N in 3 – bad.  
    “JINGY” – N in 3 – bad.  
    “DINGY” – D is eliminated.

14. Realize that in all common 5-letter words with I in position 2 and N somewhere else, N tends to be in positions 1, 4, or 5.  
    Let’s try N in position 1: “NIXY” – too short.  
    “NINNY” – not ideal.  
    “NIXIE” – E eliminated.  
    “NIXON” – O eliminated.  
    “NIBBY” – B twice, but okay.  
    “NIBBY” – has B, I, B, B, Y – but we don’t know about B yet.  
    “NIBBY” is a valid word, uses N in 1, I in 2, B and Y elsewhere.

15. “NIBBY” fits all constraints:
   - I in position 2 (✓).  
   - Y appears (✓).  
   - N in position 1 (not 3, so allowed).  
   - Uses only letters not yet eliminated: N, I, B, Y.  
   - B is a new letter to test.

Therefore, “NIBBY” is a strong next guess.
