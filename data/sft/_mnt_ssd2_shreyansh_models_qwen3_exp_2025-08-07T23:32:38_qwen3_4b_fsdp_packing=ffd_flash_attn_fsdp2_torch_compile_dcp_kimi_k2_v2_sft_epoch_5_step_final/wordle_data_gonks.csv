### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that will give us the most information possible. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps us eliminate many possibilities at once.

Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A classic first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the secret word.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it covers S, L, A, T, E. However, ""AROSE"" is slightly better because it has more unique vowels.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (1st letter) is NOT in the word (x)
- R (2nd letter) is NOT in the word (x)
- O (3rd letter) is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S (4th letter) is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E (5th letter) is NOT in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word contains O and S, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, or E.

Next, I want to test new common consonants and place O and S in different positions. Good consonants to try next are T, L, N, C, D, etc. I'll try to form a word that uses O and S in new positions and adds new common letters.

Possible candidates:
- STONY (S in 1st, O in 3rd) but Y is less common
- SLOTH (but contains H which is less common)
- TONIC (but contains I and C)
- SONIC (but contains I and C)
- STOIC (but contains I and C)
- STOOL (but has two O's which might not be optimal)

A better choice might be ""STOIC"" - it uses S in 1st, T, O, I, C. This tests S in a new position (1st), adds T, I, C which are common, and keeps O but moves it to 3rd (since it was in 3rd before and is wrong position, 4th is new).

But actually, since O was in 3rd and marked wrong position, it can't be in 3rd again. So I should move O to 1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th.

Let me try ""SONIC"" - S in 1st (new), O in 2nd (new), N, I, C. This tests S in 1st, O in 2nd, and adds N, I, C.

But ""SONIC"" might be a bit obscure. A better common word might be ""STONY"" - S in 1st, T, O in 3rd, N, Y. But O was in 3rd before and is wrong position, so 3rd is bad for O.

Let's try ""STOIC"" again - S in 1st, T, O in 3rd, I, C. This is actually good because:
- S is in 1st (new position)
- O is in 3rd (was in 3rd before, but feedback said wrong position, so this is allowed - it just can't be in 3rd again)
Wait, no - the feedback said O is in wrong position (3rd), so O cannot be in 3rd again. So ""STOIC"" is invalid.

Next option: ""SLOTH"" - S in 1st, L, O in 3rd, T, H. Again O in 3rd is invalid.

Try ""SOLID"" - S in 1st, O in 2nd, L, I, D. This is good:
- S in 1st (new)
- O in 2nd (new)

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, E, L, I, D  
2. Letters that ARE in the word: O, S  
   - O is in the word and is in the correct position 2.  
   - S is in the word but not in position 1 or 4 (from AROSE and SOLID feedback).  
   - Therefore S must be in position 3 or 5.

We need a five-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2.  
- Contains S exactly once, and S must be in position 3 or 5.  
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated (no A, R, E, L, I, D).

Let’s list possible patterns:
- _ O S _ _  (S in 3rd)  
- _ O _ _ S  (S in 5th)

Common English words fitting these patterns:
- _ O S _ _ : “BOOST”, “COSMS”, “GOSPE”, “HOSTS”, “MOSHS”, “NOSES”, “POISE”, “ROSES”, “TOSHS”, “WORSE”  
- _ O _ _ S : “CHOPS”, “COBYS”, “COGYS”, “COUPS”, “COVES”, “COZYS”, “COATS”, “COBAS”, “COBLS”, “COBRS”, “COBYS”, “COGYS”, “COUPS”, “COVES”, “COZYS” (but many of these use eliminated letters).

Valid candidates avoiding eliminated letters (A, R, E, L, I, D):
- _ O S _ _ : “BOOST” (B, O, S, T) – but needs 5 letters, so “BOOST” is 5 letters and valid.  
- _ O _ _ S : “CHOPS” (C, H, O, P, S) – all letters allowed.

Between “BOOST” and “CHOPS”, both are valid. “CHOPS” introduces two new common letters (C, H, P), giving more information. So I’ll guess “CHOPS”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that will give us the most information possible. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps us eliminate many possibilities at once.

Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A classic first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the secret word.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it covers S, L, A, T, E. However, ""AROSE"" is slightly better because it has more unique vowels.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (1st letter) is NOT in the word (x)
- R (2nd letter) is NOT in the word (x)
- O (3rd letter) is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S (4th letter) is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E (5th letter) is NOT in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word contains O and S, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, or E.

Next, I want to test new common consonants and place O and S in different positions. Good consonants to try next are T, L, N, C, D, etc. I'll try to form a word that uses O and S in new positions and adds new common letters.

Possible candidates:
- STONY (S in 1st, O in 3rd) but Y is less common
- SLOTH (but contains H which is less common)
- TONIC (but contains I and C)
- SONIC (but contains I and C)
- STOIC (but contains I and C)
- STOOL (but has two O's which might not be optimal)

A better choice might be ""STOIC"" - it uses S in 1st, T, O, I, C. This tests S in a new position (1st), adds T, I, C which are common, and keeps O but moves it to 3rd (since it was in 3rd before and is wrong position, 4th is new).

But actually, since O was in 3rd and marked wrong position, it can't be in 3rd again. So I should move O to 1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th.

Let me try ""SONIC"" - S in 1st (new), O in 2nd (new), N, I, C. This tests S in 1st, O in 2nd, and adds N, I, C.

But ""SONIC"" might be a bit obscure. A better common word might be ""STONY"" - S in 1st, T, O in 3rd, N, Y. But O was in 3rd before and is wrong position, so 3rd is bad for O.

Let's try ""STOIC"" again - S in 1st, T, O in 3rd, I, C. This is actually good because:
- S is in 1st (new position)
- O is in 3rd (was in 3rd before, but feedback said wrong position, so this is allowed - it just can't be in 3rd again)
Wait, no - the feedback said O is in wrong position (3rd), so O cannot be in 3rd again. So ""STOIC"" is invalid.

Next option: ""SLOTH"" - S in 1st, L, O in 3rd, T, H. Again O in 3rd is invalid.

Try ""SOLID"" - S in 1st, O in 2nd, L, I, D. This is good:
- S in 1st (new)
- O in 2nd (new)
- Adds L, I, D which are common

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, E, L, I, D  
2. Letters that ARE in the word: O, S  
   - O is in the word and is in the correct position 2.  
   - S is in the word but not in position 1 or 4 (from AROSE and SOLID feedback).  
   - Therefore S must be in position 3 or 5.

We need a five-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2.  
- Contains S exactly once, and S must be in position 3 or 5.  
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated (no A, R, E, L, I, D).

Let’s list possible patterns:
- _ O S _ _  (S in 3rd)  
- _ O _ _ S  (S in 5th)

Common English words fitting these patterns:
- _ O S _ _ : “BOOST”, “COSMS”, “GOSPE”, “HOSTS”, “MOSHS”, “NOSES”, “POISE”, “ROSES”, “TOSHS”, “WORSE”  
- _ O _ _ S : “CHOPS”, “COBYS”, “COGYS”, “COUPS”, “COVES”, “COZYS”, “COATS”, “COBAS”, “COBLS”, “COBRS”, “COBYS”, “COGYS”, “COUPS”, “COVES”, “COZYS” (but many of these use eliminated letters).

Valid candidates avoiding eliminated letters (A, R, E, L, I, D):
- _ O S _ _ : “BOOST” (B, O, S, T) – but needs 5 letters, so “BOOST” is 5 letters and valid.

- G O _ _ S → “GONYS” (not a word)  
- B O _ _ S → “BOGGS” (not common)  
- B O _ _ S → “BOOTS” is a valid common word and uses allowed letters.

Let’s check “BOOTS”:
B, O, O, T, S  
- O is allowed in positions 2 and 3.  
- S is in position 5 (✓).  
- B, T are not eliminated.

So “BOOTS” fits the pattern and uses only allowed letters.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that will give us the most information possible. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps us eliminate many possibilities at once.

Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A classic first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the secret word.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it covers S, L, A, T, E. However, ""AROSE"" is slightly better because it has more unique vowels.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (1st letter) is NOT in the word (x)
- R (2nd letter) is NOT in the word (x)
- O (3rd letter) is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S (4th letter) is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E (5th letter) is NOT in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word contains O and S, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, or E.

Next, I want to test new common consonants and place O and S in different positions. Good consonants to try next are T, L, N, C, D, etc. I'll try to form a word that uses O and S in new positions and adds new common letters.

Possible candidates:
- STONY (S in 1st, O in 3rd) but Y is less common
- SLOTH (but contains H which is less common)
- TONIC (but contains I and C)
- SONIC (but contains I and C)
- STOIC (but contains I and C)
- STOOL (but has two O's which might not be optimal)

A better choice might be ""STOIC"" - it uses S in 1st, T, O, I, C. This tests S in a new position (1st), adds T, I, C which are common, and keeps O but moves it to 3rd (since it was in 3rd before and is wrong position, 4th is new).

But actually, since O was in 3rd and marked wrong position, it can't be in 3rd again. So I should move O to 1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th.

Let me try ""SONIC"" - S in 1st (new), O in 2nd (new), N, I, C. This tests S in 1st, O in 2nd, and adds N, I, C.

But ""SONIC"" might be a bit obscure. A better common word might be ""STONY"" - S in 1st, T, O in 3rd, N, Y. But O was in 3rd before and is wrong position, so 3rd is bad for O.

Let's try ""STOIC"" again - S in 1st, T, O in 3rd, I, C. This is actually good because:
- S is in 1st (new position)
- O is in 3rd (was in 3rd before, but feedback said wrong position, so this is allowed - it just can't be in 3rd again)
Wait, no - the feedback said O is in wrong position (3rd), so O cannot be in 3rd again. So ""STOIC"" is invalid.

Next option: ""SLOTH"" - S in 1st, L, O in 3rd, T, H. Again O in 3rd is invalid.

Try ""SOLID"" - S in 1st, O in 2nd, L, I, D. This is good:
- S in 1st (new)
- O in 2nd (new)
- Adds L, I, D which are common

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, E, L, I, D  
2. Letters that ARE in the word: O, S  
   - O is in the word and is in the correct position 2.  
   - S is in the word but not in position 1 or 4 (from AROSE and SOLID feedback).  
   - Therefore S must be in position 3 or 5.

We need a five-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2.  
- Contains S exactly once, and S must be in position 3 or 5.  
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated (no A, R, E, L, I, D).

Let’s list possible patterns:
- _ O S _ _  (S in 3rd)  
- _ O _ _ S  (S in 5th)

Common English words fitting these patterns:
- _ O S _ _ : “BOOST”, “COSMS”, “GOSPE”, “HOSTS”, “MOSHS”, “NOSES”, “POISE”, “ROSES”, “TOSHS”, “WORSE”  
- _ O _ _ S : “CHOPS”, “COBYS”, “COGYS”, “COUPS”, “COVES”, “COZYS”, “COATS”, “COBAS”, “COBLS”, “COBRS”, “COBYS”, “COGYS”, “COUPS”, “COVES”, “COZYS” (but many of these use eliminated letters).

Valid candidates avoiding eliminated letters (A, R, E, L, I, D):
- _ O S _ _ : “BOOST” (B, O, S, T) – but needs 5 letters, so “BOOST” is 5 letters and valid.  
- _ O _ _ S : “CHOPS” (C, H, O, P, S) – all letters allowed.

Between “BOOST” and “CHOPS”, both are valid. “CHOPS” introduces two new common letters (C, H, P), giving more information. So I’ll guess “CHOPS”.

Available letters (common ones): B, F, G, J, K, M, N, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Quick scan of possibilities:

- F O _ _ S → “FOGUS” (not common)  
- G O _ _ S → “GOATS” (A is eliminated)

- W O _ _ S → “WORST” (R is eliminated)  
- G O _ _ S → “GONYS” (not a word)  
- B O _ _ S → “BOGGS” (not common)  
- B O _ _ S → “BOOTS” is a valid common word and uses allowed letters.

Let’s check “BOOTS”:
B, O, O, T, S  
- O is allowed in positions 2 and 3.

A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps us eliminate many possibilities at once.\n\nCommon letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A classic first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the secret word.\n\nAnother popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it covers S, L, A, T, E. However, ""AROSE"" is slightly better because it has more unique vowels.\n\nI\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A (1st letter) is NOT in the word (x)\n- R (2nd letter) is NOT in the word (x)\n- O (3rd letter) is in the word but in the wrong position (-)\n- S (4th letter) is in the word but in the wrong position (-)\n- E (5th letter) is NOT in the word (x)\n\nSo we know:\n- The word contains O and S, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.\n- The word does NOT contain A, R, or E.\n\nNext, I want to test new common consonants and place O and S in different positions. Good consonants to try next are T, L, N, C, D, etc. I\'ll try to form a word that uses O and S in new positions and adds new common letters.\n\nPossible candidates:\n- STONY (S in 1st, O in 3rd) but Y is less common\n- SLOTH (but contains H which is less common)\n- TONIC (but contains I and C)\n- SONIC (but contains I and C)\n- STOIC (but contains I and C)\n- STOOL (but has two O\'s which might not be optimal)\n\nA better choice might be ""STOIC"" - it uses S in 1st, T, O, I, C. This tests S in a new position (1st), adds T, I, C which are common, and keeps O but moves it to 3rd (since it was in 3rd before and is wrong position, 4th is new).\n\nBut actually, since O was in 3rd and marked wrong position, it can\'t be in 3rd again. So I should move O to 1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th.\n\nLet me try ""SONIC"" - S in 1st (new), O in 2nd (new), N, I, C. This tests S in 1st, O in 2nd, and adds N, I, C.\n\nBut ""SONIC"" might be a bit obscure. A better common word might be ""STONY"" - S in 1st, T, O in 3rd, N, Y. But O was in 3rd before and is wrong position, so 3rd is bad for O.\n\nLet\'s try ""STOIC"" again - S in 1st, T, O in 3rd, I, C. This is actually good because:\n- S is in 1st (new position)\n- O is in 3rd (was in 3rd before, but feedback said wrong position, so this is allowed - it just can\'t be in 3rd again)\nWait, no - the feedback said O is in wrong position (3rd), so O cannot be in 3rd again. So ""STOIC"" is invalid.\n\nNext option: ""SLOTH"" - S in 1st, L, O in 3rd, T, H. Again O in 3rd is invalid.\n\nTry ""SOLID"" - S in 1st, O in 2nd, L, I, D. This is good:\n- S in 1st (new)\n- O in 2nd (new)\n- Adds L, I, D which are common\n\n<guess>SOLID</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SOLID -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(✓) L(x) I(x) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two rounds of feedback we now know:\n\n1.

From the five rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word:

2. Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:  
   - Position 1: G (✓)  
   - Position 2: O (✓)  
   - Position 5: S (✓)  

3. Additional info:  
   - Position 3: O is in the word but not in position 3 (from GOONS feedback: O(-) in position 3).  
   - Position 4: N is in the word but not in position 4 (from GOONS feedback: N(-) in position 4).

So the pattern is:  
G O _ _ S

We still need two letters for positions 3 and 4, chosen from the remaining alphabet (excluding all eliminated letters: A, R, E, L, I, D, C, H, P, B, T, N).  
Available letters (common ones): F, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want a common 5-letter English word that fits G O _ _ S with these letters.  
Quick scan:

- G O F _ S → “GOFFS” (double F, but F is allowed)  
- G O K _ S → nothing common  
- G O M _ S → “GOMES” (E eliminated), “GOMYS” (not a word)  
- G O V _ S → nothing common  
- G O W _ S → “GOWNS” (N eliminated)  
- G O Y _ S → nothing common  

The only common word left is “GOFFS”, which uses F twice.  
Letters: G, O, F, F, S – all allowed.

So the word must be “GOFFS”.
