### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses several of these common letters without repeating any. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E, which are all very common letters. This will give us good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities quickly based on the feedback.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter S, but NOT in the 4th position (since S was the 4th letter in AROSE and got “-”).
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

We now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S (and not in position 4).
2. Does not contain A, R, O, E.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U, Y (since A and O are out).

Let’s try a word that uses S in a different position and includes other common letters not yet eliminated. A strong candidate is “STING”:
- S is in position 1 (new position).
- T, I, N, G are all still possible letters.
- No A, R, O, E are used.

This should give us fresh information about T, I, N, G and the position of S.

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word (x-marked):
A, R, O, E, I, N, G, B, Y

Letters confirmed IN the word:
- S (wrong positions: 1, 3, 4)
- T (wrong position: 2, correct in position 4)
- U (wrong position: 2)

So the word must contain:
- T in position 4 (✓)
- S somewhere (positions 2 or 5, since 1,3,4 are ruled out)
- U somewhere (positions 1,3,4,5, but 4 is T, so 1,3,5)

Still-allowed letters (not yet ruled out):
C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word with:
- T in position 4
- S in position 2 or 5
- U in position 1, 3, or 5 (and not conflicting with S)
- No forbidden letters

Let’s try S in position 5 and U in position 1:
Structure: U _ S _ T
The middle letter must be from allowed set and not used yet.

Good candidate: “CUSPT” – but that’s not a valid word.

Next option: “FUSIT” – invalid.

Try “LUSTS” – T must be in position 4, so invalid.

Try “DUSTS” – T is in position 4, S in 5, U in 2 – but U is in 2 which is ruled out (from BUSTY feedback, U was in 2 and marked wrong position).

So U cannot be in 2.

Try U in 1 and S in 2:
Structure: U S _ T _
Middle letter must be allowed. Candidate: “USLIT” – but I is forbidden.

“USMUT” – invalid.

“USPOT” – O is forbidden.

“USKEL” – T must be in 4, so invalid.

Try U in 3 and S in 2:
Structure: _ S U T _
Candidate: “FUSIT” – invalid.

“CUSPT” – invalid.

“LUSTS” – T not in 4.

Try U in 5 and S in 2:
Structure: _ S _ T U
Candidate: “FUSIT” – invalid.

“LUSTU” – invalid.

“CUSPT” – invalid.

Try U in 1 and S in 5:
Structure: U _ _ T S
Candidate: “FUGTS” – invalid.

“LUMTS” – invalid.

“LUSTS” – T not in 4.

“LUSTY” – Y is forbidden.

“LUSTS” – T is 4, S is 5, U is 2 – but U in 2 is ruled out.

Wait, let’s re-examine positions:

From BUSTY:
B(x) U(-) S(-) T(✓) Y(x)
- U was in position 2 → wrong position → U not in 2
- S was in position 3 → wrong position → S not in 3
- T is in position 4 (✓)

So S must be in 2 or 5
U must be in 1,3,5 (and not conflicting with S)

Let’s try S in 2 and U in 1:
U S _ T _
Middle letter must be allowed. Candidate: “USLIT” – I is forbidden.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses several of these common letters without repeating any. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E, which are all very common letters. This will give us good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities quickly based on the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter S, but NOT in the 4th position (since S was the 4th letter in AROSE and got “-”).
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

We now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S (and not in position 4).
2. Does not contain A, R, O, E.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U, Y (since A and O are out).

Let’s try a word that uses S in a different position and includes other common letters not yet eliminated. A strong candidate is “STING”:
- S is in position 1 (new position).
- T, I, N, G are all still possible letters.
- No A, R, O, E are used.

This should give us fresh information about T, I, N, G and the position of S.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STING -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) I(x) N(x) G(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, I, N, G  
   (all marked with x).

2. Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions:
   - S (from both guesses)  
   - T (from STING)

   In AROSE, S was in position 4 → wrong position.  
   In STING, S was in position 1 → wrong position.  
   So S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.

   In STING, T was in position 2 → wrong position.  
   So T cannot be in position 2.

3. Still-possible letters (besides S and T):  
   B, C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

4. We need a 5-letter word that:
   - Contains S and T (both confirmed present).  
   - Does not contain any of A, R, O, E, I, N, G.  
   - Places S in positions 2, 3, or 5 (cannot be 1 or 4).  
   - Places T somewhere except position 2.

Let’s choose a word that satisfies these constraints and uses other common remaining letters.  
Candidate: “BUSTY”  
- Letters: B, U, S, T, Y  
- S is in position 3 (allowed).  
- T is in position 4 (allowed).  
- No forbidden letters are used.

This will test positions 3 and 4 for S and T and introduce B, U, Y.

Let’s extract every constraint we have so far.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x-marked):
A, R, O, E, I, N, G, B, Y

Letters that ARE in the word (but positions still unknown):
S, T, U

Known positions:
- T is in position 4 (✓ in BUSTY).

Letters we know must appear:
- S (cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4) → only possible positions 2 or 5.
- U (cannot be in position 2) → possible positions 1, 3, 4, 5.
- T is fixed in position 4.

So the word looks like:
_ _ _ T _

with the constraints:
- S must be in position 2 or 5.
- U must be in position 1, 3, or 5 (but not 2).
- No forbidden letters (A, R, O, E, I, N, G, B, Y) are allowed.

Remaining possible letters (not yet ruled out):
C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has T in position 4.
- Contains S and U somewhere else.
- Uses only allowed letters.

Let’s try:
- S in position 2 and U in position 1: U S _ T _
  Need a valid letter for position 3 and 5. Possible: USHTC (invalid), USHTL (invalid), etc. Not a real word.

- S in position 2 and U in position 3: _ S U T _
  Need letters for positions 1 and 5. Possible: CSUTD (invalid), DSUTM (invalid), etc. Not a word.

- S in position 5 and U in position 1: U _ _ T S
  Need letters for positions 2 and 3. Possible: U D S T S (invalid), U L S T S (invalid), etc. Not a word.

- S in position 5 and U in position 3: _ _ U T S
  Need letters for positions 1 and 2. Possible: C L U T S (CLUTS – valid word meaning “the sharp edge of a knife” or plural of clut).

“CLUTS” satisfies:
- T in position 4 (✓).
- S in position 5 (allowed).
- U in position 3 (allowed).
- No forbidden letters.
- All letters are from the allowed set.

So the next guess is CLUTS.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter S, but NOT in the 4th position (since S was the 4th letter in AROSE and got “-”).
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

We now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S (and not in position 4).
2. Does not contain A, R, O, E.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U, Y (since A and O are out).

Let’s try a word that uses S in a different position and includes other common letters not yet eliminated. A strong candidate is “STING”:
- S is in position 1 (new position).
- T, I, N, G are all still possible letters.
- No A, R, O, E are used.

This should give us fresh information about T, I, N, G and the position of S.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STING -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) I(x) N(x) G(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, I, N, G  
   (all marked with x).

2. Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions:
   - S (from both guesses)  
   - T (from STING)

   In AROSE, S was in position 4 → wrong position.  
   In STING, S was in position 1 → wrong position.  
   So S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.

   In STING, T was in position 2 → wrong position.  
   So T cannot be in position 2.

3. Still-possible letters (besides S and T):  
   B, C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

4. We need a 5-letter word that:
   - Contains S and T (both confirmed present).  
   - Does not contain any of A, R, O, E, I, N, G.  
   - Places S in positions 2, 3, or 5 (cannot be 1 or 4).  
   - Places T somewhere except position 2.

Let’s choose a word that satisfies these constraints and uses other common remaining letters.  
Candidate: “BUSTY”  
- Letters: B, U, S, T, Y  
- S is in position 3 (allowed).  
- T is in position 4 (allowed).  
- No forbidden letters are used.

This will test positions 3 and 4 for S and T and introduce B, U, Y.

Let’s extract every constraint we have so far.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x-marked):
A, R, O, E, I, N, G, B, Y

Letters that ARE in the word (but positions still unknown):
S, T, U

Known positions:
- T is in position 4 (✓ in BUSTY).

Letters we know must appear:
- S (cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4) → only possible positions 2 or 5.
- U (cannot be in position 2) → possible positions 1, 3, 4, 5.
- T is fixed in position 4.

So the word looks like:
_ _ _ T _

with the constraints:
- S must be in position 2 or 5.
- U must be in position 1, 3, or 5 (but not 2).
- No forbidden letters (A, R, O, E, I, N, G, B, Y) are allowed.

Remaining possible letters (not yet ruled out):
C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has T in position 4.
- Contains S and U somewhere else.
- Uses only allowed letters.

Let’s try:
- S in position 2 and U in position 1: U S _ T _
  Need a valid letter for position 3 and 5. Possible: USHTC (invalid), USHTL (invalid), etc. Not a real word.

- S in position 2 and U in position 3: _ S U T _
  Need letters for positions 1 and 5. Possible: CSUTD (invalid), DSUTM (invalid), etc. Not a word.

- S in position 5 and U in position 1: U _ _ T S
  Need letters for positions 2 and 3. Possible: U D S T S (invalid), U L S T S (invalid), etc. Not a word.

- S in position 5 and U in position 3: _ _ U T S
  Need letters for positions 1 and 2. Possible: C L U T S (CLUTS – valid word meaning “the sharp edge of a knife” or plural of clut).

“CLUTS” satisfies:
- T in position 4 (✓).
- S in position 5 (allowed).
- U in position 3 (allowed).
- No forbidden letters.
- All letters are from the allowed set.

So the next guess is CLUTS.

From the latest feedback on CLUTS:

- C(x), L(x), B(x), Y(x), A(x), R(x), O(x), E(x), I(x), N(x), G(x) are all ruled out.
- U(✓), T(✓), S(✓) are now locked into positions 3, 4, 5 respectively.

So the secret word must be of the form:

_ _ U T S

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 2, chosen only from the still-allowed set:
D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We must form a valid 5-letter English word ending in “UTS”.

Checking common endings:
- “DUTS” – plural of “dut” (not a standard word)
- “HUTS” – valid (plural of hut)
- “JUTS” – valid (plural of jut, though rare)
- “KUTS” – valid (plural of kut, a small coin)
- “MUTS” – not standard
- “P” + “U” + “T” + “S” – nothing obvious
- “VUTS” – not a word
- “WUTS” – not a word
- “XUTS” – not a word
- “ZUTS” – not a word

The most common and likely valid word is “HUTS”.

Let’s verify:
- H, U, T, S – all allowed letters
- U, T, S in correct positions
- No forbidden letters
- “HUTS” is a recognized English plural noun.

Therefore, the only remaining candidate is HUTS.
