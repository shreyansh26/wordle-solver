### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, etc. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers 5 very common letters and can give good initial information about the presence of C, R, A, N, E in the secret word.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A, N, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains C and R somewhere, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, N, or E.

I now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses C and R (since they’re confirmed present).
2. Places C somewhere other than position 1.
3. Places R somewhere other than position 2.
4. Avoids A, N, E entirely.

Good remaining consonants and vowels to try: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

A strong candidate is “TORCH”:
- T, O, R, C, H
- R is in position 3 (allowed, since original R was in position 2).
- C is in position 4 (allowed, since original C was in position 1).
- No A, N, or E are used.

Another option is “SCRUB” (S, C, R, U, B), but it repeats the C/R positions issue. “TORCH” seems cleaner.

I’ll go with TORCH.

- C cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4  
- R cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4  
- S is in the word but not in position 1 (from SCRUM feedback: S(-))  

So:
- C must be in position 3 or 5  
- R must be in position 1 or 5 (but not 2,3,4)  
- S must be in position 2,3,4,5 (but not 1)

We still need three more letters, chosen from the unused alphabet excluding the eliminated set. Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains C and R (and S is allowed but not required)
- Uses only the remaining letters
- Respects the positional restrictions above

Let’s look for words that fit:
- If C is in position 3, then R must be in 1 or 5
- If C is in position 5, then R must be in 1

Try C in position 3 and R in position 1: R _ C _ _
Possible words: RICER (but E is out), RICCH (invalid), RICAS (A is out), RICIL (valid? R I C I L – but double I is okay), RICUP (U is out), etc. RICIL seems possible but is obscure.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, etc. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers 5 very common letters and can give good initial information about the presence of C, R, A, N, E in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A, N, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains C and R somewhere, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, N, or E.

I now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses C and R (since they’re confirmed present).
2. Places C somewhere other than position 1.
3. Places R somewhere other than position 2.
4. Avoids A, N, E entirely.

Good remaining consonants and vowels to try: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

A strong candidate is “TORCH”:
- T, O, R, C, H
- R is in position 3 (allowed, since original R was in position 2).
- C is in position 4 (allowed, since original C was in position 1).
- No A, N, or E are used.

Another option is “SCRUB” (S, C, R, U, B), but it repeats the C/R positions issue. “TORCH” seems cleaner.

I’ll go with TORCH.

Guess 2: TORCH -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(x) R(-) C(-) H(x)
<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. CRANE → C(-) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
   - C is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
   - A, N, E are NOT in the word.

2. TORCH → T(x) O(x) R(-) C(-) H(x)
   - T, O, H are NOT in the word.
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - C is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So far we know:
- Letters that are definitely in the word: C, R
- Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: A, N, E, T, O, H
- Positions ruled out for C: 1, 4
- Positions ruled out for R: 2, 3

Remaining letters to consider: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both C and R.
- Places C in positions 2, 3, or 5.
- Places R in positions 1, 4, or 5 (but not conflicting with others).
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible candidates:
- CRISP: C in 1 (ruled out) → invalid
- SCRUB: C in 2 (allowed), R in 4 (allowed) → valid
- BURPS: no C → invalid
- CRISP: same issue as above
- PRICK: C in 3 (allowed), R in 2 (ruled out) → invalid
- SCRUM: C in 2 (allowed), R in 4 (allowed) → valid
- CRUST: C in 1 (ruled out) → invalid
- SCRIP: C in 2 (allowed), R in 4 (allowed) → valid

Among these, ""SCRUM"" seems good as it uses common letters and fits all constraints.

Let's update what we know after the fourth guess.

Letters we now know:
- I is in position 2 (✓)
- C is in position 3 (✓)
- K is in position 4 (✓)
- R is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-)
- P is not in the word (x)

So the word looks like: _ I C K _

We still need the first and last letters.  
Letters already ruled out: A, N, E, T, O, H, U, M, P  
Remaining unused letters (common ones): B, D, F, G, L, S, V, W, Y, etc.

R: must appear somewhere, and it can’t be in position 5 (from PICKR feedback).  
Therefore R must be in position 1.

So the word must be R I C K ?

Wait, that’s only four letters. We need five.  
But we already have I C K in positions 2-4, and we need positions 1 and 5.

But R must be in position 1 (since it can’t be in 5).  
So the word is R I C K _ ?

We need a fifth letter that is not yet eliminated.  
From the remaining letters, common ones: B, D, F, G, L, S, V, W, Y.

Looking for valid 5-letter words that fit R I C K _:
- RICKS (S is allowed, not eliminated)
- RICKY (Y is allowed)
- RICKB (not a word)
- RICKD (not a word)
- RICKF (not a word)
- RICKG (not a word)
- RICKV (not a word)
- RICKW (not a word)

Between RICKS and RICKY, RICKS is a valid English word (plural of rick) and uses S, which hasn’t been eliminated.

Let’s go with RICKS.
