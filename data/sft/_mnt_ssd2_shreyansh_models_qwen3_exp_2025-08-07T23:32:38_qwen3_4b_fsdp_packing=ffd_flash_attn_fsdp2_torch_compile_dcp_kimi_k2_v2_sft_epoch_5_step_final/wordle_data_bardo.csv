For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words in Wordle include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AUDIO"", etc. These words use frequently occurring vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in the 3rd position.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E at all.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A somewhere other than position 3.
2. Avoids S, L, T, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to gather more information.

Good consonants to try next: R, N, C, D, P, M, B, G, H, K, etc.
Good vowels to try: I, O, U, Y.

A strong second guess that fits these constraints is ""CROWN"":
- C, R, O, W, N – none of these are S, L, T, E.
- A is not used here, but we’ll test new letters and positions to narrow down possibilities.

However, since we know A is in the word, it’s better to include A in the next guess to confirm its exact position. A good choice would be ""CABIN"":
- C, A, B, I, N – includes A in position 2 (not 3), avoids S, L, T, E.
- Tests new consonants C, B, N and vowel I.

But ""CABIN"" might be too specific. A more balanced word that includes A and tests several new common letters is ""CRANK"":
- C, R, A, N, K – A is in position 3 (but feedback said A is not in position 3), so this is bad.

Next option: ""BRAIN"" – A is in position 3 again, which is invalid.

""GRAIN"" – A in position 3 again.

""RAINY"" – A in position 2, tests R, I, N, Y.

""RADIO"" – A in position 2, tests R, D, I, O.

""PAINT"" – A in position 2, tests P, I, N, T (but T is excluded).

""PAKIA"" – A in position 2 and 5, but double A might not be optimal.

""GRAIN"" – A in position 3 is invalid.

""CARON"" – not a valid word.

""VAPID"" – not common.

""RAPID"" – A in position 2, tests R, P, I, D.

""RAPID"" seems good: R, A, P, I, D – all new letters, A in position 2 (not 3), no S, L, T, E.

But let’s pick a word that is more common and tests even more letters. ""RAINY"" is common and tests R, A, I, N, Y.

""RAINY"" is a strong choice:
- R, A, I, N, Y – all new letters except A.
- A is in position 2 (not 3), satisfying the feedback.
- Tests I and Y, which are less common but useful.

However, ""RAINY"" has Y at the end, which might not be optimal. Another good option is ""RADIO"":
- R, A, D, I, O – tests R, D, I, O with A in position 2.

Between ""RAINY"" and ""RADIO"", ""RADIO"" tests more common letters (R, D, I, O) and is slightly more informative.

Final choice: RADIO.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words in Wordle include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AUDIO"", etc. These words use frequently occurring vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in the 3rd position.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E at all.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A somewhere other than position 3.
2. Avoids S, L, T, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to gather more information.

Good consonants to try next: R, N, C, D, P, M, B, G, H, K, etc.
Good vowels to try: I, O, U, Y.

A strong second guess that fits these constraints is ""CROWN"":
- C, R, O, W, N – none of these are S, L, T, E.
- A is not used here, but we’ll test new letters and positions to narrow down possibilities.

However, since we know A is in the word, it’s better to include A in the next guess to confirm its exact position. A good choice would be ""CABIN"":
- C, A, B, I, N – includes A in position 2 (not 3), avoids S, L, T, E.
- Tests new consonants C, B, N and vowel I.

But ""CABIN"" might be too specific. A more balanced word that includes A and tests several new common letters is ""CRANK"":
- C, R, A, N, K – A is in position 3 (but feedback said A is not in position 3), so this is bad.

Next option: ""BRAIN"" – A is in position 3 again, which is invalid.

""GRAIN"" – A in position 3 again.

""RAINY"" – A in position 2, tests R, I, N, Y.

""RADIO"" – A in position 2, tests R, D, I, O.

""PAINT"" – A in position 2, tests P, I, N, T (but T is excluded).

""PAKIA"" – A in position 2 and 5, but double A might not be optimal.

""GRAIN"" – A in position 3 is invalid.

""CARON"" – not a valid word.

""VAPID"" – not common.

""RAPID"" – A in position 2, tests R, P, I, D.

""RAPID"" seems good: R, A, P, I, D – all new letters, A in position 2 (not 3), no S, L, T, E.

But let’s pick a word that is more common and tests even more letters. ""RAINY"" is common and tests R, A, I, N, Y.

""RAINY"" is a strong choice:
- R, A, I, N, Y – all new letters except A.
- A is in position 2 (not 3), satisfying the feedback.
- Tests I and Y, which are less common but useful.

However, ""RAINY"" has Y at the end, which might not be optimal. Another good option is ""RADIO"":
- R, A, D, I, O – tests R, D, I, O with A in position 2.

Between ""RAINY"" and ""RADIO"", ""RADIO"" tests more common letters (R, D, I, O) and is slightly more informative.

Final choice: RADIO.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: RADIO -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) D(-) I(x) O(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)  
   - Eliminates S, L, T, E entirely.  
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 3.

2. RADIO → R(-) A(✓) D(-) I(x) O(✓)  
   - A is now confirmed in position 2.  
   - O is confirmed in position 5.  
   - R and D are in the word but in wrong positions.  
   - I is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ A _ _ O  
- Letters to include: A (pos 2), O (pos 5), R (somewhere), D (somewhere)  
- Letters to exclude: S, L, T, E, I  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2 and O in position 5.  
- Contains R and D somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.  
- Uses only remaining letters (no S, L, T, E, I).

Possible letters left: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus O already fixed.

Let’s list candidates that fit _ A _ _ O and contain R and D:
- D A R _ O → DAR_O → DARBO (not a word), DARDO (slang), DARD O (invalid).  
- R A D _ O → RAD_O → RADYO (invalid), RADDO (invalid).  
- _ A D R O → C A D R O (CADRO? no), M A D R O (MADRO? no), B A D R O (BADRO? no).  
- _ A R D O → C A R D O (CARDO? no), M A R D O (MARD O? no), B A R D O (BARDO? no).  
- R A _ D O → R A _ D O → R A N D O (RAN D O) → RAND O → RANDO (invalid).  
- R A _ _ O with D in 4th: R A _ D O → R A M D O (RAMDO? no), R A N D O (RAN D O) → RANDO (invalid).  
- D A _ R O → D A N R O (DANRO? no), D A M R O (DAMRO? no).

Wait, let’s think of real words:
- C A R D O → CARDO (valid, a type of plant or ancient unit).  
- M A R D O → MARD O (invalid).  
- B A R D O → BARDO (valid, Tibetan spiritual guide).  
- F A R D O → FARDO (invalid).  
- P A R D O → PARD O (invalid).  
- C A R D O seems the best fit.

Let’s verify:
- C A R D O: positions 1-5: C, A, R, D, O.  
- A is in position 2 ✓.  
- O is in position 5 ✓.  
- Contains R and D ✓.  
- No S, L, T, E, I ✓.  
- Real word (CARDO) ✓.

Thus, the next guess is CARDO.
