### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and which are not. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many 5-letter words. This gives me the best chance of hitting at least one correct letter or at least identifying several letters that are in the word.

2. The word does NOT contain A, R, O, or E.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

A word like ""STING"" would use S (position 1), T, I, N, G. But G is less common. ""SLUMP"" uses S, L, U, M, P - but U is a vowel we might want to test. ""SPLIT"" uses S, P, L, I, T - this seems strong as it tests S in position 1 and common letters P, L, I, T.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. SPLIT → S(-) P(x) L(-) I(-) T(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - P and T are NOT in the word.
   - L is in the word but not in position 3.
   - I is in the word but not in position 4.

So far we know:
- Letters that are definitely in the word: S, L, I
- Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, P, T
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
- L cannot be in position 3.
- I cannot be in position 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S, L, I exactly once each.
- Does not contain A, R, O, E, P, T.
- S is in position 2, 3, or 5.
- L is in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).
- I is in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).

Remaining common letters we can use: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s try to place S, L, I in positions that satisfy the constraints and fill the remaining spots with other allowed letters.

Possible structure:
- If S is in position 2: _ S _ _ _
  - L and I must fit in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 with constraints.
- If S is in position 3: _ _ S _ _
  - L and I must fit in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 with constraints.
- If S is in position 5: _ _ _ _ S
  - L and I must fit in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 with constraints.

Let’s try S in position 2:
Word form: _ S _ _ _
We need L and I in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 with:
- L not in 3
- I not in 4

Possible placements:
- L in 1, I in 3: L S I _ _
- L in 1, I in 4: L S _ I _
- L in 1, I in 5: L S _ _ I
- L in 3, I in 1: I S L _ _
- L in 3, I in 5: _ S L _ I
- L in 4, I in 1: I S _ L _
- L in 4, I in 3: _ S I L _
- L in 5, I in 1: I S _ _ L
- L in 5, I in 3: _ S I _ L
- L in 5, I in 4: _ S _ I L

We need to fill the remaining spots with allowed letters (B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, U, V, W, Y).

Let’s pick one of these patterns and choose common letters.

For example:
- L S I _ _ : Need two more letters. Possible: L S I N G → LSING (but not a word)
- L S _ I _ : L S _ I _ → L S C I N → not a word
- L S _ _ I : L S _ _ I → L S C N I → not a word
- I S L _ _ : I S L _ _ → I S L I N → not valid
- _ S L _ I : _ S L _ I → C S L I N → not a word
- _ S _ L I : _ S _ L I → C S N L I → not a word
- _ S I L _ : _ S I L _ → C S I L N → not a word
- I S _ L _ : I S _ L _ → I S C L N → not a word
- I S _ _ L : I S _ _ L → I S C N L → not a word
- _ S I _ L : _ S I _ L → C S I N L → not a word

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. Let’s try S in position 3 instead.

Word form: _ _ S _ _
We need L and I in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 with:
- L not in 3 (already satisfied)
- I not in 4

Possible placements:
- L in 1, I in 2: L I S _ _
- L in 1, I in 4: L _ S I _
- L in 1, I in 5: L _ S _ I
- L in 2, I in 1: I L S _ _
- L in 2, I in 4: _ L S I _
- L in 2, I in 5: _ L S _ I
- L in 4, I in 1: I _ S L _
- L in 4, I in 2: _ I S L _
- L in 5, I in 1: I _ S _ L
- L in 5, I in 2: _ I S _ L
- L in 5, I in 4: _ _ S I L

Let’s check these:

- L I S _ _ : L I S _ _ → L I S N G → LISNG (not a word)
- L _ S I _ : L _ S I _ → L U S I N → LUSIN (not a word)
- L _ S _ I : L _ S _ I → L U S N I → LUSNI (not a word)
- I L S _ _ : I L S _ _ → I L S N G → ILSNG (not a word)
- _ L S I _ : _ L S I _ → C L S I N → CLSIN (not a word)

- _ I S _ L : _ I S _ L → C I S N L → CISNL (not a word)
- _ _ S I L : _ _ S I L → C U S I L → CUSIL (not a word)

Still nothing. Let’s try S in position 5.

Word form: _ _ _ _ S
We need L and I in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 with:
- L not in 3
- I not in 4

Possible placements:
- L in 1, I in 2: L I _ _ S
- L in 1, I in 3: L _ I _ S
- L in 1, I in 4: L _ _ I S
- L in 2, I in 1: I L _ _ S
- L in 2, I in 3: _ L I _ S
- L in 2, I in 4: _ L _ I S
- L in 3, I in 1: I _ L _ S
- L in 3, I in 2: _ I L _ S
- L in 4, I in 1: I _ _ L S
- L in 4, I in 2: _ I _ L S
- L in 4, I in 3: _ _ L I S

Let’s check these:

- L I _ _ S : L I _ _ S → L I N G S → LINGS (valid word)
- L _ I _ S : L _ I _ S → L U I N S → LUISN (not a word)
- L _ _ I S : L _ _ I S → L U N I S → LUNIS (not a word)
- I L _ _ S : I L _ _ S → I L L I S → ILLIS (not a word)

- _ I _ L S : _ I _ L S → C I N L S → CINLS (not a word)
- _ _ L I S : _ _ L I S → C U L I S → CULIS (not a word)

The only valid word here is L I N G S.

Let me verify:
- Letters: L, I, N, G, S
- Contains S, L, I (good)
- Does not contain A, R, O, E, P, T (good)
- S is in position 5 (not 1 or 4, satisfies feedback)
- L is in position 1 (not 3, satisfies feedback)
- I is in position 2 (not 4, satisfies feedback)

Looks good.

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. Let’s try S in position 3 instead.

Word form: _ _ S _ _
We need L and I in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 with:
- L not in 3 (already satisfied)
- I not in 4

Possible placements:
- L in 1, I in 2: L I S _ _
- L in 1, I in 4: L _ S I _
- L in 1, I in 5: L _ S _ I
- L in 2, I in 1: I L S _ _
- L in 2, I in 4: _ L S I _
- L in 2, I in 5: _ L S _ I
- L in 4, I in 1: I _ S L _
- L in 4, I in 2: _ I S L _
- L in 5, I in 1: I _ S _ L
- L in 5, I in 2: _ I S _ L
- L in 5, I in 4: _ _ S I L

Let’s check these:

- L I S _ _ : L I S _ _ → L I S N G → LISNG (not a word)
- L _ S I _ : L _ S I _ → L U S I N → LUSIN (not a word)

- _ _ S I L : _ _ S I L → C U S I L → CUSIL (not a word)

Still nothing. Let’s try S in position 5.

Word form: _ _ _ _ S
We need L and I in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 with:
- L not in 3
- I not in 4

Possible placements:
- L in 1, I in 2: L I _ _ S
- L in 1, I in 3: L _ I _ S
- L in 1, I in 4: L _ _ I S
- L in 2, I in 1: I L _ _ S
- L in 2, I in 3: _ L I _ S

- L in 4, I in 1: I _ _ L S
- L in 4, I in 2: _ I _ L S
- L in 4, I in 3: _ _ L I S

Let’s check these:

- L I _ _ S : L I _ _ S → L I N G S → LINGS (valid word)
- L _ I _ S : L _ I _ S → L U I N S → LUISN (not a word)
- L _ _ I S : L _ _ I S → L U N I S → LUNIS (not a word)

- _ I _ L S : _ I _ L S → C I N L S → CINLS (not a word)
- _ _ L I S : _ _ L I S → C U L I S → CULIS (not a word)

The only valid word here is L I N G S.

Let me verify:
- Letters: L, I, N, G, S
- Contains S, L, I (good)
- Does not contain A, R, O, E, P, T (good)
- S is in position 5 (not 1 or 4, satisfies feedback)
- L is in position 1 (not 3, satisfies feedback)
- I is in position 2 (not 4, satisfies feedback)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and which are not. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many 5-letter words. This gives me the best chance of hitting at least one correct letter or at least identifying several letters that are in the word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
1. The word contains an S, but not in position 4.
2. The word does NOT contain A, R, O, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes S (but not in position 4).
- Excludes A, R, O, E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

A word like ""STING"" would use S (position 1), T, I, N, G. But G is less common. ""SLUMP"" uses S, L, U, M, P - but U is a vowel we might want to test. ""SPLIT"" uses S, P, L, I, T - this seems strong as it tests S in position 1 and common letters P, L, I, T.

Let's go with SPLIT.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SPLIT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) L(-) I(-) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. SPLIT → S(-) P(x) L(-) I(-) T(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - P and T are NOT in the word.
   - L is in the word but not in position 3.
   - I is in the word but not in position 4.

So far we know:
- Letters that are definitely in the word: S, L, I
- Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, P, T
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
- L cannot be in position 3.
- I cannot be in position 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S, L, I exactly once each.
- Does not contain A, R, O, E, P, T.
- S is in position 2, 3, or 5.
- L is in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).
- I is in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).

Remaining common letters we can use: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s try to place S, L, I in positions that satisfy the constraints and fill the remaining spots with other allowed letters.

Possible structure:
- If S is in position 2: _ S _ _ _
  - L and I must fit in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 with constraints.
- If S is in position 3: _ _ S _ _
  - L and I must fit in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 with constraints.
- If S is in position 5: _ _ _ _ S
  - L and I must fit in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 with constraints.

Let’s try S in position 2:
Word form: _ S _ _ _
We need L and I in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 with:
- L not in 3
- I not in 4

Possible placements:
- L in 1, I in 3: L S I _ _
- L in 1, I in 4: L S _ I _
- L in 1, I in 5: L S _ _ I
- L in 3, I in 1: I S L _ _
- L in 3, I in 5: _ S L _ I
- L in 4, I in 1: I S _ L _
- L in 4, I in 3: _ S I L _
- L in 5, I in 1: I S _ _ L
- L in 5, I in 3: _ S I _ L
- L in 5, I in 4: _ S _ I L

We need to fill the remaining spots with allowed letters (B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, U, V, W, Y).

Let’s pick one of these patterns and choose common letters.

For example:
- L S I _ _ : Need two more letters. Possible: L S I N G → LSING (but not a word)
- L S _ I _ : L S _ I _ → L S C I N → not a word
- L S _ _ I : L S _ _ I → L S C N I → not a word
- I S L _ _ : I S L _ _ → I S L I N → not valid
- _ S L _ I : _ S L _ I → C S L I N → not a word
- _ S _ L I : _ S _ L I → C S N L I → not a word
- _ S I L _ : _ S I L _ → C S I L N → not a word
- I S _ L _ : I S _ L _ → I S C L N → not a word
- I S _ _ L : I S _ _ L → I S C N L → not a word
- _ S I _ L : _ S I _ L → C S I N L → not a word

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. Let’s try S in position 3 instead.

Word form: _ _ S _ _
We need L and I in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 with:
- L not in 3 (already satisfied)
- I not in 4

Possible placements:
- L in 1, I in 2: L I S _ _
- L in 1, I in 4: L _ S I _
- L in 1, I in 5: L _ S _ I
- L in 2, I in 1: I L S _ _
- L in 2, I in 4: _ L S I _
- L in 2, I in 5: _ L S _ I
- L in 4, I in 1: I _ S L _
- L in 4, I in 2: _ I S L _
- L in 5, I in 1: I _ S _ L
- L in 5, I in 2: _ I S _ L
- L in 5, I in 4: _ _ S I L

Let’s check these:

- L I S _ _ : L I S _ _ → L I S N G → LISNG (not a word)
- L _ S I _ : L _ S I _ → L U S I N → LUSIN (not a word)
- L _ S _ I : L _ S _ I → L U S N I → LUSNI (not a word)

- _ L S I _ : _ L S I _ → C L S I N → CLSIN (not a word)

- _ I S _ L : _ I S _ L → C I S N L → CISNL (not a word)
- _ _ S I L : _ _ S I L → C U S I L → CUSIL (not a word)

Still nothing. Let’s try S in position 5.

Word form: _ _ _ _ S
We need L and I in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 with:
- L not in 3
- I not in 4

Possible placements:
- L in 1, I in 2: L I _ _ S
- L in 1, I in 3: L _ I _ S
- L in 1, I in 4: L _ _ I S
- L in 2, I in 1: I L _ _ S
- L in 2, I in 3: _ L I _ S
- L in 2, I in 4: _ L _ I S
- L in 3, I in 1: I _ L _ S
- L in 3, I in 2: _ I L _ S
- L in 4, I in 1: I _ _ L S
- L in 4, I in 2: _ I _ L S
- L in 4, I in 3: _ _ L I S

Let’s check these:

- L I _ _ S : L I _ _ S → L I N G S → LINGS (valid word)
- L _ I _ S : L _ I _ S → L U I N S → LUISN (not a word)
- L _ _ I S : L _ _ I S → L U N I S → LUNIS (not a word)
- I L _ _ S : I L _ _ S → I L L I S → ILLIS (not a word)
- _ L I _ S : _ L I _ S → C L I N S → CLINS (not a word)
- _ L _ I S : _ L _ I S → C L U I S → CLUIS (not a word)
- I _ L _ S : I _ L _ S → I N L I S → INLIS (not a word)
- _ I L _ S : _ I L _ S → C I L N S → CILNS (not a word)
- I _ _ L S : I _ _ L S → I N N L S → INNLS (not a word)
- _ I _ L S : _ I _ L S → C I N L S → CINLS (not a word)
- _ _ L I S : _ _ L I S → C U L I S → CULIS (not a word)

The only valid word here is L I N G S.

Let me verify:
- Letters: L, I, N, G, S
- Contains S, L, I (good)
- Does not contain A, R, O, E, P, T (good)
- S is in position 5 (not 1 or 4, satisfies feedback)
- L is in position 1 (not 3, satisfies feedback)
- I is in position 2 (not 4, satisfies feedback)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and which are not. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many 5-letter words. This gives me the best chance of hitting at least one correct letter or at least identifying several letters that are in the word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
1. The word contains an S, but not in position 4.
2. The word does NOT contain A, R, O, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes S (but not in position 4).
- Excludes A, R, O, E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

A word like ""STING"" would use S (position 1), T, I, N, G. But G is less common. ""SLUMP"" uses S, L, U, M, P - but U is a vowel we might want to test. ""SPLIT"" uses S, P, L, I, T - this seems strong as it tests S in position 1 and common letters P, L, I, T.

Let's go with SPLIT.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SPLIT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) L(-) I(-) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. SPLIT → S(-) P(x) L(-) I(-) T(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - P and T are NOT in the word.
   - L is in the word but not in position 3.
   - I is in the word but not in position 4.

So far we know:
- Letters that are definitely in the word: S, L, I
- Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, P, T
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
- L cannot be in position 3.
- I cannot be in position 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S, L, I exactly once each.
- Does not contain A, R, O, E, P, T.
- S is in position 2, 3, or 5.
- L is in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).
- I is in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).

Remaining common letters we can use: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s try to place S, L, I in positions that satisfy the constraints and fill the remaining spots with other allowed letters.

Possible structure:
- If S is in position 2: _ S _ _ _
  - L and I must fit in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 with constraints.
- If S is in position 3: _ _ S _ _
  - L and I must fit in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 with constraints.
- If S is in position 5: _ _ _ _ S
  - L and I must fit in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 with constraints.

Let’s try S in position 2:
Word form: _ S _ _ _
We need L and I in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 with:
- L not in 3
- I not in 4

Possible placements:
- L in 1, I in 3: L S I _ _
- L in 1, I in 4: L S _ I _
- L in 1, I in 5: L S _ _ I
- L in 3, I in 1: I S L _ _
- L in 3, I in 5: _ S L _ I
- L in 4, I in 1: I S _ L _
- L in 4, I in 3: _ S I L _
- L in 5, I in 1: I S _ _ L
- L in 5, I in 3: _ S I _ L
- L in 5, I in 4: _ S _ I L

We need to fill the remaining spots with allowed letters (B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, U, V, W, Y).

Let’s pick one of these patterns and choose common letters.

For example:
- L S I _ _ : Need two more letters. Possible: L S I N G → LSING (but not a word)
- L S _ I _ : L S _ I _ → L S C I N → not a word
- L S _ _ I : L S _ _ I → L S C N I → not a word
- I S L _ _ : I S L _ _ → I S L I N → not valid
- _ S L _ I : _ S L _ I → C S L I N → not a word
- _ S _ L I : _ S _ L I → C S N L I → not a word
- _ S I L _ : _ S I L _ → C S I L N → not a word
- I S _ L _ : I S _ L _ → I S C L N → not a word
- I S _ _ L : I S _ _ L → I S C N L → not a word
- _ S I _ L : _ S I _ L → C S I N L → not a word

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. Let’s try S in position 3 instead.

Word form: _ _ S _ _
We need L and I in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 with:
- L not in 3 (already satisfied)
- I not in 4

Possible placements:
- L in 1, I in 2: L I S _ _
- L in 1, I in 4: L _ S I _
- L in 1, I in 5: L _ S _ I
- L in 2, I in 1: I L S _ _
- L in 2, I in 4: _ L S I _
- L in 2, I in 5: _ L S _ I
- L in 4, I in 1: I _ S L _
- L in 4, I in 2: _ I S L _
- L in 5, I in 1: I _ S _ L
- L in 5, I in 2: _ I S _ L
- L in 5, I in 4: _ _ S I L

Let’s check these:

- L I S _ _ : L I S _ _ → L I S N G → LISNG (not a word)
- L _ S I _ : L _ S I _ → L U S I N → LUSIN (not a word)
- L _ S _ I : L _ S _ I → L U S N I → LUSNI (not a word)
- I L S _ _ : I L S _ _ → I L S N G → ILSNG (not a word)
- _ L S I _ : _ L S I _ → C L S I N → CLSIN (not a word)
- _ L S _ I : _ L S _ I → C L S N I → CLSNI (not a word)
- I _ S L _ : I _ S L _ → I N S L _ → INSL_ (not a word)
- _ I S L _ : _ I S L _ → C I S L N → CISLN (not a word)
- I _ S _ L : I _ S _ L → I N S _ L → INS_L (not a word)
- _ I S _ L : _ I S _ L → C I S N L → CISNL (not a word)
- _ _ S I L : _ _ S I L → C U S I L → CUSIL (not a word)

Still nothing. Let’s try S in position 5.

Word form: _ _ _ _ S
We need L and I in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 with:
- L not in 3
- I not in 4

Possible placements:
- L in 1, I in 2: L I _ _ S
- L in 1, I in 3: L _ I _ S
- L in 1, I in 4: L _ _ I S
- L in 2, I in 1: I L _ _ S
- L in 2, I in 3: _ L I _ S
- L in 2, I in 4: _ L _ I S
- L in 3, I in 1: I _ L _ S
- L in 3, I in 2: _ I L _ S
- L in 4, I in 1: I _ _ L S
- L in 4, I in 2: _ I _ L S
- L in 4, I in 3: _ _ L I S

Let’s check these:

- L I _ _ S : L I _ _ S → L I N G S → LINGS (valid word)
- L _ I _ S : L _ I _ S → L U I N S → LUISN (not a word)
- L _ _ I S : L _ _ I S → L U N I S → LUNIS (not a word)
- I L _ _ S : I L _ _ S → I L L I S → ILLIS (not a word)
- _ L I _ S : _ L I _ S → C L I N S → CLINS (not a word)
- _ L _ I S : _ L _ I S → C L U I S → CLUIS (not a word)
- I _ L _ S : I _ L _ S → I N L I S → INLIS (not a word)
- _ I L _ S : _ I L _ S → C I L N S → CILNS (not a word)
- I _ _ L S : I _ _ L S → I N N L S → INNLS (not a word)
- _ I _ L S : _ I _ L S → C I N L S → CINLS (not a word)
- _ _ L I S : _ _ L I S → C U L I S → CULIS (not a word)

The only valid word here is L I N G S.

Let me verify:
- Letters: L, I, N, G, S
- Contains S, L, I (good)
- Does not contain A, R, O, E, P, T (good)
- S is in position 5 (not 1 or 4, satisfies feedback)
- L is in position 1 (not 3, satisfies feedback)
- I is in position 2 (not 4, satisfies feedback)

- Contains L, I, N, S in the correct positions.
- Does not contain any eliminated letters (A, R, O, E, P, T, G).
- Is a valid English word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and which are not. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many 5-letter words. This gives me the best chance of hitting at least one correct letter or at least identifying several letters that are in the word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
1. The word contains an S, but not in position 4.
2. The word does NOT contain A, R, O, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes S (but not in position 4).
- Excludes A, R, O, E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

A word like ""STING"" would use S (position 1), T, I, N, G. But G is less common. ""SLUMP"" uses S, L, U, M, P - but U is a vowel we might want to test. ""SPLIT"" uses S, P, L, I, T - this seems strong as it tests S in position 1 and common letters P, L, I, T.

Let's go with SPLIT.

Guess 2: SPLIT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) L(-) I(-) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. SPLIT → S(-) P(x) L(-) I(-) T(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - P and T are NOT in the word.
   - L is in the word but not in position 3.
   - I is in the word but not in position 4.

So far we know:
- Letters that are definitely in the word: S, L, I
- Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, P, T
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
- L cannot be in position 3.
- I cannot be in position 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S, L, I exactly once each.
- Does not contain A, R, O, E, P, T.
- S is in position 2, 3, or 5.
- L is in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).
- I is in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).

Remaining common letters we can use: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s try to place S, L, I in positions that satisfy the constraints and fill the remaining spots with other allowed letters.

Possible structure:
- If S is in position 2: _ S _ _ _
  - L and I must fit in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 with constraints.
- If S is in position 3: _ _ S _ _
  - L and I must fit in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 with constraints.
- If S is in position 5: _ _ _ _ S
  - L and I must fit in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 with constraints.

Let’s try S in position 2:
Word form: _ S _ _ _
We need L and I in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 with:
- L not in 3
- I not in 4

Possible placements:
- L in 1, I in 3: L S I _ _
- L in 1, I in 4: L S _ I _
- L in 1, I in 5: L S _ _ I
- L in 3, I in 1: I S L _ _
- L in 3, I in 5: _ S L _ I
- L in 4, I in 1: I S _ L _
- L in 4, I in 3: _ S I L _
- L in 5, I in 1: I S _ _ L
- L in 5, I in 3: _ S I _ L
- L in 5, I in 4: _ S _ I L

We need to fill the remaining spots with allowed letters (B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, U, V, W, Y).

Let’s pick one of these patterns and choose common letters.

For example:
- L S I _ _ : Need two more letters. Possible: L S I N G → LSING (but not a word)
- L S _ I _ : L S _ I _ → L S C I N → not a word
- L S _ _ I : L S _ _ I → L S C N I → not a word
- I S L _ _ : I S L _ _ → I S L I N → not valid
- _ S L _ I : _ S L _ I → C S L I N → not a word
- _ S _ L I : _ S _ L I → C S N L I → not a word
- _ S I L _ : _ S I L _ → C S I L N → not a word
- I S _ L _ : I S _ L _ → I S C L N → not a word
- I S _ _ L : I S _ _ L → I S C N L → not a word
- _ S I _ L : _ S I _ L → C S I N L → not a word

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. Let’s try S in position 3 instead.

Word form: _ _ S _ _
We need L and I in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 with:
- L not in 3 (already satisfied)
- I not in 4

Possible placements:
- L in 1, I in 2: L I S _ _
- L in 1, I in 4: L _ S I _
- L in 1, I in 5: L _ S _ I
- L in 2, I in 1: I L S _ _
- L in 2, I in 4: _ L S I _
- L in 2, I in 5: _ L S _ I
- L in 4, I in 1: I _ S L _
- L in 4, I in 2: _ I S L _
- L in 5, I in 1: I _ S _ L
- L in 5, I in 2: _ I S _ L
- L in 5, I in 4: _ _ S I L

Let’s check these:

- L I S _ _ : L I S _ _ → L I S N G → LISNG (not a word)
- L _ S I _ : L _ S I _ → L U S I N → LUSIN (not a word)
- L _ S _ I : L _ S _ I → L U S N I → LUSNI (not a word)
- I L S _ _ : I L S _ _ → I L S N G → ILSNG (not a word)
- _ L S I _ : _ L S I _ → C L S I N → CLSIN (not a word)
- _ L S _ I : _ L S _ I → C L S N I → CLSNI (not a word)
- I _ S L _ : I _ S L _ → I N S L _ → INSL_ (not a word)

- _ I S _ L : _ I S _ L → C I S N L → CISNL (not a word)
- _ _ S I L : _ _ S I L → C U S I L → CUSIL (not a word)

Still nothing. Let’s try S in position 5.

Word form: _ _ _ _ S
We need L and I in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 with:
- L not in 3
- I not in 4

Possible placements:
- L in 1, I in 2: L I _ _ S
- L in 1, I in 3: L _ I _ S
- L in 1, I in 4: L _ _ I S
- L in 2, I in 1: I L _ _ S
- L in 2, I in 3: _ L I _ S
- L in 2, I in 4: _ L _ I S
- L in 3, I in 1: I _ L _ S
- L in 3, I in 2: _ I L _ S
- L in 4, I in 1: I _ _ L S
- L in 4, I in 2: _ I _ L S
- L in 4, I in 3: _ _ L I S

Let’s check these:

- L I _ _ S : L I _ _ S → L I N G S → LINGS (valid word)
- L _ I _ S : L _ I _ S → L U I N S → LUISN (not a word)
- L _ _ I S : L _ _ I S → L U N I S → LUNIS (not a word)
- I L _ _ S : I L _ _ S → I L L I S → ILLIS (not a word)
- _ L I _ S : _ L I _ S → C L I N S → CLINS (not a word)
- _ L _ I S : _ L _ I S → C L U I S → CLUIS (not a word)
- I _ L _ S : I _ L _ S → I N L I S → INLIS (not a word)
- _ I L _ S : _ I L _ S → C I L N S → CILNS (not a word)
- I _ _ L S : I _ _ L S → I N N L S → INNLS (not a word)
- _ I _ L S : _ I _ L S → C I N L S → CINLS (not a word)
- _ _ L I S : _ _ L I S → C U L I S → CULIS (not a word)

The only valid word here is L I N G S.

Let me verify:
- Letters: L, I, N, G, S
- Contains S, L, I (good)
- Does not contain A, R, O, E, P, T (good)
- S is in position 5 (not 1 or 4, satisfies feedback)
- L is in position 1 (not 3, satisfies feedback)
- I is in position 2 (not 4, satisfies feedback)

- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- G is NOT in the word.
- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

The only remaining position is the 4th letter. We need a letter that:
- Has not been eliminated yet (not A, R, O, E, P, T, G).
- Makes a valid 5-letter word when placed in the 4th position.

- L I N Y S → L I N Y S (not a word)

The only valid word fitting the pattern is LINUS.

Let me verify:
- L I N U S
- Contains L, I, N, S in the correct positions.
- Does not contain any eliminated letters (A, R, O, E, P, T, G).
- Is a valid English word.

Therefore, the next guess should be LINUS.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SPLIT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) L(-) I(-) T(x)
Guess 3: LINGS -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) I(✓) N(✓) G(x) S(✓)
Guess 4: LINUS -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) I(✓) N(✓) U(x) S(✓)

From the feedback on LINUS we now know:

- L I N _ S are all correct in positions 1-3 and 5.
- U is NOT in the word.

So the pattern is still L I N _ S, but the fourth letter is now known to be anything except:
A, R, O, E, P, T, G, U.

Remaining possible letters for the fourth position: B, C, D, F, H, K, M, V, W, Y.

Looking at valid 5-letter words that fit L I N _ S:

- L I N B S → LINBS – not a word
- L I N C S → L I N C S – not a word
- L I N D S → L I N D S – not a word
- L I N F S → L I N F S – not a word
- L I N H S → L I N H S – not a word
- L I N K S → L I N K S – this is actually “links” (plural of link)
- L I N M S → L I N M S – not a word
- L I N V S → L I N V S – not a word
- L I N W S → L I N W S – not a word
- L I N Y S → L I N Y S – not a word

The only valid English word left is LINKS.

Check:
- L I N K S
- All letters are allowed (K has not been eliminated).
- Fits the pattern L I N _ S.

Therefore, the next guess must be LINKS.
