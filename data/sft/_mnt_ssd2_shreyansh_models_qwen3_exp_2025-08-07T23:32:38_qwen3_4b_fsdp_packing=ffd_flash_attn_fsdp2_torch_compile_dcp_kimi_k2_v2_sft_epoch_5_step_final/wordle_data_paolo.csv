### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give me good coverage of common letters and positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word at all (x).
- L is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- T is not in the word (x).
- E is not in the word (x).

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: S, T, E.
- Letters we must use somewhere: L and A.
- L cannot be in position 2.

I need a 5-letter word that:

Possible positions for L: 1, 3, 4, 5.

From the two guesses so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - S, T, E are not in the word.
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. PLAID → P(✓) L(-) A(-) I(x) D(x)
   - P is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
   - L is in the word but not in position 2 (confirmed again).
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (confirmed again).
   - I and D are not in the word.

So we now know:
- The word starts with P.
- It contains L and A, but:
  - L is not in position 2.
  - A is not in position 3.
- Letters to avoid: S, T, E, I, D.

Remaining positions: 2, 3, 4, 5.
We need to place L and A in these positions while avoiding the forbidden spots.

Possible positions for L: 3, 4, 5 (cannot be 2).
Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5 (cannot be 3).

Let's think of words starting with P, containing L and A, avoiding the forbidden letters and positions.

Candidate words:
- PLANK: L in 2 (forbidden) → no.
- PLAZA: Z is uncommon, but let's check: P L A Z A. L is in 2 (forbidden) → no.
- PLACE: E is forbidden → no.
- PLAID: already guessed → no.
- PLANT: T is forbidden → no.
- PLAGU: not a valid word.
- PLASM: S is forbidden → no.
- PLANK: already considered.

Wait, let's think differently. Maybe L is in position 3 or 4 or 5, and A is in 2 or 4 or 5.

Possible combinations:
- Position 3: L, then A can be 2, 4, 5.
- Position 4: L, then A can be 2, 3, 5 (but 3 is forbidden for A).
- Position 5: L, then A can be 2, 3, 4 (but 3 is forbidden for A).

Let's try:
- P A L _ _: A in 2, L in 3. Word: PAL??.
  - Possible: PALMY (Y is allowed), but Y is uncommon.
  - PALMY: letters P,A,L,M,Y. Contains L (3) and A (2), no forbidden letters. Seems valid.

Another option:
- P _ A L _: A in 3 is forbidden, so skip.
- P _ _ A L: A in 4, L in 5. Word: P??AL.
  - Possible: PUNCH (no), PRANK (K is allowed), but R and N are good consonants.
  - PRANK: P R A N K. Contains A (3) but A cannot be in 3 → invalid.
  - P R A L _: but A is in 3 → invalid.
  - P R A M B: not valid.
  - P R A M E: E is forbidden.
  - P R A M I: I is forbidden.
  - P R A M O: O is allowed. Word: PRAMO? Not a common word.

Another approach: P _ _ _ _ with L and A in remaining positions.
Let's try:
- P A _ L _: A in 2, L in 4. Word: P A ? L ?.
  - Possible: P A N L Y (not a word), P A R L Y (valid: PARLY is archaic but listed).
  - P A R L Y: P(✓), A(2), R(?), L(4), Y(?). Contains A and L, no forbidden letters.

But PARLY is obscure. Let's think of more common words.

Alternative: P _ A _ L: A in 3 is forbidden, so skip.

Another: P _ _ A L: A in 4, L in 5. Word: P ? ? A L.
  - Possible: P U N A L (valid: PUNAL is a variant of PUNA, but rare).
  - P R O A L: not a word.

Wait, let's try:
- P A L _ _: A in 2, L in 3. Word: P A L ? ?.
  - PALMY: P A L M Y. Valid word, contains A and L, no forbidden letters.

This seems the best so far.

Another candidate: P A L M Y vs P A R L Y vs P U N A L.

PALMY is more common and straightforward.

Let's verify:
- P A L M Y:
  - Starts with P (correct position).
  - Contains A (position 2, allowed) and L (position 3, allowed).
  - No S, T, E, I, D.
  - L is not in position 2 (it's in 3) – satisfies feedback.
  - A is not in position 3 (it's in 2) – satisfies feedback.

Thus, ""PALMY"" is a strong next guess.

- PLAGU: not a valid word.
- PLASM: S is forbidden → no.
- PLANK: already considered.

Wait, let's think differently. Maybe L is in position 3 or 4 or 5, and A is in 2 or 4 or 5.

Possible combinations:
- Position 3: L, then A can be 2, 4, 5.
- Position 4: L, then A can be 2, 3, 5 (but 3 is forbidden for A).
- Position 5: L, then A can be 2, 3, 4 (but 3 is forbidden for A).

Let's try:
- P A L _ _: A in 2, L in 3. Word: PAL??.
  - Possible: PALMY (Y is allowed), but Y is uncommon.
  - PALMY: letters P,A,L,M,Y. Contains L (3) and A (2), no forbidden letters. Seems valid.

Another option:
- P _ A L _: A in 3 is forbidden, so skip.
- P _ _ A L: A in 4, L in 5. Word: P??AL.
  - Possible: PUNCH (no), PRANK (K is allowed), but R and N are good consonants.
  - PRANK: P R A N K. Contains A (3) but A cannot be in 3 → invalid.
  - P R A L _: but A is in 3 → invalid.
  - P R A M B: not valid.
  - P R A M E: E is forbidden.
  - P R A M I: I is forbidden.
  - P R A M O: O is allowed. Word: PRAMO? Not a common word.

Another approach: P _ _ _ _ with L and A in remaining positions.
Let's try:
- P A _ L _: A in 2, L in 4. Word: P A ? L ?.
  - Possible: P A N L Y (not a word), P A R L Y (valid: PARLY is archaic but listed).
  - P A R L Y: P(✓), A(2), R(?), L(4), Y(?). Contains A and L, no forbidden letters.

But PARLY is obscure. Let's think of more common words.

Alternative: P _ A _ L: A in 3 is forbidden, so skip.

Another: P _ _ A L: A in 4, L in 5. Word: P ? ? A L.
  - Possible: P U N A L (valid: PUNAL is a variant of PUNA, but rare).
  - P R O A L: not a word.

Wait, let's try:
- P A L _ _: A in 2, L in 3. Word: P A L ? ?.
  - PALMY: P A L M Y. Valid word, contains A and L, no forbidden letters.

This seems the best so far.

Another candidate: P A L M Y vs P A R L Y vs P U N A L.

PALMY is more common and straightforward.

Let's verify:
- P A L M Y:
  - Starts with P (correct position).
  - Contains A (position 2, allowed) and L (position 3, allowed).
  - No S, T, E, I, D.
  - L is not in position 2 (it's in 3) – satisfies feedback.
  - A is not in position 3 (it's in 2) – satisfies feedback.

Thus, ""PALMY"" is a strong next guess.",Guess 3: PALMY -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) A(✓) L(-) M(x) Y(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give me good coverage of common letters and positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word at all (x).
- L is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- T is not in the word (x).
- E is not in the word (x).

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: S, T, E.
- Letters we must use somewhere: L and A.
- L cannot be in position 2.
- A cannot be in position 3.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains L and A.
- Does not contain S, T, or E.
- Has L not in position 2.
- Has A not in position 3.

Possible positions for L: 1, 3, 4, 5.
Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.

Let me think of words that fit these constraints. One approach is to look for words with common remaining consonants (R, N, C, D, etc.) and vowels (I, O, U).

A good candidate is ""FLANK"":
- Contains L and A.
- L is in position 2 (but feedback says L is not in position 2). Oops, that violates the constraint.

Next candidate: ""CLAMP"":
- Contains L and A.
- L is in position 2 again. Not good.

Next candidate: ""PLANK"":
- Contains L and A.
- L is in position 2. Not good.

Next candidate: ""ALARM"":
- Contains A and L.
- A is in position 1 (allowed), L is in position 2 (not allowed).

Next candidate: ""CLANG"":
- Contains L and A.
- L is in position 2. Not good.

Next candidate: ""BLAND"":
- Contains L and A.
- L is in position 2. Not good.

Next candidate: ""GLAND"":
- Contains L and A.
- L is in position 2. Not good.

Next candidate: ""PLAID"":
- Contains A and L.
- A is in position 2 (allowed), L is in position 3 (allowed).
- Does not contain S, T, E.
This seems valid.

Let me verify:
- Letters: P, L, A, I, D.
- Contains L (position 3) and A (position 2).
- No S, T, E.
- L not in position 2 (it's in 3), A not in position 3 (it's in 2).

""PLAID"" looks like a solid second guess.

From the two guesses so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - S, T, E are not in the word.
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. PLAID → P(✓) L(-) A(-) I(x) D(x)
   - P is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
   - L is in the word but not in position 2 (confirmed again).
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (confirmed again).
   - I and D are not in the word.

So we now know:
- The word starts with P.
- It contains L and A, but:
  - L is not in position 2.
  - A is not in position 3.
- Letters to avoid: S, T, E, I, D.

Remaining positions: 2, 3, 4, 5.
We need to place L and A in these positions while avoiding the forbidden spots.

Possible positions for L: 3, 4, 5 (cannot be 2).
Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5 (cannot be 3).

Let's think of words starting with P, containing L and A, avoiding the forbidden letters and positions.

Candidate words:
- PLANK: L in 2 (forbidden) → no.
- PLAZA: Z is uncommon, but let's check: P L A Z A. L is in 2 (forbidden) → no.
- PLACE: E is forbidden → no.
- PLAID: already guessed → no.
- PLANT: T is forbidden → no.
- PLAGU: not a valid word.
- PLASM: S is forbidden → no.
- PLANK: already considered.

- Position 5: L, then A can be 2, 3, 4 (but 3 is forbidden for A).

Let's try:
- P A L _ _: A in 2, L in 3. Word: PAL??.
  - Possible: PALMY (Y is allowed), but Y is uncommon.
  - PALMY: letters P,A,L,M,Y. Contains L (3) and A (2), no forbidden letters. Seems valid.

Another option:
- P _ A L _: A in 3 is forbidden, so skip.
- P _ _ A L: A in 4, L in 5. Word: P??AL.
  - Possible: PUNCH (no), PRANK (K is allowed), but R and N are good consonants.
  - PRANK: P R A N K. Contains A (3) but A cannot be in 3 → invalid.
  - P R A L _: but A is in 3 → invalid.
  - P R A M B: not valid.
  - P R A M E: E is forbidden.
  - P R A M I: I is forbidden.
  - P R A M O: O is allowed. Word: PRAMO? Not a common word.

Another approach: P _ _ _ _ with L and A in remaining positions.
Let's try:
- P A _ L _: A in 2, L in 4. Word: P A ? L ?.
  - Possible: P A N L Y (not a word), P A R L Y (valid: PARLY is archaic but listed).
  - P A R L Y: P(✓), A(2), R(?), L(4), Y(?). Contains A and L, no forbidden letters.

But PARLY is obscure. Let's think of more common words.

Alternative: P _ A _ L: A in 3 is forbidden, so skip.

Another: P _ _ A L: A in 4, L in 5. Word: P ? ? A L.
  - Possible: P U N A L (valid: PUNAL is a variant of PUNA, but rare).
  - P R O A L: not a word.

   - P and A are now fixed in positions 1 and 2
   - L is in the word but not in position 3
   - M and Y are absent

Current knowledge:
- Word pattern: P A _ _ _
- Must contain L somewhere in positions 4 or 5 (since 2 is forbidden for L and 3 is now known to be non-L from PALMY feedback)
- Letters still allowed: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, N, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Z
- Forbidden letters: S, T, E, I, D, M, Y

Possible positions for L: 4 or 5

Let's list valid 5-letter words starting with PA, containing L in position 4 or 5, and using only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- P A N L _ : Need a 5th letter. PANL? Not a word.
- P A R L _ : PARLO (archaic), PARLY (archaic), PARLS (invalid - S forbidden)
- P A C K L: Not a word.

- P A R K Y: Y is forbidden.

Wait, let's think differently. We need words starting with PA, with L in position 4 or 5, and no forbidden letters.

Looking at position 4:
- P A _ L _: 3rd letter must be allowed, 5th letter must be allowed.
Possible 3rd letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, N, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Z
Possible 5th letters: same set.

Let's try:

- P A R K L: Not a word.
- P A R K Y: Y is forbidden.
- P A R K S: S is forbidden.
- P A R K E: E is forbidden.
- P A R K I: I is forbidden.
- P A R K T: T is forbidden.
- P A R K D: D is forbidden.
- P A R K M: M is forbidden.

- P A R K U: Not a word.
- P A R K V: Not a word.
- P A R K W: Not a word.
- P A R K X: Not a word.
- P A R K Z: Not a word.

This is tricky. Maybe I need to consider that L is in position 4.

Looking at position 4:
- P A _ L _: 3rd letter must be allowed, 5th letter must be allowed.
Possible words:
- P A N L _: Not a word.
- P A R L _: PARLY (archaic), PARLO (archaic).
- P A C L _: Not a word.
- P A F L _: Not a word.
- P A G L _: Not a word.
- P A H L _: Not a word.
- P A J L _: Not a word.
- P A K L _: Not a word.
- P A N L _: Not a word.
- P A O L _: Not a word.
- P A Q L _: Not a word.
- P A R L _: PARLY (archaic), PARLO (archaic).
- P A U L _: Not a word.
- P A V L _: Not a word.
- P A W L _: Not a word.
- P A X L _: Not a word.
- P A Z L _: Not a word.

PARLY is listed in some dictionaries as an archaic word meaning to parley, but it's rare. PARLO is not a standard word.

Given the constraints, PARLY seems to be the only possible word, even if it's archaic.

But let me think of more common words. Maybe P A R K L is not a word, but P A R K Y is not valid due to Y.

Wait, let's try:
- P A R K L: Not a word.
- P A R K Y: Y is forbidden.
- P A R K S: S is forbidden.
- P A R K E: E is forbidden.
- P A R K I: I is forbidden.
- P A R K T: T is forbidden.
- P A R K D: D is forbidden.
- P A R K M: M is forbidden.

- P A R K V: Not a word.
- P A R K W: Not a word.
- P A R K X: Not a word.
- P A R K Z: Not a word.

This seems impossible. Maybe I missed a word. Let me think differently.

Looking at position 5:
- P A _ _ L: 3rd and 4th letters must be allowed.
Possible words:
- P A N K L: Not a word.

- P A N U L: Not a word.
- P A N V L: Not a word.
- P A N W L: Not a word.
- P A N X L: Not a word.
- P A N Z L: Not a word.

This is very restrictive. The only possible word seems to be PARLY, even if it's archaic.

Given the constraints, I'll proceed with PARLY as the next guess, even if it's not common.

</think>

From the feedback so far, we know:
- The word starts with PA (positions 1 and 2 are fixed).
- It must contain L, and L cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (since it was marked ""-"" in positions 2, 3, and 4 across guesses). This leaves only position 5 for L.
- Forbidden letters: S, T, E, I, D, M, Y.

Thus, the word must be P A _ _ L. The only remaining letters allowed are from {B, C, F, G, H, J, K, N, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Z}. 

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting P A _ _ L:
- P A R K L (not a word)
- P A N K L (not a word)
- P A R B L (not a word)

- P A R W L (not a word)
- P A R X L (not a word)

The only plausible word fitting these constraints is ""PARLY"" (archaic for parley), even though it's uncommon.

PARLY is listed in some dictionaries as an archaic word meaning to parley, but it's rare. PARLO is not a standard word.

Given the constraints, PARLY seems to be the only possible word, even if it's archaic.

But let me think of more common words. Maybe P A R K L is not a word, but P A R K Y is not valid due to Y.

<guess>PARLY</guess>From the feedback so far, we know:

- Forbidden letters: S, T, E, I, D, M, Y.

Thus, the word must be P A _ _ L. The only remaining letters allowed are from {B, C, F, G, H, J, K, N, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Z}.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give me good coverage of common letters and positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word at all (x).
- L is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- T is not in the word (x).
- E is not in the word (x).

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: S, T, E.
- Letters we must use somewhere: L and A.
- L cannot be in position 2.
- A cannot be in position 3.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains L and A.
- Does not contain S, T, or E.
- Has L not in position 2.
- Has A not in position 3.

Possible positions for L: 1, 3, 4, 5.
Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.

Let me think of words that fit these constraints. One approach is to look for words with common remaining consonants (R, N, C, D, etc.) and vowels (I, O, U).

A good candidate is ""FLANK"":
- Contains L and A.
- L is in position 2 (but feedback says L is not in position 2). Oops, that violates the constraint.

Next candidate: ""CLAMP"":
- Contains L and A.
- L is in position 2 again. Not good.

Next candidate: ""PLANK"":
- Contains L and A.
- L is in position 2. Not good.

Next candidate: ""ALARM"":
- Contains A and L.
- A is in position 1 (allowed), L is in position 2 (not allowed).

Next candidate: ""CLANG"":
- Contains L and A.
- L is in position 2. Not good.

Next candidate: ""BLAND"":
- Contains L and A.
- L is in position 2. Not good.

Next candidate: ""GLAND"":
- Contains L and A.
- L is in position 2. Not good.

Next candidate: ""PLAID"":
- Contains A and L.
- A is in position 2 (allowed), L is in position 3 (allowed).
- Does not contain S, T, E.
This seems valid.

Let me verify:
- Letters: P, L, A, I, D.
- Contains L (position 3) and A (position 2).
- No S, T, E.
- L not in position 2 (it's in 3), A not in position 3 (it's in 2).

""PLAID"" looks like a solid second guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: PLAID -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) L(-) A(-) I(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - S, T, E are not in the word.
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. PLAID → P(✓) L(-) A(-) I(x) D(x)
   - P is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
   - L is in the word but not in position 2 (confirmed again).
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (confirmed again).
   - I and D are not in the word.

So we now know:
- The word starts with P.
- It contains L and A, but:
  - L is not in position 2.
  - A is not in position 3.
- Letters to avoid: S, T, E, I, D.

Remaining positions: 2, 3, 4, 5.
We need to place L and A in these positions while avoiding the forbidden spots.

Possible positions for L: 3, 4, 5 (cannot be 2).
Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5 (cannot be 3).

Let's think of words starting with P, containing L and A, avoiding the forbidden letters and positions.

Candidate words:
- PLANK: L in 2 (forbidden) → no.
- PLAZA: Z is uncommon, but let's check: P L A Z A. L is in 2 (forbidden) → no.
- PLACE: E is forbidden → no.
- PLAID: already guessed → no.
- PLANT: T is forbidden → no.
- PLAGU: not a valid word.
- PLASM: S is forbidden → no.
- PLANK: already considered.

Wait, let's think differently. Maybe L is in position 3 or 4 or 5, and A is in 2 or 4 or 5.

Possible combinations:
- Position 3: L, then A can be 2, 4, 5.
- Position 4: L, then A can be 2, 3, 5 (but 3 is forbidden for A).
- Position 5: L, then A can be 2, 3, 4 (but 3 is forbidden for A).

Let's try:
- P A L _ _: A in 2, L in 3. Word: PAL??.
  - Possible: PALMY (Y is allowed), but Y is uncommon.
  - PALMY: letters P,A,L,M,Y. Contains L (3) and A (2), no forbidden letters. Seems valid.

Another option:
- P _ A L _: A in 3 is forbidden, so skip.
- P _ _ A L: A in 4, L in 5. Word: P??AL.
  - Possible: PUNCH (no), PRANK (K is allowed), but R and N are good consonants.
  - PRANK: P R A N K. Contains A (3) but A cannot be in 3 → invalid.
  - P R A L _: but A is in 3 → invalid.
  - P R A M B: not valid.
  - P R A M E: E is forbidden.
  - P R A M I: I is forbidden.
  - P R A M O: O is allowed. Word: PRAMO? Not a common word.

Another approach: P _ _ _ _ with L and A in remaining positions.
Let's try:
- P A _ L _: A in 2, L in 4. Word: P A ? L ?.
  - Possible: P A N L Y (not a word), P A R L Y (valid: PARLY is archaic but listed).
  - P A R L Y: P(✓), A(2), R(?), L(4), Y(?). Contains A and L, no forbidden letters.

But PARLY is obscure. Let's think of more common words.

Alternative: P _ A _ L: A in 3 is forbidden, so skip.

Another: P _ _ A L: A in 4, L in 5. Word: P ? ? A L.
  - Possible: P U N A L (valid: PUNAL is a variant of PUNA, but rare).
  - P R O A L: not a word.

Wait, let's try:
- P A L _ _: A in 2, L in 3. Word: P A L ? ?.
  - PALMY: P A L M Y. Valid word, contains A and L, no forbidden letters.

This seems the best so far.

Another candidate: P A L M Y vs P A R L Y vs P U N A L.

PALMY is more common and straightforward.

Let's verify:
- P A L M Y:
  - Starts with P (correct position).
  - Contains A (position 2, allowed) and L (position 3, allowed).
  - No S, T, E, I, D.
  - L is not in position 2 (it's in 3) – satisfies feedback.
  - A is not in position 3 (it's in 2) – satisfies feedback.

Thus, ""PALMY"" is a strong next guess.

   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (confirms SLATE)
   - I and D are absent

3. PALMY → P(✓) A(✓) L(-) M(x) Y(x)
   - P and A are now fixed in positions 1 and 2
   - L is in the word but not in position 3
   - M and Y are absent

Current knowledge:
- Word pattern: P A _ _ _
- Must contain L somewhere in positions 4 or 5 (since 2 is forbidden for L and 3 is now known to be non-L from PALMY feedback)
- Letters still allowed: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, N, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Z
- Forbidden letters: S, T, E, I, D, M, Y

Possible positions for L: 4 or 5

Let's list valid 5-letter words starting with PA, containing L in position 4 or 5, and using only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- P A N L _ : Need a 5th letter. PANL? Not a word.
- P A R L _ : PARLO (archaic), PARLY (archaic), PARLS (invalid - S forbidden)
- P A C K L: Not a word.
- P A R K L: Not a word.
- P A N G L: Not a word.
- P A R T L: T is forbidden.
- P A R K Y: Y is forbidden.
- P A R K S: S is forbidden.
- P A R K E: E is forbidden.
- P A R K I: I is forbidden.
- P A R K O: O is allowed. P A R K O is not a word.
- P A R K U: Not a word.
- P A R K H: Not a word.
- P A R K N: Not a word.
- P A R K B: Not a word.
- P A R K G: Not a word.
- P A R K D: D is forbidden.
- P A R K L: P A R K L is not a word.
- P A R K Y: Y is forbidden.

Wait, let's think differently. We need words starting with PA, with L in position 4 or 5, and no forbidden letters.

Looking at position 4:
- P A _ L _: 3rd letter must be allowed, 5th letter must be allowed.
Possible 3rd letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, N, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Z
Possible 5th letters: same set.

Let's try:
- P A R L Y: Y is forbidden.
- P A R L O: P A R L O is not a word.
- P A R L E: E is forbidden.
- P A R L I: I is forbidden.
- P A R L U: P A R L U is not a word.
- P A R L K: P A R L K is not a word.
- P A R L B: Not a word.
- P A R L N: Not a word.
- P A R L G: Not a word.
- P A R L H: Not a word.
- P A R L O: Not a word.
- P A R L U: Not a word.

Looking at position 5:
- P A _ _ L: 3rd and 4th letters must be allowed.
Possible combinations:
- P A N K L: Not a word.
- P A N G L: Not a word.
- P A N D L: D is forbidden.
- P A N T L: T is forbidden.
- P A N G L: Not a word.
- P A R K L: Not a word.
- P A R B L: Not a word.
- P A R C L: Not a word.
- P A R F L: Not a word.
- P A R G L: Not a word.
- P A R H L: Not a word.
- P A R J L: Not a word.
- P A R K L: Not a word.
- P A R N L: Not a word.
- P A R O L: P A R O L is not a word.
- P A R U L: Not a word.
- P A R V L: Not a word.
- P A R W L: Not a word.
- P A R X L: Not a word.
- P A R Z L: Not a word.

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think of actual words starting with PA, containing L, and no forbidden letters.

Valid words:
- P A R K L: Not a word.
- P A R K Y: Y is forbidden.
- P A R K S: S is forbidden.
- P A R K E: E is forbidden.
- P A R K I: I is forbidden.
- P A R K T: T is forbidden.
- P A R K D: D is forbidden.
- P A R K M: M is forbidden.
- P A R K Y: Y is forbidden.
- P A R K N: Not a word.
- P A R K B: Not a word.
- P A R K G: Not a word.
- P A R K H: Not a word.
- P A R K J: Not a word.
- P A R K K: Not a word.
- P A R K L: Not a word.
- P A R K O: Not a word.
- P A R K R: Not a word.
- P A R K U: Not a word.
- P A R K V: Not a word.
- P A R K W: Not a word.
- P A R K X: Not a word.
- P A R K Z: Not a word.

Wait, let's think of actual English words:
- P A R K L: Not a word.
- P A R K Y: Y is forbidden.
- P A R K S: S is forbidden.
- P A R K E: E is forbidden.
- P A R K I: I is forbidden.
- P A R K T: T is forbidden.
- P A R K D: D is forbidden.
- P A R K M: M is forbidden.
- P A R K N: Not a word.
- P A R K B: Not a word.
- P A R K G: Not a word.
- P A R K H: Not a word.
- P A R K J: Not a word.
- P A R K K: Not a word.
- P A R K L: Not a word.
- P A R K O: Not a word.
- P A R K R: Not a word.
- P A R K U: Not a word.
- P A R K V: Not a word.
- P A R K W: Not a word.
- P A R K X: Not a word.
- P A R K Z: Not a word.

This is tricky. Maybe I need to consider that L is in position 4.

Looking at position 4:
- P A _ L _: 3rd letter must be allowed, 5th letter must be allowed.
Possible words:
- P A N L _: Not a word.
- P A R L _: PARLY (archaic), PARLO (archaic).
- P A C L _: Not a word.
- P A F L _: Not a word.
- P A G L _: Not a word.
- P A H L _: Not a word.
- P A J L _: Not a word.
- P A K L _: Not a word.
- P A N L _: Not a word.
- P A O L _: Not a word.
- P A Q L _: Not a word.
- P A R L _: PARLY (archaic), PARLO (archaic).
- P A U L _: Not a word.
- P A V L _: Not a word.
- P A W L _: Not a word.
- P A X L _: Not a word.
- P A Z L _: Not a word.

PARLY is listed in some dictionaries as an archaic word meaning to parley, but it's rare. PARLO is not a standard word.

Given the constraints, PARLY seems to be the only possible word, even if it's archaic.

But let me think of more common words. Maybe P A R K L is not a word, but P A R K Y is not valid due to Y.

Wait, let's try:
- P A R K L: Not a word.
- P A R K Y: Y is forbidden.
- P A R K S: S is forbidden.
- P A R K E: E is forbidden.
- P A R K I: I is forbidden.
- P A R K T: T is forbidden.
- P A R K D: D is forbidden.
- P A R K M: M is forbidden.
- P A R K N: Not a word.
- P A R K B: Not a word.
- P A R K G: Not a word.
- P A R K H: Not a word.
- P A R K J: Not a word.
- P A R K K: Not a word.
- P A R K L: Not a word.
- P A R K O: Not a word.
- P A R K R: Not a word.
- P A R K U: Not a word.
- P A R K V: Not a word.
- P A R K W: Not a word.
- P A R K X: Not a word.
- P A R K Z: Not a word.

This seems impossible. Maybe I missed a word. Let me think differently.

Looking at position 5:
- P A _ _ L: 3rd and 4th letters must be allowed.
Possible words:
- P A N K L: Not a word.
- P A N G L: Not a word.
- P A N D L: D is forbidden.
- P A N T L: T is forbidden.
- P A N G L: Not a word.
- P A N B L: Not a word.
- P A N C L: Not a word.
- P A N F L: Not a word.
- P A N G L: Not a word.
- P A N H L: Not a word.
- P A N J L: Not a word.
- P A N K L: Not a word.
- P A N L _: Not a word.
- P A N O L: Not a word.
- P A N R L: Not a word.
- P A N U L: Not a word.
- P A N V L: Not a word.
- P A N W L: Not a word.
- P A N X L: Not a word.
- P A N Z L: Not a word.

This is very restrictive. The only possible word seems to be PARLY, even if it's archaic.

Given the constraints, I'll proceed with PARLY as the next guess, even if it's not common.

<guess>PARLY</guess>From the feedback so far, we know:
- The word starts with PA (positions 1 and 2 are fixed).
- It must contain L, and L cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (since it was marked ""-"" in positions 2, 3, and 4 across guesses). This leaves only position 5 for L.
- Forbidden letters: S, T, E, I, D, M, Y.

Thus, the word must be P A _ _ L. The only remaining letters allowed are from {B, C, F, G, H, J, K, N, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Z}. 

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting P A _ _ L:
- P A R K L (not a word)
- P A N K L (not a word)
- P A R B L (not a word)
- P A R C L (not a word)
- P A R F L (not a word)
- P A R G L (not a word)
- P A R H L (not a word)
- P A R J L (not a word)
- P A R K L (not a word)
- P A R N L (not a word)
- P A R O L (not a word)
- P A R U L (not a word)
- P A R V L (not a word)
- P A R W L (not a word)
- P A R X L (not a word)
- P A R Z L (not a word)

The only plausible word fitting these constraints is ""PARLY"" (archaic for parley), even though it's uncommon.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give me good coverage of common letters and positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word at all (x).
- L is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- T is not in the word (x).
- E is not in the word (x).

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: S, T, E.
- Letters we must use somewhere: L and A.
- L cannot be in position 2.
- A cannot be in position 3.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains L and A.
- Does not contain S, T, or E.
- Has L not in position 2.
- Has A not in position 3.

Possible positions for L: 1, 3, 4, 5.
Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.

Let me think of words that fit these constraints. One approach is to look for words with common remaining consonants (R, N, C, D, etc.) and vowels (I, O, U).

A good candidate is ""FLANK"":
- Contains L and A.
- L is in position 2 (but feedback says L is not in position 2). Oops, that violates the constraint.

Next candidate: ""CLAMP"":
- Contains L and A.
- L is in position 2 again. Not good.

Next candidate: ""PLANK"":
- Contains L and A.
- L is in position 2. Not good.

Next candidate: ""ALARM"":
- Contains A and L.
- A is in position 1 (allowed), L is in position 2 (not allowed).

Next candidate: ""CLANG"":
- Contains L and A.
- L is in position 2. Not good.

Next candidate: ""BLAND"":
- Contains L and A.
- L is in position 2. Not good.

Next candidate: ""GLAND"":
- Contains L and A.
- L is in position 2. Not good.

Next candidate: ""PLAID"":
- Contains A and L.
- A is in position 2 (allowed), L is in position 3 (allowed).
- Does not contain S, T, E.
This seems valid.

Let me verify:
- Letters: P, L, A, I, D.
- Contains L (position 3) and A (position 2).
- No S, T, E.
- L not in position 2 (it's in 3), A not in position 3 (it's in 2).

""PLAID"" looks like a solid second guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: PLAID -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) L(-) A(-) I(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - S, T, E are not in the word.
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. PLAID → P(✓) L(-) A(-) I(x) D(x)
   - P is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
   - L is in the word but not in position 2 (confirmed again).
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (confirmed again).
   - I and D are not in the word.

So we now know:
- The word starts with P.
- It contains L and A, but:
  - L is not in position 2.
  - A is not in position 3.
- Letters to avoid: S, T, E, I, D.

Remaining positions: 2, 3, 4, 5.
We need to place L and A in these positions while avoiding the forbidden spots.

Possible positions for L: 3, 4, 5 (cannot be 2).
Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5 (cannot be 3).

Let's think of words starting with P, containing L and A, avoiding the forbidden letters and positions.

Candidate words:
- PLANK: L in 2 (forbidden) → no.
- PLAZA: Z is uncommon, but let's check: P L A Z A. L is in 2 (forbidden) → no.
- PLACE: E is forbidden → no.
- PLAID: already guessed → no.
- PLANT: T is forbidden → no.
- PLAGU: not a valid word.
- PLASM: S is forbidden → no.
- PLANK: already considered.

Wait, let's think differently. Maybe L is in position 3 or 4 or 5, and A is in 2 or 4 or 5.

Possible combinations:
- Position 3: L, then A can be 2, 4, 5.
- Position 4: L, then A can be 2, 3, 5 (but 3 is forbidden for A).
- Position 5: L, then A can be 2, 3, 4 (but 3 is forbidden for A).

Let's try:
- P A L _ _: A in 2, L in 3. Word: PAL??.
  - Possible: PALMY (Y is allowed), but Y is uncommon.
  - PALMY: letters P,A,L,M,Y. Contains L (3) and A (2), no forbidden letters. Seems valid.

Another option:
- P _ A L _: A in 3 is forbidden, so skip.
- P _ _ A L: A in 4, L in 5. Word: P??AL.
  - Possible: PUNCH (no), PRANK (K is allowed), but R and N are good consonants.
  - PRANK: P R A N K. Contains A (3) but A cannot be in 3 → invalid.
  - P R A L _: but A is in 3 → invalid.
  - P R A M B: not valid.
  - P R A M E: E is forbidden.
  - P R A M I: I is forbidden.
  - P R A M O: O is allowed. Word: PRAMO? Not a common word.

Another approach: P _ _ _ _ with L and A in remaining positions.
Let's try:
- P A _ L _: A in 2, L in 4. Word: P A ? L ?.
  - Possible: P A N L Y (not a word), P A R L Y (valid: PARLY is archaic but listed).
  - P A R L Y: P(✓), A(2), R(?), L(4), Y(?). Contains A and L, no forbidden letters.

But PARLY is obscure. Let's think of more common words.

Alternative: P _ A _ L: A in 3 is forbidden, so skip.

Another: P _ _ A L: A in 4, L in 5. Word: P ? ? A L.
  - Possible: P U N A L (valid: PUNAL is a variant of PUNA, but rare).
  - P R O A L: not a word.

Wait, let's try:
- P A L _ _: A in 2, L in 3. Word: P A L ? ?.
  - PALMY: P A L M Y. Valid word, contains A and L, no forbidden letters.

This seems the best so far.

Another candidate: P A L M Y vs P A R L Y vs P U N A L.

PALMY is more common and straightforward.

Let's verify:
- P A L M Y:
  - Starts with P (correct position).
  - Contains A (position 2, allowed) and L (position 3, allowed).
  - No S, T, E, I, D.
  - L is not in position 2 (it's in 3) – satisfies feedback.
  - A is not in position 3 (it's in 2) – satisfies feedback.

Thus, ""PALMY"" is a strong next guess.

- P A R K H: Not a word.

- P A R K U: Not a word.
- P A R K V: Not a word.
- P A R K W: Not a word.
- P A R K X: Not a word.
- P A R K Z: Not a word.

This is tricky. Maybe I need to consider that L is in position 4.

Looking at position 4:
- P A _ L _: 3rd letter must be allowed, 5th letter must be allowed.
Possible words:
- P A N L _: Not a word.
- P A R L _: PARLY (archaic), PARLO (archaic).
- P A C L _: Not a word.
- P A F L _: Not a word.
- P A G L _: Not a word.
- P A H L _: Not a word.
- P A J L _: Not a word.
- P A K L _: Not a word.
- P A N L _: Not a word.
- P A O L _: Not a word.
- P A Q L _: Not a word.
- P A R L _: PARLY (archaic), PARLO (archaic).
- P A U L _: Not a word.
- P A V L _: Not a word.
- P A W L _: Not a word.
- P A X L _: Not a word.
- P A Z L _: Not a word.

PARLY is listed in some dictionaries as an archaic word meaning to parley, but it's rare. PARLO is not a standard word.

Given the constraints, PARLY seems to be the only possible word, even if it's archaic.

But let me think of more common words. Maybe P A R K L is not a word, but P A R K Y is not valid due to Y.

Wait, let's try:
- P A R K L: Not a word.
- P A R K Y: Y is forbidden.
- P A R K S: S is forbidden.
- P A R K E: E is forbidden.
- P A R K I: I is forbidden.
- P A R K T: T is forbidden.
- P A R K D: D is forbidden.
- P A R K M: M is forbidden.
- P A R K N: Not a word.
- P A R K B: Not a word.
- P A R K G: Not a word.
- P A R K H: Not a word.
- P A R K J: Not a word.
- P A R K K: Not a word.
- P A R K L: Not a word.
- P A R K O: Not a word.
- P A R K R: Not a word.
- P A R K U: Not a word.
- P A R K V: Not a word.
- P A R K W: Not a word.
- P A R K X: Not a word.
- P A R K Z: Not a word.

This seems impossible. Maybe I missed a word. Let me think differently.

Looking at position 5:
- P A _ _ L: 3rd and 4th letters must be allowed.
Possible words:
- P A N K L: Not a word.
- P A N G L: Not a word.
- P A N D L: D is forbidden.
- P A N T L: T is forbidden.
- P A N G L: Not a word.
- P A N B L: Not a word.
- P A N C L: Not a word.
- P A N F L: Not a word.
- P A N G L: Not a word.
- P A N H L: Not a word.
- P A N J L: Not a word.
- P A N K L: Not a word.
- P A N L _: Not a word.
- P A N O L: Not a word.
- P A N R L: Not a word.
- P A N U L: Not a word.
- P A N V L: Not a word.
- P A N W L: Not a word.
- P A N X L: Not a word.
- P A N Z L: Not a word.

This is very restrictive. The only possible word seems to be PARLY, even if it's archaic.

Given the constraints, I'll proceed with PARLY as the next guess, even if it's not common.

<guess>PARLY</guess>From the feedback so far, we know:
- The word starts with PA (positions 1 and 2 are fixed).
- It must contain L, and L cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (since it was marked ""-"" in positions 2, 3, and 4 across guesses). This leaves only position 5 for L.
- Forbidden letters: S, T, E, I, D, M, Y.

Thus, the word must be P A _ _ L. The only remaining letters allowed are from {B, C, F, G, H, J, K, N, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Z}. 

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting P A _ _ L:
- P A R K L (not a word)
- P A N K L (not a word)
- P A R B L (not a word)
- P A R C L (not a word)
- P A R F L (not a word)
- P A R G L (not a word)
- P A R H L (not a word)
- P A R J L (not a word)
- P A R K L (not a word)
- P A R N L (not a word)
- P A R O L (not a word)
- P A R U L (not a word)
- P A R V L (not a word)
- P A R W L (not a word)
- P A R X L (not a word)
- P A R Z L (not a word)

The only plausible word fitting these constraints is ""PARLY"" (archaic for parley), even though it's uncommon.

From the latest feedback (PARLY → P(✓) A(✓) R(x) L(✓) Y(x)) we now know:

1. P is fixed in position 1.
2. A is fixed in position 2.
3. L is fixed in position 4.
4. R is not in the word at all.
5. Y is not in the word at all.

Forbidden letters so far: S, T, E, I, D, M, Y, R.

The pattern is now: P A _ L _

We need to fill the 3rd and 5th positions with letters not yet ruled out. Allowed letters (excluding the forbidden ones) include: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter English words that fit P A _ L _:

- P A N L _ → PAN?L (none)
- P A C L _ → PAC?L (none)
- P A B L _ → PAB?L (none)
- P A F L _ → PAF?L (none)
- P A G L _ → PAG?L (none)
- P A H L _ → PAH?L (none)
- P A J L _ → PAJ?L (none)
- P A K L _ → PAK?L (none)
- P A N L _ → PAN?L (none)
- P A O L _ → PAO?L (none)
- P A Q L _ → PAQ?L (none)
- P A U L _ → PAU?L (none)
- P A V L _ → PAU?L (none)
- P A W L _ → PAW?L (none)
- P A X L _ → PAX?L (none)
- P A Z L _ → PAZ?L (none)

The only common word that fits is ""PAVLO"" (a name, but sometimes accepted), but it's not a standard word. Another possibility is ""PAKAL"" (a historical figure), but it's also obscure.

Looking again, ""PAKAL"" is a valid word (the Maya ruler). However, let's check if it uses allowed letters: P, A, K, A, L. All letters are allowed (K is not forbidden).

Another candidate: ""PAKAL"" fits P A _ L _ with K in position 3 and A in position 5.

Let me verify:
- P A K A L: P(✓), A(✓), K(?), A(?), L(✓).
- Letters used: P, A, K, L. None are forbidden except K is new.
- This seems to be the only plausible word left.

Thus, the next guess is PAKAL.

The only possible word seems to be PARLY, even if it\'s archaic.\n\nGiven the constraints, I\'ll proceed with PARLY as the next guess, even if it\'s not common.\n\n<guess>PARLY</guess>From the feedback so far, we know:\n- The word starts with PA (positions 1 and 2 are fixed).\n- It must contain L, and L cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (since it was marked ""-"" in positions 2, 3, and 4 across guesses). This leaves only position 5 for L.\n- Forbidden letters: S, T, E, I, D, M, Y.\n\nThus, the word must be P A _ _ L.

From the latest feedback (PAKAL → P(✓) A(✓) K(x) A(-) L(-)) we now know:

1. P is fixed in position 1.
2. A is fixed in position 2.
3. K is not in the word at all.
4. A is in the word but not in position 4 (it was marked ""-"" in position 4).
5. L is in the word but not in position 5 (it was marked ""-"" in position 5).

Forbidden letters so far: S, T, E, I, D, M, Y, R, K.

Current pattern: P A _ L _  (from PARLY feedback)
But A must also be in the word, and it cannot be in position 4 (from PAKAL feedback). However, position 4 is already L, so A must be in position 3 or 5.

But the pattern is P A _ L _, so position 3 is open, and position 5 is open. We need to place A somewhere in the word. The only remaining positions are 3 or 5.

So possible patterns:
- P A A L _  (A in position 3)
- P A _ L A  (A in position 5)

Looking for common 5-letter words:

1. P A A L _ → PAA?L (none)
2. P A _ L A → P A ? L A

Allowed letters for position 3: B, C, F, G, H, J, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (excluding forbidden ones).

Looking for words:
- P A N L A → PANLA (not a word)
- P A C L A → PACLA (not a word)
- P A B L A → PABLA (not a word)
- P A F L A → PAF?A (not a word)
- P A G L A → PAGLA (not a word)
- P A H L A → PAH?A (not a word)
- P A J L A → PAJ?A (not a word)
- P A N L A → PANLA (not a word)
- P A O L A → PAO?A (not a word)
- P A Q L A → PAQ?A (not a word)
- P A U L A → PAU?A (not a word)
- P A V L A → PAU?A (not a word)
- P A W L A → PAW?A (not a word)
- P A X L A → PAX?A (not a word)
- P A Z L A → PAZ?A (not a word)

The only plausible word seems to be ""PAVLA"" (a variant of PAVLO), but it's not standard. Another possibility is ""PAKAL"" already tried.

Wait, let me re-examine the pattern. From PARLY we have P A _ L _, and from PAKAL we know A must be in the word but not in position 4 (already L), so A must be in position 3 or 5.

Thus possible words:
- P A A L _ → PAA?L (none)
- P A _ L A → P A ? L A

Looking at P A _ L A, the only common word is ""PAWLA"" (a type of toy), but W is allowed.

""PAWLA"" uses P, A, W, L, A. All letters are allowed (W not forbidden).

Thus, the next guess is PAWLA.
