For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (the most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance to hit multiple letters in the secret word right away. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
1. Contains the letter A, but not in position 3.
2. Does NOT contain S, L, T, or E.

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has A somewhere other than the third position.
- Uses none of S, L, T, E.

Good consonants to try next: R, N, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good vowels: A (already used), O, I, U.

""CRANE"" would be bad because it has E.  
""RADIO"" has A and O and common consonants R, D, I, O.  
""GRAIN"" has A and common consonants G, R, N.  
""BRAND"" has A and common consonants B, R, N, D.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: S, L, T, E, I  
2. Letters that ARE in the word:
   - D is in the word and is in position 3 (✓).  
   - O is in the word and is in position 5 (✓).  
   - A is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (because it was “-” in both places).  
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 1 (because it was “-” in RADIO).

So the secret word looks like: _ _ D _ O  
with the constraints:
- A must appear somewhere (positions 1, 4, or 5).  
- R must appear somewhere (positions 2, 3, 4, or 5).  
- No S, L, T, E, I.

Available consonants (not yet ruled out): B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z  
Available vowels: A, U (O is already placed).

We need two more letters to fill positions 1, 2, 4 (since 3 and 5 are D and O).  
We already know A must appear once and R must appear once.

Let’s try to place A and R while using fresh common consonants.  
A good candidate is “MADRO” but O is already fixed at the end.  
Another candidate is “RADIO” but we already tried that.  

A valid word that fits: “CARDO” – but C is allowed, A is allowed, R is allowed, D and O are fixed.  
But “CARDO” is not a common English word.  

A better common word: “MADRO” is invalid.  
Try “RACON” – but N is allowed, but O is already in position 5.  

Let me think systematically:  
We need a 5-letter word ending in DO, containing A and R, with A not in 2 or 3, and R not in 1.  

Possible structure: A _ D _ O or _ A D _ O or _ _ D A O (but O is fixed at 5).  

So the word must be of the form _ _ D _ O with A and R inside.  

Let’s list possibilities:  
- A R D _ O → “ARDOR” – but R is in position 2 (allowed), A in 1 (allowed), D in 3 (✓), O in 5 (✓).  
  “ARDOR” is a valid English word (means “love”).  

Let me check constraints:  
- Letters used: A, R, D, O – all allowed.  
- No forbidden letters (S, L, T, E, I).  
- A is in position 1 (allowed).  
- R is in position 2 (allowed).

Thus, “ARDOR” is a strong candidate.

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)

- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (the most common vowel)

We already know A must appear once and R must appear once.

Let’s try to place A and R while using fresh common consonants.  
A good candidate is “MADRO” but O is already fixed at the end.  
Another candidate is “RADIO” but we already tried that.  

A valid word that fits: “CARDO” – but C is allowed, A is allowed, R is allowed, D and O are fixed.  
But “CARDO” is not a common English word.  

A better common word: “MADRO” is invalid.  
Try “RACON” – but N is allowed, but O is already in position 5.  

Let me think systematically:  
We need a 5-letter word ending in DO, containing A and R, with A not in 2 or 3, and R not in 1.  

Possible structure: A _ D _ O or _ A D _ O or _ _ D A O (but O is fixed at 5).  

So the word must be of the form _ _ D _ O with A and R inside.  

Let’s list possibilities:  
- A R D _ O → “ARDOR” – but R is in position 2 (allowed), A in 1 (allowed), D in 3 (✓), O in 5 (✓).  
  “ARDOR” is a valid English word (means “love”).  

Let me check constraints:  
- Letters used: A, R, D, O – all allowed.  
- No forbidden letters (S, L, T, E, I).  
- A is in position 1 (allowed).  
- R is in position 2 (allowed).  
- D in 3, O in 5 (matches feedback).  

Thus, “ARDOR” is a strong candidate.

Let's update what we now know after three guesses.

Known facts:
1. Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, I, O (from SLATE, RADIO, ARDOR feedback)
2. Positions that are fixed:
   - Position 1: A (✓ from ARDOR)
   - Position 3: D (✓ from RADIO)
   - Position 5: O (✓ from RADIO)
3. Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
   - R (was ""-"" in both RADIO and ARDOR, so R is in the word but not in positions 2, 4, or 5)
   - A (already fixed in position 1, so no need to place it again)

So the word structure is: A _ D _ O
with R somewhere inside positions 2 or 4 (since it can't be in 1,3,5).

Possible positions for R:
- Position 2: A R D _ O
- Position 4: A _ D R O

Now we need to find valid 5-letter English words fitting these patterns using only allowed letters (no S, L, T, E, I, O).

Looking at position 2 first (ARD__O):
- Common consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z
- Trying common letters: M, N, P, C, etc.

Possible words:
- A R D U O (but U is allowed, and ""ARDUO"" isn't valid)
- A R D G O (not a word)
- A R D M O (not a word)

Looking at position 4 first (A _ D R O):
- Need a valid letter for position 2
- Common letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z

Possible words:
- A M D R O (not a word)
- A N D R O (valid word: ANDRO - but this is a variant spelling, not common)
- A P D R O (not a word)
- A C D R O (not a word)
- A H D R O (not a word)
- A F D R O (not a word)
- A G D R O (not a word)
- A V D R O (not a word)
- A W D R O (not a word)
- A Y D R O (not a word)
- A Z D R O (not a word)

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. Let me reconsider.

Wait, maybe I missed some valid words. Let me think differently.

Actually, the word must be A _ D _ O with R in position 2 or 4, and no forbidden letters.

Looking at position 2 with R:
- A R D _ O
  - Need a valid letter for position 4
  - Common letters left: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z
  - Trying combinations:
    - A R D B O (not a word)
    - A R D C O (not a word)
    - A R D F O (not a word)
    - A R D G O (not a word)
    - A R D H O (not a word)
    - A R D K O (not a word)
    - A R D M O (not a word)
    - A R D N O (not a word)
    - A R D P O (not a word)
    - A R D V O (not a word)
    - A R D W O (not a word)
    - A R D Y O (not a word)
    - A R D Z O (not a word)

Looking at position 4 with R:
- A _ D R O
  - Need a valid letter for position 2
  - Common letters left: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z
  - Trying combinations:
    - A B D R O (not a word)
    - A C D R O (not a word)
    - A F D R O (not a word)
    - A G D R O (not a word)
    - A H D R O (not a word)
    - A K D R O (not a word)
    - A M D R O (not a word)
    - A N D R O (valid word: ANDRO - but this is a variant spelling, not common)
    - A P D R O (not a word)
    - A V D R O (not a word)
    - A W D R O (not a word)
    - A Y D R O (not a word)
    - A Z D R O (not a word)

It seems like ""ANDRO"" is the closest, but it's not a standard word. Let me think of other possibilities.

Wait, maybe ""AUGUR"" - but this doesn't fit the structure. 

Actually, looking back, I realize I might have missed some letters. Let me re-examine the allowed letters.

From the feedback:
- Forbidden letters: S, L, T, E, I, O (from SLATE, RADIO, ARDOR)
- Allowed letters: A, D, R, plus any other consonants not listed (B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z)

Given the structure A _ D _ O with R in position 2 or 4, and no forbidden letters, the only valid word seems to be ""ANDRO"" (though it's not common). 

But let me think of another approach - maybe ""AUGUR"" isn't right. 

Wait, actually, the word ""AUGUR"" doesn't fit the structure. 

Let me try ""AUROR"" - but this has two R's and doesn't fit.

I think the correct approach is to realize that ""ANDRO"" is actually a valid word (short for androgynous), though uncommon. 

Alternatively, maybe ""AUROR"" is acceptable, but it has two R's and doesn't fit the single R requirement.

Given the constraints, ""ANDRO"" seems to be the only possible word fitting the structure A _ D _ O with R in position 4 and no forbidden letters.

But let me double-check if ""ANDRO"" is valid - yes, it's listed in some dictionaries as a variant of ""androgyne"".

Thus, the next guess should be ""ANDRO"".
