### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular choices include words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AROSE,"" or ""ADIEU."" 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E
- ""AROSE"" has A, R, O, S, E
- ""ADIEU"" has A, D, I, E, U

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and can quickly help identify vowels and consonants.

All five letters in SLATE were marked “x”, so S, L, A, T, and E are **not** in the secret word at all.  
That eliminates a lot of common letters, so I need a fresh set of consonants and vowels.  
Good remaining frequent letters include R, I, N, O, U, C, H, M, P, D, etc.  
I’ll pick a word that uses several of these high-frequency letters we haven’t tried yet.  
A strong candidate is “CHORD”: C, H, O, R, D — none of these appeared in SLATE, and they’re all common in English 5-letter words.

A good next probe should introduce several new letters while testing H in a new spot.  
A word like “PHONY” uses P, H, O, N, Y — but O is already ruled out.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular choices include words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AROSE,"" or ""ADIEU."" 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E
- ""AROSE"" has A, R, O, S, E
- ""ADIEU"" has A, D, I, E, U

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and can quickly help identify vowels and consonants.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE were marked “x”, so S, L, A, T, and E are **not** in the secret word at all.  
That eliminates a lot of common letters, so I need a fresh set of consonants and vowels.  
Good remaining frequent letters include R, I, N, O, U, C, H, M, P, D, etc.  
I’ll pick a word that uses several of these high-frequency letters we haven’t tried yet.  
A strong candidate is “CHORD”: C, H, O, R, D — none of these appeared in SLATE, and they’re all common in English 5-letter words.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
So far we know:

- Letters **not** in the word at all: S, L, A, T, E, C, O, R, D  
- Letter **in the word but in the wrong position**: H (from CHORD)

That leaves the remaining common letters: B, F, G, I, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We still need to place the letter H somewhere else (not position 2) and use other fresh letters.  
A good next probe should introduce several new letters while testing H in a new spot.  
A word like “PHONY” uses P, H, O, N, Y — but O is already ruled out.  
Another candidate: “WHIMY” — W, H, I, M, Y. All letters are new except H, and we’ll test H in position 2 again (but we already know it’s not in position 2).  
Instead, let’s try “MINKY” — but that doesn’t use H.  
We must include H in a different position.  

Let’s try “HUMID”: H, U, M, I, D — but D is already ruled out.  
Next option: “BUNGH” — but G and B are new, and we can test H in position 5.  

However, “BUNGH” isn’t a valid English word.  
A valid word that uses H in a new position and introduces fresh letters: “BINGO” — but O is out.  
“WHIMP” — W, H, I, M, P. All new letters except H, and H is in position 2 again (still invalid).  

Let’s shift H to position 3: “MINCH” — but C is out.  
Shift H to position 4: “FUNKY” — no H.  
Shift H to position 5: “BUMPY” — no H.  

A valid word with H in position 5 and only new letters: “BUMPH” — but that’s not common.  
“FUNKY” lacks H.  

Let’s pick “WHIMY” even though H is in position 2 again, because we’re forced to test H somewhere.  
But we already know H is not in position 2.  

Better: “HUMPY” — H in position 1, new letters U, M, P, Y.  
This tests H in position 1 and introduces U, M, P, Y.  

Valid word: “HUMPY”.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular choices include words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AROSE,"" or ""ADIEU."" 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E
- ""AROSE"" has A, R, O, S, E
- ""ADIEU"" has A, D, I, E, U

However, “BUNGH” isn’t a valid English word.  
A valid word that uses H in a new position and introduces fresh letters: “BINGO” — but O is out.  
“WHIMP” — W, H, I, M, P. All new letters except H, and H is in position 2 again (still invalid).  

Let’s shift H to position 3: “MINCH” — but C is out.  
Shift H to position 4: “FUNKY” — no H.  
Shift H to position 5: “BUMPY” — no H.  

A valid word with H in position 5 and only new letters: “BUMPH” — but that’s not common.  
“FUNKY” lacks H.  

Let’s pick “WHIMY” even though H is in position 2 again, because we’re forced to test H somewhere.  
But we already know H is not in position 2.  

Better: “HUMPY” — H in position 1, new letters U, M, P, Y.  
This tests H in position 1 and introduces U, M, P, Y.  

Valid word: “HUMPY”.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters **not** in the word: S, L, A, T, E, C, O, R, D, M, P  
- Letters **confirmed in the word** and their positions:  
  – H is in position 1 (✓)  
  – U is in position 2 (✓)  
  – Y is in position 5 (✓)  

So the pattern so far is:  
H U _ _ Y  

We need to fill positions 3 and 4 with letters that have **not** yet been ruled out.  
Remaining common letters (not yet used or ruled out): B, F, G, I, K, N, V, W, etc.  

A quick scan of valid 5-letter English words matching “HU__Y” gives:

- HUMID – M is out  
- HUMOR – O and R are out  
- HUNNY – N and second N are allowed, but “HUNNY” is uncommon  
- HUBBY – B is allowed, and “HUBBY” is a common word  

“HUBBY” fits the pattern H U B B Y, uses only allowed letters (B is new), and is a valid word.  

Let’s go with “HUBBY”.

Current known facts:

- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, C, O, R, D, M, P, B
- Letters still allowed for positions 3 and 4: F, G, I, K, N, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter English word of the form H U ? ? Y where the two missing letters are from the still-allowed set. Common words fitting this pattern:

- HUNNY – uses N twice (both N are allowed)
- HUGGY – G is allowed
- HUKEY – K and E (E is ruled out)
- HUMPY – M and P are ruled out
- HUDDY – D is ruled out

The most straightforward valid word left is “HUNNY”.
