- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All unique letters to maximize information gain

This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and should provide useful feedback regardless of the actual secret word.

- O(x) → O is not in the word at all
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4

- It does NOT contain O or E

- Avoids the excluded positions for A, R, S

Possible positions for A: 2,3,4,5

Possible positions for S: 1,2,3,5

Let’s try placing them in new positions while adding two new consonants that haven’t been tested yet (common ones: T, N, L, D, etc.).

One good candidate is ""STARS"":
- S in position 1 (allowed)
- T (new letter)

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that ARE in the word:
   - S (confirmed in position 1)
   - A (in the word but not in positions 1, 3)
   - R (in the word but not in positions 2, 4)
   - T (in the word but not in position 2)

2. Letters that are NOT in the word:
   - O, E

3. Position constraints:
   - S is fixed in position 1
   - A cannot be in positions 1, 3
   - R cannot be in positions 2, 4
   - T cannot be in position 2

4. The word must therefore contain exactly one each of S, A, R, T plus one more letter (since it’s 5 letters total).

5. We have used A, R, S, T so far. The remaining unused common letters include: I, N, L, C, D, U, etc.

Let’s try to place A, R, T in allowed positions, and pick a new consonant for the last slot.

Possible positions left to fill: 2, 3, 4, 5 (but S is already in 1).

A must be in 2, 4, or 5 (cannot be 1 or 3)
R must be in 1, 3, 5 (cannot be 2 or 4) – but 1 is already S, so 3 or 5
T must be in 1, 3, 4, 5 (cannot be 2) – but 1 is S, so 3, 4, or 5

Let’s try the arrangement:
S _ A _ R

That would place:
- S in 1 (✓)
- A in 3 (allowed)
- R in 5 (allowed)
- T must go in either 2 or 4 (cannot be 2 because T(-) in position 2 from STARS), so T must be in 4
- Then the remaining letter (position 2) must be a new consonant. Common unused consonants: N, L, etc.

So the word would be: S T A N R – but STANR is not a valid English word.

Alternative: S A T _ R – but A cannot be in 2 (from STARS feedback: A(-) in position 3 of STARS, meaning A not in 3, but can be in 2). Let’s try:

S A T R _ – but R cannot be in 4 (from AROSE feedback), so R must be in 5.

Thus: S A T _ R – the blank must be a new letter, say N: SATNR – not valid.

Alternative: S _ A T R – positions:
- S 1 (✓)
- A 3 (allowed)
- T 4 (allowed)
- R 5 (allowed)
- Then position 2 must be new letter, say N: S N A T R – not a word.

Another approach: S _ _ _ R – with A and T somewhere.

Let’s try S T A _ R – positions:
- S 1 (✓)
- T 2 (but T(-) in STARS means T is not in position 2) – invalid.

Try S A T _ R – positions:
- S 1 (✓)
- A 2 (allowed)
- T 3 (allowed)
- _ 4 – new letter, say N

Try S _ A T R – positions:
- S 1 (✓)

Another candidate: S A N T R – positions:
- S 1 (✓)
- A 2 (allowed)
- N 3
- T 4 (allowed)
- R 5 (allowed)

Word: S A N T R – this is a valid English word (though rare, ""santir"" isn't; ""sant"" isn't). Actually, ""SANTR"" isn't a word.

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words that fit:
- S _ _ _ _ with A, R, T somewhere and one new letter.

Let’s try S T A R _ – but that’s 4 letters.

Actually, the word must be S _ _ _ _ with A, R, T in positions 2-5, and one new letter.

Let’s try S P A R T – positions:
- S 1 (✓)
- P 2 (new letter)
- A 3 (allowed)

Try S P A T R – positions:

- A 2 (allowed)
- T 3 (allowed)
- I 4 (new)

Word: S A T I R – this is a valid English word (""satir"").

Let’s verify:

- A in 2: allowed (was not in 1 or 3)
- T in 3: allowed (was not in 2)
- I new
- R in 5: allowed (was not in 2 or 4)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All unique letters to maximize information gain

This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and should provide useful feedback regardless of the actual secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all

So we know:
- The word contains A, R, S (each once)
- It does NOT contain O or E
- A is not in position 1
- R is not in position 2
- S is not in position 4

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses A, R, S exactly once each
- Does not use O or E
- Avoids the excluded positions for A, R, S

Possible positions for A: 2,3,4,5
Possible positions for R: 1,3,4,5
Possible positions for S: 1,2,3,5

Let’s try placing them in new positions while adding two new consonants that haven’t been tested yet (common ones: T, N, L, D, etc.).

One good candidate is ""STARS"":
- S in position 1 (allowed)
- T (new letter)
- A in position 3 (allowed)
- R in position 4 (allowed)
- S in position 5 (allowed)

This keeps the known letters and introduces T.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STARS -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(-) A(-) R(-) S(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that ARE in the word:
   - S (confirmed in position 1)
   - A (in the word but not in positions 1, 3)
   - R (in the word but not in positions 2, 4)
   - T (in the word but not in position 2)

2. Letters that are NOT in the word:
   - O, E

3. Position constraints:
   - S is fixed in position 1
   - A cannot be in positions 1, 3
   - R cannot be in positions 2, 4
   - T cannot be in position 2

4. The word must therefore contain exactly one each of S, A, R, T plus one more letter (since it’s 5 letters total).

5. We have used A, R, S, T so far. The remaining unused common letters include: I, N, L, C, D, U, etc.

Let’s try to place A, R, T in allowed positions, and pick a new consonant for the last slot.

Possible positions left to fill: 2, 3, 4, 5 (but S is already in 1).

A must be in 2, 4, or 5 (cannot be 1 or 3)
R must be in 1, 3, 5 (cannot be 2 or 4) – but 1 is already S, so 3 or 5
T must be in 1, 3, 4, 5 (cannot be 2) – but 1 is S, so 3, 4, or 5

Let’s try the arrangement:
S _ A _ R

That would place:
- S in 1 (✓)
- A in 3 (allowed)
- R in 5 (allowed)
- T must go in either 2 or 4 (cannot be 2 because T(-) in position 2 from STARS), so T must be in 4
- Then the remaining letter (position 2) must be a new consonant. Common unused consonants: N, L, etc.

So the word would be: S T A N R – but STANR is not a valid English word.

Alternative: S A T _ R – but A cannot be in 2 (from STARS feedback: A(-) in position 3 of STARS, meaning A not in 3, but can be in 2). Let’s try:

S A T R _ – but R cannot be in 4 (from AROSE feedback), so R must be in 5.

Thus: S A T _ R – the blank must be a new letter, say N: SATNR – not valid.

Alternative: S _ A T R – positions:
- S 1 (✓)
- A 3 (allowed)
- T 4 (allowed)
- R 5 (allowed)
- Then position 2 must be new letter, say N: S N A T R – not a word.

Another approach: S _ _ _ R – with A and T somewhere.

Let’s try S T A _ R – positions:
- S 1 (✓)
- T 2 (but T(-) in STARS means T is not in position 2) – invalid.

Try S A T _ R – positions:
- S 1 (✓)
- A 2 (allowed)
- T 3 (allowed)
- _ 4 – new letter, say N
- R 5 (allowed)

Word: S A T N R – not valid.

Try S _ A T R – positions:
- S 1 (✓)
- _ 2 – new letter, say N
- A 3 (allowed)
- T 4 (allowed)
- R 5 (allowed)

Word: S N A T R – not valid.

Try S _ _ A R – positions:
- S 1 (✓)
- _ 2 – new letter, say T
- _ 3 – new letter, say N
- A 4 (allowed)
- R 5 (allowed)

Word: S T N A R – not valid.

Another candidate: S A N T R – positions:
- S 1 (✓)
- A 2 (allowed)
- N 3
- T 4 (allowed)
- R 5 (allowed)

Word: S A N T R – this is a valid English word (though rare, ""santir"" isn't; ""sant"" isn't). Actually, ""SANTR"" isn't a word.

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words that fit:
- S _ _ _ _ with A, R, T somewhere and one new letter.

Let’s try S T A R _ – but that’s 4 letters.

Actually, the word must be S _ _ _ _ with A, R, T in positions 2-5, and one new letter.

Let’s try S P A R T – positions:
- S 1 (✓)
- P 2 (new letter)
- A 3 (allowed)
- R 4 (but R cannot be in 4) – invalid.

Try S P A T R – positions:
- S 1 (✓)
- P 2 (new)
- A 3 (allowed)
- T 4 (allowed)
- R 5 (allowed)

Try S N A T R – not valid.

Try S C A R T – positions:

Try S R A T N – positions:

Try S _ R A T – positions:

- _ 2 – new letter, say N
- R 3 (allowed)
- A 4 (allowed)
- T 5 (allowed)

Word: S N R A T – not valid.

Try S _ _ R A – positions:

- R 4 (invalid) – R cannot be in 4.

Try S _ _ A R – positions:
- S 1 (✓)
- _ 2 – new letter, say T
- _ 3 – new letter, say N
- A 4 (allowed)

Word: S T N A R – not valid.

Let’s try a different new letter: S, A, R, T plus I.

Possible word: S A T I R – positions:
- S 1 (✓)
- A 2 (allowed)
- T 3 (allowed)
- I 4 (new)
- R 5 (allowed)

Word: S A T I R – this is a valid English word (""satir"").

Let’s verify:
- S in 1: ✓ (matches)
- A in 2: allowed (was not in 1 or 3)
- T in 3: allowed (was not in 2)
- I new
- R in 5: allowed (was not in 2 or 4)

This seems valid.

Let's consolidate what we now know from all three guesses.

Known letters (each exactly once):
- S (position 1)
- T (position 3)
- R (position 5)

Forbidden letters: O, E, I (all shown “x” or “-” in some position and never confirmed)

Remaining positions to fill: 2 and 4
Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): any consonant or vowel except O, E, I

From earlier feedback:
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (it was “-” in positions 1,3 and 2 in SATIR).  
  Therefore A must be in position 5, but position 5 is already R.  
  This is impossible → our assumption must be wrong.

Re-examine the feedback:
Guess 3: SATIR → S(✓) A(-) T(✓) I(-) R(✓)
- A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 2.
- I(-) means I is in the word but not in position 4.

So far:
- Positions 1,3,5 are S, T, R respectively.
- A is somewhere, but not positions 1,2,3,4,5 (since 5 is R) → contradiction.

Realization: A cannot be in the word if it must avoid positions 1,2,3,4,5.  
Therefore A must be in position 5, but position 5 is R.  
Hence A cannot be in the word, contradicting the earlier “-” in AROSE.

This means we misinterpreted.  
Recheck:
Guess 1: AROSE → A(-) means A is in word but NOT position 1.  
Guess 2: STARS → A(-) means A is in word but NOT position 3.  
Guess 3: SATIR → A(-) means A is in word but NOT position 2.  

So A must be in position 4 (only remaining spot).

Current skeleton: S _ T A R

The blank (position 2) must be a letter that:
- has not been ruled out (not O, E, I)
- is not already used (S, T, A, R)

Valid unused letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word S _ T A R.  
Scanning common words:  
- S C T A R – not valid  
- S P T A R – not valid  
- S N T A R – not valid  
- S W T A R – not valid  

Wait, let’s list actual English words ending in “STAR”:
- S T A R _ – but we need S _ T A R.

Actually, the pattern is S _ T A R.  
Valid word: S W T A R – no.  
S C T A R – no.  
S N T A R – no.

Realize we missed: S C A T R – but that’s 5 letters and fits S C A T R.

Wait, let’s re-express the skeleton:  
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Letters:   S ? T A R  

Valid English word: S C A T R – no.  
S H T A R – no.  
S L T A R – no.

Realize we need to list actual words:  
The only common 5-letter word matching S _ T A R is “S C T A R” – not valid.  
But “S C A T R” – no.

Wait, let’s think differently: the word is S _ T A R, and the blank must be a letter not yet ruled out.

Valid word: S C T A R – not valid.  
S H T A R – not valid.  
S L T A R – not valid.

S Q T A R – not valid.  
S V T A R – not valid.  
S Y T A R – not valid.  
S Z T A R – not valid.  
S U T A R – not valid.  

Realize we must have made an error in deducing positions.  
Re-express the known facts:

1. S is in position 1 (✓)
2. T is in position 3 (✓)
3. R is in position 5 (✓)
4. A is in the word but NOT positions 1,2,3 (from AROSE and STARS)
5. I is in the word but NOT position 4 (from SATIR)

Therefore A must be in position 4 (only remaining spot), making the word S _ T A R.

Now we need a valid 5-letter word S _ T A R.  
The only common English word fitting this is “S C T A R” – but that’s not valid.  
Wait, let’s list all possibilities:

- S B T A R – not valid
- S C T A R – not valid
- S D T A R – not valid
- S F T A R – not valid
- S G T A R – not valid
- S H T A R – not valid
- S J T A R – not valid
- S K T A R – not valid
- S L T A R – not valid
- S M T A R – not valid
- S N T A R – not valid
- S P T A R – not valid
- S Q T A R – not valid
- S V T A R – not valid
- S W T A R – not valid
- S X T A R – not valid
- S Y T A R – not valid
- S Z T A R – not valid

None are valid. This indicates an inconsistency in our deductions.

Re-examine the feedback carefully:

Guess 3: SATIR → S(✓) A(-) T(✓) I(-) R(✓)

- A(-) means A is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- I(-) means I is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So the word contains S, T, R, A, I (each once), and the positions are:

1: S
2: not A, not I
3: T
4: not I
5: R

Thus the word must be S _ T _ R with A and I in positions 2 and 4 (but 4 cannot be I), so:

- Position 2: A or I
- Position 4: the remaining of A or I

But position 2 cannot be A (from A(-)), so position 2 must be I and position 4 must be A.

Thus the word is S I T A R – which is a valid English word.

Let’s verify:
- S(✓) in 1
- I(-) in 2 – but I(-) means I is in the word but not in position 4, which is fine (it’s in 2)
- T(✓) in 3
- A(-) in 4 – but A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 2, which is fine (it’s in 4)
- R(✓) in 5

This satisfies all feedback.
