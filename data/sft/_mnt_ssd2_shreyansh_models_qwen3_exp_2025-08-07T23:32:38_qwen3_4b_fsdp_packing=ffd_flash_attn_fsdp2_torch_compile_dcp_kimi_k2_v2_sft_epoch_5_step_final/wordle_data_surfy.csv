### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words often include vowels and common consonants. After considering options like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AROSE,"" and ""ADIEU,"" ""SLATE"" stands out because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common ending letter)
- E (most common letter overall)

This combination gives us good coverage of frequent letters and positions, helping narrow down possibilities efficiently.

From the feedback:
- S is in the correct first position.
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the word is S _ _ _ _, and none of L, A, T, E appear anywhere.  
We now need a 5-letter word starting with S, excluding L, A, T, E.  
Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F, K, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

A strong second guess should test new common letters while keeping S fixed.  
Candidate words:  
- SHIRK (S, H, I, R, K) – uses common letters not yet eliminated.  
- SPURN (S, P, U, R, N) – another strong option.  
- SCOUR (S, C, O, U, R) – also good.

I’ll go with **SHIRK** because H, I, R, K are all high-frequency letters not yet ruled out.

From all feedback so far:

1. S is fixed in position 1.
2. Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, H, I, K, C, M.
3. R is in position 3 (from SCRUM feedback: R(✓)).
4. U is in the word but NOT in position 4 (from SCRUM feedback: U(-)).

So the pattern is: S _ R _ _  
U must be in position 2 or 5.

Available letters (excluding the banned set): B, D, F, G, J, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, U.

We need two more letters. Let’s try placing U in position 2:  
S U R _ _

Now we need two more letters for positions 4 and 5. Common consonants left: N, D, G, P, etc.

Candidate: S U R G E – but E is banned.  
S U R F Y – Y is sometimes a vowel, but let’s check: SURFY is a word.  
S U R G Y – SURGY isn’t valid.  
S U R P Y – SURPY isn’t valid.  
S U R F Y seems the closest.

Wait, let’s try U in position 5 instead:  
S _ R _ U

Now we need letters for positions 2 and 4.  
S P R I N – but I is banned.  
S P R O N – SPRON isn’t a word.  
S N R O D – SNROD isn’t a word.  
S B R O D – SBROD isn’t a word.

Let’s go back to U in position 2:  
S U R _ _

Looking for common words:  
SURGE – E banned.  
SURFY – valid word.  
SURGE – invalid.  
SURDY – not a word.  
SURGY – not a word.

SURFY seems the best option.

But let me check another angle: U in position 5 and different consonants.  
S N R O U – SNROU isn’t a word.  
S P R O U – SPROU isn’t a word.  
S D R O U – SDRou isn’t a word.

SURFY seems the only valid word fitting constraints.

Wait, let me think of S _ R _ U with valid words:  
S P R I U – I banned.  
S N R O U – invalid.  
S B R O U – invalid.

Thus, SURFY is the best candidate.

But let me verify SURFY:  
Letters: S, U, R, F, Y.  
All letters not banned, fits S _ R _ U with U in position 2.

Actually, SURFY has U in position 2, so pattern S U R _ _.  
Letters: S, U, R, F, Y – none banned.

SURFY is a valid word (meaning surf-oriented).

Thus, the next guess is SURFY.
