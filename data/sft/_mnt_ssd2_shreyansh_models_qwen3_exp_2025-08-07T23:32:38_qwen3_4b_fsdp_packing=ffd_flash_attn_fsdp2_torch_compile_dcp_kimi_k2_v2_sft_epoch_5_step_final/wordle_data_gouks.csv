### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- 2 common consonants (R, S) that appear frequently
- No repeating letters, maximizing the information gained from the feedback

This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters that are in the secret word, helping me narrow down possibilities for the next guess.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word (but wrong positions):
- O – was in position 3 in AROSE and position 3 in STOIC; must be in 1, 2, or 5.
- S – was in position 4 in AROSE and position 1 in STOIC; must be in 2, 3, or 5.

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
A, R, E, T, I, C.

So the remaining alphabet pool is:
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both O and S.
- Places O somewhere other than 3.
- Places S somewhere other than 1 or 4.
- Uses only letters from the allowed pool.

A quick scan of common words that fit these constraints:
- SPOON – but O is in position 3 again, which is forbidden.
- SONAR – contains R, which is forbidden.
- SHOWN – contains W, N, H (all allowed) and positions: S(1) again forbidden.
- SLOSH – S in 1 again forbidden.
- SOLID – contains I, D, L; I is forbidden.
- SNOOK – contains N, K, O; O is in 3 again.
- SPOOF – contains P, F; O is in 3 again.
- SLOBS – contains B, S in 1 again.
- SLOSH – already considered.
- SMOKE – contains M, K, E; E is forbidden.
- SLOPE – contains P, E; E is forbidden.
- SLOTH – contains L, T, H; T is forbidden.
- SLOOM – contains L, M, O; O is in 3 again.
- SLOPS – contains P, S in 5; S could be in 5, O in 3 again.
- SLOSH – already considered.

Let’s try a word where:
- O is in position 2.
- S is in position 3 or 5.
- Other letters are from the allowed set.

Consider “SONGS” – but S is in 1 and 5, and O is in 3, both forbidden.
Consider “SPOON” – again O in 3.
Consider “SLOSH” – S in 1 forbidden.
Consider “SLOBS” – S in 1 forbidden.

Another approach: place O in position 5 and S in position 2 or 3.

Word: “BOSUN” – contains U, N; B allowed; positions: O in 3 again forbidden.
Word: “PONDS” – O in 2 allowed, S in 5 allowed; letters P, N, D allowed.

Check PONDS:
- Letters: P, O, N, D, S – none of the forbidden ones.
- O is in position 2 (allowed).
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- No repeats of forbidden letters.

From the feedback so far:

Known facts:
- Letters in the word and their correct positions:
  – O is in position 2 (✓).
  – S is in position 5 (✓).
- Letters NOT in the word at all:
  A, R, E, T, I, C, P, N, D.
- Letters still possible (from the remaining alphabet):
  B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

So the secret word looks like: _ O _ _ S.

We need to fill positions 1, 3, 4 with letters from the allowed set and form a valid 5-letter English word.

Let’s list some common consonants still available: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, W, Y.

Possible patterns:
- B O _ _ S
- F O _ _ S
- G O _ _ S
- H O _ _ S
- K O _ _ S
- L O _ _ S
- M O _ _ S
- W O _ _ S
- Y O _ _ S

Scanning for real words:
- BOGUS – uses B, G, U; all allowed letters.
- FOGUS – not a common word.
- HOMES – contains M, E; E is forbidden.
- KOLBS – not a common word.
- LOMBS – not a common word.
- MOLDS – D is forbidden.
- WOKES – contains E, K; E is forbidden.
- YOKES – E is forbidden.

The most promising valid word is “BOGUS”:
- B, O, G, U, S – none of the forbidden letters appear.
- O is in position 2 (✓).
- S is in position 5 (✓).
- B, G, U are all allowed.

Therefore, “BOGUS” is the logical next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- 2 common consonants (R, S) that appear frequently
- No repeating letters, maximizing the information gained from the feedback

This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters that are in the secret word, helping me narrow down possibilities for the next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So we know:
1. The word contains O and S, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
2. The word does NOT contain A, R, or E.

Next, I want to:
- Keep O and S in new positions (positions 1,2,5 for O and 1,2,3,5 for S).
- Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tested yet (like T, N, I, L, etc.).
- Avoid A, R, E.

A good candidate is “STOIC”:
- S moves from position 4 to 1.
- O moves from position 3 to 2.
- T, I, C are new letters that haven’t been tested.
- No A, R, E.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word (but wrong positions):
- O – was in position 3 in AROSE and position 3 in STOIC; must be in 1, 2, or 5.
- S – was in position 4 in AROSE and position 1 in STOIC; must be in 2, 3, or 5.

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
A, R, E, T, I, C.

So the remaining alphabet pool is:
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both O and S.
- Places O somewhere other than 3.
- Places S somewhere other than 1 or 4.
- Uses only letters from the allowed pool.

A quick scan of common words that fit these constraints:
- SPOON – but O is in position 3 again, which is forbidden.
- SONAR – contains R, which is forbidden.
- SHOWN – contains W, N, H (all allowed) and positions: S(1) again forbidden.
- SLOSH – S in 1 again forbidden.
- SOLID – contains I, D, L; I is forbidden.
- SNOOK – contains N, K, O; O is in 3 again.
- SPOOF – contains P, F; O is in 3 again.
- SLOBS – contains B, S in 1 again.
- SLOSH – already considered.
- SMOKE – contains M, K, E; E is forbidden.
- SLOPE – contains P, E; E is forbidden.
- SLOTH – contains L, T, H; T is forbidden.
- SLOOM – contains L, M, O; O is in 3 again.
- SLOPS – contains P, S in 5; S could be in 5, O in 3 again.
- SLOSH – already considered.

Let’s try a word where:
- O is in position 2.
- S is in position 3 or 5.
- Other letters are from the allowed set.

Consider “SONGS” – but S is in 1 and 5, and O is in 3, both forbidden.
Consider “SPOON” – again O in 3.
Consider “SLOSH” – S in 1 forbidden.
Consider “SLOBS” – S in 1 forbidden.

Another approach: place O in position 5 and S in position 2 or 3.

Word: “BOSUN” – contains U, N; B allowed; positions: O in 3 again forbidden.
Word: “PONDS” – O in 2 allowed, S in 5 allowed; letters P, N, D allowed.

Check PONDS:
- Letters: P, O, N, D, S – none of the forbidden ones.
- O is in position 2 (allowed).
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- No repeats of forbidden letters.

Looks good.

Wait, let's systematically list possible words fitting _ O _ _ S with G and U in 1,3,4:

Possible words:
- G O U _ S – but then we need a letter for position 4. GOUFS – F allowed, GOUKS – K allowed, GOUYS – Y allowed.
- U O G _ S – UOG_S – no common word
- G O _ U S – GOMUS – not valid
- G O _ _ U – but S is fixed at 5, so this is impossible
- U O _ G S – UOG_S – no common word
- U O _ _ G – but S is fixed at 5, and G would be at 4, but then we need a letter at 3. UOFGS – not valid
- _ O G U S – but position 1 would be missing a letter, and we have to include G and U. Actually this would be G or U in 1, then O, then G and U in 3 and 4.

Looking at common words:
- G O U _ S – GOUFS (G, O, U, F, S) – F is allowed
- G O _ U S – GOMUS – not valid
- G O _ _ U – impossible because S must be at 5
- U O G _ S – UOG_S – no common word
- U O _ G S – UOFGS – not valid
- _ O G U S – this would require position 1 to be another letter, but we must include G and U. Actually this would be G or U in 1, then O, then G and U in 3 and 4. The only possible arrangement seems to be G O U _ S or U O G _ S, but neither gives a common word.

Wait, let's think differently: the word must contain G and U somewhere in positions 1,3,4, and fit _ O _ _ S. The only common word that fits is ""GULFS"":
- G in 1, U in 3, L in 4, F in 4 – wait no, GULFS is G U L F S, which would be _ U L F S, not _ O _ _ S.

Actually, let's list all possible words fitting _ O _ _ S with G and U in 1,3,4:

Possible words:
- G O U _ S – GOUFS (G, O, U, F, S) – F is allowed
- G O _ U S – GOMUS – not valid
- G O _ _ U – impossible
- U O G _ S – UOG_S – no common word
- U O _ G S – UOFGS – not valid
- U O _ _ G – impossible
- _ O G U S – this would be G or U in 1, then O, then G and U in 3 and 4. The only possible is G O G U S – invalid, or U O G U S – invalid.

Hmm, seems like the only valid word fitting these constraints is ""GOUFS"" (G, O, U, F, S). Let's check:
- G in 1: allowed
- O in 2: correct
- U in 3: allowed
- F in 4: allowed
- S in 5: correct
- No forbidden letters (A,R,E,T,I,C,P,N,D,B)

Therefore, ""GOUFS"" is the logical next guess.

- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, E, T, I, C, P, N, D, B
- Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions: G, U (from BOGUS feedback: G(-) U(-))
- Therefore G and U must appear somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Allowed letters for positions 1, 3, 4: F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus G and U which we know must be used).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- 2 common consonants (R, S) that appear frequently
- No repeating letters, maximizing the information gained from the feedback

This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters that are in the secret word, helping me narrow down possibilities for the next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So we know:
1. The word contains O and S, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
2. The word does NOT contain A, R, or E.

Next, I want to:
- Keep O and S in new positions (positions 1,2,5 for O and 1,2,3,5 for S).
- Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tested yet (like T, N, I, L, etc.).
- Avoid A, R, E.

A good candidate is “STOIC”:
- S moves from position 4 to 1.
- O moves from position 3 to 2.
- T, I, C are new letters that haven’t been tested.
- No A, R, E.

Guess 2: STOIC -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(-) I(x) C(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word (but wrong positions):
- O – was in position 3 in AROSE and position 3 in STOIC; must be in 1, 2, or 5.
- S – was in position 4 in AROSE and position 1 in STOIC; must be in 2, 3, or 5.

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
A, R, E, T, I, C.

So the remaining alphabet pool is:
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both O and S.
- Places O somewhere other than 3.
- Places S somewhere other than 1 or 4.
- Uses only letters from the allowed pool.

A quick scan of common words that fit these constraints:
- SPOON – but O is in position 3 again, which is forbidden.
- SONAR – contains R, which is forbidden.
- SHOWN – contains W, N, H (all allowed) and positions: S(1) again forbidden.
- SLOSH – S in 1 again forbidden.
- SOLID – contains I, D, L; I is forbidden.
- SNOOK – contains N, K, O; O is in 3 again.
- SPOOF – contains P, F; O is in 3 again.
- SLOBS – contains B, S in 1 again.
- SLOSH – already considered.
- SMOKE – contains M, K, E; E is forbidden.
- SLOPE – contains P, E; E is forbidden.
- SLOTH – contains L, T, H; T is forbidden.
- SLOOM – contains L, M, O; O is in 3 again.
- SLOPS – contains P, S in 5; S could be in 5, O in 3 again.
- SLOSH – already considered.

Let’s try a word where:
- O is in position 2.
- S is in position 3 or 5.
- Other letters are from the allowed set.

Consider “SONGS” – but S is in 1 and 5, and O is in 3, both forbidden.
Consider “SPOON” – again O in 3.
Consider “SLOSH” – S in 1 forbidden.
Consider “SLOBS” – S in 1 forbidden.

Another approach: place O in position 5 and S in position 2 or 3.

Word: “BOSUN” – contains U, N; B allowed; positions: O in 3 again forbidden.
Word: “PONDS” – O in 2 allowed, S in 5 allowed; letters P, N, D allowed.

Check PONDS:
- Letters: P, O, N, D, S – none of the forbidden ones.
- O is in position 2 (allowed).
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- No repeats of forbidden letters.

Looks good.

From the feedback so far:

Known facts:
- Letters in the word and their correct positions:
  – O is in position 2 (✓).
  – S is in position 5 (✓).
- Letters NOT in the word at all:
  A, R, E, T, I, C, P, N, D.
- Letters still possible (from the remaining alphabet):
  B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

So the secret word looks like: _ O _ _ S.

We need to fill positions 1, 3, 4 with letters from the allowed set and form a valid 5-letter English word.

Let’s list some common consonants still available: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, W, Y.

Possible patterns:
- B O _ _ S
- F O _ _ S
- G O _ _ S
- H O _ _ S
- K O _ _ S
- L O _ _ S
- M O _ _ S
- W O _ _ S
- Y O _ _ S

Scanning for real words:
- BOGUS – uses B, G, U; all allowed letters.
- FOGUS – not a common word.
- HOMES – contains M, E; E is forbidden.
- KOLBS – not a common word.
- LOMBS – not a common word.
- MOLDS – D is forbidden.
- WOKES – contains E, K; E is forbidden.
- YOKES – E is forbidden.

The most promising valid word is “BOGUS”:
- B, O, G, U, S – none of the forbidden letters appear.
- O is in position 2 (✓).
- S is in position 5 (✓).
- B, G, U are all allowed.

Therefore, “BOGUS” is the logical next guess.

Allowed letters for positions 1, 3, 4: F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus G and U which we know must be used).

We need to place G and U into positions 1, 3, or 4 while keeping the pattern _ O _ _ S.

Possible arrangements:
1. G in 1, U in 3 or 4
2. U in 1, G in 3 or 4
3. G in 3, U in 1 or 4
4. U in 3, G in 1 or 4
5. G in 4, U in 1 or 3

Let's test common words:
- GOUSS – not valid
- GULFS – F and L allowed
- GUMPS – P forbidden
- HUGOS – H, U, G, O, S – but O and S are already placed, and we need to check if HUGOS fits the pattern _ O _ _ S. Actually HUGOS would be H U G O S which doesn't fit our pattern.
- JOKUL – doesn't end with S
- KOLBS – P forbidden, B forbidden
- MOLDS – D forbidden
- VOGUS – not valid
- WOKES – E forbidden
- YOKES – E forbidden

Wait, let's systematically list possible words fitting _ O _ _ S with G and U in 1,3,4:

Possible words:
- G O U _ S – but then we need a letter for position 4. GOUFS – F allowed, GOUKS – K allowed, GOUYS – Y allowed.
- U O G _ S – UOG_S – no common word
- G O _ U S – GOMUS – not valid
- G O _ _ U – but S is fixed at 5, so this is impossible
- U O _ G S – UOG_S – no common word
- U O _ _ G – but S is fixed at 5, and G would be at 4, but then we need a letter at 3. UOFGS – not valid
- _ O G U S – but position 1 would be missing a letter, and we have to include G and U. Actually this would be G or U in 1, then O, then G and U in 3 and 4.

Looking at common words:
- G O U _ S – GOUFS (G, O, U, F, S) – F is allowed
- G O _ U S – GOMUS – not valid
- G O _ _ U – impossible because S must be at 5
- U O G _ S – UOG_S – no common word
- U O _ G S – UOFGS – not valid
- _ O G U S – this would require position 1 to be another letter, but we must include G and U. Actually this would be G or U in 1, then O, then G and U in 3 and 4. The only possible arrangement seems to be G O U _ S or U O G _ S, but neither gives a common word.

Wait, let's think differently: the word must contain G and U somewhere in positions 1,3,4, and fit _ O _ _ S. The only common word that fits is ""GULFS"":
- G in 1, U in 3, L in 4, F in 4 – wait no, GULFS is G U L F S, which would be _ U L F S, not _ O _ _ S.

Actually, let's list all possible words fitting _ O _ _ S with G and U in 1,3,4:

Possible words:
- G O U _ S – GOUFS (G, O, U, F, S) – F is allowed
- G O _ U S – GOMUS – not valid
- G O _ _ U – impossible
- U O G _ S – UOG_S – no common word
- U O _ G S – UOFGS – not valid
- U O _ _ G – impossible
- _ O G U S – this would be G or U in 1, then O, then G and U in 3 and 4. The only possible is G O G U S – invalid, or U O G U S – invalid.

Hmm, seems like the only valid word fitting these constraints is ""GOUFS"" (G, O, U, F, S). Let's check:
- G in 1: allowed
- O in 2: correct
- U in 3: allowed
- F in 4: allowed
- S in 5: correct
- No forbidden letters (A,R,E,T,I,C,P,N,D,B)

Therefore, ""GOUFS"" is the logical next guess.

UOFGS – not valid\n- _ O G U S – but position 1 would be missing a letter, and we have to include G and U.

The only common word that fits is ""GULFS"":\n- G in 1, U in 3, L in 4, F in 4 – wait no, GULFS is G U L F S, which would be _ U L F S, not _ O _ _ S.\n\nActually, let\'s list all possible words fitting _ O _ _ S with G and U in 1,3,4:\n\nPossible words:\n- G O U _ S – GOUFS (G, O, U, F, S) – F is allowed\n- G O _ U S – GOMUS – not valid\n- G O _ _ U – impossible\n- U O G _ S – UOG_S – no common word\n- U O _ G S – UOFGS – not valid\n- U O _ _ G – impossible\n- _ O G U S – this would be G or U in 1, then O, then G and U in 3 and 4.

From the latest feedback on GOUFS:
- G is in the correct position (position 1).
- O is in the correct position (position 2).
- U is in the correct position (position 3).
- F is NOT in the word.
- S is in the correct position (position 5).

So the word pattern is now fully determined: G O U _ S.

The only missing letter is in position 4. From previous feedback, we know the letters NOT in the word are: A, R, E, T, I, C, P, N, D, B, F. The remaining possible letters for position 4 are: H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter English words that fit G O U _ S:
- GOUKS – not common
- GOUYS – not common
- GOUFS – already tried, F is out
- GOUTS – T is out
- GOUSS – not valid
- GOUZS – not valid

The only valid word seems to be ""GOUYS"" (plural of ""gouy""), but this is quite obscure. However, ""GOUTS"" uses T which is forbidden. 

Wait, let's check ""GOUKS"" – K is allowed and it's a valid word (plural of ""gouk"", though rare). 

But the most common word fitting G O U _ S with allowed letters is actually ""GOUYS"". However, given the constraints, the only possible valid word is ""GOUYS"".

But let's double-check: the letters allowed for position 4 are from the remaining set. The only common word is ""GOUYS"".

However, upon reflection, the correct and common word is ""GOUYS"" (though rare), but in standard Wordle lists, ""GOUYS"" might not be valid. 

Rechecking possible letters: H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. 

The word ""GOUKS"" is valid (though uncommon), but the most likely intended word is ""GOUYS"". 

But considering standard Wordle words, the actual valid word is ""GOUYS"".

However, let's think again: the word must be G O U _ S. The only common word is ""GOUYS"".

But let's verify: G O U Y S – Y is allowed. This seems correct.

Therefore, the only possible word left is ""GOUYS"".
