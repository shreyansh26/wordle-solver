Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll try to include as many of these as possible in my first guess.

Looking at these letters, a strong candidate is ""AROSE"" because:

So far we know:

We need a 5-letter word that:

4. Uses common remaining letters (D, L, C, U, M, Y, etc.)

Let’s try S in position 2:

- E is in position 3 ✓
- S is in position 4 (but feedback said S is not in position 4 from first guess) → invalid.

Let's update what we now know after three guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x):
A, R, O, T, I, N, M, U, L

Letters that ARE in the word (✓ or -):
- E – must be in the word, but it has been placed incorrectly twice:
  – in AROSE it was in position 5 (feedback “-”)
  – in STEIN it was in position 3 (feedback “✓”)
  – in MULES it was in position 4 (feedback “-”)
  Therefore E must be in position 3 (since that was the only position ever marked ✓ for E).

- S – must be in the word, and it has been placed incorrectly:
  – in AROSE it was in position 4 (feedback “-”)
  – in STEIN it was in position 1 (feedback “-”)
  – in MULES it was in position 5 (feedback “✓”)
  Therefore S must be in position 5 (since that was the only position ever marked ✓ for S).

So the word must look like:
_ _ E _ S

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 2, chosen from the allowed set, and we want a common English word.

Common combinations:
- C, H, K, D, G, B, F, V, W, Y

Let’s list some 5-letter words matching _ _ E _ S:
- CHEPS – invalid (P already ruled out? No, P not yet ruled out)
- CHEWS – W is allowed
- CHEFS – F is allowed
- DWEBS – B is allowed
- GWEBS – B is allowed
- PHEWS – H, W allowed
- YODES – O is ruled out
- CEDES – D, E allowed but E already used
- HEDES – H, D allowed
- FEDES – F, D allowed
- JEWES – J, W allowed
- KEEPS – K, P allowed
- VESYS – V, Y allowed (but “VESYS” not a common word)

The most common and valid ones seem to be:
CHEWS, CHEFS, DWEBS, GWEBS, PHEWS, KEEPS, HEDES, FEDES, JEWES

Among these, “CHEWS” and “CHEFS” are very common. Let’s pick “CHEWS” because W is a common ending letter and C, H are frequent starting letters.

Check constraints:
- C, H, E, W, S
- E is in position 3 ✓
- S is in position 5 ✓
- All letters are allowed (none are in the forbidden list)
- “CHEWS” is a valid English word.

Therefore, the next guess is “CHEWS”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me maximum information about the letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. 

Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll try to include as many of these as possible in my first guess.

Looking at these letters, a strong candidate is ""AROSE"" because:
- It contains 5 unique letters
- It has 4 of the top 5 most common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English words
- It's a valid 5-letter word

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x)
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-)

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O
- DOES contain S and E, but S is not in position 4 and E is not in position 5

Since S and E must appear somewhere, I want a word that:
1. Uses S and E
2. Places S somewhere other than position 4
3. Places E somewhere other than position 5
4. Avoids A, R, O
5. Uses common remaining letters to maximize information

Good remaining common letters: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, P, M, Y

Let me try ""STEIN"":
- Contains S and E
- S is in position 1 (not 4) ✓
- E is in position 2 (not 5) ✓
- Uses T, I, N which are common
- Avoids A, R, O ✓

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STEIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) E(✓) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on STEIN:
- S is still in the word but not in position 1 (-)  
- T, I, N are NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓) — position 3

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, I, N  
- Letters that ARE in the word: S (somewhere other than 1 or 4), E (fixed in position 3)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E in position 3
2. Contains S (but not in 1 or 4) → S must be in position 2 or 5
3. Avoids all forbidden letters A, R, O, T, I, N
4. Uses common remaining letters (D, L, C, U, M, Y, etc.)

Let’s try S in position 2:
- Pattern: _ S E _ _
- Possible second letter: S is already used, so first letter must be something else.
- Remaining common letters: D, L, C, U, M, Y, etc.

Word must be valid. Let’s try “DULSE”:
- D, U, L, S, E
- E is in position 3 ✓
- S is in position 4 (but feedback said S is not in position 4 from first guess) → invalid.

Next try “ULSE” + S → “ULSE” is 4 letters, need 5. Maybe “DULSE” already failed.

Try S in position 5:
- Pattern: _ _ E _ S
- Common letters: C, L, D, U, M, Y, etc.

Let’s try “C” + “L” + “E” + “D” + “S” → “CLEDS” – not a valid word.

Try “M” + “U” + “E” + “L” + “S” → “MULES” – valid word.

Check constraints:
- E in position 3 ✓
- S in position 5 (allowed, since S only excluded from 1 and 4) ✓
- Avoids A, R, O, T, I, N ✓
- Uses common letters M, U, L ✓

Therefore, “MULES” is a good next guess.

  – in STEIN it was in position 1 (feedback “-”)
  – in MULES it was in position 5 (feedback “✓”)
  Therefore S must be in position 5 (since that was the only position ever marked ✓ for S).

So the word must look like:
_ _ E _ S

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 2, chosen from the allowed set, and we want a common English word.

Common combinations:
- C, H, K, D, G, B, F, V, W, Y

Let’s list some 5-letter words matching _ _ E _ S:
- CHEPS – invalid (P already ruled out? No, P not yet ruled out)
- CHEWS – W is allowed
- CHEFS – F is allowed
- DWEBS – B is allowed

Among these, “CHEWS” and “CHEFS” are very common. Let’s pick “CHEWS” because W is a common ending letter and C, H are frequent starting letters.

Check constraints:
- C, H, E, W, S
- E is in position 3 ✓

From the feedback on CHEWS we now know:

- C is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- H is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- W is NOT in the word.
- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So the word is now fully determined except for position 4.  
We have the pattern:

C H E _ S

Letters already ruled out (from all previous feedback):
A, R, O, T, I, N, M, U, L, W

Remaining letters that can go in position 4 (must be a single letter not yet used and not ruled out):
B, D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form CHE_S.  
Checking common words:

CHEBS – not a standard word  
CHEFS – valid (French-derived word for chefs)  
CHEGS – not a word  
CHEKS – not a word  
CHEPS – not a word  
CHEPS – not a word  
CHEPS – not a word  
CHEPS – not a word  
CHEPS – not a word  

The only common word left is “CHEFS”.

Therefore the secret word must be CHEFS.
