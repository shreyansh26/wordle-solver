For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information possible. The best strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to maximize the chances of getting hits. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should include several of these.

Some excellent first guesses are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

Candidate letters: A, E, N, L, D, M, P, I, U, B, G, K, Y, F, V, W.

Let’s try to place A and E in allowable spots and fill the rest with new common consonants.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5.
Possible positions for E: 1, 3, 4.

Let’s try “MADEN”:
- M, A, D, E, N
- A in position 2 (allowed).
- E in position 4 (allowed).
- No excluded letters.
- Uses new letters M, D, N.

Check if MADEN is valid – yes, it’s a word (variant of “madden” or “madam”).

So MADEN is a good next guess.

  – E must be in position 4  

Letters still allowed: A, B, D, E, F, G, I, K, L, P, U, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A in position 2.
2. Has E in position 4.
3. Does not contain any of the excluded letters.
4. Contains D (since D(-) means D is in the word but not in position 3).

So the pattern is: _ A _ E _ with D somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 5, and no other excluded letters.

Possible patterns:
- D A _ E _  (D in 1)

   BADED and PAVED are valid.

Now we need to pick one of these valid words and check if any of them give us more information.

DALED: D A L E D – uses L and D, both allowed.
PAVED: P A V E D – uses P and V, both allowed.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information possible. The best strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to maximize the chances of getting hits. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should include several of these.

Some excellent first guesses are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes 4 of the top 5 most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters to exclude: R, O, S.
- Letters to keep but move: A (not in 1st), E (not in 5th).

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and E (but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively).
2. Does NOT contain R, O, or S.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and E are already known).

A good candidate is ""TEACH"":
- T, E, A, C, H
- E is in position 2 (allowed, since E can't be in 5).
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since A can't be in 1).
- No R, O, S.
- Covers new letters T, C, H.

Let me check: TEACH is valid and meets all constraints.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A is in the word, not in position 1.
   - E is in the word, not in position 5.
   - R, O, S are not in the word.

2. TEACH → T(x) E(-) A(-) C(x) H(x)
   - E is in the word, not in position 2.
   - A is in the word, not in position 3.
   - T, C, H are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters to exclude: R, O, S, T, C, H.
- Letters to include: A, E.
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be in position 1 or 3.
  – E cannot be in position 2 or 5.

Remaining common letters: N, L, D, M, P, I, U, B, G, K, Y, F, V, W.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and E.
- Does not contain R, O, S, T, C, H.
- Places A somewhere other than positions 1 or 3.
- Places E somewhere other than positions 2 or 5.

Candidate letters: A, E, N, L, D, M, P, I, U, B, G, K, Y, F, V, W.

Let’s try to place A and E in allowable spots and fill the rest with new common consonants.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5.
Possible positions for E: 1, 3, 4.

Let’s try “MADEN”:
- M, A, D, E, N
- A in position 2 (allowed).
- E in position 4 (allowed).
- No excluded letters.
- Uses new letters M, D, N.

Check if MADEN is valid – yes, it’s a word (variant of “madden” or “madam”).

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information possible. The best strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to maximize the chances of getting hits. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should include several of these.

Some excellent first guesses are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes 4 of the top 5 most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters to exclude: R, O, S.
- Letters to keep but move: A (not in 1st), E (not in 5th).

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and E (but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively).
2. Does NOT contain R, O, or S.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and E are already known).

A good candidate is ""TEACH"":
- T, E, A, C, H
- E is in position 2 (allowed, since E can't be in 5).
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since A can't be in 1).
- No R, O, S.
- Covers new letters T, C, H.

Let me check: TEACH is valid and meets all constraints.

Guess 2: TEACH -> FEEDBACK: T(x) E(-) A(-) C(x) H(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A is in the word, not in position 1.
   - E is in the word, not in position 5.
   - R, O, S are not in the word.

2. TEACH → T(x) E(-) A(-) C(x) H(x)
   - E is in the word, not in position 2.
   - A is in the word, not in position 3.
   - T, C, H are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters to exclude: R, O, S, T, C, H.
- Letters to include: A, E.
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be in position 1 or 3.
  – E cannot be in position 2 or 5.

Remaining common letters: N, L, D, M, P, I, U, B, G, K, Y, F, V, W.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and E.
- Does not contain R, O, S, T, C, H.
- Places A somewhere other than positions 1 or 3.
- Places E somewhere other than positions 2 or 5.

Candidate letters: A, E, N, L, D, M, P, I, U, B, G, K, Y, F, V, W.

Let’s try to place A and E in allowable spots and fill the rest with new common consonants.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5.
Possible positions for E: 1, 3, 4.

Let’s try “MADEN”:
- M, A, D, E, N
- A in position 2 (allowed).
- E in position 4 (allowed).
- No excluded letters.
- Uses new letters M, D, N.

Check if MADEN is valid – yes, it’s a word (variant of “madden” or “madam”).

So MADEN is a good next guess.

Guess 3: MADEN -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(✓) D(-) E(✓) N(x)
<|im_end|>

From the new feedback on MADEN:

- M(x) → M is not in the word.
- A(✓) → A is in the word and in position 2.
- D(-) → D is in the word but not in position 3.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in position 4.
- N(x) → N is not in the word.

So we now know:

Letters to exclude: R, O, S, T, C, H, M, N  
Letters to include and place:  
  – A must be in position 2  
  – E must be in position 4  

Letters still allowed: A, B, D, E, F, G, I, K, L, P, U, V, W, Y  
(plus any others not yet ruled out)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A in position 2.
2. Has E in position 4.
3. Does not contain any of the excluded letters.
4. Contains D (since D(-) means D is in the word but not in position 3).

So the pattern is: _ A _ E _ with D somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 5, and no other excluded letters.

Possible patterns:
- D A _ E _  (D in 1)
- _ A D E _  (D in 3)
- _ A _ E D  (D in 5)

Let’s list valid words fitting these patterns:

1. D A _ E _  
   Possible: DABED (invalid, B and D already used), DADYE (invalid Y), DALED (valid), DAPEE (invalid), DAWED (valid), etc.  
   DALED and DAWED are both valid.

2. _ A D E _  
   Possible: BADEN (N excluded), CADED (C excluded), FAMED (M excluded), GAMED (M excluded), JAVED (J not yet excluded), LAMED (M excluded), PAVED (P and V allowed), SAVED (S excluded), etc.  
   PAVED is valid.

3. _ A _ E D  
   Possible: BADED (valid), CADED (C excluded), FAMED (M excluded), GAMED (M excluded), JAVED (J allowed), LAMED (M excluded), PAVED (P and V allowed), SAVED (S excluded), etc.  
   BADED and PAVED are valid.

Now we need to pick one of these valid words and check if any of them give us more information.

Among the candidates: DALED, DAWED, PAVED, BADED, JAVED.

DALED: D A L E D – uses L and D, both allowed.
PAVED: P A V E D – uses P and V, both allowed.
BADED: B A D E D – uses B and D, both allowed.

Let’s choose DALED as it uses L, which is a common letter we haven’t tested yet.

From the latest feedback on FAKED:

- F(x) → F is not in the word.
- A(✓) → A is in position 2 (already known).
- K(x) → K is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in position 4 (already known).
- D(✓) → D is in position 5 (already known).

So the pattern is now fixed: _ A _ E D

Excluded letters so far: R, O, S, T, C, H, M, N, L, F, K.

Letters still allowed: A, B, D, E, G, I, P, U, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that fits _ A _ E D and uses only allowed letters.

Possible letters for positions 1 and 3:
Position 1: B, G, I, P, U, V, W, Y
Position 3: A, B, D, E, G, I, P, U, V, W, Y (but A is already in 2, E in 4, D in 5)

Looking for valid words:
- B A B E D → BABED (B and B are allowed)
- G A M E D → GAMED (M excluded)
- P A P E D → PAPED (P and P are allowed)
- V A R E D → VARED (R excluded)
- W A R E D → WARED (R excluded)
- Y A R E D → YARED (R excluded)

Valid options: BABED, PAPED.

Between these, let's choose BABED as it uses B which hasn't been tested yet.
