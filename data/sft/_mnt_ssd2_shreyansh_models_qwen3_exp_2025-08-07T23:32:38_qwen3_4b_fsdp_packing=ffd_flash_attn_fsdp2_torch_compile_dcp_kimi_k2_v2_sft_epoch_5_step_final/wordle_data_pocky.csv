Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some good starting words include:

- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (contains C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (contains A, U, D, I, O)

Looking at these options, ""CRANE"" seems like a strong first choice because it includes five very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) that appear in many English words. This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R, A, N, E are NOT in the word at all.

So we now know:
1. The word does NOT contain R, A, N, or E.
2. The word DOES contain C, but not in position 1.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has C somewhere (but not in position 1).
- Does NOT have R, A, N, or E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good candidate letters left: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

- STOIC (but has O and I, which are common)
- SCOUT (but has O and U)
- CLOPS (but has L, O, P, S)
- SLOTH (but has O, T, H)

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word: R, A, N, E, S, T, I, D, U, H  
Letters that ARE in the word: O, C  
Positions ruled out:
- C cannot be in positions 1, 4, or 5 (from CRANE, DOUCH, STOIC).  
- O cannot be in position 3 (from STOIC) and now we know it is in position 2 (from DOUCH).

So the word looks like: _ O _ _ _  
and C must be in position 3.

Current pattern: _ O C _ _

Letters still allowed: B, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus any we haven’t used yet).

We need two more letters (positions 1 and 4–5) from the allowed set, forming a valid English word.

Candidate words ending in “OC”:
- BOC _ – nothing common  
- FOC _ – nothing common  
- GOC _ – nothing common  
- LOC _ – LOCUS, but U is eliminated.  
- MOC _ – MOCK, but K is allowed.  
- POC _ – nothing common  
- VOC _ – VOCAB, but A is eliminated.

Only plausible: M O C K _  
MOCK is 4 letters; we need 5.

Check 5-letter words fitting _ O C _ _ with remaining letters:
- B O C K _ – nothing  
- F O C K _ – nothing  
- L O C K _ – nothing  
- M O C K _ – nothing  
- P O C K _ – nothing  
- G O C K _ – nothing  

Wait, we need to fill positions 1 and 5.

Let’s list 5-letter words with pattern _ O C _ _ using allowed letters (B, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Possible:
- B O C K _ – no  
- B O C K Y – not a word  
- M O C K _ – no  
- L O C K _ – no  
- P O C K _ – no  
- G O C K _ – no  

Actually, let’s think differently: the word must contain O (position 2) and C (position 3), and not contain any eliminated letters.

Possible words:
- B O C C O – invalid (C twice, but we don’t know if C repeats)  
- B O C K Y – not a word  
- F O C U S – U is eliminated  
- L O C A L – A is eliminated  
- M O C K Y – not a word  
- P O C K E – E is eliminated  
- V O C A L – A is eliminated  
- W O C K Y – not a word  

Hmm, few options. Let’s try:

  - S is eliminated (from STOIC).  

- M O C K S – S eliminated.  

- P O C K S – S eliminated.  

- V O C A L – A eliminated.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some good starting words include:

- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (contains C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (contains A, U, D, I, O)

Looking at these options, ""CRANE"" seems like a strong first choice because it includes five very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) that appear in many English words. This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R, A, N, E are NOT in the word at all.

So we now know:
1. The word does NOT contain R, A, N, or E.
2. The word DOES contain C, but not in position 1.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has C somewhere (but not in position 1).
- Does NOT have R, A, N, or E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good candidate letters left: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

Possible words:
- STOIC (but has O and I, which are common)
- SCOUT (but has O and U)
- CLOPS (but has L, O, P, S)
- SLOTH (but has O, T, H)

""STOIC"" seems good because it has S, T, O, I, C - covering common letters while including C in position 5 (not position 1) and avoiding R, A, N, E.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STOIC -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(-) I(x) C(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Current deductions:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, A, N, E, S, T, I  
- Letters that ARE in the word: C, O  
- Positions we know:
  – C is NOT in position 1 (from CRANE) and NOT in position 5 (from STOIC).
  – O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from STOIC).

So the word contains both C and O, and must place them in positions they haven’t been ruled out of:
- C can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.
- O can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains C and O.
2. Uses none of the eliminated letters: R, A, N, E, S, T, I.
3. Places C and O in still-allowed positions.

Remaining common letters: D, L, U, B, M, P, G, H, Y, F, K, etc.

Candidate words:
- CLOUD – has C (pos 1, but C can’t be pos 1) ❌  
- COULD – C (pos 1) ❌  
- COMBO – contains O and C, but B and M are allowed; positions: C(1) ❌  
- COUCH – C(1) ❌  
- DOUCH – O(1), C(2) – both positions are allowed for these letters ✅  
- MOUTH – lacks C ❌  
- POUCH – lacks C ❌  
- BOCCE – contains E (eliminated) ❌  
- CLOMP – C(1) ❌  

Best remaining: DOUCH (D, O, U, C, H) – uses only allowed letters, includes both C and O in still-possible positions (C at 4, O at 2), and introduces new common letters D, U, H to test.

From the feedback so far:

1. CRANE → C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
   - C is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, A, N, E are not in the word.

2. STOIC → S(x) T(x) O(-) I(x) C(-)
   - S, T, I are not in the word.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.
   - C is in the word but not in position 5.

3. DOUCH → D(x) O(✓) U(x) C(-) H(x)
   - D, U, H are not in the word.
   - O is in position 2 (✓).
   - C is in the word but not in position 4.

Known facts:
- Letters in the word: C, O
- Letters not in the word: R, A, N, E, S, T, I, D, U, H
- Positions ruled out for C: 1, 4, 5
- Position for O: fixed at 2 (✓)

So the word has the form: _ O _ _ _
C must be in position 3 or 4 (since 1, 2, 5 are ruled out and 2 is O).

Remaining available letters (not yet eliminated): B, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2
- C in position 3 or 4
- All letters from the remaining set

Possible candidates:
- COBRA – contains R (eliminated) ❌
- COMFY – contains M, O, C, F, Y – but C is in position 3, O in 2, Y in 5 – but F and Y are allowed ❌
- COGIC – contains G, I (I eliminated) ❌
- COMFY – C is in 3, O in 2 – but F and Y are allowed – but Y is allowed? Wait, Y is not eliminated. Let me check: remaining letters include Y.

But let me think of valid words:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some good starting words include:

- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (contains C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (contains A, U, D, I, O)

Looking at these options, ""CRANE"" seems like a strong first choice because it includes five very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) that appear in many English words. This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R, A, N, E are NOT in the word at all.

So we now know:
1. The word does NOT contain R, A, N, or E.
2. The word DOES contain C, but not in position 1.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has C somewhere (but not in position 1).
- Does NOT have R, A, N, or E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good candidate letters left: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

Possible words:
- STOIC (but has O and I, which are common)
- SCOUT (but has O and U)
- CLOPS (but has L, O, P, S)
- SLOTH (but has O, T, H)

""STOIC"" seems good because it has S, T, O, I, C - covering common letters while including C in position 5 (not position 1) and avoiding R, A, N, E.

Guess 2: STOIC -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(-) I(x) C(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Current deductions:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, A, N, E, S, T, I  
- Letters that ARE in the word: C, O  
- Positions we know:
  – C is NOT in position 1 (from CRANE) and NOT in position 5 (from STOIC).
  – O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from STOIC).

So the word contains both C and O, and must place them in positions they haven’t been ruled out of:
- C can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.
- O can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains C and O.
2. Uses none of the eliminated letters: R, A, N, E, S, T, I.
3. Places C and O in still-allowed positions.

Remaining common letters: D, L, U, B, M, P, G, H, Y, F, K, etc.

Candidate words:
- CLOUD – has C (pos 1, but C can’t be pos 1) ❌  
- COULD – C (pos 1) ❌  
- COMBO – contains O and C, but B and M are allowed; positions: C(1) ❌  
- COUCH – C(1) ❌  
- DOUCH – O(1), C(2) – both positions are allowed for these letters ✅  
- MOUTH – lacks C ❌  
- POUCH – lacks C ❌  
- BOCCE – contains E (eliminated) ❌  
- CLOMP – C(1) ❌  

Best remaining: DOUCH (D, O, U, C, H) – uses only allowed letters, includes both C and O in still-possible positions (C at 4, O at 2), and introduces new common letters D, U, H to test.

- M is not in the word.
- O is in position 2 (already known).
- C is in position 3 (✓).
- K is in position 4 (✓).
