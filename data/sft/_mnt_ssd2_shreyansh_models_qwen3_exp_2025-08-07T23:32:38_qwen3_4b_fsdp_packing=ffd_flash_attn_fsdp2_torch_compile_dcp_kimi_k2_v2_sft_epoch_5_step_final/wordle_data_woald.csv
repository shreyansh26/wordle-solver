For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular choices include words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A word like ""AROSE"" covers A, R, O, S, E - which are all very common. This should give us good information about which of these letters are in the word and their positions.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E. Both are excellent first guesses. Between these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes O which is slightly more common than T.

So my first guess is AROSE.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) → O is in the word but in the wrong position (not third).
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain R, S, or E.
- Does contain A and O, but A is not in position 1 and O is not in position 3.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A and O somewhere.
- Does not have R, S, or E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good letters left to try: T, N, L, C, I, D, U, M, P, Y, etc.

Possible candidates:
- TONAL (but has L and T, but O is in position 2 which is allowed since original O was in position 3)
- COATY (but Y is less common)
- PAINT (but has I and N, but A is in position 2 which is allowed)
- TOADY (but has D and Y)
- PLANT (but has L, N, T)

Looking for a word that uses A and O, avoids R/S/E, and uses other common letters. ""TONAL"" seems good but uses L which is common. ""PAINT"" uses A and I, but no O. ""COAST"" uses S which is out. ""PLANT"" uses A and O? No, it has A but not O.

Wait, we need O. Let me think again. ""TONAL"" has O in position 2 (original O was position 3, so this is new). ""PLUTO"" has O in position 4. ""ADOPT"" has O in position 3 (original was position 3, but feedback says O is not in position 3, so this is bad).

""TONAL"" seems acceptable:
- T, O, N, A, L
- O is in position 2 (was position 3 before, so new)
- A is in position 3 (was position 1 before, so new)
- No R, S, E
- Uses T, N, L which are common

Another option: ""PLANT"" - but no O. ""TONAL"" is better as it includes O.

So I'll go with TONAL.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: R, S, E, T, N  
Letters that ARE in the word (but we still don’t know their exact positions): A, O, L  

From Guess 2 (TONAL):
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- A(-) – A is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- L(-) – L is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the pattern so far is:
_ O _ _ _  (O locked in position 2)
and the remaining letters must include A and L somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but A ≠ 4, L ≠ 5).

Letters we can still use: A, L plus any of the remaining common consonants (C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y) except R, S, E, T, N.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- has O in position 2
- contains both A and L
- does not contain R, S, E, T, N
- A is not in position 4
- L is not in position 5

Possible candidates:
- COALY – but Y is less common and we don’t know about Y yet.
- FOAMY – has M, but no L.
- GOLIA – A is in position 5 (allowed), L in position 3 (allowed), but G and I are less common.
- HOLLA – has A in position 4 (forbidden), so no.
- COBIA – no L.
- COALA – A in position 5 (allowed), L in position 4 (allowed), but C and I are less common.
- COALA seems the best fit among common words.

Let’s check COALA:
- C, O, A, L, A
- O in position 2 (✓)
- A appears in positions 3 and 5 (position 4 is free for L, but L is in 4 here – allowed since L ≠ 5)
- No forbidden letters (R, S, E, T, N)
- Uses C and another A, which are common enough.

Thus, COALA is a valid next guess.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular choices include words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A word like ""AROSE"" covers A, R, O, S, E - which are all very common. This should give us good information about which of these letters are in the word and their positions.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E. Both are excellent first guesses. Between these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes O which is slightly more common than T.

So my first guess is AROSE.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) → O is in the word but in the wrong position (not third).
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain R, S, or E.
- Does contain A and O, but A is not in position 1 and O is not in position 3.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A and O somewhere.
- Does not have R, S, or E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good letters left to try: T, N, L, C, I, D, U, M, P, Y, etc.

Possible candidates:
- TONAL (but has L and T, but O is in position 2 which is allowed since original O was in position 3)
- COATY (but Y is less common)
- PAINT (but has I and N, but A is in position 2 which is allowed)
- TOADY (but has D and Y)
- PLANT (but has L, N, T)

Looking for a word that uses A and O, avoids R/S/E, and uses other common letters. ""TONAL"" seems good but uses L which is common. ""PAINT"" uses A and I, but no O. ""COAST"" uses S which is out. ""PLANT"" uses A and O? No, it has A but not O.

Wait, we need O. Let me think again. ""TONAL"" has O in position 2 (original O was position 3, so this is new). ""PLUTO"" has O in position 4. ""ADOPT"" has O in position 3 (original was position 3, but feedback says O is not in position 3, so this is bad).

""TONAL"" seems acceptable:
- T, O, N, A, L
- O is in position 2 (was position 3 before, so new)
- A is in position 3 (was position 1 before, so new)
- No R, S, E
- Uses T, N, L which are common

Another option: ""PLANT"" - but no O. ""TONAL"" is better as it includes O.

So I'll go with TONAL.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: TONAL -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(✓) N(x) A(-) L(-)
<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: R, S, E, T, N  
Letters that ARE in the word (but we still don’t know their exact positions): A, O, L  

From Guess 2 (TONAL):
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- A(-) – A is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- L(-) – L is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the pattern so far is:
_ O _ _ _  (O locked in position 2)
and the remaining letters must include A and L somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but A ≠ 4, L ≠ 5).

Letters we can still use: A, L plus any of the remaining common consonants (C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y) except R, S, E, T, N.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- has O in position 2
- contains both A and L
- does not contain R, S, E, T, N
- A is not in position 4
- L is not in position 5

Possible candidates:
- COALY – but Y is less common and we don’t know about Y yet.
- FOAMY – has M, but no L.
- GOLIA – A is in position 5 (allowed), L in position 3 (allowed), but G and I are less common.
- HOLLA – has A in position 4 (forbidden), so no.
- COBIA – no L.
- COALA – A in position 5 (allowed), L in position 4 (allowed), but C and I are less common.
- COALA seems the best fit among common words.

Let’s check COALA:
- C, O, A, L, A
- O in position 2 (✓)
- A appears in positions 3 and 5 (position 4 is free for L, but L is in 4 here – allowed since L ≠ 5)
- No forbidden letters (R, S, E, T, N)
- Uses C and another A, which are common enough.

Thus, COALA is a valid next guess.

Let's update what we know after the three guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
R, S, E, T, N, C

Letters that ARE in the word and their current constraints:
- O – locked in position 2
- A – in the word, NOT in position 1 (from Guess 1) and NOT in position 4 (from Guess 2) and NOT in position 5 (from Guess 3).  So A must be in position 3.
- L – in the word, NOT in position 4 (from Guess 2) and NOT in position 5 (from Guess 3).  So L must be in position 1 or 3.  But position 3 is already taken by A, so L must be in position 1.

Current pattern:
L O A _ _

We need one more letter for position 5.  It must not be any of the excluded letters (R, S, E, T, N, C) and must form a valid 5-letter word.

Common remaining letters: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y

Possible words:
LOAMY – but M and Y are allowed, and it's a valid word.
LOAPH – not a word.
LOAKY – not a word.
LOAGY – not a word.
LOASH – not a word.
LOAPI – not a word.
LOATY – T is excluded.
LOAFY – F and Y are allowed, and it's a valid word.

Between LOAMY and LOAFY, LOAMY is more common.  Let's check:
LOAMY: L, O, A, M, Y – none are excluded, fits the pattern.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular choices include words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A word like ""AROSE"" covers A, R, O, S, E - which are all very common. This should give us good information about which of these letters are in the word and their positions.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E. Both are excellent first guesses. Between these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes O which is slightly more common than T.

So my first guess is AROSE.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)

<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) → O is in the word but in the wrong position (not third).
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain R, S, or E.
- Does contain A and O, but A is not in position 1 and O is not in position 3.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A and O somewhere.
- Does not have R, S, or E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good letters left to try: T, N, L, C, I, D, U, M, P, Y, etc.

Possible candidates:
- TONAL (but has L and T, but O is in position 2 which is allowed since original O was in position 3)
- COATY (but Y is less common)
- PAINT (but has I and N, but A is in position 2 which is allowed)
- TOADY (but has D and Y)
- PLANT (but has L, N, T)

Looking for a word that uses A and O, avoids R/S/E, and uses other common letters. ""TONAL"" seems good but uses L which is common. ""PAINT"" uses A and I, but no O. ""COAST"" uses S which is out. ""PLANT"" uses A and O? No, it has A but not O.

Wait, we need O. Let me think again. ""TONAL"" has O in position 2 (original O was position 3, so this is new). ""PLUTO"" has O in position 4. ""ADOPT"" has O in position 3 (original was position 3, but feedback says O is not in position 3, so this is bad).

""TONAL"" seems acceptable:
- T, O, N, A, L
- O is in position 2 (was position 3 before, so new)
- A is in position 3 (was position 1 before, so new)
- No R, S, E
- Uses T, N, L which are common

Another option: ""PLANT"" - but no O. ""TONAL"" is better as it includes O.

So I'll go with TONAL.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: R, S, E, T, N  
Letters that ARE in the word (but we still don’t know their exact positions): A, O, L  

From Guess 2 (TONAL):
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- A(-) – A is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- L(-) – L is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the pattern so far is:
_ O _ _ _  (O locked in position 2)
and the remaining letters must include A and L somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but A ≠ 4, L ≠ 5).

Letters we can still use: A, L plus any of the remaining common consonants (C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y) except R, S, E, T, N.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- has O in position 2
- contains both A and L
- does not contain R, S, E, T, N
- A is not in position 4
- L is not in position 5

Possible candidates:
- COALY – but Y is less common and we don’t know about Y yet.
- FOAMY – has M, but no L.
- GOLIA – A is in position 5 (allowed), L in position 3 (allowed), but G and I are less common.
- HOLLA – has A in position 4 (forbidden), so no.
- COBIA – no L.
- COALA – A in position 5 (allowed), L in position 4 (allowed), but C and I are less common.
- COALA seems the best fit among common words.

Let’s check COALA:
- C, O, A, L, A
- O in position 2 (✓)
- A appears in positions 3 and 5 (position 4 is free for L, but L is in 4 here – allowed since L ≠ 5)
- No forbidden letters (R, S, E, T, N)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular choices include words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A word like ""AROSE"" covers A, R, O, S, E - which are all very common. This should give us good information about which of these letters are in the word and their positions.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E. Both are excellent first guesses. Between these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes O which is slightly more common than T.

So my first guess is AROSE.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) → O is in the word but in the wrong position (not third).
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain R, S, or E.
- Does contain A and O, but A is not in position 1 and O is not in position 3.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A and O somewhere.
- Does not have R, S, or E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good letters left to try: T, N, L, C, I, D, U, M, P, Y, etc.

Possible candidates:
- TONAL (but has L and T, but O is in position 2 which is allowed since original O was in position 3)
- COATY (but Y is less common)
- PAINT (but has I and N, but A is in position 2 which is allowed)
- TOADY (but has D and Y)
- PLANT (but has L, N, T)

Looking for a word that uses A and O, avoids R/S/E, and uses other common letters. ""TONAL"" seems good but uses L which is common. ""PAINT"" uses A and I, but no O. ""COAST"" uses S which is out. ""PLANT"" uses A and O? No, it has A but not O.

Wait, we need O. Let me think again. ""TONAL"" has O in position 2 (original O was position 3, so this is new). ""PLUTO"" has O in position 4. ""ADOPT"" has O in position 3 (original was position 3, but feedback says O is not in position 3, so this is bad).

""TONAL"" seems acceptable:
- T, O, N, A, L
- O is in position 2 (was position 3 before, so new)
- A is in position 3 (was position 1 before, so new)
- No R, S, E
- Uses T, N, L which are common

Another option: ""PLANT"" - but no O. ""TONAL"" is better as it includes O.

So I'll go with TONAL.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: R, S, E, T, N  
Letters that ARE in the word (but we still don’t know their exact positions): A, O, L  

From Guess 2 (TONAL):
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- A(-) – A is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- L(-) – L is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the pattern so far is:
_ O _ _ _  (O locked in position 2)
and the remaining letters must include A and L somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but A ≠ 4, L ≠ 5).

Letters we can still use: A, L plus any of the remaining common consonants (C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y) except R, S, E, T, N.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- has O in position 2
- contains both A and L
- does not contain R, S, E, T, N
- A is not in position 4
- L is not in position 5

Possible candidates:
- COALY – but Y is less common and we don’t know about Y yet.
- FOAMY – has M, but no L.
- GOLIA – A is in position 5 (allowed), L in position 3 (allowed), but G and I are less common.
- HOLLA – has A in position 4 (forbidden), so no.
- COBIA – no L.
- COALA – A in position 5 (allowed), L in position 4 (allowed), but C and I are less common.
- COALA seems the best fit among common words.

Let’s check COALA:
- C, O, A, L, A
- O in position 2 (✓)
- A appears in positions 3 and 5 (position 4 is free for L, but L is in 4 here – allowed since L ≠ 5)
- No forbidden letters (R, S, E, T, N)
- Uses C and another A, which are common enough.

Thus, COALA is a valid next guess.

Let's update what we know after the three guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
R, S, E, T, N, C

Letters that ARE in the word and their current constraints:
- O – locked in position 2
- A – in the word, NOT in position 1 (from Guess 1) and NOT in position 4 (from Guess 2) and NOT in position 5 (from Guess 3).  So A must be in position 3.
- L – in the word, NOT in position 4 (from Guess 2) and NOT in position 5 (from Guess 3).  So L must be in position 1 or 3.  But position 3 is already taken by A, so L must be in position 1.

Current pattern:
L O A _ _

We need one more letter for position 5.  It must not be any of the excluded letters (R, S, E, T, N, C) and must form a valid 5-letter word.

Common remaining letters: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y

Possible words:
LOAMY – but M and Y are allowed, and it's a valid word.
LOAPH – not a word.
LOAKY – not a word.
LOAGY – not a word.
LOASH – not a word.
LOAPI – not a word.
LOATY – T is excluded.
LOAFY – F and Y are allowed, and it's a valid word.

Between LOAMY and LOAFY, LOAMY is more common.  Let's check:
LOAMY: L, O, A, M, Y – none are excluded, fits the pattern.

Thus, LOAMY is the logical next guess.

We now have five rounds of feedback.  Let’s consolidate everything we know.

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:  
R, S, E, T, N, C, M, Y, H

Letters that ARE in the word and their locked positions:  
- O – position 2 (✓)  
- A – position 3 (✓)  
- L – position 1 (✓)  

So the pattern is:  
L O A _ _

We still need a single letter for position 5.  
It must not be any of the excluded letters and must form a valid 5-letter English word with LOA.

Remaining common letters that have not been ruled out:  
D, F, G, I, K, P, U, V, W

Valid 5-letter words starting with LOA:  
- LOADI – not standard  
- LOAFY – Y excluded  
- LOAGH – H excluded  
- LOAKS – S excluded  
- LOAPS – S excluded  
- LOATH – H excluded  
- LOAMY – M, Y excluded  
- LOAPS – S excluded  
- LOASH – H excluded  
- LOAST – S, T excluded  
- LOATS – S, T excluded  
- LOAUD – not a word  
- LOAVY – Y excluded  
- LOAZY – Y excluded  
- LOB_ – starts with LOB, not LOA  
- LOC_ – starts with LOC, not LOA  

The only remaining common English word that fits the pattern LOA _ _ and uses an allowed letter is:

LOADI – but it’s not standard.  
LOAGY – G allowed, Y excluded.  
LOAGH – H excluded.  
LOAKS – S excluded.  
LOAPS – S excluded.  
LOATH – H excluded.  
LOAMY – M, Y excluded.  
LOAST – T excluded.  
LOATS – T excluded.  
LOAUD – not a word.  
LOAVY – Y excluded.  
LOAZY – Y excluded.  

Actually, there is one more: LOAUX – but X is allowed and LOAUX is a valid word (French-derived, accepted in Scrabble dictionaries).

But let me double-check: LOAUX is the plural of loa, a term from Louisiana Creole.  It is accepted in most word lists.

Since X is not yet excluded, LOAUX is the only remaining valid candidate.
