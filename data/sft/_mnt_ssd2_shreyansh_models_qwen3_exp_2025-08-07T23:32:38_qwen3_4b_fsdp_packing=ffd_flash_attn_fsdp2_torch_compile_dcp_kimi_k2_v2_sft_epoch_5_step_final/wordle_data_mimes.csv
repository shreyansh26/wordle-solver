For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and the feedback will help narrow down future guesses. 

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE,"" but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a balanced starter word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Uses S and E in different positions.
2. Avoids A, R, O.
3. Introduces new common consonants and vowels (like T, I, N, L, etc.).

A good candidate is “STILE”:
- S is in position 1 (was in position 4 before).
- E is in position 5 (was in position 5 before, but since it’s wrong position, we need to move it; however, position 5 is the same, so this might not be optimal). Let me rethink.

Better: “STEEP” – but repeats E and we don’t know about T yet.  
Another: “TENSE” – uses T, N, S, E, but S is still in position 3 (was 4).  
Best: “STINE” – S, T, I, N, E. This introduces T, I, N while keeping S and E in new spots.

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STINE → S(-) T(x) I(-) N(x) E(-)

What we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, N
- Letters that ARE in the word (but positions unknown): S, E, I

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S, E, I exactly once each.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, T, N.
3. Uses three new consonants (to maximize information).

Valid letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need three more distinct letters from that set.  
A good combination is L, U, M (common, no repeats).

Candidate words:
- S, E, I, L, U → “SLEIU” – invalid, not a word.
- S, E, I, M, L → “SLEIM” – invalid.
- S, I, E, L, U → “SIEUL” – invalid.
- S, E, I, L, M → “SEILM” – invalid.

Try rearranging S, E, I with new consonants:
- “SLEEP” – repeats E, and P is new.  
  But we already know E is in the word; we don’t need to confirm it again in the same position.

Instead, let’s try “SIEVE”:
- Contains S, I, E, V (new), E (repeats E).  
  Still repeats E, which is acceptable because we know E is in the word, but we want to test new positions.

Better: “SIEVE” – positions:
- S: position 1 (was 4 in AROSE, 1 in STINE – new)
- I: position 2 (was 3 in STINE – new)
- E: position 4 (was 5 in AROSE, 5 in STINE – new)
- V: new letter
- E: position 5 (same as before – but we know it’s wrong position, so this is risky).

Let’s avoid repeating E in the same position.  
Another candidate: “SILVE” – but V is new, S, I, L, V, E.  
Positions:
- S: 1 (new)
- I: 2 (new)
- L: 3 (new)
- V: 4 (new)
- E: 5 (same as before – bad).

Try “SLEEK” – but K is new, and E repeats.  
Still, we don’t care about repeats; we care about positions.

Best valid word: “SIEVE” – even though E repeats, it’s the only valid word that places S, I, E in new positions and introduces V.

But let’s find one without repeating E: “SILVE” is invalid.  
“SIFLE” – invalid.  
“SILEX” – valid word: S, I, L, E, X.

Positions:
- S: 1 (new)
- I: 2 (new)
- L: 3 (new)
- E: 4 (new)
- X: 5 (new)

This introduces X, a less common letter, but it’s valid.

Another valid word: “SLEEP” – but E repeats in 4 and 5.

“SIEVE” is actually the only valid word that uses S, I, E in new positions and introduces a new consonant (V).  
Even with E in position 5 again, it’s still useful to test V in position 4.

Thus, the best guess is “SIEVE”.

1. Contains S, E, I exactly once each.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, T, N.
3. Uses three new consonants (to maximize information).

Valid letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need three more distinct letters from that set.  
A good combination is L, U, M (common, no repeats).

Candidate words:
- S, E, I, L, U → “SLEIU” – invalid, not a word.
- S, E, I, M, L → “SLEIM” – invalid.
- S, I, E, L, U → “SIEUL” – invalid.
- S, E, I, L, M → “SEILM” – invalid.

Try rearranging S, E, I with new consonants:
- “SLEEP” – repeats E, and P is new.  
  But we already know E is in the word; we don’t need to confirm it again in the same position.

Instead, let’s try “SIEVE”:
- Contains S, I, E, V (new), E (repeats E).  
  Still repeats E, which is acceptable because we know E is in the word, but we want to test new positions.

Better: “SIEVE” – positions:
- S: position 1 (was 4 in AROSE, 1 in STINE – new)
- I: position 2 (was 3 in STINE – new)
- E: position 4 (was 5 in AROSE, 5 in STINE – new)
- V: new letter
- E: position 5 (same as before – but we know it’s wrong position, so this is risky).

Let’s avoid repeating E in the same position.  
Another candidate: “SILVE” – but V is new, S, I, L, V, E.  
Positions:
- S: 1 (new)
- I: 2 (new)
- L: 3 (new)
- V: 4 (new)
- E: 5 (same as before – bad).

Try “SLEEK” – but K is new, and E repeats.  
Still, we don’t care about repeats; we care about positions.

Best valid word: “SIEVE” – even though E repeats, it’s the only valid word that places S, I, E in new positions and introduces V.

But let’s find one without repeating E: “SILVE” is invalid.  
“SIFLE” – invalid.  
“SILEX” – valid word: S, I, L, E, X.

Positions:
- S: 1 (new)
- I: 2 (new)
- L: 3 (new)
- E: 4 (new)
- X: 5 (new)

This introduces X, a less common letter, but it’s valid.

Another valid word: “SLEEP” – but E repeats in 4 and 5.

“SIEVE” is actually the only valid word that uses S, I, E in new positions and introduces a new consonant (V).  
Even with E in position 5 again, it’s still useful to test V in position 4.

Thus, the best guess is “SIEVE”.

Let's summarize what we now know after the three guesses:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, N, V  
Letters that ARE in the word: S, I, E (each exactly once, since they’ve only been marked “-” or “✓” once)

From the new feedback on SIEVE:
- I is in the correct position (position 2).  
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1 or 4.  
- E is in the word but NOT in position 3, 4, or 5.  
- V is not in the word.

So the pattern so far:
- Position 2 = I (locked)
- S must be in position 3 or 5 (since 1 and 4 are ruled out)
- E must be in position 1 or 2 (but 2 is already I), so E must be in position 1.

Thus the word must be:
E _ I S _

We need one more letter (position 5) that hasn’t been eliminated yet.  
Available consonants (not A, R, O, T, N, V): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z.

We want a common ending consonant.  
Possible words: E I S _ _

Scanning valid 5-letter words:
- E I S E N – invalid (N already out)  
- E I S E S – repeats S  
- E I S E N – invalid  
- E I S E R – R out  
- E I S E T – T out

- E I S E D – “EISED”? No.  
- E I S E K – “EISEK”? No.  
- E I S E B – “EISEB”? No.  

Wait, we need to think differently: the pattern is E I S _ _, but S must be in position 3 or 5.

Actually, from the feedback:
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4.  
  Positions ruled out for S: 1, 3, 4.  
  So S must be in position 2 or 5.  
  But position 2 is already I, so S must be in position 5.

- E is in the word but NOT in positions 3, 4, 5.  
  So E must be in position 1 or 2.  
  Position 2 is I, so E must be in position 1.

Thus the word must be: E _ _ I S

Now we need a letter for position 3 that hasn’t been eliminated.  
Available consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters: L, D, G, H, M, P.

Possible words:
- E L I D S – “ELIDS” – valid (archaic but listed in dictionaries).  
- E D I T S – T is out.  
- E G I L S – “EGILS” – no.  
- E H I D S – no.  
- E M I D S – no.  
- E P I D S – no.  
- E L I M S – “ELIMS” – valid (plural of elim).  
- E L I D S – “ELIDS” – valid.  
- E L I N S – N is out.  

Between “ELIDS” and “ELIMS”, “ELIDS” is more likely a common word in word-guessing contexts.

But let me double-check:  
- E L I D S – yes, “elids” means to omit or suppress.  
- E L I M S – “elims” is also valid.

Both fit, but “ELIDS” uses D (new letter) while “ELIMS” uses M (new letter).  
Both are valid, but I’ll go with “ELIDS” as it’s slightly more common.

Thus, the next guess is ELIDS.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and the feedback will help narrow down future guesses. 

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE,"" but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a balanced starter word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Uses S and E in different positions.
2. Avoids A, R, O.
3. Introduces new common consonants and vowels (like T, I, N, L, etc.).

A good candidate is “STILE”:
- S is in position 1 (was in position 4 before).
- E is in position 5 (was in position 5 before, but since it’s wrong position, we need to move it; however, position 5 is the same, so this might not be optimal). Let me rethink.

Better: “STEEP” – but repeats E and we don’t know about T yet.  
Another: “TENSE” – uses T, N, S, E, but S is still in position 3 (was 4).  
Best: “STINE” – S, T, I, N, E. This introduces T, I, N while keeping S and E in new spots.

What we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, N
- Letters that ARE in the word (but positions unknown): S, E, I

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S, E, I exactly once each.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, T, N.
3. Uses three new consonants (to maximize information).

Valid letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need three more distinct letters from that set.  
A good combination is L, U, M (common, no repeats).

Candidate words:
- S, E, I, L, U → “SLEIU” – invalid, not a word.
- S, E, I, M, L → “SLEIM” – invalid.
- S, I, E, L, U → “SIEUL” – invalid.
- S, E, I, L, M → “SEILM” – invalid.

Try rearranging S, E, I with new consonants:
- “SLEEP” – repeats E, and P is new.  
  But we already know E is in the word; we don’t need to confirm it again in the same position.

Instead, let’s try “SIEVE”:
- Contains S, I, E, V (new), E (repeats E).  
  Still repeats E, which is acceptable because we know E is in the word, but we want to test new positions.

Better: “SIEVE” – positions:
- S: position 1 (was 4 in AROSE, 1 in STINE – new)
- I: position 2 (was 3 in STINE – new)
- E: position 4 (was 5 in AROSE, 5 in STINE – new)
- V: new letter
- E: position 5 (same as before – but we know it’s wrong position, so this is risky).

Let’s avoid repeating E in the same position.  
Another candidate: “SILVE” – but V is new, S, I, L, V, E.  
Positions:
- S: 1 (new)
- I: 2 (new)
- L: 3 (new)
- V: 4 (new)
- E: 5 (same as before – bad).

Try “SLEEK” – but K is new, and E repeats.  
Still, we don’t care about repeats; we care about positions.

Best valid word: “SIEVE” – even though E repeats, it’s the only valid word that places S, I, E in new positions and introduces V.

But let’s find one without repeating E: “SILVE” is invalid.  
“SIFLE” – invalid.  
“SILEX” – valid word: S, I, L, E, X.

Positions:
- S: 1 (new)
- I: 2 (new)
- L: 3 (new)
- E: 4 (new)
- X: 5 (new)

This introduces X, a less common letter, but it’s valid.

Another valid word: “SLEEP” – but E repeats in 4 and 5.

“SIEVE” is actually the only valid word that uses S, I, E in new positions and introduces a new consonant (V).  
Even with E in position 5 again, it’s still useful to test V in position 4.

Thus, the best guess is “SIEVE”.

Common letters: L, D, G, H, M, P.

Possible words:
- E L I D S – “ELIDS” – valid (archaic but listed in dictionaries).  
- E D I T S – T is out.  
- E G I L S – “EGILS” – no.  
- E H I D S – no.  
- E M I D S – no.  
- E P I D S – no.  
- E L I M S – “ELIMS” – valid (plural of elim).  
- E L I D S – “ELIDS” – valid.  
- E L I N S – N is out.  

Between “ELIDS” and “ELIMS”, “ELIDS” is more likely a common word in word-guessing contexts.

But let me double-check:  
- E L I D S – yes, “elids” means to omit or suppress.  
- E L I M S – “elims” is also valid.

Both fit, but “ELIDS” uses D (new letter) while “ELIMS” uses M (new letter).  
Both are valid, but I’ll go with “ELIDS” as it’s slightly more common.

Thus, the next guess is ELIDS.

Let's update what we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, N, V, L, D  
Letters that ARE in the word: S, I, E (each exactly once)

From the new feedback on ELIDS:
- E is in the word but NOT in position 1 or 3.  
- L is not in the word.  
- I is in the word but NOT in position 3 (we already knew it's in position 2 from SIEVE).  
- D is not in the word.  
- S is in the word AND in the correct position 5.

So the pattern is:
- Position 5 = S (locked)
- Position 2 = I (locked)
- E must be in position 4 (since it can't be in 1, 3, or 5, and 2 is I)

Thus the word must be: _ I _ E S

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and the feedback will help narrow down future guesses. 

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE,"" but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a balanced starter word.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Uses S and E in different positions.
2. Avoids A, R, O.
3. Introduces new common consonants and vowels (like T, I, N, L, etc.).

A good candidate is “STILE”:
- S is in position 1 (was in position 4 before).
- E is in position 5 (was in position 5 before, but since it’s wrong position, we need to move it; however, position 5 is the same, so this might not be optimal). Let me rethink.

Better: “STEEP” – but repeats E and we don’t know about T yet.  
Another: “TENSE” – uses T, N, S, E, but S is still in position 3 (was 4).  
Best: “STINE” – S, T, I, N, E. This introduces T, I, N while keeping S and E in new spots.

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 2: STINE → S(-) T(x) I(-) N(x) E(-)

What we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, N
- Letters that ARE in the word (but positions unknown): S, E, I

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S, E, I exactly once each.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, T, N.
3. Uses three new consonants (to maximize information).

Valid letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need three more distinct letters from that set.  
A good combination is L, U, M (common, no repeats).

Candidate words:
- S, E, I, L, U → “SLEIU” – invalid, not a word.
- S, E, I, M, L → “SLEIM” – invalid.
- S, I, E, L, U → “SIEUL” – invalid.
- S, E, I, L, M → “SEILM” – invalid.

Try rearranging S, E, I with new consonants:
- “SLEEP” – repeats E, and P is new.  
  But we already know E is in the word; we don’t need to confirm it again in the same position.

Instead, let’s try “SIEVE”:
- Contains S, I, E, V (new), E (repeats E).  
  Still repeats E, which is acceptable because we know E is in the word, but we want to test new positions.

Better: “SIEVE” – positions:
- S: position 1 (was 4 in AROSE, 1 in STINE – new)
- I: position 2 (was 3 in STINE – new)
- E: position 4 (was 5 in AROSE, 5 in STINE – new)
- V: new letter
- E: position 5 (same as before – but we know it’s wrong position, so this is risky).

Let’s avoid repeating E in the same position.  
Another candidate: “SILVE” – but V is new, S, I, L, V, E.  
Positions:
- S: 1 (new)
- I: 2 (new)
- L: 3 (new)
- V: 4 (new)
- E: 5 (same as before – bad).

Try “SLEEK” – but K is new, and E repeats.  
Still, we don’t care about repeats; we care about positions.

Best valid word: “SIEVE” – even though E repeats, it’s the only valid word that places S, I, E in new positions and introduces V.

But let’s find one without repeating E: “SILVE” is invalid.  
“SIFLE” – invalid.  
“SILEX” – valid word: S, I, L, E, X.

Positions:
- S: 1 (new)
- I: 2 (new)
- L: 3 (new)
- E: 4 (new)
- X: 5 (new)

This introduces X, a less common letter, but it’s valid.

Another valid word: “SLEEP” – but E repeats in 4 and 5.

“SIEVE” is actually the only valid word that uses S, I, E in new positions and introduces a new consonant (V).  
Even with E in position 5 again, it’s still useful to test V in position 4.

Thus, the best guess is “SIEVE”.

Let's summarize what we now know after the three guesses:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, N, V  
Letters that ARE in the word: S, I, E (each exactly once, since they’ve only been marked “-” or “✓” once)

From the new feedback on SIEVE:
- I is in the correct position (position 2).  
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1 or 4.  
- E is in the word but NOT in position 3, 4, or 5.  
- V is not in the word.

So the pattern so far:
- Position 2 = I (locked)
- S must be in position 3 or 5 (since 1 and 4 are ruled out)
- E must be in position 1 or 2 (but 2 is already I), so E must be in position 1.

Thus the word must be:
E _ I S _

We need one more letter (position 5) that hasn’t been eliminated yet.  
Available consonants (not A, R, O, T, N, V): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z.

We want a common ending consonant.  
Possible words: E I S _ _

Scanning valid 5-letter words:
- E I S E N – invalid (N already out)  
- E I S E S – repeats S  
- E I S E N – invalid  
- E I S E R – R out  
- E I S E T – T out  
- E I S E D – valid word: “EISED”? No, not a word.  
- E I S E N – invalid  
- E I S E M – “EISEM”? No.  
- E I S E L – “EISEL”? No.  
- E I S E D – “EISED”? No.  
- E I S E K – “EISEK”? No.  
- E I S E B – “EISEB”? No.  

Wait, we need to think differently: the pattern is E I S _ _, but S must be in position 3 or 5.

Actually, from the feedback:
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4.  
  Positions ruled out for S: 1, 3, 4.  
  So S must be in position 2 or 5.  
  But position 2 is already I, so S must be in position 5.

- E is in the word but NOT in positions 3, 4, 5.  
  So E must be in position 1 or 2.  
  Position 2 is I, so E must be in position 1.

Thus the word must be: E _ _ I S

Now we need a letter for position 3 that hasn’t been eliminated.  
Available consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters: L, D, G, H, M, P.

Possible words:
- E L I D S – “ELIDS” – valid (archaic but listed in dictionaries).  
- E D I T S – T is out.  
- E G I L S – “EGILS” – no.  
- E H I D S – no.

- E L I M S – “ELIMS” – valid (plural of elim).  
- E L I D S – “ELIDS” – valid.  
- E L I N S – N is out.  

Between “ELIDS” and “ELIMS”, “ELIDS” is more likely a common word in word-guessing contexts.

But let me double-check:  
- E L I D S – yes, “elids” means to omit or suppress.  
- E L I M S – “elims” is also valid.

Both fit, but “ELIDS” uses D (new letter) while “ELIMS” uses M (new letter).  
Both are valid, but I’ll go with “ELIDS” as it’s slightly more common.

Thus, the next guess is ELIDS.

Let's update what we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, N, V, L, D  
Letters that ARE in the word: S, I, E (each exactly once)

From the new feedback on ELIDS:
- E is in the word but NOT in position 1 or 3.  
- L is not in the word.  
- I is in the word but NOT in position 3 (we already knew it's in position 2 from SIEVE).  
- D is not in the word.  
- S is in the word AND in the correct position 5.

So the pattern is:
- Position 5 = S (locked)
- Position 2 = I (locked)
- E must be in position 4 (since it can't be in 1, 3, or 5, and 2 is I)

Thus the word must be: _ I _ E S

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 3 that haven't been eliminated.  
Available letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (excluding A, R, O, T, N, V, L, D)

We want common consonants.  
Possible combinations:
- Position 1: B, C, F, G, H, M, P
- Position 3: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for valid 5-letter words matching _ I _ E S:
- B I F E S – ""BIFES"" – no
- B I C E S – ""BICES"" – no
- C I F E S – ""CIFES"" – no
- C I M E S – ""CIMES"" – no
- F I V E S – V is out
- G I V E S – V is out
- H I K E S – ""HIKES"" – yes, valid
- P I K E S – ""PIKES"" – yes, valid
- M I C E S – ""MICES"" – no
- M I N E S – N is out
- P I N E S – N is out
- H I M E S – ""HIKES"" already better

Between ""HIKES"" and ""PIKES"", both fit. ""HIKES"" is slightly more common.

Thus, the next guess is HIKES.
