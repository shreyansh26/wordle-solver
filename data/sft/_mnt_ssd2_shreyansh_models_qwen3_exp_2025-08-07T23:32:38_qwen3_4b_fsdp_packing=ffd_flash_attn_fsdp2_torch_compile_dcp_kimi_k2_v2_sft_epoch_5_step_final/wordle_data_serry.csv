### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 5 distinct common letters.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It uses 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
- All letters are distinct
- It's a valid 5-letter English word
- It covers vowels and common consonants

From the three guesses we now have:

Known letters and positions:
- S is in position 1 (✓)
- R is in position 4 (✓)

Known letters (but wrong positions):
- E is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from sperm feedback: E(-)).

Letters that are NOT in the word:
A, O, T, I, P, M

So the word looks like: S _ _ R _  
and must contain E somewhere in positions 2 or 5 (since it can’t be 3).

We still need two more distinct letters, chosen from the unused pool: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try placing E in position 2: S E _ R _
We need two new letters for positions 3 and 5. Common remaining consonants: N, L, D, etc.

A valid word fitting S E _ R _ is “SENOR” (but O is excluded).  
Next candidate: “SEWER” – W and second E, but E can only appear once (since it’s marked (-) in sperm, implying one occurrence).  
Another candidate: “SEVER” – V and second E, same issue.

Instead, place E in position 5: S _ _ R E  
We need two letters for positions 2 and 3.  
A common word: “SNARE” – but A is excluded.  
“SHRED” – H and D are allowed, and it’s a valid word.

Check positions:
S(✓) _ _ R(✓) E

“SHRED” satisfies:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 5 distinct common letters.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It uses 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
- All letters are distinct
- It's a valid 5-letter English word
- It covers vowels and common consonants

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
- The word contains R, S, E but not A or O.
- R is not in position 2, S is not in position 4, E is not in position 5.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses R, S, E in different positions.
2. Does not use A or O.
3. Uses two new letters to gather more information.

Good candidates are words like ""REBEL"", ""SERFS"", ""TRIES"", etc. I'll pick ""TRIES"" because:
- It uses R, S, E in new positions (R in 1, S in 3, E in 2).
- It introduces T and I, which are common letters not yet tested.
- It's a valid word.

Available letters left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We also know:
- R cannot be in position 1 or 2

- E cannot be in position 2 or 5

Let’s try to place R, S, E in new positions while introducing two new common letters.

A good candidate is ""CRANE"" but A is excluded.
Another candidate is ""SNARE"" but A is excluded.
""RESID"" has I excluded.
""REBUS"" has U and S; let’s check positions:

- E is in 3 (allowed, since it was only excluded from 2 and 5)

- It introduces T and I, which are common letters not yet tested.
- It's a valid word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Guess 2: tries -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) I(x) E(-) S(-)
<|im_end|>

From both guesses we now know:

Letters that are in the word (but in wrong positions):
- R (not in positions 2 or 1)
- S (not in positions 4 or 5)
- E (not in positions 5 or 2)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
A, O, T, I

So the word must contain R, S, E and two other letters that are not A, O, T, I.

Available letters left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We also know:
- R cannot be in position 1 or 2
- S cannot be in position 4 or 5
- E cannot be in position 2 or 5

Let’s try to place R, S, E in new positions while introducing two new common letters.

A good candidate is ""CRANE"" but A is excluded.
Another candidate is ""SNARE"" but A is excluded.
""RESID"" has I excluded.
""REBUS"" has U and S; let’s check positions:
R in 1 (invalid), so skip.
""PERSE"" has P and second E; E in 2 is invalid.
""SERFS"" has S in 1, E in 2 (invalid), so skip.
""SPERM"" has P and M; positions: S in 1, P in 2, E in 3, R in 4, M in 5.
Check constraints:
- S is in 1 (allowed, since it was only excluded from 4 and 5)
- E is in 3 (allowed, since it was only excluded from 2 and 5)
- R is in 4 (allowed, since it was excluded from 1 and 2)
- New letters P and M are introduced.
""SPERM"" is a valid word.

Let’s use ""SPERM"".

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: tries -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) I(x) E(-) S(-)
Guess 3: sperm -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) E(-) R(✓) M(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three guesses we now have:

Known letters and positions:
- S is in position 1 (✓)
- R is in position 4 (✓)

Known letters (but wrong positions):
- E is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from sperm feedback: E(-)).

Letters that are NOT in the word:
A, O, T, I, P, M

So the word looks like: S _ _ R _  
and must contain E somewhere in positions 2 or 5 (since it can’t be 3).

We still need two more distinct letters, chosen from the unused pool: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try placing E in position 2: S E _ R _
We need two new letters for positions 3 and 5. Common remaining consonants: N, L, D, etc.

A valid word fitting S E _ R _ is “SENOR” (but O is excluded).  
Next candidate: “SEWER” – W and second E, but E can only appear once (since it’s marked (-) in sperm, implying one occurrence).  
Another candidate: “SEVER” – V and second E, same issue.

Instead, place E in position 5: S _ _ R E  
We need two letters for positions 2 and 3.  
A common word: “SNARE” – but A is excluded.  
“SHRED” – H and D are allowed, and it’s a valid word.

Check positions:
S(✓) _ _ R(✓) E  
Letters used: S, H, R, E, D – all allowed.

“SHRED” satisfies:
- S in 1 (✓)
- R in 4 (✓)
- E in 5 (allowed)
- H and D are new and allowed.

So the next guess is “SHRED”.

From all feedback so far:

Known positions:
- S is fixed at position 1 (✓)
- R is fixed at position 4 (✓)

Known letters (must appear somewhere):
- E (but NOT in positions 2, 3, 5)

Letters already ruled out:
A, O, T, I, P, M, H, D

So the word structure is:
S _ _ R E   (because E must be in position 5)

We need two distinct letters for positions 2 and 3, chosen from the remaining unused set:
B, C, F, G, J, K, L, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Common consonants left: B, C, F, G, L, N, K

Possible combinations:
- S B E R E → SBERE (invalid, not a word)
- S C E R E → SCREE (valid word)
- S F E R E → SFERE (invalid)
- S G E R E → SGERE (invalid)
- S L E R E → SLERE (invalid)
- S N E R E → SNARE (but A is excluded)
- S K E R E → SKREE (valid, but less common)
- S C E R E → SCREE (valid, common)

""SCREE"" is a valid English word meaning to make a shrill, piercing sound, and fits the pattern perfectly.

Therefore, the next logical guess is ""SCREE"".

Current constraints:

- Fixed letters: S _ _ R E  
- Letters known to be in the word: S, R, E  
- Letters already ruled out: A, O, T, I, P, M, H, D, C  

The two E’s in scree feedback (last two letters both marked “-”) tell us:
- The word contains exactly one E, and it is NOT in positions 3 or 5.

Therefore the only remaining place for E is position 2.

So the pattern is now: S E _ R _  
with the final blank needing a single letter that has NOT yet been eliminated.

Unused letters (from the alphabet excluding all ruled-out ones):  
B, F, G, J, K, L, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid English 5-letter word matching S E _ R _.

- SELAR – invalid
- SENOR – invalid (O ruled out)

The only common, valid word left is **SEWER**, using W (which has never been tried).

Check: W is not in the banned list, and SEWER is a valid English word.
