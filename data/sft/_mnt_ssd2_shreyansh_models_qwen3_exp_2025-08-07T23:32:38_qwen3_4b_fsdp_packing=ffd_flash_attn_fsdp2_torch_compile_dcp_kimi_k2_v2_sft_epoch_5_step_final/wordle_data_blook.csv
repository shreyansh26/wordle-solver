For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and consonants. This will give me good information about which letters are present in the secret word.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" because it includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. This might give slightly better coverage. After considering, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a classic strong opener.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → so the 3rd letter is O
- S is NOT in the word (x)

A strong next guess would be “POINT”:
- P, I, N, T are all common letters not yet tested.
- O is in the correct position.
- It avoids all ruled-out letters (A, R, S, E).

Other candidates like “COULD”, “MOUNT”, or “POINT” are equally valid, but I’ll go with POINT to test P, I, N, T.

Let's update what we now know from both guesses.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
   - Word pattern: _ _ O _ _
   - Eliminated letters: A, R, S, E

2. POINT → P(x) O(-) I(x) N(x) T(x)
   - The letter O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (since it showed “-” instead of “✓”).
   - Eliminated letters from this guess: P, I, N, T
   - So now we know O is NOT in position 3 either (because the feedback was “-”).

Combining these facts:
- The word contains O, but O is NOT in position 3.
- The word pattern is therefore: _ _ _ O _  (O in position 4) or _ _ O _ _ with O somewhere else (but we just learned O cannot be in position 3). Actually, the feedback for POINT shows O(-), meaning O is in the word but not in position 3, so the only remaining positions for O are 1, 2, 4, or 5.

But wait, in AROSE we had O(✓) in position 3, which would have been impossible if O(-) in POINT also means O is not in position 3. This implies a contradiction unless we interpret that the ✓ in AROSE was for position 3, and the - in POINT for position 3 is consistent (O is in the word but not in position 3). So the word must contain O, and O is NOT in position 3.

So possible patterns:
- O _ _ _ _  (O in position 1)
- _ O _ _ _  (O in position 2)
- _ _ _ O _  (O in position 4)
- _ _ _ _ O  (O in position 5)

But we also know from AROSE that position 3 is NOT O (since AROSE had O(✓) in position 3, which would have been impossible if POINT later showed O(-) in position 3). Actually, the feedback from AROSE was O(✓) meaning O was in position 3, but the feedback from POINT was O(-) meaning O is in the word but not in position 3. This is impossible unless the feedback was misinterpreted.

Wait, let's re-examine the feedback carefully:

- AROSE feedback: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x) → O is in position 3 and correct.
- POINT feedback: P(x) O(-) I(x) N(x) T(x) → O is in the word but not in position 3.

This is a contradiction because the first guess already confirmed O is in position 3, yet the second guess says O is not in position 3. This suggests the feedback for POINT's O is actually indicating that O is in the word but not in position 3, which would contradict the first guess's ✓ for position 3.

This implies that the feedback for POINT's O is not referring to position 3. Looking back at POINT's structure:
P(1) O(2) I(3) N(4) T(5)
The feedback for O was (-), meaning O is in the word but not in position 2.

So combining:
- From AROSE: O is in position 3 (✓).
- From POINT: O is in the word but not in position 2 (-).

These two are consistent because O is confirmed in position 3 by AROSE, and POINT's feedback just confirms O is not in position 2 (which is already satisfied since O is in position 3).

Therefore, the word is definitely _ _ O _ _ with O in position 3.

Eliminated letters so far: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T.

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y.

I need a 5-letter word with O in position 3 and none of the eliminated letters.

Possible candidates:
- BLOWY
- CLOWN (but N is eliminated)
- DOLLY
- FOLLY
- GOLLY
- HOMER (E is eliminated)
- LUMBO

Looking at these, ""BLOWY"" uses B, L, W, Y - none of which are eliminated.
""BLOWY"" fits _ _ O _ _ with O in position 3.

Let's check:

- B, L, W, Y are not in the eliminated list.

This seems like a good next guess to test B, L, W, Y.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and consonants. This will give me good information about which letters are present in the secret word.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" because it includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. This might give slightly better coverage. After considering, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a classic strong opener.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → so the 3rd letter is O
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

Therefore the secret word is of the form _ _ O _ _ and none of A, R, S, E appear anywhere in it.  
I now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in the 3rd position.
2. Does not contain A, R, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since O is already placed).

A strong next guess would be “POINT”:
- P, I, N, T are all common letters not yet tested.
- O is in the correct position.
- It avoids all ruled-out letters (A, R, S, E).

Other candidates like “COULD”, “MOUNT”, or “POINT” are equally valid, but I’ll go with POINT to test P, I, N, T.

Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(-) I(x) N(x) T(x)

Let's update what we now know from both guesses.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
   - Word pattern: _ _ O _ _
   - Eliminated letters: A, R, S, E

2. POINT → P(x) O(-) I(x) N(x) T(x)
   - The letter O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (since it showed “-” instead of “✓”).
   - Eliminated letters from this guess: P, I, N, T
   - So now we know O is NOT in position 3 either (because the feedback was “-”).

Combining these facts:
- The word contains O, but O is NOT in position 3.
- The word pattern is therefore: _ _ _ O _  (O in position 4) or _ _ O _ _ with O somewhere else (but we just learned O cannot be in position 3). Actually, the feedback for POINT shows O(-), meaning O is in the word but not in position 3, so the only remaining positions for O are 1, 2, 4, or 5.

But wait, in AROSE we had O(✓) in position 3, which would have been impossible if O(-) in POINT also means O is not in position 3. This implies a contradiction unless we interpret that the ✓ in AROSE was for position 3, and the - in POINT for position 3 is consistent (O is in the word but not in position 3). So the word must contain O, and O is NOT in position 3.

So possible patterns:
- O _ _ _ _  (O in position 1)
- _ O _ _ _  (O in position 2)
- _ _ _ O _  (O in position 4)
- _ _ _ _ O  (O in position 5)

But we also know from AROSE that position 3 is NOT O (since AROSE had O(✓) in position 3, which would have been impossible if POINT later showed O(-) in position 3). Actually, the feedback from AROSE was O(✓) meaning O was in position 3, but the feedback from POINT was O(-) meaning O is in the word but not in position 3. This is impossible unless the feedback was misinterpreted.

Wait, let's re-examine the feedback carefully:

- AROSE feedback: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x) → O is in position 3 and correct.
- POINT feedback: P(x) O(-) I(x) N(x) T(x) → O is in the word but not in position 3.

This is a contradiction because the first guess already confirmed O is in position 3, yet the second guess says O is not in position 3. This suggests the feedback for POINT's O is actually indicating that O is in the word but not in position 3, which would contradict the first guess's ✓ for position 3.

This implies that the feedback for POINT's O is not referring to position 3. Looking back at POINT's structure:
P(1) O(2) I(3) N(4) T(5)
The feedback for O was (-), meaning O is in the word but not in position 2.

So combining:
- From AROSE: O is in position 3 (✓).
- From POINT: O is in the word but not in position 2 (-).

These two are consistent because O is confirmed in position 3 by AROSE, and POINT's feedback just confirms O is not in position 2 (which is already satisfied since O is in position 3).

Therefore, the word is definitely _ _ O _ _ with O in position 3.

Eliminated letters so far: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T.

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y.

I need a 5-letter word with O in position 3 and none of the eliminated letters.

Possible candidates:
- BLOWY
- CLOWN (but N is eliminated)
- DOLLY
- FOLLY
- GOLLY
- HOMER (E is eliminated)
- LUMBO
- MOLDO (but D and M are allowed, but O is already in position 3)
- WOLFS (S is eliminated)

Looking at these, ""BLOWY"" uses B, L, W, Y - none of which are eliminated.
""BLOWY"" fits _ _ O _ _ with O in position 3.

Let's check:
B L O W Y
- B, L, W, Y are not in the eliminated list.
- O is in position 3.

This seems like a good next guess to test B, L, W, Y.

   ⇒ Remaining letters must come from positions 4 and 5, and cannot be any of:  
     A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, W, Y.

Remaining unused common letters: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, U, V.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with “BLO” and ends with two letters from the allowed set.

Possible endings:
- C, D, F, G, H, K, M, U, V.

Quick scan:
- BLOWN – N is eliminated.
- BLOKE – K and E; E is eliminated.
- BLOOM – O and M; O is already used in position 3.
- BLOKE – already noted.
- BLOCH – C and H; both allowed.
- BLOOM – invalid (double O).
- BLOKE – invalid (E).
- BLOCH – B L O C H → letters C and H are allowed.

“BLOCH” is a valid English word (a surname or variant spelling), but let’s check if any other common word fits.

Another candidate: “BLOKE” – but E is eliminated.

“BLOOM” – invalid (O already used).

“BLOCH” seems to be the only valid option here.

Let’s verify:
B L O C H  
- B, L, O already confirmed in positions 1, 2, 3.  
- C and H are not in the eliminated list.  
- No forbidden letters.

Hence, the next logical guess is “BLOCH”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and consonants. This will give me good information about which letters are present in the secret word.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" because it includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. This might give slightly better coverage. After considering, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a classic strong opener.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → so the 3rd letter is O
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

Therefore the secret word is of the form _ _ O _ _ and none of A, R, S, E appear anywhere in it.  
I now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in the 3rd position.
2. Does not contain A, R, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since O is already placed).

A strong next guess would be “POINT”:
- P, I, N, T are all common letters not yet tested.
- O is in the correct position.
- It avoids all ruled-out letters (A, R, S, E).

Other candidates like “COULD”, “MOUNT”, or “POINT” are equally valid, but I’ll go with POINT to test P, I, N, T.

Let's update what we now know from both guesses.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
   - Word pattern: _ _ O _ _
   - Eliminated letters: A, R, S, E

2. POINT → P(x) O(-) I(x) N(x) T(x)
   - The letter O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (since it showed “-” instead of “✓”).
   - Eliminated letters from this guess: P, I, N, T
   - So now we know O is NOT in position 3 either (because the feedback was “-”).

Combining these facts:
- The word contains O, but O is NOT in position 3.
- The word pattern is therefore: _ _ _ O _  (O in position 4) or _ _ O _ _ with O somewhere else (but we just learned O cannot be in position 3). Actually, the feedback for POINT shows O(-), meaning O is in the word but not in position 3, so the only remaining positions for O are 1, 2, 4, or 5.

But wait, in AROSE we had O(✓) in position 3, which would have been impossible if O(-) in POINT also means O is not in position 3. This implies a contradiction unless we interpret that the ✓ in AROSE was for position 3, and the - in POINT for position 3 is consistent (O is in the word but not in position 3). So the word must contain O, and O is NOT in position 3.

So possible patterns:
- O _ _ _ _  (O in position 1)
- _ O _ _ _  (O in position 2)
- _ _ _ O _  (O in position 4)
- _ _ _ _ O  (O in position 5)

But we also know from AROSE that position 3 is NOT O (since AROSE had O(✓) in position 3, which would have been impossible if POINT later showed O(-) in position 3). Actually, the feedback from AROSE was O(✓) meaning O was in position 3, but the feedback from POINT was O(-) meaning O is in the word but not in position 3. This is impossible unless the feedback was misinterpreted.

Wait, let's re-examine the feedback carefully:

- AROSE feedback: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x) → O is in position 3 and correct.
- POINT feedback: P(x) O(-) I(x) N(x) T(x) → O is in the word but not in position 3.

This is a contradiction because the first guess already confirmed O is in position 3, yet the second guess says O is not in position 3. This suggests the feedback for POINT's O is actually indicating that O is in the word but not in position 3, which would contradict the first guess's ✓ for position 3.

This implies that the feedback for POINT's O is not referring to position 3. Looking back at POINT's structure:
P(1) O(2) I(3) N(4) T(5)
The feedback for O was (-), meaning O is in the word but not in position 2.

So combining:
- From AROSE: O is in position 3 (✓).
- From POINT: O is in the word but not in position 2 (-).

These two are consistent because O is confirmed in position 3 by AROSE, and POINT's feedback just confirms O is not in position 2 (which is already satisfied since O is in position 3).

Therefore, the word is definitely _ _ O _ _ with O in position 3.

Eliminated letters so far: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T.

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y.

I need a 5-letter word with O in position 3 and none of the eliminated letters.

Possible candidates:
- BLOWY

- DOLLY
- FOLLY
- GOLLY
- HOMER (E is eliminated)
- LUMBO
- MOLDO (but D and M are allowed, but O is already in position 3)
- WOLFS (S is eliminated)

Looking at these, ""BLOWY"" uses B, L, W, Y - none of which are eliminated.
""BLOWY"" fits _ _ O _ _ with O in position 3.

Let's check:
B L O W Y
- B, L, W, Y are not in the eliminated list.

This seems like a good next guess to test B, L, W, Y.

- V and D → “BLOVD” (invalid)

Looking at the remaining letters, the only valid English word that starts with “BLO” and uses only the allowed letters is “BLOOM”, but “O” is already used in position 3 and cannot appear again in positions 4 or 5 without repeating, which is generally allowed unless specified otherwise, but we have no restriction against it. However, “O” is already confirmed in position 3, and we have no feedback against it appearing again.

But checking the elimination list, we have not eliminated “O”, so it’s possible. However, “BLOOM” uses O in position 4, which is allowed.

Another possibility is “BLOKE”, but “E” is eliminated.

“BLOOM” seems to be the only valid word left that fits the pattern and uses allowed letters.

Let’s verify:
B L O O M
- B, L, O confirmed in positions 1, 2, 3
- O in position 4 is allowed (not eliminated)
- M is allowed (not eliminated)
- No forbidden letters

Therefore, the next guess should be “BLOOM”.

This will give me good information about which letters are present in the secret word.\n\nHowever, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" because it includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. This might give slightly better coverage.

Actually, the feedback for POINT shows O(-), meaning O is in the word but not in position 3, so the only remaining positions for O are 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nBut wait, in AROSE we had O(✓) in position 3, which would have been impossible if O(-) in POINT also means O is not in position 3. This implies a contradiction unless we interpret that the ✓ in AROSE was for position 3, and the - in POINT for position 3 is consistent (O is in the word but not in position 3).

This is impossible unless the feedback was misinterpreted.\n\nWait, let\'s re-examine the feedback carefully:\n\n- AROSE feedback: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x) → O is in position 3 and correct.\n- POINT feedback: P(x) O(-) I(x) N(x) T(x) → O is in the word but not in position 3.\n\nThis is a contradiction because the first guess already confirmed O is in position 3, yet the second guess says O is not in position 3. This suggests the feedback for POINT\'s O is actually indicating that O is in the word but not in position 3, which would contradict the first guess\'s ✓ for position 3.\n\nThis implies that the feedback for POINT\'s O is not referring to position 3.
