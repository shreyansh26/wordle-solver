### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. Common letters in 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should cover a variety of these letters without repeating any. 

Some popular choices among word game players are:
- AROSE (covers A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)

I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it includes 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback so far:

Letters we know are NOT in the word:  
A, R, S, E, P, N, T, B, D

Letters we know ARE in the word (but positions still unknown):

From Guess 1 (AROSE) we had O(✓) – this means O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3) **at the time of that guess**.  
From Guess 2 (POINT) we had O(-) – this means O is in the word but not in position 2.  
From Guess 3 (COBID) we had O(-) – this means O is in the word but not in position 2 again (consistent).

The only way both can be true is if O is in position 3 (from Guess 1) and the later feedback about positions 2 and 4/5 simply confirm it’s not elsewhere. So we can safely treat O as fixed in position 3.

Letters still allowed:  
Consonants: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels: U (since A, E are out and I is already in)

We need to place:  
- C somewhere (not position 1, since COBID gave C(✓) in position 1, but that was a ✓ for that specific guess, so C is in the word and in position 1) – wait, in COBID C was in position 1 and got C(✓), so C is in position 1.

So far we have:  
C _ O _ _

Letters left to place: I and one more letter (since we have 5 letters total).  
I is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 (from POINT and COBID). So I must be in position 2 or 5.

We also need one more letter (not yet used). Common remaining letters: L, M, G, H, K, etc.

Let’s try to form a valid word with these constraints.

Option 1: I in position 2  
C I O _ _  
Need a 5th letter. Possible: CIOCK? No, C is already used. CIOGL? Not a word. CIOCK? No. CIO… nothing common.

Option 2: I in position 5

Now we need a 2nd and 4th letter.  
Possible letters: L, M, G, H, K, etc.

Let’s try C + L + O + M + I → CLomi? Not a word.  
C + H + O + L + I → CHOIL – yes, that’s a valid 5-letter word.

Check constraints:  
- C in position 1: ✓ (from COBID)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. Common letters in 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should cover a variety of these letters without repeating any. 

Some popular choices among word game players are:
- AROSE (covers A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)

I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it includes 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter).
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word has an O in the 3rd position.
- The letters A, R, S, E are not in the word at all.
- We still need to find the other four letters, none of which are A, R, S, E.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since O is already placed).

A balanced second guess that uses new common letters while keeping O in the 3rd spot is “POINT”:
- P – common consonant, not yet tested.
- O – already confirmed in position 3 (so we’ll keep it fixed).
- I – another vowel not yet tested.
- N – common consonant.
- T – common consonant.

This gives us maximum new information while respecting the known constraints.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(-) I(-) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on POINT:
- P(x) – P is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (contradicts earlier feedback that O was ✓ in position 3).  
  This means the feedback must have been misinterpreted: the “✓” only indicates correct position for that specific guess, not an absolute fact.  
  Re-evaluating: the first feedback shows O is in the word but position unknown (because ✓ is per-guess), and the second feedback shows O is in the word but in the wrong position (because it’s marked “-”).  
  Therefore, O is in the word, but NOT in position 3 (since POINT gave O(-)).

Letters we now know are NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, N, T.

Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know:
- O is somewhere in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- I is in the word but not in position 3 (from POINT feedback).

Let’s pick a word that:
- Uses O in a new position (e.g., position 1 or 2).
- Uses I in a new position (e.g., position 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- Introduces new common consonants (e.g., C, L, M, D).

A good candidate is “COBID”:
- C – common consonant, not yet tested.
- O – in position 2 (new position).
- B – common consonant, not yet tested.
- I – in position 4 (new position).
- D – common consonant, not yet tested.

This tests 5 new letters while respecting all constraints.

From the latest feedback (CHOIL):

- C(✓) – C is in position 1 and correct.
- H(✓) – H is in position 2 and correct.
- O(✓) – O is in position 3 and correct.
- I(-) – I is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- L(-) – L is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the word is now known to be:
C H O _ _

We still need two letters: one for position 4 and one for position 5.  
Letters already ruled out: A, R, S, E, P, N, T, B, D, I (because I is not in position 4), L (because L is not in position 5).

Remaining unused letters: F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know I must appear somewhere, but not in position 4. The only remaining spot for I is position 5.

So the word must be:
C H O _ I

Now we just need a valid consonant for position 4 from the remaining letters. Common choices: F, G, K, M.

Possible words:
- CHOCK
- CHOKE
- CHOKI (not valid)
- CHOMI (not valid)

Between CHOCK and CHOKE, both are valid. Let's pick CHOCK since C is already in position 1 and we haven't tested K yet.

But wait, we need to check if K is allowed. Yes, K hasn't been used or ruled out.

Actually, let's verify:
- C H O C K – but C is already in position 1, and we can have repeated letters unless ruled out. No feedback says no repeats.

However, we have no info against K. But let's think if there's a better fit. CHOKE is also valid.

But since we have only one unknown letter (position 4), and we know I must be in position 5, let's try CHOCK first.

But wait, the feedback for CHOIL showed L(-), meaning L is in the word but not in position 5. So L could be in position 4. But we have:
C H O _ _

If L is in position 4, then position 5 must be another letter. But we have I not in position 4, so I could be in position 5.

So possible words:
- C H O L I (CHOLI) – valid word (a type of garment)
- C H O K I (not valid)
- C H O M I (not valid)

Between CHOLI and CHOCK, CHOLI seems more likely as a valid word.

But let's check:
- CHOLI: C H O L I – fits all constraints:
  - C(✓) H(✓) O(✓) L(-) I(-) – L is in word but not in position 5 (here it's in 4), I is in word but not in position 4 (here it's in 5).

So CHOLI is a valid guess.

But wait, the feedback for CHOIL had L(-) meaning L is in word but not in position 5. So L could be in position 4.

Thus, the word could be CHOLI.

But let's also consider CHOCK:
- C H O C K – but K hasn't been tested, and we have no info against it. But we have I not in position 4, so I would have to be in position 5, making it CHO C K, but that would require I to be in position 5, which isn't the case here. So CHOCK is possible if I isn't needed, but we know I is in the word.

Thus, the word must contain I, so position 5 must be I, making it C H O _ I.

With L possibly in position 4, giving CHOLI.

But let's check if there are other possibilities. If L is not in position 4, then position 4 must be another letter, but we have no info on other letters.

But since L is in the word (from L(-)), and positions 1-3 are C, H, O, and I must be in position 5, the only place left for L is position 4.

Thus, the word must be CHOLI.

But wait, let's verify:
- CHOLI: C H O L I
  - C(✓) H(✓) O(✓) L(-) I(-)
  - L is in word but not in position 5 (it's in 4) – correct
  - I is in word but not in position 4 (it's in 5) – correct

This fits perfectly.

Thus, the next guess is CHOLI.

Based on all feedback, we now know the word is C H O _ _ with I and L still needing placement. The only valid arrangement fitting all constraints is:
