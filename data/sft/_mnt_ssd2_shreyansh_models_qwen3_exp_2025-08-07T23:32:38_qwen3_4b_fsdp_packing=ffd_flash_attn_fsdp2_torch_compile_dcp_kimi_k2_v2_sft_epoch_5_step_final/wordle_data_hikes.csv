For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once. Some good starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that incorporates several of these. ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice as it contains A, R, O, S, E - five of the most common letters. This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word at all (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word contains S and E, but:
- S is NOT in the 4th position.
- E is NOT in the 5th position.

We now know:
- Letters to include: S, E
- Letters to exclude: A, R, O
- Positions to avoid for S: 4
- Positions to avoid for E: 5

Next, I want a word that:
1. Uses S and E in new positions.
2. Introduces new common letters (T, L, N, I, C, etc.).
3. Avoids A, R, O.

A good candidate is ""STILE"":
- S in position 1 (new position).
- E in position 4 (new position).
- Introduces T, I, L (common letters not yet tested).

Let me verify:
- No A, R, O.
- S and E are both present but in different positions from AROSE.

From the two guesses we have:

AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
STILE → S(-) T(x) I(-) L(x) E(-)

What we now know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, L.
- Letters definitely IN the word: S, E, I.
- Position constraints:
  – S cannot be in position 1 or 4.
  – E cannot be in position 5.
  – I cannot be in position 3.

So the target word contains S, E, I, and no A, R, O, T, L.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S, E, I exactly once each.
2. Places S somewhere other than positions 1 or 4.
3. Places E somewhere other than position 5.
4. Places I somewhere other than position 3.
5. Uses only the remaining letters (from the remaining alphabet excluding A, R, O, T, L).

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s list possible placements for S, E, I:
- S can be in 2, 3, or 5.
- E can be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- I can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We need to place S, E, I plus two more distinct letters from the allowed set.

A quick scan of common patterns:
- If S is in position 2, E could be 1,3,4 and I could be 1,4,5.
- If S is in position 3, E could be 1,2,4 and I could be 1,2,4,5.
- If S is in position 5, E could be 1,2,3,4 and I could be 1,2,4.

Let’s pick a word that satisfies these constraints and uses common remaining letters. A good candidate is ""SPICE"":
- S (pos 1) – but S cannot be in pos 1 (from STILE feedback). So SPICE is invalid.

Next candidate: ""SINCE"":
- S (pos 1) – invalid again.

Next: ""SIEVE"":
- S (pos 1) – invalid.

Next: ""SHELF"" – but F is allowed, but we need to check positions:
- S (pos 1) – invalid.

Next: ""SICKO"" – contains O (invalid).

Next: ""SINGE"":
- S (pos 1) – invalid.

Next: ""SWEET"" – but T is invalid.

Next: ""SHINE"":
- S (pos 1) – invalid.

Next: ""SIEVE"" – already considered.

Next: ""SINUS"" – but S is repeated (invalid).

Next: ""SIPES"":
- S (pos 1) – invalid.

Next: ""SIEVE"" – again.

Next: ""SIEVE"" – same issue.

Let’s try placing S in position 2:
- S _ _ _ _
- E could be 1,3,4
- I could be 1,4,5

Example: ""ESSEX"" – but X is allowed, but E is repeated (invalid).

Next: ""ESCAL"" – but L is invalid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once. Some good starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that incorporates several of these. ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice as it contains A, R, O, S, E - five of the most common letters. This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word at all (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word contains S and E, but:
- S is NOT in the 4th position.
- E is NOT in the 5th position.

We now know:
- Letters to include: S, E
- Letters to exclude: A, R, O
- Positions to avoid for S: 4
- Positions to avoid for E: 5

Next, I want a word that:
1. Uses S and E in new positions.
2. Introduces new common letters (T, L, N, I, C, etc.).
3. Avoids A, R, O.

A good candidate is ""STILE"":
- S in position 1 (new position).
- E in position 4 (new position).
- Introduces T, I, L (common letters not yet tested).

Let me verify:
- No A, R, O.
- S and E are both present but in different positions from AROSE.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once. Some good starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that incorporates several of these. ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice as it contains A, R, O, S, E - five of the most common letters. This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word at all (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word contains S and E, but:
- S is NOT in the 4th position.
- E is NOT in the 5th position.

We now know:
- Letters to include: S, E
- Letters to exclude: A, R, O
- Positions to avoid for S: 4
- Positions to avoid for E: 5

Next, I want a word that:
1. Uses S and E in new positions.
2. Introduces new common letters (T, L, N, I, C, etc.).
3. Avoids A, R, O.

A good candidate is ""STILE"":
- S in position 1 (new position).
- E in position 4 (new position).
- Introduces T, I, L (common letters not yet tested).

Let me verify:
- No A, R, O.
- S and E are both present but in different positions from AROSE.

We need a 5-letter word that uses S, E, I in allowable positions and introduces new common letters (N, C, D, U, etc.) that haven’t been tested yet.

Candidate word: “NISES”  
- Uses N, I, S, E.  
- I is in position 2 (allowed).  
- E is in position 3 (allowed).  
- S is in positions 2 and 5 (positions 5 is allowed for S).  
- Introduces N, which is untested.

Let’s check for conflicts:
- No A, R, O, T, L.  
- S positions: 2 and 5 (no conflict).  
- E position: 3 (no conflict).  
- I position: 2 (no conflict).  

“NISES” is a valid English word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STILE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(-) L(x) E(-)
Model answer is not in the correct format
Guess 4: NISES -> FEEDBACK: N(x) I(✓) S(-) E(✓) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on NISES:
N(x) – N is not in the word.  
I(✓) – I is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).  
S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 3.  
E(✓) – E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).  
S(✓) – S is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So we now know:
- Fixed letters: I in position 2, E in position 4, S in position 5.  
- Letters definitely out: A, R, O, T, L, N.  
- Still need to determine positions 1 and 3.  
- Allowed letters so far: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus any others not yet ruled out).

We need a 5-letter word with the pattern:
_ I _ E S

Common English words fitting this pattern:
- B I D E S  
- C I V E S  
- C I R C L E – too long  
- C I F F S – but F is only in position 3, and we have no info on F yet.  
- D I V E S  
- F I V E S  
- M I C E S  
- P I C K S – but K is in position 5, and we know S is in position 5, so invalid.  
- W I D E S  

Among these, ""C I V E S"" and ""D I V E S"" are good candidates.  
Let’s pick ""CIVES"" since C and V haven’t been tested yet.

Check constraints:
- C and V are allowed (not in the eliminated list).  
- Pattern: C I V E S – positions 1,2,3,4,5.  
- No conflicts with previous feedback.

So the next guess is CIVES.

From the latest feedback on CIVES:

So the pattern is now locked to:
_ I _ E S

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
A, R, O, T, L, N, C, V.

We need to determine the first and third letters.  
Available letters (not yet ruled out): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter English word fitting _ I _ E S.  
Common words:
- B I D E S – valid  
- D I V E S – V is out  
- F I V E S – V is out  
- G I F T S – T is out  
- H I D E S – valid  
- M I C E S – C is out  
- P I C K S – K in 5, but S is in 5, so invalid  
- W I D E S – valid  

Between BIDES, HIDES, WIDES, let’s pick HIDES because H and D are common and haven’t been tested yet.

Check constraints:
- H and D are allowed.  
- Pattern matches _ I _ E S.  
- No conflicts with previous feedback.

Therefore, the next guess is HIDES.
