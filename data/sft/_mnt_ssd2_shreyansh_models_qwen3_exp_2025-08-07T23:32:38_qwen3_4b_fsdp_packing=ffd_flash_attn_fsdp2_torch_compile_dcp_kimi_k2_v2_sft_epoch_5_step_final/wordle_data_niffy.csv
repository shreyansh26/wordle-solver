### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". These words use frequently occurring letters in English and can provide good coverage for subsequent guesses. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a huge chunk of possibilities.  
For the second guess, I want to pick a word that uses entirely different letters, none of which were in AROSE, to maximize information gain.  
Good candidates are words like “UNTIL”, “MIXED”, “BLUNT”, or “CHIMP”.

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   Eliminates A, R, O, S, E.

2. UNTIL → U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) L(x)  
   Eliminates U, T, L.  
   N is in the word but not in position 2.  
   I is in the word but not in position 4.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L.
- Letters that ARE in the word (positions still unknown): N, I.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both N and I.
- Does NOT contain any of A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L.
- N is not in position 2.
- I is not in position 4.

Remaining common letters (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible candidates:
- BINGO – contains O (eliminated) ❌
- CHING – contains G and H, but G and H are still allowed, and we have N and I.  
  However, I is in position 3 (allowed), N is in position 2 (but N cannot be in position 2). ❌
- FINCH – F, I, N, C, H.  
  I is in position 2 (allowed), N is in position 3 (allowed). No forbidden letters. ✅

From the three guesses we now have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   Eliminates: A, R, O, S, E.

2. UNTIL → U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) L(x)  
   Eliminates: U, T, L.  
   Confirms: N is in the word, but not in position 2.  
   Confirms: I is in the word, but not in position 4.

3. FINCH → F(-) I(✓) N(-) C(x) H(x)  
   Eliminates: C, H.  
   Confirms: I is in position 2 (✓).  
   Confirms: N is in the word, but not in position 3 (since it was marked “-”).  
   Confirms: F is in the word but not in position 1.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, C, H.
- Letters that ARE in the word: I (position 2), N (somewhere else), F (somewhere else).
- Positions ruled out:
  – I cannot be in positions 2, 4 (from UNTIL and FINCH).  
  – N cannot be in positions 2, 3.  
  – F cannot be in position 1.

Remaining common letters (not yet ruled out): B, D, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 2.
- Contains N and F somewhere else.
- Does not contain any of the eliminated letters.
- Respects the positional exclusions.

Possible candidates:
- F is not in position 1, so it can be in 3, 4, or 5.
- N is not in positions 2 or 3, so it can be in 1, 4, or 5.
- I is fixed in position 2.

Let’s list words that fit:
- BINGO – O is eliminated ❌
- DINGY – D, I, N, G, Y.  
  I is in position 2 (✓).  
  N is in position 3 (but N cannot be in position 3) ❌
- FINGY – F is in position 1 (but F cannot be in position 1) ❌
- FINED – F is in position 1 (invalid) ❌
- FINKY – F is in position 1 (invalid) ❌
- FINGO – F is in position 1 (invalid) ❌
- VINGE – E is eliminated ❌
- WINGY – W, I, N, G, Y.  
  I is in position 2 (✓).  
  N is in position 3 (invalid) ❌
- BINGO – already eliminated ❌
- DINGY – N in position 3 (invalid) ❌
- PINGY – P, I, N, G, Y.  
  I in position 2 (✓).  
  N in position 3 (invalid) ❌
- JINGO – O eliminated ❌
- MINGY – M, I, N, G, Y.  
  I in position 2 (✓).  
  N in position 3 (invalid) ❌
- VINGE – E eliminated ❌
- WINGE – E eliminated ❌
- YINGY – Y, I, N, G, Y.  
  I in position 2 (✓).  
  N in position 3 (invalid) ❌
- ZINGY – Z, I, N, G, Y.  
  I in position 2 (✓).  
  N in position 3 (invalid) ❌

Hmm, all these have N in position 3 which is invalid. Let’s look for words where N is in position 1, 4, or 5.

Possible structure:  
Position 1: N or F or other allowed letters.  
Position 2: I (fixed).  
Positions 3,4,5: must include N and F, with F not in position 1 and N not in positions 2,3.

Let’s try:
- NIFLY – N, I, F, L, Y.  
  L is eliminated ❌
- NIFER – E eliminated ❌
- NIFTE – T, E eliminated ❌
- NIFFY – F is in position 3 (allowed), N is in position 1 (allowed), I in position 2 (✓).  
  Letters: N, I, F, F, Y.  
  Eliminated letters check: N, I, F, Y are all allowed.  
  No eliminated letters (A,R,O,S,E,U,T,L,C,H).  
  Positional checks:  
  – I is in position 2 (✓).  
  – N is in position 1 (allowed).  
  – F is in position 3 (allowed).  
  – No other constraints violated.

This seems valid.
