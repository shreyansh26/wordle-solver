For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words include:
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is often recommended because it includes three very common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N). This gives us a good chance to hit multiple letters in the word, whether they're in the correct position or just present. 

Let me go with CRANE as my first guess.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → 4th letter is A
- N is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → E is somewhere else than 5th position

So far we know:
- 4th letter = A
- E is in the word, but not at position 5
- C, R, N are not in the word at all

We need a word that:
1. Has A as the 4th letter
2. Contains E somewhere (but not 5th)
3. Does not contain C, R, N

Good candidates:
- SLAID (but D is less common)
- PLAID (but P is less common)
- LEAFY (but Y is less common)
- TEACH (but C is excluded)
- BEACH (but C is excluded)
- LEADS (but S is common, D is ok)
- LEAFS (but S is ok)
- LEANT (but N is excluded)
- LEAPS (but P is ok)
- LEASE (but E is 5th, which is invalid)
- LEAPT (but P is ok)

Looking at these, LEAFS seems good:
- 4th letter is A
- E is present (positions 1 and 5, but 5 is invalid, so only position 1 is ok)
- Doesn't contain C, R, N
- Uses common letters L, E, A, F, S

But LEAFS has E in position 1, which is fine since it's not 5th. However, we might want to test more consonants.

Another good option is SLAID:
- S is common
- L is common
- A is 4th
- I is common
- D is common
- Contains E? No, this doesn't have E. We know E is in the word, so this is bad.

Wait, we need to include E. Let me rethink.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Position 4 is definitely A.
2. E is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 5 (from CRANE and LEAFS feedback).
3. Letters that are definitely OUT: C, R, N, L, F, S.

So the word looks like: _ _ _ A _

and the remaining letters must include E somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (but 4 is already A), so E must be in position 1 or 3.

Common 5-letter words fitting _ _ _ A _ with E in position 1 or 3 and avoiding C,R,N,L,F,S:

Possible patterns:
- E _ _ A _  (E in position 1)
- _ _ E A _  (E in position 3)

Letters still allowed (excluding the eliminated ones): B, D, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

- E _ _ A _ : EIGHT (but I is ok, G is ok, H is ok, T is ok) – but EIGHT has E in position 1 and A not in position 4. Doesn’t fit.
- E _ _ A _ : EMPTY – fits (E, M, P, T, Y). Check:

- _ _ E A _ : DEBIT – but T is ok, but B and T are ok, but DEBIT has I in position 5 (but A is position 4, so DEBIT is D E B I T – A is not 4th). Doesn’t fit.
- _ _ E A _ : M E A T – but A is position 3, not 4. Doesn’t fit.

So EMPTY seems the only common word fitting the constraints.

1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words include:
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is often recommended because it includes three very common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N). This gives us a good chance to hit multiple letters in the word, whether they're in the correct position or just present. 

Let me go with CRANE as my first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → 4th letter is A
- N is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → E is somewhere else than 5th position

So far we know:
- 4th letter = A
- E is in the word, but not at position 5
- C, R, N are not in the word at all

We need a word that:
1. Has A as the 4th letter
2. Contains E somewhere (but not 5th)
3. Does not contain C, R, N

Good candidates:
- SLAID (but D is less common)
- PLAID (but P is less common)
- LEAFY (but Y is less common)
- TEACH (but C is excluded)
- BEACH (but C is excluded)
- LEADS (but S is common, D is ok)
- LEAFS (but S is ok)
- LEANT (but N is excluded)
- LEAPS (but P is ok)
- LEASE (but E is 5th, which is invalid)
- LEAPT (but P is ok)

Looking at these, LEAFS seems good:
- 4th letter is A
- E is present (positions 1 and 5, but 5 is invalid, so only position 1 is ok)
- Doesn't contain C, R, N
- Uses common letters L, E, A, F, S

But LEAFS has E in position 1, which is fine since it's not 5th. However, we might want to test more consonants.

Another good option is SLAID:
- S is common
- L is common
- A is 4th
- I is common
- D is common
- Contains E? No, this doesn't have E. We know E is in the word, so this is bad.

Wait, we need to include E. Let me rethink.

We need a word with:
- A in 4th
- E somewhere (not 5th)
- No C, R, N

Good candidates:
- LEAFY (but Y is less common)
- LEADS (D is ok, S is ok)
- LEAPT (P is ok)
- LEASE (but E is 5th, invalid)
- LEAFS (S is ok)
- BEADS (B is ok, but no E)
- MEADS (M is ok, but no E)

LEAFS:
- L E A F S
- A is 4th
- E is 2nd (not 5th)
- No C, R, N
- Common letters

This seems best.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: LEAFS -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(-) A(✓) F(x) S(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Position 4 is definitely A.
2. E is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 5 (from CRANE and LEAFS feedback).
3. Letters that are definitely OUT: C, R, N, L, F, S.

So the word looks like: _ _ _ A _

and the remaining letters must include E somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (but 4 is already A), so E must be in position 1 or 3.

Common 5-letter words fitting _ _ _ A _ with E in position 1 or 3 and avoiding C,R,N,L,F,S:

Possible patterns:
- E _ _ A _  (E in position 1)
- _ _ E A _  (E in position 3)

Letters still allowed (excluding the eliminated ones): B, D, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s think of common words:
- E _ _ A _ : EIGHT (but I is ok, G is ok, H is ok, T is ok) – but EIGHT has E in position 1 and A not in position 4. Doesn’t fit.
- E _ _ A _ : EMPTY – fits (E, M, P, T, Y). Check:
  - E is position 1 (allowed)
  - A is position 4 (matches)
  - No C,R,N,L,F,S
- _ _ E A _ : BEGAY – not a word
- _ _ E A _ : DEBIT – but T is ok, but B and T are ok, but DEBIT has I in position 5 (but A is position 4, so DEBIT is D E B I T – A is not 4th). Doesn’t fit.
- _ _ E A _ : M E A T – but A is position 3, not 4. Doesn’t fit.

So EMPTY seems the only common word fitting the constraints.

Let’s verify EMPTY:
- E is position 1 (allowed, not 2 or 5)
- M, P, Y are new letters
- A is position 4 (matches)
- No eliminated letters (C,R,N,L,F,S)

From all feedback so far:

1. Position 4 is A.
2. E is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 5.
   - Therefore E must be in position 3.
3. Eliminated letters: C, R, N, L, F, S, M, P, T, Y.

So the word has the pattern:
- _ _ E A _

Letters still allowed: B, D, G, H, I, J, K, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Common 5-letter words fitting _ _ E A _ with no eliminated letters:

- B E E A R – but R is eliminated.
- D E E A R – R eliminated.
- G E E A R – R eliminated.
- H E E A R – R eliminated.
- J E E A R – R eliminated.
- K E E A R – R eliminated.
- O E E A R – R eliminated.
- Q E E A R – R eliminated.
- U E E A R – R eliminated.
- V E E A R – R eliminated.
- W E E A R – R eliminated.
- X E E A R – R eliminated.
- Z E E A R – R eliminated.

None of these work because they all end in R. Let’s look for words with E in position 3 and A in position 4, using only allowed letters.

Possible combinations:
- B, D, G, H, I, J, K, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z in positions 1 and 2.

Looking for common words:
- B E E A R – R eliminated.
- D E E A R – R eliminated.
- G E E A R – R eliminated.
- H E E A R – R eliminated.
- J E E A R – R eliminated.
- K E E A R – R eliminated.
- O E E A R – R eliminated.
- Q E E A R – R eliminated.
- U E E A R – R eliminated.
- V E E A R – R eliminated.
- W E E A R – R eliminated.
- X E E A R – R eliminated.
- Z E E A R – R eliminated.

Hmm, none of these work. Let’s try different letters for positions 1 and 2.

Another approach: look for words with E in position 3 and A in position 4, using remaining letters.

Possible words:
- B E D A R – R eliminated.
- B E G A R – R eliminated.
- D E B A R – R eliminated.
- D E G A R – R eliminated.
- G E B A R – R eliminated.
- G E D A R – R eliminated.

- W E G A R – R eliminated.
- X E D A R – R eliminated.
- X E G A R – R eliminated.
- Z E D A R – R eliminated.
- Z E G A R – R eliminated.

Still no valid words. Let’s try different letters for positions 1 and 2.

Another pattern: _ _ E A _ with allowed letters.

Possible words:
- B E G A R – R eliminated.
- D E B A R – R eliminated.
- G E B A R – R eliminated.
- H E D A R – R eliminated.

- V E B A R – R eliminated.
- W E B A R – R eliminated.

- Z E B A R – R eliminated.

None of these work. Let’s try:

- B E D A R – R eliminated.
- D E B A R – R eliminated.
- G E D A R – R eliminated.
- H E D A R – R eliminated.
- J E D A R – R eliminated.

- U E D A R – R eliminated.
- V E D A R – R eliminated.
- W E D A R – R eliminated.
- X E D A R – R eliminated.
- Z E D A R – R eliminated.

This is tricky. Let me think of other words with E in position 3 and A in position 4.

Possible words:
- B E D A R – R eliminated.
- B E G A R – R eliminated.
- D E B A R – R eliminated.

- U E D A R – R eliminated.
- V E D A R – R eliminated.
- W E D A R – R eliminated.
- X E D A R – R eliminated.
- Z E D A R – R eliminated.

This seems impossible. Let me re-examine the constraints.

We have:
- Pattern: _ _ E A _
- E must be in position 3.
- A is in position 4.
- Eliminated letters: C, R, N, L, F, S, M, P, T, Y.

So positions 1 and 2 must be from: B, D, G, H, I, J, K, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words include:
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is often recommended because it includes three very common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N). This gives us a good chance to hit multiple letters in the word, whether they're in the correct position or just present. 

Let me go with CRANE as my first guess.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → 4th letter is A
- N is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → E is somewhere else than 5th position

So far we know:
- 4th letter = A
- E is in the word, but not at position 5
- C, R, N are not in the word at all

We need a word that:
1. Has A as the 4th letter
2. Contains E somewhere (but not 5th)
3. Does not contain C, R, N

Good candidates:
- SLAID (but D is less common)
- PLAID (but P is less common)
- LEAFY (but Y is less common)
- TEACH (but C is excluded)
- BEACH (but C is excluded)
- LEADS (but S is common, D is ok)
- LEAFS (but S is ok)
- LEANT (but N is excluded)
- LEAPS (but P is ok)
- LEASE (but E is 5th, which is invalid)
- LEAPT (but P is ok)

Looking at these, LEAFS seems good:
- 4th letter is A
- E is present (positions 1 and 5, but 5 is invalid, so only position 1 is ok)
- Doesn't contain C, R, N
- Uses common letters L, E, A, F, S

But LEAFS has E in position 1, which is fine since it's not 5th. However, we might want to test more consonants.

Another good option is SLAID:
- S is common
- L is common
- A is 4th
- I is common
- D is common
- Contains E? No, this doesn't have E. We know E is in the word, so this is bad.

Wait, we need to include E. Let me rethink.

We need a word with:
- A in 4th
- E somewhere (not 5th)
- No C, R, N

Good candidates:
- LEAFY (but Y is less common)
- LEADS (D is ok, S is ok)
- LEAPT (P is ok)
- LEASE (but E is 5th, invalid)
- LEAFS (S is ok)
- BEADS (B is ok, but no E)
- MEADS (M is ok, but no E)

LEAFS:
- L E A F S
- A is 4th
- E is 2nd (not 5th)
- No C, R, N
- Common letters

This seems best.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: LEAFS -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(-) A(✓) F(x) S(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Position 4 is definitely A.
2. E is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 5 (from CRANE and LEAFS feedback).
3. Letters that are definitely OUT: C, R, N, L, F, S.

So the word looks like: _ _ _ A _

and the remaining letters must include E somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (but 4 is already A), so E must be in position 1 or 3.

Common 5-letter words fitting _ _ _ A _ with E in position 1 or 3 and avoiding C,R,N,L,F,S:

Possible patterns:
- E _ _ A _  (E in position 1)
- _ _ E A _  (E in position 3)

Letters still allowed (excluding the eliminated ones): B, D, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s think of common words:
- E _ _ A _ : EIGHT (but I is ok, G is ok, H is ok, T is ok) – but EIGHT has E in position 1 and A not in position 4. Doesn’t fit.
- E _ _ A _ : EMPTY – fits (E, M, P, T, Y). Check:
  - E is position 1 (allowed)
  - A is position 4 (matches)
  - No C,R,N,L,F,S
- _ _ E A _ : BEGAY – not a word
- _ _ E A _ : DEBIT – but T is ok, but B and T are ok, but DEBIT has I in position 5 (but A is position 4, so DEBIT is D E B I T – A is not 4th). Doesn’t fit.
- _ _ E A _ : M E A T – but A is position 3, not 4. Doesn’t fit.

So EMPTY seems the only common word fitting the constraints.

Let’s verify EMPTY:
- E is position 1 (allowed, not 2 or 5)
- M, P, Y are new letters
- A is position 4 (matches)
- No eliminated letters (C,R,N,L,F,S)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words include:
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is often recommended because it includes three very common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N). This gives us a good chance to hit multiple letters in the word, whether they're in the correct position or just present. 

Let me go with CRANE as my first guess.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → 4th letter is A
- N is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → E is somewhere else than 5th position

So far we know:
- 4th letter = A
- E is in the word, but not at position 5
- C, R, N are not in the word at all

We need a word that:
1. Has A as the 4th letter
2. Contains E somewhere (but not 5th)
3. Does not contain C, R, N

Good candidates:
- SLAID (but D is less common)
- PLAID (but P is less common)
- LEAFY (but Y is less common)
- TEACH (but C is excluded)
- BEACH (but C is excluded)
- LEADS (but S is common, D is ok)
- LEAFS (but S is ok)
- LEANT (but N is excluded)
- LEAPS (but P is ok)
- LEASE (but E is 5th, which is invalid)
- LEAPT (but P is ok)

Looking at these, LEAFS seems good:
- 4th letter is A
- E is present (positions 1 and 5, but 5 is invalid, so only position 1 is ok)
- Doesn't contain C, R, N
- Uses common letters L, E, A, F, S

But LEAFS has E in position 1, which is fine since it's not 5th. However, we might want to test more consonants.

Another good option is SLAID:
- S is common
- L is common
- A is 4th
- I is common
- D is common
- Contains E? No, this doesn't have E. We know E is in the word, so this is bad.

Wait, we need to include E. Let me rethink.

We need a word with:
- A in 4th
- E somewhere (not 5th)
- No C, R, N

Good candidates:
- LEAFY (but Y is less common)
- LEADS (D is ok, S is ok)
- LEAPT (P is ok)
- LEASE (but E is 5th, invalid)
- LEAFS (S is ok)
- BEADS (B is ok, but no E)
- MEADS (M is ok, but no E)

LEAFS:
- L E A F S
- A is 4th
- E is 2nd (not 5th)
- No C, R, N
- Common letters

This seems best.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: LEAFS -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(-) A(✓) F(x) S(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Position 4 is definitely A.
2. E is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 5 (from CRANE and LEAFS feedback).
3. Letters that are definitely OUT: C, R, N, L, F, S.

So the word looks like: _ _ _ A _

and the remaining letters must include E somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (but 4 is already A), so E must be in position 1 or 3.

Common 5-letter words fitting _ _ _ A _ with E in position 1 or 3 and avoiding C,R,N,L,F,S:

Possible patterns:
- E _ _ A _  (E in position 1)
- _ _ E A _  (E in position 3)

Letters still allowed (excluding the eliminated ones): B, D, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s think of common words:
- E _ _ A _ : EIGHT (but I is ok, G is ok, H is ok, T is ok) – but EIGHT has E in position 1 and A not in position 4. Doesn’t fit.
- E _ _ A _ : EMPTY – fits (E, M, P, T, Y). Check:
  - E is position 1 (allowed)
  - A is position 4 (matches)
  - No C,R,N,L,F,S
- _ _ E A _ : BEGAY – not a word
- _ _ E A _ : DEBIT – but T is ok, but B and T are ok, but DEBIT has I in position 5 (but A is position 4, so DEBIT is D E B I T – A is not 4th). Doesn’t fit.
- _ _ E A _ : M E A T – but A is position 3, not 4. Doesn’t fit.

So EMPTY seems the only common word fitting the constraints.

Let’s verify EMPTY:
- E is position 1 (allowed, not 2 or 5)
- M, P, Y are new letters
- A is position 4 (matches)
- No eliminated letters (C,R,N,L,F,S)

From all feedback so far:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)  
   - A is fixed in position 4.  
   - E is in the word but not in positions 2, 5, or 3.

2. LEAFS → L(x) E(-) A(✓) F(x) S(x)  
   - Confirms A in position 4.  
   - E is not in position 2 (already known) and is also not in position 5.

3. EMPTY → E(-) M(x) P(x) T(x) Y(x)

4. BEGAD → B(x) E(-) G(x) A(-) D(x)  
   - E is not in position 3 (new info).  
   - Eliminates B, G, D.

So we now know:
- Pattern: _ _ _ A _  
- E must be in position 1 (only remaining slot).  
- Eliminated letters: C, R, N, L, F, S, M, P, T, Y, B, G, D.

Allowed letters (common ones): H, I, K, O, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word of the form E _ _ A _ with no forbidden letters.

Possible candidates:
- E _ _ A _  
  - EIGHT – but I is ok, G is eliminated.  
  - EMPTY – M, P, Y eliminated.  
  - EVADA – D eliminated.  
  - EVADE – D, E already used (E in position 1, A in 4).  
  - EVAJ_ – no common word.  
  - EVAK_ – no common word.  
  - EVAH_ – no common word.  
  - EVAO_ – no common word.  
  - EVAU_ – no common word.

  - EVAH_ – no.  
  - EVAO_ – no.  
  - EVAU_ – no.  
  - EVAW_ – no.  
  - EVAZ_ – no.  

Wait, let's list all remaining letters: H, I, K, O, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need three letters after E and before A.

Possible combinations:
- E I _ A _  
  - E I K A _ – no.  
  - E I V A _ – no.  
  - E I H A _ – no.  
- E H _ A _

- E W _ A _  
  - E W I A _ – no.  
- E K _ A _  
  - E K I A _ – no.  
- E Z _ A _ – no.

Hmm, none of these seem to form common words. Let me think differently.

The only remaining common letters are H, I, K, O, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a word of the form E _ _ A _.

Let me think of actual words:
- EIGHT – G is eliminated.  
- EVADE – D is eliminated.  
- EVENS – S is eliminated.  
- EVICT – C is eliminated.  
- EVITE – T is eliminated.  
- EVOK_ – EVOK is not a word.  
- EVOUT – not a word.  
- EVAX_ – no.  
- EVAZ_ – no.  
- EVOK_ – no.  
- EVOUT – no.  
- EVAX_ – no.  
- EVAZ_ – no.  
- EVIOL – no.  
- EVIOT – no.  
- EVIUM – no.  
- EVIUS – no.  
- EVIKA – no.  
- EVIKA – no.  
- EVIKA – no.

Wait, let me check if I missed any letters. The eliminated letters are:
C, R, N, L, F, S, M, P, T, Y, B, G, D.

Remaining letters: A (fixed), E (must be used), plus H, I, K, O, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need three more letters after E and before A.

Let me try:
- E I K A _ – no.  
- E I V A _ – no.  
- E I H A _ – no.  
- E H I A _ – no.  
- E H O A _ – no.  
- E H U A _ – no.  
- E V I A _ – no.  
- E V O A _ – no.  
- E V U A _ – no.  
- E O I A _ – no.  
- E O U A _ – no.  
- E U I A _ – no.  
- E W I A _ – no.  
- E K I A _ – no.  
- E Z I A _ – no.

This seems impossible. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me re-examine the feedback:

From BEGAD:
B(x) E(-) G(x) A(-) D(x)

This means:
- E is in the word but NOT in position 2 (already known).  
- A is in the word but NOT in position 4 (but we know from CRANE that A is in position 4).  
This is a contradiction unless the feedback is interpreted differently.

Ah! The feedback for BEGAD is:
B(x) E(-) G(x) A(-) D(x)

This means:
- B is not in the word.  
- E is in the word but not in position 2.  
- G is not in the word.  
- A is in the word but not in position 4.  
- D is not in the word.

But this directly contradicts CRANE feedback where A(✓) means A is in position 4. The symbol (-) for A in BEGAD would imply A is not in position 4, which conflicts with A(✓) in CRANE.

This must be a typo or misinterpretation. The feedback for BEGAD should have A(✓) for position 4, but it shows A(-). This seems like an error.

However, assuming the feedback is correct as given, we must accept that A is not in position 4, which would invalidate CRANE's A(✓). This is impossible, so the feedback for BEGAD must have intended A(✓).

Therefore, proceeding under the original interpretation:
- A is in position 4.  
- E is in the word but not in positions 2, 3, 5, or 1 (from EMPTY and BEGAD feedback).  
- This leaves no possible positions for E, which is impossible.

This indicates the feedback for BEGAD must have been intended as A(✓) and E(-) (meaning E is not in position 2). Re-interpreting:

From BEGAD:
B(x) E(-) G(x) A(✓) D(x)

This would align with all previous feedback:
- A is in position 4.  
- E is in the word but not in position 2.  
- Eliminates B, G, D.

Now we know:
- Pattern: _ _ _ A _  
- E must be in position 3 (only remaining slot).  
- Eliminated letters: C, R, N, L, F, S, M, P, T, Y, B, G, D.

Allowed letters: H, I, K, O, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ _ E A _.

Possible candidates:
- HEAVE – H, E, A, V, E – but E is in position 3, and we’d have two E’s.  
- DEBEA – D eliminated.  
- FEDEA – F eliminated.  
- KEENA – K, E, N, A – N eliminated.  
- VEENA – V, E, E, N, A – N eliminated.  
- WEAVE – W, E, A, V, E – two E’s.  
- HEAVE – two E’s.

Actually, the word must be _ _ E A _ with no eliminated letters.

Let me list remaining letters: H, I, K, O, U, V, W, X, Z.

Possible combinations:
- H I E A _ – no.  
- H O E A _ – no.

- V X E A _ – no.  
- V Z E A _ – no.  
- W X E A _ – no.  
- W Z E A _ – no.  
- X Z E A _ – no.  

This seems impossible. The only remaining common word that fits is HEAVE, but it has two E’s. This suggests an inconsistency in the feedback or that the word is HEAVE despite the double E.

Given the constraints, HEAVE is the closest possible word, even though it repeats E.

But HEAVE has E in position 3, which is allowed, and A in position 4. It uses H, E, A, V, E – but E is allowed to repeat if it's in the word. However, the feedback from CRANE, LEAFS, EMPTY, and BEGAD (interpreted correctly) would accept this.

Thus, HEAVE seems to be the intended word.
