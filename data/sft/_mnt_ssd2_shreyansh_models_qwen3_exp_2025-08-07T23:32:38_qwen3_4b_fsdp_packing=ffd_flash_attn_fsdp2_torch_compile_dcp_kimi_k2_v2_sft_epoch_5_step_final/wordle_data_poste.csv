### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All distinct letters to test as many unique letters as possible

This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and will likely reveal several letters in the word or eliminate many possibilities.

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(✓)
2. STOLE → S(-) T(-) O(-) L(x) E(✓)

Consolidating what we now know:

- The word ends in E (position 5).
- It contains the letters O and S, but:
  – O is NOT in positions 3 or 2.
  – S is NOT in positions 4 or 1.
- It does NOT contain A, R, L, T.

So S must be in position 2 or 3, but:
- It cannot be in position 1 (from STOLE feedback).
- It cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE feedback).
- It cannot be in position 3 (from STOLE feedback: O was in position 2 and marked “-”, so O is not in 2, but that doesn’t restrict S). Actually, the feedback for STOLE was S(-) T(-) O(-) L(x) E(✓). The “-” means the letter is in the word but in the wrong position. So S is in the word but not in position 1. Similarly, O is in the word but not in position 2.

Therefore:
- S can be in positions 2, 3, or 5. But 5 is E, so 2 or 3.
- O can be in positions 1, 4, or 5. 5 is E, so 1 or 4.

We need a word that:
- Ends in E.
- Contains S in 2 or 3.
- Contains O in 1 or 4.
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated: not A, R, L, T.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try to form a word:
- If O is in position 1, then S must be in 2 or 3.
  - O S _ _ E: O S _ _ E → O S _ _ E → possible: OSMEE? No, not a word.
  - O _ S _ E: O _ S _ E → O C S I E? Not a word.
  - O _ _ S E: O _ _ S E → O P S I E? Not a word.
- If O is in position 4, then S must be in 2 or 3.
  - _ S _ O E: _ S _ O E → C S I O E? Not a word.
  - _ _ S O E: _ _ S O E → C I S O E? Not a word.
  - _ S _ O E → P S I O E? Not a word.
  - _ _ S O E → C H S O E? Not a word.
  - _ _ _ S E → but S must be in 2 or 3.

Wait, let me think differently. We know:
- S is in 2 or 3.
- O is in 1 or 4.
- E is in 5.

Let me list possible patterns:
1. O S _ _ E
   - O S _ _ E → O S _ _ E → O S _ _ E → possible: O S _ _ E → O S _ _ E → need two more letters not A,R,L,T.
   - O S C I E? Not a word.
   - O S M I E? Not a word.
   - O S P I E? Not a word.
   - O S H I E? Not a word.

2. O _ S _ E
   - O _ S _ E → O C S I E? Not a word.
   - O _ S _ E → O P S I E? Not a word.
   - O _ S _ E → O H S I E? Not a word.

3. _ S O _ E
   - _ S O _ E → C S O I E? Not a word.
   - _ S O _ E → P S O I E? Not a word.

4. _ _ O S E
   - _ _ O S E → C H O S E → ""CHOSE""! This is a valid word.
   - Check constraints:
     - Ends in E (✓).
     - Contains O and S (✓).
     - O is in position 3 (originally was in 2, now 3 – allowed).
     - S is in position 4 (originally was in 1 and 4 – now 4, but original feedback said S cannot be in 4 (from AROSE feedback: S(-) means S is in word but not in position 4). So this is a conflict.

Wait, AROSE feedback said S(-) which means S is in word but not in position 4. So S cannot be in 4. So _ _ O S E is invalid.

5. _ S _ O E
   - _ S _ O E → C S I O E? Not a word.
   - _ S _ O E → P S I O E? Not a word.

6. _ _ _ S E
   - But S must be in 2 or 3.

Let me think of actual words:
- Words ending in E with O and S:
  - ""POSE"" – but only 4 letters.
  - ""HOUSE"" – has H, O, U, S, E. Check constraints:
    - Ends in E (✓).
    - Contains O and S (✓).
    - O is in position 2 (original O was in 3, now 2 – allowed).
    - S is in position 3 (original S was in 4, now 3 – allowed).
    - Letters used: H, O, U, S, E – none of A, R, L, T.
    - ""HOUSE"" is a valid 5-letter word.

This fits all constraints:
- Ends in E.
- Contains O and S.
- O is in position 2 (originally was in 3, now 2 – allowed).
- S is in position 3 (originally was in 4, now 3 – allowed).

1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All distinct letters to test as many unique letters as possible

This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and will likely reveal several letters in the word or eliminate many possibilities.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in position 5.

So we know:
- The word ends in E.
- It contains O and S somewhere, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- It does NOT contain A or R.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E.
- Contains both O and S.
- Does NOT contain A or R.
- Keeps O and S in positions different from 3 and 4.

A good candidate is “STOLE”:
- Ends with E (✓).
- Contains S and O (✓).
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since original S was in position 4).
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since original O was in position 3).
- T and L are new letters that will give more information.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(✓)
Guess 2: STOLE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) O(-) L(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(✓)
2. STOLE → S(-) T(-) O(-) L(x) E(✓)

Consolidating what we now know:

- The word ends in E (position 5).
- It contains the letters O and S, but:
  – O is NOT in positions 3 or 2.
  – S is NOT in positions 4 or 1.
- It does NOT contain A, R, L, T.

So S must be in position 2 or 3, but:
- It cannot be in position 1 (from STOLE feedback).
- It cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE feedback).
- It cannot be in position 3 (from STOLE feedback: O was in position 2 and marked “-”, so O is not in 2, but that doesn’t restrict S). Actually, the feedback for STOLE was S(-) T(-) O(-) L(x) E(✓). The “-” means the letter is in the word but in the wrong position. So S is in the word but not in position 1. Similarly, O is in the word but not in position 2.

Therefore:
- S can be in positions 2, 3, or 5. But 5 is E, so 2 or 3.
- O can be in positions 1, 4, or 5. 5 is E, so 1 or 4.

We need a word that:
- Ends in E.
- Contains S in 2 or 3.
- Contains O in 1 or 4.
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated: not A, R, L, T.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try to form a word:
- If O is in position 1, then S must be in 2 or 3.
  - O S _ _ E: O S _ _ E → O S _ _ E → possible: OSMEE? No, not a word.
  - O _ S _ E: O _ S _ E → O C S I E? Not a word.
  - O _ _ S E: O _ _ S E → O P S I E? Not a word.
- If O is in position 4, then S must be in 2 or 3.
  - _ S _ O E: _ S _ O E → C S I O E? Not a word.
  - _ _ S O E: _ _ S O E → C I S O E? Not a word.
  - _ S _ O E → P S I O E? Not a word.
  - _ _ S O E → C H S O E? Not a word.
  - _ _ _ S E → but S must be in 2 or 3.

Wait, let me think differently. We know:
- S is in 2 or 3.
- O is in 1 or 4.
- E is in 5.

Let me list possible patterns:
1. O S _ _ E
   - O S _ _ E → O S _ _ E → O S _ _ E → possible: O S _ _ E → O S _ _ E → need two more letters not A,R,L,T.
   - O S C I E? Not a word.
   - O S M I E? Not a word.
   - O S P I E? Not a word.
   - O S H I E? Not a word.

2. O _ S _ E
   - O _ S _ E → O C S I E? Not a word.
   - O _ S _ E → O P S I E? Not a word.
   - O _ S _ E → O H S I E? Not a word.

3. _ S O _ E
   - _ S O _ E → C S O I E? Not a word.
   - _ S O _ E → P S O I E? Not a word.

4. _ _ O S E
   - _ _ O S E → C H O S E → ""CHOSE""! This is a valid word.
   - Check constraints:
     - Ends in E (✓).
     - Contains O and S (✓).
     - O is in position 3 (originally was in 2, now 3 – allowed).
     - S is in position 4 (originally was in 1 and 4 – now 4, but original feedback said S cannot be in 4 (from AROSE feedback: S(-) means S is in word but not in position 4). So this is a conflict.

Wait, AROSE feedback said S(-) which means S is in word but not in position 4. So S cannot be in 4. So _ _ O S E is invalid.

5. _ S _ O E
   - _ S _ O E → C S I O E? Not a word.
   - _ S _ O E → P S I O E? Not a word.

6. _ _ _ S E
   - But S must be in 2 or 3.

Let me think of actual words:
- Words ending in E with O and S:
  - ""POSE"" – but only 4 letters.
  - ""HOUSE"" – has H, O, U, S, E. Check constraints:
    - Ends in E (✓).
    - Contains O and S (✓).
    - O is in position 2 (original O was in 3, now 2 – allowed).
    - S is in position 3 (original S was in 4, now 3 – allowed).
    - Letters used: H, O, U, S, E – none of A, R, L, T.
    - ""HOUSE"" is a valid 5-letter word.

This fits all constraints:
- Ends in E.
- Contains O and S.
- O is in position 2 (originally was in 3, now 2 – allowed).
- S is in position 3 (originally was in 4, now 3 – allowed).
- No A, R, L, T.

Therefore, the next guess is ""HOUSE"".

- FOYSE – not a word.
- GOOSE – valid word, G, O, O, S, E – but has two O's; we only know one O is required.
- MOOSE – has two O's and an extra S; likely invalid.
- NOOSE – same issue with double O.
- POISE – P, O, I, S, E – I is allowed, P is allowed.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All distinct letters to test as many unique letters as possible

This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and will likely reveal several letters in the word or eliminate many possibilities.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in position 5.

So we know:
- The word ends in E.
- It contains O and S somewhere, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- It does NOT contain A or R.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E.
- Contains both O and S.
- Does NOT contain A or R.
- Keeps O and S in positions different from 3 and 4.

A good candidate is “STOLE”:
- Ends with E (✓).
- Contains S and O (✓).
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since original S was in position 4).
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since original O was in position 3).
- T and L are new letters that will give more information.

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(✓)
2. STOLE → S(-) T(-) O(-) L(x) E(✓)

Consolidating what we now know:

- The word ends in E (position 5).
- It contains the letters O and S, but:
  – O is NOT in positions 3 or 2.
  – S is NOT in positions 4 or 1.
- It does NOT contain A, R, L, T.

So S must be in position 2 or 3, but:
- It cannot be in position 1 (from STOLE feedback).
- It cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE feedback).
- It cannot be in position 3 (from STOLE feedback: O was in position 2 and marked “-”, so O is not in 2, but that doesn’t restrict S). Actually, the feedback for STOLE was S(-) T(-) O(-) L(x) E(✓). The “-” means the letter is in the word but in the wrong position. So S is in the word but not in position 1. Similarly, O is in the word but not in position 2.

Therefore:
- S can be in positions 2, 3, or 5. But 5 is E, so 2 or 3.
- O can be in positions 1, 4, or 5. 5 is E, so 1 or 4.

We need a word that:
- Ends in E.
- Contains S in 2 or 3.
- Contains O in 1 or 4.
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated: not A, R, L, T.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

  - _ _ S O E: _ _ S O E → C I S O E? Not a word.
  - _ S _ O E → P S I O E? Not a word.
  - _ _ S O E → C H S O E? Not a word.
  - _ _ _ S E → but S must be in 2 or 3.

Wait, let me think differently. We know:
- S is in 2 or 3.
- O is in 1 or 4.
- E is in 5.

Let me list possible patterns:
1. O S _ _ E
   - O S _ _ E → O S _ _ E → O S _ _ E → possible: O S _ _ E → O S _ _ E → need two more letters not A,R,L,T.
   - O S C I E? Not a word.
   - O S M I E? Not a word.
   - O S P I E? Not a word.
   - O S H I E? Not a word.

2. O _ S _ E
   - O _ S _ E → O C S I E? Not a word.
   - O _ S _ E → O P S I E? Not a word.
   - O _ S _ E → O H S I E? Not a word.

3. _ S O _ E
   - _ S O _ E → C S O I E? Not a word.
   - _ S O _ E → P S O I E? Not a word.

4. _ _ O S E
   - _ _ O S E → C H O S E → ""CHOSE""! This is a valid word.
   - Check constraints:
     - Ends in E (✓).
     - Contains O and S (✓).
     - O is in position 3 (originally was in 2, now 3 – allowed).
     - S is in position 4 (originally was in 1 and 4 – now 4, but original feedback said S cannot be in 4 (from AROSE feedback: S(-) means S is in word but not in position 4). So this is a conflict.

Wait, AROSE feedback said S(-) which means S is in word but not in position 4. So S cannot be in 4. So _ _ O S E is invalid.

5. _ S _ O E
   - _ S _ O E → C S I O E? Not a word.
   - _ S _ O E → P S I O E? Not a word.

6. _ _ _ S E
   - But S must be in 2 or 3.

Let me think of actual words:
- Words ending in E with O and S:
  - ""POSE"" – but only 4 letters.
  - ""HOUSE"" – has H, O, U, S, E. Check constraints:
    - Ends in E (✓).
    - Contains O and S (✓).
    - O is in position 2 (original O was in 3, now 2 – allowed).
    - S is in position 3 (original S was in 4, now 3 – allowed).
    - Letters used: H, O, U, S, E – none of A, R, L, T.
    - ""HOUSE"" is a valid 5-letter word.

This fits all constraints:
- Ends in E.
- Contains O and S.
- O is in position 2 (originally was in 3, now 2 – allowed).
- S is in position 3 (originally was in 4, now 3 – allowed).
- No A, R, L, T.

Therefore, the next guess is ""HOUSE"".

Let's consolidate everything we know after three guesses.

Known facts:
1. The word ends in E (position 5).
2. It contains O and S.
3. From AROSE:  
   - A, R are out.  
   - O is not in position 3.  
   - S is not in position 4.  
4. From STOLE:  
   - T, L are out.  
   - S is not in position 1.  
   - O is not in position 2.  
5. From HOUSE:  
   - H, U are out.  
   - O is in position 2 (✓).  
   - S is not in position 3.  

Putting these together:
- Position 5: E (fixed).
- Position 2: O (fixed).
- S must be in position 4 (only remaining spot for S: positions 1 and 3 are excluded by previous feedback, position 2 is O, position 5 is E).
- Therefore the word pattern is: _ O _ S E.

Letters already ruled out: A, R, L, T, H, U.

We need two more letters (positions 1 and 3) from the remaining alphabet, forming a valid English word.

Possible candidates:
- B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common words matching _ O _ S E:
- BOISE – but I is allowed, but is it common?
- COUSE – not a standard word.
- DOUSE – valid word, letters D, O, U, S, E – but U is already ruled out.
- FOYSE – not a word.
- GOOSE – valid word, G, O, O, S, E – but has two O's; we only know one O is required.
- MOOSE – has two O's and an extra S; likely invalid.
- NOOSE – same issue with double O.
- POISE – P, O, I, S, E – I is allowed, P is allowed.
- VOYSE – not a word.

The most plausible valid word fitting the pattern _ O _ S E with no ruled-out letters is ""POISE"".

Check constraints:
- Ends in E (✓).
- O in position 2 (✓).
- S in position 4 (✓).
- Letters P, O, I, S, E – none of A, R, L, T, H, U appear.

Let's summarize everything we now know:

1. The word ends in E (position 5).
2. It contains:
   - O in position 2 (from HOUSE feedback).
   - S in position 4 (from POISE feedback, since S is marked ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not in position 3, and positions 1,2,5 are already taken by P,O,E respectively, so S must be in position 4).
3. Letters ruled out so far:
   A, R, L, T, H, U, I
4. Letters confirmed:
   P (✓ in position 1), O (✓ in position 2), S (must be in position 4), E (✓ in position 5)
5. The pattern is now: P O _ S E

We need a single letter for position 3 that hasn't been ruled out yet. The remaining letters (from the alphabet excluding the ruled-out ones) are:
B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for common 5-letter words matching P O _ S E:
- POBSE – not a word
- POCSE – not a word
- PODSE – not a word
- POFSE – not a word
- POGSE – not a word
- POKSE – not a word
- POMSE – not a word
- PONSE – not a word
- POOSE – not a word
- POYSE – not a word

Wait, let's double-check the pattern. From POISE feedback:
- P(✓) – correct in position 1
- O(✓) – correct in position 2
- I(x) – I is not in the word
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 3 (which aligns with our earlier deduction that S must be in position 4)
- E(✓) – correct in position 5

Thus the pattern is definitely P O _ S E.

The only common English word that fits this pattern is ""POSE"" but it's only 4 letters. However, we know the word is 5 letters. Looking again, the correct word must be ""POISE"" but that was already guessed. 

Wait, let me re-examine the pattern: P O _ S E. The only valid 5-letter word fitting this is ""POISE"" which was already guessed. This suggests an inconsistency, indicating we might have missed a possibility.

But ""POISE"" was guessed as POISE and the feedback was P(✓) O(✓) I(x) S(-) E(✓). This implies the word is P O _ S E with the third letter not being I. The only remaining possibility is ""POUSE"" but U is ruled out.

This seems like a contradiction, which suggests we might have made an error. Let me re-examine the feedback:

From POISE:
- P(✓) – P is correct in position 1
- O(✓) – O is correct in position 2
- I(x) – I is not in the word
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 3
- E(✓) – E is correct in position 5

Thus the word is P O _ _ E with S somewhere in positions 3 or 4. But position 4 is already E, so S must be in position 3. However, the feedback for S in POISE was ""-"", meaning S is in the word but not in position 3. This is a contradiction unless we misread.

Wait, no: in POISE, S is in position 4, and the feedback was ""-"", which means S is in the word but not in position 4. This changes things.

Re-evaluating:

From POISE:
- P(✓) – P is correct in position 1
- O(✓) – O is correct in position 2
- I(x) – I is not in the word
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4
- E(✓) – E is correct in position 5

Thus the word is P O _ _ E with S in position 3.

So the pattern is P O S _ E.

Now looking for 5-letter words matching P O S _ E:
- POSSE – valid word, letters P, O, S, S, E. The second S is allowed since we only know S is in the word (not its count).
- POSIE – but I is ruled out.
- POSKE – not a word.
- POSLE – L is ruled out.
- POSME – not a word.

The only valid word fitting P O S _ E is ""POSSE"".

Check constraints:
- P(✓) position 1
- O(✓) position 2
- S in position 3 (allowed, since earlier feedback only said S not in positions 1,3,4 – but from STOLE S was not in 1, from AROSE S not in 4, and from POISE S not in 4. Wait, let me re-check:

From AROSE: S(-) – S is in word but not in position 4
From STOLE: S(-) – S is in word but not in position 1
From POISE: S(-) – S is in word but not in position 4 (same as AROSE)
Thus S must be in position 2 or 3. But position 2 is O, so S must be in position 3.

Thus the word must be P O S _ E. The only valid word is ""POSSE"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All distinct letters to test as many unique letters as possible

This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and will likely reveal several letters in the word or eliminate many possibilities.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in position 5.

So we know:
- The word ends in E.
- It contains O and S somewhere, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- It does NOT contain A or R.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E.
- Contains both O and S.
- Does NOT contain A or R.
- Keeps O and S in positions different from 3 and 4.

A good candidate is “STOLE”:
- Ends with E (✓).
- Contains S and O (✓).
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since original S was in position 4).
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since original O was in position 3).
- T and L are new letters that will give more information.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(✓)
Guess 2: STOLE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) O(-) L(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(✓)
2. STOLE → S(-) T(-) O(-) L(x) E(✓)

Consolidating what we now know:

- The word ends in E (position 5).
- It contains the letters O and S, but:
  – O is NOT in positions 3 or 2.
  – S is NOT in positions 4 or 1.
- It does NOT contain A, R, L, T.

So S must be in position 2 or 3, but:
- It cannot be in position 1 (from STOLE feedback).
- It cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE feedback).
- It cannot be in position 3 (from STOLE feedback: O was in position 2 and marked “-”, so O is not in 2, but that doesn’t restrict S). Actually, the feedback for STOLE was S(-) T(-) O(-) L(x) E(✓). The “-” means the letter is in the word but in the wrong position. So S is in the word but not in position 1. Similarly, O is in the word but not in position 2.

Therefore:
- S can be in positions 2, 3, or 5. But 5 is E, so 2 or 3.
- O can be in positions 1, 4, or 5. 5 is E, so 1 or 4.

We need a word that:
- Ends in E.
- Contains S in 2 or 3.
- Contains O in 1 or 4.
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated: not A, R, L, T.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try to form a word:
- If O is in position 1, then S must be in 2 or 3.
  - O S _ _ E: O S _ _ E → O S _ _ E → possible: OSMEE? No, not a word.
  - O _ S _ E: O _ S _ E → O C S I E? Not a word.
  - O _ _ S E: O _ _ S E → O P S I E? Not a word.
- If O is in position 4, then S must be in 2 or 3.
  - _ S _ O E: _ S _ O E → C S I O E? Not a word.
  - _ _ S O E: _ _ S O E → C I S O E? Not a word.
  - _ S _ O E → P S I O E? Not a word.
  - _ _ S O E → C H S O E? Not a word.
  - _ _ _ S E → but S must be in 2 or 3.

Wait, let me think differently. We know:
- S is in 2 or 3.
- O is in 1 or 4.
- E is in 5.

Let me list possible patterns:
1. O S _ _ E
   - O S _ _ E → O S _ _ E → O S _ _ E → possible: O S _ _ E → O S _ _ E → need two more letters not A,R,L,T.
   - O S C I E? Not a word.
   - O S M I E? Not a word.
   - O S P I E? Not a word.
   - O S H I E? Not a word.

2. O _ S _ E
   - O _ S _ E → O C S I E? Not a word.
   - O _ S _ E → O P S I E? Not a word.
   - O _ S _ E → O H S I E? Not a word.

3. _ S O _ E
   - _ S O _ E → C S O I E? Not a word.
   - _ S O _ E → P S O I E? Not a word.

4. _ _ O S E
   - _ _ O S E → C H O S E → ""CHOSE""! This is a valid word.
   - Check constraints:
     - Ends in E (✓).
     - Contains O and S (✓).
     - O is in position 3 (originally was in 2, now 3 – allowed).
     - S is in position 4 (originally was in 1 and 4 – now 4, but original feedback said S cannot be in 4 (from AROSE feedback: S(-) means S is in word but not in position 4). So this is a conflict.

Wait, AROSE feedback said S(-) which means S is in word but not in position 4. So S cannot be in 4. So _ _ O S E is invalid.

5. _ S _ O E
   - _ S _ O E → C S I O E? Not a word.
   - _ S _ O E → P S I O E? Not a word.

6. _ _ _ S E
   - But S must be in 2 or 3.

Let me think of actual words:
- Words ending in E with O and S:
  - ""POSE"" – but only 4 letters.
  - ""HOUSE"" – has H, O, U, S, E. Check constraints:
    - Ends in E (✓).
    - Contains O and S (✓).
    - O is in position 2 (original O was in 3, now 2 – allowed).
    - S is in position 3 (original S was in 4, now 3 – allowed).
    - Letters used: H, O, U, S, E – none of A, R, L, T.
    - ""HOUSE"" is a valid 5-letter word.

This fits all constraints:
- Ends in E.
- Contains O and S.
- O is in position 2 (originally was in 3, now 2 – allowed).
- S is in position 3 (originally was in 4, now 3 – allowed).
- No A, R, L, T.

Therefore, the next guess is ""HOUSE"".

Let's consolidate everything we know after three guesses.

Known facts:
1. The word ends in E (position 5).
2. It contains O and S.
3. From AROSE:  
   - A, R are out.  
   - O is not in position 3.  
   - S is not in position 4.  
4. From STOLE:  
   - T, L are out.  
   - S is not in position 1.  
   - O is not in position 2.  
5. From HOUSE:  
   - H, U are out.  
   - O is in position 2 (✓).  
   - S is not in position 3.  

Putting these together:
- Position 5: E (fixed).
- Position 2: O (fixed).
- S must be in position 4 (only remaining spot for S: positions 1 and 3 are excluded by previous feedback, position 2 is O, position 5 is E).
- Therefore the word pattern is: _ O _ S E.

Letters already ruled out: A, R, L, T, H, U.

We need two more letters (positions 1 and 3) from the remaining alphabet, forming a valid English word.

Possible candidates:
- B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common words matching _ O _ S E:
- BOISE – but I is allowed, but is it common?
- COUSE – not a standard word.
- DOUSE – valid word, letters D, O, U, S, E – but U is already ruled out.
- FOYSE – not a word.
- GOOSE – valid word, G, O, O, S, E – but has two O's; we only know one O is required.
- MOOSE – has two O's and an extra S; likely invalid.
- NOOSE – same issue with double O.
- POISE – P, O, I, S, E – I is allowed, P is allowed.
- VOYSE – not a word.

The most plausible valid word fitting the pattern _ O _ S E with no ruled-out letters is ""POISE"".

Check constraints:
- Ends in E (✓).
- O in position 2 (✓).
- S in position 4 (✓).
- Letters P, O, I, S, E – none of A, R, L, T, H, U appear.

Guess 4: POISE -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(✓) I(x) S(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's summarize everything we now know:

1. The word ends in E (position 5).
2. It contains:
   - O in position 2 (from HOUSE feedback).
   - S in position 4 (from POISE feedback, since S is marked ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not in position 3, and positions 1,2,5 are already taken by P,O,E respectively, so S must be in position 4).
3. Letters ruled out so far:
   A, R, L, T, H, U, I
4. Letters confirmed:
   P (✓ in position 1), O (✓ in position 2), S (must be in position 4), E (✓ in position 5)
5. The pattern is now: P O _ S E

We need a single letter for position 3 that hasn't been ruled out yet. The remaining letters (from the alphabet excluding the ruled-out ones) are:
B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for common 5-letter words matching P O _ S E:
- POBSE – not a word
- POCSE – not a word
- PODSE – not a word
- POFSE – not a word
- POGSE – not a word
- POKSE – not a word
- POMSE – not a word
- PONSE – not a word
- POOSE – not a word
- POYSE – not a word

Wait, let's double-check the pattern. From POISE feedback:
- P(✓) – correct in position 1
- O(✓) – correct in position 2
- I(x) – I is not in the word
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 3 (which aligns with our earlier deduction that S must be in position 4)
- E(✓) – correct in position 5

Thus the pattern is definitely P O _ S E.

The only common English word that fits this pattern is ""POSE"" but it's only 4 letters. However, we know the word is 5 letters. Looking again, the correct word must be ""POISE"" but that was already guessed. 

Wait, let me re-examine the pattern: P O _ S E. The only valid 5-letter word fitting this is ""POISE"" which was already guessed. This suggests an inconsistency, indicating we might have missed a possibility.

But ""POISE"" was guessed as POISE and the feedback was P(✓) O(✓) I(x) S(-) E(✓). This implies the word is P O _ S E with the third letter not being I. The only remaining possibility is ""POUSE"" but U is ruled out.

This seems like a contradiction, which suggests we might have made an error. Let me re-examine the feedback:

From POISE:
- P(✓) – P is correct in position 1
- O(✓) – O is correct in position 2
- I(x) – I is not in the word
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 3
- E(✓) – E is correct in position 5

Thus the word is P O _ _ E with S somewhere in positions 3 or 4. But position 4 is already E, so S must be in position 3. However, the feedback for S in POISE was ""-"", meaning S is in the word but not in position 3. This is a contradiction unless we misread.

Wait, no: in POISE, S is in position 4, and the feedback was ""-"", which means S is in the word but not in position 4. This changes things.

Re-evaluating:

From POISE:
- P(✓) – P is correct in position 1
- O(✓) – O is correct in position 2
- I(x) – I is not in the word
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4
- E(✓) – E is correct in position 5

Thus the word is P O _ _ E with S in position 3.

So the pattern is P O S _ E.

Now looking for 5-letter words matching P O S _ E:
- POSSE – valid word, letters P, O, S, S, E. The second S is allowed since we only know S is in the word (not its count).
- POSIE – but I is ruled out.
- POSKE – not a word.
- POSLE – L is ruled out.
- POSME – not a word.

The only valid word fitting P O S _ E is ""POSSE"".

Check constraints:
- P(✓) position 1
- O(✓) position 2
- S in position 3 (allowed, since earlier feedback only said S not in positions 1,3,4 – but from STOLE S was not in 1, from AROSE S not in 4, and from POISE S not in 4. Wait, let me re-check:

From AROSE: S(-) – S is in word but not in position 4
From STOLE: S(-) – S is in word but not in position 1
From POISE: S(-) – S is in word but not in position 4 (same as AROSE)
Thus S must be in position 2 or 3. But position 2 is O, so S must be in position 3.

Thus the word must be P O S _ E. The only valid word is ""POSSE"".Based on the updated interpretation of the feedback, the word must be P O S _ E with S in position 3. The only valid 5-letter word fitting this is:

Let's update our knowledge after the fifth guess.

1. The word ends in E (position 5).
2. From POSSE feedback:
   - P(✓) – P is correct in position 1
   - O(✓) – O is correct in position 2
   - S(✓) – S is correct in position 3
   - S(-) – There is another S in the word but it is not in position 4
   - E(✓) – E is correct in position 5

So the pattern is: P O S _ E, and there must be another S somewhere. The only remaining position is position 4, but the feedback says the S in position 4 is not there. This implies the word must have two S's, but one is already in position 3, and the other must be in position 4, yet the feedback says it's not. This seems contradictory.

However, the feedback for POSSE shows the second S in position 4 is marked ""-"", meaning the letter S is in the word but not in position 4. This suggests there is only one S in the word, which is in position 3. But the feedback for POISE said S is in the word but not in position 3, and now POSSE says S is in position 3. This is consistent if there is only one S in position 3.

Re-evaluating:
- From POISE: S is in word but not in position 4
- From POSSE: S is in position 3 (✓)

Thus, the word is P O S _ E, and the only remaining letter for position 4 must be a letter that hasn't been ruled out. The letters ruled out so far are: A, R, L, T, H, U, I. The remaining letters are: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for 5-letter words matching P O S _ E:
- POSSE – already guessed, but the second S is not allowed in position 4
- POSKE – not a word
- POSLE – L is ruled out
- POSME – not a word
- POSNE – not a word
- POSBE – not a word
- POSCE – not a word
- POSDE – not a word
- POSFE – not a word
- POSGE – not a word
- POSJE – not a word
- POSKE – not a word
- POSME – not a word
- POSNE – not a word
- POSVE – not a word

The only valid word seems to be ""POSSE"", but the feedback contradicts it. This suggests the word must be ""POSSE"" despite the apparent contradiction, as it's the only possible word fitting the pattern. However, the feedback indicates the second S is not in position 4, which aligns with ""POSSE"" having two S's, but the first S is in position 3. This is possible if the word is ""POSSE"".

But let's check if there's another word. The word must be P O S _ E with the fourth letter not yet ruled out. The only valid word is ""POSSE"".

Given the constraints, the word must be ""POSSE"".
