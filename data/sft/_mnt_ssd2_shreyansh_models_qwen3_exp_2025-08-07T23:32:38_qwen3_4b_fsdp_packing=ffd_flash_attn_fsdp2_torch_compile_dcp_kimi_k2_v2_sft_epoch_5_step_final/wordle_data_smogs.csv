### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good first guess would use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains A, R, O, S, and E - five of the most common letters. This gives us maximum coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A: x → not in the word
- R: x → not in the word
- O: ✓ → is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter)
- S: - → is in the word but not in the 4th position
- E: x → not in the word

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern: _ _ O _ _
- It contains S somewhere (but not in position 4)
- It does NOT contain A, R, or E

We need a word that:
1. Has O in the 3rd position
2. Contains S somewhere other than position 4
3. Avoids A, R, E

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting _ _ O _ _ with S not in 4th:
- ""POINT"" – but has I and N, which are good candidates
- ""SPOIL"" – S is 1st, O 3rd, but has I and L
- ""SNOUT"" – S 1st, O 3rd, but has N, U, T
- ""SLOTH"" – S 1st, O 3rd, but has L, T, H
- ""SLOPE"" – but E is excluded
- ""SLOBS"" – S 1st, O 3rd, but has L, B, S (S appears twice, but position 4 is S which is invalid)
- ""SLOTH"" is valid, but let's see if we can find a better one

""POINT"" seems good:
- P, I, N, T are all common letters not yet ruled out
- S is not in it, but we know S is in the word, so this is a problem
Wait, we know S is in the word, so we must include S.

Let's try ""SLOTH"":
- S 1st, O 3rd, L 2nd, T 4th, H 5th
- S is in the word (position 1), O is correct (position 3), and T is in position 4 (but S is in position 1, so no conflict)
- No A, R, E

This seems like a strong second guess.

Wait, we know S is in the word, so we must include S.

The feedback says the model answer is not five letters, which means ""sno by"" was interpreted as two separate words (""sno"" and ""by"") rather than a single 5-letter word. I need to correct this by using a valid 5-letter word that fits the pattern S _ O _ _ and avoids the forbidden letters.

Let me reconsider the candidates that fit S _ O _ _ without repeating any forbidden letters (A, R, E, L, T, H).

Possible valid words:
- SPOOF (S, P, O, O, F) – but O repeats, which is allowed since we only know O is in position 3, not that it can't appear elsewhere. However, this might not be the best choice.
- SNOOK (S, N, O, O, K) – similar issue with O repeating.
- SPOON (S, P, O, O, N) – again O repeats.
- SWORD – but R is forbidden.
- SMOKE – but E is forbidden.
- SNOBY – but this was rejected because it was split into two words.

Looking for words with no repeated letters and no forbidden letters:
- SPOOF – has two O's, which is acceptable since we only know one O is in position 3.
- SNOOK – two O's.
- SPOON – two O's.
- SWORD – R is forbidden.
- SMOKE – E is forbidden.
- SNOBY – invalid due to splitting.

The best options seem to be SPOOF, SNOOK, or SPOON. Among these, SPOOF uses P and F, which are common and haven't been ruled out yet. Let's choose SPOOF.

Wait, but SPOOF has two O's. Is that acceptable? The feedback only told us O is in position 3, not that it can't appear elsewhere. So it's valid to test if O appears again.

However, looking back at the feedback:
- Guess 1: arose → O(✓) in position 3, but S was marked as (-) meaning S is in the word but not in position 4.
- Guess 2: sloth → S(✓) in position 1, O(✓) in position 3, and other letters were marked x (not in word).
- Guess 3: sno by was invalid because it wasn't a single word.

So the pattern is now locked as S _ O _ _. We need to fill positions 2, 4, 5 with letters not in {A, R, E, L, T, H}.

Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common words:
- SPOOF – S P O O F – valid, but has two O's.
- SNOOK – S N O O K – valid, but two O's.
- SPOON – S P O O N – valid, but two O's.
- SWORD – R is forbidden.
- SMOKE – E is forbidden.
- SNOBY – invalid.

The most common valid word here seems to be SPOOF. Let's go with that.

But wait, let me check if there's a word without repeating O:
- SPOOF – two O's.
- SNOOK – two O's.
- SPOON – two O's.
- SPOOF is actually the only one with two O's, but there's also:
- SPOOF, SNOOK, SPOON are the main ones.

Actually, looking at the remaining letters, there's also:
- SPOOF – P, F are allowed.
- SNOOK – N, K are allowed.
- SPOON – P, N are allowed.

Let's choose SPOOF as it uses P and F, which are good test letters.

But I realize now that SPOOF is a valid word and fits S _ O _ _. Let me confirm:
- S P O O F – positions: 1=S, 2=P, 3=O, 4=O, 5=F.
- No forbidden letters.
- Valid 5-letter word.

This seems correct.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good first guess would use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains A, R, O, S, and E - five of the most common letters. This gives us maximum coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A: x → not in the word
- R: x → not in the word
- O: ✓ → is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter)
- S: - → is in the word but not in the 4th position

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern: _ _ O _ _
- It contains S somewhere (but not in position 4)
- It does NOT contain A, R, or E

We need a word that:
1. Has O in the 3rd position
2. Contains S somewhere other than position 4
3. Avoids A, R, E

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting _ _ O _ _ with S not in 4th:
- ""POINT"" – but has I and N, which are good candidates
- ""SPOIL"" – S is 1st, O 3rd, but has I and L
- ""SNOUT"" – S 1st, O 3rd, but has N, U, T
- ""SLOTH"" – S 1st, O 3rd, but has L, T, H
- ""SLOPE"" – but E is excluded
- ""SLOBS"" – S 1st, O 3rd, but has L, B, S (S appears twice, but position 4 is S which is invalid)
- ""SLOTH"" is valid, but let's see if we can find a better one

""POINT"" seems good:
- P, I, N, T are all common letters not yet ruled out
- S is not in it, but we know S is in the word, so this is a problem
Wait, we know S is in the word, so we must include S.

Let's try ""SLOTH"":

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good first guess would use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains A, R, O, S, and E - five of the most common letters. This gives us maximum coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A: x → not in the word
- R: x → not in the word
- O: ✓ → is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter)
- S: - → is in the word but not in the 4th position
- E: x → not in the word

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern: _ _ O _ _
- It contains S somewhere (but not in position 4)
- It does NOT contain A, R, or E

We need a word that:
1. Has O in the 3rd position
2. Contains S somewhere other than position 4
3. Avoids A, R, E

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting _ _ O _ _ with S not in 4th:
- ""POINT"" – but has I and N, which are good candidates
- ""SPOIL"" – S is 1st, O 3rd, but has I and L
- ""SNOUT"" – S 1st, O 3rd, but has N, U, T
- ""SLOTH"" – S 1st, O 3rd, but has L, T, H
- ""SLOPE"" – but E is excluded
- ""SLOBS"" – S 1st, O 3rd, but has L, B, S (S appears twice, but position 4 is S which is invalid)
- ""SLOTH"" is valid, but let's see if we can find a better one

""POINT"" seems good:
- P, I, N, T are all common letters not yet ruled out
- S is not in it, but we know S is in the word, so this is a problem
Wait, we know S is in the word, so we must include S.

Let's try ""SLOTH"":
- S 1st, O 3rd, L 2nd, T 4th, H 5th
- S is in the word (position 1), O is correct (position 3), and T is in position 4 (but S is in position 1, so no conflict)
- No A, R, E

This seems like a strong second guess.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Pattern: S _ O _ _
   - S is correct in position 1.
   - O is correct in position 3.

2. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
   A, R, E, L, T, H

3. Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
   - S (already fixed at position 1)
   - O (already fixed at position 3)

4. Remaining letters to consider (excluding the ruled-out ones):
   B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

5. We need to fill positions 2, 4, and 5 with letters from the remaining pool, ensuring:
   - No repeats of A, R, E, L, T, H
   - The word remains valid (i.e., exists in English dictionaries)

Possible candidates that fit S _ O _ _ and avoid the forbidden letters:
- SPOON (but P is allowed, N is allowed, but O repeats - invalid since O is already in position 3)
- SWORD (W, O, R, D - but R is forbidden)
- SWOOP (P is allowed, but O repeats)
- SNOOK (N, K are allowed)
- SPONG (G is allowed)
- SMOKE (K, E - but E is forbidden)
- SPOOF (F is allowed)
- SNOUT (T is forbidden)
- SNOBY (B, Y are allowed)

Let's pick ""SNOBY"":
- S (position 1) ✓
- N (position 2) - allowed
- O (position 3) ✓
- B (position 4) - allowed
- Y (position 5) - allowed
- No forbidden letters (A, R, E, L, T, H)
- Valid 5-letter word

This seems like a strong third guess.

Guess 3: sno by -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The feedback says the model answer is not five letters, which means ""sno by"" was interpreted as two separate words (""sno"" and ""by"") rather than a single 5-letter word. I need to correct this by using a valid 5-letter word that fits the pattern S _ O _ _ and avoids the forbidden letters.

Let me reconsider the candidates that fit S _ O _ _ without repeating any forbidden letters (A, R, E, L, T, H).

Possible valid words:
- SPOOF (S, P, O, O, F) – but O repeats, which is allowed since we only know O is in position 3, not that it can't appear elsewhere. However, this might not be the best choice.
- SNOOK (S, N, O, O, K) – similar issue with O repeating.
- SPOON (S, P, O, O, N) – again O repeats.
- SWORD – but R is forbidden.
- SMOKE – but E is forbidden.
- SNOBY – but this was rejected because it was split into two words.

Looking for words with no repeated letters and no forbidden letters:
- SPOOF – has two O's, which is acceptable since we only know one O is in position 3.
- SNOOK – two O's.
- SPOON – two O's.
- SWORD – R is forbidden.
- SMOKE – E is forbidden.
- SNOBY – invalid due to splitting.

The best options seem to be SPOOF, SNOOK, or SPOON. Among these, SPOOF uses P and F, which are common and haven't been ruled out yet. Let's choose SPOOF.

Wait, but SPOOF has two O's. Is that acceptable? The feedback only told us O is in position 3, not that it can't appear elsewhere. So it's valid to test if O appears again.

However, looking back at the feedback:
- Guess 1: arose → O(✓) in position 3, but S was marked as (-) meaning S is in the word but not in position 4.
- Guess 2: sloth → S(✓) in position 1, O(✓) in position 3, and other letters were marked x (not in word).
- Guess 3: sno by was invalid because it wasn't a single word.

So the pattern is now locked as S _ O _ _. We need to fill positions 2, 4, 5 with letters not in {A, R, E, L, T, H}.

Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common words:
- SPOOF – S P O O F – valid, but has two O's.
- SNOOK – S N O O K – valid, but two O's.
- SPOON – S P O O N – valid, but two O's.
- SWORD – R is forbidden.
- SMOKE – E is forbidden.
- SNOBY – invalid.

The most common valid word here seems to be SPOOF. Let's go with that.

But wait, let me check if there's a word without repeating O:
- SPOOF – two O's.
- SNOOK – two O's.
- SPOON – two O's.
- SPOOF is actually the only one with two O's, but there's also:
- SPOOF, SNOOK, SPOON are the main ones.

Actually, looking at the remaining letters, there's also:
- SPOOF – P, F are allowed.
- SNOOK – N, K are allowed.
- SPOON – P, N are allowed.

Let's choose SPOOF as it uses P and F, which are good test letters.

But I realize now that SPOOF is a valid word and fits S _ O _ _. Let me confirm:
- S P O O F – positions: 1=S, 2=P, 3=O, 4=O, 5=F.
- No forbidden letters.
- Valid 5-letter word.

This seems correct.

Among these, SPOOF uses P and F, which are common and haven\'t been ruled out yet. Let\'s choose SPOOF.\n\nWait, but SPOOF has two O\'s. Is that acceptable? The feedback only told us O is in position 3, not that it can\'t appear elsewhere. So it\'s valid to test if O appears again.\n\nHowever, looking back at the feedback:\n- Guess 1: arose → O(✓) in position 3, but S was marked as (-) meaning S is in the word but not in position 4.\n- Guess 2: sloth → S(✓) in position 1, O(✓) in position 3, and other letters were marked x (not in word).\n- Guess 3: sno by was invalid because it wasn\'t a single word.\n\nSo the pattern is now locked as S _ O _ _.

The feedback for all attempts ""spoo f"" has been ""Model answer is not five letters,"" which is due to the assistant misinterpreting the input as two separate words (""spoo"" and ""f"") rather than the single 5-letter word ""spooF"" (which is actually not a valid English word either). This indicates the need for a valid 5-letter word that fits the pattern S _ O _ _ and avoids the forbidden letters A, R, E, L, T, H.

Looking at the pattern S _ O _ _, and considering the remaining valid letters (B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z), the most common valid word is ""SPOOF"" (S, P, O, O, F). However, since ""spoo f"" was rejected, we should use the correct spelling ""SPOOF"" as a single word.

Let's verify:
- S is correct in position 1.
- O is correct in position 3.
- Avoiding A, R, E, L, T, H.
- Using P and F which are still allowed.

Thus, the correct next guess is ""SPOOF"".
