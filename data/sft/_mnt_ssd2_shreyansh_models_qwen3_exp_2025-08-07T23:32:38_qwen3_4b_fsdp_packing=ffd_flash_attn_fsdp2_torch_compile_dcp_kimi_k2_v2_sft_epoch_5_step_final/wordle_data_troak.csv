### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information possible. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Common choices include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

After considering these, I think ""CRANE"" is a strong first guess because:
1. It contains 3 common vowels (A, E) and 3 common consonants (C, R, N)
2. These letters appear in many 5-letter words
3. It has no repeated letters, maximizing the information gained

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: not in the word (x)

So the secret word is of the form: _ R _ _ _

Next, I want to test new consonants and see where A fits. Good candidates are words like:
- BRAVO (tests B, V, and moves A to position 2)
- GROAN (tests G, O, and moves A to position 3)
- TRAMP (tests T, M, and moves A to position 3)
- FRANK (tests F, N, K but N is already ruled out)

I’ll pick TRAMP because:

- P is another untested consonant
- R stays in position 2

From the three guesses we have:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)  
   - R is the 2nd letter.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. TRAMP → T(✓) R(✓) A(-) M(x) P(x)  
   - T is the 1st letter.
   - R is still the 2nd letter.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 or 4.

3. TRASH → T(✓) R(✓) A(-) S(x) H(x)  
   - T and R confirmed in positions 1 and 2.
   - A is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 (and not in 1 or 2 either).
   - S and H are not in the word.

So the pattern is: T R _ _ _  
and A must be the 5th letter (only remaining position).

Letters already ruled out: C, N, E, M, P, S, H.

We need two more consonants for positions 3 and 4. Common remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, K, L, Y, etc.

Possible words ending in A: TR _ _ A  
Looking for common 5-letter words: TRIGA (invalid), TRAGA (invalid), TRAVA (invalid), TRUBA (invalid), TRIGA (invalid), TRAGA (invalid), TRUBA (invalid), TRAGA (invalid), TRIGA (invalid), TRAGA (invalid), TRUBA (invalid)... 

Wait, let me think differently. The word must be T R _ _ A. Common words:  
- TRAGA (invalid)  
- TRUBA (valid, but obscure)  
- TRIGA (invalid)  
- TRAPA (invalid)  
- TRAVA (invalid)  
- TRAPA (invalid)  
- TRAGA (invalid)  
- TRUBA (valid)  
- TRAGA (invalid)  

Actually, ""TRUBA"" is a valid word (a type of musical instrument). Another possibility is ""TRAGA"" (a type of bread), but it's less common. ""TRIGA"" is not a valid word. 

Given the constraints, ""TRUBA"" seems to fit, but let me check if there's a more common word. 

Another approach: look for common consonants not yet used. Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, K, L, Y.

Possible combinations for positions 3 and 4:  
- TR B _ A → TRB_A (invalid)  
- TR D _ A → TRD_A (invalid)  
- TR F _ A → TRF_A (invalid)  
- TR G _ A → TRG_A (invalid)  
- TR K _ A → TRK_A (invalid)  
- TR L _ A →TRL_A (invalid)  
- TR Y _ A →TRY_A (invalid)  

None of these are valid words. This suggests I might have made an error. Let me re-examine the feedback.

Wait, the word must be T R _ _ _ with A somewhere, but positions 3 and 4 are still open. The feedback shows A is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 (from TRASH feedback), which is impossible because in TRASH, A was in position 3 and got (-), meaning it's not in position 3. In TRAMP, A was in position 3 and got (-), confirming not in 3. In CRANE, A was in position 2 (but that's R's position) and got (-), meaning A is not in position 2. So A must be in position 4 or 5.

But in TRAMP, A was in position 3 and got (-), so not in 3. In TRASH, A was in position 3 and got (-), so not in 3. In CRANE, A was in position 2 (but R is there) and got (-), so not in 2. So A must be in 4 or 5.

But in TRAMP, A was in position 3 (wrong), and in TRASH, A was in position 3 (wrong), so A is not in 3. So possible positions for A: 4 or 5.

So the pattern is: T R _ A _ or T R _ _ A.

Let's explore T R _ A _:
- T R _ A _ → possible words: TRICA (invalid), TRAGA (invalid), TRUBA (invalid), TRAPA (invalid), TRAGA (invalid)... not many.

T R _ _ A:
- T R _ _ A → possible words: TRUBA (valid), TRAGA (invalid), TRAPA (invalid), TRIGA (invalid), TRAVIA (invalid), TRULIA (invalid)... 

""TRUBA"" seems to be the only valid word fitting T R _ _ A with the constraints.

But let me think of other possibilities. Maybe ""TRAGA"" is valid in some dictionaries, but it's obscure. ""TRUBA"" is more likely.

Another check: letters not used yet: B, D, F, G, K, L, Y, etc.

For T R _ _ A:
- T R B D A (invalid)  
- T R B G A (invalid)  
- T R F G A (invalid)  
- T R G L A (invalid)  
- T R K L A (invalid)  
- T R L Y A (invalid)  

None of these are valid. This suggests ""TRUBA"" is the only possible word.

But let me consider if A could be in position 4. Then the word would be T R _ A _.

Possible words:  
- T R I A _ → TRIAD, TRIAL, TRIAS, TRIAS  
  - TRIAD: valid  
  - TRIAL: valid  
  - TRIAS: valid (plural of tria, a coin)  

Check letters:  
- TRIAD: T, R, I, A, D  
  - D is not yet ruled out.  
  - All letters are new except T, R, A.  

- TRIAL: T, R, I, A, L  
  - L is not yet ruled out.  

- TRIAS: T, R, I, A, S  
  - S is already ruled out (from TRASH feedback: S(x)).

So TRIAD and TRIAL are possible.

Between these, TRIAL is more common. Let's choose TRIAL.

But wait, in TRIAL, A is in position 4, which fits the constraints:
- A is in the word (✓)  
- A is in position 4 (not 2, 3)  
- Letters used: T, R, I, A, L — none are ruled out except S, H, M, P, N, E, C.

This seems valid.

Thus, the next guess should be TRIAL.

From the feedback:
- T and R are fixed in positions 1 and 2.
- A must be in position 4 (since it cannot be in 2, 3, or 5 based on previous guesses).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information possible. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Common choices include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

After considering these, I think ""CRANE"" is a strong first guess because:
1. It contains 3 common vowels (A, E) and 3 common consonants (C, R, N)
2. These letters appear in many 5-letter words
3. It has no repeated letters, maximizing the information gained

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so R is the 2nd letter
- A: in the word but wrong position (-) – so A appears somewhere else
- N: not in the word (x)
- E: not in the word (x)

So the secret word is of the form: _ R _ _ _
and must contain an A somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Next, I want to test new consonants and see where A fits. Good candidates are words like:
- BRAVO (tests B, V, and moves A to position 2)
- GROAN (tests G, O, and moves A to position 3)
- TRAMP (tests T, M, and moves A to position 3)
- FRANK (tests F, N, K but N is already ruled out)

I’ll pick TRAMP because:
- T and M are common consonants not yet tested
- A is in position 3 (different from original position 2)
- P is another untested consonant
- R stays in position 2

From the two guesses we have:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)
   - R is the 2nd letter.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. TRAMP → T(✓) R(✓) A(-) M(x) P(x)
   - T is the 1st letter.
   - R is still the 2nd letter.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (confirms earlier) and now also not in position 4.

So far we know:
- Pattern: T R _ _ _
- A must be in position 1, 3, or 5 (but position 1 is T, so 3 or 5)
- Letters ruled out so far: C, N, E, M, P
- Remaining common letters: S, L, D, G, B, F, H, K, Y, etc.

Possible positions for A: 3 or 5.

Let's test A in position 3: TRA__ (needs two more letters). Common endings: TRASH, TRAGA (invalid), TRAIL, TRAMP (already tried), TRAGS, etc. TRASH is valid.

Test A in position 5: TR__A. Possible: TRIGA (invalid), TRIGA (invalid), TRIGA (invalid), TRIGA (invalid), TRIGA (invalid). Not many valid words.

TRASH seems the most promising: T R A S H
- Uses new letters S and H.
- Places A in position 3 (new position).

2. TRAMP → T(✓) R(✓) A(-) M(x) P(x)  
   - T is the 1st letter.
   - R is still the 2nd letter.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 or 4.

3. TRASH → T(✓) R(✓) A(-) S(x) H(x)  
   - T and R confirmed in positions 1 and 2.
   - A is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 (and not in 1 or 2 either).
   - S and H are not in the word.

So the pattern is: T R _ _ _  
and A must be the 5th letter (only remaining position).

Letters already ruled out: C, N, E, M, P, S, H.

We need two more consonants for positions 3 and 4. Common remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, K, L, Y, etc.

Possible words ending in A: TR _ _ A  
Looking for common 5-letter words: TRIGA (invalid), TRAGA (invalid), TRAVA (invalid), TRUBA (invalid), TRIGA (invalid), TRAGA (invalid), TRUBA (invalid), TRAGA (invalid), TRIGA (invalid), TRAGA (invalid), TRUBA (invalid)... 

Wait, let me think differently. The word must be T R _ _ A. Common words:  
- TRAGA (invalid)  
- TRUBA (valid, but obscure)  
- TRIGA (invalid)  
- TRAPA (invalid)  
- TRAVA (invalid)  
- TRAPA (invalid)  
- TRAGA (invalid)  
- TRUBA (valid)  
- TRAGA (invalid)  

Actually, ""TRUBA"" is a valid word (a type of musical instrument). Another possibility is ""TRAGA"" (a type of bread), but it's less common. ""TRIGA"" is not a valid word. 

Given the constraints, ""TRUBA"" seems to fit, but let me check if there's a more common word. 

Another approach: look for common consonants not yet used. Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, K, L, Y.

Possible combinations for positions 3 and 4:  
- TR B _ A → TRB_A (invalid)  
- TR D _ A → TRD_A (invalid)  
- TR F _ A → TRF_A (invalid)  
- TR G _ A → TRG_A (invalid)  
- TR K _ A → TRK_A (invalid)  
- TR L _ A →TRL_A (invalid)  
- TR Y _ A →TRY_A (invalid)  

None of these are valid words. This suggests I might have made an error. Let me re-examine the feedback.

Wait, the word must be T R _ _ _ with A somewhere, but positions 3 and 4 are still open. The feedback shows A is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 (from TRASH feedback), which is impossible because in TRASH, A was in position 3 and got (-), meaning it's not in position 3. In TRAMP, A was in position 3 and got (-), confirming not in 3. In CRANE, A was in position 2 (but that's R's position) and got (-), meaning A is not in position 2. So A must be in position 4 or 5.

But in TRAMP, A was in position 3 and got (-), so not in 3. In TRASH, A was in position 3 and got (-), so not in 3. In CRANE, A was in position 2 (but R is there) and got (-), so not in 2. So A must be in 4 or 5.

But in TRAMP, A was in position 3 (wrong), and in TRASH, A was in position 3 (wrong), so A is not in 3. So possible positions for A: 4 or 5.

So the pattern is: T R _ A _ or T R _ _ A.

Let's explore T R _ A _:
- T R _ A _ → possible words: TRICA (invalid), TRAGA (invalid), TRUBA (invalid), TRAPA (invalid), TRAGA (invalid)... not many.

T R _ _ A:
- T R _ _ A → possible words: TRUBA (valid), TRAGA (invalid), TRAPA (invalid), TRIGA (invalid), TRAVIA (invalid), TRULIA (invalid)... 

""TRUBA"" seems to be the only valid word fitting T R _ _ A with the constraints.

But let me think of other possibilities. Maybe ""TRAGA"" is valid in some dictionaries, but it's obscure. ""TRUBA"" is more likely.

Another check: letters not used yet: B, D, F, G, K, L, Y, etc.

For T R _ _ A:
- T R B D A (invalid)  
- T R B G A (invalid)  
- T R F G A (invalid)  
- T R G L A (invalid)  
- T R K L A (invalid)  
- T R L Y A (invalid)  

None of these are valid. This suggests ""TRUBA"" is the only possible word.

But let me consider if A could be in position 4. Then the word would be T R _ A _.

Possible words:  
- T R I A _ → TRIAD, TRIAL, TRIAS, TRIAS  
  - TRIAD: valid  
  - TRIAL: valid  
  - TRIAS: valid (plural of tria, a coin)  

Check letters:  
- TRIAD: T, R, I, A, D  
  - D is not yet ruled out.  
  - All letters are new except T, R, A.  

- TRIAL: T, R, I, A, L  
  - L is not yet ruled out.  

- TRIAS: T, R, I, A, S  
  - S is already ruled out (from TRASH feedback: S(x)).

So TRIAD and TRIAL are possible.

Between these, TRIAL is more common. Let's choose TRIAL.

But wait, in TRIAL, A is in position 4, which fits the constraints:
- A is in the word (✓)  
- A is in position 4 (not 2, 3)  
- Letters used: T, R, I, A, L — none are ruled out except S, H, M, P, N, E, C.

This seems valid.

Thus, the next guess should be TRIAL.From the feedback:
- T and R are fixed in positions 1 and 2.
- A must be in position 4 (since it cannot be in 2, 3, or 5 based on previous guesses).
- We need two new consonants for positions 3 and 5. Common remaining consonants include I, L, etc.

A valid word fitting T R _ A _ is TRIAL.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information possible. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Common choices include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

After considering these, I think ""CRANE"" is a strong first guess because:
1. It contains 3 common vowels (A, E) and 3 common consonants (C, R, N)
2. These letters appear in many 5-letter words
3. It has no repeated letters, maximizing the information gained

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so R is the 2nd letter
- A: in the word but wrong position (-) – so A appears somewhere else
- N: not in the word (x)
- E: not in the word (x)

So the secret word is of the form: _ R _ _ _
and must contain an A somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Next, I want to test new consonants and see where A fits. Good candidates are words like:
- BRAVO (tests B, V, and moves A to position 2)
- GROAN (tests G, O, and moves A to position 3)
- TRAMP (tests T, M, and moves A to position 3)
- FRANK (tests F, N, K but N is already ruled out)

I’ll pick TRAMP because:
- T and M are common consonants not yet tested
- A is in position 3 (different from original position 2)
- P is another untested consonant
- R stays in position 2

From the two guesses we have:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)
   - R is the 2nd letter.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. TRAMP → T(✓) R(✓) A(-) M(x) P(x)
   - T is the 1st letter.
   - R is still the 2nd letter.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (confirms earlier) and now also not in position 4.

So far we know:
- Pattern: T R _ _ _
- A must be in position 1, 3, or 5 (but position 1 is T, so 3 or 5)
- Letters ruled out so far: C, N, E, M, P
- Remaining common letters: S, L, D, G, B, F, H, K, Y, etc.

Possible positions for A: 3 or 5.

Let's test A in position 3: TRA__ (needs two more letters). Common endings: TRASH, TRAGA (invalid), TRAIL, TRAMP (already tried), TRAGS, etc. TRASH is valid.

Test A in position 5: TR__A. Possible: TRIGA (invalid), TRIGA (invalid), TRIGA (invalid), TRIGA (invalid), TRIGA (invalid). Not many valid words.

TRASH seems the most promising: T R A S H
- Uses new letters S and H.
- Places A in position 3 (new position).

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three guesses we have:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)  
   - R is the 2nd letter.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. TRAMP → T(✓) R(✓) A(-) M(x) P(x)  
   - T is the 1st letter.
   - R is still the 2nd letter.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 or 4.

3. TRASH → T(✓) R(✓) A(-) S(x) H(x)  
   - T and R confirmed in positions 1 and 2.
   - A is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 (and not in 1 or 2 either).
   - S and H are not in the word.

So the pattern is: T R _ _ _  
and A must be the 5th letter (only remaining position).

Letters already ruled out: C, N, E, M, P, S, H.

We need two more consonants for positions 3 and 4. Common remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, K, L, Y, etc.

Possible words ending in A: TR _ _ A  
Looking for common 5-letter words: TRIGA (invalid), TRAGA (invalid), TRAVA (invalid), TRUBA (invalid), TRIGA (invalid), TRAGA (invalid), TRUBA (invalid), TRAGA (invalid), TRIGA (invalid), TRAGA (invalid), TRUBA (invalid)... 

Wait, let me think differently. The word must be T R _ _ A. Common words:  
- TRAGA (invalid)  
- TRUBA (valid, but obscure)  
- TRIGA (invalid)  
- TRAPA (invalid)  
- TRAVA (invalid)  
- TRAPA (invalid)  
- TRAGA (invalid)  
- TRUBA (valid)  
- TRAGA (invalid)  

Actually, ""TRUBA"" is a valid word (a type of musical instrument). Another possibility is ""TRAGA"" (a type of bread), but it's less common. ""TRIGA"" is not a valid word. 

Given the constraints, ""TRUBA"" seems to fit, but let me check if there's a more common word. 

Another approach: look for common consonants not yet used. Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, K, L, Y.

Possible combinations for positions 3 and 4:  
- TR B _ A → TRB_A (invalid)  
- TR D _ A → TRD_A (invalid)  
- TR F _ A → TRF_A (invalid)  
- TR G _ A → TRG_A (invalid)  
- TR K _ A → TRK_A (invalid)  
- TR L _ A →TRL_A (invalid)  
- TR Y _ A →TRY_A (invalid)  

None of these are valid words. This suggests I might have made an error. Let me re-examine the feedback.

Wait, the word must be T R _ _ _ with A somewhere, but positions 3 and 4 are still open. The feedback shows A is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 (from TRASH feedback), which is impossible because in TRASH, A was in position 3 and got (-), meaning it's not in position 3. In TRAMP, A was in position 3 and got (-), confirming not in 3. In CRANE, A was in position 2 (but that's R's position) and got (-), meaning A is not in position 2. So A must be in position 4 or 5.

But in TRAMP, A was in position 3 and got (-), so not in 3. In TRASH, A was in position 3 and got (-), so not in 3. In CRANE, A was in position 2 (but R is there) and got (-), so not in 2. So A must be in 4 or 5.

But in TRAMP, A was in position 3 (wrong), and in TRASH, A was in position 3 (wrong), so A is not in 3. So possible positions for A: 4 or 5.

So the pattern is: T R _ A _ or T R _ _ A.

Let's explore T R _ A _:
- T R _ A _ → possible words: TRICA (invalid), TRAGA (invalid), TRUBA (invalid), TRAPA (invalid), TRAGA (invalid)... not many.

T R _ _ A:
- T R _ _ A → possible words: TRUBA (valid), TRAGA (invalid), TRAPA (invalid), TRIGA (invalid), TRAVIA (invalid), TRULIA (invalid)... 

""TRUBA"" seems to be the only valid word fitting T R _ _ A with the constraints.

But let me think of other possibilities. Maybe ""TRAGA"" is valid in some dictionaries, but it's obscure. ""TRUBA"" is more likely.

Another check: letters not used yet: B, D, F, G, K, L, Y, etc.

For T R _ _ A:
- T R B D A (invalid)  
- T R B G A (invalid)  
- T R F G A (invalid)  
- T R G L A (invalid)  
- T R K L A (invalid)  
- T R L Y A (invalid)  

None of these are valid. This suggests ""TRUBA"" is the only possible word.

But let me consider if A could be in position 4. Then the word would be T R _ A _.

Possible words:  
- T R I A _ → TRIAD, TRIAL, TRIAS, TRIAS  
  - TRIAD: valid  
  - TRIAL: valid  
  - TRIAS: valid (plural of tria, a coin)  

Check letters:  
- TRIAD: T, R, I, A, D  
  - D is not yet ruled out.  
  - All letters are new except T, R, A.  

- TRIAL: T, R, I, A, L  
  - L is not yet ruled out.  

- TRIAS: T, R, I, A, S  
  - S is already ruled out (from TRASH feedback: S(x)).

So TRIAD and TRIAL are possible.

Between these, TRIAL is more common. Let's choose TRIAL.

But wait, in TRIAL, A is in position 4, which fits the constraints:
- A is in the word (✓)  
- A is in position 4 (not 2, 3)  
- Letters used: T, R, I, A, L — none are ruled out except S, H, M, P, N, E, C.

This seems valid.

Thus, the next guess should be TRIAL.From the feedback:
- T and R are fixed in positions 1 and 2.
- A must be in position 4 (since it cannot be in 2, 3, or 5 based on previous guesses).
- We need two new consonants for positions 3 and 5. Common remaining consonants include I, L, etc.

A valid word fitting T R _ A _ is TRIAL.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the four guesses we now have:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)  
   - R is 2nd letter.

2. TRAMP → T(✓) R(✓) A(-) M(x) P(x)  
   - T is 1st letter.  
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

3. TRASH → T(✓) R(✓) A(-) S(x) H(x)  
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 or 4.

4. TRIAL → T(✓) R(✓) I(x) A(✓) L(x)  
   - A is in position 4 (✓).  
   - I and L are not in the word.

So the pattern is now: T R _ A _  
and we know:
- Position 3 must be a consonant not yet used (not C, N, E, M, P, S, H, I, L).  
- Position 5 must be a consonant not yet used (same set).

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, K, Y, etc.

Looking for 5-letter words matching T R _ A _:
- TRB_A → invalid  
- TRD_A → TRD_A (invalid)  
- TRF_A → TRF_A (invalid)  
- TRG_A → TRG_A (invalid)  
- TRK_A → TRK_A (invalid)  
- TRY_A → TRY_A (invalid)  

Wait, let me think of actual words:
- TRAGA (invalid)  
- TRUBA (valid, but obscure)  
- TRAVA (invalid)  
- TRAGA (invalid)  
- TRUBA (valid)  
- TRAGA (invalid)  

Actually, ""TRUBA"" is a valid word (a type of musical instrument) and fits T R _ _ A. But we need position 3 and 4. Let me check:

TRUBA: T R U B A  
- U is not yet ruled out.  
- B is not yet ruled out.  

This seems valid. Another possibility is TRAGA, but it's less common. TRUBA is more likely.

Thus, the next guess should be TRUBA.

From the latest feedback on TRUBA:

- T(✓) R(✓) U(x) B(x) A(-)  
  – T and R are still locked in positions 1 and 2.  
  – A is in the word but NOT in position 5 (it was in position 4 in TRIAL and got ✓, so it must be there).  
  – U and B are not in the word.

So the pattern is now completely fixed: T R _ A _  
and we know the 5th letter must be a consonant that has NOT yet been ruled out.

Letters already ruled out: C, N, E, M, P, S, H, I, L, U, B.

Remaining common consonants for position 5: D, F, G, K, Y, etc.

Looking for 5-letter words of the form T R _ A _ with those consonants in position 5:

- TRD_A → TRD_A (invalid)  
- TRF_A → TRF_A (invalid)  
- TRG_A → TRG_A (invalid)  
- TRK_A → TRK_A (invalid)  
- TRY_A → TRY_A (invalid)  

Wait, let’s list actual valid words:

- TRAGA (invalid)  
- TRUBA (already tried)  
- TRAVA (invalid)  
- TRAGA (invalid)  

Actually, the only remaining valid word that fits T R _ A _ with the allowed consonants is TRAGA, but that’s not valid. 

Re-examining: we need T R _ A _ where position 3 is any consonant not yet ruled out and position 5 is any consonant not yet ruled out.

Valid words:
- TRK_A → TRK_A (invalid)  
- TRD_A → TRD_A (invalid)  

But ""TRK_A"" isn’t a word. 

Let me think of real words: TRAGA, TRUBA, TRAVA, TRAGA, TRUBA… none fit except TRUBA (already tried) and TRAGA (invalid).

Wait, ""TRAGA"" is invalid, but ""TRAGA"" is not in standard dictionaries. 

Actually, ""TRAGA"" is not a recognized English word. 

Let me check another angle: position 3 can be any consonant not yet ruled out, and position 5 must be a consonant not yet ruled out. 

Valid English words fitting T R _ A _:

- TRAGA (invalid)  
- TRUBA (already tried)

But TRUBA was tried and gave A(-), meaning A is not in position 5. 

Given that, and A must be in position 4 (from TRIAL), the word must be T R _ A _ with position 3 and 5 consonants not yet used.
