For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English

This gives me maximum information about letter presence and position in the first guess.

2. Avoids S
3. Avoids the excluded positions for A, R, O, E

A good next guess is ""OCEAN"" because:
- It reuses the known letters A, O, E
- Adds C and N which are common
- Places A in position 4 (allowed, since A was not in position 1)
- Places R in position 2 (but wait, R was excluded from position 2 - oops, bad choice)

Let me try ""ROATE"":
- Uses R, O, A, E
- Adds T
- Positions: R1, O2, A3, E4, T5

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English

This gives me maximum information about letter presence and position in the first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3
- S(x): S is NOT in the word at all
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, O, E
- Does NOT contain S
- A is not in position 1
- R is not in position 2
- O is not in position 3
- E is not in position 5

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A, R, O, E (and one more letter)
2. Avoids S
3. Avoids the excluded positions for A, R, O, E

A good next guess is ""OCEAN"" because:
- It reuses the known letters A, O, E
- Adds C and N which are common
- Places A in position 4 (allowed, since A was not in position 1)
- Places R in position 2 (but wait, R was excluded from position 2 - oops, bad choice)

Let me try ""ROATE"":
- Uses R, O, A, E
- Adds T
- Positions: R1, O2, A3, E4, T5
- R in position 1 (allowed, since R was excluded from position 2)
- O in position 2 (allowed, since O was excluded from position 3)
- A in position 3 (allowed, since A was excluded from position 1)
- E in position 4 (allowed, since E was excluded from position 5)

This seems valid and gives new positions to test.

Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: roate -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
   - A, R, O, E are all in the word but not in their guessed positions.
   - S is not in the word.

2. roate → R(-) O(-) A(-) T(x) E(-)
   - R, O, A, E are again marked “in word but wrong place.”
   - T is not in the word.

So we now know:
- Letters definitely present: A, R, O, E (four distinct letters)
- One more letter must be present (unknown so far).
- Letters definitely absent: S, T
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be in positions 1 or 3
  – R cannot be in positions 1 or 2
  – O cannot be in positions 2 or 3
  – E cannot be in positions 4 or 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A, R, O, E plus one new letter (not S or T).
- Respects all position exclusions above.

Let’s try to place the new letter in a position that hasn’t been tested yet.  
A good candidate is “EARLY”:
- E A R L Y
- Contains A, R, E (but not O – oops, missing O).
  
Next try “EAROM” – but M is fine, and positions:
E(1) A(2) R(3) O(4) M(5)
Check exclusions:
- E: not in 4 or 5 – 1 is allowed
- A: not in 1 or 3 – 2 is allowed
- R: not in 1 or 2 – 3 is allowed
- O: not in 2 or 3 – 4 is allowed
- M: new letter, no restrictions.

So “EAROM” satisfies every constraint.

- P A R E O → ""PAREO"" (valid word, uses P and E)
- F A R E O → ""FAREO"" (invalid)
- N A R E O → ""NAREO"" (invalid)

""PAREO"" is a valid 5-letter word that fits:
- P in position 1 (new letter)
- A in position 2 (locked ✓)
- R in position 3 (locked ✓)
- E in position 4 (allowed, since E can be in position 4)

So the current confirmed structure is:
_  A  R  E  _

And we know:
- Letters already placed: A, R, E
- Letters still needed: one more letter (unknown) and O
- O must be in position 1 (since it cannot be in 2, 3, 4, or 5)
- The fifth letter must be new and not S, T, M, or P.

Therefore the word must be:
O  A  R  E  _

The only common 5-letter word that fits this pattern is ""OARED"".

- A, R, E in their locked positions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English

This gives me maximum information about letter presence and position in the first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3
- S(x): S is NOT in the word at all
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, O, E
- Does NOT contain S
- A is not in position 1
- R is not in position 2
- O is not in position 3
- E is not in position 5

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A, R, O, E (and one more letter)
2. Avoids S
3. Avoids the excluded positions for A, R, O, E

A good next guess is ""OCEAN"" because:
- It reuses the known letters A, O, E
- Adds C and N which are common
- Places A in position 4 (allowed, since A was not in position 1)
- Places R in position 2 (but wait, R was excluded from position 2 - oops, bad choice)

Let me try ""ROATE"":
- Uses R, O, A, E
- Adds T
- Positions: R1, O2, A3, E4, T5
- R in position 1 (allowed, since R was excluded from position 2)
- O in position 2 (allowed, since O was excluded from position 3)
- A in position 3 (allowed, since A was excluded from position 1)
- E in position 4 (allowed, since E was excluded from position 5)

This seems valid and gives new positions to test.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: roate -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
   - A, R, O, E are all in the word but not in their guessed positions.
   - S is not in the word.

2. roate → R(-) O(-) A(-) T(x) E(-)
   - R, O, A, E are again marked “in word but wrong place.”
   - T is not in the word.

So we now know:
- Letters definitely present: A, R, O, E (four distinct letters)
- One more letter must be present (unknown so far).
- Letters definitely absent: S, T
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be in positions 1 or 3
  – R cannot be in positions 1 or 2
  – O cannot be in positions 2 or 3
  – E cannot be in positions 4 or 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A, R, O, E plus one new letter (not S or T).
- Respects all position exclusions above.

Let’s try to place the new letter in a position that hasn’t been tested yet.  
A good candidate is “EARLY”:
- E A R L Y
- Contains A, R, E (but not O – oops, missing O).
  
Next try “EAROM” – but M is fine, and positions:
E(1) A(2) R(3) O(4) M(5)
Check exclusions:
- E: not in 4 or 5 – 1 is allowed
- A: not in 1 or 3 – 2 is allowed
- R: not in 1 or 2 – 3 is allowed
- O: not in 2 or 3 – 4 is allowed
- M: new letter, no restrictions.

So “EAROM” satisfies every constraint.

From the three rounds:

1. arose → A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
2. roate → R(-) O(-) A(-) T(x) E(-)
3. earom → E(-) A(✓) R(✓) O(-) M(x)

What we now know:

- Letters in the word: A, R, E, O (four distinct letters) and one more unknown letter.
- Letters NOT in the word: S, T, M.
- Positions:
  – A is now locked in position 2 (✓).
  – R is locked in position 3 (✓).
  – E is in the word but not in position 1 or 5.
  – O is in the word but not in position 2 or 3 (from arose and roate), and not in position 4 (from earom), so O must be in position 1 or 5.
  – The fifth letter is unknown and must be placed in the remaining slot.

Current partial word: _ A R _ _

Possible placements for O:
- Position 1: O A R _ _
- Position 5: _ A R _ O

We need to find a valid 5-letter word that fits one of these patterns and uses the remaining letters (A, R, E, O plus one new letter). The new letter must not be S, T, or M.

Let’s test the pattern _ A R _ O:
- We need a letter for position 1 and 4.
- Position 4 must be a letter that hasn’t been ruled out and fits the word.

Possible candidates:
- C A R E O → ""CAREO"" (not a valid word)
- P A R E O → ""PAREO"" (valid word, uses P and E)
- F A R E O → ""FAREO"" (invalid)
- N A R E O → ""NAREO"" (invalid)

""PAREO"" is a valid 5-letter word that fits:
- P in position 1 (new letter)
- A in position 2 (locked ✓)
- R in position 3 (locked ✓)
- E in position 4 (allowed, since E can be in position 4)
- O in position 5 (allowed, since O can be in position 5)

This satisfies all constraints.
