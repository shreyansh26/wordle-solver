### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to use a word with 5 unique common letters that can help eliminate many possibilities. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains A, R, O, S, E - five very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This will give us good coverage to start narrowing down the secret word.

Another candidate: “FRISK”

Positions 4 and 5: two new consonants not yet used.

Candidate: R I S _ _
We need two more letters not in {A, O, E, T, P}. Let’s pick common remaining letters: N, D, L, M, C, etc.

Possible words:
- R I S K N (invalid, not a word)
- R I S K Y (valid word: RISKY)

Check constraints:
- Contains S, R, I – yes.
- No A, O, E, T, P – yes.
- S is in position 3 (allowed).
- R is in position 1 (allowed).
- I is in position 2 (allowed).

This seems valid.

From the new feedback on RISKY:
- R(✓) – R is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- I(✓) – I is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- S(✓) – S is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- K(✓) – K is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- Y(x) – Y is NOT in the word.

So we now know the exact pattern:
Position 1: R
Position 2: I
Position 3: S
Position 4: K
Position 5: ?

We need a 5-letter word that starts with RISK and ends with a letter that is NOT A, O, E, T, P, or Y (from previous exclusions). The remaining letters that have not been ruled out and are common: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, V, W, etc.

Possible endings for RISK_:
- RISK B → RISK B (not a word)
- RISK C → RISK C (not a word)
- RISK D → RISK D (not a word)
- RISK E → E is excluded
- RISK F → RISK F (not a word)
- RISK G → RISK G (not a word)
- RISK H → RISK H (not a word)
- RISK L → RISK L (not a word)
- RISK M → RISK M (not a word)
- RISK N → RISK N (not a word)
- RISK S → RISK S (not a word)
- RISK T → T is excluded
- RISK Y → Y is excluded

Wait, none of these seem to form valid English words. Let me think of actual words that start with RISK:
- RISKY (already tried, Y is excluded)
- RISKS (plural of risk, ends with S)
- RISKS is a valid word. Let's check:
  - Ends with S, which hasn't been excluded yet (only A, O, E, T, P, Y are excluded). S was only excluded from positions 1 and 4 before, but here it's in position 5, which is allowed.

So RISKS seems to fit all constraints:
- Starts with RISK (confirmed by ✓ on each letter)
- Ends with S (not in any excluded set for position 5)
- No excluded letters elsewhere.

Therefore, the next logical guess is RISKS.
