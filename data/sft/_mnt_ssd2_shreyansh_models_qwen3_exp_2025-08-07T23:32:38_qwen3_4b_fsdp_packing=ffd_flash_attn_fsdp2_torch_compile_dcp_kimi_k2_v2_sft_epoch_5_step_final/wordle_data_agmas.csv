1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E - good mix of consonants and vowels.
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E - also strong.
- ""AROSE"" has A, R, O, S, E - very common letters.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), giving me good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word and in the correct first position.
- R, O, E are NOT in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 4th).

So the secret word looks like: A _ _ _ S

3. Uses new common consonants to test more letters

- A S _ _ _ : but S can't be 4th, so AS _ _ _ would work
- A _ S _ _ : but S can't be 4th, so A _ S _ _ would work
- A _ _ S _ : this would put S in 4th position, which is invalid
- A _ _ _ S : this would put S in 5th position, which is valid

Let's try ""ASIDE"":

- S is in 2nd position (not 4th, so valid)
- Uses I and D as new letters
- Doesn't use R, O, E

This should help test the 2nd position for S and give info on I and D.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants.

From the three guesses we now know:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
2. ASIDE → A(✓) S(-) I(x) D(x) E(x)
3. AUSTY → A(✓) U(x) S(-) T(x) Y(x)

Consolidated facts:
- First letter is A.
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from ASIDE and AUSTY).  
  Therefore S must be in position 5.
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E, I, D, U, T, Y.

So the pattern is: A _ _ _ S

We still need three more letters, none of which can be any of R, O, E, I, D, U, T, Y.

Remaining common letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, V, W, X, Z.

Let’s pick three consonants that form a common 5-letter word ending in S.

Candidate consonant triplets:
- B, L, N → “ABLES” (but E is excluded)
- C, H, N → “ACHNS” (not a word)
- L, N, G → “ALGNS” (not a word)
- N, L, K → “ANLKS” (not a word)
- C, L, N → “ACNS_” (no)
- B, L, K → “ABLEK” (no)
- N, E, V → “ANEV_” (no, E excluded)
- N, G, L → “ANGEL” (but E excluded)
- N, K, L → “ANKLS” (no)
- N, L, M → “ANLMS” (no)
- C, L, A → “ACLAS” (no)
- N, E, T → “ANETS” (no, E, T excluded)
- N, E, V → “ANEV_” (no)
- N, E, R → “ANERS” (no, E, R excluded)
- N, E, L → “ANELS” (no, E excluded)
- N, E, C → “ANEC_” (no)
- N, E, D → “ANED_” (no, E, D excluded)
- N, E, G → “ANEG_” (no, E excluded)
- N, E, K → “ANEK_” (no, E excluded)
- N, E, L → “ANELS” (no, E excluded)
- N, E, M → “ANEM_” (no, E excluded)
- N, E, P → “ANEP_” (no, E excluded)
- N, E, V → “ANEV_” (no, E excluded)
- N, E, W → “ANEW_” (no, E excluded)
- N, E, X → “ANEX_” (no, E excluded)
- N, E, Z → “ANEX_” (no, E excluded)
- N, E, S → “ANES_” (no, E excluded)

Wait, let’s list all letters still allowed: A, S, plus any letters not in {R, O, E, I, D, U, T, Y}.  
So allowed letters: A, S, B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, V, W, X, Z.

We need three consonants for positions 2, 3, 4 such that the word A _ _ _ S is valid.

I’m not finding any valid words. Let me relax: the letters allowed are A, S, B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, V, W, X, Z. I need three consonants for positions 2, 3, 4.

Let me list all possible combinations and see which forms a word:

Possible consonant triplets (positions 2-4):
- B, L, N → “ABLES” (E excluded)
- C, H, N → “ACHNS” (not a word)
- L, N, G → “ALGNS” (no)
- N, L, K → “ANLKS” (no)
- C, L, N → “ACNLS” (no)
- B, L, K → “ABLEK” (no)
- N, G, L → “ANGEL” (E excluded)
- N, K, L → “ANKLS” (no)
- N, L, M → “ANLMS” (no)
- C, L, M → “ACLM_” (no)
- B, L, M → “ABLEM” (no)
- N, L, P → “ANLPS” (no)
- N, P, L → “ANPLS” (no)
- N, L, V → “ANLVS” (no)
- N, V, L → “ANVLS” (no)
- N, L, W → “ANLWS” (no)
- N, W, L → “ANWLS” (no)
- N, L, X → “ANLXS” (no)
- N, X, L → “ANXLS” (no)
- N, L, Z → “ANLZS” (no)
- N, Z, L → “ANZLS” (no)
- C, H, L → “ACHLS” (no)
- C, L, H → “ACLHS” (no)
- H, C, L → “HCLAS” (no)
- H, L, C → “HLCAS” (no)
- L, C, H → “LCHAS” (no)
- L, H, C → “LHCAS” (no)
- C, N, L → “CNALS” (no)
- C, L, N → “CLANS” (valid word!)

“CLANS” is a valid 5-letter word:
- C (position 2)
- L (position 3)
- A (position 4) – but A is already in position 1. Is this allowed? Yes, letters can repeat if the word has them.

But wait, A is already used in position 1, and we haven’t tested A in position 4 yet. However, we know A is only in position 1 from the first feedback, so position 4 cannot be A. So “CLANS” is invalid because it repeats A.

Next valid word: “PLANS”
- P, L, A, N, S
- A is in position 4, but we know A is only in position 1, so this is invalid.

Next: “FLANS”
- F, L, A, N, S
- Again A in position 4 is invalid.

Next: “GLANS”
- G, L, A, N, S
- A in position 4 invalid.

Next: “BLANS”
- B, L, A, N, S
- A in position 4 invalid.

Next: “CLAPS”
- C, L, A, P, S
- A in position 3 invalid.

Next: “CLASH”
- C, L, A, S, H
- A in position 3 invalid.

Next: “CLAST”
- C, L, A, S, T
- A in position 3 invalid, T excluded.

Next: “CLAYS”
- C, L, A, Y, S
- Y is excluded.

Next: “CLASH” already considered.

Next: “BLAST” – T excluded.

Next: “PLANS” – A in position 3 invalid.

Next: “FLANS” – A in position 3 invalid.

Next: “GLANS” – A in position 3 invalid.

Next: “SLANG” – S in position 1, but we know S is in position 5.

Next: “SCALP” – doesn’t end with S.

Next: “SCANS” – A in position 3 invalid.

Next: “SCALY” – Y excluded.

Next: “SCALD” – D excluded.

Next: “SCALP” – no.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E - good mix of consonants and vowels.
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E - also strong.
- ""AROSE"" has A, R, O, S, E - very common letters.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), giving me good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word and in the correct first position.
- R, O, E are NOT in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 4th).

So the secret word looks like: A _ _ _ S

Letters we know are NOT in the word: R, O, E  
Letters we know ARE in the word: A (1st), S (somewhere except 4th)

Next I want a word that:
1. Starts with A
2. Contains S but not in the 4th position
3. Uses new common consonants to test more letters

Good candidates:
- A S _ _ _ : but S can't be 4th, so AS _ _ _ would work
- A _ S _ _ : but S can't be 4th, so A _ S _ _ would work
- A _ _ S _ : this would put S in 4th position, which is invalid
- A _ _ _ S : this would put S in 5th position, which is valid

Let's try ""ASIDE"":
- Starts with A
- S is in 2nd position (not 4th, so valid)
- Uses I and D as new letters
- Doesn't use R, O, E

This should help test the 2nd position for S and give info on I and D.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: ASIDE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) S(-) I(x) D(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is correct in 1st position.
   - S is in the word but NOT in 4th position.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.

2. ASIDE → A(✓) S(-) I(x) D(x) E(x)
   - A is correct in 1st position.
   - S is in the word but NOT in 2nd position.
   - I and D are not in the word.
   - E is already known not to be in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: A _ _ _ _
- Letters in the word: A (1st), S (somewhere, but not 2nd or 4th)
- Letters not in the word: R, O, E, I, D

Possible positions for S: 3rd or 5th.

Let’s test S in 3rd position next. A common consonant cluster around the 3rd letter is helpful. We also want to test new consonants (like T, N, L, etc.) and the remaining vowels (U, Y).

Candidate word: A S T _ _ → “ASTON” or “ASTRY” (but R is excluded).  
Another candidate: A S T O N → but O is excluded.  
“ASTYR” → R excluded.  
“ASUNT” → less common.

Instead, let’s try “AUSTY”:
- A in 1st (correct).
- S in 3rd (testing new position).
- Uses U and T (new letters).
- Y is a vowel-like letter that appears in many words.

This seems like a balanced next guess.

From all feedback so far:

- A is locked in position 1: A _ _ _ _
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from ASIDE and AUSTY).  
  Therefore S must be in position 5: A _ _ _ S
- Letters known NOT to appear anywhere: R, O, E, I, D, U, T, Y

Remaining unused common consonants: N, L, C, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.
Remaining unused vowels: only A and S are confirmed; E, I, O, U are out, so no other vowels left.

We need a 5-letter word of the form A _ _ _ S using only letters not yet excluded.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E - good mix of consonants and vowels.
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E - also strong.
- ""AROSE"" has A, R, O, S, E - very common letters.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), giving me good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word and in the correct first position.
- R, O, E are NOT in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 4th).

So the secret word looks like: A _ _ _ S

Letters we know are NOT in the word: R, O, E  
Letters we know ARE in the word: A (1st), S (somewhere except 4th)

Next I want a word that:
1. Starts with A
2. Contains S but not in the 4th position
3. Uses new common consonants to test more letters

Good candidates:
- A S _ _ _ : but S can't be 4th, so AS _ _ _ would work
- A _ S _ _ : but S can't be 4th, so A _ S _ _ would work
- A _ _ S _ : this would put S in 4th position, which is invalid
- A _ _ _ S : this would put S in 5th position, which is valid

Let's try ""ASIDE"":
- Starts with A
- S is in 2nd position (not 4th, so valid)
- Uses I and D as new letters
- Doesn't use R, O, E

This should help test the 2nd position for S and give info on I and D.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: ASIDE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) S(-) I(x) D(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is correct in 1st position.
   - S is in the word but NOT in 4th position.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.

2. ASIDE → A(✓) S(-) I(x) D(x) E(x)
   - A is correct in 1st position.
   - S is in the word but NOT in 2nd position.
   - I and D are not in the word.
   - E is already known not to be in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: A _ _ _ _
- Letters in the word: A (1st), S (somewhere, but not 2nd or 4th)
- Letters not in the word: R, O, E, I, D

Possible positions for S: 3rd or 5th.

Let’s test S in 3rd position next. A common consonant cluster around the 3rd letter is helpful. We also want to test new consonants (like T, N, L, etc.) and the remaining vowels (U, Y).

Candidate word: A S T _ _ → “ASTON” or “ASTRY” (but R is excluded).  
Another candidate: A S T O N → but O is excluded.  
“ASTYR” → R excluded.  
“ASUNT” → less common.

Instead, let’s try “AUSTY”:
- A in 1st (correct).
- S in 3rd (testing new position).
- Uses U and T (new letters).
- Y is a vowel-like letter that appears in many words.

This seems like a balanced next guess.

2. Forbidden letters so far: R, O, E, I, D, U, T, Y
3. Letters still allowed (besides A and S): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a real 5-letter word of the form A _ _ _ S using only those letters.

Candidate words:
- A B B S → “ABBAS” (6 letters)
- A C C S → “ACCAS” (invalid)
- A C L S → “ACLS” (invalid)
- A C N S → “ACNS” (invalid)
- A C K S → “ACKS” (invalid)
- A C H S → “ACHS” (invalid)

- A L N S → “ALNS” (invalid)
- A L C S → “ALCS” (invalid)
- A L K S → “ALKS” (invalid)

Check “ALMS”:

- Uses L and M (both allowed)
- No forbidden letters

This fits perfectly.
