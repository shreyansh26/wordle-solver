For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Common choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" uses S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters.
- ""CRANE"" uses C, R, A, N, E - also excellent coverage.
- ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E - good coverage.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three of the five most common letters (E, A, R) and two others (O, S) that are also very common, giving us good information about multiple letters at once.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (not 3rd).
- S is not in the word at all.
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: R, S, E
- Letters that must appear somewhere: A, O
- Positions ruled out: A cannot be 1st, O cannot be 3rd.

A good next guess should:
1. Include A and O in new positions.
2. Introduce new common letters (T, N, L, I, C, etc.) to test.
3. Avoid R, S, E.

Possible candidates:
- TONAL (T, O, N, A, L) - O is 2nd, A is 4th, introduces T, N, L
- COBIA (C, O, B, I, A) - but B is less common
- PLANT (P, L, A, N, T) - but lacks O
- TALON (T, A, L, O, N) - A is 2nd, O is 4th, introduces T, L, N

- Positions ruled out:

  - N cannot be 5 → must be 1, 3, or 4.

Possible positions:
- If O is 1st: O A _ _ _
  - N must be 3 or 4 (cannot be 5).
- If O is 5th: _ A _ _ O
  - N must be 1, 3, or 4 (but 1 is open to new letters).

Let’s explore the O-1st option first:
O A _ _ _
- N must be 3 or 4.
- Remaining letters (from unused common ones): C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.
- Need two more letters that are not excluded.

- OAMEN → but M and E (E excluded).
- OANED → E excluded.
- OANIL → but L excluded.
- OANIC → C is allowed.
- OANIM → M is allowed.

OANIC fits: O(1), A(2), N(3), I(4), C(5). All letters allowed, no exclusions violated.

Another candidate: OAKID → but K and D are allowed, but we already have OANIC.

Let me check O-5th option too:
_ A _ _ O
- N must be 1, 3, or 4.
- N1: N A _ _ O
  - Need letters 3,4 from allowed set.
  - Examples: NABCO, NAGMO, NADJO (but J is rare), NAPPO (double P), etc.
- N3: _ A N _ O
  - Examples: CANOP, MANOR (but R excluded), PANOR (R excluded), VANON (double N), etc.
- N4: _ A _ N O
  - Examples: CANNY (Y is allowed), BANNY (B allowed), DANNY (D allowed).

CANNY is a good word: C, A, N, N, Y. But N is repeated, and we don't know if N can repeat. The original word is 5-letter, no info on repeats.

OANIC seems safer with unique letters.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Common choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" uses S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters.
- ""CRANE"" uses C, R, A, N, E - also excellent coverage.
- ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E - good coverage.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three of the five most common letters (E, A, R) and two others (O, S) that are also very common, giving us good information about multiple letters at once.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, S, E are not in the word.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.

2. TALON → T(x) A(✓) L(x) O(-) N(-)
   - A is now confirmed in position 2.
   - T, L are not in the word.
   - O is in the word but not in position 4.
   - N is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ A _ _ _
- Letters to include: A (fixed at 2), O, N
- Letters to exclude: R, S, E, T, L
- Positions ruled out:
  - O cannot be 3 or 4 → must be 1 or 5.
  - N cannot be 5 → must be 1, 3, or 4.

Possible positions:
- If O is 1st: O A _ _ _
  - N must be 3 or 4 (cannot be 5).
- If O is 5th: _ A _ _ O
  - N must be 1, 3, or 4 (but 1 is open to new letters).

Let’s explore the O-1st option first:
O A _ _ _
- N must be 3 or 4.
- Remaining letters (from unused common ones): C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.
- Need two more letters that are not excluded.

Candidate words:
- OAKEN → but E is excluded.
- OAMEN → but M and E (E excluded).
- OANED → E excluded.
- OANIL → but L excluded.
- OANIC → C is allowed.
- OANIM → M is allowed.

OANIC fits: O(1), A(2), N(3), I(4), C(5). All letters allowed, no exclusions violated.

Another candidate: OAKID → but K and D are allowed, but we already have OANIC.

Let me check O-5th option too:
_ A _ _ O
- N must be 1, 3, or 4.
- N1: N A _ _ O
  - Need letters 3,4 from allowed set.
  - Examples: NABCO, NAGMO, NADJO (but J is rare), NAPPO (double P), etc.
- N3: _ A N _ O
  - Examples: CANOP, MANOR (but R excluded), PANOR (R excluded), VANON (double N), etc.
- N4: _ A _ N O
  - Examples: CANNY (Y is allowed), BANNY (B allowed), DANNY (D allowed).

CANNY is a good word: C, A, N, N, Y. But N is repeated, and we don't know if N can repeat. The original word is 5-letter, no info on repeats.

OANIC seems safer with unique letters.

Final choice: OANIC

Current known pattern:
- Position 2: A

- O must appear somewhere, but cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4 → the only remaining spot is position 5.
- So the word must be: _ A N _ O

Letters to exclude: R, S, E, T, L, I, C
Allowed letters (common ones left): B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a letter for position 1 and 4 that are not excluded.
Possible candidates:
- BANJO (J is allowed, but O is already at 5)
- MANGO (G allowed)
- PANDO (D allowed)
- HANNO (H allowed, but N is already at 3)
- WANNO (W allowed)
- BANCO (C excluded)
- DANGO (G allowed)

The best common word seems ""MANGO"" (M, A, N, G, O). But we need to check if M and G are allowed - yes, they're not excluded.

Another good option is ""PANDO"" (P, A, N, D, O) - but PANDO is less common.

""MANGO"" is a valid 5-letter word and fits all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Common choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" uses S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters.
- ""CRANE"" uses C, R, A, N, E - also excellent coverage.
- ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E - good coverage.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three of the five most common letters (E, A, R) and two others (O, S) that are also very common, giving us good information about multiple letters at once.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (not 3rd).
- S is not in the word at all.
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: R, S, E
- Letters that must appear somewhere: A, O
- Positions ruled out: A cannot be 1st, O cannot be 3rd.

A good next guess should:
1. Include A and O in new positions.
2. Introduce new common letters (T, N, L, I, C, etc.) to test.
3. Avoid R, S, E.

Possible candidates:
- TONAL (T, O, N, A, L) - O is 2nd, A is 4th, introduces T, N, L
- COBIA (C, O, B, I, A) - but B is less common
- PLANT (P, L, A, N, T) - but lacks O
- TALON (T, A, L, O, N) - A is 2nd, O is 4th, introduces T, L, N

I'll choose TALON as it tests A in 2nd and O in 4th, plus common letters T, L, N.

From the feedback:

- A is fixed in position 2.
- N is fixed in position 3.
- O is fixed in position 5.
- Letters excluded so far: R, S, E, T, L, I, C, M, G.

So the pattern is: _ A N _ O

Remaining allowed letters (common ones): B, D, F, H, K, P, U, V, W, Y.

Positions 1 and 4 need to be filled with two different letters from the allowed set.

Possible combinations:

- V A N D O → VANDO (valid word)
- W A N D O → WANDO (valid word)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Common choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" uses S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters.
- ""CRANE"" uses C, R, A, N, E - also excellent coverage.
- ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E - good coverage.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three of the five most common letters (E, A, R) and two others (O, S) that are also very common, giving us good information about multiple letters at once.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (not 3rd).
- S is not in the word at all.
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: R, S, E
- Letters that must appear somewhere: A, O
- Positions ruled out: A cannot be 1st, O cannot be 3rd.

A good next guess should:
1. Include A and O in new positions.
2. Introduce new common letters (T, N, L, I, C, etc.) to test.
3. Avoid R, S, E.

Possible candidates:
- TONAL (T, O, N, A, L) - O is 2nd, A is 4th, introduces T, N, L
- COBIA (C, O, B, I, A) - but B is less common
- PLANT (P, L, A, N, T) - but lacks O
- TALON (T, A, L, O, N) - A is 2nd, O is 4th, introduces T, L, N

I'll choose TALON as it tests A in 2nd and O in 4th, plus common letters T, L, N.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, S, E are not in the word.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.

2. TALON → T(x) A(✓) L(x) O(-) N(-)
   - A is now confirmed in position 2.
   - T, L are not in the word.
   - O is in the word but not in position 4.
   - N is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ A _ _ _
- Letters to include: A (fixed at 2), O, N
- Letters to exclude: R, S, E, T, L
- Positions ruled out:
  - O cannot be 3 or 4 → must be 1 or 5.
  - N cannot be 5 → must be 1, 3, or 4.

Possible positions:
- If O is 1st: O A _ _ _
  - N must be 3 or 4 (cannot be 5).
- If O is 5th: _ A _ _ O
  - N must be 1, 3, or 4 (but 1 is open to new letters).

Let’s explore the O-1st option first:
O A _ _ _
- N must be 3 or 4.
- Remaining letters (from unused common ones): C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.
- Need two more letters that are not excluded.

Candidate words:
- OAKEN → but E is excluded.
- OAMEN → but M and E (E excluded).
- OANED → E excluded.
- OANIL → but L excluded.
- OANIC → C is allowed.
- OANIM → M is allowed.

OANIC fits: O(1), A(2), N(3), I(4), C(5). All letters allowed, no exclusions violated.

Another candidate: OAKID → but K and D are allowed, but we already have OANIC.

Let me check O-5th option too:
_ A _ _ O
- N must be 1, 3, or 4.
- N1: N A _ _ O
  - Need letters 3,4 from allowed set.
  - Examples: NABCO, NAGMO, NADJO (but J is rare), NAPPO (double P), etc.
- N3: _ A N _ O
  - Examples: CANOP, MANOR (but R excluded), PANOR (R excluded), VANON (double N), etc.
- N4: _ A _ N O
  - Examples: CANNY (Y is allowed), BANNY (B allowed), DANNY (D allowed).

CANNY is a good word: C, A, N, N, Y. But N is repeated, and we don't know if N can repeat. The original word is 5-letter, no info on repeats.

OANIC seems safer with unique letters.

Final choice: OANIC

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)

   - R, S, E are not in the word.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.

   - A is confirmed in position 2.
   - T, L are not in the word.
   - O is in the word but not in position 4.
   - N is in the word but not in position 5.

3. OANIC → O(-) A(✓) N(✓) I(x) C(x)
   - A is confirmed in position 2.
   - N is confirmed in position 3.
   - O is in the word but not in position 1.
   - I, C are not in the word.

Current known pattern:
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: N
- O must appear somewhere, but cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4 → the only remaining spot is position 5.
- So the word must be: _ A N _ O

Letters to exclude: R, S, E, T, L, I, C
Allowed letters (common ones left): B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a letter for position 1 and 4 that are not excluded.
Possible candidates:
- BANJO (J is allowed, but O is already at 5)
- MANGO (G allowed)
- PANDO (D allowed)
- HANNO (H allowed, but N is already at 3)
- WANNO (W allowed)
- BANCO (C excluded)
- DANGO (G allowed)

The best common word seems ""MANGO"" (M, A, N, G, O). But we need to check if M and G are allowed - yes, they're not excluded.

Another good option is ""PANDO"" (P, A, N, D, O) - but PANDO is less common.

""MANGO"" is a valid 5-letter word and fits all constraints.

- Letters excluded: R, S, E, T, L, I, C, M, G, B, D

Remaining allowed letters: F, H, K, P, U, V, W, Y

The most common and likely word here is ""HANKO"" or ""PANKO"". Between these, ""HANKO"" is more recognized.

However, ""PANKO"" is also valid. 

Given the constraints, ""HANKO"" seems the best choice.
