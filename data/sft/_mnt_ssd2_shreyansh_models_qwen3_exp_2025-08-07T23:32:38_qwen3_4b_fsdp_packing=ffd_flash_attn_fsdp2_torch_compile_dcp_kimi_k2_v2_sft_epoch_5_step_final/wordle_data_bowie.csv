### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to maximize information gain. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of the alphabet's most frequent letters, which should help us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

The feedback indicates that ""DOPE"" and ""HOPE"" are not valid 5-letter words in the game's dictionary. This is unusual because ""DOPE"" and ""HOPE"" are both legitimate 5-letter words. However, it's possible that the game's dictionary has specific constraints or that there was an error in formatting.

- The word ends in E (from AROSE feedback: E(✓)).
- It contains O but not in position 3 (from AROSE feedback: O(-)).
- It does NOT contain A, R, or S (from AROSE feedback: A(x), R(x), S(x)).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to maximize information gain. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of the alphabet's most frequent letters, which should help us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- O: in the word but wrong position (-)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word and in the correct position (✓)

So we know:
1. The word ends in E.
2. It contains O somewhere, but not in position 3.
3. It does NOT contain A, R, or S.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing O (not in the 3rd position), and avoiding A, R, S.

Possible patterns: _ _ _ O E or _ _ O _ E or _ O _ _ E, etc., but O cannot be 3rd.

Let’s brainstorm:
- Words ending in E with O: ""DOPE"", ""HOPE"", ""LOVE"", ""MOVE"", ""POPE"", ""TOPE"", ""VOLE"", ""WROTE"", ""WRITE"" (but R is excluded), etc.

From these, ""DOPE"" seems good:
- D, O, P, E – no A, R, S.
- O is in position 2 (allowed).
- Ends in E (matches).

Another candidate: ""HOPE"" – same letters, O in position 2.

""LOVE"" – O in position 2.

""MOVE"" – O in position 2.

""POPE"" – O in position 2.

""VOLE"" – O in position 2.

""WRITE"" – contains R (excluded).

""DOPE"" seems solid. Let’s go with that.

The feedback says ""Model answer is not five letters,"" which means DOPE is not a valid 5-letter word in the game's dictionary. I need to choose another 5-letter word that ends in E, contains O (but not in position 3), and avoids A, R, S.

Possible 5-letter words ending in E with O (not in position 3):
- ""OCEAN"" – but ends in N, not E.
- ""HOPE"" – H O P E – ends in E, O in position 2.
- ""LOVE"" – L O V E – ends in E, O in position 2.
- ""MOUSE"" – ends in E, but no O.
- ""POKE"" – ends in E, O in position 2.
- ""TOKE"" – ends in E, O in position 2.
- ""VOLE"" – ends in E, O in position 2.

""HOPE"" seems like a strong candidate:
- H, O, P, E – no A, R, S.
- O is in position 2 (allowed).
- Ends in E (matches).

Let's go with HOPE.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: DOPE -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 3: HOPE -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The feedback indicates that ""DOPE"" and ""HOPE"" are not valid 5-letter words in the game's dictionary. This is unusual because ""DOPE"" and ""HOPE"" are both legitimate 5-letter words. However, it's possible that the game's dictionary has specific constraints or that there was an error in formatting.

Given the constraints from the first guess:
- The word ends in E (from AROSE feedback: E(✓)).
- It contains O but not in position 3 (from AROSE feedback: O(-)).
- It does NOT contain A, R, or S (from AROSE feedback: A(x), R(x), S(x)).

Possible patterns for a 5-letter word ending in E with O (not in position 3):
- _ _ _ O E
- _ _ O _ E
- _ O _ _ E
- O _ _ _ E

Looking for words that fit these patterns and avoid A, R, S:
- ""OCEAN"" – ends in N, not E.
- ""LOVE"" – L O V E (ends in E, O in position 2).
- ""MOVE"" – M O V E (ends in E, O in position 2).
- ""POKE"" – P O K E (ends in E, O in position 2).
- ""VOLE"" – V O L E (ends in E, O in position 2).
- ""DOPE"" – already rejected.
- ""HOPE"" – already rejected.

""LOVE"" seems like the best next guess because:
- L, O, V, E – no A, R, S.
- O is in position 2 (allowed).
- Ends in E (matches).

Let's go with LOVE.

Guess 3: HOPE -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 4: LOVE -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The feedback so far:
- E is the last letter (from AROSE).
- O is in the word but not in position 3 (from AROSE).
- A, R, S are not in the word (from AROSE).
- DOPE, HOPE, LOVE are not valid 5-letter words in the game's dictionary (even though they are real words).

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that contains O (not in position 3) and avoids A, R, S.

Possible patterns:
- _ _ _ O E
- _ _ O _ E
- _ O _ _ E
- O _ _ _ E

Looking for valid words:
- ""OCEAN"" – ends in N, not E.
- ""MOUSE"" – ends in E but no O.
- ""POKE"" – ends in E, O in position 2.
- ""VOLE"" – ends in E, O in position 2.
- ""DOPE"", ""HOPE"", ""LOVE"" already rejected.

""POKE"" and ""VOLE"" fit, but let's check:
- POKE: P O K E – O is in position 2 (allowed), ends in E, no A/R/S.
- VOLE: V O L E – same reasoning.

Between these, ""POKE"" uses P, K which haven't been tested yet. Let's try POKE.

So far we know:
- The word ends in E (from AROSE: E✓)
- It contains O, but O is NOT in position 3 (from AROSE: O-)
- It does NOT contain A, R, S (from AROSE: A(x) R(x) S(x))
- DOPE, HOPE, LOVE, POKE are all invalid 5-letter words in the game’s dictionary (even though they are real words).

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
1. Ends in E.
2. Contains O, but O is not in position 3.
3. Uses only letters not yet eliminated (so no A, R, S).

Valid patterns for a 5-letter word ending in E:
- _ _ _ O E
- _ _ O _ E
- _ O _ _ E
- O _ _ _ E

Real words that fit these patterns and avoid A, R, S:
- ""MOUSE"" – ends in E but has no O.
- ""OCEAN"" – ends in N, not E.
- ""VOILE"" – ends in E, O in position 2.
- ""COBIE"" – ends in E, O in position 2.
- ""FOGIE"" – ends in E, O in position 2.
- ""GOLEM"" – ends in M, not E.
- ""BOGIE"" – ends in E, O in position 2.

""VOILE"" is a valid 5-letter word ending in E, contains O in position 2 (allowed), and avoids A, R, S.
