### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are not in the word at all (x).
- S is in the word but not in position 4 (-).

So we know:
1. The word contains an S, but S is NOT in position 4.
2. The letters A, R, O, E are excluded.
3. We still need to test other common consonants and vowels.

Good remaining consonants to test: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.
Good remaining vowels to test: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

A balanced second guess should use new common letters while respecting the S constraint. The word ""STUMP"" uses:
- S in position 1 (allowed, since S is only excluded from position 4)
- T, U, M, P are all new letters not yet tested
- It has a vowel (U) and common consonants (S, T, M, P)

This should give us more information about remaining letters and positions.

2. Introduce as many of the still-allowed common letters as possible.

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, U, M, P, I, C  
Letters that ARE in the word (but whose exact positions are still unknown): S, N, K (all marked “-” in the latest guess, so none of them are in their current positions).

Remaining common consonants we haven’t tried: L, D, G, H, B, F, Y, W, V  
Remaining vowels: none left except Y (sometimes vowel-like), but we already know I is out.

We need a 5-letter word that uses only the letters S, N, K plus three other still-allowed consonants, and we must avoid the 10 eliminated letters.  
We also must respect the positional exclusions:
- S is not in position 1 or 4 (from STUMP and SNICK)
- N is not in position 2 (from SNICK)
- K is not in position 5 (from SNICK)

A word that satisfies these constraints and introduces new common consonants is “SWANK”:
- S (position 1) – allowed (only excluded from 1 and 4 in prior guesses, but those exclusions were absolute, so S must be in 2, 3, or 5)
Wait – no, the exclusions were only for the positions we tried so far. Actually, the feedback only tells us S is in the word but not in the positions we tried. We have no evidence that S is excluded from any specific position beyond what we have already tested.

But to be safe and maximize information, let’s pick a word that places S, N, K in new positions and adds two new common consonants.  
Consider “SKUNK”:
- S (position 1) – new placement
- K (position 2) – new placement
- U – already eliminated
Oops, U is out.

Try “SNOWY” – but O is out.

Try “SKYNS” – but Y is sometimes vowel, and we have no info on Y yet.

Actually, let’s use “SKUNK” but skip U – but U is already out.

Wait, let’s list remaining allowed letters: S, N, K, L, D, G, H, B, F, Y, W, V.

We need a word that uses S, N, K plus two others.  
“SKUNK” is invalid (U out).

“SKYNS” – uses S, K, Y, N, S – but S repeats, and we have no info on Y.

“SWINK” – but W is allowed, I is out.

“SLUNK” – L, U, N, K – but U is out.

“SKELD” – but E is out.

“SKAND” – A is out.

“SKYN” – too short.

“SKYNS” – as above.

“SKYNS” is 5 letters: S, K, Y, N, S – but double S, and Y is untested.

But we have no info on Y yet. Let’s try “SKYNS”.

But let’s pick a word that avoids repeats and uses two new consonants.  
“SKYN” is 4 letters.

“SKELD” – E is out.

“SKAND” – A is out.

“SKUNK” – U is out.

“SKYNS” – seems best among options.

But let’s pick a word that is more common and uses valid letters.  
“SKYNS” is obscure.

Alternative: “SKELD” – E is out.

“SKELD” is invalid.

“SKELD” – invalid.

Let’s try “SLYNS” – but L, Y, N, S – but S is repeated.

Actually, let’s try “SLYNS” – but S is repeated.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are not in the word at all (x).
- S is in the word but not in position 4 (-).

So we know:
1. The word contains an S, but S is NOT in position 4.
2. The letters A, R, O, E are excluded.
3. We still need to test other common consonants and vowels.

Good remaining consonants to test: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.
Good remaining vowels to test: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

A balanced second guess should use new common letters while respecting the S constraint. The word ""STUMP"" uses:
- S in position 1 (allowed, since S is only excluded from position 4)
- T, U, M, P are all new letters not yet tested
- It has a vowel (U) and common consonants (S, T, M, P)

This should give us more information about remaining letters and positions.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, E, T, U, M, P  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: S (because both guesses placed S in a position marked “-”, so S is somewhere else).

Remaining common consonants not yet tried: N, L, C, D, G, H, B, F, K, Y, W, V, etc.  
Remaining vowels not yet tried: I (only vowel left that hasn’t been ruled out).

A good next guess should:
1. Re-use the known letter S in a new position.
2. Introduce as many of the still-allowed common letters as possible.
3. Avoid any of the already-eliminated letters.

Let’s try a word that places S in position 2 and uses three new common consonants plus the vowel I.  
“SNICK” uses:
- S in position 2 (new placement)
- N, C, K (all new letters)
- I (the only remaining vowel)

This maximizes information gain while respecting the constraints.

From all feedback so far:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, E, T, U, M, P, I, C  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: S, N, K (all marked “-”, so they appear somewhere else)

So the secret word is made up of the letters {S, N, K} plus two other letters we have not yet tried.  
Remaining common consonants not yet eliminated: D, L, G, H, B, F, Y, W, V  
Remaining vowels not yet eliminated: none left (only I was left, and it was ruled out).

Therefore, we need two more letters from the still-allowed set.  
A good next guess should:
- Re-use S, N, K in new positions.
- Add two new, common, still-allowed letters.

Let’s try “SWINK”:
- S, W, I, N, K
- I is already ruled out (from SNICK feedback), so this is invalid.

Try “SLYNG”:
- S, L, Y, N, G
- All letters are allowed and we haven’t tested L, Y, G yet.

Positions to test:
- S in position 1 (new placement)
- L, Y, N, G all new letters

This gives maximal information.

Current state:
- Letters confirmed to be in the word: S, N, K (all marked “-” in previous guesses, so they appear somewhere else)
- Letters confirmed NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, U, M, P, I, C, L, G
- Remaining common letters not yet tried: D, H, B, F, W, V, Y (but Y already appeared in SLYNG and was marked “-” so Y is in the word but not in position 4)

So the word must contain S, N, K, Y (each in a different position than before) and one more letter from the still-allowed set. The only remaining common letters are D, H, B, F, W, V.

Let’s place:
- S cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4 (from guesses AROSE, STUMP, SNICK, SLYNG). So S must be in 3 or 5.
- N cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4 (from SNICK, SLYNG). So N must be in 1 or 5.
- K cannot be in position 5 (from SNICK). So K must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- Y cannot be in position 4 (from SLYNG). So Y must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Let’s try a word that places these letters in new positions and adds a new common letter. A good candidate is “SKYND” (but D hasn’t been tried yet). However, we need to check positions:

SKYND:
- S in 1 (but S cannot be in 1 from STUMP feedback) → invalid.

Try “NSKYD”:
- N in 1 (allowed), S in 2 (allowed), K in 3 (allowed), Y in 4 (but Y cannot be in 4) → invalid.

Try “YSKND”:
- Y in 1 (allowed), S in 2 (allowed), K in 3 (allowed), N in 4 (allowed), D in 5 (new letter) → valid positions.

This uses S, N, K, Y in new positions and introduces D.
