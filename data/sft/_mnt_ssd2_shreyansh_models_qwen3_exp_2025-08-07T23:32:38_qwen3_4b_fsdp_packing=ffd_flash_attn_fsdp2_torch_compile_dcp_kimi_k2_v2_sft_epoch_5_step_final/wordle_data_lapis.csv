For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N, D. A good starting word should have a mix of these letters to test multiple possibilities.

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it's a strong starting word that includes common consonants (C, R, N) and the most common vowel (A, E).

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, N, E are NOT in the word at all (x).
- A is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position (-).

So we now know:
1. The word contains the letter A, but not in position 3.
2. The letters C, R, N, E are excluded entirely.
3. The remaining letters to consider are: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next step is to test a new set of common letters that don’t include C, R, N, E. Since A must appear somewhere else, let’s try a word that places A in a different position and includes other high-frequency consonants and vowels. 

Possible candidates:
- STOAL (but O and L are good, S and T are common)
- SALTY (but Y is less common)
- PLANT (but N is excluded)
- GAMUT (G, M, U, T)

""STOAL"" seems good because it uses S, T, O, A, L – all common letters not yet tested, and moves A to position 4.

But wait – let’s double-check:
- S, T, O, A, L: none of these are in the excluded set (C, R, N, E).
- A is now in position 4, satisfying the requirement that it’s not in position 3.

Another quick check: ""PLANT"" is out (N is excluded). ""GAMUT"" is valid, but uses G which is less common. ""STOAL"" seems better.

Final choice: STOAL

From the two guesses we have:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
   - Letters NOT in the word: C, R, N, E
   - Letter A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. STOAL → S(-) T(x) O(x) A(-) L(-)
   - Letters NOT in the word: T, O
   - Letter S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - Letter A is in the word but not in position 4 (confirmed earlier that it’s not in 3).
   - Letter L is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Must contain: A, S, L
- Must NOT contain: C, R, N, E, T, O
- A cannot be in positions 3 or 4
- S cannot be in position 1
- L cannot be in position 5

Remaining letters to consider: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus S, L which we know are present.

Let’s list possible positions for A, S, L:
- A can be in positions 1, 2, 5
- S can be in positions 2,3,4,5
- L can be in positions 1,2,3,4

We need to form a valid 5-letter word using these constraints. Let’s try to place A in position 2 (since it can’t be 3 or 4), S in position 3, and L in position 4. That leaves positions 1 and 5 to be filled with remaining letters.

Possible word structure: _ A S L _

Looking for common words fitting this pattern:
- BASAL (but B is allowed, A is already used, S, L are used) – but A is repeated which might be possible
- PASAL (but P is allowed)
- MASAL (M is allowed)
- TASAL (T is excluded)
- BASIL (B, A, S, I, L) – I is allowed and not yet tested
- BASIL seems valid:
  - B (allowed)
  - A (position 2, allowed)
  - S (position 3, allowed)
  - I (allowed)
  - L (position 5, allowed since L can be in 5? Wait, feedback said L is in word but not in position 5. So L cannot be in 5. So BASIL would place L in 5 which is invalid.)

Let’s adjust:
- L cannot be in 5, so possible positions for L: 1,2,3,4
- A cannot be in 3,4, so possible positions: 1,2,5
- S cannot be in 1, so possible positions: 2,3,4,5

Let’s try L in 1, A in 2, S in 3:
Structure: L A S _ _
Need two more letters from remaining (B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z)
Possible word: LASER – but E is excluded
LASER → E is excluded (from CRANE feedback), so invalid.

L A S I _ → LASIK (LASIK is a valid word, K is allowed)
Check constraints:
- L in 1 (allowed)
- A in 2 (allowed)
- S in 3 (allowed)
- I in 4 (allowed)
- K in 5 (allowed)
- No excluded letters (C,R,N,E,T,O)
- All constraints satisfied.

Alternative: L A S _ _ with other letters:
LASPY (not a common word)
LASER (invalid, E excluded)
LASIK seems the best common word.

Another option: _ A _ S L – but L can’t be in 5, so invalid.
A in 5: _ _ _ _ A – but S and L must fit somewhere.

Another structure: _ _ A _ _ with S and L in other positions.
For example: S A L _ _ – but S can’t be in 1, so invalid.
_ S A _ _ – possible: M S A _ _ (but M,S,A are okay)
MSAIL (but I is okay, L in 5 is invalid)

Best seems LASIK.

But let’s check if there’s a simpler word:
B A S I L – but L is in 5 which is invalid (from feedback L is not in 5)
B A S I L → L in 5 → invalid.

Another structure: A _ S _ L – but L in 5 invalid.
A _ _ S _ – possible: A B S I L (L in 5 invalid)
A B S _ _ – A B S I L (invalid)
A B S _ _ – A B S _ _ with L somewhere else:
A B S _ _ – L must be in 3 or 4:
A B S L _ – but S is in 3, L in 4 (allowed), need last letter:
A B S L _ → A B S L _ – but we need 5 letters, so ABSL? No.

Alternative: _ _ _ A S – but A must be in 1,2,5, so 5 is last:
_ _ _ _ A S – but we need 5 letters.

Let’s try L in 2, A in 5:
_ L _ _ A
Need S somewhere (positions 2,3,4,5) – 2 is L, 5 is A, so S in 3 or 4:
_ L S _ A or _ L _ S A

Possible word: B L S _ A – but B,L,S,A are allowed, need 5th letter:
B L S I A – not a word
B L U S A – not a word

Another: F L U S A – not a word.

Let’s try L in 3, A in 2:
_ A L _ _
Need S in 2,4,5 (but 2 is A), so S in 4 or 5:
_ A L S _ or _ A L _ S

Possible word: M A L S _ – but M,A,L,S are allowed, need 5th letter:
M A L S _ – MALSA (not a word)
M A L S Y – MALSY (valid word, but Y is less common)

Another: B A L S Y – BALSY (not common)
G A L S Y – GALS? No.

Let’s try L in 4, A in 1:
A _ _ L _
Need S in 2,3,5:
A S _ L _ or A _ S L _

Possible word: A S I L _ – need 5th letter:
A S I L _ – ASIL_ (ASILK? not a word)
A S I L D – ASILD (not a word)

Another: A _ S L _ – A B S L _ – ABSL? No.

Let’s try A in 5:
_ _ _ _ A
Need S and L in other positions:
S in 2,3,4
L in 1,2,3,4

Possible word: B L A S A – BLASA (not a word)
B L A S _ – BLAS_ (BLAS? No)
S L A B A – SLABA (not a word)

Best valid word seems LASIK.

But let’s verify:
LASIK:
- Letters: L, A, S, I, K
- Excluded letters: C,R,N,E,T,O – none present
- A is in position 2 (allowed, not 3 or 4)
- S is in position 3 (allowed, not 1)
- L is in position 1 (allowed, not 5)
- I and K are new letters to test

Thus, LASIK is a valid next guess.

We need to form a valid 5-letter word using these constraints. Let’s try to place A in position 2 (since it can’t be 3 or 4), S in position 3, and L in position 4. That leaves positions 1 and 5 to be filled with remaining letters.

Possible word structure: _ A S L _

Looking for common words fitting this pattern:
- BASAL (but B is allowed, A is already used, S, L are used) – but A is repeated which might be possible
- PASAL (but P is allowed)
- MASAL (M is allowed)
- TASAL (T is excluded)
- BASIL (B, A, S, I, L) – I is allowed and not yet tested
- BASIL seems valid:
  - B (allowed)
  - A (position 2, allowed)
  - S (position 3, allowed)
  - I (allowed)
  - L (position 5, allowed since L can be in 5? Wait, feedback said L is in word but not in position 5. So L cannot be in 5. So BASIL would place L in 5 which is invalid.)

Let’s adjust:
- L cannot be in 5, so possible positions for L: 1,2,3,4
- A cannot be in 3,4, so possible positions: 1,2,5
- S cannot be in 1, so possible positions: 2,3,4,5

Let’s try L in 1, A in 2, S in 3:
Structure: L A S _ _
Need two more letters from remaining (B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z)
Possible word: LASER – but E is excluded
LASER → E is excluded (from CRANE feedback), so invalid.

L A S I _ → LASIK (LASIK is a valid word, K is allowed)
Check constraints:
- L in 1 (allowed)
- A in 2 (allowed)
- S in 3 (allowed)
- I in 4 (allowed)
- K in 5 (allowed)
- No excluded letters (C,R,N,E,T,O)
- All constraints satisfied.

Alternative: L A S _ _ with other letters:
LASPY (not a common word)
LASER (invalid, E excluded)
LASIK seems the best common word.

Another option: _ A _ S L – but L can’t be in 5, so invalid.
A in 5: _ _ _ _ A – but S and L must fit somewhere.

Another structure: _ _ A _ _ with S and L in other positions.
For example: S A L _ _ – but S can’t be in 1, so invalid.
_ S A _ _ – possible: M S A _ _ (but M,S,A are okay)
MSAIL (but I is okay, L in 5 is invalid)

Best seems LASIK.

But let’s check if there’s a simpler word:
B A S I L – but L is in 5 which is invalid (from feedback L is not in 5)
B A S I L → L in 5 → invalid.

Another structure: A _ S _ L – but L in 5 invalid.
A _ _ S _ – possible: A B S I L (L in 5 invalid)
A B S _ _ – A B S I L (invalid)
A B S _ _ – A B S _ _ with L somewhere else:
A B S _ _ – L must be in 3 or 4:
A B S L _ – but S is in 3, L in 4 (allowed), need last letter:
A B S L _ → A B S L _ – but we need 5 letters, so ABSL? No.

Alternative: _ _ _ A S – but A must be in 1,2,5, so 5 is last:
_ _ _ _ A S – but we need 5 letters.

Let’s try L in 2, A in 5:
_ L _ _ A
Need S somewhere (positions 2,3,4,5) – 2 is L, 5 is A, so S in 3 or 4:
_ L S _ A or _ L _ S A

Possible word: B L S _ A – but B,L,S,A are allowed, need 5th letter:
B L S I A – not a word
B L U S A – not a word

Another: F L U S A – not a word.

Let’s try L in 3, A in 2:
_ A L _ _
Need S in 2,4,5 (but 2 is A), so S in 4 or 5:
_ A L S _ or _ A L _ S

Possible word: M A L S _ – but M,A,L,S are allowed, need 5th letter:
M A L S _ – MALSA (not a word)
M A L S Y – MALSY (valid word, but Y is less common)

Another: B A L S Y – BALSY (not common)
G A L S Y – GALS? No.

Let’s try L in 4, A in 1:
A _ _ L _
Need S in 2,3,5:
A S _ L _ or A _ S L _

Possible word: A S I L _ – need 5th letter:
A S I L _ – ASIL_ (ASILK? not a word)
A S I L D – ASILD (not a word)

Another: A _ S L _ – A B S L _ – ABSL? No.

Let’s try A in 5:
_ _ _ _ A
Need S and L in other positions:
S in 2,3,4
L in 1,2,3,4

Possible word: B L A S A – BLASA (not a word)
B L A S _ – BLAS_ (BLAS? No)
S L A B A – SLABA (not a word)

Best valid word seems LASIK.

But let’s verify:
LASIK:
- Letters: L, A, S, I, K
- Excluded letters: C,R,N,E,T,O – none present
- A is in position 2 (allowed, not 3 or 4)
- S is in position 3 (allowed, not 1)
- L is in position 1 (allowed, not 5)
- I and K are new letters to test

Thus, LASIK is a valid next guess.",Guess 3: LASIK -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) A(✓) S(-) I(✓) K(x),FAIL

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N, D. A good starting word should have a mix of these letters to test multiple possibilities.

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it's a strong starting word that includes common consonants (C, R, N) and the most common vowel (A, E).

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, N, E are NOT in the word at all (x).
- A is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position (-).

So we now know:
1. The word contains the letter A, but not in position 3.
2. The letters C, R, N, E are excluded entirely.
3. The remaining letters to consider are: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next step is to test a new set of common letters that don’t include C, R, N, E. Since A must appear somewhere else, let’s try a word that places A in a different position and includes other high-frequency consonants and vowels. 

Possible candidates:
- STOAL (but O and L are good, S and T are common)
- SALTY (but Y is less common)
- PLANT (but N is excluded)
- GAMUT (G, M, U, T)

""STOAL"" seems good because it uses S, T, O, A, L – all common letters not yet tested, and moves A to position 4.

But wait – let’s double-check:
- S, T, O, A, L: none of these are in the excluded set (C, R, N, E).
- A is now in position 4, satisfying the requirement that it’s not in position 3.

Another quick check: ""PLANT"" is out (N is excluded). ""GAMUT"" is valid, but uses G which is less common. ""STOAL"" seems better.

Final choice: STOAL

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: STOAL -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(x) A(-) L(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
   - Letters NOT in the word: C, R, N, E
   - Letter A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. STOAL → S(-) T(x) O(x) A(-) L(-)
   - Letters NOT in the word: T, O
   - Letter S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - Letter A is in the word but not in position 4 (confirmed earlier that it’s not in 3).
   - Letter L is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Must contain: A, S, L
- Must NOT contain: C, R, N, E, T, O
- A cannot be in positions 3 or 4
- S cannot be in position 1
- L cannot be in position 5

Remaining letters to consider: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus S, L which we know are present.

Let’s list possible positions for A, S, L:
- A can be in positions 1, 2, 5
- S can be in positions 2,3,4,5
- L can be in positions 1,2,3,4

We need to form a valid 5-letter word using these constraints. Let’s try to place A in position 2 (since it can’t be 3 or 4), S in position 3, and L in position 4. That leaves positions 1 and 5 to be filled with remaining letters.

Possible word structure: _ A S L _

Looking for common words fitting this pattern:
- BASAL (but B is allowed, A is already used, S, L are used) – but A is repeated which might be possible
- PASAL (but P is allowed)
- MASAL (M is allowed)
- TASAL (T is excluded)
- BASIL (B, A, S, I, L) – I is allowed and not yet tested
- BASIL seems valid:
  - B (allowed)
  - A (position 2, allowed)
  - S (position 3, allowed)
  - I (allowed)
  - L (position 5, allowed since L can be in 5? Wait, feedback said L is in word but not in position 5. So L cannot be in 5. So BASIL would place L in 5 which is invalid.)

Let’s adjust:
- L cannot be in 5, so possible positions for L: 1,2,3,4
- A cannot be in 3,4, so possible positions: 1,2,5
- S cannot be in 1, so possible positions: 2,3,4,5

Let’s try L in 1, A in 2, S in 3:
Structure: L A S _ _
Need two more letters from remaining (B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z)
Possible word: LASER – but E is excluded
LASER → E is excluded (from CRANE feedback), so invalid.

L A S I _ → LASIK (LASIK is a valid word, K is allowed)
Check constraints:
- L in 1 (allowed)
- A in 2 (allowed)
- S in 3 (allowed)
- I in 4 (allowed)
- K in 5 (allowed)
- No excluded letters (C,R,N,E,T,O)
- All constraints satisfied.

Alternative: L A S _ _ with other letters:
LASPY (not a common word)
LASER (invalid, E excluded)
LASIK seems the best common word.

Another option: _ A _ S L – but L can’t be in 5, so invalid.
A in 5: _ _ _ _ A – but S and L must fit somewhere.

Another structure: _ _ A _ _ with S and L in other positions.
For example: S A L _ _ – but S can’t be in 1, so invalid.
_ S A _ _ – possible: M S A _ _ (but M,S,A are okay)
MSAIL (but I is okay, L in 5 is invalid)

Best seems LASIK.

But let’s check if there’s a simpler word:
B A S I L – but L is in 5 which is invalid (from feedback L is not in 5)
B A S I L → L in 5 → invalid.

Another structure: A _ S _ L – but L in 5 invalid.
A _ _ S _ – possible: A B S I L (L in 5 invalid)
A B S _ _ – A B S I L (invalid)
A B S _ _ – A B S _ _ with L somewhere else:
A B S _ _ – L must be in 3 or 4:
A B S L _ – but S is in 3, L in 4 (allowed), need last letter:
A B S L _ → A B S L _ – but we need 5 letters, so ABSL? No.

Alternative: _ _ _ A S – but A must be in 1,2,5, so 5 is last:
_ _ _ _ A S – but we need 5 letters.

Let’s try L in 2, A in 5:
_ L _ _ A
Need S somewhere (positions 2,3,4,5) – 2 is L, 5 is A, so S in 3 or 4:
_ L S _ A or _ L _ S A

Possible word: B L S _ A – but B,L,S,A are allowed, need 5th letter:
B L S I A – not a word
B L U S A – not a word

Another: F L U S A – not a word.

Let’s try L in 3, A in 2:
_ A L _ _
Need S in 2,4,5 (but 2 is A), so S in 4 or 5:
_ A L S _ or _ A L _ S

Possible word: M A L S _ – but M,A,L,S are allowed, need 5th letter:
M A L S _ – MALSA (not a word)
M A L S Y – MALSY (valid word, but Y is less common)

Another: B A L S Y – BALSY (not common)
G A L S Y – GALS? No.

Let’s try L in 4, A in 1:
A _ _ L _
Need S in 2,3,5:
A S _ L _ or A _ S L _

Possible word: A S I L _ – need 5th letter:
A S I L _ – ASIL_ (ASILK? not a word)
A S I L D – ASILD (not a word)

Another: A _ S L _ – A B S L _ – ABSL? No.

Let’s try A in 5:
_ _ _ _ A
Need S and L in other positions:
S in 2,3,4
L in 1,2,3,4

Possible word: B L A S A – BLASA (not a word)
B L A S _ – BLAS_ (BLAS? No)
S L A B A – SLABA (not a word)

Best valid word seems LASIK.

But let’s verify:
LASIK:
- Letters: L, A, S, I, K
- Excluded letters: C,R,N,E,T,O – none present
- A is in position 2 (allowed, not 3 or 4)
- S is in position 3 (allowed, not 1)
- L is in position 1 (allowed, not 5)
- I and K are new letters to test

Thus, LASIK is a valid next guess.

From the three guesses we now have:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)  
   – Letters NOT in the word: C, R, N, E  
   – A is in the word but NOT in position 3.

2. STOAL → S(-) T(x) O(x) A(-) L(-)  
   – T, O are NOT in the word.  
   – S is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
   – A is in the word but NOT in position 4 (confirms earlier).  
   – L is in the word but NOT in position 5.

3. LASIK → L(✓) A(✓) S(-) I(✓) K(x)  
   – L is in position 1 and correct.  
   – A is in position 2 and correct.  
   – S is in the word but NOT in position 3 (so S must be in position 4 or 5).  
   – I is in position 4 and correct.  
   – K is NOT in the word.

So the current partial word is:  
L A _ I _

Letters we know are in the word: L, A, S, I  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, T, O, K  

Remaining positions to fill: 3 and 5.  
- S must be in position 4 or 5. But position 4 is already I, so S must be in position 5.  
- Position 3 must be a letter we haven’t ruled out yet and isn’t already used (L, A, S, I).  
  Available letters (not yet excluded and not used): B, D, F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a common 5-letter word that fits L A _ I S.  
The most common choice is L A B I S (but “LABIS” is not a standard word).  
Next is L A M I S (not a word).  
L A D I S (valid: “LADIS” is a name but not common).  
L A P I S (valid: “LAPIS” is a real word meaning “lapis lazuli”).

“LAPIS” satisfies all constraints:
- L A _ I S with S in position 5.  
- Uses only allowed letters (L, A, P, I, S).  
- P is not excluded.

Therefore, LAPIS is the logical next guess.
