### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these common letters without repeating any. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, and E, which are all very common letters. This should give me good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities quickly based on the feedback.

So far we know:

- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be in 1 or 3.

2. Contains A and I somewhere (but A not in 1 or 3, I not in 4).
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no R, O, E, T, N).

Possible remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s try to place A and I in valid spots. A can be in 2, 4, or 5. I can be in 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).

- A is allowed in position 3? Wait, in Round 1 A was in position 1 and marked (-), then in Round 2 A was in position 3 and also marked (-). So A is NOT in position 3 either.  
So SPAID is invalid because A would be in position 3.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these common letters without repeating any. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, and E, which are all very common letters. This should give me good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities quickly based on the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and S, but not R, O, or E.
- A is not in position 1.
- S is not in position 4.

Letters still possible: A, S, plus the remaining common letters (T, L, N, I, C, U, D, etc.).

I want a new word that:
1. Uses A and S in different positions from before.
2. Avoids R, O, E.
3. Introduces new common letters.

A good candidate is ""STAIN"":
- S is in position 1 (was position 4 before).
- A is in position 3 (was position 1 before).
- Introduces T, I, N which are all common and haven't been tested yet.

- A is allowed in position 3? Wait, in Round 1 A was in position 1 and marked (-), then in Round 2 A was in position 3 and also marked (-). So A is NOT in position 3 either.

From the latest feedback on SCIDA:

- I(✓) – position 3 is locked.
- C(-) – C is in the word but not in position 2.
- D(x) – D is not in the word.
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 5.

So the word structure is:
S _ I _ _

Known letters:
- S (pos 1)
- I (pos 3)
- A must appear somewhere, and the only remaining positions are 2 or 4.
- C must appear somewhere, and the only remaining positions are 4 or 5 (but 5 is already ruled out for A, and D is out). Wait, C can be in 4 or 5, but 5 is open (A can't be there, but C could be).

But A must be in 2 or 4, and C must be in 4 or 5. Let's consider possibilities:

Case 1: A in position 2
Then word is S A I _ _
C must be in position 4 or 5. Position 5 is open, so C could be there.
Letters left: B, F, G, H, K, M, U, V, W, Y (excluding banned: R,O,E,T,N,P,L,D)
Possible: S A I C _

Looking at remaining letters, let's try S A I C K (but K is allowed)
Check if any letters are banned: no K is banned.

Case 2: A in position 4
Then word is S _ I A _
C must be in position 2 or 5. Position 5 is open, so C could be there.
Possible: S C I A _ or S _ I A C
But C can't be in position 2 (from C(-) feedback), so C must be in position 5.
Thus word would be S _ I A C
But position 2 must be a letter not yet used and not banned. From remaining: B, F, G, H, K, M, U, V, W, Y.

Let's check S B I A C - but we need to ensure all letters are allowed.

Between the two cases, Case 1 seems more straightforward with S A I C K.

But let's verify:
- S A I C K
- Letters: S, A, I, C, K
- All letters are allowed (none are banned)
- A is in position 2 (allowed)
- C is in position 4 (allowed, since C(-) only ruled out position 2)
- I is in position 3 (correct)
- S is in position 1 (correct)
- No D, P, L, etc.

This seems valid.

- S(✓) – position 1 is locked.
- I(✓) – position 3 is locked.
- C(-) – C is in the word but not in position 2.
- D(x) – D is not in the word.
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 5.

So the word structure is:
S _ I _ _

Known letters:
- S (pos 1)
- I (pos 3)
- A must appear somewhere, and the only remaining positions are 2 or 4.
- C must appear somewhere, and the only remaining positions are 4 or 5 (but 5 is already ruled out for A, and D is out). Wait, C can be in 4 or 5, but 5 is open (A can't be there, but C could be).

But A must be in 2 or 4, and C must be in 4 or 5. Let's consider possibilities:

Case 1: A in position 2
Then word is S A I _ _
C must be in position 4 or 5. Position 5 is open, so C could be there.
Letters left: B, F, G, H, K, M, U, V, W, Y (excluding banned: R,O,E,T,N,P,L,D)
Possible: S A I C _

Looking at remaining letters, let's try S A I C K (but K is allowed)
Check if any letters are banned: no K is banned.

Case 2: A in position 4
Then word is S _ I A _
C must be in position 2 or 5. Position 5 is open, so C could be there.
Possible: S C I A _ or S _ I A C
But C can't be in position 2 (from C(-) feedback), so C must be in position 5.
Thus word would be S _ I A C
But position 2 must be a letter not yet used and not banned. From remaining: B, F, G, H, K, M, U, V, W, Y.

Let's check S B I A C - but we need to ensure all letters are allowed.

Between the two cases, Case 1 seems more straightforward with S A I C K.

But let's verify:
- S A I C K
- Letters: S, A, I, C, K
- All letters are allowed (none are banned)
- A is in position 2 (allowed)
- C is in position 4 (allowed, since C(-) only ruled out position 2)
- I is in position 3 (correct)
- S is in position 1 (correct)
- No D, P, L, etc.

This seems valid.",Guess 5: SAICK -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(✓) I(✓) C(✓) K(✓),SUCCESS
