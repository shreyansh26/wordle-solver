Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first guess should use as many of these as possible while avoiding repetition. 

Some excellent starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)

Among these, ""RAISE"" is particularly strong because it includes R, A, I, S, and E - five of the most common letters in English. This should give us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is correct in the first position.
- E is in the word but not in the last position.
- A, I, S are not in the word at all.

So the word looks like: R _ _ _ _
The letters A, I, S are eliminated.
We still need to place E somewhere in positions 2-4 (since it can't be in 5).

Good next letters to test: common consonants and vowels not yet used. Remaining common letters include O, T, N, L, C, U, D, M, P, etc.

A good second guess should:
1. Keep R in position 1.
2. Include E in one of positions 2-4.
3. Introduce new common letters not yet tested.

Possible candidates:
- ROUTE (R ✓, O, U, T, E) - but E would be in position 5, which is invalid.
- ROBOT (R ✓, O, B, O, T) - doesn't include E.
- TREND (T is first, but we need R first)

""RENPY"" is a valid word (a game engine) and fits all constraints: R E N P Y. All letters are new and not eliminated.

However, ""REBEL"" is also valid and tests B and L. Between these, ""REBEL"" is more common.

But let's verify: R E B E L – E is repeated. We don't know if E appears twice. To avoid assuming duplicates, choose ""RENPY"" which tests three new letters without repeats.

But ""RENPY"" might be obscure. A better common word is ""REBEL"" despite the E repeat, as it tests B and L.

After reconsideration, ""REBEL"" is more likely to be recognized as a valid guess.

But actually, ""REBEL"" has E in position 4, which is allowed since E is only confirmed in position 2. However, it repeats E. To avoid repeats, choose ""RENPY"".

However, ""RENPY"" is not common. A better choice is ""REBEL"" as it's a common word and tests B and L.

But to avoid repeats, ""RENPY"" is safer. However, ""RENPY"" is obscure. Another option is ""REBUG"" (tests B, U, G).

Between these, ""REBEL"" is more common and acceptable.

Final decision: ""REBEL"" tests B and L in positions 3 and 5, and E in 4 (allowed since E is only confirmed in 2).

But wait, ""REBEL"" has E in 4, which is allowed as E could appear twice. However, we should avoid assuming duplicates. A better word is ""REBEL"" or ""REBUS"" (but S is out). 

Actually, ""REBEL"" is acceptable as it's a common word and tests new letters.

But to avoid repeats, ""RENPY"" is better. However, ""RENPY"" is obscure. 

A better common word is ""REBEL"".

After careful consideration, ""REBEL"" is the best next guess.

But let's check another: ""REPLY"" – P, L, Y are new, and no repeats. ""REPLY"" fits perfectly: R E P L Y.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first guess should use as many of these as possible while avoiding repetition. 

Some excellent starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)

Among these, ""RAISE"" is particularly strong because it includes R, A, I, S, and E - five of the most common letters in English. This should give us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is correct in the first position.
- E is in the word but not in the last position.
- A, I, S are not in the word at all.

So the word looks like: R _ _ _ _
The letters A, I, S are eliminated.
We still need to place E somewhere in positions 2-4 (since it can't be in 5).

Good next letters to test: common consonants and vowels not yet used. Remaining common letters include O, T, N, L, C, U, D, M, P, etc.

A good second guess should:
1. Keep R in position 1.
2. Include E in one of positions 2-4.
3. Introduce new common letters not yet tested.

Possible candidates:
- ROUTE (R ✓, O, U, T, E) - but E would be in position 5, which is invalid.
- ROBOT (R ✓, O, B, O, T) - doesn't include E.
- TREND (T is first, but we need R first)
- RODEO (R ✓, O, D, E, O) - E in position 4, introduces O and D.

RODEO seems strong - it keeps R fixed, places E in position 4, and tests O and D.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first guess should use as many of these as possible while avoiding repetition. 

Some excellent starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)

Among these, ""RAISE"" is particularly strong because it includes R, A, I, S, and E - five of the most common letters in English. This should give us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is correct in the first position.
- E is in the word but not in the last position.
- A, I, S are not in the word at all.

So the word looks like: R _ _ _ _
The letters A, I, S are eliminated.
We still need to place E somewhere in positions 2-4 (since it can't be in 5).

Good next letters to test: common consonants and vowels not yet used. Remaining common letters include O, T, N, L, C, U, D, M, P, etc.

A good second guess should:
1. Keep R in position 1.
2. Include E in one of positions 2-4.
3. Introduce new common letters not yet tested.

Possible candidates:
- ROUTE (R ✓, O, U, T, E) - but E would be in position 5, which is invalid.
- ROBOT (R ✓, O, B, O, T) - doesn't include E.
- TREND (T is first, but we need R first)
- RODEO (R ✓, O, D, E, O) - E in position 4, introduces O and D.

RODEO seems strong - it keeps R fixed, places E in position 4, and tests O and D.

2. E is in the word but NOT in positions 4 or 5.

We need a word that:
- Starts with R
- Contains E in position 2 or 3
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated (no A, I, S, O, D)

Possible candidates:
- REBEL (R ✓, E in 2, B, E in 4, L) – but E appears twice and we don’t know if E is duplicated.
- REMIX – but I is eliminated.
- RENAL – A is eliminated.
- RETCH – T, C, H are new.
- REXES – S is eliminated.
- RUGBY – U, G, B, Y are new, but E is missing.
- RUMPY – M, P, Y are new, but E is missing.
- RUSTY – S, T, Y are new, but S is eliminated.

Remaining common letters to test: N, L, U, M, P, B, F, G, K, Y, W, V, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with ""RE"" and uses only letters not yet ruled out. Possible candidates:
- RELAY – but A is eliminated.
- REMIX – I is eliminated.
- REBEL – B, L are new, but E is repeated (unknown if allowed).
- REBUS – B, U, S; S is eliminated.
- RECKY – C is eliminated.
- REBUG – B, U, G are new.
- REPAY – A is eliminated.
- RENAL – A is eliminated.
- RENPY – N, P, Y are new.

""RENPY"" is a valid word (a game engine) and fits all constraints: R E N P Y. All letters are new and not eliminated.

However, ""REBEL"" is also valid and tests B and L. Between these, ""REBEL"" is more common.

But let's verify: R E B E L – E is repeated. We don't know if E appears twice. To avoid assuming duplicates, choose ""RENPY"" which tests three new letters without repeats.

But ""RENPY"" might be obscure. A better common word is ""REBEL"" despite the E repeat, as it tests B and L.

After reconsideration, ""REBEL"" is more likely to be recognized as a valid guess.

But actually, ""REBEL"" has E in position 4, which is allowed since E is only confirmed in position 2. However, it repeats E. To avoid repeats, choose ""RENPY"".

However, ""RENPY"" is not common. A better choice is ""REBEL"" as it's a common word and tests B and L.

But to avoid repeats, ""RENPY"" is safer. However, ""RENPY"" is obscure. Another option is ""REBUG"" (tests B, U, G).

Between these, ""REBEL"" is more common and acceptable.

Final decision: ""REBEL"" tests B and L in positions 3 and 5, and E in 4 (allowed since E is only confirmed in 2).

But wait, ""REBEL"" has E in 4, which is allowed as E could appear twice. However, we should avoid assuming duplicates. A better word is ""REBEL"" or ""REBUS"" (but S is out). 

Actually, ""REBEL"" is acceptable as it's a common word and tests new letters.

But to avoid repeats, ""RENPY"" is better. However, ""RENPY"" is obscure. 

A better common word is ""REBEL"".

After careful consideration, ""REBEL"" is the best next guess.

But let's check another: ""REPLY"" – P, L, Y are new, and no repeats. ""REPLY"" fits perfectly: R E P L Y.

This tests P, L, Y in positions 3,4,5 and keeps R E fixed. This seems optimal.

- REFUN – invalid.
- REGUM – invalid.
- REKUN – invalid.
- REVUE – E is already in position 2, but ""REVUE"" has E in position 5, which is allowed, but we need to check letters: V, U, E. E is allowed, V is new, U is fixed. But ""REVUE"" is R E V U E – but this has E in position 5, which is allowed since E was only confirmed in position 2. However, we need to check if E can appear twice. We don't have information against it. ""REVUE"" is a valid word.

But ""REVUE"" has E in position 5, which is allowed. Let's check letters: R, E, V, U, E. V is new, E is allowed, U is fixed. This seems valid.

Another option: ""REJUV"" – but V is new, J is new, but ""REJUV"" is not a standard word.

""REVUE"" seems to be the only valid word left fitting the pattern.

Thus, the next guess is ""REVUE"".

<guess>REVUE</guess>",REVUE,"Current constraints:

- R is fixed in position 1.
- E is fixed in position 2.
- U is fixed in position 4.
- Letters eliminated so far: A, I, S, O, D, C, H, T, P, L, Y, B, M.

So the pattern is: R E _ U _

Remaining common letters to test: N, F, G, K, W, V, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with ""RE"", has ""U"" in position 4, and uses only letters not yet eliminated. The only remaining letters are N, F, G, K, W, V, etc.

Possible candidates:
- REFUN – but N is allowed, F is allowed. However, ""REFUN"" is not a valid word.
- REGUM – but M is eliminated.
- REKUW – not a word.
- REWUV – not a word.
- REVUN – not a word.
- REFUN – invalid.
- REKUN – not a word.
- REFUN – invalid.

Actually, ""REFUN"" is not a valid English word. Let's think of valid words fitting R E _ U _.

Valid words:
- REWED – D is eliminated.
- REBUG – B is eliminated.
- REBUM – already used.
- REFUN – invalid.
- REGUM – invalid.
- REKUN – invalid.
- REVUE – E is already in position 2, but ""REVUE"" has E in position 5, which is allowed, but we need to check letters: V, U, E. E is allowed, V is new, U is fixed.
