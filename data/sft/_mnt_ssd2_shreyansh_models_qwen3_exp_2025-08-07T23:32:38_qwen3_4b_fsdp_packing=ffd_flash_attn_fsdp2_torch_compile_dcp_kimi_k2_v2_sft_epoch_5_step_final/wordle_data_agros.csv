- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters, maximizing information gain

This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters that are in the secret word, helping narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- E is not in the word at all (x).

Letters to place: R, S, and one more letter (but we've used all known letters except possibly others).

But we know the word must contain exactly R, S, O, A and one more letter (since it's 5 letters). However, we have A, O already placed, and need R and S. So the word must be A _ _ O _ with R and S in positions 2,3,5.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters, maximizing information gain

This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters that are in the secret word, helping narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct first position (✓).
- R, O, S are all in the word but in the wrong positions (-).
- E is not in the word at all (x).

So the secret word:
- Starts with A.
- Contains R, O, S somewhere in positions 2-5 (but not where they were in AROSE).
- Does not contain E.

I need a new word that:
1. Starts with A.
2. Uses R, O, S in different positions (R not 2nd, O not 3rd, S not 4th).
3. Avoids E.

Possible positions for R, O, S:
- R can be 3rd, 4th, or 5th.
- O can be 2nd, 4th, or 5th.
- S can be 2nd, 3rd, or 5th.

A good candidate is ""ARSON"":
- Starts with A (✓).
- R is in 2nd position (was 2nd in AROSE, but now 3rd - new position).
- O is in 3rd position (was 3rd in AROSE, now 2nd - new position).
- S is in 4th position (was 4th in AROSE, now 3rd - new position).
- N is a new consonant to test.

This should help confirm positions of R, O, S and introduce N.

Guess 2: ARSON -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(-) S(-) O(✓) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Current constraints:
- Word starts with A (position 1).
- Contains R, S, O somewhere in positions 2-5.
- O is in position 4 (✓ from ARSON).
- R is not in position 2 (- from AROSE and ARSON).
- S is not in position 4 (- from AROSE) and not in position 3 (- from ARSON).
- E and N are not in the word (x).

So far:
A _ _ O _

Letters left to place: R, S
Possible positions:
- R: can be 3 or 5 (not 2, not 4)
- S: can be 2 or 5 (not 3, not 4)

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits A _ _ O _ with R and S in the remaining slots.

Possible combinations:
1. A S R O _ → ASRO? (invalid)
2. A S _ O R → ASOR? (invalid)
3. A R S O _ → ARSO? (invalid)
4. A R _ O S → AR_O_S → ARPOS (invalid)
5. A _ S O R → A_SOR → AASOR (invalid)
6. A _ R O S → A_R_O_S → AROOS (invalid)

Wait, let's list valid words that fit A _ _ O _ and contain both R and S:
- ASHOR (invalid)
- ASKOR (invalid)
- ASHOR (invalid)
- ASKOR (invalid)

Actually, let's think systematically:
We have positions: A _ _ O _
Letters to place: R, S, and one more letter (but we've used all known letters except possibly others).

But we know the word must contain exactly R, S, O, A and one more letter (since it's 5 letters). However, we have A, O already placed, and need R and S. So the word must be A _ _ O _ with R and S in positions 2,3,5.

Possible valid words:
- A S R O _ → ASRO? (invalid)
- A S _ O R → ASOR? (invalid)
- A R S O _ → ARSO? (invalid)
- A R _ O S → AR_O_S → ARPOS (invalid)
- A _ S O R → A_SOR → AASOR (invalid)
- A _ R O S → A_R_O_S → AROOS (invalid)

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Maybe I missed something. Let me think of actual words:

Looking at valid 5-letter words starting with A and having O in 4th position:
- AFOOT (but doesn't have R or S)
- AGLOW (no)
- AROSE (already tried)
- AROOF (no)
- AROSE (no)
- ASHOR (no)
- ASKOR (no)
- AROSE (no)

Wait, let's try ""ARSON"" again but we already did that. Maybe ""AROOS"" is invalid.

Actually, let's try ""AROS_"" but we need 5 letters. Maybe ""AROS_"" plus a letter.

Wait, let's think differently: the word must be A _ _ O _ with R and S in positions 2,3,5. The only valid word I can think of is ""ASPOR"" but that's not a word.

Wait, let's list all possible permutations:
Positions: 1:A, 4:O
Possible placements for R and S:
- R in 2, S in 3: A R S O _ → ARSO? (invalid)
- R in 2, S in 5: A R _ O S → AR_O_S → ARPOS (invalid)
- R in 3, S in 2: A S R O _ → ASRO? (invalid)
- R in 3, S in 5: A _ R O S → A_R_O_S → AROOS (invalid)
- R in 5, S in 2: A S _ O R → ASOR? (invalid)
- R in 5, S in 3: A _ S O R → A_SOR → AASOR (invalid)

None of these are valid English words. This suggests I might have missed a letter or made an error in constraints. Let me re-examine the feedback:

From AROSE:
A(✓) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(x)
From ARSON:
A(✓) R(-) S(-) O(✓) N(x)

So the word is A _ _ O _ and must contain R, S, O, A. The fifth letter must be a new letter not yet tested (not E, N). Possible new letters: common ones like T, L, D, etc.

Looking for words A _ _ O _ with R and S:
- A S T O R → ASTOR (valid word)
- A S P O R → ASPOR (invalid)
- A S H O R → ASHOR (invalid)
- A S K O R → ASKOR (invalid)

The valid word here is ""ASTOR"".

Let's check:
A S T O R
- A(✓) position 1
- S in position 2 (was position 4 in AROSE, now new)
- T new letter
- O(✓) position 4
- R in position 5 (was position 2 in AROSE, now new)

This fits all constraints.Based on the feedback:
- A is confirmed in position 1.
- O is confirmed in position 4.
- R, S are in the word but not in their previous positions.
- E, N are excluded.

The word must be A _ _ O _ with R and S in positions 2,3,5. The only valid word fitting this is ""ASTOR"".

From all feedback so far:

- A is locked in position 1.
- O is locked in position 4.
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 4, or 5.
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4.
- Letters already ruled out: E, N, T.

Positions left to fill: 2, 3, 5  
Letters we know must appear: R, S  
R cannot be in 2,4,5 → only possible spot left: position 3  
S cannot be in 2,3,4 → only possible spot left: position 5  

So the pattern is:  
A _ R O S

The blank (position 2) must be a letter we haven’t used yet and that makes a valid 5-letter word.  
Common consonants not yet tested: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Scanning the dictionary for “A _ R O S”:
- A B R O S → no
- A C R O S → no
- A D R O S → no
- A F R O S → no
- A G R O S → no
- A H R O S → no
- A K R O S → no
- A L R O S → no
- A M R O S → no
- A P R O S → no
- A U R O S → no
- A V R O S → no
- A W R O S → no
- A Y R O S → no

Wait—let’s check “ACROSS” but that’s 6 letters.  
Actually, the only common 5-letter word fitting A _ R O S is “ABRIS” (no), “ACROS” (no), “ADROS” (no)… none valid.

Hold on—let me re-examine the constraints carefully:

R must be in the word but NOT in positions 2,4,5.  
The only remaining positions are 1 and 3.  
But position 1 is A, so R must be in position 3.

S must be in the word but NOT in positions 2,3,4.  
Remaining positions: 1 (A) and 5.  
So S must be in position 5.

Thus the word is: A _ R O S.

Now we just need a valid letter for position 2.  
The only common English word that fits A _ R O S is “ACROS” (no), “ABRIS” (no), “ADROS” (no)…

Wait—let me think of “ACROSS” again but it’s 6 letters.  
Actually, the correct 5-letter word is “ACROS” (invalid), “ABRIS” (invalid)…

Ah! The valid word is “ACROS” is invalid, but “ACROSS” is 6 letters.  
I realize now—there is no standard 5-letter word of the form A _ R O S.  
This implies an inconsistency, meaning my earlier deduction must have an error.

Re-evaluating:  
From ASTOR feedback:
A(✓) S(-) T(x) O(✓) R(-)

- S is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- R is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So:
- R cannot be in positions 2,4,5 (from earlier) → only position 3.
- S cannot be in positions 2,3,4 (from earlier) → only position 5.

Thus the word must be A _ R O S.

But no valid 5-letter English word matches this pattern.  
This suggests that the only possibility is that the word is “ACROS” (invalid), which indicates I must have missed a letter.

Wait—let me list all 5-letter words starting with A and having O in position 4, containing both R and S:

- A S R O _ → ASRO? (invalid)
- A S _ O R → ASOR? (invalid)
- A R S O _ → ARSO? (invalid)
- A R _ O S → AR_O_S → ARPOS (invalid)
- A _ S O R → A_SOR → AASOR (invalid)
- A _ R O S → A_R_O_S → AROOS (invalid)

None are valid. This indicates that the word must be “ACROS” (invalid), but since that’s not a word, I must have made an error.

Realizing now—let me check “ACROSS” again: it’s 6 letters.  
The correct 5-letter word is “ACROS” (invalid), so I must have missed “ACROS” is invalid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters, maximizing information gain

This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters that are in the secret word, helping narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct first position (✓).
- R, O, S are all in the word but in the wrong positions (-).
- E is not in the word at all (x).

So the secret word:
- Starts with A.
- Contains R, O, S somewhere in positions 2-5 (but not where they were in AROSE).
- Does not contain E.

I need a new word that:
1. Starts with A.
2. Uses R, O, S in different positions (R not 2nd, O not 3rd, S not 4th).
3. Avoids E.

Possible positions for R, O, S:
- R can be 3rd, 4th, or 5th.
- O can be 2nd, 4th, or 5th.
- S can be 2nd, 3rd, or 5th.

A good candidate is ""ARSON"":
- Starts with A (✓).
- R is in 2nd position (was 2nd in AROSE, but now 3rd - new position).
- O is in 3rd position (was 3rd in AROSE, now 2nd - new position).
- S is in 4th position (was 4th in AROSE, now 3rd - new position).
- N is a new consonant to test.

This should help confirm positions of R, O, S and introduce N.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: ARSON -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(-) S(-) O(✓) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Current constraints:
- Word starts with A (position 1).
- Contains R, S, O somewhere in positions 2-5.
- O is in position 4 (✓ from ARSON).
- R is not in position 2 (- from AROSE and ARSON).
- S is not in position 4 (- from AROSE) and not in position 3 (- from ARSON).
- E and N are not in the word (x).

So far:
A _ _ O _

Letters left to place: R, S
Possible positions:
- R: can be 3 or 5 (not 2, not 4)
- S: can be 2 or 5 (not 3, not 4)

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits A _ _ O _ with R and S in the remaining slots.

Possible combinations:
1. A S R O _ → ASRO? (invalid)
2. A S _ O R → ASOR? (invalid)
3. A R S O _ → ARSO? (invalid)
4. A R _ O S → AR_O_S → ARPOS (invalid)
5. A _ S O R → A_SOR → AASOR (invalid)
6. A _ R O S → A_R_O_S → AROOS (invalid)

Wait, let's list valid words that fit A _ _ O _ and contain both R and S:
- ASHOR (invalid)
- ASKOR (invalid)
- ASHOR (invalid)
- ASKOR (invalid)

Actually, let's think systematically:
We have positions: A _ _ O _
Letters to place: R, S, and one more letter (but we've used all known letters except possibly others).

But we know the word must contain exactly R, S, O, A and one more letter (since it's 5 letters). However, we have A, O already placed, and need R and S. So the word must be A _ _ O _ with R and S in positions 2,3,5.

Possible valid words:
- A S R O _ → ASRO? (invalid)
- A S _ O R → ASOR? (invalid)
- A R S O _ → ARSO? (invalid)
- A R _ O S → AR_O_S → ARPOS (invalid)
- A _ S O R → A_SOR → AASOR (invalid)
- A _ R O S → A_R_O_S → AROOS (invalid)

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Maybe I missed something. Let me think of actual words:

Looking at valid 5-letter words starting with A and having O in 4th position:
- AFOOT (but doesn't have R or S)
- AGLOW (no)
- AROSE (already tried)
- AROOF (no)
- AROSE (no)
- ASHOR (no)
- ASKOR (no)
- AROSE (no)

Wait, let's try ""ARSON"" again but we already did that. Maybe ""AROOS"" is invalid.

Actually, let's try ""AROS_"" but we need 5 letters. Maybe ""AROS_"" plus a letter.

Wait, let's think differently: the word must be A _ _ O _ with R and S in positions 2,3,5. The only valid word I can think of is ""ASPOR"" but that's not a word.

Wait, let's list all possible permutations:
Positions: 1:A, 4:O
Possible placements for R and S:
- R in 2, S in 3: A R S O _ → ARSO? (invalid)
- R in 2, S in 5: A R _ O S → AR_O_S → ARPOS (invalid)
- R in 3, S in 2: A S R O _ → ASRO? (invalid)
- R in 3, S in 5: A _ R O S → A_R_O_S → AROOS (invalid)
- R in 5, S in 2: A S _ O R → ASOR? (invalid)
- R in 5, S in 3: A _ S O R → A_SOR → AASOR (invalid)

None of these are valid English words. This suggests I might have missed a letter or made an error in constraints. Let me re-examine the feedback:

From AROSE:
A(✓) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(x)
From ARSON:
A(✓) R(-) S(-) O(✓) N(x)

So the word is A _ _ O _ and must contain R, S, O, A. The fifth letter must be a new letter not yet tested (not E, N). Possible new letters: common ones like T, L, D, etc.

Looking for words A _ _ O _ with R and S:
- A S T O R → ASTOR (valid word)
- A S P O R → ASPOR (invalid)
- A S H O R → ASHOR (invalid)
- A S K O R → ASKOR (invalid)

The valid word here is ""ASTOR"".

Let's check:
A S T O R
- A(✓) position 1
- S in position 2 (was position 4 in AROSE, now new)
- T new letter
- O(✓) position 4
- R in position 5 (was position 2 in AROSE, now new)

This fits all constraints.Based on the feedback:
- A is confirmed in position 1.
- O is confirmed in position 4.
- R, S are in the word but not in their previous positions.
- E, N are excluded.

The word must be A _ _ O _ with R and S in positions 2,3,5. The only valid word fitting this is ""ASTOR"".

Current constraints:
1. Word is A _ _ O _ (A fixed in position 1, O fixed in position 4).
2. Must contain R and S somewhere in positions 2,3,5.
3. R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE and ARSON) and cannot be in position 5 (from ASTOR), so R must be in position 3.
4. S cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE) and cannot be in position 4 (O is there), and cannot be in position 5 (from ASTOR), so S must be in position 2 or 3. But position 3 is taken by R, so S must be in position 2.
5. Position 5 must be a new letter not yet tested (not E, N, T).

Thus the word must be A S R O _. The only valid 5-letter word fitting this is ASHOR (but H hasn't been tested yet) or ASKOR (invalid), but ASHOR is invalid. Wait, let me think again.

Actually, with R fixed in 3 and S fixed in 2, the word is A S R O _. The fifth letter must be new. The valid word here is ASHOR (invalid), ASKOR (invalid), ASLOR (invalid), ASGOR (invalid)... none seem valid. 

Wait, let me list valid 5-letter words with pattern A S R O _:
- ASKOR (invalid)
- ASHOR (invalid)
- ASKOR (invalid)

Hmm, none valid. Let me re-examine:

From ASTOR feedback:
- S was in position 2 and got (-), meaning S is in the word but not in position 2. So S must be in position 3 or 5.
- R was in position 5 and got (-), so R is in the word but not in position 5. So R must be in position 2 or 3.
- Position 3 is available.

So possible placements:
- S in 3, R in 2: A R S O _
- S in 5, R in 2: A R _ O S
- S in 5, R in 3: A _ R O S

Looking for valid words:
- A R S O _ → ARSON (already tried)
- A R _ O S → ARPOS (invalid)
- A _ R O S → A R O S _ but position 3 is R, position 2 must be new letter.

Valid word: A R O S _ but position 3 is O (fixed), so this is impossible.

- A R C O S → AR COS (invalid)
- A R D O S (invalid)

ARGOS fits:

This satisfies all constraints:
- Contains R and S
- R not in positions 2,5 (from previous feedback)
- S not in positions 2,4,5 (from previous feedback) - but S is in 5 now, which was previously excluded (ASTOR had S in 2 and got -, so S cannot be in 2, but can be in 5). From AROSE, S was in 4 and got -, so 4 is ok for S, but 5 wasn't tested yet. So S in 5 is allowed.

Thus, ARGOS is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters, maximizing information gain

This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters that are in the secret word, helping narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct first position (✓).
- R, O, S are all in the word but in the wrong positions (-).
- E is not in the word at all (x).

So the secret word:
- Starts with A.
- Contains R, O, S somewhere in positions 2-5 (but not where they were in AROSE).
- Does not contain E.

I need a new word that:
1. Starts with A.
2. Uses R, O, S in different positions (R not 2nd, O not 3rd, S not 4th).
3. Avoids E.

Possible positions for R, O, S:
- R can be 3rd, 4th, or 5th.
- O can be 2nd, 4th, or 5th.
- S can be 2nd, 3rd, or 5th.

A good candidate is ""ARSON"":
- Starts with A (✓).
- R is in 2nd position (was 2nd in AROSE, but now 3rd - new position).
- O is in 3rd position (was 3rd in AROSE, now 2nd - new position).
- S is in 4th position (was 4th in AROSE, now 3rd - new position).
- N is a new consonant to test.

This should help confirm positions of R, O, S and introduce N.

Current constraints:

- O is in position 4 (✓ from ARSON).
- R is not in position 2 (- from AROSE and ARSON).

So far:
A _ _ O _

Letters left to place: R, S
Possible positions:
- R: can be 3 or 5 (not 2, not 4)
- S: can be 2 or 5 (not 3, not 4)

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits A _ _ O _ with R and S in the remaining slots.

Possible combinations:

5. A _ S O R → A_SOR → AASOR (invalid)
6. A _ R O S → A_R_O_S → AROOS (invalid)

Wait, let's list valid words that fit A _ _ O _ and contain both R and S:
- ASHOR (invalid)
- ASKOR (invalid)
- ASHOR (invalid)
- ASKOR (invalid)

Actually, let's think systematically:
We have positions: A _ _ O _
Letters to place: R, S, and one more letter (but we've used all known letters except possibly others).

But we know the word must contain exactly R, S, O, A and one more letter (since it's 5 letters). However, we have A, O already placed, and need R and S. So the word must be A _ _ O _ with R and S in positions 2,3,5.

Possible valid words:
- A S R O _ → ASRO? (invalid)
- A S _ O R → ASOR? (invalid)
- A R S O _ → ARSO? (invalid)
- A R _ O S → AR_O_S → ARPOS (invalid)
- A _ S O R → A_SOR → AASOR (invalid)
- A _ R O S → A_R_O_S → AROOS (invalid)

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Maybe I missed something. Let me think of actual words:

Looking at valid 5-letter words starting with A and having O in 4th position:
- AFOOT (but doesn't have R or S)
- AGLOW (no)
- AROSE (already tried)
- AROOF (no)
- AROSE (no)
- ASHOR (no)
- ASKOR (no)
- AROSE (no)

Wait, let's try ""ARSON"" again but we already did that. Maybe ""AROOS"" is invalid.

Actually, let's try ""AROS_"" but we need 5 letters. Maybe ""AROS_"" plus a letter.

Wait, let's think differently: the word must be A _ _ O _ with R and S in positions 2,3,5. The only valid word I can think of is ""ASPOR"" but that's not a word.

Wait, let's list all possible permutations:

- R in 5, S in 3: A _ S O R → A_SOR → AASOR (invalid)

None of these are valid English words. This suggests I might have missed a letter or made an error in constraints. Let me re-examine the feedback:

From AROSE:
A(✓) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(x)
From ARSON:
A(✓) R(-) S(-) O(✓) N(x)

So the word is A _ _ O _ and must contain R, S, O, A. The fifth letter must be a new letter not yet tested (not E, N). Possible new letters: common ones like T, L, D, etc.

Looking for words A _ _ O _ with R and S:
- A S T O R → ASTOR (valid word)
- A S P O R → ASPOR (invalid)
- A S H O R → ASHOR (invalid)
- A S K O R → ASKOR (invalid)

The valid word here is ""ASTOR"".

Let's check:
A S T O R
- A(✓) position 1
- S in position 2 (was position 4 in AROSE, now new)
- T new letter
- O(✓) position 4
- R in position 5 (was position 2 in AROSE, now new)

This fits all constraints.Based on the feedback:
- A is confirmed in position 1.
- O is confirmed in position 4.
- R, S are in the word but not in their previous positions.
- E, N are excluded.

The word must be A _ _ O _ with R and S in positions 2,3,5. The only valid word fitting this is ""ASTOR"".

Current constraints:
1. Word is A _ _ O _ (A fixed in position 1, O fixed in position 4).
2. Must contain R and S somewhere in positions 2,3,5.
3. R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE and ARSON) and cannot be in position 5 (from ASTOR), so R must be in position 3.
4. S cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE) and cannot be in position 4 (O is there), and cannot be in position 5 (from ASTOR), so S must be in position 2 or 3. But position 3 is taken by R, so S must be in position 2.
5. Position 5 must be a new letter not yet tested (not E, N, T).

Thus the word must be A S R O _. The only valid 5-letter word fitting this is ASHOR (but H hasn't been tested yet) or ASKOR (invalid), but ASHOR is invalid. Wait, let me think again.

Actually, with R fixed in 3 and S fixed in 2, the word is A S R O _. The fifth letter must be new. The valid word here is ASHOR (invalid), ASKOR (invalid), ASLOR (invalid), ASGOR (invalid)... none seem valid. 

Wait, let me list valid 5-letter words with pattern A S R O _:
- ASKOR (invalid)
- ASHOR (invalid)
- ASKOR (invalid)

Hmm, none valid. Let me re-examine:

From ASTOR feedback:
- S was in position 2 and got (-), meaning S is in the word but not in position 2. So S must be in position 3 or 5.
- R was in position 5 and got (-), so R is in the word but not in position 5. So R must be in position 2 or 3.
- Position 3 is available.

So possible placements:
- S in 3, R in 2: A R S O _
- S in 5, R in 2: A R _ O S
- S in 5, R in 3: A _ R O S

Looking for valid words:
- A R S O _ → ARSON (already tried)
- A R _ O S → ARPOS (invalid)
- A _ R O S → A R O S _ but position 3 is R, position 2 must be new letter.

Valid word: A R O S _ but position 3 is O (fixed), so this is impossible.

Wait, let's try A _ R O S:
- A _ R O S → A B R O S (invalid), A C R O S (invalid), A D R O S (invalid), A F R O S (invalid), A G R O S (invalid), A H R O S (invalid), A I R O S (invalid), A K R O S (invalid), A L R O S (invalid), A M R O S (invalid), A P R O S (invalid), A Q R O S (invalid), A S R O S (invalid), A T R O S (invalid), A V R O S (invalid), A W R O S (invalid), A X R O S (invalid), A Y R O S (invalid), A Z R O S (invalid).

None valid. Let me try A R _ O S:
- A R _ O S → A R C O S (valid word: ARCO S - but is it a word? ""ARCO"" is 4 letters)
- A R C O S → AR COS (invalid)
- A R D O S (invalid)
- A R F O S (invalid)
- A R G O S (valid word: ARGOS)

ARGOS fits:
- A(✓) position 1
- R in position 2 (new position)
- G new letter
- O(✓) position 4
- S in position 5 (new position)

This satisfies all constraints:
- Contains R and S
- R not in positions 2,5 (from previous feedback)
- S not in positions 2,4,5 (from previous feedback) - but S is in 5 now, which was previously excluded (ASTOR had S in 2 and got -, so S cannot be in 2, but can be in 5). From AROSE, S was in 4 and got -, so 4 is ok for S, but 5 wasn't tested yet. So S in 5 is allowed.

Thus, ARGOS is a valid next guess.
