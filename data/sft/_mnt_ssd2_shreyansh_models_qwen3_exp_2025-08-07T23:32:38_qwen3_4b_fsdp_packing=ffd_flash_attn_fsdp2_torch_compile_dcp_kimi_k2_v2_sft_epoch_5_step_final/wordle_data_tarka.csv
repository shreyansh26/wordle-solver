For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""RAISE,"" or ""ADIEU."" These words cover frequently used letters and vowels.

After considering options, ""SLATE"" is an excellent first choice because:
- It includes three very common consonants (S, L, T)
- It has two common vowels (A, E)
- It's a valid 5-letter English word
- The letters are all distinct, giving maximum feedback information

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) – S is NOT in the word.

- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3.

- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, E.
- Letters IN the word (but in wrong positions): A, T.

Good next candidates should:
1. Include A and T in different positions.
2. Introduce new common letters (R, N, I, O, etc.).
3. Avoid S, L, E.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""RAISE,"" or ""ADIEU."" These words cover frequently used letters and vowels.

After considering options, ""SLATE"" is an excellent first choice because:
- It includes three very common consonants (S, L, T)
- It has two common vowels (A, E)
- It's a valid 5-letter English word
- The letters are all distinct, giving maximum feedback information

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) – S is NOT in the word.
- L(x) – L is NOT in the word.
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, E.
- Letters IN the word (but in wrong positions): A, T.
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels.

Good next candidates should:
1. Include A and T in different positions.
2. Introduce new common letters (R, N, I, O, etc.).
3. Avoid S, L, E.

A strong choice is “TRAIN”:
- Uses T and A (both known to be in the word).
- Adds R, I, N (common letters not yet tested).
- Keeps the word valid and common.

- R must appear somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5

- H → TAR?H (TARH is not a word)
- M → TAR?M (TARMM is not a word)

- TARPS (invalid, S is out)
- TARRY (already tried, Y is out)
- TARDO (invalid, D and O are out)
- TAROK (valid, K is possible)

Between ""TAROK"" and ""TAROC"", ""TAROC"" is more common (a type of card game). Let's check:
- T(1) A(2) R(3) O(4) C(5)
- O is excluded (from TARDO feedback), so ""TAROC"" is invalid.

Next, ""TAROK"" (T(1) A(2) R(3) O(4) K(5)) - O is excluded, so invalid.

Next, ""TAR"" plus a new letter:
- T(1) A(2) R(3) C(4) K(5) → ""TARCK"" is invalid
- T(1) A(2) R(3) M(4) K(5) → ""TARMK"" is invalid
- T(1) A(2) R(3) G(4) K(5) → ""TAGRK"" is invalid

Wait, we need a valid word starting with ""TAR"" and ending with a new letter. Let's think differently:
- Position 4 must be a new letter, not R (since R is in position 3 and cannot be in position 4)
- Position 5 must be a new letter

Looking at valid words:
- T(1) A(2) R(3) _ _ 
- Possible endings: C, G, H, M, P, U, K, etc.

Valid words:
- TARCH (valid, but obscure)
- TAROC (invalid, O is out)
- TAROK (invalid, O is out)
- TARPS (invalid, S is out)
- TARRY (invalid, Y is out)

The only valid word left seems to be ""TARCH"" (a word for a carpenter's tool), but it's obscure. However, ""TARCH"" fits:
- T(1) A(2) R(3) C(4) H(5)
- C and H are new letters not yet tested
- No excluded letters are used

Thus, ""TARCH"" is the best next guess.

- K → TAR?K (TARK is not a word)
- M → TAR?M (TARMM is not a word)
- P → TAR?P (TARPP is not a word)
- U → TAR?U (TARU is not a word)
- G → TAR?G (TARG is not a word)
- H → TAR?H (TARH is not a word)
- M → TAR?M (TARMM is not a word)
- C → TAR?C (TARCH is the only valid word here)

Wait, let's think of common words starting with ""TAR"" and ending with a valid letter:
- TAROT (invalid, O is out)
- TARPS (invalid, S is out)
- TARRY (already tried, Y is out)
- TARDO (invalid, D and O are out)
- TAROK (valid, K is possible)
- TAROC (valid, C is possible)

Between ""TAROK"" and ""TAROC"", ""TAROC"" is more common (a type of card game). Let's check:
- T(1) A(2) R(3) O(4) C(5)
- O is excluded (from TARDO feedback), so ""TAROC"" is invalid.

Next, ""TAROK"" (T(1) A(2) R(3) O(4) K(5)) - O is excluded, so invalid.

Next, ""TAR"" plus a new letter:
- T(1) A(2) R(3) C(4) K(5) → ""TARCK"" is invalid
- T(1) A(2) R(3) M(4) K(5) → ""TARMK"" is invalid
- T(1) A(2) R(3) G(4) K(5) → ""TAGRK"" is invalid

Wait, we need a valid word starting with ""TAR"" and ending with a new letter. Let's think differently:
- Position 4 must be a new letter, not R (since R is in position 3 and cannot be in position 4)
- Position 5 must be a new letter

Looking at valid words:
- T(1) A(2) R(3) _ _ 
- Possible endings: C, G, H, M, P, U, K, etc.

Valid words:
- TARCH (valid, but obscure)
- TAROC (invalid, O is out)
- TAROK (invalid, O is out)
- TARPS (invalid, S is out)
- TARRY (invalid, Y is out)

The only valid word left seems to be ""TARCH"" (a word for a carpenter's tool), but it's obscure. However, ""TARCH"" fits:
- T(1) A(2) R(3) C(4) H(5)
- C and H are new letters not yet tested
- No excluded letters are used

Thus, ""TARCH"" is the best next guess.",Guess 5: TARCH -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) A(✓) R(✓) C(x) H(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""RAISE,"" or ""ADIEU."" These words cover frequently used letters and vowels.

After considering options, ""SLATE"" is an excellent first choice because:
- It includes three very common consonants (S, L, T)
- It has two common vowels (A, E)
- It's a valid 5-letter English word
- The letters are all distinct, giving maximum feedback information

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) – S is NOT in the word.
- L(x) – L is NOT in the word.
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, E.
- Letters IN the word (but in wrong positions): A, T.
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels.

Good next candidates should:
1. Include A and T in different positions.
2. Introduce new common letters (R, N, I, O, etc.).
3. Avoid S, L, E.

A strong choice is “TRAIN”:
- Uses T and A (both known to be in the word).
- Adds R, I, N (common letters not yet tested).
- Keeps the word valid and common.

Guess 2: TRAIN -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(-) E(x)
2. TRAIN → T(✓) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)

Known facts:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, E, I, N
- Letters confirmed IN the word: T (and it is in position 1), A (but not in positions 2 or 3), R (but not in position 2)
- Remaining positions to fill: 2, 3, 4, 5
- A must appear somewhere in positions 2, 4, or 5
- R must appear somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5
- We still need to test common consonants like C, D, G, H, M, P, etc. and vowels like O, U.

A good next guess would place T in position 1 (already confirmed), include A and R in new positions, and introduce new common letters. The word ""TROOP"" is invalid (repeats O). ""TAROC"" is valid but less common. ""TARDY"" is valid but Y is less common. ""TARPS"" is invalid (S already ruled out). ""TAROT"" is invalid (T already used in position 1). ""TARDO"" is valid and introduces D and O.

Let's choose ""TARDO"":
- T in position 1 (✓)
- A in position 2 (new position for A)
- R in position 3 (new position for R)
- D and O are new common letters.

This gives us maximum new information.

From the feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(-) E(x)
2. TRAIN → T(✓) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
3. TARDO → T(✓) A(✓) R(✓) D(x) O(x)

Known facts:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, E, I, N, D, O
- Letters confirmed IN the word and in correct positions: T (position 1), A (position 2), R (position 3)
- Remaining positions to fill: 4 and 5
- Remaining common letters to test: C, G, H, M, P, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with ""TAR"" and ends with two letters not yet ruled out. Common endings for ""TAR"" could be ""TAROT"" (but O is out), ""TARPS"" (S is out), ""TARRY"" (Y is possible), ""TARDO"" (D and O are out), ""TAROK"" (K is possible), ""TAROK"" is valid but less common, ""TAROK"" is actually a valid word (a type of mahjong tile). Alternatively, ""TAROT"" is invalid (O out), ""TAROK"" seems the best.

But ""TAROK"" is a bit obscure. Another option is ""TARDO"" but D and O are out. Next, ""TAROT"" is invalid. ""TARPS"" invalid. ""TARRY"" is valid but Y is less common. ""TAROK"" is valid but K is less common. 

Wait, let's think of common words starting with ""TAR"":
- TARTY (invalid, Y is possible but T is already used)
- TAROK (valid)
- TAROT (invalid)
- TARPS (invalid)
- TARDO (invalid)
- TARRY (valid)

Between ""TAROK"" and ""TARRY"", ""TARRY"" is more common. Let's choose ""TARRY"":
- T(1) A(2) R(3) R(4) Y(5)
- R is already known to be in the word (position 3), so position 4 could be R (but we don't know if R is duplicated)
- Y is a new letter to test

But since R is confirmed in position 3, it's possible it's also in position 4. ""TARRY"" is valid.

Alternatively, ""TAROK"" is valid but less common. Let's go with ""TARRY"" as it's more common.

However, ""TARRY"" has R in position 4, which is new. Let's check if any letters are ruled out:
- Y is not in the excluded list (S, L, E, I, N, D, O)
- R is allowed to repeat

Thus, ""TARRY"" is a valid guess.

- Position 4: R is in the word but NOT in position 4 (from TARRY feedback R(-))
- Position 5: must be a new letter not yet tested (and not in the excluded list)

We need a 5-letter word that starts with ""TAR"" and ends with a letter that:
- is not in the excluded list (S, L, E, I, N, D, O, Y)
- is not R (since R is in position 3 and cannot be in position 4)

Common remaining letters: C, G, H, M, P, U, K, etc.

Possible endings:
- C → TAR?C (TARCH is a valid word, but ""TARCH"" is obscure)
- K → TAR?K (TARK is not a word)

- M → TAR?M (TARMM is not a word)
- C → TAR?C (TARCH is the only valid word here)

Wait, let's think of common words starting with ""TAR"" and ending with a valid letter:
- TAROT (invalid, O is out)
- TARPS (invalid, S is out)
- TARRY (already tried, Y is out)
- TARDO (invalid, D and O are out)
- TAROK (valid, K is possible)
- TAROC (valid, C is possible)

Between ""TAROK"" and ""TAROC"", ""TAROC"" is more common (a type of card game). Let's check:
- T(1) A(2) R(3) O(4) C(5)
- O is excluded (from TARDO feedback), so ""TAROC"" is invalid.

Next, ""TAROK"" (T(1) A(2) R(3) O(4) K(5)) - O is excluded, so invalid.

Next, ""TAR"" plus a new letter:
- T(1) A(2) R(3) C(4) K(5) → ""TARCK"" is invalid
- T(1) A(2) R(3) M(4) K(5) → ""TARMK"" is invalid
- T(1) A(2) R(3) G(4) K(5) → ""TAGRK"" is invalid

Wait, we need a valid word starting with ""TAR"" and ending with a new letter. Let's think differently:
- Position 4 must be a new letter, not R (since R is in position 3 and cannot be in position 4)
- Position 5 must be a new letter

Valid words:
- TARCH (valid, but obscure)

Current confirmed facts:

- U and M are new letters not excluded.
- This uses U in position 4, which is allowed.

Thus, ""TARUM"" is the logical next guess.

<guess>TARUM</guess>",TARUM,"Current confirmed facts:
- Positions 1-3 are T-A-R (fixed).
- Position 4 must be a letter that is in the word but not yet placed (from TARRY: R(-) and TARCH: C(x) means C is not in the word, so position 4 is not C).
- Letters already ruled out: S, L, E, I, N, D, O, Y, C, H.
- Remaining common letters for position 4: G, K, M, P, U, etc.
- Position 5 must be a new letter not yet used.

Looking for 5-letter words starting with ""TAR"" and ending with a valid letter from the remaining pool:
- TAR??
- Valid options: TAROK (invalid, O is out), TARUM (valid), TARPG (invalid), TARMM (invalid), TARPK (invalid), etc.
