For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct common letters. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: x → not in the word
- R: x → not in the word
- A: ✓ → A is in the word and is in position 3
- N: x → not in the word
- E: x → not in the word

So we know:
- The word has A in position 3.
- Letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.
- We still have no information about the other letters (positions 1, 2, 4, 5).

Next, I want to test new common letters while keeping A in position 3. The remaining common letters that haven’t been tested yet include S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.

A good strategy is to pick a word that:
- Has A in position 3
- Uses new common letters for positions 1, 2, 4, 5
- Avoids any letters we know are not in the word (C, R, N, E)

Possible candidates:
- SLATE (but E is excluded)
- PLANT (but N is excluded)
- STAMP (but M, P, S, T are new)
- STAFF (but F is less common)
- GLASS (but S is repeated, and we don’t know about S yet)

From the two guesses we have:

CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)

What we now know:
- Position 3 is definitely A.
- Position 1 is definitely S.
- Letters NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, T, L, K.
- Still need to determine positions 2 and 5 (and also whether any other letters are present).

So the pattern so far is:
S _ A _ _

We need two more letters for positions 2 and 5, chosen from the remaining alphabet (excluding C, R, N, E, T, L, K).

Common remaining letters: D, G, H, I, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep S in position 1 and A in position 3.
2. Introduce new common letters for positions 2 and 5.
3. Avoid any letters we know are excluded.

Candidate words:
- SHADY (but D and Y are less common)
- SPASM (but M and P are good, and S is repeated)
- SWAMP (W, M, P are good)
- SADGY (but G and Y are less common)
- SAVAGE (too long)
- SABOT (but O and B are good, T is excluded)

Best option seems SWAMP:
- S(✓) W(?) A(✓) M(?) P(?)
- W, M, P are all new common letters.

But let me double-check: is W in the word? We don’t know yet. Similarly for M and P.

Another good option is SHAMP (but H and P are new), but SHAMP isn’t a valid word.

Another valid word: SAGGY (G and Y are new, but Y is less common).

Actually, a better choice is SWAMP because:
- It’s a valid word.
- W, M, P are all new and common.
- It keeps S and A in their correct positions.

- We still have no information about the other letters (positions 1, 2, 4, 5).

Next, I want to test new common letters while keeping A in position 3. The remaining common letters that haven’t been tested yet include S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.

A good strategy is to pick a word that:

- Uses new common letters for positions 1, 2, 4, 5
- Avoids any letters we know are not in the word (C, R, N, E)

Possible candidates:

- STAFF (but F is less common)
- GLASS (but S is repeated, and we don’t know about S yet)

Common remaining letters: D, G, H, I, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep S in position 1 and A in position 3.
2. Introduce new common letters for positions 2 and 5.
3. Avoid any letters we know are excluded.

Candidate words:
- SHADY (but D and Y are less common)
- SPASM (but M and P are good, and S is repeated)
- SWAMP (W, M, P are good)
- SADGY (but G and Y are less common)
- SAVAGE (too long)
- SABOT (but O and B are good, T is excluded)

Best option seems SWAMP:
- S(✓) W(?) A(✓) M(?) P(?)
- W, M, P are all new common letters.

But let me double-check: is W in the word? We don’t know yet. Similarly for M and P.

Another good option is SHAMP (but H and P are new), but SHAMP isn’t a valid word.

Another valid word: SAGGY (G and Y are new, but Y is less common).

Actually, a better choice is SWAMP because:
- It’s a valid word.
- W, M, P are all new and common.
- It keeps S and A in their correct positions.

So I’ll go with SWAMP.

But wait, we need to test two new letters for positions 4 and 5.  
Looking at SWASH: positions 4 and 5 are S and H.  
We already know S is in position 1, but the word could have S elsewhere.  
However, we have no feedback yet on H.  

Another candidate: SWIGS – positions 4 and 5 are G and S.  
G is new, S is already known.  

SWISH – positions 4 and 5 are I and S.  
I is new, S is known.  

SWAYS – positions 4 and 5 are Y and S.

SWAGS – positions 4 and 5 are G and S.

SWASH introduces H, which hasn’t been tested yet.  

I think SWASH is the best choice here because it tests H in position 5 and keeps S in position 4 (even though S is already known to be in position 1, this could confirm if S appears again).  

But actually, position 4 in SWASH is S, which is allowed.  
Let me verify: SWASH is a valid 5-letter word.  

Yes, SWASH is valid.  
So I’ll go with SWASH.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct common letters. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: x → not in the word
- R: x → not in the word
- A: ✓ → A is in the word and is in position 3
- N: x → not in the word
- E: x → not in the word

So we know:
- The word has A in position 3.
- Letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.
- We still have no information about the other letters (positions 1, 2, 4, 5).

Next, I want to test new common letters while keeping A in position 3. The remaining common letters that haven’t been tested yet include S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.

A good strategy is to pick a word that:
- Has A in position 3
- Uses new common letters for positions 1, 2, 4, 5
- Avoids any letters we know are not in the word (C, R, N, E)

Possible candidates:
- SLATE (but E is excluded)
- PLANT (but N is excluded)
- STAMP (but M, P, S, T are new)
- STAFF (but F is less common)
- GLASS (but S is repeated, and we don’t know about S yet)
- STALK (S, T, L, K are new)

I’ll choose STALK because:
- A is in position 3
- Uses S, T, L, K which are all new and common
- Avoids C, R, N, E

From the two guesses we have:

What we now know:
- Position 3 is definitely A.
- Position 1 is definitely S.
- Letters NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, T, L, K.
- Still need to determine positions 2 and 5 (and also whether any other letters are present).

So the pattern so far is:
S _ A _ _

We need two more letters for positions 2 and 5, chosen from the remaining alphabet (excluding C, R, N, E, T, L, K).

Common remaining letters: D, G, H, I, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep S in position 1 and A in position 3.
2. Introduce new common letters for positions 2 and 5.

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct common letters. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: x → not in the word
- R: x → not in the word
- A: ✓ → A is in the word and is in position 3
- N: x → not in the word
- E: x → not in the word

So we know:
- The word has A in position 3.
- Letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.
- We still have no information about the other letters (positions 1, 2, 4, 5).

Next, I want to test new common letters while keeping A in position 3. The remaining common letters that haven’t been tested yet include S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.

A good strategy is to pick a word that:
- Has A in position 3
- Uses new common letters for positions 1, 2, 4, 5
- Avoids any letters we know are not in the word (C, R, N, E)

Possible candidates:
- SLATE (but E is excluded)
- PLANT (but N is excluded)
- STAMP (but M, P, S, T are new)
- STAFF (but F is less common)
- GLASS (but S is repeated, and we don’t know about S yet)
- STALK (S, T, L, K are new)

I’ll choose STALK because:
- A is in position 3
- Uses S, T, L, K which are all new and common
- Avoids C, R, N, E

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STALK -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) A(✓) L(x) K(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)  
STALK → S(✓) T(x) A(✓) L(x) K(x)

What we now know:
- Position 3 is definitely A.
- Position 1 is definitely S.
- Letters NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, T, L, K.
- Still need to determine positions 2 and 5 (and also whether any other letters are present).

So the pattern so far is:
S _ A _ _

We need two more letters for positions 2 and 5, chosen from the remaining alphabet (excluding C, R, N, E, T, L, K).

Common remaining letters: D, G, H, I, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep S in position 1 and A in position 3.
2. Introduce new common letters for positions 2 and 5.
3. Avoid any letters we know are excluded.

Candidate words:
- SHADY (but D and Y are less common)
- SPASM (but M and P are good, and S is repeated)
- SWAMP (W, M, P are good)
- SADGY (but G and Y are less common)
- SAVAGE (too long)
- SABOT (but O and B are good, T is excluded)

Best option seems SWAMP:
- S(✓) W(?) A(✓) M(?) P(?)
- W, M, P are all new common letters.

But let me double-check: is W in the word? We don’t know yet. Similarly for M and P.

Another good option is SHAMP (but H and P are new), but SHAMP isn’t a valid word.

Another valid word: SAGGY (G and Y are new, but Y is less common).

Actually, a better choice is SWAMP because:
- It’s a valid word.
- W, M, P are all new and common.
- It keeps S and A in their correct positions.

So I’ll go with SWAMP.

Letters already confirmed in the word: S, W, A  
Letters already ruled out: C, R, N, E, T, L, K, M, P  

We still need two letters for positions 4 and 5, chosen from the remaining alphabet (excluding the 9 letters above).  
Remaining common letters: D, G, H, I, O, U, V, Y, etc.

We also know the word must be a valid 5-letter English word starting with SWA.  
Possible endings for SWA _ _ :  
- SWAMI (but M is excluded)  
- SWASH (H is available)  
- SWATH (T is excluded)  
- SWAIN (N is excluded)  
- SWAGS (S is already used in position 1, but S can repeat)  
- SWAGY (Y is available)  
- SWAIN (N excluded)  
- SWAMI (M excluded)  
- SWASH (H available)  
- SWAYS (Y and S available)  
- SWIGS (I, G available)  
- SWOOP (O, P available but P excluded)  
- SWORE (O, R available but R excluded)  
- SWORE (E excluded)  
- SWUNG (U, N available but N excluded)  
- SWISH (I, S available)  
- SWOOP (P excluded)  
- SWORE (R, E excluded)  

Valid candidates: SWASH, SWAGS, SWAYS, SWIGS, SWISH.

Among these, SWASH, SWIGS, SWISH are all common.  
I’ll pick SWASH because it introduces H and S (but S is already known to be in the word).  
However, since we already know S is in position 1, we can test new letters with SWASH.

But wait, we need to test two new letters for positions 4 and 5.  
Looking at SWASH: positions 4 and 5 are S and H.  
We already know S is in position 1, but the word could have S elsewhere.  
However, we have no feedback yet on H.  

Another candidate: SWIGS – positions 4 and 5 are G and S.  
G is new, S is already known.  

SWISH – positions 4 and 5 are I and S.  
I is new, S is known.  

SWAYS – positions 4 and 5 are Y and S.  
Y is new, S is known.  

SWAGS – positions 4 and 5 are G and S.  
Same as SWIGS.  

SWASH introduces H, which hasn’t been tested yet.  

I think SWASH is the best choice here because it tests H in position 5 and keeps S in position 4 (even though S is already known to be in position 1, this could confirm if S appears again).  

But actually, position 4 in SWASH is S, which is allowed.  
Let me verify: SWASH is a valid 5-letter word.  

Yes, SWASH is valid.  
So I’ll go with SWASH.

The remaining common letters that haven’t been tested yet include S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.\n\nA good strategy is to pick a word that:\n- Has A in position 3\n- Uses new common letters for positions 1, 2, 4, 5\n- Avoids any letters we know are not in the word (C, R, N, E)\n\nPossible candidates:\n- SLATE (but E is excluded)\n- PLANT (but N is excluded)\n- STAMP (but M, P, S, T are new)\n- STAFF (but F is less common)\n- GLASS (but S is repeated, and we don’t know about S yet)\n- STALK (S, T, L, K are new)\n\nI’ll choose STALK because:\n- A is in position 3\n- Uses S, T, L, K which are all new and common\n- Avoids C, R, N, E\n\n<guess>STALK</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: STALK -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) A(✓) L(x) K(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two guesses we have:\n\nCRANE → C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)  \nSTALK → S(✓) T(x) A(✓) L(x) K(x)\n\nWhat we now know:\n- Position 3 is definitely A.\n- Position 1 is definitely S.\n- Letters NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, T, L, K.\n- Still need to determine positions 2 and 5 (and also whether any other letters are present).\n\nSo the pattern so far is:\nS _ A _ _\n\nWe need two more letters for positions 2 and 5, chosen from the remaining alphabet (excluding C, R, N, E, T, L, K).\n\nCommon remaining letters: D, G, H, I, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nA good next guess should:\n1.

Current confirmed information:
