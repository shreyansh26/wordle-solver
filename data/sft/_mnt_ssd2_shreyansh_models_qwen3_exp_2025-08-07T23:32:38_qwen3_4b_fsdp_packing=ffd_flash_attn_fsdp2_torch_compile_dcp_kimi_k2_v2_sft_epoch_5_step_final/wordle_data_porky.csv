3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common consonants like R, S, T, N, L and vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices. A strong starting word should avoid repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible.

Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because:
1. It uses 5 unique letters
2. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
3. It contains 2 common consonants (R, S)
4. The letters are all in positions where they can provide useful information

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so R is somewhere in positions 2-5, but not position 2
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so O is somewhere in positions 1-4, but not position 3
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
- Letters not in the word: A, S, E
- Letters in the word (but positions unknown): R, O
- We still need three more letters, none of which can be A, S, or E.

We should try to place R and O in new positions and add new common consonants and vowels. Good candidates for the remaining letters are T, N, I, L, U, D, C, etc.

A good next guess would be a word that:
- Uses R and O in new positions (R not in position 2, O not in position 3)
- Introduces new common letters
- Avoids A, S, E

""TRIUM"" is invalid (not a word). ""FRONT"" is good:
- F, R, O, N, T
- R is in position 2 (but we know R is not in position 2 from AROSE feedback) – so this is bad.

""ROUND"" is good:
- R, O, U, N, D
- R is in position 1 (new position, since in AROSE it was position 2)
- O is in position 2 (new position, since in AROSE it was position 3)
- Introduces U, N, D (all new letters)

- R must be in position 3, 4, or 5
- We still need three more letters, none of which can be A, S, E, U, N, D.

Remaining common letters to try: T, L, I, C, G, M, H, Y, K, B, F, W, V, P, etc.

Let’s pick a word that:
1. Has O in position 2.
2. Has R in position 3, 4, or 5.
3. Uses new letters not yet tested.

Option 1: BORIC
- B, O, R, I, C
- R is in position 3 (allowed)
- Uses B, I, C (new letters)

Option 2: CORGI
- C, O, R, G, I
- R is in position 3 (allowed)
- Uses C, G, I (new letters)

Option 3: FORGY
- F, O, R, G, Y
- R is in position 3 (allowed)
- Uses F, G, Y (new letters)

Among these, “BORIC” uses common letters and is a valid word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common consonants like R, S, T, N, L and vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices. A strong starting word should avoid repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible.

Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because:
1. It uses 5 unique letters
2. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
3. It contains 2 common consonants (R, S)
4. The letters are all in positions where they can provide useful information

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so R is somewhere in positions 2-5, but not position 2
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so O is somewhere in positions 1-4, but not position 3
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
- Letters not in the word: A, S, E
- Letters in the word (but positions unknown): R, O
- We still need three more letters, none of which can be A, S, or E.

We should try to place R and O in new positions and add new common consonants and vowels. Good candidates for the remaining letters are T, N, I, L, U, D, C, etc.

A good next guess would be a word that:
- Uses R and O in new positions (R not in position 2, O not in position 3)
- Introduces new common letters
- Avoids A, S, E

""TRIUM"" is invalid (not a word). ""FRONT"" is good:
- F, R, O, N, T
- R is in position 2 (but we know R is not in position 2 from AROSE feedback) – so this is bad.

""ROUND"" is good:
- R, O, U, N, D
- R is in position 1 (new position, since in AROSE it was position 2)
- O is in position 2 (new position, since in AROSE it was position 3)
- Introduces U, N, D (all new letters)

""ROUND"" seems optimal.

Current knowledge:

Letters NOT in the word:  
A, S, E, U, N, D, B, I, C, F, T

Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:  
- O is in position 2 (✓)  
- R is in position 3 (✓)  
- Y is in position 5 (✓)  

So the pattern is:  
_ O R _ Y

We need one more letter for position 1 and one for position 4, using only letters not yet eliminated.  
Available letters (common ones): L, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, etc.

Possible combinations:  
- Position 1: L, G, H, K, M, P, V, W  
- Position 4: Must be one of the remaining letters.

Let’s list valid 5-letter words fitting _ O R _ Y:

- G O R G Y – invalid (G repeated, and G is allowed but double use not helpful)  
- H O R S Y – S is eliminated  
- H O R S E – E is eliminated  
- H O R S E – E eliminated  
- P O R K Y – P, K, Y all allowed, PORKY is a valid word  
- M O R R Y – R repeated (invalid)  
- V O R T Y – T eliminated  
- W O R K Y – W, K, Y allowed, WORKY is valid  
- G O R G Y – G repeated  
- H O R S Y – S eliminated  

Between PORKY and WORKY, both fit. PORKY uses P and K; WORKY uses W and K. Both are valid.  
Let’s choose PORKY first.
