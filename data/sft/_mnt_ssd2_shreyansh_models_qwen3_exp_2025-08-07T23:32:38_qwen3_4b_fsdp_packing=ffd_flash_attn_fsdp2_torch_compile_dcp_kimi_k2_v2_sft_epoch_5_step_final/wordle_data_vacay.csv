For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Common choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E

""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters in English words. This should give us good information about which of these common letters are in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s not in position 1).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains an A, but not in the first position.
- The word does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
- Therefore, the remaining letters must come from the other 16 letters (excluding R, O, S, E).

I want a new guess that:
1. Places A in a different position (positions 2-5).
2. Uses other common letters that haven’t been eliminated (like T, N, I, L, U, C, etc.).
3. Avoids R, O, S, E entirely.

A good candidate is “TAINT”:
- T, N, I are common and haven’t been eliminated.
- A is moved to position 2.
- It has two vowels (A, I) and three consonants (T, N, T), which is a balanced structure.

Another candidate could be “UNTIL” or “CANTU”, but “TAINT” seems more likely to reveal useful information.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

1. The word contains A, and A is in position 2.
2. The word does NOT contain R, O, S, E, T, I, N.

So far the letters we have ruled out are: R, O, S, E, T, I, N.

That leaves the following consonants and vowels that could appear:  
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
plus the vowel A (already confirmed).

We also know position 2 is A, so the pattern is: _ A _ _ _

To maximize information, I’ll choose a word that:
- Keeps A in position 2.
- Uses new common letters from the remaining pool.
- Avoids every letter already ruled out.

Good remaining common letters: L, U, C, M, P, D, G, B, F, H, K, Y.

A balanced word using several of these is “CAMPY”:
- C, M, P, Y are all new letters.
- A is in the correct spot.
- It covers four fresh consonants and one fresh vowel (U is already used as a vowel, but Y can act as a vowel here).

However, “CAMPY” uses Y, which is less common. A slightly more common word is “CABBY”, but it repeats B, which is fine.

Another good option is “LABBY” or “GUMMY”, but “CAMPY” gives us four fresh consonants.

From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word is _ A _ _ _  (A is locked in position 2).
2. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: R, O, S, E, T, I, N, M, P.
3. Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: C and Y.

So the pattern is: _ A _ _ _ and the remaining letters must include C and Y somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We have ruled out:
Consonants: R, S, T, N, M, P
Vowels: O, E, I

Remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z
Remaining vowels: U (the only vowel left besides A)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2.
- Contains C and Y.
- Uses only the remaining letters.

Possible positions for C and Y:
- C could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5
- Y could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5
- They can't both be in the same position.

Let's list possible words:
- C A Y _ _  → CAY?? (no common 5-letter words)
- C _ A Y _  → C_A_Y_ (e.g., CARRY - but R is out)
- C _ A _ Y  → C_A__Y (e.g., CADDY - but D is allowed, D is not ruled out)
- _ A C Y _  → _ACY_ (e.g., BACON - but O is out, N is out)
- _ A _ C Y  → _A_CY (e.g., BACON - N is out)
- _ A Y C _  → _AYC_ (e.g., BAYCL - not a word)
- _ A _ Y C  → _A_YC (e.g., BAYRC - not a word)
- Y A C _ _  → YA_C_ (e.g., YACHT - but T is out)
- Y A _ C _  → YA_C_ (e.g., YACHT - T is out)
- Y A _ _ C  → YA__C (e.g., YACHT - T is out)

Looking at these, the only plausible common word seems to be ""CADDY"", but it contains D twice and D hasn't been ruled out. However, ""CADDY"" uses D twice and Y once, but we know Y is in the word. However, ""CADDY"" is C A D D Y, which has A in position 2, C in position 1, Y in position 5, and D in positions 3 and 4. This fits all constraints: A is in position 2, C is in the word (position 1), Y is in the word (position 5), and uses only allowed letters (D is allowed, not ruled out).

But wait, ""CADDY"" uses D twice, and we haven't ruled out D. Let me check if D is allowed - yes, D hasn't been used in any guess, so it's allowed.

Another possible word is ""CABBY"" but B is allowed, but we know Y must be in the word (position 5 in CABB Y, but Y is in position 5), but B is allowed. However, ""CABBY"" has B twice, which is fine.

But ""CADDY"" seems more likely as a common word.

However, let me think of other possibilities:
- ""CABBY"" - C A B B Y
- ""CADDY"" - C A D D Y
- ""CAGGY"" - C A G G Y
- ""CAVY_"" - but V is allowed, but need a 5-letter word ending with Y: CAVY_ - no
- ""CALYX"" - but X is allowed, but CALYX is a bit obscure
- ""CAMPY"" - already used
- ""CANTY"" - but N is out
- ""CAVILY"" - too long
- ""CAPSY"" - but P is out
- ""CARBY"" - but R is out
- ""CASKY"" - but S is out
- ""CATTY"" - but T is out
- ""CATTY"" - T is out
- ""CATTY"" - T is out

From these, ""CADDY"", ""CABBY"", ""CAGGY"" are the most plausible. Among these, ""CADDY"" is the most common word.

But let me check if ""CADDY"" fits all constraints:
- A is in position 2: yes (C A D D Y)
- C is in the word (position 1): yes
- Y is in the word (position 5): yes
- No R, O, S, E, T, I, N, M, P: yes (C, A, D, D, Y - only D is repeated, but D is allowed)
- All letters are from remaining allowed set: yes

Therefore, ""CADDY"" is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Common choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E

""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters in English words. This should give us good information about which of these common letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s not in position 1).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains an A, but not in the first position.
- The word does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
- Therefore, the remaining letters must come from the other 16 letters (excluding R, O, S, E).

I want a new guess that:
1. Places A in a different position (positions 2-5).
2. Uses other common letters that haven’t been eliminated (like T, N, I, L, U, C, etc.).
3. Avoids R, O, S, E entirely.

A good candidate is “TAINT”:
- T, N, I are common and haven’t been eliminated.
- A is moved to position 2.
- It has two vowels (A, I) and three consonants (T, N, T), which is a balanced structure.

Another candidate could be “UNTIL” or “CANTU”, but “TAINT” seems more likely to reveal useful information.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two previous guesses we now know:

1. The word contains A, and A is in position 2.
2. The word does NOT contain R, O, S, E, T, I, N.

So far the letters we have ruled out are: R, O, S, E, T, I, N.

That leaves the following consonants and vowels that could appear:  
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
plus the vowel A (already confirmed).

We also know position 2 is A, so the pattern is: _ A _ _ _

To maximize information, I’ll choose a word that:
- Keeps A in position 2.
- Uses new common letters from the remaining pool.
- Avoids every letter already ruled out.

Good remaining common letters: L, U, C, M, P, D, G, B, F, H, K, Y.

A balanced word using several of these is “CAMPY”:
- C, M, P, Y are all new letters.
- A is in the correct spot.
- It covers four fresh consonants and one fresh vowel (U is already used as a vowel, but Y can act as a vowel here).

However, “CAMPY” uses Y, which is less common. A slightly more common word is “CABBY”, but it repeats B, which is fine.

Another good option is “LABBY” or “GUMMY”, but “CAMPY” gives us four fresh consonants.

I’ll go with “CAMPY”.

From all feedback so far:

1. Pattern locked: _ A _ _ _ (A is fixed in position 2).
2. Letters known NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, T, I, N, M, P, D.
3. Letters known TO be in the word: A (position 2), C (somewhere), Y (somewhere).

So the word is _ A _ _ _, must contain both C and Y, and may only use letters not yet ruled out.

Remaining consonants: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z  
Remaining vowels: U (only vowel left besides A)

We need to place C and Y in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5, and fill the remaining slots with allowed letters.

Possible placements:
- C in 1: C A _ _ _
- C in 3: _ A C _ _
- C in 4: _ A _ C _
- C in 5: _ A _ _ C

Similarly for Y in 1, 3, 4, or 5.

The only plausible common words left are CABBY, CALLY, CAGGY. Among these, CABBY is the most common word.

Let’s verify CABBY:
- C A B B Y
- A is in position 2: ✓
- C is in the word (position 1): ✓
- Y is in the word (position 5): ✓
- Letters used: C, A, B, B, Y – none of the ruled-out letters appear.
- All letters are from the allowed set.

Therefore, CABBY is a valid next guess.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Common choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E

""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters in English words. This should give us good information about which of these common letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s not in position 1).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains an A, but not in the first position.
- The word does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
- Therefore, the remaining letters must come from the other 16 letters (excluding R, O, S, E).

I want a new guess that:
1. Places A in a different position (positions 2-5).
2. Uses other common letters that haven’t been eliminated (like T, N, I, L, U, C, etc.).
3. Avoids R, O, S, E entirely.

A good candidate is “TAINT”:
- T, N, I are common and haven’t been eliminated.
- A is moved to position 2.
- It has two vowels (A, I) and three consonants (T, N, T), which is a balanced structure.

Another candidate could be “UNTIL” or “CANTU”, but “TAINT” seems more likely to reveal useful information.

Guess 2: TAINT -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two previous guesses we now know:

1. The word contains A, and A is in position 2.
2. The word does NOT contain R, O, S, E, T, I, N.

So far the letters we have ruled out are: R, O, S, E, T, I, N.

That leaves the following consonants and vowels that could appear:  
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
plus the vowel A (already confirmed).

We also know position 2 is A, so the pattern is: _ A _ _ _

To maximize information, I’ll choose a word that:
- Keeps A in position 2.
- Uses new common letters from the remaining pool.
- Avoids every letter already ruled out.

Good remaining common letters: L, U, C, M, P, D, G, B, F, H, K, Y.

A balanced word using several of these is “CAMPY”:
- C, M, P, Y are all new letters.
- A is in the correct spot.
- It covers four fresh consonants and one fresh vowel (U is already used as a vowel, but Y can act as a vowel here).

However, “CAMPY” uses Y, which is less common. A slightly more common word is “CABBY”, but it repeats B, which is fine.

Another good option is “LABBY” or “GUMMY”, but “CAMPY” gives us four fresh consonants.

I’ll go with “CAMPY”.

From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word is _ A _ _ _  (A is locked in position 2).
2. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: R, O, S, E, T, I, N, M, P.
3. Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: C and Y.

So the pattern is: _ A _ _ _ and the remaining letters must include C and Y somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We have ruled out:
Consonants: R, S, T, N, M, P
Vowels: O, E, I

Remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z
Remaining vowels: U (the only vowel left besides A)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2.
- Contains C and Y.
- Uses only the remaining letters.

Possible positions for C and Y:
- C could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5
- Y could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5
- They can't both be in the same position.

Let's list possible words:
- C A Y _ _  → CAY?? (no common 5-letter words)
- C _ A Y _  → C_A_Y_ (e.g., CARRY - but R is out)
- C _ A _ Y  → C_A__Y (e.g., CADDY - but D is allowed, D is not ruled out)
- _ A C Y _  → _ACY_ (e.g., BACON - but O is out, N is out)
- _ A _ C Y  → _A_CY (e.g., BACON - N is out)
- _ A Y C _  → _AYC_ (e.g., BAYCL - not a word)
- _ A _ Y C  → _A_YC (e.g., BAYRC - not a word)
- Y A C _ _  → YA_C_ (e.g., YACHT - but T is out)
- Y A _ C _  → YA_C_ (e.g., YACHT - T is out)
- Y A _ _ C  → YA__C (e.g., YACHT - T is out)

Looking at these, the only plausible common word seems to be ""CADDY"", but it contains D twice and D hasn't been ruled out. However, ""CADDY"" uses D twice and Y once, but we know Y is in the word. However, ""CADDY"" is C A D D Y, which has A in position 2, C in position 1, Y in position 5, and D in positions 3 and 4. This fits all constraints: A is in position 2, C is in the word (position 1), Y is in the word (position 5), and uses only allowed letters (D is allowed, not ruled out).

But wait, ""CADDY"" uses D twice, and we haven't ruled out D. Let me check if D is allowed - yes, D hasn't been used in any guess, so it's allowed.

Another possible word is ""CABBY"" but B is allowed, but we know Y must be in the word (position 5 in CABB Y, but Y is in position 5), but B is allowed. However, ""CABBY"" has B twice, which is fine.

But ""CADDY"" seems more likely as a common word.

However, let me think of other possibilities:
- ""CABBY"" - C A B B Y
- ""CADDY"" - C A D D Y
- ""CAGGY"" - C A G G Y
- ""CAVY_"" - but V is allowed, but need a 5-letter word ending with Y: CAVY_ - no
- ""CALYX"" - but X is allowed, but CALYX is a bit obscure
- ""CAMPY"" - already used
- ""CANTY"" - but N is out
- ""CAVILY"" - too long
- ""CAPSY"" - but P is out
- ""CARBY"" - but R is out
- ""CASKY"" - but S is out
- ""CATTY"" - but T is out
- ""CATTY"" - T is out
- ""CATTY"" - T is out

From these, ""CADDY"", ""CABBY"", ""CAGGY"" are the most plausible. Among these, ""CADDY"" is the most common word.

But let me check if ""CADDY"" fits all constraints:
- A is in position 2: yes (C A D D Y)
- C is in the word (position 1): yes
- Y is in the word (position 5): yes
- No R, O, S, E, T, I, N, M, P: yes (C, A, D, D, Y - only D is repeated, but D is allowed)
- All letters are from remaining allowed set: yes

Therefore, ""CADDY"" is a valid next guess.

However, ""CADDY"" uses D twice and Y once, but we know Y is in the word. However, ""CADDY"" is C A D D Y, which has A in position 2, C in position 1, Y in position 5, and D in positions 3 and 4. This fits all constraints: A is in position 2, C is in the word (position 1), Y is in the word (position 5), and uses only allowed letters (D is allowed, not ruled out).\n\nBut wait, ""CADDY"" uses D twice, and we haven\'t ruled out D. Let me check if D is allowed - yes, D hasn\'t been used in any guess, so it\'s allowed.\n\nAnother possible word is ""CABBY"" but B is allowed, but we know Y must be in the word (position 5 in CABB Y, but Y is in position 5), but B is allowed. However, ""CABBY"" has B twice, which is fine.\n\nBut ""CADDY"" seems more likely as a common word.\n\nHowever, let me think of other possibilities:\n- ""CABBY"" - C A B B Y\n- ""CADDY"" - C A D D Y\n- ""CAGGY"" - C A G G Y\n- ""CAVY_"" - but V is allowed, but need a 5-letter word ending with Y: CAVY_ - no\n- ""CALYX"" - but X is allowed, but CALYX is a bit obscure\n- ""CAMPY"" - already used\n- ""CANTY"" - but N is out\n- ""CAVILY"" - too long\n- ""CAPSY"" - but P is out\n- ""CARBY"" - but R is out\n- ""CASKY"" - but S is out\n- ""CATTY"" - but T is out\n- ""CATTY"" - T is out\n- ""CATTY"" - T is out\n\nFrom these, ""CADDY"", ""CABBY"", ""CAGGY"" are the most plausible.

We now know:

- Pattern: _ A _ _ _  (A is locked in position 2).
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, T, I, N, M, P, D, B.
- Letters definitely IN the word: A (position 2), C (somewhere), Y (somewhere).

Remaining consonants: F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z  
Remaining vowels: U (only vowel left besides A)

We still need to place C and Y in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5, using only the allowed letters.

Possible placements:
- C in 1: C A _ _ _
- C in 3: _ A C _ _
- C in 4: _ A _ C _
- C in 5: _ A _ _ C

Similarly for Y in 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Let’s look for common 5-letter words fitting _ A _ _ _ with C and Y:

- C A _ _ Y → C A _ _ Y → C A G G Y (CAGGY) – G is allowed, but we already tried CABBY and CADDY, and G is still allowed
- _ A C _ Y → _ A C _ Y → L A C Y _ (LACY) – but LACY is only 4 letters
- _ A _ C Y → _ A _ C Y → L A G C Y (LAGCY) – not a word
- _ A Y _ C → _ A Y _ C → L A Y _ C → L A Y K C (LAYKC) – not a word

The only plausible remaining word seems to be CAGGY, but we already considered it. However, we haven't tried it yet.

Wait, let me re-examine:

Looking at the remaining letters, a valid word could be:

- C A G G Y (CAGGY) – uses C, A, G, G, Y
- _ A C _ Y → no common word
- _ A _ C Y → no common word
- _ A Y _ C → no common word

CAGGY is the only remaining common word that fits all constraints.

Let me verify:
- C A G G Y
- A is in position 2: ✓
- C is in the word (position 1): ✓
- Y is in the word (position 5): ✓
- Letters used: C, A, G, G, Y – none of the ruled-out letters appear.
- All letters are from the allowed set.

Therefore, CAGGY is the next logical guess.
