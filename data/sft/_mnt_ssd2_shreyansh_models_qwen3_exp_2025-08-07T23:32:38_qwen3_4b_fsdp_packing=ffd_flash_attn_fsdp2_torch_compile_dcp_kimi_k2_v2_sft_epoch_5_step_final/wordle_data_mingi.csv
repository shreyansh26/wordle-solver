### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters in the English language. This helps us quickly identify which letters are in the word and which are not. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels.

Common letters in English include: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, U, Y. A word like ""AROSE"" uses 5 of these common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives us good coverage. However, ""AROSE"" has 3 vowels (A, O, E) which might not be optimal for the first guess since we want to test consonants as well.

Another strong candidate is ""RAISE"" (R, A, I, S, E) - but this has 3 vowels and 2 consonants. 

""SLATE"" is also good (S, L, A, T, E) - 3 consonants and 2 vowels. 

""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E) - 2 consonants and 3 vowels.

After considering these, ""AROSE"" seems slightly better as it has more distinct common consonants (R, S) and all vowels except U. However, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess due to its common letters.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess to maximize information gain.

From the two guesses so far:

So the secret word:

- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L.

Remaining common letters: C, D, G, H, K, M, P, Y, plus the vowels we know are absent (A, E, O, U), so only I is confirmed present among vowels; Y can act as a vowel.

- C, H, K are new consonants.
- I is in position 3 (new spot).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters in the English language. This helps us quickly identify which letters are in the word and which are not. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels.

Common letters in English include: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, U, Y. A word like ""AROSE"" uses 5 of these common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives us good coverage. However, ""AROSE"" has 3 vowels (A, O, E) which might not be optimal for the first guess since we want to test consonants as well.

Another strong candidate is ""RAISE"" (R, A, I, S, E) - but this has 3 vowels and 2 consonants. 

""SLATE"" is also good (S, L, A, T, E) - 3 consonants and 2 vowels. 

""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E) - 2 consonants and 3 vowels.

After considering these, ""AROSE"" seems slightly better as it has more distinct common consonants (R, S) and all vowels except U. However, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess due to its common letters.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess to maximize information gain.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates 5 very common letters, so I need a fresh set of consonants and vowels.  
Good remaining high-frequency letters include: T, I, N, L, C, U, D, P, M, Y.  
A balanced word using several of these is “UNTIL” (U, N, T, I, L). It contains two vowels (U, I) and three consonants (N, T, L), none of which were in the first guess. This should give us new information.

From the two guesses so far:

- AROSE → A, R, O, S, E are all absent.
- UNTIL → U, T, L are absent, but N and I are present somewhere in the word, just not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.

So the secret word:
- Contains N and I (but not in positions 2 or 4).
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L.

Remaining common letters: C, D, G, H, K, M, P, Y, plus the vowels we know are absent (A, E, O, U), so only I is confirmed present among vowels; Y can act as a vowel.

Positions to consider:
- N cannot be in position 2.
- I cannot be in position 4.

Let’s pick a word that places N and I in new spots and uses other high-frequency consonants. A good candidate is “CHINK”:
- C, H, K are new consonants.
- I is in position 3 (new spot).
- N is in position 4 (new spot).

Common letters in English include: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, U, Y. A word like ""AROSE"" uses 5 of these common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives us good coverage. However, ""AROSE"" has 3 vowels (A, O, E) which might not be optimal for the first guess since we want to test consonants as well.

From the feedback on Guess 4 (MINDY):

- M is correct in position 1.
- I is correct in position 2.
- N is correct in position 3.
- D and Y are not in the word at all.

So the word is now fully determined except for positions 4 and 5.  
We know the pattern so far: M I N _ _

Letters still available (not yet ruled out):  
B, F, G, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (plus any we missed).  
Among these, common consonants are B, F, G, P, V, W.

We need two more letters that form a valid 5-letter word starting with MIN.  
The most common endings are:

- MINUS (but U is already ruled out)
- MINGO (O is ruled out)
- MINCE (C is ruled out)
- MINDY (Y and D already ruled out)
- MINGE (E is ruled out)
- MINER (E and R are ruled out)
- MINGY (Y is ruled out)
- MINIF (F is available)
- MINIG (G is available)
- MINIP (P is available)

Looking at these, “MINIF” is a valid word (short for minifigure).  
Another possibility is “MINGY”, but Y is already ruled out.  
“MINIP” is also valid but less common.

Between the two, “MINIF” seems the most likely.

So the next guess should be MINIF.

From the latest feedback on MINIF:
- M, I, N are correct in positions 1, 2, 3.
- The fourth letter is I but in the wrong position (it should not be in position 4).
- F is not in the word at all.

So the pattern is now:
M I N _ _

We know the fourth letter cannot be I (from MINIF feedback) and cannot be D, Y, F, C, H, K, T, L, U, A, R, O, S, E.

Remaining possible letters for position 4: B, G, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words starting with MIN and ending with these letters:
- MINUS (U is ruled out)
- MINGO (O is ruled out)
- MINGY (Y is ruled out)
- MINIP (P is available)
- MINIB (B is available)
- MINIG (G is available)
- MINIV (V is available)
- MINIX (X is available)

The most common and likely word here is ""MINGO"", but O is ruled out. Next is ""MINIP"" which is valid. Another strong candidate is ""MINIB"" (short for minibike). 

Between these, ""MINIP"" seems more likely as a standalone word. However, ""MINIB"" is also valid. 

Given the constraints, ""MINIP"" is a good next guess to test P in position 4.
