For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, T, etc. 

One of the most popular starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many English words. This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter that's in the secret word.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it has S, L, A, T, E which are all high-frequency letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's slightly more balanced with different vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1

- O(x) → O is not in the word at all
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: O, E
- Letters that ARE in the word somewhere: A, R, S
- Positions to avoid for those letters:
  – A cannot be in slot 1
  – R cannot be in slot 2
  – S cannot be in slot 4

I want a new word that:
1. Keeps A, R, S
2. Moves them to new positions
3. Adds two new letters that haven’t been ruled out (so not O or E)

Good remaining consonants: T, L, N, D, C, M, P, B, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U

A balanced word that satisfies these constraints is “STRAW”:
- S is now in slot 1 (allowed)
- T is a new letter
- R is now in slot 3 (allowed)
- A is now in slot 2 (allowed)
- W is a new letter

This tests new positions for A, R, S and introduces two fresh letters.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: O, E, T, W  
Letters that ARE in the word somewhere: A, R, S  

Positions we have ruled out so far:
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 4
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 3
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4

Current confirmed facts:
- R is in the word and is in position 3 (from STRAW feedback: R(✓) in slot 3)
- A and S are in the word but must appear elsewhere (not in the positions already ruled out)

So the word looks like: _ _ R _ _

We need two more letters (not O, E, T, W) and must place A and S in the remaining slots while respecting the positional bans.

Remaining consonants that haven’t been ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels that haven’t been ruled out: I, U

We want a word that:
1. Has R in position 3
2. Contains A and S in other positions (not 1 or 4 for A/S)
3. Uses only letters not yet eliminated

Possible positions for A and S:
- A can be in 2 or 5
- S can be in 2 or 5 (but not both in the same two slots)

Let’s try to place A and S in positions 2 and 5, and pick a new consonant for the remaining slot.

Candidate word: B R A S I  → “BRASI” – but this isn’t a valid English word.

Candidate word: C R A S H  → “CRASH” – valid English word, uses C and H (both still allowed), places A in 2, S in 4 (but S cannot be in 4). Invalid.

Candidate word: D R A S H  → same issue with S in 4.

Candidate word: F R A S H  → same issue.

Candidate word: C R A S Y  → “CRASY” – not valid.

Candidate word: S C R A P  → “SCRAP” – but R must be in position 3, not 2.

Candidate word: S P R A K  → “SPRAK” – not valid.

Candidate word: L A R S E  → “LARSE” – not valid.

Candidate word: C A R S I  → “CARS I” – not valid.

Candidate word: N A R S I  → “NARSI” – not valid.

Candidate word: P A R S E  → “PARSE” – but E is eliminated.

Candidate word: M A R S H  → “MARCH” – but H is okay, and this places:
- M (new)
- A in 2 (allowed)
- R in 3 (correct)
- C (new)
- H (new)
This uses M, A, R, C, H – all allowed letters.

Let me check: M A R C H – positions:
- A in 2 (allowed)
- R in 3 (correct)
- S is missing – but we need S somewhere.

Oops, “MARCH” doesn’t contain S, which we know must be in the word. So discard.

Candidate word: C R A S P  → “CRASP” – not valid.

Candidate word: C R A S S  → “CRASS” – valid, but S appears twice, and we don’t know if S appears twice. Also S in 4 is banned.

Candidate word: C R A S Y  → “CRASY” – invalid.

Candidate word: C R A S K  → “CRASK” – invalid.

Candidate word: C R A S H  → again S in 4 banned.

Candidate word: C R A S E  → “CRASE” – E banned.

Candidate word: C R A S I  → “CRASI” – invalid.

Candidate word: C R A S D  → “CRAS D” – invalid.

Candidate word: C R A S B  → “CRASB” – invalid.

Candidate word: C R A S K  → already considered.

Candidate word: C R A S M  → “CRASM” – invalid.

Candidate word: C R A S N  → “CRASN” – invalid.

Candidate word: C R A S P  → already considered.

Candidate word: C R A S Y  → already considered.

Candidate word: C R A S Z  → “CRASZ” – invalid.

Hmm, seems like placing R in 3 and needing A and S in the remaining slots is tricky.

Alternative: place A in 5 and S in 2.

Candidate word: S C R A N  → “SCRAN” – valid (archaic for “scrap”, but accepted in some dictionaries).

Check letters:
- S in 1 – but S cannot be in 1 (from AROSE feedback: S(-) meaning S not in 4, but no ban on 1). Wait, AROSE had S in 4 (-), so S can be in 1, 2, 3, 5. From STRAW had S in 1 (-), so S cannot be in 1. Therefore S cannot be in 1 or 4. So S must be in 2 or 5.

Thus for S: positions 2 or 5.

For A: positions 2 or 5 (cannot be 1 or 4).

So possible pairs:
- S in 2 and A in 5
- S in 5 and A in 2

Let’s try S in 2 and A in 5.

Word structure: _ S R _ A

We need two more letters (not O, E, T, W) for positions 1 and 4.

Candidate word: B S R C A – invalid.

Candidate word: C S R I A – invalid.

Candidate word: D S R I A – invalid.

Candidate word: F S R I A – invalid.

Candidate word: G S R I A – invalid.

Candidate word: H S R I A – invalid.

Candidate word: L S R I A – invalid.

Candidate word: M S R I A – invalid.

Candidate word: N S R I A – invalid.

Candidate word: P S R I A – invalid.

Candidate word: V S R I A – invalid.

Candidate word: Y S R I A – invalid.

Candidate word: Z S R I A – invalid.

None valid.

Try S in 5 and A in 2.

Word structure: _ A R _ S

We need letters for positions 1 and 4 (not O, E, T, W).

Candidate word: B A R C S – “BARCS” – invalid.

Candidate word: C A R B S – “CARBS” – valid English word!

Check:
- C (new)
- A in 2 (allowed)
- R in 3 (correct)
- B (new)
- S in 5 (allowed)

All letters: C, A, R, B, S – none are banned (O, E, T, W are banned, others are allowed).

This seems valid.

Let me verify:
- CARBS: C, A, R, B, S
- A is in 2 (not 1 or 4) – ok
- R is in 3 (correct) – ok
- S is in 5 (not 1 or 4) – ok
- B and C are new letters – ok

Therefore, “CARBS” is a valid next guess.

Alternative: place A in 5 and S in 2.

Candidate word: S C R A N  → “SCRAN” – valid (archaic for “scrap”, but accepted in some dictionaries).

Check letters:
- S in 1 – but S cannot be in 1 (from AROSE feedback: S(-) meaning S not in 4, but no ban on 1). Wait, AROSE had S in 4 (-), so S can be in 1, 2, 3, 5. From STRAW had S in 1 (-), so S cannot be in 1. Therefore S cannot be in 1 or 4. So S must be in 2 or 5.

Thus for S: positions 2 or 5.

For A: positions 2 or 5 (cannot be 1 or 4).

So possible pairs:
- S in 2 and A in 5
- S in 5 and A in 2

Let’s try S in 2 and A in 5.

Word structure: _ S R _ A

We need two more letters (not O, E, T, W) for positions 1 and 4.

Candidate word: B S R C A – invalid.

- B (new)
- S in 5 (allowed)

All letters: C, A, R, B, S – none are banned (O, E, T, W are banned, others are allowed).

This seems valid.

Let me verify:
- CARBS: C, A, R, B, S
- A is in 2 (not 1 or 4) – ok
- R is in 3 (correct) – ok
- S is in 5 (not 1 or 4) – ok

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, T, etc. 

One of the most popular starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many English words. This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter that's in the secret word.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it has S, L, A, T, E which are all high-frequency letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's slightly more balanced with different vowels and consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: O, E
- Letters that ARE in the word somewhere: A, R, S
- Positions to avoid for those letters:
  – A cannot be in slot 1
  – R cannot be in slot 2
  – S cannot be in slot 4

I want a new word that:
1. Keeps A, R, S
2. Moves them to new positions
3. Adds two new letters that haven’t been ruled out (so not O or E)

Good remaining consonants: T, L, N, D, C, M, P, B, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U

A balanced word that satisfies these constraints is “STRAW”:
- S is now in slot 1 (allowed)
- T is a new letter
- R is now in slot 3 (allowed)
- A is now in slot 2 (allowed)
- W is a new letter

This tests new positions for A, R, S and introduces two fresh letters.

Guess 2: STRAW -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) R(✓) A(-) W(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: O, E, T, W  
Letters that ARE in the word somewhere: A, R, S  

Positions we have ruled out so far:
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 4
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 3
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4

Current confirmed facts:
- R is in the word and is in position 3 (from STRAW feedback: R(✓) in slot 3)
- A and S are in the word but must appear elsewhere (not in the positions already ruled out)

So the word looks like: _ _ R _ _

We need two more letters (not O, E, T, W) and must place A and S in the remaining slots while respecting the positional bans.

Remaining consonants that haven’t been ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels that haven’t been ruled out: I, U

We want a word that:
1. Has R in position 3
2. Contains A and S in other positions (not 1 or 4 for A/S)
3. Uses only letters not yet eliminated

Possible positions for A and S:
- A can be in 2 or 5
- S can be in 2 or 5 (but not both in the same two slots)

Let’s try to place A and S in positions 2 and 5, and pick a new consonant for the remaining slot.

Candidate word: B R A S I  → “BRASI” – but this isn’t a valid English word.

Candidate word: C R A S H  → “CRASH” – valid English word, uses C and H (both still allowed), places A in 2, S in 4 (but S cannot be in 4). Invalid.

Candidate word: D R A S H  → same issue with S in 4.

Candidate word: F R A S H  → same issue.

Candidate word: C R A S Y  → “CRASY” – not valid.

Candidate word: S C R A P  → “SCRAP” – but R must be in position 3, not 2.

Candidate word: S P R A K  → “SPRAK” – not valid.

Candidate word: L A R S E  → “LARSE” – not valid.

Candidate word: C A R S I  → “CARS I” – not valid.

Candidate word: N A R S I  → “NARSI” – not valid.

Candidate word: P A R S E  → “PARSE” – but E is eliminated.

Candidate word: M A R S H  → “MARCH” – but H is okay, and this places:
- M (new)
- A in 2 (allowed)
- R in 3 (correct)
- C (new)
- H (new)
This uses M, A, R, C, H – all allowed letters.

Let me check: M A R C H – positions:
- A in 2 (allowed)
- R in 3 (correct)
- S is missing – but we need S somewhere.

Oops, “MARCH” doesn’t contain S, which we know must be in the word. So discard.

Candidate word: C R A S P  → “CRASP” – not valid.

Candidate word: C R A S S  → “CRASS” – valid, but S appears twice, and we don’t know if S appears twice. Also S in 4 is banned.

Candidate word: C R A S Y  → “CRASY” – invalid.

- S in 1 – but S cannot be in 1 (from AROSE feedback: S(-) meaning S not in 4, but no ban on 1). Wait, AROSE had S in 4 (-), so S can be in 1, 2, 3, 5. From STRAW had S in 1 (-), so S cannot be in 1. Therefore S cannot be in 1 or 4. So S must be in 2 or 5.

Thus for S: positions 2 or 5.

For A: positions 2 or 5 (cannot be 1 or 4).

- S in 5 and A in 2

Let’s try S in 2 and A in 5.

- B (new)
- S in 5 (allowed)

All letters: C, A, R, B, S – none are banned (O, E, T, W are banned, others are allowed).

Let me verify:

- A is in 2 (not 1 or 4) – ok
- R is in 3 (correct) – ok

Available letters (common ones first): D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z, plus the already-placed A, R, S.

We want a valid 5-letter English word matching the pattern _ A R _ S.

Let’s list possible candidates:
- D A R L S – “DARLS” – invalid
- F A R M S – “FARMS” – valid
- G A R B S – but B is banned
- H A R P S – “HARPS” – valid
- J A R V S – invalid
- K A R V S – invalid
- L A R G S – invalid
- M A R K S – “MARKS” – valid
- N A R K S – “NARKS” – valid
- P A R K S – “PARKS” – valid
- V A R K S – invalid
- Y A R D S – “YARDS” – valid (but has D in 4, Y in 1)
- Z A R P S – invalid

Among these, “FARMS”, “HARPS”, “MARKS”, “NARKS”, “PARKS”, “YARDS” are all valid English words.  
I’ll choose “FARMS” because F and M are common consonants and haven’t been ruled out.

Pattern check:
- F (new) in 1
- A in 2 (correct)
- R in 3 (correct)
- M (new) in 4
- S in 5 (correct)

All letters are allowed (none from banned list).",Guess 4: FARMS -> FEEDBACK: F(x) A(✓) R(✓) M(x) S(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, T, etc. 

One of the most popular starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many English words. This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter that's in the secret word.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it has S, L, A, T, E which are all high-frequency letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's slightly more balanced with different vowels and consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: O, E
- Letters that ARE in the word somewhere: A, R, S
- Positions to avoid for those letters:
  – A cannot be in slot 1
  – R cannot be in slot 2
  – S cannot be in slot 4

I want a new word that:
1. Keeps A, R, S
2. Moves them to new positions
3. Adds two new letters that haven’t been ruled out (so not O or E)

Good remaining consonants: T, L, N, D, C, M, P, B, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U

A balanced word that satisfies these constraints is “STRAW”:
- S is now in slot 1 (allowed)
- T is a new letter
- R is now in slot 3 (allowed)
- A is now in slot 2 (allowed)
- W is a new letter

This tests new positions for A, R, S and introduces two fresh letters.

Guess 2: STRAW -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) R(✓) A(-) W(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: O, E, T, W  
Letters that ARE in the word somewhere: A, R, S  

Positions we have ruled out so far:
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 4
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 3
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4

Current confirmed facts:
- R is in the word and is in position 3 (from STRAW feedback: R(✓) in slot 3)
- A and S are in the word but must appear elsewhere (not in the positions already ruled out)

So the word looks like: _ _ R _ _

We need two more letters (not O, E, T, W) and must place A and S in the remaining slots while respecting the positional bans.

Remaining consonants that haven’t been ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels that haven’t been ruled out: I, U

We want a word that:
1. Has R in position 3
2. Contains A and S in other positions (not 1 or 4 for A/S)
3. Uses only letters not yet eliminated

Possible positions for A and S:
- A can be in 2 or 5
- S can be in 2 or 5 (but not both in the same two slots)

Let’s try to place A and S in positions 2 and 5, and pick a new consonant for the remaining slot.

Candidate word: B R A S I  → “BRASI” – but this isn’t a valid English word.

Candidate word: C R A S H  → “CRASH” – valid English word, uses C and H (both still allowed), places A in 2, S in 4 (but S cannot be in 4). Invalid.

Candidate word: D R A S H  → same issue with S in 4.

Candidate word: F R A S H  → same issue.

Candidate word: C R A S Y  → “CRASY” – not valid.

Candidate word: S C R A P  → “SCRAP” – but R must be in position 3, not 2.

Candidate word: S P R A K  → “SPRAK” – not valid.

Candidate word: L A R S E  → “LARSE” – not valid.

Candidate word: C A R S I  → “CARS I” – not valid.

Candidate word: N A R S I  → “NARSI” – not valid.

Candidate word: P A R S E  → “PARSE” – but E is eliminated.

Candidate word: M A R S H  → “MARCH” – but H is okay, and this places:
- M (new)
- A in 2 (allowed)
- R in 3 (correct)
- C (new)
- H (new)
This uses M, A, R, C, H – all allowed letters.

Let me check: M A R C H – positions:
- A in 2 (allowed)
- R in 3 (correct)
- S is missing – but we need S somewhere.

Oops, “MARCH” doesn’t contain S, which we know must be in the word. So discard.

Candidate word: C R A S P  → “CRASP” – not valid.

Candidate word: C R A S S  → “CRASS” – valid, but S appears twice, and we don’t know if S appears twice. Also S in 4 is banned.

Candidate word: C R A S Y  → “CRASY” – invalid.

Candidate word: C R A S K  → “CRASK” – invalid.

Candidate word: C R A S H  → again S in 4 banned.

Candidate word: C R A S E  → “CRASE” – E banned.

Candidate word: C R A S I  → “CRASI” – invalid.

Candidate word: C R A S D  → “CRAS D” – invalid.

Candidate word: C R A S B  → “CRASB” – invalid.

Candidate word: C R A S G  → “CRASG” – invalid.

Candidate word: C R A S F  → “CRASF” – invalid.

Candidate word: C R A S V  → “CRASV” – invalid.

Candidate word: C R A S K  → already considered.

Candidate word: C R A S M  → “CRASM” – invalid.

Candidate word: C R A S N  → “CRASN” – invalid.

Candidate word: C R A S P  → already considered.

Candidate word: C R A S Y  → already considered.

Candidate word: C R A S Z  → “CRASZ” – invalid.

Hmm, seems like placing R in 3 and needing A and S in the remaining slots is tricky.

Alternative: place A in 5 and S in 2.

Candidate word: S C R A N  → “SCRAN” – valid (archaic for “scrap”, but accepted in some dictionaries).

Check letters:
- S in 1 – but S cannot be in 1 (from AROSE feedback: S(-) meaning S not in 4, but no ban on 1). Wait, AROSE had S in 4 (-), so S can be in 1, 2, 3, 5. From STRAW had S in 1 (-), so S cannot be in 1. Therefore S cannot be in 1 or 4. So S must be in 2 or 5.

Thus for S: positions 2 or 5.

For A: positions 2 or 5 (cannot be 1 or 4).

So possible pairs:
- S in 2 and A in 5
- S in 5 and A in 2

Let’s try S in 2 and A in 5.

Word structure: _ S R _ A

We need two more letters (not O, E, T, W) for positions 1 and 4.

Candidate word: B S R C A – invalid.

Candidate word: C S R I A – invalid.

Candidate word: D S R I A – invalid.

Candidate word: F S R I A – invalid.

Candidate word: G S R I A – invalid.

Candidate word: H S R I A – invalid.

Candidate word: L S R I A – invalid.

Candidate word: M S R I A – invalid.

Candidate word: N S R I A – invalid.

Candidate word: P S R I A – invalid.

Candidate word: V S R I A – invalid.

Candidate word: Y S R I A – invalid.

Candidate word: Z S R I A – invalid.

None valid.

Try S in 5 and A in 2.

Word structure: _ A R _ S

We need letters for positions 1 and 4 (not O, E, T, W).

Candidate word: B A R C S – “BARCS” – invalid.

Candidate word: C A R B S – “CARBS” – valid English word!

Check:
- C (new)
- A in 2 (allowed)
- R in 3 (correct)
- B (new)
- S in 5 (allowed)

All letters: C, A, R, B, S – none are banned (O, E, T, W are banned, others are allowed).

This seems valid.

Let me verify:
- CARBS: C, A, R, B, S
- A is in 2 (not 1 or 4) – ok
- R is in 3 (correct) – ok
- S is in 5 (not 1 or 4) – ok
- B and C are new letters – ok

Therefore, “CARBS” is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, T, etc. 

One of the most popular starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many English words. This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter that's in the secret word.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it has S, L, A, T, E which are all high-frequency letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's slightly more balanced with different vowels and consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: O, E
- Letters that ARE in the word somewhere: A, R, S
- Positions to avoid for those letters:
  – A cannot be in slot 1
  – R cannot be in slot 2
  – S cannot be in slot 4

I want a new word that:
1. Keeps A, R, S
2. Moves them to new positions
3. Adds two new letters that haven’t been ruled out (so not O or E)

Good remaining consonants: T, L, N, D, C, M, P, B, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U

A balanced word that satisfies these constraints is “STRAW”:
- S is now in slot 1 (allowed)
- T is a new letter
- R is now in slot 3 (allowed)
- A is now in slot 2 (allowed)
- W is a new letter

This tests new positions for A, R, S and introduces two fresh letters.

Guess 2: STRAW -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) R(✓) A(-) W(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: O, E, T, W  
Letters that ARE in the word somewhere: A, R, S  

Positions we have ruled out so far:
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 4
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 3
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4

Current confirmed facts:
- R is in the word and is in position 3 (from STRAW feedback: R(✓) in slot 3)
- A and S are in the word but must appear elsewhere (not in the positions already ruled out)

So the word looks like: _ _ R _ _

We need two more letters (not O, E, T, W) and must place A and S in the remaining slots while respecting the positional bans.

Remaining consonants that haven’t been ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels that haven’t been ruled out: I, U

We want a word that:
1. Has R in position 3
2. Contains A and S in other positions (not 1 or 4 for A/S)
3. Uses only letters not yet eliminated

Possible positions for A and S:
- A can be in 2 or 5
- S can be in 2 or 5 (but not both in the same two slots)

Let’s try to place A and S in positions 2 and 5, and pick a new consonant for the remaining slot.

Candidate word: B R A S I  → “BRASI” – but this isn’t a valid English word.

Candidate word: C R A S H  → “CRASH” – valid English word, uses C and H (both still allowed), places A in 2, S in 4 (but S cannot be in 4). Invalid.

Candidate word: D R A S H  → same issue with S in 4.

Candidate word: F R A S H  → same issue.

Candidate word: C R A S Y  → “CRASY” – not valid.

Candidate word: S C R A P  → “SCRAP” – but R must be in position 3, not 2.

Candidate word: S P R A K  → “SPRAK” – not valid.

Candidate word: L A R S E  → “LARSE” – not valid.

Candidate word: C A R S I  → “CARS I” – not valid.

Candidate word: N A R S I  → “NARSI” – not valid.

Candidate word: P A R S E  → “PARSE” – but E is eliminated.

Candidate word: M A R S H  → “MARCH” – but H is okay, and this places:
- M (new)
- A in 2 (allowed)
- R in 3 (correct)
- C (new)
- H (new)
This uses M, A, R, C, H – all allowed letters.

Let me check: M A R C H – positions:
- A in 2 (allowed)
- R in 3 (correct)
- S is missing – but we need S somewhere.

Oops, “MARCH” doesn’t contain S, which we know must be in the word. So discard.

Candidate word: C R A S P  → “CRASP” – not valid.

Candidate word: C R A S S  → “CRASS” – valid, but S appears twice, and we don’t know if S appears twice. Also S in 4 is banned.

Candidate word: C R A S Y  → “CRASY” – invalid.

Candidate word: C R A S K  → “CRASK” – invalid.

Candidate word: C R A S H  → again S in 4 banned.

Candidate word: C R A S E  → “CRASE” – E banned.

Candidate word: C R A S I  → “CRASI” – invalid.

Candidate word: C R A S D  → “CRAS D” – invalid.

Candidate word: C R A S B  → “CRASB” – invalid.

Candidate word: C R A S G  → “CRASG” – invalid.

Candidate word: C R A S F  → “CRASF” – invalid.

Candidate word: C R A S V  → “CRASV” – invalid.

Candidate word: C R A S K  → already considered.

Candidate word: C R A S M  → “CRASM” – invalid.

Candidate word: C R A S N  → “CRASN” – invalid.

Candidate word: C R A S P  → already considered.

Candidate word: C R A S Y  → already considered.

Candidate word: C R A S Z  → “CRASZ” – invalid.

Hmm, seems like placing R in 3 and needing A and S in the remaining slots is tricky.

Alternative: place A in 5 and S in 2.

Candidate word: S C R A N  → “SCRAN” – valid (archaic for “scrap”, but accepted in some dictionaries).

Check letters:
- S in 1 – but S cannot be in 1 (from AROSE feedback: S(-) meaning S not in 4, but no ban on 1). Wait, AROSE had S in 4 (-), so S can be in 1, 2, 3, 5. From STRAW had S in 1 (-), so S cannot be in 1. Therefore S cannot be in 1 or 4. So S must be in 2 or 5.

Thus for S: positions 2 or 5.

For A: positions 2 or 5 (cannot be 1 or 4).

So possible pairs:
- S in 2 and A in 5
- S in 5 and A in 2

Let’s try S in 2 and A in 5.

Word structure: _ S R _ A

We need two more letters (not O, E, T, W) for positions 1 and 4.

Candidate word: B S R C A – invalid.

Candidate word: C S R I A – invalid.

Candidate word: D S R I A – invalid.

Candidate word: F S R I A – invalid.

Candidate word: G S R I A – invalid.

Candidate word: H S R I A – invalid.

Candidate word: L S R I A – invalid.

Candidate word: M S R I A – invalid.

Candidate word: N S R I A – invalid.

Candidate word: P S R I A – invalid.

Candidate word: V S R I A – invalid.

Candidate word: Y S R I A – invalid.

Candidate word: Z S R I A – invalid.

None valid.

Try S in 5 and A in 2.

Word structure: _ A R _ S

We need letters for positions 1 and 4 (not O, E, T, W).

Candidate word: B A R C S – “BARCS” – invalid.

Candidate word: C A R B S – “CARBS” – valid English word!

Check:
- C (new)
- A in 2 (allowed)
- R in 3 (correct)
- B (new)
- S in 5 (allowed)

All letters: C, A, R, B, S – none are banned (O, E, T, W are banned, others are allowed).

This seems valid.

Let me verify:
- CARBS: C, A, R, B, S
- A is in 2 (not 1 or 4) – ok
- R is in 3 (correct) – ok
- S is in 5 (not 1 or 4) – ok
- B and C are new letters – ok

Therefore, “CARBS” is a valid next guess.

Available letters (common ones first): D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z, plus the already-placed A, R, S.
