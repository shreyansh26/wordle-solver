### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives me a good chance to hit multiple letters in the word while avoiding less common letters. I'll go with AROSE as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is in the word and in position 2.
- O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word and in position 5.

So the pattern so far is: _ R _ _ E
Letters we know are in the word: A, R, O, E
Letters we know are NOT in the word: S

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has R in position 2.
2. Has E in position 5.
3. Contains A and O somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (but not in the positions they were in before: A not in 1, O not in 3).
4. Does not contain S.

Possible positions for A and O:
- A can be in 3 or 4.
- O can be in 1 or 4.

Let me think of words that fit _ R _ _ E with A and O:
- ORATE: O in 1, R in 2, A in 3, T in 4, E in 5. This fits all constraints.
- AROSE was invalid because S is excluded, but ORATE has no S.
- Other possibilities like ""ROATE"" or ""PROBE"" don't fit the constraints.

ORATE seems valid and uses the known letters efficiently.
