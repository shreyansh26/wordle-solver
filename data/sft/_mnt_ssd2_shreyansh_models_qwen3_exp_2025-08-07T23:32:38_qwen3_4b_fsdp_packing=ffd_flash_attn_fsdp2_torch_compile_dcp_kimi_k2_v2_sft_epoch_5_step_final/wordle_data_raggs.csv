For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best starting words often include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E - covers common consonants and vowels.
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E - another strong set of letters.
- ""AROSE"" has A, R, O, S, E - includes three vowels and two common consonants.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a good balance of vowels and consonants, and the letters A, O, E are very common in English words.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (not second).
- O is not in the word.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not fourth).
- E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, S.
- Does NOT contain O, E.
- A is not in position 1.
- R is not in position 2.
- S is not in position 4.

We need a new 5-letter word that includes A, R, S, avoids O and E, and respects the positional constraints.

Possible next guesses could be:
- STARE (but E is excluded)
- RASPY (but Y is uncommon)
- CRASH (but C is untested, H is uncommon)
- TRASH (T, R, A, S, H - H is uncommon)
- GRASP (G, R, A, S, P - G and P are less common)
- FARMS (F, A, R, M, S - F and M are less common)
- DRASL (not a valid word)

A better choice is ""STARS"" - but it repeats S.
Another is ""STRAP"" - but P is uncommon.
""CRASH"" uses C and H which are less common.
""TRASH"" is better, but H is still uncommon.
""GRASP"" is reasonable, but G is uncommon.

A better option is ""CRASS"" - but it repeats S and S is already in word.
""PARST"" is not a word.
""RAPID"" has D and I - but D is less common.

After considering, ""STRAP"" is valid but P is uncommon.
""CRISP"" has C and P - both uncommon.
""GRASP"" is acceptable but G is uncommon.

Actually, ""CRASH"" is a valid word and uses C and H which are common enough, but let's think of another.

""DRATS"" - D, R, A, T, S - all letters are either R, A, S or new letters D and T.
This seems good as it introduces D and T while keeping R, A, S.

But let's check:
- D is new, T is new.
- R is in position 2 (but feedback says R is not in position 2) - so DRATS is invalid.

Next option: ""TRASH"" - T, R, A, S, H.
- R is in position 2 - again invalid.

""ARSON"" - but O is excluded.

""RAINS"" - but E is excluded, and N is new.
- A is in position 1 - but feedback says A is not in position 1 - invalid.

""RAISE"" - E is excluded.

""SCRAP"" - C is new, P is new.
- A is in position 3 (allowed), R in position 2 (invalid), S in position 1 (allowed).

""SCRAP"" is invalid due to R in position 2.

""SCRAN"" - C, R, A, N - but S is in position 1 (allowed), R in position 2 (invalid).

""SCRAP"" is invalid.

""SCRUB"" - but B is new, U is new, but we already have A, R, S constraints.

Actually, let's list possible positions for A, R, S:
- A cannot be in position 1.
- R cannot be in position 2.
- S cannot be in position 4.

Possible positions:
A: 2,3,4,5
R: 1,3,4,5
S: 1,2,3,5

Let's try ""STARS"" - but S is in position 1 and 4 (invalid for 4).
""STAR"" is 4 letters.

""STARE"" - E excluded.

""STARK"" - K is new, valid word.
Check positions:
S:1 (allowed), T:2, A:3 (allowed), R:4 (allowed), K:5.
This seems valid.

""STARK"" is a good choice - introduces T and K, keeps A, R, S in allowed positions.

Let’s try to place A, R, S in the still-allowed spots and pick two new letters.

One promising pattern:  
Put A in position 2, R in position 1, S in position 5 → R A _ _ S  
We need two letters for positions 3 and 4.  
C and N are common and unused → R A C N S (but RACNS isn’t a word).  
Swap to R A C I S – still not valid.  
How about R A D I S? That’s a real word.

Check constraints:
- R in position 1 – allowed.  
- A in position 2 – allowed.  
- D and I are new letters.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best starting words often include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E - covers common consonants and vowels.
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E - another strong set of letters.
- ""AROSE"" has A, R, O, S, E - includes three vowels and two common consonants.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a good balance of vowels and consonants, and the letters A, O, E are very common in English words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (not second).
- O is not in the word.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not fourth).
- E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, S.
- Does NOT contain O, E.
- A is not in position 1.
- R is not in position 2.
- S is not in position 4.

We need a new 5-letter word that includes A, R, S, avoids O and E, and respects the positional constraints.

Possible next guesses could be:
- STARE (but E is excluded)
- RASPY (but Y is uncommon)
- CRASH (but C is untested, H is uncommon)
- TRASH (T, R, A, S, H - H is uncommon)
- GRASP (G, R, A, S, P - G and P are less common)
- FARMS (F, A, R, M, S - F and M are less common)
- DRASL (not a valid word)

A better choice is ""STARS"" - but it repeats S.
Another is ""STRAP"" - but P is uncommon.
""CRASH"" uses C and H which are less common.
""TRASH"" is better, but H is still uncommon.
""GRASP"" is reasonable, but G is uncommon.

A better option is ""CRASS"" - but it repeats S and S is already in word.
""PARST"" is not a word.
""RAPID"" has D and I - but D is less common.

After considering, ""STRAP"" is valid but P is uncommon.
""CRISP"" has C and P - both uncommon.
""GRASP"" is acceptable but G is uncommon.

Actually, ""CRASH"" is a valid word and uses C and H which are common enough, but let's think of another.

""DRATS"" - D, R, A, T, S - all letters are either R, A, S or new letters D and T.
This seems good as it introduces D and T while keeping R, A, S.

But let's check:
- D is new, T is new.
- R is in position 2 (but feedback says R is not in position 2) - so DRATS is invalid.

Next option: ""TRASH"" - T, R, A, S, H.
- R is in position 2 - again invalid.

""ARSON"" - but O is excluded.

""RAINS"" - but E is excluded, and N is new.
- A is in position 1 - but feedback says A is not in position 1 - invalid.

""RAISE"" - E is excluded.

""SCRAP"" - C is new, P is new.
- A is in position 3 (allowed), R in position 2 (invalid), S in position 1 (allowed).

""SCRAP"" is invalid due to R in position 2.

""SCRAN"" - C, R, A, N - but S is in position 1 (allowed), R in position 2 (invalid).

""SCRAP"" is invalid.

""SCRUB"" - but B is new, U is new, but we already have A, R, S constraints.

Actually, let's list possible positions for A, R, S:
- A cannot be in position 1.
- R cannot be in position 2.
- S cannot be in position 4.

Possible positions:
A: 2,3,4,5
R: 1,3,4,5
S: 1,2,3,5

Let's try ""STARS"" - but S is in position 1 and 4 (invalid for 4).
""STAR"" is 4 letters.

""STARE"" - E excluded.

""STARK"" - K is new, valid word.
Check positions:
S:1 (allowed), T:2, A:3 (allowed), R:4 (allowed), K:5.
This seems valid.

""STARK"" is a good choice - introduces T and K, keeps A, R, S in allowed positions.

Letters in the word: A, R, S  
Letters NOT in the word: O, E, T, K  

Positions ruled out so far:
- A cannot be in position 1 (AROSE) or position 3 (STARK).
- R cannot be in position 2 (AROSE) or position 4 (STARK).
- S cannot be in position 4 (AROSE) or position 1 (STARK).

So the remaining valid positions are:
A: 2, 4, 5  
R: 1, 3, 5  
S: 2, 3, 5  

We still need two more distinct letters (since the word has only A, R, S so far).  
Good consonants not yet tried include C, D, L, N, P, etc.

Let’s try to place A, R, S in the still-allowed spots and pick two new letters.

One promising pattern:  
Put A in position 2, R in position 1, S in position 5 → R A _ _ S  
We need two letters for positions 3 and 4.  
C and N are common and unused → R A C N S (but RACNS isn’t a word).  
Swap to R A C I S – still not valid.  
How about R A D I S? That’s a real word.

Check constraints:
- R in position 1 – allowed.  
- A in position 2 – allowed.  
- D and I are new letters.  
- S in position 5 – allowed.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best starting words often include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E - covers common consonants and vowels.
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E - another strong set of letters.
- ""AROSE"" has A, R, O, S, E - includes three vowels and two common consonants.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a good balance of vowels and consonants, and the letters A, O, E are very common in English words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (not second).
- O is not in the word.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not fourth).
- E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, S.
- Does NOT contain O, E.
- A is not in position 1.
- R is not in position 2.
- S is not in position 4.

We need a new 5-letter word that includes A, R, S, avoids O and E, and respects the positional constraints.

Possible next guesses could be:
- STARE (but E is excluded)
- RASPY (but Y is uncommon)
- CRASH (but C is untested, H is uncommon)
- TRASH (T, R, A, S, H - H is uncommon)
- GRASP (G, R, A, S, P - G and P are less common)
- FARMS (F, A, R, M, S - F and M are less common)
- DRASL (not a valid word)

A better choice is ""STARS"" - but it repeats S.
Another is ""STRAP"" - but P is uncommon.
""CRASH"" uses C and H which are less common.
""TRASH"" is better, but H is still uncommon.
""GRASP"" is reasonable, but G is uncommon.

A better option is ""CRASS"" - but it repeats S and S is already in word.
""PARST"" is not a word.
""RAPID"" has D and I - but D is less common.

After considering, ""STRAP"" is valid but P is uncommon.
""CRISP"" has C and P - both uncommon.
""GRASP"" is acceptable but G is uncommon.

Actually, ""CRASH"" is a valid word and uses C and H which are common enough, but let's think of another.

""DRATS"" - D, R, A, T, S - all letters are either R, A, S or new letters D and T.
This seems good as it introduces D and T while keeping R, A, S.

But let's check:
- D is new, T is new.
- R is in position 2 (but feedback says R is not in position 2) - so DRATS is invalid.

Next option: ""TRASH"" - T, R, A, S, H.
- R is in position 2 - again invalid.

""ARSON"" - but O is excluded.

""RAINS"" - but E is excluded, and N is new.
- A is in position 1 - but feedback says A is not in position 1 - invalid.

""RAISE"" - E is excluded.

""SCRAP"" - C is new, P is new.
- A is in position 3 (allowed), R in position 2 (invalid), S in position 1 (allowed).

""SCRAP"" is invalid due to R in position 2.

""SCRAN"" - C, R, A, N - but S is in position 1 (allowed), R in position 2 (invalid).

""SCRAP"" is invalid.

""SCRUB"" - but B is new, U is new, but we already have A, R, S constraints.

Actually, let's list possible positions for A, R, S:
- A cannot be in position 1.
- R cannot be in position 2.
- S cannot be in position 4.

Possible positions:
A: 2,3,4,5
R: 1,3,4,5
S: 1,2,3,5

Let's try ""STARS"" - but S is in position 1 and 4 (invalid for 4).
""STAR"" is 4 letters.

""STARE"" - E excluded.

""STARK"" - K is new, valid word.
Check positions:
S:1 (allowed), T:2, A:3 (allowed), R:4 (allowed), K:5.
This seems valid.

""STARK"" is a good choice - introduces T and K, keeps A, R, S in allowed positions.

We now know the word must be R A _ _ S, and the letters in positions 3 and 4 cannot be any of:  
O, E, T, K, D, I, N, C, H, M, U.

Remaining unused common letters:  
B, F, G, J, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two distinct letters from that set to fill positions 3 and 4, forming a valid 5-letter English word.

Looking for real words that fit R A _ _ S with those letters:

- R A B _ S → “RABBS” (invalid), “RABYS” (invalid)  
- R A F _ S → “RAFES” (E excluded), “RAFOS” (O excluded)  
- R A G _ S → “RAGAS” (A repeated, invalid), “RAGUS” (U excluded)  
- R A J _ S → “RAJIS” (I excluded)  
- R A L _ S → “RALLY” (Y is allowed, but it’s 5 letters and ends in Y, not S)  
- R A P _ S → “RAPHS” (H excluded), “RAPSS” (invalid)  
- R A V _ S → “RAVES” (E excluded)  
- R A W _ S → “RAWLS” (L and S, but S is already fixed at position 5)  
- R A Y _ S → “RAYGS” (invalid), “RAYLS” (invalid)  
- R A Z _ S → “RAZMS” (M excluded)

The only remaining valid word that fits R A _ _ S and uses allowed letters is “RAGAS,” but A is already in position 2 and can’t repeat.  
Wait, let’s double-check: “RAGAS” is actually a valid word (plural of “raga” in Indian classical music), but it repeats A, which is already in position 2.  
However, the rules don’t forbid letter repetition unless explicitly stated. Let me verify: the feedback never indicated any restriction on letter repetition, and no prior guess had repeated letters. So “RAGAS” is possible.

But let me think of another: “RAGAS” is the only one left.  
Another possibility: “RAGAS” is acceptable.

However, let me check if there are others:  
“RAGAS” seems to be the only valid word left that fits R A _ _ S with allowed letters.

Therefore, the next guess is “RAGAS.”
