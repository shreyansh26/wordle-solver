### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and which are not.

Common letters in English include: A, E, T, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U, M, W, F, G, Y, P, B, V, K, J, X, Q, Z.

A popular and effective first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (common)
- O (common)
- S (common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common vowels and consonants to start narrowing down possibilities.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and which are not.

Common letters in English include: A, E, T, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U, M, W, F, G, Y, P, B, V, K, J, X, Q, Z.

A popular and effective first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (common)
- O (common)
- S (common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common vowels and consonants to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So we know:
- Letters definitely not in the word: A, O, S
- Letters definitely in the word: R, E
- R cannot be in position 2
- E cannot be in position 5

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R and E
2. Does not contain A, O, S
3. Has R not in position 2
4. Has E not in position 5

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and O are out)

Let's try a word like ""RENT"" but it's only 4 letters. We need 5.

A good candidate is ""TREND"":
- Contains R and E
- Does not contain A, O, S
- R is in position 2 (but feedback says R is not in position 2, so this is invalid)

Next candidate: ""PERCH"":
- Contains P, E, R, C, H
- No A, O, S
- R is in position 3 (valid since position 2 is excluded)
- E is in position 2 (valid since position 5 is excluded)

This seems like a strong second guess.

So the word must contain I, and it cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (since timer had I in position 2 and it was marked “-” – wrong position). Therefore I must be in position 1 or 3.

Remaining allowed letters (excluding all known absent letters): B, F, G, K, L, V, W, Y, I

Therefore, “FILER” is the best next guess.

- Pattern: _ _ _ E R  (positions 4-5 locked as E R)
- Letters known NOT in the word: A, O, S, P, C, H, U, N, D, T, M
- Letters known TO be in the word: E (position 4), R (position 5), I (from timer feedback: I is in the word but wrong position)

So the word must contain I, and it cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (since timer had I in position 2 and it was marked “-” – wrong position). Therefore I must be in position 1 or 3.

Remaining allowed letters (excluding all known absent letters): B, F, G, K, L, V, W, Y, I

We need a 5-letter word ending in “ER” that uses I exactly once (since we don’t yet know if there are duplicates), and I must be in position 1 or 3.

Possible patterns:
1. I _ _ E R
2. _ _ I E R

Let’s explore both.

1. I _ _ E R: First letter is I. We need two more letters from the remaining pool (B, F, G, K, L, V, W, Y) for positions 2 and 3, and they must not repeat any excluded letters.

   - I B L E R → “IBLER” (valid word, no excluded letters)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and which are not.

Common letters in English include: A, E, T, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U, M, W, F, G, Y, P, B, V, K, J, X, Q, Z.

A popular and effective first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (common)
- O (common)
- S (common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common vowels and consonants to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So we know:
- Letters definitely not in the word: A, O, S
- Letters definitely in the word: R, E
- R cannot be in position 2
- E cannot be in position 5

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R and E
2. Does not contain A, O, S
3. Has R not in position 2
4. Has E not in position 5

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and O are out)

Let's try a word like ""RENT"" but it's only 4 letters. We need 5.

A good candidate is ""TREND"":
- Contains R and E
- Does not contain A, O, S
- R is in position 2 (but feedback says R is not in position 2, so this is invalid)

Next candidate: ""PERCH"":
- Contains P, E, R, C, H
- No A, O, S
- R is in position 3 (valid since position 2 is excluded)
- E is in position 2 (valid since position 5 is excluded)

This seems like a strong second guess.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S, P, C, H  
Letters that ARE in the word: R, E  

Positions ruled out so far:
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 3  
- E cannot be in positions 2 or 5  

Remaining common consonants: T, N, L, D, M, B, F, G, K  
Remaining vowels: I, U (E is already known to be present)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both R and E  
2. Places R somewhere other than positions 2 or 3  
3. Places E somewhere other than positions 2 or 5  
4. Uses only letters not yet excluded (no A, O, S, P, C, H)

Possible patterns for R: positions 1, 4, 5  
Possible patterns for E: positions 1, 3, 4  

Let’s try a word that satisfies these constraints.  
A good candidate is “TRIES”:
- Contains R and E  
- R is in position 4 (allowed)  
- E is in position 3 (allowed)  
- Letters used: T, R, I, E, S – but S is already excluded (from arose feedback), so this fails.

Next candidate: “FERNS” – but S is excluded.

Next: “BREAD” – A is excluded.

Next: “UNDER” – U, N, D, E, R  
- Contains R and E  
- R is in position 5 (allowed)  
- E is in position 4 (allowed)  
- Letters used: U, N, D, E, R – none of these are in the excluded list.

This fits all constraints.

From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S, P, C, H, U, N, D  
Letters that ARE in the word: E, R  
Positions now fixed:  
- E is in position 4 (✓)  
- R is in position 5 (✓)  

So the secret word has the form: _ _ _ E R  

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with “ER” (positions 4-5 = E R)  
2. Does NOT contain any of the excluded letters: A, O, S, P, C, H, U, N, D  
3. Uses only letters from the remaining pool: B, F, G, I, K, L, M, T, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s list valid consonants/vowels left:
- Vowels: I (E is already placed)  
- Consonants: B, F, G, K, L, M, T, V, W, Y

We need three letters for positions 1-3, followed by E R.

Possible candidates:
- B I L E R → “BILER” (valid word, no excluded letters)  
- F I L E R → “FILER”  
- T I M E R → “TIMER”  
- M I L E R → “MILER”  
- L I M E R → “LIMER” (valid but less common)  
- G I V E R → “GIVER” (but V is allowed)  
- K I T E R → “KITER” (valid but rare)

Among these, “TIMER” is a common English word and uses only allowed letters.

Check: T, I, M, E, R – none are in the excluded list and it fits the pattern _ _ _ E R.

Therefore, “TIMER” is a strong next guess.

So the word must contain I, and it cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (since timer had I in position 2 and it was marked “-” – wrong position). Therefore I must be in position 1 or 3.

- Letters known NOT in the word: A, O, S, P, C, H, U, N, D, T, M, F, L
- Letters known TO be in the word: E (position 4), R (position 5), I (from timer and filer feedback: I is in the word but wrong position)

From timer and filer feedback:
- I was in positions 2 and 3 respectively, both marked “-” (wrong position).
- Therefore I must be in position 1.

So the word must be: I _ _ E R

Remaining allowed letters (excluding all known absent letters): B, G, K, V, W, Y

We need two letters for positions 2 and 3 from this set, forming a valid 5-letter word ending in “IER”.

Possible combinations:
- I B G E R → “IBGER” (not a word)
- I B K E R → “IBKER” (not a word)
- I B V E R → “IBVER” (not a word)
- I B W E R → “IBWER” (not a word)
- I B Y E R → “IBYER” (not a word)
- I G B E R → “IGBER” (not a word)
- I G K E R → “IGKER” (not a word)
- I G V E R → “IGVER” (not a word)
- I G W E R → “IGWER” (not a word)
- I G Y E R → “IGYER” (not a word)
- I K B E R → “IKBER” (not a word)
- I K G E R → “IKGER” (not a word)
- I K V E R → “IKVER” (not a word)
- I K W E R → “IKWER” (not a word)
- I K Y E R → “IKYER” (not a word)
- I V B E R → “IVBER” (not a word)
- I V G E R → “IVGER” (not a word)
- I V K E R → “IVKER” (not a word)
- I V W E R → “IVWER” (not a word)
- I V Y E R → “IVYER” (valid word)
- I W B E R → “IWBER” (not a word)
- I W G E R → “IWGER” (not a word)
- I W K E R → “IWKER” (not a word)
- I W V E R → “IWVER” (not a word)
- I W Y E R → “IWYER” (not a word)
- I Y B E R → “IYBER” (not a word)
- I Y G E R → “IYGER” (not a word)
- I Y K E R → “IYKER” (not a word)
- I Y V E R → “IYVER” (not a word)
- I Y W E R → “IYWER” (not a word)

The only valid word from this list is “IVYER,” which is a variant spelling of “eyrie” (a high place) but is not common. However, it fits all constraints.

Another check: we have exhausted all combinations with remaining letters and “IVYER” is the only valid word left that fits the pattern and constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is “IVYER.”
