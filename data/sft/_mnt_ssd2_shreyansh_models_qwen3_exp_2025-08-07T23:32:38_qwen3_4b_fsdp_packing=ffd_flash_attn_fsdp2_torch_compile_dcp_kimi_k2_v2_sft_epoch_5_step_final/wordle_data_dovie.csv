### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters and avoiding repeats. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All distinct letters, giving maximum coverage

This should help identify which vowels are in the word and potentially reveal some consonants as well.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters and avoiding repeats. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All distinct letters, giving maximum coverage

This should help identify which vowels are in the word and potentially reveal some consonants as well.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in position 5.

So we know:
- The word ends in E.
- It contains an O somewhere other than the 3rd position.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or S.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E with an O in positions 1, 2, or 4, and no A, R, or S.

Possible positions for O:
- 1st: O _ _ _ E
- 2nd: _ O _ _ E
- 4th: _ _ _ O E

Let’s try to maximize coverage of new consonants. Good consonants left to test: T, N, L, C, D, etc.

A good candidate is ""TONEY"":
- Ends in E (✓).
- Contains O in position 2 (-).
- Uses T, N, Y (new letters).
- No A, R, S.

This tests O in position 2 and introduces T, N, Y.

From the new feedback:

- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in position 2.
- N(x) – N is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 4 (we already know it’s in position 5 from Guess 1).
- Y(x) – Y is not in the word.

So we now know:
- The word has the pattern: _ O _ _ E
- It contains O in position 2 (✓).
- It contains E in position 5 (✓).
- Letters already ruled out: A, R, S, T, N, Y.
- Remaining letters to test: common consonants like L, C, D, B, M, G, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in position 2.
2. Has E in position 5.
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.
4. Uses new consonants to maximize information.

Candidate words fitting _ O _ _ E:
- COBRE (but R is ruled out)
- COBLE (but L is okay, B is okay)
- COMBE (M, B okay)
- CODGE (D, G okay)
- COGIE (G, I okay)
- COBIE (B, I okay)

Let’s pick ""COGIE"":
- C, O, G, I, E.
- O in position 2 (✓).
- E in position 5 (✓).
- Tests C, G, I.
- No ruled-out letters.

But wait, ""COGIE"" is not a valid English word. Let me pick ""COMBE"" instead, which is valid (though rare), or ""COBIE"" (also rare). A better valid word is ""COBRE"" but R is ruled out. 

Another valid word: ""COGUE"" – but U hasn't been tested yet and E is already known. 

Actually, ""COGUE"" is valid (archaic for ""cog"" or ""cogwheel""). But let's try ""COMBE"" as it's more common.

But ""COMBE"" uses M and B, which are new. Let me verify:
- C O M B E – positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:M, 4:B, 5:E.
- O in position 2 (✓).
- E in position 5 (✓).
- Letters: C, M, B are new.

So HOODE is the only valid one with allowed letters.

But HOODE has double O, which is acceptable since we only know O is in position 2, not how many times it appears.

Let’s test HOODE.

But HOODE uses H and D, which are new.

Alternatively, is there another word? Let me think:

- DOUSE (but S is ruled out)
- DOWEL (L is ruled out)
- DOZE (too short)
- DODE (too short)

Actually, HOODE seems the best fit.

But let me check if there's a word with D in position 1: D O _ _ E
Valid words: DOPE (4 letters), DOZE (Z is allowed but S is ruled out), DOPE is invalid length.

So D must be in position 4.

Thus, the word must be _ O _ D E.

Valid words: HOODE, VOYDE (Y out), FOYDE (Y out), POYDE (Y out).

Only HOODE is valid.

But HOODE has H, O, O, D, E – positions: 1:H, 2:O, 3:O, 4:D, 5:E.

Letters ruled out so far: A, R, S, T, N, Y, C, M, B, L, G.

Remaining common consonants to test: F, H, I, K, P, U, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ O _ _ E that contains D (but not in position 3) and uses only allowed letters.

Possible positions for D: 1, 4.

Try D in position 1: D O _ _ E

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters and avoiding repeats. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All distinct letters, giving maximum coverage

This should help identify which vowels are in the word and potentially reveal some consonants as well.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in position 5.

So we know:
- The word ends in E.
- It contains an O somewhere other than the 3rd position.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or S.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E with an O in positions 1, 2, or 4, and no A, R, or S.

Possible positions for O:
- 1st: O _ _ _ E
- 2nd: _ O _ _ E
- 4th: _ _ _ O E

Let’s try to maximize coverage of new consonants. Good consonants left to test: T, N, L, C, D, etc.

A good candidate is ""TONEY"":
- Ends in E (✓).
- Contains O in position 2 (-).
- Uses T, N, Y (new letters).
- No A, R, S.

This tests O in position 2 and introduces T, N, Y.

Guess 2: TONEY -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback:

- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in position 2.
- N(x) – N is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 4 (we already know it’s in position 5 from Guess 1).
- Y(x) – Y is not in the word.

So we now know:
- The word has the pattern: _ O _ _ E
- It contains O in position 2 (✓).
- It contains E in position 5 (✓).
- Letters already ruled out: A, R, S, T, N, Y.
- Remaining letters to test: common consonants like L, C, D, B, M, G, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in position 2.
2. Has E in position 5.
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.
4. Uses new consonants to maximize information.

Candidate words fitting _ O _ _ E:
- COBRE (but R is ruled out)
- COBLE (but L is okay, B is okay)
- COMBE (M, B okay)
- CODGE (D, G okay)
- COGIE (G, I okay)
- COBIE (B, I okay)

Let’s pick ""COGIE"":
- C, O, G, I, E.
- O in position 2 (✓).
- E in position 5 (✓).
- Tests C, G, I.
- No ruled-out letters.

But wait, ""COGIE"" is not a valid English word. Let me pick ""COMBE"" instead, which is valid (though rare), or ""COBIE"" (also rare). A better valid word is ""COBRE"" but R is ruled out. 

Another valid word: ""COGUE"" – but U hasn't been tested yet and E is already known. 

Actually, ""COGUE"" is valid (archaic for ""cog"" or ""cogwheel""). But let's try ""COMBE"" as it's more common.

But ""COMBE"" uses M and B, which are new. Let me verify:
- C O M B E – positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:M, 4:B, 5:E.
- O in position 2 (✓).
- E in position 5 (✓).
- Letters: C, M, B are new.

This seems good.

Summary of constraints so far:
1. Pattern: _ O _ _ E
2. Letters ruled out: A, R, S, T, N, Y, C, M, B
3. Remaining letters to test: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (but we’ll focus on common ones)

We need a valid 5-letter word fitting _ O _ _ E using only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- D: DOGGE (invalid, double G and not common)
- F: FOYEL (Y is ruled out)
- G: GOODE (O is already in position 2, but this would have O in position 1 and 2 – invalid)
- H: HOVEL (H, O, V, E, L – positions: 1:H, 2:O, 3:V, 4:E, 5:L – but E must be in position 5, so HOVEL is invalid)
- I: O is already in position 2, so words like ""OILED"" don’t fit (O in position 1)
- L: ""LODGE"" – L, O, D, G, E – positions: 1:L, 2:O, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E – fits perfectly and uses new letters D and G.
- P: ""PODGE"" – P, O, D, G, E – fits _ O _ _ E and uses D, G.
- V: ""VOGUE"" – V, O, G, U, E – fits and uses G, U.

Between ""LODGE"", ""PODGE"", and ""VOGUE"", ""LODGE"" seems most common and tests D and G.

- D(-) – D is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(✓) – E is in position 5 (already known).

So the pattern is still _ O _ _ E, and we now know:
- There is a second O somewhere (positions 1, 4, or 5, but 5 is E, so 1 or 4).
- D is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 (since position 2 is O and 5 is E), so D must be in position 1.
- Therefore the word must be D O _ _ E with an additional O in position 4: D O _ O E.

Letters ruled out so far: A, R, S, T, N, Y, C, M, B, L, G, H.

Remaining common consonants to test: F, I, K, P, V, W, etc.

Valid 5-letter words fitting D O _ O E:
- DOOED (but double O and D is already in position 1, E in 5 – valid)
- DOOPE (but P is allowed)
- DOOZE (Z allowed, S ruled out)
- DOOKE (K allowed)

DOOED is the most common word here.
