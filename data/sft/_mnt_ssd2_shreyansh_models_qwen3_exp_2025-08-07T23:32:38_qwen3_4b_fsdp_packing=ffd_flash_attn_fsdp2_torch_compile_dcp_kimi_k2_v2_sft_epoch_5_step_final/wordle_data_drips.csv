### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. A popular choice is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words, which should help narrow down possibilities significantly regardless of the feedback received.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.
- DOES contain S, but not in the first position.

We now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S somewhere other than the first position.
2. Avoids L, A, T, E entirely.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, I, O, U, Y, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

Let’s try a word like “ROUSE”:
- R, O, U, S, E → but E is already ruled out.
Next try “FRISK”:
- F, R, I, S, K → no L, A, T, E; S is in position 4 (not 1). This seems valid.

Another candidate: “CRISP” – but P is less common and we want to test more letters.
“BRISK” – B, R, I, S, K – no L, A, T, E; S in position 4.

Between FRISK and BRISK, both are good. BRISK is slightly more common.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, B, K  
2. Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:  
   - R is in position 2 (✓)  
   - I is in position 3 (✓)  
   - S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4 (because those were marked “-” in SLATE and BRISK respectively)  
3. Therefore S must be in position 5.

So the pattern so far is: _ R I _ S

We need a valid 5-letter English word that fits _ R I _ S and uses none of the excluded letters (L, A, T, E, B, K).  
Available consonants: C, D, F, G, H, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Available vowels: O, U (I is already used in position 3, A and E are excluded)

Possible candidates:  
- CRISP – but P is allowed, yet C is fine, but we already know K is out (but P is new)  
- DRIPS – D, R, I, P, S – all letters are allowed and fit the pattern  
- GRIPS – G, R, I, P, S – also valid  
- PRISM – P, R, I, S, M – valid  
- TRIPS – T is excluded (from SLATE feedback)  
- CRISP – C, R, I, S, P – valid
