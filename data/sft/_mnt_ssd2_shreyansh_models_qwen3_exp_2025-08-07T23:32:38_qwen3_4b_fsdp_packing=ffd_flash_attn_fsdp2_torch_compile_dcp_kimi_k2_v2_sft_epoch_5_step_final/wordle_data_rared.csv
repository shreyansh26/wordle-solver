1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This way, I can quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Some common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A word that uses several of these common letters is ""AROSE"". This word contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives me a good mix of common vowels and consonants to test against the secret word.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A is in the word, not in position 1.
   - R is in the word, not in position 2.
   - O and S are not in the word.
   - E is in the word, not in position 5.

2. REACT → R(✓) E(-) A(-) C(x) T(x)
   - R is in the word and is in position 1 (✓).
   - E is in the word, not in position 2.
   - A is in the word, not in position 3.
   - C and T are not in the word.

So we know:
- R is in position 1.
- The word contains A and E, but:
  – A is not in positions 1 or 3.
  – E is not in positions 2 or 5.
- Letters not in the word: O, S, C, T.

We still need to place A and E in the remaining four positions (2, 3, 4, 5) with the above restrictions.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5
Possible positions for E: 1 (but 1 is R), 3, 4
But position 1 is already R, so E can be 3 or 4.

Let’s try a word that:
- Starts with R.
- Uses A and E in valid positions.
- Introduces new common letters to test: N, I, L, D, etc.

A good candidate is “RAINE”:
- R in position 1 (matches ✓).
- A in position 2 (allowed).
- I and N are new common letters.
- E in position 5 (allowed, since E is not restricted from 5 in this round).

However, E was marked “-” in AROSE, meaning it’s not in position 5. So E cannot be in position 5.

Let’s try “RAISE”:
- R(✓) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(-)
But S is already known to be absent, so this is invalid.

Next try “RAVEL”:
- R(✓) A(-) V(x) E(-) L(x)
V and L are new, but E is in position 4 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed).

But A was “-” in AROSE (not position 1) and in REACT (not position 3). Position 2 is fine for A.

However, let’s check if RAVEL uses any excluded letters: no O, S, C, T. Looks good.

But let’s see if we can do better with more common letters. Another candidate is “RAINY”:
- R(✓) A(-) I(x) N(x) Y(x)
I, N, Y are new, but this tests A in position 2 and E is missing. We need to include E.

We must include E somewhere. Let’s try “REBAN” – but N is new and B is new, but E is in position 2 (invalid).

Better: “RANGE”:
- R(✓) A(-) N(x) G(x) E(-)
E is in position 5 (invalid, E cannot be in 5).

“RADIO” – O is excluded.

“RAINS” – S excluded.

“RAISE” – S excluded.

“RABID” – E missing.

“RAISE” – already excluded.

“RAJEN” – E is in position 4 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed). Letters: R, A, J, E, N. J and N are new. Seems good.

But let’s try simpler: “RAINE” – but E in 5 is invalid.

“RAVEL” – E in 4, A in 2. No excluded letters. This seems the best option.

But let’s verify:
- R(✓) A(-) V(x) E(-) L(x)
Positions:
1: R (correct)
2: A (allowed, not position 1 or 3)
3: V (new)
4: E (allowed, not position 2 or 5)
5: L (new)
Excluded letters: O, S, C, T, V, L are new – no conflict.

Thus, “RAVEL” is a valid next guess.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This way, I can quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Some common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A word that uses several of these common letters is ""AROSE"". This word contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives me a good mix of common vowels and consonants to test against the secret word.

- Does NOT contain O or S.

Next, I want to test new common letters while placing the known letters (A, R, E) in different positions. Good candidates are consonants like T, N, L, C, D, and vowels like I, U. A word like “REACT” uses:
- R (must move to a new spot, positions 1 or 3 or 4)
- E (must move to a new spot, positions 2 or 3 or 4)
- A (must move to a new spot, positions 2, 3, 4, or 5)
- C and T are new letters.

Let’s try “REACT”.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: REACT -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(-) A(-) C(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A is in the word, not in position 1.
   - R is in the word, not in position 2.
   - O and S are not in the word.
   - E is in the word, not in position 5.

2. REACT → R(✓) E(-) A(-) C(x) T(x)
   - R is in the word and is in position 1 (✓).
   - E is in the word, not in position 2.
   - A is in the word, not in position 3.
   - C and T are not in the word.

So we know:
- R is in position 1.
- The word contains A and E, but:
  – A is not in positions 1 or 3.
  – E is not in positions 2 or 5.
- Letters not in the word: O, S, C, T.

We still need to place A and E in the remaining four positions (2, 3, 4, 5) with the above restrictions.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5
Possible positions for E: 1 (but 1 is R), 3, 4
But position 1 is already R, so E can be 3 or 4.

Let’s try a word that:
- Starts with R.
- Uses A and E in valid positions.
- Introduces new common letters to test: N, I, L, D, etc.

A good candidate is “RAINE”:
- R in position 1 (matches ✓).
- A in position 2 (allowed).
- I and N are new common letters.
- E in position 5 (allowed, since E is not restricted from 5 in this round).

However, E was marked “-” in AROSE, meaning it’s not in position 5. So E cannot be in position 5.

Let’s try “RAISE”:
- R(✓) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(-)
But S is already known to be absent, so this is invalid.

Next try “RAVEL”:
- R(✓) A(-) V(x) E(-) L(x)
V and L are new, but E is in position 4 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed).

But A was “-” in AROSE (not position 1) and in REACT (not position 3). Position 2 is fine for A.

However, let’s check if RAVEL uses any excluded letters: no O, S, C, T. Looks good.

But let’s see if we can do better with more common letters. Another candidate is “RAINY”:
- R(✓) A(-) I(x) N(x) Y(x)
I, N, Y are new, but this tests A in position 2 and E is missing. We need to include E.

We must include E somewhere. Let’s try “REBAN” – but N is new and B is new, but E is in position 2 (invalid).

Better: “RANGE”:
- R(✓) A(-) N(x) G(x) E(-)
E is in position 5 (invalid, E cannot be in 5).

“RADIO” – O is excluded.

“RAINS” – S excluded.

“RAISE” – S excluded.

“RABID” – E missing.

“RAISE” – already excluded.

“RAJEN” – E is in position 4 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed). Letters: R, A, J, E, N. J and N are new. Seems good.

But let’s try simpler: “RAINE” – but E in 5 is invalid.

“RAVEL” – E in 4, A in 2. No excluded letters. This seems the best option.

But let’s verify:
- R(✓) A(-) V(x) E(-) L(x)
Positions:
1: R (correct)
2: A (allowed, not position 1 or 3)
3: V (new)
4: E (allowed, not position 2 or 5)
5: L (new)
Excluded letters: O, S, C, T, V, L are new – no conflict.

Thus, “RAVEL” is a valid next guess.

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   – A, R, E are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 5 respectively.
   – O, S are not in the word.

2. REACT → R(✓) E(-) A(-) C(x) T(x)
   – R is in position 1 (✓).
   – E is in the word but not in position 2.
   – A is in the word but not in position 3.
   – C, T are not in the word.

3. RAVEL → R(✓) A(✓) V(x) E(✓) L(x)
   – R is in position 1 (✓).
   – A is in position 2 (✓).
   – E is in position 4 (✓).
   – V, L are not in the word.

So the secret word is:
- R _ A _ E
- Positions 3 and 5 remain unknown.
- Letters already excluded: O, S, C, T, V, L.

We need to fill positions 3 and 5 with letters not yet used. Common remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, U, W, Y.

Looking at common 5-letter words that fit R A _ E:
- R A I N E → but N is allowed, I is allowed. Check if N and I are excluded? No.
- R A I D E → but D is allowed, I is allowed.
- R A M E Y → but Y is allowed.
- R A P E D → but D is allowed.
- R A G E D → but G and D are allowed.

Let’s pick a word that uses common remaining letters. ""RAINE"" is a good candidate, but E is already in position 4, so ""RAINE"" would have E twice, which is unlikely. Instead, let’s try ""RAJEN"" – but J is less common.

A better choice is ""RAINE"" – but E is already in position 4, so this would duplicate E. Let’s try ""RAJEN"" – but J is less common.

Actually, ""RAINE"" is invalid because it would have E in position 5, which is invalid. Let’s try ""RAJEN"" – but J is less common.

A better word is ""RAJEN"" – but let’s think of ""RAJEN"" – no, J is uncommon.

Let’s try ""RAJEN"" – but this seems forced.

Let’s try ""RAINE"" – but E is already in 4, so position 5 would be N, making it ""RAINE"" – but this has E in 5, which is invalid.

Let’s try ""RAJEN"" – but this seems forced.

Actually, the pattern is R A _ E. Let’s think of common words:
- R A I N E → but E is in 5, invalid.
- R A I D E → but D is allowed, I is allowed. This would be R A I D E, but E is in 5, invalid.

Wait, the pattern is R A _ E, so position 5 is E, but E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE feedback). Thus, this is impossible.

This suggests an error in earlier steps. Let’s re-examine:

From RAVEL feedback: E is in position 4 (✓), so the word is R A _ E, but position 5 is not E. Thus, the word must be R A _ _ E, but E is in 4, so position 5 is not E. This seems conflicting.

Wait, the word has 5 letters: positions 1-5.

From RAVEL:
- R(✓) position 1
- A(✓) position 2
- V(x) position 3
- E(✓) position 4
- L(x) position 5

Thus, the word is R A _ E, with position 3 and 5 to determine. But position 5 is not E, as E is in 4.

Thus, the word structure is R A [letter] E, with position 5 being any letter except excluded ones (O, S, C, T, V, L).

Possible letters for position 3: any not excluded, not R, A, E.
Possible letters for position 5: any not excluded, not R, A, E.

Common remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, U, W, Y.

Looking for common words:
- R A I N E → but E is in 4, so this would be R A I N E, but E is in 5, invalid.
- R A I D E → R A I D E, but E is in 5, invalid.
- R A M E D → R A M E D, but E is in 4, so this would be R A M E D, but D is in 5, E in 4. This fits R A _ E, with M in 3 and D in 5. This seems valid.

""RAMED"" is a valid word (past tense of ""ram"").

Let’s check:
- R A M E D
- R(✓) position 1
- A(✓) position 2

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This way, I can quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Some common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A word that uses several of these common letters is ""AROSE"". This word contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives me a good mix of common vowels and consonants to test against the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, E (but not in positions 1, 2, 5 respectively).
- Does NOT contain O or S.

Next, I want to test new common letters while placing the known letters (A, R, E) in different positions. Good candidates are consonants like T, N, L, C, D, and vowels like I, U. A word like “REACT” uses:
- R (must move to a new spot, positions 1 or 3 or 4)
- E (must move to a new spot, positions 2 or 3 or 4)
- A (must move to a new spot, positions 2, 3, 4, or 5)
- C and T are new letters.

Let’s try “REACT”.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: REACT -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(-) A(-) C(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A is in the word, not in position 1.
   - R is in the word, not in position 2.
   - O and S are not in the word.
   - E is in the word, not in position 5.

2. REACT → R(✓) E(-) A(-) C(x) T(x)
   - R is in the word and is in position 1 (✓).
   - E is in the word, not in position 2.
   - A is in the word, not in position 3.
   - C and T are not in the word.

So we know:
- R is in position 1.
- The word contains A and E, but:
  – A is not in positions 1 or 3.
  – E is not in positions 2 or 5.
- Letters not in the word: O, S, C, T.

We still need to place A and E in the remaining four positions (2, 3, 4, 5) with the above restrictions.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5
Possible positions for E: 1 (but 1 is R), 3, 4
But position 1 is already R, so E can be 3 or 4.

Let’s try a word that:
- Starts with R.
- Uses A and E in valid positions.
- Introduces new common letters to test: N, I, L, D, etc.

A good candidate is “RAINE”:
- R in position 1 (matches ✓).
- A in position 2 (allowed).
- I and N are new common letters.
- E in position 5 (allowed, since E is not restricted from 5 in this round).

However, E was marked “-” in AROSE, meaning it’s not in position 5. So E cannot be in position 5.

Let’s try “RAISE”:
- R(✓) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(-)
But S is already known to be absent, so this is invalid.

Next try “RAVEL”:
- R(✓) A(-) V(x) E(-) L(x)
V and L are new, but E is in position 4 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed).

But A was “-” in AROSE (not position 1) and in REACT (not position 3). Position 2 is fine for A.

However, let’s check if RAVEL uses any excluded letters: no O, S, C, T. Looks good.

But let’s see if we can do better with more common letters. Another candidate is “RAINY”:
- R(✓) A(-) I(x) N(x) Y(x)
I, N, Y are new, but this tests A in position 2 and E is missing. We need to include E.

We must include E somewhere. Let’s try “REBAN” – but N is new and B is new, but E is in position 2 (invalid).

Better: “RANGE”:
- R(✓) A(-) N(x) G(x) E(-)
E is in position 5 (invalid, E cannot be in 5).

“RADIO” – O is excluded.

“RAINS” – S excluded.

“RAISE” – S excluded.

“RABID” – E missing.

“RAISE” – already excluded.

“RAJEN” – E is in position 4 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed). Letters: R, A, J, E, N. J and N are new. Seems good.

But let’s try simpler: “RAINE” – but E in 5 is invalid.

“RAVEL” – E in 4, A in 2. No excluded letters. This seems the best option.

But let’s verify:
- R(✓) A(-) V(x) E(-) L(x)
Positions:
1: R (correct)
2: A (allowed, not position 1 or 3)
3: V (new)
4: E (allowed, not position 2 or 5)
5: L (new)
Excluded letters: O, S, C, T, V, L are new – no conflict.

Thus, “RAVEL” is a valid next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)

Guess 3: RAVEL -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) V(x) E(✓) L(x)

<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   – A, R, E are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 5 respectively.
   – O, S are not in the word.

2. REACT → R(✓) E(-) A(-) C(x) T(x)
   – R is in position 1 (✓).
   – E is in the word but not in position 2.
   – A is in the word but not in position 3.
   – C, T are not in the word.

3. RAVEL → R(✓) A(✓) V(x) E(✓) L(x)
   – R is in position 1 (✓).
   – A is in position 2 (✓).
   – E is in position 4 (✓).
   – V, L are not in the word.

So the secret word is:
- R _ A _ E
- Positions 3 and 5 remain unknown.
- Letters already excluded: O, S, C, T, V, L.

We need to fill positions 3 and 5 with letters not yet used. Common remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, U, W, Y.

Looking at common 5-letter words that fit R A _ E:
- R A I N E → but N is allowed, I is allowed. Check if N and I are excluded? No.
- R A I D E → but D is allowed, I is allowed.
- R A M E Y → but Y is allowed.
- R A P E D → but D is allowed.
- R A G E D → but G and D are allowed.

Let’s pick a word that uses common remaining letters. ""RAINE"" is a good candidate, but E is already in position 4, so ""RAINE"" would have E twice, which is unlikely. Instead, let’s try ""RAJEN"" – but J is less common.

A better choice is ""RAINE"" – but E is already in position 4, so this would duplicate E. Let’s try ""RAJEN"" – but J is less common.

Actually, ""RAINE"" is invalid because it would have E in position 5, which is invalid. Let’s try ""RAJEN"" – but J is less common.

A better word is ""RAJEN"" – but let’s think of ""RAJEN"" – no, J is uncommon.

Let’s try ""RAJEN"" – but this seems forced.

Let’s try ""RAINE"" – but E is already in 4, so position 5 would be N, making it ""RAINE"" – but this has E in 5, which is invalid.

Let’s try ""RAJEN"" – but this seems forced.

Actually, the pattern is R A _ E. Let’s think of common words:
- R A I N E → but E is in 5, invalid.
- R A I D E → but D is allowed, I is allowed. This would be R A I D E, but E is in 5, invalid.

Wait, the pattern is R A _ E, so position 5 is E, but E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE feedback). Thus, this is impossible.

This suggests an error in earlier steps. Let’s re-examine:

From RAVEL feedback: E is in position 4 (✓), so the word is R A _ E, but position 5 is not E. Thus, the word must be R A _ _ E, but E is in 4, so position 5 is not E. This seems conflicting.

Wait, the word has 5 letters: positions 1-5.

From RAVEL:
- R(✓) position 1
- A(✓) position 2
- V(x) position 3
- E(✓) position 4
- L(x) position 5

Thus, the word is R A _ E, with position 3 and 5 to determine. But position 5 is not E, as E is in 4.

Thus, the word structure is R A [letter] E, with position 5 being any letter except excluded ones (O, S, C, T, V, L).

Possible letters for position 3: any not excluded, not R, A, E.
Possible letters for position 5: any not excluded, not R, A, E.

Common remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, U, W, Y.

Looking for common words:
- R A I N E → but E is in 4, so this would be R A I N E, but E is in 5, invalid.
- R A I D E → R A I D E, but E is in 5, invalid.
- R A M E D → R A M E D, but E is in 4, so this would be R A M E D, but D is in 5, E in 4. This fits R A _ E, with M in 3 and D in 5. This seems valid.

""RAMED"" is a valid word (past tense of ""ram"").

Let’s check:
- R A M E D
- R(✓) position 1
- A(✓) position 2
- M (new, allowed)
- E(✓) position 4
- D (new, allowed)

This fits all constraints.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This way, I can quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Some common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A word that uses several of these common letters is ""AROSE"". This word contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives me a good mix of common vowels and consonants to test against the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, E (but not in positions 1, 2, 5 respectively).
- Does NOT contain O or S.

Next, I want to test new common letters while placing the known letters (A, R, E) in different positions. Good candidates are consonants like T, N, L, C, D, and vowels like I, U. A word like “REACT” uses:
- R (must move to a new spot, positions 1 or 3 or 4)
- E (must move to a new spot, positions 2 or 3 or 4)
- A (must move to a new spot, positions 2, 3, 4, or 5)
- C and T are new letters.

   - E is in the word, not in position 5.

2. REACT → R(✓) E(-) A(-) C(x) T(x)
   - R is in the word and is in position 1 (✓).
   - E is in the word, not in position 2.
   - A is in the word, not in position 3.
   - C and T are not in the word.

So we know:
- R is in position 1.
- The word contains A and E, but:
  – A is not in positions 1 or 3.
  – E is not in positions 2 or 5.
- Letters not in the word: O, S, C, T.

We still need to place A and E in the remaining four positions (2, 3, 4, 5) with the above restrictions.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5
Possible positions for E: 1 (but 1 is R), 3, 4
But position 1 is already R, so E can be 3 or 4.

Let’s try a word that:
- Starts with R.
- Uses A and E in valid positions.
- Introduces new common letters to test: N, I, L, D, etc.

A good candidate is “RAINE”:
- R in position 1 (matches ✓).
- A in position 2 (allowed).
- I and N are new common letters.
- E in position 5 (allowed, since E is not restricted from 5 in this round).

However, E was marked “-” in AROSE, meaning it’s not in position 5. So E cannot be in position 5.

Let’s try “RAISE”:
- R(✓) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(-)
But S is already known to be absent, so this is invalid.

Next try “RAVEL”:
- R(✓) A(-) V(x) E(-) L(x)
V and L are new, but E is in position 4 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed).

But A was “-” in AROSE (not position 1) and in REACT (not position 3). Position 2 is fine for A.

However, let’s check if RAVEL uses any excluded letters: no O, S, C, T. Looks good.

But let’s see if we can do better with more common letters. Another candidate is “RAINY”:
- R(✓) A(-) I(x) N(x) Y(x)
I, N, Y are new, but this tests A in position 2 and E is missing. We need to include E.

We must include E somewhere. Let’s try “REBAN” – but N is new and B is new, but E is in position 2 (invalid).

Better: “RANGE”:
- R(✓) A(-) N(x) G(x) E(-)
E is in position 5 (invalid, E cannot be in 5).

“RADIO” – O is excluded.

“RAINS” – S excluded.

“RAISE” – S excluded.

“RABID” – E missing.

“RAISE” – already excluded.

“RAJEN” – E is in position 4 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed). Letters: R, A, J, E, N. J and N are new. Seems good.

But let’s try simpler: “RAINE” – but E in 5 is invalid.

“RAVEL” – E in 4, A in 2. No excluded letters. This seems the best option.

But let’s verify:
- R(✓) A(-) V(x) E(-) L(x)
Positions:
1: R (correct)
2: A (allowed, not position 1 or 3)
3: V (new)
4: E (allowed, not position 2 or 5)
5: L (new)
Excluded letters: O, S, C, T, V, L are new – no conflict.

Thus, “RAVEL” is a valid next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)

Guess 3: RAVEL -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) V(x) E(✓) L(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   – A, R, E are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 5 respectively.
   – O, S are not in the word.

2. REACT → R(✓) E(-) A(-) C(x) T(x)
   – R is in position 1 (✓).
   – E is in the word but not in position 2.
   – A is in the word but not in position 3.
   – C, T are not in the word.

3. RAVEL → R(✓) A(✓) V(x) E(✓) L(x)
   – R is in position 1 (✓).
   – A is in position 2 (✓).
   – E is in position 4 (✓).
   – V, L are not in the word.

So the secret word is:
- R _ A _ E
- Positions 3 and 5 remain unknown.
- Letters already excluded: O, S, C, T, V, L.

We need to fill positions 3 and 5 with letters not yet used. Common remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, U, W, Y.

Looking at common 5-letter words that fit R A _ E:
- R A I N E → but N is allowed, I is allowed. Check if N and I are excluded? No.
- R A I D E → but D is allowed, I is allowed.
- R A M E Y → but Y is allowed.
- R A P E D → but D is allowed.
- R A G E D → but G and D are allowed.

Let’s pick a word that uses common remaining letters. ""RAINE"" is a good candidate, but E is already in position 4, so ""RAINE"" would have E twice, which is unlikely. Instead, let’s try ""RAJEN"" – but J is less common.

A better choice is ""RAINE"" – but E is already in position 4, so this would duplicate E. Let’s try ""RAJEN"" – but J is less common.

Actually, ""RAINE"" is invalid because it would have E in position 5, which is invalid. Let’s try ""RAJEN"" – but J is less common.

A better word is ""RAJEN"" – but let’s think of ""RAJEN"" – no, J is uncommon.

Let’s try ""RAJEN"" – but this seems forced.

Let’s try ""RAINE"" – but E is already in 4, so position 5 would be N, making it ""RAINE"" – but this has E in 5, which is invalid.

Let’s try ""RAJEN"" – but this seems forced.

Actually, the pattern is R A _ E. Let’s think of common words:
- R A I N E → but E is in 5, invalid.
- R A I D E → but D is allowed, I is allowed. This would be R A I D E, but E is in 5, invalid.

Wait, the pattern is R A _ E, so position 5 is E, but E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE feedback). Thus, this is impossible.

This suggests an error in earlier steps. Let’s re-examine:

From RAVEL feedback: E is in position 4 (✓), so the word is R A _ E, but position 5 is not E. Thus, the word must be R A _ _ E, but E is in 4, so position 5 is not E. This seems conflicting.

Wait, the word has 5 letters: positions 1-5.

From RAVEL:
- R(✓) position 1
- A(✓) position 2
- V(x) position 3
- E(✓) position 4
- L(x) position 5

Thus, the word is R A _ E, with position 3 and 5 to determine. But position 5 is not E, as E is in 4.

Thus, the word structure is R A [letter] E, with position 5 being any letter except excluded ones (O, S, C, T, V, L).

Possible letters for position 3: any not excluded, not R, A, E.
Possible letters for position 5: any not excluded, not R, A, E.

Common remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, U, W, Y.

Looking for common words:
- R A I N E → but E is in 4, so this would be R A I N E, but E is in 5, invalid.
- R A I D E → R A I D E, but E is in 5, invalid.
- R A M E D → R A M E D, but E is in 4, so this would be R A M E D, but D is in 5, E in 4. This fits R A _ E, with M in 3 and D in 5. This seems valid.

""RAMED"" is a valid word (past tense of ""ram"").

Let’s check:
- R A M E D
- R(✓) position 1
- A(✓) position 2
- M (new, allowed)
- E(✓) position 4
- D (new, allowed)

This fits all constraints.
