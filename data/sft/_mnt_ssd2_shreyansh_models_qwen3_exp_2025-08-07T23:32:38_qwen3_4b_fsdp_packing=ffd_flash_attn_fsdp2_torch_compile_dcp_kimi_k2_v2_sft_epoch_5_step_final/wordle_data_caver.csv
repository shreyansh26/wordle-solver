Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information possible. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some of the most common letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. 

Looking at these letters, a word like ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers both vowels and consonants. This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a balanced choice.

Let’s summarize what we now know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A is in the word, but NOT in position 1.
- R is in the word, but NOT in position 2.
- O is NOT in the word.
- S is NOT in the word.
- E is in the word, but NOT in position 5.

From Guess 2 (REACT):
- R is in the word, but NOT in position 1.
- E is in the word, but NOT in position 2.
- A is in the word, but NOT in position 3.
- C is in the word, but NOT in position 4.
- T is NOT in the word.

Combining these facts:
- Letters we know are in the word: A, R, E, C
- Letters we know are NOT in the word: O, S, T
- Positions we have ruled out for each of A, R, E:
  – A cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
  – R cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
  – E cannot be in positions 2 or 5.
- C cannot be in position 4.

We need a 5-letter word that uses A, R, E, C exactly once each (since we have four letters confirmed and one slot left), plus one new letter that hasn’t been tested yet and is common (like D, N, L, M, etc.).

A good candidate is “CAREY” – but Y is less common and might not give us the most information. Instead, let’s try “CARED”:
- Uses C, A, R, E, D (D is new).
- Positions:
  – C in position 1 (allowed, since C was only ruled out of position 4).
  – A in position 2 (allowed, since A was only ruled out of positions 1 and 3).
  – R in position 3 (allowed, since R was only ruled out of positions 1 and 2).
  – E in position 4 (allowed, since E was only ruled out of positions 2 and 5).
  – D is new and common.

This placement satisfies all constraints and tests a new letter (D) while placing the known letters in permissible spots.

Letters that are definitely in the word:

So the word looks like: C A _ E _

The only remaining letter we know must be present is R, and it cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. The only remaining position is 5. Therefore R must be in position 5.

So the word is C A _ E R.

The missing letter (position 3) must be a consonant that has not yet been ruled out and is common. From previous guesses we have not tested: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking at common English letters, the most frequent unused consonants are B, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, etc.

Let’s pick the most common unused consonant that fits: N.

So the word would be C A N E R.

Let me check:
- C in position 1 ✓ (matches feedback)
- A in position 2 ✓ (matches feedback)
- N is new, common

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Looking at these letters, a word like ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers both vowels and consonants. This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, R, E (each missing from one position).
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: O, S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, R, E (each in a different spot than before).
- Does not contain O or S.
- Uses other common consonants to gain more information.

Possible candidates: “REACT”, “EARLY”, “RATIO” (but O is out), “CRANE” (but O is out), “TREAD” (but S is out), “GRAPE” (but S is out).

Let’s pick “REACT”:
- R moves from position 2 to 1.
- E moves from position 5 to 2.
- A moves from position 1 to 3.
- C and T are new common letters.

This should give us good coverage.

Let’s summarize what we now know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A is in the word, but NOT in position 1.
- R is in the word, but NOT in position 2.
- O is NOT in the word.
- S is NOT in the word.
- E is in the word, but NOT in position 5.

From Guess 2 (REACT):
- R is in the word, but NOT in position 1.
- E is in the word, but NOT in position 2.
- A is in the word, but NOT in position 3.
- C is in the word, but NOT in position 4.
- T is NOT in the word.

Combining these facts:
- Letters we know are in the word: A, R, E, C
- Letters we know are NOT in the word: O, S, T
- Positions we have ruled out for each of A, R, E:
  – A cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
  – R cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
  – E cannot be in positions 2 or 5.
- C cannot be in position 4.

We need a 5-letter word that uses A, R, E, C exactly once each (since we have four letters confirmed and one slot left), plus one new letter that hasn’t been tested yet and is common (like D, N, L, M, etc.).

A good candidate is “CAREY” – but Y is less common and might not give us the most information. Instead, let’s try “CARED”:
- Uses C, A, R, E, D (D is new).
- Positions:
  – C in position 1 (allowed, since C was only ruled out of position 4).
  – A in position 2 (allowed, since A was only ruled out of positions 1 and 3).
  – R in position 3 (allowed, since R was only ruled out of positions 1 and 2).
  – E in position 4 (allowed, since E was only ruled out of positions 2 and 5).
  – D is new and common.

This placement satisfies all constraints and tests a new letter (D) while placing the known letters in permissible spots.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information possible. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some of the most common letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. 

Looking at these letters, a word like ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers both vowels and consonants. This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a balanced choice.

- Letters definitely NOT in the word: O, S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, R, E (each in a different spot than before).
- Does not contain O or S.
- Uses other common consonants to gain more information.

Possible candidates: “REACT”, “EARLY”, “RATIO” (but O is out), “CRANE” (but O is out), “TREAD” (but S is out), “GRAPE” (but S is out).

Let’s pick “REACT”:
- R moves from position 2 to 1.
- E moves from position 5 to 2.
- A moves from position 1 to 3.
- C and T are new common letters.

This should give us good coverage.

Let’s summarize what we now know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A is in the word, but NOT in position 1.
- R is in the word, but NOT in position 2.
- O is NOT in the word.
- S is NOT in the word.
- E is in the word, but NOT in position 5.

From Guess 2 (REACT):
- R is in the word, but NOT in position 1.
- E is in the word, but NOT in position 2.
- A is in the word, but NOT in position 3.
- C is in the word, but NOT in position 4.
- T is NOT in the word.

Combining these facts:
- Letters we know are in the word: A, R, E, C
- Letters we know are NOT in the word: O, S, T
- Positions we have ruled out for each of A, R, E:
  – A cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
  – R cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
  – E cannot be in positions 2 or 5.
- C cannot be in position 4.

We need a 5-letter word that uses A, R, E, C exactly once each (since we have four letters confirmed and one slot left), plus one new letter that hasn’t been tested yet and is common (like D, N, L, M, etc.).

A good candidate is “CAREY” – but Y is less common and might not give us the most information. Instead, let’s try “CARED”:
- Uses C, A, R, E, D (D is new).
- Positions:
  – C in position 1 (allowed, since C was only ruled out of position 4).
  – A in position 2 (allowed, since A was only ruled out of positions 1 and 3).
  – R in position 3 (allowed, since R was only ruled out of positions 1 and 2).
  – E in position 4 (allowed, since E was only ruled out of positions 2 and 5).
  – D is new and common.

This placement satisfies all constraints and tests a new letter (D) while placing the known letters in permissible spots.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters that are definitely in the word:
- C (position 1 confirmed ✓)
- A (position 2 confirmed ✓)
- E (position 4 confirmed ✓)
- R (somewhere, but NOT positions 1, 2, 3)

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word:
- O, S, T, D

So the word looks like: C A _ E _

The only remaining letter we know must be present is R, and it cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. The only remaining position is 5. Therefore R must be in position 5.

So the word is C A _ E R.

The missing letter (position 3) must be a consonant that has not yet been ruled out and is common. From previous guesses we have not tested: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking at common English letters, the most frequent unused consonants are B, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, etc.

Let’s pick the most common unused consonant that fits: N.

So the word would be C A N E R.

Let me check:
- C in position 1 ✓ (matches feedback)
- A in position 2 ✓ (matches feedback)
- N is new, common
- E in position 4 ✓ (matches feedback)
- R in position 5 (only remaining spot for R)

This seems correct.

From the feedback on CANER we now know:

- C (✓) at position 1 – fixed.
- A (✓) at position 2 – fixed.
- N (x) – N is NOT in the word at all.
- E (✓) at position 4 – fixed.
- R (✓) at position 5 – fixed.

So the word must be C A _ E R.

The only missing letter is at position 3.  
Letters already ruled out (from all feedback): O, S, T, D, N.

Common unused consonants left: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, etc.

The most common English consonant not yet tried is L, so the word is likely:

C A L E R
