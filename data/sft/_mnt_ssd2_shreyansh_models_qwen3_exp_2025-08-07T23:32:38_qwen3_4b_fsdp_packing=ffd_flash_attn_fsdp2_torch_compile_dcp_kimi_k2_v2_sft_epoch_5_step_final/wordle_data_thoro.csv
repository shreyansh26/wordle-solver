For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

Some good starting words include:
- AROSE (contains A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses 5 of the most common letters and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: x → A is not in the word.
- R: - → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O: ✓ → O is in the word and in position 3.
- S: x → S is not in the word.
- E: x → E is not in the word.

So we know:
1. The word has an O in the 3rd position.
2. It contains an R somewhere, but not in position 2.
3. It does NOT contain A, S, or E.

We need a 5-letter word with O in position 3 and an R elsewhere (not position 2). Possible structures: _ _ O _ _ or _ _ O _ R or _ _ O R _ etc.

Good letters to try next: common consonants like T, N, L, D, C, M, P, plus vowels I, U.

Let’s pick a word that introduces several new common letters while fitting the constraints.  
A strong candidate is “FRONT”:
- F, R, O, N, T.
- O is in position 3 (matches ✓).
- R is in position 2 (but feedback says R is in the word but NOT in position 2, so this would conflict).  
Oops—R in position 2 is disallowed.

Next try “DROOL”:
- D, R, O, O, L.
- O in position 3 (✓).
- R in position 2 (-) → conflict again.

Try “CROOK”:
- C, R, O, O, K.
- O in position 3 (✓).
- R in position 2 (-) → conflict again.

Try “ROTOR”:
- R, O, T, O, R.
- O in position 3 (✓).
- R appears twice, but one R is in position 1 and the other in 5—neither is position 2, so this satisfies the R constraint.
- Uses new letters T and another R, but we already know R is in the word.

But we might prefer to test more new letters. Let’s try “BROIL”:
- B, R, O, I, L.
- O in position 3 (✓).
- R in position 2 (-) → conflict again.

Try “GROIN”:
- G, R, O, I, N.
- O in position 3 (✓).
- R in position 2 (-) → conflict.

Try “TRUCK”:
- T, R, U, C, K.

- O in position 3 (✓).
- R in position 2 (-) → conflict.

Try “CRONY”:

- R in position 2 (-) → conflict.

Try “FORGO”:

- O in position 3 (✓).
- R in position 2 (-) → conflict.

Try “FROST”:
- F, R, O, S, T.
- S is excluded → fails.

Try “GROIN” again—R in position 2 conflict.

Let’s list words with O in position 3 and R not in position 2:
- _ _ O _ _ with R in 1,4,5.
- _ _ O R _ (R in 4).
- _ _ O _ R (R in 5).

Possible words:

Try “FRONT” again—R in 2 conflict.

Let’s try “PROWL”:
- P, R, O, W, L.
- O in 3 (✓).

Try “ZORRO”:

Hmm, many words have R in position 2. Let’s pick a word with R in position 1 or 4 or 5.

Try “ROBIN” again—O in 2.

Try “ROGER”:
- R, O, G, E, R → E excluded.

Try “RODOR”:
- R, O, D, O, R → O in 3 (✓).
- R in 1 and 5—neither is 2, so this satisfies R not in 2.
- Uses new letters D.

So “RODOR” is valid:
- R in 1 (allowed).
- O in 3 (✓).
- D and another R and O are new letters.

But “RODOR” is a bit obscure. Let’s try a more common word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

Some good starting words include:
- AROSE (contains A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses 5 of the most common letters and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: x → A is not in the word.
- R: - → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O: ✓ → O is in the word and in position 3.
- S: x → S is not in the word.
- E: x → E is not in the word.

So we know:
1. The word has an O in the 3rd position.
2. It contains an R somewhere, but not in position 2.
3. It does NOT contain A, S, or E.

We need a 5-letter word with O in position 3 and an R elsewhere (not position 2). Possible structures: _ _ O _ _ or _ _ O _ R or _ _ O R _ etc.

Good letters to try next: common consonants like T, N, L, D, C, M, P, plus vowels I, U.

Let’s pick a word that introduces several new common letters while fitting the constraints.  
A strong candidate is “FRONT”:
- F, R, O, N, T.
- O is in position 3 (matches ✓).
- R is in position 2 (but feedback says R is in the word but NOT in position 2, so this would conflict).  
Oops—R in position 2 is disallowed.

Next try “DROOL”:
- D, R, O, O, L.
- O in position 3 (✓).
- R in position 2 (-) → conflict again.

Try “CROOK”:
- C, R, O, O, K.
- O in position 3 (✓).
- R in position 2 (-) → conflict again.

Try “ROTOR”:
- R, O, T, O, R.
- O in position 3 (✓).
- R appears twice, but one R is in position 1 and the other in 5—neither is position 2, so this satisfies the R constraint.
- Uses new letters T and another R, but we already know R is in the word.

But we might prefer to test more new letters. Let’s try “BROIL”:
- B, R, O, I, L.
- O in position 3 (✓).
- R in position 2 (-) → conflict again.

Try “GROIN”:
- G, R, O, I, N.
- O in position 3 (✓).
- R in position 2 (-) → conflict.

Try “TRUCK”:
- T, R, U, C, K.
- O not in position 3 → fails.

Try “PRONG”:
- P, R, O, N, G.
- O in position 3 (✓).
- R in position 2 (-) → conflict.

Try “CRONY”:
- C, R, O, N, Y.
- O in position 3 (✓).
- R in position 2 (-) → conflict.

Try “FORGO”:
- F, O, R, G, O.
- O in position 3 (✓).
- R in position 3 (but position 3 is O) → conflict.

Try “PORCH”:
- P, O, R, C, H.
- O in position 2, not 3 → fails.

Try “TORCH”:
- T, O, R, C, H.
- O in position 2 → fails.

Try “ROBIN”:
- R, O, B, I, N.
- O in position 2 → fails.

Try “MOTOR”:
- M, O, T, O, R.
- O in position 2 → fails.

Try “TROOP”:
- T, R, O, O, P.
- O in position 3 (✓).
- R in position 2 (-) → conflict.

Try “BROOM”:
- B, R, O, O, M.
- O in position 3 (✓).
- R in position 2 (-) → conflict.

Try “DROLL”:
- D, R, O, L, L.
- O in position 3 (✓).
- R in position 2 (-) → conflict.

Try “FROST”:
- F, R, O, S, T.
- S is excluded → fails.

Try “GROIN” again—R in position 2 conflict.

Let’s list words with O in position 3 and R not in position 2:
- _ _ O _ _ with R in 1,4,5.
- _ _ O R _ (R in 4).
- _ _ O _ R (R in 5).

Possible words:
- BORON (but has O twice, and N is new)
- CORGI (but G is less common)
- FORGE (E excluded)
- HORDE (E excluded)
- MORON (O twice)
- PORCH (O in 2)
- TORUS (S excluded)

Try “MORON”:
- M, O, R, O, N.
- O in 3 (✓).
- R in 2 → conflict.

Try “CROWN”:
- C, R, O, W, N.
- O in 3 (✓).
- R in 2 → conflict.

Try “TRUNK”:
- T, R, U, N, K.
- O not in 3 → fails.

Try “PRUNE”:
- P, R, U, N, E → E excluded.

Try “GRUNT”:
- G, R, U, N, T.
- O not in 3 → fails.

Try “FRONT” again—R in 2 conflict.

Let’s try “PROWL”:
- P, R, O, W, L.
- O in 3 (✓).
- R in 2 → conflict.

Try “CROAK”:
- C, R, O, A, K → A excluded.

Try “DROOL” again—R in 2 conflict.

Try “GROAN”:
- G, R, O, A, N → A excluded.

Try “HORDE”:
- H, O, R, D, E → E excluded.

Try “LORAN”:
- L, O, R, A, N → A excluded.

Try “MORAL”:
- M, O, R, A, L → A excluded.

Try “PORCH” again—O in 2.

Try “TORCH” again—O in 2.

Try “VROOM”:
- V, R, O, O, M.
- O in 3 (✓).
- R in 2 → conflict.

Try “WROTE”:
- W, R, O, T, E → E excluded.

Try “XROOM”:
- X, R, O, O, M → O in 3 (✓).
- R in 2 → conflict.

Try “YORUB”:
- Y, O, R, U, B.
- O in 3 (✓).
- R in 2 → conflict.

Try “ZORRO”:
- Z, O, R, R, O → O in 3 (✓).
- R in 2 → conflict.

Hmm, many words have R in position 2. Let’s pick a word with R in position 1 or 4 or 5.

Try “ROBIN” again—O in 2.

Try “ROGER”:
- R, O, G, E, R → E excluded.

Try “RODOR”:
- R, O, D, O, R → O in 3 (✓).
- R in 1 and 5—neither is 2, so this satisfies R not in 2.
- Uses new letters D.

So “RODOR” is valid:
- R in 1 (allowed).
- O in 3 (✓).
- D and another R and O are new letters.

But “RODOR” is a bit obscure. Let’s try a more common word.

Try “TORUS”:
- T, O, R, U, S → S excluded.

Try “TROOP”:
- T, R, O, O, P → R in 2 → conflict.

Try “PROXY”:
- P, R, O, X, Y → O in 3 (✓), R in 2 → conflict.

Try “PRISM”:
- P, R, I, S, M → S excluded.

Try “BRISK”:
- B, R, I, S, K → S excluded.

Try “GRIFT”:
- G, R, I, F, T → O not in 3.

Try “FRUIT”:
- F, R, U, I, T → O not in 3.

Try “PRIMO”:
- P, R, I, M, O → O in 5 → fails.

Try “CRISP”:
- C, R, I, S, P → S excluded.

Try “BRISK” again—S excluded.

Try “DRIFT”:
- D, R, I, F, T → O not in 3.

Try “FROND”:
- F, R, O, N, D → O in 3 (✓), R in 2 → conflict.

Try “GROIN” again—R in 2.

Try “HORDE” again—E excluded.

Try “MORON” again—R in 2.

Try “PORCH” again—O in 2.

Try “TRUNK” again—O not in 3.

Try “VROOM” again—R in 2.

Try “WROTE” again—E excluded.

Try “XROOM” again—R in 2.

Try “YORUB” again—R in 2.

Try “ZORRO” again—R in 2.

It seems most common words with O in 3 have R in 2. Let’s try a word with R in 4 or 5.

Try “BROIL”:
- B, R, O, I, L → O in 3 (✓), R in 2 → conflict.

Try “CROFT”:
- C, R, O, F, T → O in 3 (✓), R in 2 → conflict.

Try “DROOL” again—R in 2.

Try “FROST”:
- F, R, O, S, T → S excluded.

Try “GROIN” again—R in 2.

Try “HORDE” again—E excluded.

Try “MORAL” again—A excluded.

Try “PORCH” again—O in 2.

Try “TORCH” again—O in 2.

Try “VROOM” again—R in 2.

Try “WROTE” again—E excluded.

Try “XROOM” again—R in 2.

Try “YORUB” again—R in 2.

Try “ZORRO” again—R in 2.

Let’s try “ROTOR”:
- R, O, T, O, R → O in 3 (✓), R in 1 and 5—neither is 2, so this satisfies R not in 2.
- Uses new letters T.

“ROTOR” is a valid word and fits all constraints.Based on the feedback:
- O is confirmed in position 3.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A, S, E are not in the word.

A word that satisfies these constraints and introduces new common letters is “ROTOR”.

Let's analyze the new feedback from ROTOR:

R(-) – R is in the word but NOT in position 1.
O(-) – O is in the word but NOT in position 2.
T(-) – T is in the word but NOT in position 3.
O(-) – O is in the word but NOT in position 4.
R(-) – R is in the word but NOT in position 5.

From the first guess (AROSE) we already knew:
- O is in position 3 (✓).
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- A, S, E are not in the word.

Combining both sets of feedback:
- O is fixed in position 3.
- R must be in positions 4 or 5 (since it can't be in 1, 2, or 5 from ROTOR, but wait: from ROTOR R is not in 1, 2, or 5, so R must be in 3 or 4. But 3 is O, so R must be in 4).
Wait, let's re-express R positions:

From AROSE: R not in position 2.
From ROTOR: R not in positions 1, 2, 5. So R must be in 3 or 4. But position 3 is O, so R must be in position 4.

Similarly, T is in the word but not in position 3 (from ROTOR). So T must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5. But 4 is R, so T is in 1, 2, or 5.

Letters known so far:
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: R
- T is somewhere else (positions 1, 2, or 5)
- Other letters: must use remaining letters not yet excluded (A, S, E are out; R, O, T are in).

Possible structure: _ _ O R _ or _ _ O _ R (but R must be in 4), so it's _ _ O R _.

So the word is _ _ O R _ with:
- T somewhere in 1, 2, or 5.
- Remaining letters: must be from unused common letters (I, U, N, L, C, etc.).

Let's try to place T:
Case 1: T in position 1: T _ O R _
Case 2: T in position 2: _ T O R _
Case 3: T in position 5: _ _ O R T

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting these patterns:

Case 1: T _ O R _ → possible: TUTOR, but U is allowed and TUTOR is valid.
Case 2: _ T O R _ → possible:UTOR? Not valid. Maybe: LUTOR? No. Not common.
Case 3: _ _ O R T → possible: CORNT? No. MORT? No. BORT? No.

Looking at Case 1: TUTOR
Check constraints:
- T in 1: allowed (T is in word and not in 3).
- U: not yet excluded.
- T: already used in 1.
- O: in 3 (✓).
- R: in 4 (✓).

TUTOR fits all constraints:
- T is in position 1 (allowed).
- U is new.
- O is in 3.
- R is in 4.
- T is used once (in 1), no conflict.

Let's verify no conflicts:
- A, S, E: excluded (ok).
- R: must be in 4 (ok).
- O: must be in 3 (ok).
- T: must be in word and not in 3 (ok, it's in 1).
- U: new letter.

Thus, TUTOR seems correct.

R(-) – R is in the word but NOT in position 1.
O(-) – O is in the word but NOT in position 2.
T(-) – T is in the word but NOT in position 3.
O(-) – O is in the word but NOT in position 4.
R(-) – R is in the word but NOT in position 5.

From the first guess (AROSE) we already knew:
- O is in position 3 (✓).
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- A, S, E are not in the word.

Combining both sets of feedback:
- O is fixed in position 3.
- R must be in positions 4 or 5 (since it can't be in 1, 2, or 5 from ROTOR, but wait: from ROTOR R is not in 1, 2, or 5, so R must be in 3 or 4. But 3 is O, so R must be in 4).
Wait, let's re-express R positions:

From AROSE: R not in position 2.
From ROTOR: R not in positions 1, 2, 5. So R must be in 3 or 4. But position 3 is O, so R must be in position 4.

Similarly, T is in the word but not in position 3 (from ROTOR). So T must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5. But 4 is R, so T is in 1, 2, or 5.

Letters known so far:
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: R
- T is somewhere else (positions 1, 2, or 5)
- Other letters: must use remaining letters not yet excluded (A, S, E are out; R, O, T are in).

Possible structure: _ _ O R _ or _ _ O _ R (but R must be in 4), so it's _ _ O R _.

So the word is _ _ O R _ with:
- T somewhere in 1, 2, or 5.
- Remaining letters: must be from unused common letters (I, U, N, L, C, etc.).

Let's try to place T:
Case 1: T in position 1: T _ O R _
Case 2: T in position 2: _ T O R _
Case 3: T in position 5: _ _ O R T

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting these patterns:

Case 1: T _ O R _ → possible: TUTOR, but U is allowed and TUTOR is valid.
Case 2: _ T O R _ → possible:UTOR? Not valid. Maybe: LUTOR? No. Not common.
Case 3: _ _ O R T → possible: CORNT? No. MORT? No. BORT? No.

Looking at Case 1: TUTOR
Check constraints:
- T in 1: allowed (T is in word and not in 3).
- U: not yet excluded.
- T: already used in 1.
- O: in 3 (✓).
- R: in 4 (✓).

TUTOR fits all constraints:
- T is in position 1 (allowed).
- U is new.
- O is in 3.
- R is in 4.
- T is used once (in 1), no conflict.

Let's verify no conflicts:
- A, S, E: excluded (ok).
- R: must be in 4 (ok).
- O: must be in 3 (ok).
- T: must be in word and not in 3 (ok, it's in 1).
- U: new letter.

Thus, TUTOR seems correct.",Guess 3: TUTOR -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) U(x) T(-) O(-) R(-),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

Some good starting words include:
- AROSE (contains A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses 5 of the most common letters and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: x → A is not in the word.
- R: - → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O: ✓ → O is in the word and in position 3.
- S: x → S is not in the word.
- E: x → E is not in the word.

So we know:
1. The word has an O in the 3rd position.
2. It contains an R somewhere, but not in position 2.
3. It does NOT contain A, S, or E.

We need a 5-letter word with O in position 3 and an R elsewhere (not position 2). Possible structures: _ _ O _ _ or _ _ O _ R or _ _ O R _ etc.

Good letters to try next: common consonants like T, N, L, D, C, M, P, plus vowels I, U.

Let’s pick a word that introduces several new common letters while fitting the constraints.  
A strong candidate is “FRONT”:
- F, R, O, N, T.
- O is in position 3 (matches ✓).
- R is in position 2 (but feedback says R is in the word but NOT in position 2, so this would conflict).  
Oops—R in position 2 is disallowed.

Next try “DROOL”:
- D, R, O, O, L.
- O in position 3 (✓).
- R in position 2 (-) → conflict again.

Try “CROOK”:
- C, R, O, O, K.
- O in position 3 (✓).
- R in position 2 (-) → conflict again.

Try “ROTOR”:
- R, O, T, O, R.
- O in position 3 (✓).
- R appears twice, but one R is in position 1 and the other in 5—neither is position 2, so this satisfies the R constraint.
- Uses new letters T and another R, but we already know R is in the word.

But we might prefer to test more new letters. Let’s try “BROIL”:
- B, R, O, I, L.
- O in position 3 (✓).
- R in position 2 (-) → conflict again.

Try “GROIN”:
- G, R, O, I, N.
- O in position 3 (✓).
- R in position 2 (-) → conflict.

Try “TRUCK”:
- T, R, U, C, K.
- O not in position 3 → fails.

Try “PRONG”:
- P, R, O, N, G.
- O in position 3 (✓).
- R in position 2 (-) → conflict.

Try “CRONY”:
- C, R, O, N, Y.
- O in position 3 (✓).
- R in position 2 (-) → conflict.

Try “FORGO”:
- F, O, R, G, O.

- O in position 2, not 3 → fails.

Try “TORCH”:
- T, O, R, C, H.
- O in position 2 → fails.

Try “ROBIN”:
- R, O, B, I, N.
- O in position 2 → fails.

Try “MOTOR”:

- O in position 2 → fails.

Try “TROOP”:
- T, R, O, O, P.
- O in position 3 (✓).
- R in position 2 (-) → conflict.

Try “BROOM”:
- B, R, O, O, M.
- O in position 3 (✓).
- R in position 2 (-) → conflict.

Try “DROLL”:
- D, R, O, L, L.
- O in position 3 (✓).
- R in position 2 (-) → conflict.

Try “FROST”:
- F, R, O, S, T.
- S is excluded → fails.

Try “GROIN” again—R in position 2 conflict.

Let’s list words with O in position 3 and R not in position 2:
- _ _ O _ _ with R in 1,4,5.
- _ _ O R _ (R in 4).
- _ _ O _ R (R in 5).

Possible words:
- BORON (but has O twice, and N is new)
- CORGI (but G is less common)
- FORGE (E excluded)
- HORDE (E excluded)
- MORON (O twice)
- PORCH (O in 2)
- TORUS (S excluded)

Try “MORON”:
- M, O, R, O, N.
- O in 3 (✓).
- R in 2 → conflict.

Try “CROWN”:
- C, R, O, W, N.
- O in 3 (✓).
- R in 2 → conflict.

Try “TRUNK”:
- T, R, U, N, K.
- O not in 3 → fails.

Try “PRUNE”:
- P, R, U, N, E → E excluded.

Try “GRUNT”:
- G, R, U, N, T.
- O not in 3 → fails.

Try “FRONT” again—R in 2 conflict.

Let’s try “PROWL”:
- P, R, O, W, L.
- O in 3 (✓).
- R in 2 → conflict.

Try “CROAK”:
- C, R, O, A, K → A excluded.

Try “DROOL” again—R in 2 conflict.

Try “GROAN”:
- G, R, O, A, N → A excluded.

Try “HORDE”:
- H, O, R, D, E → E excluded.

Try “LORAN”:
- L, O, R, A, N → A excluded.

Try “MORAL”:
- M, O, R, A, L → A excluded.

Try “PORCH” again—O in 2.

Try “TORCH” again—O in 2.

Try “VROOM”:
- V, R, O, O, M.
- O in 3 (✓).
- R in 2 → conflict.

Try “WROTE”:
- W, R, O, T, E → E excluded.

Try “XROOM”:
- X, R, O, O, M → O in 3 (✓).
- R in 2 → conflict.

Try “YORUB”:
- Y, O, R, U, B.
- O in 3 (✓).
- R in 2 → conflict.

Try “ZORRO”:
- Z, O, R, R, O → O in 3 (✓).
- R in 2 → conflict.

Hmm, many words have R in position 2. Let’s pick a word with R in position 1 or 4 or 5.

Try “ROBIN” again—O in 2.

Try “ROGER”:
- R, O, G, E, R → E excluded.

Try “RODOR”:
- R, O, D, O, R → O in 3 (✓).
- R in 1 and 5—neither is 2, so this satisfies R not in 2.
- Uses new letters D.

So “RODOR” is valid:
- R in 1 (allowed).
- O in 3 (✓).
- D and another R and O are new letters.

But “RODOR” is a bit obscure. Let’s try a more common word.

Try “TORUS”:
- T, O, R, U, S → S excluded.

Try “TROOP”:
- T, R, O, O, P → R in 2 → conflict.

Try “PROXY”:
- P, R, O, X, Y → O in 3 (✓), R in 2 → conflict.

Try “PRISM”:
- P, R, I, S, M → S excluded.

Try “BRISK”:
- B, R, I, S, K → S excluded.

Try “GRIFT”:

Try “FRUIT”:
- F, R, U, I, T → O not in 3.

Try “PRIMO”:
- P, R, I, M, O → O in 5 → fails.

Try “CRISP”:
- C, R, I, S, P → S excluded.

Try “BRISK” again—S excluded.

Try “DRIFT”:
- D, R, I, F, T → O not in 3.

Try “FROND”:
- F, R, O, N, D → O in 3 (✓), R in 2 → conflict.

Try “GROIN” again—R in 2.

Try “HORDE” again—E excluded.

Try “MORON” again—R in 2.

Try “PORCH” again—O in 2.

Try “TRUNK” again—O not in 3.

Try “VROOM” again—R in 2.

Try “WROTE” again—E excluded.

Try “XROOM” again—R in 2.

Try “YORUB” again—R in 2.

Try “ZORRO” again—R in 2.

It seems most common words with O in 3 have R in 2. Let’s try a word with R in 4 or 5.

Try “BROIL”:
- B, R, O, I, L → O in 3 (✓), R in 2 → conflict.

Try “CROFT”:
- C, R, O, F, T → O in 3 (✓), R in 2 → conflict.

Try “DROOL” again—R in 2.

Try “FROST”:
- F, R, O, S, T → S excluded.

Try “GROIN” again—R in 2.

Try “HORDE” again—E excluded.

Try “MORAL” again—A excluded.

Try “PORCH” again—O in 2.

Try “TORCH” again—O in 2.

Try “VROOM” again—R in 2.

Try “WROTE” again—E excluded.

Try “XROOM” again—R in 2.

Try “YORUB” again—R in 2.

Try “ZORRO” again—R in 2.

Let’s try “ROTOR”:
- R, O, T, O, R → O in 3 (✓), R in 1 and 5—neither is 2, so this satisfies R not in 2.
- Uses new letters T.

“ROTOR” is a valid word and fits all constraints.Based on the feedback:
- O is confirmed in position 3.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A, S, E are not in the word.

A word that satisfies these constraints and introduces new common letters is “ROTOR”.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ROTOR -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) T(-) O(-) R(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's analyze the new feedback from ROTOR:

R(-) – R is in the word but NOT in position 1.
O(-) – O is in the word but NOT in position 2.
T(-) – T is in the word but NOT in position 3.
O(-) – O is in the word but NOT in position 4.
R(-) – R is in the word but NOT in position 5.

From the first guess (AROSE) we already knew:
- O is in position 3 (✓).
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- A, S, E are not in the word.

Combining both sets of feedback:
- O is fixed in position 3.
- R must be in positions 4 or 5 (since it can't be in 1, 2, or 5 from ROTOR, but wait: from ROTOR R is not in 1, 2, or 5, so R must be in 3 or 4. But 3 is O, so R must be in 4).
Wait, let's re-express R positions:

From AROSE: R not in position 2.
From ROTOR: R not in positions 1, 2, 5. So R must be in 3 or 4. But position 3 is O, so R must be in position 4.

Similarly, T is in the word but not in position 3 (from ROTOR). So T must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5. But 4 is R, so T is in 1, 2, or 5.

Letters known so far:
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: R
- T is somewhere else (positions 1, 2, or 5)
- Other letters: must use remaining letters not yet excluded (A, S, E are out; R, O, T are in).

Possible structure: _ _ O R _ or _ _ O _ R (but R must be in 4), so it's _ _ O R _.

So the word is _ _ O R _ with:
- T somewhere in 1, 2, or 5.
- Remaining letters: must be from unused common letters (I, U, N, L, C, etc.).

Let's try to place T:
Case 1: T in position 1: T _ O R _
Case 2: T in position 2: _ T O R _
Case 3: T in position 5: _ _ O R T

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting these patterns:

Case 1: T _ O R _ → possible: TUTOR, but U is allowed and TUTOR is valid.
Case 2: _ T O R _ → possible:UTOR? Not valid. Maybe: LUTOR? No. Not common.
Case 3: _ _ O R T → possible: CORNT? No. MORT? No. BORT? No.

Looking at Case 1: TUTOR
Check constraints:
- T in 1: allowed (T is in word and not in 3).
- U: not yet excluded.
- T: already used in 1.
- O: in 3 (✓).
- R: in 4 (✓).

TUTOR fits all constraints:
- T is in position 1 (allowed).
- U is new.
- O is in 3.
- R is in 4.
- T is used once (in 1), no conflict.

Let's verify no conflicts:
- A, S, E: excluded (ok).
- R: must be in 4 (ok).
- O: must be in 3 (ok).
- T: must be in word and not in 3 (ok, it's in 1).
- U: new letter.

Thus, TUTOR seems correct.

Let's consolidate everything we now know:

1. From AROSE:  
   A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ O is in position 3.  
   ⇒ R is in the word but NOT in position 2.

2. From ROTOR:  
   R(-) O(-) T(-) O(-) R(-)  
   ⇒ R is NOT in positions 1, 2, or 5.  
   ⇒ O is NOT in positions 2 or 4.  
   ⇒ T is in the word but NOT in position 3.  

3. From TUTOR:  
   T(✓) U(x) T(-) O(-) R(-)  
   ⇒ T is in position 1.  
   ⇒ U is NOT in the word.  
   ⇒ Second T is NOT in position 2 (but we already know T is in position 1, so this is consistent).  
   ⇒ O is NOT in position 4 (already known).  
   ⇒ R is NOT in position 5 (already known).

Putting it all together:

- Position 1: T (fixed)  
- Position 3: O (fixed)  
- Position 4: R (since R cannot be in 2 or 5, and 1 is T, 3 is O)  
- T must also appear somewhere else (positions 2 or 5), but we already have T in 1.  
  However, the second T in TUTOR was marked (-), meaning T cannot be in position 2.  
  Therefore T must be in position 5.  

So the word structure is:  
T _ O R T

We need to find a valid 5-letter English word matching this pattern.  
The only common word fitting this is ""TOROT"" – but that is not a valid English word.  
Wait, let's double-check: the pattern is T _ O R T.  

Actually, ""TORT"" is 4 letters, but we need 5.  
Looking at valid English 5-letter words:  
- TOTEM – but E is excluded.  
- TOTSY – S is excluded.  
- TOTTO – not a word.  
- TOTED – E excluded.  

Hmm, seems like no common 5-letter word fits T _ O R T.  
Let me re-examine constraints:

Wait, the second T in TUTOR was in position 3, but we know O is in position 3, so that T cannot be there anyway.  
But the feedback for TUTOR was:  
T(✓) U(x) T(-) O(-) R(-)  

This means:  
- T is in position 1 (✓).  
- U is not in the word (x).  
- The second T is in position 3, but the feedback (-) means T is NOT in position 3 (which is already satisfied because position 3 is O).  
- O is NOT in position 4 (already known).  
- R is NOT in position 5 (already known).  

Therefore, the only constraints we have are:  
1. T in position 1.  
2. O in position 3.  
3. R in position 4 (since it cannot be in 2 or 5).  
4. T must appear somewhere else (positions 2 or 5), but position 1 is T, and position 3 is O, position 4 is R.  
   The only remaining positions are 2 and 5.  
   The second T cannot be in position 2 (because the second T in TUTOR was in position 2 and got (-), meaning T is not in position 2).  
   Therefore T must be in position 5.  

Thus the word must be: T _ O R T, which is ""TORT?"" but we need 5 letters.  

Wait, the word must be T _ O R T, but that would be 5 letters: T (1), ? (2), O (3), R (4), T (5).  

The only valid English word fitting this is ""TOROT"" – but that is not a recognized word.  

Let me check again: perhaps I misread. The feedback for TUTOR was:  
T(✓) U(x) T(-) O(-) R(-)  

This means:  
- Position 1: T (✓)  
- Position 2: U (x) – so U is not in the word.  
- Position 3: T (-) – so T is not in position 3 (but position 3 is O, so this is fine).  
- Position 4: O (-) – so O is not in position 4 (already known).  
- Position 5: R (-) – so R is not in position 5 (already known).  

Therefore, the word is:  
T _ O R _  
with T in position 1, O in 3, R in 4, and T must appear somewhere else (positions 2 or 5).  
But position 2 cannot be T (because the second T in TUTOR was in position 2 and got (-)).  
Therefore T must be in position 5.  

Thus the word must be T _ O R T, which is ""TOROT"" – but that is invalid.  

Wait, let me think differently: maybe the word is T _ O R _ and we have T in position 1, O in 3, R in 4, and no second T.  
But the feedback for TUTOR's second T was (-), meaning T is not in position 3 (which is already satisfied), but does not necessarily mean T is only in position 1.  

So perhaps the word is simply T _ O R _ with T in position 1, O in 3, R in 4, and position 2 and 5 filled with other letters.  

Let me list possible letters for position 2 and 5:  
Excluded letters so far: A, S, E, U.  
R is already in 4.  
T is in 1.  
O is in 3.  

Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

Looking for common words:  
- T B O R N – ""TBORN"" – no.  
- T C O R N – ""TCORN"" – no.  
- T I O R N – ""TIORN"" – no.  
- T H O R N – ""THORN"" – yes!  

Let's check ""THORN"":  
T(✓) H O R N  
- T is in position 1 (matches).  
- H is new.  
- O is in position 3 (matches).

No conflicts with previous feedback.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

Some good starting words include:
- AROSE (contains A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses 5 of the most common letters and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

- O: ✓ → O is in the word and in position 3.
- S: x → S is not in the word.
- E: x → E is not in the word.

So we know:
1. The word has an O in the 3rd position.
2. It contains an R somewhere, but not in position 2.
3. It does NOT contain A, S, or E.

We need a 5-letter word with O in position 3 and an R elsewhere (not position 2). Possible structures: _ _ O _ _ or _ _ O _ R or _ _ O R _ etc.

Good letters to try next: common consonants like T, N, L, D, C, M, P, plus vowels I, U.

Let’s pick a word that introduces several new common letters while fitting the constraints.  
A strong candidate is “FRONT”:
- F, R, O, N, T.
- O is in position 3 (matches ✓).
- R is in position 2 (but feedback says R is in the word but NOT in position 2, so this would conflict).  
Oops—R in position 2 is disallowed.

Next try “DROOL”:
- D, R, O, O, L.
- O in position 3 (✓).
- R in position 2 (-) → conflict again.

Try “CROOK”:
- C, R, O, O, K.
- O in position 3 (✓).
- R in position 2 (-) → conflict again.

Try “ROTOR”:
- R, O, T, O, R.
- O in position 3 (✓).
- R appears twice, but one R is in position 1 and the other in 5—neither is position 2, so this satisfies the R constraint.
- Uses new letters T and another R, but we already know R is in the word.

But we might prefer to test more new letters. Let’s try “BROIL”:
- B, R, O, I, L.
- O in position 3 (✓).
- R in position 2 (-) → conflict again.

Try “GROIN”:
- G, R, O, I, N.

- R in position 2 (-) → conflict.

Try “CRONY”:

- R in position 2 (-) → conflict.

Try “FORGO”:

- O in position 3 (✓).
- R in position 2 (-) → conflict.

Try “BROOM”:
- B, R, O, O, M.
- O in position 3 (✓).
- R in position 2 (-) → conflict.

Try “DROLL”:
- D, R, O, L, L.
- O in position 3 (✓).
- R in position 2 (-) → conflict.

Try “FROST”:
- F, R, O, S, T.
- S is excluded → fails.

Try “GROIN” again—R in position 2 conflict.

Let’s list words with O in position 3 and R not in position 2:
- _ _ O _ _ with R in 1,4,5.
- _ _ O R _ (R in 4).
- _ _ O _ R (R in 5).

Possible words:
- BORON (but has O twice, and N is new)
- CORGI (but G is less common)
- FORGE (E excluded)
- HORDE (E excluded)
- MORON (O twice)
- PORCH (O in 2)
- TORUS (S excluded)

Try “MORON”:
- M, O, R, O, N.
- O in 3 (✓).
- R in 2 → conflict.

Try “CROWN”:
- C, R, O, W, N.
- O in 3 (✓).
- R in 2 → conflict.

Try “TRUNK”:
- T, R, U, N, K.
- O not in 3 → fails.

Try “PRUNE”:
- P, R, U, N, E → E excluded.

Try “GRUNT”:
- G, R, U, N, T.
- O not in 3 → fails.

Try “FRONT” again—R in 2 conflict.

Let’s try “PROWL”:
- P, R, O, W, L.
- O in 3 (✓).
- R in 2 → conflict.

Try “CROAK”:
- C, R, O, A, K → A excluded.

Try “DROOL” again—R in 2 conflict.

Try “GROAN”:
- G, R, O, A, N → A excluded.

Try “HORDE”:
- H, O, R, D, E → E excluded.

Try “LORAN”:
- L, O, R, A, N → A excluded.

Try “MORAL”:
- M, O, R, A, L → A excluded.

Try “PORCH” again—O in 2.

Try “TORCH” again—O in 2.

Try “VROOM”:
- V, R, O, O, M.
- O in 3 (✓).
- R in 2 → conflict.

Try “WROTE”:
- W, R, O, T, E → E excluded.

Try “XROOM”:
- X, R, O, O, M → O in 3 (✓).
- R in 2 → conflict.

Try “YORUB”:
- Y, O, R, U, B.
- O in 3 (✓).
- R in 2 → conflict.

Try “ZORRO”:
- Z, O, R, R, O → O in 3 (✓).
- R in 2 → conflict.

Hmm, many words have R in position 2. Let’s pick a word with R in position 1 or 4 or 5.

Try “ROBIN” again—O in 2.

Try “ROGER”:
- R, O, G, E, R → E excluded.

Try “RODOR”:
- R, O, D, O, R → O in 3 (✓).
- R in 1 and 5—neither is 2, so this satisfies R not in 2.
- Uses new letters D.

So “RODOR” is valid:
- R in 1 (allowed).
- O in 3 (✓).
- D and another R and O are new letters.

But “RODOR” is a bit obscure. Let’s try a more common word.

Try “TORUS”:
- T, O, R, U, S → S excluded.

Try “TROOP”:
- T, R, O, O, P → R in 2 → conflict.

Try “PROXY”:
- P, R, O, X, Y → O in 3 (✓), R in 2 → conflict.

Try “PRISM”:
- P, R, I, S, M → S excluded.

Try “BRISK”:
- B, R, I, S, K → S excluded.

Try “GRIFT”:

Try “FRUIT”:
- F, R, U, I, T → O not in 3.

Try “PRIMO”:
- P, R, I, M, O → O in 5 → fails.

Try “CRISP”:
- C, R, I, S, P → S excluded.

Try “BRISK” again—S excluded.

Try “DRIFT”:
- D, R, I, F, T → O not in 3.

Try “FROND”:
- F, R, O, N, D → O in 3 (✓), R in 2 → conflict.

Try “GROIN” again—R in 2.

Try “HORDE” again—E excluded.

Try “MORON” again—R in 2.

Try “PORCH” again—O in 2.

Try “TRUNK” again—O not in 3.

Try “VROOM” again—R in 2.

Try “WROTE” again—E excluded.

Try “XROOM” again—R in 2.

Try “YORUB” again—R in 2.

Try “ZORRO” again—R in 2.

It seems most common words with O in 3 have R in 2. Let’s try a word with R in 4 or 5.

Try “BROIL”:
- B, R, O, I, L → O in 3 (✓), R in 2 → conflict.

Try “CROFT”:
- C, R, O, F, T → O in 3 (✓), R in 2 → conflict.

Try “DROOL” again—R in 2.

Try “FROST”:
- F, R, O, S, T → S excluded.

Try “GROIN” again—R in 2.

Try “HORDE” again—E excluded.

Try “MORAL” again—A excluded.

Try “PORCH” again—O in 2.

Try “TORCH” again—O in 2.

Try “VROOM” again—R in 2.

Try “WROTE” again—E excluded.

Try “XROOM” again—R in 2.

Try “YORUB” again—R in 2.

Try “ZORRO” again—R in 2.

Let’s try “ROTOR”:
- R, O, T, O, R → O in 3 (✓), R in 1 and 5—neither is 2, so this satisfies R not in 2.
- Uses new letters T.

“ROTOR” is a valid word and fits all constraints.Based on the feedback:
- O is confirmed in position 3.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A, S, E are not in the word.

A word that satisfies these constraints and introduces new common letters is “ROTOR”.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ROTOR -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) T(-) O(-) R(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's analyze the new feedback from ROTOR:

R(-) – R is in the word but NOT in position 1.
O(-) – O is in the word but NOT in position 2.
T(-) – T is in the word but NOT in position 3.
O(-) – O is in the word but NOT in position 4.
R(-) – R is in the word but NOT in position 5.

From the first guess (AROSE) we already knew:
- O is in position 3 (✓).
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- A, S, E are not in the word.

Combining both sets of feedback:
- O is fixed in position 3.
- R must be in positions 4 or 5 (since it can't be in 1, 2, or 5 from ROTOR, but wait: from ROTOR R is not in 1, 2, or 5, so R must be in 3 or 4. But 3 is O, so R must be in 4).
Wait, let's re-express R positions:

From AROSE: R not in position 2.
From ROTOR: R not in positions 1, 2, 5. So R must be in 3 or 4. But position 3 is O, so R must be in position 4.

Similarly, T is in the word but not in position 3 (from ROTOR). So T must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5. But 4 is R, so T is in 1, 2, or 5.

Letters known so far:
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: R
- T is somewhere else (positions 1, 2, or 5)
- Other letters: must use remaining letters not yet excluded (A, S, E are out; R, O, T are in).

Possible structure: _ _ O R _ or _ _ O _ R (but R must be in 4), so it's _ _ O R _.

So the word is _ _ O R _ with:
- T somewhere in 1, 2, or 5.
- Remaining letters: must be from unused common letters (I, U, N, L, C, etc.).

Let's try to place T:
Case 1: T in position 1: T _ O R _
Case 2: T in position 2: _ T O R _
Case 3: T in position 5: _ _ O R T

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting these patterns:

Case 1: T _ O R _ → possible: TUTOR, but U is allowed and TUTOR is valid.
Case 2: _ T O R _ → possible:UTOR? Not valid. Maybe: LUTOR? No. Not common.
Case 3: _ _ O R T → possible: CORNT? No. MORT? No. BORT? No.

Looking at Case 1: TUTOR
Check constraints:
- T in 1: allowed (T is in word and not in 3).
- U: not yet excluded.
- T: already used in 1.
- O: in 3 (✓).
- R: in 4 (✓).

TUTOR fits all constraints:
- T is in position 1 (allowed).
- U is new.
- O is in 3.
- R is in 4.
- T is used once (in 1), no conflict.

Let's verify no conflicts:
- A, S, E: excluded (ok).
- R: must be in 4 (ok).
- O: must be in 3 (ok).
- T: must be in word and not in 3 (ok, it's in 1).
- U: new letter.

Thus, TUTOR seems correct.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ROTOR -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) T(-) O(-) R(-)
Guess 3: TUTOR -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) U(x) T(-) O(-) R(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's consolidate everything we now know:

1. From AROSE:  
   A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ O is in position 3.  
   ⇒ R is in the word but NOT in position 2.

2. From ROTOR:  
   R(-) O(-) T(-) O(-) R(-)  
   ⇒ R is NOT in positions 1, 2, or 5.  
   ⇒ O is NOT in positions 2 or 4.  
   ⇒ T is in the word but NOT in position 3.  

3. From TUTOR:  
   T(✓) U(x) T(-) O(-) R(-)  
   ⇒ T is in position 1.  
   ⇒ U is NOT in the word.  
   ⇒ Second T is NOT in position 2 (but we already know T is in position 1, so this is consistent).  
   ⇒ O is NOT in position 4 (already known).  
   ⇒ R is NOT in position 5 (already known).

Putting it all together:

- Position 1: T (fixed)  
- Position 3: O (fixed)  
- Position 4: R (since R cannot be in 2 or 5, and 1 is T, 3 is O)  
- T must also appear somewhere else (positions 2 or 5), but we already have T in 1.  
  However, the second T in TUTOR was marked (-), meaning T cannot be in position 2.  
  Therefore T must be in position 5.  

So the word structure is:  
T _ O R T

We need to find a valid 5-letter English word matching this pattern.  
The only common word fitting this is ""TOROT"" – but that is not a valid English word.  
Wait, let's double-check: the pattern is T _ O R T.  

Actually, ""TORT"" is 4 letters, but we need 5.  
Looking at valid English 5-letter words:  
- TOTEM – but E is excluded.  
- TOTSY – S is excluded.  
- TOTTO – not a word.  
- TOTED – E excluded.  

Hmm, seems like no common 5-letter word fits T _ O R T.  
Let me re-examine constraints:

Wait, the second T in TUTOR was in position 3, but we know O is in position 3, so that T cannot be there anyway.  
But the feedback for TUTOR was:  
T(✓) U(x) T(-) O(-) R(-)  

This means:  
- T is in position 1 (✓).  
- U is not in the word (x).  
- The second T is in position 3, but the feedback (-) means T is NOT in position 3 (which is already satisfied because position 3 is O).  
- O is NOT in position 4 (already known).  
- R is NOT in position 5 (already known).  

Therefore, the only constraints we have are:  
1. T in position 1.  
2. O in position 3.  
3. R in position 4 (since it cannot be in 2 or 5).  
4. T must appear somewhere else (positions 2 or 5), but position 1 is T, and position 3 is O, position 4 is R.  
   The only remaining positions are 2 and 5.  
   The second T cannot be in position 2 (because the second T in TUTOR was in position 2 and got (-), meaning T is not in position 2).  
   Therefore T must be in position 5.  

Thus the word must be: T _ O R T, which is ""TORT?"" but we need 5 letters.  

Wait, the word must be T _ O R T, but that would be 5 letters: T (1), ? (2), O (3), R (4), T (5).  

The only valid English word fitting this is ""TOROT"" – but that is not a recognized word.  

Let me check again: perhaps I misread. The feedback for TUTOR was:  
T(✓) U(x) T(-) O(-) R(-)  

This means:  
- Position 1: T (✓)  
- Position 2: U (x) – so U is not in the word.  
- Position 3: T (-) – so T is not in position 3 (but position 3 is O, so this is fine).  
- Position 4: O (-) – so O is not in position 4 (already known).  
- Position 5: R (-) – so R is not in position 5 (already known).  

Therefore, the word is:  
T _ O R _  
with T in position 1, O in 3, R in 4, and T must appear somewhere else (positions 2 or 5).  
But position 2 cannot be T (because the second T in TUTOR was in position 2 and got (-)).  
Therefore T must be in position 5.  

Thus the word must be T _ O R T, which is ""TOROT"" – but that is invalid.  

Wait, let me think differently: maybe the word is T _ O R _ and we have T in position 1, O in 3, R in 4, and no second T.  
But the feedback for TUTOR's second T was (-), meaning T is not in position 3 (which is already satisfied), but does not necessarily mean T is only in position 1.  

So perhaps the word is simply T _ O R _ with T in position 1, O in 3, R in 4, and position 2 and 5 filled with other letters.  

Let me list possible letters for position 2 and 5:  
Excluded letters so far: A, S, E, U.  
R is already in 4.  
T is in 1.  
O is in 3.  

Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

Looking for common words:  
- T B O R N – ""TBORN"" – no.  
- T C O R N – ""TCORN"" – no.  
- T I O R N – ""TIORN"" – no.  
- T H O R N – ""THORN"" – yes!  

Let's check ""THORN"":  
T(✓) H O R N  
- T is in position 1 (matches).  
- H is new.  
- O is in position 3 (matches).  
- R is in position 4 (matches).  
- N is new.  

No conflicts with previous feedback.  

Thus, the next guess should be ""THORN"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

Some good starting words include:
- AROSE (contains A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses 5 of the most common letters and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: x → A is not in the word.
- R: - → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O: ✓ → O is in the word and in position 3.
- S: x → S is not in the word.
- E: x → E is not in the word.

So we know:
1. The word has an O in the 3rd position.
2. It contains an R somewhere, but not in position 2.
3. It does NOT contain A, S, or E.

We need a 5-letter word with O in position 3 and an R elsewhere (not position 2). Possible structures: _ _ O _ _ or _ _ O _ R or _ _ O R _ etc.

Good letters to try next: common consonants like T, N, L, D, C, M, P, plus vowels I, U.

Let’s pick a word that introduces several new common letters while fitting the constraints.  
A strong candidate is “FRONT”:
- F, R, O, N, T.
- O is in position 3 (matches ✓).
- R is in position 2 (but feedback says R is in the word but NOT in position 2, so this would conflict).  
Oops—R in position 2 is disallowed.

Next try “DROOL”:
- D, R, O, O, L.
- O in position 3 (✓).
- R in position 2 (-) → conflict again.

Try “CROOK”:
- C, R, O, O, K.
- O in position 3 (✓).
- R in position 2 (-) → conflict again.

Try “ROTOR”:
- R, O, T, O, R.
- O in position 3 (✓).
- R appears twice, but one R is in position 1 and the other in 5—neither is position 2, so this satisfies the R constraint.
- Uses new letters T and another R, but we already know R is in the word.

But we might prefer to test more new letters. Let’s try “BROIL”:
- B, R, O, I, L.
- O in position 3 (✓).
- R in position 2 (-) → conflict again.

Try “GROIN”:
- G, R, O, I, N.
- O in position 3 (✓).
- R in position 2 (-) → conflict.

Try “TRUCK”:
- T, R, U, C, K.
- O not in position 3 → fails.

Try “PRONG”:
- P, R, O, N, G.
- O in position 3 (✓).
- R in position 2 (-) → conflict.

Try “CRONY”:
- C, R, O, N, Y.
- O in position 3 (✓).
- R in position 2 (-) → conflict.

Try “FORGO”:
- F, O, R, G, O.
- O in position 3 (✓).
- R in position 3 (but position 3 is O) → conflict.

Hmm, many words have R in position 2. Let’s pick a word with R in position 1 or 4 or 5.

Try “ROBIN” again—O in 2.

Try “ROGER”:
- R, O, G, E, R → E excluded.

Try “RODOR”:
- R, O, D, O, R → O in 3 (✓).
- R in 1 and 5—neither is 2, so this satisfies R not in 2.
- Uses new letters D.

So “RODOR” is valid:
- R in 1 (allowed).
- O in 3 (✓).
- D and another R and O are new letters.

But “RODOR” is a bit obscure. Let’s try a more common word.

Try “ZORRO” again—R in 2.

It seems most common words with O in 3 have R in 2. Let’s try a word with R in 4 or 5.

Try “BROIL”:
- B, R, O, I, L → O in 3 (✓), R in 2 → conflict.

Try “CROFT”:
- C, R, O, F, T → O in 3 (✓), R in 2 → conflict.

Try “XROOM” again—R in 2.

Try “ZORRO” again—R in 2.

Let’s try “ROTOR”:
- R, O, T, O, R → O in 3 (✓), R in 1 and 5—neither is 2, so this satisfies R not in 2.
- Uses new letters T.

“ROTOR” is a valid word and fits all constraints.Based on the feedback:
- O is confirmed in position 3.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A, S, E are not in the word.

A word that satisfies these constraints and introduces new common letters is “ROTOR”.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ROTOR -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) T(-) O(-) R(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's analyze the new feedback from ROTOR:

R(-) – R is in the word but NOT in position 1.
O(-) – O is in the word but NOT in position 2.
T(-) – T is in the word but NOT in position 3.
O(-) – O is in the word but NOT in position 4.
R(-) – R is in the word but NOT in position 5.

From the first guess (AROSE) we already knew:
- O is in position 3 (✓).
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- A, S, E are not in the word.

Combining both sets of feedback:
- O is fixed in position 3.
- R must be in positions 4 or 5 (since it can't be in 1, 2, or 5 from ROTOR, but wait: from ROTOR R is not in 1, 2, or 5, so R must be in 3 or 4. But 3 is O, so R must be in 4).
Wait, let's re-express R positions:

From AROSE: R not in position 2.
From ROTOR: R not in positions 1, 2, 5. So R must be in 3 or 4. But position 3 is O, so R must be in position 4.

Similarly, T is in the word but not in position 3 (from ROTOR). So T must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5. But 4 is R, so T is in 1, 2, or 5.

Letters known so far:
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: R
- T is somewhere else (positions 1, 2, or 5)
- Other letters: must use remaining letters not yet excluded (A, S, E are out; R, O, T are in).

Possible structure: _ _ O R _ or _ _ O _ R (but R must be in 4), so it's _ _ O R _.

So the word is _ _ O R _ with:
- T somewhere in 1, 2, or 5.
- Remaining letters: must be from unused common letters (I, U, N, L, C, etc.).

Let's try to place T:
Case 1: T in position 1: T _ O R _
Case 2: T in position 2: _ T O R _
Case 3: T in position 5: _ _ O R T

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting these patterns:

Case 1: T _ O R _ → possible: TUTOR, but U is allowed and TUTOR is valid.
Case 2: _ T O R _ → possible:UTOR? Not valid. Maybe: LUTOR? No. Not common.
Case 3: _ _ O R T → possible: CORNT? No. MORT? No. BORT? No.

Looking at Case 1: TUTOR
Check constraints:
- T in 1: allowed (T is in word and not in 3).
- U: not yet excluded.
- T: already used in 1.
- O: in 3 (✓).
- R: in 4 (✓).

TUTOR fits all constraints:
- T is in position 1 (allowed).
- U is new.
- O is in 3.
- R is in 4.
- T is used once (in 1), no conflict.

Let's verify no conflicts:
- A, S, E: excluded (ok).
- R: must be in 4 (ok).
- O: must be in 3 (ok).
- T: must be in word and not in 3 (ok, it's in 1).
- U: new letter.

Thus, TUTOR seems correct.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ROTOR -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) T(-) O(-) R(-)
Guess 3: TUTOR -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) U(x) T(-) O(-) R(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's consolidate everything we now know:

1. From AROSE:  
   A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ O is in position 3.  
   ⇒ R is in the word but NOT in position 2.

2. From ROTOR:  
   R(-) O(-) T(-) O(-) R(-)  
   ⇒ R is NOT in positions 1, 2, or 5.  
   ⇒ O is NOT in positions 2 or 4.  
   ⇒ T is in the word but NOT in position 3.  

3. From TUTOR:  
   T(✓) U(x) T(-) O(-) R(-)  
   ⇒ T is in position 1.  
   ⇒ U is NOT in the word.  
   ⇒ Second T is NOT in position 2 (but we already know T is in position 1, so this is consistent).  
   ⇒ O is NOT in position 4 (already known).  
   ⇒ R is NOT in position 5 (already known).

Putting it all together:

- Position 1: T (fixed)  
- Position 3: O (fixed)  
- Position 4: R (since R cannot be in 2 or 5, and 1 is T, 3 is O)  
- T must also appear somewhere else (positions 2 or 5), but we already have T in 1.  
  However, the second T in TUTOR was marked (-), meaning T cannot be in position 2.  
  Therefore T must be in position 5.  

So the word structure is:  
T _ O R T

We need to find a valid 5-letter English word matching this pattern.  
The only common word fitting this is ""TOROT"" – but that is not a valid English word.  
Wait, let's double-check: the pattern is T _ O R T.  

Actually, ""TORT"" is 4 letters, but we need 5.  
Looking at valid English 5-letter words:  
- TOTEM – but E is excluded.  
- TOTSY – S is excluded.  
- TOTTO – not a word.  
- TOTED – E excluded.  

Hmm, seems like no common 5-letter word fits T _ O R T.  
Let me re-examine constraints:

Wait, the second T in TUTOR was in position 3, but we know O is in position 3, so that T cannot be there anyway.  
But the feedback for TUTOR was:  
T(✓) U(x) T(-) O(-) R(-)  

This means:  
- T is in position 1 (✓).  
- U is not in the word (x).  
- The second T is in position 3, but the feedback (-) means T is NOT in position 3 (which is already satisfied because position 3 is O).  
- O is NOT in position 4 (already known).  
- R is NOT in position 5 (already known).  

Therefore, the only constraints we have are:  
1. T in position 1.  
2. O in position 3.  
3. R in position 4 (since it cannot be in 2 or 5).  
4. T must appear somewhere else (positions 2 or 5), but position 1 is T, and position 3 is O, position 4 is R.  
   The only remaining positions are 2 and 5.  
   The second T cannot be in position 2 (because the second T in TUTOR was in position 2 and got (-), meaning T is not in position 2).  
   Therefore T must be in position 5.  

Thus the word must be: T _ O R T, which is ""TORT?"" but we need 5 letters.  

Wait, the word must be T _ O R T, but that would be 5 letters: T (1), ? (2), O (3), R (4), T (5).  

The only valid English word fitting this is ""TOROT"" – but that is not a recognized word.  

Let me check again: perhaps I misread. The feedback for TUTOR was:  
T(✓) U(x) T(-) O(-) R(-)  

This means:  
- Position 1: T (✓)  
- Position 2: U (x) – so U is not in the word.  
- Position 3: T (-) – so T is not in position 3 (but position 3 is O, so this is fine).  
- Position 4: O (-) – so O is not in position 4 (already known).  
- Position 5: R (-) – so R is not in position 5 (already known).  

Therefore, the word is:  
T _ O R _  
with T in position 1, O in 3, R in 4, and T must appear somewhere else (positions 2 or 5).  
But position 2 cannot be T (because the second T in TUTOR was in position 2 and got (-)).  
Therefore T must be in position 5.  

Thus the word must be T _ O R T, which is ""TOROT"" – but that is invalid.  

Wait, let me think differently: maybe the word is T _ O R _ and we have T in position 1, O in 3, R in 4, and no second T.  
But the feedback for TUTOR's second T was (-), meaning T is not in position 3 (which is already satisfied), but does not necessarily mean T is only in position 1.  

So perhaps the word is simply T _ O R _ with T in position 1, O in 3, R in 4, and position 2 and 5 filled with other letters.  

Let me list possible letters for position 2 and 5:  
Excluded letters so far: A, S, E, U.  
R is already in 4.  
T is in 1.  
O is in 3.  

Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

Looking for common words:  
- T B O R N – ""TBORN"" – no.  
- T C O R N – ""TCORN"" – no.  
- T I O R N – ""TIORN"" – no.  
- T H O R N – ""THORN"" – yes!  

Let's check ""THORN"":  
T(✓) H O R N  
- T is in position 1 (matches).  
- H is new.  
- O is in position 3 (matches).  
- R is in position 4 (matches).  
- N is new.  

No conflicts with previous feedback.  

Thus, the next guess should be ""THORN"".

From the latest feedback (THORN → T✓ H✓ O✓ R✓ N×) we now have:

- Position 1: T (✓) – locked in.
- Position 2: H (✓) – locked in.
- Position 3: O (✓) – locked in.
- Position 4: R (✓) – locked in.
- Position 5: N (×) – N is NOT in the word.

So the word pattern is exactly T H O R _, and we just need to find the last letter.

Letters already used and confirmed: T, H, O, R.  
Letters known to be absent: A, S, E, U, N.

We need a 5-letter English word that starts with “THOR” and ends with a letter that hasn’t been eliminated.

Possible endings (common letters not yet ruled out):  
I, K, L, M, P, Y, etc.

Quick scan of valid words:
- THORI – not common.
- THORK – not a standard word.
- THORL – archaic, unlikely.
- THORM – not standard.
- THORP – not standard.
- THORV – no.
- THORY – no.

The only standard English word that fits is “THORP” (a surname or small town name), but it’s obscure.  
However, “THORP” is listed in some dictionaries.

Alternatively, re-checking: is there another letter?  
Wait, let’s think of “THORN” was rejected at position 5 with N×, but what about “THORP”?  
Actually, “THORP” is valid.

But let me double-check: is there any other common word?  
“THORP” seems to be the only one left.

Therefore, the correct word must be THORP.

From the feedback on THORP we now know:

Valid English words starting with “THOR”:

- THORL – archaic
- THORM – not standard
- THORV – no
- THORY – no
- THOR* – only remaining plausible is “THORI” (but that’s a prefix, not a word) and “THORP” (already tried).

Wait—there’s another: “THOR” + “K” makes “THORK” (not standard), but “THOR” + “Y” makes “THOR Y” which is not a word.

Actually, the only standard English word that fits is “THORI” (a type of mineral), but that’s obscure.

However, let’s re-check standard dictionaries: the word “THORI” is listed as a variant spelling of “thorium” (a radioactive element), but it’s not common.

But the game accepts any valid English word, and “THORI” is valid.

But let me think again—what about “THOR” + “K”? “THORK” is not in standard dictionaries.

Another check: “THOR” + “K” – no.

Another check: “THOR” + “Y” – no.

Another check: “THOR” + “L” – “THORL” is archaic for “thorl of a horse,” but it’s listed.

But the most common and likely intended word is “THORI.”

However, let me double-check: is there any other? “THOR” + “K” – no.

Thus, the only remaining valid word is “THORI.”

But to be safe, let me check if “THORI” is accepted. Yes, it is.

Therefore, the correct word must be THORI.
