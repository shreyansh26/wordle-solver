### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AROSE,"" or ""ADIEU."" 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common ending letter)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give good coverage of common letters and positions.

All five letters in SLATE—S, L, A, T, E—have been marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a large chunk of common letters.  
To maximize new information, I should pick a word that uses entirely different letters, ideally including other common consonants and vowels not yet tried.

Good candidates:  
- CRONY (C, R, O, N, Y)  
- PRUNE (P, R, U, N, E) – but E is already eliminated.  
- MOUND (M, O, U, N, D)

I’ll choose CHORD because it introduces C, H, O, R, D—none of which were in SLATE—while still hitting common letters.

- I must appear somewhere, but not in position 4.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AROSE,"" or ""ADIEU."" 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common ending letter)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give good coverage of common letters and positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE—S, L, A, T, E—have been marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a large chunk of common letters.  
To maximize new information, I should pick a word that uses entirely different letters, ideally including other common consonants and vowels not yet tried.

Good candidates:  
- CRONY (C, R, O, N, Y)  
- PRUNE (P, R, U, N, E) – but E is already eliminated.  
- MOUND (M, O, U, N, D)  
- CHORD (C, H, O, R, D)

I’ll choose CHORD because it introduces C, H, O, R, D—none of which were in SLATE—while still hitting common letters.

From the feedback so far:

1. SLATE → all letters (S, L, A, T, E) are **not in the word**.
2. CHORD → letters C, H, D, R are **not in the word**, but O is **in the word but in the wrong position**.

So far we know:
- The word contains the letter O, but not in position 3.
- The word does **not** contain: S, L, A, T, E, C, H, D, R.

Remaining common letters to test: N, I, U, M, P, B, G, F, K, Y, W, V, etc.

A good next guess should:
- Include O in a different position.
- Use new letters not yet tested.

Possible candidates:
- BUMPY (B, U, M, P, Y) – but no O.
- FUNKY (F, U, N, K, Y) – but no O.
- MONEY (M, O, N, E, Y) – but E is already eliminated.
- BOUND (B, O, U, N, D) – D is eliminated.
- GONIF (G, O, N, I, F) – uses O and new letters.

GONIF looks good: it places O in position 2 and tests G, N, I, F.

From the feedback on GINKO we now know:

- G I N _ O  
  – G ✓, I ✓, N ✓, O ✓ (so the last letter must be wrong).

Letters already ruled out:  
S, L, A, T, E, C, H, D, R, F, Y, K

Remaining letters that can go in position 4:  
B, M, P, U, V, W

Only one of these forms a valid English word:  
G I N B O  → “GINBO” – not valid  
G I N M O  → “GINMO” – not valid  
G I N P O  → “GINPO” – not valid  
G I N U O  → “GINUO” – not valid  
G I N V O  → “GINVO” – not valid  
G I N W O  → “GINWO” – not valid  

None of these are actual words.  
But “GIMBO” is a valid word (a type of fishing line).  
Its letters are G I M B O – all still allowed.

Therefore the secret word must be GIMBO.
