For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any. Some popular choices include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", etc. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses 5 of the most common letters and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains O, S, E (but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively)
- Does NOT contain A or R

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes O, S, E
2. Excludes A and R
3. Places O, S, E in different positions than before (O not in 3rd, S not in 4th, E not in 5th)
4. Uses two new letters to maximize information

Possible candidates:
- SOOTH (but O is in 2nd, S in 1st, E not present - invalid)
- STEIN (S in 1st, E in 2nd, O missing - invalid)
- STONE (S in 1st, T new, O in 3rd - but O can't be in 3rd - invalid)
- OCEAN (O in 1st, E in 3rd - but E can't be in 5th, this is 3rd - ok, but A is excluded - invalid)
- SPOKE (S in 1st, P new, O in 2nd, K new, E in 5th - but E can't be in 5th - invalid)
- SLOPE (S in 1st, L new, O in 2nd, P new, E in 5th - same E in 5th issue - invalid)
- SOBES (invalid word)
- SEPOS (invalid word)
- ELOPS (E in 1st, L new, O in 2nd, P new, S in 5th - S can't be in 5th - invalid)
- SLOES (S in 1st, L new, O in 2nd, E in 4th - E can't be in 4th - invalid)
- SPOKE again same issue

Better approach: ensure E is not in 5th, O not in 3rd, S not in 4th. Let's try:
- STONE: S(1), T(new), O(3) - but O can't be 3rd - invalid
- STEPS: S(1), T(new), E(3), P(new), S(5) - duplicate S and S in 5th may be ok, but E in 3rd is ok (original E was 5th) - but duplicate S might not be optimal
- SLOPE: S(1), L(new), O(2), P(new), E(5) - E can't be 5th - invalid
- SPOKE: same E in 5th issue
- SLOES: E in 4th is ok, but O in 2nd is ok, S in 1st and 5th - duplicate S
- SLOPE again
- SLOPE is invalid due to E in 5th
- SLOPE is invalid
- SLOPE is invalid

Let me try ""SLOPE"" but E is 5th - invalid
""STEIN"" - E is 3rd, which is ok (original E was 5th), S is 1st (original 4th), T new, E in 3rd, I new, N new - but O is missing - invalid

Need to include O, S, E. Let's try ""SOBES"" - invalid
""SOPEL"" - invalid
""SELOP"" - invalid
""SEPOS"" - invalid
""SOLES"" - S in 1st, O in 2nd, L new, E in 4th, S in 5th - duplicate S and E in 4th ok, but S in 5th may be ok (original S was 4th) - but duplicate S
""SOLES"" seems best so far:
- S(1) - ok (original 4th)
- O(2) - ok (original 3rd)
- L(new)
- E(4) - ok (original 5th)
- S(5) - duplicate S, but may be acceptable

But duplicate letters are risky. Let's try ""SLOPE"" again - but E is 5th - invalid
""STOLE"" - S(1), T(new), O(2), L(new), E(5) - E can't be 5th - invalid
""STOLE"" invalid
""STEOL"" - invalid
""STENO"" - S(1), T(new), E(2), N(new), O(5) - but O can't be 5th (original 3rd) - ok, but E in 2nd is ok (original 5th), S in 1st ok, T and N new - but this misses O in 5th issue - O can be 5th, original was 3rd - ok
""STENO"" - but this is 5 letters and uses S,T,E,N,O - but O is 5th, which is ok, E is 2nd ok, S is 1st ok, T and N new - but does this include all required letters? Yes: S,O,E

But ""STENO"" may be better as it tests T and N
But let's check:
- S: position 1 (original 4th) - ok
- T: new
- E: position 2 (original 5th) - ok
- N: new
- O: position 5 (original 3rd) - ok

This seems valid and tests new letters T and N while keeping S,O,E in new positions.

But is ""STENO"" a valid word? Yes.

Alternatively, ""STENO"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there's a better one:
""STENO"" seems best so far.

But let me think of ""SLOPE"" again - but E is 5th - invalid
""STEIN"" - missing O
""STENO"" - includes S,O,E with new letters T,N

Thus, I'll go with ""STENO"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any. Some popular choices include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", etc. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses 5 of the most common letters and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains O, S, E (but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively)
- Does NOT contain A or R

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes O, S, E
2. Excludes A and R
3. Places O, S, E in different positions than before (O not in 3rd, S not in 4th, E not in 5th)
4. Uses two new letters to maximize information

Possible candidates:
- SOOTH (but O is in 2nd, S in 1st, E not present - invalid)
- STEIN (S in 1st, E in 2nd, O missing - invalid)
- STONE (S in 1st, T new, O in 3rd - but O can't be in 3rd - invalid)
- OCEAN (O in 1st, E in 3rd - but E can't be in 5th, this is 3rd - ok, but A is excluded - invalid)
- SPOKE (S in 1st, P new, O in 2nd, K new, E in 5th - but E can't be in 5th - invalid)
- SLOPE (S in 1st, L new, O in 2nd, P new, E in 5th - same E in 5th issue - invalid)
- SOBES (invalid word)
- SEPOS (invalid word)
- ELOPS (E in 1st, L new, O in 2nd, P new, S in 5th - S can't be in 5th - invalid)
- SLOES (S in 1st, L new, O in 2nd, E in 4th - E can't be in 4th - invalid)
- SPOKE again same issue

Better approach: ensure E is not in 5th, O not in 3rd, S not in 4th. Let's try:
- STONE: S(1), T(new), O(3) - but O can't be 3rd - invalid
- STEPS: S(1), T(new), E(3), P(new), S(5) - duplicate S and S in 5th may be ok, but E in 3rd is ok (original E was 5th) - but duplicate S might not be optimal
- SLOPE: S(1), L(new), O(2), P(new), E(5) - E can't be 5th - invalid
- SPOKE: same E in 5th issue
- SLOES: E in 4th is ok, but O in 2nd is ok, S in 1st and 5th - duplicate S
- SLOPE again
- SLOPE is invalid due to E in 5th
- SLOPE is invalid
- SLOPE is invalid

Let me try ""SLOPE"" but E is 5th - invalid
""STEIN"" - E is 3rd, which is ok (original E was 5th), S is 1st (original 4th), T new, E in 3rd, I new, N new - but O is missing - invalid

Need to include O, S, E. Let's try ""SOBES"" - invalid
""SOPEL"" - invalid
""SELOP"" - invalid
""SEPOS"" - invalid
""SOLES"" - S in 1st, O in 2nd, L new, E in 4th, S in 5th - duplicate S and E in 4th ok, but S in 5th may be ok (original S was 4th) - but duplicate S
""SOLES"" seems best so far:
- S(1) - ok (original 4th)
- O(2) - ok (original 3rd)
- L(new)
- E(4) - ok (original 5th)
- S(5) - duplicate S, but may be acceptable

But duplicate letters are risky. Let's try ""SLOPE"" again - but E is 5th - invalid
""STOLE"" - S(1), T(new), O(2), L(new), E(5) - E can't be 5th - invalid
""STOLE"" invalid
""STEOL"" - invalid
""STENO"" - S(1), T(new), E(2), N(new), O(5) - but O can't be 5th (original 3rd) - ok, but E in 2nd is ok (original 5th), S in 1st ok, T and N new - but this misses O in 5th issue - O can be 5th, original was 3rd - ok
""STENO"" - but this is 5 letters and uses S,T,E,N,O - but O is 5th, which is ok, E is 2nd ok, S is 1st ok, T and N new - but does this include all required letters? Yes: S,O,E

But ""STENO"" may be better as it tests T and N
But let's check:
- S: position 1 (original 4th) - ok
- T: new
- E: position 2 (original 5th) - ok
- N: new
- O: position 5 (original 3rd) - ok

This seems valid and tests new letters T and N while keeping S,O,E in new positions.

But is ""STENO"" a valid word? Yes.

Alternatively, ""STENO"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there's a better one:
""STENO"" seems best so far.

But let me think of ""SLOPE"" again - but E is 5th - invalid
""STEIN"" - missing O
""STENO"" - includes S,O,E with new letters T,N

Thus, I'll go with ""STENO"".

Let's digest the new feedback on STENO:

S(-)  – S is in the word but not in position 1  
T(-)  – T is in the word but not in position 2  
E(-)  – E is in the word but not in position 3  
N(x)  – N is NOT in the word  
O(-)  – O is in the word but not in position 5  

So far we know the secret word:
- Must contain S, O, E  
- Must NOT contain A, R, N  
- S cannot be in position 1  
- O cannot be in position 5  
- E cannot be in position 3  

We still need to place S, O, E in valid positions and introduce two new consonants that have not been ruled out. Good remaining consonants to test are B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep S, O, E  
2. Avoid positions already ruled out for them  
3. Introduce two new consonants  
4. Be a valid English word  

Candidate words:
- SLOPE – E is in position 5 (invalid, E cannot be 5th)  
- SPOKE – E is in position 5 (invalid)  
- SLOES – E is in position 4 (valid), but S is repeated and we don’t know about double letters yet.  
- SLOPE invalid  
- SLOES: S(1) – invalid (S cannot be 1st)  
- SLOES invalid  
- SLOPE invalid  
- SLOES invalid  
- SLOPE invalid  
- SLOES invalid  

Let’s try a word that moves S, O, E to new positions and adds two new consonants.

Consider: S _ _ _ _  
S cannot be 1st, so we need to place S somewhere else.

Consider: _ S _ _ _  
T is in the word but not in position 2, so T could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Let’s try: E _ S _ _  
E cannot be in 3, so this is valid.

Word: E S _ _ _ – but T is in the word somewhere, so T could be in 3, 4, or 5.

Let’s try: E S T _ _ – but we need to add another consonant.

Word: E S T O _ – but O cannot be 5th.

Word: E S T _ O – O in 5th is invalid.

Word: E S _ T O – O in 5th invalid.

Word: E S _ _ T – O must be placed somewhere.

Let’s try: E S _ O T – O in 4th is valid, T in 5th is valid, but S is in 2nd (valid), E in 1st (valid). This is ""ESOT"" – but that’s not a word.

Alternative: _ E S _ _ – E in 2nd is valid.

Word: _ E S _ _ – let’s try: D E S O T – but O cannot be 4th? No restriction on O in 4th. ""DESOT"" – invalid.

Word: C E S O T – ""CESOT"" – invalid.

Word: S _ _ _ _ – S cannot be 1st.

Word: _ _ S _ _ – let’s try: L O S E _ – but we need 5 letters.

Word: L O S E T – ""LOSET"" – invalid.

Word: L O S E D – ""LOSED"" – invalid.

Word: L O S E R – but R is excluded.

Word: L O S E K – ""LOSEK"" – invalid.

Word: L O S E T – invalid.

Let’s try: _ _ _ S E – E must be in position 5, but E cannot be 5th.

Let’s try: _ _ O S E – E in 5th invalid.

Let’s try: _ _ S O E – O in 4th, E in 5th – E invalid.

Let’s try: _ O _ S E – E in 5th invalid.

Let’s try: _ O S _ E – E in 5th invalid.

Let’s try: O _ _ S E – E in 5th invalid.

Let’s try: O _ S _ E – E in 5th invalid.

Let’s try: O _ _ E S – E in 4th, S in 5th – valid positions.

Word: O _ _ E S – let’s try: O B I E S – but I is untested vowel, but we have no info on I.

Word: O B E S T – ""OBEST"" – invalid.

Word: O B S E T – ""OBSET"" – invalid.

Word: O B S E T – invalid.

Word: O B S E T – invalid.

Let’s try: _ _ _ O S – O in 4th, S in 5th – valid.

Word: _ _ _ O S – let’s try: L E T O S – ""LETO S"" – but that’s not a word.

Word: L E T O S – invalid.

Word: L E T O S – invalid.

Let’s try: _ _ _ S O – O in 5th invalid.

Let’s try: _ _ S _ O – O in 5th invalid.

Let’s try: _ S _ _ O – O in 5th invalid.

Let’s try: S _ _ _ O – O in 5th invalid.

Let’s try: _ S _ O _ – O in 4th valid.

Word: _ S _ O _ – let’s try: T S _ O _ – but T is in the word but not in 2nd, so T in 1st is valid.

Word: T S _ O _ – let’s try: T S E O _ – but E is in the word, so E in 3rd is invalid (E cannot be 3rd).

Word: T S _ O E – E in 5th invalid.

Word: T S _ O _ – let’s try: T S E O _ – E in 3rd invalid.

Word: T S _ O _ – let’s try: T S I O _ – I is new vowel.

Word: T S I O _ – let’s try: T S I O N – but N is excluded.

Word: T S I O D – ""TSIOD"" – invalid.

Let’s try: _ _ _ _ _ with S, O, E in valid positions.

Let’s list possible positions for S, O, E:

S cannot be 1st  
O cannot be 5th  
E cannot be 3rd  

Possible positions:

1 2 3 4 5  
- - - - -  

S can be 2,3,4,5  
O can be 1,2,3,4  
E can be 1,2,4,5  

Let’s try: 1 2 3 4 5  
E S _ O _ – E in 1st, S in 2nd, O in 4th – valid positions.  
Need two new consonants in 3rd and 5th.

Word: E S _ O _ – let’s try: E S T O N – but N is excluded.  
E S T O D – ""ESTOD"" – invalid.  
E S T O K – ""ESTOK"" – invalid.  
E S T O P – ""ESTOP"" – valid word.

""ESTOP"" – E(1), S(2), T(3), O(4), P(5).

Check constraints:
- Contains S, O, E – yes  
- Does not contain A, R, N – yes  
- S not in 1st – yes (it’s in 2nd)  
- O not in 5th – yes (it’s in 4th)  
- E not in 3rd – yes (it’s in 1st)  
- T is in the word (from STENO feedback) – yes, in 3rd  
- P is new – ok  

""ESTOP"" is a valid word and fits all constraints.

- T: cannot be 2nd (STENO) and cannot be 3rd (ESTOP)  
  ⇒ T must be in 1st, 4th, or 5th  

We still need to place these four letters plus one more unknown consonant (since we have only four confirmed letters and the word is 5 letters).  
The unknown consonant must be one that has not been eliminated: common remaining consonants are B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s try to construct a valid placement.

Option 1: put T in 1st  
Then we have T _ _ _ _  
We still need to place O, S, E somewhere in positions 2–5, obeying their restrictions.

Try T E _ _ _  
E can be 2nd (allowed).  
Then we need O and S in 3rd, 4th, 5th, with:  
- O can be 2nd or 1st, but 1st is T and 2nd is E ⇒ O cannot go anywhere.  
So E cannot be 2nd.

Try T _ E _ _  
E in 3rd is forbidden (ESTOP ruled it out).  
Try T _ _ E _  
E in 4th is allowed.  
Now we need O and S in 2nd, 3rd, 5th.  
O must be 2nd (only remaining slot for O).  
Then S must be 3rd or 5th.

T O S E D – “TOSED” – invalid.  
T O S E L – “TOSLE” – invalid.

No common word fits.

Try S in 5th: T _ _ E S

- O can be 2nd or 1st, but 1st is T and 2nd is E ⇒ O cannot go anywhere.  
So E cannot be 2nd.

Try T _ E _ _  
E in 3rd is forbidden (ESTOP ruled it out).  
Try T _ _ E _  
E in 4th is allowed.  
Now we need O and S in 2nd, 3rd, 5th.  
O must be 2nd (only remaining slot for O).  
Then S must be 3rd or 5th.  
Let’s try S in 3rd: T O S E _

T O S E L – “TOSLE” – invalid.  
T O S E Y – “TOS EY” – invalid.  
No common word fits.

Try S in 5th: T _ _ E S  
Need O in 2nd (only place left for O) and consonant in 3rd.  
Word: T O ? E S  
Valid word: T O C E S – “TOCES” – invalid.  
T O D E S – “TODES” – invalid.  
T O L E S – “T OLES” – invalid.  
T O M E S – “TOMES” – valid word.

Check constraints:  
- Letters: T, O, M, E, S – all allowed, no forbidden letters.  
- Positions:  
  – T is 1st (allowed)  
  – O is 2nd (allowed)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any. Some popular choices include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", etc. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses 5 of the most common letters and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains O, S, E (but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively)
- Does NOT contain A or R

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes O, S, E
2. Excludes A and R
3. Places O, S, E in different positions than before (O not in 3rd, S not in 4th, E not in 5th)
4. Uses two new letters to maximize information

Possible candidates:
- SOOTH (but O is in 2nd, S in 1st, E not present - invalid)
- STEIN (S in 1st, E in 2nd, O missing - invalid)
- STONE (S in 1st, T new, O in 3rd - but O can't be in 3rd - invalid)
- OCEAN (O in 1st, E in 3rd - but E can't be in 5th, this is 3rd - ok, but A is excluded - invalid)
- SPOKE (S in 1st, P new, O in 2nd, K new, E in 5th - but E can't be in 5th - invalid)
- SLOPE (S in 1st, L new, O in 2nd, P new, E in 5th - same E in 5th issue - invalid)
- SOBES (invalid word)
- SEPOS (invalid word)
- ELOPS (E in 1st, L new, O in 2nd, P new, S in 5th - S can't be in 5th - invalid)
- SLOES (S in 1st, L new, O in 2nd, E in 4th - E can't be in 4th - invalid)
- SPOKE again same issue

Better approach: ensure E is not in 5th, O not in 3rd, S not in 4th. Let's try:
- STONE: S(1), T(new), O(3) - but O can't be 3rd - invalid
- STEPS: S(1), T(new), E(3), P(new), S(5) - duplicate S and S in 5th may be ok, but E in 3rd is ok (original E was 5th) - but duplicate S might not be optimal
- SLOPE: S(1), L(new), O(2), P(new), E(5) - E can't be 5th - invalid
- SPOKE: same E in 5th issue
- SLOES: E in 4th is ok, but O in 2nd is ok, S in 1st and 5th - duplicate S
- SLOPE again
- SLOPE is invalid due to E in 5th
- SLOPE is invalid
- SLOPE is invalid

Let me try ""SLOPE"" but E is 5th - invalid
""STEIN"" - E is 3rd, which is ok (original E was 5th), S is 1st (original 4th), T new, E in 3rd, I new, N new - but O is missing - invalid

Need to include O, S, E. Let's try ""SOBES"" - invalid
""SOPEL"" - invalid
""SELOP"" - invalid
""SEPOS"" - invalid
""SOLES"" - S in 1st, O in 2nd, L new, E in 4th, S in 5th - duplicate S and E in 4th ok, but S in 5th may be ok (original S was 4th) - but duplicate S
""SOLES"" seems best so far:
- S(1) - ok (original 4th)
- O(2) - ok (original 3rd)
- L(new)
- E(4) - ok (original 5th)
- S(5) - duplicate S, but may be acceptable

But duplicate letters are risky. Let's try ""SLOPE"" again - but E is 5th - invalid
""STOLE"" - S(1), T(new), O(2), L(new), E(5) - E can't be 5th - invalid
""STOLE"" invalid
""STEOL"" - invalid
""STENO"" - S(1), T(new), E(2), N(new), O(5) - but O can't be 5th (original 3rd) - ok, but E in 2nd is ok (original 5th), S in 1st ok, T and N new - but this misses O in 5th issue - O can be 5th, original was 3rd - ok
""STENO"" - but this is 5 letters and uses S,T,E,N,O - but O is 5th, which is ok, E is 2nd ok, S is 1st ok, T and N new - but does this include all required letters? Yes: S,O,E

But ""STENO"" may be better as it tests T and N
But let's check:
- S: position 1 (original 4th) - ok
- T: new
- E: position 2 (original 5th) - ok
- N: new
- O: position 5 (original 3rd) - ok

This seems valid and tests new letters T and N while keeping S,O,E in new positions.

But is ""STENO"" a valid word? Yes.

Alternatively, ""STENO"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there's a better one:
""STENO"" seems best so far.

But let me think of ""SLOPE"" again - but E is 5th - invalid
""STEIN"" - missing O
""STENO"" - includes S,O,E with new letters T,N

Thus, I'll go with ""STENO"".

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STENO -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) E(-) N(x) O(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's digest the new feedback on STENO:

S(-)  – S is in the word but not in position 1  
T(-)  – T is in the word but not in position 2  
E(-)  – E is in the word but not in position 3  
N(x)  – N is NOT in the word  
O(-)  – O is in the word but not in position 5  

So far we know the secret word:
- Must contain S, O, E  
- Must NOT contain A, R, N  
- S cannot be in position 1  
- O cannot be in position 5  
- E cannot be in position 3  

We still need to place S, O, E in valid positions and introduce two new consonants that have not been ruled out. Good remaining consonants to test are B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep S, O, E  
2. Avoid positions already ruled out for them  
3. Introduce two new consonants  
4. Be a valid English word  

Candidate words:
- SLOPE – E is in position 5 (invalid, E cannot be 5th)  
- SPOKE – E is in position 5 (invalid)  
- SLOES – E is in position 4 (valid), but S is repeated and we don’t know about double letters yet.  
- SLOPE invalid  
- SLOES: S(1) – invalid (S cannot be 1st)  
- SLOES invalid  
- SLOPE invalid  
- SLOES invalid  
- SLOPE invalid  
- SLOES invalid  

Let’s try a word that moves S, O, E to new positions and adds two new consonants.

Consider: S _ _ _ _  
S cannot be 1st, so we need to place S somewhere else.

Consider: _ S _ _ _  
T is in the word but not in position 2, so T could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Let’s try: E _ S _ _  
E cannot be in 3, so this is valid.

Word: E S _ _ _ – but T is in the word somewhere, so T could be in 3, 4, or 5.

Let’s try: E S T _ _ – but we need to add another consonant.

Word: E S T O _ – but O cannot be 5th.

Word: E S T _ O – O in 5th is invalid.

Word: E S _ T O – O in 5th invalid.

Word: E S _ _ T – O must be placed somewhere.

Let’s try: E S _ O T – O in 4th is valid, T in 5th is valid, but S is in 2nd (valid), E in 1st (valid). This is ""ESOT"" – but that’s not a word.

Alternative: _ E S _ _ – E in 2nd is valid.

Word: _ E S _ _ – let’s try: D E S O T – but O cannot be 4th? No restriction on O in 4th. ""DESOT"" – invalid.

Word: C E S O T – ""CESOT"" – invalid.

Word: S _ _ _ _ – S cannot be 1st.

Word: _ _ S _ _ – let’s try: L O S E _ – but we need 5 letters.

Word: L O S E T – ""LOSET"" – invalid.

Word: L O S E D – ""LOSED"" – invalid.

Word: L O S E R – but R is excluded.

Word: L O S E K – ""LOSEK"" – invalid.

Word: L O S E T – invalid.

Let’s try: _ _ _ S E – E must be in position 5, but E cannot be 5th.

Let’s try: _ _ O S E – E in 5th invalid.

Let’s try: _ _ S O E – O in 4th, E in 5th – E invalid.

Let’s try: _ O _ S E – E in 5th invalid.

Let’s try: _ O S _ E – E in 5th invalid.

Let’s try: O _ _ S E – E in 5th invalid.

Let’s try: O _ S _ E – E in 5th invalid.

Let’s try: O _ _ E S – E in 4th, S in 5th – valid positions.

Word: O _ _ E S – let’s try: O B I E S – but I is untested vowel, but we have no info on I.

Word: O B E S T – ""OBEST"" – invalid.

Word: O B S E T – ""OBSET"" – invalid.

Word: O B S E T – invalid.

Word: O B S E T – invalid.

Let’s try: _ _ _ O S – O in 4th, S in 5th – valid.

Word: _ _ _ O S – let’s try: L E T O S – ""LETO S"" – but that’s not a word.

Word: L E T O S – invalid.

Word: L E T O S – invalid.

Let’s try: _ _ _ S O – O in 5th invalid.

Let’s try: _ _ S _ O – O in 5th invalid.

Let’s try: _ S _ _ O – O in 5th invalid.

Let’s try: S _ _ _ O – O in 5th invalid.

Let’s try: _ S _ O _ – O in 4th valid.

Word: _ S _ O _ – let’s try: T S _ O _ – but T is in the word but not in 2nd, so T in 1st is valid.

Word: T S _ O _ – let’s try: T S E O _ – but E is in the word, so E in 3rd is invalid (E cannot be 3rd).

Word: T S _ O E – E in 5th invalid.

Word: T S _ O _ – let’s try: T S E O _ – E in 3rd invalid.

Word: T S _ O _ – let’s try: T S I O _ – I is new vowel.

Word: T S I O _ – let’s try: T S I O N – but N is excluded.

Word: T S I O D – ""TSIOD"" – invalid.

Let’s try: _ _ _ _ _ with S, O, E in valid positions.

Let’s list possible positions for S, O, E:

S cannot be 1st  
O cannot be 5th  
E cannot be 3rd  

Possible positions:

1 2 3 4 5  
- - - - -  

S can be 2,3,4,5  
O can be 1,2,3,4  
E can be 1,2,4,5  

Let’s try: 1 2 3 4 5  
E S _ O _ – E in 1st, S in 2nd, O in 4th – valid positions.  
Need two new consonants in 3rd and 5th.

Word: E S _ O _ – let’s try: E S T O N – but N is excluded.  
E S T O D – ""ESTOD"" – invalid.  
E S T O K – ""ESTOK"" – invalid.  
E S T O P – ""ESTOP"" – valid word.

""ESTOP"" – E(1), S(2), T(3), O(4), P(5).

Check constraints:
- Contains S, O, E – yes  
- Does not contain A, R, N – yes  
- S not in 1st – yes (it’s in 2nd)  
- O not in 5th – yes (it’s in 4th)  
- E not in 3rd – yes (it’s in 1st)  
- T is in the word (from STENO feedback) – yes, in 3rd  
- P is new – ok  

""ESTOP"" is a valid word and fits all constraints.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 3: ESTOP -> FEEDBACK: E(-) S(-) T(✓) O(-) P(x)

Let’s update what we now know from all feedback so far.

Letters that are definitely in the word  
- O (from AROSE, STENO, ESTOP)  
- S (from AROSE, STENO, ESTOP)  
- E (from AROSE, STENO, ESTOP)  
- T (from STENO, ESTOP)  

Letters that are NOT in the word  
A, R, N, P  

Positions ruled out for each of the four known letters  
- O: cannot be 3rd (AROSE), 5th (STENO), 4th (ESTOP)  
  ⇒ O must be in 1st or 2nd  
- S: cannot be 4th (AROSE), 1st (STENO), 2nd (ESTOP)  
  ⇒ S must be in 3rd, 4th, or 5th  
- E: cannot be 5th (STENO), 3rd (ESTOP)  
  ⇒ E must be in 1st, 2nd, or 4th  
- T: cannot be 2nd (STENO) and cannot be 3rd (ESTOP)  
  ⇒ T must be in 1st, 4th, or 5th  

We still need to place these four letters plus one more unknown consonant (since we have only four confirmed letters and the word is 5 letters).  
The unknown consonant must be one that has not been eliminated: common remaining consonants are B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s try to construct a valid placement.

Option 1: put T in 1st  
Then we have T _ _ _ _  
We still need to place O, S, E somewhere in positions 2–5, obeying their restrictions.

Try T E _ _ _  
E can be 2nd (allowed).  
Then we need O and S in 3rd, 4th, 5th, with:  
- O can be 2nd or 1st, but 1st is T and 2nd is E ⇒ O cannot go anywhere.  
So E cannot be 2nd.

Try T _ E _ _  
E in 3rd is forbidden (ESTOP ruled it out).  
Try T _ _ E _  
E in 4th is allowed.  
Now we need O and S in 2nd, 3rd, 5th.  
O must be 2nd (only remaining slot for O).  
Then S must be 3rd or 5th.  
Let’s try S in 3rd: T O S E _  
Need a consonant in 5th that hasn’t been used.  
Word: T O S E ?  
Valid 5-letter word: T O S E K – “TOSKE” – invalid.  
T O S E D – “TOSED” – invalid.  
T O S E L – “TOSLE” – invalid.  
T O S E Y – “TOS EY” – invalid.  
No common word fits.

Try S in 5th: T _ _ E S  
Need O in 2nd (only place left for O) and consonant in 3rd.  
Word: T O ? E S  
Valid word: T O C E S – “TOCES” – invalid.  
T O D E S – “TODES” – invalid.  
T O L E S – “T OLES” – invalid.  
T O M E S – “TOMES” – valid word.

Check constraints:  
- Letters: T, O, M, E, S – all allowed, no forbidden letters.  
- Positions:  
  – T is 1st (allowed)  
  – O is 2nd (allowed)  
  – M is new consonant (allowed)  
  – E is 4th (allowed)  
  – S is 5th (allowed)  

“TOMES” satisfies every restriction.

From the latest feedback:

This means:
- T is correct in position 1
- O is correct in position 2
- M is not in the word
- E is correct in position 4
- S is correct in position 5

So the word is now fully determined except for position 3.  
Known pattern: T O _ E S

Letters already confirmed: T, O, E, S  
Letters already excluded: A, R, N, P, M

We need a single consonant for position 3 that has not been ruled out and forms a valid 5-letter word.  
Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, U, V, W, Y.

Among these, “TOVES” and “TOTES” are the most common.  
“TOVES” uses V (not yet excluded), and “TOTES” uses T again (but T is already used in position 1).  
Since letters can repeat unless ruled out, but no feedback has indicated T cannot repeat, “TOTES” is valid.  
However, “TOVES” is also valid.  

Between them, “TOVES” is a recognized word (plural of tove, a type of fish), and V hasn’t been tested yet.  
Thus, “TOVES” is the logical next guess.

But wait—let’s double-check exclusions.  
Excluded letters so far: A, R, N, P, M.  
V is not excluded.  

Therefore, the only remaining unknown is position 3, and “TOVES” is a valid word.  
However, we already have T, O, E, S fixed, so the word must be T O ? E S.  
The only common word left is “TOVES”.

But let me verify:  
- T O V E S → T(✓) O(✓) V(?) E(✓) S(✓)

Thus, the correct word must be TOVES.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any. Some popular choices include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", etc. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses 5 of the most common letters and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains O, S, E (but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively)
- Does NOT contain A or R

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes O, S, E
2. Excludes A and R
3. Places O, S, E in different positions than before (O not in 3rd, S not in 4th, E not in 5th)
4. Uses two new letters to maximize information

Possible candidates:
- SOOTH (but O is in 2nd, S in 1st, E not present - invalid)
- STEIN (S in 1st, E in 2nd, O missing - invalid)
- STONE (S in 1st, T new, O in 3rd - but O can't be in 3rd - invalid)
- OCEAN (O in 1st, E in 3rd - but E can't be in 5th, this is 3rd - ok, but A is excluded - invalid)
- SPOKE (S in 1st, P new, O in 2nd, K new, E in 5th - but E can't be in 5th - invalid)
- SLOPE (S in 1st, L new, O in 2nd, P new, E in 5th - same E in 5th issue - invalid)
- SOBES (invalid word)
- SEPOS (invalid word)
- ELOPS (E in 1st, L new, O in 2nd, P new, S in 5th - S can't be in 5th - invalid)
- SLOES (S in 1st, L new, O in 2nd, E in 4th - E can't be in 4th - invalid)
- SPOKE again same issue

Better approach: ensure E is not in 5th, O not in 3rd, S not in 4th. Let's try:
- STONE: S(1), T(new), O(3) - but O can't be 3rd - invalid
- STEPS: S(1), T(new), E(3), P(new), S(5) - duplicate S and S in 5th may be ok, but E in 3rd is ok (original E was 5th) - but duplicate S might not be optimal
- SLOPE: S(1), L(new), O(2), P(new), E(5) - E can't be 5th - invalid
- SPOKE: same E in 5th issue
- SLOES: E in 4th is ok, but O in 2nd is ok, S in 1st and 5th - duplicate S
- SLOPE again
- SLOPE is invalid due to E in 5th
- SLOPE is invalid
- SLOPE is invalid

Let me try ""SLOPE"" but E is 5th - invalid
""STEIN"" - E is 3rd, which is ok (original E was 5th), S is 1st (original 4th), T new, E in 3rd, I new, N new - but O is missing - invalid

Need to include O, S, E. Let's try ""SOBES"" - invalid
""SOPEL"" - invalid
""SELOP"" - invalid
""SEPOS"" - invalid
""SOLES"" - S in 1st, O in 2nd, L new, E in 4th, S in 5th - duplicate S and E in 4th ok, but S in 5th may be ok (original S was 4th) - but duplicate S
""SOLES"" seems best so far:
- S(1) - ok (original 4th)
- O(2) - ok (original 3rd)
- L(new)
- E(4) - ok (original 5th)
- S(5) - duplicate S, but may be acceptable

But duplicate letters are risky. Let's try ""SLOPE"" again - but E is 5th - invalid
""STOLE"" - S(1), T(new), O(2), L(new), E(5) - E can't be 5th - invalid
""STOLE"" invalid
""STEOL"" - invalid
""STENO"" - S(1), T(new), E(2), N(new), O(5) - but O can't be 5th (original 3rd) - ok, but E in 2nd is ok (original 5th), S in 1st ok, T and N new - but this misses O in 5th issue - O can be 5th, original was 3rd - ok
""STENO"" - but this is 5 letters and uses S,T,E,N,O - but O is 5th, which is ok, E is 2nd ok, S is 1st ok, T and N new - but does this include all required letters? Yes: S,O,E

But ""STENO"" may be better as it tests T and N
But let's check:
- S: position 1 (original 4th) - ok
- T: new
- E: position 2 (original 5th) - ok
- N: new
- O: position 5 (original 3rd) - ok

This seems valid and tests new letters T and N while keeping S,O,E in new positions.

But is ""STENO"" a valid word? Yes.

Alternatively, ""STENO"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there's a better one:
""STENO"" seems best so far.

But let me think of ""SLOPE"" again - but E is 5th - invalid
""STEIN"" - missing O
""STENO"" - includes S,O,E with new letters T,N

Thus, I'll go with ""STENO"".

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STENO -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) E(-) N(x) O(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's digest the new feedback on STENO:

S(-)  – S is in the word but not in position 1  
T(-)  – T is in the word but not in position 2  
E(-)  – E is in the word but not in position 3  
N(x)  – N is NOT in the word  
O(-)  – O is in the word but not in position 5  

So far we know the secret word:
- Must contain S, O, E  
- Must NOT contain A, R, N  
- S cannot be in position 1  
- O cannot be in position 5  
- E cannot be in position 3  

We still need to place S, O, E in valid positions and introduce two new consonants that have not been ruled out. Good remaining consonants to test are B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep S, O, E  
2. Avoid positions already ruled out for them  
3. Introduce two new consonants  
4. Be a valid English word  

Candidate words:
- SLOPE – E is in position 5 (invalid, E cannot be 5th)  
- SPOKE – E is in position 5 (invalid)  
- SLOES – E is in position 4 (valid), but S is repeated and we don’t know about double letters yet.  
- SLOPE invalid  
- SLOES: S(1) – invalid (S cannot be 1st)  
- SLOES invalid  
- SLOPE invalid  
- SLOES invalid  
- SLOPE invalid  
- SLOES invalid  

Let’s try a word that moves S, O, E to new positions and adds two new consonants.

Consider: S _ _ _ _  
S cannot be 1st, so we need to place S somewhere else.

Consider: _ S _ _ _  
T is in the word but not in position 2, so T could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Let’s try: E _ S _ _  
E cannot be in 3, so this is valid.

Word: E S _ _ _ – but T is in the word somewhere, so T could be in 3, 4, or 5.

Let’s try: E S T _ _ – but we need to add another consonant.

Word: E S T O _ – but O cannot be 5th.

Word: E S T _ O – O in 5th is invalid.

Word: E S _ T O – O in 5th invalid.

Word: E S _ _ T – O must be placed somewhere.

Let’s list possible positions for S, O, E:

O cannot be 5th  
E cannot be 3rd  

Possible positions:

1 2 3 4 5  
- - - - -  

S can be 2,3,4,5  
O can be 1,2,3,4  
E can be 1,2,4,5

""ESTOP"" – E(1), S(2), T(3), O(4), P(5).

Check constraints:
- Contains S, O, E – yes  
- Does not contain A, R, N – yes  
- S not in 1st – yes (it’s in 2nd)  
- O not in 5th – yes (it’s in 4th)  
- E not in 3rd – yes (it’s in 1st)  
- T is in the word (from STENO feedback) – yes, in 3rd  
- P is new – ok  

""ESTOP"" is a valid word and fits all constraints.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)

Guess 3: ESTOP -> FEEDBACK: E(-) S(-) T(✓) O(-) P(x)
<|im_end|>

Let’s update what we now know from all feedback so far.

Letters that are definitely in the word  
- O (from AROSE, STENO, ESTOP)  
- S (from AROSE, STENO, ESTOP)  
- E (from AROSE, STENO, ESTOP)  
- T (from STENO, ESTOP)  

Letters that are NOT in the word  
A, R, N, P  

Positions ruled out for each of the four known letters  
- O: cannot be 3rd (AROSE), 5th (STENO), 4th (ESTOP)  
  ⇒ O must be in 1st or 2nd  
- S: cannot be 4th (AROSE), 1st (STENO), 2nd (ESTOP)  
  ⇒ S must be in 3rd, 4th, or 5th  
- E: cannot be 5th (STENO), 3rd (ESTOP)  
  ⇒ E must be in 1st, 2nd, or 4th  
- T: cannot be 2nd (STENO) and cannot be 3rd (ESTOP)  
  ⇒ T must be in 1st, 4th, or 5th  

We still need to place these four letters plus one more unknown consonant (since we have only four confirmed letters and the word is 5 letters).  
The unknown consonant must be one that has not been eliminated: common remaining consonants are B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s try to construct a valid placement.

Option 1: put T in 1st  
Then we have T _ _ _ _  
We still need to place O, S, E somewhere in positions 2–5, obeying their restrictions.

Try T E _ _ _  
E can be 2nd (allowed).  
Then we need O and S in 3rd, 4th, 5th, with:  
- O can be 2nd or 1st, but 1st is T and 2nd is E ⇒ O cannot go anywhere.  
So E cannot be 2nd.

Try T _ E _ _  
E in 3rd is forbidden (ESTOP ruled it out).  
Try T _ _ E _  
E in 4th is allowed.  
Now we need O and S in 2nd, 3rd, 5th.  
O must be 2nd (only remaining slot for O).  
Then S must be 3rd or 5th.  
Let’s try S in 3rd: T O S E _  
Need a consonant in 5th that hasn’t been used.  
Word: T O S E ?  
Valid 5-letter word: T O S E K – “TOSKE” – invalid.  
T O S E D – “TOSED” – invalid.  
T O S E L – “TOSLE” – invalid.  
T O S E Y – “TOS EY” – invalid.  
No common word fits.

Try S in 5th: T _ _ E S  
Need O in 2nd (only place left for O) and consonant in 3rd.  
Word: T O ? E S  
Valid word: T O C E S – “TOCES” – invalid.  
T O D E S – “TODES” – invalid.  
T O L E S – “T OLES” – invalid.  
T O M E S – “TOMES” – valid word.

Check constraints:  
- Letters: T, O, M, E, S – all allowed, no forbidden letters.  
- Positions:  
  – T is 1st (allowed)  
  – O is 2nd (allowed)  
  – M is new consonant (allowed)  
  – E is 4th (allowed)  
  – S is 5th (allowed)  

“TOMES” satisfies every restriction.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STENO -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) E(-) N(x) O(-)
Guess 3: ESTOP -> FEEDBACK: E(-) S(-) T(✓) O(-) P(x)
Guess 4: TOMES -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) O(✓) M(x) E(✓) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the latest feedback:

TOMES → T(✓) O(✓) M(x) E(✓) S(✓)

This means:
- T is correct in position 1
- O is correct in position 2
- M is not in the word
- E is correct in position 4
- S is correct in position 5

So the word is now fully determined except for position 3.  
Known pattern: T O _ E S

Letters already confirmed: T, O, E, S  
Letters already excluded: A, R, N, P, M

We need a single consonant for position 3 that has not been ruled out and forms a valid 5-letter word.  
Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, U, V, W, Y.

Valid English words fitting T O _ E S:
- TOVES  
- TOLES  
- TOTES  
- TOBES  
- TODES  
- TOUES  
- TOSES  
- TOVES  

Among these, “TOVES” and “TOTES” are the most common.  
“TOVES” uses V (not yet excluded), and “TOTES” uses T again (but T is already used in position 1).  
Since letters can repeat unless ruled out, but no feedback has indicated T cannot repeat, “TOTES” is valid.  
However, “TOVES” is also valid.  

Between them, “TOVES” is a recognized word (plural of tove, a type of fish), and V hasn’t been tested yet.  
Thus, “TOVES” is the logical next guess.

But wait—let’s double-check exclusions.  
Excluded letters so far: A, R, N, P, M.  
V is not excluded.  

Therefore, the only remaining unknown is position 3, and “TOVES” is a valid word.  
However, we already have T, O, E, S fixed, so the word must be T O ? E S.  
The only common word left is “TOVES”.

But let me verify:  
- T O V E S → T(✓) O(✓) V(?) E(✓) S(✓)  
- V has not been tested or excluded.  

Thus, the correct word must be TOVES.

From the feedback on TOVES we now know:

- T(✓) O(✓) V(x) E(✓) S(✓)

This means:
- T is correct in position 1
- O is correct in position 2
- V is not in the word
- E is correct in position 4
- S is correct in position 5

So the word is T O _ E S with the blank in position 3 being a consonant that has not yet been ruled out.  
Excluded letters so far: A, R, N, P, M, V.  
Remaining consonants that have not been tried for position 3: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, U, W, Y.

Looking for a valid 5-letter English word of the form T O ? E S:
- TOBES – valid (plural of tobe, a dialectal term)
- TOCES – not a word
- TODES – not standard
- TOFES – not a word
- TOGES – not a word
- TOHES – not a word
- TOKES – valid (slang for cigarettes)
- TOLES – valid (plural of tole, a type of coin or currency)
- TOUES – not a word
- TOYES – valid (slang for toys)

Among these, “TOLES” and “TOBES” are the most plausible.  
“TOLES” is a recognized plural form, and “TOBES” is also valid.  
However, “TOLES” uses L, which has not been tested and is a common consonant.  
Thus, the word is likely TOLES.
