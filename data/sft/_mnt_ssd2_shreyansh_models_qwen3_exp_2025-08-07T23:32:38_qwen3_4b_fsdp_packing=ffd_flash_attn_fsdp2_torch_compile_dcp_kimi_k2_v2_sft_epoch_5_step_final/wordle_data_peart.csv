### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words often contain frequently used vowels and consonants. Common choices include words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage of the alphabet and help identify which letters are in the word.

From the new feedback on REACT:
- R is in the word but not in position 1 (already knew it wasn’t in position 2 from AROSE).
- E is in the correct position (position 2).
- A is in the correct position (position 3).
- C is NOT in the word.
- T is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: A, E, R, T.
- Letters NOT in the word: O, S, C.
- Fixed positions:
  – Position 2 = E
  – Position 3 = A
- R must be in positions 3,4,5 (but 3 is A, so 4 or 5).
- T must be in positions 1,2,3 (but 2 is E, 3 is A, so 1).

Putting it together:
- Position 1: T
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: A
- Positions 4 & 5: must include R and one more letter (since T is already used once).

Possible letters left (common ones): D, N, L, M, P, etc.

A word that fits: T E A R _ → “TEARD” is 5 letters and uses R in position 4. But “TEARD” isn’t a valid word. Next option: “TEAR” + D is invalid, but “TEAR” + another letter: “TEARS” contains S (invalid). “TEARN” is valid.

Let’s try “TEARN”:

From the new feedback on TEARN:
- T is in the word but not in position 1 (so it must be in position 5, since positions 2,3,4 are already taken by E, A, R).
- E is in position 2 (✓)
- A is in position 3 (✓)
- R is in position 4 (✓)
- N is NOT in the word.

So the word structure is now:
- Position 1: ?
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: T

The only unknown is position 1. We know it must be a letter that hasn't been eliminated yet (not O, S, C, N). Common starting letters could be D, L, M, P, etc.

Looking at the pattern _EAR T, possible words include:
- DEART (invalid)
- LEART (invalid)
- MEART (invalid)
- PEART (valid)

""PEART"" is a valid 5-letter word meaning to gild or ornament, and it fits the pattern P E A R T.
