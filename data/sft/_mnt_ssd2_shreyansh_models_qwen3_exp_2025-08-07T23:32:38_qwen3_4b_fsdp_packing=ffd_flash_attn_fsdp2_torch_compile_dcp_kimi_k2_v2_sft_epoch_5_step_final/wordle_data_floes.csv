""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because it contains:

- No repeated letters, maximizing information gain
- Good positional coverage for vowels

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - but I'll go with AROSE as it has slightly better vowel coverage.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", etc. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll choose a word that incorporates several of these. 

""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters, maximizing information gain
- Good positional coverage for vowels

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - but I'll go with AROSE as it has slightly better vowel coverage.

- E: - → is in the word but not in position 5

- The word has an O in position 3
- It contains S and E, but neither is in its current position
- It does NOT contain A or R

Next, I want to test new consonants and see where S and E can fit. A good strategy is to place the known letters in new positions and introduce common consonants. 

Common consonants not yet tested: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.
Vowels not yet tested: I, U (since O is fixed, A is out)

Let me try a word that:
- Keeps O in position 3
- Moves S to a new position (not 4)
- Moves E to a new position (not 5)
- Introduces new common consonants

A strong candidate is ""TONES"":
- T: new consonant

Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Vowels: I, U (since A and O are ruled out, and E is already placed).

We need two letters for positions 1 and 2. Let’s try common consonants that haven’t been used yet. Good candidates are L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.

Let’s try a word like ""CLOSE"":
- C: new consonant
- L: new consonant
- O: position 3 (✓)
- S: position 5 (✓)
- E: position 4 (✓)

But ""CLOSE"" has E in position 4 and S in position 5, which matches our current knowledge. However, we need to check if C and L are allowed (they haven’t been ruled out). 

Another option is ""HOUSE"":
- H: new consonant
- O: position 3 (✓)
- U: new vowel
- S: position 5 (✓)
- E: position 4 (✓)

This also fits all constraints. Between ""CLOSE"" and ""HOUSE"", ""HOUSE"" introduces U, a new vowel, which might give more information.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after the three guesses.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)
   - O is in position 3 (✓).
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.
   - A and R are not in the word.

2. TONES → T(x) O(-) N(x) E(✓) S(✓)
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (confirmed by Guess 1 it’s in position 3).
   - E is in position 4 (✓).
   - S is in position 5 (✓).
   - T and N are not in the word.

3. HOUSE → H(x) O(-) U(x) S(-) E(-)
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (again consistent with position 3).
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (consistent with Guess 1, since it’s in position 4).
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 4 (consistent with all prior feedback).
   - H and U are not in the word.

So the fixed letters are:
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: S

Letters not in the word at all: A, R, T, N, H, U.

We need to fill positions 1 and 2 with letters not yet ruled out. Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y. Remaining vowels: I (since A, U are out and O, E are placed).

We need two letters for positions 1 and 2. Let’s look for common 5-letter words ending in “OES” (positions 3-5: O-E-S). 

Possible endings: …OES.

Common words ending in “OES”:
- FOOES (not valid)
- GHOES (not valid)
- MOLES (but L is allowed)
- POESE (not valid)
- VOLES (but V is allowed)
- WOES (too short)
- BOES (not valid)
- COES (not valid)
- DOES (D and O are allowed, but O is already in position 3)
- LOES (not valid)
- POES (not valid)
- SOES (S is already in position 5)
- GOES (G is allowed, E is in position 4, but we need to check if G and E can be in positions 1 and 2)

Wait, we need to think differently: positions 1 and 2 can be any letters except the ruled-out ones. We need a valid 5-letter word with pattern: _ _ O E S.

Looking up valid English words with pattern _ _ O E S:
- DOES (D and E, but E is already in position 4, so E can’t be in position 2)
- GOES (G and E, same issue)
- MOES (M and E, same)
- POES (P and E, same)
- VOES (V and E, same)
- FOES (F and E, same)

Hmm, none of these fit because E is already in position 4. So we need a word where positions 1 and 2 are different letters, and E is in position 4.

Let me think of other possibilities. Maybe the word is “COVES”:
- C: allowed
- O: position 3 (✓)
- V: allowed
- E: position 4 (✓)
- S: position 5 (✓)

But does this fit all constraints? Let me check:
- C and V have not been ruled out.
- Pattern: C V O E S.

Another option: “LOVES”:
- L: allowed
- O: position 3 (✓)
- V: allowed
- E: position 4 (✓)
- S: position 5 (✓)

This seems valid. Let me verify:
- L and V are not in the ruled-out list.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", etc. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll choose a word that incorporates several of these. 

""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters, maximizing information gain
- Good positional coverage for vowels

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - but I'll go with AROSE as it has slightly better vowel coverage.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: x → not in the word at all
- R: x → not in the word at all
- O: ✓ → is in the word and is in position 3
- S: - → is in the word but not in position 4
- E: - → is in the word but not in position 5

So far we know:
- The word has an O in position 3
- It contains S and E, but neither is in its current position
- It does NOT contain A or R

Next, I want to test new consonants and see where S and E can fit. A good strategy is to place the known letters in new positions and introduce common consonants. 

Common consonants not yet tested: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.
Vowels not yet tested: I, U (since O is fixed, A is out)

Let me try a word that:
- Keeps O in position 3
- Moves S to a new position (not 4)
- Moves E to a new position (not 5)
- Introduces new common consonants

A strong candidate is ""TONES"":
- T: new consonant
- O: stays in position 3
- N: new consonant
- E: moves to position 4 (was 5)
- S: moves to position 5 (was 4)

This tests T and N, keeps O, and repositions S and E.

Let’s update the knowledge after the fourth guess.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)
   - O is in position 3.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.
   - A and R are not in the word.

2. TONES → T(x) O(-) N(x) E(✓) S(✓)
   - E is in position 4.
   - S is in position 5.
   - T and N are not in the word.

3. HOUSE → H(x) O(-) U(x) S(-) E(-)
   - H and U are not in the word.

4. LOVES → L(-) O(-) V(x) E(✓) S(✓)
   - L is in the word but not in position 1.
   - V is not in the word.

Current fixed letters:
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: S

Letters known to be in the word (but positions unknown): L
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, T, N, H, U, V

We need to fill positions 1 and 2 with letters not yet ruled out. The only letter we know must appear is L, but it’s not in position 1. So L must be in position 2.

Therefore:
- Position 2: L
- Position 1: must be a new letter not yet used or ruled out.

Remaining consonants not yet tried and not ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, K, M, P, W, Y, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word with pattern: _ L O E S.

Looking up valid English words: “BLOES” is not valid, “CLOES” is not valid, “DLOES” is not valid, “FLOES” is valid (though rare), “GLOES” is not valid, “KLOES” is not valid, “MLOES” is not valid, “PLOES” is not valid, “WLOES” is not valid, “YLOES” is not valid.

Wait, let me double-check: “FLOES” is actually a valid English word (plural of floe). It fits the pattern _ L O E S.

Let me verify:
- F: not ruled out.
- L: must be in position 2 (since it can’t be in 1,4,5 and 3 is O).
- O: position 3.
- E: position 4.
- S: position 5.

This seems to be the only possible word left that fits all constraints.
