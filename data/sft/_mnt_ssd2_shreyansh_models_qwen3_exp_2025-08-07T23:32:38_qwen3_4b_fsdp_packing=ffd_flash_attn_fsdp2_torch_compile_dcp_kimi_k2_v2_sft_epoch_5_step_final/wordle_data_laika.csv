Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps us quickly eliminate or confirm many possible letters.

Common starting words include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- CRISP
- ADIEU
- AUDIO
- RAISE

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it contains:
- C (very common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Letters that are **not** in the word at all:

Letters that **are** in the word but whose positions are still unknown:  
- A (must appear somewhere, but NOT in positions 3 or 4)  
- L (must appear somewhere, but NOT in position 5)

Letters that are **correct** and in the **correct** position:  
- I is in position 3 (✓)

So the pattern so far is:

Available positions for A: 1, 2, 5  
Available positions for L: 1, 2, 4  

We also need to introduce new common letters that haven’t been tried yet.  
Remaining common letters: B, F, H, K, M, P, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Place A in a new spot (say position 1).  
2. Place L in a new spot (say position 2).  
3. Fill the remaining two slots with fresh common letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps us quickly eliminate or confirm many possible letters.

Common starting words include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- CRISP
- ADIEU
- AUDIO
- RAISE

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it contains:
- C (very common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)
- N: not in the word (x)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
- A is in the word, but not in position 3.
- C, R, N, E are all absent.
- We still need to test other common vowels (O, I, U) and consonants (S, T, L, etc.).

A good second guess should:
1. Keep the known letter A in a different position.
2. Introduce new common letters not yet tested.
3. Avoid the eliminated letters C, R, N, E.

Possible candidates:
- SLAID (but D is less common)
- STOAL (but O and T are good)
- PLAID (but P is less common)
- GLOAT (but G is less common)
- STAIL (but I is good)
- SALTY (but T and Y are good)

I'll choose ""STOAL"" because:
- It keeps A in position 4 (different from position 3)
- Introduces S, T, O, L which are all common
- Avoids eliminated letters C, R, N, E

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)  
Guess 2: STOAL → S(x) T(x) O(x) A(-) L(-)

What we now know:
- Letters that are **not** in the word at all: C, R, N, E, S, T, O  
- Letters that **are** in the word but in the **wrong** positions: A, L  
  – A is not in position 3 (from CRANE) and not in position 4 (from STOAL).  
  – L is not in position 5 (from STOAL).

We still need to test the remaining common letters: I, U, D, G, H, M, P, Y, B, K, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Place A in a new position (positions 1, 2, or 5).  
2. Place L in a new position (positions 1–4).  
3. Introduce as many new, common letters as possible.

Candidate words:
- PLAIN – uses P, I, N; N already eliminated.  
- PLAIT – uses P, I, T; T already eliminated.  
- BLOAT – uses B, L, O; O already eliminated.  
- DIALS – uses D, I; but S already eliminated.  
- GUILD – uses G, U, I, D; all new letters.

“GUILD” satisfies all constraints:
- G, U, I, D are all new letters.  
- L is in position 2 (new position).  
- No eliminated letters are used.

So I’ll go with GUILD.

Let's summarize everything we know after four guesses.

Letters that are **not** in the word at all:  
C, R, N, E, S, T, O, G, U, D, B, Y

Letters that **are** in the word but whose positions are still unknown:  
- A (must appear somewhere, but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4)  
- L (must appear somewhere, but NOT in positions 4, 5)

Letters that are **correct** and in the **correct** position:  
- I is in position 3 (✓) — this has not changed

So the pattern is:  
_ _ I _ _  (I locked in position 3)

Possible positions for A: 1, 5  
Possible positions for L: 1, 2

We need to test new letters in the remaining slots.  
Letters already used and ruled out: C, R, N, E, S, T, O, G, U, D, B, Y  
Remaining common letters: F, H, K, M, P, V, W, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
- keeps I in position 3  
- places A in position 1 (only remaining spot for A)  
- places L in position 2 (only remaining spot for L)  
- fills positions 4 and 5 with new, common letters.

Candidate: F L I A _  
We need a 5th letter that hasn’t been used.  
F, L, I, A are all allowed so far.  
Possible 5th letters: F, H, K, M, P, V, W, etc.

A good choice is “FLIAH” – but H hasn’t been tried yet and is common.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps us quickly eliminate or confirm many possible letters.

Common starting words include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- CRISP
- ADIEU
- AUDIO
- RAISE

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it contains:
- C (very common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)
- N: not in the word (x)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
- A is in the word, but not in position 3.
- C, R, N, E are all absent.
- We still need to test other common vowels (O, I, U) and consonants (S, T, L, etc.).

A good second guess should:
1. Keep the known letter A in a different position.
2. Introduce new common letters not yet tested.
3. Avoid the eliminated letters C, R, N, E.

Possible candidates:
- SLAID (but D is less common)
- STOAL (but O and T are good)
- PLAID (but P is less common)
- GLOAT (but G is less common)
- STAIL (but I is good)
- SALTY (but T and Y are good)

I'll choose ""STOAL"" because:
- It keeps A in position 4 (different from position 3)
- Introduces S, T, O, L which are all common
- Avoids eliminated letters C, R, N, E

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STOAL -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(x) A(-) L(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)  
Guess 2: STOAL → S(x) T(x) O(x) A(-) L(-)

What we now know:
- Letters that are **not** in the word at all: C, R, N, E, S, T, O  
- Letters that **are** in the word but in the **wrong** positions: A, L  
  – A is not in position 3 (from CRANE) and not in position 4 (from STOAL).  
  – L is not in position 5 (from STOAL).

We still need to test the remaining common letters: I, U, D, G, H, M, P, Y, B, K, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Place A in a new position (positions 1, 2, or 5).  
2. Place L in a new position (positions 1–4).  
3. Introduce as many new, common letters as possible.

Candidate words:
- PLAIN – uses P, I, N; N already eliminated.  
- PLAIT – uses P, I, T; T already eliminated.  
- BLOAT – uses B, L, O; O already eliminated.  
- DIALS – uses D, I; but S already eliminated.  
- GUILD – uses G, U, I, D; all new letters.

“GUILD” satisfies all constraints:
- G, U, I, D are all new letters.  
- L is in position 2 (new position).  
- No eliminated letters are used.

So I’ll go with GUILD.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Letters that are **not** in the word at all:  
C, R, N, E, S, T, O, G, U, D

Letters that **are** in the word but whose positions are still unknown:  
- A (must appear somewhere, but NOT in positions 3 or 4)  
- L (must appear somewhere, but NOT in position 5)

Letters that are **correct** and in the **correct** position:  
- I is in position 3 (✓)

So the pattern so far is:  
_ _ I _ _  (with A and L still to place)

Available positions for A: 1, 2, 5  
Available positions for L: 1, 2, 4  

We also need to introduce new common letters that haven’t been tried yet.  
Remaining common letters: B, F, H, K, M, P, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Place A in a new spot (say position 1).  
2. Place L in a new spot (say position 2).  
3. Fill the remaining two slots with fresh common letters.

Candidate words that fit _ A I L _ :  
- FAILY (but Y is okay, F is new)  
- MAINT (T is out)  
- PAINT (T is out)  

Candidate words that fit _ _ I A L :  
- BIALY (Y is okay, B is new)  
- FIALLY (double L is allowed, F and Y new)  

Candidate words that fit _ _ I L A :  
- MULIA (U is out)  
- PIVAL (V is less common)  

Best choice: BIALY  
- B and Y are new letters.  
- A is in position 2 (new spot).  
- L is in position 4 (new spot).  
- I is confirmed in position 3.  
- No eliminated letters are used.
