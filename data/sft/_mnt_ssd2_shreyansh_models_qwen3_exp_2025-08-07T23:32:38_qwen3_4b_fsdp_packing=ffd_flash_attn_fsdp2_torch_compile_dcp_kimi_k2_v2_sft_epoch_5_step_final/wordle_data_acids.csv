### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. The best strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate or confirm many possibilities at once.

Common letters in English include: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, etc. A good starting word should contain several of these letters without repeating any letters to maximize coverage.

Some popular strong starting words are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) that appear in many English words, giving good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- L is not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not third).

- E is not in the word at all.

2. Avoids positions 1 for S and 3 for A.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. The best strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate or confirm many possibilities at once.

Common letters in English include: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, etc. A good starting word should contain several of these letters without repeating any letters to maximize coverage.

Some popular strong starting words are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) that appear in many English words, giving good coverage for the first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- L is not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not third).
- T is not in the word at all.
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains S and A, but not L, T, or E.
- S is not in position 1, A is not in position 3.

We need a new word that:
1. Uses S and A.
2. Avoids positions 1 for S and 3 for A.
3. Avoids letters L, T, E.

Possible letters left: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let's try to place S in positions 2-5 and A in positions 1,2,4,5.

A good candidate is ""CRASH"":
- C, R, A, S, H
- Contains A and S.
- A is in position 3 (but feedback said A is not in position 3), so this is invalid.

Next candidate: ""SHARD"":
- S, H, A, R, D
- S is in position 1 (invalid, feedback says S is not in position 1).

Next candidate: ""SANDY"":
- S, A, N, D, Y
- S is in position 1 (invalid).

Next candidate: ""RASPY"":
- R, A, S, P, Y
- A is in position 2, S in position 3.
- This satisfies:
  - Contains A and S.
  - A not in position 3.
  - S not in position 1.
  - No L, T, E.

This seems valid.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: RASPY -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) S(-) P(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: L, T, E, R, P, Y  
Letters that ARE in the word: S, A (both still in “wrong position” status)

Positions ruled out so far:
- S is NOT in position 1 (SLATE) and NOT in position 3 (RASPY).
- A is NOT in position 3 (SLATE) and NOT in position 2 (RASPY).

So:
- S must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

We still need three more letters (positions not yet occupied by S or A) that are not in the forbidden set {L, T, E, R, P, Y}.  
Available letters (common ones first): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, U, V, W, X, Z.

Let’s try to place S and A together in a valid pattern and fill the rest with common available letters.

One pattern that fits:
A _ S _ _   (A in 1, S in 3) – but S cannot be in 3 (RASPY feedback), so skip.

_ A _ S _   (A in 2, S in 4) – but A cannot be in 2 (RASPY feedback), so skip.

_ _ A S _   (A in 3) – A cannot be in 3 (SLATE feedback), so skip.

S _ A _ _   (S in 1) – S cannot be in 1 (SLATE feedback), so skip.

S _ _ A _   (A in 4) – valid so far.
S _ _ A _   → need a 2nd and 3rd letter from available pool.

Let’s pick S, then two common consonants, then A.

Candidate: S, C, H, A, N → “SCANA” – but that’s not a valid English word.

Candidate: S, C, O, A, L – but L is forbidden.

Candidate: S, C, O, A, M → “SCOAM” – invalid.

Candidate: S, H, A, L, D – L forbidden.

Candidate: S, H, A, R, D – R forbidden.

Candidate: S, H, A, V, E – E forbidden.

Candidate: S, H, A, V, E – again E forbidden.

Let’s try placing A first in position 1, then S in 4 or 5.

A _ _ S _   (A in 1, S in 4) → need 2nd and 3rd letters from available set.

A, C, H, S, N → “ACHSN” – invalid.

A, C, O, S, N → “ACOSN” – invalid.

A, C, K, S, N → “ACKSN” – invalid.

Let’s try A in position 4, S in position 2 or 5.

_ S _ A _   (A in 4, S in 2) → need 1st, 3rd, 5th letters.

B, S, C, A, N → “BSCAN” – invalid.

C, S, O, A, N → “CSOAN” – invalid.

D, S, O, A, N → “DSOAN” – invalid.

Let’s try S in position 5, A in position 1 or 4.

A _ _ _ S   (A in 1, S in 5) → need 2nd, 3rd, 4th letters.

A, C, O, M, S → “ACOMS” – invalid.

A, C, H, O, S → “ACHOS” – invalid.

A, C, H, O, S – again invalid.

_ _ A _ S   (A in 3, S in 5) – A cannot be in 3 (SLATE feedback), so skip.

_ _ _ A S   (A in 4, S in 5) – valid positions.

Need 1st and 2nd letters from available set.

C, H, A, O, S → “CHAOS” – valid English word!

Check constraints:
- Letters used: C, H, A, O, S – none are forbidden (L, T, E, R, P, Y) ✔
- A is in position 4 (not 2 or 3) ✔
- S is in position 5 (not 1 or 3) ✔

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. The best strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate or confirm many possibilities at once.

Common letters in English include: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, etc. A good starting word should contain several of these letters without repeating any letters to maximize coverage.

Some popular strong starting words are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) that appear in many English words, giving good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- L is not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not third).
- T is not in the word at all.
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains S and A, but not L, T, or E.
- S is not in position 1, A is not in position 3.

We need a new word that:
1. Uses S and A.
2. Avoids positions 1 for S and 3 for A.
3. Avoids letters L, T, E.

Possible letters left: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let's try to place S in positions 2-5 and A in positions 1,2,4,5.

A good candidate is ""CRASH"":
- C, R, A, S, H
- Contains A and S.
- A is in position 3 (but feedback said A is not in position 3), so this is invalid.

Next candidate: ""SHARD"":

- S is in position 1 (invalid, feedback says S is not in position 1).

Next candidate: ""SANDY"":
- S, A, N, D, Y
- S is in position 1 (invalid).

Next candidate: ""RASPY"":
- R, A, S, P, Y
- A is in position 2, S in position 3.
- This satisfies:
  - Contains A and S.
  - A not in position 3.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: RASPY -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) S(-) P(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: L, T, E, R, P, Y  
Letters that ARE in the word: S, A (both still in “wrong position” status)

Positions ruled out so far:
- S is NOT in position 1 (SLATE) and NOT in position 3 (RASPY).
- A is NOT in position 3 (SLATE) and NOT in position 2 (RASPY).

So:
- S must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

We still need three more letters (positions not yet occupied by S or A) that are not in the forbidden set {L, T, E, R, P, Y}.  
Available letters (common ones first): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, U, V, W, X, Z.

Let’s try to place S and A together in a valid pattern and fill the rest with common available letters.

One pattern that fits:
A _ S _ _   (A in 1, S in 3) – but S cannot be in 3 (RASPY feedback), so skip.

_ A _ S _   (A in 2, S in 4) – but A cannot be in 2 (RASPY feedback), so skip.

_ _ A S _   (A in 3) – A cannot be in 3 (SLATE feedback), so skip.

S _ A _ _   (S in 1) – S cannot be in 1 (SLATE feedback), so skip.

S _ _ A _   (A in 4) – valid so far.
S _ _ A _   → need a 2nd and 3rd letter from available pool.

Let’s pick S, then two common consonants, then A.

Candidate: S, C, H, A, N → “SCANA” – but that’s not a valid English word.

Candidate: S, C, O, A, L – but L is forbidden.

Candidate: S, C, O, A, M → “SCOAM” – invalid.

Candidate: S, H, A, L, D – L forbidden.

Candidate: S, H, A, R, D – R forbidden.

Candidate: S, H, A, V, E – E forbidden.

Candidate: S, H, A, V, E – again E forbidden.

Let’s try placing A first in position 1, then S in 4 or 5.

A _ _ S _   (A in 1, S in 4) → need 2nd and 3rd letters from available set.

A, C, H, S, N → “ACHSN” – invalid.

A, C, O, S, N → “ACOSN” – invalid.

A, C, K, S, N → “ACKSN” – invalid.

Let’s try A in position 4, S in position 2 or 5.

_ S _ A _   (A in 4, S in 2) → need 1st, 3rd, 5th letters.

B, S, C, A, N → “BSCAN” – invalid.

C, S, O, A, N → “CSOAN” – invalid.

D, S, O, A, N → “DSOAN” – invalid.

Let’s try S in position 5, A in position 1 or 4.

A _ _ _ S   (A in 1, S in 5) → need 2nd, 3rd, 4th letters.

A, C, O, M, S → “ACOMS” – invalid.

A, C, H, O, S → “ACHOS” – invalid.

A, C, H, O, S – again invalid.

_ _ A _ S   (A in 3, S in 5) – A cannot be in 3 (SLATE feedback), so skip.

_ _ _ A S   (A in 4, S in 5) – valid positions.

Need 1st and 2nd letters from available set.

C, H, A, O, S → “CHAOS” – valid English word!

Check constraints:
- Letters used: C, H, A, O, S – none are forbidden (L, T, E, R, P, Y) ✔
- A is in position 4 (not 2 or 3) ✔
- S is in position 5 (not 1 or 3) ✔
- No duplicates, all letters fresh ✔

This satisfies every known rule.

From the new feedback on CHAOS:

- C is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- H is not in the word.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 3rd).
- O is not in the word.
- S is in the word and in the correct 5th position.

So far we know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: L, T, E, R, P, Y, H, O  
Letters that ARE in the word: S (fixed at 5th position), C, A  
Positions ruled out:
- S is only in position 5 (✓).
- C is not in position 1.
- A is not in position 3 (from SLATE) and not in position 4 (from CHAOS).

So:
- 5th letter = S
- C must be in positions 2, 3, or 4
- A must be in positions 1, 2, or 5 (but 5 is S), so positions 1 or 2

We need two more letters (positions not yet filled by C or A) from the remaining available letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (excluding the forbidden set).

Let’s try to place A and C together in valid positions:

Case 1: A in position 1
A _ _ _ S
C must be in 2, 3, or 4
Need two more letters for the remaining spots.

Possible pattern: A C _ _ S
Need two letters from available set. Common ones: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, N, U, V, W, etc.

Try A C B N S → ""ACBNS"" – invalid
A C B D S → ""ACBDS"" – invalid
A C M I S → ""ACMIS"" – invalid
A C K N S → ""ACKNS"" – invalid

Try A _ C _ S
A B C N S → ""ABCNS"" – invalid
A B N C S → ""ABNCS"" – invalid

Try A _ _ C S
A B N C S → ""ABNCS"" – invalid
A B I C S → ""ABICS"" – invalid

Case 2: A in position 2
_ A _ _ S
C must be in 2, 3, or 4. But 2 is A, so C in 3 or 4.

Pattern 1: _ A C _ S
Need 1st and 4th letters from available set.
B, D, F, G, I, K, M, N, U, V, W, etc.

Try B A C N S → ""BACNS"" – invalid
B A C K S → ""BACKS"" – valid word!

Check constraints:
- Letters: B, A, C, K, S – none forbidden ✔
- S is 5th ✓
- C is 3rd (not 1st) ✔
- A is 2nd (not 3rd or 4th) ✔
- No duplicates, all fresh ✔

From the new feedback on BACKS:

- B is not in the word.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 2nd).
- C is in the word but in the wrong position (not 3rd).
- K is not in the word.
- S is confirmed in the correct 5th position.

Summary of all constraints so far:

Letters that are NOT in the word: L, T, E, R, P, Y, H, O, B, K  
Letters that ARE in the word: S (fixed at 5th), C, A  
Positions ruled out:
- S is only in position 5 (✓).
- C is not in position 1 (from CHAOS) and not in position 3 (from BACKS).
- A is not in position 2 (from BACKS) and not in position 3 (from SLATE) and not in position 4 (from CHAOS).

So:
- 5th letter = S
- C must be in positions 2 or 4 (cannot be 1, 3, or 5)
- A must be in position 1 or 2 (cannot be 3, 4, or 5)

We need one more letter (the remaining position) from the available letters: D, F, G, I, J, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Let’s explore possible placements:

Case 1: A in position 1
A _ _ _ S
C must be in 2 or 4.

Subcase 1a: C in position 2
A C _ _ S
Need one letter for position 3 or 4. But we need two letters total, so this is impossible (only one blank). Actually, we need three letters total, but we already have A, C, S. We need two more letters, but we only have one blank. Wait, no: the word has five letters, and we have A, C, S fixed in positions 1, 2, 5. So positions 3 and 4 are open. But we have only one letter to place (since C is in 2). Actually, we need to place one more letter in either position 3 or 4.

But we have only one letter to place (since A, C, S are fixed). This seems impossible because we need two more letters to fill positions 3 and 4. This suggests Case 1a is invalid because we need two letters but only one is determined.

Subcase 1b: C in position 4
A _ _ C S
Now we have A in 1, C in 4, S in 5. We need letters for positions 2 and 3 from the available set: D, F, G, I, J, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form A _ _ C S.

Possible combinations:
- A D I C S → ""ADICS"" – invalid
- A F I C S → ""AFICS"" – invalid
- A M I C S → ""AMICS"" – invalid
- A N I C S → ""ANICS"" – invalid
- A D N C S → ""ADNCS"" – invalid
- A M N C S → ""AMNCS"" – invalid

None of these seem valid. Let’s try Case 2.

Case 2: A in position 2
_ A _ _ S
C must be in position 2 or 4. Position 2 is A, so C must be in position 4.
_ A _ C S

Now we have positions 1 and 3 open. We need letters for positions 1 and 3 from the available set: D, F, G, I, J, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form _ A _ C S.

Possible combinations:
- D A M C S → ""DAMCS"" – invalid
- D A N C S → ""DANCS"" – invalid
- D A I C S → ""DAICS"" – invalid
- F A M C S → ""FAMCS"" – invalid
- M A N C S → ""MANCS"" – invalid
- N A M C S → ""NAMCS"" – invalid
- D A F C S → ""DAFCS"" – invalid

This seems problematic. Let me think differently: perhaps the word has letters A, C, S plus two other letters. We have:

Positions:
1: ?
2: ?
3: ?
4: ?
5: S (fixed)

Constraints:
- Must contain A and C.
- A cannot be in 2, 3, 4.
- C cannot be in 1, 3, 5.
- Forbidden letters: L, T, E, R, P, Y, H, O, B, K.

So possible positions:
- A can only be in 1 (since 2,3,4,5 are excluded).
- C can be in 2 or 4 (cannot be 1,3,5).

So:
A _ _ _ S
C must be in 2 or 4.

Subcase 1: C in 2
A C _ _ S
We need letters for positions 3 and 4 from available set: D, F, G, I, J, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a valid word ""A C _ _ S"". Possible words:
- A C I N S → ""ACINS"" – invalid
- A C M I S → ""ACMIS"" – invalid
- A C N I S → ""ACNIS"" – invalid
- A C D I S → ""ACDIS"" – invalid

Subcase 2: C in 4
A _ _ C S
We need letters for positions 2 and 3 from available set: D, F, G, I, J, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a valid word ""A _ _ C S"". Possible words:
- A D I C S → ""ADICS"" – invalid
- A F I C S → ""AFICS"" – invalid
- A M I C S → ""AMICS"" – invalid
- A N I C S → ""ANICS"" – invalid
- A D N C S → ""ADNCS"" – invalid
- A M N C S → ""AMNCS"" – invalid

This is not working. Maybe I missed a valid word. Let me think of actual words:

Looking for 5-letter words ending in S, containing A and C, with A in 1 or 2, C in 2 or 4, and no forbidden letters.

Possible candidates:
- A C _ _ S: ""ACIDS"" – but I is allowed, D is allowed. ""ACIDS"" is valid.
Check constraints:
  - Letters: A, C, I, D, S – none forbidden ✔
  - A in 1, C in 2, S in 5 ✔
  - No other constraints violated ✔

This seems valid.

- A D I C S → ""ADICS"" – invalid
- A F I C S → ""AFICS"" – invalid
- A M I C S → ""AMICS"" – invalid
- A N I C S → ""ANICS"" – invalid
- A D N C S → ""ADNCS"" – invalid
- A M N C S → ""AMNCS"" – invalid

None of these seem valid. Let’s try Case 2.

Case 2: A in position 2
_ A _ _ S
C must be in position 2 or 4. Position 2 is A, so C must be in position 4.
_ A _ C S

Now we have positions 1 and 3 open. We need letters for positions 1 and 3 from the available set: D, F, G, I, J, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form _ A _ C S.

Possible combinations:
- D A M C S → ""DAMCS"" – invalid
- D A N C S → ""DANCS"" – invalid
- D A I C S → ""DAICS"" – invalid
- F A M C S → ""FAMCS"" – invalid
- M A N C S → ""MANCS"" – invalid
- N A M C S → ""NAMCS"" – invalid
- D A F C S → ""DAFCS"" – invalid

This seems problematic. Let me think differently: perhaps the word has letters A, C, S plus two other letters. We have:

Positions:
1: ?
2: ?
3: ?
4: ?
5: S (fixed)

Constraints:
- Must contain A and C.
- A cannot be in 2, 3, 4.
- C cannot be in 1, 3, 5.
- Forbidden letters: L, T, E, R, P, Y, H, O, B, K.

So possible positions:
- A can only be in 1 (since 2,3,4,5 are excluded).
- C can be in 2 or 4 (cannot be 1,3,5).

So:
A _ _ _ S
C must be in 2 or 4.

Subcase 1: C in 2
A C _ _ S
We need letters for positions 3 and 4 from available set: D, F, G, I, J, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a valid word ""A C _ _ S"". Possible words:
- A C I N S → ""ACINS"" – invalid
- A C M I S → ""ACMIS"" – invalid
- A C N I S → ""ACNIS"" – invalid
- A C D I S → ""ACDIS"" – invalid

Subcase 2: C in 4
A _ _ C S
We need letters for positions 2 and 3 from available set: D, F, G, I, J, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a valid word ""A _ _ C S"". Possible words:
- A D I C S → ""ADICS"" – invalid
- A F I C S → ""AFICS"" – invalid
- A M I C S → ""AMICS"" – invalid
- A N I C S → ""ANICS"" – invalid
- A D N C S → ""ADNCS"" – invalid
- A M N C S → ""AMNCS"" – invalid

This is not working. Maybe I missed a valid word. Let me think of actual words:

Looking for 5-letter words ending in S, containing A and C, with A in 1 or 2, C in 2 or 4, and no forbidden letters.

Possible candidates:
- A C _ _ S: ""ACIDS"" – but I is allowed, D is allowed. ""ACIDS"" is valid.
Check constraints:
  - Letters: A, C, I, D, S – none forbidden ✔
  - A in 1, C in 2, S in 5 ✔
  - No other constraints violated ✔

This seems valid.

<guess>ACIDS</guess>",Guess 5: ACIDS -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) C(✓) I(✓) D(✓) S(✓),SUCCESS
