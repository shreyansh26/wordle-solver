For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first guess should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains five of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid English word. This gives us the best chance to identify which of these common letters are in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not fourth).
- E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain R, O, or E.
- Does contain A and S, but A is not in position 1 and S is not in position 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A and S somewhere other than positions 1 and 4 respectively.
- Avoids R, O, E entirely.
- Uses other common letters to narrow things down.

Good next candidates would be words like STAIN, SLANT, STASH, etc. but we must ensure A and S are in new positions.

Looking at STAIN:
- S is now in position 1 (allowed, since original S was position 4).
- T is common.
- A is in position 3 (allowed, original A was position 1).
- I and N are also common.

This seems like a strong second guess to test new positions for A and S while introducing new common letters.

Letters that are NOT in the word: R, O, E, T, I, N  
Letters that ARE in the word: S (correctly placed in position 1) and A (somewhere, but NOT in positions 1 or 3).

So the secret word looks like: S _ _ _ _

S A _ _ _ → “SALAD” uses A twice (but we don’t know if A appears once or twice).  
“SALAD” also uses L and D, both still allowed.

Another option is “SABOT” but O is already ruled out.  
“SANDY” uses N and D, but N is ruled out.  
“SAPID” uses P and D, but I is ruled out.  
“SALTY” uses T and Y, but T is ruled out.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first guess should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains five of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid English word. This gives us the best chance to identify which of these common letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not fourth).
- E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain R, O, or E.
- Does contain A and S, but A is not in position 1 and S is not in position 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A and S somewhere other than positions 1 and 4 respectively.
- Avoids R, O, E entirely.
- Uses other common letters to narrow things down.

Good next candidates would be words like STAIN, SLANT, STASH, etc. but we must ensure A and S are in new positions.

Looking at STAIN:
- S is now in position 1 (allowed, since original S was position 4).
- T is common.
- A is in position 3 (allowed, original A was position 1).
- I and N are also common.

This seems like a strong second guess to test new positions for A and S while introducing new common letters.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: R, O, E, T, I, N  
Letters that ARE in the word: S (correctly placed in position 1) and A (somewhere, but NOT in positions 1 or 3).

So the secret word looks like: S _ _ _ _

Available letters left to try (common ones we haven’t ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y plus the still-possible A.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S.
- Contains A, but not in position 1 or 3.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible placements for A: positions 2, 4, or 5.

Let’s try a word that puts A in position 2 and tests three new common consonants:  
S A _ _ _ → “SALAD” uses A twice (but we don’t know if A appears once or twice).  
“SALAD” also uses L and D, both still allowed.

Another option is “SABOT” but O is already ruled out.  
“SANDY” uses N and D, but N is ruled out.  
“SAPID” uses P and D, but I is ruled out.  
“SALTY” uses T and Y, but T is ruled out.  
“SALSA” uses S twice and L, but S is already fixed in position 1.

A safer choice is “SALAD” because it keeps A in position 2 and tests L and D, which are still possible.

S A _ _ _ → “SALAD” uses A twice (but we don’t know if A appears once or twice).  
“SALAD” also uses L and D, both still allowed.

Another option is “SABOT” but O is already ruled out.  
“SANDY” uses N and D, but N is ruled out.  
“SAPID” uses P and D, but I is ruled out.  
“SALTY” uses T and Y, but T is ruled out.  
“SALSA” uses S twice and L, but S is already fixed in position 1.

A safer choice is “SALAD” because it keeps A in position 2 and tests L and D, which are still possible.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STAIN -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)
Guess 3: SALAD -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(✓) L(✓) A(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|>

From the feedback so far:

- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E, T, I, N, D  
- Letters confirmed IN the word and their positions:
  – S in position 1  
  – A in position 2  
  – L in position 3  
  – A in position 4  
- So the pattern is: S A L A _

We need a 5-letter word that starts with SALA and ends with a letter that has NOT been ruled out.  
Allowed letters left: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.  

Common endings for SALA:  
- SALAD – but D is ruled out.  
- SALAD is invalid.  
- SALAH – uses H, which hasn’t been ruled out.  
- SALAM – uses M, which hasn’t been ruled out.  
- SALVA – uses V, which hasn’t been ruled out.  
- SALPY – uses Y, but P and Y are allowed.  

Among these, SALAH and SALAM are both valid English words (SALAM is the name of a tree or a type of lizard). SALAH is also a valid word (a variant spelling of “salah” in some contexts).  

Between SALAH and SALAM, SALAM is slightly more common as a word.  
Therefore, I’ll guess SALAM.

We now know:

- Pattern: S A L A _
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E, T, I, N, D, M  
- Remaining unused common consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, P, U, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word that starts with “SAL A” and ends with one of the still-allowed letters.

Possible endings:  
- B → SALAB (not a word)  
- C → SALAC (not a word)  
- F → SALAF (not a word)  
- G → SALAG (not a word)  
- H → SALAH (valid word)  
- K → SALAK (not a word)  
- P → SALAP (not a word)  
- U → SALAU (not a word)  
- V → SALAV (not a word)  
- W → SALAW (not a word)  
- Y → SALAY (not a word)

The only valid English word that fits is SALAH.  
However, we already tried SALAH in Guess 3 and got S(✓) A(✓) L(✓) A(✓) D(x), but that was for SALAD, not SALAH.  
Wait, no: Guess 3 was SALAD, and Guess 4 was SALAM. SALAH is different.

Let me recheck:  
- SALAH is a valid word (meaning “good” in Arabic or a given name).  
- It uses H, which has never been tested and is still allowed.

Therefore, SALAH is the logical next guess.
