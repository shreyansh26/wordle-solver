### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One popular choice is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives a good spread of letters that appear in many 5-letter words, maximizing the chance of getting hits (either ✓ or -) to narrow down possibilities.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- L(-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.
- T(-) → T is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E(-) → E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: S, A.
- Letters definitely present: L, T, E (but not in their previous positions).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains L, T, E.
- Does NOT contain S or A.
- Places L somewhere other than position 2.
- Places T somewhere other than position 4.
- Places E somewhere other than position 5.

Possible positions for L: 1,3,4,5.
Possible positions for T: 1,2,3,5.
Possible positions for E: 1,2,3,4.

A good next guess should test new common consonants and vowels. Since we have E (a vowel), we might want to test another vowel like I or O. Common consonants not yet tested include R, N, D, etc.

A word that fits these constraints and introduces new common letters is ""RELIT"":
- R (new consonant)
- E (known to be present, now in position 2)
- L (known to be present, now in position 3)
- I (new vowel)
- T (known to be present, now in position 5)

This places:
- L in position 3 (not 2) ✓
- T in position 5 (not 4) ✓
- E in position 2 (not 5) ✓
- Introduces R and I as new letters to test.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: S, A, R, I  
2. Letters confirmed in the word: L, T, E  
   - T is in the word and is in the correct final position (position 5).  
   - L and E are in the word but NOT in their positions from Guess 1 and Guess 2.  

   Therefore:
   - L is NOT in positions 2 or 3.  
   - E is NOT in positions 2 or 5.  

   So possible positions for L: 1, 4  
   Possible positions for E: 1, 3, 4  

3. We need a 5-letter word that:
   - Ends with T (position 5).  
   - Contains L and E in allowed positions.  
   - Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no S, A, R, I).  

   Remaining common consonants to try: N, D, C, M, P, B, etc.  
   Vowels left to try: O, U (since A, I are out and E is already known).  

   A good candidate is “MELON”:
   - Ends with N, but we know position 5 must be T. So that’s invalid.  

   Another candidate is “ELBOW” – but it ends with W, not T.  

   Let’s try “TULLE” – but it ends with E, not T.  

   Let’s try “CLEFT”:
   - Ends with T (✓).  
   - Contains L and E.  
   - L is in position 3 (which was ruled out in Guess 2).  

   Next candidate: “BETEL” – ends with L, not T.  

   Let’s try “DELTa” – but A is ruled out.  

   Let’s try “PELT” – but it’s only 4 letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One popular choice is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives a good spread of letters that appear in many 5-letter words, maximizing the chance of getting hits (either ✓ or -) to narrow down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- L(-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.
- T(-) → T is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E(-) → E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: S, A.
- Letters definitely present: L, T, E (but not in their previous positions).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains L, T, E.
- Does NOT contain S or A.
- Places L somewhere other than position 2.
- Places T somewhere other than position 4.
- Places E somewhere other than position 5.

Possible positions for L: 1,3,4,5.
Possible positions for T: 1,2,3,5.
Possible positions for E: 1,2,3,4.

A good next guess should test new common consonants and vowels. Since we have E (a vowel), we might want to test another vowel like I or O. Common consonants not yet tested include R, N, D, etc.

A word that fits these constraints and introduces new common letters is ""RELIT"":
- R (new consonant)
- E (known to be present, now in position 2)
- L (known to be present, now in position 3)
- I (new vowel)
- T (known to be present, now in position 5)

This places:
- L in position 3 (not 2) ✓
- T in position 5 (not 4) ✓
- E in position 2 (not 5) ✓
- Introduces R and I as new letters to test.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, A, R, I  
Letters definitely IN the word: L, T, E  

Fixed position so far: T is in position 5 (✓ in RELIT).  
L is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3.  
E is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 5.

So possible positions:
- L: 1, 4, 5 (but 5 is taken by T), so L must be in 1 or 4.
- E: 1, 3, 4 (cannot be 2 or 5).

We need a word that:
- Ends with T.
- Contains L and E in allowed positions.
- Uses only letters from the remaining pool: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the known L, E, T.

Let’s try to place L in position 4 and E in position 1 or 3.

Candidate words:
- ELBOW: E(1), L(2) – but L cannot be in 2, so reject.
- BLOTE: B(1), L(2) – reject (L in 2).
- FLEET: F(1), L(2) – reject (L in 2).
- GLOTE: G(1), L(2) – reject (L in 2).
- MELTY: M(1), E(2) – reject (E in 2).
- NELTY: N(1), E(2) – reject (E in 2).
- OLENT: O(1), L(2) – reject (L in 2).
- PELTS: P(1), E(2), L(3) – reject (E in 2, L in 3).
- ULENT: U(1), L(2) – reject (L in 2).
- VELT: too short.
- YELT: too short.

Let’s try L in position 1 and E in position 3:
- L E _ _ T  
  Possible third letter: common consonants not used yet: N, D, C, M, B, G, etc.

Word: L E N _ T → LEN_T → “LENT” is only 4 letters.  
Next: L E N C T → “LENC” not a word.  
L E N D T → “LEND” is 4 letters.  
L E N D S → “LEND S” not a word.  
L E N D Y → “LENDY” not a word.  
L E N D R → “LENDER” 6 letters.  
L E N D O → “LEND” + O → “LEND” + O is 5 letters: “LEND” + O = “LEND O” not a word.

Try L E N D _ → “LEND” + ? → “LEND” + “O” is not a word.  
Try L E N C _ → “LENC” + ? → not a word.

Try L E N D _ → “LEND” + ? → not a word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One popular choice is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives a good spread of letters that appear in many 5-letter words, maximizing the chance of getting hits (either ✓ or -) to narrow down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- L(-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.
- T(-) → T is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E(-) → E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: S, A.
- Letters definitely present: L, T, E (but not in their previous positions).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains L, T, E.
- Does NOT contain S or A.
- Places L somewhere other than position 2.
- Places T somewhere other than position 4.
- Places E somewhere other than position 5.

Possible positions for L: 1,3,4,5.
Possible positions for T: 1,2,3,5.
Possible positions for E: 1,2,3,4.

A good next guess should test new common consonants and vowels. Since we have E (a vowel), we might want to test another vowel like I or O. Common consonants not yet tested include R, N, D, etc.

A word that fits these constraints and introduces new common letters is ""RELIT"":
- R (new consonant)
- E (known to be present, now in position 2)
- L (known to be present, now in position 3)
- I (new vowel)
- T (known to be present, now in position 5)

This places:
- L in position 3 (not 2) ✓
- T in position 5 (not 4) ✓
- E in position 2 (not 5) ✓
- Introduces R and I as new letters to test.

From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(x) T(-) E(-)
   - S, A are out.
   - L, T, E are in the word but not in those positions.

2. RELIT → R(x) E(-) L(-) I(x) T(✓)
   - R, I are out.
   - E is in the word but not in position 2.
   - L is in the word but not in position 3.
   - T is in the correct position (position 5).

So far we know:
- Word ends with T (position 5 = T).
- Contains L, E (but not in positions 2,3 and 5 respectively).
- Letters not in word: S, A, R, I.

Remaining positions (1-4) must include L and E, and two other letters not yet tested. Good candidates for new letters: common consonants like N, D, C, M, B, etc.

Let's try a word that:
- Ends with T.
- Has L and E in allowed positions.
- Uses new letters.

A good candidate is ""ELBOW"" but it doesn't end with T. Instead, ""BLENT"" is invalid (not a word). ""DELFT"" is a valid word (a type of mill) and fits:
- D (new letter)
- E (position 2 - allowed since E can't be in 5 but can be in 2)
- L (position 3 - allowed since L can't be in 3 from RELIT, but RELIT said L(-) in position 3, so L can't be in 3. So E in 2, L in 3 is invalid. Need to re-evaluate.)

Wait, RELIT feedback: L(-) in position 3 means L is in word but not in 3. So L must be in 1,2,4.

Also, E(-) in RELIT means E is in word but not in 2. So E must be in 1,3,4.

Word structure: _ _ _ _ T
Must include L and E in positions 1,2,3,4 with constraints:
- L not in 3
- E not in 2

Possible placements:
- E in 1: E _ L _ T or E _ _ L T
- E in 3: _ _ E _ T (but L must be in 1,2,4)
- E in 4: _ _ _ E T (but L must be in 1,2,3)

Let's try ""ELBOW"" - no, ends with T needed. ""ELDER"" - ends with T? No. ""ELBOW"" - no.

Better approach: list possible 5-letter words ending with T, containing L and E, excluding S,A,R,I.

Examples:
- ""L"" must be in 1,2,4
- ""E"" must be in 1,3,4

Possible words:
- ""LEANT"" - A is out
- ""LENT"" - too short
- ""ELBOW"" - no T
- ""L"" in 1: L _ _ _ T
  - L E _ _ T: LEVET (invalid), LEMET (invalid)
  - L _ E _ T: L E _ E T (invalid), L _ E _ T
  - L _ _ E T: L _ _ E T

""LEMON"" - no T. ""LEVER"" - no T. ""LEPT"" - too short.

Wait, ""BLEPT"" - not a word. ""PLEAT"" - A is out. ""CLEFT"" - valid word meaning a narrow strip.

""CLEFT"":
- C (new letter)
- L (position 2 - allowed since L can't be in 3 but can be in 2)
- E (position 3 - allowed since E can't be in 2 but can be in 3)
- F (new letter)
- T (position 5 - correct)

This fits all constraints:
- Ends with T
- Contains L and E in allowed positions
- Introduces new letters C and F

Remaining positions (1-4) must include L and E, and two other letters not yet tested. Good candidates for new letters: common consonants like N, D, C, M, B, etc.

Let's try a word that:
- Ends with T.
- Has L and E in allowed positions.
- Uses new letters.

A good candidate is ""ELBOW"" but it doesn't end with T. Instead, ""BLENT"" is invalid (not a word). ""DELFT"" is a valid word (a type of mill) and fits:
- D (new letter)
- E (position 2 - allowed since E can't be in 5 but can be in 2)
- L (position 3 - allowed since L can't be in 3 from RELIT, but RELIT said L(-) in position 3, so L can't be in 3. So E in 2, L in 3 is invalid. Need to re-evaluate.)

Wait, RELIT feedback: L(-) in position 3 means L is in word but not in 3. So L must be in 1,2,4.

Also, E(-) in RELIT means E is in word but not in 2. So E must be in 1,3,4.

Word structure: _ _ _ _ T
Must include L and E in positions 1,2,3,4 with constraints:
- L not in 3
- E not in 2

Possible placements:
- E in 1: E _ L _ T or E _ _ L T
- E in 3: _ _ E _ T (but L must be in 1,2,4)
- E in 4: _ _ _ E T (but L must be in 1,2,3)

Let's try ""ELBOW"" - no, ends with T needed. ""ELDER"" - ends with T? No. ""ELBOW"" - no.

Better approach: list possible 5-letter words ending with T, containing L and E, excluding S,A,R,I.

Examples:
- ""L"" must be in 1,2,4
- ""E"" must be in 1,3,4

Possible words:
- ""LEANT"" - A is out
- ""LENT"" - too short
- ""ELBOW"" - no T
- ""L"" in 1: L _ _ _ T
  - L E _ _ T: LEVET (invalid), LEMET (invalid)
  - L _ E _ T: L E _ E T (invalid), L _ E _ T
  - L _ _ E T: L _ _ E T

""LEMON"" - no T. ""LEVER"" - no T. ""LEPT"" - too short.

Wait, ""BLEPT"" - not a word. ""PLEAT"" - A is out. ""CLEFT"" - valid word meaning a narrow strip.

""CLEFT"":
- C (new letter)
- L (position 2 - allowed since L can't be in 3 but can be in 2)
- E (position 3 - allowed since E can't be in 2 but can be in 3)
- F (new letter)
- T (position 5 - correct)

This fits all constraints:

- Contains L and E in allowed positions
- Introduces new letters C and F",Guess 5: CLEFT -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(-) E(-) F(x) T(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One popular choice is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives a good spread of letters that appear in many 5-letter words, maximizing the chance of getting hits (either ✓ or -) to narrow down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- L(-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.
- T(-) → T is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E(-) → E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: S, A.
- Letters definitely present: L, T, E (but not in their previous positions).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains L, T, E.
- Does NOT contain S or A.
- Places L somewhere other than position 2.
- Places T somewhere other than position 4.
- Places E somewhere other than position 5.

Possible positions for L: 1,3,4,5.
Possible positions for T: 1,2,3,5.
Possible positions for E: 1,2,3,4.

A good next guess should test new common consonants and vowels. Since we have E (a vowel), we might want to test another vowel like I or O. Common consonants not yet tested include R, N, D, etc.

A word that fits these constraints and introduces new common letters is ""RELIT"":
- R (new consonant)
- E (known to be present, now in position 2)
- L (known to be present, now in position 3)
- I (new vowel)
- T (known to be present, now in position 5)

This places:
- L in position 3 (not 2) ✓
- T in position 5 (not 4) ✓
- E in position 2 (not 5) ✓
- Introduces R and I as new letters to test.

From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(x) T(-) E(-)
   - S, A are out.
   - L, T, E are in the word but not in those positions.

2. RELIT → R(x) E(-) L(-) I(x) T(✓)
   - R, I are out.
   - E is in the word but not in position 2.
   - L is in the word but not in position 3.
   - T is in the correct position (position 5).

So far we know:
- Word ends with T (position 5 = T).
- Contains L, E (but not in positions 2,3 and 5 respectively).
- Letters not in word: S, A, R, I.

Remaining positions (1-4) must include L and E, and two other letters not yet tested. Good candidates for new letters: common consonants like N, D, C, M, B, etc.

Let's try a word that:
- Ends with T.
- Has L and E in allowed positions.

Wait, RELIT feedback: L(-) in position 3 means L is in word but not in 3. So L must be in 1,2,4.

Also, E(-) in RELIT means E is in word but not in 2. So E must be in 1,3,4.

Word structure: _ _ _ _ T

- E in 3: _ _ E _ T (but L must be in 1,2,4)
- E in 4: _ _ _ E T (but L must be in 1,2,3)

Let's try ""ELBOW"" - no, ends with T needed. ""ELDER"" - ends with T? No. ""ELBOW"" - no.

Better approach: list possible 5-letter words ending with T, containing L and E, excluding S,A,R,I.

Examples:

Possible words:
- ""LEANT"" - A is out

  - L E _ _ T: LEVET (invalid), LEMET (invalid)
  - L _ E _ T: L E _ E T (invalid), L _ E _ T
  - L _ _ E T: L _ _ E T

""LEMON"" - no T. ""LEVER"" - no T. ""LEPT"" - too short.

Wait, ""BLEPT"" - not a word. ""PLEAT"" - A is out. ""CLEFT"" - valid word meaning a narrow strip.

""CLEFT"":

- E (position 3 - allowed since E can't be in 2 but can be in 3)

From the latest feedback:

CLEFT → C(x) L(-) E(-) F(x) T(✓)

- C and F are NOT in the word.
- L is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- T is correctly placed at position 5.

So far we know:
- Word ends with T (position 5 = T).
- Must contain L and E.
- Letters NOT in word: S, A, R, I, C, F.
- L cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from RELIT and CLEFT feedback).
- E cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from RELIT and CLEFT feedback).

Possible positions for L: 1, 4.
Possible positions for E: 1, 4.

But L and E must both appear exactly once each, so they must occupy two different positions among 1 and 4. The only way this works is if one is in position 1 and the other is in position 4.

Thus the word structure is:
- Position 1: L or E
- Position 2: ?
- Position 3: ?
- Position 4: the other of L or E
- Position 5: T

We need two new consonants for positions 2 and 3 from the remaining unused common letters (excluding S, A, R, I, C, F). Good candidates: B, D, G, H, K, M, N, P, U, Y, etc.

Let's try placing L in position 1 and E in position 4:
L _ _ E T

We need two consonants for positions 2 and 3. A common pair is N and D, forming L N D E T → ""L N D E T"" is not a word. ""L U D E T"" is not a word. ""L U N E T"" is not a word. ""L U G E T"" is not a word.
