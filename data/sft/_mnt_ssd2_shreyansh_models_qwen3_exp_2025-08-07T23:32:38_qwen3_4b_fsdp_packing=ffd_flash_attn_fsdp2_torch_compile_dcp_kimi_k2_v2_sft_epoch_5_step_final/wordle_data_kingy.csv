For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting letters include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess should cover a variety of these letters to help eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

Popular strong starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and is a valid 5-letter English word.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) were marked “x”, which means none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
Therefore, the word must be composed entirely of letters that are **not** S, L, A, T, or E.

From the two guesses we have:

- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E are all absent.
- BRICK: B, R, C are absent; I and K are present but in wrong positions.

So far we know:
- Letters not in the word at all: S, L, A, T, E, B, R, C.
- Letters that are in the word somewhere: I and K (but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both I and K.
2. Does not contain any of S, L, A, T, E, B, R, C.
3. Places I and K in different positions from their previous guesses (I not in 3rd, K not in 5th).

Available letters (excluding the eight ruled out): D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a valid word using I and K plus three other available letters, ensuring I and K are not in their previous positions.

Possible words:
- DINKY (but Y is allowed, but K is in 4th, which is new)
- MINKY (same issue)
- QUICK (Q, U, I, C, K – but C is ruled out)
- FINKY (F, I, N, K, Y – positions: I in 2nd, K in 4th. Neither is in 3rd or 5th, so valid)

So the word structure is: _ I _ _ Y, and must contain K somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Available letters (not yet ruled out): D, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting letters include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess should cover a variety of these letters to help eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

Popular strong starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and is a valid 5-letter English word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) were marked “x”, which means none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
Therefore, the word must be composed entirely of letters that are **not** S, L, A, T, or E.

To maximize information on the second try, I’ll pick a word that uses five new common letters, none of which were in SLATE.  
Good candidates:  
- CRONY (C, R, O, N, Y)  
- BRICK (B, R, I, C, K)  
- PRIMO (P, R, I, M, O)  
- DRINK (D, R, I, N, K)

I’ll choose **BRICK** because it introduces B, R, I, C, K—five very common letters that haven’t been tested yet.

From the two guesses we have:

- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E are all absent.
- BRICK: B, R, C are absent; I and K are present but in wrong positions.

So far we know:
- Letters not in the word at all: S, L, A, T, E, B, R, C.
- Letters that are in the word somewhere: I and K (but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both I and K.
2. Does not contain any of S, L, A, T, E, B, R, C.
3. Places I and K in different positions from their previous guesses (I not in 3rd, K not in 5th).

Available letters (excluding the eight ruled out): D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a valid word using I and K plus three other available letters, ensuring I and K are not in their previous positions.

Possible words:
- DINKY (but Y is allowed, but K is in 4th, which is new)
- MINKY (same issue)
- QUICK (Q, U, I, C, K – but C is ruled out)
- FINKY (F, I, N, K, Y – positions: I in 2nd, K in 4th. Neither is in 3rd or 5th, so valid)
- GINNY (but lacks K)
- HIKER (E, R ruled out)
- DIXIE (E ruled out)
- KIDNE (E ruled out)

Looking at FINKY:
- Letters: F, I, N, K, Y – all allowed.
- I is in 2nd position (was 3rd before, so new).
- K is in 4th position (was 5th before, so new).
- No forbidden letters.

This seems like a good next guess.

Maybe ""K I N G Y"" – but G is allowed, N is already known to be in the word, but where is N?\n\nFrom feedback:\n- Guess 3: N is in position 3 (✓)\nSo the word structure is: _ I N _ Y, and must contain K somewhere.\n\nSo the structure is: _ I N _ Y with K in position 1 or 4.\n\nPossible words:\n- K I N D Y – K in 1st, I in 2nd, N in 3rd, D in 4th, Y in 5th\n- G I N K Y – but K would be in 4th (invalid)\n- P I N K Y – K in 4th (invalid)\n- M I N K Y – K in 4th (invalid)\n\nOnly valid word seems to be K I N D Y.\n\nLet\'s check:\n- K I N D Y\n- Letters: K, I, N, D, Y – all allowed\n- I in 2nd (✓), Y in 5th (✓), K in 1st (new position, not 4th), N in 3rd (✓)\n- No forbidden letters\n\nThis fits all constraints.\n\n<guess>KINDY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: BRICK -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(x) I(-) C(x) K(-)\nGuess 3: FINKY -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(✓) N(✓) K(-) Y(✓)\nGuess 4: KINDY -> FEEDBACK: K(✓) I(✓) N(✓) D(x) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
Current confirmed facts:
- Word is _ I N _ Y
- K is in position 1 (✓)
- D is not in the word at all (x)
- All other letters ruled out so far: S, L, A, T, E, B, R, C, F, D
- Allowed letters left: G, H, J, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

So the word must be K I N _ Y with the blank filled by any of the remaining allowed letters.  
The only valid 5-letter English word fitting this pattern is K I N G Y.

Check:
- K I N G Y
- Letters: K, I, N, G, Y – all allowed
- Positions: K(1✓), I(2✓), N(3✓), Y(5✓), G(4) – no conflicts
