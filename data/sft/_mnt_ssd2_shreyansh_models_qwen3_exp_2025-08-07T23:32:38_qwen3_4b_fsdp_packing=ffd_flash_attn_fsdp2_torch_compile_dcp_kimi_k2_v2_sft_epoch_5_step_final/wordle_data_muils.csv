### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This combination gives us maximum information about the presence of these letters in the secret word.

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
Guess 2: STING → S(-) T(x) I(✓) N(x) G(x)

Key deductions so far:
1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, N, G.  
2. S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4.  
3. I is in the word and is in the correct position (position 3).

So the secret word looks like: _ _ I _ _  
and must contain S somewhere in positions 2 or 5 (since 1 and 4 are ruled out).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 3.  
- Contains S in position 2 or 5.  
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus S and I.

A good candidate is “BISCU” – but wait, that’s not a valid English word.  
Another candidate: “DISKS” – invalid (S in position 5 is allowed, but double S may not help).  
“FISTS” – valid word, uses S in position 5 and has I in position 3.  
“MISOS” – invalid (O already ruled out).  
“WISPS” – valid, S in position 5, I in position 3, and uses P (new letter).

Between “FISTS” and “WISPS”, both fit. “FISTS” tests F, S, T (but T is already ruled out), so actually “WISPS” is better as it introduces W and P.

So the next guess: WISPS.

Check:
- W, P are new letters.  
- S is in position 5 (allowed).  
- I is in position 3 (matches ✓).  
- No A, R, O, E, T, N, G appear.

Let's carefully update what we now know after the three guesses.

Confirmed letters:
- I is in the word, but NOT in position 2 (from WISPS feedback: I(-))  
- S is in the word, and now we also know it is in the correct position 5 (from WISPS feedback: S(✓))

So the word structure is: _ _ _ _ S
and it must contain I somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since I is not in position 2).

We have tried:
- AROSE: A,R,O,E,S
- STING: S,T,I,N,G
- WISPS: W,I,S,P,S

Remaining unused common letters: B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, U, V, Y

We need a 5-letter word ending in S, containing I, and using only the remaining letters.

Possible candidates:
- B I _ _ S → BIVUS (invalid), BILBS (invalid), BIKIS (invalid)
- C I _ _ S → CIVIS (valid), but V is allowed
- D I _ _ S → DILIS (invalid), DIMIS (invalid)
- F I _ _ S → FIVIS (invalid)
- H I _ _ S → HILIS (invalid)
- K I _ _ S → KILIS (invalid)
- L I _ _ S → LIVIS (invalid)
- M I _ _ S → MIVIS (invalid)
- U I _ _ S → UIVIS (invalid)

Wait, let's think differently: the word must be _ _ _ _ S with I somewhere in positions 1-4 and no eliminated letters.

Looking at remaining letters: B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, U, V, Y plus I and S.

A valid word is ""VISID"" – but that's not a word.  
Another approach: think of common 5-letter words ending in S with I and no A,R,O,E,T,N,G,W,P.

Examples:
- ""DISKS"" – D, I, S, K, S → but S is already in position 5 and we have another S, but we only know one S is correct in position 5.  
- ""FISTS"" – but T is eliminated.  
- ""MISOS"" – O is eliminated.  
- ""LIVID"" – but ends in D, not S.  
- ""KISMS"" – invalid.  
- ""CIVIS"" – valid, but V is allowed. C, I, V, I, S → but has two I's, and we only know one I is required.  

Actually, ""CIVIS"" is a valid word meaning citizen, and it fits:
- Ends in S (position 5 ✓)
- Contains I (positions 2 and 4, but we know I is in word, position 2 was marked (-) so I must be elsewhere, but it's allowed to appear again)
- Uses C, V (both not eliminated)

But since we only know one I is required, maybe a word with only one I is better.  

Another candidate: ""FIVIS"" – but F, I, V, I, S – again two I's.

Looking for single I: ""DILIS"" – invalid.  
""BIVIS"" – invalid.  

Wait, let's think of ""VISID"" – no.  

Actually, ""CIVIS"" seems the closest valid word fitting the constraints, even with two I's.  

But let's try ""KISMS"" – invalid.  

Another valid word: ""LIVID"" – ends in D, not S.  

Hmm, maybe ""FIVID"" – invalid.  

Wait, ""MISID"" – invalid.  

Actually, ""CIVIS"" is the only valid word I can find fitting _ _ _ _ S with I and no eliminated letters.  

So I'll go with CIVIS.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This combination gives us maximum information about the presence of these letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we now know:
- The word contains the letter S, but not in position 4.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, O, or E.

We want a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S somewhere other than position 4.
2. Avoids A, R, O, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

A balanced starting word could be ""STING"":
- S is in position 1 (different from position 4 in AROSE).
- T, I, N, G are all new letters we haven't tested yet.
- It has one vowel (I) and four consonants, giving us good coverage.

Guess 2: STING -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(✓) N(x) G(x)

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
Guess 2: STING → S(-) T(x) I(✓) N(x) G(x)

Key deductions so far:
1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, N, G.  
2. S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4.  
3. I is in the word and is in the correct position (position 3).

So the secret word looks like: _ _ I _ _  
and must contain S somewhere in positions 2 or 5 (since 1 and 4 are ruled out).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 3.  
- Contains S in position 2 or 5.  
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus S and I.

A good candidate is “BISCU” – but wait, that’s not a valid English word.  
Another candidate: “DISKS” – invalid (S in position 5 is allowed, but double S may not help).  
“FISTS” – valid word, uses S in position 5 and has I in position 3.  
“MISOS” – invalid (O already ruled out).  
“WISPS” – valid, S in position 5, I in position 3, and uses P (new letter).

Between “FISTS” and “WISPS”, both fit. “FISTS” tests F, S, T (but T is already ruled out), so actually “WISPS” is better as it introduces W and P.

So the next guess: WISPS.

Check:
- W, P are new letters.  
- S is in position 5 (allowed).  
- I is in position 3 (matches ✓).  
- No A, R, O, E, T, N, G appear.

Let's consolidate what we now know after four guesses.

Eliminated letters (x):  
A, R, O, E, T, N, G, W, P, C, V

Confirmed letters and positions:  
- S is in position 5 (✓)  
- I is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 4 (from WISPS and CIVIS feedback)

So the word structure is: _ _ _ _ S  
and must contain I in position 1 or 3.

Remaining available letters:  
B, D, F, H, K, L, M, U, Y, plus I and S.

We need a 5-letter word ending in S, with I in position 1 or 3, using only the remaining letters.

Possible patterns:
1. I _ _ _ S
2. _ _ I _ S

Looking at pattern 1 (I _ _ _ S):
- I B _ _ S → IBESS (invalid), IBEYS (invalid)
- I D _ _ S → IDISS (invalid), IDYLS (valid word)
- I F _ _ S → IFISS (invalid)
- I H _ _ S → IHASS (invalid)
- I K _ _ S → IKISS (invalid)
- I L _ _ S → ILISS (invalid)
- I M _ _ S → IMISS (invalid)
- I U _ _ S → IUDDS (invalid)

Looking at pattern 2 (_ _ I _ S):
- B _ I _ S → B I _ _ S → BI... but I is in position 2 which is forbidden.
- D _ I _ S → D I _ _ S → DI... again I in position 2 forbidden.

- L _ I _ S → L I _ _ S → LI... forbidden.
- M _ I _ S → M I _ _ S → MI... forbidden.
- U _ I _ S → U I _ _ S → UI... forbidden.

Thus, pattern 1 (I _ _ _ S) is the only viable path.

From pattern 1, the only valid word fitting is IDYLS (I-D-Y-L-S), which uses:
- I in position 1 (allowed)
- D, Y, L from remaining letters
- Ends in S (position 5 ✓)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This combination gives us maximum information about the presence of these letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we now know:
- The word contains the letter S, but not in position 4.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, O, or E.

We want a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S somewhere other than position 4.
2. Avoids A, R, O, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

A balanced starting word could be ""STING"":
- S is in position 1 (different from position 4 in AROSE).
- T, I, N, G are all new letters we haven't tested yet.
- It has one vowel (I) and four consonants, giving us good coverage.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STING -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(✓) N(x) G(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
Guess 2: STING → S(-) T(x) I(✓) N(x) G(x)

Key deductions so far:
1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, N, G.  
2. S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4.  
3. I is in the word and is in the correct position (position 3).

So the secret word looks like: _ _ I _ _  
and must contain S somewhere in positions 2 or 5 (since 1 and 4 are ruled out).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 3.  
- Contains S in position 2 or 5.  
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus S and I.

A good candidate is “BISCU” – but wait, that’s not a valid English word.  
Another candidate: “DISKS” – invalid (S in position 5 is allowed, but double S may not help).  
“FISTS” – valid word, uses S in position 5 and has I in position 3.  
“MISOS” – invalid (O already ruled out).  
“WISPS” – valid, S in position 5, I in position 3, and uses P (new letter).

Between “FISTS” and “WISPS”, both fit. “FISTS” tests F, S, T (but T is already ruled out), so actually “WISPS” is better as it introduces W and P.

So the next guess: WISPS.

Check:
- W, P are new letters.  
- S is in position 5 (allowed).  
- I is in position 3 (matches ✓).  
- No A, R, O, E, T, N, G appear.

Let's carefully update what we now know after the three guesses.

Previous eliminations (letters NOT in the word):
A, R, O, E, T, N, G, W, P

Confirmed letters:
- I is in the word, but NOT in position 2 (from WISPS feedback: I(-))  
- S is in the word, and now we also know it is in the correct position 5 (from WISPS feedback: S(✓))

So the word structure is: _ _ _ _ S
and it must contain I somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since I is not in position 2).

We have tried:
- AROSE: A,R,O,E,S
- STING: S,T,I,N,G
- WISPS: W,I,S,P,S

Remaining unused common letters: B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, U, V, Y

We need a 5-letter word ending in S, containing I, and using only the remaining letters.

Possible candidates:
- B I _ _ S → BIVUS (invalid), BILBS (invalid), BIKIS (invalid)
- C I _ _ S → CIVIS (valid), but V is allowed
- D I _ _ S → DILIS (invalid), DIMIS (invalid)
- F I _ _ S → FIVIS (invalid)
- H I _ _ S → HILIS (invalid)
- K I _ _ S → KILIS (invalid)
- L I _ _ S → LIVIS (invalid)
- M I _ _ S → MIVIS (invalid)
- U I _ _ S → UIVIS (invalid)

Wait, let's think differently: the word must be _ _ _ _ S with I somewhere in positions 1-4 and no eliminated letters.

Looking at remaining letters: B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, U, V, Y plus I and S.

A valid word is ""VISID"" – but that's not a word.  
Another approach: think of common 5-letter words ending in S with I and no A,R,O,E,T,N,G,W,P.

Examples:
- ""DISKS"" – D, I, S, K, S → but S is already in position 5 and we have another S, but we only know one S is correct in position 5.  
- ""FISTS"" – but T is eliminated.  
- ""MISOS"" – O is eliminated.  
- ""LIVID"" – but ends in D, not S.  
- ""KISMS"" – invalid.  
- ""CIVIS"" – valid, but V is allowed. C, I, V, I, S → but has two I's, and we only know one I is required.  

Actually, ""CIVIS"" is a valid word meaning citizen, and it fits:
- Ends in S (position 5 ✓)
- Contains I (positions 2 and 4, but we know I is in word, position 2 was marked (-) so I must be elsewhere, but it's allowed to appear again)
- Uses C, V (both not eliminated)

But since we only know one I is required, maybe a word with only one I is better.  

Another candidate: ""FIVIS"" – but F, I, V, I, S – again two I's.

Looking for single I: ""DILIS"" – invalid.  
""BIVIS"" – invalid.  

Wait, let's think of ""VISID"" – no.  

Actually, ""CIVIS"" seems the closest valid word fitting the constraints, even with two I's.  

But let's try ""KISMS"" – invalid.  

Another valid word: ""LIVID"" – ends in D, not S.  

Hmm, maybe ""FIVID"" – invalid.  

Wait, ""MISID"" – invalid.  

Actually, ""CIVIS"" is the only valid word I can find fitting _ _ _ _ S with I and no eliminated letters.  

So I'll go with CIVIS.

Let's update everything we now know after five guesses.

Eliminated letters (x):  
A, R, O, E, T, N, G, W, P, C, V, D, Y

Confirmed letters and positions:  
- S is in position 5 (✓)  
- L is in position 4 (✓)  
- I is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 4 (from WISPS, CIVIS, IDYLS feedback)

So the word structure is: _ _ _ L S  
and must contain I in position 3 (since positions 1,2,4 are forbidden for I).

Therefore the word must be: _ _ I L S

Remaining available letters (not yet eliminated):  
B, F, H, K, M, U

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ _ I L S using only these letters.

Possible combinations:
- B _ I L S → B I L L S (invalid, double L), B U I L S (invalid)
- F _ I L S → F U I L S (invalid)
- H _ I L S → H U I L S (invalid)
- K _ I L S → K U I L S (invalid)
- M _ I L S → M U I L S (invalid)

Looking for valid English words of the form _ _ I L S with remaining letters:
- B I L L S – invalid (double L and L already used in position 4)
- B U I L S – invalid
- F U I L S – invalid
- H U I L S – invalid
- K U I L S – invalid
- M U I L S – invalid

Wait, let's list all valid 5-letter words ending in ""ILS"":
- BILLS – but has double L and L already in position 4
- BUILD – ends in D (eliminated)
- FISTS – T eliminated
- MISTS – T eliminated
- SAILS – A eliminated
- WAIST – A, T eliminated
- BAILS – A eliminated
- MAULS – ends in S, but structure _ _ U L S – let's check:
  - MAULS: M, A, U, L, S – A eliminated
- FAULT – ends in T
- HAULS – ends in S, but structure H A U L S – A eliminated
- KAZOO – irrelevant
- BULKS – ends in S, structure B U L K S – but we need _ _ I L S

Actually, the only valid word fitting _ _ I L S with remaining letters is BILLS, but it has double L. However, the feedback only tells us L is in position 4, not that it can't appear elsewhere. So BILLS is possible.

But let's check if BILLS uses any eliminated letters:
- B, I, L, L, S – L is allowed in position 4, but another L in position 3 is fine unless feedback says otherwise. The feedback for IDYLS only confirmed L in position 4, not that L can't appear elsewhere.

But we have no evidence against another L. However, we have limited letters left: B, F, H, K, M, U.

Looking again, the only valid word is BILLS.

But let's see if there are others:
- BILLS – valid
- FISTS – T eliminated
- MISTS – T eliminated
- SAILS – A eliminated
- BAILS – A eliminated
- HAULS – A eliminated
- BULKS – ends in S, structure B U L K S – but needs _ _ I L S

Actually, the only valid word fitting _ _ I L S is BILLS.

But let's check if BILLS uses any eliminated letters:
- B – allowed
- I – allowed (confirmed in word)
- L – allowed (confirmed in position 4)
- L – allowed (no restriction)
- S – allowed (confirmed in position 5)

Thus, BILLS seems to fit all constraints.

But wait, let's check if BILLS is valid:
- BILLS – yes, it's a valid English word meaning plural of bill.

So the next guess is BILLS.
