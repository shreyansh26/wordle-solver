For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use these letters without repeating any. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""RAISE,"" or ""AROSE."" 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes A, R, O, S, E - five very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on AROSE:

Next option: ""STORE"" - but E is out. ""STORY"" - Y is less common. ""SWORD"" - D is okay. ""SPOOR"" - double O is unlikely. ""SPORT"" - T is common.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

1. The word pattern is _ R O _ _ (R and O are locked in positions 2 and 3).
2. S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 4, or 5 (it was wrong in positions 1 and 4).  
   Therefore S must be in position 3, but position 3 is already O.  
   This is impossible, which means our assumption that S is in the word is wrong.

Wait, let's re-read the feedback carefully:

- Guess 1 (AROSE):  
  A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(x)  
  → R is correct in position 2, O is correct in position 3, S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

- Guess 2 (SPORT):  
  S(-) P(x) O(✓) R(-) T(-)  
  → O is correct in position 3, R is in the word but NOT in position 4, S is in the word but NOT in position 1.

Combining these:
- R is correct in position 2.
- O is correct in position 3.
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4 → must be in position 5.
- Therefore the pattern is: _ R O _ S

Letters ruled out so far: A, E, P, T.

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 4, avoiding A, E, P, T.  
Common remaining consonants: N, L, C, D, M, etc.

A good candidate is ""NORTH"":
- N in position 1, R in 2, O in 3, T in 4, H in 5.
But T was already tested in SPORT and marked (-), so T is in the word but not in position 4.  
So T could still be in position 5, but position 5 is already S.  
Thus T cannot be in the word.  

Next candidate: ""CROFS"" – but F is uncommon.  
""FOROS"" – double O is unlikely.  
""FROND"" – 6 letters.  
""CRONY"" – Y is uncommon.  
""BRONS"" – B is possible, but S is already in 5.  
""GRONE"" – E is out.  

Best simple word fitting _ R O _ S: ""NORTH"" fails (T out).  
Next: ""CROCS"" – but C is repeated.  
""FRONS"" – F uncommon.  
""DRONE"" – E out.  

Let's try ""NORTH"" again but note T is excluded.  
Actually, ""NORTH"" is invalid because T was marked (-) in SPORT (position 4), so T cannot be in the word.  

We need a word like _ R O _ S without T, P, A, E.  
""BRONS"" – B, R, O, N, S.  
""B"" is allowed, N is allowed, S is allowed.  
""BRONS"" is a valid 5-letter word (variant spelling of ""brone"" or ""brawn"").

But let's check: B, R, O, N, S.  
- B: new letter  
- R: correct position 2  
- O: correct position 3  
- N: new letter  
- S: must be in position 5 (only remaining spot for S)  

This fits all constraints.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C.

2. S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 4, or 5 (it was wrong in positions 1 and 4).  
   Therefore S must be in position 3, but position 3 is already O.  
   This is impossible, which means our assumption that S is in the word is wrong.

Wait, let's re-read the feedback carefully:

- Guess 1 (AROSE):  
  A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(x)  
  → R is correct in position 2, O is correct in position 3, S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

- Guess 2 (SPORT):  
  S(-) P(x) O(✓) R(-) T(-)  
  → O is correct in position 3, R is in the word but NOT in position 4, S is in the word but NOT in position 1.

Combining these:
- R is correct in position 2.
- O is correct in position 3.
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4 → must be in position 5.
- Therefore the pattern is: _ R O _ S

Letters ruled out so far: A, E, P, T.

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 4, avoiding A, E, P, T.  
Common remaining consonants: N, L, C, D, M, etc.

A good candidate is ""NORTH"":
- N in position 1, R in 2, O in 3, T in 4, H in 5.
But T was already tested in SPORT and marked (-), so T is in the word but not in position 4.  
So T could still be in position 5, but position 5 is already S.  
Thus T cannot be in the word.  

Next candidate: ""CROFS"" – but F is uncommon.  
""FOROS"" – double O is unlikely.  
""FROND"" – 6 letters.  
""CRONY"" – Y is uncommon.  
""BRONS"" – B is possible, but S is already in 5.  
""GRONE"" – E is out.  

Best simple word fitting _ R O _ S: ""NORTH"" fails (T out).  
Next: ""CROCS"" – but C is repeated.  
""FRONS"" – F uncommon.  
""DRONE"" – E out.  

Let's try ""NORTH"" again but note T is excluded.  
Actually, ""NORTH"" is invalid because T was marked (-) in SPORT (position 4), so T cannot be in the word.  

We need a word like _ R O _ S without T, P, A, E.  
""BRONS"" – B, R, O, N, S.  
""B"" is allowed, N is allowed, S is allowed.  
""BRONS"" is a valid 5-letter word (variant spelling of ""brone"" or ""brawn"").

But let's check: B, R, O, N, S.  
- B: new letter  
- R: correct position 2  
- O: correct position 3  
- N: new letter  
- S: must be in position 5 (only remaining spot for S)  

This fits all constraints.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use these letters without repeating any. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""RAISE,"" or ""AROSE."" 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes A, R, O, S, E - five very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).
- O is in the word and in the correct position (third letter).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so it must be in positions 1, 4, or 5).
- A and E are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is:
_ R O _ _

We know S must appear somewhere in the word, and it cannot be in position 4 (since that was its position in AROSE and it's marked as wrong position). Therefore S must be in position 1 or 5.

Let's try a word that keeps R and O fixed, places S in position 1, and fills the remaining spots with common letters. A good candidate is ""SROCK"" (though not super common). Instead, let's try ""SCORE"" - it keeps R and O, puts S in position 1, and introduces C and E. However, E was already ruled out, so that's no good.

Next option: ""STORE"" - but E is out. ""STORY"" - Y is less common. ""SWORD"" - D is okay. ""SPOOR"" - double O is unlikely. ""SPORT"" - T is common.

""SPORT"" fits:
- S in position 1 (allowed)
- R in position 2 (correct)
- O in position 3 (correct)
- P and T are new common letters

2. S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 4, or 5 (it was wrong in positions 1 and 4).  
   Therefore S must be in position 3, but position 3 is already O.  
   This is impossible, which means our assumption that S is in the word is wrong.

Wait, let's re-read the feedback carefully:

  S(-) P(x) O(✓) R(-) T(-)  
  → O is correct in position 3, R is in the word but NOT in position 4, S is in the word but NOT in position 1.

Combining these:
- R is correct in position 2.
- O is correct in position 3.
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4 → must be in position 5.
- Therefore the pattern is: _ R O _ S

Letters ruled out so far: A, E, P, T.

- N in position 1, R in 2, O in 3, T in 4, H in 5.
But T was already tested in SPORT and marked (-), so T is in the word but not in position 4.  
So T could still be in position 5, but position 5 is already S.  
Thus T cannot be in the word.  

Next candidate: ""CROFS"" – but F is uncommon.  
""FOROS"" – double O is unlikely.  
""FROND"" – 6 letters.  
""CRONY"" – Y is uncommon.  
""BRONS"" – B is possible, but S is already in 5.  
""GRONE"" – E is out.  

Best simple word fitting _ R O _ S: ""NORTH"" fails (T out).  
Next: ""CROCS"" – but C is repeated.  
""FRONS"" – F uncommon.  
""DRONE"" – E out.  

Let's try ""NORTH"" again but note T is excluded.  
Actually, ""NORTH"" is invalid because T was marked (-) in SPORT (position 4), so T cannot be in the word.  

We need a word like _ R O _ S without T, P, A, E.  
""BRONS"" – B, R, O, N, S.  
""B"" is allowed, N is allowed, S is allowed.  
""BRONS"" is a valid 5-letter word (variant spelling of ""brone"" or ""brawn"").

But let's check: B, R, O, N, S.  
- B: new letter  
- R: correct position 2  
- O: correct position 3

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use these letters without repeating any. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""RAISE,"" or ""AROSE."" 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes A, R, O, S, E - five very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities quickly.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).
- O is in the word and in the correct position (third letter).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so it must be in positions 1, 4, or 5).
- A and E are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is:
_ R O _ _

We know S must appear somewhere in the word, and it cannot be in position 4 (since that was its position in AROSE and it's marked as wrong position). Therefore S must be in position 1 or 5.

Let's try a word that keeps R and O fixed, places S in position 1, and fills the remaining spots with common letters. A good candidate is ""SROCK"" (though not super common). Instead, let's try ""SCORE"" - it keeps R and O, puts S in position 1, and introduces C and E. However, E was already ruled out, so that's no good.

Next option: ""STORE"" - but E is out. ""STORY"" - Y is less common. ""SWORD"" - D is okay. ""SPOOR"" - double O is unlikely. ""SPORT"" - T is common.

""SPORT"" fits:
- S in position 1 (allowed)
- R in position 2 (correct)
- O in position 3 (correct)
- P and T are new common letters

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SPORT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) O(✓) R(-) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two previous guesses we now know:

1. The word pattern is _ R O _ _ (R and O are locked in positions 2 and 3).
2. S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 4, or 5 (it was wrong in positions 1 and 4).  
   Therefore S must be in position 3, but position 3 is already O.  
   This is impossible, which means our assumption that S is in the word is wrong.

Wait, let's re-read the feedback carefully:

- Guess 1 (AROSE):  
  A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(x)  
  → R is correct in position 2, O is correct in position 3, S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

- Guess 2 (SPORT):  
  S(-) P(x) O(✓) R(-) T(-)  
  → O is correct in position 3, R is in the word but NOT in position 4, S is in the word but NOT in position 1.

Combining these:
- R is correct in position 2.
- O is correct in position 3.
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4 → must be in position 5.
- Therefore the pattern is: _ R O _ S

Letters ruled out so far: A, E, P, T.

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 4, avoiding A, E, P, T.  
Common remaining consonants: N, L, C, D, M, etc.

A good candidate is ""NORTH"":
- N in position 1, R in 2, O in 3, T in 4, H in 5.
But T was already tested in SPORT and marked (-), so T is in the word but not in position 4.  
So T could still be in position 5, but position 5 is already S.  
Thus T cannot be in the word.  

Next candidate: ""CROFS"" – but F is uncommon.  
""FOROS"" – double O is unlikely.  
""FROND"" – 6 letters.  
""CRONY"" – Y is uncommon.  
""BRONS"" – B is possible, but S is already in 5.  
""GRONE"" – E is out.  

Best simple word fitting _ R O _ S: ""NORTH"" fails (T out).  
Next: ""CROCS"" – but C is repeated.  
""FRONS"" – F uncommon.  
""DRONE"" – E out.  

Let's try ""NORTH"" again but note T is excluded.  
Actually, ""NORTH"" is invalid because T was marked (-) in SPORT (position 4), so T cannot be in the word.  

We need a word like _ R O _ S without T, P, A, E.  
""BRONS"" – B, R, O, N, S.  
""B"" is allowed, N is allowed, S is allowed.  
""BRONS"" is a valid 5-letter word (variant spelling of ""brone"" or ""brawn"").

But let's check: B, R, O, N, S.  
- B: new letter  
- R: correct position 2  
- O: correct position 3  
- N: new letter  
- S: must be in position 5 (only remaining spot for S)  

This fits all constraints.

Guess 3: BRONS -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) O(✓) N(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
   - R is correct in position 2.
   - O is correct in position 3.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

2. SPORT → S(-) P(x) O(✓) R(-) T(-)
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - T is in the word but NOT in position 5.

3. BRONS → B(x) R(✓) O(✓) N(x) S(✓)
   - S is now confirmed in position 5.

Combining all:
- Pattern: _ R O _ S
- S must be in position 5 (confirmed by BRONS).
- T was marked (-) in position 5 (SPORT), so T cannot be in position 5.  
  Since S is already in position 5, T must be in position 4 (only remaining spot for T).
- Therefore the pattern is: _ R O T S

Letters ruled out: A, B, E, N, P.

We need a letter for position 1 that is not A, B, E, N, P, T, R, O, S.  
Common remaining letters: C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y.

Looking for common 5-letter words ending in OROTS? No.  
Actually, the pattern is _ R O T S.

Possible words:
- CROTS – not a valid word.
- DROTS – not valid.
- FROTS – not valid.
- GROTS – valid (plural of grot).
- PROTS – P is ruled out.
- TROTS – T is ruled out for position 1.

Check:
- G: new letter (allowed)
- R: correct position 2
- O: correct position 3
- T: must be in position 4 (fits T being in word but not 5)

From the feedback on TROYS:
- T is in the word and in the correct position 1.
- R is correct in position 2.
- O is correct in position 3.
- Y is NOT in the word.
- S is correct in position 5.

So the pattern is now completely determined: T R O _ S.

Letters already ruled out: A, B, E, G, N, P, Y.

We need a single letter for position 4 that is not any of those and is common.  
Remaining common letters: C, D, F, H, I, K, L, M, U, V, W.

- TROWS – valid word (plural of trow, though rare; also used as ""trows"" in some contexts).

Looking at the remaining letters, ""C"" is a common consonant not yet used.  
Check if ""TROCS"" is valid – no, it's not.  
""TRORS"" – invalid (double R).  
""TRONS"" – N is ruled out.  
""TROPS"" – P is ruled out.  
""TROTS"" – T is already in position 1.  
""TROUS"" – U is allowed, but ""TROUS"" is not a valid word.

Wait, let's list valid English words matching TRO_S:

- TROOP – P is ruled out.
- TROOP – already P is out.
- TRODS – not valid.
- TROCK – not valid.
- TROCK – not valid.
- TROCK – not valid.

Actually, the only valid word is ""TROOP"" but P is ruled out.

""TROWS"" is valid (plural of trow, a type of axe).  
Letters: T, R, O, W, S.  
W has not been ruled out yet.

So ""TROWS"" fits perfectly.
