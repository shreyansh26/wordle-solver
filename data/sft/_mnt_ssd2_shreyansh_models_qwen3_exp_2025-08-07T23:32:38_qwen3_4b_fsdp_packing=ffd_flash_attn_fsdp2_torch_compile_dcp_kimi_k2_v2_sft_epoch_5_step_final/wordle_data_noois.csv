For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these common letters to help identify which letters are in the secret word.

Popular strategic starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (contains A, U, D, I, O)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it's a strong starting word with common letters and good positional coverage.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it’s not in position 1).
- L, A, T, E are NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains S, but not in position 1.
- The word does NOT contain L, A, T, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has S somewhere other than the first position.
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.

Good consonants to try next: R, N, C, H, M, D, P, B, G, K, etc.
Good vowels to try next: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

A strong second guess that fits these constraints and uses common letters is “SHORN”:
- S is in position 2 (not 1), satisfying the feedback.
- H, O, R, N are all new letters that haven’t been tested yet.
- It avoids L, A, T, E entirely.

This should give us more information about the remaining letters.

Current confirmed facts:

Letters known to be in the word:
- O (position unknown, but not 3)
- N (position unknown, but not 5)
- S (position unknown, but not 1, 2, 5) → so S must be in position 3 or 4

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
L, A, T, E, H, R, P, D

So far the word must contain O, N, S exactly once each, and two other letters from the remaining pool: B, C, F, G, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

From the feedback:
- O is in the word but not in position 3
- N is in the word but not in position 5
- S is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 5 → S must be in position 3 or 4

Let’s list possible positions for S:
Case 1: S in position 3
Then the word looks like: _ _ S _ _
O and N must fit in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5, with N not in 5.
Possible arrangements:
- O _ S N _
- _ O S N _
- O _ S _ N
- _ O S _ N
- N _ S O _
- _ N S O _
- N _ S _ O
- _ N S _ O

Case 2: S in position 4
Then the word looks like: _ _ _ S _
O and N must fit in positions 1, 2, 3, 5, with N not in 5.
Possible arrangements:
- O _ _ S N
- _ O _ S N
- _ _ O S N
- N _ _ S O
- _ N _ S O
- _ _ N S O

Now we need to pick a valid word that fits one of these patterns and uses only allowed letters.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit:
- From Case 1: ""SONIC"" is invalid (S in 1), ""BISON"" invalid (N in 5), ""FONDS"" invalid (D), ""MOSIN"" invalid (I is allowed but N in 5 is invalid). ""COSIN"" is not a word.
- From Case 2: ""OBSYS"" invalid, ""COWNS"" invalid (W not ruled out but S in 4, N in 5 invalid), ""GONOS"" invalid (O in 3), ""MOSIN"" already considered.

Wait, let's think systematically:
We need O, N, S plus two more letters from allowed set.

Let’s try ""COWNS"":
- C, O, W, N, S
- S is in position 4 (allowed)
- O is in position 2 (allowed, not 3)
- N is in position 5 → but N cannot be in 5 (feedback from PONDS: N(-) means N is in word but not in position 5)
So ""COWNS"" is invalid.

Next: ""GONOS"" → O in 3 is invalid.

Next: ""MOSIN"" → N in 5 invalid.

- N, O, S, K, Y
- S is in 3 (allowed)
- O is in 2 (allowed)
- N is in 1 (allowed)
- K and Y are new letters from allowed set
This seems valid.

""NOSKY"" is a valid 5-letter word meaning ""nervous"" in some dialects.

Let’s verify:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these common letters to help identify which letters are in the secret word.

Popular strategic starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (contains A, U, D, I, O)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it's a strong starting word with common letters and good positional coverage.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it’s not in position 1).
- L, A, T, E are NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains S, but not in position 1.
- The word does NOT contain L, A, T, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has S somewhere other than the first position.
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.

Good consonants to try next: R, N, C, H, M, D, P, B, G, K, etc.
Good vowels to try next: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

A strong second guess that fits these constraints and uses common letters is “SHORN”:
- S is in position 2 (not 1), satisfying the feedback.
- H, O, R, N are all new letters that haven’t been tested yet.
- It avoids L, A, T, E entirely.

This should give us more information about the remaining letters.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:  
L, A, T, E, H, R

Letters that ARE in the word (but in unknown positions yet):  
S, O, N

Positions we can rule out for each of those letters:

- S: cannot be in position 1 or 2  
- O: cannot be in position 3  
- N: cannot be in position 5  

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S, O, N exactly once each.
2. Places S in positions 3, 4, or 5.
3. Places O in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.
4. Places N in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.
5. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (so no L, A, T, E, H, R).

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I, U (O is already confirmed).

A good candidate is “SONIC”:
- Letters used: S, O, N, I, C — none of the forbidden letters.
- S is in position 1? No, that’s forbidden.  
So “SONIC” is invalid because S would be in position 1.

Next candidate: “COBNS” — not a valid word.

Next: “SNOWY” — contains W, Y, but S is in position 1 (forbidden).

Next: “BISON” — S is in position 4 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed), N in 5 (forbidden).  
So N in position 5 is invalid.

Next: “PONDS” — S in 5 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed), N in 3 (allowed).  
Check letters: P, O, N, D, S — none forbidden.  
Valid word.

From the new feedback on NOSKY:

- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3, so it must be in 4 or 5).
- K and Y are not in the word at all.

So we now know:

Letters confirmed in the word:
- N in position 1
- O in position 2
- S must be in position 4 or 5

Letters confirmed NOT in the word:
L, A, T, E, H, R, P, D, K, Y

Letters still allowed: B, C, F, G, I, M, U, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with N O
- Contains S in position 4 or 5
- Uses only the remaining allowed letters for the remaining positions

Possible structures:
- N O _ S _
- N O _ _ S

Let's think of common words fitting these patterns.

For N O _ S _:
- NOVUS (but U is allowed, V is allowed) - but this is Latin, might not be valid
- NOBEL (but E is forbidden)
- NOVOS (but O is already used)
- NOVSS (invalid)
- NOSIS (invalid)

For N O _ _ S:
- N O B S _ (but we need 5 letters)
- N O B I S (valid word: NOBIS - but this is archaic)
- N O C I S (invalid)
- N O M I S (invalid)
- N O B I S (same as above)
- N O V I S (valid word: NOVIS - plural of novus in Latin, but may not be accepted)
- N O M I S (invalid)
- N O B S _ (need 5 letters)

Wait, let's think of English words:
- NOVUS is not English
- NOBEL is invalid (E)
- NOVOS is plural of NOVO, but not common
- NOVIA (invalid, A)
- NOVIT (invalid, T)
- NOVUM (invalid, U and M allowed, but T is forbidden)

Actually, let's think of:
- NOBIS (valid in English as ""nobis"" - archaic)
- NOVIS (valid in English as plural of novus)
- NOVUS is not valid
- NOVIA is invalid (A)
- NOVUM is invalid (U and M allowed, but T is forbidden)

But ""NOVIS"" is the plural of novus, meaning ""young men"" in Latin, but accepted in English.

However, let's think of more common words:
- N O B I S (NOBIS)
- N O V I S (NOVIS)

But ""NOBIS"" is more common.

Alternatively, think of:
- N O B S _ (need 5 letters, but S is in 4)
- N O B I S (NOBIS)

Let's check:
- N O B I S: positions N(1) O(2) B(3) I(4) S(5)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these common letters to help identify which letters are in the secret word.

Popular strategic starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (contains A, U, D, I, O)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it's a strong starting word with common letters and good positional coverage.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it’s not in position 1).
- L, A, T, E are NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains S, but not in position 1.
- The word does NOT contain L, A, T, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has S somewhere other than the first position.
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.

Good consonants to try next: R, N, C, H, M, D, P, B, G, K, etc.
Good vowels to try next: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

A strong second guess that fits these constraints and uses common letters is “SHORN”:
- S is in position 2 (not 1), satisfying the feedback.
- H, O, R, N are all new letters that haven’t been tested yet.
- It avoids L, A, T, E entirely.

This should give us more information about the remaining letters.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:  
L, A, T, E, H, R

Letters that ARE in the word (but in unknown positions yet):  
S, O, N

Positions we can rule out for each of those letters:

- S: cannot be in position 1 or 2  
- O: cannot be in position 3  
- N: cannot be in position 5  

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S, O, N exactly once each.
2. Places S in positions 3, 4, or 5.
3. Places O in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.
4. Places N in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.
5. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (so no L, A, T, E, H, R).

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I, U (O is already confirmed).

A good candidate is “SONIC”:
- Letters used: S, O, N, I, C — none of the forbidden letters.
- S is in position 1? No, that’s forbidden.  
So “SONIC” is invalid because S would be in position 1.

Next candidate: “COBNS” — not a valid word.

Next: “SNOWY” — contains W, Y, but S is in position 1 (forbidden).

Next: “BISON” — S is in position 4 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed), N in 5 (forbidden).  
So N in position 5 is invalid.

Next: “PONDS” — S in 5 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed), N in 3 (allowed).  
Check letters: P, O, N, D, S — none forbidden.  
Valid word.

Let’s go with “PONDS”.

Current confirmed facts:

Letters known to be in the word:
- O (position unknown, but not 3)
- N (position unknown, but not 5)
- S (position unknown, but not 1, 2, 5) → so S must be in position 3 or 4

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
L, A, T, E, H, R, P, D

So far the word must contain O, N, S exactly once each, and two other letters from the remaining pool: B, C, F, G, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

From the feedback:
- O is in the word but not in position 3
- N is in the word but not in position 5
- S is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 5 → S must be in position 3 or 4

Let’s list possible positions for S:
Case 1: S in position 3
Then the word looks like: _ _ S _ _
O and N must fit in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5, with N not in 5.
Possible arrangements:
- O _ S N _
- _ O S N _
- O _ S _ N
- _ O S _ N
- N _ S O _
- _ N S O _
- N _ S _ O
- _ N S _ O

Case 2: S in position 4
Then the word looks like: _ _ _ S _
O and N must fit in positions 1, 2, 3, 5, with N not in 5.
Possible arrangements:
- O _ _ S N
- _ O _ S N
- _ _ O S N
- N _ _ S O
- _ N _ S O
- _ _ N S O

Now we need to pick a valid word that fits one of these patterns and uses only allowed letters.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit:
- From Case 1: ""SONIC"" is invalid (S in 1), ""BISON"" invalid (N in 5), ""FONDS"" invalid (D), ""MOSIN"" invalid (I is allowed but N in 5 is invalid). ""COSIN"" is not a word.
- From Case 2: ""OBSYS"" invalid, ""COWNS"" invalid (W not ruled out but S in 4, N in 5 invalid), ""GONOS"" invalid (O in 3), ""MOSIN"" already considered.

Wait, let's think systematically:
We need O, N, S plus two more letters from allowed set.

Let’s try ""COWNS"":
- C, O, W, N, S
- S is in position 4 (allowed)
- O is in position 2 (allowed, not 3)
- N is in position 5 → but N cannot be in 5 (feedback from PONDS: N(-) means N is in word but not in position 5)
So ""COWNS"" is invalid.

Next: ""GONOS"" → O in 3 is invalid.

Next: ""MOSIN"" → N in 5 invalid.

Next: ""VOCAN"" → invalid (not a word).

Next: ""BONUS"" → S in 5 is invalid (S must be 3 or 4).

Next: ""CONUS"" → S in 5 invalid.

Next: ""SONIC"" already invalid.

Next: ""BISON"" already invalid.

Next: ""FISON"" → not a word.

Next: ""GISON"" → not a word.

Next: ""MISON"" → not a word.

Next: ""WISON"" → not a word.

Next: ""CYSNO"" → not a word.

Let’s try ""NOSKY"":
- N, O, S, K, Y
- S is in 3 (allowed)
- O is in 2 (allowed)
- N is in 1 (allowed)
- K and Y are new letters from allowed set
This seems valid.

""NOSKY"" is a valid 5-letter word meaning ""nervous"" in some dialects.

Let’s verify:
- Contains O, N, S exactly once each
- S is in position 3 (allowed)
- O is in position 2 (allowed, not 3)
- N is in position 1 (allowed, not 5)
- No forbidden letters (L, A, T, E, H, R, P, D)
- Uses only allowed letters: N, O, S, K, Y

This fits all constraints.

From the new feedback on NOSKY:

- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3, so it must be in 4 or 5).
- K and Y are not in the word at all.

So we now know:

Letters confirmed in the word:
- N in position 1
- O in position 2
- S must be in position 4 or 5

Letters confirmed NOT in the word:
L, A, T, E, H, R, P, D, K, Y

Letters still allowed: B, C, F, G, I, M, U, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with N O
- Contains S in position 4 or 5
- Uses only the remaining allowed letters for the remaining positions

Possible structures:
- N O _ S _
- N O _ _ S

Let's think of common words fitting these patterns.

For N O _ S _:
- NOVUS (but U is allowed, V is allowed) - but this is Latin, might not be valid
- NOBEL (but E is forbidden)
- NOVOS (but O is already used)
- NOVSS (invalid)
- NOSIS (invalid)

For N O _ _ S:
- N O B S _ (but we need 5 letters)
- N O B I S (valid word: NOBIS - but this is archaic)
- N O C I S (invalid)
- N O M I S (invalid)
- N O B I S (same as above)
- N O V I S (valid word: NOVIS - plural of novus in Latin, but may not be accepted)
- N O M I S (invalid)
- N O B S _ (need 5 letters)

Wait, let's think of English words:
- NOVUS is not English
- NOBEL is invalid (E)
- NOVOS is plural of NOVO, but not common
- NOVIA (invalid, A)
- NOVIT (invalid, T)
- NOVUM (invalid, U and M allowed, but T is forbidden)

Actually, let's think of:
- NOBIS (valid in English as ""nobis"" - archaic)
- NOVIS (valid in English as plural of novus)
- NOVUS is not valid
- NOVIA is invalid (A)
- NOVUM is invalid (U and M allowed, but T is forbidden)

But ""NOVIS"" is the plural of novus, meaning ""young men"" in Latin, but accepted in English.

However, let's think of more common words:
- N O B I S (NOBIS)
- N O V I S (NOVIS)

But ""NOBIS"" is more common.

Alternatively, think of:
- N O B S _ (need 5 letters, but S is in 4)
- N O B I S (NOBIS)

Let's check:
- N O B I S: positions N(1) O(2) B(3) I(4) S(5)
- S is in position 5 (allowed)
- B and I are new allowed letters
- No forbidden letters

This seems valid.

From the feedback on NOBIS:
- N is in position 1 (✓)
- O is in position 2 (✓)

- I is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

This means:
- N is correct in position 1
- O is correct in position 2
- B is not in the word
- I is in the word but not in position 4
- S is in the word but not in position 5

But earlier feedback already told us:
- S must be in position 4 or 5 (from Guess 4 NOSKY feedback: S was in position 3, so must be 4 or 5)
- From Guess 5 NOBIS feedback: S is in the word but not in position 5, so S must be in position 4

Also, I is in the word but not in position 4, so I must be in position 3 or 5.

So the word structure is:
N O _ _ _
with S in position 4 and I in position 3 or 5.

But position 5 is the only remaining position for I if S is in 4.

So the word must be:
N O I S _

But we need a 5-letter word starting with NOI S and ending with one more letter.

Looking at allowed letters (not including forbidden ones: L, A, T, E, H, R, P, D, K, Y, B), remaining common letters: C, F, G, M, U, V, W, etc.

Possible words:
- NOISY (but Y is forbidden)
- NOISE (E is forbidden)
- NOISM (valid word: NOISM - referring to noisiness)
- NOIST (T is forbidden)
- NOISY (invalid)
- NOISM seems the only valid option.
