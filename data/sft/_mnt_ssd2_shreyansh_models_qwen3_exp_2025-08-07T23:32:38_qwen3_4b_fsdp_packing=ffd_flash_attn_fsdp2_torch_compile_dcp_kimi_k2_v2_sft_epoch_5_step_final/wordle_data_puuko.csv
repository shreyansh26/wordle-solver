For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps maximize the chance of hitting some letters in the secret word.

Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A word like ""AROSE"" uses five very common letters and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants. Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" which also uses common letters. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the vowels A, O, E and the common consonants R, S, L. This should give me good information about which letters are present in the secret word.

- Letter in the word but not in position 3: O (so O must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels. The remaining common letters are T, L, N, I, C, D, U, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Include O in a different position (to confirm where it belongs).
2. Introduce as many new common letters as possible.
3. Avoid A, R, S, E.

One strong candidate is “POINT”:
- P, I, N, T are all common letters not yet tested.
- O is moved to position 2.
- This tests 5 new letters and repositions O.

Another candidate is “CLOUD”:
- C, L, U, D are new letters.
- O is in position 2.

   – O is still in the word but NOT in position 2 (and we already knew it wasn’t in 3).  
   – Letters ruled out: I, N, T (in addition to A, R, S, E).

So far we know:
- Word starts with P.
- Contains O, but O cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
- Cannot contain: A, R, S, E, I, N, T.

Remaining common letters not yet tested: L, U, C, D, Y, M, B, G, H, K, F, W, V, Z, X, Q, J.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with P.
- Has O in position 4 or 5.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Candidate words:
- PLOWY – but W and Y are less common, and we’d like to test more frequent letters.
- POUCH – but H and C are okay, but U is vowel and C is consonant.
- PULPY – but Y is okay, but P is repeated.
- PLOUM – not a valid English word.
- PLODY – not valid.
- PLOOM – not valid.
- PLOMP – not valid.
- PLOPY – not valid.

Better: PLOUGH – but G and H are okay, but O is in position 2 here, which we know is wrong.

Wait, O must be in position 4 or 5.

Let’s try PLOOM – invalid.

How about PLOPY – invalid.

Valid words:

Let me think differently. We have P _ _ _ _ and O must be in position 4 or 5.

Possible structures:
- P _ _ O _
- P _ _ _ O

Looking for valid words:
- PUDGY – but D and G are okay, Y is okay, but U is vowel, D is consonant, G is consonant, Y is vowel.
- PUDGY: P(✓), U, D, G, Y – none of these letters are ruled out except T, N, I, etc. This seems valid.

Another: PUMBO – but M, B, O are okay, but O is in position 4 here, which is allowed.

But PUMBO is not a common word.

P _ _ O _: P U D O _ – invalid.

P _ _ O _: P U L O _ – invalid.

P _ _ O _: P U C O _ – invalid.

Another candidate: PULPY – but P is repeated and Y is okay.

But PULPY: P(✓), U, L, P, Y – P is repeated, which is allowed, but we’d rather test new letters.

Let me try PUDGY: P, U, D, G, Y – all new letters except P which is fixed in position.

This seems like the best option given the constraints.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps maximize the chance of hitting some letters in the secret word.

Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A word like ""AROSE"" uses five very common letters and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants. Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" which also uses common letters. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the vowels A, O, E and the common consonants R, S, L. This should give me good information about which letters are present in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we now know:
- Letters not in the word: A, R, S, E.
- Letter in the word but not in position 3: O (so O must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels. The remaining common letters are T, L, N, I, C, D, U, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Include O in a different position (to confirm where it belongs).
2. Introduce as many new common letters as possible.
3. Avoid A, R, S, E.

One strong candidate is “POINT”:
- P, I, N, T are all common letters not yet tested.
- O is moved to position 2.
- This tests 5 new letters and repositions O.

Another candidate is “CLOUD”:
- C, L, U, D are new letters.
- O is in position 2.

I’ll go with “POINT” as it tests P, I, N, T and repositions O.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   – Letters ruled out: A, R, S, E  
   – O is in the word but NOT in position 3.

2. POINT → P(✓) O(-) I(x) N(x) T(x)  
   – P is in the word AND in the correct position (position 1).  
   – O is still in the word but NOT in position 2 (and we already knew it wasn’t in 3).  
   – Letters ruled out: I, N, T (in addition to A, R, S, E).

So far we know:
- Word starts with P.
- Contains O, but O cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
- Cannot contain: A, R, S, E, I, N, T.

Remaining common letters not yet tested: L, U, C, D, Y, M, B, G, H, K, F, W, V, Z, X, Q, J.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with P.
- Has O in position 4 or 5.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Candidate words:
- PLOWY – but W and Y are less common, and we’d like to test more frequent letters.
- POUCH – but H and C are okay, but U is vowel and C is consonant.
- PULPY – but Y is okay, but P is repeated.
- PLOUM – not a valid English word.
- PLODY – not valid.
- PLOOM – not valid.
- PLOMP – not valid.
- PLOPY – not valid.

Better: PLOUGH – but G and H are okay, but O is in position 2 here, which we know is wrong.

Wait, O must be in position 4 or 5.

Let’s try PLOOM – invalid.

How about PLOPY – invalid.

Another approach: look for P _ _ O _ or P _ _ _ O.

Valid words:
- PLOOM – invalid.
- PLOPY – invalid.
- PLOUT – T is ruled out.
- PLOMP – invalid.
- PLOOM – invalid.

Let me think differently. We have P _ _ _ _ and O must be in position 4 or 5.

Possible structures:
- P _ _ O _
- P _ _ _ O

Looking for valid words:
- PUDGY – but D and G are okay, Y is okay, but U is vowel, D is consonant, G is consonant, Y is vowel.
- PUDGY: P(✓), U, D, G, Y – none of these letters are ruled out except T, N, I, etc. This seems valid.

Another: PUMBO – but M, B, O are okay, but O is in position 4 here, which is allowed.

But PUMBO is not a common word.

How about PUDGY? It’s a valid word.

But let me think of more common words.

P _ _ _ O: P U D G O – invalid.

P _ _ O _: P U D O _ – invalid.

P _ _ O _: P U L O _ – invalid.

P _ _ O _: P U C O _ – invalid.

P _ _ O _: P U L O _ – invalid.

Another candidate: PULPY – but P is repeated and Y is okay.

But PULPY: P(✓), U, L, P, Y – P is repeated, which is allowed, but we’d rather test new letters.

Let me try PUDGY: P, U, D, G, Y – all new letters except P which is fixed in position.

This seems like the best option given the constraints.Based on the feedback:
- Word starts with P (position 1 confirmed).
- Contains O, but O is not in positions 2 or 3 (so it must be in 4 or 5).
- Cannot contain: A, R, S, E, I, N, T.

I’ll test PUDGY, which uses new letters U, D, G, Y and places O in position 4 (which is allowed).

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)

2. POINT → P(✓) O(-) I(x) N(x) T(x)

   – O is still in the word but NOT in position 2 (and we already knew it wasn’t in 3).

   – P is confirmed in position 1.  
   – U is confirmed in position 2.  
   – D, G, Y are not in the word.

So the word pattern is: P U _ _ _

Letters ruled out so far: A, R, S, E, I, N, T, D, G, Y.

Remaining common letters not yet tested: L, C, K, M, B, F, H, O, W, V, Z, X, Q, J.

We know O must be in the word but cannot be in positions 2 or 3. Since positions 2 and 3 are already U and unknown, O must be in position 4 or 5.

Possible structures:
- P U _ O _
- P U _ _ O

Looking for valid 5-letter words starting with ""PU"" and containing O in position 4 or 5, using only allowed letters.

Valid words:
- PUMBO – but B and M are okay, O is in position 4. However, PUMBO is not common.
- PUDGY – already tried, D and G ruled out.
- PULPY – but P is repeated and Y is ruled out.

Another approach: look for P U _ _ O.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps maximize the chance of hitting some letters in the secret word.

Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A word like ""AROSE"" uses five very common letters and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants. Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" which also uses common letters. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the vowels A, O, E and the common consonants R, S, L. This should give me good information about which letters are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we now know:
- Letters not in the word: A, R, S, E.
- Letter in the word but not in position 3: O (so O must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels. The remaining common letters are T, L, N, I, C, D, U, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Include O in a different position (to confirm where it belongs).
2. Introduce as many new common letters as possible.
3. Avoid A, R, S, E.

One strong candidate is “POINT”:
- P, I, N, T are all common letters not yet tested.
- O is moved to position 2.
- This tests 5 new letters and repositions O.

Another candidate is “CLOUD”:
- C, L, U, D are new letters.

So far we know:

- Contains O, but O cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
- Cannot contain: A, R, S, E, I, N, T.

Remaining common letters not yet tested: L, U, C, D, Y, M, B, G, H, K, F, W, V, Z, X, Q, J.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with P.
- Has O in position 4 or 5.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Candidate words:

- PLOMP – invalid.
- PLOOM – invalid.

Let me think differently. We have P _ _ _ _ and O must be in position 4 or 5.

Possible structures:

- PUDGY: P(✓), U, D, G, Y – none of these letters are ruled out except T, N, I, etc. This seems valid.

Another: PUMBO – but M, B, O are okay, but O is in position 4 here, which is allowed.

But PUMBO is not a common word.

How about PUDGY? It’s a valid word.

P _ _ _ O: P U D G O – invalid.

P _ _ O _: P U D O _ – invalid.

P _ _ O _: P U L O _ – invalid.

P _ _ O _: P U C O _ – invalid.

P _ _ O _: P U L O _ – invalid.

Another candidate: PULPY – but P is repeated and Y is okay.

But PULPY: P(✓), U, L, P, Y – P is repeated, which is allowed, but we’d rather test new letters.

Let me try PUDGY: P, U, D, G, Y – all new letters except P which is fixed in position.

This seems like the best option given the constraints.Based on the feedback:
- Word starts with P (position 1 confirmed).
- Contains O, but O is not in positions 2 or 3 (so it must be in 4 or 5).
- Cannot contain: A, R, S, E, I, N, T.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(-) I(x) N(x) T(x)
Guess 3: PUDGY -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) U(✓) D(x) G(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   – O is in the word but NOT in position 3.

2. POINT → P(✓) O(-) I(x) N(x) T(x)  
   – P is fixed in position 1.  
   – O is still in the word but NOT in position 2 (and we already knew it wasn’t in 3).

3. PUDGY → P(✓) U(✓) D(x) G(x) Y(x)  
   – P is confirmed in position 1.  
   – U is confirmed in position 2.  
   – D, G, Y are not in the word.

So the word pattern is: P U _ _ _

Letters ruled out so far: A, R, S, E, I, N, T, D, G, Y.

Remaining common letters not yet tested: L, C, K, M, B, F, H, O, W, V, Z, X, Q, J.

We know O must be in the word but cannot be in positions 2 or 3. Since positions 2 and 3 are already U and unknown, O must be in position 4 or 5.

Possible structures:
- P U _ O _
- P U _ _ O

Looking for valid 5-letter words starting with ""PU"" and containing O in position 4 or 5, using only allowed letters.

Valid words:
- PUMBO – but B and M are okay, O is in position 4. However, PUMBO is not common.
- PUDGY – already tried, D and G ruled out.
- PULPY – but P is repeated and Y is ruled out.
- PUMPS – but S is ruled out.
- PUNCH – but N and C are okay, but N is ruled out.
- PUNKS – but N and S are ruled out.
- PULMO – but M and O are okay, but O is in position 4 here, and it's not common.
- PULVO – but V is okay, but not common.
- PUKKO – but K is okay, but double K and not common.

Another approach: look for P U _ _ O.

- PULPO – but L is okay, P is repeated, and it's not common.
- PUMPO – same issue.
- PUKKO – already considered.

Let me think of P U _ O _.

- PUMPO – P is repeated.
- PULPO – P is repeated.
- PUKPO – invalid.

Actually, looking at valid English words:
- PUMBO is not valid.
- PULVO is not valid.
- PUKKO is not valid.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe O is in position 5.

So pattern: P U _ _ O.

Valid words:
- PUNCH – N is ruled out.
- PUNKO – not valid.
- PUMPO – P is repeated.
- PULPO – P is repeated.
- PUKPO – invalid.

Hmm, seems limited. Let me check P U _ O _.

- PUMBO – invalid.
- PULVO – invalid.
- PUKKO – invalid.

Actually, let me think of P U _ _ _ with O in position 4.

- PULMO – M is okay, O is in position 4. PULMO is a valid word (short for pulmonary).

Let me check PULMO:
- P(✓) U(✓) L(?) M(?) O(?)  
- Letters: P, U, L, M, O – none of these are ruled out except we need to confirm L and M are allowed.

Yes, L and M have not been tested yet.

So PULMO seems like a good next guess.Based on the feedback:
- P is fixed in position 1.
- U is fixed in position 2.
- O must be in position 4 or 5.
- Letters D, G, Y are ruled out.
- Remaining letters: L, M, etc.

Testing PULMO places O in position 4 and introduces L and M.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps maximize the chance of hitting some letters in the secret word.

Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A word like ""AROSE"" uses five very common letters and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants. Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" which also uses common letters. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the vowels A, O, E and the common consonants R, S, L. This should give me good information about which letters are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we now know:
- Letters not in the word: A, R, S, E.
- Letter in the word but not in position 3: O (so O must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels. The remaining common letters are T, L, N, I, C, D, U, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Include O in a different position (to confirm where it belongs).
2. Introduce as many new common letters as possible.
3. Avoid A, R, S, E.

One strong candidate is “POINT”:
- P, I, N, T are all common letters not yet tested.
- O is moved to position 2.
- This tests 5 new letters and repositions O.

Another candidate is “CLOUD”:
- C, L, U, D are new letters.
- O is in position 2.

I’ll go with “POINT” as it tests P, I, N, T and repositions O.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)

   – O is still in the word but NOT in position 2 (and we already knew it wasn’t in 3).  
   – Letters ruled out: I, N, T (in addition to A, R, S, E).

So far we know:
- Word starts with P.
- Contains O, but O cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
- Cannot contain: A, R, S, E, I, N, T.

Remaining common letters not yet tested: L, U, C, D, Y, M, B, G, H, K, F, W, V, Z, X, Q, J.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with P.
- Has O in position 4 or 5.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Candidate words:
- PLOWY – but W and Y are less common, and we’d like to test more frequent letters.
- POUCH – but H and C are okay, but U is vowel and C is consonant.
- PULPY – but Y is okay, but P is repeated.
- PLOUM – not a valid English word.
- PLODY – not valid.
- PLOOM – not valid.
- PLOMP – not valid.
- PLOPY – not valid.

Better: PLOUGH – but G and H are okay, but O is in position 2 here, which we know is wrong.

Wait, O must be in position 4 or 5.

Let’s try PLOOM – invalid.

How about PLOPY – invalid.

Another approach: look for P _ _ O _ or P _ _ _ O.

Valid words:
- PLOOM – invalid.
- PLOPY – invalid.
- PLOUT – T is ruled out.
- PLOMP – invalid.
- PLOOM – invalid.

Let me think differently. We have P _ _ _ _ and O must be in position 4 or 5.

Possible structures:
- P _ _ O _
- P _ _ _ O

Looking for valid words:
- PUDGY – but D and G are okay, Y is okay, but U is vowel, D is consonant, G is consonant, Y is vowel.
- PUDGY: P(✓), U, D, G, Y – none of these letters are ruled out except T, N, I, etc. This seems valid.

Another: PUMBO – but M, B, O are okay, but O is in position 4 here, which is allowed.

But PUMBO is not a common word.

How about PUDGY? It’s a valid word.

But let me think of more common words.

P _ _ _ O: P U D G O – invalid.

P _ _ O _: P U D O _ – invalid.

P _ _ O _: P U L O _ – invalid.

P _ _ O _: P U C O _ – invalid.

P _ _ O _: P U L O _ – invalid.

Another candidate: PULPY – but P is repeated and Y is okay.

But PULPY: P(✓), U, L, P, Y – P is repeated, which is allowed, but we’d rather test new letters.

Let me try PUDGY: P, U, D, G, Y – all new letters except P which is fixed in position.

This seems like the best option given the constraints.Based on the feedback:
- Word starts with P (position 1 confirmed).
- Contains O, but O is not in positions 2 or 3 (so it must be in 4 or 5).
- Cannot contain: A, R, S, E, I, N, T.

I’ll test PUDGY, which uses new letters U, D, G, Y and places O in position 4 (which is allowed).

Remaining common letters not yet tested: L, C, K, M, B, F, H, O, W, V, Z, X, Q, J.

Possible structures:

Looking for valid 5-letter words starting with ""PU"" and containing O in position 4 or 5, using only allowed letters.

Valid words:
- PUMBO – but B and M are okay, O is in position 4. However, PUMBO is not common.
- PUDGY – already tried, D and G ruled out.
- PULPY – but P is repeated and Y is ruled out.
- PUMPS – but S is ruled out.
- PUNCH – but N and C are okay, but N is ruled out.
- PUNKS – but N and S are ruled out.
- PULMO – but M and O are okay, but O is in position 4 here, and it's not common.
- PULVO – but V is okay, but not common.
- PUKKO – but K is okay, but double K and not common.

Another approach: look for P U _ _ O.

- PULPO – but L is okay, P is repeated, and it's not common.
- PUMPO – same issue.
- PUKKO – already considered.

Let me think of P U _ O _.

- PUMPO – P is repeated.
- PULPO – P is repeated.
- PUKPO – invalid.

Actually, looking at valid English words:
- PUMBO is not valid.
- PULVO is not valid.
- PUKKO is not valid.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe O is in position 5.

So pattern: P U _ _ O.

Valid words:
- PUNCH – N is ruled out.
- PUNKO – not valid.
- PUMPO – P is repeated.
- PULPO – P is repeated.
- PUKPO – invalid.

Hmm, seems limited. Let me check P U _ O _.

- PUMBO – invalid.
- PULVO – invalid.
- PUKKO – invalid.

Actually, let me think of P U _ _ _ with O in position 4.

- PULMO – M is okay, O is in position 4. PULMO is a valid word (short for pulmonary).

Let me check PULMO:
- P(✓) U(✓) L(?) M(?) O(?)  
- Letters: P, U, L, M, O – none of these are ruled out except we need to confirm L and M are allowed.

Yes, L and M have not been tested yet.

So PULMO seems like a good next guess.Based on the feedback:
- P is fixed in position 1.
- U is fixed in position 2.
- O must be in position 4 or 5.
- Letters D, G, Y are ruled out.
- Remaining letters: L, M, etc.

Testing PULMO places O in position 4 and introduces L and M.

Current confirmed facts:

- Pattern: P U _ _ O  (O is now fixed in position 5)
- Letters ruled out so far: A, R, S, E, I, N, T, D, G, Y, L, M
- Still-allowed letters (common ones): B, C, F, H, K, W, V, Z, X, Q, J (plus any we haven’t tried)

We need a 5-letter word that starts with P U, ends with O, and uses only the still-allowed letters in positions 3 and 4.

Possible patterns: P U _ _ O

Valid English words fitting this:
- PUNCH – N is ruled out
- PUNKO – invalid
- PUMBO – M and B ruled out
- PULPO – L ruled out
- PUKPO – invalid
- PUFFO – F is still allowed
- PUKKO – K is allowed, but double K and uncommon
- PUFFO – valid word (a type of puffball fungus)

Let’s check PUFFO:
- P(✓) U(✓) F(?) F(?) O(✓)
- F has not been tested yet, and it’s common.

This seems like the best next guess.
