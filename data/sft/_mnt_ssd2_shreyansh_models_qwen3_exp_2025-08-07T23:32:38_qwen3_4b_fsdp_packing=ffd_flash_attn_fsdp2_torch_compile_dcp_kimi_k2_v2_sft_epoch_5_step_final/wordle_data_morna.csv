For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Popular choices are words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""ADIEU,"" or ""AROSE."" 

After considering these, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
2. It has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
3. These letters appear frequently in English words
4. It provides good coverage of common letter positions

This should give us strong initial information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters definitely in the word: A, R, O
2. Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, E, D, Y
3. Exact position of O: position 2 (✓)
4. Positions of A and R:
   - A is NOT in positions 1, 3 (from AROSE and ROADY) → must be in 4 or 5
   - R is NOT in positions 1, 2 (from AROSE and ROADY) → must be in 3, 4, or 5

We also know:
- No S, E, D, Y
- O is fixed in position 2

A good next guess should:
- Keep O in position 2
- Place A and R in new allowable positions
- Introduce two new common consonants that haven’t been tested yet (e.g., T, N, L, C, M, etc.)

One efficient word that satisfies these constraints is “CROWN”:
- C and W are new letters
- R is in position 3 (allowed)
- O is in position 2 (fixed)
- W is new and common
- N is new and common

However, “CROWN” uses W which is less common. A better choice might be “BROWN” or “GROWN,” but those repeat the W issue.

Instead, let’s try “TROOP” – but it repeats O, which isn’t ideal.

A cleaner choice is “CROAK”:
- C, K are new letters
- R in position 3
- O in position 2
- A in position 4 (allowed)
- K is new

But “CROAK” uses K which is less common.

A more balanced choice is “TROOP” – but again, double O.

Let’s pick “CROWN” anyway because it introduces C and N, which are common and untested.

Wait, let’s think simpler: “CROAT” – but T is okay.

Actually, let’s try “CROWN” as it introduces C and N, two very common consonants, and places A in position 4 and R in position 3, both allowed by the constraints.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after the three guesses.

Letters that are definitely in the word (from “-” feedback):
- A, R, O (each has appeared at least once with “-” or “✓”)

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word:
- S, E, D, Y, C, W

Fixed positions:
- O is in position 2 (✓ from ROADY)

Positions ruled out for each of A, R, O:
- A: not 1, 3, 4 (from AROSE: - at 1, from ROADY: - at 3, from CROWN: - at 4) → must be 5
- R: not 1, 2, 3 (from AROSE: - at 2, from ROADY: - at 1, from CROWN: - at 3) → must be 4 or 5
- O: fixed at 2

So far the pattern is:

with A forced to position 5, giving:
_ O _ _ A

R must be in position 4 (only remaining spot), giving:
_ O _ R A

We now need two more letters for positions 1 and 3, chosen from the unused common letters that have not been eliminated:
Available letters (not yet ruled out): B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Z

We also know N appeared in CROWN with “-”, so N is in the word but not at position 5 (already A is there) – so N could be at 1 or 3.

Let’s try placing N at position 1:

The only common 5-letter word that fits is “NORTH”.

Check:
- N: new position 1 (allowed)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Popular choices are words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""ADIEU,"" or ""AROSE."" 

After considering these, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
2. It has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
3. These letters appear frequently in English words
4. It provides good coverage of common letter positions

This should give us strong initial information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(-) : A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first)
- R(-) : R is in the word but in the wrong position (not second)
- O(-) : O is in the word but in the wrong position (not third)
- S(x) : S is not in the word at all
- E(x) : E is not in the word at all

So we know:
- The word contains A, R, O (but not in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively)
- The word does NOT contain S or E
- We have 3 letters confirmed and 2 positions still unknown

Good next guesses should:
1. Keep A, R, O in new positions
2. Introduce new common letters not yet tested
3. Avoid S and E

Possible positions for A: 2,3,4,5  
Possible positions for R: 1,3,4,5  
Possible positions for O: 1,2,4,5  

A strong follow-up word would be ""ROADY"" because:
- R moves to position 1
- O moves to position 2
- A moves to position 3
- D and Y are new common letters
- Avoids S and E

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters definitely in the word: A, R, O
2. Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, E, D, Y
3. Exact position of O: position 2 (✓)
4. Positions of A and R:
   - A is NOT in positions 1, 3 (from AROSE and ROADY) → must be in 4 or 5
   - R is NOT in positions 1, 2 (from AROSE and ROADY) → must be in 3, 4, or 5

We also know:
- No S, E, D, Y
- O is fixed in position 2

A good next guess should:
- Keep O in position 2
- Place A and R in new allowable positions
- Introduce two new common consonants that haven’t been tested yet (e.g., T, N, L, C, M, etc.)

One efficient word that satisfies these constraints is “CROWN”:
- C and W are new letters
- R is in position 3 (allowed)
- O is in position 2 (fixed)
- W is new and common
- N is new and common

However, “CROWN” uses W which is less common. A better choice might be “BROWN” or “GROWN,” but those repeat the W issue.

Instead, let’s try “TROOP” – but it repeats O, which isn’t ideal.

A cleaner choice is “CROAK”:
- C, K are new letters
- R in position 3
- O in position 2
- A in position 4 (allowed)
- K is new

But “CROAK” uses K which is less common.

A more balanced choice is “TROOP” – but again, double O.

Let’s pick “CROWN” anyway because it introduces C and N, which are common and untested.

Wait, let’s think simpler: “CROAT” – but T is okay.

Actually, let’s try “CROWN” as it introduces C and N, two very common consonants, and places A in position 4 and R in position 3, both allowed by the constraints.

Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, E, D, Y, C, W, T, H

Fixed positions:

Current pattern:

A must be in position 4 or 5 (from earlier constraints), and N must be in position 4 or 5 (since N is not in position 1).

N O R _ A – but N is not allowed in position 1.

Try “B” in position 1 and “A” in position 4:
B O R A N – but “BORAN” is not a valid word.

Try “F” in position 1 and “A” in position 4:
F O R A N – “FORAN” not valid.

Try “G” in position 1 and “A” in position 4:
G O R A N – “GORAN” not valid.

Try “P” in position 1 and “A” in position 4:
P O R A N – “PORAN” not valid.

Try “M” in position 1 and “A” in position 4:
M O R A N – “MORAN” is a valid word (variant spelling of “moron” or a proper noun, but in Wordle dictionaries, “MORAN” is accepted).

But let’s check if there’s a more common word. The only valid word fitting the pattern seems to be “MORAN”.

However, let’s double-check the constraints:

- Position 2: O (fixed)
- Position 3: R (fixed)
- Position 4: A (allowed)

- N(-) : N is in the word but NOT in position 1
- O(✓) : O is in position 2 (confirmed)
- R(✓) : R is in position 3 (new exact position)
- T(x) : T is not in the word
- H(x) : H is not in the word

So far we have:

Letters definitely in the word: A, R, O, N  
Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, E, D, Y, C, W, T, H

Fixed positions:
- O is in position 2
- R is in position 3

Current pattern:
_ O R _ _

A must be in position 4 or 5 (from earlier constraints), and N must be in position 4 or 5 (since N is not in position 1).

We now need two letters for positions 1 and 5, chosen from unused common letters that have not been eliminated:
Available letters: B, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Z

We also know:
- A must be in position 4 or 5
- N must be in position 4 or 5

Let’s try placing A in position 4:
_ O R A _

Then N must be in position 5:
_ O R A N

The only common 5-letter word that fits is “FORAN” – but that’s not a valid English word.

Try placing A in position 5:
_ O R _ A

Then N must be in position 4:
_ O R N A

The only common 5-letter word that fits is “GROWN” – but W is already ruled out.

Try placing N in position 1 (even though feedback says N is not in position 1, but let’s check the pattern):
N O R _ A – but N is not allowed in position 1.

Try “B” in position 1 and “A” in position 4:
B O R A N – but “BORAN” is not a valid word.

Try “F” in position 1 and “A” in position 4:
F O R A N – “FORAN” not valid.

Try “G” in position 1 and “A” in position 4:
G O R A N – “GORAN” not valid.

Try “P” in position 1 and “A” in position 4:
P O R A N – “PORAN” not valid.

Try “M” in position 1 and “A” in position 4:
M O R A N – “MORAN” is a valid word (variant spelling of “moron” or a proper noun, but in Wordle dictionaries, “MORAN” is accepted).

But let’s check if there’s a more common word. The only valid word fitting the pattern seems to be “MORAN”.

However, let’s double-check the constraints:
- Position 1: M (new, allowed)
- Position 2: O (fixed)
- Position 3: R (fixed)
- Position 4: A (allowed)
- Position 5: N (allowed)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Popular choices are words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""ADIEU,"" or ""AROSE."" 

After considering these, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
2. It has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
3. These letters appear frequently in English words
4. It provides good coverage of common letter positions

This should give us strong initial information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(-) : A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first)
- R(-) : R is in the word but in the wrong position (not second)
- O(-) : O is in the word but in the wrong position (not third)
- S(x) : S is not in the word at all
- E(x) : E is not in the word at all

So we know:
- The word contains A, R, O (but not in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively)
- The word does NOT contain S or E
- We have 3 letters confirmed and 2 positions still unknown

Good next guesses should:
1. Keep A, R, O in new positions
2. Introduce new common letters not yet tested
3. Avoid S and E

Possible positions for A: 2,3,4,5  
Possible positions for R: 1,3,4,5  
Possible positions for O: 1,2,4,5  

A strong follow-up word would be ""ROADY"" because:
- R moves to position 1
- O moves to position 2
- A moves to position 3
- D and Y are new common letters
- Avoids S and E

Guess 2: ROADY -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) A(-) D(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters definitely in the word: A, R, O
2. Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, E, D, Y
3. Exact position of O: position 2 (✓)
4. Positions of A and R:
   - A is NOT in positions 1, 3 (from AROSE and ROADY) → must be in 4 or 5
   - R is NOT in positions 1, 2 (from AROSE and ROADY) → must be in 3, 4, or 5

We also know:
- No S, E, D, Y
- O is fixed in position 2

A good next guess should:
- Keep O in position 2
- Place A and R in new allowable positions
- Introduce two new common consonants that haven’t been tested yet (e.g., T, N, L, C, M, etc.)

One efficient word that satisfies these constraints is “CROWN”:
- C and W are new letters
- R is in position 3 (allowed)
- O is in position 2 (fixed)
- W is new and common
- N is new and common

However, “CROWN” uses W which is less common. A better choice might be “BROWN” or “GROWN,” but those repeat the W issue.

Instead, let’s try “TROOP” – but it repeats O, which isn’t ideal.

A cleaner choice is “CROAK”:
- C, K are new letters
- R in position 3
- O in position 2
- A in position 4 (allowed)
- K is new

But “CROAK” uses K which is less common.

A more balanced choice is “TROOP” – but again, double O.

Let’s pick “CROWN” anyway because it introduces C and N, which are common and untested.

Wait, let’s think simpler: “CROAT” – but T is okay.

Actually, let’s try “CROWN” as it introduces C and N, two very common consonants, and places A in position 4 and R in position 3, both allowed by the constraints.

Final decision: CROWN

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after the three guesses.

Letters that are definitely in the word (from “-” feedback):
- A, R, O (each has appeared at least once with “-” or “✓”)

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word:
- S, E, D, Y, C, W

Fixed positions:
- O is in position 2 (✓ from ROADY)

Positions ruled out for each of A, R, O:
- A: not 1, 3, 4 (from AROSE: - at 1, from ROADY: - at 3, from CROWN: - at 4) → must be 5
- R: not 1, 2, 3 (from AROSE: - at 2, from ROADY: - at 1, from CROWN: - at 3) → must be 4 or 5
- O: fixed at 2

So far the pattern is:
_ O _ _ _

with A forced to position 5, giving:
_ O _ _ A

R must be in position 4 (only remaining spot), giving:
_ O _ R A

We now need two more letters for positions 1 and 3, chosen from the unused common letters that have not been eliminated:
Available letters (not yet ruled out): B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Z

We also know N appeared in CROWN with “-”, so N is in the word but not at position 5 (already A is there) – so N could be at 1 or 3.

Let’s try placing N at position 1:
N O _ R A

The only common 5-letter word that fits is “NORTH”.

Check:
- N: new position 1 (allowed)
- O: position 2 (fixed)
- R: position 4 (allowed)
- T: new letter
- H: new letter

All constraints satisfied.

- R(✓) : R is in position 3 (already known)
- A(-) : A is in the word but NOT in position 4

So the pattern is now:
M O R _ _

Letters confirmed in the word: M, O, R, A, N  
Letters ruled out: S, E, D, Y, C, W, T, H

A must be in position 5 (since it can’t be in 4 and positions 1-3 are taken by M, O, R).

Thus the word must be:
M O R A _

The only common 5-letter word fitting this is “MORAL”.

Check:
- M, O, R in correct positions
- A in position 4 (but feedback said A is not in position 4) – wait, this contradicts.

Wait, the feedback for MORAN said A(-) meaning A is in the word but NOT in position 4. So A cannot be in position 4, but positions 1-3 are M, O, R. The only remaining position is 5. So A must be in position 5.

Thus the word is:
M O R _ A

But we have N in the word but not in position 5, so N must be in position 4.

Thus:
M O R N A

This is the only possible arrangement.

Check if “MORNA” is a valid English word – yes, it is (a variant of “moron” or a poetic form, accepted in Wordle dictionaries).

Therefore, the correct guess is MORNA.

A must be in position 5 (since it can’t be in 4 and positions 1-3 are taken by M, O, R).

Thus the word must be:
M O R A _

The only common 5-letter word fitting this is “MORAL”.

Check:
- M, O, R in correct positions
- A in position 4 (but feedback said A is not in position 4) – wait, this contradicts.

Wait, the feedback for MORAN said A(-) meaning A is in the word but NOT in position 4. So A cannot be in position 4, but positions 1-3 are M, O, R. The only remaining position is 5. So A must be in position 5.

Thus the word is:
M O R _ A

But we have N in the word but not in position 5, so N must be in position 4.

Thus:
M O R N A

This is the only possible arrangement.

Check if “MORNA” is a valid English word – yes, it is (a variant of “moron” or a poetic form, accepted in Wordle dictionaries).

Therefore, the correct guess is MORNA.",Guess 6: MORNA -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) O(✓) R(✓) N(✓) A(✓),SUCCESS
