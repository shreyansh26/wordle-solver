1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to test more unique letters

Popular strong starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the correct first position (✓).
- L, A, T, E are all absent from the word (x).

So the secret word looks like:
S _ _ _ _

We now need four more letters, none of which can be L, A, T, or E.  
Good consonants to test next are R, N, I, O, U, C, H, M, P, etc.

A good second guess should:
1. Keep S in the first position.
2. Introduce new common letters.
3. Avoid any of L, A, T, E.

Let’s try “SOUND”:
- S stays in place (✓).
- O, U, N, D are all new letters that haven’t been tested yet.

This gives us a fresh set of letters to evaluate while preserving the known S.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to test more unique letters

Popular strong starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the correct first position (✓).
- L, A, T, E are all absent from the word (x).

So the secret word looks like:
S _ _ _ _

We now need four more letters, none of which can be L, A, T, or E.  
Good consonants to test next are R, N, I, O, U, C, H, M, P, etc.

A good second guess should:
1. Keep S in the first position.
2. Introduce new common letters.
3. Avoid any of L, A, T, E.

Let’s try “SOUND”:
- S stays in place (✓).
- O, U, N, D are all new letters that haven’t been tested yet.

This gives us a fresh set of letters to evaluate while preserving the known S.

Current knowledge:
- Word starts with S.
- Letters in the word but in wrong positions: O, U.
- Letters not in the word: L, A, T, E, N, D.

So the pattern is S _ _ _ _ with O and U somewhere in positions 2-5, but not where they were in SOUND (O was in position 2, U in position 3).

Possible positions for O and U:
- O can be in 3, 4, or 5.
- U can be in 2, 4, or 5.

We need two more distinct letters (not L, A, T, E, N, D). Common unused letters include R, I, C, H, M, P, G, K, etc.

Let’s try to place O and U in new positions and add two new consonants. A good candidate is ""SOURP"":
- S stays in position 1.
- O moves to position 3.
- U moves to position 2.
- R and P are new letters.

This tests O in position 3, U in position 2, and introduces R and P.

From the four guesses we now know:

- The letters O, U, C are all in the word but in wrong positions (each appeared once and got “-”).
- The letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, N, D, R.

So the three letters O, U, C must occupy positions 2, 3, 4 in some order, with the constraints:
- O cannot be in position 2 (from SOUND) or 4 (from SUCOP).
- U cannot be in position 2 (from SUCOP) or 3 (from SOUND).
- C cannot be in position 3 (from SUCOP).

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to test more unique letters

Popular strong starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words.

From the feedback on SLATE:

We now need four more letters, none of which can be L, A, T, or E.  
Good consonants to test next are R, N, I, O, U, C, H, M, P, etc.

A good second guess should:
1. Keep S in the first position.
2. Introduce new common letters.
3. Avoid any of L, A, T, E.

Let’s try “SOUND”:
- S stays in place (✓).
- O, U, N, D are all new letters that haven’t been tested yet.

This gives us a fresh set of letters to evaluate while preserving the known S.

From all feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)

2. SOUND → S(✓) O(-) U(-) N(x) D(x)
   - O and U are in the word but in wrong positions.
   - N and D are NOT in the word.
   - O was in position 2, U in position 3, so O cannot be in 2 and U cannot be in 3.

3. SOURP → S(✓) O(-) U(-) R(x) P(✓)
   - P is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).
   - R is NOT in the word.

Current pattern: S _ _ _ P

Possible positions for O and U:
- O can be in positions 3 or 4 (cannot be 2 or 5).
- U can be in positions 2, 4 (cannot be 3 or 5).

We need one more letter (since we have S, O, U, P already). This letter must be new and not in the forbidden list. Common unused letters: C, H, I, M, G, K, etc.

Let's try placing O in position 3 and U in position 2, and add a new consonant in position 4. A good candidate is ""SUCOP"":
- S in 1 (✓)
- U in 2 (new position)
- C in 3 (new letter)
- O in 4 (new position)
- P in 5 (✓)

This tests:
- U in position 2
- O in position 4
- C as a new letter

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(-) U(-) N(x) D(x)
Guess 3: SOURP -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(-) U(-) R(x) P(✓)
Guess 4: SUCOP -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) U(-) C(-) O(-) P(✓)

From the four guesses we now know:

- The word is S _ _ _ P (S and P are fixed in positions 1 and 5).
- The letters O, U, C are all in the word but in wrong positions (each appeared once and got “-”).
- The letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, N, D, R.

So the three letters O, U, C must occupy positions 2, 3, 4 in some order, with the constraints:
- O cannot be in position 2 (from SOUND) or 4 (from SUCOP).
- U cannot be in position 2 (from SUCOP) or 3 (from SOUND).
- C cannot be in position 3 (from SUCOP).

Let’s list the allowed positions:

Position 2: cannot be O or U → must be C.
Position 3: cannot be C or U → must be O.
Position 4: cannot be O → must be U.

This gives the unique arrangement:
S C O U P

The feedback for Guess 5 (""SCOU P"") was corrected to indicate it is not a 5-letter word.  
Let’s re-express the pattern S _ _ _ P and the constraints:

Letters known to be in the word: S, O, U, C, P  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: L, A, T, E, N, D, R  

Positions:
1 = S  
5 = P  

Letters O, U, C must occupy positions 2, 3, 4 in some order, but:
- O cannot be in position 2 or 4 (from SOUND and SUCOP)  
- U cannot be in position 2 or 3 (from SOUND and SUCOP)  
- C cannot be in position 3 (from SUCOP)

The only valid permutation is:
2 = C  
3 = O  
4 = U  

Thus the word must be SC OUP.
