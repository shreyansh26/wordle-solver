For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives me a good spread of letters that appear frequently in English words, maximizing the chance of getting hits (either ✓ or -) that will guide my next guesses.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1, so it must be in positions 2-5).
- L is not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3, so it must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- T is not in the word at all.
- E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains S and A.
- Does NOT contain L, T, or E.
- S is not in position 1.
- A is not in position 3.

I need a new word that uses S and A, avoids L/T/E, and places S somewhere other than position 1. A good candidate is ""CRASH"":
- C, R, A, S, H are all allowed letters.
- A is in position 3, but we know A is not in position 3, so this is invalid.
Next candidate: ""CHASE"" – but E is forbidden.
Next: ""SANDY"" – but S is in position 1, which is forbidden.
Next: ""STAND"" – T is forbidden.
Next: ""SPASM"" – S appears twice and is in position 1 (invalid).
Next: ""SALAD"" – A is in position 3 (invalid).
Next: ""SARAN"" – A is in position 3 (invalid).
Next: ""SCARS"" – S is in position 5 (allowed), A is in position 2 (allowed), no forbidden letters.
""SCARS"" seems valid.

Let me verify:
- S: in word, not in position 1 (it's in position 5) – OK.
- A: in word, not in position 3 (it's in position 2) – OK.
- C, R: no info, so OK.
- S appears twice, but that's allowed.

   - A is again “in word but wrong place” (it was in position 3, so it must be 1, 2, 4, or 5).

- Contains A somewhere other than positions 3 or 5.  
- Does NOT contain L, T, E, C, R.  
- Contains exactly one S (since the second S was marked ✓ in position 5).

Letters still allowed: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the single S at position 5.

We need a 5-letter word ending in S, with A somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4, and using only the allowed letters.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:

- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)

So the secret word:
- Contains S and A.
- Does NOT contain L, T, or E.
- S is not in position 1.
- A is not in position 3.

I need a new word that uses S and A, avoids L/T/E, and places S somewhere other than position 1. A good candidate is ""CRASH"":
- C, R, A, S, H are all allowed letters.
- A is in position 3, but we know A is not in position 3, so this is invalid.
Next candidate: ""CHASE"" – but E is forbidden.
Next: ""SANDY"" – but S is in position 1, which is forbidden.
Next: ""STAND"" – T is forbidden.
Next: ""SPASM"" – S appears twice and is in position 1 (invalid).
Next: ""SALAD"" – A is in position 3 (invalid).
Next: ""SARAN"" – A is in position 3 (invalid).
Next: ""SCARS"" – S is in position 5 (allowed), A is in position 2 (allowed), no forbidden letters.
""SCARS"" seems valid.

Let me verify:
- S: in word, not in position 1 (it's in position 5) – OK.
- A: in word, not in position 3 (it's in position 2) – OK.
- C, R: no info, so OK.
- S appears twice, but that's allowed.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)  
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.  
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.  
   - L, T, E are not in the word at all.

2. SCARS → S(-) C(x) A(-) R(x) S(✓)  
   - First S is still “in word but wrong place” (it was in position 1, so it must be 2–5).  
   - Second S is now “correct in position 5”.  
   - C and R are not in the word.  
   - A is again “in word but wrong place” (it was in position 3, so it must be 1, 2, 4, or 5).

So we now know the secret word:
- Ends with S (position 5).  
- Contains A somewhere other than positions 3 or 5.  
- Does NOT contain L, T, E, C, R.  
- Contains exactly one S (since the second S was marked ✓ in position 5).

Letters still allowed: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the single S at position 5.

We need a 5-letter word ending in S, with A somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4, and using only the allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- BAGAS (invalid – contains A in position 3)  
- DAGAS (invalid – A in position 3)  
- GAZAS (invalid – A in position 3)  
- PANSY (ends in Y) – wrong.  
- MANGO (ends in O) – wrong.  
- GAINS (ends in S, A in position 3) – invalid.  
- FANAL (ends in L) – invalid.  
- BANAL (ends in L) – invalid.  
- HAZAS (ends in S, A in position 2) – valid so far: H, A, Z, A, S. But A appears twice, and we don’t know if A appears twice.  
- BANAS (ends in S, A in position 2) – valid: B, A, N, A, S. Again double A.  
- MANAS (ends in S, A in position 2) – valid: M, A, N, A, S. Double A.  
- DANGS (ends in S, A in position 2) – valid: D, A, N, G, S. No double A.  
- PANSY (invalid – ends in Y).  
- KANGS (ends in S, A in position 2) – valid: K, A, N, G, S. No double A.  
- JANGS (ends in S, A in position 2) – valid: J, A, N, G, S. No double A.

Among these, “DANGS” and “KANGS” are both valid, but “DANGS” uses D, A, N, G, S – all allowed letters, with A in position 2 (allowed), and no forbidden letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives me a good spread of letters that appear frequently in English words, maximizing the chance of getting hits (either ✓ or -) that will guide my next guesses.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1, so it must be in positions 2-5).
- L is not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3, so it must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- T is not in the word at all.
- E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains S and A.
- Does NOT contain L, T, or E.
- S is not in position 1.
- A is not in position 3.

I need a new word that uses S and A, avoids L/T/E, and places S somewhere other than position 1. A good candidate is ""CRASH"":
- C, R, A, S, H are all allowed letters.
- A is in position 3, but we know A is not in position 3, so this is invalid.
Next candidate: ""CHASE"" – but E is forbidden.
Next: ""SANDY"" – but S is in position 1, which is forbidden.
Next: ""STAND"" – T is forbidden.
Next: ""SPASM"" – S appears twice and is in position 1 (invalid).
Next: ""SALAD"" – A is in position 3 (invalid).
Next: ""SARAN"" – A is in position 3 (invalid).
Next: ""SCARS"" – S is in position 5 (allowed), A is in position 2 (allowed), no forbidden letters.
""SCARS"" seems valid.

Let me verify:
- S: in word, not in position 1 (it's in position 5) – OK.
- A: in word, not in position 3 (it's in position 2) – OK.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SCARS -> FEEDBACK: S(-) C(x) A(-) R(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)  
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.  
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.  
   - L, T, E are not in the word at all.

2. SCARS → S(-) C(x) A(-) R(x) S(✓)  
   - First S is still “in word but wrong place” (it was in position 1, so it must be 2–5).  
   - Second S is now “correct in position 5”.  
   - C and R are not in the word.  
   - A is again “in word but wrong place” (it was in position 3, so it must be 1, 2, 4, or 5).

So we now know the secret word:
- Ends with S (position 5).  
- Contains A somewhere other than positions 3 or 5.  
- Does NOT contain L, T, E, C, R.  
- Contains exactly one S (since the second S was marked ✓ in position 5).

Letters still allowed: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the single S at position 5.

We need a 5-letter word ending in S, with A somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4, and using only the allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- BAGAS (invalid – contains A in position 3)  
- DAGAS (invalid – A in position 3)  
- GAZAS (invalid – A in position 3)  
- PANSY (ends in Y) – wrong.  
- MANGO (ends in O) – wrong.  
- GAINS (ends in S, A in position 3) – invalid.  
- FANAL (ends in L) – invalid.  
- BANAL (ends in L) – invalid.  
- HAZAS (ends in S, A in position 2) – valid so far: H, A, Z, A, S. But A appears twice, and we don’t know if A appears twice.  
- BANAS (ends in S, A in position 2) – valid: B, A, N, A, S. Again double A.  
- MANAS (ends in S, A in position 2) – valid: M, A, N, A, S. Double A.  
- DANGS (ends in S, A in position 2) – valid: D, A, N, G, S. No double A.  
- PANSY (invalid – ends in Y).  
- KANGS (ends in S, A in position 2) – valid: K, A, N, G, S. No double A.  
- JANGS (ends in S, A in position 2) – valid: J, A, N, G, S. No double A.

Among these, “DANGS” and “KANGS” are both valid, but “DANGS” uses D, A, N, G, S – all allowed letters, with A in position 2 (allowed), and no forbidden letters.

From the three rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)  
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.  
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.  
   - L, T, E are not in the word.

2. SCARS → S(-) C(x) A(-) R(x) S(✓)  
   - First S is still “in word but wrong place” (positions 2–5).  
   - Second S is now “correct in position 5”.  
   - C and R are not in the word.  
   - A is again “in word but wrong place” (positions 1, 2, 4).

3. DANGS → D(x) A(✓) N(x) G(x) S(✓)  
   - A is now “correct in position 2”.  
   - S is “correct in position 5”.  
   - D, N, G are not in the word.

So we now know the secret word:
- Pattern: _ A _ _ S  
- Must contain A in position 2 and S in position 5.  
- Cannot contain: L, T, E, C, R, D, N, G.  
- Remaining letters allowed: B, F, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word fitting the pattern _ A _ _ S, using only the allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- B A S E S – E is forbidden.  
- F A C E S – C and E forbidden.  
- M A N S – too short.  
- P A P A S – P, A, P, A, S – P and A are allowed, but A appears twice. We don’t know if A appears twice, but the feedback only confirmed one A (in position 2). Still, it’s a valid word.  
- K A P P S – invalid (not a word).  
- H A P P Y – ends in Y.  
- M A C H O – ends in O.  
- B A B A S – invalid (not a common word).  
- F A I R Y – ends in Y.  
- B A I N S – N is forbidden.  
- B A S I S – S is already in position 5, and we don’t know if S appears twice.  
- P A P I S – invalid.  
- M A J O R – ends in R (forbidden).  
- B A J A S – invalid.  
- B A L L S – L is forbidden.  
- B A N K S – N is forbidden.  
- B A R R S – R is forbidden.  
- B A S K S – K is allowed, but S is already in position 5, and we don’t know if S appears twice.  
- B A S S – too short.  
- P A P A S – valid word: P, A, P, A, S. Pattern _ A _ _ S with P in positions 1 and 3, A in 2, and S in 5.  
- K A P P S – invalid.  
- J A C K S – C and K are allowed, but J, A, C, K, S – C is forbidden.  
- M A J E S – E is forbidden.  
- B A J E S – E is forbidden.  
- B A J A S – invalid.  
- B A S K S – K is allowed, but S is already in position 5.  
- B A S S – too short.  
- B A S I S – valid: B, A, S, I, S. Pattern _ A _ _ S with B in 1, A in 2, S in 5, and I in 4. No forbidden letters.  

Between PAPAS and BASIS, BASIS fits the pattern _ A _ _ S with allowed letters (B, A, S, I, S) and no forbidden letters. However, S appears twice, and we only confirmed one S (in position 5). Still, it’s a valid word. But BASIS has S in position 3 and 5, which might be possible.  

Another candidate: M A I Z E – ends in E (forbidden).  
M A I S – too short.  
M A I N S – N is forbidden.  
M A J O R – ends in R (forbidden).  
M A Z A S – Z is allowed, A in 2, S in 5: M, A, Z, A, S. Double A, but valid.  

But the simplest valid word fitting _ A _ _ S with allowed letters is BASIS: B, A, S, I, S.  

However, BASIS has S in position 3 and 5, which might be acceptable.  

But let’s check if there’s a word with single S in position 5 and A in position 2, and no other S.  

Pattern: _ A _ _ S  
Letters allowed for positions 1, 3, 4: B, F, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

Possible words:
- B A K E S – E is forbidden.  
- B A L K S – L is forbidden.  
- B A M B S – M, B, S – valid: B, A, M, B, S. Double B, but valid.  
- B A P S – too short.  
- B A R S – too short.  
- B A S S – too short.  
- B A T S – T is forbidden.  
- B A V I S – V, I, S – valid: B, A, V, I, S.  

BAVIS is not a common word.  

Another:  
- F A M I S – F, A, M, I, S. Valid word.  

FAMIS is not a common English word.  

The most common word fitting the pattern is BASIS.  

But BASIS has S in position 3 and 5.  

Alternative:  
- B A I S – too short.  
- B A K E S – E forbidden.  
- B A M B S – valid but double B.  

The best common word is BASIS.  

But let’s verify:  
B A S I S  
- B (allowed)  
- A (correct in position 2)  
- S (allowed)  
- I (allowed)  
- S (correct in position 5)  

No forbidden letters.  

Therefore, BASIS is a valid guess.

   - S is in the word but not in position 1.  
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.  
   - L, T, E are not in the word.

2. SCARS → S(-) C(x) A(-) R(x) S(✓)  
   - First S is still “in word but wrong place” (positions 2–5).  
   - Second S is now “correct in position 5”.

   - Second S is again “correct in position 5”.  
   - B and I are not in the word.  
   - First S is “in word but wrong place” (positions 1, 3, 4).  

So the secret word:
- Pattern: _ A _ _ S  
- Must contain A in position 2 and S in position 5.  
- Cannot contain: L, T, E, C, R, D, N, G, B, I.  
- Remaining letters allowed: F, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word fitting the pattern _ A _ _ S, using only the allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- F A K E S – E forbidden.  
- F A M I S – I forbidden.  
- F A M O S – O allowed: F, A, M, O, S.  
- H A M O S – H, A, M, O, S.  
- J A M O S – J, A, M, O, S.  
- K A M O S – K, A, M, O, S.  
- M A J O S – M, A, J, O, S.  
- P A P A S – P, A, P, A, S.  
- V A M O S – V, A, M, O, S.  
- W A M O S – W, A, M, O, S.  
- Y A M O S – Y, A, M, O, S.  

Among these, “FAMOS”, “HAMOS”, “JAMOS”, “KAMOS”, “MADOS”, “PAPAS”, “VAMOS”, “WAMOS”, “YAMOS” are all valid.  
The most common English word among them is “VAMOS” (Spanish for “let’s go”), but it is recognized in Scrabble dictionaries.  
Another strong candidate is “PAPAS”, but it has double A (position 2 and 4), which might be possible.  
However, “VAMOS” uses distinct letters (V, A, M, O, S) and fits the pattern perfectly with allowed letters.

Therefore, “VAMOS” is a strong next guess.

   - Second S is again “correct in position 5”.  
   - B and I are not in the word.  
   - First S is “in word but wrong place” (positions 1, 3, 4).  

So the secret word:
- Pattern: _ A _ _ S  
- Must contain A in position 2 and S in position 5.  
- Cannot contain: L, T, E, C, R, D, N, G, B, I.  
- Remaining letters allowed: F, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word fitting the pattern _ A _ _ S, using only the allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- F A K E S – E forbidden.  
- F A M I S – I forbidden.  
- F A M O S – O allowed: F, A, M, O, S.  
- H A M O S – H, A, M, O, S.  
- J A M O S – J, A, M, O, S.  
- K A M O S – K, A, M, O, S.  
- M A J O S – M, A, J, O, S.  
- P A P A S – P, A, P, A, S.  
- V A M O S – V, A, M, O, S.  
- W A M O S – W, A, M, O, S.  
- Y A M O S – Y, A, M, O, S.  

Among these, “FAMOS”, “HAMOS”, “JAMOS”, “KAMOS”, “MADOS”, “PAPAS”, “VAMOS”, “WAMOS”, “YAMOS” are all valid.  
The most common English word among them is “VAMOS” (Spanish for “let’s go”), but it is recognized in Scrabble dictionaries.  
Another strong candidate is “PAPAS”, but it has double A (position 2 and 4), which might be possible.  
However, “VAMOS” uses distinct letters (V, A, M, O, S) and fits the pattern perfectly with allowed letters.

Therefore, “VAMOS” is a strong next guess.",Guess 5: VAMOS -> FEEDBACK: V(x) A(✓) M(x) O(x) S(✓),FAIL

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives me a good spread of letters that appear frequently in English words, maximizing the chance of getting hits (either ✓ or -) that will guide my next guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1, so it must be in positions 2-5).
- L is not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3, so it must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- T is not in the word at all.
- E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains S and A.
- Does NOT contain L, T, or E.
- S is not in position 1.
- A is not in position 3.

I need a new word that uses S and A, avoids L/T/E, and places S somewhere other than position 1. A good candidate is ""CRASH"":
- C, R, A, S, H are all allowed letters.
- A is in position 3, but we know A is not in position 3, so this is invalid.
Next candidate: ""CHASE"" – but E is forbidden.
Next: ""SANDY"" – but S is in position 1, which is forbidden.
Next: ""STAND"" – T is forbidden.
Next: ""SPASM"" – S appears twice and is in position 1 (invalid).
Next: ""SALAD"" – A is in position 3 (invalid).
Next: ""SARAN"" – A is in position 3 (invalid).
Next: ""SCARS"" – S is in position 5 (allowed), A is in position 2 (allowed), no forbidden letters.
""SCARS"" seems valid.

Let me verify:
- S: in word, not in position 1 (it's in position 5) – OK.
- A: in word, not in position 3 (it's in position 2) – OK.
- C, R: no info, so OK.
- S appears twice, but that's allowed.

Guess 2: SCARS -> FEEDBACK: S(-) C(x) A(-) R(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)  
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.  
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.  
   - L, T, E are not in the word at all.

2. SCARS → S(-) C(x) A(-) R(x) S(✓)  
   - First S is still “in word but wrong place” (it was in position 1, so it must be 2–5).  
   - Second S is now “correct in position 5”.  
   - C and R are not in the word.  
   - A is again “in word but wrong place” (it was in position 3, so it must be 1, 2, 4, or 5).

So we now know the secret word:
- Ends with S (position 5).  
- Contains A somewhere other than positions 3 or 5.  
- Does NOT contain L, T, E, C, R.  
- Contains exactly one S (since the second S was marked ✓ in position 5).

Letters still allowed: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the single S at position 5.

We need a 5-letter word ending in S, with A somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4, and using only the allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- BAGAS (invalid – contains A in position 3)  
- DAGAS (invalid – A in position 3)  
- GAZAS (invalid – A in position 3)  
- PANSY (ends in Y) – wrong.  
- MANGO (ends in O) – wrong.  
- GAINS (ends in S, A in position 3) – invalid.  
- FANAL (ends in L) – invalid.  
- BANAL (ends in L) – invalid.  
- HAZAS (ends in S, A in position 2) – valid so far: H, A, Z, A, S. But A appears twice, and we don’t know if A appears twice.  
- BANAS (ends in S, A in position 2) – valid: B, A, N, A, S. Again double A.  
- MANAS (ends in S, A in position 2) – valid: M, A, N, A, S. Double A.  
- DANGS (ends in S, A in position 2) – valid: D, A, N, G, S. No double A.  
- PANSY (invalid – ends in Y).  
- KANGS (ends in S, A in position 2) – valid: K, A, N, G, S. No double A.  
- JANGS (ends in S, A in position 2) – valid: J, A, N, G, S. No double A.

Among these, “DANGS” and “KANGS” are both valid, but “DANGS” uses D, A, N, G, S – all allowed letters, with A in position 2 (allowed), and no forbidden letters.

From the three rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)  
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.  
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.  
   - L, T, E are not in the word.

2. SCARS → S(-) C(x) A(-) R(x) S(✓)  
   - First S is still “in word but wrong place” (positions 2–5).  
   - Second S is now “correct in position 5”.  
   - C and R are not in the word.  
   - A is again “in word but wrong place” (positions 1, 2, 4).

3. DANGS → D(x) A(✓) N(x) G(x) S(✓)  
   - A is now “correct in position 2”.  
   - S is “correct in position 5”.  
   - D, N, G are not in the word.

So we now know the secret word:
- Pattern: _ A _ _ S  
- Must contain A in position 2 and S in position 5.  
- Cannot contain: L, T, E, C, R, D, N, G.  
- Remaining letters allowed: B, F, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word fitting the pattern _ A _ _ S, using only the allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- B A S E S – E is forbidden.  
- F A C E S – C and E forbidden.  
- M A N S – too short.  
- P A P A S – P, A, P, A, S – P and A are allowed, but A appears twice. We don’t know if A appears twice, but the feedback only confirmed one A (in position 2). Still, it’s a valid word.  
- K A P P S – invalid (not a word).  
- H A P P Y – ends in Y.  
- M A C H O – ends in O.  
- B A B A S – invalid (not a common word).  
- F A I R Y – ends in Y.  
- B A I N S – N is forbidden.  
- B A S I S – S is already in position 5, and we don’t know if S appears twice.  
- P A P I S – invalid.  
- M A J O R – ends in R (forbidden).  
- B A J A S – invalid.  
- B A L L S – L is forbidden.  
- B A N K S – N is forbidden.  
- B A R R S – R is forbidden.  
- B A S K S – K is allowed, but S is already in position 5, and we don’t know if S appears twice.  
- B A S S – too short.  
- P A P A S – valid word: P, A, P, A, S. Pattern _ A _ _ S with P in positions 1 and 3, A in 2, and S in 5.  
- K A P P S – invalid.  
- J A C K S – C and K are allowed, but J, A, C, K, S – C is forbidden.  
- M A J E S – E is forbidden.  
- B A J E S – E is forbidden.  
- B A J A S – invalid.  
- B A S K S – K is allowed, but S is already in position 5.  
- B A S S – too short.  
- B A S I S – valid: B, A, S, I, S. Pattern _ A _ _ S with B in 1, A in 2, S in 5, and I in 4. No forbidden letters.  

Between PAPAS and BASIS, BASIS fits the pattern _ A _ _ S with allowed letters (B, A, S, I, S) and no forbidden letters. However, S appears twice, and we only confirmed one S (in position 5). Still, it’s a valid word. But BASIS has S in position 3 and 5, which might be possible.  

Another candidate: M A I Z E – ends in E (forbidden).  
M A I S – too short.  
M A I N S – N is forbidden.  
M A J O R – ends in R (forbidden).  
M A Z A S – Z is allowed, A in 2, S in 5: M, A, Z, A, S. Double A, but valid.  

But the simplest valid word fitting _ A _ _ S with allowed letters is BASIS: B, A, S, I, S.  

However, BASIS has S in position 3 and 5, which might be acceptable.  

But let’s check if there’s a word with single S in position 5 and A in position 2, and no other S.  

Pattern: _ A _ _ S  
Letters allowed for positions 1, 3, 4: B, F, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

Possible words:
- B A K E S – E is forbidden.  
- B A L K S – L is forbidden.  
- B A M B S – M, B, S – valid: B, A, M, B, S. Double B, but valid.  
- B A P S – too short.  
- B A R S – too short.  
- B A S S – too short.  
- B A T S – T is forbidden.  
- B A V I S – V, I, S – valid: B, A, V, I, S.  

BAVIS is not a common word.  

Another:  
- F A M I S – F, A, M, I, S. Valid word.  

FAMIS is not a common English word.  

The most common word fitting the pattern is BASIS.  

But BASIS has S in position 3 and 5.  

Alternative:  
- B A I S – too short.  
- B A K E S – E forbidden.  
- B A M B S – valid but double B.  

The best common word is BASIS.  

But let’s verify:  
B A S I S  
- B (allowed)  
- A (correct in position 2)  
- S (allowed)  
- I (allowed)  
- S (correct in position 5)  

No forbidden letters.  

Therefore, BASIS is a valid guess.

   - S is in the word but not in position 1.  
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

So the secret word:

- Cannot contain: L, T, E, C, R, D, N, G, B, I.

The most common English word among them is “VAMOS” (Spanish for “let’s go”), but it is recognized in Scrabble dictionaries.  
Another strong candidate is “PAPAS”, but it has double A (position 2 and 4), which might be possible.  
However, “VAMOS” uses distinct letters (V, A, M, O, S) and fits the pattern perfectly with allowed letters.

Therefore, “VAMOS” is a strong next guess.

From the five rounds of feedback we now know the secret word must:

- Be in the pattern _ A _ _ S (A in position 2, S in position 5).
- Cannot contain: L, T, E, C, R, D, N, G, B, I, V, M, O.
- Remaining letters allowed: F, H, J, K, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word fitting _ A _ _ S using only these letters.

Possible candidates:
- F A K E S – E forbidden.
- F A K U S – F, A, K, U, S. All letters allowed.
- H A K U S – H, A, K, U, S.
- J A K U S – J, A, K, U, S.
- P A P U S – P, A, P, U, S. Double P is possible.
- W A K U S – W, A, K, U, S.

The most common English word among these is “FAKUS” (an old spelling of “focus”), but “HAKUS” or “WAKUS” are also valid.  
Another strong candidate is “PAKUS”, but it’s less common.  
“FAKUS” is the best single guess that fits the pattern and uses only allowed letters.
