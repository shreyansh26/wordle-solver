For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- A: very common vowel
- R: common consonant
- O: common vowel
- S: very common consonant
- E: the most common letter in English

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, providing valuable information for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A (not in position 1) and E (not in position 5).

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A somewhere other than position 1.
2. Uses E somewhere other than position 5.
3. Avoids R, O, S entirely.
4. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and E are already known).

A balanced choice is ""TALEN"" (but N is okay, E is in position 4, A is in position 2). However, ""TALEN"" isn't a valid word. A valid word with similar properties is ""LEANT"":
- L, E, A, N, T.
- A is in position 3 (not 1), E is in position 2 (not 5).
- No R, O, S.
- Uses common letters L, N, T.

2. Use only letters we haven’t ruled out.
3. Include other high-frequency consonants to maximize information.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- A: very common vowel
- R: common consonant
- O: common vowel
- S: very common consonant
- E: the most common letter in English

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, providing valuable information for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains A (not in position 1) and E (not in position 5).
- Does NOT contain R, O, or S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A somewhere other than position 1.
2. Uses E somewhere other than position 5.
3. Avoids R, O, S entirely.
4. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and E are already known).

A balanced choice is ""TALEN"" (but N is okay, E is in position 4, A is in position 2). However, ""TALEN"" isn't a valid word. A valid word with similar properties is ""LEANT"":
- L, E, A, N, T.
- A is in position 3 (not 1), E is in position 2 (not 5).
- No R, O, S.
- Uses common letters L, N, T.

This seems optimal.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: R, O, S, L, N, T  
Letters that ARE in the word (but positions still unknown): A, E

We also know:
- A is not in position 1 (from AROSE) and not in position 3 (from LEANT).
- E is not in position 2 (from LEANT) and not in position 5 (from AROSE).

So A must be in position 2, 4 or 5, and E must be in position 1, 3 or 4.

Remaining common consonants to try: C, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

A good next word should:
1. Place A and E in allowed positions.
2. Use only letters we haven’t ruled out.
3. Include other high-frequency consonants to maximize information.

One candidate is “PEACH”:
- P, C, H are still allowed.
- E in position 1 (allowed).
- A in position 3 (allowed).
- No ruled-out letters.

This tests E in position 1 and A in position 3, plus introduces P, C, H.

- Letters not in the word: R, O, S, L, N, T, P, C, H, B, K
- Remaining letters to try: common consonants like G, M, F, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A in position 2.
2. Has E in position 4.
3. Has D in position 5.
4. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.
5. Has the first letter and third letter from the remaining pool.

Possible first letters (not ruled out): G, M, F, V, W, Y, etc.
Possible third letters: same pool, but must be different from first letter.

Looking for valid words matching the pattern _ A _ E D:
- F A M E D → ""FAMED"" – valid word.
- G A M E D → ""GAME D"" – not valid.
- V A M E D → ""VAMED"" – not valid.
- W A M E D → ""WAMED"" – not valid.
- G A M E D – invalid.
- F A M E D – valid.

""FAMED"" uses F, A, M, E, D. All letters are allowed (F and M haven't been tested yet). This fits the pattern perfectly.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- A: very common vowel
- R: common consonant
- O: common vowel
- S: very common consonant
- E: the most common letter in English

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, providing valuable information for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains A (not in position 1) and E (not in position 5).
- Does NOT contain R, O, or S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A somewhere other than position 1.
2. Uses E somewhere other than position 5.
3. Avoids R, O, S entirely.
4. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and E are already known).

A balanced choice is ""TALEN"" (but N is okay, E is in position 4, A is in position 2). However, ""TALEN"" isn't a valid word. A valid word with similar properties is ""LEANT"":
- L, E, A, N, T.
- A is in position 3 (not 1), E is in position 2 (not 5).
- No R, O, S.
- Uses common letters L, N, T.

This seems optimal.

Guess 2: LEANT -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: R, O, S, L, N, T  
Letters that ARE in the word (but positions still unknown): A, E

We also know:
- A is not in position 1 (from AROSE) and not in position 3 (from LEANT).
- E is not in position 2 (from LEANT) and not in position 5 (from AROSE).

So A must be in position 2, 4 or 5, and E must be in position 1, 3 or 4.

Remaining common consonants to try: C, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

A good next word should:
1. Place A and E in allowed positions.
2. Use only letters we haven’t ruled out.
3. Include other high-frequency consonants to maximize information.

One candidate is “PEACH”:
- P, C, H are still allowed.
- E in position 1 (allowed).
- A in position 3 (allowed).
- No ruled-out letters.

This tests E in position 1 and A in position 3, plus introduces P, C, H.

Current knowledge:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, L, N, T, P, C, H
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, E
- Position restrictions:
  – A cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4
  – E cannot be in positions 2, 5

Remaining legal positions:
- A must be in position 2 or 5
- E must be in position 1, 3, or 4

We still need three more letters (all different from the 9 ruled-out ones).  
Common remaining consonants: D, G, M, Y, B, K, F, V, W, etc.  
Vowel left: I, U (A and E already used)

Let’s construct a word that:
1. Places A in position 2 (most common remaining spot).
2. Places E in position 1, 3, or 4.
3. Uses three new, high-frequency consonants.

Candidate: E A _ _ _ with consonants D, G, M, Y…

A quick valid word: E A G L Y → “EAGLY” is not a recognized English word.  
Try “MEAGY” – but A is in position 3 (forbidden).  
Try “BEACH” – but C, H already ruled out.  
Try “WEDGE” – E in position 4, A not present (bad).  
Try “DEAFY” – A in position 3 (bad).  
Try “FEAST” – S, T already ruled out.  
Try “GAMED” – A in position 3 (bad).  
Try “VALED” – A in position 2, E in position 3, letters V, L, D: but L already ruled out.

Next best:  
A in position 2, E in position 1:  
E A _ _ _  
Valid word: E A R L Y – but R, L ruled out.  
E A R L Y → invalid.

A in position 2, E in position 3:  
_ A E _ _  
Valid word: G A M E R – but R ruled out.  
M A D E Y – but D, Y okay, M, D, Y not yet used.  
M A D E Y – but is it a word? “MADEY” not standard.  
Try “B A D E D” – but D repeated, and A in 2, E in 3.  
Try “B A D E N” – N ruled out.  
Try “B A D E R” – R ruled out.  
Try “B A D E D” – D repeated.  
Try “B A D E Y” – valid word “BADE Y”? No.

A in position 2, E in position 4:  
_ A _ E _  
Valid word: B A K E D – D okay, B, K okay, A in 2, E in 4.  
B A K E D – all letters allowed.  
Check positions:  
A is in 2 (allowed), E is in 4 (allowed).  
No ruled-out letters.

Therefore, “BAKED” is a valid next guess.

From Guess 5 (FAMED):
- F(x) – F is not in the word.
- M(-) – M is in the word but in the wrong position (position 3 in this guess).  
  Since position 3 has not yet been locked down, M could still be there, but it could also be in position 1.

So the word must be:
- Either M A M E D (but that repeats M and is invalid)  
- Or [some other allowed consonant] A M E D (but position 3 is already M, which we just saw is possible)  
- Or [some other allowed consonant] A [M or another consonant] E D, with M somewhere.

But the only remaining common consonants are G, V, W, Y.  
We need a 5-letter word that is _ A _ E D and contains M somewhere, with no ruled-out letters.

Valid English words that fit _ A _ E D and contain M:
- M A M E D – invalid (repeats M).  
- G A M E D – but M is in position 3, and M(-) means M is in the word but not in position 3. So GAMED is invalid because M would have to be in position 3.  
- V A M E D – same issue, M in position 3.  
- W A M E D – same.  
- Y A M E D – same.

Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that M is in position 1, giving M A _ E D.  
The only valid word that fits is M A D E D – but that repeats D.  
Next: M A G E D – but G hasn’t been ruled out, and this would place M in position 1, satisfying M(-) (since M was in position 3 before and now is in position 1).  
""MAGED"" is a valid English word (past tense of ""mag"" in some contexts, or ""magged"" as slang).

Let’s verify:
- M A G E D
