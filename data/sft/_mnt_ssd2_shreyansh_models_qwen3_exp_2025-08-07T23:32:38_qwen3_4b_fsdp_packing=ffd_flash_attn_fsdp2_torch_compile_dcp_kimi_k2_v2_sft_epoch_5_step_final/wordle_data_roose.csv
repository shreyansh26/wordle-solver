### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate many possibilities early on. 

Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A word like ""AROSE"" uses five very common letters and can provide good feedback about the presence of these letters. 

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it contains S, L, A, T, E which are all high-frequency letters. However, ""AROSE"" might be slightly better because it has A and O which are also very common vowels.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a well-balanced first guess covering several common consonants and vowels.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- O is in position 3 (✓)
- S is in position 4 (✓)
- E is in position 5 (✓)

So we know the word ends in OSE and has an R somewhere else, but not in position 2. The remaining letters to determine are positions 1 and 2.

Common letters not yet ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 3
- Has S in position 4
- Has E in position 5
- Has R somewhere except position 2
- Does not have A

Possible patterns: _ _ O S E with R in 1 or 3, but 3 is O, so R must be in 1 or 4 or 5. But 4 is S, 5 is E, so R must be in position 1.

Thus the word must be R _ O S E.

Common words fitting this: ROUSE, ROUSE is valid (archaic but accepted), ROUSE is actually a valid word meaning to rouse. Another is R O U S E - but let me think of others. R O U S E is correct.

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(✓) E(✓)
   - A is not in the word.
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
   - O, S, E are all in their correct positions (3,4,5).

2. ROUSE → R(✓) O(✓) U(x) S(✓) E(✓)
   - R is now confirmed in position 1.
   - O, S, E remain confirmed in positions 3,4,5.
   - U is not in the word.

So the word structure is:
R _ O S E

We need a 5-letter word that starts with R, has O in position 3, S in 4, E in 5, and does NOT contain A or U.

Possible letters for position 2: any letter except A, U, and the ones already used (R,O,S,E).

Common letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, T, V, W, Y.

Looking for valid words:
- R B O S E → no
- R C O S E → no
- R D O S E → no
- R F O S E → no
- R G O S E → no
- R H O S E → no
- R I O S E → no
- R K O S E → no
- R L O S E → no
- R M O S E → no
- R N O S E → no
- R P O S E → no
- R T O S E → no
- R V O S E → no
- R W O S E → no
- R Y O S E → no

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe position 2 is a vowel we haven't tried yet. The vowels left are I, Y (since A and U are out, and O is already in position 3).

Looking for R _ O S E with _ being I or Y:
- R I O S E → ""RIOSE"" - but this isn't a valid English word.
- R Y O S E → ""RYOSE"" - also invalid.

Hmm, maybe position 2 is a consonant. Let me check valid words:

Valid words fitting R _ O S E:
- ROUSE - already tried, U is out.
- R O B S E - no
- R O C S E - no
- R O D S E - no
- R O F S E - no
- R O G S E - no
- R O H S E - no
- R O I S E - no
- R O K S E - no
- R O L S E - no
- R O M S E - no
- R O N S E - no
- R O P S E - no
- R O T S E - no
- R O V S E - no
- R O W S E - no
- R O X S E - no
- R O Y S E - no
- R O Z S E - no

Wait, maybe the word is ""ROUSE"" but U is out. Then there's no valid word left? That can't be right.

Let me re-examine the constraints:
- R _ O S E
- No A, no U
- R is in position 1
- O, S, E are in positions 3,4,5

Looking up valid 5-letter words that fit R _ O S E:
- ROUSE - invalid (U)
- ROLES - but S is in position 4, not 5
- RITES - but T is in position 2, but then word would be R I T E S which doesn't fit OSE at end
- R O D S E - no
- R O B S E - no
- R O N S E - no
- R O P S E - no
- R O T S E - no
- R O G S E - no
- R O H S E - no
- R O K S E - no
- R O L S E - no
- R O M S E - no
- R O Y S E - no
- R O X S E - no
- R O Z S E - no

This seems like there's no valid word left. But that can't be right - there must be an error in my reasoning.

Wait, let me think of other words ending in OSE with R in position 1:
- ROUSE - U is out
- ROLES - doesn't end in OSE
- ROAST - A is out
- ROOSE - but O is already in position 3
- ROOSE - R O O S E - but O is in position 3, so this would have O in position 2 and 3, which is possible but ""ROOSE"" is valid (archaic for ""roast"")

But ""ROOSE"" would be R O O S E:
- R(✓) position 1
- O in position 2 - but we don't know if O appears twice
- O(✓) position 3
- S(✓) position 4
- E(✓) position 5

This fits all constraints:
- No A or U
- R is in position 1
- O is in position 3
- S in 4, E in 5
- O could appear twice

Thus, the next guess should be ROOSE.
</think>

Based on the feedback, we know:
- R is in position 1
- O is in position 3
- S is in position 4
- E is in position 5
- No A or U in the word

The only valid word fitting R _ O S E without A or U is ROOSE.

<guess>ROOSE</guess>",ROOSE,"From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(✓) E(✓)
   - A is not in the word.

   - O, S, E are all in their correct positions (3,4,5).

2. ROUSE → R(✓) O(✓) U(x) S(✓) E(✓)
   - R is now confirmed in position 1.
   - O, S, E remain confirmed in positions 3,4,5.

- R W O S E → no
- R Y O S E → no

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe position 2 is a vowel we haven't tried yet. The vowels left are I, Y (since A and U are out, and O is already in position 3).

Looking for R _ O S E with _ being I or Y:
- R I O S E → ""RIOSE"" - but this isn't a valid English word.
- R Y O S E → ""RYOSE"" - also invalid.

Hmm, maybe position 2 is a consonant. Let me check valid words:

Valid words fitting R _ O S E:
- ROUSE - already tried, U is out.
- R O B S E - no
- R O C S E - no
- R O D S E - no
- R O F S E - no
- R O G S E - no
- R O H S E - no
- R O I S E - no
- R O K S E - no
- R O L S E - no
- R O M S E - no
- R O N S E - no
- R O P S E - no
- R O T S E - no
- R O V S E - no
- R O W S E - no
- R O X S E - no
- R O Y S E - no
- R O Z S E - no

Wait, maybe the word is ""ROUSE"" but U is out. Then there's no valid word left? That can't be right.

Let me re-examine the constraints:
- R _ O S E
- No A, no U
- R is in position 1
- O, S, E are in positions 3,4,5

Looking up valid 5-letter words that fit R _ O S E:
- ROUSE - invalid (U)
- ROLES - but S is in position 4, not 5
- RITES - but T is in position 2, but then word would be R I T E S which doesn't fit OSE at end
- R O D S E - no
- R O B S E - no
- R O N S E - no
- R O P S E - no
- R O T S E - no
- R O G S E - no
- R O H S E - no
- R O K S E - no
- R O L S E - no
- R O M S E - no
- R O Y S E - no
- R O X S E - no
- R O Z S E - no

This seems like there's no valid word left. But that can't be right - there must be an error in my reasoning.

Wait, let me think of other words ending in OSE with R in position 1:
- ROUSE - U is out
- ROLES - doesn't end in OSE
- ROAST - A is out
- ROOSE - but O is already in position 3
- ROOSE - R O O S E - but O is in position 3, so this would have O in position 2 and 3, which is possible but ""ROOSE"" is valid (archaic for ""roast"")

But ""ROOSE"" would be R O O S E:
- R(✓) position 1
- O in position 2 - but we don't know if O appears twice
- O(✓) position 3
- S(✓) position 4
- E(✓) position 5

This fits all constraints:
- No A or U
- R is in position 1
- O is in position 3
- S in 4, E in 5
- O could appear twice

Thus, the next guess should be ROOSE.Based on the feedback, we know:
- R is in position 1
- O is in position 3
- S is in position 4
- E is in position 5
- No A or U in the word

The only valid word fitting R _ O S E without A or U is ROOSE.",Guess 3: ROOSE -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) O(✓) O(✓) S(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
