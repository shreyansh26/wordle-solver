### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain. The best strategy is to choose a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. This helps eliminate or confirm many possibilities at once.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word would use several of these letters without repeating any. 

""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A, R, O, S, E (5 unique letters)
- All are among the top 10 most common letters
- Covers vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants (R, S)
- No letter repeats, maximizing information gain

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain. The best strategy is to choose a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. This helps eliminate or confirm many possibilities at once.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word would use several of these letters without repeating any. 

""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A, R, O, S, E (5 unique letters)
- All are among the top 10 most common letters
- Covers vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants (R, S)
- No letter repeats, maximizing information gain

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all

So we know:
- Letters not in the word: R, O, E
- Letters that ARE in the word (somewhere): A, S
- A is not in position 1
- S is not in position 4

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and S
2. Does not contain R, O, E
3. Places A somewhere other than position 1
4. Places S somewhere other than position 4

Good next candidates would use other common letters (T, L, N, I, C, U, D, etc.) while satisfying these constraints.

A strong next guess is “STAIN”:
- Contains S and A
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since it’s not position 4)
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since it’s not position 1)
- Uses common letters T, I, N which haven’t been ruled out
- No R, O, E

From the two rounds of feedback we now have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1
   - S is in the word but not in position 4
   - R, O, E are not in the word

2. STAIN → S(-) T(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1
   - A is in the word but not in position 3
   - T, I, N are not in the word

Combining these constraints:
- Letters not in the word: R, O, E, T, I, N
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, S
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 3
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4

Remaining possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5  
Remaining possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and S
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (so no R, O, E, T, I, N)
- Places A and S in allowed positions

Common letters still allowed: C, D, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A good candidate is “SCALD”:
- Contains S and A
- S in position 1 is not allowed (from feedback), so this is invalid.

Next candidate: “SALAD”
- Contains S and A
- S in position 1 is not allowed → invalid.

Candidate: “ASIDE”
- Contains A and S
- E is already ruled out → invalid.

Candidate: “CASHY”
- Contains C, A, S, H, Y
- A is in position 2 (allowed)
- S is in position 3 (allowed)
- No ruled-out letters
- All letters are allowed

Therefore, “CASHY” is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain. The best strategy is to choose a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. This helps eliminate or confirm many possibilities at once.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word would use several of these letters without repeating any. 

""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A, R, O, S, E (5 unique letters)
- All are among the top 10 most common letters
- Covers vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants (R, S)
- No letter repeats, maximizing information gain

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all

So we know:
- Letters not in the word: R, O, E
- Letters that ARE in the word (somewhere): A, S
- A is not in position 1
- S is not in position 4

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and S
2. Does not contain R, O, E
3. Places A somewhere other than position 1
4. Places S somewhere other than position 4

Good next candidates would use other common letters (T, L, N, I, C, U, D, etc.) while satisfying these constraints.

A strong next guess is “STAIN”:
- Contains S and A
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since it’s not position 4)
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since it’s not position 1)
- Uses common letters T, I, N which haven’t been ruled out
- No R, O, E

Guess 2: STAIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1
   - S is in the word but not in position 4
   - R, O, E are not in the word

2. STAIN → S(-) T(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1
   - A is in the word but not in position 3
   - T, I, N are not in the word

Combining these constraints:
- Letters not in the word: R, O, E, T, I, N
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, S
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 3
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4

Remaining possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5  
Remaining possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and S
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (so no R, O, E, T, I, N)
- Places A and S in allowed positions

Common letters still allowed: C, D, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A good candidate is “SCALD”:
- Contains S and A
- S in position 1 is not allowed (from feedback), so this is invalid.

Next candidate: “SALAD”
- Contains S and A
- S in position 1 is not allowed → invalid.

Candidate: “ASIDE”
- Contains A and S
- E is already ruled out → invalid.

Candidate: “CASHY”
- Contains C, A, S, H, Y
- A is in position 2 (allowed)
- S is in position 3 (allowed)
- No ruled-out letters
- All letters are allowed

Therefore, “CASHY” is a valid next guess.

From the three rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1
   - S is in the word but not in position 4
   - R, O, E are not in the word

2. STAIN → S(-) T(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1
   - A is in the word but not in position 3
   - T, I, N are not in the word

3. CASHY → C(x) A(✓) S(-) H(x) Y(x)
   - A is in position 2 (✓) – now we know A is fixed in position 2
   - S is in the word but not in position 3
   - C, H, Y are not in the word

Combining all constraints:
- Letters not in the word: R, O, E, T, I, N, C, H, Y
- Letters that ARE in the word: A (fixed at position 2), S
- S cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 4
- Therefore S must be in position 5

So the word has the pattern:
_ A _ _ S

Allowed letters left (not yet ruled out): B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need to pick a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2
- Has S in position 5
- Uses only allowed letters in positions 1, 3, 4
- Is a valid English word

Looking at common words fitting _ A _ _ S:
- BAGEL – contains E (ruled out)
- BADLY – L is allowed, but D and L are allowed
- BADLY fits: B A D L Y – but Y is ruled out
- BAGGY – G, Y ruled out
- BALKS – B A L K S – K is allowed
- BALKS seems valid: B, A, L, K, S – all letters allowed
- Check positions: A in 2, S in 5 – matches constraints
