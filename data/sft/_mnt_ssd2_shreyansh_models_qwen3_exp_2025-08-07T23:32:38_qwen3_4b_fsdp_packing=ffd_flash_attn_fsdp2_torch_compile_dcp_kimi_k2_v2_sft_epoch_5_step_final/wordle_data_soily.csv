### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good first guess should include several of these to quickly eliminate or confirm many letters.

Some popular first guesses include:
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (contains C, R, I, S, P)

I'll choose ""STARE"" as it includes five very common letters (S, T, A, R, E) that appear frequently in English words.

The feedback tells us:
- S is in the word and in the correct first position.
- T, A, R, E are not in the word at all.

So the word starts with S and does not contain T, A, R, E.  
Remaining letters to explore should avoid T, A, R, E and still be common. Good candidates are: I, N, O, L, C, U, D, etc.

A strong next guess would be “SOUND” because:
- It keeps the known S in place.
- It introduces new common letters: O, U, N, D.
- None of these letters (O, U, N, D) were ruled out by the previous feedback.

From the two guesses we have:

1. STARE → S(✓) T(x) A(x) R(x) E(x)
   - First letter is S.
   - T, A, R, E are not in the word at all.

2. SOUND → S(✓) O(✓) U(x) N(x) D(x)
   - First letter is S (confirmed again).
   - Second letter is O (confirmed).
   - U, N, D are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: S O _ _ _
- Forbidden letters so far: T, A, R, E, U, N, D
- Remaining common letters to try: I, L, C, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, Y, W, V, X, Z, Q, J

We need a 5-letter word that starts with SO and uses none of the forbidden letters. Good candidates:
- SOLID (S, O, L, I, D) – but D is forbidden.
- SONGS – N is forbidden.
- SOILY – I, L, Y are allowed.
- SOCKS – C, K, S are allowed, but we already have S at the start and end.
- SOFTY – F, T, Y – T is forbidden.
- SOILY – S, O, I, L, Y – all allowed.

SOILY seems like a good choice because it introduces two new common letters (I, L) and ends with Y which is common.

Let me check another: SOGGY – G, G, Y are allowed, but double G might be less likely.
SOILY – S, O, I, L, Y – all letters are allowed and common.
