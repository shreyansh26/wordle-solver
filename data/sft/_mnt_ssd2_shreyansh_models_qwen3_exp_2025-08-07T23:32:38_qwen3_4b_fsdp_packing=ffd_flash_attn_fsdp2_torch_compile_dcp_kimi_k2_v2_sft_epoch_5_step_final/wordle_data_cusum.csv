### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English alphabet to maximize information gain. Common consonants like S, T, R, N, L and vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices. A popular starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the secret word and narrowing down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s not the first letter).
- L, A, T, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains S somewhere after the first letter.
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has S in positions 2-5.
2. Avoids L, A, T, E.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, G, H, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U.

A strong second guess is “SHORN”:
- S is in position 1 (but we know S is NOT in position 1 from feedback), so this is actually bad.  
Let’s pick “CRISP” instead:
- S is in position 4 (allowed, since S can be anywhere except position 1).
- Uses C, R, I, P – none of which are ruled out yet.

From all feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - L, A, T, E are absent.

2. CRISP → C(✓) R(x) I(x) S(-) P(x)
   - C is correct in position 1.
   - R, I, P are absent.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

3. COMBS → C(✓) O(x) M(-) B(x) S(-)
   - C is confirmed in position 1.
   - O and B are absent.
   - M is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Current knowledge:
- Pattern: C _ _ _ _
- Letters present: C (position 1), S (somewhere in positions 2, 3, 4), M (somewhere in positions 2, 4, 5)
- Letters absent: L, A, T, E, R, I, P, O, B

Remaining usable letters (consonants + vowels):
Consonants: D, F, G, H, K, N, V, W, Y
Vowels: U (only remaining vowel)

We need a 5-letter word starting with C, containing S and M, using only the remaining letters.

Possible positions for S and M:
- S can be in 2, 3, or 4
- M can be in 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3)

Let’s consider possible placements:

Case 1: S in position 2
   C S _ _ _
   Then M must be in 4 or 5
   - C S _ M _
   - C S _ _ M

Case 2: S in position 3
   C _ S _ _
   Then M must be in 2, 4, or 5
   - C M S _ _
   - C _ S M _
   - C _ S _ M

Case 3: S in position 4
   C _ _ S _
   Then M must be in 2 or 5
   - C M _ S _
   - C _ _ S M

Now, let’s look for valid words fitting these patterns using remaining letters (D, F, G, H, K, N, V, W, Y, U).

Looking at Case 1: C S _ M _
   Possible: C S U M D → ""CSUMD"" – not a word
   C S D M _ → need 5th letter
   C S D M Y → ""CSDMY"" – not a word

Case 2: C _ S M _
   C U S M _ → ""CUSMA"" – not a word

   C M U S _ – not a word

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English alphabet to maximize information gain. Common consonants like S, T, R, N, L and vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices. A popular starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the secret word and narrowing down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s not the first letter).
- L, A, T, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains S somewhere after the first letter.
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has S in positions 2-5.
2. Avoids L, A, T, E.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, G, H, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U.

A strong second guess is “SHORN”:
- S is in position 1 (but we know S is NOT in position 1 from feedback), so this is actually bad.  
Let’s pick “CRISP” instead:
- S is in position 4 (allowed, since S can be anywhere except position 1).
- Uses C, R, I, P – none of which are ruled out yet.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: CRISP -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) I(x) S(-) P(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - Letters L, A, T, E are absent.

2. CRISP → C(✓) R(x) I(x) S(-) P(x)
   - C is in position 1 and is correct.
   - R, I, P are absent.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 4 (and we already know it’s not in position 1).

So far we know:
- Word pattern: C _ _ _ _
- Letters present: C (fixed at position 1), S (somewhere in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5)
- Letters absent: L, A, T, E, R, I, P

Remaining consonants to try: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, V, W, Y
Remaining vowels to try: O, U

A good next guess should:
- Keep C in position 1.
- Place S in a new possible position (2, 3, 5).
- Use new letters from the remaining pool.

Let’s try S in position 2: C S _ _ _
We need two more letters from {B, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, V, W, Y, O, U}.

A common pattern is C S O N _ or C S O _ N, etc.  
Let’s pick “CROWN”:
- C(✓) in position 1.
- S is missing, so this doesn’t test S in position 2.  
Let’s try “COSMY” – but Y is less common.  
Better: “COSY” is 4 letters.  
We need 5 letters.

Let’s try “CLOUD” – but D is allowed, O, U, D are allowed, but we don’t have S.  
Let’s try “CUSHY” – but H and Y are allowed, but again no S.

We need to test S in position 2, 3, or 5.

Let’s try S in position 3: C _ S _ _
A common word: “CANSY” – but N is allowed, A is absent.  
“COBYS” – but B is allowed, O is allowed, Y is allowed, S is in position 5 here, not 3.

Let’s try S in position 5: C _ _ _ S
A word: “COMBS” – O, M, B are allowed, S is in position 5.  
Check letters: C, O, M, B, S – none are in the absent list.

This seems good.

From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

1. C is fixed in position 1.
2. S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 4, or 5.  
   Therefore S must be in position 2 or 3.
3. M is in the word but NOT in position 3.
4. Letters definitely absent: L, A, T, E, R, I, P, O, B.

So the pattern is:
C _ _ _ _ with S in position 2 or 3, and M somewhere else.

Possible patterns:
- C S _ _ _ with M in 3,4,5
- C _ S _ _ with M in 2,3,4,5 (but not 3)

Remaining consonants to try: D, F, G, H, K, N, V, W, Y
Remaining vowels to try: U

Let’s test S in position 2: C S _ _ _
We need three more letters, none of which are in the absent list.

Try “C S M _ _” (M in 3): “CSM??” – not a word.
Try “C S _ M _”: “C S U M _” – “CSUM?” – no.
Try “C S _ _ M”: “C S U N M” – “CSUNM” – no.

Try “C S U N D” – letters C,S,U,N,D – none absent, S in 2, M not used yet.

But we need to test M somewhere.  
Let’s try S in position 3: C _ S _ _
We need two letters before and after S, avoiding absent letters.

Try “C U S M _”: “CUSM?” – no.
Try “C U S H _”: “CUS?” – no.
Try “C U S D _”: “CUSD?” – no.

Try “C U S H Y” – letters C,U,S,H,Y – none absent, S in 3.

This seems valid.

But let’s prioritize placing M.  
Try “C U M S _”: “CUMS?” – no.
Try “C U M S Y” – “CUMSY” – not a word.

Try “C H U S M” – “CHUSM” – no.

Best valid word so far: “CUSHY” (C U S H Y) – S in 3, M not used, but we need to test M.

Another option: “C U S M Y” – “CUSMY” – not a word.

Try “C U S H Y” – valid, tests S in 3, uses H,Y.

Let’s go with that.

Try “C S M _ _” (M in 3): “CSM??” – not a word.
Try “C S _ M _”: “C S U M _” – “CSUM?” – no.
Try “C S _ _ M”: “C S U N M” – “CSUNM” – no.

Try “C S U N D” – letters C,S,U,N,D – none absent, S in 2, M not used yet.

But we need to test M somewhere.  
Let’s try S in position 3: C _ S _ _
We need two letters before and after S, avoiding absent letters.

Try “C U S M _”: “CUSM?” – no.
Try “C U S H _”: “CUS?” – no.
Try “C U S D _”: “CUSD?” – no.

Try “C U S H Y” – letters C,U,S,H,Y – none absent, S in 3.

This seems valid.

But let’s prioritize placing M.  
Try “C U M S _”: “CUMS?” – no.
Try “C U M S Y” – “CUMSY” – not a word.

Try “C H U S M” – “CHUSM” – no.

Best valid word so far: “CUSHY” (C U S H Y) – S in 3, M not used, but we need to test M.

Another option: “C U S M Y” – “CUSMY” – not a word.

Try “C U S H Y” – valid, tests S in 3, uses H,Y.

Let’s go with that.",Guess 5: CUSHY -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) U(✓) S(✓) H(x) Y(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English alphabet to maximize information gain. Common consonants like S, T, R, N, L and vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices. A popular starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the secret word and narrowing down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s not the first letter).
- L, A, T, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains S somewhere after the first letter.
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has S in positions 2-5.
2. Avoids L, A, T, E.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, G, H, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U.

A strong second guess is “SHORN”:
- S is in position 1 (but we know S is NOT in position 1 from feedback), so this is actually bad.  
Let’s pick “CRISP” instead:
- S is in position 4 (allowed, since S can be anywhere except position 1).
- Uses C, R, I, P – none of which are ruled out yet.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: CRISP -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) I(x) S(-) P(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - Letters L, A, T, E are absent.

2. CRISP → C(✓) R(x) I(x) S(-) P(x)
   - C is in position 1 and is correct.
   - R, I, P are absent.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 4 (and we already know it’s not in position 1).

So far we know:
- Word pattern: C _ _ _ _
- Letters present: C (fixed at position 1), S (somewhere in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5)
- Letters absent: L, A, T, E, R, I, P

Remaining consonants to try: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, V, W, Y
Remaining vowels to try: O, U

A good next guess should:
- Keep C in position 1.
- Place S in a new possible position (2, 3, 5).
- Use new letters from the remaining pool.

Let’s try S in position 2: C S _ _ _
We need two more letters from {B, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, V, W, Y, O, U}.

A common pattern is C S O N _ or C S O _ N, etc.  
Let’s pick “CROWN”:
- C(✓) in position 1.
- S is missing, so this doesn’t test S in position 2.  
Let’s try “COSMY” – but Y is less common.  
Better: “COSY” is 4 letters.  
We need 5 letters.

Let’s try “CLOUD” – but D is allowed, O, U, D are allowed, but we don’t have S.  
Let’s try “CUSHY” – but H and Y are allowed, but again no S.

We need to test S in position 2, 3, or 5.

Let’s try S in position 3: C _ S _ _
A common word: “CANSY” – but N is allowed, A is absent.  
“COBYS” – but B is allowed, O is allowed, Y is allowed, S is in position 5 here, not 3.

Let’s try S in position 5: C _ _ _ S
A word: “COMBS” – O, M, B are allowed, S is in position 5.  
Check letters: C, O, M, B, S – none are in the absent list.

This seems good.

From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

1. C is fixed in position 1.
2. S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 4, or 5.  
   Therefore S must be in position 2 or 3.
3. M is in the word but NOT in position 3.
4. Letters definitely absent: L, A, T, E, R, I, P, O, B.

So the pattern is:
C _ _ _ _ with S in position 2 or 3, and M somewhere else.

Possible patterns:
- C S _ _ _ with M in 3,4,5
- C _ S _ _ with M in 2,3,4,5 (but not 3)

Remaining consonants to try: D, F, G, H, K, N, V, W, Y
Remaining vowels to try: U

Let’s test S in position 2: C S _ _ _
We need three more letters, none of which are in the absent list.

Try “C S M _ _” (M in 3): “CSM??” – not a word.
Try “C S _ M _”: “C S U M _” – “CSUM?” – no.
Try “C S _ _ M”: “C S U N M” – “CSUNM” – no.

Try “C S U N D” – letters C,S,U,N,D – none absent, S in 2, M not used yet.

But we need to test M somewhere.  
Let’s try S in position 3: C _ S _ _
We need two letters before and after S, avoiding absent letters.

Try “C U S M _”: “CUSM?” – no.
Try “C U S H _”: “CUS?” – no.
Try “C U S D _”: “CUSD?” – no.

Try “C U S H Y” – letters C,U,S,H,Y – none absent, S in 3.

This seems valid.

But let’s prioritize placing M.  
Try “C U M S _”: “CUMS?” – no.
Try “C U M S Y” – “CUMSY” – not a word.

Try “C H U S M” – “CHUSM” – no.

Best valid word so far: “CUSHY” (C U S H Y) – S in 3, M not used, but we need to test M.

Another option: “C U S M Y” – “CUSMY” – not a word.

Try “C U S H Y” – valid, tests S in 3, uses H,Y.

Let’s go with that.

From the feedback so far:

- C is fixed in position 1.
- U is fixed in position 2.
- S is fixed in position 3.
- Letters H and Y are NOT in the word.
- Letters already ruled out: L, A, T, E, R, I, P, O, B, H, Y.

So the pattern is now:
C U S _ _

Remaining letters to fill positions 4 and 5 must come from the unused alphabet, excluding the ruled-out letters. Available consonants: D, F, G, K, N, V, W, M (M was confirmed present but not yet placed). Available vowels: none left except possibly none, since U is already used.

We know M is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from Guess 3 feedback), so M must be in position 4 or 5.

Possible words:
- C U S M D
- C U S D M
- C U S M K
- C U S K M
- C U S M N
- C U S N M

- CUSNM – not a word
- CUSGM – not a word
- CUSFM – not a word
- CUSVM – not a word

- CUSPS – P is ruled out
- CUSKS – K is allowed, but is CUSKS a word? No
- CUSUM – U is already in position 2, but CUSUM is valid (short for cumulative sum)
- CUSPS – P ruled out
- CUSKS – no
- CUSUM – yes, CUSUM is a valid word meaning cumulative sum

Let's check CUSUM:
- C U S U M
- Letters: C, U, S, U, M
- All letters are allowed (C, U, S confirmed; M confirmed present; U already used in position 2, but can repeat? Wait, no, U is already in position 2 and can't be elsewhere if we're strictly following the feedback which only shows U in position 2 as ✓, not that it can't appear elsewhere. However, CUSUM has U twice, which might be acceptable as the feedback didn't forbid duplicates.)

But let's think of other possibilities. Another word: CUSPY – but P and Y are ruled out. CUSKS – no. CUSDM – no.
