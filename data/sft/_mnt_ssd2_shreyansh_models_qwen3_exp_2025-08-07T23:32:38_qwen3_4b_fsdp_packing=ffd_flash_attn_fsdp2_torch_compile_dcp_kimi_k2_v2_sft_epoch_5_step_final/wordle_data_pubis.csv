For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Common choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that incorporates several of these. ""SLATE"" is a strong first guess because it contains S, L, A, T, E - covering many high-frequency letters in good positions. This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but not in position 1.
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses S (but not in position 1).
- Avoids L, A, T, E.
- Uses other common consonants and vowels.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, K, etc.
Good vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

Possible structure: S can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

Let me pick a word like ""SHORN"" - but H is less common. Maybe ""CRISP"" - but P is less common. ""SNICK"" - but K is less common. ""DRIPS"" - but P and S together might be good. Wait, let me think of a word with S in position 2 or later and using other common letters.

""SNORT"" - but T is out. ""SPURN"" - P, U, R, N are common. ""SPURN"" uses S in position 1 which is invalid. ""SOUND"" - but D is less common. ""FRISK"" - but F and K are less common. ""BRISK"" - but B is less common. 

""CRISP"" - C, R, I, S, P. Uses S in position 4, avoids L, A, T, E. Common letters. This seems good.

From the two guesses so far:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - L, A, T, E are not in the word.

2. CRISP → C(x) R(x) I(-) S(-) P(-)
   - C, R are not in the word.
   - I is in the word but not in position 3.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - P is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: S, I, P
- Letters not in the word: L, A, T, E, C, R
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
- I cannot be in position 3.
- P cannot be in position 5.

Remaining common letters: N, D, G, B, M, H, K, U, O, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S, I, P (each exactly once, since duplicates weren’t indicated).
- Avoids L, A, T, E, C, R.
- S must be in position 2, 3, or 5.
- I must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).
- P must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).

Let’s try to place these letters. A good candidate is “SPIND” but that’s not a valid word. “SPINK” is archaic. “SIP” is too short. “PIS” is too short. “PINS” is 4 letters. 

A valid word is “SPUNK”:
- S (pos 1) – but S cannot be in pos 1 (from SLATE feedback). So invalid.

Next: “PISID” – not a word. “PISOS” – has S twice. “PITHS” – has T (invalid). 

“SHIPS” – has S in pos 1 (invalid). 

“PIVOT” – has T (invalid). 

“SPICY” – has C (invalid). 

“SOUND” – lacks S, I, P. 

“SWORD” – lacks I, P. 

“SPUDS” – lacks I. 

“SPUNK” – S in pos 1 (invalid). 

“SINUS” – has S twice, lacks P. 

“SIPHS” – not a word. 

“PISAH” – not a word. 

“SPICY” – C invalid. 

“SPIND” – invalid. 

“SPUNK” – S invalid. 

“SWORD” – no I, P. 

“SIPHS” – invalid. 

“PITHS” – T invalid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Common choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that incorporates several of these. ""SLATE"" is a strong first guess because it contains S, L, A, T, E - covering many high-frequency letters in good positions. This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but not in position 1.
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses S (but not in position 1).
- Avoids L, A, T, E.
- Uses other common consonants and vowels.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, K, etc.
Good vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

Possible structure: S can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

Let me pick a word like ""SHORN"" - but H is less common. Maybe ""CRISP"" - but P is less common. ""SNICK"" - but K is less common. ""DRIPS"" - but P and S together might be good. Wait, let me think of a word with S in position 2 or later and using other common letters.

""SNORT"" - but T is out. ""SPURN"" - P, U, R, N are common. ""SPURN"" uses S in position 1 which is invalid. ""SOUND"" - but D is less common. ""FRISK"" - but F and K are less common. ""BRISK"" - but B is less common. 

""CRISP"" - C, R, I, S, P. Uses S in position 4, avoids L, A, T, E. Common letters. This seems good.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Common choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that incorporates several of these. ""SLATE"" is a strong first guess because it contains S, L, A, T, E - covering many high-frequency letters in good positions. This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but not in position 1.
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses S (but not in position 1).
- Avoids L, A, T, E.
- Uses other common consonants and vowels.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, K, etc.
Good vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

Possible structure: S can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

Let me pick a word like ""SHORN"" - but H is less common. Maybe ""CRISP"" - but P is less common. ""SNICK"" - but K is less common. ""DRIPS"" - but P and S together might be good. Wait, let me think of a word with S in position 2 or later and using other common letters.

""SNORT"" - but T is out. ""SPURN"" - P, U, R, N are common. ""SPURN"" uses S in position 1 which is invalid. ""SOUND"" - but D is less common. ""FRISK"" - but F and K are less common. ""BRISK"" - but B is less common. 

""CRISP"" - C, R, I, S, P. Uses S in position 4, avoids L, A, T, E. Common letters. This seems good.

- I is fixed in position 4.
- S cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4.

- U can be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (but 4 is I), so positions 2, 3, 5.

Let’s try to construct a word:
- Position 4 is I.
- S must be in 2 or 5.
- P must be in 1 or 3.
- U must be in 2, 3, or 5.

Case 1: S in position 2
   - _ S _ _ I
   - P must be in 1 or 3
   - U must be in 3 or 5
   - If P in 1: P S _ _ I → need two letters in 3 and 5, avoiding used letters (no L,A,T,E,C,R,D)

     Try P S U _ I → need a letter for position 5: P S U _ I → P S U N I (but N is allowed)

     - Positions: P(1) - allowed (P not restricted here), S(2) - allowed, U(3) - allowed, I(4) - correct, N(5) - allowed

     - P U _ I S → need a letter for position 3: P U _ I S → P U N I S (N allowed)
     - Check: P U N I S - all letters allowed, positions: P(1) ok, U(2) ok, N(3) ok, I(4) correct, S(5) ok
     This is also valid.

Between the two, P S U N I and P U N I S, both are valid, but P S U N I has S in position 2 which is allowed and uses N which is common.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Common choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that incorporates several of these. ""SLATE"" is a strong first guess because it contains S, L, A, T, E - covering many high-frequency letters in good positions. This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but not in position 1.
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses S (but not in position 1).
- Avoids L, A, T, E.
- Uses other common consonants and vowels.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, K, etc.
Good vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

Possible structure: S can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

Let me pick a word like ""SHORN"" - but H is less common. Maybe ""CRISP"" - but P is less common. ""SNICK"" - but K is less common. ""DRIPS"" - but P and S together might be good. Wait, let me think of a word with S in position 2 or later and using other common letters.

""SNORT"" - but T is out. ""SPURN"" - P, U, R, N are common. ""SPURN"" uses S in position 1 which is invalid. ""SOUND"" - but D is less common. ""FRISK"" - but F and K are less common. ""BRISK"" - but B is less common. 

""CRISP"" - C, R, I, S, P. Uses S in position 4, avoids L, A, T, E. Common letters. This seems good.

From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - L, A, T, E are not in the word.

2. CRISP → C(x) R(x) I(-) S(-) P(-)
   - C, R are not in the word.
   - I is in the word but not in position 3.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - P is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: S, I, P
- Letters not in the word: L, A, T, E, C, R
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
- I cannot be in position 3.
- P cannot be in position 5.

We need a 5-letter word that contains S, I, P and avoids L, A, T, E, C, R. The remaining common consonants are N, D, G, B, M, H, K, etc. and vowels are O, U.

Let’s try to place S, I, P in valid positions and fill the remaining spots with allowed letters.

Possible structure: _ _ _ _ _
- S can be in positions 2, 3, 5 (but not 1 or 4)
- I can be in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 (but not 3)
- P can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (but not 5)

Let’s try ""SPIND"":
- S in position 1 → invalid (S can't be in 1)
""SPINK"" - K is allowed, but S in 1 invalid
""PIPSY"" - Y is allowed, but S is in 4 which is invalid
""UPSID"" - U is allowed, S in 3, I in 4, P in 2
   - Letters: U, P, I, S, D
   - All letters are allowed (no L, A, T, E, C, R)
   - Positions: P(2), I(4), S(3) - all valid per feedback
This seems like a good candidate.

From the feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - L, A, T, E are not in the word.

2. CRISP → C(x) R(x) I(-) S(-) P(-)
   - C, R are not in the word.
   - I is in the word but not in position 3.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - P is in the word but not in position 5.

3. UPSID → U(-) P(-) S(-) I(✓) D(x)
   - U is in the word but not in position 1.
   - P is in the word but not in position 2.
   - S is in the word but not in position 3.
   - I is in the correct position (position 4).
   - D is not in the word.

Current knowledge:
- Letters in the word: S, I, P, U
- Letters not in the word: L, A, T, E, C, R, D
- I is fixed in position 4.
- S cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4.
- P cannot be in positions 2, 5.
- U cannot be in position 1.

Possible positions:
- S can be in positions 2 or 5.
- P can be in positions 1, 3, 4 (but 4 is I), so positions 1 or 3.
- U can be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (but 4 is I), so positions 2, 3, 5.

Let’s try to construct a word:
- Position 4 is I.
- S must be in 2 or 5.
- P must be in 1 or 3.
- U must be in 2, 3, or 5.

Case 1: S in position 2
   - _ S _ _ I
   - P must be in 1 or 3
   - U must be in 3 or 5
   - If P in 1: P S _ _ I → need two letters in 3 and 5, avoiding used letters (no L,A,T,E,C,R,D)
     Possible letters left: N, G, B, M, H, K, O, U
     Try P S U _ I → need a letter for position 5: P S U _ I → P S U N I (but N is allowed)
     Check: P S U N I
     - Letters: P, S, U, N, I - all allowed
     - Positions: P(1) - allowed (P not restricted here), S(2) - allowed, U(3) - allowed, I(4) - correct, N(5) - allowed
     This seems valid.

Case 2: S in position 5
   - _ _ _ I S
   - P must be in 1 or 3
   - U must be in 2 or 3
   - If P in 1: P _ _ I S → U must be in 2 or 3
     - P U _ I S → need a letter for position 3: P U _ I S → P U N I S (N allowed)
     - Check: P U N I S - all letters allowed, positions: P(1) ok, U(2) ok, N(3) ok, I(4) correct, S(5) ok
     This is also valid.

Between the two, P S U N I and P U N I S, both are valid, but P S U N I has S in position 2 which is allowed and uses N which is common.

Let me go with P S U N I.

   - N is NOT in the word.
   - I is in position 4 (already known).

So far we have:
- Letters in the word: P, S, I, U
- Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, C, R, D, N
- Fixed positions:
  – Position 1: P
  – Position 4: I
- Remaining positions: 2, 3, 5
- Constraints:
  – S cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 → but position 1 is P, and 4 is I, so S must be in position 5.
  – U cannot be in positions 1, 3 → so U must be in position 2 or 5.
  – Position 5 must be S (from S’s constraints), so U must be in position 2.
  – Position 3 is the only remaining slot; it must be a letter not yet ruled out and not already used (P, S, I, U). The remaining common consonants are B, G, H, K, M, O, etc.

Thus the word must be: P U _ I S

The missing letter (position 3) must be one of the remaining allowed letters. Common choices: B, G, H, K, M, O.

Let’s pick a common consonant: B. Word becomes P U B I S.

Check:
- P(1) ✓
- U(2) – allowed (not restricted here)
- B(3) – not ruled out
- I(4) ✓
- S(5) – allowed (S only restricted from positions 1,2,3,4; 5 is fine)
