For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices because they contain common vowels and consonants.

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E
- ""AROSE"" has A, R, O, S, E

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should give good coverage for identifying letters in the secret word.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word (✗):  
A, O, S, I, G, N

Positions ruled out for R:  
- Position 2 (from AROSE)

Positions ruled out for E:  
- Position 5 (from AROSE)  
- Position 2 (from REIGN)  

So R must appear in position 3, 4, or 5, and E must appear in position 1, 3, or 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both R and E exactly once each.  
- Uses none of the eliminated letters (A, O, S, I, G, N).  
- Places R in 3/4/5 and E in 1/3/4.  

Remaining common consonants and vowels we haven’t tried: B, C, D, F, H, L, M, P, T, U, Y, etc.

Let’s try a word that satisfies all constraints:  
“TREND”  
- T, D are new letters.  
- R is in position 3 (allowed).  
- E is in position 2 (allowed).  
- Contains neither banned letter.

Actually, E in position 2 was ruled out by REIGN feedback. So “TREND” is invalid.

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word (✗):  
A, O, S, I, G, N, T, B  

Letters definitely in the word (✓):  
U (position 2)  
E (somewhere)  
R (somewhere)  

Positions ruled out for E:  
- Position 5 (from AROSE)  
- Position 2 (from REIGN)  

Positions ruled out for R:  
- Position 2 (from AROSE)  
- Position 1 (from REIGN)  
- Position 5 (from TUBER)  

So:
- U is locked in position 2.  
- E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.  
- R must be in position 3 or 4 (since 1,2,5 are out).  

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has U in position 2.  
2. Contains both E and R exactly once.  
3. Uses none of the banned letters (A, O, S, I, G, N, T, B).  
4. Places E and R in the remaining valid positions.

Remaining common letters to try: C, D, F, H, L, M, P, Y, etc.

Let’s list possible patterns:
- E _ U R _  → but R must be in 3 or 4, so 4 is possible.  
- _ U E R _  
- _ U _ E R  
- E U _ R _  
- _ U R E _  

But U is fixed at position 2, so the word looks like:  
_ U _ _ _  

With constraints:
- E and R must occupy positions 1,3,4 or 5 (but E cannot be 5).  
- R cannot be 1,2,5 → must be 3 or 4.  
- E cannot be 2,5 → must be 1,3,4.  

Possible combinations:
1. E U R _ _  → but R must be 3 or 4, so 3 is ok.  
   Need two more letters (not banned).  
   Example: E U R _ _ → E U R _ _ → need two more letters.  
   Let’s try “EURAL” – but A is banned.  
   “EUPHR” – H and P are new, but R is already used.  
   “EUREKA” – A, K new but A banned.  

2. _ U E R _  
   First letter: not banned, not E, not R, not U.  
   Possible: C, D, F, H, L, M, P, Y.  
   Example: C U E R _ → need last letter.  
   “CURED” – D is new, E is already in, R is in.  
   Check letters: C, U, E, R, D – none banned.  
   Positions:  
   - C (1) – ok  
   - U (2) – ok  
   - E (3) – ok (not 5 or 2)  
   - R (4) – ok (not 1,2,5)  
   - D (5) – ok  

   This fits all constraints.

Therefore, “CURED” is a valid next guess.
