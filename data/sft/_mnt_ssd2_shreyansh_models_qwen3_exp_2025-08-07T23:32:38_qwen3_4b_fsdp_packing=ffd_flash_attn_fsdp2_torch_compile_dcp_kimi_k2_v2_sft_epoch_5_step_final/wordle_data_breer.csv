1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" uses S, L, A, T, E
- ""CRANE"" uses C, R, A, N, E
- ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E

I think ""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because it covers three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" uses S, L, A, T, E
- ""CRANE"" uses C, R, A, N, E
- ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E

I think ""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because it covers three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(✓) → R is in the word and in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
1. The word has R in position 2.
2. It contains E somewhere, but not at the end.
3. It does NOT contain A, O, or S.

We need a 5-letter word with R in position 2 and E somewhere else (positions 1, 3, or 4). Common consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, etc.

A good next guess would be ""TREND"":
- T is common and hasn’t been ruled out.
- R is in position 2 (matches known info).
- E is in position 3 (testing if E is in position 3).
- N and D are common consonants not yet tested.

This should give us more information about the remaining letters.

Current deductions:
- Position 2 is R (from both guesses).

- Letters ruled out so far: A, O, S, T, N, D.
- Remaining letters to test: common consonants like L, C, G, B, M, P, etc.

With E locked in position 3 and R in position 2, the pattern is: _ R E _ _

We need two more letters (positions 1 and 4) from the still-possible set. Good candidates: L, C, G, B, M, P, F, H, etc.

Let’s pick a word that fits _ R E _ _ and uses new common letters. ""C"" and ""L"" are frequent, so ""C R E E L"" isn’t valid (double E). ""B R E E D"" has D ruled out. ""F R E S H"" has S ruled out. ""P R E E N"" has N ruled out. 

A valid word: ""B R E W S"" – but S is out. ""G R E E T"" – T is out. ""P R E M I"" – not a word. 

Wait, ""B R E W S"" is invalid. Let’s try ""C R E E K"" – but double E and K hasn’t been tested. Actually, ""C R E E K"" is a valid word, but double E might not be helpful. 

Better: ""C R E E P"" – double E, P not tested. 

Another option: ""F R E S H"" – S out. 

Let’s try ""B R E W S"" – S out. 

""V R E A M"" – A out. 

""K R E E K"" – valid, K not tested.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" uses S, L, A, T, E
- ""CRANE"" uses C, R, A, N, E
- ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E

I think ""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because it covers three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(✓) → R is in the word and in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
1. The word has R in position 2.
2. It contains E somewhere, but not at the end.
3. It does NOT contain A, O, or S.

We need a 5-letter word with R in position 2 and E somewhere else (positions 1, 3, or 4). Common consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, etc.

A good next guess would be ""TREND"":
- T is common and hasn’t been ruled out.
- R is in position 2 (matches known info).
- E is in position 3 (testing if E is in position 3).
- N and D are common consonants not yet tested.

This should give us more information about the remaining letters.

Guess 2: trend -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) E(✓) N(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Current deductions:
- Position 2 is R (from both guesses).
- The word contains E (from arose) and now we see E in position 3 (from trend).
- Letters ruled out so far: A, O, S, T, N, D.
- Remaining letters to test: common consonants like L, C, G, B, M, P, etc.

With E locked in position 3 and R in position 2, the pattern is: _ R E _ _

We need two more letters (positions 1 and 4) from the still-possible set. Good candidates: L, C, G, B, M, P, F, H, etc.

Let’s pick a word that fits _ R E _ _ and uses new common letters. ""C"" and ""L"" are frequent, so ""C R E E L"" isn’t valid (double E). ""B R E E D"" has D ruled out. ""F R E S H"" has S ruled out. ""P R E E N"" has N ruled out. 

A valid word: ""B R E W S"" – but S is out. ""G R E E T"" – T is out. ""P R E M I"" – not a word. 

Wait, ""B R E W S"" is invalid. Let’s try ""C R E E K"" – but double E and K hasn’t been tested. Actually, ""C R E E K"" is a valid word, but double E might not be helpful. 

Better: ""C R E E P"" – double E, P not tested. 

Another option: ""F R E S H"" – S out. 

Let’s try ""B R E W S"" – S out. 

""V R E A M"" – A out. 

""K R E E K"" – valid, K not tested. 

But ""K R E E K"" has double E. 

A simpler word: ""C R E E K"" – but double E. 

Wait, let’s try ""G R E E T"" – T out. 

""R E E D S"" – D, S out. 

""R E P E E"" – not a word. 

Let’s try ""C R E E K"" – valid, uses C, K. 

But we might prefer a word without double E. 

""V R E A M"" – A out. 

""F R E S H"" – S out. 

""P R E E N"" – N out. 

""B R E E D"" – D out. 

""G R E E T"" – T out. 

""K R E E K"" – valid. 

Another approach: use L in position 4. ""B R E W L"" – W not tested. 

""B R E W L"" is valid. 

Let’s go with ""B R E W L"".

Current known facts:

- Pattern so far: B R E _ _
- Letters already ruled out (✗): A, O, S, T, N, D, W, L, C, K, F, Y

That leaves the following still-possible single letters for positions 4 and 5:
G, H, I, M, P, U

We need a real 5-letter English word of the form BRE?? that uses only these remaining letters.

Scanning the dictionary space:
- BREED – D out
- BRENT – N, T out
- BREWS – W, S out
- BRECK – C, K out
- BREFY – F, Y out
- BREHM – H is allowed, but M is allowed; the word “BREHM” is a surname/variant spelling of “Brahm” and is not common in standard word lists.

The only remaining common English word that fits the pattern B R E _ _ and uses only the still-allowed letters is:

B R E E D → but D is out  
B R E E N → N is out  
B R E E P → P is allowed; “BREEP” is not standard  
B R E E T → T is out  
B R E E K → K is out  
B R E E F → F is out  
B R E E Y → Y is out  

The only valid remaining word is “BREED,” but D is already ruled out.  
Next possibility: “BREHM” – though obscure, it is a valid 5-letter word.

However, the next most plausible word is “BREHM.”  
Since we have only one guess left and must choose a valid word, “BREHM” is the only remaining 5-letter word that fits the pattern B R E _ _ using the still-allowed letters G, H, I, M, P, U.

Therefore, the correct next guess is “BREHM.”
