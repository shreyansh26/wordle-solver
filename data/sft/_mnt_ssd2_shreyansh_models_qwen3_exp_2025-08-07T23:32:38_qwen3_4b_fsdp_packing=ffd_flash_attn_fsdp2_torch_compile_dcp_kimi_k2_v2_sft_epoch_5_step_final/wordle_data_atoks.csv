### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and the letters are all distinct, maximizing information gain.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and the letters are all distinct, maximizing information gain.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:

- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L is not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains S, A, T (each once).
- The word does NOT contain L or E.
- S is not first, A is not third, T is not fourth.

I want a word that:
1. Uses S, A, T in different positions.
2. Introduces new common letters (like R, N, I, O, etc.).
3. Avoids L and E.

A good candidate is ""STARS"":
- S in position 1 (but feedback says S is not first - so this is bad).
Next candidate: ""RASTY"" - but Y is less common.
Next: ""TRASH"" - uses T, R, A, S, H. T is first, which is allowed (feedback only said T is not fourth). S is fourth, A is second, all positions are new. R and H are new letters.

""TRASH"" seems good.

<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(-) E(x)
Guess 2: TRASH → T(-) R(x) A(-) S(-) H(x)

Key deductions:
- Letters definitely in the word: S, A, T (each exactly once).
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: L, E, R, H.
- Position constraints:
  – S is not in position 1 (SLATE) and not in position 4 (TRASH) ⇒ S must be in 2, 3, or 5.
  – A is not in position 3 (SLATE) and not in position 3 (TRASH) ⇒ A is not in position 3 ⇒ A must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.
  – T is not in position 4 (SLATE) and not in position 1 (TRASH) ⇒ T must be in 2, 3, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S, A, T exactly once each.
2. Does not contain L, E, R, H.
3. Places S in 2, 3, or 5; A in 1, 2, 4, or 5; T in 2, 3, or 5.
4. Uses two new letters (from the remaining alphabet excluding the forbidden ones).

Possible remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try to place the letters:
- If S is in position 2: Then A and T must go in 1,4,5 and 3,5 (but T cannot be in 1 and 4 is forbidden for T).  
- If S is in position 3: Then A can be in 1,2,4,5 and T can be in 2,5.  
- If S is in position 5: Then A can be in 1,2,4 and T can be in 2,3.

A promising arrangement is S in 3, T in 2, A in 1: A T S _ _.  
We need two new letters for positions 4 and 5.  
Common consonants left: N, D, M, C, etc.  
Let’s try “ASTON”:
- A(1), T(2), S(3), O(4), N(5).
- Contains S, A, T once each.
- No L, E, R, H.
- S in 3 (allowed), A in 1 (allowed), T in 2 (allowed).
- Uses O and N (new letters).

This seems valid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and the letters are all distinct, maximizing information gain.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:

- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L is not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains S, A, T (each once).
- The word does NOT contain L or E.
- S is not first, A is not third, T is not fourth.

I want a word that:
1. Uses S, A, T in different positions.
2. Introduces new common letters (like R, N, I, O, etc.).
3. Avoids L and E.

A good candidate is ""STARS"":
- S in position 1 (but feedback says S is not first - so this is bad).
Next candidate: ""RASTY"" - but Y is less common.
Next: ""TRASH"" - uses T, R, A, S, H. T is first, which is allowed (feedback only said T is not fourth). S is fourth, A is second, all positions are new. R and H are new letters.

""TRASH"" seems good.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: TRASH -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(x) A(-) S(-) H(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(-) E(x)
Guess 2: TRASH → T(-) R(x) A(-) S(-) H(x)

Key deductions:
- Letters definitely in the word: S, A, T (each exactly once).
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: L, E, R, H.
- Position constraints:
  – S is not in position 1 (SLATE) and not in position 4 (TRASH) ⇒ S must be in 2, 3, or 5.
  – A is not in position 3 (SLATE) and not in position 3 (TRASH) ⇒ A is not in position 3 ⇒ A must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.
  – T is not in position 4 (SLATE) and not in position 1 (TRASH) ⇒ T must be in 2, 3, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S, A, T exactly once each.
2. Does not contain L, E, R, H.
3. Places S in 2, 3, or 5; A in 1, 2, 4, or 5; T in 2, 3, or 5.
4. Uses two new letters (from the remaining alphabet excluding the forbidden ones).

Possible remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try to place the letters:
- If S is in position 2: Then A and T must go in 1,4,5 and 3,5 (but T cannot be in 1 and 4 is forbidden for T).  
- If S is in position 3: Then A can be in 1,2,4,5 and T can be in 2,5.  
- If S is in position 5: Then A can be in 1,2,4 and T can be in 2,3.

A promising arrangement is S in 3, T in 2, A in 1: A T S _ _.  
We need two new letters for positions 4 and 5.  
Common consonants left: N, D, M, C, etc.  
Let’s try “ASTON”:
- A(1), T(2), S(3), O(4), N(5).
- Contains S, A, T once each.
- No L, E, R, H.
- S in 3 (allowed), A in 1 (allowed), T in 2 (allowed).
- Uses O and N (new letters).

This seems valid.

From all feedback so far:

Known letters in the word: A, S, T (each exactly once).
Known letters NOT in the word: L, E, R, H, N.

Position constraints:
- A is in position 1 (✓).
- S is not in positions 1, 3, 4 ⇒ must be in 2 or 5.
- T is not in positions 1, 2, 4 ⇒ must be in 3 or 5.
- O is in the word but not in position 4 (from ASTON feedback).

We have:
A _ _ _ _ (fixed)
and need to place S, T, O in positions 2,3,4,5 with the constraints.

Possible placements:
- If S is in 2, then T must be in 3 or 5, and O must be in 4 or remaining slot.
- If S is in 5, then T must be in 3, and O must be in 2 or 4.

Let's explore:
Case 1: S in 2
A S T O _  → but T must be in 3 or 5, so A S T O _ is invalid (T would be in 3, but O is not in 4).
A S _ T O → T in 4 is invalid (T cannot be in 4).
A S _ O T → T in 5 is allowed, O in 4 is allowed (O is not in 4 from ASTON feedback, so this is invalid).

Case 2: S in 5
A _ _ _ S
Then T must be in 3: A _ T _ S
O must be in 2 or 4.
- A O T _ S → need a letter in 4 (not in forbidden list: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).
Possible: A O T C S (ATCOS? not a word), A O T I S (ATIOS? no), A O T M S (ATOMS) – ""ATOMS"" is a valid word.

Check constraints:
- A(1) ✓
- S(5) allowed (not in 1,3,4)
- T(3) allowed (not in 1,2,4)
- O(2) allowed (not in 4)
- Letters: A,T,O,S plus M (new, not forbidden).

""ATOMS"" satisfies all constraints.

From the feedback on ATOPS we now know:

- A(1) ✓, T(2) ✓, O(3) ✓, P(x), S(5) ✓  
  Therefore the word is A T O _ S with the blank letter not being P (and we already know it can’t be L, E, R, H, N, M).

Letters still allowed for position 4 (from the remaining alphabet):  
B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The only common 5-letter English word that fits A T O _ S is:

A T O B S  →  AT OBS – but that’s not a word.  
A T O C S – invalid.  
A T O D S – invalid.

Wait—there is one valid word: **ATONS**, but N is forbidden (from ASTON feedback).  
Next closest is **ATOGS** – invalid.  
**ATOS** is 4 letters.  
**ATOBS** – invalid.

Actually, the only valid English 5-letter word that matches A T O _ S is **ATONS**, but N was already ruled out.  
Therefore, the only remaining valid word is **ATOGS**? No, that’s not valid.

Rechecking: the correct word is **ATOPS** (already tried).  
But we have exhausted all possibilities.  
Upon reflection, the only valid word left is **ATONS**, but N is forbidden.
