For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters without repeating any. 

Some good options would be:
- ARISE (contains A, R, I, S, E)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it uses five very common letters and covers vowels and consonants well.

- I(x) – I is NOT in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.

So we know:
- The word contains R, S, E (each once).

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: ARISE → A(x) R(-) I(x) S(-) E(-)
- Letters known to be in the word: R, S, E
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, I
- R is not in position 2
- S is not in position 4
- E is not in position 5

Round 2: SOWER → S(✓) O(-) W(x) E(-) R(✓)
- S is now confirmed in position 1
- R is confirmed in position 5
- E is in the word but not in position 4
- O is in the word but not in position 2
- W is NOT in the word

Current known constraints:
- Word pattern: S _ _ _ R
- Must contain E (not in position 4 or 5) and O (not in position 2)
- Cannot contain A, I, W
- Letters used so far: S, R, E, O

Possible remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z

We need two more letters to fill positions 2 and 3, while respecting the constraints.

Let’s list possible positions:
- Position 2: cannot be O (since O is not in position 2)
- Position 3: no restrictions yet
- Position 4: E cannot be here, but O could be here
- Position 5: R is already fixed

Possible placements:
- E must be in position 2 or 3 (since it can’t be in 4 or 5)
- O must be in position 3 or 4 (since it can’t be in 2)

Let’s try to place E and O:
Option 1: E in position 2, O in position 3 → S E O _ R
Option 2: E in position 2, O in position 4 → S E _ O R
Option 3: E in position 3, O in position 4 → S _ E O R

Now, we need to pick the remaining letter(s) from the allowed set.

For Option 1: S E O _ R → need one letter for position 4. Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z
Let’s pick a common consonant: L → S E O L R → ""SEO LR"" – but ""SEO"" is not a valid start. Actually, ""SEOLR"" is not a word. Let’s think of real words.

Real words fitting S _ _ _ R:
- SPOOR – but P and O are allowed, but ""SPOOR"" is rare.
- SLOSH – but H is allowed, but we need to include E and O.
Wait, we need to include E and O in the word.

Let’s re-examine:
We know the word must contain S, E, O, R (with S in 1 and R in 5), and one more letter.

So possible patterns:
- S E O _ R
- S E _ O R
- S _ E O R

Looking for real 5-letter words:
- S E O _ R: ""SEONS"" – but N is allowed, but ""SEONS"" is not a word.
- S E _ O R: ""SEPOR"" – not a word.
- S _ E O R: ""SCOOR"" – not a word.

Let me think differently: maybe the word is S _ E O R or S _ _ E R (but E can't be in 4).

Wait, E cannot be in position 4 (from feedback), and cannot be in 5 (already R). So E must be in 2 or 3.

O cannot be in 2, so O must be in 3 or 4.

Let’s try:
- S _ E O R: This would require position 2 to be a letter not yet used, not O, and not A/I/W.
Possible: S T E O R → ""STEAR"" – not a word.
S N E O R – not a word.
S L E O R – ""SLEOR"" – not a word.

Another approach: list possible 5-letter words starting with S and ending with R, containing E and O, and excluding A, I, W.

Possible candidates:
- S O E _ R – but O cannot be in position 2.
- S _ O E R – but E cannot be in position 4.
- S _ E O R – this seems the only viable pattern.

Looking up, ""SPOER"" – not a word.
""SPOOR"" – archaic spelling, but valid.
""SLOER"" – not a word.
""SMEOR"" – not a word.

Another candidate: ""SOWER"" was already used.
""SPOER"" – not valid.

Wait, let me think of ""SORE"" plus one letter, but we need 5 letters.

Actually, let me consider ""SCORE"" – but it ends with E, not R.

Wait, the word must be S _ _ _ R with E and O somewhere in positions 2-4.

Let me think systematically:
Letters: S (1), ?, ?, ?, R (5)
Must include E and O in positions 2,3,4 with constraints:
- E not in 4 or 5
- O not in 2
So possible positions:
E can be 2 or 3
O can be 3 or 4
And they cannot both be in the same position.

Case 1: E in 2, O in 3 or 4
- S E O _ R → need position 4: valid word? ""SEONS"" – no
- S E _ O R → need position 3: ""SEPOR"" – no

Case 2: E in 3, O in 4
- S _ E O R → need position 2: ""S T E O R"" – ""STEAR"" – no
""S N E O R"" – no
""S L E O R"" – no
""S P E O R"" – ""SPEOR"" – no
""S C E O R"" – ""SCEOR"" – no
""S M E O R"" – ""SMEAR"" – yes! ""SMEAR"" is a valid word.

Check constraints:
- S in 1: ✓
- M: new letter, allowed
- E in 3: allowed (not 4 or 5)
- A: not present, ok
- R in 5: ✓
- Contains O in 4: allowed (not in 2)
- No A, I, W
- Contains required R, S, E, O

""SMEAR"" fits all constraints.

Round 1: ARISE → A(x) R(-) I(x) S(-) E(-)
- Letters known to be in the word: R, S, E
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, I
- R is not in position 2
- S is not in position 4
- E is not in position 5

Round 2: SOWER → S(✓) O(-) W(x) E(-) R(✓)
- S is now confirmed in position 1
- R is confirmed in position 5
- E is in the word but not in position 4
- O is in the word but not in position 2
- W is NOT in the word

Current known constraints:
- Word pattern: S _ _ _ R
- Must contain E (not in position 4 or 5) and O (not in position 2)
- Cannot contain A, I, W
- Letters used so far: S, R, E, O

Possible remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z

We need two more letters to fill positions 2 and 3, while respecting the constraints.

Let’s list possible positions:
- Position 2: cannot be O (since O is not in position 2)
- Position 3: no restrictions yet
- Position 4: E cannot be here, but O could be here
- Position 5: R is already fixed

Possible placements:
- E must be in position 2 or 3 (since it can’t be in 4 or 5)
- O must be in position 3 or 4 (since it can’t be in 2)

Let’s try to place E and O:
Option 1: E in position 2, O in position 3 → S E O _ R
Option 2: E in position 2, O in position 4 → S E _ O R
Option 3: E in position 3, O in position 4 → S _ E O R

Now, we need to pick the remaining letter(s) from the allowed set.

For Option 1: S E O _ R → need one letter for position 4. Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z
Let’s pick a common consonant: L → S E O L R → ""SEO LR"" – but ""SEO"" is not a valid start. Actually, ""SEOLR"" is not a word. Let’s think of real words.

Real words fitting S _ _ _ R:
- SPOOR – but P and O are allowed, but ""SPOOR"" is rare.
- SLOSH – but H is allowed, but we need to include E and O.
Wait, we need to include E and O in the word.

Let’s re-examine:
We know the word must contain S, E, O, R (with S in 1 and R in 5), and one more letter.

So possible patterns:
- S E O _ R
- S E _ O R
- S _ E O R

Looking for real 5-letter words:
- S E O _ R: ""SEONS"" – but N is allowed, but ""SEONS"" is not a word.
- S E _ O R: ""SEPOR"" – not a word.
- S _ E O R: ""SCOOR"" – not a word.

Let me think differently: maybe the word is S _ E O R or S _ _ E R (but E can't be in 4).

Wait, E cannot be in position 4 (from feedback), and cannot be in 5 (already R). So E must be in 2 or 3.

O cannot be in 2, so O must be in 3 or 4.

Let’s try:
- S _ E O R: This would require position 2 to be a letter not yet used, not O, and not A/I/W.
Possible: S T E O R → ""STEAR"" – not a word.
S N E O R – not a word.
S L E O R – ""SLEOR"" – not a word.

Another approach: list possible 5-letter words starting with S and ending with R, containing E and O, and excluding A, I, W.

Possible candidates:
- S O E _ R – but O cannot be in position 2.
- S _ O E R – but E cannot be in position 4.
- S _ E O R – this seems the only viable pattern.

Looking up, ""SPOER"" – not a word.
""SPOOR"" – archaic spelling, but valid.
""SLOER"" – not a word.
""SMEOR"" – not a word.

Another candidate: ""SOWER"" was already used.
""SPOER"" – not valid.

Wait, let me think of ""SORE"" plus one letter, but we need 5 letters.

Actually, let me consider ""SCORE"" – but it ends with E, not R.

Wait, the word must be S _ _ _ R with E and O somewhere in positions 2-4.

Let me think systematically:
Letters: S (1), ?, ?, ?, R (5)
Must include E and O in positions 2,3,4 with constraints:
- E not in 4 or 5
- O not in 2
So possible positions:
E can be 2 or 3
O can be 3 or 4
And they cannot both be in the same position.

Case 1: E in 2, O in 3 or 4
- S E O _ R → need position 4: valid word? ""SEONS"" – no
- S E _ O R → need position 3: ""SEPOR"" – no

Case 2: E in 3, O in 4
- S _ E O R → need position 2: ""S T E O R"" – ""STEAR"" – no
""S N E O R"" – no
""S L E O R"" – no
""S P E O R"" – ""SPEOR"" – no
""S C E O R"" – ""SCEOR"" – no
""S M E O R"" – ""SMEAR"" – yes! ""SMEAR"" is a valid word.

Check constraints:
- S in 1: ✓
- M: new letter, allowed
- E in 3: allowed (not 4 or 5)
- A: not present, ok
- R in 5: ✓
- Contains O in 4: allowed (not in 2)
- No A, I, W
- Contains required R, S, E, O

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters without repeating any. 

Some good options would be:
- ARISE (contains A, R, I, S, E)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it uses five very common letters and covers vowels and consonants well.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) I(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ARISE:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- I(x) – I is NOT in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word contains R, S, E (each once).
- It does NOT contain A or I.
- R cannot be in position 2.
- S cannot be in position 4.
- E cannot be in position 5.

I need a new 5-letter word that uses R, S, E plus two other letters (not A or I), while respecting the positional constraints.

Let’s try to place R, S, E in new positions and pick two new consonants or vowels (excluding A and I). Good candidates: O, T, N, L, C, D, U, etc.

One word that fits: “STORE”
- Letters: S, T, O, R, E
- Contains R, S, E
- R is in position 4 (allowed, since original R was in position 2)
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since original S was in position 4)
- E is in position 5 (but original E was in position 5, and feedback says E is in word but not in position 5) – so E cannot be in position 5, so STORE is invalid.

Next candidate: “ROUSE”
- Letters: R, O, U, S, E
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- S in position 4 – but original S was in position 4 and feedback said S is in word but not in position 4 – so invalid.

Next: “CREST”
- Letters: C, R, E, S, T
- R in position 2 – original R was in position 2 and feedback said R is in word but not in position 2 – so invalid.

Next: “RESUR” – not a valid word.

Next: “SOWER”
- Letters: S, O, W, E, R
- S in position 1 (allowed)
- E in position 4 (allowed, since original E was in position 5)
- R in position 5 (allowed, since original R was in position 2)
- O and W are new letters.

This seems valid. Let’s check:
- Contains R, S, E
- R not in position 2
- S not in position 4
- E not in position 5
- No A or I

Possible remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z

Let's consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Known facts
1. The word is S _ _ _ R (positions 1 and 5 are locked).
2. It must contain the letters E and O somewhere in positions 2-4.
3. It cannot contain A, I, M, W.
4. Positional restrictions:
   - E is not in position 3 or 5 (already excluded from 5 by earlier feedback, and from 3 by SMEAR feedback).
   - O is not in position 2.

So E must be in position 2 or 4, and O must be in position 3 or 4, but they cannot both be in 4. This gives us two mutually exclusive patterns:

Pattern A: E in 2, O in 3   → S E O _ R
Pattern B: E in 2, O in 4   → S E _ O R
Pattern C: E in 4, O in 3   → S _ O E R

We need to fill the single blank with a letter that is:
- not A, I, M, W
- not already used (S, E, O, R)

Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, N, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z

Real 5-letter words that fit:
- Pattern A: S E O _ R → ""SEONS"" (not a word), ""SEONS"" (no), ""SEONS"" (no) – nothing valid
- Pattern B: S E _ O R → ""SEPOR"" (no), ""SEBOR"" (no), ""SECOR"" (no) – nothing valid
- Pattern C: S _ O E R → ""SPOER"" (no), ""SCOER"" (no), ""STOER"" (no), ""SLOER"" (no) – nothing valid

Wait, let me re-examine Pattern B more carefully. The blank is position 3, and we need a valid consonant.

Looking at ""SE _ OR"" possibilities:
- ""SEPOR"" – no
- ""SEBOR"" – no
- ""SECOR"" – no
- ""SEGOR"" – no

Pattern C: ""S _ O E R"" – possible words:
- ""SPOER"" – no
- ""SCOER"" – no
- ""STOER"" – no
- ""SLOER"" – no
- ""SNEOR"" – no

Hmm, none of these are valid. Let me double-check Pattern A: ""SE O _ R"".

Possible letters for position 4:
- ""SEONS"" – no
- ""SEONS"" – no
- ""SEONS"" – no

This suggests I may have missed a valid word. Let me think differently: perhaps ""SPOOR"" (archaic but valid) or ""SLOSH"" (but lacks E).

Wait, let me try ""SPOOR"":
- S P O O R – but this has two O's, which is allowed, but we only know one O is in the word. Also, E must be present.

Realizing I overlooked: ""SPOOR"" lacks E, so invalid.

Let me try ""SCORE"":
- S C O R E – but ends with E, not R.

Actually, the only viable pattern seems to be Pattern C with a different consonant.

Looking again: ""S _ O E R"" – the missing letter must be a consonant not yet excluded.

Let me try ""STOER"" – not a word.
""SLOER"" – no.
""SNORE"" – ends with E, not R.
""SCOPE"" – ends with E.
""SPORE"" – ends with E.

Wait, let me consider ""SPOOR"" again – but it lacks E.

Realizing I missed: ""SPOOR"" is invalid because it lacks E. 

Let me try ""SHEOR"" – no.
""SHOER"" – ends with R but has H and O and E in positions 3 and 4:
- S H O E R – this is ""SHOER"", a valid word meaning one who shaves.

Check constraints:
- S in 1: ✓
- H: new letter, allowed
- O in 3: allowed (not in 2)
- E in 4: allowed (not in 3 or 5)
- R in 5: ✓
- Contains required letters: S, E, O, R

This fits perfectly.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters without repeating any. 

Some good options would be:
- ARISE (contains A, R, I, S, E)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it uses five very common letters and covers vowels and consonants well.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) I(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ARISE:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- I(x) – I is NOT in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word contains R, S, E (each once).
- It does NOT contain A or I.
- R cannot be in position 2.
- S cannot be in position 4.
- E cannot be in position 5.

I need a new 5-letter word that uses R, S, E plus two other letters (not A or I), while respecting the positional constraints.

Let’s try to place R, S, E in new positions and pick two new consonants or vowels (excluding A and I). Good candidates: O, T, N, L, C, D, U, etc.

One word that fits: “STORE”
- Letters: S, T, O, R, E
- Contains R, S, E
- R is in position 4 (allowed, since original R was in position 2)
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since original S was in position 4)
- E is in position 5 (but original E was in position 5, and feedback says E is in word but not in position 5) – so E cannot be in position 5, so STORE is invalid.

Next candidate: “ROUSE”
- Letters: R, O, U, S, E
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- S in position 4 – but original S was in position 4 and feedback said S is in word but not in position 4 – so invalid.

Next: “CREST”
- Letters: C, R, E, S, T
- R in position 2 – original R was in position 2 and feedback said R is in word but not in position 2 – so invalid.

Next: “RESUR” – not a valid word.

Next: “SOWER”
- Letters: S, O, W, E, R
- S in position 1 (allowed)
- E in position 4 (allowed, since original E was in position 5)
- R in position 5 (allowed, since original R was in position 2)
- O and W are new letters.

This seems valid. Let’s check:
- Contains R, S, E
- R not in position 2
- S not in position 4
- E not in position 5
- No A or I

Guess 2: SOWER -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(-) W(x) E(-) R(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: ARISE → A(x) R(-) I(x) S(-) E(-)
- Letters known to be in the word: R, S, E
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, I
- R is not in position 2
- S is not in position 4
- E is not in position 5

Round 2: SOWER → S(✓) O(-) W(x) E(-) R(✓)
- S is now confirmed in position 1
- R is confirmed in position 5
- E is in the word but not in position 4
- O is in the word but not in position 2
- W is NOT in the word

Current known constraints:
- Word pattern: S _ _ _ R
- Must contain E (not in position 4 or 5) and O (not in position 2)
- Cannot contain A, I, W
- Letters used so far: S, R, E, O

Possible remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z

We need two more letters to fill positions 2 and 3, while respecting the constraints.

Let’s list possible positions:
- Position 2: cannot be O (since O is not in position 2)
- Position 3: no restrictions yet
- Position 4: E cannot be here, but O could be here
- Position 5: R is already fixed

Possible placements:
- E must be in position 2 or 3 (since it can’t be in 4 or 5)
- O must be in position 3 or 4 (since it can’t be in 2)

Let’s try to place E and O:
Option 1: E in position 2, O in position 3 → S E O _ R
Option 2: E in position 2, O in position 4 → S E _ O R
Option 3: E in position 3, O in position 4 → S _ E O R

Now, we need to pick the remaining letter(s) from the allowed set.

For Option 1: S E O _ R → need one letter for position 4. Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z
Let’s pick a common consonant: L → S E O L R → ""SEO LR"" – but ""SEO"" is not a valid start. Actually, ""SEOLR"" is not a word. Let’s think of real words.

Real words fitting S _ _ _ R:
- SPOOR – but P and O are allowed, but ""SPOOR"" is rare.
- SLOSH – but H is allowed, but we need to include E and O.
Wait, we need to include E and O in the word.

Let’s re-examine:
We know the word must contain S, E, O, R (with S in 1 and R in 5), and one more letter.

So possible patterns:
- S E O _ R
- S E _ O R
- S _ E O R

Looking for real 5-letter words:
- S E O _ R: ""SEONS"" – but N is allowed, but ""SEONS"" is not a word.
- S E _ O R: ""SEPOR"" – not a word.
- S _ E O R: ""SCOOR"" – not a word.

Let me think differently: maybe the word is S _ E O R or S _ _ E R (but E can't be in 4).

Wait, E cannot be in position 4 (from feedback), and cannot be in 5 (already R). So E must be in 2 or 3.

O cannot be in 2, so O must be in 3 or 4.

Let’s try:
- S _ E O R: This would require position 2 to be a letter not yet used, not O, and not A/I/W.
Possible: S T E O R → ""STEAR"" – not a word.
S N E O R – not a word.
S L E O R – ""SLEOR"" – not a word.

Another approach: list possible 5-letter words starting with S and ending with R, containing E and O, and excluding A, I, W.

Possible candidates:
- S O E _ R – but O cannot be in position 2.
- S _ O E R – but E cannot be in position 4.
- S _ E O R – this seems the only viable pattern.

Looking up, ""SPOER"" – not a word.
""SPOOR"" – archaic spelling, but valid.
""SLOER"" – not a word.
""SMEOR"" – not a word.

Another candidate: ""SOWER"" was already used.
""SPOER"" – not valid.

Wait, let me think of ""SORE"" plus one letter, but we need 5 letters.

Actually, let me consider ""SCORE"" – but it ends with E, not R.

Wait, the word must be S _ _ _ R with E and O somewhere in positions 2-4.

Let me think systematically:
Letters: S (1), ?, ?, ?, R (5)
Must include E and O in positions 2,3,4 with constraints:
- E not in 4 or 5
- O not in 2
So possible positions:
E can be 2 or 3
O can be 3 or 4
And they cannot both be in the same position.

Case 1: E in 2, O in 3 or 4
- S E O _ R → need position 4: valid word? ""SEONS"" – no
- S E _ O R → need position 3: ""SEPOR"" – no

Case 2: E in 3, O in 4
- S _ E O R → need position 2: ""S T E O R"" – ""STEAR"" – no
""S N E O R"" – no
""S L E O R"" – no
""S P E O R"" – ""SPEOR"" – no
""S C E O R"" – ""SCEOR"" – no
""S M E O R"" – ""SMEAR"" – yes! ""SMEAR"" is a valid word.

Check constraints:
- S in 1: ✓
- M: new letter, allowed
- E in 3: allowed (not 4 or 5)
- A: not present, ok
- R in 5: ✓
- Contains O in 4: allowed (not in 2)
- No A, I, W
- Contains required R, S, E, O

""SMEAR"" fits all constraints.

Let’s update what we now know after four guesses.

Known facts
1. Word pattern: S _ _ _ R
2. Must contain E and O in positions 2-4.
3. Cannot contain A, I, M, W, H.
4. Positional restrictions:
   - E is not in position 3, 4, or 5 (from SMEAR and SHOER feedback).
   - O is not in position 2 or 3 (from SOWER and SHOER feedback).

Therefore:
- E must be in position 2 (only remaining spot).
- O must be in position 4 (only remaining spot).

This gives the unique pattern:
S E _ O R

We need a single letter for position 3 that:
- is not A, I, M, W, H
- is not already used (S, E, O, R)

Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, K, L, N, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z

Looking for real 5-letter words of the form S E _ O R:
- ""SEBOR"" – no
- ""SEPOR"" – no
- ""SEGOR"" – no
- ""SEFOR"" – no
- ""SECOR"" – no
- ""SEGOR"" – no
- ""SEPOR"" – no
- ""SEBOR"" – no

Wait, let me systematically check:
- ""SEB OR"" – ""SEBOR"" – not a word
- ""SE C OR"" – ""SECOR"" – not a word
- ""SE D OR"" – ""SEDOR"" – not a word
- ""SE F OR"" – ""SEFOR"" – not a word
- ""SE G OR"" – ""SEGOR"" – not a word
- ""SE K OR"" – ""SEKOR"" – not a word
- ""SE L OR"" – ""SELOR"" – not a word
- ""SE N OR"" – ""SENOR"" – not a word
- ""SE P OR"" – ""SEPOR"" – not a word
- ""SE T OR"" – ""SETOR"" – not a word

Hmm, none of these are valid. Let me double-check if I missed any letters.

Actually, the correct word is ""SEPOR"" – but it’s not in common dictionaries. 

Wait, let me try ""SEFOR"" – no.

Realizing I missed ""SEPOR"" is not valid. 

Let me try ""SEGOR"" – no.

This suggests I may have missed a valid word. Let me think differently: ""SEPOR"" is not valid, but ""SEFOR"" is not valid either.

Let me try ""SEB OR"" – no.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters without repeating any. 

Some good options would be:
- ARISE (contains A, R, I, S, E)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it uses five very common letters and covers vowels and consonants well.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) I(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ARISE:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- I(x) – I is NOT in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word contains R, S, E (each once).
- It does NOT contain A or I.
- R cannot be in position 2.
- S cannot be in position 4.
- E cannot be in position 5.

I need a new 5-letter word that uses R, S, E plus two other letters (not A or I), while respecting the positional constraints.

Let’s try to place R, S, E in new positions and pick two new consonants or vowels (excluding A and I). Good candidates: O, T, N, L, C, D, U, etc.

One word that fits: “STORE”
- Letters: S, T, O, R, E
- Contains R, S, E
- R is in position 4 (allowed, since original R was in position 2)
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since original S was in position 4)
- E is in position 5 (but original E was in position 5, and feedback says E is in word but not in position 5) – so E cannot be in position 5, so STORE is invalid.

Next candidate: “ROUSE”
- Letters: R, O, U, S, E
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- S in position 4 – but original S was in position 4 and feedback said S is in word but not in position 4 – so invalid.

Next: “CREST”
- Letters: C, R, E, S, T
- R in position 2 – original R was in position 2 and feedback said R is in word but not in position 2 – so invalid.

Next: “RESUR” – not a valid word.

Next: “SOWER”
- Letters: S, O, W, E, R
- S in position 1 (allowed)
- E in position 4 (allowed, since original E was in position 5)
- R in position 5 (allowed, since original R was in position 2)
- O and W are new letters.

This seems valid. Let’s check:
- Contains R, S, E
- R not in position 2
- S not in position 4
- E not in position 5
- No A or I

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) I(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: SOWER -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(-) W(x) E(-) R(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: ARISE → A(x) R(-) I(x) S(-) E(-)
- Letters known to be in the word: R, S, E
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, I
- R is not in position 2
- S is not in position 4
- E is not in position 5

Round 2: SOWER → S(✓) O(-) W(x) E(-) R(✓)
- S is now confirmed in position 1
- R is confirmed in position 5
- E is in the word but not in position 4
- O is in the word but not in position 2
- W is NOT in the word

Current known constraints:
- Word pattern: S _ _ _ R
- Must contain E (not in position 4 or 5) and O (not in position 2)
- Cannot contain A, I, W
- Letters used so far: S, R, E, O

Possible remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z

We need two more letters to fill positions 2 and 3, while respecting the constraints.

Let’s list possible positions:
- Position 2: cannot be O (since O is not in position 2)
- Position 3: no restrictions yet
- Position 4: E cannot be here, but O could be here
- Position 5: R is already fixed

Possible placements:
- E must be in position 2 or 3 (since it can’t be in 4 or 5)
- O must be in position 3 or 4 (since it can’t be in 2)

Let’s try to place E and O:
Option 1: E in position 2, O in position 3 → S E O _ R
Option 2: E in position 2, O in position 4 → S E _ O R
Option 3: E in position 3, O in position 4 → S _ E O R

Now, we need to pick the remaining letter(s) from the allowed set.

For Option 1: S E O _ R → need one letter for position 4. Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z
Let’s pick a common consonant: L → S E O L R → ""SEO LR"" – but ""SEO"" is not a valid start. Actually, ""SEOLR"" is not a word. Let’s think of real words.

Real words fitting S _ _ _ R:
- SPOOR – but P and O are allowed, but ""SPOOR"" is rare.
- SLOSH – but H is allowed, but we need to include E and O.
Wait, we need to include E and O in the word.

Let’s re-examine:
We know the word must contain S, E, O, R (with S in 1 and R in 5), and one more letter.

So possible patterns:
- S E O _ R
- S E _ O R
- S _ E O R

Looking for real 5-letter words:
- S E O _ R: ""SEONS"" – but N is allowed, but ""SEONS"" is not a word.
- S E _ O R: ""SEPOR"" – not a word.
- S _ E O R: ""SCOOR"" – not a word.

Let me think differently: maybe the word is S _ E O R or S _ _ E R (but E can't be in 4).

Wait, E cannot be in position 4 (from feedback), and cannot be in 5 (already R). So E must be in 2 or 3.

O cannot be in 2, so O must be in 3 or 4.

Let’s try:
- S _ E O R: This would require position 2 to be a letter not yet used, not O, and not A/I/W.
Possible: S T E O R → ""STEAR"" – not a word.
S N E O R – not a word.
S L E O R – ""SLEOR"" – not a word.

Another approach: list possible 5-letter words starting with S and ending with R, containing E and O, and excluding A, I, W.

Possible candidates:
- S O E _ R – but O cannot be in position 2.
- S _ O E R – but E cannot be in position 4.
- S _ E O R – this seems the only viable pattern.

Looking up, ""SPOER"" – not a word.
""SPOOR"" – archaic spelling, but valid.
""SLOER"" – not a word.
""SMEOR"" – not a word.

Another candidate: ""SOWER"" was already used.
""SPOER"" – not valid.

Wait, let me think of ""SORE"" plus one letter, but we need 5 letters.

Actually, let me consider ""SCORE"" – but it ends with E, not R.

Wait, the word must be S _ _ _ R with E and O somewhere in positions 2-4.

Let me think systematically:
Letters: S (1), ?, ?, ?, R (5)
Must include E and O in positions 2,3,4 with constraints:
- E not in 4 or 5
- O not in 2
So possible positions:
E can be 2 or 3
O can be 3 or 4
And they cannot both be in the same position.

Case 1: E in 2, O in 3 or 4
- S E O _ R → need position 4: valid word? ""SEONS"" – no
- S E _ O R → need position 3: ""SEPOR"" – no

Case 2: E in 3, O in 4
- S _ E O R → need position 2: ""S T E O R"" – ""STEAR"" – no
""S N E O R"" – no
""S L E O R"" – no
""S P E O R"" – ""SPEOR"" – no
""S C E O R"" – ""SCEOR"" – no
""S M E O R"" – ""SMEAR"" – yes! ""SMEAR"" is a valid word.

Check constraints:
- S in 1: ✓
- M: new letter, allowed
- E in 3: allowed (not 4 or 5)
- A: not present, ok
- R in 5: ✓
- Contains O in 4: allowed (not in 2)
- No A, I, W
- Contains required R, S, E, O

""SMEAR"" fits all constraints.

Let's consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Known facts
1. The word is S _ _ _ R (positions 1 and 5 are locked).
2. It must contain the letters E and O somewhere in positions 2-4.
3. It cannot contain A, I, M, W.
4. Positional restrictions:
   - E is not in position 3 or 5 (already excluded from 5 by earlier feedback, and from 3 by SMEAR feedback).
   - O is not in position 2.

So E must be in position 2 or 4, and O must be in position 3 or 4, but they cannot both be in 4. This gives us two mutually exclusive patterns:

Pattern A: E in 2, O in 3   → S E O _ R
Pattern B: E in 2, O in 4   → S E _ O R
Pattern C: E in 4, O in 3   → S _ O E R

We need to fill the single blank with a letter that is:
- not A, I, M, W
- not already used (S, E, O, R)

Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, N, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z

Real 5-letter words that fit:
- Pattern A: S E O _ R → ""SEONS"" (not a word), ""SEONS"" (no), ""SEONS"" (no) – nothing valid
- Pattern B: S E _ O R → ""SEPOR"" (no), ""SEBOR"" (no), ""SECOR"" (no) – nothing valid
- Pattern C: S _ O E R → ""SPOER"" (no), ""SCOER"" (no), ""STOER"" (no), ""SLOER"" (no) – nothing valid

Wait, let me re-examine Pattern B more carefully. The blank is position 3, and we need a valid consonant.

Looking at ""SE _ OR"" possibilities:
- ""SEPOR"" – no
- ""SEBOR"" – no
- ""SECOR"" – no
- ""SEGOR"" – no
- ""SEFOR"" – no

Pattern C: ""S _ O E R"" – possible words:
- ""SPOER"" – no
- ""SCOER"" – no
- ""STOER"" – no
- ""SLOER"" – no
- ""SNEOR"" – no

Hmm, none of these are valid. Let me double-check Pattern A: ""SE O _ R"".

Possible letters for position 4:
- ""SEONS"" – no
- ""SEONS"" – no
- ""SEONS"" – no

This suggests I may have missed a valid word. Let me think differently: perhaps ""SPOOR"" (archaic but valid) or ""SLOSH"" (but lacks E).

Wait, let me try ""SPOOR"":
- S P O O R – but this has two O's, which is allowed, but we only know one O is in the word. Also, E must be present.

Realizing I overlooked: ""SPOOR"" lacks E, so invalid.

Let me try ""SCORE"":
- S C O R E – but ends with E, not R.

Actually, the only viable pattern seems to be Pattern C with a different consonant.

Looking again: ""S _ O E R"" – the missing letter must be a consonant not yet excluded.

Let me try ""STOER"" – not a word.
""SLOER"" – no.
""SNORE"" – ends with E, not R.
""SCOPE"" – ends with E.
""SPORE"" – ends with E.

Wait, let me consider ""SPOOR"" again – but it lacks E.

Realizing I missed: ""SPOOR"" is invalid because it lacks E. 

Let me try ""SHEOR"" – no.
""SHOER"" – ends with R but has H and O and E in positions 3 and 4:
- S H O E R – this is ""SHOER"", a valid word meaning one who shaves.

Check constraints:
- S in 1: ✓
- H: new letter, allowed
- O in 3: allowed (not in 2)
- E in 4: allowed (not in 3 or 5)
- R in 5: ✓
- Contains required letters: S, E, O, R
- No A, I, M, W

This fits perfectly.

Let me re-express the feedback in a clear, structured way:

1. ARISE → A(x) R(-) I(x) S(-) E(-)
   - A, I not in word
   - R, S, E are in word but not in positions 2, 4, 5 respectively

2. SOWER → S(✓) O(-) W(x) E(-) R(✓)
   - S is in position 1
   - R is in position 5
   - O, E are in word but not in positions 2, 4 respectively
   - W not in word

3. SMEAR → S(✓) M(x) E(-) A(x) R(✓)
   - S and R confirmed in positions 1 and 5
   - E is in word but not in position 3
   - M, A not in word

4. SHOER → S(✓) H(x) O(-) E(-) R(✓)
   - S and R confirmed in positions 1 and 5
   - O is in word but not in position 3
   - E is in word but not in position 4
   - H not in word

Current constraints:
- Word must be S _ _ _ R
- Must contain O and E in positions 2, 3 or 4, but:
  – E cannot be in 3 or 4 (from SMEAR and SHOER feedback)
  – O cannot be in 2 or 3
- Therefore the only possible placements are:
  – E in position 2, O in position 4 → S E _ O R
  – O in position 4, E in position 2 → same as above

So the pattern is S E _ O R.

The blank (position 3) must be a letter that:
- Has not been eliminated (not A, I, M, W, H)
- Has not been confirmed elsewhere

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, K, L, N, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z
