For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first guess would use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

Popular strong starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it covers S, L, A, T, E - five of the most common letters. It gives us information about the presence/absence of S, L, A, T, and E in the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (not second).
- A, T, E are NOT in the word at all.

- The word contains S and L, but not A, T, or E.
- S is not in position 1, L is not in position 2.

We need a new word that:
1. Uses S and L.
2. Does not use A, T, or E.
3. Places S somewhere other than position 1.
4. Places L somewhere other than position 2.

Good remaining common letters (excluding A, T, E) include R, N, I, O, U, D, C, M, P, B, G, H, K, F, Y, W, V, X, Z, J, Q.

Let’s try a word like ""FLUSH"":
- Uses F, L, U, S, H.
- Contains S and L.
- S is in position 4 (not 1), L is in position 2 (but feedback says L is not in position 2). So FLUSH is invalid.

Try ""CLIPS"":
- Uses C, L, I, P, S.
- S is in position 5 (valid), L is in position 2 (invalid per feedback).

- Uses S, O, L, A, R. But A is excluded.

- S is in position 1 (invalid).

Try ""LIONS"":
- Uses L, I, O, N, S.
- L is in position 1 (valid), S is in position 5 (valid).
- No A, T, E.
- All letters are new except L and S which we know are in the word.

This seems like a good next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: LIONS -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) I(✓) O(-) N(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are in the word and their positions:
   - L is in position 1 (✓)
   - I is in position 2 (✓)
   - S is in position 5 (✓)

2. Letters that are in the word but in the wrong positions:
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 3.

3. Letters that are NOT in the word:
   - A, T, E, N (from SLATE and LIONS feedback).

So the pattern so far is:
L I _ _ S
with O somewhere in positions 3 or 4.

Remaining letters we haven’t ruled out yet (common ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, R, U, V, W, Y, plus O.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with L I
- Ends with S
- Contains O in position 3 or 4
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible candidates:
- L I O _ S → LIOS? (not a valid word)
- L I _ O S → L I _ O S

Looking for valid words:
- LIVOS? (no)
- LIONS? (already guessed)
- LIMOS? (yes, LIMOS is a valid word meaning a type of car or a taxi service)
- LIPES? (E is ruled out)
- LIRKS? (no O)
- LIVID? (doesn’t end with S)

""LIMOS"" fits perfectly:
- L I M O S
- Starts with L I, ends with S
- Contains O in position 4
- Uses only allowed letters (M is new, not ruled out)

From the three rounds of feedback:

1. Positions locked:
   - 1: L
   - 2: I
   - 5: S
   - 4: O

   So the pattern is: L I _ O S

2. Letters ruled out so far:
   - A, T, E, N, M (from SLATE, LIONS, LIMOS)

3. The only remaining letter in position 3 is one we haven't tested yet.  
   Common unused letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, P, R, U, V, W, Y.

4. Valid 5-letter words that fit L I _ O S:
   - LIVOS – invalid (V not ruled out, but word doesn’t exist)
   - LIGOS – no
   - LIPOS – yes (short for lipoid or a medical term; listed in dictionaries)
   - LIRKS – no (K is allowed, but doesn’t fit pattern)
   - LIVOR – no (doesn’t end with S)

The only valid candidate is LIPOS.
