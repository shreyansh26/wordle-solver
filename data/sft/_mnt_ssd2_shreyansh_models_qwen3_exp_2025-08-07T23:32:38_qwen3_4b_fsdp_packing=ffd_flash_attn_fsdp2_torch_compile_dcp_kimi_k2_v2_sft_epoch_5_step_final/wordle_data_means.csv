For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. 

One of the most popular and effective starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives me good coverage of common letters and positions. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L(x): L is not in the word at all.
- A(✓): A is in the word and in position 3.
- T(x): T is not in the word.
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word has an A in the 3rd position.
- It contains S and E, but S is not first and E is not last.
- It does NOT contain L or T.

We need a 5-letter word with A in position 3, and with S and E somewhere else (but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively). Common remaining consonants to test could be R, N, C, etc.

A good next guess would be something like ""CRANE"":
- C: new consonant to test
- R: common consonant
- A: already confirmed in position 3
- N: new consonant
- E: confirmed in word but not in position 5 (here it's in position 5, which is allowed because the feedback only says E is not in position 5 for the previous guess, not that it can't be in position 5 in this guess)

Wait, but E was in position 5 in SLATE and got (-), meaning E is in the word but not in position 5. So in CRANE, E would be in position 5 again, which is invalid because of that feedback.

Let me rethink. We need E somewhere other than position 5. And S somewhere other than position 1.

Possible structure: _ _ A _ _
We need S and E in positions 2, 4, or 5 (but E not in 5). So E could be in 2 or 4, S could be in 2,4,5.

Let's try ""RAISE"":
- R: new consonant
- A: correct position 3
- I: new vowel
- S: could be in position 4 (allowed)
- E: in position 5, but this is invalid because E was in position 5 in SLATE and got (-). So E can't be in position 5 here.

Next option: ""SNAKE"":
- S: position 1, but S was in position 1 in SLATE and got (-), so S can't be in position 1. Invalid.

""PEAS"":
- Only 4 letters, invalid.

""BEAST"":
- B: new consonant
- E: position 2 (allowed)
- A: position 3
- S: position 4 (allowed)
- T: but T was in position 5 in SLATE and got (x), so T is not in the word. Invalid.

""PEARS"":
- P: new consonant
- E: position 2
- A: position 3
- R: new consonant
- S: position 5 (allowed, since S was in position 1 in SLATE and got (-), but position 5 is new)
This seems valid.

But let's see if there's a better word. Another option is ""CREAS"":
- C: new
- R: new
- E: position 3, but A is already in position 3. Invalid.

""EARLS"":
- E: position 1 (allowed, since E was in position 5 in SLATE and got (-), so position 1 is fine)
- A: position 2, but A must be in position 3. Invalid.

""SEARS"":
- S: position 1 (invalid, same reason as above)

""PEASE"":
- P: new
- E: position 2
- A: position 3
- S: position 4
- E: position 5 (invalid, same as CRANE)

""PEARS"" seems the best so far.

But let's think of another: ""GRAPE"":
- G: new
- R: new
- A: position 3
- P: new
- E: position 5 (invalid)

""GRAIN"":
- Doesn't have S or E. Invalid.

""CRANE"" had E in position 5 which was invalid.

""PEARS"" seems the only valid option here. Let me verify:

PEARS:
- P: new
- E: position 2 (allowed)
- A: position 3 (correct)
- R: new
- S: position 4 (allowed)
This satisfies all constraints.

So I'll go with PEARS.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. A is in position 3.
2. E is in position 2.
3. S is in position 5.
4. Letters NOT in the word: L, T, P, R.
5. The word looks like: _ E A _ S

We still need the 1st and 4th letters.  
Available consonants (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Available vowels: I, O, U (A and E already used).

We want common letters.  
Let’s test common consonants in positions 1 and 4.

Candidate words:
- BEADS – but D is 4th, S already fixed at 5.  
- CEASE – but S already used at 5.  
- GEARs – not a word.  
- HEABS – not a word.  
- MEANS – N at 4, S at 5.  
- NEASH – not a word.  
- WEASE – not a word.  
- YEAST – T is ruled out.

The only valid English word fitting _ E A _ S with remaining letters is **MEANS**.

Check:
- M: new, allowed.  
- E: position 2 ✓  
- A: position 3 ✓  
- N: new, allowed.  
- S: position 5 ✓  

No conflicts.
