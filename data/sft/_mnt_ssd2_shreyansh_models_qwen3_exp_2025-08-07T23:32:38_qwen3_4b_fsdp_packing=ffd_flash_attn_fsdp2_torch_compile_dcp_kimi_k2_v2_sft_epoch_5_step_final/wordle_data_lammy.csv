For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it’s not in position 1).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in the first position.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

Since we’ve eliminated R, O, S, E, we need a new set of consonants and vowels. A good next guess should:
1. Re-use the known letter A in a different position.
2. Introduce new common letters that weren’t in AROSE.

Common letters not yet tried: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

A word that satisfies these constraints and uses several new common letters is “TAINT”:
- T and N are new consonants.
- I is a new vowel.
- A is re-used in position 2 (since it can’t be in position 1).
- T is repeated, which is allowed.

This should give us more information about the remaining letters.

- Introduce several new common consonants and vowels.

The word “BADLY” fits these criteria:
- B, D, L, Y are all new letters.

From the three rounds of feedback:

So far we know:

- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, T, I, N, B, D  
- Letters confirmed IN the word: A (position 2), L (somewhere except 4), Y (position 5).

Remaining common letters to test: C, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, W, etc.

We need to place L in one of positions 1, 3, or 5. But position 5 is already Y, so L must be in position 1 or 3.

A good next guess should:
- Keep A in position 2 and Y in position 5.  
- Place L in position 1 or 3.  
- Introduce new common consonants for the remaining slots.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it’s not in position 1).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in the first position.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

Since we’ve eliminated R, O, S, E, we need a new set of consonants and vowels. A good next guess should:
1. Re-use the known letter A in a different position.
2. Introduce new common letters that weren’t in AROSE.

Common letters not yet tried: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

A word that satisfies these constraints and uses several new common letters is “TAINT”:
- T and N are new consonants.
- I is a new vowel.
- A is re-used in position 2 (since it can’t be in position 1).
- T is repeated, which is allowed.

This should give us more information about the remaining letters.

2. TAINT → T(x) A(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)  
   – A is now confirmed in position 2.  
   – T, I, N are not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word pattern is: _ A _ _ _  
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, T, I, N  
- The only letter we know is in the word is A (fixed in position 2).

We need to pick consonants and vowels from the remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
- Keep A in position 2.  
- Introduce several new common consonants and vowels.

The word “BADLY” fits these criteria:
- B, D, L, Y are all new letters.  
- A is locked in position 2.  
- It uses common letters that haven’t been eliminated.

This will test four new letters in one guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it’s not in position 1).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in the first position.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

Since we’ve eliminated R, O, S, E, we need a new set of consonants and vowels. A good next guess should:
1. Re-use the known letter A in a different position.
2. Introduce new common letters that weren’t in AROSE.

Common letters not yet tried: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

A word that satisfies these constraints and uses several new common letters is “TAINT”:
- T and N are new consonants.
- I is a new vowel.
- A is re-used in position 2 (since it can’t be in position 1).
- T is repeated, which is allowed.

This should give us more information about the remaining letters.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)

   – A is now confirmed in position 2.  
   – T, I, N are not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word pattern is: _ A _ _ _  
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, T, I, N  
- The only letter we know is in the word is A (fixed in position 2).

We need to pick consonants and vowels from the remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
- Keep A in position 2.  
- Introduce several new common consonants and vowels.

The word “BADLY” fits these criteria:
- B, D, L, Y are all new letters.  
- A is locked in position 2.  
- It uses common letters that haven’t been eliminated.

This will test four new letters in one guess.

   – B, D are not in the word.

   – Y is in the word and in position 5.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ A _ _ Y  
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, T, I, N, B, D  
- Letters confirmed IN the word: A (position 2), L (somewhere except 4), Y (position 5).

Remaining common letters to test: C, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, W, etc.

We need to place L in one of positions 1, 3, or 5. But position 5 is already Y, so L must be in position 1 or 3.

A good next guess should:
- Keep A in position 2 and Y in position 5.  
- Place L in position 1 or 3.  
- Introduce new common consonants for the remaining slots.

Testing L in position 1: L A _ _ Y  
Possible middle consonants: C, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, W.

The word “LACED” won’t work because D is already excluded.  
“LAFAY” isn’t valid.  
“LAMBY” has B excluded.  
“LANKY” has N excluded.  
“LAPSY” isn’t common.  
“LAUGH” has U and G, both still allowed.

Let’s try “LAUGH”:
- Pattern: L A U G H  
- But we need Y in position 5, so this doesn’t fit the pattern _ A _ _ Y.

We need to keep Y in position 5, so the pattern is _ A _ _ Y.

Let’s test L in position 3: _ A L _ Y  
Possible first and fourth letters: C, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, W.

“CALMY” isn’t a word.  
“HALFY” isn’t a word.  
“MALLY” isn’t a word.  
“PALFY” isn’t a word.  
“WALLY” has W and L, but W isn’t excluded yet.

Actually, let’s try L in position 1: L A _ _ Y  
Looking for common words:  
“LACED” – D excluded.  
“LAFED” – D excluded.  
“LAKED” – D excluded.  
“LAMED” – D excluded.  
“LANKY” – N excluded.  
“LAPSY” – not common.  
“LARGY” – R excluded.  
“LAVKY” – not common.  
“LAWDY” – W, D – D excluded.  
“LAYER” – E, R excluded.  
“LAZED” – Z, D excluded.  

Hmm, none seem perfect. Let’s try L in position 3: _ A L _ Y  
Possible:  
“C A L M Y” – CALMY isn’t a word.  
“F A L L Y” – F, L, L, Y – but L is already in word, double L allowed?  
“F A L L Y” is “FALLY” – not a standard word.  
“G A L L Y” – GALLY – not standard.  
“H A L L Y” – HALLY – not standard.  
“M A L L Y” – MALLY – not standard.  
“P A L L Y” – PALLY – not standard.  
“W A L L Y” – WALLY – this is a valid word (a nickname for Wallace).

But WALLY uses W, A, L, L, Y – W and L are still allowed, A and Y confirmed.  

However, we already know L is in the word (from BADLY feedback), so double L is possible.  

Another option is “C A L L Y” – but CALMY isn’t valid.  

Let’s try “C A L M Y” – not valid.  

Let’s try “C A L K Y” – not valid.  

Let’s try “C A L P Y” – not valid.  

Let’s try “C A L G Y” – not valid.  

Let’s try “C A L F Y” – not valid.  

Let’s try “C A L H Y” – not valid.  

Let’s try “C A L U Y” – not valid.  

Let’s try “C A L W Y” – not valid.  

Let’s try “F A L L Y” – FALLY – not standard.  

Let’s try “G A L L Y” – GALLY – not standard.  

Let’s try “H A L L Y” – HALLY – not standard.  

Let’s try “M A L L Y” – MALLY – not standard.  

Let’s try “P A L L Y” – PALLY – not standard.  

Let’s try “W A L L Y” – WALLY – this is the only valid word fitting _ A L _ Y that comes to mind.  

But WALLY uses W and L, and we haven’t tested W yet.  

Another approach: since we have _ A _ _ Y and L must be in 1 or 3, let’s try L in position 3 with new letters.  

“C A L M Y” – not a word.  

“C A L P Y” – not a word.  

“C A L K Y” – not a word.  

“C A L H Y” – not a word.  

“C A L G Y” – not a word.  

“C A L F Y” – not a word.  

“C A L U Y” – not a word.  

“C A L W Y” – not a word.  

Let’s try L in position 1: L A _ _ Y  
“L A C K Y” – LACKY – valid word.  
Letters: L, A, C, K, Y – none of these (C, K) have been excluded yet.  

This seems like a strong next guess.Based on the feedback:
- Word pattern: _ A _ _ Y  
- Letters confirmed: A (pos 2), L (somewhere except 4), Y (pos 5)

Testing L in position 1 with new common letters C and K gives the word “LACKY”.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the four rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   – A is in the word, but not in position 1.  
   – R, O, S, E are not in the word.

2. TAINT → T(x) A(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)  
   – A is confirmed in position 2.  
   – T, I, N are not in the word.

3. BADLY → B(x) A(✓) D(x) L(-) Y(✓)  
   – A is still confirmed in position 2.  
   – B, D are not in the word.  
   – L is in the word but not in position 4.  
   – Y is in the word and in position 5.

4. LACKY → L(✓) A(✓) C(x) K(x) Y(✓)  
   – L is confirmed in position 1.  
   – A is confirmed in position 2.  
   – C and K are not in the word.  
   – Y is confirmed in position 5.

So the word pattern is now: L A _ _ Y  
Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, T, I, N, B, D, C, K  
Remaining common letters to test: F, G, H, M, P, U, W, etc.

We need to fill positions 3 and 4 with letters from the remaining pool.  
Looking for common 5-letter words that fit L A _ _ Y:

- L A F _ Y → LAFAY (not a word)  
- L A G _ Y → LAGGY (valid)  
- L A H _ Y → LAHLY (not a word)  
- L A M _ Y → LAMBY (B is excluded)  
- L A P _ Y → LAPSY (not a word)  
- L A U _ Y → LAUZY (not a word)  
- L A W _ Y → LAWDY (valid)  

Between LAGGY and LAWDY, both fit the pattern and use allowed letters.  
LAGGY uses G twice, while LAWDY uses F and D (but D is excluded).  
Actually, LAWDY uses D, which is excluded.  
LAGGY uses G twice – G hasn’t been excluded yet.  

So LAGGY is a valid word that fits the pattern L A _ _ Y and uses only allowed letters.

Therefore, the next guess should be LAGGY.
