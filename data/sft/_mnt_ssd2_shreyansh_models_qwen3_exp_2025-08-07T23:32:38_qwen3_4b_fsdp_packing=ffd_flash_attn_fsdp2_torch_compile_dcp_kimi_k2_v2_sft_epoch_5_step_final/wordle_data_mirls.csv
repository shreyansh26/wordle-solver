### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can provide useful information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, O, or E.
- Contains R and S somewhere, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses R and S in different positions (R not in slot 2, S not in slot 4).
- Avoids A, O, E entirely.

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, etc.

Hmm, many common words place R in slot 2. Let's try a word where R is in slot 1 or 3 or 4 or 5, and S is in slot 1, 2, 3, or 5.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A, O, E are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. SCRIP → S(-) C(x) R(✓) I(-) P(x)
   - C and P are not in the word.
   - R is in position 3 (✓) → so R is fixed at position 3.
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - I is in the word but not in position 4.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ R _ _
- Letters in word: R (fixed at 3), S (somewhere except 1 or 4), I (somewhere except 4), plus any other letters not yet ruled out.
- Letters ruled out: A, O, E, C, P.

Remaining letters to consider: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- R in position 3.
- S not in positions 1 or 4.
- I not in position 4.
- No A, O, E, C, P.

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5. But 3 is R, so S can be 2 or 5.
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 3, 5. But 3 is R, so I can be 1, 2, or 5.

Let's brainstorm words:
- If S is in position 2: _ S R _ _
  - I must be in 1, 5 (can't be 4, already excluded).
  - Example: I S R _ _ → but need 5 letters.
  - Try ""ISRID"" (invalid), ""ISRUM"" (invalid), ""ISRIT"" (invalid).
  - Maybe ""TURNS"" (but R not in 3).
  - Wait, need R in 3.

Better approach: list words with R in position 3, no A/O/E/C/P, and containing S and I appropriately.

Possible words:
- ""DRISL"" (invalid)
- ""BRISK"" → B R I S K → R is 2, not 3. No.
- ""GRIST"" → G R I S T → R is 2. No.
- ""TRIUM"" → R is 2. No.
- ""FRISE"" → E is excluded.
- ""FRISK"" → R is 2. No.
- ""BRUIS"" → U is allowed, R is 2. No.
- ""URBIS"" → R is 2. No.
- ""TRIPS"" → R is 2. No.
- ""DRIPS"" → R is 2. No.
- ""SCRUB"" → R is 2. No.

Hmm, seems like many common words have R in 2 or 4. Let's think differently.

We need R in position 3. So the word is: _ _ R _ _

Letters allowed: S, I, plus others not in excluded list.

Possible words:
- ""BURIN"" → B U R I N → R is 3, S is missing.
- ""BURKS"" → B U R K S → R is 3, S is 5 (allowed), I is missing.
- ""BURIN"" doesn't have I.
- ""FRUIT"" → R is 2. No.
- ""GRIMY"" → R is 2. No.
- ""PRISM"" → R is 2. No.
- ""TRIMS"" → R is 2. No.
- ""BRISK"" → R is 2. No.

Wait, let's think of words with R in position 3, and containing S and I.

Possible patterns:
- _ I R S _ → but S can't be 4.
- _ S R I _ → S is 2 (allowed), I is 4 (but I can't be 4).
- _ I R _ S → I is 2 (allowed), S is 5 (allowed).
- _ S R _ I → S is 2 (allowed), I is 5 (allowed).
- _ _ R I S → I is 4 (invalid), S is 5 (allowed) but I is invalid.
- _ _ R S I → S is 4 (invalid), I is 5 (allowed) but S is invalid.

So possible valid patterns:
1. _ I R _ S → I in 2, S in 5.
2. _ S R _ I → S in 2, I in 5.

Let's try pattern 1: _ I R _ S
Possible first letter: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Possible fourth letter: same set, but not repeating excluded letters.

Example: B I R K S → ""BIRKS"" (valid word, past tense of ""birk"").
Check constraints:
- R is 3 (✓)
- S is 5 (allowed, not 1 or 4)
- I is 2 (allowed, not 4)
- No A, O, E, C, P.

This seems valid.

Another example: T I R N S → ""TIRNS"" (valid word, past tense of ""tirn"").
But ""BIRKS"" is more common.

Let's go with ""BIRKS"".
</think>

Based on the feedback:
- R is fixed in position 3.
- S is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4 → possible positions 2 or 5.
- I is in the word but not in position 4 → possible positions 1, 2, or 5.
- Excluded letters: A, O, E, C, P.

A valid word fitting these constraints is ""BIRKS"".

<guess>BIRKS</guess>",BIRKS,"From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A, O, E are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. SCRIP → S(-) C(x) R(✓) I(-) P(x)
   - C and P are not in the word.
   - R is in position 3 (✓) → so R is fixed at position 3.
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - I is in the word but not in position 4.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ R _ _
- Letters in word: R (fixed at 3), S (somewhere except 1 or 4), I (somewhere except 4), plus any other letters not yet ruled out.
- Letters ruled out: A, O, E, C, P.

Remaining letters to consider: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- R in position 3.
- S not in positions 1 or 4.
- I not in position 4.
- No A, O, E, C, P.

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5. But 3 is R, so S can be 2 or 5.
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 3, 5. But 3 is R, so I can be 1, 2, or 5.

Let's brainstorm words:
- If S is in position 2: _ S R _ _
  - I must be in 1, 5 (can't be 4, already excluded).
  - Example: I S R _ _ → but need 5 letters.
  - Try ""ISRID"" (invalid), ""ISRUM"" (invalid), ""ISRIT"" (invalid).
  - Maybe ""TURNS"" (but R not in 3).
  - Wait, need R in 3.

Better approach: list words with R in position 3, no A/O/E/C/P, and containing S and I appropriately.

Possible words:
- ""DRISL"" (invalid)
- ""BRISK"" → B R I S K → R is 2, not 3. No.
- ""GRIST"" → G R I S T → R is 2. No.
- ""TRIUM"" → R is 2. No.
- ""FRISE"" → E is excluded.
- ""FRISK"" → R is 2. No.
- ""BRUIS"" → U is allowed, R is 2. No.
- ""URBIS"" → R is 2. No.
- ""TRIPS"" → R is 2. No.
- ""DRIPS"" → R is 2. No.
- ""SCRUB"" → R is 2. No.

Hmm, seems like many common words have R in 2 or 4. Let's think differently.

We need R in position 3. So the word is: _ _ R _ _

Letters allowed: S, I, plus others not in excluded list.

Possible words:
- ""BURIN"" → B U R I N → R is 3, S is missing.
- ""BURKS"" → B U R K S → R is 3, S is 5 (allowed), I is missing.
- ""BURIN"" doesn't have I.
- ""FRUIT"" → R is 2. No.
- ""GRIMY"" → R is 2. No.
- ""PRISM"" → R is 2. No.
- ""TRIMS"" → R is 2. No.
- ""BRISK"" → R is 2. No.

Wait, let's think of words with R in position 3, and containing S and I.

Possible patterns:
- _ I R S _ → but S can't be 4.
- _ S R I _ → S is 2 (allowed), I is 4 (but I can't be 4).
- _ I R _ S → I is 2 (allowed), S is 5 (allowed).
- _ S R _ I → S is 2 (allowed), I is 5 (allowed).
- _ _ R I S → I is 4 (invalid), S is 5 (allowed) but I is invalid.
- _ _ R S I → S is 4 (invalid), I is 5 (allowed) but S is invalid.

So possible valid patterns:
1. _ I R _ S → I in 2, S in 5.
2. _ S R _ I → S in 2, I in 5.

Let's try pattern 1: _ I R _ S
Possible first letter: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Possible fourth letter: same set, but not repeating excluded letters.

Example: B I R K S → ""BIRKS"" (valid word, past tense of ""birk"").
Check constraints:
- R is 3 (✓)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can provide useful information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, O, or E.
- Contains R and S somewhere, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses R and S in different positions (R not in slot 2, S not in slot 4).
- Avoids A, O, E entirely.

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, etc.
Good vowel left to try: I, U.

A word like ""TRUST"" comes to mind:
- T, R, U, S, T.
- R is in slot 2 (but feedback says R is not in slot 2) → conflict.
Next try ""FRISK"":
- F, R, I, S, K.
- R is in slot 2 (again conflict).

Try ""CRISP"":
- C, R, I, S, P.
- R is in slot 2 (conflict).

Try ""DRIPS"":
- D, R, I, P, S.
- R is in slot 2 (conflict).

Try ""GRIST"":
- G, R, I, S, T.
- R is in slot 2 (conflict).

Try ""BRISK"":
- B, R, I, S, K.
- R is in slot 2 (conflict).

Try ""FRISK"" again (already tried).

Try ""TRIPS"":
- T, R, I, P, S.
- R is in slot 2 (conflict).

Try ""URBIS"" (but not a common word).

Try ""CRISP"" again (R in slot 2).

Try ""PRISM"":
- P, R, I, S, M.
- R is in slot 2 (conflict).

Try ""DRIPS"" again (R in slot 2).

Try ""GRITS"":
- G, R, I, T, S.
- R is in slot 2 (conflict).

Try ""BRISK"" again (R in slot 2).

Try ""TRUST"" again (R in slot 2).

Hmm, many common words place R in slot 2. Let's try a word where R is in slot 1 or 3 or 4 or 5, and S is in slot 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Word like ""SIRKS"" (but not common).

Try ""SIRKS"" → S in slot 1, R in slot 2 (conflict).

Try ""SIRUP"" → S in slot 1, R in slot 2 (conflict).

Try ""SINKS"" → S in slot 1, R not present (need R).

Try ""SCRIN"" (archaic, but valid).

Try ""SCRIP"" → S, C, R, I, P.
- S is in slot 1 (allowed, since original S was in slot 4).
- R is in slot 3 (allowed, since original R was in slot 2).
- Uses C, I, P (new letters).
- Avoids A, O, E.

This seems valid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can provide useful information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, O, or E.
- Contains R and S somewhere, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses R and S in different positions (R not in slot 2, S not in slot 4).
- Avoids A, O, E entirely.

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, etc.
Good vowel left to try: I, U.

A word like ""TRUST"" comes to mind:
- T, R, U, S, T.
- R is in slot 2 (but feedback says R is not in slot 2) → conflict.
Next try ""FRISK"":
- F, R, I, S, K.
- R is in slot 2 (again conflict).

Try ""CRISP"":
- C, R, I, S, P.
- R is in slot 2 (conflict).

Try ""DRIPS"":
- D, R, I, P, S.
- R is in slot 2 (conflict).

Try ""GRIST"":
- G, R, I, S, T.
- R is in slot 2 (conflict).

Try ""BRISK"":
- B, R, I, S, K.
- R is in slot 2 (conflict).

Try ""FRISK"" again (already tried).

Try ""TRIPS"":
- T, R, I, P, S.
- R is in slot 2 (conflict).

Try ""URBIS"" (but not a common word).

Try ""CRISP"" again (R in slot 2).

Try ""PRISM"":
- P, R, I, S, M.
- R is in slot 2 (conflict).

Try ""DRIPS"" again (R in slot 2).

Try ""GRITS"":
- G, R, I, T, S.
- R is in slot 2 (conflict).

Try ""BRISK"" again (R in slot 2).

Try ""TRUST"" again (R in slot 2).

Hmm, many common words place R in slot 2. Let's try a word where R is in slot 1 or 3 or 4 or 5, and S is in slot 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Word like ""SIRKS"" (but not common).

Try ""SIRKS"" → S in slot 1, R in slot 2 (conflict).

Try ""SIRUP"" → S in slot 1, R in slot 2 (conflict).

Try ""SINKS"" → S in slot 1, R not present (need R).

Try ""SCRIN"" (archaic, but valid).

Try ""SCRIP"" → S, C, R, I, P.
- S is in slot 1 (allowed, since original S was in slot 4).
- R is in slot 3 (allowed, since original R was in slot 2).
- Uses C, I, P (new letters).
- Avoids A, O, E.

This seems valid.

Guess 2: SCRIP -> FEEDBACK: S(-) C(x) R(✓) I(-) P(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A, O, E are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. SCRIP → S(-) C(x) R(✓) I(-) P(x)
   - C and P are not in the word.
   - R is in position 3 (✓) → so R is fixed at position 3.
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - I is in the word but not in position 4.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ R _ _
- Letters in word: R (fixed at 3), S (somewhere except 1 or 4), I (somewhere except 4), plus any other letters not yet ruled out.
- Letters ruled out: A, O, E, C, P.

Remaining letters to consider: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- R in position 3.
- S not in positions 1 or 4.
- I not in position 4.
- No A, O, E, C, P.

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5. But 3 is R, so S can be 2 or 5.
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 3, 5. But 3 is R, so I can be 1, 2, or 5.

Let's brainstorm words:
- If S is in position 2: _ S R _ _
  - I must be in 1, 5 (can't be 4, already excluded).
  - Example: I S R _ _ → but need 5 letters.
  - Try ""ISRID"" (invalid), ""ISRUM"" (invalid), ""ISRIT"" (invalid).
  - Maybe ""TURNS"" (but R not in 3).
  - Wait, need R in 3.

Better approach: list words with R in position 3, no A/O/E/C/P, and containing S and I appropriately.

Possible words:
- ""DRISL"" (invalid)
- ""BRISK"" → B R I S K → R is 2, not 3. No.
- ""GRIST"" → G R I S T → R is 2. No.
- ""TRIUM"" → R is 2. No.
- ""FRISE"" → E is excluded.
- ""FRISK"" → R is 2. No.
- ""BRUIS"" → U is allowed, R is 2. No.
- ""URBIS"" → R is 2. No.
- ""TRIPS"" → R is 2. No.
- ""DRIPS"" → R is 2. No.
- ""SCRUB"" → R is 2. No.

Hmm, seems like many common words have R in 2 or 4. Let's think differently.

We need R in position 3. So the word is: _ _ R _ _

Letters allowed: S, I, plus others not in excluded list.

Possible words:
- ""BURIN"" → B U R I N → R is 3, S is missing.
- ""BURKS"" → B U R K S → R is 3, S is 5 (allowed), I is missing.
- ""BURIN"" doesn't have I.
- ""FRUIT"" → R is 2. No.
- ""GRIMY"" → R is 2. No.
- ""PRISM"" → R is 2. No.
- ""TRIMS"" → R is 2. No.
- ""BRISK"" → R is 2. No.

Wait, let's think of words with R in position 3, and containing S and I.

Possible patterns:
- _ I R S _ → but S can't be 4.
- _ S R I _ → S is 2 (allowed), I is 4 (but I can't be 4).
- _ I R _ S → I is 2 (allowed), S is 5 (allowed).
- _ S R _ I → S is 2 (allowed), I is 5 (allowed).
- _ _ R I S → I is 4 (invalid), S is 5 (allowed) but I is invalid.
- _ _ R S I → S is 4 (invalid), I is 5 (allowed) but S is invalid.

So possible valid patterns:
1. _ I R _ S → I in 2, S in 5.
2. _ S R _ I → S in 2, I in 5.

Let's try pattern 1: _ I R _ S
Possible first letter: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Possible fourth letter: same set, but not repeating excluded letters.

Example: B I R K S → ""BIRKS"" (valid word, past tense of ""birk"").
Check constraints:
- R is 3 (✓)
- S is 5 (allowed, not 1 or 4)
- I is 2 (allowed, not 4)
- No A, O, E, C, P.

This seems valid.

Another example: T I R N S → ""TIRNS"" (valid word, past tense of ""tirn"").
But ""BIRKS"" is more common.

Let's go with ""BIRKS"".Based on the feedback:
- R is fixed in position 3.
- S is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4 → possible positions 2 or 5.
- I is in the word but not in position 4 → possible positions 1, 2, or 5.
- Excluded letters: A, O, E, C, P.

A valid word fitting these constraints is ""BIRKS"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can provide useful information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, O, or E.
- Contains R and S somewhere, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses R and S in different positions (R not in slot 2, S not in slot 4).
- Avoids A, O, E entirely.

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, etc.
Good vowel left to try: I, U.

A word like ""TRUST"" comes to mind:
- T, R, U, S, T.
- R is in slot 2 (but feedback says R is not in slot 2) → conflict.
Next try ""FRISK"":
- F, R, I, S, K.
- R is in slot 2 (again conflict).

Try ""CRISP"":
- C, R, I, S, P.
- R is in slot 2 (conflict).

Try ""DRIPS"":
- D, R, I, P, S.
- R is in slot 2 (conflict).

Try ""GRIST"":
- G, R, I, S, T.
- R is in slot 2 (conflict).

Try ""BRISK"":
- B, R, I, S, K.
- R is in slot 2 (conflict).

Try ""FRISK"" again (already tried).

Try ""TRIPS"":
- T, R, I, P, S.
- R is in slot 2 (conflict).

Try ""URBIS"" (but not a common word).

Try ""CRISP"" again (R in slot 2).

Try ""PRISM"":
- P, R, I, S, M.
- R is in slot 2 (conflict).

Try ""DRIPS"" again (R in slot 2).

Try ""GRITS"":
- G, R, I, T, S.
- R is in slot 2 (conflict).

Try ""BRISK"" again (R in slot 2).

Try ""TRUST"" again (R in slot 2).

Hmm, many common words place R in slot 2. Let's try a word where R is in slot 1 or 3 or 4 or 5, and S is in slot 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Word like ""SIRKS"" (but not common).

Try ""SIRKS"" → S in slot 1, R in slot 2 (conflict).

Try ""SIRUP"" → S in slot 1, R in slot 2 (conflict).

Try ""SINKS"" → S in slot 1, R not present (need R).

Try ""SCRIN"" (archaic, but valid).

Try ""SCRIP"" → S, C, R, I, P.
- S is in slot 1 (allowed, since original S was in slot 4).
- R is in slot 3 (allowed, since original R was in slot 2).
- Uses C, I, P (new letters).
- Avoids A, O, E.

This seems valid.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A, O, E are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. SCRIP → S(-) C(x) R(✓) I(-) P(x)
   - C and P are not in the word.
   - R is in position 3 (✓) → so R is fixed at position 3.
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - I is in the word but not in position 4.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ R _ _
- Letters in word: R (fixed at 3), S (somewhere except 1 or 4), I (somewhere except 4), plus any other letters not yet ruled out.
- Letters ruled out: A, O, E, C, P.

Remaining letters to consider: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- R in position 3.
- S not in positions 1 or 4.
- I not in position 4.
- No A, O, E, C, P.

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5. But 3 is R, so S can be 2 or 5.
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 3, 5. But 3 is R, so I can be 1, 2, or 5.

Let's brainstorm words:
- If S is in position 2: _ S R _ _
  - I must be in 1, 5 (can't be 4, already excluded).
  - Example: I S R _ _ → but need 5 letters.
  - Try ""ISRID"" (invalid), ""ISRUM"" (invalid), ""ISRIT"" (invalid).
  - Maybe ""TURNS"" (but R not in 3).
  - Wait, need R in 3.

Better approach: list words with R in position 3, no A/O/E/C/P, and containing S and I appropriately.

Possible words:
- ""DRISL"" (invalid)
- ""BRISK"" → B R I S K → R is 2, not 3. No.
- ""GRIST"" → G R I S T → R is 2. No.
- ""TRIUM"" → R is 2. No.
- ""FRISE"" → E is excluded.
- ""FRISK"" → R is 2. No.
- ""BRUIS"" → U is allowed, R is 2. No.
- ""URBIS"" → R is 2. No.
- ""TRIPS"" → R is 2. No.
- ""DRIPS"" → R is 2. No.
- ""SCRUB"" → R is 2. No.

Hmm, seems like many common words have R in 2 or 4. Let's think differently.

We need R in position 3. So the word is: _ _ R _ _

Letters allowed: S, I, plus others not in excluded list.

Possible words:
- ""BURIN"" → B U R I N → R is 3, S is missing.
- ""BURKS"" → B U R K S → R is 3, S is 5 (allowed), I is missing.
- ""BURIN"" doesn't have I.
- ""FRUIT"" → R is 2. No.
- ""GRIMY"" → R is 2. No.
- ""PRISM"" → R is 2. No.
- ""TRIMS"" → R is 2. No.
- ""BRISK"" → R is 2. No.

Wait, let's think of words with R in position 3, and containing S and I.

Possible patterns:
- _ I R S _ → but S can't be 4.
- _ S R I _ → S is 2 (allowed), I is 4 (but I can't be 4).
- _ I R _ S → I is 2 (allowed), S is 5 (allowed).
- _ S R _ I → S is 2 (allowed), I is 5 (allowed).
- _ _ R I S → I is 4 (invalid), S is 5 (allowed) but I is invalid.
- _ _ R S I → S is 4 (invalid), I is 5 (allowed) but S is invalid.

So possible valid patterns:
1. _ I R _ S → I in 2, S in 5.
2. _ S R _ I → S in 2, I in 5.

Let's try pattern 1: _ I R _ S
Possible first letter: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Possible fourth letter: same set, but not repeating excluded letters.

Example: B I R K S → ""BIRKS"" (valid word, past tense of ""birk"").
Check constraints:
- R is 3 (✓)
- S is 5 (allowed, not 1 or 4)
- I is 2 (allowed, not 4)
- No A, O, E, C, P.

This seems valid.

Another example: T I R N S → ""TIRNS"" (valid word, past tense of ""tirn"").
But ""BIRKS"" is more common.

Let's go with ""BIRKS"".Based on the feedback:
- R is fixed in position 3.
- S is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4 → possible positions 2 or 5.
- I is in the word but not in position 4 → possible positions 1, 2, or 5.
- Excluded letters: A, O, E, C, P.

A valid word fitting these constraints is ""BIRKS"".

- Position 3: R (✓)
- Position 4: unknown (not A, O, E, C, P, K)

- V I R T S → ""VIRTS"" (valid, plural of vert)

Among these, ""DIRGS"", ""GIRTS"", ""HIRTS"", ""LIRTS"", ""NIRTS"", ""TIRNS"", ""VIRTS"" are all valid. The most common-sounding word is ""DIRGS"".

Let's choose ""DIRGS"".
