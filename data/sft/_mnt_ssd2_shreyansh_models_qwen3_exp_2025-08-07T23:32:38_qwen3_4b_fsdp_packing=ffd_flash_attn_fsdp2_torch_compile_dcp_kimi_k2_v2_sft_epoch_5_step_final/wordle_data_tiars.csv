For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common consonants like R, S, T, L, N, and vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices. A popular starting word is ""SLATE"" because it covers several common letters and provides good coverage for both vowels and consonants. However, ""AROSE"" is another excellent choice as it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it gives us good coverage of common letters and will help us quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(x) → O is not in the word
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4
- E(x) → E is not in the word

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: O, E
- Letters that ARE in the word (somewhere): A, R, S
- A cannot be in position 1
- R cannot be in position 2

We need a new 5-letter word that:

Possible positions:

- R can be in positions 1,3,4,5
- S can be in positions 1,2,3,5

- Has S in position 1 (allowed)
- Has T (new letter)
- Has A in position 3 (allowed)
- Has R in position 4 (allowed)
- Doesn’t use O or E

- Contains T, R, A, S, H
- T is new
- R is in position 2 (but feedback said R is not in position 2) → this violates the constraint.

Next option: “CRASH”:

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are definitely in the word (somewhere):
- A (from both guesses, but never in the first position)
- R (never in the second position)
- S (never in the fourth position)

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
- O, E, P, Y

Positions ruled out so far:
- A: not position 1, not position 2
- R: not position 2, not position 1
- S: not position 4, not position 3

So the remaining possible positions for each known letter are:
- A: 3, 4, 5
- R: 3, 4, 5
- S: 1, 2, 5

We still need two more distinct letters (since we already have A, R, S). Good remaining consonants include T, N, L, D, M, etc. and the only remaining vowel is I or U (since A is already used and O, E are out).

Let’s try a word that:
- Uses A, R, S in allowable positions
- Adds two new letters that are still common
- Avoids any of the forbidden letters (O, E, P, Y)

A promising candidate is “STAIR”:
- S in position 1 (allowed)
- T (new)
- A in position 3 (allowed)
- I (new vowel)
- R in position 5 (allowed)

This satisfies all constraints.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common consonants like R, S, T, L, N, and vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices. A popular starting word is ""SLATE"" because it covers several common letters and provides good coverage for both vowels and consonants. However, ""AROSE"" is another excellent choice as it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it gives us good coverage of common letters and will help us quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(x) → O is not in the word
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4
- E(x) → E is not in the word

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: O, E
- Letters that ARE in the word (somewhere): A, R, S
- A cannot be in position 1
- R cannot be in position 2
- S cannot be in position 4

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, R, S
2. Does NOT contain O or E
3. Places A, R, S in positions they haven’t been ruled out for

Possible positions:
- A can be in positions 2,3,4,5
- R can be in positions 1,3,4,5
- S can be in positions 1,2,3,5

Let’s try a word that rearranges these letters and adds two new consonants that are still common (like T, N, L, etc.). A good candidate is “STARS”:
- Contains S, T, A, R, S
- Has S in position 1 (allowed)
- Has T (new letter)
- Has A in position 3 (allowed)
- Has R in position 4 (allowed)
- Doesn’t use O or E

However, “STARS” has two S’s, which might not be ideal for information gain. A better choice might be “TRASH”:
- Contains T, R, A, S, H
- T is new
- R is in position 2 (but feedback said R is not in position 2) → this violates the constraint.

Next option: “CRASH”:
- C, R, A, S, H
- R in position 2 → again violates the constraint.

Next: “GRASP”:

From the latest feedback on ISART:

- I(-)  → I is in the word but NOT in position 1  
- S(-)  → S is in the word but NOT in position 2  
- A(✓) → A is correct in position 3  
- R(✓) → R is correct in position 4  
- T(-) → T is in the word but NOT in position 5  

So the pattern so far is:  
_ _ A R _  

Letters confirmed to be present: A, R, S, T, I  
Letters ruled out: O, E, P, Y  

Positions still open: 1 and 5  

Constraints on the remaining letters:  
- S cannot be in 2 (already satisfied) or 3,4 → must be in 1 or 5  
- T cannot be in 1,2,4,5 → must be in 1 (but 1 is open)  
- I cannot be in 3,4,5 → must be in 1 or 2  

Let’s list the only possible placements:

1. Position 1: must be S, T, or I  
   - If S: then position 5 must be T or I, but T is already required somewhere and can’t be in 5. So T must be in 1 → T _ A R _  
   - If T: then position 5 must be S or I, but S can’t be in 5 (only 1,2 allowed). So S must be in 5 → _ _ A R S  
   - If I: then position 5 must be S or T, but T can’t be in 5. So S must be in 5 → _ _ A R S  

2. Position 2: can be S, T, or I

- _ I A R S : position 1 must be T or S. T can be in 1, S can be in 1 but we have S in 5 already. So T I A R S is possible.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common consonants like R, S, T, L, N, and vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices. A popular starting word is ""SLATE"" because it covers several common letters and provides good coverage for both vowels and consonants. However, ""AROSE"" is another excellent choice as it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it gives us good coverage of common letters and will help us quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(x) → O is not in the word
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4
- E(x) → E is not in the word

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: O, E
- Letters that ARE in the word (somewhere): A, R, S
- A cannot be in position 1
- R cannot be in position 2
- S cannot be in position 4

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, R, S
2. Does NOT contain O or E
3. Places A, R, S in positions they haven’t been ruled out for

Possible positions:
- A can be in positions 2,3,4,5
- R can be in positions 1,3,4,5
- S can be in positions 1,2,3,5

Let’s try a word that rearranges these letters and adds two new consonants that are still common (like T, N, L, etc.). A good candidate is “STARS”:
- Contains S, T, A, R, S
- Has S in position 1 (allowed)
- Has T (new letter)
- Has A in position 3 (allowed)
- Has R in position 4 (allowed)
- Doesn’t use O or E

However, “STARS” has two S’s, which might not be ideal for information gain. A better choice might be “TRASH”:
- Contains T, R, A, S, H
- T is new
- R is in position 2 (but feedback said R is not in position 2) → this violates the constraint.

Next option: “CRASH”:
- C, R, A, S, H
- R in position 2 → again violates the constraint.

Next: “GRASP”:
- G, R, A, S, P
- R in position 2 → violates.

Next: “RASPY”:
- R, A, S, P, Y
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- S in position 3 (allowed)
- P and Y are new letters
- Doesn’t use O or E

This seems valid. Let’s go with “RASPY”.

Guess 2: RASPY -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) S(-) P(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are definitely in the word (somewhere):
- A (from both guesses, but never in the first position)
- R (never in the second position)
- S (never in the fourth position)

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
- O, E, P, Y

Positions ruled out so far:
- A: not position 1, not position 2
- R: not position 2, not position 1
- S: not position 4, not position 3

So the remaining possible positions for each known letter are:
- A: 3, 4, 5
- R: 3, 4, 5
- S: 1, 2, 5

We still need two more distinct letters (since we already have A, R, S). Good remaining consonants include T, N, L, D, M, etc. and the only remaining vowel is I or U (since A is already used and O, E are out).

Let’s try a word that:
- Uses A, R, S in allowable positions
- Adds two new letters that are still common
- Avoids any of the forbidden letters (O, E, P, Y)

A promising candidate is “STAIR”:
- S in position 1 (allowed)
- T (new)
- A in position 3 (allowed)
- I (new vowel)
- R in position 5 (allowed)

This satisfies all constraints.

From all feedback so far:

Letters that are definitely in the word:
- A (now known to be in position 3)
- R
- S
- T
- I

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- O, E, P, Y

Positions we now know:
- A is fixed in position 3: _ _ A _ _
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 5
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4
- T is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 4
- I is in the word but NOT in positions 3, 4, 5

Therefore:
- R can only be in position 4
- S can only be in position 2
- T can only be in position 5
- I can only be in position 1

This gives us the unique arrangement:
I  S  A  R  T

All letters are distinct and fit the constraints.

- A(✓) → A is correct in position 3

So the pattern so far is:

Letters confirmed to be present: A, R, S, T, I  
Letters ruled out: O, E, P, Y

- T cannot be in 1,2,4,5 → must be in 1 (but 1 is open)  
- I cannot be in 3,4,5 → must be in 1 or 2  

Let’s list the only possible placements:

1. Position 1: must be S, T, or I  
   - If S: then position 5 must be T or I, but T is already required somewhere and can’t be in 5. So T must be in 1 → T _ A R _

   - If I: then position 5 must be S or T, but T can’t be in 5. So S must be in 5 → _ _ A R S  

2. Position 2: can be S, T, or I  
   - If S: then position 1 must be T or I. T can’t be in 1 (no restriction), I can’t be in 1. So T must be in 1 → T S A R _  
   - If T: then position 1 must be S or I. S can be in 1, I can’t be in 1. So S must be in 1 → S T A R _  
   - If I: then position 5 must be S or T. T can’t be in 5, so S must be in 5 → _ I A R S  

Now check which of these fit all constraints:

- T S A R _ : position 5 must be S or I, but S is already used in 2, I can’t be in 5. No valid letter left.  
- S T A R _ : position 5 must be S or I. S is already used in 2, I can’t be in 5. No valid letter left.  
- _ I A R S : position 1 must be T or S. T can be in 1, S can be in 1 but we have S in 5 already. So T I A R S is possible.  

Check T I A R S:
