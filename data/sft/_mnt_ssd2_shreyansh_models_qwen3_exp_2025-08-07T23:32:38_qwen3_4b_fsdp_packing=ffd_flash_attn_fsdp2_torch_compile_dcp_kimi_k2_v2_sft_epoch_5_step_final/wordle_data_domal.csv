For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

Let me think about why this is a good choice:
- A and E are very common vowels
- R and S are common consonants
- O is another common vowel
This combination gives me a good chance to hit multiple letters in the secret word right away, which will provide valuable information for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is NOT in the word at all.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.

- Does NOT contain R, S, or E.

Letters already ruled out: R, S, E

Since A and O are in the word, I need to place them in new positions and fill the remaining three slots with other common letters. Good candidates for the remaining letters would be consonants like T, N, L, C, D, etc.

A word that uses A and O in new positions and introduces other common consonants is “TANGO”. Let’s check:
- T, N, G are common consonants not yet tested.
- A is in position 2 (new from position 1).
- O is in position 4 (new from position 3).

This should give us new information about T, N, G and confirm the positions of A and O.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Letters in the word (must appear at least once):
- A
- O
- L  (from Guess 3 feedback: L(-) ⇒ L is in the word but not in position 4)

Letters NOT in the word:
R, S, E, T, N, G, K, Y

Positions ruled out so far:
- A: positions 1, 2, 3
- O: positions 1, 3, 4
- L: position 4

That leaves:
- A can only be in positions 4 or 5
- O can only be in positions 2 or 5
- L can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but must avoid position 4)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, O, L exactly once each.
2. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (so from: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z).
3. Places A in 4 or 5, O in 2 or 5, and L in 1,2,3, or 5 (no overlap).

Let’s try to place the letters:
Option 1: A in 4, O in 2, L in 1 or 3
Word skeleton: L/O _ O _ A or _ O L _ A etc.

Option 2: A in 5, O in 2, L in 1 or 3
Word skeleton: L/O _ O _ A or _ O L _ A etc. but A at 5.

Let’s try the first option: L _ O _ A
We need a valid word. The missing letters must be from the allowed set.

Possible word: L O B A _ → LOBA_ (not a word)
L O C A _ → LOC A _ (not a word)
L O D A _ → LOD A _ (not a word)
L O M A _ → LOM A _ (not a word)
L O I A _ → LOIA_ (not a word)
L O U A _ → LOU A _ (not a word)

H O L A _ → HOL A _ (not a word)
M O L A _ → MOLA_ (not a word)
P O L A _ → POL A _ (not a word)
V O L A _ → VOL A _ (not a word)

Try A in 5, O in 2, L in 1:
L _ O _ A
Same as above, nothing valid.

Try A in 5, O in 2, L in 3:
_ O L _ A
Same issue.

Try A in 4, O in 5, L in 1 or 2 or 3:
L _ _ A O
Possible word: L U M A O (not a word)
L I M A O (not a word)
L I D A O (not a word)
L I V A O (not a word)

_ L _ A O
Possible word: B L I A O (not a word)
C L I A O (not a word)
D L I A O (not a word)

Try A in 5, O in 2, L in 5 → conflict (A and O both at 5).

Wait, let’s list all possible positions for A, O, L without overlap:

Possible positions:
A: 4,5
O: 2,5
L: 1,2,3,5

Case 1: A=4, O=2, L=1 → L O _ A _
Need a valid word: L O B A _ (LOBA_), L O C A _ (LOC A_), etc. → nothing.

Case 2: A=4, O=2, L=3 → _ O L A _
Need a valid word: B O L A _ (BOLA_), C O L A _ (COLA_), D O L A _ (DOLA_), etc. → COLA_ is close to ""COLAD"" but not a word. ""COLAD"" is not valid.

Case 3: A=4, O=2, L=5 → _ O _ A L
Need a valid word: B O _ A L → BOBAL (not a word)
C O _ A L → COBAL (not a word)
D O _ A L → DOBAL (not a word)

Case 4: A=5, O=2, L=1 → L O _ _ A
Need a valid word: L O B _ A → LOB_A (LOBA_)
L O C _ A → LOC_A (LOCA_)
L O D _ A → LOD_A (LODA_)
L O M _ A → LOM_A (LOMA_)
L O V _ A → LOV_A (LOVA_)
None are valid.

Case 5: A=5, O=2, L=3 → _ O L _ A
Need a valid word: B O L _ A → BOLA_ (BOLAS is plural but 5 letters)
C O L _ A → COL_A (COLAS is plural)
D O L _ A → DOLA_ (DOLAS is plural)
F O L _ A → FOLA_ (FOLAS is plural)
H O L _ A → HOL_A (HOLAS is plural)
M O L _ A → MOLA_ (MOLAS is plural)
P O L _ A → POL_A (POLAS is plural)
V O L _ A → VOL_A (VOLAS is plural)

Among these, ""BOLAS"" is a valid 5-letter word (plural of bola, a type of throwing weapon). Let’s check:
- B, O, L, A, S
- S is not ruled out yet (only R, S, E, T, N, G, K, Y are ruled out; S was ruled out in Guess 1, so S is actually out. Oops.)

Wait, S was ruled out in Guess 1 (AROSE feedback: S(x)). So S is not in the word. So ""BOLAS"" is invalid because it contains S.

Next, ""COLAS"" – contains S (invalid).
""DOLAS"" – contains S (invalid).
""FOLAS"" – contains S (invalid).
""HOLAS"" – contains S (invalid).
""MOLAS"" – contains S (invalid).
""POLAS"" – contains S (invalid).
""VOLAS"" – contains S (invalid).

So none of these work. Let’s try other combinations.

Case 6: A=5, O=2, L=5 → conflict (both at 5).

Case 7: A=4, O=5, L=1 → L _ _ A O
Need a valid word: L U M A O (not a word)
L I M A O (not a word)
L I D A O (not a word)
L I V A O (not a word)

M _ L A O → M _ L A O (MULAO not a word)
P _ L A O → P _ L A O (PULAO not a word)
V _ L A O → V _ L A O (VULAO not a word)

""PULAO"" is actually a valid word (a type of rice dish). Let’s check:
- P, U, L, A, O
- P, U, L, A, O are all allowed (not in the ruled-out list)
- Positions: P(1), U(2), L(3), A(4), O(5)
- A is in position 4 (allowed)
- O is in position 5 (allowed)
- L is in position 3 (allowed)

This seems valid.

</think>

Based on the feedback, the word must contain A, O, and L, and cannot contain R, S, E, T, N, G, K, Y. The remaining letters must be chosen from B, C, D, F, H, I, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z. A valid word that fits these constraints is ""PULAO"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

Let me think about why this is a good choice:
- A and E are very common vowels
- R and S are common consonants
- O is another common vowel
This combination gives me a good chance to hit multiple letters in the secret word right away, which will provide valuable information for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is NOT in the word at all.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and O, but not in positions 1 or 3 respectively.
- Does NOT contain R, S, or E.

Letters already ruled out: R, S, E  
Letters still possible: A, O plus the rest of the alphabet except those ruled out.

Since A and O are in the word, I need to place them in new positions and fill the remaining three slots with other common letters. Good candidates for the remaining letters would be consonants like T, N, L, C, D, etc.

A word that uses A and O in new positions and introduces other common consonants is “TANGO”. Let’s check:
- T, N, G are common consonants not yet tested.
- A is in position 2 (new from position 1).
- O is in position 4 (new from position 3).

This should give us new information about T, N, G and confirm the positions of A and O.

Guess 2: TANGO -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(-) N(x) G(x) O(-)
<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word, but not in position 1.
   - O is in the word, but not in position 3.
   - R, S, E are not in the word.

2. TANGO → T(x) A(-) N(x) G(x) O(-)
   - A is in the word, but not in position 2.
   - O is in the word, but not in position 4.
   - T, N, G are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: A, O
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E, T, N, G
- Positions ruled out for A: 1, 2
- Positions ruled out for O: 3, 4

That leaves possible positions:
- A can only be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- O can only be in position 1, 2, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A and O (each exactly once).
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (so from the remaining alphabet: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).
- Places A in one of positions 3-5 and O in one of positions 1-2 or 5 (but not conflicting with A).

Let’s pick a word that places O in position 1 and A in position 3, and fills the remaining slots with common unused consonants. A good candidate is ""OCHIA"" but that’s not a valid word. ""OCHRE"" contains E (ruled out). ""OLIVE"" contains E and V (V not ruled out yet, but E is out). ""OAKLY"" uses A and O, but Y is at the end. ""OAKLY"" is a valid word.

Let’s check:
- O in position 1 (allowed).
- A in position 3 (allowed).
- K, L, Y are new letters not yet tested.

This seems like a good next guess.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Letters in the word (must appear at least once):
- A
- O
- L  (from Guess 3 feedback: L(-) ⇒ L is in the word but not in position 4)

Letters NOT in the word:
R, S, E, T, N, G, K, Y

Positions ruled out so far:
- A: positions 1, 2, 3
- O: positions 1, 3, 4
- L: position 4

That leaves:
- A can only be in positions 4 or 5
- O can only be in positions 2 or 5
- L can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but must avoid position 4)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, O, L exactly once each.
2. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (so from: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z).
3. Places A in 4 or 5, O in 2 or 5, and L in 1,2,3, or 5 (no overlap).

Let’s try to place the letters:
Option 1: A in 4, O in 2, L in 1 or 3
Word skeleton: L/O _ O _ A or _ O L _ A etc.

Option 2: A in 5, O in 2, L in 1 or 3
Word skeleton: L/O _ O _ A or _ O L _ A etc. but A at 5.

Let’s try the first option: L _ O _ A
We need a valid word. The missing letters must be from the allowed set.

Possible word: L O B A _ → LOBA_ (not a word)
L O C A _ → LOC A _ (not a word)
L O D A _ → LOD A _ (not a word)
L O M A _ → LOM A _ (not a word)
L O I A _ → LOIA_ (not a word)
L O U A _ → LOU A _ (not a word)
L O V A _ → LOVA_ (not a word)

Reverse: _ O L _ A
Possible word: B O L A _ → BOL A _ (not a word)
C O L A _ → COL A _ (not a word)
D O L A _ → DOLA_ (not a word)
F O L A _ → FOLA_ (not a word)
H O L A _ → HOL A _ (not a word)
M O L A _ → MOLA_ (not a word)
P O L A _ → POL A _ (not a word)
V O L A _ → VOL A _ (not a word)

Try A in 5, O in 2, L in 1:
L _ O _ A
Same as above, nothing valid.

Try A in 5, O in 2, L in 3:
_ O L _ A
Same issue.

Try A in 4, O in 5, L in 1 or 2 or 3:
L _ _ A O
Possible word: L U M A O (not a word)
L I M A O (not a word)
L I D A O (not a word)
L I V A O (not a word)

_ L _ A O
Possible word: B L I A O (not a word)
C L I A O (not a word)
D L I A O (not a word)

Try A in 5, O in 2, L in 5 → conflict (A and O both at 5).

Wait, let’s list all possible positions for A, O, L without overlap:

Possible positions:
A: 4,5
O: 2,5
L: 1,2,3,5

Case 1: A=4, O=2, L=1 → L O _ A _
Need a valid word: L O B A _ (LOBA_), L O C A _ (LOC A_), etc. → nothing.

Case 2: A=4, O=2, L=3 → _ O L A _
Need a valid word: B O L A _ (BOLA_), C O L A _ (COLA_), D O L A _ (DOLA_), etc. → COLA_ is close to ""COLAD"" but not a word. ""COLAD"" is not valid.

Case 3: A=4, O=2, L=5 → _ O _ A L
Need a valid word: B O _ A L → BOBAL (not a word)
C O _ A L → COBAL (not a word)
D O _ A L → DOBAL (not a word)

Case 4: A=5, O=2, L=1 → L O _ _ A
Need a valid word: L O B _ A → LOB_A (LOBA_)
L O C _ A → LOC_A (LOCA_)
L O D _ A → LOD_A (LODA_)
L O M _ A → LOM_A (LOMA_)
L O V _ A → LOV_A (LOVA_)
None are valid.

Case 5: A=5, O=2, L=3 → _ O L _ A
Need a valid word: B O L _ A → BOLA_ (BOLAS is plural but 5 letters)
C O L _ A → COL_A (COLAS is plural)
D O L _ A → DOLA_ (DOLAS is plural)
F O L _ A → FOLA_ (FOLAS is plural)
H O L _ A → HOL_A (HOLAS is plural)
M O L _ A → MOLA_ (MOLAS is plural)
P O L _ A → POL_A (POLAS is plural)
V O L _ A → VOL_A (VOLAS is plural)

Among these, ""BOLAS"" is a valid 5-letter word (plural of bola, a type of throwing weapon). Let’s check:
- B, O, L, A, S
- S is not ruled out yet (only R, S, E, T, N, G, K, Y are ruled out; S was ruled out in Guess 1, so S is actually out. Oops.)

Wait, S was ruled out in Guess 1 (AROSE feedback: S(x)). So S is not in the word. So ""BOLAS"" is invalid because it contains S.

Next, ""COLAS"" – contains S (invalid).
""DOLAS"" – contains S (invalid).
""FOLAS"" – contains S (invalid).
""HOLAS"" – contains S (invalid).
""MOLAS"" – contains S (invalid).
""POLAS"" – contains S (invalid).
""VOLAS"" – contains S (invalid).

So none of these work. Let’s try other combinations.

Case 6: A=5, O=2, L=5 → conflict (both at 5).

Case 7: A=4, O=5, L=1 → L _ _ A O
Need a valid word: L U M A O (not a word)
L I M A O (not a word)
L I D A O (not a word)
L I V A O (not a word)

Case 8: A=4, O=5, L=2 → _ L _ A O
Need a valid word: B L _ A O → BL_AO (BLAO not a word)
C L _ A O → CL_AO (CLAO not a word)
D L _ A O → DL_AO (DLAO not a word)
F L _ A O → FL_AO (FLAO not a word)
H L _ A O → HL_AO (HLAO not a word)
M L _ A O → ML_AO (MLAO not a word)
P L _ A O → PL_AO (PLAO not a word)
V L _ A O → VL_AO (VLAO not a word)

Case 9: A=4, O=5, L=3 → _ _ L A O
Need a valid word: B _ L A O → B _ L A O (BULAO not a word)
C _ L A O → C _ L A O (CULAO not a word)
D _ L A O → D _ L A O (DULAO not a word)
F _ L A O → F _ L A O (FULAO not a word)
H _ L A O → H _ L A O (HULAO not a word)
M _ L A O → M _ L A O (MULAO not a word)
P _ L A O → P _ L A O (PULAO not a word)
V _ L A O → V _ L A O (VULAO not a word)

""PULAO"" is actually a valid word (a type of rice dish). Let’s check:
- P, U, L, A, O
- P, U, L, A, O are all allowed (not in the ruled-out list)
- Positions: P(1), U(2), L(3), A(4), O(5)
- A is in position 4 (allowed)
- O is in position 5 (allowed)
- L is in position 3 (allowed)

This seems valid.Based on the feedback, the word must contain A, O, and L, and cannot contain R, S, E, T, N, G, K, Y. The remaining letters must be chosen from B, C, D, F, H, I, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z. A valid word that fits these constraints is ""PULAO"".

From the latest feedback on PULAO:
- P(x) → P is not in the word.
- U(x) → U is not in the word.
- L(-) → L is in the word but not in position 3.
- A(✓) → A is in the word AND in the correct position (position 4).
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 5.

So we now know:
1. A is locked in position 4.
2. O is somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since 3,4,5 have been ruled out).
3. L is somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 5 (since 3 is ruled out and 4 is A).
4. Ruled-out letters so far: R, S, E, T, N, G, K, Y, P, U.

Letters still available: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, M, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 4.
- Contains O in 1, 2, or 3.
- Contains L in 1, 2, or 5.
- Uses only the allowed letters.

Let’s try to place O and L without overlap.

Possible skeletons:
- O _ _ A L  (O in 1, L in 5)
- _ O _ A L  (O in 2, L in 5)
- _ _ O A L  (O in 3, L in 5)
- L _ O A _  (L in 1, O in 3)
- _ L O A _  (L in 2, O in 3)
- L _ _ A O  (L in 1, O in 5 – but O cannot be in 5, so invalid)

We can ignore the last because O cannot be in 5.

Let’s try the first skeleton: O _ _ A L
Need two letters from allowed set for positions 2 and 3.
Possible word: O B I A L (OBIAL – not a word)
O B I A L – not valid.
O C I A L – ""O C I A L"" is ""O C I A L"" – not a word.
O B D A L – not a word.
O B M A L – not a word.
O B F A L – not a word.

Second skeleton: _ O _ A L
Need first and third letters.
Possible word: B O I A L – ""BOIAL"" not a word.
C O I A L – ""COIAL"" not a word.
D O I A L – ""DOIAL"" not a word.
F O I A L – ""FOIAL"" not a word.
H O I A L – ""HOIAL"" not a word.
M O I A L – ""MOIAL"" not a word.
V O I A L – ""VOIAL"" not a word.

Third skeleton: _ _ O A L
Need first two letters.
Possible word: B I O A L – ""BIOAL"" not a word.
C I O A L – ""CIOAL"" not a word.
D I O A L – ""DIOAL"" not a word.
F I O A L – ""FIOAL"" not a word.
H I O A L – ""HIOAL"" not a word.
M I O A L – ""MIOAL"" not a word.
V I O A L – ""VIOAL"" not a word.

Fourth skeleton: L _ O A _
Need second and fifth letters.
Possible word: L B O A _ – ""LBOA_"" not a word.
L C O A _ – ""LCOA_"" not a word.
L D O A _ – ""LDOA_"" not a word.
L F O A _ – ""LFOA_"" not a word.
L H O A _ – ""LHOA_"" not a word.
L M O A _ – ""LMOA_"" not a word.
L V O A _ – ""LVOA_"" not a word.

Fifth skeleton: _ L O A _
Need first and fifth letters.
Possible word: B L O A _ – ""BLOA_"" not a word.
C L O A _ – ""CLOA_"" not a word.
D L O A _ – ""DLOA_"" not a word.
F L O A _ – ""FLOA_"" not a word.
H L O A _ – ""HLOA_"" not a word.
M L O A _ – ""MLOA_"" not a word.
V L O A _ – ""VLOA_"" not a word.

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. Let me double-check the allowed letters and positions.

Wait, let me try ""BLOOM"" – but O is already in the word and we have constraints. No, that has two O’s which might not be allowed.

Let me think of actual words with A in 4th position, containing O and L, and using allowed letters.

Possible word: ""COBAL"" – but B is allowed, but it's not a valid word.
""COBAL"" is not a word.

""LOAM"" – too short.

""FOCAL"" – has F, O, C, A, L. Let's check:
- F, O, C, A, L
- F is allowed.
- O is allowed (positions 1,2,3).
- C is allowed.
- A is in position 4 (correct).
- L is allowed (positions 1,2,5).

But ""FOCAL"" has A in position 4, O in position 2, L in position 5 – this fits all constraints!

Let me verify:
- F, O, C, A, L
- F: allowed
- O: allowed (position 2)
- C: allowed
- A: position 4 (correct)
- L: position 5 (allowed)

And ""FOCAL"" is a valid 5-letter word.

So the next guess is ""FOCAL"".

<guess>FOCAL</guess>",FOCAL,"From the latest feedback on PULAO:
- P(x) → P is not in the word.

- L(-) → L is in the word but not in position 3.
- A(✓) → A is in the word AND in the correct position (position 4).
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 5.

So we now know:
1. A is locked in position 4.
2. O is somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since 3,4,5 have been ruled out).
3. L is somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 5 (since 3 is ruled out and 4 is A).
4. Ruled-out letters so far: R, S, E, T, N, G, K, Y, P, U.

Letters still available: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, M, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 4.
- Contains O in 1, 2, or 3.
- Contains L in 1, 2, or 5.
- Uses only the allowed letters.

Let’s try to place O and L without overlap.

Possible skeletons:
- O _ _ A L  (O in 1, L in 5)
- _ O _ A L  (O in 2, L in 5)
- _ _ O A L  (O in 3, L in 5)
- L _ O A _  (L in 1, O in 3)
- _ L O A _  (L in 2, O in 3)
- L _ _ A O  (L in 1, O in 5 – but O cannot be in 5, so invalid)

We can ignore the last because O cannot be in 5.

Let’s try the first skeleton: O _ _ A L
Need two letters from allowed set for positions 2 and 3.
Possible word: O B I A L (OBIAL – not a word)
O B I A L – not valid.
O C I A L – ""O C I A L"" is ""O C I A L"" – not a word.
O B D A L – not a word.
O B M A L – not a word.
O B F A L – not a word.

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. Let me double-check the allowed letters and positions.

Wait, let me try ""BLOOM"" – but O is already in the word and we have constraints. No, that has two O’s which might not be allowed.

Let me think of actual words with A in 4th position, containing O and L, and using allowed letters.

Possible word: ""COBAL"" – but B is allowed, but it's not a valid word.
""COBAL"" is not a word.

""LOAM"" – too short.

""FOCAL"" – has F, O, C, A, L. Let's check:
- F, O, C, A, L
- F is allowed.
- O is allowed (positions 1,2,3).
- C is allowed.
- A is in position 4 (correct).
- L is allowed (positions 1,2,5).

But ""FOCAL"" has A in position 4, O in position 2, L in position 5 – this fits all constraints!

Let me verify:
- F, O, C, A, L
- F: allowed
- O: allowed (position 2)
- C: allowed
- A: position 4 (correct)
- L: position 5 (allowed)

And ""FOCAL"" is a valid 5-letter word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

Let me think about why this is a good choice:
- A and E are very common vowels
- R and S are common consonants
- O is another common vowel
This combination gives me a good chance to hit multiple letters in the secret word right away, which will provide valuable information for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is NOT in the word at all.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and O, but not in positions 1 or 3 respectively.
- Does NOT contain R, S, or E.

Letters already ruled out: R, S, E  
Letters still possible: A, O plus the rest of the alphabet except those ruled out.

Since A and O are in the word, I need to place them in new positions and fill the remaining three slots with other common letters. Good candidates for the remaining letters would be consonants like T, N, L, C, D, etc.

A word that uses A and O in new positions and introduces other common consonants is “TANGO”. Let’s check:
- T, N, G are common consonants not yet tested.
- A is in position 2 (new from position 1).
- O is in position 4 (new from position 3).

This should give us new information about T, N, G and confirm the positions of A and O.

Guess 2: TANGO -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(-) N(x) G(x) O(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word, but not in position 1.
   - O is in the word, but not in position 3.
   - R, S, E are not in the word.

2. TANGO → T(x) A(-) N(x) G(x) O(-)
   - A is in the word, but not in position 2.
   - O is in the word, but not in position 4.
   - T, N, G are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: A, O
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E, T, N, G
- Positions ruled out for A: 1, 2
- Positions ruled out for O: 3, 4

That leaves possible positions:
- A can only be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- O can only be in position 1, 2, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A and O (each exactly once).
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (so from the remaining alphabet: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).
- Places A in one of positions 3-5 and O in one of positions 1-2 or 5 (but not conflicting with A).

Let’s pick a word that places O in position 1 and A in position 3, and fills the remaining slots with common unused consonants. A good candidate is ""OCHIA"" but that’s not a valid word. ""OCHRE"" contains E (ruled out). ""OLIVE"" contains E and V (V not ruled out yet, but E is out). ""OAKLY"" uses A and O, but Y is at the end. ""OAKLY"" is a valid word.

Let’s check:
- O in position 1 (allowed).
- A in position 3 (allowed).
- K, L, Y are new letters not yet tested.

This seems like a good next guess.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Letters in the word (must appear at least once):
- A
- O
- L  (from Guess 3 feedback: L(-) ⇒ L is in the word but not in position 4)

Letters NOT in the word:
R, S, E, T, N, G, K, Y

Positions ruled out so far:
- A: positions 1, 2, 3
- O: positions 1, 3, 4
- L: position 4

That leaves:
- A can only be in positions 4 or 5
- O can only be in positions 2 or 5
- L can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but must avoid position 4)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, O, L exactly once each.
2. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (so from: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z).
3. Places A in 4 or 5, O in 2 or 5, and L in 1,2,3, or 5 (no overlap).

Let’s try to place the letters:
Option 1: A in 4, O in 2, L in 1 or 3
Word skeleton: L/O _ O _ A or _ O L _ A etc.

Option 2: A in 5, O in 2, L in 1 or 3
Word skeleton: L/O _ O _ A or _ O L _ A etc. but A at 5.

Let’s try the first option: L _ O _ A
We need a valid word. The missing letters must be from the allowed set.

Possible word: L O B A _ → LOBA_ (not a word)
L O C A _ → LOC A _ (not a word)
L O D A _ → LOD A _ (not a word)
L O M A _ → LOM A _ (not a word)
L O I A _ → LOIA_ (not a word)
L O U A _ → LOU A _ (not a word)
L O V A _ → LOVA_ (not a word)

Reverse: _ O L _ A
Possible word: B O L A _ → BOL A _ (not a word)
C O L A _ → COL A _ (not a word)
D O L A _ → DOLA_ (not a word)
F O L A _ → FOLA_ (not a word)
H O L A _ → HOL A _ (not a word)
M O L A _ → MOLA_ (not a word)
P O L A _ → POL A _ (not a word)
V O L A _ → VOL A _ (not a word)

Try A in 5, O in 2, L in 1:
L _ O _ A
Same as above, nothing valid.

Try A in 5, O in 2, L in 3:
_ O L _ A
Same issue.

Try A in 4, O in 5, L in 1 or 2 or 3:
L _ _ A O
Possible word: L U M A O (not a word)
L I M A O (not a word)
L I D A O (not a word)
L I V A O (not a word)

_ L _ A O
Possible word: B L I A O (not a word)
C L I A O (not a word)
D L I A O (not a word)

Try A in 5, O in 2, L in 5 → conflict (A and O both at 5).

Wait, let’s list all possible positions for A, O, L without overlap:

Possible positions:
A: 4,5
O: 2,5
L: 1,2,3,5

Case 1: A=4, O=2, L=1 → L O _ A _
Need a valid word: L O B A _ (LOBA_), L O C A _ (LOC A_), etc. → nothing.

Case 2: A=4, O=2, L=3 → _ O L A _
Need a valid word: B O L A _ (BOLA_), C O L A _ (COLA_), D O L A _ (DOLA_), etc. → COLA_ is close to ""COLAD"" but not a word. ""COLAD"" is not valid.

Case 3: A=4, O=2, L=5 → _ O _ A L
Need a valid word: B O _ A L → BOBAL (not a word)
C O _ A L → COBAL (not a word)
D O _ A L → DOBAL (not a word)

Case 4: A=5, O=2, L=1 → L O _ _ A
Need a valid word: L O B _ A → LOB_A (LOBA_)
L O C _ A → LOC_A (LOCA_)
L O D _ A → LOD_A (LODA_)
L O M _ A → LOM_A (LOMA_)
L O V _ A → LOV_A (LOVA_)
None are valid.

Case 5: A=5, O=2, L=3 → _ O L _ A
Need a valid word: B O L _ A → BOLA_ (BOLAS is plural but 5 letters)
C O L _ A → COL_A (COLAS is plural)
D O L _ A → DOLA_ (DOLAS is plural)
F O L _ A → FOLA_ (FOLAS is plural)
H O L _ A → HOL_A (HOLAS is plural)
M O L _ A → MOLA_ (MOLAS is plural)
P O L _ A → POL_A (POLAS is plural)
V O L _ A → VOL_A (VOLAS is plural)

Among these, ""BOLAS"" is a valid 5-letter word (plural of bola, a type of throwing weapon). Let’s check:
- B, O, L, A, S
- S is not ruled out yet (only R, S, E, T, N, G, K, Y are ruled out; S was ruled out in Guess 1, so S is actually out. Oops.)

Wait, S was ruled out in Guess 1 (AROSE feedback: S(x)). So S is not in the word. So ""BOLAS"" is invalid because it contains S.

Next, ""COLAS"" – contains S (invalid).
""DOLAS"" – contains S (invalid).
""FOLAS"" – contains S (invalid).
""HOLAS"" – contains S (invalid).
""MOLAS"" – contains S (invalid).
""POLAS"" – contains S (invalid).
""VOLAS"" – contains S (invalid).

So none of these work. Let’s try other combinations.

Case 6: A=5, O=2, L=5 → conflict (both at 5).

Case 7: A=4, O=5, L=1 → L _ _ A O
Need a valid word: L U M A O (not a word)
L I M A O (not a word)
L I D A O (not a word)
L I V A O (not a word)

Case 8: A=4, O=5, L=2 → _ L _ A O
Need a valid word: B L _ A O → BL_AO (BLAO not a word)
C L _ A O → CL_AO (CLAO not a word)
D L _ A O → DL_AO (DLAO not a word)
F L _ A O → FL_AO (FLAO not a word)
H L _ A O → HL_AO (HLAO not a word)
M L _ A O → ML_AO (MLAO not a word)
P L _ A O → PL_AO (PLAO not a word)
V L _ A O → VL_AO (VLAO not a word)

Case 9: A=4, O=5, L=3 → _ _ L A O
Need a valid word: B _ L A O → B _ L A O (BULAO not a word)
C _ L A O → C _ L A O (CULAO not a word)
D _ L A O → D _ L A O (DULAO not a word)
F _ L A O → F _ L A O (FULAO not a word)
H _ L A O → H _ L A O (HULAO not a word)
M _ L A O → M _ L A O (MULAO not a word)
P _ L A O → P _ L A O (PULAO not a word)
V _ L A O → V _ L A O (VULAO not a word)

""PULAO"" is actually a valid word (a type of rice dish). Let’s check:
- P, U, L, A, O
- P, U, L, A, O are all allowed (not in the ruled-out list)
- Positions: P(1), U(2), L(3), A(4), O(5)
- A is in position 4 (allowed)
- O is in position 5 (allowed)
- L is in position 3 (allowed)

This seems valid.Based on the feedback, the word must contain A, O, and L, and cannot contain R, S, E, T, N, G, K, Y. The remaining letters must be chosen from B, C, D, F, H, I, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z. A valid word that fits these constraints is ""PULAO"".

3. L is somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 5 (since 3 is ruled out and 4 is A).
4. Ruled-out letters so far: R, S, E, T, N, G, K, Y, P, U.

- F is allowed.
- O is allowed (positions 1,2,3).
- C is allowed.
- A is in position 4 (correct).
- L is allowed (positions 1,2,5).

But ""FOCAL"" has A in position 4, O in position 2, L in position 5 – this fits all constraints!

Let me verify:
- F, O, C, A, L
- F: allowed
- O: allowed (position 2)
- C: allowed
