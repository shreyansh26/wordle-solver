1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One such word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word, providing useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

From the two rounds of feedback we now have:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(-) E(x)
2. SCANT → S(✓) C(x) A(✓) N(x) T(-)

What we know for sure:
- First letter is S (✓)
- Third letter is A (✓)
- T is in the word but NOT in position 4 (from SLATE) and NOT in position 5 (from SCANT). So T must be in position 2.
- Letters definitely absent: L, E, C, N.

So the pattern is now: S T A _ _

We still need two more letters for positions 4 and 5. These letters must:
- Not be any of L, E, C, N
- Not conflict with the letters already placed (S, T, A)

Possible letters left (excluding the forbidden ones): B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s think of common 5-letter words that fit S T A _ _ and use letters from the allowed set.

Examples:
- STAIR (but R is allowed)
- STAMP (M, P allowed)
- STARK (K allowed)
- STASH (H allowed)
- STAND (but N is forbidden)
- STARK (K allowed)
- STAIN (N is forbidden)
- STARK seems good: S T A R K
- STASH: S T A S H - but S is already used in position 1, can it repeat? The rules don’t forbid repeating letters, but we don’t know if S is allowed to appear again.

Between STARK and STAIR:
- STARK: K is allowed
- STAIR: R is allowed

Both are valid guesses. I’ll choose STAIR because A is already confirmed in position 3, and I is a common vowel.

Wait, let me double-check: STAIR has I in position 4 and R in position 5. Both I and R are not forbidden, and they haven’t been tested yet. This seems like a good next guess to test I and R.

But looking back, the feedback hasn’t tested I or R yet. However, we have no information that I or R are present or absent, so it’s a valid test.

However, another thought: the word could be STARK or STAIR, but we need to pick one. Between these two, I’ll go with STAIR as it tests a new vowel and a new consonant.

Wait, but STAIR is S T A I R, which uses I and R. Is this allowed? Yes, because the rules don’t restrict repeating letters unless they’re already marked as absent. Since I and R haven’t been tested, they’re allowed.

But let me think if there’s a better word. Another possibility is STAMP (S T A M P), which tests M and P. Or STASH (S T A S H), which tests S again and H.

I think STAIR is still the best choice as it tests two new letters (I and R) in positions 4 and 5.

But wait, let me re-examine the pattern: S T A _ _. The remaining letters must be from the allowed set. 

Looking at common words: STARK (S T A R K) - R and K are allowed. STAIR (S T A I R) - I and R are allowed. STAMP (S T A M P) - M and P are allowed.

All three are valid. I’ll choose STARK as it’s a common word and tests K which is a frequent consonant.

Final check: STARK
- S(✓) T(?) A(✓) R(?) K(?)
But we know T must be in position 2, so STARK fits S T A R K. This seems correct.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 (✓)
- L is not in the word at all (x)
- A is correct in position 3 (✓)
- T is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- E is not in the word (x)

So far we know:
1. Word starts with S
2. Word has A in position 3
3. Word contains T somewhere, but not in position 4
4. Word does not contain L or E

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S
- Has A in position 3
- Contains T somewhere (positions 2, 3, or 5 only - since 4 is excluded and 3 is A)
- Does not contain L or E

Possible patterns: S _ A _ T or S _ A T _ (but T can't be in position 4, so S _ A T _ is fine)

Let me think of words that fit:
- SATIN: but has I and N, but we don't know about them
- STAIN: has T in position 2, A in 3, ends with N - this seems possible
- SCANT: has T in position 5, A in 3 - possible
- SPATs: but SPAT is 4 letters, and we need 5
- SCANT: S C A N T - this has T in position 5, which is allowed

Let me choose SCANT as the next guess. It starts with S, has A in position 3, contains T in position 5, and avoids L and E.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: SCANT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(x) A(✓) N(x) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now have:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(-) E(x)
2. SCANT → S(✓) C(x) A(✓) N(x) T(-)

What we know for sure:
- First letter is S (✓)
- Third letter is A (✓)
- T is in the word but NOT in position 4 (from SLATE) and NOT in position 5 (from SCANT). So T must be in position 2.
- Letters definitely absent: L, E, C, N.

So the pattern is now: S T A _ _

We still need two more letters for positions 4 and 5. These letters must:
- Not be any of L, E, C, N
- Not conflict with the letters already placed (S, T, A)

Possible letters left (excluding the forbidden ones): B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s think of common 5-letter words that fit S T A _ _ and use letters from the allowed set.

Examples:
- STAIR (but R is allowed)
- STAMP (M, P allowed)
- STARK (K allowed)
- STASH (H allowed)
- STAND (but N is forbidden)
- STARK (K allowed)
- STAIN (N is forbidden)
- STARK seems good: S T A R K
- STASH: S T A S H - but S is already used in position 1, can it repeat? The rules don’t forbid repeating letters, but we don’t know if S is allowed to appear again.

Between STARK and STAIR:
- STARK: K is allowed
- STAIR: R is allowed

Both are valid guesses. I’ll choose STAIR because A is already confirmed in position 3, and I is a common vowel.

Wait, let me double-check: STAIR has I in position 4 and R in position 5. Both I and R are not forbidden, and they haven’t been tested yet. This seems like a good next guess to test I and R.

But looking back, the feedback hasn’t tested I or R yet. However, we have no information that I or R are present or absent, so it’s a valid test.

However, another thought: the word could be STARK or STAIR, but we need to pick one. Between these two, I’ll go with STAIR as it tests a new vowel and a new consonant.

Wait, but STAIR is S T A I R, which uses I and R. Is this allowed? Yes, because the rules don’t restrict repeating letters unless they’re already marked as absent. Since I and R haven’t been tested, they’re allowed.

But let me think if there’s a better word. Another possibility is STAMP (S T A M P), which tests M and P. Or STASH (S T A S H), which tests S again and H.

I think STAIR is still the best choice as it tests two new letters (I and R) in positions 4 and 5.

But wait, let me re-examine the pattern: S T A _ _. The remaining letters must be from the allowed set. 

Looking at common words: STARK (S T A R K) - R and K are allowed. STAIR (S T A I R) - I and R are allowed. STAMP (S T A M P) - M and P are allowed.

All three are valid. I’ll choose STARK as it’s a common word and tests K which is a frequent consonant.

Final check: STARK
- S(✓) T(?) A(✓) R(?) K(?)
But we know T must be in position 2, so STARK fits S T A R K. This seems correct.Based on the feedback so far:
- First letter is S (✓)
- Third letter is A (✓)
- T must be in position 2 (since it can't be in 4 or 5)
- Letters definitely absent: L, E, C, N

The pattern is now: S T A _ _

A common word that fits this pattern is ""STARK"" (S-T-A-R-K).

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One such word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word, providing useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

- STARK seems good: S T A R K
- STASH: S T A S H - but S is already used in position 1, can it repeat? The rules don’t forbid repeating letters, but we don’t know if S is allowed to appear again.

Between STARK and STAIR:
- STARK: K is allowed
- STAIR: R is allowed

Both are valid guesses. I’ll choose STAIR because A is already confirmed in position 3, and I is a common vowel.

Wait, let me double-check: STAIR has I in position 4 and R in position 5. Both I and R are not forbidden, and they haven’t been tested yet. This seems like a good next guess to test I and R.

But looking back, the feedback hasn’t tested I or R yet. However, we have no information that I or R are present or absent, so it’s a valid test.

However, another thought: the word could be STARK or STAIR, but we need to pick one. Between these two, I’ll go with STAIR as it tests a new vowel and a new consonant.

Wait, but STAIR is S T A I R, which uses I and R. Is this allowed? Yes, because the rules don’t restrict repeating letters unless they’re already marked as absent. Since I and R haven’t been tested, they’re allowed.

But let me think if there’s a better word. Another possibility is STAMP (S T A M P), which tests M and P. Or STASH (S T A S H), which tests S again and H.

I think STAIR is still the best choice as it tests two new letters (I and R) in positions 4 and 5.

Looking at common words: STARK (S T A R K) - R and K are allowed. STAIR (S T A I R) - I and R are allowed. STAMP (S T A M P) - M and P are allowed.

All three are valid. I’ll choose STARK as it’s a common word and tests K which is a frequent consonant.

Final check: STARK

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One such word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word, providing useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 (✓)
- L is not in the word at all (x)
- A is correct in position 3 (✓)
- T is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- E is not in the word (x)

So far we know:
1. Word starts with S
2. Word has A in position 3
3. Word contains T somewhere, but not in position 4
4. Word does not contain L or E

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S
- Has A in position 3
- Contains T somewhere (positions 2, 3, or 5 only - since 4 is excluded and 3 is A)
- Does not contain L or E

Possible patterns: S _ A _ T or S _ A T _ (but T can't be in position 4, so S _ A T _ is fine)

Let me think of words that fit:
- SATIN: but has I and N, but we don't know about them
- STAIN: has T in position 2, A in 3, ends with N - this seems possible
- SCANT: has T in position 5, A in 3 - possible
- SPATs: but SPAT is 4 letters, and we need 5
- SCANT: S C A N T - this has T in position 5, which is allowed

Let me choose SCANT as the next guess. It starts with S, has A in position 3, contains T in position 5, and avoids L and E.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: SCANT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(x) A(✓) N(x) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now have:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(-) E(x)
2. SCANT → S(✓) C(x) A(✓) N(x) T(-)

What we know for sure:
- First letter is S (✓)
- Third letter is A (✓)
- T is in the word but NOT in position 4 (from SLATE) and NOT in position 5 (from SCANT). So T must be in position 2.
- Letters definitely absent: L, E, C, N.

So the pattern is now: S T A _ _

We still need two more letters for positions 4 and 5. These letters must:
- Not be any of L, E, C, N
- Not conflict with the letters already placed (S, T, A)

Possible letters left (excluding the forbidden ones): B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s think of common 5-letter words that fit S T A _ _ and use letters from the allowed set.

Examples:
- STAIR (but R is allowed)
- STAMP (M, P allowed)
- STARK (K allowed)
- STASH (H allowed)
- STAND (but N is forbidden)
- STARK (K allowed)
- STAIN (N is forbidden)
- STARK seems good: S T A R K
- STASH: S T A S H - but S is already used in position 1, can it repeat? The rules don’t forbid repeating letters, but we don’t know if S is allowed to appear again.

Between STARK and STAIR:
- STARK: K is allowed
- STAIR: R is allowed

Both are valid guesses. I’ll choose STAIR because A is already confirmed in position 3, and I is a common vowel.

Wait, let me double-check: STAIR has I in position 4 and R in position 5. Both I and R are not forbidden, and they haven’t been tested yet. This seems like a good next guess to test I and R.

But looking back, the feedback hasn’t tested I or R yet. However, we have no information that I or R are present or absent, so it’s a valid test.

However, another thought: the word could be STARK or STAIR, but we need to pick one. Between these two, I’ll go with STAIR as it tests a new vowel and a new consonant.

Wait, but STAIR is S T A I R, which uses I and R. Is this allowed? Yes, because the rules don’t restrict repeating letters unless they’re already marked as absent. Since I and R haven’t been tested, they’re allowed.

But let me think if there’s a better word. Another possibility is STAMP (S T A M P), which tests M and P. Or STASH (S T A S H), which tests S again and H.

I think STAIR is still the best choice as it tests two new letters (I and R) in positions 4 and 5.

But wait, let me re-examine the pattern: S T A _ _. The remaining letters must be from the allowed set. 

Looking at common words: STARK (S T A R K) - R and K are allowed. STAIR (S T A I R) - I and R are allowed. STAMP (S T A M P) - M and P are allowed.

All three are valid. I’ll choose STARK as it’s a common word and tests K which is a frequent consonant.

Final check: STARK
- S(✓) T(?) A(✓) R(?) K(?)
But we know T must be in position 2, so STARK fits S T A R K. This seems correct.Based on the feedback so far:
- First letter is S (✓)
- Third letter is A (✓)
- T must be in position 2 (since it can't be in 4 or 5)
- Letters definitely absent: L, E, C, N

The pattern is now: S T A _ _

A common word that fits this pattern is ""STARK"" (S-T-A-R-K).

We’re looking for common 5-letter words of the form “STA??”.

Some possibilities:
- STAIM – not a valid word
- STABD – invalid
- STAGS – uses S twice, but S is already in position 1; “STAGS” is valid
- STAMP – uses M, P
- STAND – N is forbidden
- STARS – R is forbidden
- STASH – H is allowed
- STAYS – Y, S – but S is already used
- STOIC – C is forbidden
- STONE – N, E are forbidden
- STOOP – O, P
- STOAM – not a word
- STAMP, STASH, STOIC (invalid), STOOP, STAGS are the most promising.

Among these, “STAMP” uses two new letters (M, P) that haven’t been eliminated. “STASH” also uses two new letters (S again, H). “STAGS” uses G, S (but S is already in position 1).

The rules don’t forbid repeating letters unless they’ve been marked absent, and S is already in position 1. So “STAMP” seems like the safest next guess to test M and P.

Looking at common 5-letter words beginning with “STA”:

- STA**B** – STA**B** is 4 letters.  
- STA**ID** – not a word.  
- STA**IG** – not a word.  
- STA**IN** – N is forbidden.  
- STA**KE** – E forbidden.  
- STA**LO** – L forbidden.  
- STA**NG** – not a word.  
- STA**ND** – N forbidden.  
- STA**ON** – N forbidden.  
- STA**OP** – P forbidden.  
- STA**RG** – not a word.  
- STA**RT** – R forbidden.  
- STA**WK** – not a word.  
- STA**X** – needs another letter.

A quick scan finds only a handful of valid “STA??” words that avoid all the banned letters:

1. STA**G** – too short.  
2. STA**ID** – invalid.  
3. STA**IG** – invalid.  
4. STA**IN** – N banned.  
5. STA**KE** – E banned.  
6. STA**NG** – invalid.  
7. STA**ND** – N banned.  
8. STA**ON** – N banned.  
9. STA**OP** – P banned.  
10. STA**RT** – R banned.  
11. STA**WK** – invalid.  
12. STA**X** – needs another letter.

The only real candidate left that is a valid English word and uses only allowed letters is:

- STA**ID** – invalid.  
- STA**IG** – invalid.  
- STA**IN** – invalid.  
- STA**KE** – invalid.  
- STA**NG** – invalid.  
- STA**ND** – invalid.  
- STA**ON** – invalid.  
- STA**OP** – invalid.  
- STA**RT** – invalid.  
- STA**WK** – invalid.

Wait, let me double-check a dictionary list of “STA” words:

Valid 5-letter “STA” words (only):
- STAIN – N banned.  
- STARK – R, K banned.  
- STAND – N, D – N banned.  
- STARS – R, S banned.  
- STASH – H, S – S already used, H allowed.  
- STAYS – Y, S – S already used.  
- STATE – E, T – E banned.  
- START – R, T – R banned.  
- STAYS – Y allowed, S already used.  
- STONE – N, E – both banned.  
- STOLE – L, E – both banned.  
- STAMP – M, P – both banned.  
- STAGS – G, S – S already used.  
- STAGY – Y allowed, but not a common word.  

The only remaining valid word that uses only allowed letters is **STASH** (S T A S H), even though it reuses S in position 4. The rules do not forbid a letter already seen in the word from appearing again, so this is a legal guess.

(Another possible word is **STAGY**, but it’s uncommon and less likely.)

Therefore, the best next guess is **STASH**.

The rules don’t forbid repeating letters, but we don’t know if S is allowed to appear again.\n\nBetween STARK and STAIR:\n- STARK: K is allowed\n- STAIR: R is allowed\n\nBoth are valid guesses. I’ll choose STAIR because A is already confirmed in position 3, and I is a common vowel.\n\nWait, let me double-check: STAIR has I in position 4 and R in position 5. Both I and R are not forbidden, and they haven’t been tested yet. This seems like a good next guess to test I and R.\n\nBut looking back, the feedback hasn’t tested I or R yet. However, we have no information that I or R are present or absent, so it’s a valid test.\n\nHowever, another thought: the word could be STARK or STAIR, but we need to pick one. Between these two, I’ll go with STAIR as it tests a new vowel and a new consonant.\n\nWait, but STAIR is S T A I R, which uses I and R. Is this allowed? Yes, because the rules don’t restrict repeating letters unless they’re already marked as absent. Since I and R haven’t been tested, they’re allowed.\n\nBut let me think if there’s a better word. Another possibility is STAMP (S T A M P), which tests M and P. Or STASH (S T A S H), which tests S again and H.\n\nI think STAIR is still the best choice as it tests two new letters (I and R) in positions 4 and 5.\n\nBut wait, let me re-examine the pattern: S T A _ _. The remaining letters must be from the allowed set. \n\nLooking at common words: STARK (S T A R K) - R and K are allowed. STAIR (S T A I R) - I and R are allowed. STAMP (S T A M P) - M and P are allowed.\n\nAll three are valid. I’ll choose STARK as it’s a common word and tests K which is a frequent consonant.\n\nFinal check: STARK\n- S(✓) T(?) A(✓) R(?)
