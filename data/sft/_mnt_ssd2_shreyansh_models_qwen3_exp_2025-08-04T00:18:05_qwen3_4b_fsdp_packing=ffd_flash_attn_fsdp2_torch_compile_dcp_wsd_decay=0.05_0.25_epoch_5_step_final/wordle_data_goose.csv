### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll pick a word that uses some of these high-frequency letters in different positions to help narrow down possibilities quickly. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters and tests vowels in multiple positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- O is correct and in the right spot (position 3).
- S is correct and in the right spot (position 4).
- E is correct and in the right spot (position 5).
- A and R are not in the word at all.

So the secret word has the pattern: _ _ O S E, and it definitely does NOT contain A or R.

Next, I want to test new common consonants and vowels in the first two positions. Good candidates are T, N, L, C, D, H, M, etc. I'll try ""POSE"" but wait - that has an O in position 2 which we know is already fixed to position 3. So that's invalid. Instead, I'll try ""MOSE"" but M isn't as common. Better to try ""NOSE"" but N is good. However, ""NOSE"" is 4 letters. I need 5 letters ending in OSE. 

Looking at common 5-letter words ending in OSE: 
- DOUSE
- GOOSE
- HOUSE
- LOUSE
- MOUSE
- NOUSE
- ROUSE (but R is excluded)
- TOUSE

""DOUSE"" uses D, U, O, S, E - but U isn't tested yet. However, we know O is in position 3, S in 4, E in 5. So D _ O S E. That fits. 

""GOOSE"" has G, O, O, S, E - but O is already confirmed in position 3, so this would have two O's which might not be efficient.

""HOUSE"" has H, O, U, S, E - but U is in position 3 which is already O. So invalid.

""MOUSE"" has M, O, U, S, E - but U in position 3 is invalid.

""NOUSE"" has N, O, U, S, E - same issue with U in position 3.

""TOUSE"" has T, O, U, S, E - same issue.

""Douse"" seems best as it tests D in position 1 and keeps the pattern D _ O S E. 

But actually, ""douse"" is valid. So I'll go with ""DOUSE"".

- C L O S E seems best as it tests C and L.

Let’s try “CLOSE”.

Current known facts:
- Pattern is _ _ O S E (positions 3-5 fixed as O-S-E)
- Letters definitely absent: A, R, D, U, C, L

Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 2 (excluding the absent ones):
Vowels left: I (since A, U, O are out and E is already in position 5)
Consonants left: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form ? ? O S E.

Possible combinations:
- B I O S E → “biose” – not a common word
- F I O S E → “fiose” – not a word
- G I O S E → “giose” – not standard
- H I O S E → “hiose” – not a word
- M I O S E → “miose” – not standard
- N I O S E → “niose” – not a word
- G O O S E → “goose” – valid, but repeats O which is already confirmed
- H O I S E – invalid, I conflicts with O in position 3
- M O S E – too short
- P I O S E – not a word
- V I O S E – not a word
- W I O S E – not a word
- Y I O S E – not a word

Looking at the pattern _ _ O S E and the constraints, the only common English word left seems to be “GOOSE,” even though it repeats the O in position 3. This is acceptable because the feedback already confirmed O is in position 3, so repeating it is just verification. 

Another candidate is “NOOSE,” but N is still possible and it’s a valid word. Let’s check:
- N is not yet excluded
- O is confirmed
- O is confirmed
- S is confirmed
- E is confirmed

“NOOSE” fits perfectly and tests N in position 1 and O in position 2 (though position 2’s O is actually part of the confirmed pattern). 

But wait, the pattern is _ _ O S E, so position 2 is the second letter, and we have O in position 3. So “NOOSE” would be N(1) O(2) O(3) S(4) E(5), which fits the pattern. 

However, we know O is in position 3 and it’s confirmed, so repeating O in position 2 is allowed. 

Between “GOOSE” and “NOOSE,” both are valid, but “GOOSE” is more common. Let’s go with “GOOSE” first.

But let’s verify:
- G is not yet excluded
- O is confirmed in position 3
- O is confirmed in position 2 (allowed)
- S is confirmed
- E is confirmed

Yes, “GOOSE” fits all constraints.

Alternatively, “MOOSE” is another candidate, but M is still possible and it’s a valid word. 

Between “GOOSE” and “MOOSE,” both are valid, but “GOOSE” is more common. 

Let’s proceed with “GOOSE.”
