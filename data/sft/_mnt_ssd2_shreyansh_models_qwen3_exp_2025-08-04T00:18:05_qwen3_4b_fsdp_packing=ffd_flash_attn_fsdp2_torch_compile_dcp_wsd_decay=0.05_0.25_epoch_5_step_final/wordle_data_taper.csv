### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. I'll pick a word that uses some of these high-frequency letters in different positions to help narrow down possibilities quickly. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters and tests vowels in multiple positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) : A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-) : R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(x) : O is NOT in the word
- S(x) : S is NOT in the word
- E(-) : E is in the word but not in position 5

So we know:
- Letters present: A, R, E (somewhere not in their original spots)
- Letters absent: O, S

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, R, E
2. Does NOT contain O or S
3. Has A not in position 1, R not in position 2, E not in position 5

Let me think of words that fit. ""REACT"" comes to mind:
- R is in position 1 (allowed, since feedback only said R is not in position 2)
- E is in position 2 (allowed, since feedback only said E is not in position 5)
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since feedback only said A is not in position 1)
- C and T are new letters we haven't tested yet
- No O or S

This seems like a good next guess to gather more information.

Let's consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (arose):
- A is in the word, but not in position 1.
- R is in the word, but not in position 2.
- O is NOT in the word.
- S is NOT in the word.
- E is in the word, but not in position 5.

From Guess 2 (react):
- R is in the word, but not in position 1.
- E is in the word, but not in position 2.
- A is in the word, but not in position 3.
- C is NOT in the word.
- T is in the word, but not in position 5.

So far:
- Letters that MUST appear somewhere: A, R, E, T
- Letters that are definitely absent: O, S, C
- Forbidden positions:
  – A cannot be in 1 or 3
  – R cannot be in 1 or 2
  – E cannot be in 2 or 5
  – T cannot be in 5

We need a 5-letter word that uses exactly the letters A, R, E, T plus one more letter (which must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding O, S, C). The additional letter could be any of D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s look for a word that places A, R, E, T in allowable positions and introduces a new, common letter. A good candidate is “TRAVE”:
- T is in position 1 (allowed)
- R is in position 2 (but feedback said R is not in position 2 from Guess 1) → conflict, cannot use this.

Next candidate: “TREAD”
- T in 1 (allowed)
- R in 2 (disallowed) → conflict.

Next: “RETIA” (but not a valid English word).

Next: “TAPER”
- T in 1 (allowed)
- A in 2 (allowed)
- P is new
- E in 3 (allowed)
- R in 5 (allowed)

“TAPER” is a valid English word and satisfies all constraints:
- Contains A, R, E, T plus P
- No O, S, C
- Positions:
  – A (pos 2) not forbidden
  – R (pos 5) not forbidden
  – E (pos 3) not forbidden
  – T (pos 1) not forbidden
  – P is new

So I will guess TAPER.
