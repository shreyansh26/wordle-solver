### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give us good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their positions.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" as it has S, L, T (common consonants) and A, E (common vowels).

3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

- Need to test new consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, V, W, Y, etc.

Good candidates:
- Must have O and R in positions not yet ruled out.
- Let’s try a word that places O in position 1 or 2 and R in 1, 3, or 4, while introducing new letters.

Consider ""CRONE"":
- C (new), R (position 2, allowed), O (position 3, not allowed - was ruled out)
  - O cannot be in position 3, so this is invalid.

Consider ""DROVE"":
- D (new), R (position 2, allowed), O (position 3, not allowed)
  - Again O in position 3 is invalid.

Consider ""GROVE"":
- G (new), R (position 2), O (position 3) - invalid.

Consider ""FROZE"":
- F (new), R (position 2), O (position 3) - invalid.

Consider ""MORFE"":
- M (new), O (position 2), R (position 3), F (new), E (fixed)
  - R in position 3 is allowed (was not in position 2)
  - O in position 2 is allowed (was not in position 3)
  - Introduces M and F to test.

This seems valid.

Another candidate: ""HORDE"":
- H (new), O (position 2), R (position 3), D (new), E (fixed)
  - Also valid, introduces H and D.

Between MORFE and HORDE, both are valid. I'll choose MORFE to test M and F.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give us good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their positions.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" as it has S, L, T (common consonants) and A, E (common vowels). 

Between these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better letter coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but wrong position (-)
- O is in the word but wrong position (-)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓)

So far we know:
- The word ends with E
- It contains R and O, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively
- It does not contain A or S

Good letters to try next: T, I, N, L, C, D, U, M, P, etc.
I want a word that:
1. Ends with E
2. Contains R and O in new positions
3. Uses new letters to test

Possible candidates:
- ""TROPE"" - uses T, R, O, P, E. R is now in position 2 (was 3), O in position 3 (was 2). Tests T and P.
- ""CRONE"" - uses C, R, O, N, E. R in position 2, O in 3. Tests C and N.
- ""DROVE"" - uses D, R, O, V, E. R in 2, O in 3. Tests D and V.

""TROPE"" seems good as it tests a new common letter (T) and P.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - R and O are both in the word but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
   - A and S are absent.

2. TROPE → T(x) R(-) O(-) P(x) E(✓)
   - Confirms E in position 5 again.
   - R is still in the word but not in position 2 (same as before) so it must be in positions 1, 3, or 4.
   - O is still in the word but not in position 3 (same as before) so it must be in positions 1, 2, or 4.
   - T and P are now known to be absent.

So far:
- Word ends with E
- Contains R and O
- R not in pos 2, O not in pos 3
- Letters known to be absent: A, S, T, P
- Need to test new consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, V, W, Y, etc.

Good candidates:
- Must have O and R in positions not yet ruled out.
- Let’s try a word that places O in position 1 or 2 and R in 1, 3, or 4, while introducing new letters.

Consider ""CRONE"":
- C (new), R (position 2, allowed), O (position 3, not allowed - was ruled out)
  - O cannot be in position 3, so this is invalid.

Consider ""DROVE"":
- D (new), R (position 2, allowed), O (position 3, not allowed)
  - Again O in position 3 is invalid.

Consider ""GROVE"":
- G (new), R (position 2), O (position 3) - invalid.

Consider ""FROZE"":
- F (new), R (position 2), O (position 3) - invalid.

Consider ""MORFE"":
- M (new), O (position 2), R (position 3), F (new), E (fixed)
  - R in position 3 is allowed (was not in position 2)
  - O in position 2 is allowed (was not in position 3)
  - Introduces M and F to test.

This seems valid.

Another candidate: ""HORDE"":
- H (new), O (position 2), R (position 3), D (new), E (fixed)
  - Also valid, introduces H and D.

From the four rounds:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed at position 5.
   - R and O are in the word but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
   - A and S are out.

2. TROPE → T(x) R(-) O(-) P(x) E(✓)
   - R is not in position 2 (so 1, 3, or 4).
   - O is not in position 3 (so 1, 2, or 4).
   - T and P are out.

3. MORFE → M(x) O(✓) R(-) F(x) E(✓)
   - O is confirmed in position 2.
   - R is not in position 3 (so R must be in 1 or 4).
   - M and F are out.

4. LOIRE → L(x) O(✓) I(x) R(-) E(✓)
   - O is confirmed in position 2.
   - R is not in position 4 (so R must be in position 1).
   - L and I are out.

Current constraints:
- Word ends with E (position 5).
- O is in position 2.
- R is in position 1.
- Letters ruled out: A, S, T, P, M, F, L, I.

So the pattern is:
R O _ _ E

We need to fill positions 3 and 4 with letters not yet ruled out. Available letters: B, C, D, G, H, K, N, V, W, Y.

Looking for valid 5-letter words matching R O _ _ E:
- ROB_E: ROBNE, ROBGE, etc. - ROBNE is not valid.
- ROD_E: RODGE, RODNE - RODGE is valid.
- RON_E: RONDE, RONZE - RONDE is valid.
- ROU_E: ROUGE is valid.
- ROV_E: ROVNE, etc. - none common.
- ROK_E: ROKNE - not valid.

Possible valid words: RODGE, RONDE, ROUGE.

ROUGE is the most common word among these, so let's try it.
