### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(✓) → R is in the word and in position 2.

So far we know:
- The word has the form _ R _ _ _
- Letters not in the word: A, O, S, E
- We still need to test other common letters in the remaining positions.

Good next candidates would use other high-frequency letters (T, N, L, C, I, etc.) while keeping R in position 2. ""TRUNK"" is a strong choice because:
- It keeps R in position 2.
- It introduces T, U, N, K (all common letters not yet tested).
- It avoids A, O, S, E which we know are not in the word.

However, ""TRUNK"" might be too obscure. A better, more common word is ""BRING"":
- Keeps R in position 2.
- Introduces B, I, N, G (all common letters not yet tested).
- Avoids A, O, S, E.

From the two previous guesses we know:

1. The word has the form _ R _ _ _
2. Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S, E, B, I, N, K

That leaves us with a lot of unused common letters: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has R in position 2
- Uses only letters from the remaining set
- Is a valid English word

Good candidates for position 1: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, T, V, W, Y
Good candidates for positions 3, 4, 5: same set, but we want to test common combinations.

Let’s try a word that uses common remaining letters and tests a few new ones at once. ""CRUMP"" is possible but uncommon. ""DRIFT"" uses D, R, I, F, T – but I is already ruled out. ""FRUMP"" is obscure. ""GRUMP"" is possible but not very common.

A better, more common word is ""TRUMP"":
- T, R, U, M, P
- R is in position 2
- Uses new letters T, U, M, P
- All letters are from the remaining pool (none of A, O, S, E, B, I, N, K)

This seems like the strongest next guess.

The word has the form _ R _ _ _\n2. Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S, E, B, I, N, K\n\nThat leaves us with a lot of unused common letters: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nWe need a 5-letter word that:\n- Has R in position 2\n- Uses only letters from the remaining set\n- Is a valid English word\n\nGood candidates for position 1: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, T, V, W, Y\nGood candidates for positions 3, 4, 5: same set, but we want to test common combinations.\n\nLet’s try a word that uses common remaining letters and tests a few new ones at once.

""GRUMP"" is possible but not very common.\n\nA better, more common word is ""TRUMP"":\n- T, R, U, M, P\n- R is in position 2\n- Uses new letters T, U, M, P\n- All letters are from the remaining pool (none of A, O, S, E, B, I, N, K)\n\nThis seems like the strongest next guess.\n\n<guess>trump</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: brink -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) I(x) N(x) K(x)\nGuess 3: trump -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) U(✓) M(x) P(x)\n'}]","<think>
From the three guesses we now know:

1. The word has the form _ R U _ _
2. Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S, E, B, I, N, K, T, M, P
3. Letters that ARE in the word and in their correct positions: R (position 2) and U (position 3)

Remaining common letters to test: C, D, F, G, H, L, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has R in position 2
- Has U in position 3
- Uses only letters from the remaining set (none of the excluded letters)
- Is a valid English word

Possible patterns: C, D, F, G, H, L, V, W, Y for positions 1, 4, 5.

Good candidates:
- C: Could start with C (CRU__), but we need to fill positions 1,4,5. ""CRUMB"" is invalid (M,B excluded). ""CURVY"" is possible but not common.
- D: ""DRULD"" – invalid. ""DRUVY"" – invalid.
- F: ""FRULD"" – invalid.
- G: ""GRU__"" – ""GRUFF"" has two F's, but F is allowed. ""GRUFF"" is valid and uses F twice.
- H: ""HRULD"" – invalid.
- L: ""LRULD"" – invalid.
- V: ""VRULD"" – invalid.
- W: ""WRULD"" – invalid.
- Y: ""YRULD"" – invalid.

The only valid word I can think of that fits is ""GRUFF"" – it uses G, R, U, F, F. All letters are from the remaining pool (G, F are allowed; U, R are confirmed). It's a valid English word meaning to mock or tease.

Let's go with ""GRUFF"".
