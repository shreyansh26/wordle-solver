### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives me good coverage of frequent letters and can quickly narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 (✓)
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all (x)

So the word starts with S and contains none of L, A, T, E.  
I now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with S
2. Does not contain L, A, T, E
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to maximize information gain

Good remaining vowels: I, O, U  
Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, H, D, P, M, etc.

A strong next guess is ""SHORN"":
- Starts with S
- Uses H, O, R, N (none of which are forbidden)
- Tests the vowel O and common consonants H, R, N
