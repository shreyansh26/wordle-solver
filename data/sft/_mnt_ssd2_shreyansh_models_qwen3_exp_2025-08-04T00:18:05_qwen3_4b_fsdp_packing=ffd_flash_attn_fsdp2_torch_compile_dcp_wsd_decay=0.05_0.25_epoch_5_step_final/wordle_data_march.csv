### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters.

Some good first guesses include:
- AROSE (contains A, R, O, S, E - 5 most common letters)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 of the top 5 most common letters and gives good coverage for vowels and common consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(x): O is not in the word
- S(x): S is not in the word
- E(x): E is not in the word

So we know:
- The word contains A and R, but they are not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain O, S, or E.

Since A is in the word but not in position 1, it must be in positions 2-5.
Since R is in the word but not in position 2, it must be in positions 1,3-5.

Also, we have no information about other letters yet.

I want a new guess that:
1. Keeps A and R in new positions (to test their correct spots)
2. Introduces new common letters (T, L, N, I, C, etc.) to replace the eliminated O, S, E
3. Uses valid 5-letter words

Possible candidates:
- TRAIN: T,R,A,I,N - tests R in position 2 (but feedback says R is not in position 2), so this is bad
- RATIO: R,A,T,I,O - contains O which we know is invalid
- CRANK: C,R,A,N,K - tests R in position 2 (invalid), so bad
- TRAIL: T,R,A,I,L - R in position 2 is invalid
- GRAIN: G,R,A,I,N - R in position 2 is invalid
- RANCH: R,A,N,C,H - R in position 1 is valid (since we only know R is not in position 2), A in position 2 is valid (since we know A is not in position 1), introduces N,C,H
- RANCH seems good

Another option is RAVIN: R,A,V,I,N - but V is less common
Another is RAPID: R,A,P,I,D - but P is less common
RANCH seems best as it's common and tests new letters.

But let's check: RANCH has R in position 1 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed), and introduces N,C,H which are new.

So I'll go with RANCH.
