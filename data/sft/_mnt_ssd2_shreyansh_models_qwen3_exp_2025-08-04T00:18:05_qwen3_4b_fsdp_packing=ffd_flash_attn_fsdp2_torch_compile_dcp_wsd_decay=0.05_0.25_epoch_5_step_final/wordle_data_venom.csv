For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 vowels and common consonants. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it includes S, L, A, T, E - covering several very common letters in different positions. It gives us good coverage of vowels and common consonants to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
Since the E was in position 5, the actual E must be in positions 1-4.

Because S, L, A, T are ruled out, we need a word that:
1. Contains E (but not in position 5).
2. Uses only letters that have not been eliminated.
3. Introduces new common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Remaining common letters include R, O, N, I, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, K, etc.

A good second guess should incorporate several of these.  
Some candidates:
- ROUND (R, O, U, N, D) – but no E.
- CRONE (C, R, O, N, E) – has E in position 4 (allowed), plus C, R, O, N.

From the two rounds of feedback we know:

Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, R  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions we still don’t know: E, O, N  

The word must therefore be composed only of the remaining letters: {B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z} plus the known letters E, O, N.

We have three confirmed letters (E, O, N) and need two more letters from the allowed set.  
We also know:
- E cannot be in position 5 (from SLATE feedback).
- O was in position 3 in CRONE, so O is not in position 3.
- N was in position 4 in CRONE, so N is not in position 4.

A good next guess would place these three known letters in new positions while introducing two new, common letters to narrow things down further.  
Among the most common unused letters now are I, U, D, H, K, M, P.

Candidate words:
- UNITE – uses U, N, I, T, E. But T is already ruled out.
- HOPE – only 4 letters.
- DUNNE – uses D, U, N, N, E. All letters are allowed so far, and it tests D, U, N, E in new positions.
- OPINE – uses O, P, I, N, E. P, I are new and allowed; O, N, E are confirmed letters in different positions.

OPINE seems like the best choice because it:
1. Uses all three confirmed letters (O, P, I, N, E).
2. Places O in position 1 (not 3), P in position 2, I in position 3, N in position 4 (but we know N is not in 4 from CRONE feedback), so this might be risky for N.

Wait, let me reconsider placement to avoid the known bad positions:
- E cannot be 5th.
- O cannot be 3rd.
- N cannot be 4th.

A better word is ""UNITE"" but T is out.  
""POISE"" – but S is out.  
""DOING"" – uses D, O, I, N, G. All letters are allowed so far, and positions are fresh for O, N, E (E is 4th here, which is allowed), plus new letters D and G.

DOING looks good.

But let me pick one that maximizes new info while respecting constraints.  
""POISE"" is invalid (S out).  
""KNOBE"" – not a valid word.  
""OPINE"" has N in 4th, which is invalid.  
""UNION"" – but N is in 4th again.

A valid word that tests new letters and keeps the known letters in fresh spots is ""DUNNO"" but double N might not help.

Best seems ""DOING"" – uses D, O, I, N, G. All letters allowed, positions for O, N, E are new, and D, G are fresh.

But actually, ""DOING"" has I in 3rd, O in 2nd, N in 4th – but N cannot be 4th, so this is invalid.

Let me try ""HOIST"" – but S and T are out.

""PIONE"" – but not a valid word.

""NOISE"" – uses N, O, I, S, E. S is out.

""VOICE"" – C is out.

""MOUSE"" – S is out, but M, O, U, S, E – S is invalid.

""MOHEN"" – not a word.

""POULE"" – not a word.

""QUINE"" – Q, U, I, N, E. Q and U are new, positions are fresh for O, N, E.

QUINE seems valid and respects all constraints.

But let me pick a more common word.  
""UNION"" – N is 4th, invalid.

""INBOX"" – X is allowed, but B is allowed, I, N, B, O, X. But this has I, N, O, B, X – positions are fresh.

Actually, ""INBOX"" is valid.

But let me choose ""INBOX"" as it uses I, N, B, O, X – all allowed letters, and positions are fresh for the known letters.

But the confirmed letters are E, O, N. So we must include E, O, N in the guess.

So the word must contain E, O, N, and two other allowed letters.

Possible words:
- ""ONION"" – has O, N, I, O, N – but double letters may not help.
- ""ENOKI"" – not a word.
- ""NEON"" – too short.
- ""OCEAN"" – C is out.
- ""BONEY"" – B, O, N, E, Y. All letters allowed, positions: O is 2nd (not 3rd), N is 3rd (not 4th), E is 4th (not 5th). This seems valid.

BONEY is a valid word and fits all constraints.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 vowels and common consonants. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it includes S, L, A, T, E - covering several very common letters in different positions. It gives us good coverage of vowels and common consonants to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
Since the E was in position 5, the actual E must be in positions 1-4.

Because S, L, A, T are ruled out, we need a word that:
1. Contains E (but not in position 5).
2. Uses only letters that have not been eliminated.
3. Introduces new common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Remaining common letters include R, O, N, I, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, K, etc.

A good second guess should incorporate several of these.  
Some candidates:
- ROUND (R, O, U, N, D) – but no E.
- CRONE (C, R, O, N, E) – has E in position 4 (allowed), plus C, R, O, N.
- PRONE (P, R, O, N, E) – similar to CRONE but with P.
- CHIME (C, H, I, M, E) – has E in position 4, plus C, H, I, M.

CRONE seems optimal because it adds C, R, O, N while placing E in a new spot (position 4).

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we know:

Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, R  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions we still don’t know: E, O, N  

The word must therefore be composed only of the remaining letters: {B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z} plus the known letters E, O, N.

We have three confirmed letters (E, O, N) and need two more letters from the allowed set.  
We also know:
- E cannot be in position 5 (from SLATE feedback).
- O was in position 3 in CRONE, so O is not in position 3.
- N was in position 4 in CRONE, so N is not in position 4.

A good next guess would place these three known letters in new positions while introducing two new, common letters to narrow things down further.  
Among the most common unused letters now are I, U, D, H, K, M, P.

Candidate words:
- UNITE – uses U, N, I, T, E. But T is already ruled out.
- HOPE – only 4 letters.
- DUNNE – uses D, U, N, N, E. All letters are allowed so far, and it tests D, U, N, E in new positions.
- OPINE – uses O, P, I, N, E. P, I are new and allowed; O, N, E are confirmed letters in different positions.

OPINE seems like the best choice because it:
1. Uses all three confirmed letters (O, P, I, N, E).
2. Places O in position 1 (not 3), P in position 2, I in position 3, N in position 4 (but we know N is not in 4 from CRONE feedback), so this might be risky for N.

Wait, let me reconsider placement to avoid the known bad positions:
- E cannot be 5th.
- O cannot be 3rd.
- N cannot be 4th.

A better word is ""UNITE"" but T is out.  
""POISE"" – but S is out.  
""DOING"" – uses D, O, I, N, G. All letters are allowed so far, and positions are fresh for O, N, E (E is 4th here, which is allowed), plus new letters D and G.

DOING looks good.

But let me pick one that maximizes new info while respecting constraints.  
""POISE"" is invalid (S out).  
""KNOBE"" – not a valid word.  
""OPINE"" has N in 4th, which is invalid.  
""UNION"" – but N is in 4th again.

A valid word that tests new letters and keeps the known letters in fresh spots is ""DUNNO"" but double N might not help.

Best seems ""DOING"" – uses D, O, I, N, G. All letters allowed, positions for O, N, E are new, and D, G are fresh.

But actually, ""DOING"" has I in 3rd, O in 2nd, N in 4th – but N cannot be 4th, so this is invalid.

Let me try ""HOIST"" – but S and T are out.

""PIONE"" – but not a valid word.

""NOISE"" – uses N, O, I, S, E. S is out.

""VOICE"" – C is out.

""MOUSE"" – S is out, but M, O, U, S, E – S is invalid.

""MOHEN"" – not a word.

""POULE"" – not a word.

""QUINE"" – Q, U, I, N, E. Q and U are new, positions are fresh for O, N, E.

QUINE seems valid and respects all constraints.

But let me pick a more common word.  
""UNION"" – N is 4th, invalid.

""INBOX"" – X is allowed, but B is allowed, I, N, B, O, X. But this has I, N, O, B, X – positions are fresh.

Actually, ""INBOX"" is valid.

But let me choose ""INBOX"" as it uses I, N, B, O, X – all allowed letters, and positions are fresh for the known letters.

But the confirmed letters are E, O, N. So we must include E, O, N in the guess.

So the word must contain E, O, N, and two other allowed letters.

Possible words:
- ""ONION"" – has O, N, I, O, N – but double letters may not help.
- ""ENOKI"" – not a word.
- ""NEON"" – too short.
- ""OCEAN"" – C is out.
- ""BONEY"" – B, O, N, E, Y. All letters allowed, positions: O is 2nd (not 3rd), N is 3rd (not 4th), E is 4th (not 5th). This seems valid.

BONEY is a valid word and fits all constraints.

But let me pick ""BONEY"" as the next guess.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 vowels and common consonants. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it includes S, L, A, T, E - covering several very common letters in different positions. It gives us good coverage of vowels and common consonants to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
Since the E was in position 5, the actual E must be in positions 1-4.

Because S, L, A, T are ruled out, we need a word that:
1. Contains E (but not in position 5).
2. Uses only letters that have not been eliminated.
3. Introduces new common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Remaining common letters include R, O, N, I, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, K, etc.

A good second guess should incorporate several of these.  
Some candidates:
- ROUND (R, O, U, N, D) – but no E.
- CRONE (C, R, O, N, E) – has E in position 4 (allowed), plus C, R, O, N.
- PRONE (P, R, O, N, E) – similar to CRONE but with P.
- CHIME (C, H, I, M, E) – has E in position 4, plus C, H, I, M.

CRONE seems optimal because it adds C, R, O, N while placing E in a new spot (position 4).

- E cannot be 5th.
- O cannot be 3rd.
- N cannot be 4th.

A better word is ""UNITE"" but T is out.  
""POISE"" – but S is out.  
""DOING"" – uses D, O, I, N, G. All letters are allowed so far, and positions are fresh for O, N, E (E is 4th here, which is allowed), plus new letters D and G.

DOING looks good.

But let me pick one that maximizes new info while respecting constraints.  
""POISE"" is invalid (S out).  
""KNOBE"" – not a valid word.  
""OPINE"" has N in 4th, which is invalid.  
""UNION"" – but N is in 4th again.

A valid word that tests new letters and keeps the known letters in fresh spots is ""DUNNO"" but double N might not help.

Best seems ""DOING"" – uses D, O, I, N, G. All letters allowed, positions for O, N, E are new, and D, G are fresh.

But actually, ""DOING"" has I in 3rd, O in 2nd, N in 4th – but N cannot be 4th, so this is invalid.

Let me try ""HOIST"" – but S and T are out.

""PIONE"" – but not a valid word.

""NOISE"" – uses N, O, I, S, E. S is out.

""VOICE"" – C is out.

""MOUSE"" – S is out, but M, O, U, S, E – S is invalid.

""MOHEN"" – not a word.

""POULE"" – not a word.

""QUINE"" – Q, U, I, N, E. Q and U are new, positions are fresh for O, N, E.

QUINE seems valid and respects all constraints.

But let me pick a more common word.  
""UNION"" – N is 4th, invalid.

""INBOX"" – X is allowed, but B is allowed, I, N, B, O, X. But this has I, N, O, B, X – positions are fresh.

Actually, ""INBOX"" is valid.

But let me choose ""INBOX"" as it uses I, N, B, O, X – all allowed letters, and positions are fresh for the known letters.

But the confirmed letters are E, O, N. So we must include E, O, N in the guess.

So the word must contain E, O, N, and two other allowed letters.

Possible words:
- ""ONION"" – has O, N, I, O, N – but double letters may not help.
- ""ENOKI"" – not a word.
- ""NEON"" – too short.
- ""OCEAN"" – C is out.
- ""BONEY"" – B, O, N, E, Y. All letters allowed, positions: O is 2nd (not 3rd), N is 3rd (not 4th), E is 4th (not 5th). This seems valid.

BONEY is a valid word and fits all constraints.

But let me pick ""BONEY"" as the next guess.

From the three rounds we now know:

Letters definitely NOT in the word:  
S, L, A, T, C, R, B, Y  

Letters that ARE in the word:
- N is in position 3 (✓)
- O is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 (from CRONE and BONEY feedback)
- E is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5 (from SLATE and BONEY feedback)

So the word looks like: _ _ N _ _ with the remaining letters drawn from {D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z} plus the confirmed O and E.

Positions for O and E:
- O cannot be 2nd or 3rd → must be 1st, 4th, or 5th
- E cannot be 4th or 5th → must be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd (but 3rd is N), so E must be 1st or 2nd

Let’s list possible patterns:

1. E _ N _ _  (E in 1st)
   - O must go in 4th or 5th
   - Remaining letters: two distinct letters from allowed set

2. _ E N _ _  (E in 2nd)
   - O must go in 1st, 4th, or 5th
   - Remaining letters: two distinct letters from allowed set

We need a word that fits one of these patterns using only allowed letters.

Candidate words:
- ENOKI – invalid (not a word)
- ENDOG – uses D, G (allowed), but not a common word
- ENVOY – Y is out
- EXON – too short
- INEPT – I, N, E, P, T – T is out
- INBOX – B is out
- OPINE – O, P, I, N, E – but P, I are allowed, and positions:
   - O is 1st (allowed), P is 2nd, I is 3rd, N is 4th (but N must be 3rd), so invalid
- ONION – O, N, I, O, N – N is 3rd, but O is 1st and 4th, which is allowed, but double O/N may not help
- OCEAN – C is out
- PINEO – not a word
- QUINE – Q, U, I, N, E – Q and U are allowed, positions:
   - Q is 1st, U is 2nd, I is 3rd, N is 4th (but N must be 3rd), so invalid
- VINEO – not a word
- WINEO – not a word
- XENON – X, E, N, O, N – N is 3rd, X and O are allowed, positions:
   - X is 1st, E is 2nd, N is 3rd, O is 4th, N is 5th – this fits all constraints!

XENON is a valid word, uses X and O as new letters, and places E, N, O correctly.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 vowels and common consonants. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it includes S, L, A, T, E - covering several very common letters in different positions. It gives us good coverage of vowels and common consonants to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
Since the E was in position 5, the actual E must be in positions 1-4.

Because S, L, A, T are ruled out, we need a word that:
1. Contains E (but not in position 5).
2. Uses only letters that have not been eliminated.
3. Introduces new common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Remaining common letters include R, O, N, I, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, K, etc.

A good second guess should incorporate several of these.  
Some candidates:
- ROUND (R, O, U, N, D) – but no E.
- CRONE (C, R, O, N, E) – has E in position 4 (allowed), plus C, R, O, N.
- PRONE (P, R, O, N, E) – similar to CRONE but with P.
- CHIME (C, H, I, M, E) – has E in position 4, plus C, H, I, M.

CRONE seems optimal because it adds C, R, O, N while placing E in a new spot (position 4).

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we know:

Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, R  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions we still don’t know: E, O, N  

The word must therefore be composed only of the remaining letters: {B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z} plus the known letters E, O, N.

We have three confirmed letters (E, O, N) and need two more letters from the allowed set.  
We also know:
- E cannot be in position 5 (from SLATE feedback).
- O was in position 3 in CRONE, so O is not in position 3.
- N was in position 4 in CRONE, so N is not in position 4.

A good next guess would place these three known letters in new positions while introducing two new, common letters to narrow things down further.  
Among the most common unused letters now are I, U, D, H, K, M, P.

Candidate words:
- UNITE – uses U, N, I, T, E. But T is already ruled out.
- HOPE – only 4 letters.
- DUNNE – uses D, U, N, N, E. All letters are allowed so far, and it tests D, U, N, E in new positions.
- OPINE – uses O, P, I, N, E. P, I are new and allowed; O, N, E are confirmed letters in different positions.

OPINE seems like the best choice because it:
1. Uses all three confirmed letters (O, P, I, N, E).
2. Places O in position 1 (not 3), P in position 2, I in position 3, N in position 4 (but we know N is not in 4 from CRONE feedback), so this might be risky for N.

Wait, let me reconsider placement to avoid the known bad positions:
- E cannot be 5th.
- O cannot be 3rd.
- N cannot be 4th.

A better word is ""UNITE"" but T is out.  
""POISE"" – but S is out.  
""DOING"" – uses D, O, I, N, G. All letters are allowed so far, and positions are fresh for O, N, E (E is 4th here, which is allowed), plus new letters D and G.

DOING looks good.

But let me pick one that maximizes new info while respecting constraints.  
""POISE"" is invalid (S out).  
""KNOBE"" – not a valid word.  
""OPINE"" has N in 4th, which is invalid.  
""UNION"" – but N is in 4th again.

A valid word that tests new letters and keeps the known letters in fresh spots is ""DUNNO"" but double N might not help.

Best seems ""DOING"" – uses D, O, I, N, G. All letters allowed, positions for O, N, E are new, and D, G are fresh.

But actually, ""DOING"" has I in 3rd, O in 2nd, N in 4th – but N cannot be 4th, so this is invalid.

Let me try ""HOIST"" – but S and T are out.

""PIONE"" – but not a valid word.

""QUINE"" – Q, U, I, N, E. Q and U are new, positions are fresh for O, N, E.

QUINE seems valid and respects all constraints.

But let me pick a more common word.  
""UNION"" – N is 4th, invalid.

""INBOX"" – X is allowed, but B is allowed, I, N, B, O, X. But this has I, N, O, B, X – positions are fresh.

Actually, ""INBOX"" is valid.

But let me choose ""INBOX"" as it uses I, N, B, O, X – all allowed letters, and positions are fresh for the known letters.

But the confirmed letters are E, O, N. So we must include E, O, N in the guess.

So the word must contain E, O, N, and two other allowed letters.

Possible words:
- ""ONION"" – has O, N, I, O, N – but double letters may not help.
- ""ENOKI"" – not a word.
- ""NEON"" – too short.
- ""OCEAN"" – C is out.
- ""BONEY"" – B, O, N, E, Y. All letters allowed, positions: O is 2nd (not 3rd), N is 3rd (not 4th), E is 4th (not 5th). This seems valid.

BONEY is a valid word and fits all constraints.

But let me pick ""BONEY"" as the next guess.

From the three rounds we now know:

Letters definitely NOT in the word:  
S, L, A, T, C, R, B, Y  

Letters that ARE in the word:
- N is in position 3 (✓)
- O is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 (from CRONE and BONEY feedback)
- E is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5 (from SLATE and BONEY feedback)

So the word looks like: _ _ N _ _ with the remaining letters drawn from {D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z} plus the confirmed O and E.

Positions for O and E:
- O cannot be 2nd or 3rd → must be 1st, 4th, or 5th
- E cannot be 4th or 5th → must be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd (but 3rd is N), so E must be 1st or 2nd

Let’s list possible patterns:

1. E _ N _ _  (E in 1st)
   - O must go in 4th or 5th
   - Remaining letters: two distinct letters from allowed set

2. _ E N _ _  (E in 2nd)
   - O must go in 1st, 4th, or 5th
   - Remaining letters: two distinct letters from allowed set

We need a word that fits one of these patterns using only allowed letters.

Candidate words:
- ENOKI – invalid (not a word)
- ENDOG – uses D, G (allowed), but not a common word
- ENVOY – Y is out
- EXON – too short
- INEPT – I, N, E, P, T – T is out
- INBOX – B is out
- OPINE – O, P, I, N, E – but P, I are allowed, and positions:
   - O is 1st (allowed), P is 2nd, I is 3rd, N is 4th (but N must be 3rd), so invalid
- ONION – O, N, I, O, N – N is 3rd, but O is 1st and 4th, which is allowed, but double O/N may not help
- OCEAN – C is out
- PINEO – not a word
- QUINE – Q, U, I, N, E – Q and U are allowed, positions:
   - Q is 1st, U is 2nd, I is 3rd, N is 4th (but N must be 3rd), so invalid
- VINEO – not a word
- WINEO – not a word
- XENON – X, E, N, O, N – N is 3rd, X and O are allowed, positions:
   - X is 1st, E is 2nd, N is 3rd, O is 4th, N is 5th – this fits all constraints!

XENON is a valid word, uses X and O as new letters, and places E, N, O correctly.

From the four rounds we now know:

Letters definitely NOT in the word:  
S, L, A, T, C, R, B, Y, X  

Letters that ARE in the word and in the correct positions:
- E is in position 2 (✓)
- N is in position 3 (✓)
- O is in position 4 (✓)

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
- N (the fifth letter) is NOT in position 5 (from XENON feedback: N(-)), so the second N must be in position 1 or 5, but position 5 is already taken by the final letter, and we have a 5-letter word, so the word must be _ E N O _ with the last letter being N.

So the word pattern is: _ E N O N

Letters allowed so far: {D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, Z} (all letters except the eliminated ones).

We need a first letter from these allowed letters.

Possible words:
- DENON – not a common word
- FENON – not a word
- GENON – not a word
- HENON – not a word
- JENON – not a word
- KENON – not a word
- MENON – not a word
