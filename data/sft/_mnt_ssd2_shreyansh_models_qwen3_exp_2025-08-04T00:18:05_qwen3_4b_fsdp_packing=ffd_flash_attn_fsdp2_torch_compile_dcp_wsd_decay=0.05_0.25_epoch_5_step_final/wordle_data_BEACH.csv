### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several possibilities quickly. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, T, N, L, S). 

One such word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common letter in English

This should give me good coverage to narrow down the possibilities for the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T are not in the word at all (x).
- A is in the word and in the correct 3rd position (✓).
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position (-).

So the secret word looks like: _ _ A _ _

Next, I want a word that:
- Has A in the 3rd position.
- Contains E but not at the end.
- Avoids S, L, T entirely.
- Uses other common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

A good candidate is ""EARLY"":
- E in 1st position (new spot for E).
- A in 3rd position (matches requirement).
- R, L, Y are new letters; L is allowed because feedback only ruled out L in the wrong position, not L entirely.
- Y is a common letter and hasn't been tested yet.

This should efficiently test new letters while respecting the constraints.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

1. SLATE → x x ✓ x –  
   – A is in the word and in position 3.  
   – E is in the word but not in positions 5 or 1 or 2 (because in CANED it also showed – in position 4, so E must be in position 4).

   Therefore the word must be: _ A _ E _

2. Letters already ruled out: S, L, T, R, Y, N, D.

3. From CANED we also saw:
   – C is in the word but not in position 1 (– in position 1).  
   – A is in the word but not in position 2 (– in position 2).  
   – E is in the word but not in position 4 (– in position 4).  
   – D is not in the word (x).

   These are all consistent with the above.

So far we have:
- Pattern: _ A _ E _
- Must contain C (but not in position 1).  
- Cannot use: S, L, T, R, Y, N, D.
- Remaining unused common letters: B, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that fits _ A _ E _ and uses C somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4 (but position 3 is already A), so C must be in position 2 or 4. However, position 4 is already E, so C must be in position 2.

Thus the pattern is: _ A C E _

Looking for common 5-letter words matching “_ A C E _”:

- ACEID – not a word  
- ACEIT – not a word  
- AGAVE – uses G and V, but V is less common  
- AMBLE – uses M and B, but L is ruled out  
- APICE – not a word  
- APACE – not a word  
- AGAVE – valid word, uses G and V  
- AMICE – not common  
- AFOCE – not a word  
- AFOGE – not a word  
- AHOCE – not a word  
- AGAVE – seems to be the only common word fitting.

AGAVE is a valid English word (a type of succulent), and it uses:
- A in position 1 (allowed)  
- G in position 2 (new letter)  
- A in position 3 (matches required A)  
- V in position 4 (new letter)  
- E in position 5 (but wait – E must be in position 4, not 5!)

Oops – I misread. The pattern is _ A _ E _, so position 4 must be E, and position 5 must be something else. Therefore AGAVE is invalid because in AGAVE the E is in position 4, but the A is also in position 3, and the word is A G A V E – which would be _ A _ E _ with G in 2 and V in 4, but position 4 must be E. So AGAVE is actually invalid because the E is in position 5.

Let me rethink with the correct pattern _ A _ E _.

Possible words:
- B A C E ? – no common word  
- F A C E ? – FACET (but T is ruled out)  
- H A C E ? – HACE? no  
- M A C E ? – MACED (D ruled out)  
- P A C E ? – PACED (D ruled out)  
- G A C E ? – GACE? no  
- V A C E ? – VACE? no  
- W A C E ? – WACE? no  
- C A _ E _ – but C must be in position 2 (from earlier conclusion that C must be in position 2), so word is _ A C E _

Looking up common _ A C E _ words:
- AGAVE – invalid, E is last  
- ACUTE – uses T (ruled out)  
- ACORN – N ruled out  
- ACIDIC – too long  
- ACID – too short  
- AGAVE – already seen  
- AMBLE – L ruled out  
- AMPLE – L ruled out  
- ANGEL – N, L ruled out  
- ANISE – N, S ruled out  
- AROSE – R, S ruled out  
- ASIDE – S ruled out  
- AUGUR – R, U ruled out  
- AUXIN – X, U ruled out  

Wait, let me check _ A C E _ more carefully. The only common word I can find is ""AGAVE"" but that has E in position 5, not 4. It seems there are no common English words matching _ A C E _ except possibly less common ones.

But we know from CANED that C is in the word (but not position 1), and from SLATE that A is in position 3, and E is in position 4. So the word must be _ A _ E _ with C somewhere, but C can't be in position 1 (from CANED), and can't be in position 2 (because A is there), can't be in position 3 (A), can't be in position 4 (E), so C must be in position 5.

Thus the pattern is _ A _ E C.

Looking for common _ A _ E C words:
- AGAVE – no, E is 5th  
- AMPLE – L ruled out  
- ANGEL – N, L ruled out  
- AROSE – R, S ruled out  
- ASIDE – S ruled out  
- AUGUR – R ruled out  
- AUXIN – X ruled out  

The only common word fitting _ A _ E C is ""AMPLE"" but L is ruled out. Next is ""ANGLE"" but N and L are ruled out. ""AROSE"" has R and S ruled out. ""ASIDE"" has S ruled out. ""AUGUR"" has R ruled out. ""AUXIN"" has X ruled out.

This suggests we need to look for less common letters. Remaining letters include B, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, etc.

Possible words:
- AGAVE – invalid  
- AMPLE – L ruled out  
- ANGEL – N, L ruled out  
- AFOGE – not a word  
- AFOCE – not a word  
- AGAVE – invalid  
- AHAVE – not a word  
- AMECE – not a word  
- APICE – not a word  
- ARCE – too short  
- AVACE – not a word  
- AWAKE – K is allowed, but E is 5th, must be 4th  
- AWECE – not a word  

Wait, let me think systematically with the pattern _ A _ E C and allowed letters (excluding S, L, T, R, Y, N, D):

Possible first letters: B, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, etc.

Third letters: must be C (only remaining spot for C).

Thus the word must be _ A C E C – but that's not a word.

This suggests I made an error earlier. From CANED we know C is in the word but not in position 1. From SLATE we know A is in position 3. From CANED we also know E is in the word but not in positions 5, 1, or 4 (from SLATE it was not 5, from CANED it is not 4, and from EARLY it is not 1). This leaves only position 2 for E, but position 2 is A in the pattern _ A _ E _.

This is a contradiction, meaning my earlier conclusion that E must be in position 4 was incorrect. Let me re-examine:

From SLATE: E is in the word but not in position 5.

From EARLY: E is in the word but not in position 1.

From CANED: E is in the word but not in position 4.

Thus E can only be in position 2 or 3. But position 3 is A (from SLATE), so E must be in position 2.

Thus the pattern is _ E A _ _.

Now with C also in the word (from CANED, C is in the word but not position 1), and letters ruled out: S, L, T, R, Y, N, D.

So word must be _ E A _ _ with C somewhere (positions 2,3,4,5), but position 2 is E, position 3 is A, so C must be in 4 or 5.

Thus possible patterns: _ E A C _ or _ E A _ C.

Looking for common words:

_ E A C _:
- BEACH – B, H allowed, but C is 4th, A 3rd, E 2nd – matches _ E A C _  
  Letters: B, E, A, C, H – none ruled out except C is in 4th (allowed), positions correct.

_ E A _ C:
- FEAST – S ruled out  
- LEAVE – L ruled out  
- MEANT – N, T ruled out  
- PEACE – P, C allowed, but E is 2nd, A 3rd, C 5th – matches _ E A _ C  
  Letters: P, E, A, C, E – but E is already in 2nd, so double E – allowed, but let's see if this is the most likely.

Between BEACH and PEACE, BEACH seems more likely as a common word.

Let's verify BEACH:
- B: new letter  
- E: in position 2 (matches requirement)  
- A: in position 3 (correct)  
- C: in position 4 (allowed, since C must be in word but not position 1)  
- H: new letter  

No ruled-out letters used.

Thus, next guess is BEACH.
</think>

From all feedback:
- Pattern must be _ E A _ _ (E in 2nd, A in 3rd).  
- C must appear (but not in position 1).  
- Ruled-out letters: S, L, T, R, Y, N, D.

The only common word fitting _ E A _ _ with C in 4th is BEACH.
