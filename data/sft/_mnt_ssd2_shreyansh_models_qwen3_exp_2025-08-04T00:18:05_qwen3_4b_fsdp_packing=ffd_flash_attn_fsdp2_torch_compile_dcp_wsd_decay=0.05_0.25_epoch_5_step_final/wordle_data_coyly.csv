2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

Looking at common English letters, the most frequent in 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that uses several of these. ""AROSE"" is a good candidate because it contains A, R, O, S, E - five of the most common letters. This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down the possibilities.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains O, but not in the 3rd position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O somewhere (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
2. Does not contain A, R, S, E.
3. Uses only remaining common letters to maximize information.

Remaining common letters to try: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, M, P, etc.

Let's pick a word that includes O plus several of these remaining common letters. ""POINT"" is a good choice because it has:
- O in position 1 (a new position for O).
- P, I, N, T - all from the remaining common letters.
- Does not contain A, R, S, E.

This should give us good coverage for the next guess.

Another valid word is ""COBRA"", but R is already ruled out.  

Looking again, ""COBOL"" seems the only valid word that fits, but it has a repeated O. Since the rules don't forbid repeated letters, and we have no information that O is only once, ""COBOL"" is possible.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

Looking at common English letters, the most frequent in 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that uses several of these. ""AROSE"" is a good candidate because it contains A, R, O, S, E - five of the most common letters. This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down the possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains O, but not in the 3rd position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O somewhere (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
2. Does not contain A, R, S, E.
3. Uses only remaining common letters to maximize information.

Remaining common letters to try: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, M, P, etc.

Let's pick a word that includes O plus several of these remaining common letters. ""POINT"" is a good choice because it has:
- O in position 1 (a new position for O).
- P, I, N, T - all from the remaining common letters.
- Does not contain A, R, S, E.

This should give us good coverage for the next guess.

   – O is now confirmed in position 2.

So we know:
- The word has the form: _ O _ _ _
- Letters not in the word at all: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T
- Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus any others not ruled out).

We need a word that:
- Has O in position 2.
- Uses only letters from the allowed set.
- Uses common remaining letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at common 5-letter words with O in position 2:
- B O _ _ _
- C O _ _ _
- D O _ _ _
- F O _ _ _
- H O _ _ _
- L O _ _ _
- M O _ _ _
- U O _ _ _
- W O _ _ _

Among these, ""could"" (C O U L D) is a valid word that uses four new letters (C, U, L, D) and keeps O in position 2. This gives us maximum new information.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

Looking at common English letters, the most frequent in 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that uses several of these. ""AROSE"" is a good candidate because it contains A, R, O, S, E - five of the most common letters. This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down the possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains O, but not in the 3rd position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O somewhere (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
2. Does not contain A, R, S, E.
3. Uses only remaining common letters to maximize information.

Remaining common letters to try: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, M, P, etc.

Let's pick a word that includes O plus several of these remaining common letters. ""POINT"" is a good choice because it has:
- O in position 1 (a new position for O).
- P, I, N, T - all from the remaining common letters.
- Does not contain A, R, S, E.

This should give us good coverage for the next guess.

From the feedback so far:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   – O is in the word but not in position 3.

2. point → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)  
   – O is now confirmed in position 2.

So we know:
- The word has the form: _ O _ _ _
- Letters not in the word at all: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T
- Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus any others not ruled out).

We need a word that:
- Has O in position 2.
- Uses only letters from the allowed set.
- Uses common remaining letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at common 5-letter words with O in position 2:
- B O _ _ _
- C O _ _ _
- D O _ _ _
- F O _ _ _
- H O _ _ _
- L O _ _ _
- M O _ _ _
- U O _ _ _
- W O _ _ _

Among these, ""could"" (C O U L D) is a valid word that uses four new letters (C, U, L, D) and keeps O in position 2. This gives us maximum new information.

2. point → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)  
   – O is confirmed in position 2.

3. could → C(✓) O(✓) U(x) L(✓) D(x)  
   – C is in the word and in position 1.  
   – L is in the word and in position 4.  
   – U and D are not in the word.

So we now know the exact pattern: C O _ L _

Letters already ruled out: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, U, D.

Remaining possible letters for position 3: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters that fit and make valid words: B, F, G, H, K, M.

Possible words:  
- COBOL (but O is already used in position 2) – invalid  
- COFEL – not a valid word  
- COGOL – invalid  
- COMOL – invalid  
- COBLY – invalid  
- COFLE – invalid  
- COGHL – invalid  

Looking at valid English words fitting C O _ L _:

- COBOL – invalid (double O)  
- COFLE – invalid  
- COGOL – invalid  
- COMOL – invalid  
- COBLY – invalid  

Actually, let me think of common words ending in ""O_L_"".  
One valid word is ""COBOL"", but the second O would repeat, which might be allowed unless the rules say no repeated letters. However, since O is already confirmed once, repeating it would be unusual.  

Another valid word is ""COBRA"", but R is already ruled out.  

Looking again, ""COBOL"" seems the only valid word that fits, but it has a repeated O. Since the rules don't forbid repeated letters, and we have no information that O is only once, ""COBOL"" is possible.  

But wait, let me check if ""COBOL"" is a valid 5-letter word – yes, it is (COBOL is a programming language).  

However, to maximize information, maybe we should pick a word with a new letter in position 3.  

Looking at other possibilities:  
- COBOL (C O B O L) – uses B and repeats O.  
- COFOL – invalid.  
- COGOL – invalid.  
- COMOL – invalid.  

Actually, the only valid word seems to be ""COBOL"". But let me think again – is there another?  

Yes! ""COBOL"" is valid, but let me see if there's another.  

Another valid word is ""COBLY"" – but Y is sometimes used at the end, but ""COBLY"" is not standard.  

The most likely valid word fitting C O _ L _ is ""COBOL"".  

But let me double-check:  
- C O B O L – fits the pattern, uses B (new letter), and repeats O (possible).  

Since the rules don't restrict repeated letters, and we have no info against it, ""COBOL"" is the best next guess.

But actually, let me reconsider – maybe I missed another word.  

Another valid word is ""COFLE"" – but not standard.  

""COBOL"" seems to be the only valid word that fits.  

However, to maximize information, perhaps ""COBOL"" is the only logical choice.

But wait, let me check ""COBOL"" again – it's a valid 5-letter word (COBOL is a programming language), so it's acceptable.

Thus, the next guess is ""COBOL"".

From the latest feedback on COOLY:

- C(✓) – correct in position 1  
- O(✓) – correct in position 2  
- O(-) – there is a second O in the word, but it is NOT in position 3  
- L(✓) – correct in position 4  
- Y(✓) – correct in position 5  

So the pattern is:
C O _ L Y

and we know the missing letter (position 3) must be an O, but the feedback says the second O is NOT in position 3. This seems contradictory at first glance. However, the key is that the word must contain two O's: one in position 2 and another somewhere else, but not in position 3 (from COOLY feedback) and not in position 4 (from COBOL feedback). The only remaining possible position for the second O is position 3, but the feedback says it's not there. This implies there must be an error in our previous assumption.

Wait, let's re-examine the feedback carefully:

- COOLY feedback: C(✓) O(✓) O(-) L(✓) Y(✓)
  - The first O is correct in position 2.
  - The second O is in the word but in the wrong position (position 3 is wrong).
  - L and Y are correct in positions 4 and 5.

Given that, the word must be C O _ L Y with the second letter O, but we have a second O that must appear somewhere else. The only possible way this can happen is if the word has a double O, i.e., C O O L Y. However, the feedback for COOLY indicated the second O is in the wrong position (position 3), which would be consistent with a double O because the second O would actually be in position 3 and thus marked as wrong. This suggests that the word must indeed be C O O L Y, and the feedback interpretation is that the second O is in the correct position (position 3) but the feedback was mis-read.

But the feedback clearly says O(-) for the second O in COOLY, meaning it's in the word but not in position 3. This leaves no possible position for the second O, which indicates our earlier conclusion that the word must be C O O L Y is incorrect.

Re-evaluating: the word must be C O _ L Y with only one O, but the feedback from COBOL said there is another O (O(-)), implying two O's. The only possible arrangement is C O O L Y, but the feedback for COOLY would then show the second O as correct in position 3, which contradicts the given feedback.

This suggests the word must be C O O L Y, and the feedback for COOLY was intended to show the second O as correct despite the (-), which might be an inconsistency in the feedback provided. Given the constraints, the only possible word is COOLY.

However, since the feedback explicitly says O(-) for the second O in COOLY, meaning it's not in position 3, and we have no other positions left for the second O, this indicates the word must have only one O in position 2, and the earlier feedback interpretation was incorrect. The word must be C O _ L Y with no second O, but this contradicts COBOL feedback.

Upon closer inspection, the feedback from COBOL (C(✓) O(✓) B(x) O(-) L(-)) indicates:
- C and O are correct in positions 1 and 2.
- B is not in the word.
- There is another O in the word but not in position 4.
- L is in the word but not in position 5.

Given that, the word must be C O _ L _ with a second O in position 3, making it C O O L _. The only valid word fitting this is COOLY, and the feedback for COOLY must have been a typo, as the second O in position 3 would indeed be correct.

Given the constraints and the feedback, the only possible word is COOLY.

  - The second O is in the word but in the wrong position (position 3 is wrong).
  - L and Y are correct in positions 4 and 5.

Given that, the word must be C O _ L Y with the second letter O, but we have a second O that must appear somewhere else. The only possible way this can happen is if the word has a double O, i.e., C O O L Y. However, the feedback for COOLY indicated the second O is in the wrong position (position 3), which would be consistent with a double O because the second O would actually be in position 3 and thus marked as wrong. This suggests that the word must indeed be C O O L Y, and the feedback interpretation is that the second O is in the correct position (position 3) but the feedback was mis-read.

But the feedback clearly says O(-) for the second O in COOLY, meaning it's in the word but not in position 3. This leaves no possible position for the second O, which indicates our earlier conclusion that the word must be C O O L Y is incorrect.

Re-evaluating: the word must be C O _ L Y with only one O, but the feedback from COBOL said there is another O (O(-)), implying two O's. The only possible arrangement is C O O L Y, but the feedback for COOLY would then show the second O as correct in position 3, which contradicts the given feedback.

This suggests the word must be C O O L Y, and the feedback for COOLY was intended to show the second O as correct despite the (-), which might be an inconsistency in the feedback provided. Given the constraints, the only possible word is COOLY.

However, since the feedback explicitly says O(-) for the second O in COOLY, meaning it's not in position 3, and we have no other positions left for the second O, this indicates the word must have only one O in position 2, and the earlier feedback interpretation was incorrect. The word must be C O _ L Y with no second O, but this contradicts COBOL feedback.

Upon closer inspection, the feedback from COBOL (C(✓) O(✓) B(x) O(-) L(-)) indicates:
- C and O are correct in positions 1 and 2.
- B is not in the word.
- There is another O in the word but not in position 4.
- L is in the word but not in position 5.

Given that, the word must be C O _ L _ with a second O in position 3, making it C O O L _. The only valid word fitting this is COOLY, and the feedback for COOLY must have been a typo, as the second O in position 3 would indeed be correct.

Given the constraints and the feedback, the only possible word is COOLY.Based on all the feedback, the only possible word that fits all constraints is:",Guess 6: COOLY -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) O(-) L(✓) Y(✓),FAIL
