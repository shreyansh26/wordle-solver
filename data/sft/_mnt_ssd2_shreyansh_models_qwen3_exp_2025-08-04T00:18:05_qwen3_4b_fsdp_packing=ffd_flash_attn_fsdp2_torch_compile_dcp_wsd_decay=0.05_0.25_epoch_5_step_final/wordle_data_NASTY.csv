For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Common starting strategies include using words with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

A good first guess should balance coverage of these letters without repeating any letters, to maximize information gain. Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (lots of vowels)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a strong starting word that covers several common consonants and all three common vowels (A, E) plus S and T, which are very frequent in English words.

From the feedback:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so S is not in position 1)
- L is not in the word
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is not in position 3)
- T is in the word and in the correct position (so T is in position 4)
- E is not in the word

So we know:
- The word has T in position 4
- It has S somewhere (positions 2,3,4,5) but not position 1
- It has A somewhere (positions 1,2,3,4,5) but not position 3
- It does not contain L or E

Possible structure: _ _ _ T _

We need a word that fits these constraints. Let me think of words with T in the 4th spot, includes S and A, and avoids L and E.

Possible candidates:
- START (but E is not in word, so this has R which we don't know about)
- STAND (has N,D which are unknown)
- STASH (has H which is unknown)
- SATCH (has C which is unknown)
- STAMP (has M,P which are unknown)
- STARK (has R,K which are unknown)

Looking for words with T in position 4, S and A present, and avoiding L and E:

- ASTON (but T is position 4, so A is position 1, S is position 2, but N is unknown)
- ANGST (has N,G,S,T but T is position 4, S is position 3 - but S is in wrong position per feedback, so this has S in position 3 which is allowed since S can be in positions 2,3,4,5)
- ANGST: A(-) means A is in word but not position 1, so this is invalid
- ASTIR: A(-) means A is not position 1, so this is invalid
- ASKIN: has S,A,K,I,N - T is not in position 4
- ASWIR: has A,S,W,I,R - T is not in position 4

- ATMAN: T is position 2, not 4

Hmm, struggling to find words with T in position 4, A not in position 1, S not in position 1, and avoiding L and E. Let me think differently - maybe A is in position 2 or 5.

Looking for words:
- _ A _ T _ with S somewhere

- BASER: T is not position 4
- BASKE: T is not position 4
- BASST: T is position 5, not 4
- BASTA: T is position 4, A is position 5 - this fits:
   - T is position 4 (✓)
   - A is position 5 (allowed since A(-) just says not position 3)
   - S is position 2 (allowed since S is in word but not position 1)
   - No L or E
   - B is new letter to test

BASTA seems valid:
- B (new)
- A (in word, not position 3)
- S (in word, not position 1)
- T (correct position 4)
- A (in word, position 5)

This fits all constraints.
</think>

Based on the feedback:
- T is correctly in position 4.
- S is in the word but not position 1.
- A is in the word but not position 3.
- L and E are not in the word.

A good next guess is BASTA, which:
- Keeps T in position 4.
- Places S in position 2 (allowed).
- Places A in position 5 (allowed).
- Introduces B to test a new consonant.
- Avoids L and E.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Common starting strategies include using words with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

A good first guess should balance coverage of these letters without repeating any letters, to maximize information gain. Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (lots of vowels)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a strong starting word that covers several common consonants and all three common vowels (A, E) plus S and T, which are very frequent in English words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so S is not in position 1)
- L is not in the word
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is not in position 3)
- T is in the word and in the correct position (so T is in position 4)
- E is not in the word

So we know:
- The word has T in position 4
- It has S somewhere (positions 2,3,4,5) but not position 1
- It has A somewhere (positions 1,2,3,4,5) but not position 3
- It does not contain L or E

Possible structure: _ _ _ T _

We need a word that fits these constraints. Let me think of words with T in the 4th spot, includes S and A, and avoids L and E.

Possible candidates:
- START (but E is not in word, so this has R which we don't know about)
- STAND (has N,D which are unknown)
- STASH (has H which is unknown)
- SATCH (has C which is unknown)
- STAMP (has M,P which are unknown)
- STARK (has R,K which are unknown)

Looking for words with T in position 4, S and A present, and avoiding L and E:

- ASTON (but T is position 4, so A is position 1, S is position 2, but N is unknown)
- ANGST (has N,G,S,T but T is position 4, S is position 3 - but S is in wrong position per feedback, so this has S in position 3 which is allowed since S can be in positions 2,3,4,5)
- ANGST: A(-) means A is in word but not position 1, so this is invalid
- ASTIR: A(-) means A is not position 1, so this is invalid
- ASKIN: has S,A,K,I,N - T is not in position 4
- ASWIR: has A,S,W,I,R - T is not in position 4
- ATSIC: has A,T,S,I,C - T is position 2, not 4
- ATMAN: T is position 2, not 4
- ATLAS: T is position 2, not 4, and has L which is invalid
- ASTRA: T is position 4, A is position 1 - but A(-) means A is not position 1
- ASKET: has A,S,K,E,T - E is invalid
- ASTER: has A,S,T,E,R - E is invalid
- ASTON: T is position 4, A is position 1 - A(-) invalid
- ASHAT: T is position 4, A is position 1 and 3 - A(-) invalid
- ASKAT: T is position 4, A is position 1 and 3 - A(-) invalid
- ASKIN: T is not position 4
- ASKIS: T is not position 4
- ASKOS: T is not position 4
- ASKOT: T is position 4, A is position 1 - A(-) invalid
- ASSET: T is not position 4
- ASSTO: T is position 4, but A is not present
- ASWIR: T is not position 4
- ASWIT: T is position 4, A is position 1 - A(-) invalid
- ASWOK: T is not position 4
- ASWOT: T is position 4, A is position 1 - A(-) invalid

Hmm, struggling to find words with T in position 4, A not in position 1, S not in position 1, and avoiding L and E. Let me think differently - maybe A is in position 2 or 5.

Looking for words:
- _ A _ T _ with S somewhere
- _ _ S T _ with A somewhere
- _ _ _ T _ with S and A

Possible words:
- BASIN: T is not position 4
- BASAL: T is not position 4
- BASER: T is not position 4
- BASIN: T is not position 4
- BASAL: T is not position 4
- BASER: T is not position 4
- BASKE: T is not position 4
- BASST: T is position 5, not 4
- BASTA: T is position 4, A is position 5 - this fits:
   - T is position 4 (✓)
   - A is position 5 (allowed since A(-) just says not position 3)
   - S is position 2 (allowed since S is in word but not position 1)
   - No L or E
   - B is new letter to test

BASTA seems valid:
- B (new)
- A (in word, not position 3)
- S (in word, not position 1)
- T (correct position 4)
- A (in word, position 5)

This fits all constraints.Based on the feedback:
- T is correctly in position 4.
- S is in the word but not position 1.
- A is in the word but not position 3.
- L and E are not in the word.

A good next guess is BASTA, which:
- Keeps T in position 4.
- Places S in position 2 (allowed).
- Places A in position 5 (allowed).
- Introduces B to test a new consonant.
- Avoids L and E.

- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – but we already have an A in position 2 confirmed, so this second A must be in one of the remaining positions (1 or 5) but not 3 (already satisfied).

So the current pattern is:
- Position 1: unknown, but not S, T, A, L, E, B
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: S
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: unknown, but must be A (since the second A must go somewhere and position 3 is S)

- F: new letter
- A: confirmed position 2
- S: confirmed position 3

- A: must be position 5 as position 1 is invalid for A

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Common starting strategies include using words with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

A good first guess should balance coverage of these letters without repeating any letters, to maximize information gain. Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (lots of vowels)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a strong starting word that covers several common consonants and all three common vowels (A, E) plus S and T, which are very frequent in English words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so S is not in position 1)
- L is not in the word
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is not in position 3)
- T is in the word and in the correct position (so T is in position 4)
- E is not in the word

So we know:
- The word has T in position 4
- It has S somewhere (positions 2,3,4,5) but not position 1
- It has A somewhere (positions 1,2,3,4,5) but not position 3
- It does not contain L or E

Possible structure: _ _ _ T _

We need a word that fits these constraints. Let me think of words with T in the 4th spot, includes S and A, and avoids L and E.

Possible candidates:
- START (but E is not in word, so this has R which we don't know about)
- STAND (has N,D which are unknown)
- STASH (has H which is unknown)
- SATCH (has C which is unknown)
- STAMP (has M,P which are unknown)
- STARK (has R,K which are unknown)

Looking for words with T in position 4, S and A present, and avoiding L and E:

- ASTON (but T is position 4, so A is position 1, S is position 2, but N is unknown)
- ANGST (has N,G,S,T but T is position 4, S is position 3 - but S is in wrong position per feedback, so this has S in position 3 which is allowed since S can be in positions 2,3,4,5)
- ANGST: A(-) means A is in word but not position 1, so this is invalid
- ASTIR: A(-) means A is not position 1, so this is invalid
- ASKIN: has S,A,K,I,N - T is not in position 4
- ASWIR: has A,S,W,I,R - T is not in position 4
- ATSIC: has A,T,S,I,C - T is position 2, not 4
- ATMAN: T is position 2, not 4
- ATLAS: T is position 2, not 4, and has L which is invalid
- ASTRA: T is position 4, A is position 1 - but A(-) means A is not position 1
- ASKET: has A,S,K,E,T - E is invalid
- ASTER: has A,S,T,E,R - E is invalid
- ASTON: T is position 4, A is position 1 - A(-) invalid
- ASHAT: T is position 4, A is position 1 and 3 - A(-) invalid
- ASKAT: T is position 4, A is position 1 and 3 - A(-) invalid
- ASKIN: T is not position 4
- ASKIS: T is not position 4
- ASKOS: T is not position 4
- ASKOT: T is position 4, A is position 1 - A(-) invalid
- ASSET: T is not position 4
- ASSTO: T is position 4, but A is not present
- ASWIR: T is not position 4
- ASWIT: T is position 4, A is position 1 - A(-) invalid
- ASWOK: T is not position 4
- ASWOT: T is position 4, A is position 1 - A(-) invalid

Hmm, struggling to find words with T in position 4, A not in position 1, S not in position 1, and avoiding L and E. Let me think differently - maybe A is in position 2 or 5.

Looking for words:
- _ A _ T _ with S somewhere
- _ _ S T _ with A somewhere
- _ _ _ T _ with S and A

Possible words:
- BASIN: T is not position 4
- BASAL: T is not position 4
- BASER: T is not position 4
- BASIN: T is not position 4
- BASAL: T is not position 4
- BASER: T is not position 4
- BASKE: T is not position 4
- BASST: T is position 5, not 4
- BASTA: T is position 4, A is position 5 - this fits:
   - T is position 4 (✓)
   - A is position 5 (allowed since A(-) just says not position 3)
   - S is position 2 (allowed since S is in word but not position 1)
   - No L or E
   - B is new letter to test

BASTA seems valid:
- B (new)
- A (in word, not position 3)
- S (in word, not position 1)
- T (correct position 4)
- A (in word, position 5)

This fits all constraints.Based on the feedback:
- T is correctly in position 4.
- S is in the word but not position 1.
- A is in the word but not position 3.
- L and E are not in the word.

A good next guess is BASTA, which:
- Keeps T in position 4.
- Places S in position 2 (allowed).
- Places A in position 5 (allowed).
- Introduces B to test a new consonant.
- Avoids L and E.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: BASTA -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(✓) A(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on BASTA:
- B is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – this must be position 2
- S is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – this must be position 3
- T is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – this must be position 4
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – but we already have an A in position 2 confirmed, so this second A must be in one of the remaining positions (1 or 5) but not 3 (already satisfied).

So the current pattern is:
- Position 1: unknown, but not S, T, A, L, E, B
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: S
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: unknown, but must be A (since the second A must go somewhere and position 3 is S)

Thus, the word must be: _ A S T A

Looking at common English words ending in ASTA:
- FASTA (but F is less common and we've not tested it)
- LASTA (invalid, contains L)
- CASTA (C is possible, but not common)
- GASTA (G is possible)
- HASTA (H is possible)

Among these, FASTA is the most common word, and F has not been tested yet. Let's verify:
- F: new letter
- A: confirmed position 2
- S: confirmed position 3
- T: confirmed position 4
- A: must be position 5 as position 1 is invalid for A

FASTA fits all constraints.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Common starting strategies include using words with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

A good first guess should balance coverage of these letters without repeating any letters, to maximize information gain. Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (lots of vowels)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a strong starting word that covers several common consonants and all three common vowels (A, E) plus S and T, which are very frequent in English words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so S is not in position 1)
- L is not in the word
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is not in position 3)
- T is in the word and in the correct position (so T is in position 4)
- E is not in the word

So we know:
- The word has T in position 4
- It has S somewhere (positions 2,3,4,5) but not position 1
- It has A somewhere (positions 1,2,3,4,5) but not position 3
- It does not contain L or E

Possible structure: _ _ _ T _

We need a word that fits these constraints. Let me think of words with T in the 4th spot, includes S and A, and avoids L and E.

Possible candidates:
- START (but E is not in word, so this has R which we don't know about)
- STAND (has N,D which are unknown)
- STASH (has H which is unknown)
- SATCH (has C which is unknown)
- STAMP (has M,P which are unknown)
- STARK (has R,K which are unknown)

Looking for words with T in position 4, S and A present, and avoiding L and E:

- ASTON (but T is position 4, so A is position 1, S is position 2, but N is unknown)
- ANGST (has N,G,S,T but T is position 4, S is position 3 - but S is in wrong position per feedback, so this has S in position 3 which is allowed since S can be in positions 2,3,4,5)
- ANGST: A(-) means A is in word but not position 1, so this is invalid
- ASTIR: A(-) means A is not position 1, so this is invalid
- ASKIN: has S,A,K,I,N - T is not in position 4
- ASWIR: has A,S,W,I,R - T is not in position 4
- ATSIC: has A,T,S,I,C - T is position 2, not 4
- ATMAN: T is position 2, not 4
- ATLAS: T is position 2, not 4, and has L which is invalid
- ASTRA: T is position 4, A is position 1 - but A(-) means A is not position 1
- ASKET: has A,S,K,E,T - E is invalid
- ASTER: has A,S,T,E,R - E is invalid
- ASTON: T is position 4, A is position 1 - A(-) invalid
- ASHAT: T is position 4, A is position 1 and 3 - A(-) invalid
- ASKAT: T is position 4, A is position 1 and 3 - A(-) invalid
- ASKIN: T is not position 4
- ASKIS: T is not position 4
- ASKOS: T is not position 4
- ASKOT: T is position 4, A is position 1 - A(-) invalid
- ASSET: T is not position 4
- ASSTO: T is position 4, but A is not present
- ASWIR: T is not position 4
- ASWIT: T is position 4, A is position 1 - A(-) invalid
- ASWOK: T is not position 4
- ASWOT: T is position 4, A is position 1 - A(-) invalid

Hmm, struggling to find words with T in position 4, A not in position 1, S not in position 1, and avoiding L and E. Let me think differently - maybe A is in position 2 or 5.

Looking for words:
- _ A _ T _ with S somewhere
- _ _ S T _ with A somewhere
- _ _ _ T _ with S and A

Possible words:
- BASIN: T is not position 4
- BASAL: T is not position 4
- BASER: T is not position 4
- BASIN: T is not position 4
- BASAL: T is not position 4
- BASER: T is not position 4
- BASKE: T is not position 4
- BASST: T is position 5, not 4
- BASTA: T is position 4, A is position 5 - this fits:
   - T is position 4 (✓)
   - A is position 5 (allowed since A(-) just says not position 3)
   - S is position 2 (allowed since S is in word but not position 1)
   - No L or E
   - B is new letter to test

BASTA seems valid:
- B (new)
- A (in word, not position 3)
- S (in word, not position 1)
- T (correct position 4)
- A (in word, position 5)

This fits all constraints.Based on the feedback:
- T is correctly in position 4.
- S is in the word but not position 1.
- A is in the word but not position 3.
- L and E are not in the word.

A good next guess is BASTA, which:
- Keeps T in position 4.
- Places S in position 2 (allowed).
- Places A in position 5 (allowed).
- Introduces B to test a new consonant.
- Avoids L and E.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: BASTA -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(✓) A(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on BASTA:
- B is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – this must be position 2
- S is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – this must be position 3
- T is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – this must be position 4
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – but we already have an A in position 2 confirmed, so this second A must be in one of the remaining positions (1 or 5) but not 3 (already satisfied).

So the current pattern is:
- Position 1: unknown, but not S, T, A, L, E, B
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: S
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: unknown, but must be A (since the second A must go somewhere and position 3 is S)

Thus, the word must be: _ A S T A

Looking at common English words ending in ASTA:
- FASTA (but F is less common and we've not tested it)
- LASTA (invalid, contains L)
- CASTA (C is possible, but not common)
- GASTA (G is possible)
- HASTA (H is possible)

Among these, FASTA is the most common word, and F has not been tested yet. Let's verify:
- F: new letter
- A: confirmed position 2
- S: confirmed position 3
- T: confirmed position 4
- A: must be position 5 as position 1 is invalid for A

FASTA fits all constraints.

From the feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(x)
   - T is fixed in position 4.
   - S is in the word but not position 1.
   - A is in the word but not position 3.
   - L and E are not in the word.

2. BASTA → B(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(✓) A(-)
   - A is fixed in position 2.
   - S is fixed in position 3.
   - T is fixed in position 4.
   - The last A must appear in position 1 or 5 (cannot be 3 because it’s already excluded).

3. FASTA → F(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(✓) A(-)
   - Confirms A in position 2, S in position 3, T in position 4.
   - The final A must appear in position 1 or 5.
   - F is not in the word.

So the pattern is either:
- A A S T A (but position 1 A is allowed)
- _ A S T A

Looking at common 5-letter words ending in ASTA, the only valid ones are LASTA (invalid, contains L) and HASTA (H is possible). However, the pattern _ A S T A is more likely, and the word must be HASTA.

Let’s check:
- H: new letter
- A: position 2 (✓)
- S: position 3 (✓)
- T: position 4 (✓)
- A: position 5 (allowed, since position 1 is H and position 3 is S)

HASTA is a valid English word and fits all constraints.

From all feedback:

- Positions 2, 3, 4 are locked: A S T
- The remaining A must appear in position 1 or 5 (cannot be position 3, already excluded).
- Letters already ruled out: L, E, B, F, H.

The pattern is either:
1. A A S T A
2. _ A S T A (with the first letter any remaining consonant)

Looking at common English 5-letter words ending in ASTA, the only valid ones are LASTA (invalid, contains L) and the pattern _ A S T A. The remaining consonants not yet tested are C, D, G, K, M, N, P, R, V, W, Y, etc.

Among these, the most common word fitting _ A S T A is LASTA, but L is already excluded. The next best fit is CASTA (C is still allowed), but it’s not common. Another possibility is NASTA (invalid, not a word). 

However, the pattern A A S T A is also valid and corresponds to the word “Aasta” (a proper noun, but sometimes used in Scrabble). Given the constraints, this seems the only remaining possibility.

Therefore, the word must be A A S T A.

From the feedback on AASTA:
- First A is (-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- Second A is (✓) → A is in position 2 (locked).
- S, T are still (✓) in positions 3, 4 (locked).
- The last A is (-) → A is in the word but not in position 5.

So the pattern is: _ A S T _ and the word must contain an additional A somewhere (but positions 2 and 3,4,5 are taken). The only possible place left for the extra A is position 1 (since position 5 is excluded). Therefore the word must be A A S T _, but the last letter must also be A (since the last A must be in the word but not position 5 - contradiction).

Wait, let’s re-examine:
- The word has 5 letters.
- Positions 2,3,4 are A S T (locked).
- We have two A’s in the word (from feedback: A(-) and A(-) plus the confirmed A in position 2).
- Therefore the remaining A must be in position 1 or 5.
- But from AASTA feedback:
   - First A (-) → not position 1.
   - Last A (-) → not position 5.
- This is impossible; there’s no valid position left for the second A.

This suggests our earlier assumption was wrong. Actually, the feedback shows the same A appearing twice in the guess, but the word only has one A (position 2). The other A’s in the guess are simply marked (-) because they are not in the word or in wrong positions. But we already have A in position 2, so any additional A’s in the guess are extra and their (-) just confirm they are not in the word.

Thus, the word must be _ A S T _, with no additional A required. The only letters left to determine are positions 1 and 5, with the constraints that they are not S, T, A, L, E, B, F, H.

Common consonants left: C, D, G, K, M, N, P, R, V, W, Y.

Looking at _ A S T _, common words are:
- CASTS (invalid, S in 5)
- DASTY (not common)
- GASTS (invalid)
- LASTS (invalid, L)
- NASTS (invalid)
- PASTS (invalid)
- RASTS (invalid)
- VASTS (invalid)
- WASTS (invalid)

But we have T in position 4, so _ A S T _. The only common word is LASTS (invalid), but there’s no valid common word left. This suggests we must have missed something.

Wait, let’s list all possible _ A S T _ with remaining letters:
- C A S T _ : CASTS, CASTE (invalid E), CASTI (not word)
- D A S T _ : DASTS, DASTE (invalid)
- G A S T _ : GASTS, GASTE (invalid)
- K A S T _ : KASTS
- M A S T _ : MASTS (valid word “MASTS”)
- N A S T _ : NASTS
- P A S T _ : PASTS
- R A S T _ : RASTS
- V A S T _ : VASTS
- W A S T _ : WASTS

Among these, MASTS is a valid common word and uses M (not yet excluded).

Therefore, the correct word is MASTS.

<guess>MASTS</guess>",MASTS,"From the feedback on AASTA:
- First A is (-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- Second A is (✓) → A is in position 2 (locked).
- S, T are still (✓) in positions 3, 4 (locked).
- The last A is (-) → A is in the word but not in position 5.

So the pattern is: _ A S T _ and the word must contain an additional A somewhere (but positions 2 and 3,4,5 are taken). The only possible place left for the extra A is position 1 (since position 5 is excluded). Therefore the word must be A A S T _, but the last letter must also be A (since the last A must be in the word but not position 5 - contradiction).

Wait, let’s re-examine:
- The word has 5 letters.
- Positions 2,3,4 are A S T (locked).
- We have two A’s in the word (from feedback: A(-) and A(-) plus the confirmed A in position 2).
- Therefore the remaining A must be in position 1 or 5.
- But from AASTA feedback:
   - First A (-) → not position 1.
   - Last A (-) → not position 5.
- This is impossible; there’s no valid position left for the second A.

This suggests our earlier assumption was wrong. Actually, the feedback shows the same A appearing twice in the guess, but the word only has one A (position 2). The other A’s in the guess are simply marked (-) because they are not in the word or in wrong positions. But we already have A in position 2, so any additional A’s in the guess are extra and their (-) just confirm they are not in the word.

Thus, the word must be _ A S T _, with no additional A required. The only letters left to determine are positions 1 and 5, with the constraints that they are not S, T, A, L, E, B, F, H.

Common consonants left: C, D, G, K, M, N, P, R, V, W, Y.

Looking at _ A S T _, common words are:
- CASTS (invalid, S in 5)
- DASTY (not common)
- GASTS (invalid)
- LASTS (invalid, L)
- NASTS (invalid)
- PASTS (invalid)
- RASTS (invalid)
- VASTS (invalid)
- WASTS (invalid)

But we have T in position 4, so _ A S T _. The only common word is LASTS (invalid), but there’s no valid common word left. This suggests we must have missed something.

Wait, let’s list all possible _ A S T _ with remaining letters:
- C A S T _ : CASTS, CASTE (invalid E), CASTI (not word)
- D A S T _ : DASTS, DASTE (invalid)
- G A S T _ : GASTS, GASTE (invalid)
- K A S T _ : KASTS
- M A S T _ : MASTS (valid word “MASTS”)
- N A S T _ : NASTS
- P A S T _ : PASTS
- R A S T _ : RASTS
- V A S T _ : VASTS
- W A S T _ : WASTS
- Y A S T _ : YASTS

Among these, MASTS is a valid common word and uses M (not yet excluded).

Therefore, the correct word is MASTS.",Guess 6: MASTS -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(✓) S(-),FAIL
