### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of frequent letters and can quickly narrow down possibilities based on which letters are present in the feedback.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: x → not in the word
- L: x → not in the word
- A: - → in the word but wrong position (currently in position 3)
- T: x → not in the word
- E: ✓ → in the word and in position 5

So we know:
- The word ends with E.
- It contains A somewhere, but not in position 3.
- It does NOT contain S, L, or T.

Good next guesses should incorporate the confirmed E and the misplaced A, while avoiding S, L, T. Also, we want to test new common letters. 

Possible candidates:
- CRANE (but has N, C, R)
- CHAED (but has D, H)
- MARES (but has S)
- PACE (but only 4 letters)
- RAISE (but has S)
- GRADE (but has D, G)

Looking at common letters not yet tested: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, etc.

A strong choice is ""CRANE"" because it:
- Keeps the confirmed E in position 5
- Moves A to position 2 (a new position)
- Tests C, R, N (all common consonants)
- Avoids S, L, T

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).\n\nLooking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:\n- S (very common consonant)\n- L (common consonant)\n- A (vowel)\n- T (common consonant)\n- E (most common vowel)\n\nThis combination gives us good coverage of frequent letters and can quickly narrow down possibilities based on which letters are present in the feedback.\n\n<guess>SLATE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on SLATE:\n- S: x → not in the word\n- L: x → not in the word\n- A: - → in the word but wrong position (currently in position 3)\n- T: x → not in the word\n- E: ✓ → in the word and in position 5\n\nSo we know:\n- The word ends with E.\n- It contains A somewhere, but not in position 3.\n- It does NOT contain S, L, or T.\n\nGood next guesses should incorporate the confirmed E and the misplaced A, while avoiding S, L, T.

From the three rounds of feedback we now have:

1. SLATE → x x – – ✓  
   – A is in the word but not in position 3  
   – E is in position 5  

2. CRANE → x x – – ✓  
   – A is still in the word but not in position 3 (and also not in position 2)  
   – E is still in position 5  

3. ABIDE → ✓ ✓ x x ✓  
   – A is in position 1  
   – B is in position 2  
   – I and D are not in the word  
   – E is in position 5  

So the word is now A B _ _ E, and we know the letters S, L, T, C, R, N, I, D are all absent.

Remaining common letters to test: F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with AB  
- Ends with E  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (so no S, L, T, C, R, N, I, D)  
- Has a valid third or fourth letter.

Possible patterns: AB _ _ E  
Letters left to try in positions 3 and 4: F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y.

Good candidates:
- ABFGE – but G and F might be too early to test together  
- ABHME – but H and M  
- ABPGE – but P, G  
- ABVGE – but V, G  
- ABWGE – but W, G  

A strong next test is “ABOVE” because:
- It keeps the confirmed A B _ _ E pattern  
- Tests O (a common vowel we haven’t checked) in position 3  
- Tests V (a common consonant we haven’t checked) in position 4  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

This will quickly tell us if O or V (or both) are part of the word.
