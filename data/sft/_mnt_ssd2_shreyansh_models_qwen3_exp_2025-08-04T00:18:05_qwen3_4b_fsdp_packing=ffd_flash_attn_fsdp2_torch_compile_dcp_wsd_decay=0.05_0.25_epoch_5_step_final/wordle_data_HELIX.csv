For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The best starting words typically contain:

1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.)
3. No repeated letters to maximize letter coverage

Looking at letter frequency in English, some of the best starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and provides good elimination power.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S (1st letter) → x → not in the word at all
- L (2nd letter) → - → L is in the word, but not in 2nd position
- A (3rd letter) → x → not in the word
- T (4th letter) → x → not in the word
- E (5th letter) → - → E is in the word, but not in 5th position

So we know:
- The word contains L and E, but not S, A, T.
- L is not in 2nd position, E is not in 5th position.

Good next guesses should:
1. Keep L and E in new positions
2. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been ruled out
3. Avoid S, A, T

Possible letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

I’ll choose a word that places L and E in new spots and adds common consonants and vowels. A good candidate is ""BLEND"":
- B, N, D are new letters
- L moves to 2nd position (allowed, since earlier feedback only ruled out 2nd for L, not others)
- E moves to 3rd position (allowed, since 5th was ruled out)

But wait, in SLATE, L was in 2nd position and got ""-"", meaning L is in word but not in 2nd position. So 2nd position for L is ruled out. I need to move L elsewhere.

Let me rethink:
- L must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5
- E must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4

A better word is ""FLUME"":
- F, U, M are new letters
- L is in 3rd position (allowed)
- E is in 4th position (allowed)
- Uses common letters and meets constraints

But FLUME has F which is less common. Maybe ""ELBOW"":
- E in 1st position (allowed)
- L in 2nd position → but this is 2nd for L, which was ruled out (from SLATE feedback L was in 2nd and got ""-""). So L cannot be in 2nd position.

Let me try ""ELDER"":
- E in 1st and 4th positions (allowed)
- L in 2nd and 5th positions → 2nd for L is ruled out (from SLATE), so this is invalid.

Next option: ""CLERK"":
- C, R, K are new letters
- L is 2nd position → ruled out.

Another option: ""BLEAK"":
- B, K are new letters
- L is 2nd position → ruled out.

Let me try ""LEMON"":
- L is 1st position (allowed)
- E is 2nd position (allowed)
- M, O, N are new letters
- This seems valid.

But let me check if there's a better word that uses more common letters. ""PERL"" is 4 letters, so invalid. ""PERL"" is 4 letters, so not applicable.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The best starting words typically contain:

1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.)
3. No repeated letters to maximize letter coverage

Looking at letter frequency in English, some of the best starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and provides good elimination power.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S (1st letter) → x → not in the word at all
- L (2nd letter) → - → L is in the word, but not in 2nd position
- A (3rd letter) → x → not in the word
- T (4th letter) → x → not in the word
- E (5th letter) → - → E is in the word, but not in 5th position

So we know:
- The word contains L and E, but not S, A, T.
- L is not in 2nd position, E is not in 5th position.

Good next guesses should:
1. Keep L and E in new positions
2. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been ruled out
3. Avoid S, A, T

Possible letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

I’ll choose a word that places L and E in new spots and adds common consonants and vowels. A good candidate is ""BLEND"":
- B, N, D are new letters
- L moves to 2nd position (allowed, since earlier feedback only ruled out 2nd for L, not others)
- E moves to 3rd position (allowed, since 5th was ruled out)

But wait, in SLATE, L was in 2nd position and got ""-"", meaning L is in word but not in 2nd position. So 2nd position for L is ruled out. I need to move L elsewhere.

Let me rethink:
- L must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5
- E must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4

A better word is ""FLUME"":
- F, U, M are new letters
- L is in 3rd position (allowed)
- E is in 4th position (allowed)
- Uses common letters and meets constraints

But FLUME has F which is less common. Maybe ""ELBOW"":
- E in 1st position (allowed)
- L in 2nd position → but this is 2nd for L, which was ruled out (from SLATE feedback L was in 2nd and got ""-""). So L cannot be in 2nd position.

Let me try ""ELDER"":
- E in 1st and 4th positions (allowed)
- L in 2nd and 5th positions → 2nd for L is ruled out (from SLATE), so this is invalid.

Next option: ""CLERK"":
- C, R, K are new letters
- L is 2nd position → ruled out.

Another option: ""BLEAK"":
- B, K are new letters
- L is 2nd position → ruled out.

Let me try ""LEMON"":
- L is 1st position (allowed)
- E is 2nd position (allowed)
- M, O, N are new letters
- This seems valid.

But let me check if there's a better word that uses more common letters. ""PERL"" is 4 letters, so invalid. ""PERL"" is 4 letters, so not applicable.

Another option: ""ELIM"" - 4 letters.

Let me go with ""LEMON"" as it fits all constraints:
- L in 1st position (allowed)
- E in 2nd position (allowed)
- M, O, N are new letters
- All letters are common and valid
