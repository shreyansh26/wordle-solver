### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S: very common starting letter
- L, A, T, E: all among the most frequent letters in English
This will help me quickly identify which of these common letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

3. Contains the letter D, but D is not in position 5 (from BLEND feedback: D(-)).
4. Excludes: S, A, T, B, N.

So the word has:
- L fixed at position 2.
- E somewhere among positions 1, 4, or 5 (cannot be 3 or 2).
- D somewhere among positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (cannot be 5).
- No S, A, T, B, N.

Possible positions for E and D:
- E could be at 1, 4, or 5.
- D could be at 1, 2, 3, or 4.

But position 2 is already L, so D could be at 1, 3, or 4.

Let's consider possible combinations:

Case 1: E at position 1
Word would be E L _ _ _
Then D must be at 3 or 4 (cannot be 1,2,5 due to constraints).
Possible: E L D _ _ or E L _ D _
Examples: ELDER, ELBOW (invalid, no D), ELDOR (invalid), but ELDER fits: E L D E R. But R is allowed.

Case 2: E at position 4
Word would be _ L _ E _
Then D must be at 1, 3, or 4. But 4 is E, so D at 1 or 3.
Possible: D L _ E _ or _ L D E _
Examples: D L E E _ (invalid), C L E E R (invalid), but D L E R _ (invalid), or F L D E _ (invalid).

Case 3: E at position 5

Possible: D L _ _ E, _ L D _ E, _ L _ D E
Examples: D L Y N E (invalid), F L D E E (invalid), but C L I D E (invalid), or P L E D E (invalid).

Looking at valid words:
- ELDER: E L D E R. This fits all constraints: L at 2, E at 1 and 4, D at 3. No S/A/T/B/N. But we don't know if E at 1 is correct, and we have D at 3.

Another valid word: DELVE
D E L V E: But L must be at 2, so this is D E L V E - position 2 is E, but L must be at 2, so this is invalid.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has L in the 2nd position.
2. Contains E somewhere (positions 1, 2, 3, or 4).
3. Does not contain S, A, or T.

Possible candidates:
- BLEND (B, L, E, N, D) – L is 2nd, E is 3rd, no S/A/T
- CLERK (C, L, E, R, K) – L is 2nd, E is 3rd, no S/A/T
- FILED (F, I, L, E, D) – L is 3rd, but we know L must be 2nd, so no
- GLEN (G, L, E, N) – only 4 letters, invalid
- PLUME (P, L, U, M, E) – L is 2nd, E is 5th, but feedback says E is not in 5th, so invalid
- BLEED (B, L, E, E, D) – L is 2nd, E appears in 3rd and 4th, no S/A/T

Among these, ""BLEND"" and ""CLERK"" seem best. ""BLEND"" uses common letters and might help identify vowels/consonants more quickly.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: BLEND -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(✓) E(-) N(x) D(-)

Current constraints:
1. Pattern: _ L _ _ _
2. Contains the letter E, but E is not in position 3 (from BLEND feedback: E(-)).
3. Contains the letter D, but D is not in position 5 (from BLEND feedback: D(-)).
4. Excludes: S, A, T, B, N.

So the word has:
- L fixed at position 2.
- E somewhere among positions 1, 4, or 5 (cannot be 3 or 2).
- D somewhere among positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (cannot be 5).
- No S, A, T, B, N.

Possible positions for E and D:
- E could be at 1, 4, or 5.
- D could be at 1, 2, 3, or 4.

But position 2 is already L, so D could be at 1, 3, or 4.

Let's consider possible combinations:

Case 1: E at position 1
Word would be E L _ _ _
Then D must be at 3 or 4 (cannot be 1,2,5 due to constraints).
Possible: E L D _ _ or E L _ D _
Examples: ELDER, ELBOW (invalid, no D), ELDOR (invalid), but ELDER fits: E L D E R. But R is allowed.

Case 2: E at position 4
Word would be _ L _ E _
Then D must be at 1, 3, or 4. But 4 is E, so D at 1 or 3.
Possible: D L _ E _ or _ L D E _
Examples: D L E E _ (invalid), C L E E R (invalid), but D L E R _ (invalid), or F L D E _ (invalid).

Case 3: E at position 5
Word would be _ L _ _ E
Then D must be at 1, 3, or 4.
Possible: D L _ _ E, _ L D _ E, _ L _ D E
Examples: D L Y N E (invalid), F L D E E (invalid), but C L I D E (invalid), or P L E D E (invalid).

Looking at valid words:
- ELDER: E L D E R. This fits all constraints: L at 2, E at 1 and 4, D at 3. No S/A/T/B/N. But we don't know if E at 1 is correct, and we have D at 3.

Another valid word: DELVE
D E L V E: But L must be at 2, so this is D E L V E - position 2 is E, but L must be at 2, so this is invalid.

Another: ELDOR (invalid, not a word).

Another: FLUME (invalid, has U and M, but no D).

Another: CLIDE (invalid).

Another: GLIDE (G L I D E): This has:
- L at 2 (✓)
- E at 5 (allowed, since E is not at 3, and we don't know about 5 yet)
- D at 4 (allowed, since D is not at 5)
- No S/A/T/B/N
- All letters valid.

This seems like a good candidate.

Another: PLUME (invalid, no D).

Another: ULDER (invalid).

So ""GLIDE"" seems to fit all constraints.

Let me verify:
- Pattern: _ L _ _ _ (GLIDE: G L I D E) - L is at 2 (✓)
- Contains E: yes at 5 (allowed, since E is not at 3, and we don't have info about 5 yet)
- Contains D: yes at 4 (allowed, since D is not at 5)
- Excludes: S, A, T, B, N - none present

Current constraints after three guesses:

1. Pattern: _ L _ _ _  (L is locked in 2nd position)
2. Letters that must appear somewhere:
   - E (from all three guesses; feedback shows it’s not in positions 3, 5, or 4)
   - D (from BLEND and GLIDE; feedback shows it’s not in positions 5 or 4)
3. Letters that are **not** in the word at all:
   G, S, B, N, I, A, T
4. Deductions about E:
   - From SLATE: E is not in position 5.
   - From BLEND: E is not in position 3.
   - From GLIDE: E is not in position 4.
   - Therefore E **must** be in position 1.

5. Deductions about D:
   - From BLEND: D is not in position 5.
   - From GLIDE: D is not in position 4.
   - Therefore D must be in position 3.

So the word now looks like: E L D _ _

Remaining letters must be from the unused alphabet (excluding G, S, B, N, I, A, T).  
Valid consonants left: C, F, H, K, M, P, R, V, W, Y, etc.  
Vowels left: O, U (E is already used).

Possible endings for E L D _ _:
- ELDER (but R is allowed)
- ELDEN (but N is excluded)
- ELDER (only valid 5-letter word that fits)

ELDER:
- Letters: E, L, D, E, R
- No forbidden letters (G, S, B, N, I, A, T)
- Meets all positional constraints
- Uses only remaining valid letters

Therefore, the only remaining valid word is ELDER.
