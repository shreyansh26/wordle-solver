For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants. Some good options are:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - vowel-heavy
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with **SLATE** as it's widely considered one of the best starting words because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T and E (both very common letters)

This should give good coverage to narrow down the possible letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- S, L, A, T are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and does not contain S, L, A, T.

I now need a 5-letter word that ends with E and avoids S, L, A, T.

I’ll try a word with two new consonants and one new vowel to maximize information.  
A strong candidate is **CRONE**:
- C and R are new consonants.
- O is a new vowel.
- Ends with the confirmed E.
- Contains no S, L, A, T.

This should tell me about C, R, O, and confirm/deny the E in position 5 (though we already know E is correct there).

From the feedback so far:

1. SLATE → E is correct in position 5; S, L, A, T are absent.
2. CRONE → N is correct in position 4; C, R, O are absent; E is confirmed in position 5.
3. HINGE → E is correct in position 5; N is in the word but wrong position (-) in position 3; I is in the word but wrong position (-) in position 2; H is in the word but wrong position (-) in position 1; G is absent; N is also marked (-) in position 3, meaning N is in the word but not in position 3.

So the word:
- Ends with NE (positions 4 and 5 are N and E)
- Contains H, I, N (each in wrong positions in HINGE)
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T, C, R, O, G

The pattern is _ _ N E, and the letters H, I must appear somewhere in positions 1-3, but not where they were in HINGE (H not 1st, I not 2nd).

Possible positions:
- H can be in 2 or 3
- I can be in 1 or 3
- N is already in 4th

But N is in 4th and was marked (-) in 3rd, so N is not in 3rd. So possible letters for 1st and 2nd: H, I, plus others.

Let's try to place H and I in new positions:
- If H is 2nd, I could be 1st or 3rd (but 3rd might conflict with N placement)
- If I is 1st, H could be 2nd or 3rd

Let's try:
- 1st: I
- 2nd: H
- 3rd: ? (must be a new letter, not excluded)
- 4th: N
- 5th: E

But we need a 5-letter word ending in NE with I and H in positions 1-3, and N in 4th.

Possible word: IHNE_ – but IHNE_ isn't a valid English word.

Alternative: place H in 3rd and I in 1st:
- 1st: I
- 2st: ? (must include H somewhere)
- 3st: H
- 4st: N
- 5st: E

Word: I _ H N E. Possible: INHNE – not valid.

Alternative: place H in 2nd and I in 3rd:
- _ H _ N E
- I must be in 1st or 3rd. If I is 3rd:
- 1st: ? (must be new letter)
- 2st: H
- 3st: I
- 4st: N
- 5st: E

Word: _ H I N E. Possible: DHINE – but D is allowed. DHINE is not a common word. FHINE? Not valid. MHINE? Not valid. PHINE? Not valid. VHINE? Not valid.

Alternative: place I in 1st and H in 2nd:
- I H _ N E. Possible: I H _ N E. IHNE_ – not valid.

Alternative: maybe the word is _ I H N E. Possible: BIHNE – not valid.

Hmm, maybe we need to include another letter. Wait, we know H and I are in the word but in wrong positions. The word must contain H and I, and N is already in 4th, E in 5th.

Let's try:
- 1st: B (new letter)
- 2nd: I
- 3rd: H
- 4th: N
- 5th: E

Word: B I H N E – ""BIHNE"" – not valid.

Alternative: 1st: F, 2nd: I, 3rd: H, 4th: N, 5th: E – FIHNE – not valid.

Alternative: 1st: M, 2nd: I, 3rd: H, 4th: N, 5th: E – MIHNE – not valid.

Alternative: 1st: P, 2nd: I, 3rd: H, 4th: N, 5th: E – PIHNE – not valid.

Alternative: 1st: V, 2nd: I, 3rd: H, 4th: N, 5th: E – VIHNE – not valid.

Alternative: maybe H is in 1st, but feedback says H is in word but wrong position (-) in position 1, so H cannot be 1st. So H must be 2nd or 3rd.

Similarly, I is in word but wrong position (-) in position 2, so I cannot be 2nd, must be 1st or 3rd.

Let's try:
- 1st: I
- 2nd: ? (new letter)
- 3rd: H
- 4th: N
- 5th: E

Word: I _ H N E. Possible: INHNE – not valid.

Alternative: 1st: I, 2nd: D, 3rd: H, 4th: N, 5th: E – IDHNE – not valid.

Alternative: 1st: I, 2nd: K, 3rd: H, 4th: N, 5th: E – IHKNE – not valid.

Alternative: 1st: I, 2nd: B, 3rd: H, 4th: N, 5th: E – IBHNE – not valid.

This is tricky. Maybe the word is ""INHNE"" – but not valid. Let me think of valid 5-letter words ending in NE with N in 4th, and containing H and I.

Possible valid words: ""MINHE"" – no. ""PINHE"" – no. ""SHINE"" – but S is excluded. ""WHINE"" – W is allowed, H is in 2nd, I is in 3rd. Let's check:

WHINE:
- W: new
- H: in 2nd (was 1st before, now 2nd – allowed)
- I: in 3rd (was 2nd before, now 3rd – allowed)
- N: in 4th (correct)
- E: in 5th (correct)

Letters used: W, H, I, N, E. None of S, L, A, T, C, R, O, G are present. This seems valid.

So ""WHINE"" is a good next guess.
</think>

Based on the feedback, we know:
- The word ends with NE (positions 4 and 5 are N and E).
- The letters H and I are in the word but in wrong positions compared to HINGE.
- Excluded letters: S, L, A, T, C, R, O, G.

A valid 5-letter word that ends in NE, contains H and I, and places them in new positions is **WHINE**.
