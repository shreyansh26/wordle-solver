For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - vowel-heavy
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is often recommended because it covers very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and provides good coverage of the alphabet. It also has a good balance of vowels and consonants. I'll go with CRANE as my first guess.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: x → not in the word
- R: - → in the word but not in position 2
- A: - → in the word but not in position 3
- N: x → not in the word
- E: x → not in the word

So we know:
- The word contains R and A, but not C, N, or E.
- R is not in position 2, A is not in position 3.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both R and A.
2. Does NOT contain C, N, or E.
3. R is not in position 2, A is not in position 3.

Let’s brainstorm possible words:
- BARBS (B, A, R, B, S) – contains A and R, no C/N/E. R is in position 3 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed).
- RABID (R, A, B, I, D) – contains R and A, no C/N/E. R in position 1 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed).
- BRAVO (B, R, A, V, O) – contains R and A, no C/N/E. R in position 2 (not allowed, per feedback).
- RADIO (R, A, D, I, O) – R in position 1 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed), no C/N/E.

RADIO seems like a strong next guess because:
- It contains both R and A.
- It doesn’t contain C, N, or E.
- R is in position 1 (allowed), A is in position 2 (allowed).
- It introduces new common letters (D, I, O) to narrow down possibilities.

- RADIO (R, A, D, I, O) – R in position 1 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed), no C/N/E.

RADIO seems like a strong next guess because:
- It contains both R and A.
- It doesn’t contain C, N, or E.
- R is in position 1 (allowed), A is in position 2 (allowed).
- It introduces new common letters (D, I, O) to narrow down possibilities.

From the new feedback on RADIO:
- R: - → in the word but not in position 1 (so R must be in positions 2,3,4, or 5)
- A: ✓ → in the word AND in position 2
- D: x → not in the word
- I: x → not in the word
- O: x → not in the word

So we now know:
- The word has A in position 2.
- It contains R, but R is NOT in position 1 or 2 (from CRANE feedback), so R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- It does NOT contain C, N, E, D, I, O.

Letters still possible: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the known A and R.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A fixed in position 2.
- R somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- No C, N, E, D, I, O.

Let’s list possible patterns:
_ A _ R _  (R in 4)
_ A _ _ R  (R in 5)
_ A R _ _  (R in 3)

Examples:
- B A R G O – but O is excluded.
- T A R G E – E excluded.
- S A R G O – O excluded.
- L A R G E – E excluded.
- B A R G Y – Y is allowed, but is BARGY a word? Not common.
- T A R K A – K and A again, but A is already in place.
- F A R M – too short.
- S A R M – too short.
- B A R M – not a word.
- S A R G – not a word.
- T A R S – T, A, R, S. That’s 4 letters. Need 5.
- P A R S E – E excluded.
- P A R K – too short.
- S A R D I – D and I excluded.
- L A R G E – E excluded.
- M A R V Y – V and Y allowed, but not common.
- S A R G Y – SARGY not a word.
- T A R P S – T, A, R, P, S. That’s 5 letters. No excluded letters. TARPS is a valid word.

TARPS:
- A in position 2 (matches ✓)
- R in position 3 (allowed, not excluded)
- T, P, S are new letters to test
- No C, N, E, D, I, O

This seems like a good next guess.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - vowel-heavy
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is often recommended because it covers very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and provides good coverage of the alphabet. It also has a good balance of vowels and consonants. I'll go with CRANE as my first guess.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: x → not in the word
- R: - → in the word but not in position 2
- A: - → in the word but not in position 3
- N: x → not in the word
- E: x → not in the word

So we know:
- The word contains R and A, but not C, N, or E.
- R is not in position 2, A is not in position 3.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both R and A.
2. Does NOT contain C, N, or E.
3. R is not in position 2, A is not in position 3.

Let’s brainstorm possible words:
- BARBS (B, A, R, B, S) – contains A and R, no C/N/E. R is in position 3 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed).
- RABID (R, A, B, I, D) – contains R and A, no C/N/E. R in position 1 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed).
- BRAVO (B, R, A, V, O) – contains R and A, no C/N/E. R in position 2 (not allowed, per feedback).
- RADIO (R, A, D, I, O) – R in position 1 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed), no C/N/E.

RADIO seems like a strong next guess because:
- It contains both R and A.
- It doesn’t contain C, N, or E.
- R is in position 1 (allowed), A is in position 2 (allowed).
- It introduces new common letters (D, I, O) to narrow down possibilities.

From the latest feedback on KARMA:
- K: x → not in the word
- A: ✓ → in the word AND in position 2
- R: ✓ → in the word AND in position 3
- M: - → in the word but not in position 4
- A: - → in the word but not in position 5

So we now know:
- Fixed letters: _ A R _ _
- M is in the word but not in position 4, and the last letter is not A.
- Excluded letters so far: C, N, E, D, I, O, T, P, S, K

Letters still allowed: B, F, G, H, J, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Because M must be in the word and cannot be in position 4, the only remaining positions for M are 1 or 5. However, the last letter (position 5) cannot be A (from the feedback), but M could still be there. But looking at the pattern _ A R _ _, if M is in position 1, the word would be M A R _ _, which is possible. If M is in position 5, it would be _ A R _ M.

Let’s list possible words:
- M A R _ _ : possible letters for positions 4 and 5 from remaining allowed letters (excluding A, E, etc.)
  - MARBM, MARFM, etc. – but need valid words
- _ A R _ M : possible letters for positions 1 and 4
  - B A R G M, F A R H M, etc.

Valid 5-letter words fitting _ A R _ _ with M somewhere:
- BARGM – not a word
- FARHM – not a word
- GARBM – not a word
- HARGM – not a word
- LARGM – not a word
- MARCH – C excluded
- MARAM – A is excluded from position 5
- MARMY – Y is allowed, MARMY is a word
- MARRY – Y is allowed, MARRY is a word
- BARGY – already considered
- FARMY – not a word
- GARMY – not a word
- HARMY – not a word
- LARGY – not a word
- VARGY – not a word
- WARMY – not a word
- YARMS – S excluded
- YARMA – A is excluded from position 5

Looking at valid words:
- MARMY: M A R M Y – fits _ A R _ _ pattern, M in position 1 and 4, Y in 5. But M is allowed in 4? From KARMA feedback, M is in the word but not in position 4. So MARMY has M in 4 which is invalid.
- MARRY: M A R R Y – M in 1, R in 3 and 4, Y in 5. This has R twice, but we don’t know if letters can repeat. The secret word is 5 letters, and we have A, R, M confirmed. Repeats are possible.
- BARGY: B A R G Y – B, G, Y allowed, but we have M not placed yet. This doesn’t include M, so invalid.
- FARMY: F A R M Y – F, A, R, M, Y. This includes M in position 4, but M cannot be in position 4 (from KARMA feedback). So invalid.
- LARGY: L A R G Y – doesn’t include M, invalid.
- VARGY: V A R G Y – doesn’t include M, invalid.
- WARMY: W A R M Y – M in position 4, invalid.
- YARMS: Y A R M S – S excluded, invalid.
- YARMA: Y A R M A – A in 5 excluded, invalid.

Wait, let’s re-examine the pattern _ A R _ _. M must be in the word but not in position 4. So possible positions for M are 1 or 5. But position 5 cannot be A (from KARMA feedback), but could be M. However, the word ends with _ A R _ _, so position 5 is the last letter. 

Looking for words:
- M A R _ _ : need a letter in 4 and 5 from allowed list (B, F, G, H, J, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)
  - M A R G Y – not a word
  - M A R V Y – not a word
  - M A R B Y – not a word

  - M A R G M – not a word
  - M A R B M – not a word
  - M A R F M – not a word
  - M A R L M – not a word
  - M A R H M – not a word
  - M A R U M – not a word
  - M A R V Y – not a word
  - M A R G Y – not a word

- _ A R _ M : need letters in 1 and 4
  - B A R G M – not a word

  - L A R G M – not a word
  - H A R G M – not a word
  - V A R G M – not a word
  - W A R G M – not a word
  - Y A R G M – not a word

This is tricky. Let’s think of common words:
- BARGY – doesn’t have M
- FARMY – doesn’t have M
- GARMY – doesn’t have M
- HARGY – doesn’t have M
- LARGY – doesn’t have M
- VARGY – doesn’t have M
- WARGY – doesn’t have M
- YARGY – doesn’t have M

Wait, the word must contain M. The only possible positions for M are 1 or 5 (since 4 is excluded and 2,3 are A,R). 

Looking for:
- M A R _ _ : need valid words
  - M A R G Y – not a word

  - V A R G M – not a word
  - W A R G M – not a word
  - Y A R G M – not a word

This is surprising. Let me check if I missed any valid words. 

Looking at the allowed letters and pattern _ A R _ _:
- B, F, G, H, J, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Possible words:
- BARGY – no M
- FARMY – no M
- MARCH – C excluded
- MARMY – M in 4 excluded
- MARRY – M in 1, R in 3 and 4, Y in 5. This has R twice, but that’s allowed.
- BARGM – not a word
- FARHM – not a word
- GARBM – not a word
- HARGM – not a word
- LARGM – not a word
- VARGM – not a word
- WARGM – not a word
- YARGM – not a word

MARRY seems to be the only valid word fitting _ A R _ _ with M included and no excluded letters, even though it has R twice. 

MARRY:
- M in position 1 (allowed)
- A in 2 (✓)
- R in 3 (✓)
- R in 4 (allowed, not yet excluded)
- Y in 5 (allowed)

This fits all constraints.

- Excluded letters so far: C, N, E, D, I, O, T, P, S, K
