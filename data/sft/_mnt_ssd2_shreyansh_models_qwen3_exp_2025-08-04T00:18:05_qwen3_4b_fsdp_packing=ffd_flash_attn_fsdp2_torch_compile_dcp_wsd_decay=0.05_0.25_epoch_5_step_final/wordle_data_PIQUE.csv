### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with distinct common letters. 

Looking at these, ""SLATE"" is a strong first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common)
- A (most common letter)
- T (common)
- E (most common letter)

This gives us 5 unique common letters that can quickly help narrow down the possibilities.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct last position (✓)

So the secret word ends with E and does not contain S, L, A, T.  
I need a 5-letter word that ends with E and avoids the letters S, L, A, T.

Good remaining common letters to try next are R, N, I, C, O, U, D, H, etc.  
A word like “CRANE” would use C, R, N (all still possible) plus the known E, but A is already ruled out.  
“CHORE” uses C, H, O, R, E – none of the forbidden letters (S, L, A, T), and E is confirmed at the end.  
That seems like a strong second guess.

So far we know:

- The word ends with E (position 5 is E).
- Letters NOT in the word at all: S, L, A, T, C, H, O, R.

Remaining common letters to try: D, I, N, U, G, M, B, F, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.

I want a word that:
1. Ends with E
2. Uses none of the eliminated letters
3. Introduces several new, plausible letters to narrow things down

A good candidate is “UNITE”:
- U, N, I, T, E
- T is already eliminated (x on T in first guess), so avoid T.

Next candidate: “GUINE” – but that’s not a valid 5-letter word.

Another candidate: “MIDGE”:
- M, I, D, G, E
- None of M, I, D, G were eliminated.
- E is confirmed at position 5.

“MIDGE” seems valid and uses fresh letters.

Let me check if any of the letters in MIDGE were already ruled out:
- M: not ruled out
- I: not ruled out
- D: not ruled out
- G: not ruled out
- E: confirmed

So “MIDGE” is a strong next guess.

From the feedback so far:

- Position 5 is definitely E.
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, H, O, R, M, D, G.
- Letters known to be in the word: I (and it is in position 2).
- So the pattern is: _ I _ _ E

1. Has I in position 2.
2. Has E in position 5.

- P I _ _ E → ""P I N E"" needs 5 letters
- F I _ _ E → ""F I N E"" needs 5 letters
- N I _ _ E → ""N I V E"" needs 5 letters

Looking at valid words:
- ""FIREE"" – but R and E are already ruled out for R
- ""FINIE"" – not a word
- ""FINKY"" – Y is allowed, K is allowed, but ends with Y not E
- ""VINYL"" – ends with L which is eliminated

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with distinct common letters. 

Looking at these, ""SLATE"" is a strong first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common)
- A (most common letter)
- T (common)
- E (most common letter)

This gives us 5 unique common letters that can quickly help narrow down the possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct last position (✓)

So the secret word ends with E and does not contain S, L, A, T.  
I need a 5-letter word that ends with E and avoids the letters S, L, A, T.

Good remaining common letters to try next are R, N, I, C, O, U, D, H, etc.  
A word like “CRANE” would use C, R, N (all still possible) plus the known E, but A is already ruled out.  
“CHORE” uses C, H, O, R, E – none of the forbidden letters (S, L, A, T), and E is confirmed at the end.  
That seems like a strong second guess.

So far we know:

- The word ends with E (position 5 is E).
- Letters NOT in the word at all: S, L, A, T, C, H, O, R.

Remaining common letters to try: D, I, N, U, G, M, B, F, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.

I want a word that:
1. Ends with E
2. Uses none of the eliminated letters
3. Introduces several new, plausible letters to narrow things down

A good candidate is “UNITE”:
- U, N, I, T, E
- T is already eliminated (x on T in first guess), so avoid T.

Next candidate: “GUINE” – but that’s not a valid 5-letter word.

Another candidate: “MIDGE”:
- M, I, D, G, E
- None of M, I, D, G were eliminated.
- E is confirmed at position 5.

“MIDGE” seems valid and uses fresh letters.

Let me check if any of the letters in MIDGE were already ruled out:
- M: not ruled out
- I: not ruled out
- D: not ruled out
- G: not ruled out
- E: confirmed

So “MIDGE” is a strong next guess.

From the new feedback on QUINE:

- Position 5 is still E (✓).
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, H, O, R, M, D, G, N.
- Letters known to be in the word but in wrong positions:
  – Q (-) → somewhere in positions 1,2,3,4
  – U (-) → somewhere in positions 1,2,3,4
  – I (-) → somewhere in positions 1,2,3,4
- So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ E and must contain Q, U, I somewhere in the first four positions.

Available letters (not yet eliminated): B, F, J, K, P, V, W, Y, Z, plus any duplicates allowed.

We need a valid 5-letter word ending in E that uses Q, U, I exactly once each, plus two other allowed letters (but we only have four positions to fill with Q, U, I and one more letter that isn’t eliminated).

But we have only four positions to fill with Q, U, I and one more letter (since the fifth is E). However, we must use Q, U, I each once and one more letter from the allowed set. But we have only four slots, so the word must be a permutation of Q, U, I plus one of the allowed letters, ending in E.

Looking at permutations:

- Possible forms: [Q,U,I,X]E or any permutation of Q,U,I,X in positions 1-4 ending in E.

Let’s list possible words:

1. QUIET – but T is eliminated.
2. QUIPE – P is allowed, but not a common word.
3. QUIRE – R is eliminated.
4. QUILT – L and T are eliminated.

Positions of letters:
