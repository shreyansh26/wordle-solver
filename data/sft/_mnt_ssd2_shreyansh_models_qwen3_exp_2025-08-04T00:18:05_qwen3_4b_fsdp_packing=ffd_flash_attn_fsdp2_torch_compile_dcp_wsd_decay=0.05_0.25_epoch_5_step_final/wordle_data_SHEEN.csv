### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use vowels and common consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S, T (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)
- L (moderately common consonant)

This combination should give good coverage to narrow down the remaining letters efficiently. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 (✓)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the word starts with S and has an E somewhere in positions 2-5.  
Letters L, A, T are not in the word at all.

I need a word that:
- Starts with S
- Contains E (but not in position 2)
- Does NOT contain L, A, T

Possible positions for E: 3, 4, or 5.

A good candidate is “SHEER”:
- Starts with S
- Has E in positions 3 and 4
- Uses only remaining common letters (H, R) and avoids L, A, T

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word starts with S (position 1).
2. The word has H in position 2.
3. The word has E in positions 3 and 4 (so the sequence “EE” must appear somewhere).
4. The word does NOT contain L, A, T, or R.

Therefore the pattern so far is:
S H _ E E _  (but the last E may not be in position 5)

However, since we only have 5 letters and we already have S, H, E, E, the only possible positions for these letters are:
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: H
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: ?

But we have only 5 letters total, and we already have S, H, E, E. That fills all positions except possibly position 5, but we already have 4 letters. This suggests that the word must be S H E E _, but that would require a 5th letter, yet we only have 5 positions. Wait, this indicates that the word must be exactly S H E E _, but since we have 5 positions, the word must be S H E E _ with the 5th letter being something else. But we already have S, H, E, E in positions 1-4, leaving only position 5. However, the word must be 5 letters, so the only possible word fitting these constraints is S H E E _, but we don't have information about the 5th letter. However, looking back at the feedback, SHEER gave S(✓) H(✓) E(✓) E(✓) R(x), which means the 5th letter is NOT R. But we have no other information about the 5th letter. 

But wait, the feedback for SHEER shows E(✓) for both the 3rd and 4th positions, which means the 3rd and 4th letters are E. So the word is S H E E _. The 5th letter must be a letter that hasn't been ruled out yet. From previous guesses, ruled out letters are L, A, T, R. 

Possible letters for position 5: any letter not in {L, A, T, R}. Common letters left include D, N, M, C, etc. 

The word ""SHEER"" was guessed, but the 5th letter is NOT R (as per feedback), but we don't have any other feedback on position 5. However, the word must be S H E E _, and the only common 5-letter word fitting this pattern is ""SHEER"" itself, but since R is ruled out, that can't be. This suggests that the word must be S H E E _ with a different 5th letter. 

Looking at possible words: ""SHEEN"" (but N is possible), ""SHEER"" (R ruled out), ""SHEEL"" (L ruled out), ""SHEEK"" (K possible), etc. 

Given that, ""SHEEN"" is a valid word (meaning a shiny surface) and fits S H E E N. 

But let me double-check: the feedback for SHEER was S(✓) H(✓) E(✓) E(✓) R(x), which means:
- Position 1: S ✓
- Position 2: H ✓
- Position 3: E ✓
- Position 4: E ✓
- Position 5: R x (so the 5th letter is not R)

Thus, the word must be S H E E _ with the 5th letter not R. The only common word fitting this is ""SHEEN"" (S H E E N). 

Therefore, the next guess should be ""SHEEN"".
