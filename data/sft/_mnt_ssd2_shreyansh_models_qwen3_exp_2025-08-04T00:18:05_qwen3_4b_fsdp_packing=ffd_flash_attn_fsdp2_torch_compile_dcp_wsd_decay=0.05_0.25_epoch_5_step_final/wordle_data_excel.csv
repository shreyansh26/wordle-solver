### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses some of these high-frequency letters in different positions to help narrow down possibilities quickly. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters and tests vowels in multiple positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word but not in the last position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains E, but E is not in position 5.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has E somewhere in positions 1-4.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining common consonants: T, L, N, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, Y, W, V, Z, X, Q, J.

Vowels left: I, U, Y (Y can act as vowel).

I’ll pick a word that uses E plus some of these remaining common letters. ""UNTIE"" uses U, N, T, I, E – all allowed so far and tests new letters. It also places E in position 4, which is allowed by the feedback.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I  
Letters that ARE in the word, but whose exact positions we still need to confirm: E (and we also know E is not in position 5, from arose, and not in position 5 again from untie).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E, but E is not in position 5.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I.

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, Z, X, Q  
Remaining vowels: E (already known to be present), Y (can act as vowel).

Since E is the only vowel we know is in the word, the other four letters must come from the remaining consonants. A good strategy is to test a few new consonants while keeping E in a new position (1-4).

Let’s pick a word that:
- Uses E in a new position (e.g., position 2 or 3).
- Uses four new consonants from the remaining pool.

A good candidate is “CHEWY”:
- C, H, W, Y are all new letters.
- E is in position 3, which is still allowed.

This should give us information about four new consonants and the placement of E.

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

Letters NOT in the word at all:  
A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, H, W, Y

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still uncertain:  
E (must appear at least once, and not in positions 3 or 5)

Letters whose inclusion we have not yet tested:  
B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, V, X, Q, Z

From chewy we also learned:
- C is in the word but not in position 1 (-)
- E appears at least once but not in position 3 (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains both C and E.
- C is not in position 1.
- E is not in positions 3 or 5.
- Does not contain any of the 11 letters already ruled out.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses C and E.
2. Keeps C away from position 1.
3. Keeps E away from positions 3 and 5.
4. Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Good remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, V, X, Q, Z  
Good remaining vowel: E (only one vowel confirmed so far)

Let’s try to place E in position 1, 2, or 4 and C in allowed positions.

A promising pattern is:  
E _ C _ _  (E in 1, C in 3)  
or  
_ E C _ _  (E in 2, C in 3)  
or  
_ _ C E _  (E in 4, C in 3) — but E can’t be in 5, so this is fine.

Let’s pick “FLECK”:
- F, L, K are new letters.
- E in position 2, C in position 3.
- No disallowed letters.

This tests:
- C in position 3 (allowed).
- E in position 2 (allowed).
- New letters F, L, K.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses some of these high-frequency letters in different positions to help narrow down possibilities quickly. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters and tests vowels in multiple positions.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word but not in the last position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains E, but E is not in position 5.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has E somewhere in positions 1-4.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining common consonants: T, L, N, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, Y, W, V, Z, X, Q, J.

Vowels left: I, U, Y (Y can act as vowel).

I’ll pick a word that uses E plus some of these remaining common letters. ""UNTIE"" uses U, N, T, I, E – all allowed so far and tests new letters. It also places E in position 4, which is allowed by the feedback.

Let’s go with UNTIE.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I  
Letters that ARE in the word, but whose exact positions we still need to confirm: E (and we also know E is not in position 5, from arose, and not in position 5 again from untie).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E, but E is not in position 5.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I.

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, Z, X, Q  
Remaining vowels: E (already known to be present), Y (can act as vowel).

Since E is the only vowel we know is in the word, the other four letters must come from the remaining consonants. A good strategy is to test a few new consonants while keeping E in a new position (1-4).

Let’s pick a word that:
- Uses E in a new position (e.g., position 2 or 3).
- Uses four new consonants from the remaining pool.

A good candidate is “CHEWY”:
- C, H, W, Y are all new letters.
- E is in position 3, which is still allowed.

This should give us information about four new consonants and the placement of E.

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word:  
A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, H, W, Y, F, K

Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:  
C, E, L

Constraints:
- E must appear (only vowel), and it is NOT in positions 3 or 5 (from chewy and arose).
- C must appear and it is NOT in positions 1 or 4 (from arose and fleck).
- L must appear and it is NOT in position 2 (from fleck).

So:
- Positions 1,2,3,4,5 must be filled with letters from the remaining pool: B, D, G, J, M, P, V, X, Q, Z plus the required letters C, E, L.
- We have to use C, E, L exactly once each, and they must go into allowed positions:
  – E can be in 1, 2, or 4
  – C can be in 2 or 3 or 5
  – L can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2)

Let’s list possible placements:

Option 1: E in 1  
Then C and L must fit in 2,3,4,5 with constraints:
- C not in 4
- L not in 2
Possible arrangements:
E C L _ _  (but C would be in 2, allowed; L in 3, allowed)
E L C _ _  (C in 3, allowed)
E _ L C _  (but C in 4, not allowed)
E _ C L _  (C in 3, allowed)
E _ _ L C  (C in 5, allowed)

Option 2: E in 2  
Then C and L must fit in 1,3,4,5:
C can be in 3 or 5 (not 1 or 4)
L can be in 3,4,5 (not 2)
Possible:
C E L _ _
_ E C L _
_ E _ L C
L E C _ _
_ E _ C L
etc.

Option 3: E in 4  
Then C and L must fit in 1,2,3,5:
C can be in 2 or 3 or 5
L can be in 1,3,4,5 (but 4 is E)
So:
C _ E L _
_ C E L _
L _ E C _
etc.

Let’s pick one concrete arrangement that satisfies all constraints and uses only allowed letters.  
Try:  
E in 1, C in 3, L in 4  
Word pattern: E _ C L _

We need one more letter from the remaining pool (B, D, G, J, M, P, V, X, Q, Z).  
Let’s choose D.

Candidate: E D C L _  
But we need a 5-letter word. Let’s try E D C L _ – but that’s 4 letters.  
Actually we need to fill the last position. Let’s pick a valid word that fits.

A valid word fitting E _ C L _ with remaining letters:  
EDCL_ – no valid word.  
Let’s try another pattern:  
C E L _ _

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses some of these high-frequency letters in different positions to help narrow down possibilities quickly. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters and tests vowels in multiple positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word but not in the last position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains E, but E is not in position 5.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has E somewhere in positions 1-4.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining common consonants: T, L, N, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, Y, W, V, Z, X, Q, J.

Vowels left: I, U, Y (Y can act as vowel).

I’ll pick a word that uses E plus some of these remaining common letters. ""UNTIE"" uses U, N, T, I, E – all allowed so far and tests new letters. It also places E in position 4, which is allowed by the feedback.

Let’s go with UNTIE.

Guess 2: untie -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(x) I(x) E(-)

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I  
Letters that ARE in the word, but whose exact positions we still need to confirm: E (and we also know E is not in position 5, from arose, and not in position 5 again from untie).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E, but E is not in position 5.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I.

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, Z, X, Q  
Remaining vowels: E (already known to be present), Y (can act as vowel).

Since E is the only vowel we know is in the word, the other four letters must come from the remaining consonants. A good strategy is to test a few new consonants while keeping E in a new position (1-4).

Let’s pick a word that:
- Uses E in a new position (e.g., position 2 or 3).
- Uses four new consonants from the remaining pool.

A good candidate is “CHEWY”:
- C, H, W, Y are all new letters.
- E is in position 3, which is still allowed.

This should give us information about four new consonants and the placement of E.

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

Letters NOT in the word at all:  
A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, H, W, Y

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still uncertain:  
E (must appear at least once, and not in positions 3 or 5)

Letters whose inclusion we have not yet tested:  
B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, V, X, Q, Z

From chewy we also learned:
- C is in the word but not in position 1 (-)
- E appears at least once but not in position 3 (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains both C and E.
- C is not in position 1.
- E is not in positions 3 or 5.
- Does not contain any of the 11 letters already ruled out.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses C and E.
2. Keeps C away from position 1.
3. Keeps E away from positions 3 and 5.
4. Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Good remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, V, X, Q, Z  
Good remaining vowel: E (only one vowel confirmed so far)

Let’s try to place E in position 1, 2, or 4 and C in allowed positions.

A promising pattern is:  
E _ C _ _  (E in 1, C in 3)  
or  
_ E C _ _  (E in 2, C in 3)  
or  
_ _ C E _  (E in 4, C in 3) — but E can’t be in 5, so this is fine.

Let’s pick “FLECK”:
- F, L, K are new letters.
- E in position 2, C in position 3.
- No disallowed letters.

This tests:
- C in position 3 (allowed).
- E in position 2 (allowed).
- New letters F, L, K.

If this doesn’t pan out, we’ll learn more about F, L, K and the placement of C/E.

Let’s summarize everything we know so far.

Letters we have tested:
A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, H, W, Y, F, K

Letters that are NOT in the word:
A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, H, W, Y, F, K

Letters that ARE in the word (but position unknown):
C, L, E

Specific constraints:
- E is in the word, but NOT in positions 3 or 5 (from arose and chewy).
- C is in the word, but NOT in positions 1 or 4 (from chewy and fleck).
- L is in the word, but NOT in position 2 (from fleck).

So:
- Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 4
- Possible positions for C: 2, 3, 5
- Possible positions for L: 1, 3, 4, 5

We need a 5-letter word that contains exactly the letters C, L, E (and only those, since all other letters have been ruled out).

Let’s list all valid permutations of C, L, E plus two “wildcard” letters, but we only have three letters confirmed. That means the word must be an anagram of C, L, E plus two more letters that we haven’t tested yet. However, every letter we have tested so far is ruled out, so the remaining letters must be among the ones we haven’t used: B, D, G, J, M, P, V, X, Q, Z.

But we know the word contains C, L, E. Let’s look for 5-letter words that contain only C, L, E plus two other letters from the still-allowed set, while respecting the positional constraints.

One systematic way is to list all 5-letter words that contain C, L, E and two other letters from B, D, G, J, M, P, V, X, Q, Z, and check which satisfy the positional constraints.

After scanning a mental list, “CLEVE” comes to mind:
- Letters: C, L, E, V, E
- Contains C, L, E
- V is a new letter (not yet ruled out)
- Positions:
  – C is in position 1 → but we know C cannot be in position 1 (from chewy). So CLEVE is invalid.

Next candidate: “ELCWE” – but W is ruled out.

Another candidate: “CELLO” – O is ruled out.

“CLERK” – K is ruled out.

“CLECK” – K is ruled out.

“CLEAVE” – 6 letters, too long.

“CLAVE” – 5 letters, but V is allowed, positions:
C (pos 1 – invalid), L (pos 2 – invalid), E (pos 3 – invalid), A (ruled out), V (allowed). So invalid.

“EXCEL” – letters: E, X, C, E, L
Positions:
E (pos 1 – allowed), X (allowed), C (pos 3 – allowed), E (pos 4 – allowed), L (pos 5 – allowed)
All constraints satisfied:
- Contains C, L, E
- C not in 1 or 4 (here C is in 3 – OK)
- L not in 2 (here L is in 5 – OK)
- E not in 3 or 5 (here E is in 1 and 4 – OK)
- All letters are allowed (E, X, C, L)

So “EXCEL” is a valid next guess.
