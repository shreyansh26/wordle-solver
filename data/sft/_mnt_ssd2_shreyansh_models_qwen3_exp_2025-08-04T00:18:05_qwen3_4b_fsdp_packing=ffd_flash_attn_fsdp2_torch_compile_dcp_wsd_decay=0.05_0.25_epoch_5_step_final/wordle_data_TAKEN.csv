- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. 

Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A word that uses several of these is ""AROSE"". It contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. This should give me good information about which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems particularly good because it covers vowels and common consonants. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is somewhere other than 1st)
- R is NOT in the word
- O is NOT in the word
- S is NOT in the word
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (so E is somewhere other than 5th)

So we know:
- The word contains A and E, but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain R, O, S.

I want a new guess that:
1. Uses A and E in different positions
2. Avoids R, O, S
3. Introduces new common letters to test

Good remaining common letters: T, L, N, I, C, D, U, M, P

A word that satisfies these is ""TALKE"":
- T: new letter
- A: in position 2 (was in 1, so different)
- L: new letter
- K: new letter
- E: in position 4 (was in 5, so different)

This tests new letters while placing A and E in new positions.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A is in the word, not in position 1
   - E is in the word, not in position 5
   - R, O, S are not in the word

2. TALKE → T(✓) A(✓) L(x) K(-) E(-)
   - T is in the correct position (position 1)
   - A is in the correct position (position 2)
   - E is in the word but not in position 5 (and also not in position 4 from the second guess)
   - K is in the word but not in position 4
   - L is not in the word

So far we know:
- Word starts with T A _ _ _
- Contains E and K somewhere after positions 2
- Does not contain R, O, S, L

Possible positions for E and K:
- E could be in position 3 or 4 (since 5 is excluded from both clues)
- K could be in position 3 or 5 (since 4 is excluded from the second clue)

Let’s list possible patterns:
TA E K _  (E in 3, K in 4, but K can’t be in 4)
TA K E _  (K in 3, E in 4) – valid
TA _ E K  (E in 4, K in 5) – valid
TA _ K E  (E in 5) – invalid (E can’t be in 5)

So the valid patterns are:
- TA K E _
- TA _ E K
- TA _ K E

Now I need a word that fits one of these patterns and uses only letters we haven’t ruled out.

Looking at the first pattern TA K E _:
- Possible letters for last position: common unused letters are N, D, M, P, etc.
- TAKEN is a valid word: T A K E N – fits TA K E _ pattern.

Let’s check:
- T A K E N
  - T(✓) A(✓) K(?) E(?) N(?)
  - K would be in position 3 (was in 4 before, so new position is ok)
  - E would be in position 4 (was in 5 and 4 before, so new position is ok)
  - N is new, but that’s fine – we’re testing it.

This seems like the most straightforward next guess.
