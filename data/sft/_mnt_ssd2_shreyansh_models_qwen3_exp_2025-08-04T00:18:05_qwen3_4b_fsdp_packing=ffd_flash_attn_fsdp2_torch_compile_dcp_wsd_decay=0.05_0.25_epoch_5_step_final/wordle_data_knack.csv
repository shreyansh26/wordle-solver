### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is a strong first guess because it contains:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common letter in English

This combination covers a good spread of letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words, which should provide useful information for narrowing down the secret word.

From the feedback:

- L is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct 3rd position (✓)
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

1. The word has A in the 3rd position: _ _ A _ _
2. The letters S, L, T, E are not in the word at all.
3. We still need to test other common consonants and vowels to find the remaining letters.

Good next letters to test, since they haven’t been ruled out yet: R, N, C, H, M, P, B, D, F, G, K, etc. I’ll choose a word that keeps A in the 3rd position and introduces several new common letters. ""CRANK"" is a strong candidate because:

From the two rounds of feedback:

Known facts
- 3rd letter is A: _ _ A _ _
- A is correctly placed in position 3.
- Letters NOT in the word at all: S, L, T, E, R
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are not yet fixed:
  – C (present but not in position 1)
  – N (present but not in position 4)
  – K (present but not in position 5)

So the pattern so far is:
C? A N? K?  (but positions are wrong)

We need a valid 5-letter word that
1. has A in position 3,
2. contains C, N, K somewhere else (not in their former positions),
3. uses only letters that have not been ruled out.

Candidate letters left (excluding S,L,T,E,R):
A (fixed at pos 3),
plus B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two new consonants to test. Common ones are B, D, F, G, H, M, P, etc.

Let’s try:
- place C in position 2 (since it can’t be 1)
- place N in position 1 (can’t be 4)
- place K in position 2 (can’t be 5) → conflict with C above.

Alternative arrangement:
- N in position 1,
- C in position 2,
- K in position 4 (allowed, since K was in 5 and is now in 4).

Word form: N C A K ?

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is a strong first guess because it contains:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common letter in English

This combination covers a good spread of letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words, which should provide useful information for narrowing down the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct 3rd position (✓)
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word has A in the 3rd position: _ _ A _ _
2. The letters S, L, T, E are not in the word at all.
3. We still need to test other common consonants and vowels to find the remaining letters.

Good next letters to test, since they haven’t been ruled out yet: R, N, C, H, M, P, B, D, F, G, K, etc. I’ll choose a word that keeps A in the 3rd position and introduces several new common letters. ""CRANK"" is a strong candidate because:
- C, R, N, K haven’t been tested yet
- Keeps A in the 3rd position
- Uses common letters

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). \n\nLooking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is a strong first guess because it contains:\n- S: very common starting letter\n- L: common consonant\n- A: common vowel\n- T: common consonant\n- E: most common letter in English\n\nThis combination covers a good spread of letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words, which should provide useful information for narrowing down the secret word.\n\n<guess>SLATE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback:\n- S is NOT in the word (x)\n- L is NOT in the word (x)\n- A is in the word and in the correct 3rd position (✓)\n- T is NOT in the word (x)\n- E is NOT in the word (x)\n\nSo we know:\n1.

We still need to test other common consonants and vowels to find the remaining letters.\n\nGood next letters to test, since they haven’t been ruled out yet: R, N, C, H, M, P, B, D, F, G, K, etc. I’ll choose a word that keeps A in the 3rd position and introduces several new common letters.

From the feedback so far:

1. A is fixed in the 3rd position: _ _ A _ _
2. K is in the word but not in the 5th position (from CRANK feedback: K(-) means it’s in the word but not in position 5).
3. C and R are not in the word (C(x) and R(x) in CRANK).
4. N is in the word but not in the 4th position (N(-) in CRANK).
5. S, L, T, E are already ruled out.

So the pattern is: _ _ A _ _ with K somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 and N somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but 3 is already A).

Possible positions for K and N:
- K can be in 1, 2, 3 (but 3 is A), or 4
- N can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5

We need to test new letters. Good candidates to test next: B, D, F, G, H, M, P, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
- Keeps A in position 3
- Places K in position 2 (since it’s not in 5)
- Places N in position 4 (since it’s not in 4 in CRANK, but we can try it here)
- Tests new consonants B and H

A word that fits: B H A N K
But ""BHANK"" is not a valid English word.

Alternative: P A N K A – but A is already in position 3.

Better: P A N K A is invalid. Let’s try M A N K A – invalid.

Another approach: Since K must be somewhere, and N must be somewhere, let’s try a word like M A N K A – invalid.

Valid word: P A N K A – invalid.

Wait, let’s think of valid 5-letter words with A in position 3, containing both N and K.

Examples: MANIA (but T is ruled out, but we already have A in 3). Wait, MANIA has A in 3? No, MANIA is M A N I A – A in 2 and 5. Not helpful.

Another: P A N K A – invalid.

Let’s try: K A N P A – invalid.

Valid word: P A N K A – invalid.

Actually, let’s list possible words with A in 3rd, containing K and N:

_ _ A _ _

Letters used so far: A (position 3), K (must appear), N (must appear), and letters ruled out: S, L, T, E, C, R.

Possible valid words:
- M A N K A – invalid
- P A N K A – invalid
- B A N K A – invalid
- D A N K A – invalid

Wait, ""ANKLE"" has A in 2, not 3.

Actually, let’s think differently: The word must have A in position 3, and must contain K and N somewhere.

Possible positions:
- K in 1, 2, 4
- N in 1, 2, 4, 5

Let’s try:
- Position 1: N
- Position 2: K
- Position 3: A
- Need two more letters, not yet ruled out: B, D, F, G, H, M, P, etc.

Valid word: N K A _ _ – but NK is not a common start.

Alternative:
- Position 1: B
- Position 2: N
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: K
- Position 5: ?

Word: B N A K _ – invalid.

Another:
- Position 1: P
- Position 2: A – but A is in 3.
No.

Let’s try:
- Position 1: M
- Position 2: A – no, A is in 3.
No.

Valid word: M A N K A – invalid.

Actually, let’s think of valid words with A in position 3, containing N and K:

Valid words:
- MANIA – A in 2 and 5
- CANON – C ruled out
- PANIC – C ruled out
- BANAL – A in 2
- DANKY – Y not tested, but K in 4, N in 2, A in 3: D A N K Y – but A is in 3, so D A N K Y is invalid.

Wait, let’s think systematically:

Pattern: _ _ A _ _

Must contain K and N somewhere.

Possible positions for K and N:
- K can be in 1, 2, 4
- N can be in 1, 2, 4, 5

Let’s try:
- K in 1: K _ A _ _
- N in 5: K _ A _ N
Valid word: K E A P N – but E is ruled out.

- K in 1, N in 2: K N A _ _ – K N A _ _ – KNA__ – KNAID? No.
- K in 1, N in 4: K _ A N _ – K _ A N _ – K B A N _ – invalid.

- K in 2: _ K A _ _
- N in 1: N K A _ _ – N K A _ _ – N K A P _ – invalid.

- K in 2, N in 5: _ K A _ N – _ K A _ N – B K A P N – invalid.

- K in 4: _ _ A K _
- N in 1: N _ A K _ – N _ A K _ – N A A K _ – invalid.
- N in 2: _ N A K _ – _ N A K _ – B N A K _ – invalid.

- K in 4, N in 5: _ _ A K N – _ _ A K N – B A N K N – invalid.

This is tricky. Let’s try a word that doesn’t necessarily place both K and N in new positions but introduces new letters.

We know:
- A is in 3
- K is in word (not 5)
- N is in word (not 4)
- Ruled out: S, L, T, E, C, R

Let’s try a word that has A in 3, K somewhere, N somewhere, and tests new letters.

Valid word: P A N I K – but I not tested yet, and A is in 3.

Actually, let’s try ""PANKY"" – but Y not tested, and A is in 3.

Valid word: P A N K Y – A is in 2, not 3.

Let me think of valid 5-letter words with A in position 3, containing K and N:

- M A N K A – invalid
- P A N K A – invalid
- B A N K A – invalid
- D A N K A – invalid
- G A N K A – invalid

None of these are valid. Let me think of other combinations.

Valid word: M A N K A – invalid.

Actually, let me think of ""ANKLE"" – A in 2, not 3.

Wait, let me try ""PANKY"" – invalid.

Valid word: P A N K Y – invalid.

Let me try ""DANKY"" – invalid.

Valid word: P A N K A – invalid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is a strong first guess because it contains:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common letter in English

This combination covers a good spread of letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words, which should provide useful information for narrowing down the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct 3rd position (✓)
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word has A in the 3rd position: _ _ A _ _
2. The letters S, L, T, E are not in the word at all.
3. We still need to test other common consonants and vowels to find the remaining letters.

Good next letters to test, since they haven’t been ruled out yet: R, N, C, H, M, P, B, D, F, G, K, etc. I’ll choose a word that keeps A in the 3rd position and introduces several new common letters. ""CRANK"" is a strong candidate because:
- C, R, N, K haven’t been tested yet
- Keeps A in the 3rd position
- Uses common letters

- C is in the word but not in 1st position (-).
- N is in the word but not in 4th position (-).
- S, L, T, E, R are eliminated.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- 3rd letter = A
- 5th letter = K
- Contains C and N somewhere (not in positions 1 and 4 respectively)
- No S, L, T, E, R

Candidate letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Possible structure: _ _ A _ K

Let's try to place C and N:
- C cannot be 1st, so it could be 2nd, 3rd (but 3rd is A), 4th (but N might be there), or 5th (but 5th is K). So C is likely 2nd or 4th.
- N cannot be 4th, so it could be 1st, 2nd, 3rd (A), or 5th (K). So N is likely 1st or 2nd.

Let's try N in 1st and C in 2nd: N C A _ K
We need a 4th letter that's not eliminated. Possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
