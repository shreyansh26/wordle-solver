1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions, which should provide useful feedback for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are not in the word at all (x).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains A but not in position 3.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes A (but not in the 3rd position).
2. Excludes S, L, T, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining common consonants: R, N, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, K, V, W, Y, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A is already confirmed and E is out).

Let me try a word that uses A in a different position and introduces new common letters. ""CRANK"" uses C, R, N, K with A in position 2. This seems like a good second guess to test new letters and narrow down possibilities.

Let's summarize what we now know from all feedback:

1. Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, R, N, K, H, I  
   (from the x’s in every guess)

2. Letters confirmed IN the word:
   - C is in position 1 (✓ every time).
   - A is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (it got “-” each time it appeared).
   - D is in the word but NOT in position 5 (got “-” when it was in 5).

So the pattern is definitely:
C _ _ _ _

Since A must appear somewhere and positions 2-4 are ruled out, the only place A can be is position 5.

Therefore the word must be:
C _ _ _ A

Remaining unused common consonants: B, F, G, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining unused vowels: O, U (A is already placed).

We need two new consonants for positions 2 and 3, and one for position 4.
Let’s pick common letters that haven’t been tried yet: B, O, M, P.

A good candidate that fits the pattern C _ _ _ A and uses new letters is “COMPA” – but “COMPA” isn’t a valid English word.  
Another option is “COPPA” – also invalid.  
“COBPA” – invalid.  
“COPRA” – invalid.  
“CUBMA” – invalid.  
“CUMBA” – invalid.

Let’s try “CUBA” – but that’s 4 letters.  
We need 5 letters.

A valid word that fits C _ _ _ A is “CUBA” plus one more letter – but we need to keep it valid.

Let me think of real 5-letter words that start with C and end with A:
- CRIKA – invalid.
- CUBA is 4 letters.
- COBIA – valid word.

COBIA:
- C in 1 (✓)
- O, B, I – but I was already ruled out (I got x in guess 3).
So COBIA is invalid because I is out.

Another valid word: “CUPID” – but I is out.

“CURIA” – I is out.

“CUBA” – 4 letters.

“CLOWN” – no A.

“CAROL” – no.

- COBIA – I is out.
- CUPID – I is out.
- CURIA – I is out.
- CUBIC – ends with C.
- CAVUS – starts with C, ends with A, but V, U, S are allowed?

Actually, let me just construct a valid word that starts with C, ends with A, and uses only allowed letters.

Allowed letters (not yet ruled out):  
Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Vowels: A (already placed at 5), O, U.

“COMBA” – M, B, A – valid word? Yes, “COMBA” is a valid English word (a type of dance or a surname).

COMBA:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions, which should provide useful feedback for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are not in the word at all (x).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains A but not in position 3.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes A (but not in the 3rd position).
2. Excludes S, L, T, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining common consonants: R, N, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, K, V, W, Y, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A is already confirmed and E is out).

Let me try a word that uses A in a different position and introduces new common letters. ""CRANK"" uses C, R, N, K with A in position 2. This seems like a good second guess to test new letters and narrow down possibilities.

So far we know:

- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, R, N, K
- Letters confirmed IN the word:
  – C is in position 1 (✓)
  – A is in the word but not in position 2 or 3 (-)

So the pattern is:
C _ _ _ _
and A must appear in position 4 or 5.

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: I, O, U (A is already placed at 4 or 5).

Let’s try a word that:
1. Keeps C in position 1.
2. Puts A in position 4 (since 5 is also possible, but we’ll test 4 first).
3. Uses new common letters for positions 2, 3, and 5.

A good candidate is “CHAID”:
- C in 1 (confirmed).
- H and I are new common letters.
- A in 4 (testing position 4).
- D is a common consonant.

This should give us more info about positions 2, 3, 5 and whether A is indeed in 4.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters that are NOT in the word (from every x):
S, L, T, E, R, N, K, H, I, O, M, B

Letters that ARE in the word and their constraints:
- C is fixed in position 1 (✓ every time).
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (it got “-” every time it appeared).  
  This is impossible because A already appeared in position 3 and 5 in earlier guesses and was marked “-”, meaning it cannot be in those positions. However, in Guess 4, A appeared in position 5 and was again marked “-”, so A cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5. The only remaining spot for A is position 1, but position 1 is already occupied by C. This contradiction tells us we must have made an error in interpreting the feedback.

Wait, let’s re-examine the feedback carefully:

- Guess 1: SLATE → A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3.
- Guess 2: CRANK → A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3 (it appeared in position 3 again).
- Guess 3: CHAID → A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3 (it appeared in position 3 again).
- Guess 4: COMBA → A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 5.

So the constraints on A are:
- Not in position 3 (from SLATE and CRANK).
- Not in position 5 (from COMBA).

Positions 2 and 4 have not been tested for A yet, so A could be in position 2 or 4.

Letters confirmed IN the word and their positions:
- C is in position 1 (✓).

Letters confirmed IN the word but positions unknown:
- A (must be in position 2 or 4).
- D (from CHAID feedback: D is in the word but not in position 5).

Letters ruled out so far:
S, L, T, E, R, N, K, H, I, O, M, B.

Remaining consonants: C, D, F, G, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: A (must be used), U (not yet tested).

We have the pattern:
C _ _ _ _

We know A must appear somewhere in positions 2 or 4.

Also, D is in the word but not in position 5.

Let’s consider two cases:

Case 1: A is in position 2 → C A _ _ _
Case 2: A is in position 4 → C _ _ A _

We need to place D in one of the remaining positions (3 or 4 or 5) but D cannot be in position 5, so D must be in position 3 or 4.

Let’s explore Case 1: C A _ _ _
Then D must be in position 3 or 4.
Possible words: CA D _ _, CA _ D _
Letters left to fill: positions 3 and 5, using remaining allowed letters (F, G, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, U).

A valid word: CADY_ – but Y is allowed, and CADY is a valid word (short for Cadys or a surname).
But we need to check if all letters are allowed: C, A, D, Y – all are allowed (not in the banned list).

CADY_ – we need a 5-letter word starting with C A D. Possible: CADY followed by a letter, but CADYS is plural, acceptable.

Case 2: C _ _ A _
Then D must be in position 3 (since position 4 is A and position 5 is invalid for D).
So pattern: C _ D A _
Letters left: positions 2 and 5, using remaining allowed letters.
Possible: C U D A _ – but we need a valid word. CUDAS is not valid. CUBAD is invalid. CYDAS is invalid.

Case 1 seems more promising.

Let’s choose CADY_ – the valid word is CADYS (plural), but we need a single 5-letter word. CADY is 4 letters. Actually, CADY is not 5 letters. Let me think of other options.

Looking for valid 5-letter words starting with CA and having D in position 3 or 4.

Valid words:
- CADRE – but R is banned.
- CADOS – O is banned.
- CADGE – G and E, but E is banned.
- CADIC – I is banned.
- CADY is 4 letters.

Actually, let me think differently. We need to construct a valid word with:
C _ _ _ _
A must be in position 2 or 4.
D must be in position 3 or 4 (since not in 5).

Let’s try:
C A D _ _ – then positions 4 and 5 need letters from remaining allowed: F, G, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, U.
A valid word: CADY_ – but CADY is 4 letters. CADGE is invalid (E banned). CADIC is invalid (I banned). CADRE is invalid (R banned).

Next option: C _ _ A D – but D cannot be in position 5 (from CHAID feedback: D is in the word but not in position 5). So D cannot be in position 5.

Thus, D must be in position 3 if A is in position 4.
Pattern: C _ D A _
Letters left: positions 2 and 5.
Position 2: any allowed consonant or U.
Position 5: any allowed consonant or U.

Possible words:
- C U D A _ – need a letter for position 5. CUDAS is invalid. CUDAL is invalid. CUDAX is invalid. CUDGY is invalid.
- C F D A _ – invalid.
- C V D A _ – invalid.

This path seems difficult. Let’s go back to Case 1: C A _ _ _
But we need a valid 5-letter word starting with CA and having D in position 3 or 4.

Actually, CADY is 4 letters. Let me think of CADIC – but I is banned.

Wait, let me list valid 5-letter words starting with CA and using allowed letters (excluding banned: S,L,T,E,R,N,K,H,I,O,M,B).

Valid words:
- CADGE – G, E (E banned)
- CADOS – O banned
- CADRE – R banned
- CADIC – I banned
- CADY is 4 letters
- CAVAL – V, A, L (L banned)
- CAFFE – F, F, E (E banned)
- CAFUS – U, S (S banned)

Hmm, none seem to fit. Let me try C _ _ A _ with D in position 3.

Pattern: C _ D A _
Letters: C, D, A, plus positions 2 and 5.
Position 2: allowed letters: F, G, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, U.
Position 5: allowed letters: F, G, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, U.

Possible words:
- C U D A L – L banned
- C U D A Y – CUDAY? Not a valid word.
- C U D A P – CUDAP? No.
- C U D A F – CUDAF? No.
- C U D A G – CUDAG? No.
- C U D A V – CUDAV? No.
- C U D A Y – CUDAY? Not valid.
- C F D A Y – CFDAY? No.
- C G D A Y – CGDAY? No.

This is tricky. Let me try C A _ D _ – pattern C A _ D _
Positions 3 and 5 need letters from remaining allowed.

Valid words:
- C A R D _ – R banned
- C A D D _ – D repeated, but allowed. CADDY is a valid word (as in ""caddy"" with an extra D and Y).
But D is already confirmed in the word, and CADDY has two D's – this is acceptable.

CADDY:
- C in 1 (✓)
- A in 2 (new position for A)
- D in 3 (valid, not in 5)
- D in 4 (duplicate, but allowed)
- Y in 5 (new letter)

This fits all constraints.

</think>

From all feedback, we know:
- C is fixed in position 1.
- A must be in position 2 or 4 (since it has been ruled out of 3, 5, and now 2/4 are the only open spots).
- D is in the word but not in position 5, so it must appear in 3 or 4.
- Many letters are banned, leaving only a few consonants and vowels.

A valid 5-letter word that fits these constraints is **CADDY**:
- C in 1 (✓)
- A in 2 (new position for A)
- D in 3 (allowed)
- D in 4 (duplicate, but allowed)
- Y in 5 (new letter, not banned)
