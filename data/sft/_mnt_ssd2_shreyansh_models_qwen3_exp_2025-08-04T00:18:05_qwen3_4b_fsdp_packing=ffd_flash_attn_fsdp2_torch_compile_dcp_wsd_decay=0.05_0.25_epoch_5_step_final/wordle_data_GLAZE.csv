### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several possibilities quickly. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common letter in English

This combination gives us good coverage to test multiple letters at once.

   - Word pattern: _ L _ _ E
   - Letters present: L, A, E
   - Letters absent: S, T

2. PLANE → P(x) L(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
   - Word pattern: _ L _ _ E (same)
   - Additional letters absent: P, N
   - A is still present but not in position 3 (it was in 3rd in PLANE and got “✓” for A but “-” in SLATE, meaning A is in the word but not in position 3).

Wait, let’s re-read the feedback carefully:

- SLATE: A(✓) means A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).  
- PLANE: A(✓) again means A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).  

So the feedback symbols are consistent: A is in position 3.

Therefore the pattern is: _ L A _ E

Letters definitely present and fixed: L (position 2), A (position 3), E (position 5).

Letters definitely absent: S, T, P, N.

We still need to fill positions 1 and 4 with letters not yet ruled out.

- C: new letter

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several possibilities quickly. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common letter in English

This combination gives us good coverage to test multiple letters at once.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word (x)
- L is in the word and in the correct 2nd position (✓)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-) — so A exists somewhere else
- T is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct 5th position (✓)

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ L _ _ E
- Letters definitely present: L, A, E
- Letters definitely absent: S, T

Next, I want to test new common consonants and place A in different positions. A good candidate is “PLANE”:
- P: new consonant
- L: matches known position
- A: will be in 3rd position (since it can’t be 1st, 2nd, or 5th)
- N: new consonant
- E: matches known position

This tests P, N, and keeps A in a new spot while confirming L and E.

Guess 2: PLANE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
   - Word pattern: _ L _ _ E
   - Letters present: L, A, E
   - Letters absent: S, T

2. PLANE → P(x) L(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
   - Word pattern: _ L _ _ E (same)
   - Additional letters absent: P, N
   - A is still present but not in position 3 (it was in 3rd in PLANE and got “✓” for A but “-” in SLATE, meaning A is in the word but not in position 3).

Wait, let’s re-read the feedback carefully:

- SLATE: A(✓) means A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).  
- PLANE: A(✓) again means A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).  

So the feedback symbols are consistent: A is in position 3.

Therefore the pattern is: _ L A _ E

Letters definitely present and fixed: L (position 2), A (position 3), E (position 5).

Letters definitely absent: S, T, P, N.

We still need to fill positions 1 and 4 with letters not yet ruled out.

Common remaining consonants: R, D, B, C, G, M, H, etc.

Let’s try “CLAVE”:
- C: new letter
- L: matches position 2
- A: matches position 3
- V: new letter
- E: matches position 5

This fills positions 1 and 4 with new letters and fits the _ L A _ E pattern.

This tests P, N, and keeps A in a new spot while confirming L and E.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: PLANE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
   - Word pattern: _ L _ _ E
   - Letters present: L, A, E
   - Letters absent: S, T

2. PLANE → P(x) L(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
   - Word pattern: _ L _ _ E (same)
   - Additional letters absent: P, N
   - A is still present but not in position 3 (it was in 3rd in PLANE and got “✓” for A but “-” in SLATE, meaning A is in the word but not in position 3).

Wait, let’s re-read the feedback carefully:

- SLATE: A(✓) means A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).  
- PLANE: A(✓) again means A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).  

So the feedback symbols are consistent: A is in position 3.

Therefore the pattern is: _ L A _ E

Letters definitely present and fixed: L (position 2), A (position 3), E (position 5).

Letters definitely absent: S, T, P, N.

We still need to fill positions 1 and 4 with letters not yet ruled out.

Common remaining consonants: R, D, B, C, G, M, H, etc.

Let’s try “CLAVE”:
- C: new letter
- L: matches position 2
- A: matches position 3
- V: new letter
- E: matches position 5

This fills positions 1 and 4 with new letters and fits the _ L A _ E pattern.

From all feedback so far we know:

Pattern: _ L A _ E  
(Positions 2, 3, 5 are fixed as L, A, E)

Letters already ruled out for positions 1 and 4:  
- Position 1: cannot be S, P, C  
- Position 4: cannot be T, N, V  

Letters still allowed for positions 1 and 4 (common remaining consonants):  
R, D, B, G, M, H, F, K, W, Y, etc.

We need a word that:
1. Starts with one of the allowed consonants.
2. Has the sequence L A _ E.

Let’s list possible combinations:

- BLADE  → B (allowed), but D is allowed, but we already have A in position 3.  
- FRAME  → F (allowed), R (allowed)  
- GRADE  → G (allowed), D (allowed)  
- GLARE  → G (allowed), R (allowed)  
- GRACE  → G (allowed), C (C was ruled out) → invalid  
- GRAPE  → G (allowed), P (P was ruled out) → invalid  

Among these, “FRAME” fits perfectly:
- F is allowed (not in any banned list)  
- R is allowed  
- Matches the _ L A _ E pattern: F L A R E

Let’s verify:
- F (position 1): new letter, allowed  
- L (position 2): ✓  
- A (position 3): ✓  
- R (position 4): new letter, allowed  
- E (position 5): ✓  

No conflicts with previous feedback.

From all feedback we now know:

1. Pattern: _ L A _ E  (positions 2,3,5 are locked: L, A, E)
2. Letters definitely absent: S, T, P, N, C, V, F, R, M  
   (These cannot appear anywhere in the word.)

We still need to fill positions 1 and 4 with letters not yet ruled out.  
Remaining common consonants that have not been tried and are not banned:  
D, B, G, H, W, Y, K, etc.

Let’s list valid 5-letter words that fit _ L A _ E and only use allowed letters:

- BLADE → B (allowed), D (allowed)  
- GLARE → G (allowed), R (R is banned) → invalid  
- GRADE → G (allowed), D (allowed)  
- GLADE → G (allowed), D (allowed)  
- BLAME → B (allowed), M (M is banned) → invalid  
- BRADE → R banned → invalid  

Among the valid ones, “BLADE” is a common word and uses two fresh letters (B and D) that have not been ruled out.

Check BLADE against all constraints:
- B (pos 1): allowed  
- L (pos 2): ✓  
- A (pos 3): ✓  
- D (pos 4): allowed  
- E (pos 5): ✓  

No conflicts with any previous feedback.

So far we know:

- Pattern: _ L A _ E  
- Letters definitely absent: S, T, P, N, C, V, F, R, M, B, D  

That leaves very few consonants still allowed for positions 1 and 4:  
G, H, W, Y, K, etc.

We need a real 5-letter English word that fits _ L A _ E using only letters from the allowed set.  
Possible combinations:

- GLARE → R is banned → invalid  
- GLAZE → Z is uncommon but legal; A already placed → fits, but uncommon  
- GLADE → D is banned → invalid  
- GRAPE → P banned → invalid  
- H L A _ E → HLA_E – no common word  
- G L A _ E → G L A Z E (only real word left)

“GLAZE” is the only common word remaining that fits the pattern and uses only allowed letters.

Check each letter:
G (pos 1) – allowed  
L (pos 2) – ✓  
A (pos 3) – ✓  
Z (pos 4) – not yet ruled out  
E (pos 5) – ✓  

No conflicts.
