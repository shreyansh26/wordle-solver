### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. One such word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S: very common starting letter
- L, A, T, E: all among the most frequent letters in English
This will help me gather information about multiple letters in one guess.

From the two guesses so far:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - Word starts with S
   - L, T, E are not in the word
   - A is in the word but not in position 3

2. SHARK → S(✓) H(x) A(-) R(x) K(x)
   - H, R, K are not in the word
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (confirmed again)
   - S is still correct in position 1

So far we know:
- First letter: S
- Letters definitely absent: L, T, E, H, R, K
- Letter A is in the word, but not in position 3
- Remaining common letters not yet tested: D, G, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, containing A (but not in position 3), and using only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, or 5.

Let’s try placing A in position 2: S A _ _ _
But we need to check which letters are available. Common letters left: D, G, M, N, P, V, W, Y.

A good candidate is ""SANDB"" – but B hasn't been tested yet, and it's not common. Alternatively, ""SANDY"" – but Y is less common. ""SAPID"" – uses P, I, D. ""SAGGY"" – uses G twice. ""SAPPY"" – uses P, P, Y.

""SAPPY"" seems good because:
- Starts with S
- Has A in position 2 (allowed)
- Uses P, P, Y which are untested and common
- Doesn't use any ruled-out letters (L, T, E, H, R, K)

But ""SAPPY"" has two Ps – that's acceptable since letters can repeat if the word allows.

However, another option is ""SANDY"" – but D and Y are untested.

After considering, ""SAPPY"" seems like a strong test for P and Y.

But wait, let me think of a word with A in position 4: S _ _ A _
For example: ""SWASH"" – but H is ruled out. ""STASH"" – T is ruled out. ""SPASM"" – M is untested, P is untested, S is already known.

""SPASM"" uses S (already known), P, A (position 4), S, M. But S is already fixed in position 1, so this would be S P A S M. This uses P, A (position 4), S, M – but S is already in position 1, so this is acceptable.

But ""SPASM"" has S in position 4 – which is fine.

Alternatively, ""SNAKY"" – but K is ruled out. ""SNAIL"" – L is ruled out. ""SNARE"" – R, E are ruled out.

Let me try ""SUGAR"" – but R is ruled out. ""SOUND"" – but U is less common. ""STAND"" – T is ruled out.

""SAPPY"" seems better as it tests P and Y.

But actually, ""SAPPY"" has A in position 2, which is allowed.

However, let me think of a word with A in position 5: S _ _ _ A
For example: ""SWASH"" – H is ruled out. ""STASH"" – T is ruled out. ""SUGAR"" – R is ruled out. ""SALSA"" – L, S are ruled out/S is known.

""SAMBA"" – M, B, A (position 5). B is untested, M is untested. This seems good.

But ""SAMBA"" has B which is untested.

After evaluating, ""SAPPY"" and ""SAMBA"" are both good options. Between these, ""SAPPY"" tests P and Y, which are quite common.

But let me think of ""SANDY"" – S A N D Y – A is in position 2, uses N, D, Y.

This seems like a solid choice.

But to maximize information, perhaps ""SANDY"" is better as it tests N, D, Y.

However, ""SANDY"" has A in position 2, which is allowed.

After careful consideration, I'll go with ""SANDY"" as it tests three new common letters (N, D, Y) while maintaining the known constraints.

Based on the feedback:
- The word starts with S
- Contains A (not in position 3)
- Does not contain L, T, E, H, R, K

- Letters definitely absent: L, T, E, H, R, K
- Letter A is in the word, but not in position 3
- Remaining common letters not yet tested: D, G, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, containing A (but not in position 3), and using only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, or 5.

Let’s try placing A in position 2: S A _ _ _
But we need to check which letters are available. Common letters left: D, G, M, N, P, V, W, Y.

A good candidate is ""SANDB"" – but B hasn't been tested yet, and it's not common. Alternatively, ""SANDY"" – but Y is less common. ""SAPID"" – uses P, I, D. ""SAGGY"" – uses G twice. ""SAPPY"" – uses P, P, Y.

""SAPPY"" seems good because:
- Starts with S
- Has A in position 2 (allowed)
- Uses P, P, Y which are untested and common
- Doesn't use any ruled-out letters (L, T, E, H, R, K)

But ""SAPPY"" has two Ps – that's acceptable since letters can repeat if the word allows.

However, another option is ""SANDY"" – but D and Y are untested.

After considering, ""SAPPY"" seems like a strong test for P and Y.

But wait, let me think of a word with A in position 4: S _ _ A _
For example: ""SWASH"" – but H is ruled out. ""STASH"" – T is ruled out. ""SPASM"" – M is untested, P is untested, S is already known.

""SPASM"" uses S (already known), P, A (position 4), S, M. But S is already fixed in position 1, so this would be S P A S M. This uses P, A (position 4), S, M – but S is already in position 1, so this is acceptable.

But ""SPASM"" has S in position 4 – which is fine.

Alternatively, ""SNAKY"" – but K is ruled out. ""SNAIL"" – L is ruled out. ""SNARE"" – R, E are ruled out.

Let me try ""SUGAR"" – but R is ruled out. ""SOUND"" – but U is less common. ""STAND"" – T is ruled out.

""SAPPY"" seems better as it tests P and Y.

But actually, ""SAPPY"" has A in position 2, which is allowed.

However, let me think of a word with A in position 5: S _ _ _ A
For example: ""SWASH"" – H is ruled out. ""STASH"" – T is ruled out. ""SUGAR"" – R is ruled out. ""SALSA"" – L, S are ruled out/S is known.

""SAMBA"" – M, B, A (position 5). B is untested, M is untested. This seems good.

But ""SAMBA"" has B which is untested.

After evaluating, ""SAPPY"" and ""SAMBA"" are both good options. Between these, ""SAPPY"" tests P and Y, which are quite common.

But let me think of ""SANDY"" – S A N D Y – A is in position 2, uses N, D, Y.

This seems like a solid choice.

But to maximize information, perhaps ""SANDY"" is better as it tests N, D, Y.

However, ""SANDY"" has A in position 2, which is allowed.

After careful consideration, I'll go with ""SANDY"" as it tests three new common letters (N, D, Y) while maintaining the known constraints.Based on the feedback:
- The word starts with S
- Contains A (not in position 3)
- Does not contain L, T, E, H, R, K

I'll test a word that places A in position 2 and introduces new common letters N, D, and Y.

Current constraints:

- N is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- Letters definitely absent: L, T, E, H, R, K, D, Y
- Remaining common letters not yet tested: B, C, F, G, I, M, P, V, W, Z

We have the pattern: S A _ _ _

N must appear in position 4 or 5 (since it can't be in position 3).

Possible positions:

Looking at common 5-letter words starting with SA:

- S A C N _ (SCAN_ - SCANS is valid)
- S A _ N _ (SAUN_ - SAUNT is archaic, SAUNA is valid but has A twice)

Let's consider:
1. SCANS - uses C, S (already known), N in position 4, but has S twice (position 1 and 5) - acceptable
2. SAUNA - uses A twice (position 2 and 5) - acceptable, but has U which is untested
3. SABIN - uses B, I, N in position 5

Between these, SCANS seems good as it tests C and N in position 4.

But let me check SAUNA - it introduces U which is untested and common.

SABIN tests B and I.

I'll go with SAUNA as it tests U and places N in position 5 (which is allowed).
