### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. A common starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S, L, T (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)
- And a good mix of positions

However, another popular choice is ""CRANE"" or ""ADIEU"" for vowel-heavy starts. After considering these, I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's particularly good at testing vowels and common consonants in one guess.

From the feedback so far:
- Letters we know are NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, E, O, T, H
- Letters we know ARE in the word: M (correct position 1), U (somewhere in positions 2-5)
- U is in the word but not in position 3, so it must be in 2, 4, or 5.

We need a word that:
1. Starts with M (because M is ✓ in position 1)
2. Contains U but not in position 3
3. Uses only letters that have not been ruled out (no C, R, A, N, E, O, T, H)

Remaining common letters include: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, P, S, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s look for 5-letter words starting with M and containing U in positions 2, 4, or 5, using only the allowed letters.

Possible options:
- M _ U _ _ (U in 3 is invalid, so skip)
- M _ _ _ U (U in 5)
- _ M U _ _ (U in 3 is invalid, so skip)

So we need M _ _ _ U or M _ _ U _ (but U can't be in 3, so M _ _ U _ is okay if U is in 4).

Looking at common words:
- M _ _ _ U: ""MULCH"" - but C and H are excluded
- M _ _ U _: ""MUDGE"" - D and G are allowed, E is excluded
- M _ _ _ U: ""MUSIC"" - I, S, C - C excluded
- M _ _ U _: ""MULCT"" - C and T excluded
- M _ _ _ U: ""MURKY"" - K, Y allowed
- M _ _ _ U: ""MURDO"" - O excluded
- M _ _ _ U: ""MURDU"" - but ""MURDU"" isn't a common word
- M _ _ U _: ""MULGA"" - A excluded
- M _ _ _ U: ""MULCH"" - C and H excluded
- ""MULCT"" - C and T excluded
- ""MUSKY"" - S, K, Y allowed
- ""MURKY"" - U, R, K, Y - R excluded
- ""MULGA"" - A excluded
- ""MUSKY"" - S, K, Y allowed, but U is in position 2 (which is allowed)

""MUSKY"" seems valid:
- Starts with M
- Contains U in position 2 (allowed)
- Uses S, K, Y which are not excluded
- No excluded letters

But let me double-check:
Letters in MUSKY: M, U, S, K, Y
Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, T, H
These are all allowed.

So ""MUSKY"" is a good next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. A common starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S, L, T (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)
- And a good mix of positions

However, another popular choice is ""CRANE"" or ""ADIEU"" for vowel-heavy starts. After considering these, I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's particularly good at testing vowels and common consonants in one guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That means we can completely eliminate those letters from consideration.

A good second guess should:
1. Use entirely different letters (none of C,R,A,N,E).
2. Include common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain.

Popular remaining starting words include:
- SLATE (but T is less common)
- ADIOS (but O and S are okay)
- MOUTH (good consonant coverage)
- ILLUM (but U is repeated)

I’ll choose ""MOUTH"" because it covers:
- Three new consonants: M, O, U, T, H
- Two common vowels: O, U
- Good positional variety

From the feedback so far:
- Letters we know are NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, E, O, T, H
- Letters we know ARE in the word: M (correct position 1), U (somewhere in positions 2-5)
- U is in the word but not in position 3, so it must be in 2, 4, or 5.

We need a word that:
1. Starts with M (because M is ✓ in position 1)
2. Contains U but not in position 3
3. Uses only letters that have not been ruled out (no C, R, A, N, E, O, T, H)

Remaining common letters include: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, P, S, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s look for 5-letter words starting with M and containing U in positions 2, 4, or 5, using only the allowed letters.

Possible options:
- M _ U _ _ (U in 3 is invalid, so skip)
- M _ _ _ U (U in 5)
- _ M U _ _ (U in 3 is invalid, so skip)

So we need M _ _ _ U or M _ _ U _ (but U can't be in 3, so M _ _ U _ is okay if U is in 4).

Looking at common words:
- M _ _ _ U: ""MULCH"" - but C and H are excluded
- M _ _ U _: ""MUDGE"" - D and G are allowed, E is excluded
- M _ _ _ U: ""MUSIC"" - I, S, C - C excluded
- M _ _ U _: ""MULCT"" - C and T excluded
- M _ _ _ U: ""MURKY"" - K, Y allowed
- M _ _ _ U: ""MURDO"" - O excluded
- M _ _ _ U: ""MURDU"" - but ""MURDU"" isn't a common word
- M _ _ U _: ""MULGA"" - A excluded
- M _ _ _ U: ""MULCH"" - C and H excluded
- ""MULCT"" - C and T excluded
- ""MUSKY"" - S, K, Y allowed
- ""MURKY"" - U, R, K, Y - R excluded
- ""MULGA"" - A excluded
- ""MUSKY"" - S, K, Y allowed, but U is in position 2 (which is allowed)

""MUSKY"" seems valid:
- Starts with M
- Contains U in position 2 (allowed)
- Uses S, K, Y which are not excluded
- No excluded letters

But let me double-check:
Letters in MUSKY: M, U, S, K, Y
Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, T, H
These are all allowed.

So ""MUSKY"" is a good next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. A common starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S, L, T (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)
- And a good mix of positions

However, another popular choice is ""CRANE"" or ""ADIEU"" for vowel-heavy starts. After considering these, I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's particularly good at testing vowels and common consonants in one guess.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That means we can completely eliminate those letters from consideration.

A good second guess should:
1. Use entirely different letters (none of C,R,A,N,E).
2. Include common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain.

Popular remaining starting words include:
- SLATE (but T is less common)
- ADIOS (but O and S are okay)
- MOUTH (good consonant coverage)
- ILLUM (but U is repeated)

I’ll choose ""MOUTH"" because it covers:
- Three new consonants: M, O, U, T, H
- Two common vowels: O, U
- Good positional variety

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: MOUTH -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) O(x) U(-) T(x) H(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:
- Letters we know are NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, E, O, T, H
- Letters we know ARE in the word: M (correct position 1), U (somewhere in positions 2-5)
- U is in the word but not in position 3, so it must be in 2, 4, or 5.

We need a word that:
1. Starts with M (because M is ✓ in position 1)
2. Contains U but not in position 3
3. Uses only letters that have not been ruled out (no C, R, A, N, E, O, T, H)

Remaining common letters include: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, P, S, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s look for 5-letter words starting with M and containing U in positions 2, 4, or 5, using only the allowed letters.

Possible options:
- M _ U _ _ (U in 3 is invalid, so skip)
- M _ _ _ U (U in 5)
- _ M U _ _ (U in 3 is invalid, so skip)

So we need M _ _ _ U or M _ _ U _ (but U can't be in 3, so M _ _ U _ is okay if U is in 4).

Looking at common words:
- M _ _ _ U: ""MULCH"" - but C and H are excluded
- M _ _ U _: ""MUDGE"" - D and G are allowed, E is excluded
- M _ _ _ U: ""MUSIC"" - I, S, C - C excluded
- M _ _ U _: ""MULCT"" - C and T excluded
- M _ _ _ U: ""MURKY"" - K, Y allowed
- M _ _ _ U: ""MURDO"" - O excluded
- M _ _ _ U: ""MURDU"" - but ""MURDU"" isn't a common word
- M _ _ U _: ""MULGA"" - A excluded
- M _ _ _ U: ""MULCH"" - C and H excluded
- ""MULCT"" - C and T excluded
- ""MUSKY"" - S, K, Y allowed
- ""MURKY"" - U, R, K, Y - R excluded
- ""MULGA"" - A excluded
- ""MUSKY"" - S, K, Y allowed, but U is in position 2 (which is allowed)

""MUSKY"" seems valid:
- Starts with M
- Contains U in position 2 (allowed)
- Uses S, K, Y which are not excluded
- No excluded letters

But let me double-check:
Letters in MUSKY: M, U, S, K, Y
Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, T, H
These are all allowed.

So ""MUSKY"" is a good next guess.

Guess 3: MUSKY -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) U(✓) S(x) K(x) Y(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

1. Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, E, O, T, H, S, K  
   (every x-marked letter).

2. Letters we know ARE in the word and their positions:
   - M is in position 1 (✓)  
   - U is in position 2 (✓)  
   - Y is in position 5 (✓)

3. Therefore the pattern so far is:
   M U _ _ Y

4. Allowed letters left (not yet ruled out):
   B, D, F, G, I, J, L, P, V, W, X, Z, etc.

5. We need two more letters (positions 3 and 4) from the allowed set, forming a real 5-letter word.

6. Common English words that fit M U _ _ Y:
   - M U D D Y  (but D is repeated; also “MUDDY” is a valid word)
   - M U F F Y  (valid, but F is repeated)
   - M U L L Y  (valid, but L is repeated)
   - M U L C Y  (invalid, C is excluded)
   - M U F F Y, M U D D Y, M U L L Y are all valid, but they all repeat letters.
   - M U L L Y is the most common among these.

   Another option:
   - M U L L Y

   Let’s verify:
   Letters: M, U, L, L, Y — none of them are in the excluded list, and it matches the pattern M U _ _ Y.

   Therefore, “MULLY” is a good next guess.

From the feedback so far:

1. Letters NOT in the word (every x-marked letter):
   C, R, A, N, E, O, T, H, S, K, L

2. Letters we know ARE in the word and their fixed positions:
   - M is in position 1 (✓)
   - U is in position 2 (✓)
   - Y is in position 5 (✓)

   Therefore the pattern is:
   M U _ _ Y

3. Remaining allowed letters (not yet excluded):
   B, D, F, G, I, J, P, V, W, X, Z

4. We need two distinct letters for positions 3 and 4 from the allowed set, forming a valid English word.

5. Common 5-letter words that fit M U _ _ Y:
   - MUDDY (D, D) – D is allowed
   - MUFFY (F, F) – F is allowed
   - MUGGY (G, G) – G is allowed
   - MUMMY (M is already used in position 1, so M in position 4 would repeat; word is invalid because M is already fixed in position 1)
   - MULCH – invalid (C, L excluded)
   - MUFFY, MUDDY, MUGGY are all valid, but they all repeat letters.

6. Among these, MUFFY is the most common word.

Therefore, the next logical guess is MUFFY.
