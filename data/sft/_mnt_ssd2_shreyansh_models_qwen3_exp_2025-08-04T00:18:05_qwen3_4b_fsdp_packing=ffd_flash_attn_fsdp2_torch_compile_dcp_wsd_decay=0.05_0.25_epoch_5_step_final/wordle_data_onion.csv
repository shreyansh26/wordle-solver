### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L, T (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)
This combination gives us good coverage of the alphabet and should provide useful feedback for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That means the secret word contains none of: S, L, A, T, E.  
To maximize information in the second guess, I should pick a word that:
- Avoids S, L, A, T, E entirely
- Uses other very common consonants (R, N, C, D, P, M, etc.) and the remaining vowels (I, O, U)
- Still gives broad coverage

A balanced word that meets these criteria is “ROUND”:

From the feedback so far:

- Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D  
- Letters we know ARE in the word (but positions unknown): O, N

So the secret word must contain both O and N, and no other letters from the eliminated set.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both O and N
2. Uses only letters that have not been marked x yet
3. Keeps the known letters in positions where they were marked “-” (i.e., O cannot be in position 2 and N cannot be in position 4).

Remaining letters (excluding the eliminated ones):  
B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the confirmed letters O and N.

Let’s look for a word that places O and N in new positions while introducing fresh, still-allowed letters.

One candidate: “CHIMP”  
- C, H, I, M, P are all new letters.  
- It includes no eliminated letters.  
- O and N are not present, so this won’t confirm their correct positions.  
We need a word that actually uses O and N.

Another candidate: “CONCH”  
- C, O, N, C, H  
- Contains O and N, and H and C are new.  
- O is in position 2 (which was already marked “-” in position 2 in ROUND, so this is still valid for feedback).  
- N is in position 3 (new position).

Let’s go with CONCH.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L, T (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)
This combination gives us good coverage of the alphabet and should provide useful feedback for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That means the secret word contains none of: S, L, A, T, E.  
To maximize information in the second guess, I should pick a word that:
- Avoids S, L, A, T, E entirely
- Uses other very common consonants (R, N, C, D, P, M, etc.) and the remaining vowels (I, O, U)
- Still gives broad coverage

A balanced word that meets these criteria is “ROUND”:
- R, O, U, N, D are all still possible letters
- It includes two vowels (O, U) and three common consonants (R, N, D)
- All letters are distinct, maximizing information gain

From the feedback so far:

- Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D  
- Letters we know ARE in the word (but positions unknown): O, N

So the secret word must contain both O and N, and no other letters from the eliminated set.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both O and N
2. Uses only letters that have not been marked x yet
3. Keeps the known letters in positions where they were marked “-” (i.e., O cannot be in position 2 and N cannot be in position 4).

Remaining letters (excluding the eliminated ones):  
B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the confirmed letters O and N.

Let’s look for a word that places O and N in new positions while introducing fresh, still-allowed letters.

One candidate: “CHIMP”  
- C, H, I, M, P are all new letters.  
- It includes no eliminated letters.  
- O and N are not present, so this won’t confirm their correct positions.  
We need a word that actually uses O and N.

Another candidate: “CONCH”  
- C, O, N, C, H  
- Contains O and N, and H and C are new.  
- O is in position 2 (which was already marked “-” in position 2 in ROUND, so this is still valid for feedback).  
- N is in position 3 (new position).

Let’s go with CONCH.
