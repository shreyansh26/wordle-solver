For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use several of these. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. However, another popular choice is ""AROSE"" which covers A, R, O, S, E. 

Between these, ""AROSE"" might be slightly better because 'O' is a common vowel that appears in many words, and 'R' is very frequent. It also gives good coverage of different positions for these letters. 

After considering options like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", and ""ADIEU"", I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides a good balance of common consonants and vowels.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (x) → not in the word
- R (-) → in the word but not in position 2
- O (x) → not in the word
- S (x) → not in the word
- E (-) → in the word but not in position 5

So the secret word:
- Contains R and E (but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively)
- Does NOT contain A, O, or S

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has R somewhere (but not in position 2)
- Has E somewhere (but not in position 5)
- Does not contain A, O, or S

Let me think of possible candidates:
- ER...  (E not in 5th, R not in 2nd)
- R can be in 1st, 3rd, or 4th
- E can be in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th

Possible words:
- ENTRY (E in 1st, R in 2nd - but R can't be in 2nd from feedback)
- REN... (R in 1st, E in 2nd - valid)

- CRUEL (C, R, E, U, L - R in 2nd - invalid)
- DREAD (D, R, E, A, D - A is invalid)
- FRESH (F, R, E, S, H - S is invalid)
- TIGER (T, I, G, E, R - R in 5th - valid since R can be anywhere except 2nd)

Looking at these, ""ENTRY"" is invalid because R would be in position 2. ""RENCH"" might work but isn't a common word. ""PERKY"" seems like a good candidate - it has P, E, R, K, Y. R is in position 3 (valid), E is in position 2 (valid), and no forbidden letters (A, O, S).

Another good option is ""TIGER"" - R is in position 5 (valid), E is in position 4 (valid), and no forbidden letters.

Between PERKY and TIGER, TIGER is more common. I'll go with TIGER.

But wait - let me double-check:
- TIGER: T, I, G, E, R
- R is in position 5 (allowed, since feedback only said R is not in position 2)
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since feedback only said E is not in position 5)
- No A, O, S - correct

Yes, TIGER seems valid.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S
   - Letters IN the word but misplaced: R, E

2. TIGER → T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
   - E is now known to be in position 4 (✓)
   - R is now known to be in position 5 (✓)
   - T, I, G are NOT in the word

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ _ E R
- Cannot contain: A, O, S, T, I, G
- Still need to fill positions 1, 2, and 3 with letters not yet ruled out.

Remaining common letters (excluding the banned set): B, C, D, F, H, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need three consonants (or a consonant + vowel) for the first three positions. Let’s look for common 5-letter words ending in “-ER” that fit these constraints.

Possible candidates:
- BURER (B, U, R, E, R) – but R is already fixed in position 5, so this would have R in position 3 which conflicts.
- COWER – contains O (banned)
- FERER – not a valid word
- LIVER – contains I (banned)
- MERER – not valid
- PERER – not valid
- DOWER – contains O
- HOWER – contains O
- MOWER – contains O
- NEWER – not a standard word
- WIDER – contains I
- CIDER – contains I
- FIDER – contains I
- LIDER – contains I
- NIDER – contains I
- PIDER – contains I
- RIDER – contains I
- WIDER – contains I

Hmm, many “ER” words contain banned letters. Let’s try a different approach: build a word with the known pattern _ _ _ E R and letters not in the banned set.

Looking at position 1: possible consonants B, C, D, F, H, L, M, N, P, etc.
Position 2: same set
Position 3: same set, but must be a letter that forms a valid word.

Let’s try:
- B, U, D → B U D E R – not a word
- C, H, A → C H A E R – contains A (banned)
- C, H, E → C H E E R – contains E in position 3, but E is already in 4
- C, L, A → C L A E R – contains A
- D, U, M → D U M E R – not a word
- F, U, D → F U D E R – not a word
- L, U, D → L U D E R – not a word
- M, U, D → M U D E R – not a word
- N, E, W → N E W E R – not a word
- P, U, D → P U D E R – not a word

Let me reconsider: maybe position 3 doesn’t need to be a new letter; duplicates are allowed except for banned letters. We already have E and R fixed.

Looking at common words ending in “-ER” without banned letters:
- BURER – R conflicts
- COWER – O banned
- DOWER – O banned
- FERER – not valid
- LIVER – I banned
- MOWER – O banned
- NEWER – not standard
- PIVER – I banned
- ROWER – O banned
- SOWER – S banned
- TOWER – T banned
- WOWER – O banned
- YOWER – O banned

This is tricky. Let me think of other patterns. The banned letters are A, O, S, T, I, G. We need _ _ _ E R.

Another approach: use vowels U and/or Y in positions 1-3.

Possible words:
- U, N, D → U N D E R – valid word “UNDER”
   - Letters: U, N, D, E, R
   - E is in position 4 (✓)
   - R is in position 5 (✓)
   - U, N, D are not banned
   - No banned letters present

This seems perfect.

Let me verify:
- UNDER
- E in 4th: ✓
- R in 5th: ✓
- Letters: A, O, S, T, I, G – none of these are in UNDER
- Valid English word

Therefore, the next logical guess is UNDER.

2. TIGER → T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
   - E is now known to be in position 4 (✓)
   - R is now known to be in position 5 (✓)
   - T, I, G are NOT in the word

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ _ E R
- Cannot contain: A, O, S, T, I, G
- Still need to fill positions 1, 2, and 3 with letters not yet ruled out.

Remaining common letters (excluding the banned set): B, C, D, F, H, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need three consonants (or a consonant + vowel) for the first three positions. Let’s look for common 5-letter words ending in “-ER” that fit these constraints.

Possible candidates:
- BURER (B, U, R, E, R) – but R is already fixed in position 5, so this would have R in position 3 which conflicts.
- COWER – contains O (banned)
- FERER – not a valid word
- LIVER – contains I (banned)
- MERER – not valid
- PERER – not valid
- DOWER – contains O
- HOWER – contains O
- MOWER – contains O
- NEWER – not a standard word
- WIDER – contains I
- CIDER – contains I
- FIDER – contains I
- LIDER – contains I
- NIDER – contains I
- PIDER – contains I
- RIDER – contains I
- WIDER – contains I

Hmm, many “ER” words contain banned letters. Let’s try a different approach: build a word with the known pattern _ _ _ E R and letters not in the banned set.

Looking at position 1: possible consonants B, C, D, F, H, L, M, N, P, etc.
Position 2: same set
Position 3: same set, but must be a letter that forms a valid word.

Let’s try:
- B, U, D → B U D E R – not a word
- C, H, A → C H A E R – contains A (banned)
- C, H, E → C H E E R – contains E in position 3, but E is already in 4
- C, L, A → C L A E R – contains A
- D, U, M → D U M E R – not a word
- F, U, D → F U D E R – not a word
- L, U, D → L U D E R – not a word
- M, U, D → M U D E R – not a word
- N, E, W → N E W E R – not a word
- P, U, D → P U D E R – not a word

Let me reconsider: maybe position 3 doesn’t need to be a new letter; duplicates are allowed except for banned letters. We already have E and R fixed.

Looking at common words ending in “-ER” without banned letters:
- BURER – R conflicts
- COWER – O banned
- DOWER – O banned
- FERER – not valid
- LIVER – I banned
- MOWER – O banned
- NEWER – not standard
- PIVER – I banned
- ROWER – O banned
- SOWER – S banned
- TOWER – T banned
- WOWER – O banned
- YOWER – O banned

This is tricky. Let me think of other patterns. The banned letters are A, O, S, T, I, G. We need _ _ _ E R.

Another approach: use vowels U and/or Y in positions 1-3.

Possible words:
- U, N, D → U N D E R – valid word “UNDER”
   - Letters: U, N, D, E, R
   - E is in position 4 (✓)
   - R is in position 5 (✓)
   - U, N, D are not banned
   - No banned letters present

This seems perfect.

Let me verify:
- UNDER
- E in 4th: ✓
- R in 5th: ✓
- Letters: A, O, S, T, I, G – none of these are in UNDER
- Valid English word

Therefore, the next logical guess is UNDER.",Guess 3: UNDER -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(x) D(x) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use several of these. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. However, another popular choice is ""AROSE"" which covers A, R, O, S, E. 

Between these, ""AROSE"" might be slightly better because 'O' is a common vowel that appears in many words, and 'R' is very frequent. It also gives good coverage of different positions for these letters. 

After considering options like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", and ""ADIEU"", I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides a good balance of common consonants and vowels.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (x) → not in the word
- R (-) → in the word but not in position 2
- O (x) → not in the word
- S (x) → not in the word
- E (-) → in the word but not in position 5

So the secret word:
- Contains R and E (but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively)
- Does NOT contain A, O, or S

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has R somewhere (but not in position 2)
- Has E somewhere (but not in position 5)
- Does not contain A, O, or S

Let me think of possible candidates:
- ER...  (E not in 5th, R not in 2nd)
- R can be in 1st, 3rd, or 4th
- E can be in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th

Possible words:
- ENTRY (E in 1st, R in 2nd - but R can't be in 2nd from feedback)
- REN... (R in 1st, E in 2nd - valid)
- PERKY (P, E, R, K, Y - but R is in 3rd, E in 2nd - valid)
- CRUEL (C, R, E, U, L - R in 2nd - invalid)
- DREAD (D, R, E, A, D - A is invalid)
- FRESH (F, R, E, S, H - S is invalid)
- TIGER (T, I, G, E, R - R in 5th - valid since R can be anywhere except 2nd)

Looking at these, ""ENTRY"" is invalid because R would be in position 2. ""RENCH"" might work but isn't a common word. ""PERKY"" seems like a good candidate - it has P, E, R, K, Y. R is in position 3 (valid), E is in position 2 (valid), and no forbidden letters (A, O, S).

Another good option is ""TIGER"" - R is in position 5 (valid), E is in position 4 (valid), and no forbidden letters.

Between PERKY and TIGER, TIGER is more common. I'll go with TIGER.

But wait - let me double-check:
- TIGER: T, I, G, E, R
- R is in position 5 (allowed, since feedback only said R is not in position 2)
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since feedback only said E is not in position 5)
- No A, O, S - correct

Yes, TIGER seems valid.

   - Letters: U, N, D, E, R

""BUFER"" is actually not a standard English word. Let me check standard dictionaries.

Valid English words ending in ""ER"" with pattern _ _ _ E R and constraints:

- M U C E R – not valid
- P U L E R – not valid
- B U F E R – not valid (variant spelling, but not standard)

- C L A N E R – A and N banned
- C H A R G E – A and G banned
- F R O N T – doesn't fit

Looking again, ""CHUCKER"" is too long. Let me think of shorter valid words.

Valid words fitting _ _ _ E R with constraints:
- B U R E R – R duplicate allowed, but U must not be in 1 (valid)
- C H U E R – not valid
- F U N E R – N banned
- L U C E R – not valid
- M U C E R – not valid
- P U L E R – not valid
- C U R E R – valid (as in ""cure"" + r, but R already in 5)
- B U R E R – valid English word (a type of bird)

""Burer"" is actually not standard. Let me try:

Looking at standard dictionaries, ""CHUCKER"" isn't applicable. The correct approach is:

We need _ _ _ E R with U somewhere in 2 or 3, and letters from remaining set.

Valid word: ""F U N E R"" – N banned
""F L U E R"" – not valid
""C H U E R"" – not valid
""B U F E R"" – not valid
""B U R E R"" – not valid
""F L U E R"" – not valid

Realizing this, let me list possible combinations systematically:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Fixed:    _ _ _ E R
Letters allowed for 1,2,3: B, C, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, U, Y

Need U in 2 or 3.

Option 1: U in 2
Pattern: _ U _ E R
Possible first letters: B, C, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Third letter: same set, must form valid word.

Examples:
- B U _ E R: B U F E R – not valid
- C U _ E R: C U R E R – valid (as in ""cure"" + r, but R already in 5, so CURER is acceptable)
- F U _ E R: F U L E R – not valid
- H U _ E R: H U M E R – not valid
- L U _ E R: L U C E R – not valid
- M U _ E R: M U C E R – not valid

""Burer"" is actually not standard. Let me try:

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use several of these. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. However, another popular choice is ""AROSE"" which covers A, R, O, S, E. 

Between these, ""AROSE"" might be slightly better because 'O' is a common vowel that appears in many words, and 'R' is very frequent. It also gives good coverage of different positions for these letters. 

After considering options like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", and ""ADIEU"", I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides a good balance of common consonants and vowels.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (x) → not in the word
- R (-) → in the word but not in position 2
- O (x) → not in the word
- S (x) → not in the word
- E (-) → in the word but not in position 5

So the secret word:
- Contains R and E (but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively)
- Does NOT contain A, O, or S

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has R somewhere (but not in position 2)
- Has E somewhere (but not in position 5)
- Does not contain A, O, or S

Let me think of possible candidates:
- ER...  (E not in 5th, R not in 2nd)
- R can be in 1st, 3rd, or 4th
- E can be in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th

Possible words:
- ENTRY (E in 1st, R in 2nd - but R can't be in 2nd from feedback)
- REN... (R in 1st, E in 2nd - valid)
- PERKY (P, E, R, K, Y - but R is in 3rd, E in 2nd - valid)
- CRUEL (C, R, E, U, L - R in 2nd - invalid)
- DREAD (D, R, E, A, D - A is invalid)
- FRESH (F, R, E, S, H - S is invalid)
- TIGER (T, I, G, E, R - R in 5th - valid since R can be anywhere except 2nd)

Looking at these, ""ENTRY"" is invalid because R would be in position 2. ""RENCH"" might work but isn't a common word. ""PERKY"" seems like a good candidate - it has P, E, R, K, Y. R is in position 3 (valid), E is in position 2 (valid), and no forbidden letters (A, O, S).

Another good option is ""TIGER"" - R is in position 5 (valid), E is in position 4 (valid), and no forbidden letters.

Between PERKY and TIGER, TIGER is more common. I'll go with TIGER.

But wait - let me double-check:
- TIGER: T, I, G, E, R
- R is in position 5 (allowed, since feedback only said R is not in position 2)
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since feedback only said E is not in position 5)
- No A, O, S - correct

Yes, TIGER seems valid.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: TIGER -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S
   - Letters IN the word but misplaced: R, E

2. TIGER → T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
   - E is now known to be in position 4 (✓)
   - R is now known to be in position 5 (✓)
   - T, I, G are NOT in the word

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ _ E R
- Cannot contain: A, O, S, T, I, G
- Still need to fill positions 1, 2, and 3 with letters not yet ruled out.

Remaining common letters (excluding the banned set): B, C, D, F, H, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need three consonants (or a consonant + vowel) for the first three positions. Let’s look for common 5-letter words ending in “-ER” that fit these constraints.

Possible candidates:
- BURER (B, U, R, E, R) – but R is already fixed in position 5, so this would have R in position 3 which conflicts.
- COWER – contains O (banned)
- FERER – not a valid word
- LIVER – contains I (banned)
- MERER – not valid
- PERER – not valid
- DOWER – contains O
- HOWER – contains O
- MOWER – contains O
- NEWER – not a standard word
- WIDER – contains I
- CIDER – contains I
- FIDER – contains I
- LIDER – contains I
- NIDER – contains I
- PIDER – contains I
- RIDER – contains I
- WIDER – contains I

Hmm, many “ER” words contain banned letters. Let’s try a different approach: build a word with the known pattern _ _ _ E R and letters not in the banned set.

Looking at position 1: possible consonants B, C, D, F, H, L, M, N, P, etc.
Position 2: same set
Position 3: same set, but must be a letter that forms a valid word.

Let’s try:
- B, U, D → B U D E R – not a word
- C, H, A → C H A E R – contains A (banned)
- C, H, E → C H E E R – contains E in position 3, but E is already in 4
- C, L, A → C L A E R – contains A
- D, U, M → D U M E R – not a word
- F, U, D → F U D E R – not a word
- L, U, D → L U D E R – not a word
- M, U, D → M U D E R – not a word
- N, E, W → N E W E R – not a word
- P, U, D → P U D E R – not a word

Let me reconsider: maybe position 3 doesn’t need to be a new letter; duplicates are allowed except for banned letters. We already have E and R fixed.

Looking at common words ending in “-ER” without banned letters:
- BURER – R conflicts
- COWER – O banned
- DOWER – O banned
- FERER – not valid
- LIVER – I banned
- MOWER – O banned
- NEWER – not standard
- PIVER – I banned
- ROWER – O banned
- SOWER – S banned
- TOWER – T banned
- WOWER – O banned
- YOWER – O banned

This is tricky. Let me think of other patterns. The banned letters are A, O, S, T, I, G. We need _ _ _ E R.

Another approach: use vowels U and/or Y in positions 1-3.

Possible words:
- U, N, D → U N D E R – valid word “UNDER”
   - Letters: U, N, D, E, R
   - E is in position 4 (✓)
   - R is in position 5 (✓)
   - U, N, D are not banned
   - No banned letters present

This seems perfect.

Let me verify:
- UNDER
- E in 4th: ✓
- R in 5th: ✓
- Letters: A, O, S, T, I, G – none of these are in UNDER
- Valid English word

Therefore, the next logical guess is UNDER.

   – E and R positions confirmed  
   – B and L are NOT in the word  
   – U is in the word but NOT in position 3

So far the pattern is: _ _ U E R  (because U must appear and cannot be in 1 or 3, so it must be in 2)  
But we just learned U is also not in 3, which was already implied by the pattern _ _ U E R.  
Wait, the pattern is _ _ _ E R, and U must appear somewhere in positions 2 or 3 (since it can't be 1 or 4 or 5).  
But from BLUER feedback, U is not in 3, so U must be in position 2.

Hence the pattern is: _ U _ E R  
Letters still allowed for positions 1 and 3 (excluding banned: A, O, S, T, I, G, N, D, B, L):

Allowed letters: C, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, U, Y (but U is already in 2)

We need to pick a letter for position 1 and a letter for position 3 from the remaining set to form a valid English word.

Possible combinations:
- C U F E R – not valid
- C U M E R – ""CUMER"" not valid
- F U C E R – not valid
- H U M E R – not valid
- M U C E R – not valid
- P U C E R – not valid

- S P A R E – S and A banned
- L A R G E – A and L banned
- C L A N E R – A and N banned
- C H A R G E – A and G banned

Looking through, ""CURER"" is actually a valid English word (one who cures). It fits:
- C in 1, U in 2, R in 3, E in 4, R in 5  
- E and R positions match constraints  
- U is in position 2 (allowed)  
- No banned letters are used

Therefore, CURER is the logical next guess.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use several of these. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. However, another popular choice is ""AROSE"" which covers A, R, O, S, E. 

Between these, ""AROSE"" might be slightly better because 'O' is a common vowel that appears in many words, and 'R' is very frequent. It also gives good coverage of different positions for these letters. 

After considering options like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", and ""ADIEU"", I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides a good balance of common consonants and vowels.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (x) → not in the word
- R (-) → in the word but not in position 2
- O (x) → not in the word
- S (x) → not in the word
- E (-) → in the word but not in position 5

So the secret word:
- Contains R and E (but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively)
- Does NOT contain A, O, or S

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has R somewhere (but not in position 2)
- Has E somewhere (but not in position 5)
- Does not contain A, O, or S

Let me think of possible candidates:
- ER...  (E not in 5th, R not in 2nd)
- R can be in 1st, 3rd, or 4th
- E can be in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th

Possible words:
- ENTRY (E in 1st, R in 2nd - but R can't be in 2nd from feedback)
- REN... (R in 1st, E in 2nd - valid)
- PERKY (P, E, R, K, Y - but R is in 3rd, E in 2nd - valid)
- CRUEL (C, R, E, U, L - R in 2nd - invalid)
- DREAD (D, R, E, A, D - A is invalid)
- FRESH (F, R, E, S, H - S is invalid)
- TIGER (T, I, G, E, R - R in 5th - valid since R can be anywhere except 2nd)

Looking at these, ""ENTRY"" is invalid because R would be in position 2. ""RENCH"" might work but isn't a common word. ""PERKY"" seems like a good candidate - it has P, E, R, K, Y. R is in position 3 (valid), E is in position 2 (valid), and no forbidden letters (A, O, S).

Another good option is ""TIGER"" - R is in position 5 (valid), E is in position 4 (valid), and no forbidden letters.

Between PERKY and TIGER, TIGER is more common. I'll go with TIGER.

But wait - let me double-check:
- TIGER: T, I, G, E, R
- R is in position 5 (allowed, since feedback only said R is not in position 2)
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since feedback only said E is not in position 5)
- No A, O, S - correct

Yes, TIGER seems valid.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S
   - Letters IN the word but misplaced: R, E

2. TIGER → T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
   - E is now known to be in position 4 (✓)
   - R is now known to be in position 5 (✓)
   - T, I, G are NOT in the word

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ _ E R
- Cannot contain: A, O, S, T, I, G
- Still need to fill positions 1, 2, and 3 with letters not yet ruled out.

Remaining common letters (excluding the banned set): B, C, D, F, H, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need three consonants (or a consonant + vowel) for the first three positions. Let’s look for common 5-letter words ending in “-ER” that fit these constraints.

Possible candidates:
- BURER (B, U, R, E, R) – but R is already fixed in position 5, so this would have R in position 3 which conflicts.
- COWER – contains O (banned)
- FERER – not a valid word
- LIVER – contains I (banned)
- MERER – not valid
- PERER – not valid
- DOWER – contains O
- HOWER – contains O
- MOWER – contains O
- NEWER – not a standard word
- WIDER – contains I
- CIDER – contains I
- FIDER – contains I
- LIDER – contains I
- NIDER – contains I
- PIDER – contains I
- RIDER – contains I
- WIDER – contains I

Hmm, many “ER” words contain banned letters. Let’s try a different approach: build a word with the known pattern _ _ _ E R and letters not in the banned set.

Looking at position 1: possible consonants B, C, D, F, H, L, M, N, P, etc.
Position 2: same set
Position 3: same set, but must be a letter that forms a valid word.

Let’s try:
- B, U, D → B U D E R – not a word
- C, H, A → C H A E R – contains A (banned)
- C, H, E → C H E E R – contains E in position 3, but E is already in 4
- C, L, A → C L A E R – contains A
- D, U, M → D U M E R – not a word
- F, U, D → F U D E R – not a word
- L, U, D → L U D E R – not a word
- M, U, D → M U D E R – not a word
- N, E, W → N E W E R – not a word
- P, U, D → P U D E R – not a word

Let me reconsider: maybe position 3 doesn’t need to be a new letter; duplicates are allowed except for banned letters. We already have E and R fixed.

Looking at common words ending in “-ER” without banned letters:
- BURER – R conflicts
- COWER – O banned
- DOWER – O banned
- FERER – not valid
- LIVER – I banned
- MOWER – O banned
- NEWER – not standard
- PIVER – I banned
- ROWER – O banned
- SOWER – S banned
- TOWER – T banned
- WOWER – O banned
- YOWER – O banned

This is tricky. Let me think of other patterns. The banned letters are A, O, S, T, I, G. We need _ _ _ E R.

Another approach: use vowels U and/or Y in positions 1-3.

Possible words:
- U, N, D → U N D E R – valid word “UNDER”
   - Letters: U, N, D, E, R
   - E is in position 4 (✓)
   - R is in position 5 (✓)
   - U, N, D are not banned
   - No banned letters present

This seems perfect.

Let me verify:
- UNDER
- E in 4th: ✓
- R in 5th: ✓
- Letters: A, O, S, T, I, G – none of these are in UNDER
- Valid English word

   - Letters IN the word but misplaced: R, E

2. TIGER → T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
   - E is now fixed in position 4
   - R is fixed in position 5
   - T, I, G are NOT in the word

3. UNDER → U(-) N(x) D(x) E(✓) R(✓)
   - E and R positions confirmed as before
   - N and D are NOT in the word
   - U is in the word but NOT in position 1

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ _ E R
- Contains: U (but not in position 1)
- Excludes: A, O, S, T, I, G, N, D

Remaining possible letters for positions 1, 2, 3 (excluding banned and using U somewhere):
Consonants left: B, C, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels left: U, Y (since A, O, I are banned)

We need to place U in position 2 or 3 and fill the remaining spots with allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- B U _ E R: B, U, _ → B U F E R (contains F, allowed)
- C U _ E R: C U R E R (but R is already in 5, so CURER is invalid)
- F U _ E R: F U L E R (not a word)
- H U _ E R: H U M E R (not a word)
- L U _ E R: L U C E R (not a word)
- M U _ E R: M U C E R (not a word)
- P U _ E R: P U L E R (not a word)
- C _ U E R: C H U E R (not a word)
- F _ U E R: F L U E R (not a word)
- M _ U E R: M U D E R (D banned)
- B _ U E R: B U F E R – valid word

""BUFER"" is actually not a standard English word. Let me check standard dictionaries.

Valid English words ending in ""ER"" with pattern _ _ _ E R and constraints:
- C H U E R – not valid
- F L U E R – not valid
- L U C E R – not valid
- M U C E R – not valid
- P U L E R – not valid
- B U F E R – not valid (variant spelling, but not standard)
- C U R E R – invalid (R already in 5)
- F U L E R – not valid
- M U D E R – D banned
- W I D E R – I and D banned
- C O V E R – O banned
- F R O N T – doesn't fit pattern
- P R O W E R – O banned
- S P A R E – S and A banned
- L A R G E – A banned
- B I G E R – I banned
- C L A N E R – A and N banned
- C H A R G E – A and G banned
- F R O N T – doesn't fit

Looking again, ""CHUCKER"" is too long. Let me think of shorter valid words.

Valid words fitting _ _ _ E R with constraints:
- B U R E R – R duplicate allowed, but U must not be in 1 (valid)
- C H U E R – not valid
- F U N E R – N banned
- L U C E R – not valid
- M U C E R – not valid
- P U L E R – not valid
- C U R E R – valid (as in ""cure"" + r, but R already in 5)
- B U R E R – valid English word (a type of bird)

""Burer"" is actually not standard. Let me try:

Looking at standard dictionaries, ""CHUCKER"" isn't applicable. The correct approach is:

We need _ _ _ E R with U somewhere in 2 or 3, and letters from remaining set.

Valid word: ""F U N E R"" – N banned
""F L U E R"" – not valid
""C H U E R"" – not valid
""B U F E R"" – not valid
""B U R E R"" – not valid
""F L U E R"" – not valid

Realizing this, let me list possible combinations systematically:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Fixed:    _ _ _ E R
Letters allowed for 1,2,3: B, C, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, U, Y

Need U in 2 or 3.

Option 1: U in 2
Pattern: _ U _ E R
Possible first letters: B, C, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Third letter: same set, must form valid word.

Examples:
- B U _ E R: B U F E R – not valid
- C U _ E R: C U R E R – valid (as in ""cure"" + r, but R already in 5, so CURER is acceptable)
- F U _ E R: F U L E R – not valid
- H U _ E R: H U M E R – not valid
- L U _ E R: L U C E R – not valid
- M U _ E R: M U C E R – not valid
- P U _ E R: P U L E R – not valid
- Y U _ E R: Y U R E R – not valid

Option 2: U in 3
Pattern: _ _ U E R
Possible second letters: same set
First and third letters: same set

Examples:
- B _ U E R: B L U E R – valid word ""BLUER""
- C _ U E R: C H U E R – not valid
- F _ U E R: F L U E R – not valid
- L _ U E R: L I U E R – I banned
- M _ U E R: M U C E R – not valid
- P _ U E R: P U L E R – not valid
- Y _ U E R: Y O U E R – O banned

""BLUER"" is a valid English word (comparative of ""blue""), fits pattern _ _ U E R, and uses allowed letters.

Checking constraints:
- B, L, U, E, R
- E in 4: ✓
- R in 5: ✓
- U in 3: allowed (not in position 1)
- No banned letters (A, O, S, T, I, G, N, D)

Therefore, the next guess should be BLUER.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: TIGER -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Guess 3: UNDER -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(x) D(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Guess 4: BLUER -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(x) U(-) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the four rounds of feedback we now know:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   – Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S  
   – Letters IN the word but misplaced: R, E

2. TIGER → T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
   – E is fixed at position 4  
   – R is fixed at position 5  
   – T, I, G are NOT in the word

3. UNDER → U(-) N(x) D(x) E(✓) R(✓)
   – E and R positions confirmed  
   – N and D are NOT in the word  
   – U is in the word but NOT in position 1

4. BLUER → B(x) L(x) U(-) E(✓) R(✓)
   – E and R positions confirmed  
   – B and L are NOT in the word  
   – U is in the word but NOT in position 3

So far the pattern is: _ _ U E R  (because U must appear and cannot be in 1 or 3, so it must be in 2)  
But we just learned U is also not in 3, which was already implied by the pattern _ _ U E R.  
Wait, the pattern is _ _ _ E R, and U must appear somewhere in positions 2 or 3 (since it can't be 1 or 4 or 5).  
But from BLUER feedback, U is not in 3, so U must be in position 2.

Hence the pattern is: _ U _ E R  
Letters still allowed for positions 1 and 3 (excluding banned: A, O, S, T, I, G, N, D, B, L):

Allowed letters: C, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, U, Y (but U is already in 2)

We need to pick a letter for position 1 and a letter for position 3 from the remaining set to form a valid English word.

Possible combinations:
- C U F E R – not valid
- C U M E R – ""CUMER"" not valid
- F U C E R – not valid
- H U M E R – not valid
- M U C E R – not valid
- P U C E R – not valid
- C U R E R – valid (as in ""cure"" + r, but R already in 5, so CURER is acceptable)
- F U N E R – N banned
- W I D E R – I and D banned
- C O V E R – O banned
- F R O N T – doesn't fit pattern
- P R O W E R – O banned
- S P A R E – S and A banned
- L A R G E – A and L banned
- C L A N E R – A and N banned
- C H A R G E – A and G banned

Looking through, ""CURER"" is actually a valid English word (one who cures). It fits:
- C in 1, U in 2, R in 3, E in 4, R in 5  
- E and R positions match constraints  
- U is in position 2 (allowed)  
- No banned letters are used

Therefore, CURER is the logical next guess.

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use several of these. \n\nLooking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. However, another popular choice is ""AROSE"" which covers A, R, O, S, E. \n\nBetween these, ""AROSE"" might be slightly better because \'O\' is a common vowel that appears in many words, and \'R\' is very frequent. It also gives good coverage of different positions for these letters. \n\nAfter considering options like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", and ""ADIEU"", I\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides a good balance of common consonants and vowels.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A (x) → not in the word\n- R (-) → in the word but not in position 2\n- O (x) → not in the word\n- S (x) → not in the word\n- E (-) → in the word but not in position 5\n\nSo the secret word:\n- Contains R and E (but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively)\n- Does NOT contain A, O, or S\n\nI need a new 5-letter word that:\n- Has R somewhere (but not in position 2)\n- Has E somewhere (but not in position 5)\n- Does not contain A, O, or S\n\nLet me think of possible candidates:\n- ER...

From the five rounds we now have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)  
   – R, E are in the word but misplaced; A, O, S are not.

2. TIGER → T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)  
   – E is fixed at position 4; R is fixed at position 5; T, I, G are not in the word.

3. UNDER → U(-) N(x) D(x) E(✓) R(✓)  
   – N, D are not in the word; U is in the word but not in position 1; E and R positions confirmed.

4. BLUER → B(x) L(x) U(-) E(✓) R(✓)  
   – B, L are not in the word; U is in the word but not in position 3.

5. CURER → C(x) U(✓) R(-) E(✓) R(✓)  
   – U is now fixed at position 2; R is fixed at position 5; C is not in the word.  
   – The letter in position 3 is R but R is already fixed at position 5, so this must be a duplicate R (which is allowed).  
   – Therefore the word must be _ U R E R.

We now know the exact pattern: _ U R E R  
The only letter left to determine is the first letter.  
Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): All consonants except C, B, L, T, I, G, N, D, S, A, O.  
That leaves: F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form ? U R E R.

Possible valid words:
