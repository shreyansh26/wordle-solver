For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. A good starting word should ideally include several of these. 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. This gives us a good spread across the alphabet to see which letters might be in the secret word.

Another excellent choice is ""AROSE"" as it contains A, R, O, S, E - covering five of the most common letters. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's slightly more balanced in terms of vowel coverage and common consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- R (-) → in the word but not in position 2
- O (x) → not in the word
- S (-) → in the word but not in position 4
- E (-) → in the word but not in position 5

So the secret word contains the letters R, S, E but not A or O.  
We also know:

A good next guess should:
1. Keep the known letters R, S, E in new positions.
2. Introduce new common letters not yet tested (like T, N, L, I, etc.).
3. Avoid A and O.

A word that satisfies these constraints is “TRIES”:

From the two rounds of feedback:

Known letters that ARE in the word: R, S, E  
Known letters that are NOT in the word: A, O, T, I  

Positions still unknown for R, S, E:
- R cannot be in positions 2 (from AROSE) or 2 (from TRIES) → still cannot be in position 2.
- S cannot be in positions 4 (from AROSE) or 5 (from TRIES) → S must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (but 4 is excluded), so S must be in 1 or 3.
- E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE) or 4 (from TRIES) → E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- contains R, S, E in some permutation of positions 1-3 (since positions 4 and 5 are excluded for S and E)
- does NOT contain A, O, T, I
- introduces new common letters (possible candidates: N, L, C, D, U, etc.)

Possible structure: positions 1-3 must be a permutation of R, S, E, and positions 4-5 must be new letters.

Permutations of R, S, E in positions 1-3:
1. S R E
2. S E R
3. R S E
4. R E S
5. E S R
6. E R S

We need to pick one of these and fill positions 4-5 with new letters.

Let’s try permutation 3: R S E _ _

We need two new letters that are common and not yet used. Let’s pick N and D.

Word: R S E N D → “RSEND” – but this is not a valid English word.

Try permutation 1: S R E _ _

New letters: N and D → “SREND” – invalid.

Try permutation 4: R E S _ _

New letters: N and D → “RESDN” – invalid.

Try permutation 2: S E R _ _

New letters: N and D → “SERND” – invalid.

Try permutation 5: E S R _ _

New letters: N and D → “ESRND” – invalid.

Try permutation 6: E R S _ _

New letters: N and D → “ERSND” – invalid.

Hmm, none of these with N and D work. Let’s try permutation 3 (R S E) and new letters L and C.

Word: R S E L C → “RSEL C” – invalid.

Try permutation 1 (S R E) with L and C → “SRELC” – invalid.

Try permutation 4 (R E S) with L and C → “RESL C” – invalid.

Try permutation 2 (S E R) with L and C → “SERLC” – invalid.

Try permutation 5 (E S R) with L and C → “ESRL C” – invalid.

Try permutation 6 (E R S) with L and C → “ERSLC” – invalid.

None of these are valid English words. Let’s try a different approach: instead of putting R, S, E in positions 1-3, let’s look for actual English words that contain R, S, E and avoid forbidden letters.

Forbidden letters: A, O, T, I  
Must contain: R, S, E  
Possible positions for S: 1 or 3 (since 4 and 5 are excluded)  
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, or 3 (since 4 and 5 are excluded)  
Possible positions for R: 1, 3, or 4 (since 2 is excluded)  

Let’s list valid English words that meet these constraints:

- “SERFS” – contains S, E, R, F, S – but has S twice and S is already constrained.
- “REUSE” – contains R, E, U, S, E – but E is doubled and U is new.
- “PRESS” – contains P, R, E, S, S – S is doubled.
- “CRANE” – contains C, R, A, N, E – but A is forbidden.
- “CREST” – contains C, R, E, S, T – but T is forbidden.
- “CRISP” – contains C, R, I, S, P – but I is forbidden.
- “CREPE” – contains C, R, E, P, E – E is doubled.
- “REBES” – contains R, E, B, E, S – E is doubled.
- “RESEX” – contains R, E, S, E, X – E is doubled.
- “PRESS” – already considered.
- “BREED” – contains B, R, E, E, D – E is doubled.
- “CREST” – already considered.
- “GRISE” – contains G, R, I, S, E – I is forbidden.
- “DRISE” – contains D, R, I, S, E – I is forbidden.
- “PRISE” – contains P, R, I, S, E – I is forbidden.
- “VERSE” – contains V, E, R, S, E – E is doubled.
- “WRENS” – contains W, R, E, N, S – valid letters, no forbidden letters, and positions:
   - W (new)
   - R (position 2 – allowed, since only position 2 in AROSE was excluded for R, but TRIES also excluded position 2 for R, so R cannot be in position 2)
   - E (position 3 – allowed, since E cannot be in 4 or 5)
   - N (new)
   - S (position 5 – allowed, since S cannot be in 4 or 5 – wait, S cannot be in 5 (from TRIES), so S in 5 is invalid.

Let’s look for words where:
- S is in 1 or 3
- E is in 1, 2, or 3
- R is in 1, 3, or 4
- no A, O, T, I

Valid words:
- “SERFS” – S in 1, E in 2, R in 3 – but S is in 1 and 4, which is okay as long as S is not in 4 or 5. Here S is in 1 and 4 – 4 is excluded for S, so invalid.
- “REUSE” – R in 1, E in 2, S in 4 – S cannot be in 4, so invalid.
- “PRESS” – P in 1, R in 2 – R cannot be in 2, so invalid.
- “CRANE” – A is forbidden.
- “CREPE” – E is doubled.
- “REBES” – E is doubled.
- “CREST” – T is forbidden.
- “VERSE” – E is doubled.
- “WRENS” – S is in 5 – invalid.
- “FRESN” – not a word.
- “SNERE” – not a word.
- “SNARE” – A is forbidden.
- “SPREE” – P in 4, E in 5 – E cannot be in 5, so invalid.
- “SERUM” – U in 4, M in 5 – contains U and M, valid letters, positions:
   - S in 1 – allowed
   - E in 2 – allowed
   - R in 3 – allowed
   - U in 4 – new
   - M in 5 – new
   Letters: S, E, R, U, M – none forbidden.

This seems valid. Let’s check:
- Contains R, S, E – yes
- No A, O, T, I – yes
- S is in 1 – allowed (cannot be in 4 or 5)
- E is in 2 – allowed (cannot be in 4 or 5)
- R is in 3 – allowed (cannot be in 2)

This looks good.

None of these are valid English words. Let’s try a different approach: instead of putting R, S, E in positions 1-3, let’s look for actual English words that contain R, S, E and avoid forbidden letters.

Forbidden letters: A, O, T, I  
Must contain: R, S, E  
Possible positions for S: 1 or 3 (since 4 and 5 are excluded)  
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, or 3 (since 4 and 5 are excluded)  
Possible positions for R: 1, 3, or 4 (since 2 is excluded)  

Let’s list valid English words that meet these constraints:

- “SERFS” – contains S, E, R, F, S – but has S twice and S is already constrained.
- “REUSE” – contains R, E, U, S, E – but E is doubled and U is new.
- “PRESS” – contains P, R, E, S, S – S is doubled.
- “CRANE” – contains C, R, A, N, E – but A is forbidden.
- “CREST” – contains C, R, E, S, T – but T is forbidden.
- “CRISP” – contains C, R, I, S, P – but I is forbidden.
- “CREPE” – contains C, R, E, P, E – E is doubled.
- “REBES” – contains R, E, B, E, S – E is doubled.
- “RESEX” – contains R, E, S, E, X – E is doubled.
- “PRESS” – already considered.
- “BREED” – contains B, R, E, E, D – E is doubled.
- “CREST” – already considered.
- “GRISE” – contains G, R, I, S, E – I is forbidden.
- “DRISE” – contains D, R, I, S, E – I is forbidden.
- “PRISE” – contains P, R, I, S, E – I is forbidden.
- “VERSE” – contains V, E, R, S, E – E is doubled.
- “WRENS” – contains W, R, E, N, S – valid letters, no forbidden letters, and positions:
   - W (new)
   - R (position 2 – allowed, since only position 2 in AROSE was excluded for R, but TRIES also excluded position 2 for R, so R cannot be in position 2)
   - E (position 3 – allowed, since E cannot be in 4 or 5)
   - N (new)
   - S (position 5 – allowed, since S cannot be in 4 or 5 – wait, S cannot be in 5 (from TRIES), so S in 5 is invalid.

Let’s look for words where:
- S is in 1 or 3
- E is in 1, 2, or 3
- R is in 1, 3, or 4
- no A, O, T, I

Valid words:
- “SERFS” – S in 1, E in 2, R in 3 – but S is in 1 and 4, which is okay as long as S is not in 4 or 5. Here S is in 1 and 4 – 4 is excluded for S, so invalid.
- “REUSE” – R in 1, E in 2, S in 4 – S cannot be in 4, so invalid.
- “PRESS” – P in 1, R in 2 – R cannot be in 2, so invalid.
- “CRANE” – A is forbidden.
- “CREPE” – E is doubled.
- “REBES” – E is doubled.
- “CREST” – T is forbidden.
- “VERSE” – E is doubled.
- “WRENS” – S is in 5 – invalid.
- “FRESN” – not a word.
- “SNERE” – not a word.
- “SNARE” – A is forbidden.
- “SPREE” – P in 4, E in 5 – E cannot be in 5, so invalid.
- “SERUM” – U in 4, M in 5 – contains U and M, valid letters, positions:
   - S in 1 – allowed
   - E in 2 – allowed
   - R in 3 – allowed
   - U in 4 – new
   - M in 5 – new
   Letters: S, E, R, U, M – none forbidden.

This seems valid. Let’s check:
- Contains R, S, E – yes
- No A, O, T, I – yes
- S is in 1 – allowed (cannot be in 4 or 5)
- E is in 2 – allowed (cannot be in 4 or 5)
- R is in 3 – allowed (cannot be in 2)

This looks good.",Guess 3: SERUM -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) E(✓) R(✓) U(✓) M(✓),SUCCESS
