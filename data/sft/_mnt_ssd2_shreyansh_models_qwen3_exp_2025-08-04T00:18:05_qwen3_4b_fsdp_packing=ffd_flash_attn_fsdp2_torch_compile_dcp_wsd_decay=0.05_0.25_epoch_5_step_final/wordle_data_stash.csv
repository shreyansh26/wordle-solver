For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, T, N, L, S). The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage to gather information about the secret word.

1. Keeps S in position 1

3. Places T in position 2 (to test if T belongs there)
4. Uses new consonants for positions 4 and 5 to gather more info

A good candidate is “STAND”:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, T, N, L, S). The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage to gather information about the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 → word starts with S
- L is not in the word at all
- A is correct in position 3 → word has A in the middle
- T is in the word but not in position 4 → T must be in position 2 or 5
- E is not in the word

So far we know:
S _ A _ _  (with T possibly in position 2 or 5)

Let’s try a word that:
1. Keeps S in position 1
2. Keeps A in position 3
3. Places T in position 2 (to test if T belongs there)
4. Uses new consonants for positions 4 and 5 to gather more info

A good candidate is “STAND”:
- S stays in position 1
- T moves to position 2
- A stays in position 3
- N and D are new letters to test

This will help confirm where T belongs and test N and D.

From the new feedback on STAND:

- S is still correct in position 1 ✓
- T is now correct in position 2 ✓
- A is still correct in position 3 ✓
- N is not in the word x
- D is not in the word x

So the pattern is now: S T A _ _

We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5.  
We already know:
- L, E, N, D are not in the word (from both guesses)
- T is already used in position 2, so it won’t appear again

Let’s pick a word that:
1. Keeps STA in positions 1-3
2. Introduces two new, common letters for positions 4-5  
Good candidates: CR, CK, M, R, etc.

A strong choice is “STARK”:
- S T A R K  
R and K are new letters that haven’t been tested yet.

We now know the first three letters are **S T A** and the last two letters are **not** among:  
L, E, N, D, R, K, M, P  

We need two new letters for positions 4 and 5.  
Allowed letters (common ones left): B, C, F, G, H, V, W, Y, I, O, U  

Let’s try a word that fills those two slots with fresh, frequent letters.  
A good candidate is **STAC** + a new letter, but “STAC_” isn’t a common pattern.  
Instead, let’s try **STAV** + a letter—no 5-letter word “STAV_” is common.  
Another candidate: **STAW** + a letter—again, uncommon.  
Let’s pick **STAY** + a letter—still not 5 letters.  
Let’s list valid 5-letter words starting with “STA” and see which fit:  
- STAIN – N is out  
- STARK – R, K out  
- STAMP – M, P out  
- STAND – N, D out  
- STASH – H, S already used  
- STAYS – Y, S already used  
- STAGS – G, S already used  
- STAFF – F, F already used  
- STAGY – uncommon  
- STACO – uncommon  

The most common remaining word seems **STASH** (H and S), but S is already used.  
Let’s try **STAFF** – F and F.  
Another option is **STAGS** – G and S.  
But S is already used, so let’s pick **STAFF**.

However, **STAFF** has F in both 4 and 5, which is acceptable since duplicates are allowed and F hasn’t been ruled out.  
But let’s check if F is allowed – yes, it wasn’t in any previous feedback.  
So **STAFF** is a valid next guess.

But let’s look for a word with two different new letters.  
Another candidate: **STAVY** – not a word.  
**STAC** + a letter – no.  
**STAW** + a letter – no.  
**STAC** + **I** – “STACI” – not a word.  
**STAC** + **O** – “STACO” – not a word.  
Let’s try **STAV** + **E** – “STAVE” – E is out.  
**STAV** + **I** – “STAVI” – no.  
**STAV** + **Y** – “STAVY” – no.  

Let’s try **STAC** + **K** – K is out.  
Let’s try **STAC** + **R** – R is out.  
Let’s try **STAC** + **N** – N is out.  
Let’s try **STAC** + **D** – D is out.  
Let’s try **STAC** + **L** – L is out.  
Let’s try **STAC** + **E** – E is out.  
Let’s try **STAC** + **I** – “STACI” – no.  
Let’s try **STAC** + **O** – “STACO” – no.  
Let’s try **STAC** + **U** – “STACU” – no.  

Let’s try **STAF** + **F** – **STAFF** – valid word.  

Another option: **STAG** + **S** – **STAGS** – valid word.  

Between **STAFF** and **STAGS**, **STAFF** uses F twice, **STAGS** uses G and S (S already used).  
Let’s pick **STAFF**.

But let’s see if there’s a better word with two new letters.  
Another candidate: **STAC** + **I** – no.  
**STAC** + **K** – K out.  
**STAC** + **R** – R out.  
**STAC** + **N** – N out.  
**STAC** + **D** – D out.  
**STAC** + **L** – L out.  
**STAC** + **E** – E out.  
**STAC** + **I** – no.  
**STAC** + **O** – no.  
**STAC** + **U** – no.  

Let’s try **STAV** + **F** – “STAVF” – no.  
**STAV** + **G** – “STAVG” – no.  
**STAV** + **H** – “STAVH” – no.

**STA** + **C** + **W** – “STACW” – no.  
**STA** + **C** + **Y** – “STACY” – no.  

Let’s try **STA** + **F** + **F** – **STAFF** – valid word.  
Let’s try **STA** + **F** + **I** – “STAFF” – no, that’s same as STAFF.  
Let’s try **STA** + **G** + **G** – **STAGG** – no.  
Let’s try **STA** + **G** + **S** – **STAGS** – valid word.

Let’s try **STA** + **Y** + **Y** – **STAYY** – no.  

After careful consideration, the most reasonable next guesses are **STAFF** and **STAGS**.  
Let’s pick **STAFF**.

However, let’s note that **STAFF** uses F twice, and we have no information about F yet.  
But let’s also consider **STAGS** which uses G and S (S already used).  
Between these, **STAFF** seems slightly better as it introduces F twice.  

Therefore, the next guess is **STAFF**.
</think>

<guess>STAFF</guess>",STAFF,"We now know the first three letters are **S T A** and the last two letters are **not** among:  
L, E, N, D, R, K, M, P  

We need two new letters for positions 4 and 5.  
Allowed letters (common ones left): B, C, F, G, H, V, W, Y, I, O, U  

Let’s try a word that fills those two slots with fresh, frequent letters.  
A good candidate is **STAC** + a new letter, but “STAC_” isn’t a common pattern.  
Instead, let’s try **STAV** + a letter—no 5-letter word “STAV_” is common.  
Another candidate: **STAW** + a letter—again, uncommon.  
Let’s pick **STAY** + a letter—still not 5 letters.  
Let’s list valid 5-letter words starting with “STA” and see which fit:  
- STAIN – N is out  
- STARK – R, K out  
- STAMP – M, P out  
- STAND – N, D out  
- STASH – H, S already used  
- STAYS – Y, S already used  
- STAGS – G, S already used  
- STAFF – F, F already used  
- STAGY – uncommon  
- STACO – uncommon  

The most common remaining word seems **STASH** (H and S), but S is already used.  
Let’s try **STAFF** – F and F.  
Another option is **STAGS** – G and S.  
But S is already used, so let’s pick **STAFF**.

However, **STAFF** has F in both 4 and 5, which is acceptable since duplicates are allowed and F hasn’t been ruled out.  
But let’s check if F is allowed – yes, it wasn’t in any previous feedback.  
So **STAFF** is a valid next guess.

But let’s look for a word with two different new letters.  
Another candidate: **STAVY** – not a word.  
**STAC** + a letter – no.  
**STAW** + a letter – no.  
**STAC** + **I** – “STACI” – not a word.  
**STAC** + **O** – “STACO” – not a word.  
Let’s try **STAV** + **E** – “STAVE” – E is out.  
**STAV** + **I** – “STAVI” – no.  
**STAV** + **Y** – “STAVY” – no.  

Let’s try **STAC** + **K** – K is out.  
Let’s try **STAC** + **R** – R is out.  
Let’s try **STAC** + **N** – N is out.  
Let’s try **STAC** + **D** – D is out.  
Let’s try **STAC** + **L** – L is out.  
Let’s try **STAC** + **E** – E is out.  
Let’s try **STAC** + **I** – “STACI” – no.  
Let’s try **STAC** + **O** – “STACO” – no.  
Let’s try **STAC** + **U** – “STACU” – no.  

Let’s try **STAF** + **F** – **STAFF** – valid word.  

Another option: **STAG** + **S** – **STAGS** – valid word.  

Between **STAFF** and **STAGS**, **STAFF** uses F twice, **STAGS** uses G and S (S already used).  
Let’s pick **STAFF**.

But let’s see if there’s a better word with two new letters.  
Another candidate: **STAC** + **I** – no.

Let’s try **STA** + **G** + **S** – **STAGS** – valid word.

Let’s try **STA** + **W** + **Y** – “STAWY” – no.  

Let’s try **STA** + **Y** + **Y** – **STAYY** – no.  

After careful consideration, the most reasonable next guesses are **STAFF** and **STAGS**.  
Let’s pick **STAFF**.

However, let’s note that **STAFF** uses F twice, and we have no information about F yet.  
But let’s also consider **STAGS** which uses G and S (S already used).  
Between these, **STAFF** seems slightly better as it introduces F twice.  

Therefore, the next guess is **STAFF**.",Guess 5: STAFF -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) A(✓) F(x) F(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, T, N, L, S). The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage to gather information about the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 → word starts with S
- L is not in the word at all
- A is correct in position 3 → word has A in the middle
- T is in the word but not in position 4 → T must be in position 2 or 5
- E is not in the word

So far we know:
S _ A _ _  (with T possibly in position 2 or 5)

Let’s try a word that:
1. Keeps S in position 1
2. Keeps A in position 3
3. Places T in position 2 (to test if T belongs there)
4. Uses new consonants for positions 4 and 5 to gather more info

A good candidate is “STAND”:
- S stays in position 1
- T moves to position 2
- A stays in position 3
- N and D are new letters to test

This will help confirm where T belongs and test N and D.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STAND -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) A(✓) N(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on STAND:

- S is still correct in position 1 ✓
- T is now correct in position 2 ✓
- A is still correct in position 3 ✓
- N is not in the word x
- D is not in the word x

So the pattern is now: S T A _ _

We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5.  
We already know:
- L, E, N, D are not in the word (from both guesses)
- T is already used in position 2, so it won’t appear again

Let’s pick a word that:
1. Keeps STA in positions 1-3
2. Introduces two new, common letters for positions 4-5  
Good candidates: CR, CK, M, R, etc.

A strong choice is “STARK”:
- S T A R K  
R and K are new letters that haven’t been tested yet.

Current known pattern: S T A _ _

Letters already ruled out: L, E, N, D, R, K  
We need two new letters for positions 4 and 5.

Common unused consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Vowels left: I, O, U (A is already used in position 3)

Let’s try a word that uses two new consonants or a consonant plus a new vowel.
Good candidates: “STAC” + a new letter, but we need 5 letters.
Looking at common words: “STAIN” was ruled out (N is out), “STAMP” uses M and P.
“STAMP” is a valid word and uses two new letters (M, P).

Let’s check:
- S T A M P
- M and P haven’t been tested yet.

We now know the first three letters are **S T A** and the last two letters are **not** among:  
L, E, N, D, R, K, M, P  

We need two new letters for positions 4 and 5.  
Allowed letters (common ones left): B, C, F, G, H, V, W, Y, I, O, U  

Let’s try a word that fills those two slots with fresh, frequent letters.  
A good candidate is **STAC** + a new letter, but “STAC_” isn’t a common pattern.  
Instead, let’s try **STAV** + a letter—no 5-letter word “STAV_” is common.  
Another candidate: **STAW** + a letter—again, uncommon.  
Let’s pick **STAY** + a letter—still not 5 letters.  
Let’s list valid 5-letter words starting with “STA” and see which fit:  
- STAIN – N is out  
- STARK – R, K out  
- STAMP – M, P out  
- STAND – N, D out  
- STASH – H, S already used  
- STAYS – Y, S already used  
- STAGS – G, S already used  
- STAFF – F, F already used  
- STAGY – uncommon  
- STACO – uncommon  

The most common remaining word seems **STASH** (H and S), but S is already used.  
Let’s try **STAFF** – F and F.  
Another option is **STAGS** – G and S.  
But S is already used, so let’s pick **STAFF**.

However, **STAFF** has F in both 4 and 5, which is acceptable since duplicates are allowed and F hasn’t been ruled out.  
But let’s check if F is allowed – yes, it wasn’t in any previous feedback.  
So **STAFF** is a valid next guess.

But let’s look for a word with two different new letters.  
Another candidate: **STAVY** – not a word.  
**STAC** + a letter – no.  
**STAW** + a letter – no.  
**STAC** + **I** – “STACI” – not a word.  
**STAC** + **O** – “STACO” – not a word.  
Let’s try **STAV** + **E** – “STAVE” – E is out.  
**STAV** + **I** – “STAVI” – no.  
**STAV** + **Y** – “STAVY” – no.  

Let’s try **STAC** + **K** – K is out.  
Let’s try **STAC** + **R** – R is out.  
Let’s try **STAC** + **N** – N is out.  
Let’s try **STAC** + **D** – D is out.  
Let’s try **STAC** + **L** – L is out.  
Let’s try **STAC** + **E** – E is out.  
Let’s try **STAC** + **I** – “STACI” – no.  
Let’s try **STAC** + **O** – “STACO” – no.  
Let’s try **STAC** + **U** – “STACU” – no.  

Let’s try **STAF** + **F** – **STAFF** – valid word.  

Another option: **STAG** + **S** – **STAGS** – valid word.  

Between **STAFF** and **STAGS**, **STAFF** uses F twice, **STAGS** uses G and S (S already used).  
Let’s pick **STAFF**.

But let’s see if there’s a better word with two new letters.  
Another candidate: **STAC** + **I** – no.  
**STAC** + **K** – K out.  
**STAC** + **R** – R out.

Let’s try **STA** + **G** + **S** – **STAGS** – valid word.

Let’s try **STA** + **W** + **Y** – “STAWY” – no.  

Let’s try **STA** + **Y** + **Y** – **STAYY** – no.  

After careful consideration, the most reasonable next guesses are **STAFF** and **STAGS**.  
Let’s pick **STAFF**.

However, let’s note that **STAFF** uses F twice, and we have no information about F yet.  
But let’s also consider **STAGS** which uses G and S (S already used).  
Between these, **STAFF** seems slightly better as it introduces F twice.  

Therefore, the next guess is **STAFF**.

Current known pattern: S T A _ _

Letters already ruled out for positions 4 and 5:  
L, E, N, D, R, K, M, P, F

Remaining common letters: B, C, G, H, I, O, U, V, W, Y

We need two letters from this set to fill positions 4 and 5.  
Good candidates should form a common English word starting with STA.

Possible combinations:  
- STA + B + ? → STAB_ (needs 5th letter)  
- STA + C + ? → STAC_ (no common 5-letter words)  
- STA + G + ? → STAG_ (STAGS is valid)  
- STA + H + ? → STAH_ (no)  
- STA + I + ? → STA_I (no)  
- STA + O + ? → STA_O (no)  
- STA + V + ? → STAV_ (no)  
- STA + W + ? → STAW_ (no)  
- STA + Y + ? → STAY_ (STAY_ needs 5th letter)

Among the valid words:  
- STAGS (G and S) – but S is already used in position 2  
- STAY_ – no common 5-letter word ending here

The only common 5-letter word left that fits is **STAGS**, even though S is reused, because G hasn’t been ruled out yet.

Let’s check:  
S T A G S  
Positions 4 and 5: G and S  
Letters G and S: S is already known, but since it’s in position 5 (different from position 2), it’s allowed.

Therefore, the next guess is **STAGS**.
