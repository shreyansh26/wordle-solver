For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are:

- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (contains C, R, I, S, P)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly good because it includes two very common vowels (A, E), plus common consonants (C, R, N). This gives us good coverage to start narrowing down the possible letters in the secret word.

Let's go with CRANE as our first guess.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, E are NOT in the word (x).
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains N, but not in position 4.
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Includes N (but not in the 4th position).
2. Excludes C, R, A, E.

Let's think of words that fit this pattern. Common letters we haven't ruled out include S, T, L, I, O, U, D, etc. A good next guess should introduce new common letters to maximize information gain. 

One strong candidate is ""SOUND"":
- It includes N (in position 4, which is allowed since the previous N was in position 4 and was marked wrong position, so 4 is now excluded for N. Wait, actually the feedback said N is in the word but wrong position, meaning N is present but not in position 4. So position 4 is now excluded for N, but position 3 is still possible. Let me reconsider.)

Actually, the feedback for CRANE shows N is in the word but not in position 4. So N must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Let me think of a word that:
- Has N in one of positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.
- Does not have C, R, A, E.
- Introduces new common letters.

A good choice could be ""STONE"":
- S, T, O are new letters.
- N is in position 4, but the feedback said N is not in position 4. So this is invalid.

Next candidate: ""UNTIL""
- U, T, I, L are new letters.
- N is in position 1 (allowed).

This seems like a strong guess as it introduces four new common letters and places N in position 1.

Alternative: ""LINER"" - but R is excluded.
""DUNNO"" - has N in positions 3 and 4, but 4 is excluded for N.
""SNORT"" - has R and T, but R is excluded.

""UNTIL"" seems best as it avoids excluded letters and positions while introducing new ones.

   - N is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
   - T and L are not in the word.
   - I is in the word but in the wrong position.

So far we know:
- The word starts with U N _ _ _
- It contains I somewhere (but not in position 4)
- It does not contain C, R, A, E, T, L

We need a 5-letter word that:

- Uses only letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding C, R, A, E, T, L)

Possible letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to place I in either position 3 or 5 (since position 1 is U, position 2 is N, and position 4 is excluded for I).

Let's think of words that fit U N _ _ _ with I in position 3 or 5.

Examples:
- UNISP (but S is allowed)
- UNHIP (H, I, P are allowed)
- UNBID (B, I, D are allowed)
- UNGUI (G, I are allowed but this is not a valid word)
- UNPICK (but this is 6 letters)

""UNHIP"" seems like a valid word (meaning ""unhappy"" or ""unattached"") and fits all constraints:
- U N H I P
- Contains I in position 4, but wait - position 4 is excluded for I (from UNTIL feedback, I was in position 4 and marked wrong position). So I cannot be in position 4.

Re-evaluate:
- I must be in position 3 or 5.

Possible words:
- UNBID (I in position 3)
- UNPICK (invalid length)
- UNGRI (invalid)
- UNGUI (invalid)

""UNBID"" is a valid word meaning ""to refuse to sell at an offer"".
- U N B I D

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are:

- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (contains C, R, I, S, P)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly good because it includes two very common vowels (A, E), plus common consonants (C, R, N). This gives us good coverage to start narrowing down the possible letters in the secret word.

Let's go with CRANE as our first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, E are NOT in the word (x).
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains N, but not in position 4.
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Includes N (but not in the 4th position).
2. Excludes C, R, A, E.

Let's think of words that fit this pattern. Common letters we haven't ruled out include S, T, L, I, O, U, D, etc. A good next guess should introduce new common letters to maximize information gain. 

One strong candidate is ""SOUND"":
- It includes N (in position 4, which is allowed since the previous N was in position 4 and was marked wrong position, so 4 is now excluded for N. Wait, actually the feedback said N is in the word but wrong position, meaning N is present but not in position 4. So position 4 is now excluded for N, but position 3 is still possible. Let me reconsider.)

Actually, the feedback for CRANE shows N is in the word but not in position 4. So N must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Let me think of a word that:
- Has N in one of positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.
- Does not have C, R, A, E.
- Introduces new common letters.

A good choice could be ""STONE"":
- S, T, O are new letters.
- N is in position 4, but the feedback said N is not in position 4. So this is invalid.

Next candidate: ""UNTIL""
- U, T, I, L are new letters.
- N is in position 1 (allowed).

This seems like a strong guess as it introduces four new common letters and places N in position 1.

Alternative: ""LINER"" - but R is excluded.
""DUNNO"" - has N in positions 3 and 4, but 4 is excluded for N.
""SNORT"" - has R and T, but R is excluded.

""UNTIL"" seems best as it avoids excluded letters and positions while introducing new ones.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(✓) N(✓) T(x) I(-) L(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
   - Letters not in the word: C, R, A, E
   - Letter N is in the word but not in position 4.

2. UNTIL → U(✓) N(✓) T(x) I(-) L(x)
   - U is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
   - N is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
   - T and L are not in the word.
   - I is in the word but in the wrong position.

So far we know:
- The word starts with U N _ _ _
- It contains I somewhere (but not in position 4)
- It does not contain C, R, A, E, T, L

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Begins with U N
- Contains I (but not in position 4)
- Uses only letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding C, R, A, E, T, L)

Possible letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to place I in either position 3 or 5 (since position 1 is U, position 2 is N, and position 4 is excluded for I).

Let's think of words that fit U N _ _ _ with I in position 3 or 5.

Examples:
- UNISP (but S is allowed)
- UNHIP (H, I, P are allowed)
- UNBID (B, I, D are allowed)
- UNGUI (G, I are allowed but this is not a valid word)
- UNPICK (but this is 6 letters)

Valid words:
- UNHIP
- UNBID
- UNPICK (invalid length)
- UNGUI (invalid)
- UNTIL (already used)

""UNHIP"" seems like a valid word (meaning ""unhappy"" or ""unattached"") and fits all constraints:
- U N H I P
- Contains I in position 4, but wait - position 4 is excluded for I (from UNTIL feedback, I was in position 4 and marked wrong position). So I cannot be in position 4.

Re-evaluate:
- I must be in position 3 or 5.

Possible words:
- UNBID (I in position 3)
- UNPICK (invalid length)
- UNGRI (invalid)
- UNGUI (invalid)

""UNBID"" is a valid word meaning ""to refuse to sell at an offer"".
- U N B I D
- I is in position 3 (allowed)
- Letters used: U, N, B, I, D - none of which are excluded except D is allowed.

This seems like the best next guess.

Current known facts:

1. Word pattern: U N _ _ _
2. Letters not in the word: C, R, A, E, T, L, B, D
3. Letter I is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (from both UNTIL and UNBID feedback).
4. Therefore, I must be in position 5 (the only remaining spot).

So the word is U N _ _ I.

Remaining usable letters (excluding all eliminated ones):  
F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need two more letters to fill positions 3 and 4, chosen from the above set.

Possible valid English words fitting U N _ _ I:

- UNFHI (invalid)
- UNGMI (invalid)
- UNHPI (invalid)
- UNKPI (invalid)
- UNMPI (invalid)
- UNSPI (invalid)
- UNVWI (invalid)
- UNXBI (invalid)
- UNYPI (invalid)
- UNGUI (invalid)
- UNFMI (invalid)

Wait, let’s list real words:

- UNHIP (I in position 4 – invalid, already ruled out)
- UNGUI (invalid)
- UNFMI (invalid)
- UNHPI (invalid)
- UNKPI (invalid)
- UNMPI (invalid)
- UNSPI (invalid)
- UNVWI (invalid)
- UNXBI (invalid)
- UNYPI (invalid)

Hmm, none of these are valid. Let’s reconsider – perhaps I overlooked some.

Actually, the only valid English word fitting U N _ _ I with remaining letters is:

- U N S P I → “UNSPI” (not a word)
- U N G U I → “UNGUI” (invalid)
- U N H I P → “UNHIP” (I in position 4 – invalid)

Wait, let’s list all possible combinations systematically.

Possible letters for positions 3 and 4: F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to find real 5-letter words of the form U N ? ? I.

Real words:

- U N G U I (invalid)
- U N S P I (invalid)
- U N H I P (invalid, I in 4)
- U N G I F (invalid)
- U N F I N (invalid)
- U N G I N (invalid)

Actually, the only valid English word that fits U N _ _ I with the remaining letters is:

- U N G U I – but this is not a valid English word.

Wait, let’s think differently – perhaps the word is “UNHIP”, but I is in position 4, which was ruled out by UNTIL feedback.

This suggests I may have made an error in tracking I’s position.

Re-examining:

From UNTIL (U N T I L) feedback:
- I was in position 4 and was marked “-”, meaning I is in the word but NOT in position 4.

From UNBID (U N B I D) feedback:
- I was in position 4 again and was marked “-”, confirming I is NOT in position 4.

Therefore, I must be in position 3 (the only other possible spot in U N _ _ _).

So the pattern is U N I _ _.

Now we need letters for positions 4 and 5, excluding all eliminated letters (C, R, A, E, T, L, B, D).

Remaining letters: F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z

The only valid word is U N I F Y.
