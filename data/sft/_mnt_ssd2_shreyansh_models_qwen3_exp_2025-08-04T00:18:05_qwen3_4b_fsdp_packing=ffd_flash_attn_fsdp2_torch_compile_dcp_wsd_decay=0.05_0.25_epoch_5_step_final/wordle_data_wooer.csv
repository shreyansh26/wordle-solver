### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. ""AROSE"" is a popular starting word because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters

This gives us maximum information about which letters are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on “arose”:

- A(x) → A is not in the word.  
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.  
- O(✓) → O is in the word and in position 3.  
- S(x) → S is not in the word.  
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word has the pattern _ _ O _ _ (with O fixed in position 3).  
- It contains R and E somewhere, but R ≠ 2 and E ≠ 5.  
- Letters not in the word: A, S.

I want a new guess that keeps O in position 3, introduces new common letters, and places R and E in new possible spots. A good candidate is “ROUTE”:

- O is already in position 3, so that’s confirmed.  
- R is now in position 1 (allowed, since R was only forbidden in position 2).  
- E is now in position 5 (but E was marked as “-”, meaning it can’t be in position 5). Oops, that conflicts. So ROUTE is invalid because E can’t be in position 5.

Next candidate: “TROPE”  
- O in position 3 is good.  
- R in position 2 is disallowed (R was “-” in position 2). So TROPE is invalid.

Next: “GROPE”  
- R in position 2 is disallowed.

Next: “CRORE” – repeats R, and R is already known to be in the word only once (since it’s marked “-” not “✓”), so duplicates are unlikely.

Next: “BROKE”  
- O in position 3 is good.  
- R in position 2 is disallowed.

Next: “DROVE”  
- O in position 3 is good.  
- R in position 2 is disallowed.

Next: “FROZE”  
- O in position 3 is good.  
- R in position 2 is disallowed.

Next: “MORSE” – S is already out.

Next: “WORSE” – S is out.

Next: “HORSE” – S is out.

Next: “POKER” – O in position 3 is good, R in position 5 is allowed (R was only disallowed in position 2). E is in position 4, which is allowed (E was only disallowed in position 5). New letters introduced: P, K.

So POKER seems valid and informative.

Another candidate: “ROGER” – R repeats and R is disallowed in position 2.

Another: “BORED” – O in position 3 is good. R in position 2 is disallowed.

Another: “CORED” – R in position 2 is disallowed.

Another: “GORED” – R in position 2 is disallowed.

Another: “FOCAL” – O is not in position 3.

So POKER seems best: keeps O in position 3, places R in position 1 (new spot), E in position 4 (new spot), and introduces P and K.

2. Letters already ruled out: A, S, P, K.

4. We still need to test which of these pairs fits the pattern and hasn’t been eliminated.

- B O E R → “boe r” not a word.
- C O E R → “coer” not a word.
- D O E R → “doer” (valid).
- F O E R → “foer” not a word.
- G O E R → “goer” (valid).
- H O E R → “hoer” uncommon/dialect.
- M O E R → “moer” not standard.
- N O E R → “noer” dialect.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:

- A(x) → A is not in the word.  
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.  
- O(✓) → O is in the word and in position 3.  
- S(x) → S is not in the word.  
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word has the pattern _ _ O _ _ (with O fixed in position 3).  
- It contains R and E somewhere, but R ≠ 2 and E ≠ 5.  
- Letters not in the word: A, S.

I want a new guess that keeps O in position 3, introduces new common letters, and places R and E in new possible spots. A good candidate is “ROUTE”:

- O is already in position 3, so that’s confirmed.  
- R is now in position 1 (allowed, since R was only forbidden in position 2).  
- E is now in position 5 (but E was marked as “-”, meaning it can’t be in position 5). Oops, that conflicts. So ROUTE is invalid because E can’t be in position 5.

Next candidate: “TROPE”  
- O in position 3 is good.  
- R in position 2 is disallowed (R was “-” in position 2). So TROPE is invalid.

Next: “GROPE”  
- R in position 2 is disallowed.

Next: “CRORE” – repeats R, and R is already known to be in the word only once (since it’s marked “-” not “✓”), so duplicates are unlikely.

Next: “BROKE”  
- O in position 3 is good.  
- R in position 2 is disallowed.

Next: “DROVE”  
- O in position 3 is good.  
- R in position 2 is disallowed.

Next: “FROZE”  
- O in position 3 is good.  
- R in position 2 is disallowed.

Next: “MORSE” – S is already out.

Next: “WORSE” – S is out.

Next: “HORSE” – S is out.

Next: “POKER” – O in position 3 is good, R in position 5 is allowed (R was only disallowed in position 2). E is in position 4, which is allowed (E was only disallowed in position 5). New letters introduced: P, K.

So POKER seems valid and informative.

Another candidate: “ROGER” – R repeats and R is disallowed in position 2.

Another: “BORED” – O in position 3 is good. R in position 2 is disallowed.

Another: “CORED” – R in position 2 is disallowed.

Another: “GORED” – R in position 2 is disallowed.

Another: “FOCAL” – O is not in position 3.

So POKER seems best: keeps O in position 3, places R in position 1 (new spot), E in position 4 (new spot), and introduces P and K.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: poker -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) K(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Pattern so far: _ _ O E R  
   (O is fixed in position 3, E in position 4, R in position 5).

2. Letters already ruled out: A, S, P, K.

3. Therefore the first two letters must be chosen from the remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, T, V, W, Y, etc.

4. We still need to test which of these pairs fits the pattern and hasn’t been eliminated.

Quick scan of common 5-letter words ending in “OER”:
- B O E R → “boe r” not a word.
- C O E R → “coer” not a word.
- D O E R → “doer” (valid).
- F O E R → “foer” not a word.
- G O E R → “goer” (valid).
- H O E R → “hoer” uncommon/dialect.
- M O E R → “moer” not standard.
- N O E R → “noer” dialect.

Top candidates: “doer”, “goer”.

Check “doer” first; it uses D and O (O already known), E, R already known. All letters D, O, E, R are consistent so far.

Hence: “doer” is the logical next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. ""AROSE"" is a popular starting word because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters

This gives us maximum information about which letters are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on “arose”:

- The word has the pattern _ _ O _ _ (with O fixed in position 3).  
- It contains R and E somewhere, but R ≠ 2 and E ≠ 5.  
- Letters not in the word: A, S.

I want a new guess that keeps O in position 3, introduces new common letters, and places R and E in new possible spots. A good candidate is “ROUTE”:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. ""AROSE"" is a popular starting word because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters

This gives us maximum information about which letters are present in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:

- A(x) → A is not in the word.  
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.  
- O(✓) → O is in the word and in position 3.  
- S(x) → S is not in the word.  
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word has the pattern _ _ O _ _ (with O fixed in position 3).  
- It contains R and E somewhere, but R ≠ 2 and E ≠ 5.  
- Letters not in the word: A, S.

I want a new guess that keeps O in position 3, introduces new common letters, and places R and E in new possible spots. A good candidate is “ROUTE”:

- O is already in position 3, so that’s confirmed.  
- R is now in position 1 (allowed, since R was only forbidden in position 2).  
- E is now in position 5 (but E was marked as “-”, meaning it can’t be in position 5). Oops, that conflicts. So ROUTE is invalid because E can’t be in position 5.

Next candidate: “TROPE”  
- O in position 3 is good.  
- R in position 2 is disallowed (R was “-” in position 2). So TROPE is invalid.

Next: “GROPE”  
- R in position 2 is disallowed.

Next: “CRORE” – repeats R, and R is already known to be in the word only once (since it’s marked “-” not “✓”), so duplicates are unlikely.

Next: “BROKE”  
- O in position 3 is good.  
- R in position 2 is disallowed.

Next: “DROVE”  
- O in position 3 is good.  
- R in position 2 is disallowed.

Next: “FROZE”  
- O in position 3 is good.  
- R in position 2 is disallowed.

Next: “MORSE” – S is already out.

Next: “WORSE” – S is out.

Next: “HORSE” – S is out.

Next: “POKER” – O in position 3 is good, R in position 5 is allowed (R was only disallowed in position 2). E is in position 4, which is allowed (E was only disallowed in position 5). New letters introduced: P, K.

So POKER seems valid and informative.

Another candidate: “ROGER” – R repeats and R is disallowed in position 2.

Another: “BORED” – O in position 3 is good. R in position 2 is disallowed.

Another: “CORED” – R in position 2 is disallowed.

Another: “GORED” – R in position 2 is disallowed.

Another: “FOCAL” – O is not in position 3.

So POKER seems best: keeps O in position 3, places R in position 1 (new spot), E in position 4 (new spot), and introduces P and K.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Pattern so far: _ _ O E R  
   (O is fixed in position 3, E in position 4, R in position 5).

2. Letters already ruled out: A, S, P, K.

3. Therefore the first two letters must be chosen from the remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, T, V, W, Y, etc.

4. We still need to test which of these pairs fits the pattern and hasn’t been eliminated.

Quick scan of common 5-letter words ending in “OER”:
- B O E R → “boe r” not a word.
- C O E R → “coer” not a word.
- D O E R → “doer” (valid).
- F O E R → “foer” not a word.
- G O E R → “goer” (valid).
- H O E R → “hoer” uncommon/dialect.
- M O E R → “moer” not standard.
- N O E R → “noer” dialect.

Top candidates: “doer”, “goer”.

Check “doer” first; it uses D and O (O already known), E, R already known. All letters D, O, E, R are consistent so far.

Hence: “doer” is the logical next guess.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The feedback on Guess 3 (“doer”) says the model answer is not five letters, so “doer” is not a valid 5-letter word in this context.  
I must pick a different 5-letter word that still ends in “O E R” and uses letters not yet ruled out.

Letters ruled out so far: A, S, P, K.  
Letters confirmed: O (position 3), E (position 4), R (position 5).  
Letters still available for positions 1 and 2: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, T, V, W, Y, etc.

Common 5-letter words ending in “O E R”:
- B O E R → “boer” (valid, though rare)
- C O E R → “coer” (not a word)
- D O E R → “doer” (already rejected)
- F O E R → “foer” (not a word)
- G O E R → “goer” (valid)
- H O E R → “hoer” (rare/dialect)
- M O E R → “moer” (not standard)
- N O E R → “noer” (rare/dialect)

Best remaining options: “boer” and “goer”.  
“Goer” is more common, so I’ll try it next.

(If “goer” is also rejected, I’ll move to “boer” or check other possibilities.)
