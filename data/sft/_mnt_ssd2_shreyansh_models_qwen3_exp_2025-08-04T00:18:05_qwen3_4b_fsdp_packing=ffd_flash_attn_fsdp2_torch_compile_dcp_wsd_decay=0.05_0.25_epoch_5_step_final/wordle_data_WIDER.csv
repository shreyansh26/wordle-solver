### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. 

The letters E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C are among the most common in English words. I'll try to include as many of these as possible in my first guess.

Looking at these letters, a strong combination is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This word uses five of the most common letters and should give me good information about which letters are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word at all.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So the secret word:
- Contains R and E (but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively).
- Does NOT contain A, O, or S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses R and E somewhere other than position 2 for R and position 5 for E.
2. Avoids A, O, S entirely.
3. Uses common remaining letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, P, M, Y, etc.

Let’s try a word that places R in position 1, 3, or 4 and E in position 1, 3, 4, or 2 (since E can’t be 5th). A good candidate is ""TREND"":
- T is common.
- R is in position 2 (but feedback said R is not in position 2), so that’s bad. Let’s avoid R in position 2.

Another candidate: ""CRANE"" – but A is forbidden.

Next: ""RINSE"" – S is forbidden.

Next: ""ENTRY"":
- E is 1st (allowed, since E only can’t be 5th).
- N, T, R are new letters.
- Y is a common ending.

But R is 4th here; position 4 is fine (only position 2 was ruled out for R).

Let’s go with ENTRY to test E in 1st, R in 4th, and introduce N, T, Y.
