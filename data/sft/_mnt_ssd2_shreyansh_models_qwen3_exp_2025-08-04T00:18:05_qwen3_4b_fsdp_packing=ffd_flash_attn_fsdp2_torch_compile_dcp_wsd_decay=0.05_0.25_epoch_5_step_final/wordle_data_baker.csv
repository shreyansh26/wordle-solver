### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting strategies include using vowels and frequently appearing consonants. A good first guess often contains multiple vowels and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N, etc. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination covers a good range of letters that appear frequently in English words, which should provide useful feedback for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

A good candidate is “CRANE”:
- C, R, N are common consonants we haven’t ruled out  
- A and E are moved to new positions (2 and 4)  
- No S, L, or T  

This should help determine where A and E go, plus test C, R, N.

   – Eliminated letters: D, P (added to S, L, T, C, N)

So we know:
- The word must contain A, R, E exactly once each.  
- The word must NOT contain S, L, T, C, N, D, P.  
- Positions ruled out so far:
  – A cannot be 3  
  – R cannot be 2 or 3  
  – E cannot be 5  

Remaining allowed letters (common ones): B, F, G, H, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus repeats if needed, but we already have A, R, E.

We need a 5-letter word with A, R, E and two new letters from the allowed set, arranged so that:
- A is in 1,2,4, or 5  
- R is in 1,4, or 5 (cannot be 2 or 3)  
- E is in 1,2,3, or 4  

Let’s pick two new consonants: let’s try G and H.

A valid word that fits: G, H, A, R, E → “GRAEH” is invalid (not a word).  
Try “GRAE” + a letter – we need 5 letters.

Let’s try “GRAPE” – P is eliminated.  
“GRADE” – D is eliminated.  
“GRAFT” – T is eliminated.  

Try “HAREM” – M is allowed, H is allowed.  
Check positions:
- H (new)  
- A (position 2) – allowed  
- R (position 3) – R cannot be 3 – conflict.  

Try “MARES” – S is eliminated.  

Try “RAGE” + a letter – we need 5 letters.  
Try “RAGED” – D eliminated.  
Try “RAGER” – repeats R.  

Try “EARLY” – L is eliminated.  

Try “FARCE” – C is eliminated.  

Try “GARER” – repeats R.  

Try “WAGER” – W and G are allowed.  
Positions:

- E (position 4) – allowed  
- R (position 5) – allowed (R can be 5)  

This seems valid. “WAGER” contains A, R, E, plus W and G (both allowed), and positions fit constraints.

So: W (1) A (2) G (3) E (4) R (5).  
- A is in 2 – allowed (not 3)  
- R is in 5 – allowed (not 2 or 3)  
- E is in 4 – allowed (not 5)  

No eliminated letters used. This seems like a good next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting strategies include using vowels and frequently appearing consonants. A good first guess often contains multiple vowels and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N, etc. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination covers a good range of letters that appear frequently in English words, which should provide useful feedback for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S (x) – not in the word at all  
- L (x) – not in the word at all  
- A (-) – in the word, but not in position 3  
- T (x) – not in the word at all  
- E (-) – in the word, but not in position 5  

So the secret word:
- Contains A and E  
- Does NOT contain S, L, or T  
- A is not in position 3  
- E is not in position 5  

I want a second guess that:
1. Keeps A and E in different positions  
2. Introduces new common letters not yet tested (especially vowels and consonants we haven’t eliminated)  
3. Avoids S, L, T entirely  

A good candidate is “CRANE”:
- C, R, N are common consonants we haven’t ruled out  
- A and E are moved to new positions (2 and 4)  
- No S, L, or T  

This should help determine where A and E go, plus test C, R, N.

   – Additional letters NOT in the word: C, N  
   – Letters in the word but misplaced: R (not in position 2), A (not in position 3), E (not in position 5)

So far we know:
- Must contain A, R, E (each is “in word but wrong place”).  
- Cannot contain S, L, T, C, N.  

Positions still possible for each required letter:
- A: not 3 → could be 1, 2, 4, 5  
- R: not 2 → could be 1, 3, 4, 5  
- E: not 5 → could be 1, 2, 3, 4  

I want a word that:
- Uses A, R, E exactly once each  
- Avoids S, L, T, C, N  
- Introduces new common letters (e.g., D, G, H, M, P, etc.)  
- Places A, R, E in new positions to narrow down their correct spots  

A good candidate is “DRAPE”:
- Contains D, R, A, P, E – all allowed letters  
- Places R in position 1 (new for R)  
- Places A in position 2 (new for A)  
- Places E in position 4 (new for E)

From the feedback so far:

1. SLATE: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)  
   – Eliminated: S, L, T  
   – A is in the word but not in position 3  
   – E is in the word but not in position 5  

2. CRANE: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)  
   – Eliminated: C, N (added)  
   – R is in the word but not in position 2  

3. DRAPE: D(x) R(-) A(-) P(x) E(-)  
   – Eliminated: D, P (added)  
   – R is in the word but not in position 3  

4. WAGER: W(x) A(✓) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)  
   – Eliminated: W, G (added)  
   – A is now known to be in position 2  
   – E is now known to be in position 4  
   – R is now known to be in position 5  

So we have:

- Positions: 1 _ 2 A 3 _ 4 E 5 R  

- Letters already placed: A, E, R  

- Letters eliminated so far: S, L, T, C, N, D, P, W, G  

- Remaining possible letters (common ones): B, F, H, I, K, M, O, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z  

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 3. These must be from the remaining letters and must not repeat any already used.

Possible combinations:

- Position 1: B, F, H, K, M, etc.  
- Position 3: B, F, H, K, M, etc. (different from position 1)

Looking for valid 5-letter words that fit the pattern _ A _ E R.

Examples:
- B A B E R – not a word
- F A R E R – R already in position 5
- H A M E R – ""HATER"" but T is eliminated
- M A C E R – C is eliminated
- F A V E R – not a word
- B A K E R – ""BAKER"" – K and B are allowed, fits pattern

""BAKER"" fits:
- B (position 1) – allowed  
- A (position 2) – confirmed by ✓  
- K (position 3) – allowed  
- E (position 4) – confirmed by ✓  
- R (position 5) – confirmed by ✓  

No eliminated letters used. This seems like the correct word.
