Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to maximize the amount of information we can gain about the secret word. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A word like ""AROSE"" contains five of these very common letters and can give us good coverage. However, since we want to avoid repeating letters in the first guess (to maximize information), we can choose ""AROSE"" or ""STARE"" or ""RAISE"". 

""STARE"" is a strong first guess because it contains S, T, A, R, E - all very common letters, and no repeats. This will help us quickly identify which of these key letters are present in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on STARE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- T is not in the word (x)
- A is in the correct position (✓) at position 3
- R and E are not in the word (x)

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern _ _ A _ _
- It contains an S somewhere (but not in position 1)
- It does NOT contain T, R, or E

We now want a second guess that:
1. Keeps A in position 3
2. Places S in one of the remaining positions (2, 3, 4, 5) - but 3 is already A, so 2, 4, or 5
3. Introduces new common letters that haven't been tested yet

Common unused letters: O, I, N, L, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

Let's try a word that satisfies:
- A in position 3
- S in position 2 or 4 or 5
- Adds new common letters

Possible candidates:
- S A _ A _ (but SA... isn't common)
- _ S A _ _ (e.g., PSALM - but has L and M)
- _ _ A S _ (e.g., PLAYS - but has Y)
- _ _ A _ S (e.g., PLANS - but has N)

""PLANS"" seems good - it has:
- P (new)
- L (new)
- A in correct position 3
- N (new)
- S in position 5 (new position for S)

This tests 3 new letters (P, L, N) and places S in a new position (5), while keeping A in place.

From the two pieces of feedback we have:

1. STARE → S(-) T(x) A(✓) R(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - A is fixed in position 3.
   - T, R, E are not in the word.

   - P and L are not in the word.
   - N is not in the word.
   - S is now confirmed in position 5 (✓).
   - A is again confirmed in position 3.

So the pattern we have so far is:
- _ _ A _ S
- Letters known to be in the word: A, S
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: T, R, E, P, L, N

We need a word that:
- Has A in position 3 and S in position 5.
- Does not contain T, R, E, P, L, N.
- Uses remaining common letters: C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y.

Let's think of 5-letter words ending in AS:
- C has to be in positions 1, 2, or 4.
- Common words ending in AS: 
  - DASHES - too long
  - CHAS - too short
  - HASTY - but ends in Y, not AS
  - FASHI - not valid
  - MAS - too short
  - CASH - but we need 5 letters

Wait, we need exactly 5 letters ending in AS:
- C has to be in 1, 2, or 4.
- Possible patterns: _ _ A _ S or _ _ A S (but that would be 4 letters).

Looking at valid 5-letter words ending in AS:
- CHAOS - but O is allowed, H is allowed
- DASHES - too long
- FASHI - not valid
- GHOST - but ends in T
- MAIZE - ends in E
- CHASE - ends in E
- HASTE - ends in E
- MISAS - not valid
- KASPA - but P is excluded
- GAZAS - but Z is less common

""CHAOS"" seems valid:
- C, H, A, O, S
- A is in position 3 (✓)
- S is in position 5 (✓)
- Letters used: C, H, O - none of which are excluded
- Letters not used: T, R, E, P, L, N - all excluded

This seems like a good third guess to test C and H and O.

For the first guess, we want to maximize the amount of information we can gain about the secret word. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A word like ""AROSE"" contains five of these very common letters and can give us good coverage. However, since we want to avoid repeating letters in the first guess (to maximize information), we can choose ""AROSE"" or ""STARE"" or ""RAISE"". 

""STARE"" is a strong first guess because it contains S, T, A, R, E - all very common letters, and no repeats. This will help us quickly identify which of these key letters are present in the word and their possible positions.

Let's try a word that satisfies:
- A in position 3
- S in position 2 or 4 or 5
- Adds new common letters

Possible candidates:
- S A _ A _ (but SA... isn't common)
- _ S A _ _ (e.g., PSALM - but has L and M)
- _ _ A S _ (e.g., PLAYS - but has Y)
- _ _ A _ S (e.g., PLANS - but has N)

""PLANS"" seems good - it has:
- P (new)
- L (new)
- A in correct position 3
- N (new)
- S in position 5 (new position for S)

This tests 3 new letters (P, L, N) and places S in a new position (5), while keeping A in place.

From the two pieces of feedback we have:

1. STARE → S(-) T(x) A(✓) R(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - A is fixed in position 3.
   - T, R, E are not in the word.

2. PLANS → P(x) L(x) A(✓) N(x) S(✓)
   - P and L are not in the word.
   - N is not in the word.
   - S is now confirmed in position 5 (✓).
   - A is again confirmed in position 3.

So the pattern we have so far is:
- _ _ A _ S
- Letters known to be in the word: A, S
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: T, R, E, P, L, N

We need a word that:
- Has A in position 3 and S in position 5.
- Does not contain T, R, E, P, L, N.
- Uses remaining common letters: C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y.

Let's think of 5-letter words ending in AS:
- C has to be in positions 1, 2, or 4.
- Common words ending in AS: 
  - DASHES - too long
  - CHAS - too short
  - HASTY - but ends in Y, not AS
  - FASHI - not valid
  - MAS - too short
  - CASH - but we need 5 letters

Wait, we need exactly 5 letters ending in AS:
- C has to be in 1, 2, or 4.
- Possible patterns: _ _ A _ S or _ _ A S (but that would be 4 letters).

Looking at valid 5-letter words ending in AS:
- CHAOS - but O is allowed, H is allowed
- DASHES - too long
- FASHI - not valid
- GHOST - but ends in T
- MAIZE - ends in E
- CHASE - ends in E
- HASTE - ends in E
- MISAS - not valid
- KASPA - but P is excluded
- GAZAS - but Z is less common

""CHAOS"" seems valid:
- C, H, A, O, S
- A is in position 3 (✓)
- S is in position 5 (✓)
- Letters used: C, H, O - none of which are excluded
- Letters not used: T, R, E, P, L, N - all excluded

This seems like a good third guess to test C and H and O.

Next: “FUGAS” – but G, A, S, F allowed, U allowed – but not a common word.

“GASPS” – P excluded.

“MAGMA” – ends with A, but we need …A_S.

Wait, we need the pattern _ _ A _ S, so last letter must be S, fourth letter must be allowed, third A, and first two any allowed consonants.

Let’s list possible fourth letters: D, F, G, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y, B, etc.

Possible words:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A word like ""AROSE"" contains five of these very common letters and can give us good coverage. However, since we want to avoid repeating letters in the first guess (to maximize information), we can choose ""AROSE"" or ""STARE"" or ""RAISE"". 

""STARE"" is a strong first guess because it contains S, T, A, R, E - all very common letters, and no repeats. This will help us quickly identify which of these key letters are present in the word and their possible positions.

Next: “FUGAS” – but G, A, S, F allowed, U allowed – but not a common word.

“GASPS” – P excluded.

“MAGMA” – ends with A, but we need …A_S.

Wait, we need the pattern _ _ A _ S, so last letter must be S, fourth letter must be allowed, third A, and first two any allowed consonants.

Let’s list possible fourth letters: D, F, G, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y, B, etc.

Possible words:
- “BAGDS” – not a word
- “BADGS” – not a word
- “BAIGS” – not a word
- “BAUDS” – valid word “BAUDS”
- “BAIGS” – not valid
- “BAKIS” – not valid
- “BAIMS” – not valid
- “BAVMS” – not valid
- “BAWMS” – not valid
- “BAIMS” – not valid
- “BAKIS” – not valid
- “BAUMS” – not valid
- “BAUDS” – valid, uses B, A, U, D, S – all allowed letters, fits pattern.

“BAUDS” seems valid:
- B, A, U, D, S
- A in position 3 (✓)
- S in position 5 (✓)
- B, U, D are allowed letters not yet excluded.

Therefore, “BAUDS” is a good next guess.

From the four rounds we now have:

1. STARE → S(-) T(x) A(✓) R(x) E(x)
   - A is somewhere in the word, not necessarily position 3.
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - T, R, E are absent.

2. PLANS → P(x) L(x) A(✓) N(x) S(✓)
   - S is confirmed in position 5.
   - P, L, N are absent.

3. CHAOS → C(x) H(x) A(✓) O(x) S(✓)
   - C, H, O are absent.

4. BAUDS → B(x) A(-) U(x) D(x) S(✓)
   - B, U, D are absent.
   - A is in the word but not in position 2 (since it’s “-” meaning it exists but is misplaced).

So the pattern is:
- _ _ A _ S (but we now know A is not in position 2, so it must be in position 1 or 4)
Wait, no: the feedback for BAUDS shows A(-), meaning A is in the word but not in position 2. Therefore A could be in position 1, 3, or 4. But from PLANS we know S is in position 5, and from STARE A is somewhere. However, we cannot be certain A is in position 3 anymore because the feedback for BAUDS shows A is not in position 2, but we still have the earlier feedback that A is in the word.

Let me re-express:

From STARE: A is in the word (✓ at position 3), but later feedback shows A is not in position 2 (BAUDS), but that doesn’t change it must still be in position 3 because the first feedback had A(✓) at position 3. The subsequent feedback only tells us A is not in position 2, but the ✓ in position 3 from STARE means it is confirmed in position 3.

Therefore the pattern is fixed at:
- _ A _ _ S
with the following forbidden letters: T, R, E, P, L, N, C, H, O, B, U, D.

Allowed remaining letters (common ones): F, G, I, K, M, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ A _ _ S using only these allowed letters.

Possible combinations:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Letters:   ? A ? ? S

Possible letters for positions 1, 3, 4 from the allowed set {F, G, I, K, M, V, W, Y}.

Looking for valid words:
- F A I R S – but R is excluded
- F A I G S – not a word
- F A K E S – E excluded
- G A I N S – N excluded
- G A M I S – not a word
- G A M S – too short
- M A I N S – N excluded
- V A I N S – N excluded
- W A I N S – N excluded
- F A V I S – not a word
- F A G I S – not a word
- G A I F S – not a word

- V A K I S – not a word
- W A K I S – not a word
- Y A K I S – not a word

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. Let me think differently: perhaps position 3 is not A but the earlier feedback was misinterpreted.

Wait, no: the first feedback from STARE had A(✓) at position 3, so A is definitely in position 3. The feedback from BAUDS had A(-) meaning A is in the word but not in position 2, which is consistent with it being in position 3.

So the pattern is definitely:
- _ A _ _ S

Looking for valid words fitting this pattern with allowed letters:

Allowed letters: F, G, I, K, M, V, W, Y (and A, S are already placed).

Possible words:
- F A I R S – R excluded
- F A I G S – not a word
- F A K E S – E excluded
- G A I N S – N excluded
- G A M I S – not a word
- M A I N S – N excluded
- V A I N S – N excluded
- W A I N S – N excluded
- F A M I S – not a word
- G A M I S – not a word

- G A K I S – not a word
- M A K I S – not a word
- V A K I S – not a word
- W A K I S – not a word
- Y A K I S – not a word

This is surprising. Let me check if I missed any letters. The allowed letters are {F, G, I, K, M, V, W, Y} plus A and S already fixed.

Another approach: look up valid 5-letter words with pattern _ A _ _ S using only these letters.

Possible candidates:
- F A I R S – R excluded
- F A I G S – not a word
- F A K E S – E excluded
- G A I F S – not a word
- G A M I S – not a word

- G A V I S – not a word
- M A V I S – not a word
- V A G I S – not a word
- W A V I S – not a word
- Y A V I S – not a word

None seem to fit. Let me consider that perhaps position 1 or 4 could be K, I, etc.

Wait, ""MAKIS"" – but that’s plural of maki, and S is already at position 5, so ""MAKIS"" would have S at position 5, but that’s a valid word, but it’s ""MAKIS"" which is 5 letters: M A K I S.

But position 3 is A, position 4 is K, position 5 is I, but we need S at position 5. So this doesn’t fit.

Another thought: ""F A K I S"" – but that’s not a word.

""V A I K S"" – not a word.

""K A I S"" – too short.

""K A I S"" – no.

""K A I S"" – no.

This is tricky. Let me try ""K A I S"" – no.

Wait, ""MAIMS"" – but that’s not a word.

""GAIGS"" – not a word.

""FAKIS"" – not a word.

""VAKIS"" – not a word.

""WAKIS"" – not a word.

""YAKIS"" – not a word.

""MAVIS"" – V is allowed, I is allowed, S is at position 5. ""MAVIS"" is a valid word (a misspelling of ""Mavis"" but actually ""Mavis"" is a name, but ""MAVIS"" is sometimes used as a word).

But let’s check: M A V I S – this fits _ A _ _ S pattern, and letters M, V, I are allowed (not excluded).

Yes, ""MAVIS"" seems valid.

Let me verify:
- M: allowed
- A: confirmed at position 3
- V: allowed
- I: allowed
- S: confirmed at position 5

Forbidden letters: T, R, E, P, L, N, C, H, O, B, U, D – none of these appear in ""MAVIS"".

Therefore, ""MAVIS"" is a valid next guess.

</think>

Based on the updated constraints, the word must be of the form _ A _ _ S using only allowed letters. After careful consideration, ""MAVIS"" fits this pattern perfectly.

""MAVIS"" – V is allowed, I is allowed, S is at position 5. ""MAVIS"" is a valid word (a misspelling of ""Mavis"" but actually ""Mavis"" is a name, but ""MAVIS"" is sometimes used as a word).

But let’s check: M A V I S – this fits _ A _ _ S pattern, and letters M, V, I are allowed (not excluded).

Yes, ""MAVIS"" seems valid.

Let me verify:
- M: allowed
- A: confirmed at position 3
- V: allowed
- I: allowed
- S: confirmed at position 5

Forbidden letters: T, R, E, P, L, N, C, H, O, B, U, D – none of these appear in ""MAVIS"".

Therefore, ""MAVIS"" is a valid next guess.Based on the updated constraints, the word must be of the form _ A _ _ S using only allowed letters. After careful consideration, ""MAVIS"" fits this pattern perfectly.",Guess 5: MAVIS -> FEEDBACK: M(-) A(-) V(x) I(x) S(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to maximize the amount of information we can gain about the secret word. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A word like ""AROSE"" contains five of these very common letters and can give us good coverage. However, since we want to avoid repeating letters in the first guess (to maximize information), we can choose ""AROSE"" or ""STARE"" or ""RAISE"". 

""STARE"" is a strong first guess because it contains S, T, A, R, E - all very common letters, and no repeats. This will help us quickly identify which of these key letters are present in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) A(✓) R(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on STARE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- T is not in the word (x)
- A is in the correct position (✓) at position 3
- R and E are not in the word (x)

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern _ _ A _ _
- It contains an S somewhere (but not in position 1)
- It does NOT contain T, R, or E

We now want a second guess that:
1. Keeps A in position 3
2. Places S in one of the remaining positions (2, 3, 4, 5) - but 3 is already A, so 2, 4, or 5
3. Introduces new common letters that haven't been tested yet

Common unused letters: O, I, N, L, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

Let's try a word that satisfies:
- A in position 3
- S in position 2 or 4 or 5
- Adds new common letters

Possible candidates:
- S A _ A _ (but SA... isn't common)
- _ S A _ _ (e.g., PSALM - but has L and M)
- _ _ A S _ (e.g., PLAYS - but has Y)
- _ _ A _ S (e.g., PLANS - but has N)

""PLANS"" seems good - it has:
- P (new)
- L (new)
- A in correct position 3
- N (new)
- S in position 5 (new position for S)

This tests 3 new letters (P, L, N) and places S in a new position (5), while keeping A in place.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: PLANS -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(✓) N(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two pieces of feedback we have:

1. STARE → S(-) T(x) A(✓) R(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - A is fixed in position 3.
   - T, R, E are not in the word.

2. PLANS → P(x) L(x) A(✓) N(x) S(✓)
   - P and L are not in the word.
   - N is not in the word.
   - S is now confirmed in position 5 (✓).
   - A is again confirmed in position 3.

So the pattern we have so far is:
- _ _ A _ S
- Letters known to be in the word: A, S
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: T, R, E, P, L, N

We need a word that:
- Has A in position 3 and S in position 5.
- Does not contain T, R, E, P, L, N.
- Uses remaining common letters: C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y.

Let's think of 5-letter words ending in AS:
- C has to be in positions 1, 2, or 4.
- Common words ending in AS: 
  - DASHES - too long
  - CHAS - too short
  - HASTY - but ends in Y, not AS
  - FASHI - not valid
  - MAS - too short
  - CASH - but we need 5 letters

Wait, we need exactly 5 letters ending in AS:
- C has to be in 1, 2, or 4.
- Possible patterns: _ _ A _ S or _ _ A S (but that would be 4 letters).

Looking at valid 5-letter words ending in AS:
- CHAOS - but O is allowed, H is allowed
- DASHES - too long
- FASHI - not valid
- GHOST - but ends in T
- MAIZE - ends in E
- CHASE - ends in E
- HASTE - ends in E
- MISAS - not valid
- KASPA - but P is excluded
- GAZAS - but Z is less common

""CHAOS"" seems valid:
- C, H, A, O, S
- A is in position 3 (✓)
- S is in position 5 (✓)
- Letters used: C, H, O - none of which are excluded
- Letters not used: T, R, E, P, L, N - all excluded

This seems like a good third guess to test C and H and O.

From the three rounds we now know:

1. STARE → S(-) T(x) A(✓) R(x) E(x)
   - A is fixed in position 3.
   - S is somewhere in the word but **not** in position 1.
   - T, R, E are absent.

2. PLANS → P(x) L(x) A(✓) N(x) S(✓)
   - S is confirmed in position 5.
   - P, L, N are absent.

3. CHAOS → C(x) H(x) A(✓) O(x) S(✓)
   - C, H, O are absent.

So the pattern is:
- _ _ A _ S
- Forbidden letters so far: T, R, E, P, L, N, C, H, O
- Allowed remaining letters (among common ones): D, F, G, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y, B, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending “…AIS” or “…AGS” or similar, but position 4 must be one of the allowed letters and position 5 is already S.

Let’s list possible combinations for positions 1, 2, 4:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Letters:   ? ? A ? S

Try common consonants + vowels:

- D, F, G, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y, B, S (but S already used)

Some candidate words:
- “MASSY” – but double S and Y may be uncommon
- “BAGGY” – B and G allowed, but double G
- “DAMPS” – P excluded
- “FUMES” – U allowed, M allowed, but E excluded
- “GUMMY” – double U, Y allowed
- “GASPS” – S already used, P excluded
- “WACKS” – C excluded
- “VAGUE” – E excluded
- “VAMPS” – P excluded
- “MAGIC” – C excluded
- “MADIS” – not a word
- “WAGED” – ends with D
- “VIRAL” – L excluded
- “VALID” – L excluded
- “WISPS” – P excluded
- “VIGOR” – O, R excluded
- “WISDS” – not a word
- “MUMMY” – double M, U allowed, Y allowed

“MUMMY” fits:
- M, U, M, Y are all allowed letters.
- Pattern: M U A M S – but that would be M U A M S (positions 1-5). Wait, position 4 must be M, but that would make the word M U A M S, which is not a valid word.

Another candidate: “WAGSY” – but Y at end is allowed, S already at end – duplicate S, not ideal.

Better: “VAGUE” – but E excluded.

Next: “FUGAS” – but G, A, S, F allowed, U allowed – but not a common word.

“GASPS” – P excluded.

“MAGMA” – ends with A, but we need …A_S.

Wait, we need the pattern _ _ A _ S, so last letter must be S, fourth letter must be allowed, third A, and first two any allowed consonants.

Let’s list possible fourth letters: D, F, G, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y, B, etc.

Possible words:
- “BAGDS” – not a word
- “BADGS” – not a word
- “BAIGS” – not a word
- “BAUDS” – valid word “BAUDS”
- “BAIGS” – not valid
- “BAKIS” – not valid
- “BAIMS” – not valid
- “BAVMS” – not valid
- “BAWMS” – not valid
- “BAIMS” – not valid
- “BAKIS” – not valid
- “BAUMS” – not valid
- “BAUDS” – valid, uses B, A, U, D, S – all allowed letters, fits pattern.

“BAUDS” seems valid:
- B, A, U, D, S
- A in position 3 (✓)
- S in position 5 (✓)
- B, U, D are allowed letters not yet excluded.

Therefore, “BAUDS” is a good next guess.

From the four rounds we now have:

1. STARE → S(-) T(x) A(✓) R(x) E(x)
   - A is somewhere in the word, not necessarily position 3.
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - T, R, E are absent.

2. PLANS → P(x) L(x) A(✓) N(x) S(✓)
   - S is confirmed in position 5.
   - P, L, N are absent.

3. CHAOS → C(x) H(x) A(✓) O(x) S(✓)
   - C, H, O are absent.

4. BAUDS → B(x) A(-) U(x) D(x) S(✓)
   - B, U, D are absent.
   - A is in the word but not in position 2 (since it’s “-” meaning it exists but is misplaced).

So the pattern is:
- _ _ A _ S (but we now know A is not in position 2, so it must be in position 1 or 4)
Wait, no: the feedback for BAUDS shows A(-), meaning A is in the word but not in position 2. Therefore A could be in position 1, 3, or 4. But from PLANS we know S is in position 5, and from STARE A is somewhere. However, we cannot be certain A is in position 3 anymore because the feedback for BAUDS shows A is not in position 2, but we still have the earlier feedback that A is in the word.

Let me re-express:

From STARE: A is in the word (✓ at position 3), but later feedback shows A is not in position 2 (BAUDS), but that doesn’t change it must still be in position 3 because the first feedback had A(✓) at position 3. The subsequent feedback only tells us A is not in position 2, but the ✓ in position 3 from STARE means it is confirmed in position 3.

Therefore the pattern is fixed at:
- _ A _ _ S
with the following forbidden letters: T, R, E, P, L, N, C, H, O, B, U, D.

Allowed remaining letters (common ones): F, G, I, K, M, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ A _ _ S using only these allowed letters.

Possible combinations:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Letters:   ? A ? ? S

Possible letters for positions 1, 3, 4 from the allowed set {F, G, I, K, M, V, W, Y}.

Looking for valid words:
- F A I R S – but R is excluded
- F A I G S – not a word
- F A K E S – E excluded
- G A I N S – N excluded
- G A M I S – not a word
- G A M S – too short
- M A I N S – N excluded
- V A I N S – N excluded
- W A I N S – N excluded
- F A V I S – not a word
- F A G I S – not a word
- G A I F S – not a word
- G A V I S – not a word
- M A I F S – not a word
- K A I F S – not a word
- V A I K S – not a word
- W A I K S – not a word
- F A M I S – not a word
- G A M I S – not a word
- M A G I S – not a word
- V A M I S – not a word
- W A M I S – not a word
- Y A M I S – not a word
- F A K I S – not a word
- G A K I S – not a word
- M A K I S – not a word
- V A K I S – not a word
- W A K I S – not a word
- Y A K I S – not a word

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. Let me think differently: perhaps position 3 is not A but the earlier feedback was misinterpreted.

Wait, no: the first feedback from STARE had A(✓) at position 3, so A is definitely in position 3. The feedback from BAUDS had A(-) meaning A is in the word but not in position 2, which is consistent with it being in position 3.

So the pattern is definitely:
- _ A _ _ S

Looking for valid words fitting this pattern with allowed letters:

Allowed letters: F, G, I, K, M, V, W, Y (and A, S are already placed).

Possible words:
- F A I R S – R excluded
- F A I G S – not a word
- F A K E S – E excluded
- G A I N S – N excluded
- G A M I S – not a word
- M A I N S – N excluded
- V A I N S – N excluded
- W A I N S – N excluded
- F A M I S – not a word
- G A M I S – not a word
- M A G I S – not a word
- V A M I S – not a word
- W A M I S – not a word
- Y A M I S – not a word
- F A K I S – not a word
- G A K I S – not a word
- M A K I S – not a word
- V A K I S – not a word
- W A K I S – not a word
- Y A K I S – not a word

This is surprising. Let me check if I missed any letters. The allowed letters are {F, G, I, K, M, V, W, Y} plus A and S already fixed.

Another approach: look up valid 5-letter words with pattern _ A _ _ S using only these letters.

Possible candidates:
- F A I R S – R excluded
- F A I G S – not a word
- F A K E S – E excluded
- G A I F S – not a word
- G A M I S – not a word
- M A G I S – not a word
- V A G I S – not a word
- W A G I S – not a word
- Y A G I S – not a word
- F A V I S – not a word
- G A V I S – not a word
- M A V I S – not a word
- V A G I S – not a word
- W A V I S – not a word
- Y A V I S – not a word

None seem to fit. Let me consider that perhaps position 1 or 4 could be K, I, etc.

Wait, ""MAKIS"" – but that’s plural of maki, and S is already at position 5, so ""MAKIS"" would have S at position 5, but that’s a valid word, but it’s ""MAKIS"" which is 5 letters: M A K I S.

But position 3 is A, position 4 is K, position 5 is I, but we need S at position 5. So this doesn’t fit.

Another thought: ""F A K I S"" – but that’s not a word.

""V A I K S"" – not a word.

""K A I S"" – too short.

""K A I S"" – no.

""K A I S"" – no.

This is tricky. Let me try ""K A I S"" – no.

Wait, ""MAIMS"" – but that’s not a word.

""GAIGS"" – not a word.

""FAIGS"" – not a word.

""GAIFS"" – not a word.

""FAIFS"" – not a word.

""GAIGS"" – not a word.

""MAIGS"" – not a word.

""VAIGS"" – not a word.

""WAIGS"" – not a word.

""YAIGS"" – not a word.

""MAKIS"" – as above.

""GAKIS"" – not a word.

""FAKIS"" – not a word.

""VAKIS"" – not a word.

""WAKIS"" – not a word.

""YAKIS"" – not a word.

""MAVIS"" – V is allowed, I is allowed, S is at position 5. ""MAVIS"" is a valid word (a misspelling of ""Mavis"" but actually ""Mavis"" is a name, but ""MAVIS"" is sometimes used as a word).

But let’s check: M A V I S – this fits _ A _ _ S pattern, and letters M, V, I are allowed (not excluded).

Yes, ""MAVIS"" seems valid.

Let me verify:
- M: allowed
- A: confirmed at position 3
- V: allowed
- I: allowed
- S: confirmed at position 5

Forbidden letters: T, R, E, P, L, N, C, H, O, B, U, D – none of these appear in ""MAVIS"".

Therefore, ""MAVIS"" is a valid next guess.Based on the updated constraints, the word must be of the form _ A _ _ S using only allowed letters. After careful consideration, ""MAVIS"" fits this pattern perfectly.

Therefore A could be in position 1, 3, or 4. But from PLANS we know S is in position 5, and from STARE A is somewhere. However, we cannot be certain A is in position 3 anymore because the feedback for BAUDS shows A is not in position 2, but we still have the earlier feedback that A is in the word.\n\nLet me re-express:\n\nFrom STARE: A is in the word (✓ at position 3), but later feedback shows A is not in position 2 (BAUDS), but that doesn’t change it must still be in position 3 because the first feedback had A(✓) at position 3.

Let me think differently: perhaps position 3 is not A but the earlier feedback was misinterpreted.\n\nWait, no: the first feedback from STARE had A(✓) at position 3, so A is definitely in position 3. The feedback from BAUDS had A(-) meaning A is in the word but not in position 2, which is consistent with it being in position 3.\n\nSo the pattern is definitely:\n- _ A _ _ S\n\nLooking for valid words fitting this pattern with allowed letters:\n\nAllowed letters: F, G, I, K, M, V, W, Y (and A, S are already placed).\n\nPossible words:\n- F A I R S – R excluded\n- F A I G S – not a word\n- F A K E S – E excluded\n- G A I N S – N excluded\n- G A M I S – not a word\n- M A I N S – N excluded\n- V A I N S – N excluded\n- W A I N S – N excluded\n- F A M I S – not a word\n- G A M I S – not a word\n- M A G I S – not a word\n- V A M I S – not a word\n- W A M I S – not a word\n- Y A M I S – not a word\n- F A K I S – not a word\n- G A K I S – not a word\n- M A K I S – not a word\n- V A K I S – not a word\n- W A K I S – not a word\n- Y A K I S – not a word\n\nThis is surprising.
