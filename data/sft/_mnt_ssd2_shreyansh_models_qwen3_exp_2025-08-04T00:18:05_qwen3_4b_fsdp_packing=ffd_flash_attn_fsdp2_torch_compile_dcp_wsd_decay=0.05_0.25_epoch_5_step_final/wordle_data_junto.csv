For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several letters efficiently. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is a strong first guess because it contains:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common letter in English

This combination gives good coverage to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: not in the word (x)
- L: not in the word (x)
- A: not in the word (x)
- T: in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so T is the 4th letter: _ _ _ T _
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word has T in the 4th position.
- It does not contain S, L, A, or E.

Next, I want to test new vowels (I, O, U) and common consonants that haven’t been ruled out (R, N, C, H, etc.). A good candidate is “CRIMP”:
- C: new consonant
- R: new consonant
- I: new vowel
- M: new consonant
- P: new consonant

This tests 3 new consonants and 1 new vowel while keeping T in the 4th position. If I get feedback, I can narrow down the remaining letters.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, E, C, R, I, M, P  
Fixed letter: T is in the 4th position.

We still need to test the remaining common consonants and vowels.  
Among the untested common letters are: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z and the vowels O, U.

A good next word uses fresh, high-frequency letters to maximize information gain.  
Let’s pick “BOUNT”:  
- B, O, U, N have not been ruled out.  
- T is already confirmed in the 4th spot, so we can place it there and test the other four positions with new letters.

If this gives any hits or misses, we’ll have coverage of five fresh letters.

- N is in the word but NOT in position 4 (N(-))  
- T is in the word but NOT in position 5 (T(-))  

However, we already know T is in position 4, so this simply confirms that.  
We still don’t know the exact positions of O, U, and N, but we know they must appear somewhere in the remaining four slots (positions 1, 2, 3, 5).

We need a word that:
1. Contains O, U, N, T (with T in position 4).  
2. Uses only letters that have not been ruled out.  
3. Places O, U, N in new positions to test their validity.

A word that satisfies these constraints is “FOUNT”:
- F is a new consonant (not yet tested).  
- O, U, N, T are all required letters.  
- T is in position 4 as confirmed.  
- O will be tested in position 2, U in position 3, N in position 4 (but T is already there so N will be in position 5), etc.

But wait: in FOUNT, N is in position 5, which was already tested in BOUNT and found to be invalid (N(-)). So N cannot be in position 5.  
Let’s instead try “DOUNT”:
- D is new.  
- O in position 2 (tested before as invalid, but we already know O is in word and just not in 2, so this is redundant).  

Actually, we need to test O, U, N in positions 1, 2, 3, 5.  
A word that does this is “TUNGO” (but G is untested and we don’t know if G is in word).  

Another candidate is “TONFU” but F is untested.  

Let’s pick “TONIC” but I and C are already ruled out.  

A better choice is “TONSW” but S is ruled out.  

Let’s try “TONY” but Y is untested and we need 5 letters.  

Actually, we need a 5-letter word with T in position 4, and containing O, U, N in some positions 1-3-5.  
Let’s list possible words:  
- T _ _ O N  
- T _ N O _  
- T O _ N _  
- T _ U N _  
- etc.

A valid word is “TUNGO” but G is untested.  

Another is “TONSU” but S is ruled out.  

Let’s try “TUNNY” but Y is untested.  

Actually, let’s use “TUNGO” even though G is untested; we have no information about G yet.  

But to maximize information, let’s use “TUNGO” because it tests G, T, U, N, O.  

However, we already know T is in position 4, so the word must be _ _ _ T _.  
So we need O, U, N in positions 1,2,3,5.  

A word that fits is “OFTUN” but F is untested.  

Let’s use “OFTUN”:
- O in position 1 (new)  
- F new  
- T in position 4 (fixed)  
- U in position 3 (new)  
- N in position 5 (new)  

This tests O in 1, U in 3, N in 5, and F is new consonant.  

But we need to make sure this is a valid word. “OFTUN” is not a valid English word.  

Let’s pick “FOUNT”:
- F new  
- O in 2 (already known invalid)  
- U in 3 (new)  
- N in 5 (new)  
- T in 4 (fixed)  

“FOUNT” is a valid word, even though O in position 2 was already tested as invalid, we can still use it to test other letters.  

But since we know O is not in position 2, let’s pick “UNION” but I is ruled out.  

Let’s try “DONUT” but U is already known to be in word.  

Actually, let’s use “FOUNT” because it is a valid word and tests F, O, U, N, T with T fixed in 4.  

So the guess is FOUNT.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several letters efficiently. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is a strong first guess because it contains:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common letter in English

This combination gives good coverage to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: not in the word (x)
- L: not in the word (x)
- A: not in the word (x)
- T: in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so T is the 4th letter: _ _ _ T _
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word has T in the 4th position.
- It does not contain S, L, A, or E.

Next, I want to test new vowels (I, O, U) and common consonants that haven’t been ruled out (R, N, C, H, etc.). A good candidate is “CRIMP”:
- C: new consonant
- R: new consonant
- I: new vowel
- M: new consonant
- P: new consonant

This tests 3 new consonants and 1 new vowel while keeping T in the 4th position. If I get feedback, I can narrow down the remaining letters.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, E, C, R, I, M, P  
Fixed letter: T is in the 4th position.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ T _

We still need to test the remaining common consonants and vowels.  
Among the untested common letters are: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z and the vowels O, U.

A good next word uses fresh, high-frequency letters to maximize information gain.  
Let’s pick “BOUNT”:  
- B, O, U, N have not been ruled out.  
- T is already confirmed in the 4th spot, so we can place it there and test the other four positions with new letters.

If this gives any hits or misses, we’ll have coverage of five fresh letters.

From the four rounds we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, E, C, R, I, M, P, B, F  
Letters definitely in the word: O, U, N, T (and T is fixed in position 4).

Previous feedback tells us:
- O is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from BOUNT and FOUNT).  
- U is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4.  
- N is in the word but NOT in positions 4 or 5.  

Since T is in position 4, the remaining slots are 1, 2, 3, 5.  
O, U, N must occupy three of these four slots, with the fourth slot filled by a new letter (only letter left that hasn’t appeared and is common: D, G, H, K, V, W, Y).

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has T in position 4.  
- Contains O, U, N in some combination of positions 1, 2, 3, 5.  
- Uses only letters from the allowed set.

One such word is “DOUNT” but D is untested.  
Another is “GONUT” but G is untested.  
A valid word that fits is “TONSU” but S is ruled out.  

Let’s try “TONY” but Y is untested and we need 5 letters.  

Actually, let’s test D in position 1 with O, U, N in other positions:  
Possible word: “DONUT” – but U is already known to be in word.  

Wait, let’s list possible arrangements:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Fixed: _ _ _ T _  
Letters to place: O, U, N plus one more from remaining (D, G, H, K, V, W, Y).

A valid word is “WOUND” but D is allowed and T is fixed in 4, but WOUND has T in 4? No, WOUND is W O U N D.  

Let’s try “WOUND” – T is not in it.  

Let’s pick “DONUT” – but T is in 4, so D O N U T – but U is in position 4 which is T.  

Actually, the word must be _ _ _ T _ with O, U, N in 1,2,3,5.  

Possible word: “OFTUN” – but F is ruled out.  

Let’s try “YOUTH” – but H is untested, T is in 4.  

“YOUTH” is Y O U T H – T is in 4, Y, O, U, H are allowed.  

This is a valid word and tests Y, O, U, H with T fixed in 4.  

So the guess is YOUTH.

<guess>YOUTH</guess>",YOUTH,"From the four rounds we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, E, C, R, I, M, P, B, F  
Letters definitely in the word: O, U, N, T (and T is fixed in position 4).

Previous feedback tells us:
- O is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from BOUNT and FOUNT).  
- U is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4.  
- N is in the word but NOT in positions 4 or 5.  

Since T is in position 4, the remaining slots are 1, 2, 3, 5.  
O, U, N must occupy three of these four slots, with the fourth slot filled by a new letter (only letter left that hasn’t appeared and is common: D, G, H, K, V, W, Y).

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has T in position 4.  
- Contains O, U, N in some combination of positions 1, 2, 3, 5.  
- Uses only letters from the allowed set.

One such word is “DOUNT” but D is untested.  
Another is “GONUT” but G is untested.  
A valid word that fits is “TONSU” but S is ruled out.  

Let’s try “TONY” but Y is untested and we need 5 letters.

A valid word is “WOUND” but D is allowed and T is fixed in 4, but WOUND has T in 4? No, WOUND is W O U N D.  

Let’s try “WOUND” – T is not in it.  

Let’s pick “DONUT” – but T is in 4, so D O N U T – but U is in position 4 which is T.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several letters efficiently. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is a strong first guess because it contains:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common letter in English

This combination gives good coverage to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: not in the word (x)
- L: not in the word (x)
- A: not in the word (x)
- T: in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so T is the 4th letter: _ _ _ T _
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word has T in the 4th position.
- It does not contain S, L, A, or E.

Next, I want to test new vowels (I, O, U) and common consonants that haven’t been ruled out (R, N, C, H, etc.). A good candidate is “CRIMP”:
- C: new consonant
- R: new consonant
- I: new vowel
- M: new consonant
- P: new consonant

This tests 3 new consonants and 1 new vowel while keeping T in the 4th position. If I get feedback, I can narrow down the remaining letters.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, E, C, R, I, M, P  
Fixed letter: T is in the 4th position.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ T _

We still need to test the remaining common consonants and vowels.  
Among the untested common letters are: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z and the vowels O, U.

A good next word uses fresh, high-frequency letters to maximize information gain.  
Let’s pick “BOUNT”:  
- B, O, U, N have not been ruled out.  
- T is already confirmed in the 4th spot, so we can place it there and test the other four positions with new letters.

If this gives any hits or misses, we’ll have coverage of five fresh letters.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, E, C, R, I, M, P, B  
- Letters known to be in the word: O, U, N, T  
- T is fixed in the 4th position.

The feedback from BOUNT shows:
- O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (O(-))  
- U is in the word but NOT in position 3 (U(-))  
- N is in the word but NOT in position 4 (N(-))  
- T is in the word but NOT in position 5 (T(-))  

However, we already know T is in position 4, so this simply confirms that.  
We still don’t know the exact positions of O, U, and N, but we know they must appear somewhere in the remaining four slots (positions 1, 2, 3, 5).

We need a word that:
1. Contains O, U, N, T (with T in position 4).  
2. Uses only letters that have not been ruled out.  
3. Places O, U, N in new positions to test their validity.

A word that satisfies these constraints is “FOUNT”:
- F is a new consonant (not yet tested).  
- O, U, N, T are all required letters.  
- T is in position 4 as confirmed.  
- O will be tested in position 2, U in position 3, N in position 4 (but T is already there so N will be in position 5), etc.

But wait: in FOUNT, N is in position 5, which was already tested in BOUNT and found to be invalid (N(-)). So N cannot be in position 5.  
Let’s instead try “DOUNT”:
- D is new.  
- O in position 2 (tested before as invalid, but we already know O is in word and just not in 2, so this is redundant).  

Actually, we need to test O, U, N in positions 1, 2, 3, 5.  
A word that does this is “TUNGO” (but G is untested and we don’t know if G is in word).  

Another candidate is “TONFU” but F is untested.  

Let’s pick “TONIC” but I and C are already ruled out.  

A better choice is “TONSW” but S is ruled out.  

Let’s try “TONY” but Y is untested and we need 5 letters.  

Actually, we need a 5-letter word with T in position 4, and containing O, U, N in some positions 1-3-5.  
Let’s list possible words:  
- T _ _ O N  
- T _ N O _  
- T O _ N _  
- T _ U N _  
- etc.

A valid word is “TUNGO” but G is untested.  

Another is “TONSU” but S is ruled out.  

Let’s try “TUNNY” but Y is untested.  

Actually, let’s use “TUNGO” even though G is untested; we have no information about G yet.  

But to maximize information, let’s use “TUNGO” because it tests G, T, U, N, O.  

However, we already know T is in position 4, so the word must be _ _ _ T _.  
So we need O, U, N in positions 1,2,3,5.  

A word that fits is “OFTUN” but F is untested.  

Let’s use “OFTUN”:
- O in position 1 (new)  
- F new  
- T in position 4 (fixed)  
- U in position 3 (new)  
- N in position 5 (new)  

This tests O in 1, U in 3, N in 5, and F is new consonant.  

But we need to make sure this is a valid word. “OFTUN” is not a valid English word.  

Let’s pick “FOUNT”:
- F new  
- O in 2 (already known invalid)  
- U in 3 (new)  
- N in 5 (new)  
- T in 4 (fixed)  

“FOUNT” is a valid word, even though O in position 2 was already tested as invalid, we can still use it to test other letters.  

But since we know O is not in position 2, let’s pick “UNION” but I is ruled out.  

Let’s try “DONUT” but U is already known to be in word.  

Actually, let’s use “FOUNT” because it is a valid word and tests F, O, U, N, T with T fixed in 4.  

So the guess is FOUNT.

From the five rounds we now know:

Letters NOT in the word:  
S, L, A, E, C, R, I, M, P, B, F, Y, H  

Letters definitely in the word:  
O, U, N, T (and T is fixed in position 4).

Previous feedback tells us:
- O is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from BOUNT, FOUNT, YOUTH).  
- U is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (from BOUNT, YOUTH).  
- N is in the word but NOT in positions 4 or 5 (from BOUNT, YOUTH).  

Since T is fixed in position 4, the remaining slots are 1, 2, 3, 5.  
O, U, N must occupy three of these four slots, with the fourth slot filled by a new letter (only letter left that hasn’t appeared and is common: D, G, K, V, W).

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has T in position 4.  
- Contains O, U, N in some combination of positions 1, 2, 3, 5.  
- Uses only letters from the allowed set.

The only common letter left that fits is D.  
A valid word that fits is “DONUT” but U is already known to be in word.  

Wait, let’s list possible arrangements:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Fixed: _ _ _ T _  
Letters to place: O, U, N plus one more from D, G, K, V, W.

A valid word is “WOUND” – but W is allowed, O, U, N, D are allowed, T is in 4.  

But “WOUND” is W O U N D – T is not in it.  

Let’s try “GONUT” – but G is allowed, O, N, U, T are allowed, but T is not in position 4.  

Let’s try “TONDU” – but T is not in position 4.  

Actually, the word must be _ _ _ T _ with O, U, N in 1,2,3,5.  

Possible word: “OFTUN” – but F is ruled out.  

Let’s try “KOUNT” – K is allowed, O, U, N, T are allowed, T is in position 4.  

“KOUNT” is a valid word meaning “to count in a certain way” and fits all constraints.

So the guess is KOUNT.
