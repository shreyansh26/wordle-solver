### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

Looking at common letters in English, the most frequent are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A strong opening word would use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. ""AROSE"" is a classic choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no duplicates. This gives us maximum information about which of these key letters are present in the secret word.

Another good alternative is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O which is very common.

So, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:

Let’s brainstorm possible candidates:
- er... but E cannot be last, so words like ""error"" are invalid (E at end)
- ""right"" – contains R and E, but has A? No, ""right"" has R, I, G, H, T – no A/O/S, and R not in position 2, E not in position 5. This seems valid.
- ""crepe"" – has S? No, but has E at end which is invalid.
- ""river"" – has R and E, but E is at position 4, R at 1 and 4. No A/O/S. Valid.
- ""regret"" – has E at 5 which is invalid.

1. Letters that must appear: R and E (both confirmed present).
2. Letters that are definitely absent: A, O, S, I, G, H, T.
3. Position constraints:
   - R cannot be in positions 2 or 1 (from arose and right feedback).
   - E cannot be in position 5 (from arose).

So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5, and E must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Remaining common letters not yet tested: B, C, D, F, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y.

We need a word that:
- Contains R and E
- Uses only letters from the allowed set
- Satisfies the position constraints
- Uses new letters to maximize information

Candidate words:
- ""nerve"" – E is in 2, R in 4. Valid positions, but uses N, V (new).
- ""crepe"" – E at 4, R at 3. Valid positions, uses C, P (new).
- ""perky"" – K, Y new, but R at 3, E at 2. Valid.
- ""burge"" – B, U new, but G is already excluded.
- ""prune"" – P, U, N new, R at 3, E at 5 – invalid (E at 5).

""nerve"" seems good: N, V untested, R at 4, E at 2 (both positions allowed).

But let’s check ""perky"": P, K, Y new, R at 3, E at 2 – also good.

Actually ""nerve"" is better because N and V are very common and will give more info.

So: nerve

Let's parse the new feedback on ""nerve"":

- N(x) → N is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2).
- R(-) → R is in the word but NOT in position 3 (it was at position 3 in ""nerve"").
- V(-) → V is in the word but in the wrong position (position 4).
- E(-) → The last E is in the word but in the wrong position (position 5).

So far we know:
- E is fixed at position 2.
- R, V, and E (the second one) must appear somewhere, but:
  - R cannot be at positions 1, 2, or 3.
  - V cannot be at position 4.
  - The E that was at position 5 must appear somewhere else (but position 2 is taken by E, so it must be at 1, 3, or 4).
- Letters definitely absent: A, O, S, I, G, H, T, N.

Positions:
1: unknown, could be R, V, or E (but E is at 2)
2: E (fixed)
3: unknown, could be R or V or E (but E is at 2, and R cannot be here)
4: unknown, could be R or V or E (but R cannot be here, and V cannot be here)
5: unknown, must be the remaining E or V.

But R cannot be at positions 1, 2, 3. So R must be at 4 or 5.
V cannot be at 4, and must appear somewhere, so V must be at 1 or 3 or 5.
E must appear once more (since we have two E's in the feedback), and it cannot be at 2 or 5 (for the second E), so it must be at 1 or 3 or 4.

But position 2 is already E, and the secret word is 5 letters, so it's possible the word has only one E (the ✓ one), but the feedback shows two E's, which might indicate the word has at least two E's. However, standard Wordle rules give one ✓ for correct position and one - for elsewhere, so the word likely has only one E (at position 2), and the second E in the feedback is just showing the letter exists elsewhere but not in position 5.

This is a bit ambiguous, but following standard rules, we'll assume the word has only one E at position 2, and the second E in the feedback is just indicating the letter exists elsewhere but not in position 5 (which is already taken by the ✓ E).

So we have:
- E at position 2
- R, V must appear somewhere
- R cannot be at 1,2,3 → must be at 4 or 5
- V cannot be at 4 → must be at 1,3, or 5
- Letters used so far: E, R, V
- Allowed letters: remaining common ones excluding the banned set.

Possible combinations:
If R is at 4:
- Then V must be at 1 or 3 or 5
- E is at 2
- We need to fill the remaining position with allowed letters.

Possible word: V E R _ _ or _ E V R _ or _ E _ R V
But we need 5 letters, so let's think of words fitting these patterns.

Looking at common letters left: B, C, D, F, K, L, M, P, U, W, Y, etc.

One candidate: ""lever"" – but L is allowed, E at 2, V at 3, R at 4, E at 5 – but E at 5 is invalid (from arose feedback). So no.

Another: ""bever"" – B, E at 2, V at 3, E at 4, R at 5 – but E at 4 is allowed (not at 5), but we have E at 2 and 4, which might be possible.

But let's think of a word with R at 4 or 5 and V elsewhere.

Consider ""perky"" – but P, K, Y are new, but R is at 3 which is invalid.

Wait, let's think systematically:
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
- 2 is E
- R must be at 4 or 5
- V must be at 1,3, or 5 (but not 4)
- No A, O, S, I, G, H, T, N

Possible patterns:
1. V _ R _ E: but E is at 2, so V E R _ _ – but then where does the second E go?
2. _ E V R _: but then E is at 2, R at 4, V at 3, and we need a letter for 1 and 5.
3. _ E _ R V: E at 2, R at 4, V at 5, and we need a letter for 1 and 3.
4. V E _ R _: E at 2, R at 4, V at 1, need letters for 3 and 5.
5. _ E R V _: but R cannot be at 3.

Looking at pattern 3: _ E _ R V
We have E at 2, R at 4, V at 5.
Need letters for 1 and 3 from allowed set: B, C, D, F, K, L, M, P, U, W, Y.

Possible word: ""mercy"" – but C, Y are allowed, but R is at 4, V at 5 – no, this doesn't fit.

Wait, we need to have V at 5, R at 4, E at 2, and letters 1 and 3 filled.

Possible: ""bervy"" – but Y is allowed, B is allowed, but this seems obscure.

Another: ""feral"" – but A is banned, so no.

Pattern 2: _ E V R _
E at 2, V at 3, R at 4, need 1 and 5.
Letters: B, C, D, F, K, L, M, P, U, W, Y.

Possible: ""c e v r y"" – but not a word.

Pattern 4: V E _ R _
E at 2, R at 4, V at 1, need 3 and 5.
Letters: B, C, D, F, K, L, M, P, U, W, Y.

Possible: V E L R Y – ""velry"" – not a word.

This is tricky. Let's try pattern 3 with different letters:
_ E _ R V
E at 2, R at 4, V at 5.
Need 1 and 3.

Possible: ""d e b r v"" – no.

Wait, let's think of actual words:
- ""rever"" – but E is at 2, R at 3 is invalid.
- ""lever"" – E at 2, V at 3, E at 4, R at 5 – but E at 4 is allowed, and R at 5 is allowed (since R cannot be at 1,2,3, so 5 is ok).
But ""lever"" has E at 2 and 4, which might be acceptable given the feedback.

But ""lever"" uses L which is allowed, and fits:
- E at 2 (correct)
- R at 5 (allowed)
- V at 3 (allowed)
- E at 4 (allowed, since it's not at 5)
- L at 1 (new letter)

This seems to fit all constraints.

So the next guess is ""lever"".
</think>

Based on the updated feedback, we now know:
- E is fixed at position 2.
- R must appear somewhere, but cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 → must be at 4 or 5.
- V must appear somewhere, but cannot be at 4 → must be at 1, 3, or 5.
- Letters definitely absent: A, O, S, I, G, H, T, N.

The word ""lever"" fits all these constraints:
- E at position 2 (✓)
- R at position 5 (allowed)
- V at position 3 (allowed)
- L and E at positions 1 and 4 (L is new, second E is allowed since it's not at position 5)

4. V E _ R _: E at 2, R at 4, V at 1, need letters for 3 and 5.
5. _ E R V _: but R cannot be at 3.

Looking at pattern 3: _ E _ R V
We have E at 2, R at 4, V at 5.
Need letters for 1 and 3 from allowed set: B, C, D, F, K, L, M, P, U, W, Y.

Possible word: ""mercy"" – but C, Y are allowed, but R is at 4, V at 5 – no, this doesn't fit.

Wait, we need to have V at 5, R at 4, E at 2, and letters 1 and 3 filled.
