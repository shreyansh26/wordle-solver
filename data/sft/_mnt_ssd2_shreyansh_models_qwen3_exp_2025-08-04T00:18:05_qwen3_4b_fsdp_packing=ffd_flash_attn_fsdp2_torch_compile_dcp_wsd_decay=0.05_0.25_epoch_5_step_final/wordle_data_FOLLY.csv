- Has O in the 2nd spot.  
- Uses only the still-allowed letters.  

Candidate words:
- CONIC (but C is repeated, and N, I, C are allowed) – but O is in position 2.  
- FOCAL – F, O, C, A, L – but A is banned.  
- HOMER – H, O, M, E, R – but E and R are banned.  
- JONES – J, O, N, E, S – but E, S are banned.  
- LION – only 4 letters.  
- MONGO – M, O, N, G, O – O is in position 2, but G is allowed, M, N are allowed.  
- PONGY – P, O, N, G, Y – all letters allowed, O in position 2.

A good, common word that fits is “MONGO” or “PONGY”.  
“MONGO” uses M, N, G (all still allowed) and repeats O in position 2.

Let’s go with MONGO.

   – Second O (-) means there is another O elsewhere in the word (but not in position 4).

So the secret word:
- Must have O in position 2.  
- Must contain one more O somewhere else (positions 1, 3, or 5).  
- May NOT contain: A, D, E, M, N, R, S, T, U, B, G.

Allowed letters left: C, F, H, I, J, K, L, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
We need a 5-letter word with pattern: [allowed] O [allowed] [allowed] [allowed], plus one additional O elsewhere.

Possible patterns:
- O O _ _ _ (but position 1 O is allowed)  
- _ O _ O _

Looking for common words:
- COOKY – C, O, O, K, Y – has two O’s, one in position 2, one in position 3.

- POOCH – P, O, O, C, H – two O’s, C, H allowed.

COOKY and POOCH both fit the constraints. COOKY seems slightly more common.

Let’s check COOKY:
- Letters: C, O, O, K, Y

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most common starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives me good coverage of frequent letters and positions. However, another strong option is ""CRANE"" or ""AROSE"". 

After considering these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), which should provide good information about letter positions and presence/absence.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains O, but not in position 3.
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O somewhere (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
2. Avoids A, R, S, E.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left to try: I, U (since A and E are out, O is already in).

Possible candidates:
- DOUBT (has O in position 2, uses B, U, T, D)
- CLOUT (has O in position 4, uses C, L, U, T)
- MOUND (has O in position 2, uses M, U, N, D)

DOUBT seems strong because:
- O is in position 2 (different from position 3 in AROSE)
- Uses common letters D, U, B, T
- Avoids all eliminated letters (A, R, S, E)

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   – Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E  
   – O is in the word but NOT in position 3.

   – Letters NOT in the word: D, U, B, T (in addition to A, R, S, E)  
   – O is now confirmed in position 2 (✓).

So the secret word:
- Must have O in position 2.  
- May NOT contain: A, D, R, S, T, U, B, E.

Remaining consonants we haven’t ruled out: C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I, Y (O is already used, A, E, U are out).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in the 2nd spot.  
- Uses only the still-allowed letters.  

Candidate words:
- CONIC (but C is repeated, and N, I, C are allowed) – but O is in position 2.  
- FOCAL – F, O, C, A, L – but A is banned.  
- HOMER – H, O, M, E, R – but E and R are banned.  
- JONES – J, O, N, E, S – but E, S are banned.  
- LION – only 4 letters.  
- MONGO – M, O, N, G, O – O is in position 2, but G is allowed, M, N are allowed.  
- PONGY – P, O, N, G, Y – all letters allowed, O in position 2.

A good, common word that fits is “MONGO” or “PONGY”.  
“MONGO” uses M, N, G (all still allowed) and repeats O in position 2.

4. COOKY → C(x) O(✓) O(-) K(x) Y(✓)

   – O in position 2 is confirmed again.  
   – Second O (-) means there is another O, but not in position 3.  
   – Y is confirmed in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Pattern: _ O _ _ Y  
- Must contain one more O somewhere in positions 1, 4, or 5 (but position 5 is already Y, so positions 1 or 4).  
- Eliminated letters so far: A, R, S, E, D, U, B, T, M, N, G, C, K  
- Allowed letters: F, H, I, J, L, P, V, W, Z (and O, Y are already used).

We need a word of the form:
- O O _ _ Y  (if O is in position 1)  
- _ O _ O Y  (if O is in position 4)

Looking for common 5-letter words:
- OO...Y: “OOLLY” – but L is allowed, double O is possible.  
- _ O _ O Y: “FOOLY” – F, L are allowed.  
- “POOLY” – P, L allowed.  
- “WOOLY” – W, L allowed.

Among these, “POOLY” is a valid English word and uses P (allowed), O (needed), L (allowed), Y (confirmed).

Check constraints:
- Pattern: P O _ O Y → fits _ O _ O Y.  
- All letters P, O, L, Y are allowed.  
- Meets the requirement of having two O’s (one in position 2, one in position 4).

Therefore, POOLY is the best next guess.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most common starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives me good coverage of frequent letters and positions. However, another strong option is ""CRANE"" or ""AROSE"". 

After considering these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), which should provide good information about letter positions and presence/absence.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains O, but not in position 3.
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O somewhere (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
2. Avoids A, R, S, E.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left to try: I, U (since A and E are out, O is already in).

Possible candidates:
- DOUBT (has O in position 2, uses B, U, T, D)
- CLOUT (has O in position 4, uses C, L, U, T)
- MOUND (has O in position 2, uses M, U, N, D)

DOUBT seems strong because:
- O is in position 2 (different from position 3 in AROSE)
- Uses common letters D, U, B, T
- Avoids all eliminated letters (A, R, S, E)

Guess 2: DOUBT -> FEEDBACK: D(x) O(✓) U(x) B(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   – Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E  
   – O is in the word but NOT in position 3.

2. DOUBT → D(x) O(✓) U(x) B(x) T(x)  
   – Letters NOT in the word: D, U, B, T (in addition to A, R, S, E)  
   – O is now confirmed in position 2 (✓).

So the secret word:
- Must have O in position 2.  
- May NOT contain: A, D, R, S, T, U, B, E.

Remaining consonants we haven’t ruled out: C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I, Y (O is already used, A, E, U are out).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in the 2nd spot.  
- Uses only the still-allowed letters.  

Candidate words:
- CONIC (but C is repeated, and N, I, C are allowed) – but O is in position 2.  
- FOCAL – F, O, C, A, L – but A is banned.  
- HOMER – H, O, M, E, R – but E and R are banned.  
- JONES – J, O, N, E, S – but E, S are banned.  
- LION – only 4 letters.  
- MONGO – M, O, N, G, O – O is in position 2, but G is allowed, M, N are allowed.  
- PONGY – P, O, N, G, Y – all letters allowed, O in position 2.

A good, common word that fits is “MONGO” or “PONGY”.  
“MONGO” uses M, N, G (all still allowed) and repeats O in position 2.

Let’s go with MONGO.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   – Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E  
   – O is in the word but NOT in position 3.

2. DOUBT → D(x) O(✓) U(x) B(x) T(x)  
   – Letters NOT in the word: D, U, B, T  
   – O is confirmed in position 2.

3. MONGO → M(x) O(✓) N(x) G(x) O(-)  
   – Letters NOT in the word: M, N, G  
   – First O is confirmed in position 2 (already known).  
   – Second O (-) means there is another O elsewhere in the word (but not in position 4).

So the secret word:
- Must have O in position 2.  
- Must contain one more O somewhere else (positions 1, 3, or 5).  
- May NOT contain: A, D, E, M, N, R, S, T, U, B, G.

Allowed letters left: C, F, H, I, J, K, L, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
We need a 5-letter word with pattern: [allowed] O [allowed] [allowed] [allowed], plus one additional O elsewhere.

Possible patterns:
- O O _ _ _ (but position 1 O is allowed)  
- _ O _ O _  
- _ O _ _ O  

Looking for common words:
- COOKY – C, O, O, K, Y – has two O’s, one in position 2, one in position 3.  
  Letters: C, K, Y are allowed.  
- FOOLY – F, O, O, L, Y – same pattern.  
- HOOHY – H, O, O, H, Y – but H is repeated.  
- JOCKY – J, O, C, K, Y – only one O, so invalid.  
- POOCH – P, O, O, C, H – two O’s, C, H allowed.

COOKY and POOCH both fit the constraints. COOKY seems slightly more common.

Let’s check COOKY:
- Letters: C, O, O, K, Y  
- O in position 2 (✓)  
- Second O in position 3 (allowed, since position 3 was only ruled out in AROSE, but MONGO didn’t test position 3 for O)  
- All other letters (C, K, Y) are allowed.

Therefore, COOKY is a valid next guess.

From the five rounds we now have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   – Eliminated: A, R, S, E  
   – O is in the word, but not in position 3.

2. DOUBT → D(x) O(✓) U(x) B(x) T(x)  
   – Eliminated: D, U, B, T  
   – O is fixed in position 2.

3. MONGO → M(x) O(✓) N(x) G(x) O(-)  
   – Eliminated: M, N, G  
   – Second O is not in position 3 (already known).

4. COOKY → C(x) O(✓) O(-) K(x) Y(✓)  
   – Eliminated: C, K  
   – Y is fixed in position 5.

5. POOLY → P(x) O(✓) O(-) L(✓) Y(✓)  
   – Eliminated: P  
   – L is fixed in position 4.

So the pattern is now completely determined:
- Position 2: O  
- Position 5: Y  
- Position 4: L  
- Second O must be in position 1 (cannot be 3 or 4, and 5 is Y).

Therefore the word must be O O _ O Y.

Allowed letters left (never eliminated): F, H, I, J, V, W, Z  
We need a single letter in position 3 that makes a valid 5-letter word.

Possible words:
- OOFOY – not valid  
- OOIOY – not valid  
- OOJOY – not valid  
- OOVOY – not valid  
- OOHOY – not valid  
- OOVOY – not valid  
- OOZOY – not valid  
- OOPIY – but P is eliminated  
- OOHIY – not valid  
- OOVIY – not valid  
- OOJIY – not valid  
- OOY… – already 5 letters

Wait, let’s list actual English 5-letter words that fit O O _ O Y:

- OOLAY – but L is already in position 4  
- OOPLY – P is eliminated  
- OOZY – too short  
- OOCHY – C is eliminated  
- OOGLY – G is eliminated  
- OOELY – E is eliminated  
- OOFLY – F is allowed, but is “OOFLY” a word? No.  
- OOPIE – E is eliminated  
- OOPIY – P is eliminated  
- OOHIY – not a word  
- OOVIY – not a word  
- OOZOY – not a word  
- OOJOY – not a word  
- OOFOY – not a word  
- OOICOY – too long  
- OOIBI – not a word  

Realizing that very few English words fit O O _ O Y. The only common one is “OOLAY” but that would require L in position 3 and 4, which is impossible. Next possibility is “OOLAY” is invalid because L is already in 4.

Re-examining: perhaps I mis-assumed position of second O. Second O cannot be 3 (from AROSE), cannot be 4 (from COOKY/POOLY), and cannot be 5 (Y). So second O must be position 1.

Thus the word must be O O _ O Y. The only letter left to determine is position 3, and the only remaining valid letter that forms a real word is I, giving OOIOY, but that’s not a word.

Realizing that perhaps no common word fits, but “OOLAY” is closest but conflicts with L already in 4. Next possibility is “OOLAY” is invalid.

Looking again, the only valid English word that fits O O _ O Y is “OOLAY” – but it’s 5 letters and has L in 3 and 4, which is impossible.

Realizing mistake: the pattern is actually _ O O _ Y, not O O _ _ Y. Because:

- Position 2: O (fixed)  
- Position 5: Y (fixed)  
- Position 4: L (fixed)  
- Second O must be in position 3 (since it cannot be 4 or 5, and 2 is already O).

Thus the pattern is _ O O L Y.

Allowed letters for position 1: F, H, I, J, V, W, Z.

Possible words:
- FOOLY – F is allowed, L is allowed, O is allowed, Y is allowed.  
- HOOLY – H is allowed.  
- IOOLY – not a word.  
- JOOLY – not a word.  
- VOOLY – not a word.  
- WOOLY – W is allowed.  
- ZOOLY – not a word.

Among these, FOOLY and WOOLY are valid English words. FOOLY is more common.

Thus the correct next guess is FOOLY.
