### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. Some popular starting words include:

- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- ADIEU (heavy on vowels)
- RAISE (good mix of common letters)

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that incorporates several of these. ""AROSE"" is a great choice because it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. However, it has three vowels (A, O, E) which might be useful, but I want to include more consonants as well.

Another strong candidate is ""RAISE"" - R, A, I, S, E. This covers the top 5 most common letters according to some frequency lists. It has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as my first guess because it uses five very common letters and gives good coverage for both vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R(x) → R is NOT in the word.
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at position 2).
- I(x) → I is NOT in the word.
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains the letter A, but not in position 2.
- The word does NOT contain R, I, S, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A (but not in position 2).
2. Does NOT contain R, I, S, E.

Good letters to try next (common ones not yet eliminated): T, N, L, C, O, U, D, P, M, etc.

Possible candidates:
- TONAL (has A, no R/I/S/E) but A is at position 4, which is allowed.
- CANTO (has A, no R/I/S/E) but A is at position 2, which is disallowed.
- PLANT (has A, no R/I/S/E) but A is at position 2, disallowed.
- MOUNT (has O and U, but no A, so not useful).
- COBALT (too long).
- LACTIC (has A, no R/I/S/E) but A is at position 2, disallowed.

Looking for words with A not in position 2:
- A could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Let's try ""TALON"":
- T, A, L, O, N
- Contains A (position 2) → but this is disallowed (A was wrong position in RAISE).
Wait, no - in RAISE, A was at position 2 and marked as wrong position, so A cannot be at position 2. So ""TALON"" is invalid.

Next idea: ""PLANK"":
- P, L, A, N, K
- A is at position 3 → allowed.
- Does not contain R, I, S, E.

This seems good.

Another option: ""CANTO"" - but A is at position 2, disallowed.
""ANVIL"" - A at position 1, but contains I (disallowed).
""ALLOY"" - A at position 1, contains O, L, L, Y - no R/I/S/E.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)

   - L is in the correct position (position 2).
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (it was at position 3 in PLANK, so it must be elsewhere).

So far we know:
- Letters definitely absent: R, I, S, E, P, N.
- Letters definitely present: A and L (with L fixed at position 2).
- A must appear somewhere other than positions 2 or 3.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- L as the second letter.
- A somewhere else (positions 1, 4, or 5).
- No other letters from {R, I, S, E, P, N}.

Available letters to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc.

Possible patterns:
- A L _ _ _  (A at 1)
- _ L _ _ A  (A at 5)
- _ L _ A _  (A at 4)

Looking for common words:
- A L _ _ _ → ""ALONE"" (O allowed, but E is forbidden) → invalid.
- ""ALLOY"" has O and Y, but double L and O might be okay, but let's see if we can find better.
- _ L _ A _ → ""BLADE"" has E (invalid), ""CLAMP"" has P (invalid), ""FLANK"" has N (invalid).
- _ L _ _ A → ""CLOAK"" has O, K, but C, O, K are allowed.
- ""CLOAK"" fits:
   - C, L, O, A, K.
   - L is at position 2 (correct).
   - A is at position 4 (allowed).
   - No forbidden letters (R,I,S,E,P,N).

   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (it was at position 3 in PLANK, so it must be elsewhere).

So far we know:
- Letters definitely absent: R, I, S, E, P, N.
- Letters definitely present: A and L (with L fixed at position 2).
- A must appear somewhere other than positions 2 or 3.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- L as the second letter.
- A somewhere else (positions 1, 4, or 5).
- No other letters from {R, I, S, E, P, N}.

Available letters to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc.

Possible patterns:
- A L _ _ _  (A at 1)
- _ L _ _ A  (A at 5)
- _ L _ A _  (A at 4)

Looking for common words:
- A L _ _ _ → ""ALONE"" (O allowed, but E is forbidden) → invalid.
- ""ALLOY"" has O and Y, but double L and O might be okay, but let's see if we can find better.
- _ L _ A _ → ""BLADE"" has E (invalid), ""CLAMP"" has P (invalid), ""FLANK"" has N (invalid).
- _ L _ _ A → ""CLOAK"" has O, K, but C, O, K are allowed.
- ""CLOAK"" fits:
   - C, L, O, A, K.
   - L is at position 2 (correct).
   - A is at position 4 (allowed).
   - No forbidden letters (R,I,S,E,P,N).

Another option: ""GLOAT"" (G, L, O, A, T) - also valid.
But ""CLOAK"" uses O and K which we haven't tested yet.

Let's go with CLOAK.",Guess 3: CLOAK -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) L(✓) O(✓) A(✓) K(✓),SUCCESS
