For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""RAISE"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" covers S, L, A, T, E - good coverage of common letters.
- ""CRANE"" covers C, R, A, N, E - similar rationale.
- ""ADIEU"" is heavy on vowels but lacks many consonants.
- ""RAISE"" covers R, A, I, S, E - good mix.

""RAISE"" seems particularly strong because it includes:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (another common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word at all: R, I, S, E, P, L, N, T
2. Letter A is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3 or 4 (from RAISE and PLANT feedback).
   Therefore A must be in position 1 or 5.
3. We still need to test common consonants that have not been eliminated: C, D, G, H, K, M, B, F, etc.
4. We still need to test vowels that have not been eliminated: O, U, Y (and A is already confirmed).

Let’s aim for a word that:
- Places A in position 1 or 5
- Introduces new common consonants
- Avoids all eliminated letters

Candidate words:
- A _ _ _ _  (A in position 1) – e.g., ADORE (but R,E eliminated), AMBIT (T eliminated), AMUCK (good letters but U/K)
- _ _ _ _ A  (A in position 5) – e.g., BLOAT (T eliminated), CLOAK (good letters), GLOAT (good letters)

“AMUCK” is invalid because U and C are fine, but M is already tested in PLANT (M not tested yet, actually). Wait, M wasn’t in PLANT, so AMUCK is possible, but let’s check:
- A (position 1) – allowed
- M, U, C, K – all new letters
But U is a vowel we haven’t tested yet.

“CLOAK”:
- C, L (eliminated), O, A (position 4, but A must not be in 4), K – invalid.

“GLOAT”:
- G, L (eliminated), O, A (position 4, invalid), T (eliminated) – invalid.

“MADAM” – A in position 2 is invalid (A not in 2).

“MOUNT” – T eliminated.

“FOCAL” – L eliminated.

“HUMID” – I eliminated.

“BOGUS” – S eliminated.

“GUMMY” – M, U, Y are new, but A not present (we know A is in the word), so invalid.

“GUMMY” is out because A must be present.

Let’s try “AMUCK”:
- A (position 1) – allowed
- M, U, C, K – all new letters
This seems valid.

But let’s verify:
- A is in position 1 – satisfies “A is in word but not in positions 2,3,4”
- M, U, C, K – none of these were eliminated
- No R, I, S, E, P, L, N, T

So AMUCK is a valid next guess.

Alternatively, “MADAM” is invalid as noted.

Another option: “AFOUL” – A in position 1, F, O, U, L. L eliminated.

“ACUTE” – E eliminated.

“AMBIT” – T eliminated.

“AGONY” – N, Y – N not eliminated, but T was eliminated, N wasn’t tested yet. Wait, N was in PLANT (N eliminated). So N is out.

“AGONY” has N – invalid.

“ACUTE” – E eliminated.

“ABODE” – B, O, D, E. E eliminated.

“ABHOR” – R eliminated.

“ABUZZ” – Z not common.

“AGAVE” – E eliminated.

“AGLOW” – G, L (eliminated), O, W. L eliminated.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""RAISE"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" covers S, L, A, T, E - good coverage of common letters.
- ""CRANE"" covers C, R, A, N, E - similar rationale.
- ""ADIEU"" is heavy on vowels but lacks many consonants.
- ""RAISE"" covers R, A, I, S, E - good mix.

""RAISE"" seems particularly strong because it includes:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (another common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

- I: x → not in the word
- S: x → not in the word
- E: x → not in the word

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain R, I, S, E
- DOES contain A, but not in position 2
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels

Next, I’ll look for a word that:
1. Keeps the known letter A (but moves it away from position 2)
2. Introduces new common letters we haven’t tested yet
3. Avoids R, I, S, E entirely

Good candidates:
- PLANT: P, L, N, T plus A in position 4
- CHALK: C, H, L, K plus A in position 3
- GLOAM: G, L, O, M plus A in position 5

""PLANT"" seems solid:
- Tests P, L, N, T (common consonants)
- Moves A to position 4
- No reused letters from the forbidden set (R, I, S, E)

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word at all: R, I, S, E, P, L, N, T
2. Letter A is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3 or 4 (from RAISE and PLANT feedback).
   Therefore A must be in position 1 or 5.
3. We still need to test common consonants that have not been eliminated: C, D, G, H, K, M, B, F, etc.
4. We still need to test vowels that have not been eliminated: O, U, Y (and A is already confirmed).

Let’s aim for a word that:
- Places A in position 1 or 5
- Introduces new common consonants
- Avoids all eliminated letters

Candidate words:
- A _ _ _ _  (A in position 1) – e.g., ADORE (but R,E eliminated), AMBIT (T eliminated), AMUCK (good letters but U/K)
- _ _ _ _ A  (A in position 5) – e.g., BLOAT (T eliminated), CLOAK (good letters), GLOAT (good letters)

“AMUCK” is invalid because U and C are fine, but M is already tested in PLANT (M not tested yet, actually). Wait, M wasn’t in PLANT, so AMUCK is possible, but let’s check:
- A (position 1) – allowed
- M, U, C, K – all new letters
But U is a vowel we haven’t tested yet.

“CLOAK”:
- C, L (eliminated), O, A (position 4, but A must not be in 4), K – invalid.

“GLOAT”:
- G, L (eliminated), O, A (position 4, invalid), T (eliminated) – invalid.

“MADAM” – A in position 2 is invalid (A not in 2).

“MOUNT” – T eliminated.

“FOCAL” – L eliminated.

“HUMID” – I eliminated.

“BOGUS” – S eliminated.

“GUMMY” – M, U, Y are new, but A not present (we know A is in the word), so invalid.

“GUMMY” is out because A must be present.

Let’s try “AMUCK”:
- A (position 1) – allowed
- M, U, C, K – all new letters
This seems valid.

But let’s verify:
- A is in position 1 – satisfies “A is in word but not in positions 2,3,4”
- M, U, C, K – none of these were eliminated
- No R, I, S, E, P, L, N, T

So AMUCK is a valid next guess.

Alternatively, “MADAM” is invalid as noted.

Another option: “AFOUL” – A in position 1, F, O, U, L. L eliminated.

“ACUTE” – E eliminated.

“AMBIT” – T eliminated.

“AGONY” – N, Y – N not eliminated, but T was eliminated, N wasn’t tested yet. Wait, N was in PLANT (N eliminated). So N is out.

“AGONY” has N – invalid.

“ACUTE” – E eliminated.

“ABODE” – B, O, D, E. E eliminated.

“ABHOR” – R eliminated.

“ABUZZ” – Z not common.

“AGAVE” – E eliminated.

“AGLOW” – G, L (eliminated), O, W. L eliminated.

“AMUCK” still looks best.

But let’s check if M is eliminated – no, M wasn’t in PLANT feedback.

So AMUCK is the strongest candidate.

From all feedback so far:

1. Letters NOT in the word: R, I, S, E, P, L, T, U, K
2. Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are unknown: A, M, C
3. Position constraints we have:
   - A is not in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (from RAISE: not 2; from PLANT: not 3; from AMUCK: not 1).  
     Therefore A must be in position 5.
   - M is not in position 2 (from AMUCK).  
     Possible positions for M: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but 5 is now locked to A), so 1, 3, or 4.
   - C is not in position 4 (from AMUCK).  
     Possible positions for C: 1, 2, 3, 5 (but 5 is A), so 1, 2, or 3.

Check constraints:

- M in 1 (not 2): ✓
- C in 3 (not 4): ✓
- Letters used: M, O, C, H, A – none are eliminated.

""MOCHA"" seems perfect.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""RAISE"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" covers S, L, A, T, E - good coverage of common letters.
- ""CRANE"" covers C, R, A, N, E - similar rationale.
- ""ADIEU"" is heavy on vowels but lacks many consonants.
- ""RAISE"" covers R, A, I, S, E - good mix.

""RAISE"" seems particularly strong because it includes:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (another common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

From the feedback so far:

1. Letters NOT in the word: R, I, S, E, P, L, T, U, K, H
2. Letters known to be in the word: A, M, C, O
   - A is confirmed in position 5 (from MOCHA feedback: A(✓))
   - O is confirmed in position 2 (from MOCHA feedback: O(✓))
   - M is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (from previous and MOCHA feedback: M(-) in positions 1 and 3)
     Therefore M must be in position 4
   - C is in the word but not in positions 3, 4, 5 (from previous and MOCHA feedback: C(-) in positions 3 and 4)
     Therefore C must be in position 1

So the word structure is now: C O _ M A

We need to fill position 3 with a letter that has not been eliminated.  
Eliminated letters: R, I, S, E, P, L, T, U, K, H  
Remaining possible letters: B, D, F, G, J, N, V, W, Y, Z, Q (but Q is unlikely in 5-letter words)

Looking at common letters, the most likely candidates are B, D, N, G, V, etc.

Possible words:  
- COBMA – invalid  
- CODMA – invalid  
- CONMA – invalid  
- COGMA – invalid  
- COVMA – invalid  

Wait, let's think of actual English words that fit C O _ M A.

The only common word that fits is ""COMMA"" – but we have M already in position 4, so this would have two M's, which is impossible since each letter is used only once.

Hmm, maybe we missed something. Let me re-examine the constraints.

Actually, the word must be C O _ M A with the blank being any unused letter. The only common letter left that makes a valid word is N, forming C O N M A – but ""CONMA"" is not a valid English word.

Looking back, perhaps I made an error in deducing positions. Let me re-examine:

From MOCHA feedback:
- M(-) – M is in word but not position 1
- O(✓) – O is in word and position 2
- C(-) – C is in word but not position 3
- H(x) – H not in word
- A(✓) – A is in word and position 5

From previous feedback:
- A(-) in AMUCK meant A is not in position 1
- A(-) in PLANT meant A is not in position 3
- A(-) in RAISE meant A is not in position 2
So A must be in position 4 or 5. But MOCHA shows A is in position 5, so that's fixed.

O is confirmed in position 2.

M is in word but not positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (from M(-) in MOCHA, M(-) in AMUCK, M(-) in PLANT, and M(-) in AMUCK again). Wait, actually:

- AMUCK: M(-) – M not in position 2
- PLANT: L(x), but M wasn't tested in PLANT
- RAISE: R(x), but M wasn't tested in RAISE
- MOCHA: M(-) – M not in position 1

So M is not in positions 1 or 2. It could be 3 or 4.

Similarly, C is in word but not positions 3, 4 (from PLANT: C wasn't tested, but AMUCK: C(-) not position 3, MOCHA: C(-) not position 3). Wait:

- AMUCK: C(-) – C not in position 4
- MOCHA: C(-) – C not in position 3

So C is not in positions 3 or 4. It must be 1 or 2. But O is in position 2, so C must be in position 1.

So structure is C O _ _ A with M somewhere in 3 or 4.

Now, M is not in position 2 (O is there) and must be in 3 or 4.

So possible structures:
- C O M _ A
- C O _ M A

We need to fill the blank with an unused letter.

Unused letters: B, D, F, G, J, N, V, W, Y, Z, Q

Looking for valid English words:

- COMRA – invalid
- CONGA – but G is possible, but A is already 5
- COBMA – invalid
- CODMA – invalid
- COVMA – invalid
- COFMA – invalid
- COYMA – invalid

Wait, let's think of actual words:

- CONGA – fits C O N G A, but we have A fixed at 5, so CONGA would be C O N G A – but G is allowed.

But we have to check if N and G are unused. Yes, they are.

But we have to ensure we're using only the known letters (C, O, M, A) plus one new letter.

Actually, the word must use C, O, M, A plus one more letter from the remaining pool.

But looking at valid words:

- CONGA – uses C, O, N, G, A – but we know A is only in position 5, so this could fit if N and G are new.

But we have no information about N or G yet.

Another possibility: COBMA – invalid.

COMMA – but has two M's – impossible.

COBRA – but R is eliminated.

CONGA – seems possible.

Another: COGMA – invalid.

COVMA – invalid.

So CONGA seems to be the only valid word left.

But let me check if there are others:

- COBMA – invalid
- CODMA – invalid
- COFMA – invalid
- COYMA – invalid
- COZMA – invalid

CONGA appears to be the only valid English word left that fits all constraints.

Thus, the next guess should be CONGA.
</think>

Based on the latest feedback, we now know:
- The word ends in ""A"" (position 5)
- ""O"" is in position 2
- ""C"" must be in position 1 (since it can't be in 3 or 4 and 2 is O)
- ""M"" must be in position 3 or 4
- Position 4 must be filled with a new letter not yet eliminated

The only valid word fitting these constraints is ""CONGA"".

<guess>CONGA</guess>",CONGA,"From the feedback so far:

1. Letters NOT in the word: R, I, S, E, P, L, T, U, K, H
2. Letters known to be in the word: A, M, C, O

   - O is confirmed in position 2 (from MOCHA feedback: O(✓))
   - M is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (from previous and MOCHA feedback: M(-) in positions 1 and 3)
     Therefore M must be in position 4
   - C is in the word but not in positions 3, 4, 5 (from previous and MOCHA feedback: C(-) in positions 3 and 4)
     Therefore C must be in position 1

So the word structure is now: C O _ M A

We need to fill position 3 with a letter that has not been eliminated.

- O(✓) – O is in word and position 2
- C(-) – C is in word but not position 3
- H(x) – H not in word
- A(✓) – A is in word and position 5

From previous feedback:
- A(-) in AMUCK meant A is not in position 1
- A(-) in PLANT meant A is not in position 3
- A(-) in RAISE meant A is not in position 2
So A must be in position 4 or 5. But MOCHA shows A is in position 5, so that's fixed.

O is confirmed in position 2.

M is in word but not positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (from M(-) in MOCHA, M(-) in AMUCK, M(-) in PLANT, and M(-) in AMUCK again). Wait, actually:

- AMUCK: M(-) – M not in position 2
- PLANT: L(x), but M wasn't tested in PLANT
- RAISE: R(x), but M wasn't tested in RAISE
- MOCHA: M(-) – M not in position 1

So M is not in positions 1 or 2. It could be 3 or 4.

Similarly, C is in word but not positions 3, 4 (from PLANT: C wasn't tested, but AMUCK: C(-) not position 3, MOCHA: C(-) not position 3). Wait:

- AMUCK: C(-) – C not in position 4
- MOCHA: C(-) – C not in position 3

So C is not in positions 3 or 4. It must be 1 or 2. But O is in position 2, so C must be in position 1.

So structure is C O _ _ A with M somewhere in 3 or 4.

Now, M is not in position 2 (O is there) and must be in 3 or 4.

So possible structures:
- C O M _ A
- C O _ M A

We need to fill the blank with an unused letter.

Unused letters: B, D, F, G, J, N, V, W, Y, Z, Q

- CODMA – invalid

- CONGA – fits C O N G A, but we have A fixed at 5, so CONGA would be C O N G A – but G is allowed.

But we have to check if N and G are unused. Yes, they are.

But we have to ensure we're using only the known letters (C, O, M, A) plus one new letter.

Actually, the word must use C, O, M, A plus one more letter from the remaining pool.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""RAISE"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" covers S, L, A, T, E - good coverage of common letters.
- ""CRANE"" covers C, R, A, N, E - similar rationale.
- ""ADIEU"" is heavy on vowels but lacks many consonants.
- ""RAISE"" covers R, A, I, S, E - good mix.

""RAISE"" seems particularly strong because it includes:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (another common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R: x → not in the word at all
- A: - → in the word, but not in position 2
- I: x → not in the word
- S: x → not in the word
- E: x → not in the word

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain R, I, S, E
- DOES contain A, but not in position 2
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels

Next, I’ll look for a word that:
1. Keeps the known letter A (but moves it away from position 2)
2. Introduces new common letters we haven’t tested yet
3. Avoids R, I, S, E entirely

Good candidates:
- PLANT: P, L, N, T plus A in position 4
- CHALK: C, H, L, K plus A in position 3
- GLOAM: G, L, O, M plus A in position 5

""PLANT"" seems solid:
- Tests P, L, N, T (common consonants)
- Moves A to position 4
- No reused letters from the forbidden set (R, I, S, E)

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word at all: R, I, S, E, P, L, N, T
2. Letter A is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3 or 4 (from RAISE and PLANT feedback).
   Therefore A must be in position 1 or 5.
3. We still need to test common consonants that have not been eliminated: C, D, G, H, K, M, B, F, etc.
4. We still need to test vowels that have not been eliminated: O, U, Y (and A is already confirmed).

Let’s aim for a word that:
- Places A in position 1 or 5
- Introduces new common consonants
- Avoids all eliminated letters

Candidate words:
- A _ _ _ _  (A in position 1) – e.g., ADORE (but R,E eliminated), AMBIT (T eliminated), AMUCK (good letters but U/K)
- _ _ _ _ A  (A in position 5) – e.g., BLOAT (T eliminated), CLOAK (good letters), GLOAT (good letters)

“AMUCK” is invalid because U and C are fine, but M is already tested in PLANT (M not tested yet, actually). Wait, M wasn’t in PLANT, so AMUCK is possible, but let’s check:
- A (position 1) – allowed
- M, U, C, K – all new letters
But U is a vowel we haven’t tested yet.

“CLOAK”:
- C, L (eliminated), O, A (position 4, but A must not be in 4), K – invalid.

“GLOAT”:
- G, L (eliminated), O, A (position 4, invalid), T (eliminated) – invalid.

“MADAM” – A in position 2 is invalid (A not in 2).

“MOUNT” – T eliminated.

“FOCAL” – L eliminated.

“HUMID” – I eliminated.

“BOGUS” – S eliminated.

“GUMMY” – M, U, Y are new, but A not present (we know A is in the word), so invalid.

“GUMMY” is out because A must be present.

Let’s try “AMUCK”:
- A (position 1) – allowed
- M, U, C, K – all new letters
This seems valid.

But let’s verify:
- A is in position 1 – satisfies “A is in word but not in positions 2,3,4”
- M, U, C, K – none of these were eliminated
- No R, I, S, E, P, L, N, T

So AMUCK is a valid next guess.

Alternatively, “MADAM” is invalid as noted.

Another option: “AFOUL” – A in position 1, F, O, U, L. L eliminated.

“ACUTE” – E eliminated.

“AMBIT” – T eliminated.

“AGONY” – N, Y – N not eliminated, but T was eliminated, N wasn’t tested yet. Wait, N was in PLANT (N eliminated). So N is out.

“AGONY” has N – invalid.

“ACUTE” – E eliminated.

“ABODE” – B, O, D, E. E eliminated.

“ABHOR” – R eliminated.

“ABUZZ” – Z not common.

“AGAVE” – E eliminated.

“AGLOW” – G, L (eliminated), O, W. L eliminated.

“AMUCK” still looks best.

But let’s check if M is eliminated – no, M wasn’t in PLANT feedback.

So AMUCK is the strongest candidate.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From all feedback so far:

1. Letters NOT in the word: R, I, S, E, P, L, T, U, K
2. Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are unknown: A, M, C
3. Position constraints we have:
   - A is not in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (from RAISE: not 2; from PLANT: not 3; from AMUCK: not 1).  
     Therefore A must be in position 5.
   - M is not in position 2 (from AMUCK).  
     Possible positions for M: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but 5 is now locked to A), so 1, 3, or 4.
   - C is not in position 4 (from AMUCK).  
     Possible positions for C: 1, 2, 3, 5 (but 5 is A), so 1, 2, or 3.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, M, C exactly once each
- Places A in position 5
- Places M somewhere other than position 2
- Places C somewhere other than position 4

Possible patterns: _ _ _ _ A

Let’s list valid placements:
- M can be in 1, 3, or 4
- C can be in 1, 2, or 3

We need to fill the remaining two slots with letters that have not been eliminated.  
Eliminated letters: R, I, S, E, P, L, T, U, K  
Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, N, V, W, Y, Z  
Vowels left: O

Let’s try to find a word that fits.

Option 1: M in 1, C in 3 → M _ C _ A
Need two letters for positions 2 and 4 from remaining pool.  
Example: M O C D A → ""MO CDA"" – invalid.  
Try M O C H A → ""MOCHA"" – valid word.

Check constraints:
- A in 5: ✓
- M in 1 (not 2): ✓
- C in 3 (not 4): ✓
- Letters used: M, O, C, H, A – none are eliminated.

""MOCHA"" seems perfect.

Alternative: C in 1, M in 3 → C _ M _ A
Need letters 2 and 4.  
Example: C R M B A – ""CRMBA"" – invalid.  
Try C H M B A – ""CHMBA"" – invalid.  
No valid common word here.

Another alternative: C in 2, M in 3 → _ C M _ A
Need letters 1 and 4.  
Example: B C M O A – ""BCM OA"" – invalid.  
Try G C M O A – ""GCM OA"" – invalid.

""MOCHA"" remains the best option.

Guess 4: MOCHA -> FEEDBACK: M(-) O(✓) C(-) H(x) A(✓)
<|im_end|>

From the feedback so far:

1. Letters NOT in the word: R, I, S, E, P, L, T, U, K, H
2. Letters known to be in the word: A, M, C, O
   - A is confirmed in position 5 (from MOCHA feedback: A(✓))
   - O is confirmed in position 2 (from MOCHA feedback: O(✓))
   - M is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (from previous and MOCHA feedback: M(-) in positions 1 and 3)
     Therefore M must be in position 4
   - C is in the word but not in positions 3, 4, 5 (from previous and MOCHA feedback: C(-) in positions 3 and 4)
     Therefore C must be in position 1

So the word structure is now: C O _ M A

We need to fill position 3 with a letter that has not been eliminated.  
Eliminated letters: R, I, S, E, P, L, T, U, K, H  
Remaining possible letters: B, D, F, G, J, N, V, W, Y, Z, Q (but Q is unlikely in 5-letter words)

Looking at common letters, the most likely candidates are B, D, N, G, V, etc.

Possible words:  
- COBMA – invalid  
- CODMA – invalid  
- CONMA – invalid  
- COGMA – invalid  
- COVMA – invalid  

Wait, let's think of actual English words that fit C O _ M A.

The only common word that fits is ""COMMA"" – but we have M already in position 4, so this would have two M's, which is impossible since each letter is used only once.

Hmm, maybe we missed something. Let me re-examine the constraints.

Actually, the word must be C O _ M A with the blank being any unused letter. The only common letter left that makes a valid word is N, forming C O N M A – but ""CONMA"" is not a valid English word.

Looking back, perhaps I made an error in deducing positions. Let me re-examine:

From MOCHA feedback:
- M(-) – M is in word but not position 1
- O(✓) – O is in word and position 2
- C(-) – C is in word but not position 3
- H(x) – H not in word
- A(✓) – A is in word and position 5

From previous feedback:
- A(-) in AMUCK meant A is not in position 1
- A(-) in PLANT meant A is not in position 3
- A(-) in RAISE meant A is not in position 2
So A must be in position 4 or 5. But MOCHA shows A is in position 5, so that's fixed.

O is confirmed in position 2.

M is in word but not positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (from M(-) in MOCHA, M(-) in AMUCK, M(-) in PLANT, and M(-) in AMUCK again). Wait, actually:

- AMUCK: M(-) – M not in position 2
- PLANT: L(x), but M wasn't tested in PLANT
- RAISE: R(x), but M wasn't tested in RAISE
- MOCHA: M(-) – M not in position 1

So M is not in positions 1 or 2. It could be 3 or 4.

Similarly, C is in word but not positions 3, 4 (from PLANT: C wasn't tested, but AMUCK: C(-) not position 3, MOCHA: C(-) not position 3). Wait:

- AMUCK: C(-) – C not in position 4
- MOCHA: C(-) – C not in position 3

So C is not in positions 3 or 4. It must be 1 or 2. But O is in position 2, so C must be in position 1.

So structure is C O _ _ A with M somewhere in 3 or 4.

Now, M is not in position 2 (O is there) and must be in 3 or 4.

So possible structures:
- C O M _ A
- C O _ M A

We need to fill the blank with an unused letter.

Unused letters: B, D, F, G, J, N, V, W, Y, Z, Q

Looking for valid English words:

- COMRA – invalid
- CONGA – but G is possible, but A is already 5
- COBMA – invalid
- CODMA – invalid
- COVMA – invalid
- COFMA – invalid
- COYMA – invalid

Wait, let's think of actual words:

- CONGA – fits C O N G A, but we have A fixed at 5, so CONGA would be C O N G A – but G is allowed.

But we have to check if N and G are unused. Yes, they are.

But we have to ensure we're using only the known letters (C, O, M, A) plus one new letter.

Actually, the word must use C, O, M, A plus one more letter from the remaining pool.

But looking at valid words:

- CONGA – uses C, O, N, G, A – but we know A is only in position 5, so this could fit if N and G are new.

But we have no information about N or G yet.

Another possibility: COBMA – invalid.

COMMA – but has two M's – impossible.

COBRA – but R is eliminated.

CONGA – seems possible.

Another: COGMA – invalid.

COVMA – invalid.

So CONGA seems to be the only valid word left.

But let me check if there are others:

- COBMA – invalid
- CODMA – invalid
- COFMA – invalid
- COYMA – invalid
- COZMA – invalid

CONGA appears to be the only valid English word left that fits all constraints.

Thus, the next guess should be CONGA.Based on the latest feedback, we now know:
- The word ends in ""A"" (position 5)
- ""O"" is in position 2
- ""C"" must be in position 1 (since it can't be in 3 or 4 and 2 is O)
- ""M"" must be in position 3 or 4
- Position 4 must be filled with a new letter not yet eliminated

The only valid word fitting these constraints is ""CONGA"".

Letters known to be in the word but not yet placed: M, C (but C is already used)
Wait, from earlier feedback:
- M is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (from M(-) in MOCHA, AMUCK, etc.)
But position 1 is C, 2 is O, 5 is A, so M must be in position 4.

Thus the word must be C O _ M A.

The only letter left to determine is position 3.  
Eliminated letters so far: R, I, S, E, P, L, T, U, K, H, N, G  
Remaining possible letters: B, D, F, J, V, W, Y, Z, Q (and a few others)

Looking for valid English words of the form C O _ M A:
- COBMA – invalid
- CODMA – invalid
- COFMA – invalid
- COVMA – invalid
- COYMA – invalid
- COZMA – invalid

The only common word that fits is ""COMMA"", but that would require two M's, which is impossible since M is already used in position 4.

Wait, let's reconsider: the word must be C O _ M A with the blank being any unused letter. The only valid English word left is ""COVMA"" – but that's not a word.

Actually, the correct word fitting this exact pattern is ""COMMA"", but since M is already in position 4, this would imply two M's, which contradicts the single occurrence of M inferred from the feedback.

This suggests an inconsistency, meaning we must have missed a possible letter. Rechecking the remaining pool, the letter ""B"" is still available. The word ""COBMA"" is invalid, but ""COMBA"" is also invalid.

Upon closer inspection, the only valid English word that fits C O _ M A is ""COMMA"", but it uses M twice. This indicates an error in our deduction.

Re-evaluating: from all feedback, the word must be C O _ _ A with M somewhere in positions 3 or 4. However, position 4 is now constrained by M needing to be in 3 or 4, but position 5 is A.

Given the constraints and valid English words, the only possible word left is ""COMMA"", but it violates the single-M constraint. This implies our earlier deduction that M must be in position 4 is incorrect.

Re-examining M placement:
- M is in word (from feedback)
- M cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (from various (-) feedback)
But positions 1,2,5 are fixed as C, O, A, so M must be in position 4.

Thus the word must be C O _ M A. The only valid word left is ""COVMA"" – but this is invalid.

Realizing now that the correct word fitting C O _ M A is actually ""COMMA"", but with the constraints, this suggests the word must be ""COMMA"". However, this would have two M's, which is impossible.

This indicates an error in our earlier steps. Let's re-examine the constraints:

From AMUCK: M(-) – M not in position 2
From PLANT: no info on M
From MOCHA: M(-) – M not in position 1
Thus M can be in positions 3 or 4.

From CONGA: positions 1,2,5 are fixed as C, O, A. Thus M must be in position 3 or 4.

If M is in position 3: word is C O M _ A
Possible letters for position 4: unused letters (B, D, F, J, V, W, Y, Z, Q)
Looking for valid words:
- COMBA – invalid
- COMFA – invalid
- COMVA – invalid
- COMYA – invalid
- COMZA – invalid

The only valid word here is ""COMBA"" – but this is invalid.

This suggests no valid word, indicating an error in our deduction. Realizing that the correct word must be ""COMMA"", but this violates constraints, we must have missed something.

Upon re-examining, the correct word fitting all constraints is actually ""COMMA"", but since M is already in position 4, this implies the third letter must be M, making it ""COMMA"". This suggests the word has two M's, which is possible if the feedback allows it.

However, from feedback, M is in the word but we have no indication of double letters. This suggests the word must be ""COMMA"".

But since this seems impossible, let's re-examine the constraints:

From all feedback, the word must be C O _ _ A with M somewhere in positions 3 or 4. The only valid word left is ""COMMA"", but this implies two M's. Given this contradiction, the only possible conclusion is that the word is ""COMMA"".

Thus, the final guess is ""COMMA"".

Based on the latest feedback, the word structure is C O _ _ A with M confirmed in position 4. The only valid English word fitting this pattern is:

<guess>COMMA</guess>",COMMA,"From the feedback on CONGA:
- C(✓) – correct in position 1
- O(✓) – correct in position 2
- N(x) – N is not in the word
- G(x) – G is not in the word
- A(✓) – correct in position 5
