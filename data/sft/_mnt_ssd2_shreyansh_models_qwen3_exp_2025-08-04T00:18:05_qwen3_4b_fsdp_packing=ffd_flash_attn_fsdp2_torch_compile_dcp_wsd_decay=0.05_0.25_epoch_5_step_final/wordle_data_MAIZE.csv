For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should ideally include 3-4 of these. 

Looking at combinations, ""AROSE"" is a strong candidate as it contains A, R, O, S, E - five of the most common letters. This gives us good coverage to identify which of these letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E) or ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E). However, ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O and S which are very common.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as the first guess to maximize the chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word.

- R is not in the word (x)
- O is not in the word (x)

- The word contains an A somewhere, but not in the first position.
- The letters R, O, S are not in the word at all.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that contains A somewhere in positions 2-4, and does not contain R, O, or S.

Possible positions for A: 2, 3, or 4.
Let’s think of words ending in E with A in these positions.

For example:
- If A is in position 2: CADET, GNAWE, etc.
- If A is in position 3: PLATE, GLADE, etc.
- If A is in position 4: ADIEU (but U is not confirmed), etc.

A good next guess should test new common letters while fitting these constraints. ""PLATE"" is a strong candidate because:
- Ends with E (confirmed).
- Contains A in position 3.
- Uses P, L, T which are common letters not yet tested.
- Doesn't use R, O, S.

Another good option is ""CADET"" (C, A, D, E, T).

Between these, ""PLATE"" seems slightly better as P and L are common consonants.

From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - A is present but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S are absent.

2. PLATE → P(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
   - Confirms E in position 5.
   - Confirms A is present but not in position 3 (since it got “-” again, just not in spot 3).
   - Now we also know P, L, T are absent.

So far:
- Letters known to be in the word: A, E (with E locked at position 5).
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: P, L, R, O, S, T.

Positions:
- Position 5: E
- Position 1: not A (from AROSE feedback), and not P, R, O, S, T (from PLATE feedback).
- Position 2: could be A, but we haven’t pinned it yet.
- Position 3: could be A, but feedback says A is not here.
- Position 4: could be A, but feedback says A is not here (from PLATE feedback).
Therefore, A must be in position 2.

So the pattern is: _ A _ _ E, with no P, L, R, O, S, T anywhere.

Remaining common letters not yet tried: N, D, C, B, G, H, K, M, F, Y, etc.

Let’s try to fill positions 1, 3, 4 with new common letters that fit the pattern _ A _ _ E.

Good candidates:
- C A N E ? – but needs 5 letters.
- C A B E ? – CABER? not a word.
- D A N E ? – DANES? plural, but valid.
- G A M E ? – GAMER? but R is out.
- B A N E ? – BANE? too short.
- F A N E ? – FANE? not common.
- H A N E ? – HANE? not common.
- M A N E ? – MANES? plural.
- C A D E ? – CADE? not common.

- C A K E ? – CAKE? too short.
- G A Z E ? – GAZE? too short.

Among these, “DAMES” is a valid 5-letter word ending in E, has A in position 2, and uses D, M which haven’t been ruled out. It also avoids all excluded letters (P, L, R, O, S, T).

- If A is in position 2: CADET, GNAWE, etc.
- If A is in position 3: PLATE, GLADE, etc.
- If A is in position 4: ADIEU (but U is not confirmed), etc.

A good next guess should test new common letters while fitting these constraints. ""PLATE"" is a strong candidate because:
- Ends with E (confirmed).
- Contains A in position 3.
- Uses P, L, T which are common letters not yet tested.
- Doesn't use R, O, S.

Another good option is ""CADET"" (C, A, D, E, T).

Between these, ""PLATE"" seems slightly better as P and L are common consonants.

Let’s go with PLATE.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: PLATE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - A is present but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S are absent.

2. PLATE → P(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
   - Confirms E in position 5.
   - Confirms A is present but not in position 3 (since it got “-” again, just not in spot 3).
   - Now we also know P, L, T are absent.

So far:
- Letters known to be in the word: A, E (with E locked at position 5).
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: P, L, R, O, S, T.

Positions:
- Position 5: E
- Position 1: not A (from AROSE feedback), and not P, R, O, S, T (from PLATE feedback).
- Position 2: could be A, but we haven’t pinned it yet.
- Position 3: could be A, but feedback says A is not here.
- Position 4: could be A, but feedback says A is not here (from PLATE feedback).
Therefore, A must be in position 2.

So the pattern is: _ A _ _ E, with no P, L, R, O, S, T anywhere.

Remaining common letters not yet tried: N, D, C, B, G, H, K, M, F, Y, etc.

Let’s try to fill positions 1, 3, 4 with new common letters that fit the pattern _ A _ _ E.

Good candidates:
- C A N E ? – but needs 5 letters.
- C A B E ? – CABER? not a word.
- D A N E ? – DANES? plural, but valid.
- G A M E ? – GAMER? but R is out.
- B A N E ? – BANE? too short.
- F A N E ? – FANE? not common.
- H A N E ? – HANE? not common.
- M A N E ? – MANES? plural.
- C A D E ? – CADE? not common.
- N A V E ? – NAVES? plural.
- C A K E ? – CAKE? too short.
- G A Z E ? – GAZE? too short.
- D A I E ? – not a word.
- D A M E ? – DAMES? plural.

Among these, “DAMES” is a valid 5-letter word ending in E, has A in position 2, and uses D, M which haven’t been ruled out. It also avoids all excluded letters (P, L, R, O, S, T).

Let's digest the new feedback from DAMES:

D(x)  → D is not in the word  
A(✓)  → A is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2)  
M(-)  → M is in the word but in the wrong position  
E(-)  → E is in the word but in the wrong position  

But wait: earlier feedback already told us E is in position 5 (from AROSE: E✓).  
So the feedback “E(-)” here is actually a contradiction unless we interpret it as “E is in the word but not in position 5.”  
However, the prior feedback clearly showed E in position 5 with ✓, so this suggests the E in position 4 of DAMES is being marked (-) to indicate it is NOT in position 4, but we already know from AROSE that E is fixed in position 5.  
Therefore, the feedback “E(-)” here is simply confirming E is not in position 4 (which we already knew).  

So the key new facts are:
- A is locked in position 2.
- M is in the word but not in position 3.
- D and S are not in the word (confirmed again).
- Letters already excluded: P, L, R, O, S, T, D.

Current pattern: _ A _ _ E  
We know M is somewhere in the word, but not in position 3.  
Therefore M must be in position 1 or 4.

Let’s list possible words fitting _ A _ _ E with M in 1 or 4, avoiding all excluded letters (P, L, R, O, S, T, D).

Possible letters left: A, B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
(We already know A is in position 2 and E is in position 5.)

Case 1: M in position 1 → M A _ _ E  
Possible: MAIZE? but Z not ruled out.  
But we have no info on Z yet.  
Another: MAGIC? but C, I, C, but C is ok.  
But let’s see if we can find a common word.

Case 2: M in position 4 → _ A _ M E  
Possible: C A M E ? – but needs 5 letters.  
B A N M E – not a word.  
F A C M E – not a word.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should ideally include 3-4 of these. 

Looking at combinations, ""AROSE"" is a strong candidate as it contains A, R, O, S, E - five of the most common letters. This gives us good coverage to identify which of these letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E) or ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E). However, ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O and S which are very common.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as the first guess to maximize the chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓)

So we know:
- The last letter is E.
- The word contains an A somewhere, but not in the first position.
- The letters R, O, S are not in the word at all.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that contains A somewhere in positions 2-4, and does not contain R, O, or S.

Possible positions for A: 2, 3, or 4.
Let’s think of words ending in E with A in these positions.

For example:
- If A is in position 2: CADET, GNAWE, etc.
- If A is in position 3: PLATE, GLADE, etc.
- If A is in position 4: ADIEU (but U is not confirmed), etc.

A good next guess should test new common letters while fitting these constraints. ""PLATE"" is a strong candidate because:
- Ends with E (confirmed).
- Contains A in position 3.
- Uses P, L, T which are common letters not yet tested.
- Doesn't use R, O, S.

Another good option is ""CADET"" (C, A, D, E, T).

Between these, ""PLATE"" seems slightly better as P and L are common consonants.

From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - A is present but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S are absent.

2. PLATE → P(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
   - Confirms E in position 5.
   - Confirms A is present but not in position 3 (since it got “-” again, just not in spot 3).
   - Now we also know P, L, T are absent.

So far:
- Letters known to be in the word: A, E (with E locked at position 5).
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: P, L, R, O, S, T.

Positions:
- Position 5: E
- Position 1: not A (from AROSE feedback), and not P, R, O, S, T (from PLATE feedback).
- Position 2: could be A, but we haven’t pinned it yet.
- Position 3: could be A, but feedback says A is not here.
- Position 4: could be A, but feedback says A is not here (from PLATE feedback).
Therefore, A must be in position 2.

So the pattern is: _ A _ _ E, with no P, L, R, O, S, T anywhere.

Remaining common letters not yet tried: N, D, C, B, G, H, K, M, F, Y, etc.

Let’s try to fill positions 1, 3, 4 with new common letters that fit the pattern _ A _ _ E.

Good candidates:
- C A N E ? – but needs 5 letters.
- C A B E ? – CABER? not a word.
- D A N E ? – DANES? plural, but valid.
- G A M E ? – GAMER? but R is out.

M(-)  → M is in the word but in the wrong position  
E(-)  → E is in the word but in the wrong position  

But wait: earlier feedback already told us E is in position 5 (from AROSE: E✓).  
So the feedback “E(-)” here is actually a contradiction unless we interpret it as “E is in the word but not in position 5.”  
However, the prior feedback clearly showed E in position 5 with ✓, so this suggests the E in position 4 of DAMES is being marked (-) to indicate it is NOT in position 4, but we already know from AROSE that E is fixed in position 5.  
Therefore, the feedback “E(-)” here is simply confirming E is not in position 4 (which we already knew).

Another: MAGIC? but C, I, C, but C is ok.  
But let’s see if we can find a common word.

Case 2: M in position 4 → _ A _ M E  
Possible: C A M E ? – but needs 5 letters.  
B A N M E – not a word.  
F A C M E – not a word.  
G A M E ? – GAMER but R is excluded.  
H A N M E – not a word.  
C A N M E – not a word.  
B A K M E – not a word.  
N A V M E – not a word.  
K A N M E – not a word.  
F A N M E – not a word.  
H A I M E – not a word.  
G A I M E – not a word.  
C A I M E – not a word.  
B A I M E – not a word.  
N A G M E – not a word.  
F A G M E – not a word.  
K A G M E – not a word.  
C A G M E – not a word.  
B A G M E – not a word.  
H A G M E – not a word.  
Y A M E ? – YAMEN? not common.  
V A M E ? – VAMEN? no.  
W A M E ? – WAME? no.  
U A M E ? – UAME? no.  
I A M E ? – IAME? no.  
O A M E ? – OAME? no.  
J A M E ? – JAME? no.  
Q A M E ? – no.  
X A M E ? – XAME? no.  
Z A M E ? – ZAME? no.  

So case 2 gives very few possibilities, many invalid.  
Let’s look at case 1: M A _ _ E  
Letters left: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  

Common words:
- MAIZE – uses Z, but Z is new.  
- MAGIC – uses C, I, C.  
- MANFE? no.  
- MANGE – uses N, G.  
- MAMBE? no.  
- MAMIE? but E is already in position 5.  
- MAIZE seems plausible.  
- MAGIC also plausible.  
- MANGE also plausible.  

Among these, MANGE uses letters we haven’t excluded yet (N, G).  
Let’s pick MANGE.

We now have four pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)

3. DAMES → D(x) A(✓) M(-) E(-) S(x)
4. MANGE → M(✓) A(✓) N(x) G(x) E(✓)

From these we can lock down the word:

- Position 5 is E (from every guess).
- Position 2 is A (from DAMES and MANGE).
- Position 1 is M (from MANGE).

So the pattern is: M A _ _ E

Letters already excluded: P, L, R, O, S, D, N, G.

We still need letters for positions 3 and 4 from the remaining alphabet: B, C, F, H, I, J, K, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit M A _ _ E:

- MABLE – but B and L; L is excluded.
- MACKE – but K and C; C is allowed.
- MAIZE – Z is allowed.
- MAGIC – but I and C; C is allowed, but G is excluded (from MANGE feedback).
- MAMBE – B is allowed, but we already have M in position 1.
- MAUVE – U and V are allowed.
- MAIZE and MAUVE are both plausible.
- MAMIE – I and M, but M is already used in position 1.

MAIZE uses I, Z – neither excluded yet.
MAUVE uses U, V – neither excluded yet.

Between these, MAIZE seems slightly more common.

Let’s try MAIZE.
