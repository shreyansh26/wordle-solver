### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 vowels and common consonants to quickly narrow down possibilities.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This will help me identify which vowels are present and their positions, as well as test R and S.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E), but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O and the placement of letters. I'll go with ""AROSE"".

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(✓): S is in the word and in the correct position (4th letter).
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- The word has an S as its 4th letter.
- It contains an A somewhere, but not in position 1.
- It does NOT contain R, O, or E.

We need a 5-letter word with S in the 4th position, an A somewhere (positions 2,3, or 5), and no R, O, or E. Let’s brainstorm possibilities:

Possible patterns: _ _ _ S _ or _ _ A S _ or _ A _ S _
With A allowed in positions 2,3,5 and avoiding R,O,E.

Some candidate words:
- PASTA – but has T and A in position 5, but S is 4th, A is 5th (allowed), but T is allowed.
- LASSO – but has O (invalid).
- MASSA – but has double S and A in 5th (allowed), but double letters may not help much.
- FASHI – but H and I are okay, but FASHI isn’t a valid word.
- GASP – too short.
- HASTE – has E (invalid).
- LASS – too short.
- PASTY – has T and Y, but no A in wrong position.
- WASTE – has E (invalid).
- CHASM – has C,H,A,S,M: S is 4th, A is 3rd (allowed), no R,O,E. This seems valid.

""CHASM"" fits all constraints:
- C H A S M
- S is 4th (correct).
- A is 3rd (originally was 1st, now 3rd – satisfies A is in word but wrong position).
- No R, O, or E.

Let’s verify: CHASM is a valid 5-letter word, uses S in 4th, A in 3rd, and avoids forbidden letters. This seems like a strong next guess.
