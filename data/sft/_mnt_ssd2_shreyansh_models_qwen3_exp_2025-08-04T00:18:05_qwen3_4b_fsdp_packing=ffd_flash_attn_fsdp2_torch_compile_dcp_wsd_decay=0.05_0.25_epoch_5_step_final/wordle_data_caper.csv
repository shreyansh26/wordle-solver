### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several possibilities. The best starting words typically include common vowels and consonants. Some good options are:

- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (uses C, R, I, S, P)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes three common vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (C, R, N). This should give me good information about which letters are present in the word.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is correct in position 1 → word is C _ _ _ _
- R is in the word but not in position 2 → R must be in 3,4, or 5
- A is in the word but not in position 3 → A must be in 2,4, or 5
- N is not in the word
- E is in the word but not in position 5 → E must be in 2,3, or 4

So the word starts with C and contains R, A, E somewhere in positions 2-5, with no N.

Possible positions:
- C _ _ _ _
- R can be 3,4,5
- A can be 2,4,5
- E can be 2,3,4

Let’s try to place these letters without repeating any used positions. A good next guess would be a word that places R, A, E in new positions while using common consonants. 

Consider ""CARET"":
- C (correct position)
- A in position 2 (new position)
- R in position 3 (new position)
- E in position 4 (new position)
- T is a new consonant

This tests four new positions for the known letters (A, R, E) and introduces T.

2. A is in the word and in the position it currently occupies → C A _ _ _

5. T and N are not in the word.

So the pattern so far is:

- If R is in position 4 → C A R E _ → need a 5th letter that is not T or N
- If R is in position 5 → C A _ E R → need a 3rd letter that is not T or N

Looking at common letters not yet used (from the alphabet excluding C, A, R, E, T, N, and considering position constraints), a good candidate is S. 

Let’s try placing R in position 4 first: C A R E _ → need a 5th letter. A common letter that fits and hasn’t been ruled out is S → CARES.

The best starting words typically include common vowels and consonants. Some good options are:\n\n- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)\n- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)\n- CRISP (uses C, R, I, S, P)\n- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)\n\nI\'ll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes three common vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (C, R, N). This should give me good information about which letters are present in the word.\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on CRANE:\n- C is correct in position 1 → word is C _ _ _ _\n- R is in the word but not in position 2 → R must be in 3,4, or 5\n- A is in the word but not in position 3 → A must be in 2,4, or 5\n- N is not in the word\n- E is in the word but not in position 5 → E must be in 2,3, or 4\n\nSo the word starts with C and contains R, A, E somewhere in positions 2-5, with no N.\n\nPossible positions:\n- C _ _ _ _\n- R can be 3,4,5\n- A can be 2,4,5\n- E can be 2,3,4\n\nLet’s try to place these letters without repeating any used positions.

From the feedback so far:

1. C is fixed in position 1 → C _ _ _ _
2. A is fixed in position 2 → C A _ _ _
3. E is fixed in position 4 → C A _ E _
4. R is in the word but not in positions 2, 3, or 4 → the only remaining spot for R is position 5.
5. Letters already ruled out: N, T, S.

So the pattern is:
C A _ E R

The only unknown is the 3rd letter. It must be a letter that hasn’t been used yet and isn’t among the ruled-out letters (N, T, S). Common consonants that haven’t been tried include D, L, M, P, B, etc.

Looking at common 5-letter words that fit C A _ E R, the most likely candidates are:
- CALER (not a common word)
- CAMER (not a common word)
- CAPER (valid word meaning someone who capers)
- CAYER (not a common word)
- CUBER (but we know R is in position 5, so CUBER doesn’t fit)

The best valid word fitting the pattern is C A P E R.

Let’s try CAPER.
