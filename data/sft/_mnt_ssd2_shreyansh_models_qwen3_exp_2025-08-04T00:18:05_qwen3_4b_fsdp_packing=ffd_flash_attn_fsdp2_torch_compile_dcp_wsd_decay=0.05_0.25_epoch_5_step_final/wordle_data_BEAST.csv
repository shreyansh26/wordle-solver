### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 vowels and common consonants to maximize information gain. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
This will help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E), but ""AROSE"" covers more common letters. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides better coverage of frequent letters.

- The word ends with S.
- It contains A and E somewhere, but not in their original positions (A not 1st, E not 5th).
- It does NOT contain R or O.

We need a new 5-letter word that:

2. Contains A and E.
3. Does not contain R or O.
4. Uses common remaining letters to maximize information.

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, G, B, M, P, etc.

Let’s try “LEAST”:
- Ends with S.
- Contains A and E.
- Does not contain R or O.
- Uses L and T which are common and untested.

Check positions:
- E is 2nd (was last, so wrong position ✓)

From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word ends with S (from arose).
2. The pattern is: B E A T _ S  (because B, E, A, T are all correct but T is in the wrong position here).
   However, the feedback on BEATS shows:
   - B(✓) – correct in position 1
   - E(✓) – correct in position 2
   - A(✓) – correct in position 3
   - T(-) – T is in the word but in the wrong position (it’s currently in position 4)
   - S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (it’s currently in position 5)

This seems contradictory to our earlier conclusion that S is in position 5 (from arose). The feedback on arose said S(✓) meaning S is in the correct position, i.e., position 5.

But the feedback on BEATS says S(-) meaning S is in the word but not in position 5. This is a conflict. The only way both pieces of feedback can be true is if the S in BEATS is actually in position 5, but the feedback says it’s wrong position, implying S is not in position 5. This suggests that the S in arose must have been a typo or misunderstanding.

Re-reading the feedback carefully:
- arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
  This means S is in the correct position (position 4), not position 5. I misread the positions earlier.

- least -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(✓) A(✓) S(✓) T(✓)
  This shows S is in position 4 (correct), T is in position 5 (correct), E in 2, A in 3.

- beats -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) E(✓) A(✓) T(-) S(-)
  This shows:
  - B in position 1 (correct)
  - E in position 2 (correct)
  - A in position 3 (correct)
  - T in position 4 (wrong position, should be 5)
  - S in position 5 (wrong position, should be 4)

This is consistent now. The word has:
- B in position 1
- E in position 2
- A in position 3
- T in position 5 (since in beats it was in position 4 and marked wrong position)
- S must be in position 4 (since in arose it was position 4 and marked correct)

So the word is: B E A S T

This fits all feedback:
- arose: A(-) – A is in word but not position 1 (it’s in 3) ✓
  S(✓) – S is in position 4 ✓
- least: S(✓) – S is in position 4 ✓
- beats: T(-) – T is in word but not position 4 (it’s in 5) ✓
  S(-) – S is in word but not position 5 (it’s in 4) ✓

Therefore, the word is BEAST.
