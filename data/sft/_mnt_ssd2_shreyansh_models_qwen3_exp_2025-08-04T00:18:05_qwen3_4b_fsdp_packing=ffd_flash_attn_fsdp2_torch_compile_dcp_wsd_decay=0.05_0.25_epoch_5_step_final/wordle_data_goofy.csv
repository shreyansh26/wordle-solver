For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AROSE,"" or ""ADIEU."" 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should cover as many of these as possible. 

""SLATE"" covers S, L, A, T, E - which are all very common letters. It also includes two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (S, L, T). This seems like a strong first guess to maximize information gain.

Another good option would be ""AROSE"" as it contains A, R, O, S, E - covering five of the most common letters. However, ""SLATE"" might give slightly more information due to the inclusion of L and T.

After considering these factors, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word, so we can eliminate every word that contains any of those letters.

Common letters not yet ruled out include:  
- Vowels: I, O, U  
- Consonants: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F, K, etc.

A good second guess should use entirely new letters to maximize information gain. Popular “fresh-letter” choices after a full wipe include:
- ROUND (R, O, U, N, D) – covers three new vowels plus two consonants
- CRIMP (C, R, I, M, P) – strong consonant cluster with a vowel
- DRINK (D, R, I, N, K) – balances vowels/consonants

ROUND seems slightly safer because it spreads across different phonetic positions and uses O/U which are still in play.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AROSE,"" or ""ADIEU."" 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should cover as many of these as possible. 

""SLATE"" covers S, L, A, T, E - which are all very common letters. It also includes two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (S, L, T). This seems like a strong first guess to maximize information gain.

Another good option would be ""AROSE"" as it contains A, R, O, S, E - covering five of the most common letters. However, ""SLATE"" might give slightly more information due to the inclusion of L and T.

After considering these factors, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word, so we can eliminate every word that contains any of those letters.

Common letters not yet ruled out include:  
- Vowels: I, O, U  
- Consonants: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F, K, etc.

A good second guess should use entirely new letters to maximize information gain. Popular “fresh-letter” choices after a full wipe include:
- ROUND (R, O, U, N, D) – covers three new vowels plus two consonants
- CRIMP (C, R, I, M, P) – strong consonant cluster with a vowel
- DRINK (D, R, I, N, K) – balances vowels/consonants

ROUND seems slightly safer because it spreads across different phonetic positions and uses O/U which are still in play.

So far we know:
- Letters eliminated completely: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D
- Letter O is in the word and is in position 2 (O is the 2nd letter).

We need a 5-letter word where:
- The 2nd letter is O
- No other letters are among the eliminated set {S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D}

Remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: I, O (but O is already fixed in position 2), Y (sometimes a vowel)

We need three more letters (positions 1, 3, 4, 5) from the remaining set, ensuring we don’t repeat any eliminated letters.

Possible patterns:
- _ O _ _ _
Good candidates:
- B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y

Let’s brainstorm some words:
- BOGGY
- COFFY (not valid)
- HOAGY (not valid)
- JOCKY
- MOKHY (not valid)
- POKER (contains R, eliminated)
- VOGUE
- WOKER (contains R, eliminated)
- YOKEL (contains L, eliminated)

Valid words:
- JOCKY (J, O, C, K, Y) – all letters allowed
- VOGUE (V, O, G, U, E) – but U and E are eliminated
- WOKER – eliminated letters
- BOGGY – B, O, G, G, Y – valid

JOCKY seems the best: J, O, C, K, Y – none of these letters have been eliminated, and O is in the correct position.

Let’s verify:
- J – not eliminated
- O – ✓ in position 2
- C – not eliminated
- K – not eliminated
- Y – not eliminated

No conflicts. JOCKY is a valid 5-letter word meeting all constraints.

From the feedback so far:
- Pattern is _ O _ _ Y (O in 2nd, Y in 5th).
- Letters eliminated: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D, J, C, K, B.
- G appears in the word but is in the wrong positions in BOGGY (positions 3 and 4 both marked “-”).  
  That means G is present exactly once, and it is **not** in positions 3 or 4.  
  Therefore G must be in position 1.

So the word must be G O _ _ Y, and the remaining two blanks must be filled with letters not yet eliminated and not G, O, or Y.

Available letters (not in the eliminated set): F, H, I, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need two distinct letters from these for positions 3 and 4.

Possible real 5-letter words:
- GOOFY – but F and Y already used, O duplicate (invalid).
- GOING – N eliminated.
- GOOPY – P is allowed, but O duplicate (invalid).
- GOUGE – U eliminated.
- GOBBY – B eliminated.
- GOOFY – already noted.
- GUMMY – M, U, M – U eliminated.

- GOBEL – B, L eliminated.
- GOOFY – again.
- GUMMY – U eliminated.
- GOLLY – L eliminated.
- GOOPY – O duplicate.
- GOOFY – again.

Looking at the available letters, the only valid word seems to be GOOFY, but it has a duplicate O (invalid) and F is allowed.  
Wait, let’s check carefully:

We need G O _ _ Y with remaining letters: F, H, I, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Possible combinations:
- G O I F Y – not a word.
- G O M I Y – not a word.
- G O P I Y – not a word.
- G O V I Y – not a word.
- G O H I Y – not a word.

- G O V V Y – not a word.
- G O W I Y – not a word.
- G O X I Y – not a word.
- G O Z I Y – not a word.

Actually, the only valid English word fitting G O _ _ Y with allowed letters is GOOFY, but it has an extra O (invalid).  
Next possibility: GOING – N eliminated.  
GONER – R, N eliminated.  
GOLLY – L eliminated.  
GOMMY – M, but word is GOMMY (invalid order).  
GOOPY – O duplicate.

Wait, let’s list all valid English words matching G O _ _ Y:
- GOOFY
- GOING
- GONER
- GOLLY
- GOMMY
- GOOPY

From these, only GOOFY and GOING are possible, but N and I are allowed, yet:
- GOING – N is eliminated.
- GOOFY – has an extra O (invalid).

This suggests we missed a valid word. Let’s think differently: the two middle letters can be any of the available letters, not necessarily distinct.

Looking at the remaining letters: F, H, I, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Possible valid words:
- G O I F Y – not a word.
- G O M I Y – not a word.
- G O P I Y – not a word.
- G O V I Y – not a word.
- G O H I Y – not a word.

- G O V V Y – not a word.
- G O W I Y – not a word.
- G O X I Y – not a word.
- G O Z I Y – not a word.

It appears the only valid word left is GOOFY, but it violates the O count.  
Wait, let’s check again: the feedback said G is in the word but positions 3 and 4 are wrong in BOGGY. That means G appears once and is not in positions 3 or 4, so must be in position 1.  
Thus the word must be G O _ _ Y with the two middle letters from the remaining set.

Looking up valid 5-letter words starting with GO and ending with Y:
- GOOFY – invalid (extra O).
- GOING – invalid (N eliminated).
- GONER – invalid (N, R eliminated).
- GOLLY – invalid (L eliminated).
- GOMMY – invalid (M, but word is GOMMY, which is G O M M Y – M is allowed, but O is already used).
- GOOPY – invalid (extra O).

This suggests we need to look for words where G is in position 1, O in 2, and the last letter Y, with the middle two letters from the remaining set, possibly repeating.

Valid words:
- G O M M Y – GOMMY (M is allowed, but word is GOMMY, which is G O M M Y – positions 3 and 4 are M and M).
- G O P P Y – POPPY (invalid order).
- G O V V Y – not a word.
- G O F F Y – not a word.
- G O H H Y – not a word.
- G O W W Y – not a word.
- G O X X Y – not a word.
- G O Z Z Y – not a word.

GOMMY seems valid, as M is not eliminated, and G is in position 1 (correct), O in 2 (correct), Y in 5 (correct), and M is allowed.

Thus, the next guess should be GOMMY.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AROSE,"" or ""ADIEU."" 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should cover as many of these as possible. 

""SLATE"" covers S, L, A, T, E - which are all very common letters. It also includes two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (S, L, T). This seems like a strong first guess to maximize information gain.

Another good option would be ""AROSE"" as it contains A, R, O, S, E - covering five of the most common letters. However, ""SLATE"" might give slightly more information due to the inclusion of L and T.

After considering these factors, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word, so we can eliminate every word that contains any of those letters.

Common letters not yet ruled out include:  
- Vowels: I, O, U  
- Consonants: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F, K, etc.

A good second guess should use entirely new letters to maximize information gain. Popular “fresh-letter” choices after a full wipe include:
- ROUND (R, O, U, N, D) – covers three new vowels plus two consonants
- CRIMP (C, R, I, M, P) – strong consonant cluster with a vowel
- DRINK (D, R, I, N, K) – balances vowels/consonants

ROUND seems slightly safer because it spreads across different phonetic positions and uses O/U which are still in play.

So far we know:
- Letters eliminated completely: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D
- Letter O is in the word and is in position 2 (O is the 2nd letter).

We need a 5-letter word where:
- The 2nd letter is O
- No other letters are among the eliminated set {S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D}

Remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: I, O (but O is already fixed in position 2), Y (sometimes a vowel)

We need three more letters (positions 1, 3, 4, 5) from the remaining set, ensuring we don’t repeat any eliminated letters.

Possible patterns:
- _ O _ _ _
Good candidates:
- B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y

Let’s brainstorm some words:
- BOGGY
- COFFY (not valid)
- HOAGY (not valid)
- JOCKY
- MOKHY (not valid)
- POKER (contains R, eliminated)
- VOGUE
- WOKER (contains R, eliminated)
- YOKEL (contains L, eliminated)

Valid words:
- JOCKY (J, O, C, K, Y) – all letters allowed
- VOGUE (V, O, G, U, E) – but U and E are eliminated
- WOKER – eliminated letters
- BOGGY – B, O, G, G, Y – valid

JOCKY seems the best: J, O, C, K, Y – none of these letters have been eliminated, and O is in the correct position.

Let’s verify:
- J – not eliminated
- O – ✓ in position 2
- C – not eliminated
- K – not eliminated
- Y – not eliminated

No conflicts. JOCKY is a valid 5-letter word meeting all constraints.

Current confirmed facts:
1. The word has the pattern _ O _ _ Y (O in 2nd, Y in 5th).
2. Eliminated letters so far: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D, J, C, K.
3. Remaining letters available (no repeats of the above): B, F, G, H, I, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need to fill positions 1, 3, and 4 with three distinct letters from the remaining set.  
Possible letters for each position: B, F, G, H, I, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Let’s list valid 5-letter words that fit _ O _ _ Y:
- BOGGY – G twice, but G is allowed; however G and G are duplicates, but the word is valid.
- BOOZY – Z is allowed, but has two O’s (invalid, O already fixed in position 2).
- FOAMY – A is eliminated.
- GOOFY – F is allowed, but G, O, O – second O would duplicate, invalid.
- HONEY – N, E eliminated.
- MOODY – D, O, O – D eliminated, O duplicate.
- POOFY – P, O, O – O duplicate.
- VOOGY – V, O, G, G, Y – valid, but G repeats.
- WOOZY – W, O, O – O duplicate.
- BOOZY – already noted invalid.

Valid words without duplicates or eliminated letters:
- BOGGY (B, O, G, G, Y) – G repeats, but word is valid.
- VOOGY (V, O, O, G, Y) – O repeats, invalid.
- MOONY – N eliminated.
- HOAGY – H, O, A – A eliminated.
- BOOZY – invalid.

Actually, let’s systematically generate:
Possible letters: B, F, G, H, I, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need three distinct letters for positions 1, 3, 4.

Let’s list possible combinations:
- B, I, G → BOIGY – not a word.
- F, I, G → FOIGY – not a word.
- H, I, G → HOIGY – not a word.
- M, I, G → MOIGY – not a word.

- W, I, G → WOIGY – not a word.
- X, I, G → XOIGY – not a word.
- Z, I, G → ZOIGY – not a word.

Looking at remaining letters, the only valid word seems to be BOGGY, even though G repeats. Are there others?

Another approach: check if any letters are still untested that we missed.

Wait, we have I (vowel) still available. Let’s try:
- BOGGY – B, O, G, G, Y
- FOIGY – not a word.
- HOIGY – not a word.
- MOIGY – not a word.
- POIGY – not a word.
- VOIGY – not a word.
- WOIGY – not a word.
- XOIGY – not a word.
- ZOIGY – not a word.

Actually, let’s think of real words:
- BOGGY – valid, but G twice.
- FOAMY – A eliminated.
- GOOFY – O duplicate.
- HONEY – N, E eliminated.
- JOCKY – already guessed.
- MOONY – N eliminated.
- POOFY – O duplicate.
- VOOGY – O duplicate.
- WOOZY – O duplicate.

It appears BOGGY is the only valid word fitting _ O _ _ Y with remaining letters, even if G repeats. Are there others?

Another valid word is:
- BOOZY – but has two O’s (invalid).
- FOULY – U eliminated.
- HONEY – N, E eliminated.
- MOONY – N eliminated.
- POOZY – O duplicate.
- VOOGY – O duplicate.

Wait, let’s list all valid English words matching _ O _ _ Y:
- BOGGY
- BOOZY (invalid)
- COOZY (C eliminated)
- FOULY (U eliminated)
- GOOFY (O duplicate)
- HOAGY (A eliminated)
- JOCKY (already guessed)
- MOONY (N eliminated)
- POOFY (O duplicate)
- POOZY (O duplicate)
- VOOGY (O duplicate)
- WOOZY (O duplicate)

Only BOGGY is valid without using eliminated letters.

Thus, the next guess should be BOGGY.

From the feedback so far:
- Pattern is _ O _ _ Y (O in 2nd, Y in 5th).
- Letters eliminated: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D, J, C, K, B.
- G appears in the word but is in the wrong positions in BOGGY (positions 3 and 4 both marked “-”).  
  That means G is present exactly once, and it is **not** in positions 3 or 4.  
  Therefore G must be in position 1.

So the word must be G O _ _ Y, and the remaining two blanks must be filled with letters not yet eliminated and not G, O, or Y.

Available letters (not in the eliminated set): F, H, I, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need two distinct letters from these for positions 3 and 4.

Possible real 5-letter words:
- GOOFY – but F and Y already used, O duplicate (invalid).
- GOING – N eliminated.
- GOOPY – P is allowed, but O duplicate (invalid).
- GOUGE – U eliminated.
- GOBBY – B eliminated.
- GOOFY – already noted.
- GUMMY – M, U, M – U eliminated.
- GOLLY – L eliminated.
- GONER – R, N eliminated.
- GOBEL – B, L eliminated.
- GOOFY – again.
- GUMMY – U eliminated.
- GOLLY – L eliminated.
- GOOPY – O duplicate.
- GOOFY – again.

Looking at the available letters, the only valid word seems to be GOOFY, but it has a duplicate O (invalid) and F is allowed.  
Wait, let’s check carefully:

We need G O _ _ Y with remaining letters: F, H, I, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Possible combinations:
- G O I F Y – not a word.
- G O M I Y – not a word.
- G O P I Y – not a word.
- G O V I Y – not a word.
- G O H I Y – not a word.
- G O P P Y – P twice, but word is POPPY (invalid order).
- G O M M Y – M twice, but word is MOMMY (invalid order).
- G O V V Y – not a word.
- G O W I Y – not a word.
- G O X I Y – not a word.
- G O Z I Y – not a word.

Actually, the only valid English word fitting G O _ _ Y with allowed letters is GOOFY, but it has an extra O (invalid).  
Next possibility: GOING – N eliminated.  
GONER – R, N eliminated.  
GOLLY – L eliminated.  
GOMMY – M, but word is GOMMY (invalid order).  
GOOPY – O duplicate.

Wait, let’s list all valid English words matching G O _ _ Y:
- GOOFY
- GOING
- GONER
- GOLLY
- GOMMY
- GOOPY

From these, only GOOFY and GOING are possible, but N and I are allowed, yet:
- GOING – N is eliminated.
- GOOFY – has an extra O (invalid).

This suggests we missed a valid word. Let’s think differently: the two middle letters can be any of the available letters, not necessarily distinct.

Looking at the remaining letters: F, H, I, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Possible valid words:
- G O I F Y – not a word.
- G O M I Y – not a word.
- G O P I Y – not a word.
- G O V I Y – not a word.
- G O H I Y – not a word.
- G O P P Y – POPPY (invalid order).
- G O M M Y – MOMMY (invalid order).
- G O V V Y – not a word.
- G O W I Y – not a word.
- G O X I Y – not a word.
- G O Z I Y – not a word.

It appears the only valid word left is GOOFY, but it violates the O count.  
Wait, let’s check again: the feedback said G is in the word but positions 3 and 4 are wrong in BOGGY. That means G appears once and is not in positions 3 or 4, so must be in position 1.  
Thus the word must be G O _ _ Y with the two middle letters from the remaining set.

Looking up valid 5-letter words starting with GO and ending with Y:
- GOOFY – invalid (extra O).
- GOING – invalid (N eliminated).
- GONER – invalid (N, R eliminated).
- GOLLY – invalid (L eliminated).
- GOMMY – invalid (M, but word is GOMMY, which is G O M M Y – M is allowed, but O is already used).
- GOOPY – invalid (extra O).

This suggests we need to look for words where G is in position 1, O in 2, and the last letter Y, with the middle two letters from the remaining set, possibly repeating.

Valid words:
- G O M M Y – GOMMY (M is allowed, but word is GOMMY, which is G O M M Y – positions 3 and 4 are M and M).
- G O P P Y – POPPY (invalid order).
- G O V V Y – not a word.
- G O F F Y – not a word.
- G O H H Y – not a word.
- G O W W Y – not a word.
- G O X X Y – not a word.
- G O Z Z Y – not a word.

GOMMY seems valid, as M is not eliminated, and G is in position 1 (correct), O in 2 (correct), Y in 5 (correct), and M is allowed.

Thus, the next guess should be GOMMY.
