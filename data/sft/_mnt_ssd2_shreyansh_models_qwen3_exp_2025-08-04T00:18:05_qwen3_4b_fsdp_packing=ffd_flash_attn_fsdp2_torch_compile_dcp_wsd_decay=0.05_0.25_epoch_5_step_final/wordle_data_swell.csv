For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are:

- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - vowel-heavy
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should include as many of these as possible without repeating letters.

CRANE includes C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters. It's a strong choice because:
- C is in the 10% most common letters
- R is in the 10% most common letters
- A and E are the most common vowels
- N is also fairly common

Another excellent choice would be SLATE, which includes S, L, A, T, E - also all high-frequency letters. Between the two, CRANE might have a slight edge because C is slightly more common than L, and R is more common than T.

I'll go with CRANE as my first guess to maximize the information gained.

From the feedback on CRANE:

2. The letters C, R, A, N are NOT in the word at all.

Since we have four letters ruled out, we need a new set of common letters to test. The remaining common letters include S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc. A good strategy is to pick a word with new common letters while ensuring E is included (but not in the 5th position).

Possible good candidates:
- SLIDE (S, L, I, D, E) – E is in 4th position
- STOLE (S, T, O, L, E) – E is in 5th position (bad, since E can’t be 5th)

From the two guesses so far we know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, I, D  
Letters that ARE in the word (positions still unknown): S, L, E  

Additional constraints:
- S is in the word and is in position 1 (✓ at first letter).
- L is in the word but not in position 2 (- at second letter).
- E is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5 (- at both 4th and 5th positions in the two guesses).

So the word looks like: S _ _ _ _ with remaining letters to place: L, E, and any others not yet ruled out.

Possible positions for L: 3, 4, or 5 (but E is already excluded from 4 and 5, so L can be 3, 4, or 5, and E must go in the remaining spot).

But wait: E was marked ""-"" at 4th position in SLIDE, meaning E is in the word but not at 4th. In CRANE, E was at 5th and marked ""-"", so E is not at 5th either. Therefore E must be at 2 or 3.

Similarly, L was ""-"" at position 2 in SLIDE, so L is in the word but not at 2. Therefore L must be at 3, 4, or 5. But positions 4 and 5 are excluded for E, so L could be at 3, 4, or 5.

Let's list possible patterns:
- S E L _ _  (E at 2, L at 3)
- S _ L E _  (L at 3, E at 4 - but E can't be at 4)
- S _ E L _  (E at 3, L at 4)
- S _ _ E L  (E at 4 - invalid, E can't be at 4)
- S _ L _ E  (E at 5 - invalid)
- S E _ L _  (E at 2, L at 4)

So valid patterns are:
1. S E L _ _
2. S _ E L _
3. S _ _ E L  (invalid, E can't be at 5)
4. S _ L E _  (invalid, E can't be at 4)
5. S E _ L _
6. S _ E _ L  (invalid, E can't be at 4, L at 5)

Valid ones are 1, 2, 5.

Now we need to fill the remaining blanks with letters not yet ruled out (not C, R, A, N, I, D).

Possible letters left: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, S, L, E (but S, L, E already used).

Let's think of words that fit these patterns:

1. S E L _ _ : possible words - S E L E C (invalid, C ruled out), S E L L Y (invalid, Y okay), S E L L S (invalid), S E L L Y - but Y is okay. But SELLY isn't a valid word. Maybe S E L F S - but F and S already have S at start. Maybe S E L F S isn't valid. 

2. S _ E L _ : possible words - S C E L L (invalid), S H E L F (H, E, L, F - all valid, SHELF is a word). 

3. S _ _ E L : but E can't be at 5, so invalid.

So SHELF seems to fit pattern 2: S H E L F.

Let's check:
- S at 1: ✓ (matches)
- H: new letter, not ruled out
- E: in word, position 3 (valid, since E can't be at 2,4,5 - 3 is okay)
- L: in word, position 4 (valid, since L can't be at 2, but 4 is okay)
- F: new letter, not ruled out

This seems like the best next guess.

So valid patterns are:
1. S E L _ _
2. S _ E L _
3. S _ _ E L  (invalid, E can't be at 5)
4. S _ L E _  (invalid, E can't be at 4)
5. S E _ L _
6. S _ E _ L  (invalid, E can't be at 4, L at 5)

Valid ones are 1, 2, 5.

Now we need to fill the remaining blanks with letters not yet ruled out (not C, R, A, N, I, D).

Possible letters left: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, S, L, E (but S, L, E already used).

Let's think of words that fit these patterns:

1. S E L _ _ : possible words - S E L E C (invalid, C ruled out), S E L L Y (invalid, Y okay), S E L L S (invalid), S E L L Y - but Y is okay. But SELLY isn't a valid word. Maybe S E L F S - but F and S already have S at start. Maybe S E L F S isn't valid. 

2. S _ E L _ : possible words - S C E L L (invalid), S H E L F (H, E, L, F - all valid, SHELF is a word). 

3. S _ _ E L : but E can't be at 5, so invalid.

So SHELF seems to fit pattern 2: S H E L F.

Let's check:
- S at 1: ✓ (matches)
- H: new letter, not ruled out
- E: in word, position 3 (valid, since E can't be at 2,4,5 - 3 is okay)
- L: in word, position 4 (valid, since L can't be at 2, but 4 is okay)
- F: new letter, not ruled out

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are:

- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - vowel-heavy
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should include as many of these as possible without repeating letters.

CRANE includes C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters. It's a strong choice because:
- C is in the 10% most common letters
- R is in the 10% most common letters
- A and E are the most common vowels
- N is also fairly common

Another excellent choice would be SLATE, which includes S, L, A, T, E - also all high-frequency letters. Between the two, CRANE might have a slight edge because C is slightly more common than L, and R is more common than T.

I'll go with CRANE as my first guess to maximize the information gained.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: x → not in the word
- R: x → not in the word
- A: x → not in the word
- N: x → not in the word
- E: - → the letter E is in the word, but not in the 5th position

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter E somewhere, but not at the end.
2. The letters C, R, A, N are NOT in the word at all.

Since we have four letters ruled out, we need a new set of common letters to test. The remaining common letters include S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc. A good strategy is to pick a word with new common letters while ensuring E is included (but not in the 5th position).

Possible good candidates:
- SLIDE (S, L, I, D, E) – E is in 4th position
- STOLE (S, T, O, L, E) – E is in 5th position (bad, since E can’t be 5th)
- ELBOW (E, L, B, O, W) – E is 1st position
- STONE (S, T, O, N, E) – N is already ruled out
- PLUME (P, L, U, M, E) – E is 5th (bad)
- SHINE (S, H, I, N, E) – N is ruled out
- GLIDE (G, L, I, D, E) – E is 5th (bad)
- SLIDE seems best: S, L, I, D, E (E in 4th, new letters)

From the two guesses so far we know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, I, D  
Letters that ARE in the word (positions still unknown): S, L, E  

Additional constraints:
- S is in the word and is in position 1 (✓ at first letter).
- L is in the word but not in position 2 (- at second letter).
- E is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5 (- at both 4th and 5th positions in the two guesses).

So the word looks like: S _ _ _ _ with remaining letters to place: L, E, and any others not yet ruled out.

Possible positions for L: 3, 4, or 5 (but E is already excluded from 4 and 5, so L can be 3, 4, or 5, and E must go in the remaining spot).

But wait: E was marked ""-"" at 4th position in SLIDE, meaning E is in the word but not at 4th. In CRANE, E was at 5th and marked ""-"", so E is not at 5th either. Therefore E must be at 2 or 3.

Similarly, L was ""-"" at position 2 in SLIDE, so L is in the word but not at 2. Therefore L must be at 3, 4, or 5. But positions 4 and 5 are excluded for E, so L could be at 3, 4, or 5.

Let's list possible patterns:
- S E L _ _  (E at 2, L at 3)
- S _ L E _  (L at 3, E at 4 - but E can't be at 4)
- S _ E L _  (E at 3, L at 4)
- S _ _ E L  (E at 4 - invalid, E can't be at 4)
- S _ L _ E  (E at 5 - invalid)
- S E _ L _  (E at 2, L at 4)

So valid patterns are:
1. S E L _ _
2. S _ E L _
3. S _ _ E L  (invalid, E can't be at 5)
4. S _ L E _  (invalid, E can't be at 4)
5. S E _ L _
6. S _ E _ L  (invalid, E can't be at 4, L at 5)

Valid ones are 1, 2, 5.

Now we need to fill the remaining blanks with letters not yet ruled out (not C, R, A, N, I, D).

Possible letters left: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, S, L, E (but S, L, E already used).

Let's think of words that fit these patterns:

1. S E L _ _ : possible words - S E L E C (invalid, C ruled out), S E L L Y (invalid, Y okay), S E L L S (invalid), S E L L Y - but Y is okay. But SELLY isn't a valid word. Maybe S E L F S - but F and S already have S at start. Maybe S E L F S isn't valid. 

2. S _ E L _ : possible words - S C E L L (invalid), S H E L F (H, E, L, F - all valid, SHELF is a word). 

3. S _ _ E L : but E can't be at 5, so invalid.

So SHELF seems to fit pattern 2: S H E L F.

Let's check:
- S at 1: ✓ (matches)
- H: new letter, not ruled out
- E: in word, position 3 (valid, since E can't be at 2,4,5 - 3 is okay)
- L: in word, position 4 (valid, since L can't be at 2, but 4 is okay)
- F: new letter, not ruled out

But wait: E was marked ""-"" at 4th position in SLIDE, meaning E is in the word but not at 4th. In CRANE, E was at 5th and marked ""-"", so E is not at 5th either. Therefore E must be at 2 or 3.

Similarly, L was ""-"" at position 2 in SLIDE, so L is in the word but not at 2. Therefore L must be at 3, 4, or 5. But positions 4 and 5 are excluded for E, so L could be at 3, 4, or 5.

Let's list possible patterns:
- S E L _ _  (E at 2, L at 3)
- S _ L E _  (L at 3, E at 4 - but E can't be at 4)
- S _ E L _  (E at 3, L at 4)
- S _ _ E L  (E at 4 - invalid, E can't be at 4)
- S _ L _ E  (E at 5 - invalid)
- S E _ L _  (E at 2, L at 4)

So valid patterns are:
1. S E L _ _
2. S _ E L _
3. S _ _ E L  (invalid, E can't be at 5)
4. S _ L E _  (invalid, E can't be at 4)
5. S E _ L _
6. S _ E _ L  (invalid, E can't be at 4, L at 5)

Valid ones are 1, 2, 5.

Now we need to fill the remaining blanks with letters not yet ruled out (not C, R, A, N, I, D).

Possible letters left: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, S, L, E (but S, L, E already used).

Let's think of words that fit these patterns:

1. S E L _ _ : possible words - S E L E C (invalid, C ruled out), S E L L Y (invalid, Y okay), S E L L S (invalid), S E L L Y - but Y is okay. But SELLY isn't a valid word. Maybe S E L F S - but F and S already have S at start. Maybe S E L F S isn't valid. 

2. S _ E L _ : possible words - S C E L L (invalid), S H E L F (H, E, L, F - all valid, SHELF is a word). 

3. S _ _ E L : but E can't be at 5, so invalid.

So SHELF seems to fit pattern 2: S H E L F.

Let's check:
- S at 1: ✓ (matches)
- H: new letter, not ruled out
- E: in word, position 3 (valid, since E can't be at 2,4,5 - 3 is okay)
- L: in word, position 4 (valid, since L can't be at 2, but 4 is okay)
- F: new letter, not ruled out

This seems like the best next guess.

From the three guesses we now have:

Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, I, D, H, F  
Letters that ARE in the word and their known positions:
- S is in position 1 (✓ at start of SHELF)
- E is in position 3 (✓ at position 3 of SHELF)
- L is in position 4 (✓ at position 4 of SHELF)

So the word structure is: S _ E L _

We still need to fill positions 2 and 5 with letters that have NOT been ruled out (i.e., not in {C, R, A, N, I, D, H, F}).

Remaining common letters that are legal: B, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid English 5-letter word that matches S _ E L _.

Possible candidates:
- S B E L L – but “SHELL” is already partially guessed (H ruled out) and B is allowed, but let’s check if it’s valid.
- S G E L L – “SHELL” with G instead of H, but G is allowed.
- S M E L T – fits the pattern S M E L T (all letters allowed).
- S W E L L – W is allowed, but “SWELL” is a valid word.
- S P E L L – P is allowed, “SPELL” is a variant spelling of “spell”, but “SPEEL” is more common.

The most common and likely word is “SPELT” (past of “speak”), but T is allowed. However, “SPELT” is less common. The next best is “SHELL” (but H is ruled out). 

Looking back, the only remaining letters for position 2 are from the allowed set. Position 5 must also be filled from allowed letters.

A valid word is S M E L T (S M E L T) – all letters are allowed and it fits the pattern.

Let’s choose S M E L T.

The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are:\n\n- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)\n- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)\n- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)\n- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - vowel-heavy\n- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)\n\nLooking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should include as many of these as possible without repeating letters.\n\nCRANE includes C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters. It's a strong choice because:\n- C is in the 10% most common letters\n- R is in the 10% most common letters\n- A and E are the most common vowels\n- N is also fairly common\n\nAnother excellent choice would be SLATE, which includes S, L, A, T, E - also all high-frequency letters.
