### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. I'll create a word using as many of these common letters as possible, while ensuring it's a valid 5-letter word.

A good candidate is ""RAISE"" - it contains R, A, I, S, E which are all very common letters. This should help me quickly identify which of these key letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (currently first, needs to move elsewhere).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).
- I, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word has the pattern _ A _ _ _
- It contains an R somewhere other than the first position.
- It does NOT contain I, S, or E.

Next guess should incorporate the known A in position 2, place the R in one of positions 3-5, and avoid I/S/E. Also, introduce new common letters to test.

A strong candidate is ""BARDY"":
- B: new common letter
- A: confirmed in position 2
- R: must be placed somewhere, here in position 3
- D: new common letter
- Y: new common letter (and avoids S/E/I)

This tests new letters while respecting the constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. I'll create a word using as many of these common letters as possible, while ensuring it's a valid 5-letter word.

A good candidate is ""RAISE"" - it contains R, A, I, S, E which are all very common letters. This should help me quickly identify which of these key letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (currently first, needs to move elsewhere).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).
- I, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word has the pattern _ A _ _ _
- It contains an R somewhere other than the first position.
- It does NOT contain I, S, or E.

Next guess should incorporate the known A in position 2, place the R in one of positions 3-5, and avoid I/S/E. Also, introduce new common letters to test.

A strong candidate is ""BARDY"":
- B: new common letter
- A: confirmed in position 2
- R: must be placed somewhere, here in position 3
- D: new common letter
- Y: new common letter (and avoids S/E/I)

This tests new letters while respecting the constraints.

Current confirmed facts:
- Pattern: _ A R _ Y  (positions 2,3,5 are fixed as A,R,Y)
- Letters NOT in the word: B, D, I, S, E
- Still need to determine the first and fourth letters.

We have 5 slots: 1 2 3 4 5
Known: 2=A, 3=R, 5=Y
Need two more letters for positions 1 and 4, avoiding B,D,I,S,E.

Common unused letters: C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, X, Z

Let’s pick two new common letters for positions 1 and 4. A good candidate is ""FARLY"":
- F for position 1 (new letter)

From the latest feedback:

- H is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- The fourth letter R is in the word but in the wrong position (it is currently in position 4, so it must move to position 4 is wrong, meaning it must be elsewhere, but position 5 is already Y. This seems contradictory because we know R is in position 3 from earlier feedback. Wait, let me re-read the feedback carefully.

Looking at Guess 5: HARRY -> Feedback: H(✓) A(✓) R(✓) R(-) Y(✓)

This means:
- H is correct in position 1.
- A is correct in position 2.
- R is correct in position 3.
- The fourth letter (second R) is in the word but in the wrong position. However, since R is already correctly placed in position 3, this second R must be indicating that there's another R elsewhere. But position 5 is Y, so the only other possible position for R would be position 4, but that's marked as (-), meaning it's wrong. This seems to imply there's no second R, which contradicts the feedback. 

Wait, this must mean that HARRY has an extra R that's not part of the secret word. The secret word has R in position 3 and no other R. Therefore, the fourth letter in HARRY (which is R) is an extra letter not in the word, but the feedback says it's in the word but wrong position. This seems like a contradiction, but I think it means that the secret word does have R in position 3 and no other R. 

Therefore, the pattern is now: H A R _ Y  
We need to determine the fourth letter. 

Eliminated letters for position 4: B, D, E, F, G, I, L, S, plus any others used so far. 

Remaining possible letters: C, K, M, N, P, T, V, W, Z, plus vowels O, U.

Looking for common 5-letter words starting with HAR and ending with Y:
- HARRY (already tried, failed)
- HARDY (D is eliminated)
- HARRY is the only common word, but it failed. 

Wait, let me think of others:
- HAMRY? Not a word.
- HARRY is the only common one. 

But since HARRY failed, maybe the word is HARDY, but D is eliminated. 

Looking at the feedback again, maybe the word is HARRY but the second R is allowed. However, the feedback for HARRY shows the second R as (-), meaning it's in the word but wrong position, implying there's another R not in position 4. But position 5 is Y, so no. 

This suggests the word must be H A R _ Y with the blank being a letter not yet eliminated. The only common word seems to be HARRY, but it failed. 

Wait, let me think of other possibilities:
- HARPY: P is still possible.
- HARBY: B is eliminated.
- HARRY is the only common one, but it failed. 

Looking back at eliminated letters: B, D, E, F, G, I, L, S. 

Possible letters for position 4: C, K, M, N, P, T, V, W, Z, O, U.

Common words:
- HARPY (P is possible)
- HARDY (D eliminated)
- HARRY (already failed)
- HARMS (S eliminated)
- HARMY? Not common
- HARCY? Not common
- HARKY? Not common
- HARTY? Not common
- HARVY? Not common
- HARZY? Not common

The most likely candidate is HARPY. Let me check if P is eliminated: no, P hasn't been used yet. 

So the next guess is HARPY.
