- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting letters include S, T, A, R, E, etc. A good starting word should also have a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information gain.

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""RAISE"" as it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should provide good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1, so R is not in position 1).

- I is not in the word.
- S is not in the word.

I need a word that ends with E, contains R and A, and avoids positions 1 for R and 2 for A. Also avoid I and S.

Some possibilities:
- TREAD (T, R, E, A, D) - R is in position 2, A in 4 - this fits.
- GRAFT (G, R, A, F, T) - but this doesn't end with E.
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) - R in 2, A in 3 - ends with E - this is good.

CRANE seems like a strong next guess as it places R in position 2 (allowed), A in position 3 (allowed), and keeps E in position 5.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting letters include S, T, A, R, E, etc. A good starting word should also have a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information gain.

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""RAISE"" as it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should provide good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1, so R is not in position 1).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 2, so A is not in position 2).
- I is not in the word.
- S is not in the word.
- E is in the word and in the correct position (it was in position 5, so E is in position 5).

So we know:
- Word ends with E.
- Contains R and A, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
- Does not contain I or S.

Possible positions:
- R cannot be in position 1.
- A cannot be in position 2.

I need a word that ends with E, contains R and A, and avoids positions 1 for R and 2 for A. Also avoid I and S.

Some possibilities:
- TREAD (T, R, E, A, D) - R is in position 2, A in 4 - this fits.
- GRAFT (G, R, A, F, T) - but this doesn't end with E.
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) - R in 2, A in 3 - ends with E - this is good.

CRANE seems like a strong next guess as it places R in position 2 (allowed), A in position 3 (allowed), and keeps E in position 5.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. E is fixed in position 5.
2. R is in the word and is now known to be in position 2.
3. A is in the word and is now known to be in position 3.
4. Letters that have been ruled out so far: C, I, S, N.

So the pattern is: _ R A _ E

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has R in position 2
- Has A in position 3
- Has E in position 5
- Does not contain C, I, S, N
- Has valid letters for positions 1 and 4

Possible letters for position 1: any letter except C, I, S, N (and must form a valid word)
Possible letters for position 4: any letter except C, I, S, N

Let’s brainstorm words that fit _ R A _ E:
- BRAVE – but V is okay, B is okay.  However, we already know A is in position 3, so BRAVE would be B R A V E – this fits perfectly.
- DRAPE – P is okay, D is okay.
- GRADE – G, D are okay.
- TRAPE – T, P are okay.

Among these, BRAVE is a common word and uses new letters (B and V) that haven’t been tested yet.

So I’ll guess BRAVE.

From the feedback on RAISE:

- Contains R and A, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
- Does not contain I or S.

Possible positions:
- R cannot be in position 1.
- A cannot be in position 2.

I need a word that ends with E, contains R and A, and avoids positions 1 for R and 2 for A. Also avoid I and S.

Some possibilities:

- GRADE – G, D are okay.
- TRAPE – T, P are okay.

Among these, BRAVE is a common word and uses new letters (B and V) that haven’t been tested yet.

So I’ll guess BRAVE.

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ R A _ E (R in 2, A in 3, E in 5)
- Letters ruled out so far: B, C, I, N, S, V
- Need two new letters for positions 1 and 4, neither of which can be any of the ruled-out letters.

Possible letters left (excluding ruled-out): A, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z
But A is already in position 3, so it can’t appear again. Similarly, no other duplicates are allowed because we already have R, A, E fixed.

Good candidates:
- DRAPE (D, P) – but P hasn’t been ruled out.
- GRADE (G, D) – both allowed.
- FRAME (F, M) – both allowed.
- PLACE (P, C) – C is ruled out, so invalid.
- TRADE (T, D) – both allowed.

Among these, GRADE uses G and D, both of which are still allowed and haven’t been tested yet.

So GRADE is a solid next guess.

We now know the exact pattern:

G R A _ E

with the only unknown letter being the 4th one.  
Letters already ruled out: B, C, D, I, N, S, V  
Letters still allowed for position 4: A, F, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z  
(Repetition is not allowed, since we already have G, R, A, E present.)

Scanning common English 5-letter words that fit G R A _ E:
- GRAPE – P is still allowed
- GRALE – not a common word
- GRAKE – uncommon
- GRAVE – V is already ruled out
- GRAME – not standard
- GRAOE – invalid

The only reasonable common word left is GRAPE.

The only common 5-letter word that fits G R A _ E and hasn’t been tried is GRAKE, but it’s obscure.  
Rechecking standard dictionaries, the only other plausible word is GRADE (already ruled out) and GRAPE (also ruled out).  
This suggests we missed a simpler word earlier.

Actually, the word GRAET doesn’t exist.  
But GRAFT does exist and hasn’t been ruled out yet (F and T are still allowed).  
Let’s verify: G R A F T – all letters are allowed and not yet tested.

Therefore, GRAFT is the next logical guess.
