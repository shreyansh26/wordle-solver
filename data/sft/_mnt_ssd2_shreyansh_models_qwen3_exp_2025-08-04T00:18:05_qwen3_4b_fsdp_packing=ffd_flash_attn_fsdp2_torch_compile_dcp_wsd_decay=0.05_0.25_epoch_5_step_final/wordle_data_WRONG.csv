For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Common starting strategies include using words with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is a popular first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of frequent letters in various positions, which should provide helpful feedback for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That means we can safely eliminate every word that contains any of those five letters.  
So our next guess should use entirely different letters.

Common letters that were NOT used yet include:  
- Vowels: I, O, U  
- Consonants: R, N, C, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

A good strategy is to pick a word that uses several of these remaining common letters.  
""PRIMO"" is a solid choice because it uses:  
P, R, I, M, O — all of which are still possible based on the previous feedback.  
It also includes two vowels (I, O) and three common consonants (P, R, M), giving us broad coverage for the next round.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, P, I, M
- Letters confirmed IN the word and in the right place: R in position 2
- Letter confirmed IN the word but in the wrong place: O (must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5)

Word structure: _ R _ _ _

Remaining possible letters (not yet eliminated): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus O which must go in one of the remaining positions.

Since O must appear somewhere, let's try a word that places O in a new position while keeping R fixed. A good candidate is ""CORNY"":
- C: possible
- O: must be in the word, now in position 2 but that's already R, so actually position 3 is fine
- R: confirmed in position 2
- N: possible
- Y: possible

But wait, ""CORNY"" has O in position 3 which is acceptable since O was only marked ""-"" in PRIMO, meaning it's in the word but not in position 5. 

However, looking at ""CORNY"" more carefully, the structure is C R O N Y, which would place O in position 3 - that's allowed. 

But actually, let me think of a word that better spreads the remaining letters. Another option is ""BROWN"":
- B: possible
- R: confirmed position 2
- O: now in position 3 (allowed)
- W: possible
- N: possible

But ""BROWN"" has O in position 3 which is acceptable. 

Alternatively, ""GROIN"" might be better, but G is possible and we have:
- G: possible
- R: position 2
- O: position 3 (allowed)
- I: already eliminated
So ""GROIN"" is invalid because I is eliminated.

Another option is ""DROWN"":
- D: possible
- R: position 2
- O: position 3 (allowed)
- W: possible
- N: possible

This seems solid. 

But let me think of a word that uses O in position 1 or 4 or 5. For example:
- ""ORBIT"" - but I and T are eliminated
- ""ROUND"" - has I and D, but I is eliminated
- ""FROZN"" - but Z is possible, N is possible, but this is not a valid word
- ""GROVY"" - not a valid word
- ""BROOK"" - has K, but O is in position 4 which is allowed, and we have B, R, O, O, K - but O was only ""-"" once, so double O might be okay

Actually, ""BROOK"" is a valid word:
- B: possible
- R: position 2 (confirmed)
- O: position 3 (allowed)
- O: position 4 (allowed - could be same letter twice)
- K: possible

But since O was only marked ""-"" once, it's possible the word has two O's. 

However, let me think of a word that better tests new letters. ""DROWN"" seems better as it tests D, W, N. 

But looking at ""DROWN"" - D R O W N - this has O in position 3 which is allowed.

I think ""CROWN"" is a good choice because:

- O: position 3 (allowed)
- I: already eliminated
So ""GROIN"" is invalid because I is eliminated.

Another option is ""DROWN"":
- D: possible
- R: position 2
- O: position 3 (allowed)
- W: possible
- N: possible

This seems solid. 

But let me think of a word that uses O in position 1 or 4 or 5. For example:
- ""ORBIT"" - but I and T are eliminated
- ""ROUND"" - has I and D, but I is eliminated
- ""FROZN"" - but Z is possible, N is possible, but this is not a valid word
- ""GROVY"" - not a valid word
- ""BROOK"" - has K, but O is in position 4 which is allowed, and we have B, R, O, O, K - but O was only ""-"" once, so double O might be okay

Actually, ""BROOK"" is a valid word:
- B: possible
- R: position 2 (confirmed)
- O: position 3 (allowed)
- O: position 4 (allowed - could be same letter twice)
- K: possible

But since O was only marked ""-"" once, it's possible the word has two O's. 

However, let me think of a word that better tests new letters. ""DROWN"" seems better as it tests D, W, N. 

But looking at ""DROWN"" - D R O W N - this has O in position 3 which is allowed. 

Alternatively, ""CROWN"" - C R O W N - same structure.

I think ""CROWN"" is a good choice because:
- C: new letter
- R: confirmed position 2
- O: now in position 3 (allowed)
- W: new letter
- N: new letter

This tests three new letters (C, W, N) while respecting the constraints.

Current knowledge:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, P, I, M, C
- Letters confirmed IN the word:
  – R is in position 2 (✓ from PRIMO and CROWN)
  – O is in the word and in the correct position 3 (✓ from CROWN)
- Letters confirmed IN the word but in wrong positions:
  – W (must appear elsewhere, not in position 4)
  – N (must appear elsewhere, not in position 5)
- Word structure so far: _ R O _ _

Remaining possible letters (not yet eliminated): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z, plus W and N which must both appear somewhere.

We have two blanks to fill: positions 1 and 4–5 (with the constraint that W and N must both appear, and not in their current positions).

Possible combinations:
- Position 1: any unused letter (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z)
- Positions 4–5 must include both W and N in some order, but:
  – W cannot be in position 4 (from CROWN feedback)
  – N cannot be in position 5 (from CROWN feedback)

Therefore:
- W must be in position 5
- N must be in position 4

So the word structure is: _ R O N W

Now we just need a valid letter for position 1 from the remaining set.

Looking at the remaining letters (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z), the most common that form valid words are B, D, F, G, H, K.

Testing possible first letters:
- B: BROND – not a valid word
- D: DROWN – but we already tried CROWN, and D is unused. DROWN is a valid word, but we have N in position 4 and W in 5, so DROWN fits _ R O N W structure. However, in CROWN, N was in position 5 and marked ""-"", meaning N is in the word but not in position 5 – which is consistent with N being in position 4 here. But DROWN would have D R O W N, which would place W in 4 and N in 5, but we need W in 5 and N in 4. So DROWN is invalid for this structure.
- F: FRONW – not a valid word
- G: GRO… but we need G in position 1: G R O N W – GRONW – not valid
- H: H R O N W – HRONW – not valid
- J: J R O N W – not valid
- K: K R O N W – not valid
- Q: not likely
- U: U R O N W – not valid
- V: V R O N W – not valid
- X: X R O N W – not valid
- Y: Y R O N W – not valid
- Z: Z R O N W – not valid

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. Maybe I need to reconsider the placement of W and N. Perhaps one of them is in position 1 and the other is in position 4 or 5, but position 1 is open.

Alternative approach: maybe the word has only one instance of W or N, but the feedback says both must appear. So both W and N must be present, each in a position different from their previous guesses.

From CROWN:
- W was in position 4 → cannot be there
- N was in position 5 → cannot be there

From PRIMO:
- O was in position 5 → now in position 3 (✓), so no restriction on O elsewhere

So possible positions:
- W can be in 1, 2, or 5 (but 2 is R), so 1 or 5
- N can be in 1, 2, or 4 (but 2 is R), so 1 or 4

We have structure: _ R O _ _

So:
- Position 1: either W or N or another letter
- Position 4: if N is here, then W must be in 5; if W is here, N must be in 1 or 4 (but 4 is W), so N would be in 1

Let's explore:
Option 1: W in 1, N in 4
Word: W R O N _

Need a valid 5th letter from remaining (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z)

Possible endings:
- W R O N D – not valid
- W R O N F – not valid
- W R O N G – not valid
- W R O N K – not valid
- W R O N B – not valid
- etc. – none seem valid

Option 2: N in 1, W in 5
Word: N R O _ W

Need a valid letter for position 4 from remaining letters (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z)

Possible:
- N R O B W – not valid
- N R O D W – not valid
- N R O F W – not valid
- N R O G W – not valid
- N R O K W – not valid
- N R O H W – not valid
- N R O U W – not valid
- etc. – none seem valid

Option 3: both W and N in positions 1 and 4 in some order
- W R O N _ – but we need W in 1 and N in 4, which we saw doesn't work
- N R O W _ – N R O W ? – need a valid 5th letter, but N R O W D – not valid

Option 4: maybe one of the letters is reused, but we've already determined W and N must both appear

Wait, perhaps I missed that position 1 could be W or N, and position 4 or 5 could be the other, but none of the combinations seem to form valid words.

Let me think of actual words that fit _ R O _ _ with R in 2 and O in 3, and containing both W and N somewhere.

Possible valid words:
- ""FROND"" – but D is possible, and it has N and D, but where is W? No W
- ""BRONX"" – not valid
- ""CRONY"" – but C is eliminated
- ""DRONE"" – but E is eliminated
- ""GROIN"" – but I is eliminated
- ""TROOP"" – but T and P are eliminated
- ""FROZE"" – but Z and E are possible, but no N
- ""FROST"" – but S is eliminated
- ""FROCK"" – but C and K are possible, but no N
- ""FROWN"" – this has F, R, O, W, N – exactly the letters we need!
- Structure: F R O W N – but this would have W in 4 and N in 5, but:
  – From CROWN, N in 5 was marked ""-"", so N cannot be in 5 – this is invalid
  – From PRIMO, W in 4 was not tested, but in CROWN W was in 4 and marked ""-"", so W cannot be in 4
  – In FROWN, W is in 4 and N is in 5 – both positions are disallowed

This is tricky. Let me re-examine the constraints more carefully.

From PRIMO: O was in 5 (-) – means O is in the word but not in 5. In CROWN, O was in 3 (✓) – so O is in 3.

From CROWN: W was in 4 (-) – means W is in the word but not in 4. N was in 5 (-) – means N is in the word but not in 5.

So word must contain:
- R in 2
- O in 3
- W somewhere not 4
- N somewhere not 5

Structure: _ R O _ _

Possible positions for W and N:
- W can be in 1 or 5 (cannot be 2 or 3 or 4)
- N can be in 1 or 4 (cannot be 2 or 3 or 5)

So possible combinations:
1. W in 1, N in 4 → Word: W R O N _
   Need a valid 5th letter from remaining (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z)
   – W R O N D – not valid
   – W R O N F – not valid
   – W R O N G – not valid
   – W R O N K – not valid
   – W R O N B – not valid
   – etc. – none seem valid

2. N in 1, W in 5 → Word: N R O _ W
   Need a valid 4th letter from remaining (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z)
   – N R O B W – not valid
   – N R O D W – not valid
   – N R O F W – not valid
   – N R O G W – not valid
   – N R O K W – not valid
   – N R O H W – not valid
   – N R O U W – not valid
   – etc. – none seem valid

3. W in 1, N in 5 → but N cannot be in 5 (from CROWN), so invalid

4. N in 1, W in 4 → but W cannot be in 4 (from CROWN), so invalid

5. Both W and N in 1 → impossible (only 5 positions)

6. Maybe one of them is reused in another position – but we've exhausted possibilities

This suggests that with the current constraints, there may not be a valid English word fitting all the feedback. However, I must have missed something.

Wait, let me think of actual words that fit _ R O _ _ with R in 2 and O in 3, and containing both W and N somewhere.

Valid words:
- ""FROND"" – no W
- ""BRONX"" – not valid
- ""CRONY"" – C is eliminated
- ""DRONE"" – no W
- ""FROST"" – no N
- ""FROZE"" – no N
- ""FROCK"" – no N
- ""FROWN"" – has W and N but positions conflict
- ""GROIN"" – I is eliminated
- ""PRONG"" – P is eliminated
- ""TRONC"" – not valid
- ""CRONE"" – no W
- ""BRONC"" – not valid

Actually, ""FROWN"" is the only valid word that contains both W and N in positions that fit the constraints, but in ""FROWN"" W is in 4 and N is in 5, which are both disallowed by previous feedback.

This seems like a contradiction. Let me re-examine the feedback:

From PRIMO: O(-) – means O is in the word but not in 5. In CROWN, O(✓) – means O is in position 3. So O is fixed in 3.

From CROWN: W(-) – means W is in the word but not in 4. N(-) – means N is in the word but not in 5.

So word must be: _ R O _ _

With W and N both present, and:
- W not in 4
- N not in 5

Possible positions:
- W can be in 1 or 5
- N can be in 1 or 4

So possible structures:
1. W R O N _ – but then where does the 5th letter come from? We need a letter that's not yet used, but this seems impossible because we've used W, R, O, N and need a 5th letter, but the structure is 5 letters already.

Wait, the structure is 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5.

We have:
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: O

So the word is: [1] R O [4] [5]

And it must contain both W and N in positions 1,4,5 with constraints:
- W not in 4
- N not in 5

So possible:
- W in 1: Word: W R O _ _ – then N must be in 4 or 5, but 5 is allowed for N (only 5 is disallowed for N is 5 from CROWN, but CROWN had N in 5 marked ""-"", so N cannot be in 5). So N must be in 4: W R O N _ – but then we have 5th letter needed, but we've used W,R,O,N and need a valid 5th letter from remaining letters (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z). The only valid word I can think of is ""WRONG"" – but this has W R O N G, which fits:
   - W in 1 (allowed)
   - R in 2 (fixed)
   - O in 3 (fixed)
   - N in 4 (allowed)
   - G is a new letter (allowed)
   - And it contains both W and N

""WRONG"" is a valid English word and fits all constraints:
- W is in position 1 (not 4)
- N is in position 4 (not 5)
- R is in 2
- O is in 3
- G is a new letter

This seems to be the correct next guess.
</think>

Based on the feedback so far:
- The word has the pattern _ R O _ _
- It definitely contains W and N, with W not in position 4 and N not in position 5
- The only valid 5-letter word fitting these constraints is ""WRONG"".

<guess>WRONG</guess>",WRONG,"Current knowledge:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, P, I, M, C
- Letters confirmed IN the word:
  – R is in position 2 (✓ from PRIMO and CROWN)

- Letters confirmed IN the word but in wrong positions:
  – W (must appear elsewhere, not in position 4)
  – N (must appear elsewhere, not in position 5)
- Word structure so far: _ R O _ _

Remaining possible letters (not yet eliminated): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z, plus W and N which must both appear somewhere.

We have two blanks to fill: positions 1 and 4–5 (with the constraint that W and N must both appear, and not in their current positions).

Possible combinations:
- Position 1: any unused letter (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z)
- Positions 4–5 must include both W and N in some order, but:
  – W cannot be in position 4 (from CROWN feedback)
  – N cannot be in position 5 (from CROWN feedback)

Therefore:
- W must be in position 5
- N must be in position 4

So the word structure is: _ R O N W

Now we just need a valid letter for position 1 from the remaining set.

Looking at the remaining letters (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z), the most common that form valid words are B, D, F, G, H, K.

However, in CROWN, N was in position 5 and marked ""-"", meaning N is in the word but not in position 5 – which is consistent with N being in position 4 here. But DROWN would have D R O W N, which would place W in 4 and N in 5, but we need W in 5 and N in 4. So DROWN is invalid for this structure.
- F: FRONW – not a valid word

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. Maybe I need to reconsider the placement of W and N. Perhaps one of them is in position 1 and the other is in position 4 or 5, but position 1 is open.

So possible positions:

- N can be in 1, 2, or 4 (but 2 is R), so 1 or 4

We have structure: _ R O _ _

So:
- Position 1: either W or N or another letter
- Position 4: if N is here, then W must be in 5; if W is here, N must be in 1 or 4 (but 4 is W), so N would be in 1

Let's explore:
Option 1: W in 1, N in 4
Word: W R O N _

Need a valid 5th letter from remaining (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z)

Option 2: N in 1, W in 5
Word: N R O _ W

Need a valid letter for position 4 from remaining letters (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z)

Possible:
- N R O B W – not valid

Option 3: both W and N in positions 1 and 4 in some order
- W R O N _ – but we need W in 1 and N in 4, which we saw doesn't work
- N R O W _ – N R O W ? – need a valid 5th letter, but N R O W D – not valid

Option 4: maybe one of the letters is reused, but we've already determined W and N must both appear

Wait, perhaps I missed that position 1 could be W or N, and position 4 or 5 could be the other, but none of the combinations seem to form valid words.

Let me think of actual words that fit _ R O _ _ with R in 2 and O in 3, and containing both W and N somewhere.

Possible valid words:
- ""FROND"" – but D is possible, and it has N and D, but where is W? No W
- ""BRONX"" – not valid
- ""CRONY"" – but C is eliminated
- ""DRONE"" – but E is eliminated
- ""GROIN"" – but I is eliminated
- ""TROOP"" – but T and P are eliminated
- ""FROZE"" – but Z and E are possible, but no N
- ""FROST"" – but S is eliminated
- ""FROCK"" – but C and K are possible, but no N
- ""FROWN"" – this has F, R, O, W, N – exactly the letters we need!
- Structure: F R O W N – but this would have W in 4 and N in 5, but:
  – From CROWN, N in 5 was marked ""-"", so N cannot be in 5 – this is invalid
  – From PRIMO, W in 4 was not tested, but in CROWN W was in 4 and marked ""-"", so W cannot be in 4
  – In FROWN, W is in 4 and N is in 5 – both positions are disallowed

This is tricky. Let me re-examine the constraints more carefully.

From PRIMO: O was in 5 (-) – means O is in the word but not in 5. In CROWN, O was in 3 (✓) – so O is in 3.

From CROWN: W was in 4 (-) – means W is in the word but not in 4. N was in 5 (-) – means N is in the word but not in 5.

So word must contain:
- R in 2
- O in 3
- W somewhere not 4
- N somewhere not 5

Structure: _ R O _ _

Possible positions for W and N:
- W can be in 1 or 5 (cannot be 2 or 3 or 4)
- N can be in 1 or 4 (cannot be 2 or 3 or 5)

So possible combinations:
1. W in 1, N in 4 → Word: W R O N _

   – W R O N G – not valid
   – W R O N K – not valid

   Need a valid 4th letter from remaining (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z)
   – N R O B W – not valid
   – N R O D W – not valid
   – N R O F W – not valid
   – N R O G W – not valid
   – N R O K W – not valid
   – N R O H W – not valid
   – N R O U W – not valid
   – etc. – none seem valid

3. W in 1, N in 5 → but N cannot be in 5 (from CROWN), so invalid

4. N in 1, W in 4 → but W cannot be in 4 (from CROWN), so invalid

5. Both W and N in 1 → impossible (only 5 positions)

6. Maybe one of them is reused in another position – but we've exhausted possibilities

This suggests that with the current constraints, there may not be a valid English word fitting all the feedback. However, I must have missed something.

Wait, let me think of actual words that fit _ R O _ _ with R in 2 and O in 3, and containing both W and N somewhere.

Valid words:
- ""FROND"" – no W
- ""BRONX"" – not valid
- ""CRONY"" – C is eliminated
- ""DRONE"" – no W
- ""FROST"" – no N
- ""FROZE"" – no N
- ""FROCK"" – no N
- ""FROWN"" – has W and N but positions conflict
- ""GROIN"" – I is eliminated
- ""PRONG"" – P is eliminated
- ""TRONC"" – not valid
- ""CRONE"" – no W
- ""BRONC"" – not valid

Actually, ""FROWN"" is the only valid word that contains both W and N in positions that fit the constraints, but in ""FROWN"" W is in 4 and N is in 5, which are both disallowed by previous feedback.

This seems like a contradiction. Let me re-examine the feedback:

From PRIMO: O(-) – means O is in the word but not in 5. In CROWN, O(✓) – means O is in position 3. So O is fixed in 3.

From CROWN: W(-) – means W is in the word but not in 4. N(-) – means N is in the word but not in 5.

So word must be: _ R O _ _

With W and N both present, and:
- W not in 4
- N not in 5

Possible positions:
- W can be in 1 or 5
- N can be in 1 or 4

So possible structures:
1. W R O N _ – but then where does the 5th letter come from? We need a letter that's not yet used, but this seems impossible because we've used W, R, O, N and need a 5th letter, but the structure is 5 letters already.

Wait, the structure is 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5.

We have:
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: O

So the word is: [1] R O [4] [5]

And it must contain both W and N in positions 1,4,5 with constraints:
- W not in 4
- N not in 5

So possible:
- W in 1: Word: W R O _ _ – then N must be in 4 or 5, but 5 is allowed for N (only 5 is disallowed for N is 5 from CROWN, but CROWN had N in 5 marked ""-"", so N cannot be in 5). So N must be in 4: W R O N _ – but then we have 5th letter needed, but we've used W,R,O,N and need a valid 5th letter from remaining letters (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z). The only valid word I can think of is ""WRONG"" – but this has W R O N G, which fits:
   - W in 1 (allowed)
   - R in 2 (fixed)
   - O in 3 (fixed)
   - N in 4 (allowed)
   - G is a new letter (allowed)
   - And it contains both W and N

""WRONG"" is a valid English word and fits all constraints:
- W is in position 1 (not 4)
- N is in position 4 (not 5)
- R is in 2
- O is in 3
- G is a new letter

This seems to be the correct next guess.Based on the feedback so far:
- The word has the pattern _ R O _ _
- It definitely contains W and N, with W not in position 4 and N not in position 5
- The only valid 5-letter word fitting these constraints is ""WRONG"".",Guess 4: WRONG -> FEEDBACK: W(✓) R(✓) O(✓) N(✓) G(✓),SUCCESS
