### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E)
- Two very common consonants (R, S)

This combination gives me good coverage of common letters and will likely provide useful feedback about which letters are present in the secret word.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Forbidden letters (never appear): A, R, O, S, U, I  
Letter that is in the word but not yet pinned down: T, E  
Exact positions ruled out so far:
- E cannot be in position 5 (from arose) nor in position 4 (from untie)  
- T cannot be in position 3 (from untie)  

So the secret word:
- Contains both T and E exactly once each.
- T is not in position 3; E is not in positions 4 or 5.
- All other letters are still possible.

To maximize information, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Uses T and E in new positions.
2. Introduces two or three fresh common letters that haven’t been tried yet.
3. Avoids every forbidden letter.

A good pool of unused common letters includes: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, Y, etc.

Candidate words:
- “THEME” – but E appears twice and we don’t know if E is allowed to repeat.
- “ETHYL” – contains Y, which is uncommon.
- “TENET” – repeats E and T, and we don’t know if repeats are allowed (but the puzzle usually allows single appearances).

A safer, more informative choice is “TENET” because it re-uses T and E in different positions while introducing N (already ruled out) – wait, N was in untie and ruled out.  
Let me rethink.

Better candidate: “METAL” – but A is forbidden.  
Next: “TWEED” – E repeats.  
Next: “THYME” – Y and M are new, but E repeats.

Actually, let’s pick “THYME”:
- T in position 1 (new).
- H, Y, M are fresh.
- E in position 4 (but E is forbidden in position 4).  
So invalid.

Another candidate: “FETID” – but I is forbidden and D is new.

Let’s choose “FETAL” – A is forbidden.

Next: “CLEFT” – E in position 2 (allowed), T in position 5 (allowed), C, L, F are new.

Yes, “CLEFT” fits all constraints:
- Letters: C, L, E, F, T  
- No forbidden letters.  
- E in position 2 (allowed).  
- T in position 5 (allowed).  
- Introduces C, L, F for information.

Therefore, I’ll guess CLEFT.

Available letters (have not been tested yet and are not forbidden): B, D, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (but N was in untie and marked “x”, so N is out).  
Better pool: B, D, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E)
- Two very common consonants (R, S)

This combination gives me good coverage of common letters and will likely provide useful feedback about which letters are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains E, but not in the 5th position
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses E (but not as the last letter)
2. Avoids A, R, O, S
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain

Good remaining common consonants: T, L, N, C, D, H, M, B, F, G, etc.
Good vowels: I, U (since A and O are out)

A strong candidate is ""UNTIE"":
- Uses E (not last) and I, U
- Uses common consonants N, T
- Avoids forbidden letters (A, R, O, S)

Let's try it.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Forbidden letters (never appear): A, R, O, S, U, I  
Letter that is in the word but not yet pinned down: T, E  
Exact positions ruled out so far:
- E cannot be in position 5 (from arose) nor in position 4 (from untie)  
- T cannot be in position 3 (from untie)  

So the secret word:
- Contains both T and E exactly once each.
- T is not in position 3; E is not in positions 4 or 5.
- All other letters are still possible.

To maximize information, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Uses T and E in new positions.
2. Introduces two or three fresh common letters that haven’t been tried yet.
3. Avoids every forbidden letter.

A good pool of unused common letters includes: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, Y, etc.

Candidate words:
- “THEME” – but E appears twice and we don’t know if E is allowed to repeat.
- “ETHYL” – contains Y, which is uncommon.
- “TENET” – repeats E and T, and we don’t know if repeats are allowed (but the puzzle usually allows single appearances).

A safer, more informative choice is “TENET” because it re-uses T and E in different positions while introducing N (already ruled out) – wait, N was in untie and ruled out.  
Let me rethink.

Better candidate: “METAL” – but A is forbidden.  
Next: “TWEED” – E repeats.  
Next: “THYME” – Y and M are new, but E repeats.

Actually, let’s pick “THYME”:
- T in position 1 (new).
- H, Y, M are fresh.
- E in position 4 (but E is forbidden in position 4).  
So invalid.

Another candidate: “FETID” – but I is forbidden and D is new.

Let’s choose “FETAL” – A is forbidden.

Next: “CLEFT” – E in position 2 (allowed), T in position 5 (allowed), C, L, F are new.

Yes, “CLEFT” fits all constraints:
- Letters: C, L, E, F, T  
- No forbidden letters.  
- E in position 2 (allowed).  
- T in position 5 (allowed).  
- Introduces C, L, F for information.

Therefore, I’ll guess CLEFT.

From all feedback so far:

- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, S, U, I, C, L, F, M, Y.  
- Available letters left: B, D, G, J, K, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (plus T and H which we know are in the word).

The word pattern is:

with T somewhere in positions 1 or 4 (since positions 2, 5 are ruled out for T) and H somewhere else (but not position 4, since it was marked “-” there in methy).

4. _ _ E T H  (T in 4, H in 5) – but H was in 4 and marked “-”, so H could be in 5.  
5. _ H E T _  (T in 4)

   Then H must be in 2 or 5.  
   Pattern: _ H E T _  or  _ _ E T H  

Now we need to pick a word that fits one of these patterns using only allowed letters.

Let’s try:
- T H E _ _ : need two more letters from allowed set (B, D, G, J, K, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z).  
  Possible: T H E N K  – but N was in untie and ruled out (x in position 2).  
  T H E D Y – Y is forbidden.  
  T H E B N – B and N are allowed, but word must be valid.  
  T H E B _ – need another letter.  
  T H E B K – “THEBK” is not a valid English word.

- T _ E _ H : need letters 2 and 5 from allowed set.  
  T W E E H – not valid, E repeats.  
  T W E N H – “TWE NH” not valid.  
  T P E D H – “TPEDH” not valid.

- _ H E T _ : need letters 1 and 5.  
  B H E T Z – “B HET Z” not valid.  
  D H E T N – “DHET N” not valid.  
  P H E T Z – “PHETZ” not valid.  
  V H E T Z – “V HET Z” not valid.  
  N H E T Z – “NHETZ” not valid.  
  W H E T Z – “WHETZ” is close to “WHETS” but not valid.

- _ _ E T H : need letters 1 and 2.  
  B R E T H – R is forbidden.  
  B L E T H – L is forbidden.  
  D R E T H – R forbidden.  
  D I E T H – I forbidden.  
  G R E T H – R forbidden.  
  J O E T H – O forbidden.  
  K I E T H – I forbidden.  
  N E E T H – E repeats.  
  P R E T H – R forbidden.  
  V I E T H – I forbidden.  
  W H E T H – H repeats and valid placement issues.  
  B O E T H – O forbidden.  
  D O E T H – O forbidden.  
  G O E T H – O forbidden.  

Hmm, struggling to find valid words. Let’s try T in 1 and H in 5:  
T _ E _ H  
Need letters 2 and 4 from allowed set.  
T W E D H – “TWE DH” not valid.  
T B E D H – not valid.  
T G E D H – not valid.  
T P E D H – not valid.  

Wait, let’s try T in 4 and H in 2:  
_ H E T _  
Need letters 1 and 5.  
N H E T Z – not valid.  
P H E T Z – not valid.  
D H E T N – not valid.  

Let me think of valid English words that fit _ _ E T H or _ H E T _ or T H E _ _ etc.

Valid word: “T H E E T H” – no.  
Valid word: “T H E N K” – not valid.  

Wait, let’s list possible English words with E in 3, T in 1 or 4, and H somewhere.

Possible words:
- T H E N K – not valid.  
- T H E N S – S forbidden.  
- T H E N D – not valid.  
- T H E N K – invalid.  
- T H E B Y – Y forbidden.  
- T H E B R – R forbidden.  
- T H E B N – invalid.  

Another approach: look for 5-letter words with E in 3, T in 1 or 4, H somewhere, using allowed letters.

Valid word: “T H E B H” – invalid.  

Wait, let’s try T in 4 and H in 2:

Valid word: “B R E T H” – R forbidden.  

Wait, let’s try T in 1 and H in 2:  
T H E _ _  
Need letters 4 and 5.  
T H E D Y – Y forbidden.  
T H E D Z – invalid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E)
- Two very common consonants (R, S)

This combination gives me good coverage of common letters and will likely provide useful feedback about which letters are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains E, but not in the 5th position
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses E (but not as the last letter)
2. Avoids A, R, O, S
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain

Good remaining common consonants: T, L, N, C, D, H, M, B, F, G, etc.
Good vowels: I, U (since A and O are out)

A strong candidate is ""UNTIE"":
- Uses E (not last) and I, U
- Uses common consonants N, T
- Avoids forbidden letters (A, R, O, S)

Let's try it.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: untie -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(-) I(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Forbidden letters (never appear): A, R, O, S, U, I  
Letter that is in the word but not yet pinned down: T, E  
Exact positions ruled out so far:
- E cannot be in position 5 (from arose) nor in position 4 (from untie)  
- T cannot be in position 3 (from untie)  

So the secret word:
- Contains both T and E exactly once each.
- T is not in position 3; E is not in positions 4 or 5.
- All other letters are still possible.

To maximize information, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Uses T and E in new positions.
2. Introduces two or three fresh common letters that haven’t been tried yet.
3. Avoids every forbidden letter.

A good pool of unused common letters includes: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, Y, etc.

Candidate words:
- “THEME” – but E appears twice and we don’t know if E is allowed to repeat.
- “ETHYL” – contains Y, which is uncommon.
- “TENET” – repeats E and T, and we don’t know if repeats are allowed (but the puzzle usually allows single appearances).

A safer, more informative choice is “TENET” because it re-uses T and E in different positions while introducing N (already ruled out) – wait, N was in untie and ruled out.  
Let me rethink.

Better candidate: “METAL” – but A is forbidden.  
Next: “TWEED” – E repeats.  
Next: “THYME” – Y and M are new, but E repeats.

Actually, let’s pick “THYME”:
- T in position 1 (new).
- H, Y, M are fresh.
- E in position 4 (but E is forbidden in position 4).  
So invalid.

Another candidate: “FETID” – but I is forbidden and D is new.

Let’s choose “FETAL” – A is forbidden.

Next: “CLEFT” – E in position 2 (allowed), T in position 5 (allowed), C, L, F are new.

Yes, “CLEFT” fits all constraints:
- Letters: C, L, E, F, T  
- No forbidden letters.  
- E in position 2 (allowed).  
- T in position 5 (allowed).  
- Introduces C, L, F for information.

Therefore, I’ll guess CLEFT.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)

Guess 3: cleft -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(x) E(✓) F(x) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From all feedback so far:

Forbidden letters (never appear): A, R, O, S, U, I, C, L, F  
Letters that are in the word and already placed correctly: E in position 3  
Letters that are in the word but misplaced: T (cannot be in position 5)  

So the secret word has:
- E fixed in position 3.  
- T somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4.  
- Only two remaining unknown positions (1 and 2 or 4 and 5) need to be filled with letters that have not yet been ruled out.

Available letters (have not been tested yet and are not forbidden): B, D, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (but N was in untie and marked “x”, so N is out).  
Better pool: B, D, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z.

We need a word that:
1. Has E in position 3.  
2. Contains T in position 1, 2, or 4.  
3. Uses only allowed letters.  

Possible patterns:
- T _ E _ _  (T in 1)  
- _ T E _ _  (T in 2)  
- _ _ E T _  (T in 4)  

Let’s pick a word that fits one of these patterns and uses two fresh letters.  
Candidate: “WETTE” – but T repeats and E repeats, and we don’t know if repeats are allowed.  
Candidate: “BETTE” – same issue.  
Candidate: “HETTE” – same.  
Candidate: “METER” – R is forbidden.  
Candidate: “JETTY” – Y is allowed, but T repeats.  
Candidate: “METHY” – H and Y are allowed, T in 2, E in 3.  
This uses M, T, E, H, Y – all allowed, no repeats, T in 2 (allowed), E in 3 (correct).

Therefore, “METHY” is a valid next guess.

From all feedback so far:

- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, S, U, I, C, L, F, M, Y  
- E is fixed in position 3.  
- T is in the word but not in positions 3, 5, or 2 (from cleft and methy).  
  Therefore T must be in position 1 or 4.  
- H is in the word but not in position 4 (from methy), so H must be in position 1, 2, or 5.  
- Only two letters remain unknown (positions 1, 2, 4, 5 with some fixed).

Current pattern:
1 ? 2 E 3 ? 4 5 ?
with constraints:
- T must appear once in 1 or 4.
- H must appear once in 1, 2, or 5.
- All other letters must come from the remaining pool: B, D, G, J, K, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.
