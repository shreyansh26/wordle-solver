### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).

The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word. If any of these letters are in the word, the feedback will tell us if they're in the correct position or just present elsewhere. This will guide our next guesses efficiently.

From the two rounds of feedback we know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: S, T, E, P, I, D  
Letters that ARE in the word: L and A  
- L is not in position 2 (from SLATE) and not in position 2 again (from PLAID), so L ≠ 2  
- A is not in position 3 (from SLATE) and not in position 3 again (from PLAID), so A ≠ 3  

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both L and A
2. Places L somewhere other than position 2
3. Places A somewhere other than position 3
4. Uses only letters that have NOT been ruled out (no S, T, E, P, I, D)

Remaining common consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, R, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: A, U, O (since E and I are ruled out)

Let’s try to place:
- L in position 1, 3, 4, or 5
- A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5

A good candidate is “CLAMP”:

Letters are all still allowed.  
Positions:  
- L is in position 2 → but we know L ≠ 2 from SLATE, so this is invalid.

L is in position 2 → invalid (same reason).

Next: “CALM” – but we need 5 letters.

Next: “GALAX” – not a valid word.

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

But P is already ruled out (feedback for PLAID had P(x)), so P is invalid.

Next candidate: “BLANK”
- B, L, A, N, K  
Letters are all still allowed.  
Positions:  
- L is in position 2 → but we know L ≠ 2 from SLATE, so this is invalid.

Next: “FLANK”
- F, L, A, N, K  
L is in position 2 → invalid (same reason).

Next: “GLOAM”
- G, L, O, A, M  
A is in position 4 (allowed), L is in position 2 (invalid).

Next: “CLANG”
- C, L, A, N, G  
L is in position 2 → invalid.

Next: “CALM” – but we need 5 letters.

Next: “GALAX” – not a valid word.

Next: “COBALT” – too long.

Next: “CLARY” – Y is allowed, but let’s check “CLARY”:
- C, L, A, R, Y  
L is in position 2 → invalid.

Next: “BALMY”
- B, A, L, M, Y  
A is in position 2 (allowed), L is in position 3 (allowed), all letters are still allowed.

This seems valid:
- Contains L and A
- L is in position 3 (not 2)
- A is in position 2 (not 3)
- Letters B, M, Y are still allowed

Let’s go with BALMY.

Updated knowledge after all feedback:

Letters NOT in the word: S, T, E, P, I, D, B, M, Y  
Letters known to be in the word:  
- A is in position 2 (from BALMY: A(✓))  
- L is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from SLATE and PLAID)  

So the secret word looks like: _ A _ _ _  
and must contain L somewhere in positions 1, 4, or 5.

Remaining allowed letters (from the alphabet minus the ruled-out set):  
A, C, F, G, H, J, K, N, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Z  
(but we’ll focus on common ones: C, F, G, H, K, N, O, R, U, W)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A in position 2.
2. Has L in position 1, 4, or 5.
3. Uses only letters from the allowed set.

Possible patterns:
- L A _ _ _
- _ A _ L _
- _ A _ _ L

Let’s brainstorm words fitting these patterns with allowed letters.

1. L A _ _ _  
   LADY – D ruled out  
   LARK – K allowed, R allowed  
   LASS – S ruled out  
   LAVA – V allowed, A already used  
   LATCH – T ruled out  
   LARVA – R, V allowed, but A already used in position 2  

   LARK seems valid.

2. _ A _ L _  
   C A _ L _  
   CABLE – B ruled out  
   CANAL – N allowed, but A already in position 2  
   CARGO – G, O allowed  
   CARGO has G, A, R, G, O – but double G and we don’t know if G is allowed.  
   CARGO: letters C, A, R, G, O – all allowed.

3. _ A _ _ L  
   C A _ _ L  
   CAVAL – V allowed, but A already in position 2  
   CANAL – N allowed, but A already in position 2  
   CARGO – doesn’t end in L  
   HAVOC – doesn’t fit pattern  

   CARGO doesn’t end in L, so let’s think of others.  
   H A _ _ L – H allowed, but we need L at the end.  
   H A _ _ L – HAVEL – E ruled out  
   H A _ _ L – HAGGL – double G, L allowed  
   HAGGL seems possible but double G is a stretch.

Between LARK and CARGO, LARK fits the L A _ _ _ pattern perfectly and uses only allowed letters.

Let’s choose LARK.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).

The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word. If any of these letters are in the word, the feedback will tell us if they're in the correct position or just present elsewhere. This will guide our next guesses efficiently.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- L(-) – L is in the word but not in position 2.
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain S, T, or E.
- DOES contain L and A, but L is not in position 2 and A is not in position 3.

We now want a new guess that:
1. Keeps the known letters L and A in different positions.
2. Avoids S, T, E.
3. Introduces other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

A good candidate is “PLAID”:
- It has L and A, but in new positions (L in 2 → 3, A in 3 → 2).
- It avoids S, T, E.
- It introduces P, I, D, giving more information.

Other possibilities could be “FLANK”, “CLAMP”, etc., but “PLAID” feels like a strong test of the L and A while adding three new consonants.

From the two rounds of feedback we know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: S, T, E, P, I, D  
Letters that ARE in the word: L and A  
- L is not in position 2 (from SLATE) and not in position 2 again (from PLAID), so L ≠ 2  
- A is not in position 3 (from SLATE) and not in position 3 again (from PLAID), so A ≠ 3  

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both L and A
2. Places L somewhere other than position 2
3. Places A somewhere other than position 3
4. Uses only letters that have NOT been ruled out (no S, T, E, P, I, D)

Remaining common consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, R, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: A, U, O (since E and I are ruled out)

Let’s try to place:
- L in position 1, 3, 4, or 5
- A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5

A good candidate is “CLAMP”:
- C, L, A, M, P  
But P is already ruled out (feedback for PLAID had P(x)), so P is invalid.

Next candidate: “BLANK”
- B, L, A, N, K  
Letters are all still allowed.  
Positions:  
- L is in position 2 → but we know L ≠ 2 from SLATE, so this is invalid.

Next: “FLANK”
- F, L, A, N, K  
L is in position 2 → invalid (same reason).

Next: “GLOAM”
- G, L, O, A, M  
A is in position 4 (allowed), L is in position 2 (invalid).

Next: “CLANG”
- C, L, A, N, G  
L is in position 2 → invalid.

Next: “CALM” – but we need 5 letters.

Next: “GALAX” – not a valid word.

Next: “COBALT” – too long.

Next: “CLARY” – Y is allowed, but let’s check “CLARY”:

L is in position 2 → invalid.

A is in position 2 (allowed), L is in position 3 (allowed), all letters are still allowed.

This seems valid:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

<|im_start|>assistant
For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).

The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word. If any of these letters are in the word, the feedback will tell us if they're in the correct position or just present elsewhere. This will guide our next guesses efficiently.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- L(-) – L is in the word but not in position 2.
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain S, T, or E.
- DOES contain L and A, but L is not in position 2 and A is not in position 3.

We now want a new guess that:
1. Keeps the known letters L and A in different positions.
2. Avoids S, T, E.
3. Introduces other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

A good candidate is “PLAID”:
- It has L and A, but in new positions (L in 2 → 3, A in 3 → 2).
- It avoids S, T, E.
- It introduces P, I, D, giving more information.

Other possibilities could be “FLANK”, “CLAMP”, etc., but “PLAID” feels like a strong test of the L and A while adding three new consonants.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: PLAID -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(-) A(-) I(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: S, T, E, P, I, D  
Letters that ARE in the word: L and A  
- L is not in position 2 (from SLATE) and not in position 2 again (from PLAID), so L ≠ 2  
- A is not in position 3 (from SLATE) and not in position 3 again (from PLAID), so A ≠ 3  

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both L and A
2. Places L somewhere other than position 2
3. Places A somewhere other than position 3
4. Uses only letters that have NOT been ruled out (no S, T, E, P, I, D)

Remaining common consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, R, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: A, U, O (since E and I are ruled out)

Let’s try to place:
- L in position 1, 3, 4, or 5
- A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5

A good candidate is “CLAMP”:
- C, L, A, M, P  
But P is already ruled out (feedback for PLAID had P(x)), so P is invalid.

Next candidate: “BLANK”
- B, L, A, N, K  
Letters are all still allowed.  
Positions:  
- L is in position 2 → but we know L ≠ 2 from SLATE, so this is invalid.

Next: “FLANK”
- F, L, A, N, K  
L is in position 2 → invalid (same reason).

Next: “GLOAM”
- G, L, O, A, M  
A is in position 4 (allowed), L is in position 2 (invalid).

Next: “CLANG”
- C, L, A, N, G  
L is in position 2 → invalid.

Next: “CALM” – but we need 5 letters.

Next: “GALAX” – not a valid word.

Next: “COBALT” – too long.

Next: “CLARY” – Y is allowed, but let’s check “CLARY”:
- C, L, A, R, Y  
L is in position 2 → invalid.

Next: “BALMY”
- B, A, L, M, Y  
A is in position 2 (allowed), L is in position 3 (allowed), all letters are still allowed.

This seems valid:
- Contains L and A
- L is in position 3 (not 2)
- A is in position 2 (not 3)
- Letters B, M, Y are still allowed

Let’s go with BALMY.

<guess>BALMY</guess><|im_end|>

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 3: BALMY -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) L(-) M(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Updated knowledge after all feedback:

Letters NOT in the word: S, T, E, P, I, D, B, M, Y  
Letters known to be in the word:  
- A is in position 2 (from BALMY: A(✓))  
- L is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from SLATE and PLAID)  

So the secret word looks like: _ A _ _ _  
and must contain L somewhere in positions 1, 4, or 5.

Remaining allowed letters (from the alphabet minus the ruled-out set):  
A, C, F, G, H, J, K, N, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Z  
(but we’ll focus on common ones: C, F, G, H, K, N, O, R, U, W)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A in position 2.
2. Has L in position 1, 4, or 5.
3. Uses only letters from the allowed set.

Possible patterns:
- L A _ _ _
- _ A _ L _
- _ A _ _ L

Let’s brainstorm words fitting these patterns with allowed letters.

1. L A _ _ _  
   LADY – D ruled out  
   LARK – K allowed, R allowed  
   LASS – S ruled out  
   LAVA – V allowed, A already used  
   LATCH – T ruled out

2. _ A _ L _  
   C A _ L _  
   CABLE – B ruled out  
   CANAL – N allowed, but A already in position 2

   CARGO has G, A, R, G, O – but double G and we don’t know if G is allowed.  
   CARGO: letters C, A, R, G, O – all allowed.

3. _ A _ _ L  
   C A _ _ L  
   CAVAL – V allowed, but A already in position 2  
   CANAL – N allowed, but A already in position 2  
   CARGO – doesn’t end in L  
   HAVOC – doesn’t fit pattern  

   CARGO doesn’t end in L, so let’s think of others.  
   H A _ _ L – H allowed, but we need L at the end.  
   H A _ _ L – HAVEL – E ruled out  
   H A _ _ L – HAGGL – double G, L allowed  
   HAGGL seems possible but double G is a stretch.

Between LARK and CARGO, LARK fits the L A _ _ _ pattern perfectly and uses only allowed letters.

Let’s choose LARK.

   HAFNL – not a word  
   HAFOL – not a word  
   HAFRL – not a word  
   HAFUL – not a word  
   HAFYL – not a word  

   Looking at this, the only clean word that fits _ A _ L _ with allowed letters is CANAL, but L is in position 4 and all letters are allowed.  
   CANAL: C A N A L – A appears twice, but position 2 already has A, and we have no info against a second A.  
   Also, letters C, A, N, A, L – all are allowed (C, N, A, L are allowed; A repeats but that’s acceptable if the word allows it).

   CANAL seems to be the best remaining option.

Let’s verify:
- 5 letters: yes  
- A in position 2: yes (A is second letter)  
- Contains L: yes (L is fifth letter, which is allowed)  
- No forbidden letters: C, A, N, A, L – none of S, T, E, P, I, D, B, M, Y appear  
- Common English word: yes, CANAL is valid.

Therefore, the next guess should be CANAL.

Let’s summarize everything we now know from all feedback:

1. A is in position 2 (✓ from BALMY and CANAL).
2. L is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (from PLAID and CANAL).
3. Letters NOT in the word: S, T, E, P, I, D, B, M, Y, C, N.
4. Letters still allowed: A, F, G, H, J, K, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Z (but we’ll use common ones: F, G, H, K, R, U, V, W).

Pattern so far: _ A _ _ _
L must therefore be in position 1 or 5.

Possible patterns:
- L A _ _ _  (L in position 1)
- _ A _ _ L  (L in position 5)

Looking for 5-letter words that fit these patterns using only the allowed letters.

1. L A _ _ _  
   LAUGH – U, G, H allowed  
   LARK – already rejected  
   LAVES – E ruled out  
   LAVAS – S ruled out  
   LADY – D, Y ruled out  
   LAUGH seems valid.

2. _ A _ _ L

   G A _ _ L – GAMAL – not common  
   H A _ _ L – HAVOC – doesn’t end in L  
   K A _ _ L – not common  
   R A _ _ L – RAVEL – E ruled out  
   V A _ _ L – not common  
   W A _ _ L – not common
