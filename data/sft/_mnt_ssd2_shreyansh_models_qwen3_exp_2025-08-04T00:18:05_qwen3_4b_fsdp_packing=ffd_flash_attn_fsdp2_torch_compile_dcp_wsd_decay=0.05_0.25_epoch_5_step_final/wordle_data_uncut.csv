For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

One such word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common letter in English

This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: not in the word (x)
- L: not in the word (x)
- A: not in the word (x)
- T: in the word but wrong position (-)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The secret word contains T somewhere, but NOT in the 4th position (since T was in position 4 in SLATE and marked ""-"").
- The letters S, L, A, E are NOT in the word at all.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes T (but not in the 4th position).
2. Does NOT include S, L, A, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at remaining common letters: R, O, I, N, C, U, D, M, P, Y, etc.

A good candidate is ""TRIOT"" but that has T twice and T can't be in position 4. Another candidate is ""TROIK"" but K is less common. ""TORCH"" is good but has H which is less common. ""TRUMP"" is possible but has M and P.

A better choice is ""TROCK"" but again K is less common. Let me think of a word with T and common letters not yet used.

""TROCK"" is invalid (not a real word). ""TROCK"" isn't valid. ""TORCH"" is valid but has H.

Actually, ""TROCK"" isn't a valid word. Let me think of valid words. ""TROCK"" isn't valid. ""TROCK"" isn't valid.

Valid words with T and remaining letters: ""TROCK"" isn't valid. ""TORCH"" is valid. ""TROCK"" isn't valid.

Another approach: use T in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 and include other common letters not yet used.

""TROCK"" isn't valid. ""TORCH"" is valid. ""TORCH"" has T in position 1, O, R, C, H.

But H is less common. Let me try ""TRUMP"" - T in position 1, R, U, M, P.

This seems better as it uses T in position 1 and common letters R, U, M, P.

From the two rounds of feedback we know:

1. Letters NOT in the word at all: S, L, A, E, R, M, P
2. Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still uncertain: T, U
   - T appeared in position 4 in SLATE and position 1 in TRUMP, but was marked “-” both times, so T is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4.
   - U appeared in position 3 in TRUMP and was marked “-”, so U is in the word but not in position 3.

Therefore the unknown word must contain both T and U, and we still need to determine where T and U go, as well as what the other three letters are.

Letters still available (excluding the eliminated ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want a new guess that:
- Keeps T and U (since we know they’re in the word).
- Places T somewhere other than positions 1 or 4.
- Places U somewhere other than position 3.
- Uses three fresh letters from the still-available set.

A quick scan of common 5-letter words that include T and U gives “COUNT” (but N is still possible), “OUTER” (but E and R are eliminated), “DUSTY” (but S is eliminated), “HUTTY” (but T is repeated), “BUILT” (but I is still possible), “COUTH” (rare), etc.

A good candidate that meets all constraints is “COUNT”:
- C, O, N are still possible.
- T is in position 4 here, but we already know T is NOT in position 4 (from SLATE feedback). So COUNT is invalid.

Next candidate: “BUILT”
- B, I, L are still possible, but L is eliminated (from SLATE feedback). So invalid.

Next: “DUTCH”
- D, C, H are still possible.
- T is in position 3 here, which is allowed (positions 1 and 4 are ruled out).

A good candidate is ""TRIOT"" but that has T twice and T can't be in position 4. Another candidate is ""TROIK"" but K is less common. ""TORCH"" is good but has H which is less common. ""TRUMP"" is possible but has M and P.

A better choice is ""TROCK"" but again K is less common. Let me think of a word with T and common letters not yet used.

""TROCK"" is invalid (not a real word). ""TROCK"" isn't valid. ""TORCH"" is valid but has H.

Actually, ""TROCK"" isn't a valid word. Let me think of valid words. ""TROCK"" isn't valid. ""TROCK"" isn't valid.

Valid words with T and remaining letters: ""TROCK"" isn't valid. ""TORCH"" is valid. ""TROCK"" isn't valid.

Another approach: use T in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 and include other common letters not yet used.

""TROCK"" isn't valid. ""TORCH"" is valid. ""TORCH"" has T in position 1, O, R, C, H.

But H is less common. Let me try ""TRUMP"" - T in position 1, R, U, M, P.

This seems better as it uses T in position 1 and common letters R, U, M, P.

So I'll go with ""TRUMP"".

From the two rounds of feedback we know:

1. Letters NOT in the word at all: S, L, A, E, R, M, P
2. Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still uncertain: T, U
   - T appeared in position 4 in SLATE and position 1 in TRUMP, but was marked “-” both times, so T is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4.
   - U appeared in position 3 in TRUMP and was marked “-”, so U is in the word but not in position 3.

Therefore the unknown word must contain both T and U, and we still need to determine where T and U go, as well as what the other three letters are.

Letters still available (excluding the eliminated ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want a new guess that:
- Keeps T and U (since we know they’re in the word).
- Places T somewhere other than positions 1 or 4.
- Places U somewhere other than position 3.
- Uses three fresh letters from the still-available set.

A quick scan of common 5-letter words that include T and U gives “COUNT” (but N is still possible), “OUTER” (but E and R are eliminated), “DUSTY” (but S is eliminated), “HUTTY” (but T is repeated), “BUILT” (but I is still possible), “COUTH” (rare), etc.

A good candidate that meets all constraints is “COUNT”:
- C, O, N are still possible.
- T is in position 4 here, but we already know T is NOT in position 4 (from SLATE feedback). So COUNT is invalid.

Next candidate: “BUILT”

Now we have three rounds of feedback.

1. Eliminated letters: S, L, A, E, R, M, P, D, H  
   (they all got “x”).

2. Known letters that ARE in the word, but we still don’t know their exact spots:
   - T (not in positions 1, 3, 4)  
   - U (not in positions 2, 3)  
   - C (not in position 4)

So the remaining letters that can still appear are:  
B, F, G, I, J, K, N, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
plus the confirmed letters T, U, C (but in unknown positions).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains T, U, C  
- Places T only in positions 2 or 5 (positions 1, 3, 4 are ruled out)  
- Places U only in positions 1, 4, 5 (positions 2, 3 are ruled out)  
- Places C only in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (position 4 is ruled out)  
- Uses two additional letters from the still-allowed set {B, F, G, I, J, K, N, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z}

Let’s list possibilities that satisfy all constraints:

- C must appear somewhere.  
- T must appear in 2 or 5.  
- U must appear in 1, 4, or 5.

Quick scan:
- C can be in 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
- T can be in 2 or 5.  
- U can be in 1, 4, or 5.

A valid pattern emerges:  
C _ U _ T (but T would be in 4, which is invalid).  
T must be in 2 or 5.

Try T in position 2:  
_ T _ _ _  
Then U must be in 1, 4, or 5.  
If U is in 1: U T _ _ _  
We still need C somewhere (positions 3 or 5).  
U T C _ _ or U T _ _ C.  
We also need two more letters.

Example: U T C _ _ → need two more letters, preferably common.  
Possible word: U T C _ _ → “UTC??” not helpful.  
Try “UTICK” – but K is allowed, I is allowed.  
“UTICK” is a valid word meaning a ticklish sensation.

Check constraints:
- U in position 1 – allowed (was not in position 1 before).  
- T in position 2 – allowed (positions 1, 3, 4 ruled out).  
- C in position 3 – allowed (position 4 ruled out).  
- I and K are still allowed letters.  

This seems valid.

Another candidate: _ T _ U _  
Then C must be in 1, 3, or 5.  
Example: C T _ U _ → “CTU??” not a word.  
Try “B T _ U _” – but B and T are allowed, but we need C.  
“C T _ U _” – not forming a word.

“UTICK” seems the best available.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

One such word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common letter in English

This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: not in the word (x)
- L: not in the word (x)
- A: not in the word (x)
- T: in the word but wrong position (-)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The secret word contains T somewhere, but NOT in the 4th position (since T was in position 4 in SLATE and marked ""-"").
- The letters S, L, A, E are NOT in the word at all.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes T (but not in the 4th position).
2. Does NOT include S, L, A, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at remaining common letters: R, O, I, N, C, U, D, M, P, Y, etc.

A good candidate is ""TRIOT"" but that has T twice and T can't be in position 4. Another candidate is ""TROIK"" but K is less common. ""TORCH"" is good but has H which is less common. ""TRUMP"" is possible but has M and P.

A better choice is ""TROCK"" but again K is less common. Let me think of a word with T and common letters not yet used.

""TROCK"" is invalid (not a real word). ""TROCK"" isn't valid. ""TORCH"" is valid but has H.

Actually, ""TROCK"" isn't a valid word. Let me think of valid words. ""TROCK"" isn't valid. ""TROCK"" isn't valid.

Valid words with T and remaining letters: ""TROCK"" isn't valid. ""TORCH"" is valid. ""TROCK"" isn't valid.

Another approach: use T in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 and include other common letters not yet used.

""TROCK"" isn't valid. ""TORCH"" is valid. ""TORCH"" has T in position 1, O, R, C, H.

But H is less common. Let me try ""TRUMP"" - T in position 1, R, U, M, P.

Let’s tabulate what we now know.

Confirmed letters (must appear somewhere): T, U, C  
Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, A, E, R, M, P, D, H, I, K  

Positions ruled out so far:
- T cannot be in 1, 3, 4, or 2 (because it got “-” in positions 1, 2, 3, 4).  
  Therefore T must be in position 5.
- U cannot be in 2, 3, or 1 (it got “-” in positions 1, 2, 3).  
  Therefore U must be in position 4 or 5.  
  But position 5 is already taken by T, so U must be in position 4.
- C cannot be in 4 (from DUTCH feedback) and cannot be in 4 again (from UTICK feedback).  
  So C must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

So far we have the pattern:
_ _ _ U T  
and we still need to place C in 1, 2, or 3.

Available letters (not yet ruled out): B, F, G, J, N, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
plus the required C.

We need two more letters (since we already have U and T fixed) to fill the remaining two slots (positions 1, 2, or 3) and one of them must be C.

Let’s list possible patterns:

1. C _ _ U T  
   Need one more letter in position 2 or 3.  
   Example: C B _ U T → “CBUT?” – not a word.  
   C _ N U T → “C N U T” – not a word.  
   C _ B U T – “CBUT” – not a word.  
   C _ F U T – “CFUT” – not a word.  
   C _ O U T – “COUT” – not a word.  
   C _ N U T – “CNUT” – not a word.  
   C _ Y U T – “CYUT” – not a word.  
   C _ V U T – “CVUT” – not a word.  
   C _ G U T – “CGUT” – not a word.  
   C _ J U T – “CJUT” – not a word.  
   C _ Q U T – “CQUT” – not a word.  
   C _ Z U T – “CZUT” – not a word.  
   None of these seem valid.

2. _ C _ U T  
   Need one more letter in position 1 or 3.  
   Example: B C _ U T → “BCUT?” – not a word.  
   N C _ U T → “N C U T” – not a word.  
   F C _ U T → “FCUT” – not a word.  
   G C _ U T → “GCUT” – not a word.  
   J C _ U T → “JCUT” – not a word.  
   O C _ U T → “OCUT” – not a word.  
   Y C _ U T → “YCUT” – not a word.  
   V C _ U T → “VCUT” – not a word.  
   W C _ U T → “WCUT” – not a word.  
   X C _ U T → “XCUT” – not a word”.  
   Z C _ U T → “ZCUT” – not a word.  
   None of these seem valid.

3. _ _ C U T  
   Need two letters in positions 1 and 2 from the available set.  
   Possible combinations:  
   - B and F → BF – not a word.  
   - B and N → BN – not a word.  
   - B and O → BO – not a word.  
   - N and O → NO – not a word.  
   - F and N → FN – not a word.  
   - F and O → FO – not a word.  
   - G and N → GN – not a word.  
   - G and O → GO – not a word.  
   - V and O → VO – not a word.  
   - W and O → WO – not a word.  
   - Y and O → YO – not a word.  
   - Z and O → ZO – not a word.  
   None of these form valid words.

Wait, let’s double-check the dictionary more carefully.

Looking for real 5-letter words that end in “U T” and contain C somewhere in the first three positions.

- “COUT” is 4 letters.  
- “COULD” has D and L – eliminated.  
- “CUT” is 3 letters.  
- “BUILT” has I and L – eliminated.  
- “COUNT” has N – allowed, but we already saw it’s invalid because T would be in position 4.  
- “FOULT” – not a word.  
- “GOUT” – 4 letters.  
- “JUICE” – has I and C but E is eliminated.  
- “NOCT” – not a word.  
- “NOCTU” – not a word.  
- “VOGUE” – has G and E – E eliminated.  
- “BOGGY” – has G and Y – possible, but no C.  
- “COYUT” – not a word.  
- “CYTIC” – has Y and I – I eliminated.  
- “FUENT” – not a word.  
- “GUANO” – has A – eliminated.  
- “JUICY” – has I – eliminated.  
- “NOVUM” – has V and M – M eliminated.  
- “VOGUE” – already noted.  
- “WOVEN” – has V and N – no C.  
- “YOCUT” – not a word.  
- “ZOCLA” – has A – eliminated.  

Let me re-examine the constraints more carefully.

We have:
- Pattern: _ _ _ U T  
- C must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.  
- Remaining letters must be from {B, F, G, J, N, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z}.  

Let’s try:

- Position 1: N, Position 2: C, Position 3: O → N C O U T – not a word.  
- Position 1: N, Position 2: O, Position 3: C → N O C U T – “NO CUT” – not a word.  
- Position 1: F, Position 2: O, Position 3: C → F O C U T – “FO CUT” – not a word.  
- Position 1: G, Position 2: O, Position 3: C → G O C U T – “GO CUT” – not a word.  
- Position 1: B, Position 2: O, Position 3: C → B O C U T – “BO CUT” – not a word.  
- Position 1: V, Position 2: O, Position 3: C → V O C U T – “VO CUT” – not a word.  
- Position 1: W, Position 2: O, Position 3: C → W O C U T – “WO CUT” – not a word.  
- Position 1: Y, Position 2: O, Position 3: C → Y O C U T – “YO CUT” – not a word.  
- Position 1: N, Position 2: V, Position 3: C → N V C U T – not a word.  
- Position 1: N, Position 2: Y, Position 3: C → N Y C U T – not a word.  

Let’s try C in position 2:

- Position 1: N, Position 2: C, Position 3: O → N C O U T – not a word.  
- Position 1: F, Position 2: C, Position 3: O → F C O U T – not a word.  
- Position 1: G, Position 2: C, Position 3: O → G C O U T – not a word.  
- Position 1: V, Position 2: C, Position 3: O → V C O U T – not a word.  
- Position 1: W, Position 2: C, Position 3: O → W C O U T – not a word.  
- Position 1: Y, Position 2: C, Position 3: O → Y C O U T – not a word.  

Let’s try C in position 3:

- Position 1: N, Position 2: O, Position 3: C → N O C U T – not a word.  
- Position 1: F, Position 2: O, Position 3: C → F O C U T – not a word.  
- Position 1: G, Position 2: O, Position 3: C → G O C U T – not a word.  
- Position 1: V, Position 2: O, Position 3: C → V O C U T – not a word.  
- Position 1: W, Position 2: O, Position 3: C → W O C U T – not a word.  
- Position 1: Y, Position 2: O, Position 3: C → Y O C U T – not a word.  

None of these seem to form valid English words.

Let me re-examine the earlier steps for any possible mistake.

Wait, the feedback for UTICK was:
U(✓) T(-) I(x) C(-) K(x)

This means:
- U is in position 1 and is correct (✓).  
- T is in position 2 but wrong position (-).  
- I is not in the word (x).  
- C is in position 4 but wrong position (-).  
- K is not in the word (x).

This changes the earlier interpretation!

Let me re-tabulate with the new information.

From Guess 4 (UTICK):
- U is in position 1 and correct (✓).  
- T is in position 2 but wrong position (-).  
- I and K are not in the word.  
- C is in position 4 but wrong position (-).  
- D, H, R, M, P, S, L, A, E are already eliminated.  

So now we know:
- Word starts with U.  
- T is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (it got “-” in positions 1, 2, 3, 4).  
  Therefore T must be in position 5.  
- C is in the word but NOT in position 4 (from DUTCH) and NOT in position 4 again (from UTICK).  
  So C must be in positions 2 or 3.  

Thus the pattern is:
U _ C _ T   (C in position 3)  
or  
U _ _ C T   (C in position 4 – but 4 is eliminated) → invalid.  
Therefore C must be in position 3, and the pattern is:
U _ C _ T  

We still need letters for positions 2 and 4 from the remaining available letters:  
B, F, G, J, N, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  

Let’s list valid 5-letter words that fit U _ C _ T.

- U N C H T – not a word.  
- U N C E T – E eliminated.  
- U N C T – too short.  
- U B C O T – not a word.  
- U B C H T – not a word.  
- U F C O T – not a word.  
- U G C O T – not a word.  
- U N C O T – “UNCOT” – not a word.  
- U N C H T – not a word.  
- U B C H T – not a word.  
- U N C Y T – not a word.  
- U N C V T – not a word.  
- U N C G T – not a word.  
- U N C J T – not a word.  
- U N C Q T – not a word.  
- U N C X T – not a word.  
- U N C W T – not a word.  
- U N C Z T – not a word.  

Let me try other combinations.

- U N C O T – not a word.  
- U N C H T – not a word.  
- U N C E T – E eliminated.  
- U B C O T – not a word.  
- U F C O T – not a word.  
- U G C O T – not a word.  
- U N C O T – not a word.  
- U N C H T – not a word.  
- U N C Y T – not a word.  
- U N C V T – not a word.  
- U N C G T – not a word.  
- U N C J T – not a word.  
- U N C Q T – not a word.  
- U N C X T – not a word.  
- U N C W T – not a word.  
- U N C Z T – not a word.  

Wait, let me check “UNCUT” – that’s a valid word.

- U N C U T – positions: U(1), N(2), C(3), U(4), T(5).  
  - Starts with U ✓.  
  - C is in position 3 ✓ (allowed).  
  - T is in position 5 ✓ (allowed).  
  - N is still available.  
  - U in position 4 – allowed (we only know U is in position 1).  

This seems to fit all constraints.

Let me verify:

Letters used: U, N, C, U, T  
- U appears twice – allowed.  
- N is still available (not eliminated).  
- C is in position 3 – allowed.  
- T is in position 5 – allowed.  
- No eliminated letters are used.  

Therefore “UNCUT” is a valid next guess.

- “COYUT” – not a word.  
- “CYTIC” – has Y and I – I eliminated.  
- “FUENT” – not a word.  
- “GUANO” – has A – eliminated.  
- “JUICY” – has I – eliminated.  
- “NOVUM” – has V and M – M eliminated.  
- “VOGUE” – already noted.  
- “WOVEN” – has V and N – no C.  
- “YOCUT” – not a word.  
- “ZOCLA” – has A – eliminated.  

Let me re-examine the constraints more carefully.

We have:
- Pattern: _ _ _ U T  
- C must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.  
- Remaining letters must be from {B, F, G, J, N, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z}.  

Let’s try:

- Position 1: N, Position 2: C, Position 3: O → N C O U T – not a word.  
- Position 1: N, Position 2: O, Position 3: C → N O C U T – “NO CUT” – not a word.  
- Position 1: F, Position 2: O, Position 3: C → F O C U T – “FO CUT” – not a word.  
- Position 1: G, Position 2: O, Position 3: C → G O C U T – “GO CUT” – not a word.  
- Position 1: B, Position 2: O, Position 3: C → B O C U T – “BO CUT” – not a word.  
- Position 1: V, Position 2: O, Position 3: C → V O C U T – “VO CUT” – not a word.  
- Position 1: W, Position 2: O, Position 3: C → W O C U T – “WO CUT” – not a word.  
- Position 1: Y, Position 2: O, Position 3: C → Y O C U T – “YO CUT” – not a word.  
- Position 1: N, Position 2: V, Position 3: C → N V C U T – not a word.  
- Position 1: N, Position 2: Y, Position 3: C → N Y C U T – not a word.  

Let’s try C in position 2:

- Position 1: N, Position 2: C, Position 3: O → N C O U T – not a word.  
- Position 1: F, Position 2: C, Position 3: O → F C O U T – not a word.  
- Position 1: G, Position 2: C, Position 3: O → G C O U T – not a word.  
- Position 1: V, Position 2: C, Position 3: O → V C O U T – not a word.  
- Position 1: W, Position 2: C, Position 3: O → W C O U T – not a word.  
- Position 1: Y, Position 2: C, Position 3: O → Y C O U T – not a word.  

Let’s try C in position 3:

- Position 1: N, Position 2: O, Position 3: C → N O C U T – not a word.  
- Position 1: F, Position 2: O, Position 3: C → F O C U T – not a word.  
- Position 1: G, Position 2: O, Position 3: C → G O C U T – not a word.  
- Position 1: V, Position 2: O, Position 3: C → V O C U T – not a word.  
- Position 1: W, Position 2: O, Position 3: C → W O C U T – not a word.  
- Position 1: Y, Position 2: O, Position 3: C → Y O C U T – not a word.  

None of these seem to form valid English words.

Let me re-examine the earlier steps for any possible mistake.

Wait, the feedback for UTICK was:
U(✓) T(-) I(x) C(-) K(x)

This means:
- U is in position 1 and is correct (✓).  
- T is in position 2 but wrong position (-).  
- I is not in the word (x).  
- C is in position 4 but wrong position (-).  
- K is not in the word (x).

This changes the earlier interpretation!

Let me re-tabulate with the new information.

From Guess 4 (UTICK):
- U is in position 1 and correct (✓).  
- T is in position 2 but wrong position (-).  
- I and K are not in the word.  
- C is in position 4 but wrong position (-).  
- D, H, R, M, P, S, L, A, E are already eliminated.  

So now we know:
- Word starts with U.  
- T is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (it got “-” in positions 1, 2, 3, 4).  
  Therefore T must be in position 5.  
- C is in the word but NOT in position 4 (from DUTCH) and NOT in position 4 again (from UTICK).  
  So C must be in positions 2 or 3.  

Thus the pattern is:
U _ C _ T   (C in position 3)  
or  
U _ _ C T   (C in position 4 – but 4 is eliminated) → invalid.  
Therefore C must be in position 3, and the pattern is:
U _ C _ T  

We still need letters for positions 2 and 4 from the remaining available letters:  
B, F, G, J, N, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  

Let’s list valid 5-letter words that fit U _ C _ T.

- U N C H T – not a word.  
- U N C E T – E eliminated.  
- U N C T – too short.  
- U B C O T – not a word.  
- U B C H T – not a word.  
- U F C O T – not a word.  
- U G C O T – not a word.  
- U N C O T – “UNCOT” – not a word.  
- U N C H T – not a word.  
- U B C H T – not a word.  
- U N C Y T – not a word.  
- U N C V T – not a word.  
- U N C G T – not a word.  
- U N C J T – not a word.  
- U N C Q T – not a word.  
- U N C X T – not a word.  
- U N C W T – not a word.  
- U N C Z T – not a word.  

Let me try other combinations.

- U N C O T – not a word.  
- U N C H T – not a word.  
- U N C E T – E eliminated.  
- U B C O T – not a word.  
- U F C O T – not a word.  
- U G C O T – not a word.  
- U N C O T – not a word.  
- U N C H T – not a word.  
- U N C Y T – not a word.  
- U N C V T – not a word.  
- U N C G T – not a word.  
- U N C J T – not a word.  
- U N C Q T – not a word.  
- U N C X T – not a word.  
- U N C W T – not a word.  
- U N C Z T – not a word.  

Wait, let me check “UNCUT” – that’s a valid word.

- U N C U T – positions: U(1), N(2), C(3), U(4), T(5).  
  - Starts with U ✓.  
  - C is in position 3 ✓ (allowed).  
  - T is in position 5 ✓ (allowed).  
  - N is still available.  
  - U in position 4 – allowed (we only know U is in position 1).  

This seems to fit all constraints.

Let me verify:

Letters used: U, N, C, U, T  
- U appears twice – allowed.  
- N is still available (not eliminated).  
- C is in position 3 – allowed.  
- T is in position 5 – allowed.  
- No eliminated letters are used.  

Therefore “UNCUT” is a valid next guess.",Guess 5: UNCUT -> FEEDBACK: U(✓) N(✓) C(✓) U(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
