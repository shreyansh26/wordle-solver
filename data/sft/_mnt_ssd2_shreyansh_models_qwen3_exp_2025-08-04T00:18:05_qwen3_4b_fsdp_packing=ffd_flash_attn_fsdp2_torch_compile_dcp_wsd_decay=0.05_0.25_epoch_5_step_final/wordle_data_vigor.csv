For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 vowels and common consonants. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"" are popular choices. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps test vowel positions
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English
- It's a valid 5-letter word

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.

- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters NOT present: A, S, E
- Letters present but misplaced: R, O
- R is not in position 2, O is not in position 3.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both R and O (since they’re confirmed in the word).
2. Does NOT contain A, S, or E.
3. Has R in a position other than 2.
4. Has O in a position other than 3.

Good candidate letters (excluding A, S, E): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I’ll try to place R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 and O in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

A word that fits: “FRONT”
- F: new letter, not ruled out

1. Contains both R and O (since they’re confirmed in the word).
2. Does NOT contain A, S, or E.
3. Has R in a position other than 2.
4. Has O in a position other than 3.

Good candidate letters (excluding A, S, E): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I’ll try to place R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 and O in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

A word that fits: “FRONT”
- F: new letter, not ruled out
- R: in position 2 (but feedback says R is not in position 2) → conflict, can’t use.

Next candidate: “ROUND”
- R: position 1 (allowed)
- O: position 2 (allowed)
- U, N, D: new letters
- No A, S, E

This seems valid.

Another candidate: “GROIN”
- G, I, N: new letters
- R: position 2 (disallowed) → reject.

“CORNY”
- C, N, Y: new letters
- R: position 3 (allowed)

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ROUND → R(-) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)

What we now know for certain:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, S, E, U, N, D  
Letters that ARE in the word but are currently in the wrong positions: R, O  
Specific position constraints:
- R is not in position 2 (from AROSE) and not in position 1 (from ROUND) → R cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
- O is not in position 3 (from AROSE) and not in position 2 (from ROUND) → O cannot be in positions 2 or 3.

So the remaining possible positions are:
- R can be in positions 3, 4, or 5
- O can be in positions 1, 4, or 5 (but cannot coincide with R)

We still need three more letters, none of which can be A, S, E, U, N, D.  
Good remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Good remaining vowels: I, Y (since O is already confirmed)

I want a word that places R and O in still-allowed positions and fills the rest with new letters.  
One candidate: “FORGY”

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after the three guesses.

Letters we have tried so far:
A, R, O, S, E, U, N, D, C, G, I

Letters that are NOT in the word (✗):
A, S, E, U, N, D, C, G

Letters that ARE in the word but are currently in the wrong positions (✓ exists, but position unknown):
R, O, I

So the secret word contains the letters {R, O, I} and two other letters chosen from the still-allowed set:
B, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

Position constraints we have gathered:
- R is not in positions 1 or 2 (from ROUND and AROSE)
- O is not in positions 2 or 3 (from ROUND and AROSE)
- I has never been tested in a specific position, so it is still possible anywhere

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains exactly the letters {R, O, I} plus two new letters from the allowed set.
2. Places R only in positions 3, 4, or 5.
3. Places O only in positions 1, 4, or 5 (but not overlapping with R).
4. Places I anywhere, but we must test new positions for it.

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these rules. A good candidate is “FRITZ”:
- F and Z are new letters (still allowed).
- R is in position 2 → but R cannot be in position 2 → reject.

Next candidate: “PROXY”
- P, X, Y are new letters.
- R is in position 2 → reject.

Another: “TRIO” – but it’s only 4 letters → reject.

“ROIL” – but O is in position 1 (allowed), R in 2 → reject (R cannot be in 2).

“IRONY” – contains N and D (already ruled out) → reject.

“FORUM” – contains U and M → U is ruled out → reject.

“FROND” – D is ruled out → reject.

“PROXY” – already rejected.

“TORCH” – contains C and H → C is ruled out → reject.

“FIRO” – only 4 letters → reject.

“ORBIT” – contains B and T → B is allowed, T is allowed. Let’s check:
- O in position 1 (allowed)
- R in position 3 (allowed)
- I in position 4 (new position)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 vowels and common consonants. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"" are popular choices. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps test vowel positions
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English
- It's a valid 5-letter word

1. Contains both R and O (since they’re confirmed in the word).
2. Does NOT contain A, S, or E.
3. Has R in a position other than 2.

Good candidate letters (excluding A, S, E): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s summarize everything we now know after four guesses.

Letters tried so far:

Letters that are NOT in the word (✗):
A, S, E, U, N, D, C, G, B, T

Letters that ARE in the word (✓ exists, but position still unknown):
R, O, I

We still need two more letters, which must come from the remaining untested set:
F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Position constraints we have:
- R is not in positions 1, 2 (from ROUND and AROSE) → R can only be in 3, 4, or 5.
- O is not in positions 2, 3 (from ROUND and AROSE) → O can only be in 1, 4, or 5 (but not in the same spot as R).
- I has never been tested in a specific position, so it could be anywhere, but we want to test new positions for it.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains exactly the letters {R, O, I} plus two new letters from the allowed set {F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z}.
2. Places R in 3, 4, or 5.
3. Places O in 1, 4, or 5 (but not overlapping with R).
4. Places I in any position not yet ruled out.

Let’s look for words that fit. One candidate is “FORUM” but U is already ruled out. Another is “FIRO” but it’s 4 letters. 

A valid candidate is “FRIZZ”:
- F and Z are new letters.
- R is in position 2 → but R cannot be in 2 → reject.

“PROXY” – P, X, Y are new, R in 2 → reject.

“ORFIC” – C is ruled out → reject.

“ROILY” – Y is allowed, but R in 2 → reject.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 vowels and common consonants. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"" are popular choices. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps test vowel positions
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English
- It's a valid 5-letter word

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters NOT present: A, S, E
- Letters present but misplaced: R, O
- R is not in position 2, O is not in position 3.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both R and O (since they’re confirmed in the word).
2. Does NOT contain A, S, or E.
3. Has R in a position other than 2.
4. Has O in a position other than 3.

Good candidate letters (excluding A, S, E): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I’ll try to place R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 and O in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

A word that fits: “FRONT”
- F: new letter, not ruled out
- R: in position 2 (but feedback says R is not in position 2) → conflict, can’t use.

Next candidate: “ROUND”
- R: position 1 (allowed)
- O: position 2 (allowed)
- U, N, D: new letters
- No A, S, E

This seems valid.

Another candidate: “GROIN”
- G, I, N: new letters
- R: position 2 (disallowed) → reject.

“CORNY”
- C, N, Y: new letters
- R: position 3 (allowed)
- O: position 2 (allowed)

Also valid.

Between FRONT (invalid), ROUND, GROIN (invalid), CORNY, etc., ROUND seems safe.

Let’s go with ROUND.

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ROUND → R(-) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)

What we now know for certain:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, S, E, U, N, D  
Letters that ARE in the word but are currently in the wrong positions: R, O  
Specific position constraints:
- R is not in position 2 (from AROSE) and not in position 1 (from ROUND) → R cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
- O is not in position 3 (from AROSE) and not in position 2 (from ROUND) → O cannot be in positions 2 or 3.

So the remaining possible positions are:
- R can be in positions 3, 4, or 5
- O can be in positions 1, 4, or 5 (but cannot coincide with R)

We still need three more letters, none of which can be A, S, E, U, N, D.  
Good remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Good remaining vowels: I, Y (since O is already confirmed)

I want a word that places R and O in still-allowed positions and fills the rest with new letters.  
One candidate: “FORGY”
- F, G, Y are new letters
- O in position 1 (allowed)
- R in position 3 (allowed)

Another: “CROFT”
- C, T are new letters
- R in position 2 → but R cannot be in position 2 → reject.

“PROXY”
- P, X, Y are new letters
- R in position 2 → reject (R cannot be in 2).

“FROND” was already rejected because D is out.

“CORGI”
- C, G, I are new letters
- O in position 1 (allowed)
- R in position 3 (allowed)

“CORGI” is valid.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after the three guesses.

Letters we have tried so far:
A, R, O, S, E, U, N, D, C, G, I

Letters that are NOT in the word (✗):
A, S, E, U, N, D, C, G

Letters that ARE in the word but are currently in the wrong positions (✓ exists, but position unknown):
R, O, I

So the secret word contains the letters {R, O, I} and two other letters chosen from the still-allowed set:
B, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

Position constraints we have gathered:
- R is not in positions 1 or 2 (from ROUND and AROSE)
- O is not in positions 2 or 3 (from ROUND and AROSE)
- I has never been tested in a specific position, so it is still possible anywhere

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains exactly the letters {R, O, I} plus two new letters from the allowed set.
2. Places R only in positions 3, 4, or 5.
3. Places O only in positions 1, 4, or 5 (but not overlapping with R).
4. Places I anywhere, but we must test new positions for it.

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these rules. A good candidate is “FRITZ”:
- F and Z are new letters (still allowed).
- R is in position 2 → but R cannot be in position 2 → reject.

Next candidate: “PROXY”
- P, X, Y are new letters.
- R is in position 2 → reject.

Another: “TRIO” – but it’s only 4 letters → reject.

“ROIL” – but O is in position 1 (allowed), R in 2 → reject (R cannot be in 2).

“IRONY” – contains N and D (already ruled out) → reject.

“FORUM” – contains U and M → U is ruled out → reject.

“FROND” – D is ruled out → reject.

“PROXY” – already rejected.

“TORCH” – contains C and H → C is ruled out → reject.

“FIRO” – only 4 letters → reject.

“ORBIT” – contains B and T → B is allowed, T is allowed. Let’s check:
- O in position 1 (allowed)
- R in position 3 (allowed)
- I in position 4 (new position)
- B and T are new letters (allowed)

We now have five letters that are definitely in the word: R, O, I.  
We have also eliminated the following letters entirely:  
A, S, E, U, N, D, C, G, B, T, F, Y.

That leaves only these letters still untested:  
H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need two more distinct letters from this remaining set to form a 5-letter word with R, O, I.

Position constraints that remain:
- R cannot be in positions 1 or 2 → must be in 3, 4, or 5.
- O cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → must be in 1, 4, or 5 (and not overlapping R).
- I has no positional restrictions yet.

We are looking for a valid English word that uses the letters {R, O, I, ?, ?}, where the two question marks are distinct letters from the remaining set {H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z}.

Possible candidates:
- R must be in 3, 4, or 5.
- O must be in 1, 4, or 5 (but not where R is).
- Let’s try placing R in position 3 and O in position 1: O _ R _ _
  We need two more letters from the remaining set. A word that fits is “ORLIK” (but L and K are allowed). However, “ORLIK” is not a common English word.

Another arrangement: R in 4, O in 1: O _ _ R _
We need two letters. “O” + “M” + “I” + “R” + “L” → “OMIRL” – not a word.

R in 4, O in 5: _ _ _ R O  
We need three letters: let’s try “M” and “P” → “MPRIO” – not a word.

R in 5, O in 1: O _ _ _ R  
We need three letters: “O” + “I” + “M” + “P” + “R” → “OIMPR” – not a word.

R in 3, O in 4: _ _ R O _  
We need three letters: “P”, “I”, “M” → “P I R O _” – but we need a fifth letter. “PIROM” – not a word.

R in 3, O in 5: _ _ R _ O  
We need three letters: “M”, “I”, “L” → “M I R _ O” – but we need a fourth letter. “MIRO_” – “MIRO” needs a fifth letter. “MIROW” – not a word.

R in 4, O in 5: _ _ _ R O  
We need three letters: “M”, “I”, “L” → “M I _ R O” – but we need a third letter. “MI _ R O” – “MIKRO” – not a word.

R in 5, O in 4: _ _ _ O R  
We need three letters: “M”, “I”, “L” → “M I _ O R” – but we need a third letter. “MIKOR” – not a word.

R in 5, O in 1: O _ _ _ R  
We need three letters: “O” + “I” + “M” + “L” → “O I M L R” – not a word.

We need three letters: “O” + “I” + “M” + “L” → “O I M R _” – but we need a fifth letter. “OIMR_” – “OIMRX” – not a word.

R in 2 – but R cannot be in 2 → reject.

Let me try a different approach. We need a real 5-letter English word that contains R, O, I and two letters from {H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z}, with R, O, I already placed correctly or not yet.

After scanning common 5-letter words, one that fits is “KIRUV” – but U is already ruled out.

Another candidate: “PRIMO” – but O is in position 3, which is disallowed.

“PROXY” – X and Y, but Y is ruled out.

“ROILY” – Y is ruled out.

“ORRIV” – not a word.

“ORRKY” – Y is ruled out.

“ORRUM” – U is ruled out.

“ORRUX” – not a word.

“ORRIZ” seems the closest, but is not standard.

Let me try “KIRUV” – U is ruled out.

“PIRRO” – double R, but is it valid? “PIRRO” is a word (a type of wasp).

“PIRRO” uses P, I, R, R, O – but we need distinct letters? No, letters can repeat unless the word itself doesn’t. “PIRRO” is valid and uses P, I, R, R, O – but we already have R, O, I confirmed, and P is allowed. However, it repeats R which might not be the case.

But the secret word could have repeated letters. Let me check if “PIRRO” is valid – yes, it is.

“PIRRO” has:
- P (allowed)
- I (confirmed)
- R (confirmed, in position 3)
- R (again)
- O (confirmed, in position 5)

This fits all constraints:
- R is in position 3 (allowed)
- O is in position 5 (allowed)
- I is in position 2 (new position tested)
- P is a new allowed letter

This seems like the best possible guess under the constraints.
