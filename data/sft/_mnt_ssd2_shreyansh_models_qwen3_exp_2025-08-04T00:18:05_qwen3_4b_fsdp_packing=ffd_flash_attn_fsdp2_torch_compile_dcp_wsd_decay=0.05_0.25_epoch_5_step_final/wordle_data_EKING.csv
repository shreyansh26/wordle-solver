### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some popular starting words include:

- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)

Looking at these options, I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels that might appear in many 5-letter words. This should give me good information about which of these common letters are present in the secret word.

- ""MENUS"" (but S is eliminated).
- ""FLEEN"" (F, L, E, E, N) – E is in 3 and 4, N in 5. This could work.
- ""PENNY"" (but Y is allowed, N is in 2 and 5, E in 3).

I'll choose ""UNTIE"" because it uses U, N, T, I, E – all allowed letters, with E in 4 and N in 2. This should give good info about remaining letters and positions.

Let's summarize everything we know so far.

Letters that are NOT in the word:
A, R, O, S, B, C, H, U, T

Letters that ARE in the word:
- E (must appear at least once)
- N (must appear at least once)
- I (must appear at least once)

Positions ruled out for each letter:
- E cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 5 (from BENCH and UNTIE feedback)
  ⇒ E must be in position 1 or 3.
- N cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from BENCH and UNTIE feedback)
  ⇒ N must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- I cannot be in position 4 (from UNTIE feedback)
  ⇒ I must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains E, N, I (each at least once)
2. Uses only letters not yet eliminated (no A, R, O, S, B, C, H, U, T)
3. Respects the positional restrictions above.

Available letters: D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the required E, N, I.

Let's try to construct a word:
- If E is in position 1, then N can be in 4 or 5, and I can be in 2 or 3.
  Example: E I N D ?  → but needs 5 letters and must use each required letter once.
  Try: E N I ? ?  → but N would be in 2 which is invalid.
  Try: I N E ? ?  → but E must be in 1 or 3, so this is invalid.
  
- If E is in position 3, then:
  N can be in 1, 4, or 5.
  I can be in 1, 2, or 5 (but not 4).

Let's try N in 1, I in 2, E in 3:
N I E ? ?  → need two more letters from available ones (D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z)
Possible endings: N I E D ?  → but needs a valid word.
""NIED "" is not a word. ""NIE D?"" doesn't work.

Try N in 1, I in 5, E in 3:
N ? E ? I  → need letters 2 and 4 from available.
""N D E L I"" → N D E L I is not a word.
""N G E M I"" → no.
""N F E D I"" → no.

Try N in 4, I in 2, E in 3:
? I E N ?  → need letters 1 and 5.
""D I E N ?"" → ""DIEN?"" no.
""F I E N ?"" → ""FIEN?"" no.
""L I E N ?"" → ""LIEN?"" no.
""M I E N ?"" → ""MIEN?"" no.

Try N in 5, I in 2, E in 3:
? I E ? N  → need letters 1 and 4.
""D I E L N"" → ""DIELN"" no.
""F I E L N"" → ""FIELN"" no.
""L I E D N"" → ""LIEDN"" no.
""M I E D N"" → ""MIEDN"" no.

Try N in 5, I in 1, E in 3:
I ? E ? N  → need letters 2 and 4.
""I D E L N"" → ""IDELN"" no.
""I F E D N"" → ""IFEDN"" no.
""I L E D N"" → ""ILEDN"" no.
""I M E D N"" → ""IMEDN"" no.

This is tricky. Maybe we need to use a different arrangement.

Alternative: Use a word where letters are reused but still valid.
But we have no information that letters are reused, so we should assume each of E, N, I appears exactly once.

Let me think of valid 5-letter words that contain E, N, I and avoid all eliminated letters.

Possible words:
- ""FLEIN"" – but not valid.
- ""DINER"" – but R is eliminated.
- ""LINER"" – R is eliminated.
- ""WOKEN"" – but O is eliminated.
- ""JINER"" – R is eliminated.
- ""GIVEN"" – but V is allowed, I is allowed, N is allowed, G is allowed, E is allowed.
  Check positions:
  G(1) I(2) V(3) E(4) N(5)
  - E is in 4 – but E cannot be in 4 (from UNTIE feedback).
  So ""GIVEN"" is invalid.

- ""MINED"":
  M(1) I(2) N(3) E(4) D(5)
  - N is in 3 – but N cannot be in 3 (from UNTIE feedback).
  Invalid.

- ""FINED"":
  F(1) I(2) N(3) E(4) D(5)
  - Same issue, N in 3 is invalid.

- ""WINED"":
  W(1) I(2) N(3) E(4) D(5)
  - N in 3 is invalid.

- ""LINED"":
  L(1) I(2) N(3) E(4) D(5)
  - N in 3 is invalid.

- ""VINED"":
  V(1) I(2) N(3) E(4) D(5)
  - N in 3 is invalid.

- ""KINED"":
  K(1) I(2) N(3) E(4) D(5)
  - N in 3 is invalid.

- ""PINED"":
  P(1) I(2) N(3) E(4) D(5)
  - N in 3 is invalid.

- ""XINED"":
  X(1) I(2) N(3) E(4) D(5)
  - N in 3 is invalid.

- ""YINED"":
  Y(1) I(2) N(3) E(4) D(5)
  - N in 3 is invalid.

- ""ZINED"":
  Z(1) I(2) N(3) E(4) D(5)
  - N in 3 is invalid.

This path is not working. Let's try E in position 1.

E _ _ _ _ with N and I somewhere, avoiding eliminated letters.

Possible:
E N I ? ?  → but N would be in 2 which is invalid (from UNTIE feedback, N cannot be in 2).
E I N ? ?  → N in 3 is invalid.

E _ N I ?  → N in 3 is invalid.

E _ _ N I  → N in 4, I in 5. This is valid for N (4 is allowed) and I (5 is allowed).
Need letters 2 and 3 from available: D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:
""E D N I ?"" → ""EDNI"" is not a prefix.
""E D L I N"" → ""EDLIN"" is not a word.
""E F N I ?"" → ""EFNI"" is not a prefix.
""E L N I ?"" → ""ELNI"" is not a prefix.
""E M N I ?"" → ""EMNI"" is not a prefix.
""E V N I ?"" → ""EVNI"" is not a prefix.
""E W N I ?"" → ""EWNI"" is not a prefix.
""E D N I Y"" → ""EDNIY"" no.
""E D N I K"" → ""EDNIK"" no.

This is also not yielding results. Let me think differently – perhaps the word uses a different set of letters.

Another approach: Use ""E"" in position 1 and ""N"" in 4 or 5, and ""I"" in 2 or 3.

Example:
E I ? N ?
Need letter 3 from available: D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Valid word: ""E I D N ?"" → ""EIDN?"" no.
""E I G N ?"" → ""EIGN?"" no.
""E I L N ?"" → ""EILN?"" no.
""E I M N ?"" → ""EIMN?"" no.
""E I V N ?"" → ""EINV?"" no.
""E I W N ?"" → ""EIWN?"" no.

""E ? I N ?"" with I in 3, N in 4:
Need letter 2 and 5.
""E D I N ?"" → ""EDIN?"" no.
""E F I N ?"" → ""EFIN?"" no.
""E L I N ?"" → ""ELIN?"" no.
""E M I N ?"" → ""EMIN?"" no.
""E V I N ?"" → ""EVIN?"" no.
""E W I N ?"" → ""EWIN?"" no.

""E ? ? I N"" with I in 4, N in 5:
Need letters 2 and 3.
""E D D I N"" → ""EDDIN"" is a word (variant of ""eddying""), but D is repeated.
""E D G I N"" → ""EDGIN"" is not a word.
""E D L I N"" → ""EDLIN"" is not a word.
""E D M I N"" → ""EDMIN"" is not a word.
""E D V I N"" → ""EDVIN"" is not a word.
""E D W I N"" → ""EDWIN"" – this is a valid word!

Check positions:
E(1) D(2) W(3) I(4) N(5)
- E is in 1 – allowed (positions 1 or 3).
- N is in 5 – allowed (positions 1, 4, 5).
- I is in 4 – allowed (positions 1, 2, 3, 5).
- Letters used: E, D, W, I, N – none are eliminated.
This seems valid.

Therefore, the next guess should be ""EDWIN"".
</think>

From all the feedback so far:
- Eliminated letters: A, R, O, S, B, C, H, U, T
- Must contain: E, N, I
- Position restrictions:
  - E must be in 1 or 3
  - N must be in 1, 4, or 5
  - I must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5

A valid word that satisfies these constraints is ""EDWIN"":
- E in position 1 (allowed)
- D, W are new letters (not yet eliminated)
- I in position 4 (allowed)
- N in position 5 (allowed)

- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)

Looking at these options, I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels that might appear in many 5-letter words. This should give me good information about which of these common letters are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.
- DOES contain E, but not in the 5th position.

Letters left to consider: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I need a word that:
1. Contains E (but not in the 5th position).
2. Avoids A, R, O, S.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good candidates:
- ""UNTIE"" (U, N, T, I, E) – E is in 4th position.
- ""ELITE"" (but E is in 1st and 4th positions; might be too vowel-heavy).
- ""MELON"" (but contains O, which is eliminated).
- ""BENCH"" (B, E, N, C, H) – E is in 2nd position.

I'll choose ""BENCH"" because it uses B, N, C, H (all new letters) and places E in the 2nd position. This should help determine if any of B, N, C, H are in the word and confirm the position of E.

Guess 2: BENCH -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) N(-) C(x) H(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on BENCH:
- B, C, H are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but not in position 2 (it was in position 2, so now we know it’s not there).
- N is in the word but not in position 3.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, B, C, H.
- DOES contain E and N.
- E is not in position 5 (from AROSE) and not in position 2 (from BENCH), so E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
- N is not in position 3, so N must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Letters left to use: D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I need a word that:
1. Contains both E and N.
2. Avoids A, R, O, S, B, C, H.
3. Places E in 1, 3, or 4.
4. Places N in 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).

Good candidates:
- ""TENET"" (but T is repeated and E is in 2 and 4, but 2 is invalid for E).
- ""UNTIE"" (U, N, T, I, E) – E is in 4, N in 2. This seems valid.
- ""MENUS"" (but S is eliminated).
- ""FLEEN"" (F, L, E, E, N) – E is in 3 and 4, N in 5. This could work.
- ""PENNY"" (but Y is allowed, N is in 2 and 5, E in 3).

I'll choose ""UNTIE"" because it uses U, N, T, I, E – all allowed letters, with E in 4 and N in 2. This should give good info about remaining letters and positions.

Let's summarize everything we know so far.

Letters that are NOT in the word:
A, R, O, S, B, C, H, U, T

Letters that ARE in the word:
- E (must appear at least once)
- N (must appear at least once)
- I (must appear at least once)

Positions ruled out for each letter:
- E cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 5 (from BENCH and UNTIE feedback)
  ⇒ E must be in position 1 or 3.
- N cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from BENCH and UNTIE feedback)
  ⇒ N must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- I cannot be in position 4 (from UNTIE feedback)
  ⇒ I must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains E, N, I (each at least once)
2. Uses only letters not yet eliminated (no A, R, O, S, B, C, H, U, T)
3. Respects the positional restrictions above.

Available letters: D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the required E, N, I.

Let's try to construct a word:
- If E is in position 1, then N can be in 4 or 5, and I can be in 2 or 3.
  Example: E I N D ?  → but needs 5 letters and must use each required letter once.
  Try: E N I ? ?  → but N would be in 2 which is invalid.
  Try: I N E ? ?  → but E must be in 1 or 3, so this is invalid.
  
- If E is in position 3, then:
  N can be in 1, 4, or 5.
  I can be in 1, 2, or 5 (but not 4).

Let's try N in 1, I in 2, E in 3:
N I E ? ?  → need two more letters from available ones (D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z)
Possible endings: N I E D ?  → but needs a valid word.
""NIED "" is not a word. ""NIE D?"" doesn't work.

Try N in 1, I in 5, E in 3:
N ? E ? I  → need letters 2 and 4 from available.
""N D E L I"" → N D E L I is not a word.
""N G E M I"" → no.
""N F E D I"" → no.

Try N in 4, I in 2, E in 3:
? I E N ?  → need letters 1 and 5.
""D I E N ?"" → ""DIEN?"" no.
""F I E N ?"" → ""FIEN?"" no.
""L I E N ?"" → ""LIEN?"" no.
""M I E N ?"" → ""MIEN?"" no.

Try N in 5, I in 2, E in 3:
? I E ? N  → need letters 1 and 4.
""D I E L N"" → ""DIELN"" no.
""F I E L N"" → ""FIELN"" no.
""L I E D N"" → ""LIEDN"" no.
""M I E D N"" → ""MIEDN"" no.

Try N in 5, I in 1, E in 3:
I ? E ? N  → need letters 2 and 4.
""I D E L N"" → ""IDELN"" no.
""I F E D N"" → ""IFEDN"" no.
""I L E D N"" → ""ILEDN"" no.
""I M E D N"" → ""IMEDN"" no.

This is tricky. Maybe we need to use a different arrangement.

Alternative: Use a word where letters are reused but still valid.
But we have no information that letters are reused, so we should assume each of E, N, I appears exactly once.

Let me think of valid 5-letter words that contain E, N, I and avoid all eliminated letters.

Possible words:
- ""FLEIN"" – but not valid.
- ""DINER"" – but R is eliminated.
- ""LINER"" – R is eliminated.
- ""WOKEN"" – but O is eliminated.
- ""JINER"" – R is eliminated.
- ""GIVEN"" – but V is allowed, I is allowed, N is allowed, G is allowed, E is allowed.
  Check positions:
  G(1) I(2) V(3) E(4) N(5)
  - E is in 4 – but E cannot be in 4 (from UNTIE feedback).
  So ""GIVEN"" is invalid.

- ""MINED"":
  M(1) I(2) N(3) E(4) D(5)
  - N is in 3 – but N cannot be in 3 (from UNTIE feedback).
  Invalid.

- ""FINED"":
  F(1) I(2) N(3) E(4) D(5)
  - Same issue, N in 3 is invalid.

- ""WINED"":
  W(1) I(2) N(3) E(4) D(5)
  - N in 3 is invalid.

- ""LINED"":
  L(1) I(2) N(3) E(4) D(5)
  - N in 3 is invalid.

- ""VINED"":
  V(1) I(2) N(3) E(4) D(5)
  - N in 3 is invalid.

- ""KINED"":
  K(1) I(2) N(3) E(4) D(5)
  - N in 3 is invalid.

- ""PINED"":
  P(1) I(2) N(3) E(4) D(5)
  - N in 3 is invalid.

- ""XINED"":
  X(1) I(2) N(3) E(4) D(5)
  - N in 3 is invalid.

- ""YINED"":
  Y(1) I(2) N(3) E(4) D(5)
  - N in 3 is invalid.

- ""ZINED"":
  Z(1) I(2) N(3) E(4) D(5)
  - N in 3 is invalid.

This path is not working. Let's try E in position 1.

E _ _ _ _ with N and I somewhere, avoiding eliminated letters.

Possible:
E N I ? ?  → but N would be in 2 which is invalid (from UNTIE feedback, N cannot be in 2).
E I N ? ?  → N in 3 is invalid.

E _ N I ?  → N in 3 is invalid.

E _ _ N I  → N in 4, I in 5. This is valid for N (4 is allowed) and I (5 is allowed).
Need letters 2 and 3 from available: D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:
""E D N I ?"" → ""EDNI"" is not a prefix.
""E D L I N"" → ""EDLIN"" is not a word.
""E F N I ?"" → ""EFNI"" is not a prefix.
""E L N I ?"" → ""ELNI"" is not a prefix.
""E M N I ?"" → ""EMNI"" is not a prefix.
""E V N I ?"" → ""EVNI"" is not a prefix.
""E W N I ?"" → ""EWNI"" is not a prefix.
""E D N I Y"" → ""EDNIY"" no.
""E D N I K"" → ""EDNIK"" no.

This is also not yielding results. Let me think differently – perhaps the word uses a different set of letters.

Another approach: Use ""E"" in position 1 and ""N"" in 4 or 5, and ""I"" in 2 or 3.

Example:
E I ? N ?
Need letter 3 from available: D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Valid word: ""E I D N ?"" → ""EIDN?"" no.
""E I G N ?"" → ""EIGN?"" no.
""E I L N ?"" → ""EILN?"" no.
""E I M N ?"" → ""EIMN?"" no.
""E I V N ?"" → ""EINV?"" no.
""E I W N ?"" → ""EIWN?"" no.

""E ? I N ?"" with I in 3, N in 4:
Need letter 2 and 5.
""E D I N ?"" → ""EDIN?"" no.
""E F I N ?"" → ""EFIN?"" no.
""E L I N ?"" → ""ELIN?"" no.
""E M I N ?"" → ""EMIN?"" no.
""E V I N ?"" → ""EVIN?"" no.
""E W I N ?"" → ""EWIN?"" no.

""E ? ? I N"" with I in 4, N in 5:
Need letters 2 and 3.
""E D D I N"" → ""EDDIN"" is a word (variant of ""eddying""), but D is repeated.
""E D G I N"" → ""EDGIN"" is not a word.
""E D L I N"" → ""EDLIN"" is not a word.
""E D M I N"" → ""EDMIN"" is not a word.
""E D V I N"" → ""EDVIN"" is not a word.
""E D W I N"" → ""EDWIN"" – this is a valid word!

Check positions:
E(1) D(2) W(3) I(4) N(5)
- E is in 1 – allowed (positions 1 or 3).
- N is in 5 – allowed (positions 1, 4, 5).
- I is in 4 – allowed (positions 1, 2, 3, 5).
- Letters used: E, D, W, I, N – none are eliminated.
This seems valid.

Therefore, the next guess should be ""EDWIN"".From all the feedback so far:
- Eliminated letters: A, R, O, S, B, C, H, U, T
- Must contain: E, N, I
- Position restrictions:
  - E must be in 1 or 3
  - N must be in 1, 4, or 5
  - I must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5

A valid word that satisfies these constraints is ""EDWIN"":
- E in position 1 (allowed)
- D, W are new letters (not yet eliminated)
- I in position 4 (allowed)
- N in position 5 (allowed)

From the latest feedback on EDWIN:

- E is correct in position 1 (✓)
- D is not in the word (x)
- W is not in the word (x)
- I is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- N is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So the secret word looks like: E _ _ _ _

Known letters to place:
- I must appear somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5 (since it can't be in 4 or 2 from earlier feedback)
- N must appear somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4 (can't be 5 or 3 from earlier feedback)

Letters already eliminated: A, R, O, S, B, C, H, U, T, D, W

Remaining letters: F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word starting with E, containing both I and N, with I not in position 4 and N not in position 5.

Possible positions:
- I can be in 2 or 3 (since 5 is possible but let's check)
- N can be in 2, 3, or 4

Let's try to construct valid words:

1. E I _ N _ : but N would be in 4, I in 2 - possible
2. E I _ _ N : but N can't be in 5
3. E _ I N _ : but I in 3, N in 4 - possible
4. E _ _ I N : but N can't be in 5

Looking at valid words:
- EIGHT - but G and H are allowed? H is eliminated
- ELIM_ - but L and I and M - but needs N
- ENIG_ - but N is first, needs I
- EPI_ - but needs N

Let's think systematically:

We have E _ _ _ _
Must include I and N somewhere in positions 2-5 with constraints:
- I not in 4, not in 2 (from BENCH feedback I was in 4 and failed)
Wait re-reading: from UNTIE, I was in 4 and failed, so I can't be in 4
From BENCH, I was in 2 and failed, so I can't be in 2
Thus I must be in 3 or 5

From EDWIN, N was in 5 and failed, so N can't be in 5
From BENCH, N was in 3 and failed, so N can't be in 3
Thus N must be in 2 or 4

So possible structures:
- N in 2, I in 3 or 5
- N in 4, I in 3 or 5

Let's explore:
1. N I _ _ _ : but I would be in 2 (forbidden)
2. N _ I _ _ : I in 3 - possible
3. N _ _ _ I : I in 5 - possible
4. _ N I _ _ : but first letter is E, so E N I _ _ - but N would be in 2, I in 3
5. _ N _ I _ : but first letter is E, so E N _ I _ - but N in 2, I in 4 (forbidden)
6. _ _ N I _ : but first letter is E, so E _ N I _ - but N in 3, I in 4 (forbidden)
7. _ _ _ N I : but N in 4, I in 5 - possible
8. _ _ I N _ : but N in 4, I in 3 - possible

So possible patterns:
- E N I _ _ 
- E N _ I _
- E _ N I _
- E _ _ N I
- E _ I N _
- E I N _ _

But need to check constraints:
- I can't be in 2 or 4
- N can't be in 3 or 5

Let's check each pattern:

1. E N I _ _ : I in 3 - allowed, N in 2 - allowed
   Possible words: ENIGM, ENIMS, ENIST, etc. - but need valid 5-letter words
   ""ENIGM"" - not a word
   ""ENIGMA"" - 6 letters
   ""ENIME"" - not a word
   ""ENISK"" - not a word

2. E N _ I _ : I in 4 - forbidden (from UNTIE)
3. E _ N I _ : N in 3 - forbidden (from BENCH)
4. E _ _ N I : N in 4, I in 5 - allowed
   Possible words: ELVIN, EMNIX, but need to check
   ""ELVIN"" - V is allowed, but does it fit?
   E L V I N - but I is in 4 which is forbidden
   ""EMNIX"" - X is allowed, but I is in 4 - forbidden
   ""EPIN_"" - no
   ""EKIN_"" - no
   ""ELIN_"" - no

5. E _ I N _ : I in 3, N in 4 - allowed
   Possible words: ELI_N, but need valid
   ""ELI_N"" - need a letter
   ""ELIKN"" - not a word
   ""ELIMN"" - not a word
   ""EPIN_"" - no
   ""EQIN_"" - no
   ""EXIN_"" - no
   ""EKIN_"" - no

6. E I N _ _ : I in 2 - forbidden (from BENCH)
7. E _ _ _ I : I in 5 - allowed, N must be in 2 or 4
   - E N _ _ I : N in 2, I in 5 - allowed
     Possible words: ENIGM, ENISK, ENIMB - but need valid
     ""ENISK"" - not a word
     ""ENIMB"" - not a word
   - E _ _ N I : N in 4, I in 5 - allowed
     Possible words: E _ _ N I
     ""ELVIN"" - I in 4 - forbidden
     ""EMNIX"" - I in 4 - forbidden
     ""EXONI"" - X and O - O is eliminated
     ""EVONI"" - O is eliminated
     ""ELNIX"" - X is allowed, but I in 4 - forbidden
     ""EKIN_"" - no

This is getting narrow. Let me think of actual words that start with E, contain I and N with constraints.

Valid 5-letter words starting with E, containing I and N:
- EIN_ _ - but EIN is prefix, need to find
- ELIN_ - but L is allowed
- ENIG_ - but N is first
- EVIN_ - V is allowed

Looking at ""ELIN_"":
E L I N _ - but N is in 4, I in 3 - allowed
Need a 5th letter from remaining: F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z
Possible: ""ELING"" - not a word
""ELINK"" - K is allowed, but is ""ELINK"" a word? Yes, ""elink"" can be a word (variant spelling of ""e-link"")
But let's check constraints:
E(1) L(2) I(3) N(4) K(5)
- I is in 3 - allowed
- N is in 4 - allowed
- Letters used: E, L, I, N, K - none eliminated
This seems valid.

Another option: ""ELIM_"" but needs N
""ELIMN"" - not a word

""EVIN_"":
E V I N _ - need 5th letter
""EVINI"" - not a word
""EVINK"" - not a word

""EXIN_"":
E X I N _ - need 5th letter
""EXING"" - not a word
""EXINK"" - not a word

""EMIN_"":
E M I N _ - need 5th letter
""EMING"" - not a word
""EMINK"" - not a word

""ENIM_"":
E N I M _ - but N is in 2, I in 3 - allowed
""ENIMB"" - not a word
""ENIMY"" - not a word

""ENIG_"":
E N I G _ - but G is allowed
""ENIGM"" - not a word
""ENIGMA"" - 6 letters

""ELVIN"":
E L V I N - but I is in 4 - forbidden

""ELIN"" plus a letter - ""ELINK"" seems the most plausible valid word.

Thus, the next guess is ELINK.

From all the feedback so far, we know:
- The word starts with E (✓ in position 1)
- Must contain I and N somewhere in positions 2-5
- I cannot be in positions 2 or 4
- N cannot be in positions 3 or 5

The only valid placement for I is positions 3 or 5
The only valid placement for N is positions 2 or 4

After systematically checking possible combinations, the word ""ELINK"" fits all constraints:
- E in position 1 (✓)
- L is a new letter from the remaining pool
- I in position 3 (allowed)
- N in position 4 (allowed)
- K is a new letter from the remaining pool

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some popular starting words include:

- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)

Looking at these options, I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels that might appear in many 5-letter words. This should give me good information about which of these common letters are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.
- DOES contain E, but not in the 5th position.

Letters left to consider: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I need a word that:
1. Contains E (but not in the 5th position).
2. Avoids A, R, O, S.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good candidates:
- ""UNTIE"" (U, N, T, I, E) – E is in 4th position.
- ""ELITE"" (but E is in 1st and 4th positions; might be too vowel-heavy).
- ""MELON"" (but contains O, which is eliminated).
- ""BENCH"" (B, E, N, C, H) – E is in 2nd position.

I'll choose ""BENCH"" because it uses B, N, C, H (all new letters) and places E in the 2nd position. This should help determine if any of B, N, C, H are in the word and confirm the position of E.

From the new feedback on BENCH:
- B, C, H are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but not in position 2 (it was in position 2, so now we know it’s not there).
- N is in the word but not in position 3.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, B, C, H.
- DOES contain E and N.
- E is not in position 5 (from AROSE) and not in position 2 (from BENCH), so E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
- N is not in position 3, so N must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Letters left to use: D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I need a word that:
1. Contains both E and N.
2. Avoids A, R, O, S, B, C, H.
3. Places E in 1, 3, or 4.
4. Places N in 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).

Good candidates:
- ""TENET"" (but T is repeated and E is in 2 and 4, but 2 is invalid for E).
- ""UNTIE"" (U, N, T, I, E) – E is in 4, N in 2. This seems valid.
- ""MENUS"" (but S is eliminated).
- ""FLEEN"" (F, L, E, E, N) – E is in 3 and 4, N in 5. This could work.
- ""PENNY"" (but Y is allowed, N is in 2 and 5, E in 3).

I'll choose ""UNTIE"" because it uses U, N, T, I, E – all allowed letters, with E in 4 and N in 2. This should give good info about remaining letters and positions.

Let's summarize everything we know so far.

Letters that are NOT in the word:
A, R, O, S, B, C, H, U, T

Letters that ARE in the word:
- E (must appear at least once)
- N (must appear at least once)
- I (must appear at least once)

Positions ruled out for each letter:
- E cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 5 (from BENCH and UNTIE feedback)
  ⇒ E must be in position 1 or 3.
- N cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from BENCH and UNTIE feedback)
  ⇒ N must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- I cannot be in position 4 (from UNTIE feedback)
  ⇒ I must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains E, N, I (each at least once)
2. Uses only letters not yet eliminated (no A, R, O, S, B, C, H, U, T)
3. Respects the positional restrictions above.

Available letters: D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the required E, N, I.

Let's try to construct a word:
- If E is in position 1, then N can be in 4 or 5, and I can be in 2 or 3.
  Example: E I N D ?  → but needs 5 letters and must use each required letter once.
  Try: E N I ? ?  → but N would be in 2 which is invalid.
  Try: I N E ? ?  → but E must be in 1 or 3, so this is invalid.
  
- If E is in position 3, then:
  N can be in 1, 4, or 5.
  I can be in 1, 2, or 5 (but not 4).

Let's try N in 1, I in 2, E in 3:
N I E ? ?  → need two more letters from available ones (D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z)
Possible endings: N I E D ?  → but needs a valid word.
""NIED "" is not a word. ""NIE D?"" doesn't work.

Try N in 1, I in 5, E in 3:
N ? E ? I  → need letters 2 and 4 from available.
""N D E L I"" → N D E L I is not a word.
""N G E M I"" → no.
""N F E D I"" → no.

Try N in 4, I in 2, E in 3:
? I E N ?  → need letters 1 and 5.
""D I E N ?"" → ""DIEN?"" no.
""F I E N ?"" → ""FIEN?"" no.
""L I E N ?"" → ""LIEN?"" no.
""M I E N ?"" → ""MIEN?"" no.

Try N in 5, I in 2, E in 3:
? I E ? N  → need letters 1 and 4.
""D I E L N"" → ""DIELN"" no.
""F I E L N"" → ""FIELN"" no.
""L I E D N"" → ""LIEDN"" no.
""M I E D N"" → ""MIEDN"" no.

Try N in 5, I in 1, E in 3:
I ? E ? N  → need letters 2 and 4.
""I D E L N"" → ""IDELN"" no.
""I F E D N"" → ""IFEDN"" no.
""I L E D N"" → ""ILEDN"" no.
""I M E D N"" → ""IMEDN"" no.

This is tricky. Maybe we need to use a different arrangement.

Alternative: Use a word where letters are reused but still valid.
But we have no information that letters are reused, so we should assume each of E, N, I appears exactly once.

Let me think of valid 5-letter words that contain E, N, I and avoid all eliminated letters.

Possible words:
- ""FLEIN"" – but not valid.
- ""DINER"" – but R is eliminated.
- ""LINER"" – R is eliminated.
- ""WOKEN"" – but O is eliminated.
- ""JINER"" – R is eliminated.
- ""GIVEN"" – but V is allowed, I is allowed, N is allowed, G is allowed, E is allowed.
  Check positions:
  G(1) I(2) V(3) E(4) N(5)
  - E is in 4 – but E cannot be in 4 (from UNTIE feedback).
  So ""GIVEN"" is invalid.

- ""MINED"":
  M(1) I(2) N(3) E(4) D(5)
  - N is in 3 – but N cannot be in 3 (from UNTIE feedback).
  Invalid.

- ""FINED"":
  F(1) I(2) N(3) E(4) D(5)
  - Same issue, N in 3 is invalid.

- ""WINED"":
  W(1) I(2) N(3) E(4) D(5)
  - N in 3 is invalid.

- ""LINED"":
  L(1) I(2) N(3) E(4) D(5)
  - N in 3 is invalid.

- ""VINED"":
  V(1) I(2) N(3) E(4) D(5)
  - N in 3 is invalid.

- ""KINED"":
  K(1) I(2) N(3) E(4) D(5)
  - N in 3 is invalid.

- ""PINED"":
  P(1) I(2) N(3) E(4) D(5)
  - N in 3 is invalid.

- ""XINED"":
  X(1) I(2) N(3) E(4) D(5)
  - N in 3 is invalid.

- ""YINED"":
  Y(1) I(2) N(3) E(4) D(5)
  - N in 3 is invalid.

- ""ZINED"":
  Z(1) I(2) N(3) E(4) D(5)
  - N in 3 is invalid.

This path is not working. Let's try E in position 1.

E _ _ _ _ with N and I somewhere, avoiding eliminated letters.

Possible:
E N I ? ?  → but N would be in 2 which is invalid (from UNTIE feedback, N cannot be in 2).
E I N ? ?  → N in 3 is invalid.

E _ N I ?  → N in 3 is invalid.

E _ _ N I  → N in 4, I in 5. This is valid for N (4 is allowed) and I (5 is allowed).
Need letters 2 and 3 from available: D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:
""E D N I ?"" → ""EDNI"" is not a prefix.
""E D L I N"" → ""EDLIN"" is not a word.
""E F N I ?"" → ""EFNI"" is not a prefix.
""E L N I ?"" → ""ELNI"" is not a prefix.
""E M N I ?"" → ""EMNI"" is not a prefix.
""E V N I ?"" → ""EVNI"" is not a prefix.
""E W N I ?"" → ""EWNI"" is not a prefix.
""E D N I Y"" → ""EDNIY"" no.
""E D N I K"" → ""EDNIK"" no.

This is also not yielding results. Let me think differently – perhaps the word uses a different set of letters.

Another approach: Use ""E"" in position 1 and ""N"" in 4 or 5, and ""I"" in 2 or 3.

Example:
E I ? N ?
Need letter 3 from available: D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Valid word: ""E I D N ?"" → ""EIDN?"" no.
""E I G N ?"" → ""EIGN?"" no.
""E I L N ?"" → ""EILN?"" no.
""E I M N ?"" → ""EIMN?"" no.
""E I V N ?"" → ""EINV?"" no.
""E I W N ?"" → ""EIWN?"" no.

""E ? I N ?"" with I in 3, N in 4:
Need letter 2 and 5.
""E D I N ?"" → ""EDIN?"" no.
""E F I N ?"" → ""EFIN?"" no.
""E L I N ?"" → ""ELIN?"" no.
""E M I N ?"" → ""EMIN?"" no.
""E V I N ?"" → ""EVIN?"" no.
""E W I N ?"" → ""EWIN?"" no.

""E ? ? I N"" with I in 4, N in 5:
Need letters 2 and 3.
""E D D I N"" → ""EDDIN"" is a word (variant of ""eddying""), but D is repeated.
""E D G I N"" → ""EDGIN"" is not a word.
""E D L I N"" → ""EDLIN"" is not a word.
""E D M I N"" → ""EDMIN"" is not a word.
""E D V I N"" → ""EDVIN"" is not a word.
""E D W I N"" → ""EDWIN"" – this is a valid word!

Check positions:
E(1) D(2) W(3) I(4) N(5)
- E is in 1 – allowed (positions 1 or 3).
- N is in 5 – allowed (positions 1, 4, 5).
- I is in 4 – allowed (positions 1, 2, 3, 5).
- Letters used: E, D, W, I, N – none are eliminated.
This seems valid.

Therefore, the next guess should be ""EDWIN"".From all the feedback so far:
- Eliminated letters: A, R, O, S, B, C, H, U, T
- Must contain: E, N, I
- Position restrictions:
  - E must be in 1 or 3
  - N must be in 1, 4, or 5
  - I must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5

A valid word that satisfies these constraints is ""EDWIN"":
- E in position 1 (allowed)
- D, W are new letters (not yet eliminated)
- I in position 4 (allowed)
- N in position 5 (allowed)

From the latest feedback on EDWIN:

- E is correct in position 1 (✓)
- D is not in the word (x)
- W is not in the word (x)
- I is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- N is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So the secret word looks like: E _ _ _ _

Known letters to place:
- I must appear somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5 (since it can't be in 4 or 2 from earlier feedback)
- N must appear somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4 (can't be 5 or 3 from earlier feedback)

Letters already eliminated: A, R, O, S, B, C, H, U, T, D, W

Remaining letters: F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word starting with E, containing both I and N, with I not in position 4 and N not in position 5.

Possible positions:
- I can be in 2 or 3 (since 5 is possible but let's check)
- N can be in 2, 3, or 4

Let's try to construct valid words:

1. E I _ N _ : but N would be in 4, I in 2 - possible
2. E I _ _ N : but N can't be in 5
3. E _ I N _ : but I in 3, N in 4 - possible
4. E _ _ I N : but N can't be in 5

Looking at valid words:
- EIGHT - but G and H are allowed? H is eliminated
- ELIM_ - but L and I and M - but needs N
- ENIG_ - but N is first, needs I
- EPI_ - but needs N

Let's think systematically:

We have E _ _ _ _
Must include I and N somewhere in positions 2-5 with constraints:
- I not in 4, not in 2 (from BENCH feedback I was in 4 and failed)
Wait re-reading: from UNTIE, I was in 4 and failed, so I can't be in 4
From BENCH, I was in 2 and failed, so I can't be in 2
Thus I must be in 3 or 5

From EDWIN, N was in 5 and failed, so N can't be in 5
From BENCH, N was in 3 and failed, so N can't be in 3
Thus N must be in 2 or 4

So possible structures:
- N in 2, I in 3 or 5
- N in 4, I in 3 or 5

Let's explore:
1. N I _ _ _ : but I would be in 2 (forbidden)
2. N _ I _ _ : I in 3 - possible
3. N _ _ _ I : I in 5 - possible
4. _ N I _ _ : but first letter is E, so E N I _ _ - but N would be in 2, I in 3
5. _ N _ I _ : but first letter is E, so E N _ I _ - but N in 2, I in 4 (forbidden)
6. _ _ N I _ : but first letter is E, so E _ N I _ - but N in 3, I in 4 (forbidden)
7. _ _ _ N I : but N in 4, I in 5 - possible
8. _ _ I N _ : but N in 4, I in 3 - possible

So possible patterns:
- E N I _ _ 
- E N _ I _
- E _ N I _
- E _ _ N I
- E _ I N _
- E I N _ _

But need to check constraints:
- I can't be in 2 or 4
- N can't be in 3 or 5

Let's check each pattern:

1. E N I _ _ : I in 3 - allowed, N in 2 - allowed
   Possible words: ENIGM, ENIMS, ENIST, etc. - but need valid 5-letter words
   ""ENIGM"" - not a word
   ""ENIGMA"" - 6 letters
   ""ENIME"" - not a word
   ""ENISK"" - not a word

2. E N _ I _ : I in 4 - forbidden (from UNTIE)
3. E _ N I _ : N in 3 - forbidden (from BENCH)
4. E _ _ N I : N in 4, I in 5 - allowed
   Possible words: ELVIN, EMNIX, but need to check
   ""ELVIN"" - V is allowed, but does it fit?
   E L V I N - but I is in 4 which is forbidden
   ""EMNIX"" - X is allowed, but I is in 4 - forbidden
   ""EPIN_"" - no
   ""EKIN_"" - no
   ""ELIN_"" - no

5. E _ I N _ : I in 3, N in 4 - allowed
   Possible words: ELI_N, but need valid
   ""ELI_N"" - need a letter
   ""ELIKN"" - not a word
   ""ELIMN"" - not a word
   ""EPIN_"" - no
   ""EQIN_"" - no
   ""EXIN_"" - no
   ""EKIN_"" - no

6. E I N _ _ : I in 2 - forbidden (from BENCH)
7. E _ _ _ I : I in 5 - allowed, N must be in 2 or 4
   - E N _ _ I : N in 2, I in 5 - allowed
     Possible words: ENIGM, ENISK, ENIMB - but need valid
     ""ENISK"" - not a word
     ""ENIMB"" - not a word
   - E _ _ N I : N in 4, I in 5 - allowed
     Possible words: E _ _ N I
     ""ELVIN"" - I in 4 - forbidden
     ""EMNIX"" - I in 4 - forbidden
     ""EXONI"" - X and O - O is eliminated
     ""EVONI"" - O is eliminated
     ""ELNIX"" - X is allowed, but I in 4 - forbidden
     ""EKIN_"" - no

This is getting narrow. Let me think of actual words that start with E, contain I and N with constraints.

Valid 5-letter words starting with E, containing I and N:
- EIN_ _ - but EIN is prefix, need to find
- ELIN_ - but L is allowed
- ENIG_ - but N is first
- EVIN_ - V is allowed

Looking at ""ELIN_"":
E L I N _ - but N is in 4, I in 3 - allowed
Need a 5th letter from remaining: F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z
Possible: ""ELING"" - not a word
""ELINK"" - K is allowed, but is ""ELINK"" a word? Yes, ""elink"" can be a word (variant spelling of ""e-link"")
But let's check constraints:
E(1) L(2) I(3) N(4) K(5)
- I is in 3 - allowed
- N is in 4 - allowed
- Letters used: E, L, I, N, K - none eliminated
This seems valid.

Another option: ""ELIM_"" but needs N
""ELIMN"" - not a word

""EVIN_"":
E V I N _ - need 5th letter
""EVINI"" - not a word
""EVINK"" - not a word

""EXIN_"":
E X I N _ - need 5th letter
""EXING"" - not a word
""EXINK"" - not a word

""EMIN_"":
E M I N _ - need 5th letter
""EMING"" - not a word
""EMINK"" - not a word

""ENIM_"":
E N I M _ - but N is in 2, I in 3 - allowed
""ENIMB"" - not a word
""ENIMY"" - not a word

""ENIG_"":
E N I G _ - but G is allowed
""ENIGM"" - not a word
""ENIGMA"" - 6 letters

""ELVIN"":
E L V I N - but I is in 4 - forbidden

""ELIN"" plus a letter - ""ELINK"" seems the most plausible valid word.

Thus, the next guess is ELINK.From all the feedback so far, we know:
- The word starts with E (✓ in position 1)
- Must contain I and N somewhere in positions 2-5
- I cannot be in positions 2 or 4
- N cannot be in positions 3 or 5

The only valid placement for I is positions 3 or 5
The only valid placement for N is positions 2 or 4

After systematically checking possible combinations, the word ""ELINK"" fits all constraints:
- E in position 1 (✓)
- L is a new letter from the remaining pool
- I in position 3 (allowed)
- N in position 4 (allowed)
- K is a new letter from the remaining pool

From the latest feedback on ELINK:

- E is correct in position 1 (✓)
- L is not in the word (x)
- I is correct in position 3 (✓)
- N is correct in position 4 (✓)
- K is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So the secret word now looks like: E _ I N _

We know K is somewhere in the word but not in the final position. The only remaining slot for K is position 2, because position 5 is still open but K cannot be there.

Therefore, the word must be: E K I N _

Now we just need a valid 5-letter word that starts with E, has K in position 2, I in position 3, N in position 4, and any remaining letter in position 5.

The only common letter that fits and hasn't been eliminated is V. This gives us the word ""EKINV"" – but that's not a valid English word. 

Looking back at the remaining letters (F, G, J, M, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z), the only one that forms a valid word is V, but ""EKINV"" isn't valid. 

Wait, let me reconsider. The structure is E _ I N _, and K must be in the word but not in position 5. The only possible position for K is position 2. 

So the word must be E K I N _, and the fifth letter must be a remaining letter that makes a valid word. The only valid word fitting this pattern is ""EKING"" – but G hasn't been eliminated yet. 

Checking ""EKING"":
- E(1) ✓
- K(2) ✓ (must be here)
- I(3) ✓
- N(4) ✓
- G(5) – G hasn't been eliminated

This is a valid English word and fits all constraints.
