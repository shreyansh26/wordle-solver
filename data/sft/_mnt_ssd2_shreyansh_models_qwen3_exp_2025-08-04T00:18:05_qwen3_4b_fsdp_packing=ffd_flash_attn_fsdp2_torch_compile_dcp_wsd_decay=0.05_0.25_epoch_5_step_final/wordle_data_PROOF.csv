### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several letters at once. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English like A, E, R, S, T, etc. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is a popular starting choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, C, N, Y
- Letters confirmed IN the word and in the correct positions:
  – R is in position 2 (second letter)
  – O is in position 3 (third letter)

Therefore the pattern is: _ R O _ _

We need to fill the first and fourth positions with letters that have not yet been eliminated.  
Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  
Remaining vowels: I, U (since A, E, O are out)

A good third guess should:
1. Keep R and O fixed in positions 2 and 3.
2. Use new letters for positions 1 and 4.
3. Prefer common letters to maximize information.

Let’s try “BROOK”:
- B for position 1
- O is already fixed at position 3
- O for position 4
- K for position 5 (though position 5 isn’t tested here, but we can ignore it since we only need to test position 4)

Wait, let’s pick a word that fills positions 1 and 4 with new letters.  
A better choice is “DROOL”:
- D for position 1
- R fixed at 2
- O fixed at 3
- O for position 4
- L is eliminated, so this is bad.

Next option: “FROGS” – but S is eliminated.  
“FROST” – S and T are eliminated.  
“GROIN” – N is eliminated.  
“PROWL” – L is eliminated.  
“BROTH” – H is okay, T is eliminated.  
“DROWN” – N is eliminated.  
“GROAN” – N is eliminated.  
“FROON” – N is eliminated.  
“BROOD” – D is okay, O is repeated which is fine.

“BROOD” fits: _ R O O D  
Letters used: B, R, O, O, D  
All letters are still possible (B, R, O, D). R and O are confirmed in positions 2 and 3. B and D are new.

So far we know:

- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, C, N, Y, B, D  
- Letters confirmed IN the word and in the correct positions:
  – R is in position 2  
  – O is in position 3  
  – O is also in position 4 (from the feedback on Guess 3: the second O received ✓)

Hence the pattern is: _ R O O _

We still need to determine the first letter.  
Available letters (not yet ruled out): F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z  
Among these, common consonants are F, G, H, K, M, P.

A good next step is to test one of these common consonants in position 1.  
Let’s try “F” first, since it’s a common starting letter.

Word to test: F R O O ?

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with F and has the pattern F R O O _.  
The word “FROND” would fit, but D is already eliminated.  
“FRORE” uses E, which is eliminated.  
“FROON” uses N, eliminated.  
“FROOL” uses L, eliminated.  
“FROST” uses S and T, eliminated.  
“FROZE” uses Z and E, E is eliminated.  
“FROCK” uses C, eliminated.  
“FROGS” uses S and G, S eliminated.  
“FROZE” already noted.

Looking at valid words that fit _ R O O _ and start with F, “FROND” is invalid (D eliminated).  
Next common consonant: G.  
Word: G R O O ?  
“GROIN” – N eliminated.  
“GROCK” – C eliminated.  
“GROPE” – E eliminated.  
“GROVY” – Y eliminated.  
“GROZ” – not a valid word.

Next consonant: H.  
Word: H R O O ?  
“HROOK” – not a valid word.  
“HROWN” – N eliminated.  
“HROSE” – S and E eliminated.  
“HROCK” – not a valid word.

Next consonant: K.  
Word: K R O O ?  
“KROON” – not a valid word.  
“KROXY” – Y eliminated.  
“KROAK” – K R O A K – A eliminated.

Next consonant: M.  
Word: M R O O ?  
“MROON” – not valid.  
“MROCK” – not valid.

Next consonant: P.  
Word: P R O O ?  
“PROMO” – M and O, but O is already in position 4, and M is still available.  
“PROMO” is a valid word.

Let’s check letters used: P, R, O, O, M  
All letters are still possible (P and M have not been eliminated).  
R, O are confirmed in positions 2 and 3, and the second O is confirmed in position 4.  
This will test P in position 1 and M in position 5.

But we only need to determine the first letter, since the pattern is _ R O O _ and we know positions 2-4.  
However, we have to pick a valid 5-letter word.  
Looking at valid words that fit _ R O O _, the most common are:

- FROND (D eliminated)
- FROST (S, T eliminated)
- FROZE (E eliminated)
- GROIN (N eliminated)
- PROWL (L eliminated)
- TROOP (T eliminated)
- WROTE (E, T eliminated)
- YROON (Y eliminated)

Wait, let me think of other possibilities.  
The pattern _ R O O _ is quite restrictive.  
Valid words with this pattern:

- FROND (D eliminated)
- FROST (S, T eliminated)
- FROZE (E eliminated)
- GROIN (N eliminated)
- PROWL (L eliminated)
- TROOP (T eliminated)
- WROTE (E, T eliminated)
- YROON (Y eliminated)

Actually, ""TROOP"" fits _ R O O _ but T is eliminated.  
""FROON"" is invalid (N eliminated).  
""KROON"" is invalid.  
""MROON"" is invalid.  

Looking back, the only remaining common consonants are F, G, H, K, M, P.  
Among these, ""FROON"" is invalid (N), ""FROND"" invalid (D), ""FROST"" invalid (S, T), ""FROZE"" invalid (E), ""GROIN"" invalid (N), ""PROWL"" invalid (L), ""TROOP"" invalid (T), ""WROTE"" invalid (E, T).

This suggests that the valid words fitting _ R O O _ are mostly invalid due to eliminated letters.  
However, ""PROMO"" is a valid word and uses P and M, both still possible.  
Let’s use ""PROMO"".

But wait, let’s check if there are better options.  
Another valid word: ""FROND"" is invalid (D).  
""FROST"" invalid.  
""FROZE"" invalid.  
""GROIN"" invalid.  
""PROWL"" invalid.  
""TROOP"" invalid.  
""WROTE"" invalid.  
""KROON"" invalid.  
""MROON"" invalid.  

Actually, ""PROMO"" seems to be the only valid word left that fits _ R O O _ and uses available letters.  
Let’s go with ""PROMO"".

But let me double-check:  
""PROMO"" uses P (position 1), R (position 2), O (position 3), O (position 4), M (position 5).  
All letters are still possible (P, M have not been eliminated).  
This will confirm/deny P as the first letter and M as the fifth.

However, since positions 2-4 are fixed, we only need to determine positions 1 and 5.  
But ""PROMO"" is the only valid word left that fits _ R O O _ with available letters.

Therefore, the next guess is ""PROMO"".
</think>

Based on the feedback so far:
- The pattern is _ R O O _ (R at position 2, O at positions 3 and 4).
- Letters already eliminated: S, L, A, T, E, C, N, Y, B, D.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several letters at once. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English like A, E, R, S, T, etc. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is a popular starting choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That means the answer contains none of: S, L, A, T, E.  
I need a new starting word that avoids those letters and still covers common consonants and vowels.  
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U.  
Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, H, M, D, G, B, etc.  
A strong second-guess word that avoids the eliminated letters and tests new common letters is “CRONY”:  
C, R, O, N, Y.  
None of these letters appeared in SLATE, so they’re all still possible.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, C, N, Y
- Letters confirmed IN the word and in the correct positions:
  – R is in position 2 (second letter)
  – O is in position 3 (third letter)

Therefore the pattern is: _ R O _ _

We need to fill the first and fourth positions with letters that have not yet been eliminated.  
Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  
Remaining vowels: I, U (since A, E, O are out)

A good third guess should:
1. Keep R and O fixed in positions 2 and 3.
2. Use new letters for positions 1 and 4.
3. Prefer common letters to maximize information.

Let’s try “BROOK”:
- B for position 1
- O is already fixed at position 3
- O for position 4
- K for position 5 (though position 5 isn’t tested here, but we can ignore it since we only need to test position 4)

Wait, let’s pick a word that fills positions 1 and 4 with new letters.  
A better choice is “DROOL”:
- D for position 1
- R fixed at 2
- O fixed at 3
- O for position 4
- L is eliminated, so this is bad.

Next option: “FROGS” – but S is eliminated.  
“FROST” – S and T are eliminated.  
“GROIN” – N is eliminated.  
“PROWL” – L is eliminated.  
“BROTH” – H is okay, T is eliminated.  
“DROWN” – N is eliminated.  
“GROAN” – N is eliminated.  
“FROON” – N is eliminated.  
“BROOD” – D is okay, O is repeated which is fine.

“BROOD” fits: _ R O O D  
Letters used: B, R, O, O, D  
All letters are still possible (B, R, O, D). R and O are confirmed in positions 2 and 3. B and D are new.

  – R is in position 2  
  – O is in position 3  
  – O is also in position 4 (from the feedback on Guess 3: the second O received ✓)

Hence the pattern is: _ R O O _

We still need to determine the first letter.  
Available letters (not yet ruled out): F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z  
Among these, common consonants are F, G, H, K, M, P.

A good next step is to test one of these common consonants in position 1.  
Let’s try “F” first, since it’s a common starting letter.

Word to test: F R O O ?

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with F and has the pattern F R O O _.  
The word “FROND” would fit, but D is already eliminated.  
“FRORE” uses E, which is eliminated.  
“FROON” uses N, eliminated.  
“FROOL” uses L, eliminated.  
“FROST” uses S and T, eliminated.  
“FROZE” uses Z and E, E is eliminated.  
“FROCK” uses C, eliminated.  
“FROGS” uses S and G, S eliminated.  
“FROZE” already noted.

Looking at valid words that fit _ R O O _ and start with F, “FROND” is invalid (D eliminated).  
Next common consonant: G.  
Word: G R O O ?  
“GROIN” – N eliminated.  
“GROCK” – C eliminated.  
“GROPE” – E eliminated.  
“GROVY” – Y eliminated.  
“GROZ” – not a valid word.

Next consonant: H.  
Word: H R O O ?  
“HROOK” – not a valid word.  
“HROWN” – N eliminated.  
“HROSE” – S and E eliminated.  
“HROCK” – not a valid word.

Next consonant: K.  
Word: K R O O ?  
“KROON” – not a valid word.  
“KROXY” – Y eliminated.  
“KROAK” – K R O A K – A eliminated.

Next consonant: M.  
Word: M R O O ?  
“MROON” – not valid.  
“MROCK” – not valid.

Next consonant: P.  
Word: P R O O ?  
“PROMO” – M and O, but O is already in position 4, and M is still available.  
“PROMO” is a valid word.

Let’s check letters used: P, R, O, O, M  
All letters are still possible (P and M have not been eliminated).  
R, O are confirmed in positions 2 and 3, and the second O is confirmed in position 4.  
This will test P in position 1 and M in position 5.

But we only need to determine the first letter, since the pattern is _ R O O _ and we know positions 2-4.  
However, we have to pick a valid 5-letter word.  
Looking at valid words that fit _ R O O _, the most common are:

- FROND (D eliminated)
- FROST (S, T eliminated)
- FROZE (E eliminated)
- GROIN (N eliminated)
- PROWL (L eliminated)
- TROOP (T eliminated)
- WROTE (E, T eliminated)
- YROON (Y eliminated)

Wait, let me think of other possibilities.  
The pattern _ R O O _ is quite restrictive.  
Valid words with this pattern:

- FROND (D eliminated)
- FROST (S, T eliminated)
- FROZE (E eliminated)
- GROIN (N eliminated)
- PROWL (L eliminated)
- TROOP (T eliminated)
- WROTE (E, T eliminated)
- YROON (Y eliminated)

Actually, ""TROOP"" fits _ R O O _ but T is eliminated.  
""FROON"" is invalid (N eliminated).  
""KROON"" is invalid.  
""MROON"" is invalid.  

Looking back, the only remaining common consonants are F, G, H, K, M, P.  
Among these, ""FROON"" is invalid (N), ""FROND"" invalid (D), ""FROST"" invalid (S, T), ""FROZE"" invalid (E), ""GROIN"" invalid (N), ""PROWL"" invalid (L), ""TROOP"" invalid (T), ""WROTE"" invalid (E, T).

This suggests that the valid words fitting _ R O O _ are mostly invalid due to eliminated letters.  
However, ""PROMO"" is a valid word and uses P and M, both still possible.  
Let’s use ""PROMO"".

But wait, let’s check if there are better options.  
Another valid word: ""FROND"" is invalid (D).  
""FROST"" invalid.  
""FROZE"" invalid.  
""GROIN"" invalid.  
""PROWL"" invalid.  
""TROOP"" invalid.  
""WROTE"" invalid.  
""KROON"" invalid.  
""MROON"" invalid.  

Actually, ""PROMO"" seems to be the only valid word left that fits _ R O O _ and uses available letters.  
Let’s go with ""PROMO"".

But let me double-check:  
""PROMO"" uses P (position 1), R (position 2), O (position 3), O (position 4), M (position 5).  
All letters are still possible (P, M have not been eliminated).  
This will confirm/deny P as the first letter and M as the fifth.

However, since positions 2-4 are fixed, we only need to determine positions 1 and 5.  
But ""PROMO"" is the only valid word left that fits _ R O O _ with available letters.

Therefore, the next guess is ""PROMO"".Based on the feedback so far:
- The pattern is _ R O O _ (R at position 2, O at positions 3 and 4).
- Letters already eliminated: S, L, A, T, E, C, N, Y, B, D.

The only remaining common word that fits _ R O O _ and uses still-allowed letters is ""PROMO"". It tests P and M for positions 1 and 5.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several letters at once. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English like A, E, R, S, T, etc. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is a popular starting choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That means the answer contains none of: S, L, A, T, E.  
I need a new starting word that avoids those letters and still covers common consonants and vowels.  
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U.  
Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, H, M, D, G, B, etc.  
A strong second-guess word that avoids the eliminated letters and tests new common letters is “CRONY”:  
C, R, O, N, Y.  
None of these letters appeared in SLATE, so they’re all still possible.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, C, N, Y
- Letters confirmed IN the word and in the correct positions:
  – R is in position 2 (second letter)
  – O is in position 3 (third letter)

Therefore the pattern is: _ R O _ _

We need to fill the first and fourth positions with letters that have not yet been eliminated.  
Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  
Remaining vowels: I, U (since A, E, O are out)

A good third guess should:
1. Keep R and O fixed in positions 2 and 3.
2. Use new letters for positions 1 and 4.
3. Prefer common letters to maximize information.

Let’s try “BROOK”:
- B for position 1
- O is already fixed at position 3
- O for position 4
- K for position 5 (though position 5 isn’t tested here, but we can ignore it since we only need to test position 4)

Wait, let’s pick a word that fills positions 1 and 4 with new letters.  
A better choice is “DROOL”:
- D for position 1
- R fixed at 2
- O fixed at 3
- O for position 4
- L is eliminated, so this is bad.

Next option: “FROGS” – but S is eliminated.  
“FROST” – S and T are eliminated.  
“GROIN” – N is eliminated.  
“PROWL” – L is eliminated.  
“BROTH” – H is okay, T is eliminated.  
“DROWN” – N is eliminated.  
“GROAN” – N is eliminated.  
“FROON” – N is eliminated.  
“BROOD” – D is okay, O is repeated which is fine.

“BROOD” fits: _ R O O D  
Letters used: B, R, O, O, D  
All letters are still possible (B, R, O, D). R and O are confirmed in positions 2 and 3. B and D are new.

So far we know:

- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, C, N, Y, B, D  
- Letters confirmed IN the word and in the correct positions:
  – R is in position 2  
  – O is in position 3  
  – O is also in position 4 (from the feedback on Guess 3: the second O received ✓)

Hence the pattern is: _ R O O _

We still need to determine the first letter.  
Available letters (not yet ruled out): F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z  
Among these, common consonants are F, G, H, K, M, P.

A good next step is to test one of these common consonants in position 1.  
Let’s try “F” first, since it’s a common starting letter.

Word to test: F R O O ?

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with F and has the pattern F R O O _.  
The word “FROND” would fit, but D is already eliminated.  
“FRORE” uses E, which is eliminated.  
“FROON” uses N, eliminated.  
“FROOL” uses L, eliminated.  
“FROST” uses S and T, eliminated.  
“FROZE” uses Z and E, E is eliminated.  
“FROCK” uses C, eliminated.  
“FROGS” uses S and G, S eliminated.  
“FROZE” already noted.

Looking at valid words that fit _ R O O _ and start with F, “FROND” is invalid (D eliminated).  
Next common consonant: G.  
Word: G R O O ?  
“GROIN” – N eliminated.  
“GROCK” – C eliminated.  
“GROPE” – E eliminated.  
“GROVY” – Y eliminated.  
“GROZ” – not a valid word.

Next consonant: H.  
Word: H R O O ?  
“HROOK” – not a valid word.  
“HROWN” – N eliminated.  
“HROSE” – S and E eliminated.  
“HROCK” – not a valid word.

Next consonant: K.  
Word: K R O O ?  
“KROON” – not a valid word.  
“KROXY” – Y eliminated.  
“KROAK” – K R O A K – A eliminated.

Next consonant: M.  
Word: M R O O ?  
“MROON” – not valid.  
“MROCK” – not valid.

Next consonant: P.  
Word: P R O O ?  
“PROMO” – M and O, but O is already in position 4, and M is still available.  
“PROMO” is a valid word.

Let’s check letters used: P, R, O, O, M  
All letters are still possible (P and M have not been eliminated).  
R, O are confirmed in positions 2 and 3, and the second O is confirmed in position 4.  
This will test P in position 1 and M in position 5.

But we only need to determine the first letter, since the pattern is _ R O O _ and we know positions 2-4.  
However, we have to pick a valid 5-letter word.  
Looking at valid words that fit _ R O O _, the most common are:

- FROND (D eliminated)
- FROST (S, T eliminated)
- FROZE (E eliminated)
- GROIN (N eliminated)
- PROWL (L eliminated)
- TROOP (T eliminated)
- WROTE (E, T eliminated)
- YROON (Y eliminated)

Wait, let me think of other possibilities.  
The pattern _ R O O _ is quite restrictive.  
Valid words with this pattern:

- FROND (D eliminated)
- FROST (S, T eliminated)
- FROZE (E eliminated)
- GROIN (N eliminated)
- PROWL (L eliminated)
- TROOP (T eliminated)
- WROTE (E, T eliminated)
- YROON (Y eliminated)

Actually, ""TROOP"" fits _ R O O _ but T is eliminated.  
""FROON"" is invalid (N eliminated).  
""KROON"" is invalid.  
""MROON"" is invalid.  

Looking back, the only remaining common consonants are F, G, H, K, M, P.  
Among these, ""FROON"" is invalid (N), ""FROND"" invalid (D), ""FROST"" invalid (S, T), ""FROZE"" invalid (E), ""GROIN"" invalid (N), ""PROWL"" invalid (L), ""TROOP"" invalid (T), ""WROTE"" invalid (E, T).

This suggests that the valid words fitting _ R O O _ are mostly invalid due to eliminated letters.  
However, ""PROMO"" is a valid word and uses P and M, both still possible.  
Let’s use ""PROMO"".

But wait, let’s check if there are better options.  
Another valid word: ""FROND"" is invalid (D).  
""FROST"" invalid.  
""FROZE"" invalid.  
""GROIN"" invalid.  
""PROWL"" invalid.  
""TROOP"" invalid.  
""WROTE"" invalid.  
""KROON"" invalid.  
""MROON"" invalid.  

Actually, ""PROMO"" seems to be the only valid word left that fits _ R O O _ and uses available letters.  
Let’s go with ""PROMO"".

But let me double-check:  
""PROMO"" uses P (position 1), R (position 2), O (position 3), O (position 4), M (position 5).  
All letters are still possible (P, M have not been eliminated).  
This will confirm/deny P as the first letter and M as the fifth.

However, since positions 2-4 are fixed, we only need to determine positions 1 and 5.  
But ""PROMO"" is the only valid word left that fits _ R O O _ with available letters.

Therefore, the next guess is ""PROMO"".Based on the feedback so far:
- The pattern is _ R O O _ (R at position 2, O at positions 3 and 4).
- Letters already eliminated: S, L, A, T, E, C, N, Y, B, D.

The only remaining common word that fits _ R O O _ and uses still-allowed letters is ""PROMO"". It tests P and M for positions 1 and 5.

From the feedback so far we know:

- The word starts with P R O and ends with O: P R O _ O
- Position 4 is the unknown letter.
- Letters already eliminated for position 4: V, M, S, L, A, T, E, C, N, Y, B, D  
- Still-allowed letters for position 4: F, G, H, I, J, K, Q, U, W, X, Z

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form P R O ? O.  
Checking the dictionary:

- PROFO – not a word

- PROPO – not a word  
- PROSO – not a word  
- PROTO – valid word (“proto”)  
- PROVO – already tried (V eliminated)  
- PRXTO – invalid  

The only valid remaining word is “PROTO”.  
It uses T in position 4, and T has not been eliminated (it was only position 5 in earlier guesses, but position 4 is new).  

Therefore, “PROTO” is the next logical guess.
