1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses several of these common letters in different positions. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no letter is repeated, which helps identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x) → R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in position 1.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

I now need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has A somewhere other than first.
- Avoids R, O, S, E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, Y, etc.

I’ll try a word that uses A in a different position and incorporates other frequent letters.  
“TAINT” uses T, A, I, N but repeats A.  
“PAINT” uses P, A, I, N, T – no repeats and keeps A in 2nd position.  
“PLANT” is similar.  
“CANTO” contains O (invalid).  
“LADY” is too short.  
“DAUNT” uses D, A, U, N, T – all new letters except A.

“DAUNT” looks good:  
- A is in position 2 (different from first guess).  
- Uses D, U, N, T – all new letters.  
- Avoids R, O, S, E.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses several of these common letters in different positions. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no letter is repeated, which helps identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x) → R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in position 1.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

I now need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has A somewhere other than first.
- Avoids R, O, S, E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, Y, etc.

I’ll try a word that uses A in a different position and incorporates other frequent letters.  
“TAINT” uses T, A, I, N but repeats A.  
“PAINT” uses P, A, I, N, T – no repeats and keeps A in 2nd position.  
“PLANT” is similar.  
“CANTO” contains O (invalid).  
“LADY” is too short.  
“DAUNT” uses D, A, U, N, T – all new letters except A.

“DAUNT” looks good:  
- A is in position 2 (different from first guess).  
- Uses D, U, N, T – all new letters.  
- Avoids R, O, S, E.

Guess 2: daunt -> FEEDBACK: D(x) A(✓) U(x) N(✓) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Current constraints:
- Word must contain A in position 2 (A(✓) in daunt).
- Word must contain N in position 4 (N(✓) in daunt).
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, D, U, T.

So the pattern is: _ A _ N _  
Available letters (excluding banned ones): B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I need a word that fits _ A _ N _ using only these allowed letters.  
Possible candidates:  
- BANAL (but L is allowed, but A repeats)  
- CANON (O is banned)  
- FANNY (Y is allowed)  
- HANNY (Y is allowed)  
- LANNY (Y is allowed)  
- MANNY (Y is allowed)  
- PANNY (Y is allowed)  
- VANNY (Y is allowed)  
- WANNY (Y is allowed)  

""CANAL"" is invalid because it has A twice.  
""BAKED"" has banned letters.  
""PAINT"" has banned T.  
""FANNY"" fits: F A N N Y – but N repeats.  
""HANNY"" – same issue.  
""MANLY"" – Y is allowed, M, A, N, L, Y. This fits perfectly: M A N L Y.  

Let me check:  
- M, A, N, L, Y – none are banned.  
- Pattern: _ A _ N _ – MANLY is M A N L Y, which fits.  

So ""MANLY"" is a valid next guess.

“LADY” is too short.  
“DAUNT” uses D, A, U, N, T – all new letters except A.

“DAUNT” looks good:  
- A is in position 2 (different from first guess).  
- Uses D, U, N, T – all new letters.  
- Avoids R, O, S, E.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: daunt -> FEEDBACK: D(x) A(✓) U(x) N(✓) T(x)

Current constraints:
- Word must contain A in position 2 (A(✓) in daunt).
- Word must contain N in position 4 (N(✓) in daunt).
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, D, U, T.

So the pattern is: _ A _ N _  
Available letters (excluding banned ones): B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I need a word that fits _ A _ N _ using only these allowed letters.  
Possible candidates:  
- BANAL (but L is allowed, but A repeats)  
- CANON (O is banned)  
- FANNY (Y is allowed)  
- HANNY (Y is allowed)  
- LANNY (Y is allowed)  
- MANNY (Y is allowed)  
- PANNY (Y is allowed)  
- VANNY (Y is allowed)  
- WANNY (Y is allowed)  

""CANAL"" is invalid because it has A twice.  
""BAKED"" has banned letters.  
""PAINT"" has banned T.  
""FANNY"" fits: F A N N Y – but N repeats.  
""HANNY"" – same issue.  
""MANLY"" – Y is allowed, M, A, N, L, Y. This fits perfectly: M A N L Y.  

Let me check:  
- M, A, N, L, Y – none are banned.  
- Pattern: _ A _ N _ – MANLY is M A N L Y, which fits.  

So ""MANLY"" is a valid next guess.

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ A N _ Y  (A in 2, N in 3, Y in 5)
- Letters NOT in the word: M, L, R, O, S, E, D, U, T
- Letters still allowed: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word that starts with one of the allowed consonants, has A in position 2, N in position 3, ends with Y in position 5, and has a valid letter in position 4 from the allowed set.

Possible letters for position 4: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

Looking for valid words:
- BANBY – invalid (B twice)
- BANFY – invalid (F not sure)
- CANNY – invalid (N repeats)
- FANGY – invalid
- HANFY – invalid
- KANPY – invalid
- PANKY – invalid
- VANITY – too long
- WANKY – valid word meaning ""silly or foolish""
- BANGY – invalid
- CANGY – invalid
- FANGY – invalid
- HANGY – invalid
- JANGY – invalid
- KANGY – invalid
- PANGY – invalid
- YANGY – invalid

Valid word found: WANKY
- W, A, N, K, Y – all allowed letters
- Fits pattern: _ A N _ Y

Current pattern: _ A N _ Y  
Letters already ruled out:  
- Positions: W (1), K (4) are wrong in their spots.  
- Letters not in the word at all: R, O, S, E, D, U, T, M, L, W, K  

So the first letter must be from the remaining pool and cannot be any of those banned letters.  
Allowed letters so far: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, P, Q, V, X, Z (and Y is already fixed at position 5).

We need a 5-letter word that looks like [B,C,F,G,H,I,J,P,Q,V,X,Z] A N [allowed letter] Y.

Possible valid words:
- BAN A N _ Y → BAN A N is start of BANAL, but we need 5 letters.  
  BAN A N A Y – invalid (already banned letters).  
- CAN A N _ Y → CAN A N is start of CANAL, but again letters repeat or banned.  
- FAN A N _ Y → FANGY – but G is allowed, and FANGY is a valid word.  
- HANGY – invalid.  
- PANKY – invalid (K banned).  
- VANGY – invalid.  
- FANGY: F, A, N, G, Y – all allowed letters and fits pattern.

So the next logical guess is FANGY.
