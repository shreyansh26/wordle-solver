### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). 

One such word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives me a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all (x)

So the word starts with S and contains none of L, A, T, E.

Current known facts:
1. Word starts with S (position 1 confirmed ✓).
2. Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, H, O, N.
3. Letter R is in the word but NOT in position 4 (R appeared as “-” in position 4, so R exists elsewhere).

Remaining unused common letters (avoiding the excluded ones):
Vowels left: I, U, Y (Y can act as vowel)
Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, S (already used), R (must appear once)

Structure so far: S _ _ _ _
We know R must appear somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5.

A good next guess should:
- Keep S in position 1.
- Include R in one of the remaining positions.
- Use new letters for the other slots to maximize information.

Possible candidates:
- SCRUB: S, C, R, U, B → uses R in position 3, tests C, U, B.
- SPRIG: S, P, R, I, G → uses R in position 3, tests P, I, G.
- SKIRM: S, K, I, R, M → uses R in position 4 (but R can’t be in 4 from feedback), so invalid.
- SQUIR: S, Q, U, I, R → uses R in position 5, tests Q, U, I.

From all feedback so far:

1. S is fixed in position 1.
2. R is fixed in position 3.
3. U is in the word but not in position 4 (it appeared as ✓ in SCRUB, so it must be in position 2 or 5).
4. Letters definitely NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, H, O, N, C, B.

Current known structure:
S _ R _ _  (with U somewhere in the remaining two slots)

Possible positions for U:
- Position 2: S U R _ _
- Position 5: S _ R _ U

Remaining unused common letters (excluding everything ruled out):
Vowels: I, Y (Y can act as vowel)
Consonants: D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need two more letters for the remaining two slots. Let's choose common remaining consonants to test.

Option 1: SU_ _ _
   - S U R _ _ : need two consonants. Common choices: S U R F ?  (but we need 5 letters)
   - SU R F I: SURFI isn't a word
   - SU R G Y: SURGY isn't a word
   - SU R F I: not valid
   - SU R F A: A is out

Option 2: S _ R _ U
   - S _ R _ U: need two consonants for position 2 and 4
   - S P R I U: SPRUI isn't a word
   - S G R I U: GRUI isn't a word
   - S F R I U: FRUI isn't a word
   - S D R I U: DRUI isn't a word
   - S K R I U: SKRUI isn't a word
   - S M R I U: SMRUI isn't a word

Wait, let's think of valid 5-letter words that fit:
- SURGE: S U R G E - but E is out
- SUGAR: S U G A R - A is out
- SURIK: S U R I K - I and K are possible
- SURFI: not a word
- SQUIR: S Q U I R - Q and I are possible
- SPROU: S P R O U - O is out
- SFRUI: not a word

Looking at valid words:
- SQUIR is 5 letters but Q is uncommon
- SUGAR has A
- SURIK seems valid but K is less common
- SPROU has O
- SFRUI isn't valid

Another approach: since U must be in position 2 or 5, and we have to use valid words, let's list possible words:
- SURGE: E is out
- SUGAR: A is out
- SULKY: L is out
- SUMPY: M and P are possible
- SUNKY: N is out
- SULKY: L is out
- SUCKY: C is out
- SUGGY: G and Y are possible
- SUDLY: D and L are possible but L is out
- SUDOR: O is out
- SUDSY: D and S are possible but S is already used

Looking at this, SUGGY and SUMPY seem possible:
- SUGGY: S U G G Y - uses G and Y
- SUMPY: S U M P Y - uses M and P

But we need to test new letters. Between G and M/P, let's choose SUGGY as it uses G and Y which haven't been tested yet.

However, let's verify SUGGY is a valid word - yes, it's slang for ""sugary"".

But to be safer with common letters, let's choose SUMPY (S U M P Y) as it tests M and P which are common.

But looking at valid 5-letter words:
- SUMPY is valid
- SUGGY is valid
- SQUID: Q, U, I, D - but D is possible
- SQUID has I which we haven't tested

Given U must be in position 2 or 5, and we need to test new consonants, let's choose SQUID:
- S Q U I D: positions S(1) Q(2) U(3) I(4) D(5)
But R must be in position 3, so this doesn't fit.

Wait, structure is S _ R _ _ with U in position 2 or 5.

So possible words:
- S U R _ _: need two consonants for positions 4 and 5
- S _ R _ U: need two consonants for positions 2 and 4

Looking at valid words:
- S U R G Y: SURGY isn't a word
- S U R F I: SURFI isn't a word
- S U R F Y: SURFY isn't a word
- S U R G E: SURGE has E which is out
- S U R G Y: not valid
- S P R I U: SPRUI isn't a word
- S P R U Y: SPRUY isn't a word
- S K R U T: SKRUT isn't a word
- S M R U T: SMRUT isn't a word
- S F R U D: SF Rud isn't a word

This is tricky. Let's think of actual valid 5-letter words fitting S _ R _ _ or S _ R _ U with remaining letters.

Valid words:
- S U R G E: E is out
- S U R G Y: not valid
- S U R F I: not valid
- S U R F Y: not valid
- S U R G E: E is out
- S P R I U: not valid
- S P R U D: not valid
- S K R U T: not valid
- S M R U T: not valid
- S F R U D: not valid

Actually, ""SURGE"" is invalid due to E, and others seem non-existent. Let's try ""SUGAR"" but A is out.

Wait, let's list all possible combinations:
- Position 1: S
- Position 3: R
- U must be in position 2 or 5
- Positions 2,4,5 (if U is in 2) or positions 2,4,5 (if U is in 5)

Possible valid words:
- S U R G Y: not valid
- S U R F I: not valid
- S U R G E: E is out
- S U R F Y: not valid
- S P R I U: not valid
- S P R U D: not valid
- S K R U T: not valid
- S M R U T: not valid
- S F R U D: not valid

This is harder than expected. Let's think of actual valid 5-letter words with S _ R _ _ or S _ R _ U:

Valid words:
- S U R G E: E is out
- S U R G Y: not valid
- S U R F I: not valid
- S U R F Y: not valid
- S P R I U: not valid
- S P R U D: not valid
- S K R U T: not valid
- S M R U T: not valid
- S F R U D: not valid

Actually, ""SURGE"" is the closest but E is out. Next, ""SUGAR"" has A. 

Another approach: ""SQUIR"" is 5 letters but Q is uncommon and we haven't tested it.

But let's verify ""SQUIR"":
- S Q U I R: positions S(1) Q(2) U(3) I(4) R(5)
But R must be in position 3, so this doesn't fit.

Given the constraints, the most plausible valid word seems to be ""SUGAR"" but A is out. 

Looking back, we missed ""SUGGY"" which is valid but uses Y twice. 

Valid words:
- SUGGY: S U G G Y - uses G and Y
- SUMPY: S U M P Y - uses M and P
- SUDLY: D and L but L is out
- SULKY: L is out
- SULKY: L is out
- SUNKY: N is out
- SUMPY: valid
- SUGGY: valid

Between these, ""SUGGY"" seems better as G and Y haven't been tested.

But let's check if ""SUGGY"" is a valid word - yes, it's slang for ""sugary"".

However, to be more common, let's choose ""SUMPY"" which uses M and P.

But ""SUMPY"" is valid.

After careful consideration, ""SUGGY"" seems the best next guess as it tests G and Y in the remaining positions.

But let's re-express the structure:
- S _ R _ _ with U in position 2 or 5
- S U R _ _: need two consonants for positions 4 and 5
   - S U R G Y: not valid
   - S U R F I: not valid
   - S U R G E: E is out
   - S U R F Y: not valid
- S _ R _ U: need two consonants for positions 2 and 4
   - S P R I U: not valid
   - S P R U D: not valid
   - S K R U T: not valid
   - S M R U T: not valid
   - S F R U D: not valid

This is extremely restrictive. Let's think of actual valid words:
- ""SURGE"" is invalid (E)
- ""SUGAR"" is invalid (A)
- ""SUGOI"" is not a word
- ""SUKRI"" is not a word
- ""SULFI"" is not a word
- ""SUNKI"" is not a word
- ""SUNRI"" is not a word
- ""SURGI"" is not a word

Actually, ""SUGAR"" is invalid, but ""SUGA"" is 4 letters. 

Realizing this, the only valid word fitting seems to be ""SUGAR"" but A is out. 

Next possible valid word is ""SUGGY"" which is valid despite being slang.

Thus, the best next guess is ""SUGGY"" as it fits the constraints and uses new letters.

But let's verify:
- S(1) U(2) R(3) G(4) G(5)
- U is in position 2 (✓)
- R is in position 3 (✓)
- G and G are new letters (✓)
- No excluded letters (L,A,T,E,H,O,N,C,B)

This seems valid.

Therefore, the next guess is ""SUGGY"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). 

One such word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives me a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 (✓)
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all (x)

So the word starts with S and contains none of L, A, T, E.  
I now need a 5-letter word beginning with S that avoids those letters.  
Good remaining consonants to test include R, N, C, H, M, P, etc., and remaining vowels are I, O, U.

A balanced next guess would be “SHORN”:
- S stays in place.
- H, O, R, N are all new letters that haven’t been ruled out yet.
- It tests two additional vowels (O, H isn’t a vowel, R and N are consonants) but gives good coverage.

Current known facts:
1. Word starts with S (position 1 confirmed ✓).
2. Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, H, O, N.
3. Letter R is in the word but NOT in position 4 (R appeared as “-” in position 4, so R exists elsewhere).

Remaining unused common letters (avoiding the excluded ones):
Vowels left: I, U, Y (Y can act as vowel)
Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, S (already used), R (must appear once)

Structure so far: S _ _ _ _
We know R must appear somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5.

A good next guess should:
- Keep S in position 1.
- Include R in one of the remaining positions.
- Use new letters for the other slots to maximize information.

Possible candidates:
- SCRUB: S, C, R, U, B → uses R in position 3, tests C, U, B.
- SPRIG: S, P, R, I, G → uses R in position 3, tests P, I, G.
- SKIRM: S, K, I, R, M → uses R in position 4 (but R can’t be in 4 from feedback), so invalid.
- SQUIR: S, Q, U, I, R → uses R in position 5, tests Q, U, I.

Among these, “SCRUB” seems strong as it tests common consonants (C, B) and the vowel U, while placing R in position 3 (a new spot).

Option 1: SU_ _ _
   - S U R _ _ : need two consonants. Common choices: S U R F ?  (but we need 5 letters)
   - SU R F I: SURFI isn't a word
   - SU R G Y: SURGY isn't a word
   - SU R F I: not valid
   - SU R F A: A is out

Option 2: S _ R _ U
   - S _ R _ U: need two consonants for position 2 and 4
   - S P R I U: SPRUI isn't a word
   - S G R I U: GRUI isn't a word
   - S F R I U: FRUI isn't a word
   - S D R I U: DRUI isn't a word
   - S K R I U: SKRUI isn't a word
   - S M R I U: SMRUI isn't a word

Wait, let's think of valid 5-letter words that fit:
- SURGE: S U R G E - but E is out
- SUGAR: S U G A R - A is out
- SURIK: S U R I K - I and K are possible
- SURFI: not a word
- SQUIR: S Q U I R - Q and I are possible
- SPROU: S P R O U - O is out
- SFRUI: not a word

Looking at valid words:
- SQUIR is 5 letters but Q is uncommon
- SUGAR has A
- SURIK seems valid but K is less common
- SPROU has O
- SFRUI isn't valid

Another approach: since U must be in position 2 or 5, and we have to use valid words, let's list possible words:
- SURGE: E is out
- SUGAR: A is out
- SULKY: L is out
- SUMPY: M and P are possible
- SUNKY: N is out
- SULKY: L is out
- SUCKY: C is out
- SUGGY: G and Y are possible
- SUDLY: D and L are possible but L is out
- SUDOR: O is out
- SUDSY: D and S are possible but S is already used

Looking at this, SUGGY and SUMPY seem possible:
- SUGGY: S U G G Y - uses G and Y
- SUMPY: S U M P Y - uses M and P

But we need to test new letters. Between G and M/P, let's choose SUGGY as it uses G and Y which haven't been tested yet.

However, let's verify SUGGY is a valid word - yes, it's slang for ""sugary"".

But to be safer with common letters, let's choose SUMPY (S U M P Y) as it tests M and P which are common.

But looking at valid 5-letter words:
- SUMPY is valid
- SUGGY is valid
- SQUID: Q, U, I, D - but D is possible
- SQUID has I which we haven't tested

Given U must be in position 2 or 5, and we need to test new consonants, let's choose SQUID:
- S Q U I D: positions S(1) Q(2) U(3) I(4) D(5)
But R must be in position 3, so this doesn't fit.

Wait, structure is S _ R _ _ with U in position 2 or 5.

So possible words:
- S U R _ _: need two consonants for positions 4 and 5
- S _ R _ U: need two consonants for positions 2 and 4

Looking at valid words:
- S U R G Y: SURGY isn't a word
- S U R F I: SURFI isn't a word
- S U R F Y: SURFY isn't a word
- S U R G E: SURGE has E which is out
- S U R G Y: not valid
- S P R I U: SPRUI isn't a word
- S P R U Y: SPRUY isn't a word
- S K R U T: SKRUT isn't a word
- S M R U T: SMRUT isn't a word
- S F R U D: SF Rud isn't a word

This is tricky. Let's think of actual valid 5-letter words fitting S _ R _ _ or S _ R _ U with remaining letters.

Valid words:
- S U R G E: E is out
- S U R G Y: not valid
- S U R F I: not valid
- S U R F Y: not valid
- S U R G E: E is out
- S P R I U: not valid
- S P R U D: not valid
- S K R U T: not valid
- S M R U T: not valid
- S F R U D: not valid

Actually, ""SURGE"" is invalid due to E, and others seem non-existent. Let's try ""SUGAR"" but A is out.

Wait, let's list all possible combinations:
- Position 1: S
- Position 3: R
- U must be in position 2 or 5
- Positions 2,4,5 (if U is in 2) or positions 2,4,5 (if U is in 5)

Possible valid words:
- S U R G Y: not valid
- S U R F I: not valid
- S U R G E: E is out
- S U R F Y: not valid
- S P R I U: not valid
- S P R U D: not valid
- S K R U T: not valid
- S M R U T: not valid
- S F R U D: not valid

This is harder than expected. Let's think of actual valid 5-letter words with S _ R _ _ or S _ R _ U:

Valid words:
- S U R G E: E is out
- S U R G Y: not valid
- S U R F I: not valid
- S U R F Y: not valid
- S P R I U: not valid
- S P R U D: not valid
- S K R U T: not valid
- S M R U T: not valid
- S F R U D: not valid

Actually, ""SURGE"" is the closest but E is out. Next, ""SUGAR"" has A. 

Another approach: ""SQUIR"" is 5 letters but Q is uncommon and we haven't tested it.

But let's verify ""SQUIR"":
- S Q U I R: positions S(1) Q(2) U(3) I(4) R(5)
But R must be in position 3, so this doesn't fit.

Given the constraints, the most plausible valid word seems to be ""SUGAR"" but A is out. 

Looking back, we missed ""SUGGY"" which is valid but uses Y twice. 

Valid words:
- SUGGY: S U G G Y - uses G and Y
- SUMPY: S U M P Y - uses M and P
- SUDLY: D and L but L is out
- SULKY: L is out
- SULKY: L is out
- SUNKY: N is out
- SUMPY: valid
- SUGGY: valid

Between these, ""SUGGY"" seems better as G and Y haven't been tested.

But let's check if ""SUGGY"" is a valid word - yes, it's slang for ""sugary"".

However, to be more common, let's choose ""SUMPY"" which uses M and P.

But ""SUMPY"" is valid.

After careful consideration, ""SUGGY"" seems the best next guess as it tests G and Y in the remaining positions.

But let's re-express the structure:
- S _ R _ _ with U in position 2 or 5
- S U R _ _: need two consonants for positions 4 and 5
   - S U R G Y: not valid
   - S U R F I: not valid
   - S U R G E: E is out
   - S U R F Y: not valid
- S _ R _ U: need two consonants for positions 2 and 4
   - S P R I U: not valid
   - S P R U D: not valid
   - S K R U T: not valid
   - S M R U T: not valid
   - S F R U D: not valid

This is extremely restrictive. Let's think of actual valid words:
- ""SURGE"" is invalid (E)
- ""SUGAR"" is invalid (A)
- ""SUGOI"" is not a word
- ""SUKRI"" is not a word
- ""SULFI"" is not a word
- ""SUNKI"" is not a word
- ""SUNRI"" is not a word
- ""SURGI"" is not a word

Actually, ""SUGAR"" is invalid, but ""SUGA"" is 4 letters. 

Realizing this, the only valid word fitting seems to be ""SUGAR"" but A is out. 

Next possible valid word is ""SUGGY"" which is valid despite being slang.

Thus, the best next guess is ""SUGGY"" as it fits the constraints and uses new letters.

But let's verify:
- S(1) U(2) R(3) G(4) G(5)
- U is in position 2 (✓)
- R is in position 3 (✓)
- G and G are new letters (✓)
- No excluded letters (L,A,T,E,H,O,N,C,B)

This seems valid.

Therefore, the next guess is ""SUGGY"".

From the new feedback on SUGGY:

- S(✓) – still correct in position 1.
- U(-) – the letter U is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- G(x), G(x) – neither G appears anywhere else in the word.
- Y(-) – the letter Y is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So far we know:

1. S _ _ _ _
2. R is in position 3 (from SCRUB feedback).
3. U is in the word but not in position 2 or 4 (from SCRUB and SUGGY).
4. Y is in the word but not in position 5.
5. Letters definitely absent: L, A, T, E, H, O, N, C, B, G.

The structure is therefore:
S _ R _ _
with U and Y both present somewhere in positions 2, 4, or 5, but:
- U cannot be in 2 or 4 ⇒ U must be in 5.
- Y cannot be in 5 ⇒ Y must be in 2 or 4.

Also, every other letter must come from the still-untested set: D, F, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We now have two cases:

Case 1: Y in position 2 ⇒ S Y R _ U
Case 2: Y in position 4 ⇒ S _ R Y U

We need a valid 5-letter word for each case using only allowed letters.

Case 1: S Y R _ U
   – Possible consonants left: D, F, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z
   – Looking for a single letter to fill position 4 that makes a valid word.
   – SYRDU, SYRFU, SYRKU, SYRMU, SYRPU, etc. – none of these are valid English words.

Case 2: S _ R Y U
   – Fill position 2 with any unused consonant that makes a valid word.
   – S D R Y U – not valid
   – S F R Y U – not valid
   – S K R Y U – not valid
   – S M R Y U – not valid
   – S P R Y U – not valid
   – S V R Y U – not valid
   – S W R Y U – not valid
   – S Z R Y U – not valid
   – S Q R Y U – not valid
   – S J R Y U – not valid
   – S X R Y U – not valid

None of these combinations form valid English words. This implies we must have missed a possible placement of U or Y.

Re-examining the constraints:

- From SCRUB: U is in the word but not in position 4 (it was marked ✓, so it must be in the word, but the ✓ means it is in the correct position? Wait, let’s re-read the feedback carefully.

Re-reading SCRUB feedback:
SCRUB -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(x) R(✓) U(✓) B(x)
This means:
- S is correct in position 1.
- R is correct in position 3.
- U is correct in position 4.

So the actual word is S _ R U _ (with U fixed in position 4), not S _ R _ _ with U somewhere.

This is a critical correction. The structure is:
S _ R U _

From SUGGY feedback:
S U G G Y
- S(✓) – correct in position 1.
- U(-) – U is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- G(x), G(x) – no G elsewhere.
- Y(-) – Y is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the word is S _ R U _ (from SCRUB) and must also contain Y somewhere, but Y cannot be in position 5 (from SUGGY). The only remaining position for Y is position 2.

Thus the word must be S Y R U _, and the last letter must be a letter we haven’t ruled out yet.

Letters still allowed: D, F, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form SYRUD, SYRUF, SYRUK, SYRUM, SYRUP, etc.

The only common valid word is SYRUP.

Checking constraints:
- S(1) Y(2) R(3) U(4) P(5)
- S is correct in 1 (✓)
- R is correct in 3 (✓)
- U is correct in 4 (✓)
- Y is in 2 (allowed, since Y is allowed in 2 and not ruled out)
- P is new and allowed
- No excluded letters appear.

Therefore, the next guess is SYRUP.

- U(-) – the letter U is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- G(x), G(x) – neither G appears anywhere else in the word.
- Y(-) – the letter Y is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So far we know:

1. S _ _ _ _
2. R is in position 3 (from SCRUB feedback).
3. U is in the word but not in position 2 or 4 (from SCRUB and SUGGY).
4. Y is in the word but not in position 5.
5. Letters definitely absent: L, A, T, E, H, O, N, C, B, G.

The structure is therefore:
S _ R _ _
with U and Y both present somewhere in positions 2, 4, or 5, but:
- U cannot be in 2 or 4 ⇒ U must be in 5.
- Y cannot be in 5 ⇒ Y must be in 2 or 4.

Also, every other letter must come from the still-untested set: D, F, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We now have two cases:

Case 1: Y in position 2 ⇒ S Y R _ U
Case 2: Y in position 4 ⇒ S _ R Y U

We need a valid 5-letter word for each case using only allowed letters.

Case 1: S Y R _ U
   – Possible consonants left: D, F, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z
   – Looking for a single letter to fill position 4 that makes a valid word.
   – SYRDU, SYRFU, SYRKU, SYRMU, SYRPU, etc. – none of these are valid English words.

Case 2: S _ R Y U
   – Fill position 2 with any unused consonant that makes a valid word.
   – S D R Y U – not valid
   – S F R Y U – not valid
   – S K R Y U – not valid
   – S M R Y U – not valid
   – S P R Y U – not valid
   – S V R Y U – not valid
   – S W R Y U – not valid
   – S Z R Y U – not valid
   – S Q R Y U – not valid
   – S J R Y U – not valid
   – S X R Y U – not valid

None of these combinations form valid English words. This implies we must have missed a possible placement of U or Y.

Re-examining the constraints:

- From SCRUB: U is in the word but not in position 4 (it was marked ✓, so it must be in the word, but the ✓ means it is in the correct position? Wait, let’s re-read the feedback carefully.

Re-reading SCRUB feedback:
SCRUB -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(x) R(✓) U(✓) B(x)
This means:
- S is correct in position 1.
- R is correct in position 3.
- U is correct in position 4.

So the actual word is S _ R U _ (with U fixed in position 4), not S _ R _ _ with U somewhere.

This is a critical correction. The structure is:
S _ R U _

From SUGGY feedback:
S U G G Y
- S(✓) – correct in position 1.
- U(-) – U is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- G(x), G(x) – no G elsewhere.
- Y(-) – Y is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the word is S _ R U _ (from SCRUB) and must also contain Y somewhere, but Y cannot be in position 5 (from SUGGY). The only remaining position for Y is position 2.

Thus the word must be S Y R U _, and the last letter must be a letter we haven’t ruled out yet.

Letters still allowed: D, F, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form SYRUD, SYRUF, SYRUK, SYRUM, SYRUP, etc.

The only common valid word is SYRUP.

Checking constraints:
- S(1) Y(2) R(3) U(4) P(5)
- S is correct in 1 (✓)
- R is correct in 3 (✓)
- U is correct in 4 (✓)
- Y is in 2 (allowed, since Y is allowed in 2 and not ruled out)
- P is new and allowed
- No excluded letters appear.

Therefore, the next guess is SYRUP.",Guess 5: SYRUP -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) Y(✓) R(✓) U(✓) P(✓),SUCCESS
