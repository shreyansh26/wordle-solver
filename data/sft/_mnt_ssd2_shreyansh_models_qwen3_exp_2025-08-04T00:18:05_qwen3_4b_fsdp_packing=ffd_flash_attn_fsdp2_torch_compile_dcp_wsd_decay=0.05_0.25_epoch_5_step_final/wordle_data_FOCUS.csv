For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several letters at once. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 vowels and 2-3 consonants to maximize information gain. The word ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters

This will give us maximum information about which letters are present/absent and their positions.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A, R, E are **not** in the word (x).
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains O and S.
- Does **not** contain A, R, E.
- O is not in position 3, and S is not in position 4.

Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has both O and S.
2. Does not have A, R, E.
3. O is not in position 3.
4. S is not in position 4.

Possible positions for O: 1, 2, 4, 5 (but not 3).
Possible positions for S: 1, 2, 3, 5 (but not 4).

Let's think of words that fit these constraints. Good candidates:
- ""SOUTH"" – has O and S, but O is in position 2 (allowed), S is in position 1 (allowed), and no A/R/E.
- ""SOIL"" – only 4 letters, invalid.
- ""STONY"" – has O and S, positions are O-2, S-1 (allowed), no A/R/E.
- ""SPOOK"" – has O and S, positions O-3 is invalid (O cannot be in position 3).
- ""LOSSY"" – has O and S, positions O-2, S-1 and S-3 (allowed).

""SOUTH"" seems like a strong next guess because:
- It uses O in position 2 (allowed).
- It uses S in position 1 (allowed).
- It avoids A, R, E entirely.
- It introduces new common letters (U, T, H) to gain more information.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, E, T, H  
2. Letters that ARE in the word: O, S  
   - O is in the correct position (position 2).  
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (from Guess 2: S(-) means S is present but wrong place).  
3. Other letters found in the word but in wrong positions: U (from Guess 2: U(-) means U is in the word but not in position 3).

So the pattern so far is:
_ O _ _ _

and we also know:
- S is somewhere in the word but not position 1 or 4.  
- U is somewhere in the word but not position 3.

Remaining candidate letters (excluding A, R, E, T, H):  
B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2.  
- Contains S somewhere (positions 2, 3, or 5).  
- Contains U somewhere (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).  
- Uses only the allowed letters.

Let’s list possible placements:

- O is fixed at position 2.
- S can be at 3 or 5 (cannot be 1 or 4).  
- U can be at 1, 4, or 5 (cannot be 3).

Let’s try S at position 3 and U at position 1:
_ O S _ _

We need two more letters from the remaining pool, avoiding any forbidden letters.  
A good choice is ""POSIT"" but T is forbidden.  
""NOUS"" is 4 letters.  
""FOCUS"" has C and no T, but T is forbidden anyway.  
""LOUIS"" has L, O, U, I, S – but U is at 3, which is allowed (since U(-) just said not at 3 in the previous guess, but that was U in position 3 in ""south"" which is why it's wrong place). Wait, in ""south"" U was at position 3 and feedback was U(-), so U is in the word but not at 3. So U cannot be at 3.

So for _ O S _ _, U must be at 1, 4, or 5.  
If U is at 1: U O S _ _ – but then we have U at 1 and O at 2, S at 3.  
We need two more letters. Let's try ""USOS_"" – but S is already at 3, and we can't have S at 5 if we put S at 3.  
This seems tricky. Let me try S at 5 instead: _ O _ _ S  
Then U must be at 1, 4, or 5. 5 is S, so U at 1 or 4.

Option 1: U O _ _ S  
We need two letters in positions 3 and 4.  
Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
Let's pick common ones: C and L.  
""UOCLS"" – but this isn't a valid word.  
""UOGLS"" – invalid.  
""UONGS"" – invalid.  
""UOCYS"" – invalid.  
This path seems hard.

Option 2: _ O _ U S  
Now U is at 4, S at 5.  
We need letters at 1 and 3.  
Let's try L and I: L O I U S – but this isn't a word.  
Let's try N and D: N O D U S – ""nodus"" isn't a word.  
Let's try P and L: P O L U S – ""polus"" is valid (a variant of pole).  
But is ""polus"" a common 5-letter word? Yes, it's recognized in some dictionaries.

Another option: _ O _ _ S with U at 1: U O _ _ S  
Let's try ""UOGIS"" – invalid.  
""UOFLS"" – invalid.  
""UOKYS"" – invalid.  
Not promising.

Another approach: S at 3, U at 5: _ O S _ U  
We need letters at 1 and 4.  
Let's try ""POS"" – P, O, S, but need 5 letters.  
""POS"" plus two more: P O S I U – ""posiu"" – invalid.  
""POS"" plus ""C"" and ""L"": P O S C U – ""poscu"" – invalid.  
""NOSEL"" – but S is at 3, but we need _ O S _ U.

Wait, let me think of actual words that fit _ O _ _ S or _ O _ U S.

Valid words:
- ""POCUS"" – P, O, C, U, S – this fits:  
  P at 1, O at 2, C at 3, U at 4, S at 5.  
  Letters: P, O, C, U, S – none are forbidden.  
  S is at 5 (allowed, since S cannot be at 1 or 4).  
  U is at 4 (allowed, since U cannot be at 3).  
  This seems perfect.

""POCUS"" is a valid 5-letter word meaning a small amount or portion, and it fits all constraints.

Now U is at 4, S at 5.  
We need letters at 1 and 3.  
Let's try L and I: L O I U S – but this isn't a word.  
Let's try N and D: N O D U S – ""nodus"" isn't a word.  
Let's try P and L: P O L U S – ""polus"" is valid (a variant of pole).  
But is ""polus"" a common 5-letter word? Yes, it's recognized in some dictionaries.

Another option: _ O _ _ S with U at 1: U O _ _ S  
Let's try ""UOGIS"" – invalid.  
""UOFLS"" – invalid.  
""UOKYS"" – invalid.  
Not promising.

Another approach: S at 3, U at 5: _ O S _ U  
We need letters at 1 and 4.  
Let's try ""POS"" – P, O, S, but need 5 letters.  
""POS"" plus two more: P O S I U – ""posiu"" – invalid.  
""POS"" plus ""C"" and ""L"": P O S C U – ""poscu"" – invalid.  
""NOSEL"" – but S is at 3, but we need _ O S _ U.

Wait, let me think of actual words that fit _ O _ _ S or _ O _ U S.

Valid words:
- ""POCUS"" – P, O, C, U, S – this fits:  
  P at 1, O at 2, C at 3, U at 4, S at 5.  
  Letters: P, O, C, U, S – none are forbidden.  
  S is at 5 (allowed, since S cannot be at 1 or 4).  
  U is at 4 (allowed, since U cannot be at 3).  
  This seems perfect.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several letters at once. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 vowels and 2-3 consonants to maximize information gain. The word ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters

This will give us maximum information about which letters are present/absent and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A, R, E are **not** in the word (x).
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains O and S.
- Does **not** contain A, R, E.
- O is not in position 3, and S is not in position 4.

Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has both O and S.
2. Does not have A, R, E.
3. O is not in position 3.
4. S is not in position 4.

Possible positions for O: 1, 2, 4, 5 (but not 3).
Possible positions for S: 1, 2, 3, 5 (but not 4).

Let's think of words that fit these constraints. Good candidates:
- ""SOUTH"" – has O and S, but O is in position 2 (allowed), S is in position 1 (allowed), and no A/R/E.
- ""SOIL"" – only 4 letters, invalid.
- ""STONY"" – has O and S, positions are O-2, S-1 (allowed), no A/R/E.
- ""SPOOK"" – has O and S, positions O-3 is invalid (O cannot be in position 3).
- ""LOSSY"" – has O and S, positions O-2, S-1 and S-3 (allowed).

""SOUTH"" seems like a strong next guess because:
- It uses O in position 2 (allowed).
- It uses S in position 1 (allowed).
- It avoids A, R, E entirely.
- It introduces new common letters (U, T, H) to gain more information.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: south -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(✓) U(-) T(x) H(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, E, T, H  
2. Letters that ARE in the word: O, S  
   - O is in the correct position (position 2).  
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (from Guess 2: S(-) means S is present but wrong place).  
3. Other letters found in the word but in wrong positions: U (from Guess 2: U(-) means U is in the word but not in position 3).

So the pattern so far is:
_ O _ _ _

and we also know:
- S is somewhere in the word but not position 1 or 4.  
- U is somewhere in the word but not position 3.

Remaining candidate letters (excluding A, R, E, T, H):  
B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2.  
- Contains S somewhere (positions 2, 3, or 5).  
- Contains U somewhere (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).  
- Uses only the allowed letters.

Let’s list possible placements:

- O is fixed at position 2.
- S can be at 3 or 5 (cannot be 1 or 4).  
- U can be at 1, 4, or 5 (cannot be 3).

Let’s try S at position 3 and U at position 1:
_ O S _ _

We need two more letters from the remaining pool, avoiding any forbidden letters.  
A good choice is ""POSIT"" but T is forbidden.  
""NOUS"" is 4 letters.  
""FOCUS"" has C and no T, but T is forbidden anyway.  
""LOUIS"" has L, O, U, I, S – but U is at 3, which is allowed (since U(-) just said not at 3 in the previous guess, but that was U in position 3 in ""south"" which is why it's wrong place). Wait, in ""south"" U was at position 3 and feedback was U(-), so U is in the word but not at 3. So U cannot be at 3.

So for _ O S _ _, U must be at 1, 4, or 5.  
If U is at 1: U O S _ _ – but then we have U at 1 and O at 2, S at 3.  
We need two more letters. Let's try ""USOS_"" – but S is already at 3, and we can't have S at 5 if we put S at 3.  
This seems tricky. Let me try S at 5 instead: _ O _ _ S  
Then U must be at 1, 4, or 5. 5 is S, so U at 1 or 4.

Option 1: U O _ _ S  
We need two letters in positions 3 and 4.  
Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
Let's pick common ones: C and L.  
""UOCLS"" – but this isn't a valid word.  
""UOGLS"" – invalid.  
""UONGS"" – invalid.  
""UOCYS"" – invalid.  
This path seems hard.

Option 2: _ O _ U S  
Now U is at 4, S at 5.  
We need letters at 1 and 3.  
Let's try L and I: L O I U S – but this isn't a word.  
Let's try N and D: N O D U S – ""nodus"" isn't a word.  
Let's try P and L: P O L U S – ""polus"" is valid (a variant of pole).  
But is ""polus"" a common 5-letter word? Yes, it's recognized in some dictionaries.

Another option: _ O _ _ S with U at 1: U O _ _ S  
Let's try ""UOGIS"" – invalid.  
""UOFLS"" – invalid.  
""UOKYS"" – invalid.  
Not promising.

Another approach: S at 3, U at 5: _ O S _ U  
We need letters at 1 and 4.  
Let's try ""POS"" – P, O, S, but need 5 letters.  
""POS"" plus two more: P O S I U – ""posiu"" – invalid.  
""POS"" plus ""C"" and ""L"": P O S C U – ""poscu"" – invalid.  
""NOSEL"" – but S is at 3, but we need _ O S _ U.

Wait, let me think of actual words that fit _ O _ _ S or _ O _ U S.

Valid words:
- ""POCUS"" – P, O, C, U, S – this fits:  
  P at 1, O at 2, C at 3, U at 4, S at 5.  
  Letters: P, O, C, U, S – none are forbidden.  
  S is at 5 (allowed, since S cannot be at 1 or 4).  
  U is at 4 (allowed, since U cannot be at 3).  
  This seems perfect.
