For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word with 5 distinct letters from these. ""SLATE"" is a good choice because it includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters, and covers vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, L, T).

From the feedback:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:

- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Includes E (but not as the last letter).
2. Excludes S, L, A, T.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Looking at remaining common consonants: R, N, I, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, K, V, W, X, Z, Q, J.

Good candidates: ""CRANE"" (but A is excluded), ""PRUNE"" (A/S/T excluded), ""MERGE"" (but E is in wrong position, and we need E not at end), ""CHORE"" (but O is common vowel, but E is at end which is invalid).

Better choice: ""CRIME"" - has C, R, I, M, E. E is not at end, and doesn't use excluded letters. Also includes common consonants C, R, M and vowel I. This seems optimal.

From the new feedback on CRIME:

- C is in the word and in the correct first position (✓).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- I and M are not in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So far we know:
1. Word starts with C.
2. Contains E, R, but E and R are not in their guessed positions (E is not 5th, R is not 2nd).
3. Excludes: S, L, A, T, I, M.

Remaining common letters to try: N, D, P, H, G, B, F, Y, K, V, W, U, O.

We need a word that:
- Starts with C.
- Contains E and R somewhere (but E not last, R not second).
- Uses only allowed letters.

Possible structure: C _ _ _ _

Let’s try placing R in a different position. If R can’t be 2nd, maybe 3rd or 4th.

Try “CONER” – but O is allowed, N is allowed, E is 4th (allowed), R is 5th (allowed). But we need to check if it uses excluded letters: C, O, N, E, R. None are excluded except maybe O – but O hasn’t been excluded. This seems possible.

Another option: “CURER” – but U is allowed, R is 4th (allowed), E is 3rd (allowed). But R is still in 4th, which is fine.

Better to try “CONER” first as it tests O, N, E, R in new positions.

But wait, E was already in CRIME at 5th position (invalid), now in CONER it’s 4th – that’s allowed. R is 5th instead of 2nd – that’s allowed.

However, CONER might be less likely since N hasn’t been tested yet. Let me think of a word that better spreads the remaining common letters.

Try “CUBER” – but B is allowed, U is allowed, B is 3rd, E is 4th, R is 5th. But we excluded M, I, A, T, S, L – B is allowed. This seems good.

But simpler: “CREPE” – but P is allowed, E is 3rd, R is 2nd – but R can’t be 2nd (from CRIME feedback), so this is invalid.

Next: “CHORE” – but O is allowed, H is allowed, R is 4th (allowed), E is 5th (invalid, E can’t be 5th).

Next: “COWER” – O, W, E, R – E is 4th (allowed), R is 5th (allowed). W and O are new letters.

This seems strong: tests W, O, E, R in new positions.

But to maximize common letters, perhaps “COWER” is better.

Alternatively, “CURER” – but U is less common.

I’ll go with “COWER” as it introduces two new common letters (W, O) while placing E and R in allowed positions.

Wait, let’s double-check:

C (correct), O (new), W (new), E (allowed position 4), R (allowed position 5).

Yes, this seems optimal.

But simpler: “CREPE” – but P is allowed, E is 3rd, R is 2nd – but R can’t be 2nd (from CRIME feedback), so this is invalid.

Next: “CHORE” – but O is allowed, H is allowed, R is 4th (allowed), E is 5th (invalid, E can’t be 5th).

Next: “COWER” – O, W, E, R – E is 4th (allowed), R is 5th (allowed). W and O are new letters.

This seems strong: tests W, O, E, R in new positions.

But to maximize common letters, perhaps “COWER” is better.

Alternatively, “CURER” – but U is less common.

I’ll go with “COWER” as it introduces two new common letters (W, O) while placing E and R in allowed positions.

Wait, let’s double-check:

C (correct), O (new), W (new), E (allowed position 4), R (allowed position 5).

Yes, this seems optimal.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word with 5 distinct letters from these. ""SLATE"" is a good choice because it includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters, and covers vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, L, T). This should give good initial feedback on multiple fronts.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>

From the feedback:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains E, but not in the 5th position.
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Includes E (but not as the last letter).
2. Excludes S, L, A, T.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Looking at remaining common consonants: R, N, I, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, K, V, W, X, Z, Q, J.

Good candidates: ""CRANE"" (but A is excluded), ""PRUNE"" (A/S/T excluded), ""MERGE"" (but E is in wrong position, and we need E not at end), ""CHORE"" (but O is common vowel, but E is at end which is invalid).

Better choice: ""CRIME"" - has C, R, I, M, E. E is not at end, and doesn't use excluded letters. Also includes common consonants C, R, M and vowel I. This seems optimal.

From the new feedback on CRIME:

- C is in the word and in the correct first position (✓).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- I and M are not in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So far we know:
1. Word starts with C.
2. Contains E, R, but E and R are not in their guessed positions (E is not 5th, R is not 2nd).
3. Excludes: S, L, A, T, I, M.

Remaining common letters to try: N, D, P, H, G, B, F, Y, K, V, W, U, O.

We need a word that:
- Starts with C.
- Contains E and R somewhere (but E not last, R not second).
- Uses only allowed letters.

Possible structure: C _ _ _ _

Let’s try placing R in a different position. If R can’t be 2nd, maybe 3rd or 4th.

Try “CONER” – but O is allowed, N is allowed, E is 4th (allowed), R is 5th (allowed). But we need to check if it uses excluded letters: C, O, N, E, R. None are excluded except maybe O – but O hasn’t been excluded. This seems possible.

Another option: “CURER” – but U is allowed, R is 4th (allowed), E is 3rd (allowed). But R is still in 4th, which is fine.

Better to try “CONER” first as it tests O, N, E, R in new positions.

But wait, E was already in CRIME at 5th position (invalid), now in CONER it’s 4th – that’s allowed. R is 5th instead of 2nd – that’s allowed.

However, CONER might be less likely since N hasn’t been tested yet. Let me think of a word that better spreads the remaining common letters.

Try “CUBER” – but B is allowed, U is allowed, B is 3rd, E is 4th, R is 5th. But we excluded M, I, A, T, S, L – B is allowed. This seems good.

But simpler: “CREPE” – but P is allowed, E is 3rd, R is 2nd – but R can’t be 2nd (from CRIME feedback), so this is invalid.

Next: “CHORE” – but O is allowed, H is allowed, R is 4th (allowed), E is 5th (invalid, E can’t be 5th).

Next: “COWER” – O, W, E, R – E is 4th (allowed), R is 5th (allowed). W and O are new letters.

This seems strong: tests W, O, E, R in new positions.

But to maximize common letters, perhaps “COWER” is better.

Alternatively, “CURER” – but U is less common.

I’ll go with “COWER” as it introduces two new common letters (W, O) while placing E and R in allowed positions.

Wait, let’s double-check:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word with 5 distinct letters from these. ""SLATE"" is a good choice because it includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters, and covers vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, L, T). This should give good initial feedback on multiple fronts.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains E, but not in the 5th position.
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Includes E (but not as the last letter).
2. Excludes S, L, A, T.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Looking at remaining common consonants: R, N, I, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, K, V, W, X, Z, Q, J.

Good candidates: ""CRANE"" (but A is excluded), ""PRUNE"" (A/S/T excluded), ""MERGE"" (but E is in wrong position, and we need E not at end), ""CHORE"" (but O is common vowel, but E is at end which is invalid).

Better choice: ""CRIME"" - has C, R, I, M, E. E is not at end, and doesn't use excluded letters. Also includes common consonants C, R, M and vowel I. This seems optimal.

Guess 2: CRIME -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) I(x) M(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on CRIME:

- C is in the word and in the correct first position (✓).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- I and M are not in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So far we know:
1. Word starts with C.
2. Contains E, R, but E and R are not in their guessed positions (E is not 5th, R is not 2nd).
3. Excludes: S, L, A, T, I, M.

Remaining common letters to try: N, D, P, H, G, B, F, Y, K, V, W, U, O.

We need a word that:
- Starts with C.
- Contains E and R somewhere (but E not last, R not second).
- Uses only allowed letters.

Possible structure: C _ _ _ _

Let’s try placing R in a different position. If R can’t be 2nd, maybe 3rd or 4th.

Try “CONER” – but O is allowed, N is allowed, E is 4th (allowed), R is 5th (allowed). But we need to check if it uses excluded letters: C, O, N, E, R. None are excluded except maybe O – but O hasn’t been excluded. This seems possible.

Another option: “CURER” – but U is allowed, R is 4th (allowed), E is 3rd (allowed). But R is still in 4th, which is fine.

Better to try “CONER” first as it tests O, N, E, R in new positions.

But wait, E was already in CRIME at 5th position (invalid), now in CONER it’s 4th – that’s allowed. R is 5th instead of 2nd – that’s allowed.

However, CONER might be less likely since N hasn’t been tested yet. Let me think of a word that better spreads the remaining common letters.

Try “CUBER” – but B is allowed, U is allowed, B is 3rd, E is 4th, R is 5th. But we excluded M, I, A, T, S, L – B is allowed. This seems good.

But simpler: “CREPE” – but P is allowed, E is 3rd, R is 2nd – but R can’t be 2nd (from CRIME feedback), so this is invalid.

Next: “CHORE” – but O is allowed, H is allowed, R is 4th (allowed), E is 5th (invalid, E can’t be 5th).

Next: “COWER” – O, W, E, R – E is 4th (allowed), R is 5th (allowed). W and O are new letters.

This seems strong: tests W, O, E, R in new positions.

But to maximize common letters, perhaps “COWER” is better.

Alternatively, “CURER” – but U is less common.

I’ll go with “COWER” as it introduces two new common letters (W, O) while placing E and R in allowed positions.

Wait, let’s double-check:

C (correct), O (new), W (new), E (allowed position 4), R (allowed position 5).

Yes, this seems optimal.

Guess 3: COWER -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) W(x) E(✓) R(✓)

From the latest feedback on COWER:

- C(✓) – correct in position 1  
- O(✓) – correct in position 2  
- W(x) – W is NOT in the word  
- E(✓) – correct in position 4  
- R(✓) – correct in position 5  

So the word structure is now fully determined:  
C O _ E R

We only need to find the missing third letter (position 3) from the remaining alphabet, excluding letters already ruled out: S, L, A, T, I, M, W.

Allowed letters for position 3: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Among these, common English letters that fit are B, D, F, G, H, K, N, P.

Quick scan of real 5-letter words that match CO _ ER:

- COBER – uncommon variant, possible  
- CODER – valid word (programmer)  
- COFER – uncommon  
- CONER – valid (archaic, but accepted)  
- COGER – uncommon  
- COMER – but M is already excluded  
- COYER – uncommon  
- COZER – archaic  

The most common and safe choice is **CODER**.
