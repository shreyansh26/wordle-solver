### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in 5-letter English words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like T, N, S, R, L. A good starting word should ideally include a mix of these.

Some popular and effective starting words are:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers common consonants (S, L, T) and the most common vowels (A, E). This should help eliminate or confirm many letters early on.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- T is in the word and in the correct 4th position.
- E is in the word and in the correct 5th position.
- S, L, A are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends in “TE” and does not contain S, L, or A.  
We still need to determine the first three letters.

Good consonants left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, R, V, W, Y  
Good vowels left: I, O, U (A and E are already placed)

Let’s pick a word that:
1. Ends in TE
2. Uses new consonants (avoiding S, L)
3. Avoids A

A strong candidate is “NIGHT”:
- N, I, G, H are all fresh letters.
- Ends in TE (matches required pattern).
- Doesn’t use S, L, or A.

Another candidate is “CRATE”, but A is already ruled out, so that’s no good.  
“MOTET” uses O and T, but T is already fixed in 4th spot, so duplicate T is allowed but not ideal for info gain.

“NIGHT” gives us three new consonants (N, G, H) and one new vowel (I) to test.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in 5-letter English words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like T, N, S, R, L. A good starting word should ideally include a mix of these.

Some popular and effective starting words are:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers common consonants (S, L, T) and the most common vowels (A, E). This should help eliminate or confirm many letters early on.

   – Word does NOT contain S, L, A.

2. NIGHT → N(x) I(x) G(x) H(x) T(-)  
   – T is now marked as “in the word but wrong position.”  
   – This contradicts the first feedback, which said T is in the correct position (4).  
   – Therefore, the feedback for NIGHT must be interpreted as:  
       T is in the word but NOT in position 5 (since position 4 is already locked as T).  
       However, position 4 is already confirmed as T, so the only possible explanation is that the feedback for NIGHT is indicating that T is in the word but in the wrong position within NIGHT (position 5), which is consistent because the actual T is in position 4.

   – Letters N, I, G, H are all absent.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ _ T E  
- Letters not in the word: S, L, A, N, I, G, H

Remaining consonants to try: B, C, D, F, K, M, P, R, V, W, Y  
Remaining vowels: O, U (since A, I, E are ruled out/used)

We need a 5-letter word ending in TE, using only the allowed letters, and ideally testing new consonants and vowels.

Candidate words:
- B O U N T Y → no, ends in TY  
- C R O W D → no, ends in D  
- D R O P T E → no, ends in TE but P is not tested  
- F R O N T E → no, ends in E but needs TE  
- M O U N T E → ends in TE, uses M, O, U, N. But N is ruled out.  
- P O U R T E → no, ends in E but needs TE  
- R O U T E → ends in E but needs TE  
- W O R T E → ends in TE, uses W, O, R, T, E. All letters are allowed (W, O, R not yet ruled out), and it fits the pattern _ _ _ T E.

Let’s choose WORT E to test W, O, R.

Word: W O R T E

From the feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(✓)  
   – Pattern: _ _ _ T E  
   – Letters not in word: S, L, A, N, I, G, H

2. NIGHT → N(x) I(x) G(x) H(x) T(-)  
   – Confirms T is in the word but not in position 5 (consistent with pattern _ _ _ T E).  
   – Ruled out letters: N, I, G, H

3. WORTE → W(✓) O(-) R(-) T(✓) E(✓)  
   – W is correct in position 1.  
   – O is in the word but not in position 2.  
   – R is in the word but not in position 3.  
   – T and E are correct in positions 4 and 5.

Current pattern: W _ _ T E  
Letters known to be in the word: W, T, E, O, R  
Letters ruled out: S, L, A, N, I, G, H

Remaining consonants to try: B, C, D, F, K, M, P, V, Y  
Remaining vowels: none (A, I, O, U, E – only O and E remain, but E is already used, and O is already confirmed present but not in position 2).

Since O must appear somewhere other than position 2, and the word is W _ _ T E, O must be in position 3 (because position 1 is W, position 4 is T, position 5 is E).  
R must also appear somewhere, but positions 1, 4, 5 are taken, so R must be in position 2.

This gives us: W R O T E.

Let’s verify:
- W(✓) in position 1 – matches feedback.  
- R(-) in position 2 – feedback says R is in the word but not in position 3; here it’s in position 2, so consistent.  
- O(-) in position 3 – feedback says O is in the word but not in position 2; here it’s in position 3, so consistent.  
- T(✓) in position 4 – matches.  
- E(✓) in position 5 – matches.

Therefore, the word is WR OTE.
