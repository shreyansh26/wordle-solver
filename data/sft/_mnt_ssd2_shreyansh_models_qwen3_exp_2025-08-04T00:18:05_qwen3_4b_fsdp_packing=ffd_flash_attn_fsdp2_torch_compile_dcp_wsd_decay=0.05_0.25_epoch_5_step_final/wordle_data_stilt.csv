### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information we can gain. This typically means selecting a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is a popular starting choice because it includes:
- S, T (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)
- L (moderately common consonant)

This gives us good coverage across different letter frequencies and positions. Another strong contender is ""CRANE"" for similar reasons. However, ""SLATE"" is slightly more balanced in terms of consonant coverage.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as the first guess since it provides a good mix of common letters and can help narrow down many possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the correct first position (✓)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is not in the word (x)
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is not in the word (x)

So far we know:
1. The word starts with S
2. It contains L and T, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively
3. It does not contain A or E

Next, we want to test new letters while keeping S in position 1 and trying to place L and T correctly. Good letters to test next might be R, N, I, O, C, etc.

A strong second guess would be one that:
- Keeps S in position 1
- Tests new common letters
- Tries possible positions for L and T

Possible candidates: SPLIT, SLURP, STIRL, STONY, etc.

""SPLIT"" seems good because:
- Keeps S in position 1
- Tests P (new letter)
- Tests L in position 2 (was position 2 in SLATE, so now testing position 2 again but as the second letter)
- Tests T in position 4 (was position 4 in SLATE, so now testing position 4 again but as the fourth letter)
- Tests I (new letter)

This seems like a good way to both re-test positions for L and T and introduce new letters.

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(-) A(x) T(-) E(x)
   - S is correct in position 1
   - L is in the word but not in position 2
   - T is in the word but not in position 4

2. SPLIT → S(✓) P(x) L(-) I(-) T(✓)

   - P is not in the word
   - L is in the word but not in position 3
   - I is in the word but not in position 4
   - T is correct in position 5

So far we know:
- Word structure: S _ _ _ T
- Must contain: L (not in position 2 or 3), I (not in position 4)
- Must not contain: A, E, P

Possible positions for L: 3 or 4 (but from SPLIT feedback, L is not in position 3, so L must be in position 4)
Possible positions for I: 2 or 3 (since it can't be in position 4 and position 5 is T)

Therefore:
- Word structure: S _ _ L T
- I must be in position 2 or 3
- Need to test remaining letters

Good next guess would be ""SILUT"" but that's not a valid word. Instead, let's think of valid words fitting S _ _ L T:
- SUILT? Not valid
- SKILT? Not valid
- SCILT? Not valid
- SHILT? Not valid
- SNILT? Not valid

Wait, let's think of valid words with structure S _ _ L T:
- ""SPLIT"" already tried
- ""STILT""? That's a valid word (though uncommon)
- ""SKINT""? Not matching our L constraint
- ""SKULT""? Not valid
- ""SWILT""? Not valid

Actually, let's think of words with I in position 2 or 3:
- If I is in position 2: S I _ L T → ""SIULT""? Not valid
- If I is in position 3: S _ I L T → ""S _ I L T""

Looking for valid words: ""SKILT"" is invalid, but ""SKINT"" is invalid. Let's think of ""SUILT""? Not valid.

Wait, let's think of ""SUILT"" - no. How about ""SILKT""? No.

Actually, let's think of ""SILKT"" - no. Let's think of ""SILVT"" - no.

This suggests we need to try new letters. Let's think of words with structure S _ _ L T and valid letters:

""STILT"" seems the only valid word fitting S _ _ L T structure. Let's try it.

But wait, let's verify:
- STILT: S T I L T
- Structure: S T I L T - positions: 1 2 3 4 5
- L is in position 4 (matches our deduction)
- I is in position 3 (matches our deduction)
- T is in position 5 (matches our deduction)
- S is in position 1 (matches our deduction)
- P is not in word (good)
- A and E are not in word (good)

This seems correct. Let's use STILT.

However, STILT might be uncommon. Let's think of other possibilities.

Alternative approach: Since we have S _ _ L T and need to fill positions 2 and 3 with letters not yet tested and not A, E, P.

Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

- ""SNULT"" - no
- ""SMILT"" - no

Another valid word: ""STILT"" seems to be the only valid word fitting S _ _ L T. Let's use it.

However, let's think of ""SUILT"" - no. Actually, let's think of ""SUILT"" - no.

Upon reflection, ""STILT"" is actually a valid English word meaning a small ladder or pole used for reaching. It fits all constraints.

- S(✓) in position 1
- T is in position 2 (new letter)
- I is in position 3 (new letter)
- L is in position 4 (✓)

This tests new letters T and I in positions 2 and 3, which are critical for solving the puzzle.

Therefore, the next guess is STILT.Based on the feedback so far:
- Word structure: S _ _ L T (L must be in position 4, T in position 5)
- Must include: I (not in position 4)
- Must not include: A, E, P

The only valid word that fits these constraints is ""STILT"".",Guess 3: STILT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) I(✓) L(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
